# Union member's case is suspended
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
Arbitration proceedings for a
member of United Stanford
Workers (USW) who was discharged
after being accused of vandalism
have been suspended until Aug. 29,
the earliest date a third and final day
of hearings could be scheduled.
Hearings regarding the reinstate
ment of Victor Hill, a shipping and
receiving clerk, could not be com
pleted Thursday, the second of two
days originally allotted to the case.
Both union and University offi
cials said they had hoped the arbitra
tion would be completed last week.
"We hoped the hearings would
end in two days," said Priscilla
Wheeler, staff counsel for the Uni
versity. "We've been anxious to put
the information to the arbiter," she
said.
The University, which has to
prove that Hill's termination was
justified, put its case first, said Susan
de Jongh Kearl, associate staff coun
sel for the University.
"The delay is not beneficial to
Victor Hill because he must wait
longer until he is reinstated," ac
cording to Mary Ann Tenuto, USW
staff counsel.
Tenuto added, however, that the
extra day of hearings will give the
union additional time to examine
evidence which the University had
withheld until the first two days of
hearings.
Hill said that he was expecting the

delay and he is looking forward to
the resumption of the hearing.
Hill was dismissed last October
for allegedly slashing the tires of his
supervisor.
Hill added that the arbitration
hearing has already been delayed
once by the illness of Felix Bar
thelemy, manager of Employee Re
lations, and that another delay did
not surprise him.
The hearings became controver
sial two weeks ago when the union
filed a complaint with the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
charging that the University had
withheld evidence in the case.
"The University withheld infor
mation," and thus "made it very dif
ficult for the union to prepare in ad
vance," Tenuto said.
Under federal labor laws, the
USW has a right to investigate the
evidence that the University
presents, Tenuto said. By withhold
ing the information, the University
slowed down the progress of the
trial, she added.
But according to Wheeler, the
charges filed with the NLRB are a
"red herring."
"They cloud the merits of the
case," she said.
The union brought its complaints
to the arbiter a couple of weeks
before the hearing, and the arbiter
upheld the position of the Univer
sity, Wheeler said.
Attorneys for both sides declined
to comment on the status of the case
because it is still in progress.
