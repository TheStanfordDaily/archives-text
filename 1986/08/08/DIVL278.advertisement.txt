MESQUITE
We're sure you've heard or read about
mesquite charcoal. It's the hottest thing
to hit the culinary world this decade.
Mesquite charcoal bums at extremely
hot temperatures and imparts a
delicious smokey taste to meats, fish &
poultry. Imagine what mesquite logs, real
wood not charcoal, could do for ribs,
sirloin or chicken. Come to Willy's.
The best little rib house^^^T^xas!"
