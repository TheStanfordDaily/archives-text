Anchor Pad uses a high-tech adhesive capable of
securing your equipment with over 6,000 lbs. of grip
strength. This is secured to your desk with a duel locking
system. The computer can be used while locked to the
"pad" and can be removed only with a unique key.
Your warranty need not be voided by attachment of the
Anchor Pad, which does NOT require drilling holes in your
machine. Your furniture is not damaged as there is NO
drilling of holes or marring the furniture surface. The
adhesive mat can be removed from the surface when
desired using a "special" heat process.
The equipment ranges in price from $80 to $300
including installation, and a replacement warranty for each
PC up to $5,000 per machine and $25,000 per occurrence if
the Anchor Pad is defeated and equipment is stolen.
