## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
Students and Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons are very close to
agreeing on the charter for a pro
posed police review board as a result
of a meeting yesterday, according to
ASSU Senator John van Loben
Sels.
Van Loben Sels said he expects to
get approval for the charter in a few
weeks, probably after another
meeting, and to have the board
functioning by fall quarter.
Lyons agreed that the review
board's charter will soon be finished.
"We're very near a document that
everyone feels very good about,"
said Lyons. "I don't think there are
any big differences (in opinion)."
The meeting yesterday was the
fourth in a series starting in April in
which Lyons and a group of stu
dents, including ASSU Senate and
Council of President members, have
discussed the formation of a police
review board to investigate com
plaints against the Stanford police.
