# New police agreement draws near
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
Students and Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons are very close to
agreeing on the charter for a pro
posed police review board as a result
of a meeting yesterday, according to
ASSU Senator John van Loben
Sels.
Van Loben Sels said he expects to
get approval for the charter in a few
weeks, probably after another
meeting, and to have the board
functioning by fall quarter.
Lyons agreed that the review
board's charter will soon be finished.
"We're very near a document that
everyone feels very good about,"
said Lyons. "I don't think there are
any big differences (in opinion)."
The meeting yesterday was the
fourth in a series starting in April in
which Lyons and a group of stu
dents, including ASSU Senate and
Council of President members, have
discussed the formation of a police
review board to investigate com
plaints against the Stanford police.
I he idea for the review board
came about last October after Stan
ford student Robby Perkins charged
both the Stanford police and the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Office
with brutality. Perkins made the
charges after being arrested for his
participation in an Old Union sit-in
calling for University divestment
from companies doing business in
South Africa.
Yesterday's meeting consisted of
adding revisions that the students
had come up with, according to van
Loben Sels. Such things as expecta
tions from the community and
membership arrangement were also
discussed, but those who attended
the meeting declined to comment
on the specifics of the board until
the charter had been finalized.
The review board will consist of
some combination of students, fac
ulty, staff and police, said van
Loben Sels.
"I see the organization as being

successful," said COP member
Rudy Fuentes. "Some action will be
taken when people bring complaints
to the board."
The charter will "at some point
get the scrutiny of other staff mem
bers," according to Lyons.
Fuentes said he feels it is impor
tant to see the board as something
constructive providing "commun
ication between police and stu
dents."
"As a minority at Stanford, I see
the role of the Stanford police to
provide security, but often their
defense of security goes beyond what
is justified," he said, adding that
police often harass black and
Hispanic students by arbitrarily ask
ing for identification.
"The biggest task will be in the
first year of the board's existence,"
said van Loben Sels. "Our (the
ASSU's) job will be to fix up any
problems with the board."
Fuentes emphasized the need for
student involvement in forming and
documenting grievances.
