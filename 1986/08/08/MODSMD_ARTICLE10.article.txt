Rehnquist may be recalled to stand
WASHINGTON — William Rehnquist may be asked to give fur
ther testimony on his nomination as chief justice, Democratic
senators said yesterday while conceding they had no fresh ammunition
to prevent his confirmation.
Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Howard Metzenbaum (D-
Ohio) said they were considering requesting that Rehnquist appear for
further questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
But there was no other support for the idea expressed at a meeting of
the committee.
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said confidential memoranda dealing
with Rehnquist's role as a lawyer in the Nixon Administration did not
reveal any damaging information about the nominee.
But Kennedy said the memos showed Rehnquist was "active in a lot
of different activities of that period" of the late 1960s and early 1970s
and said the justice's testimony "may be necessary."
Move to block chemical bomb fails
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday narrowly rejected a
move to block production of the "Bigeye" chemical bomb as Vice
President George Bush cast his third tie-breaking vote in four years in
support of the Reagan Administration's effort to resume manufactur
ing of nerve-gas weapons after a 17-year moratorium.
Bush cast his largely symbolic vote after the Senate split 50 to 50
over a proposal from Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) to deny funds for
producing the bomb except for testing purposes unless Congress votes
specifically to authorize further production.
The Bigeye, centerpiece of President Reagan's plan to modernize
the U.S. chemical-weapons arsenal with "binary" bombs and shells,
gets its lethal punch from mixing two non-toxic chemicals that
produce nerve gas after it is dropped.
Science nears fusion power milestone
PRINCETON, N.J. — Scientists have heated a rarified gas to a
record 13 times as hot as the core of the sun, a big step toward harness
ing the "fusion" nuclear reaction that powers the stars, researchers said
yesterday.
The gas temperature inside a doughnut-shaped reactor in several
mid-July experiments reached 200 million degrees centigrade, or 360
million degrees Fahrenheit, said Harold Furth, director of the Prince
ton University plasma physics laboratory.
He said researchers hope next year to achieve the right combination
of heating, insulation and gas density that will lead to a long-sought
goal: getting as much energy out of a fusion reaction as researchers
have to put into it.
That "break-even" point should actually be achieved in 1989, he
said. It is regarded as a crucial milestone because researchers hope to
use fusion energy for commercial power generation early in the next
century.
