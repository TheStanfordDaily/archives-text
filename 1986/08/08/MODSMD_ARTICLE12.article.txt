Botha offer faces acid test
JOHANNESBURG â€” In an unprecedented court
action, a white political prisoner is claiming the right
to be freed because he has accepted the conditions for
release that President Pieter Botha set for black
nationalist leader Nelson Mandela last January and
later extended to others.
The prisoner, Renfrew Christie, wrote to the presi
dent renouncing the use of violence to achieve politi
cal ends, which Botha had said was all Mandela
needed to do to go free. But prison authorities have
told Christie that he cannot be released and that ac
cepting the president's offer is only one factor among
many to be considered when deciding whether to free
a prisoner.
Christie began an action yesterday in the Supreme

Court of Transvaal province saying his acceptance of
Botha's offer made it a binding agreement
Civil rights lawyers called the case a test of the sin
cerity of Botha's conditional offer to release Mandela,
which has become a key factor in the international
campaign to impose economic sanctions on South
Africa for its policy of apartheid.
Botha's response has been that he will release
Mandela if the black leader renounces his organiza
tion's commitment to trying to overthrow the apart
heid system by guerrilla struggle.
Botha has referred repeatedy to a speech he made
in the South African Parliament in January spelling
out his offer to do this, and has argued that by refus
ing to accept his condition, Mandela, who has served
24 years of a life sentence, is now responsible for his
own imprisonment.
