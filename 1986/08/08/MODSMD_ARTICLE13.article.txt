While Western diplomats and the media praise the Soviets for al
lowing dissident Anatoly Shcharansky's family members to join him
in Israel, Mikhail Gorbachev must be chuckling at what has been
labeled his "new liberalism."
With Gorbachev's treatment of this particularly sensitive case,
Westerners are determined to prove that the Soviets are cleaning up
their traditionally shoddy human rights record. But does this recent
resolution mark any real change in the Soviets' stance toward emigra
tion?
Other, less publicized cases provide evidence to the contrary. West
ern estimates set the number of Jews wanting to emigrate from the So
viet Union at 40,000; predictably, the Soviets cite the actual number
as only 4,000. Whatever the figure, fewer than 1,000 Jews a year have
actually been permitted to leave the country since Gorbachev took of
fice. Compared to the 1979 allowance of 51,320 Jewish emigrations,
Gorbachev apparently has not inspired a great deal of liberalism in the
Soviet policy.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of Jews desiring to leave the Soviet
Union are unrecognized by Western media. Because their names are
not familiar, these people do not have Western pressure on their side.
Luckily, Yelena Bonner, wife of Soviet dissident and Nobel
laureate Andrei Sakharov, had enough notoriety to force Moscow to
allow her to leave last spring for a heart operation in the West. But
now that Bonner is back in the Soviet Union, she and her husband
have been subjected to open intimidation on a far grander scale than
before her much applauded trip. Small wonder that since returning
home, Bonner has suffered two recurrences of the kind of heart pain
that led to her operation.
Certainly, the Soviet leadership's more tolerant treatment of such
media-sensitive cases as that of Shcharansky and his relatives can be
praised. At least the Soviets seem to be learning that it is better to
prevent martyrdom by giving these particular emigres their freedom,
than to solve the problem by making them disappear. Hopefully, this
policy will extend to Bonner and Sakharov in the future.
But the media and diplomatic forces in the United States should be
careful not to mistake a more subtle and shrewd policy for a more
liberal one. It is only to Gorbachev's advantage to make the United
States feel that the Soviets are more willing to compromise and
negotiate. Rather than take the Soviets at their word, we should play
their game: Let's applaud Gorbachev's "new liberalism," but keep the
political pressure on for some real results.
