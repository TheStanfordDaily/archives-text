Night Guy doubted
I read the Night Guy review of
July 29 with great interest, as Clvb
DVB is one of my favorite places in
San Francisco.
How fortunate for us in the Stan
ford community to have you, our
own Emily Post of Cool, to instruct
us in the proper behavior at a dance
club. Tell me, sir, where can I buy
your instruction manual so that I
may be as cool as you?
While I certainly wouldn't argue
with your advice concerning drugs
and alcohol, I find your readiness to
judge others' dance styles offensive.
In your piece you focus so intently
on criticizing the patrons' dancing
that you overlook a more significant
point — people enjoy themselves at
DVB (yourself excepted, ap
parently). Because the club is not a
meatmarket and is not yet overly
crowded, it provides the rare oppor
tunity to dance in whatever fashion
one feels like, and few people
(fortunately) appear to be concerned
with what anybody else thinks of
their dancing.
As for your comments concerning
the music, it will no doubt surprise
you to learn that none of the selec
tions was chosen with your personal
tastes in mind. I'm sure even your
favorite club plays some songs that
you dislike, unless of course you are
not a man of discriminating tastes,
which I'm certain is not the case.
What I find so particularly annoy
ing about your article is the way it so
perfectly exemplifies "cool" conser
vatism: "Hey Johnny, let's be totally
different from our parents and break
away from the norms they live by,
but anybody who doesn't look like us
and act like us won't be acceptable. "
What, then, distinguishes us from
our parents? The fact that we dress

differently and put colored mousse
in our hair when we go out? These
distinctions arc trivial at best.
1 suppose that by now I should
know better than to expect anything
else from a fellow student at Stan
ford, the bastion of conservatism
and conformity in the West. Your
article conformed to my expecta
tions, and that was a disappoint
ment. The one glimmer of hope I
see is the (limited) possibility that
you will outgrow your elitist attitude
before you graduate. If not, I'm sure
that within the next five years we'll
see your helpful manual at
bookstores everywhere, properly
placed between "How to Make Mil
lions in Real Estate' and"The Do's
and Don'ts of the English Gentry."
P.S. lam as tired of anybody
saying "RELAX!" as you are of
"played-out progressive tracks," and
according to the norms adhered to
by self-proclaimed Beautiful People
such as yourself, cute francophilic
phrases like "fres tacky" went out
with clove cigarettes.

Greetings!
The headline "Doctors make
arthritis advance" in your }uly 29
issue caught my attention. You are
to be congratulated for your
forthrightness. We've all known for
a while that modem medicine isn't
always what it's cracked up to be,
but one doesn't usually see it put
quite so bluntly.
