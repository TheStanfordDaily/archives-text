# Stop thinking, start believing
## 
### 
The uproar ensuing the Rev. Jerry Falwell's assertion
that AIDS is God's way of wreaking vengeance on the
homosexual population surprises me. I, for one, believe
that Our Lord works in many and mysterious ways
within the world today.

I he space shuttle crash, for instance, illustrates God's
contempt for NASA's belief that man could float in
outer space, warning us to avoid further space ad
ventures. And the semi-malignant pimple on Ronald
Reagan's nose signals to us, more loudly than the red
mark on Cain's forehead ever could, that someone
betrayed his brother in South Africa.
What? You don't believe me? Why, that's the reason
1 called you here today, brothers and sisters. I intend to
dispel your doubts and make you at peace with yourself
and the world surrounding you.
I've come to free you from bodily enslavement. For
your pleasure-seeking senses have provided you with a
misconceived morality. One organ 'in particular bears
responsibility for this — your brain.
You' ve been thinking too much — becoming
confused. Are you finding it difficult to decide which
TV show to turn on Sunday mornings? Does the evil of
indecision inflict your soul? Yes? Let my words cure
you, my children. It says here that you must become
like a child to gain admittance through the pearly gates.

Children don't think — do they?
Yes, yon may speak, as speech requires relatively little
thought. . . . What's that you say? I have a log in my
eye? How can that be? I see everything quite clearly —
in black and white. No shades of gray blur the lines I
paint before me. It makes for an orderly world, you see.
Note how neatly you fit between the bars — I mean
lines.
No, my designs aren't limited to a sheet of paper. I
can run lines around any three-dimensional personality.
And I've left just enough room for you. But be careful
not to move too far over there to the left. I drew an extra
thick line there. In fact, it's best if you don't move at all.
The claustrophobia won't bother you if you stop think
ing about it.

Yes, you may speak, as speech
requires relatively little
thought.

Do you have any last-minute questions before you
amble into my world, my lambs? No? It amazes me that
the queries diminish in proportion to one's mental activ
ity. It's a blessing, though, and makes my job much
easier.
Do try, on your approach, not to stray from the path.
I he Russians did, you know, and look what happened
to them at Chernobyl.
