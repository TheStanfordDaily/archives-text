## Meyer closes its doors to bats 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
I his may be the last Daily story about the bats in
Meyer Library that you'll ever read. Sad but true:
After about 17 years of peaceful habitation, the
Meyer bats have been shut out of their perennial
roost.
According to Kathy Fehrne, office manager at
Meyer, bats were first sighted in Meyer in 1969 or
1970, and at the height of their proliferation between
1972 and 1982, there were "literally hundreds and
hundreds of them." Fehrne, who has been working
at Meyer for nearly 20 years, said that last October
University Operations and Maintenance vowed
'once and for all" to attack the bat problem.

Fehrne says the exterminators used a chemical
called pyrethren. "The object was not to kill them,
but to drive them out," she said. The bats flew out,
and after the spraying the building was stopped up
with a liquid sealant. "Hopefully they're not going to
get back in," Fehrne said.
Despite their large wing spans, bats can enter
buildings through nearly any opening. Smaller
species of bats can squeeze through a three-eighths
inch space.
According to Pete Davidson of Crane Exter
minators, who assisted in the project, pyrethren is a
botanical insecticide for bugs termed ectoparasites.
Pyrethren was used to kill mites and other insects
living in the cracks of Meyer before the building was
sealed off and should not have affected the bats, he
says.
Davidson explained that, since bats are nocturnal,
the procedure was done late at night "when the bats
were out foraging." Exclusion, says Davidson, is the

only means of bat control allowed by law. Thus,
when the Meyer bats returned, they were forced to go
elsewhere, probably to the Quad.
In the past, if someone reported a bat crawling
around, library staffers would call Rose Exter
minators to catch the bat and take it away, "and they
didn't do it delicately," Fehrne added. Indeed, she
says that many students were often appalled at the
treatment of these winged mammals. "They really
were not very humane," she said.
One veteran library staffer said of the bats, "What
other creature would inhabit this ugly building?!"
Since they're blind, he said, "they have no idea how
ugly this place is."
The staffer, who asked not to be named, described
how he used to "escort" bats from the building. He
says that many bats are forced to land on the carpet
out of sheer exhaustion. Once on the ground, they
are unable to take off again, since they need some
sort of ledge from which to drop. The staffer says he
would use a newspaper to prod the grounded bat into
a plastic bag, take the bagged bat outside near a tree
and let it crawl out. The bat would then crawl up the
tree and take off.
"I really couldn't see calling the (exterminator) ser
vice," he said. "They have almost as much a right to
be in here as we do."
Like many students, the staffer misses the furry
creatures that once inhabited Meyer. "It's our unoffi
cial mascot," he said. While the bats do provide a
distraction for intense students, he said that some stu
dents and "about half the staff are terrified of bats."
"It's totally irrational. There is no need to duck un
der the loan desk." According to our resident expert,
bats are "perfectly harmless" and "they do their best
to avoid you."
Even though bats are blind, they have a
remarkable SONAR-like tracking system. According
to Biology Prof. Craig Heller, bats can avoid piano
wires strung across a dark room.
Some students also seem sad to see the bats gone.
When told of the animals' exclusion from Meyer, Li
brary Assistant Thomas Lee, a junior in chemical en
gineering, exclaimed, "Darn!" He wished the bats
would come back "because Meyer is so boring."
So why were the bats forced to find a new home?
The biggest problem is the possibility that some bats
may carry rabies. According to Bert Hildebrand,
Santa Clara Count}' animal licensing coordinator, so
far this year, a total of 233 animals (76 bats, 52 cats,
42 dogs, 31 skunks, 13 raccoons, eight foxes, three
opossums, two coyotes, two rats, two rabbits, a goph
er and a hamster) have been tested for rabies with

only three positive results — all bats.
In 1985, a total of five rabid animals
were found. All were bats except a
horse in Gilroy. Fortunately, none
of the rabid bats has been from Stan
ford.
Rabies is caused by a virus and af
fects the nervous system. Symptoms
of the disease vary from one animal
to the other, according to Hi 1 -
debrand, but typically it is expressed
via a change in temperament, rest

lessness or insecurity, convulsions,
drooling and the inability to swal
low. He said there are two types of
rabies: the classic "furious," highly
aggressive type (i.e., "Old Yeller")
and the "dumb," non-aggressive
form of rabies.
Like many other small animals,
"bats carry parasites, particularly
bedbugs. They may also carry the
bat bug (Cimex), which closely
resembles the common bedbug,"
according to a leaflet from the Uni
versity of California Division of
Agricultural Sciences.
Since last February or March,

there have been no reported hat
sightings in Meyer Library. So as
Kathv Fehrne put it, "as far as I
know, no more Meyer bats."
Though Meyer bats may be a
thing of the past, for all you die-hard
bat fans, rumor has it the Quad has
thousands of them. But a few words
of warning from Biology Prof. David
Regnery. He said bats are
"quarrelsome" creatures with "very
sharp, needle-like teeth." Students
should be very careful in handling
bats, which are usually out only at
night. "If you can pick it up, it's
probably sick," he said.

treatment of these winged mammals. "They really
were not very humane," she said.
One veteran library staffer said of the bats, "What
other creature would inhabit this ugly building?!"
Since they're blind, he said, "they have no idea how
ugly this place is."
The staffer, who asked not to be named, described
how he used to "escort" bats from the building. He
says that many bats are forced to land on the carpet
out of sheer exhaustion. Once on the ground, they
are unable to take off again, since they need some
sort of ledge from which to drop. The staffer says he
would use a newspaper to prod the grounded bat into
a plastic bag, take the bagged bat outside near a tree
and let it crawl out. The bat would then crawl up the
tree and take off.
"I really couldn't see calling the (exterminator) ser
vice," he said. "They have almost as much a right to
be in here as we do."
Like many students, the staffer misses the furry
creatures that once inhabited Meyer. "It's our unoffi
cial mascot," he said. While the bats do provide a
distraction for intense students, he said that some stu
dents and "about half the staff are terrified of bats."
"It's totally irrational. There is no need to duck un
der the loan desk." According to our resident expert,
bats are "perfectly harmless" and "they do their best
to avoid you."
Even though bats are blind, they have a
remarkable SONAR-like tracking system. According
to Biology Prof. Craig Heller, bats can avoid piano
wires strung across a dark room.
Some students also seem sad to see the bats gone.
When told of the animals' exclusion from Meyer, Li
brary Assistant Thomas Lee, a junior in chemical en
gineering, exclaimed, "Darn!" He wished the bats
would come back "because Meyer is so boring."
So why were the bats forced to find a new home?
The biggest problem is the possibility that some bats
may carry rabies. According to Bert Hildebrand,
Santa Clara Count}' animal licensing coordinator, so
far this year, a total of 233 animals (76 bats, 52 cats,
42 dogs, 31 skunks, 13 raccoons, eight foxes, three
opossums, two coyotes, two rats, two rabbits, a goph
er and a hamster) have been tested for rabies with

only three positive results — all bats.
In 1985, a total of five rabid animals
were found. All were bats except a
horse in Gilroy. Fortunately, none
of the rabid bats has been from Stan
ford.
Rabies is caused by a virus and af
fects the nervous system. Symptoms
of the disease vary from one animal
to the other, according to Hi 1 -
debrand, but typically it is expressed
via a change in temperament, rest

lessness or insecurity, convulsions,
drooling and the inability to swal
low. He said there are two types of
rabies: the classic "furious," highly
aggressive type (i.e., "Old Yeller")
and the "dumb," non-aggressive
form of rabies.
Like many other small animals,
"bats carry parasites, particularly
bedbugs. They may also carry the
bat bug (Cimex), which closely
resembles the common bedbug,"
according to a leaflet from the Uni
versity of California Division of
Agricultural Sciences.
Since last February or March,

there have been no reported hat
sightings in Meyer Library. So as
Kathv Fehrne put it, "as far as I
know, no more Meyer bats."
Though Meyer bats may be a
thing of the past, for all you die-hard
bat fans, rumor has it the Quad has
thousands of them. But a few words
of warning from Biology Prof. David
Regnery. He said bats are
"quarrelsome" creatures with "very
sharp, needle-like teeth." Students
should be very careful in handling
bats, which are usually out only at
night. "If you can pick it up, it's
probably sick," he said.
I his may be the last Daily story about the bats in
Meyer Library that you'll ever read. Sad but true:
After about 17 years of peaceful habitation, the
Meyer bats have been shut out of their perennial
roost.
According to Kathy Fehrne, office manager at
Meyer, bats were first sighted in Meyer in 1969 or
1970, and at the height of their proliferation between
1972 and 1982, there were "literally hundreds and
hundreds of them." Fehrne, who has been working
at Meyer for nearly 20 years, said that last October
University Operations and Maintenance vowed
'once and for all" to attack the bat problem.

Fehrne says the exterminators used a chemical
called pyrethren. "The object was not to kill them,
but to drive them out," she said. The bats flew out,
and after the spraying the building was stopped up
with a liquid sealant. "Hopefully they're not going to
get back in," Fehrne said.
Despite their large wing spans, bats can enter
buildings through nearly any opening. Smaller
species of bats can squeeze through a three-eighths
inch space.
According to Pete Davidson of Crane Exter
minators, who assisted in the project, pyrethren is a
botanical insecticide for bugs termed ectoparasites.
Pyrethren was used to kill mites and other insects
living in the cracks of Meyer before the building was
sealed off and should not have affected the bats, he
says.
Davidson explained that, since bats are nocturnal,
the procedure was done late at night "when the bats
were out foraging." Exclusion, says Davidson, is the

only means of bat control allowed by law. Thus,
when the Meyer bats returned, they were forced to go
elsewhere, probably to the Quad.
In the past, if someone reported a bat crawling
around, library staffers would call Rose Exter
minators to catch the bat and take it away, "and they
didn't do it delicately," Fehrne added. Indeed, she
says that many students were often appalled at the
treatment of these winged mammals. "They really
were not very humane," she said.
