# Bach scores in Carmel
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
In any place but Carmel, it just
wouldn't have worked.
What Bach had in mind for the
courts and cathedrals of Leipzig,
Maestro Sandor Salgo and an all-star
group of white-jacketed musicians
brought it to the balmy summer
evenings of Monterey Bay this sum
mer.
And it was OK that the audience
could hear crickets singing outside
the walls of the Sunset Center. It
was somehow fitting that the theater
had more in common with a
high school gym than a great concert
hall. It was all right that concert
goers brought their own wine and
cookies tQ fetch from their car trunks
at the intermissions. It wasn't a
problem when 2,000 people simul
taneously turned the pages of their
programs to follow the words of the
oratorio, the Passion According to
St. John.
It was summer, and it was Car
mel, where would-be Europeans sell
gas by the liter but still elect an ail-
American cowboy mayor. The same
odd combination of sophistication
and informality made the 49th Car
mel Bach Festival a unique and un
forgettable three weeks.
What began July 16 with high
lights from Johann Sebastian Bach's
Mass in B minor ended Sunday with

the equally uplifting St. John's Pas
sion. The versatile orchestra and
chorus also performed several J.S.
Bach cantatas and the Brandenburg
Concerto No. 2, Mozart's Piano
Concerto in C and the opera "The
Marriage of Figaro," works by
Vivaldi, Handel and C.P.E. Bach
and the "Italian'' Symphony of Felix
Mendelssohn, who in the early
1800s revived J.S. Bach's works
from a century of neglect.

. . . the music mat
tered more than the
place and the time.

It sounds like a lineup of time
tested masterpieces, but Salgo's
group of musicians and a chorus di
rected by his wife Priscilla gave them
new life in the new environment.
For a few moments — especially
when the orchestra played Bach's
hauntingly smooth air from the
Suite in C as an encore to last
Friday's performance — the music
mattered more than the place and
the time. The crickets belonged,
and no one cared whether anyone
else was sporting the latest fashion.
It was a good sign for the music that,
when the high-brow stuff of the

usual symphony crowd was
removed, what was left was untar
nished and thoroughly engrossing.
Bach may never have intended to
have his music played in the wilds of
California, but the natural beauty of
the Carmel area makes the festival a
24-hour-a-day journey into the
wonderful. Walks on the beach are
just minutes from most of the area's
numerous hotels, and the Big Sur
coastal area lies just to the south. A
40-minute drive to the south along
winding Highway 1 holds more
spectacular views of the ocean, mul
ticolored wildflowers and sea birds
than there are notes in Bach's most
ambitious work.
Point Lobos State Park, for
travelers who would rather stick
closer to Carmel, offers all that on a
slightly smaller scale. It's easy,
though, to sit on the rocky point for
hours watching the wild surf, the sea
lions and the otters playing and —
in the winter — the whales passing
by.
For the newcomer, Carmel itself
needs no great introduction. Its
preppy shops, million-dollar seaside
homes, grossly overpriced restau
rants and residents that are willing to
pay for all this have been immor
talized in travel books by the dozen.
Fortunately, there are hotels and
restaurants in the surrounding towns
of Monterey, Seaside and Pacific
Grove — hotels and restaurants

more suited to the college student's
budget.
These surrounding towns offer
travelers the opportunity to sleep
and eat elsewhere while periodically
dropping by Carmel's posh Ocean
Avenue just long enough to savor its
truly exceptional attractions — like
the festival — and leave before be
coming sick of pink and green pants,
miniature patisseries and Mercedes.

Whether you like Carmel or not,
however, the town's unique ap
proach to Bach's music made the
festival a success. Some of the per
formances were sold out before the
festival even began, and the lengthy
standing ovation at the conclusion
of the final performance Sunday
means more great Baroque music to
come when the festival celebrates its
50th anniversary next summer.

problem when 2,000 people simul
taneously turned the pages of their
programs to follow the words of the
oratorio, the Passion According to
St. John.
It was summer, and it was Car
mel, where would-be Europeans sell
gas by the liter but still elect an ail-
American cowboy mayor. The same
odd combination of sophistication
and informality made the 49th Car
mel Bach Festival a unique and un
forgettable three weeks.
What began July 16 with high
lights from Johann Sebastian Bach's
Mass in B minor ended Sunday with

the equally uplifting St. John's Pas
sion. The versatile orchestra and
chorus also performed several J.S.
Bach cantatas and the Brandenburg
Concerto No. 2, Mozart's Piano
Concerto in C and the opera "The
Marriage of Figaro," works by
Vivaldi, Handel and C.P.E. Bach
and the "Italian'' Symphony of Felix
Mendelssohn, who in the early
1800s revived J.S. Bach's works
from a century of neglect.

. . . the music mat
tered more than the
place and the time.

It sounds like a lineup of time
tested masterpieces, but Salgo's
group of musicians and a chorus di
rected by his wife Priscilla gave them
new life in the new environment.
For a few moments — especially
when the orchestra played Bach's
hauntingly smooth air from the
Suite in C as an encore to last
Friday's performance — the music
mattered more than the place and
the time. The crickets belonged,
and no one cared whether anyone
else was sporting the latest fashion.
It was a good sign for the music that,
when the high-brow stuff of the

usual symphony crowd was
removed, what was left was untar
nished and thoroughly engrossing.
Bach may never have intended to
have his music played in the wilds of
California, but the natural beauty of
the Carmel area makes the festival a
24-hour-a-day journey into the
wonderful. Walks on the beach are
just minutes from most of the area's
numerous hotels, and the Big Sur
coastal area lies just to the south. A
40-minute drive to the south along
winding Highway 1 holds more
spectacular views of the ocean, mul
ticolored wildflowers and sea birds
than there are notes in Bach's most
ambitious work.
Point Lobos State Park, for
travelers who would rather stick
closer to Carmel, offers all that on a
slightly smaller scale. It's easy,
though, to sit on the rocky point for
hours watching the wild surf, the sea
lions and the otters playing and —
in the winter — the whales passing
by.
For the newcomer, Carmel itself
needs no great introduction. Its
preppy shops, million-dollar seaside
homes, grossly overpriced restau
rants and residents that are willing to
pay for all this have been immor
talized in travel books by the dozen.
Fortunately, there are hotels and
restaurants in the surrounding towns
of Monterey, Seaside and Pacific
Grove — hotels and restaurants

more suited to the college student's
budget.
These surrounding towns offer
travelers the opportunity to sleep
and eat elsewhere while periodically
dropping by Carmel's posh Ocean
Avenue just long enough to savor its
truly exceptional attractions — like
the festival — and leave before be
coming sick of pink and green pants,
miniature patisseries and Mercedes.

Whether you like Carmel or not,
however, the town's unique ap
proach to Bach's music made the
festival a success. Some of the per
formances were sold out before the
festival even began, and the lengthy
standing ovation at the conclusion
of the final performance Sunday
means more great Baroque music to
come when the festival celebrates its
50th anniversary next summer.
