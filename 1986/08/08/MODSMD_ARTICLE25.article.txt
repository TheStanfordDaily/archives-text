# From Blatz to Mickey D's, it's cold ice cream

Ice cream is a very personal thing. People
are very particular about what flavors they like,
and what flavors they hate. And most people
have a favorite ice cream parlor where they
habitually fulfill that special ice crcam
craving. There are so many places to get ice
cream around Stanford that we decided to sur
vey these bastions of hedonism — to find the
best and the worst, and the in-between.
According to ice cream scoopers Nicho
Ashley and Jen Zelikson, Swensen's offers at
least 41 flavors of ice cream every day. And it
is probably to this great variety of flavors that
Swensen's owes its success.
My friend and I started with vanilla and
agreed that Swensen's vanilla was not as
smooth and creamy as most store-bought ice
creams. It reminded me of the ice cream
found inside Eskimo Pies. It lacked a distinct

vanilla taste and should have been richer and
creamier. My friend, however, enjoyed the
"light" flavor and texture and found it a pleas
ant reprieve from the usually heavier vanilla
ice creams. I found Swensen's old-fashioned
vanilla to be a vast improvement over the reg
ular genre.
The Bittersweet Dark Chocolate was rich
tasting and definitely a chocoholic's dream. It
was so good and rich that it would have been
my favorite, except I couldn't imagine eating a
whole scoop of it. Pecan Praline was also ex
cellent. It had delicious sugar-glazed pecans
suspended in a rich, vanilla caramel-flavored
ice cream.
One fabulous sounding flavor that caught
my attention was Chocolate Raspberry
Truffle. Much to my dismay, it resembled or
dinary raspberry jam, complete with seeds,
swirled into ordinary chocolate ice cream.
Similarly, the strawberry ice cream appeared
to be strawberry jam swirled into pink,

strawberry-flavored ice cream. And despite its
obnoxious, dark yellow color, the Lemon
Custard was also qifite good.
My friend's favorite was Minted Mocha
Chocolate, a chewy, chocolate flavor with a
bit of dark roasted coffee flavor and just
enough mint to complement, but not over
power, the ice cream. I preferred the Pecan
Praline.
The prices are reasonable for the better ice
creams: 90 cents for a single scoop and $1.75
for a double. Be sure to taste first — names
(i.e., Chocolate Raspberry Truffle) and ap
pearances (i.e., Lemon Custard) can be
deceiving. The portions are generous, but not
huge — about 5 ounces per scoop. The variety
of flavors at Swensen's offers something for
everyone and it is conveniently located by the
New Varsity Theater in downtown Palo Alto.
Blatz's specialty is "folded ice cream." For
example, one can order chopped Snickers bars
folded into mocha chip ice cream, or Heath

bar pieces folded into praline ice cream, or
Gummie Bears folded in strawberry, or
M&M's in vanilla. . . . Whatever the combi
nation, Blatz will custom fold the ice cream of
your choice with any of their many candies,
cookies and other toppings.
Folded ice cream is a novel idea with lots of
potential. However, there are a few problems
with it. For instance, the Snickers pieces
became so frozen that it was difficult to chew
them. The Almond Joy pieces had a similar
problem and tended to stick annoyingly to my
teeth. The dreaded "extreme sweetness" was
also a problem in several of the combinations.
Though the ice cream at Blatz is not as
thick and rich as Bud's or Double Rainbow's,
it seems very appropriate for folding. The
quality of the ice cream is comparable to
Swensen's. Peppermint seems to be a top fa
vorite at Blatz. Blatz folded ice cream is
