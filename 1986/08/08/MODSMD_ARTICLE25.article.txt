# From Blatz to Mickey D's, it's cold ice cream

Ice cream is a very personal thing. People
are very particular about what flavors they like,
and what flavors they hate. And most people
have a favorite ice cream parlor where they
habitually fulfill that special ice crcam
craving. There are so many places to get ice
cream around Stanford that we decided to sur
vey these bastions of hedonism — to find the
best and the worst, and the in-between.
According to ice cream scoopers Nicho
Ashley and Jen Zelikson, Swensen's offers at
least 41 flavors of ice cream every day. And it
is probably to this great variety of flavors that
Swensen's owes its success.
My friend and I started with vanilla and
agreed that Swensen's vanilla was not as
smooth and creamy as most store-bought ice
creams. It reminded me of the ice cream
found inside Eskimo Pies. It lacked a distinct

vanilla taste and should have been richer and
creamier. My friend, however, enjoyed the
"light" flavor and texture and found it a pleas
ant reprieve from the usually heavier vanilla
ice creams. I found Swensen's old-fashioned
vanilla to be a vast improvement over the reg
ular genre.
The Bittersweet Dark Chocolate was rich
tasting and definitely a chocoholic's dream. It
was so good and rich that it would have been
my favorite, except I couldn't imagine eating a
whole scoop of it. Pecan Praline was also ex
cellent. It had delicious sugar-glazed pecans
suspended in a rich, vanilla caramel-flavored
ice cream.
One fabulous sounding flavor that caught
my attention was Chocolate Raspberry
Truffle. Much to my dismay, it resembled or
dinary raspberry jam, complete with seeds,
swirled into ordinary chocolate ice cream.
Similarly, the strawberry ice cream appeared
to be strawberry jam swirled into pink,

strawberry-flavored ice cream. And despite its
obnoxious, dark yellow color, the Lemon
Custard was also qifite good.
My friend's favorite was Minted Mocha
Chocolate, a chewy, chocolate flavor with a
bit of dark roasted coffee flavor and just
enough mint to complement, but not over
power, the ice cream. I preferred the Pecan
Praline.
The prices are reasonable for the better ice
creams: 90 cents for a single scoop and $1.75
for a double. Be sure to taste first — names
(i.e., Chocolate Raspberry Truffle) and ap
pearances (i.e., Lemon Custard) can be
deceiving. The portions are generous, but not
huge — about 5 ounces per scoop. The variety
of flavors at Swensen's offers something for
everyone and it is conveniently located by the
New Varsity Theater in downtown Palo Alto.
Blatz's specialty is "folded ice cream." For
example, one can order chopped Snickers bars
folded into mocha chip ice cream, or Heath

bar pieces folded into praline ice cream, or
Gummie Bears folded in strawberry, or
M&M's in vanilla. . . . Whatever the combi
nation, Blatz will custom fold the ice cream of
your choice with any of their many candies,
cookies and other toppings.
Folded ice cream is a novel idea with lots of
potential. However, there are a few problems
with it. For instance, the Snickers pieces
became so frozen that it was difficult to chew
them. The Almond Joy pieces had a similar
problem and tended to stick annoyingly to my
teeth. The dreaded "extreme sweetness" was
also a problem in several of the combinations.
Though the ice cream at Blatz is not as
thick and rich as Bud's or Double Rainbow's,
it seems very appropriate for folding. The
quality of the ice cream is comparable to
Swensen's. Peppermint seems to be a top fa
vorite at Blatz. Blatz folded ice cream is
available in waffle cups, which I
thought were the best part of this ice
crearn novelty. The single scoop size
is fairly huge, but then the price of
$1.60 for a small is rather steep to
match. A double costs $2.35, but
the single is probably enough to fill
up most people.
And then there's the ice cream
magic of the Golden Arches.
Hamburgers and fries aside, you can
buy an ice cream sundae for less
than a dollar (59 cents to be exact),
choosing from among the likes of
hot fudge, strawberry and hot
caramel over vanilla soft serve ice
cream, with or without chopped
peanuts.
Standing in line, I noticed the
cardboard stand-up illustration
portraying a clear plastic cup filled
with vast quantities of ice cream
swirled together with dark chocolate
fudge. Clearly the big, dome top was
necessary to contain the mountain
of whipped cream covering this
sundae for which one would expect
to pay at least $1.50.
Well as they say, you get what
you pay for, and for 59 cents plus
tax, that's not much. Compared to
the size of its attractive container,
the portion we received was quite
small. The purpose of the dome top
was no longer apparent.
The terms "hot fudge" and "hot

caramel" were misnomers. Both
were tepid puddles layered atop the
rapidly melting ice cream. The hot
fudge sauce resembled a mixture of
chocolate syrup and over-cooked
chocolate pudding. The caramel
was a little better, even reasonably
good.
Unfortunately, the slight warmth
of these toppings caused the thin,
milky soft-serve ice cream to turn
quickly into a bland, opaque liquid I
could not bring myself to consume.
A friend summed up the experi
ence rather well, "It tastes like what
you'd expect from McD's." For 59
cents, what you do get is not unrea
sonable. But for the same amount,
one could instead order fries.
Saving the best for last, Double
Rainbow of Menlo Park offers the
best tasting ice cream in the area.
Not only does Double Rainbow of
fer the freshest and creamiest ice
creams around but the most innova
tive flavors as well.
The consistency of Double Rain
bow ice cream is more a cross be
tween ice cream and gelato rather
than either one alone. The three
kinds of sherbet are definitely more
like sorbet (frozen fruit puree) than
typical sherbet. All 32 flavors are
made in San Francisco at their Van
Ness .shop and are delivered weekly
to Menlo Park.
Dave Horn, manager of Double
Rainbow, said that Double Rainbow
uses no artificial colors in their ice
cream.

am particularly grateful that the
lemon sherbet is a pale cream color,
in contrast to Swensen's marigold
Lemon Custard.
Double Rainbow also offers an
other flavor Swensen's would be
wise to emulate. Double Rainbow's
Chocolate Raspberry is likely to be
what Swensen's tried and failed to
create. The Rainbow version is a
chewy chocolate ice cream swirled
with a tart raspberry puree. Horn
says this seedy puree is actually the
pulp that is filtered off in making the
raspberry sherbet.
Scooper Bruce recommends his
favorite flavor, white pistachio. "It's
sweet, but not disgustingly sweet,"
he said.
His fellow scooper Bill says he is
"torn between ultra-chocolate and
lemon." I thought the lemon was on
the strong side and a bit too tangy.
Other notable flavors that are all
quite good include: amaretto fudge,
Dutch almond chocolate, mango,
coffee bean, blueberry, vanilla,
lychee fruit, peanut butter, choco
late, butter almond and strawberry.
The small 4.5 ounce size is
$1.30. The 6.5 ounce mediums are
$1.80, and the 8 ounce larges are
$2.30 a clip. Though Double Rain
bow is not within walking distance
of the campus, it's definitely worth it
to ride your bike or to grab a friend
with a car. The ice cream is great,
the service is friendly, and a rain
bow, if nothing else, lights up the
sidewalk when you go at night.
