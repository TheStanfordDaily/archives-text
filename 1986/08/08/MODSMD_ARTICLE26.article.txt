## For better or worse, here come the Dodgers 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Everything had been going pretty
well for me this summer. The job
was hectic, but entertaining. The
weather was beautiful, as usual. In
short, a pretty relaxing couple of
months.
But something vital was missing
from my life, and I was reminded of
that fact every day as I read the
baseball box scores in the morning
paper. My beloved Dodgers were
floundering in last place in the Na
tional League Western Division.
I was confused. "The Dodgers
aren't supposed to be in last place," I
would think to myself as I endured
yet another sleepless night.
I was embarrassed. "The Giants
in first place," I cried. "I'll never live
this one down."
At first, I opted to go to an eye
doctor. "Surely my eyes must be
deceiving me," I told the doctor.
"What I'm seeing on TV can't be
true. All those errors. All those
strikeouts."
My vision, I was assured, was per
fect. Upon realizing that what I was
witnessing was not a hoax, I almost

gave up on the Boys in Blue. But at
that very instant, I started experienc
ing flashbacks. 1982 . . . The
Dodgers reduce a 10-game deficit in
August and come within a game of
winning the division. 1983 . . . Los
Angeles erases a similar deficit and
this time captures the N.L. West
crown.
1 ommy Lasorda had often spoken
of the existence of "The Great
Dodger in the Sky," but I had never
believed him. The flashbacks,
however, made a believer out of me.
1 he Great Dodger" had called me
and instnicted me to keep the faith.
I felt rejuvenated. The sparkle was
back in my eyes. And most impor
tantly, I ardently began to root for
the Dodgers again. My enthusiasm
paid immediate dividends. The
Dodgers swept the (ughh!) Giants in
Los Angeles and have been on a roll
ever since.
I know that I am writing for an
anti-Dodger audience in the Bay
Area, so I will gladly make a predic
tion that will infuriate you all . . .
The Big Blue Wrecking Crew will
move past the Giants within a week
and will set its sights on the Astros.
Houston will be caught before the
end of the month.
The reasoning is clear. The
Dodgers have the best starting pitch
ing in the major leagues, and it is fi
nally starting to show. Fernando
Valenzuela never gets the publicity
of Dwight Gooden or Roger
Clemens, but he continues to baffle
opposing hitters. And Orel Her
shiser and Alejandro Pena appear to
be back on track, though Pena is still
somewhat of a question mark.
Also, the Dodgers certainly have
the best manager of the competing
teams. Lasorda is ridiculed for a va
rietv of reasons, most notably his

"Hollywood" image and his physical
girth. Yet, what is lost in all of the
joking is the fact that he is a tremen
dous manager. He's a great
motivator; he has experience in pen
nant races.
Ihe fact is that the Dodgers are
year-in and year-out one of the best
teams in baseball. They play in a
great stadium in optimal weather
conditions before record-setting fans
under a flamboyant and effective
manager. In addition, they are the
only sports organization ever to be
listed under "The 100 best organiza
tions to work for in the United
States."
The list goes on, and I'd love to
write more. But I need to go send in
my order form for playoff tickets. I
guess you Giant fans wouldn't un
derstand.
