## For better or worse, here come the Dodgers 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Everything had been going pretty
well for me this summer. The job
was hectic, but entertaining. The
weather was beautiful, as usual. In
short, a pretty relaxing couple of
months.
But something vital was missing
from my life, and I was reminded of
that fact every day as I read the
baseball box scores in the morning
paper. My beloved Dodgers were
floundering in last place in the Na
tional League Western Division.
I was confused. "The Dodgers
aren't supposed to be in last place," I
would think to myself as I endured
yet another sleepless night.
I was embarrassed. "The Giants
in first place," I cried. "I'll never live
this one down."
At first, I opted to go to an eye
doctor. "Surely my eyes must be
deceiving me," I told the doctor.
"What I'm seeing on TV can't be
true. All those errors. All those
strikeouts."
My vision, I was assured, was per
fect. Upon realizing that what I was
witnessing was not a hoax, I almost

gave up on the Boys in Blue. But at
that very instant, I started experienc
ing flashbacks. 1982 . . . The
Dodgers reduce a 10-game deficit in
August and come within a game of
winning the division. 1983 . . . Los
Angeles erases a similar deficit and
this time captures the N.L. West
crown.
1 ommy Lasorda had often spoken
of the existence of "The Great
Dodger in the Sky," but I had never
believed him. The flashbacks,
however, made a believer out of me.
1 he Great Dodger" had called me
and instnicted me to keep the faith.
I felt rejuvenated. The sparkle was
back in my eyes. And most impor
tantly, I ardently began to root for
the Dodgers again. My enthusiasm
paid immediate dividends. The
Dodgers swept the (ughh!) Giants in
Los Angeles and have been on a roll
ever since.
I know that I am writing for an
anti-Dodger audience in the Bay
Area, so I will gladly make a predic
tion that will infuriate you all . . .
The Big Blue Wrecking Crew will
move past the Giants within a week
