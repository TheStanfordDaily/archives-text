Ken, you raging ignoramus. Set
your California Cooler down and
join the rest of us within the friendly
confines of reality.
Let's face it, Ken, no one likes the
Los Angeles Dodgers — plain and
simple. I don't like them; Mr.
Rogers doesn't like them; Kukla,
Fran and Ollie can't stand them.
Ken, we want only to help you.
How does one aid someone as
despondent and deranged as Ken? Is
it possible to cure this fine young
chap of what we will refer to as
Dodgerexia, a disease of such stag
gering magnitude that few medical
journals will bother to document it?
Tragically, the malady probably
hit Ken when he was just a young,
squalid little gerbil. Gradually
through the years (oh the horror),
this psychological killer methodi

Ken's brain until little remained.
Today, Ken has the intellectual
worth of a Chicken McNugget.
But together, through counsel
and understanding, we can help
restore Ken's cerebral capacity at

least to that of a fresh head of lettuce
— his original state.
To start, we must show Ken some
of the awful causes of Dodgerexia
that have maimed his mind since
birth. Later, we may venture a possi

we care.
As stated, many factors contribute
to this affliction, and researchers
today are only now beginning to
scratch the surface of this baseball
behemoth. Some things, though,
have been known for a long time.
Garveiitus, a primitive slime
mold isolated some years ago, has
been acknowledged as the first and
premiere contributer to the dreaded
disease.
OK ? settle down, Ken, get back
to your bed and chew on some bark.
I realize that Garvey is no longer
playing for your beloved So-Cal out
fit, but like week-old spam, the resi
due truly lives on.
After Garveiitus, came Lasorda
itch. Lasorda, very much akin to a
large ravioli, has dazzled the
baseball world not only with his
ability to imitate a puffer fish, but
