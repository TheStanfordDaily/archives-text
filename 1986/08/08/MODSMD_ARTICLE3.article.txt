# Ferruolo to get tenure rehearing
## Profs, discuss tenure criteria 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
Assistant Prof. Stephen Ferruolo,
who was denied tenure in a January
meeting of the History Department,
has been given another chance be
cause of an ambiguity in Stanford's
new tenure review policy.
A grievance officer found that a
new rule requiring comparison of a
tenure candidate's work to that of
foremost scholars in his field had
been too stringently applied when a
tenure review committee evaluated
Ferruolo. The officer. Political Sci
ence Prof. Gabriel Almond, also
found that the committee did not so
licit letters from Stanford medieval
scholars in other departments, a pro
cedure required by the University's
guidelines.
A new tenure evaluation commit
tee will be organized and a new let
ter consistent with the criteria out
lined in the 1984 Faculty Handbook
will be drawn up to send to both ex
ternal and internal referees when the
department reconsiders his can

didacy in the fall, Ferruolo said.
The ruling that his request for
tenure should be re-evaluated is "a
fair and reasonable decision," said
Ferruolo, though he added that it is
impossible to predict the outcome of
the rehearing.
Ferruolo said he was denied ten
ure because of shortcomings the
committee found in his scholarship,
the area that would be most affected
by a re-evaluation under the old
rules. He filed a grievance with the
History Department in May. In such
cases, an independent officer is ap
pointed to evaluate the grievance.
In April 1985, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Norm
Wessells issued a memorandum al
tering the criteria for gaining tenure
outlined in the 1984 handbook. The
new guidelines stress that referees
evaluating a tenure candidate must
ask themselves, "How does the can
didate compare with the field's intel
lectual leaders today and at compa
rable stages of those persons'
careers?" Wessells' document says.
The new policy requires referees
to compare candidates to two pools
of scholars in their fields — those at
a comparable level of professional
development and those at the very
top of their field. The former criteria
called specifically for comparison
only to a candidate's contem
poraries.
The 1984 Faculty Handbook says
a candidate's strengths and weaknes
ses must be evaluated "relative to
others of recognized excellence in
the same field and at a similar level
of development." Tenure review
committees "should insist upon
comparisons with the very best of
the candidate's peers," the book
continues.
At the time he issued the revised
criteria, Wessells said the new stan
dard was a clarification of the exist
ing policy, but the grievance offi
cer's ruling suggests that the modifi

cation constituted a substantial
change that was applied unfairly in
Ferruolo's case, History Prof. Gavin
Langmuir said.
Ferruolo said he wasn't aware un
til after the department's denial of
tenure that he had been evaluated
according to the new criteria.
"People were denying that there
had been changes (in the criteria),"
Ferruolo said. "But it was the first
time any junior faculty members
knew what was meant in the dean's
memo."
Ferruolo called the committee's
failure to solicit letters from other
Stanford medieval scholars an
"oversight" that will be corrected in
the fall.
Besides being unclear, the new
tenure criteria were also inconsis
tently applied, Ferruolo said. A pro
fessor from another university who
was considered for a position here
after Ferruolo's denial was evaluated
according to the old criteria, he said.
"Almond found the criteria were
new and had been applied more
stringently in my case," Ferruolo

said. "He said Stanford has the right
to change its criteria, but I was not
given sufficient notice."
Almond refused to comment on
the case.
"It was unclear how the new
criteria would work," Ferruolo said.
"When you're asking for a new sort
of comparison (from external
scholars), it's very difficult to know
what effect it will have on the
referees. The criteria were unclear
to me, to the letter writers, to other
faculty members, to the depart
ment. "
Ferruolo, whose appointment
will expire next June if he is denied
tenure again, said his case was the
first time in the History Department
and probably the first time in
Humanities and Sciences that a can
didate was compared to the two
comparison pools.
Wessells, however, intended that
the new criteria go into effect imme
diately after the tenure paper was
issued, according to Catherine Gil
lam, assistant to the dean for faculty
affairs.
"We were operating on the as
sumption that all candidates coming
up for tenure at that time (that the
memorandum was issued) would
come under the new criteria," said
Gillam, adding that she was not
familiar with the specifics of Fer
ruolo's case since her office only
reviews tenure approvals. She said
the dean intended all tenure reviews
in the 1985-1986 school year to be
subject to the new standard, which
the dean considers fair and clear.
"There have been no complaints
from referees about the criteria, and
it hasn't been an issue in any other
cases," Gillam said. "The criteria
are pretty clear. . . . It's not an issue
of old vs. new."
Some faculty members, however,
see the new criteria as Stanford's at
tempt to boost its reputation at the
expense of junior faculty members
like Ferruolo.
"In general, upping the require
ments for tenure at Stanford is con
sistent with Stanford's desire to be
number one," Political Science
Prof. John Manley said. "What it
represents is a further step in the im
balance already favoring publica
tion."
Manley said the new criteria rep
resent another "tightening of the

vice" in the escalating trend to pres
sure professors to publish in order to
make Stanford the nation's top
ranked university.
"Competition and the rank order
ing _ an d the rewards that flow
from those — are so incredibly in
tense and the pressure is always in
creasing. And that's what junior pro
fessors are up against. It's a marked
escalation in the trend of the Uni
versity to place publication over
long-term teaching and research in
terests," he said, reasoning that the
University only wants to give tenure
to those who will bring acclaim to
the University through their
publications.
"If I were a junior professor at
Stanford, I would certainly cast an
interested eye (at the outcome of the
Ferruolo case),'' Manley said.
Ferruolo said his case has impor
tant implications for all junior fac
ulty members, who are facing an in
creasingly tougher challenge in
gaining tenure. It remains unclear
exactly how the new comparison
criteria work, he said.
History Prof. Carl Degler said it is
not unusual for a university to
change its policy, "but what makes it
difficult is when it's confusing to the
candidate." Degler was less sure,
however, that junior faculty mem
bers are threatened by toughening
tenure criteria.
"I do not think this particular case
has made [junior faculty members]
feel in a more difficult situation,"
