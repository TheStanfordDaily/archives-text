# Ferruolo to get tenure rehearing
## Profs, discuss tenure criteria 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
Assistant Prof. Stephen Ferruolo,
who was denied tenure in a January
meeting of the History Department,
has been given another chance be
cause of an ambiguity in Stanford's
new tenure review policy.
A grievance officer found that a
new rule requiring comparison of a
tenure candidate's work to that of
foremost scholars in his field had
been too stringently applied when a
tenure review committee evaluated
Ferruolo. The officer. Political Sci
ence Prof. Gabriel Almond, also
found that the committee did not so
licit letters from Stanford medieval
scholars in other departments, a pro
cedure required by the University's
guidelines.
A new tenure evaluation commit
tee will be organized and a new let
ter consistent with the criteria out
lined in the 1984 Faculty Handbook
will be drawn up to send to both ex
ternal and internal referees when the
department reconsiders his can

didacy in the fall, Ferruolo said.
The ruling that his request for
tenure should be re-evaluated is "a
fair and reasonable decision," said
Ferruolo, though he added that it is
impossible to predict the outcome of
the rehearing.
Ferruolo said he was denied ten
ure because of shortcomings the
committee found in his scholarship,
the area that would be most affected
by a re-evaluation under the old
rules. He filed a grievance with the
History Department in May. In such
cases, an independent officer is ap
pointed to evaluate the grievance.
In April 1985, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Norm
Wessells issued a memorandum al
tering the criteria for gaining tenure
outlined in the 1984 handbook. The
new guidelines stress that referees
evaluating a tenure candidate must
ask themselves, "How does the can
didate compare with the field's intel
lectual leaders today and at compa
rable stages of those persons'
