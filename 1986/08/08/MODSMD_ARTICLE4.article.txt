# Animal research report released, sparks outcry

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Editorial staff 
The Stanford Medical Center Ethics Com
mittee recently issued a report on the use of
animals in research at Stanford, supporting
the principle of "humane treatment, a princi
ple which places an obligation on humans to
prevent animals from suffering."
The report states that "the moral status of
animals is the subject of a heated debate, char
acterized by widely divergent views. There is,
however, a moderate position which ascribes
great moral worth to animals but allows them
to be used for research under certain condi
tions. Such a view is based on the principle of
humane treatment."
According to University Librarian Lise
Giraud, an animal rights activist, the report,
"Animal Research at Stanford University:
Principles, Policies and Practices," is "the
same sort of mixture of lies and half truths the
Medical Center has been promulgating

throughout."
The report is the result of "calm, thoughtful
deliberation," according to Dr. Thomas Raf
fin, associate professor of medicine and chair
man of the Med Center Ethics Committee.
Giraud said the Ethics Committee is
"stacked." Members, who are appointed by
University President Donald Kennedy, are
there because they are "not going to muddy
the waters." Not one member is an animal
rights advocate, she said.
Raffin said the committee takes a middle
road between animal rights activists and those
who care nothing about the ethics of animal
research. According to Raffin, people came to
speak to the committee "on both sides." For
example, the 30-member committee viewed
tapes of the Pittsburgh lab known for its in
humane treatment of animals used by animal
rights activists.
"We should take their side seriously," he
said.
The report states that "the principle of

humane treatment applied to laboratory
animals requires, at minimum, the prohibi
tion of unnecessary pain and suffering."
It cites "at least five separate kinds of regula
tions ... to protect research animals from
mistreatment. The Federal Government,
some state governments, an independent ac
creditation organization, professional
societies, and individual institutions. ..."
The report also states that any research ex
periment proposed using animals as subjects
must be "approved by several levels of review."
The researcher must prove that alternative
methods of research were reviewed and could
not be used successfully.
Giraud said she does not "believe for a mo
ment that very elaborate safeguards are used to
preserve every rat and mouse." She said that
these animals are viewed by researchers as
"throwaway animals."
"To give the impression that there are strin
gent safeguards is . . . a lie," she added.
Kim Sturla, director of Society Services at

the Peninsula Humane Soeiety, said she ques
tioned the "regulations" referred to by the
committee. Sturla said researchers are asked
to follow "guidelines, not laws." In addition,
"all researchers are exempt from California
anti-cruelty laws. I'hey can do whatever they
want," she said.
The only existing federal law is the Animal
Welfare Act, she said. It does "nothing to con
trol any aspect of research." Sturla said it deals
with the size of cages and topics of that nature.
Giraud equated the conditions in which the
animals live with a "concentration camp."
The report also cited examples such as the
1953 polio vaccine, cancer and heart disease
treatment as prime examples of how animal
research has led to lifesaving discoveries for
both humans and animals. Giraud said prog
ress in fighting these ailments is a result of ad
vances in preventative measures, like nutrition
and fitness, which are not the result of animal
research.
The report also listed four ques
tions that investigators must ask
themselves before starting any re
search that might use animals as
subjects:
• Have I sought for or tried to
develop methods that obviate the
use of any animals?
• Am I proposing to use an appro
priate species of animal?
• Does my protocol project the
using of the fewest numbers of
animals?
• Is my proposed use of animals in
accord with the principle of humane
treatment?
Giraud added what she said was

the real question: " 'Can I get a
grant for this?' That is the overriding
question."
Sturla said she is not convinced
that the Ethics Committee always
has the animals' best interests in
mind. She said she challenges the
Medical Center to prove otherwise
by letting an animal rights advocate
on the committee and to open its
doors.
"Stanford is not moving with that
wave of full disclosure," she said.
"How am I to judge if everything
is being done correctly? We are not
going to get anywhere with this
dialogue back and forth via the
press,'' Sturla added.
Sturla and Giraud both cited
animals used in psychological re
search and in teaching as examples
of "abused" animals.
