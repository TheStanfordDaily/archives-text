# Berkeley stuffed bear bagged out of season
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
Despite a radio station's $500 "no
questions ' reward, Berkeley police
have no leads in the disappearance
of the famed UC-Berkeley bear last
weekend, according to the chair of
the committee in charge of the
stuffed mammal.
"It's a bummer to lose something
like this,' said Tina Hoppe, chair of
the UC Rally Committee. "I want
the bear back. "
Because of its 94-year Big Game
rivalry with Berkeley, Stanford is
considered by many to be a prime
suspect in the bear-.lapping.

But Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington said he doesn't "think it
has anything to do with Stanford.
My advice (to Berkeley police) w as to
look closer to home."
Berkeley police have asked Stan
ford police to "keep an eye open" for
the bear, Herri ngton said.
According to the Times Tribune,
Stanford police are treating the inci
dent as a felony theft.
The symbol of the school mascot,
which stands about 7 feet tall
and weighs about 200 pounds, was
taken from its case in the Berkeley
student union sometime between
the building's closing Saturday night
and its opening Sunday morning,
according to Hoppe.
Only an "Animal on Board''
sticker was left in the case, she
added.
No signs of forced entry were de
tected, Hoppe said. "We're not
really sure how the bear was taken,
since there are two separate locks on
the case and only one key,'' she ex
plained.
San Francisco radio station KGO,
which broadcasts Berkeley football
games, has offered a $500 reward for
the bear's return, said KGO
publicist Pam Hamilton. "I regret to
say that we have not received any

leads yet."
She added that suspicion
"naturally turned to Stanford be
cause there's such a healthy compe
tition between the two schools; that
lends itself to pranksterism."
The suspicion was not based on
anything substantive, she said. "Just
a feeling that someone might have
said, 'Hey, what a great gig to steal
the bear,' " she concluded.
Known pranksters on campus
have denied any involvement in the
matter.
"I'm sure we didn't do it," said
Jeff Stevens, manager for the Leland
Stanford Junior University March
ing Band. "I don't think anyone
would take the time to go take it.
Maybe we'd do it during the year,
but not now."

"I only know what I read in the
papers," said Jim Suhre, business
manager of the Chaparral. "Do you
know anything about it?"
The stuffed Alaskan Kodiak bear
was donated to Berkeley in the
1960s by an alumnus, said Hoppe.
"The bear has never been a target of
theft," she said.
Ironically, the bear was about to
be moved to different quarters in the
student union, according to Hoppe.
"We figured it had been moved by
the Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California," she said.
"It's kind of tacky to steal some
thing during the off-season," said
Hoppe, adding that anyone who has
seen the bear should phone either
Stanford or Berkeley police.
