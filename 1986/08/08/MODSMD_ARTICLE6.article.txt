# Prof. Rice keeps minds active

### HEIDI COHEN 
Classes can sometimes become tiresome when the
communication is flowing only one way. But stu
dents who sign up for courses taught by Condoleezza
Rice are not faced with this problem.
According to students and colleagues alike, few
people fill the role of instructor as well as Rice. An
assistant professor of political science specializing in
U.S.-Soviet military policy and assistant director on
leave from Stanford's Center for International Secur
ity and Arms Control, Rice cxccls in both teaching
and research, balancing pursuits of one. with the
other. She is vigorously committed to ensuring that
her students get a quality education while continually
expanding her own knowledge.
Rice's talents have not gone unnoticed. At 31, she
has accumulated a long list of accomplishments. In
1984, as a third-year assistant professor, she received
the Walter Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching,

and the following year she was one of three featured
speakers at Senior Class Day.
Coit Blacker, a senior research associate at the
arms control center who has worked closely with
Rice, says he believes Rice's success stems from a
toned ability to "make students feel she's not tallying
to them, but teaching with them."
She effectively "encourages the people in her
classes to take an active role in the education
process,'' he says.
Ricc explains that her philosophy of teaching
begins with openly communicating a sense of awe
about course subjects. "If I cease to be excited about a
particular topic, then I will 110 longer teach it," she
says.
Ricc says she believes education should reach
beyond the borders of the syllabus. Urging her stu
dents to talk with her frequently outside of class, Rice
says she is doing her job when stu
dents begin to question their original
beliefs. Her responsibility, she says,
is to present fairly both sides of any
controversial issue.
Rice's current convictions, ideas
and values have largely been shaped
by her past. Raised in the crucible of
civil rights, Birmingham, Ala., she
could not help but be politically
aware.
"Everyone was caught up in the
emotion of the era," she recalls. "I
can remember the boycotts and the
black bans on certain restaurants
and hotels."
But living in a black upper
middle class community, Rice says
she was never the victim of racial
violence.
Education was strongly empha
sized in the Rice household. Her
mother was a teacher; her father was
a minister, a school guidance coun
selor and later held several adminis
trative positions at the University of
Denver.
An only child, Rice developed a

healthy sense of self-confidence at
an early age. At 12, when her
father's job forced the family to
move to Denver, Colo., she had
little trouble adjusting from an all
black school in the South to an es
sentially white private girls' school
in Denver.
Having grown up in a scholarly
environment, you might think that
Rice's life-long goal was to become a
professor. Her childhood dream,
however, was to be a concert pianist.
Rice carried that ambition with her
until her sophomore year at the
University of Denver, she says,
when she realized she lacked the ne
cessary talent and discipline to be a
renowned musician.
Rice changed her major to
"undeclared" and began to take a va
riety of classes until she discovered
she had an interest in political sci
ence. She obtained her master's
degree in that field at Notre Dame
and returned to Denver to work on a
Ph.D. in international studies and
economics.
After completing her doctorate,
Rice was still questioning the
prospect of teaching as a university
professor. At the time she felt she'd
seen enough of college campuses.
But when she weighed the pros and
cons of her various governmental
and academic job offers, Rice
decided Stanford "had the right
combination of research and teach
ing." She says she was especially im
pressed with Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms
Control.
Five years later, Rice says she is
pleased with her choice. She enjoys
the atmosphere of Stanford. "It is in
tellectual without being stuffy about
it," she says. She would like to see a
couple of things improved,
however.

The University ought to hire a
more diverse faculty because the
lack of minority professors greatly
reduces the quality of education, she
says. She'd also like to see Stanford
become more involved in local, na
tional and international affairs.
Academics should be a complement
to society, not a separate entity, she
says.
One way to accomplish this in
volvement is through research, Rice
says. For the past year, Rice has
taken a break from the classroom to
work at the Hoover Institution. As
one of 14 professionals picked
nationwide for the fellowship, she
has used the time to complete a
book entitled "The Gorbachev Era"
and has begun another that will ex
amine the evolution of U.S. and So
viet military staffs.

In her continued efforts to im
prove her understanding of military
policy, Rice will act as a pseudo
officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
Washington, D.C., beginning next
month. The Council on Foreign
Relations has chosen 20 American
professors to experience government
for one year. She will work in the
planning of policies and strategies
for war.
Since it is difficult for civilian
academics to comprehend the com
plexities of the military, Rice says
she feels fortunate to have this
"reality check."
Although she says she will miss
her students, the unique insider's
perspective she will gain in the na
tion's capital will most likely benefit
them when she resumes teaching
again here in the fall of 1987.

prospect of teaching as a university
professor. At the time she felt she'd
seen enough of college campuses.
But when she weighed the pros and
cons of her various governmental
and academic job offers, Rice
decided Stanford "had the right
combination of research and teach
ing." She says she was especially im
pressed with Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms
Control.
Five years later, Rice says she is
pleased with her choice. She enjoys
the atmosphere of Stanford. "It is in
tellectual without being stuffy about
it," she says. She would like to see a
couple of things improved,
however.

The University ought to hire a
more diverse faculty because the
lack of minority professors greatly
reduces the quality of education, she
says. She'd also like to see Stanford
become more involved in local, na
tional and international affairs.
Academics should be a complement
to society, not a separate entity, she
says.
One way to accomplish this in
volvement is through research, Rice
says. For the past year, Rice has
taken a break from the classroom to
work at the Hoover Institution. As
one of 14 professionals picked
nationwide for the fellowship, she
has used the time to complete a
book entitled "The Gorbachev Era"
and has begun another that will ex
amine the evolution of U.S. and So
viet military staffs.

In her continued efforts to im
prove her understanding of military
policy, Rice will act as a pseudo
officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
Washington, D.C., beginning next
month. The Council on Foreign
Relations has chosen 20 American
professors to experience government
for one year. She will work in the
planning of policies and strategies
for war.
Since it is difficult for civilian
academics to comprehend the com
plexities of the military, Rice says
she feels fortunate to have this
"reality check."
Although she says she will miss
her students, the unique insider's
perspective she will gain in the na
tion's capital will most likely benefit
them when she resumes teaching
again here in the fall of 1987.
Classes can sometimes become tiresome when the
communication is flowing only one way. But stu
dents who sign up for courses taught by Condoleezza
Rice are not faced with this problem.
According to students and colleagues alike, few
people fill the role of instructor as well as Rice. An
assistant professor of political science specializing in
U.S.-Soviet military policy and assistant director on
leave from Stanford's Center for International Secur
ity and Arms Control, Rice cxccls in both teaching
and research, balancing pursuits of one. with the
other. She is vigorously committed to ensuring that
her students get a quality education while continually
expanding her own knowledge.
Rice's talents have not gone unnoticed. At 31, she
has accumulated a long list of accomplishments. In
1984, as a third-year assistant professor, she received
the Walter Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching,

and the following year she was one of three featured
speakers at Senior Class Day.
Coit Blacker, a senior research associate at the
arms control center who has worked closely with
Rice, says he believes Rice's success stems from a
toned ability to "make students feel she's not tallying
to them, but teaching with them."
She effectively "encourages the people in her
classes to take an active role in the education
process,'' he says.
Ricc explains that her philosophy of teaching
begins with openly communicating a sense of awe
about course subjects. "If I cease to be excited about a
particular topic, then I will 110 longer teach it," she
says.
Ricc says she believes education should reach
beyond the borders of the syllabus. Urging her stu
dents to talk with her frequently outside of class, Rice
says she is doing her job when stu
dents begin to question their original
beliefs. Her responsibility, she says,
is to present fairly both sides of any
controversial issue.
Rice's current convictions, ideas
and values have largely been shaped
by her past. Raised in the crucible of
civil rights, Birmingham, Ala., she
could not help but be politically
aware.
"Everyone was caught up in the
emotion of the era," she recalls. "I
can remember the boycotts and the
black bans on certain restaurants
and hotels."
But living in a black upper
middle class community, Rice says
she was never the victim of racial
violence.
Education was strongly empha
sized in the Rice household. Her
mother was a teacher; her father was
a minister, a school guidance coun
selor and later held several adminis
trative positions at the University of
Denver.
An only child, Rice developed a

healthy sense of self-confidence at
an early age. At 12, when her
father's job forced the family to
move to Denver, Colo., she had
little trouble adjusting from an all
black school in the South to an es
sentially white private girls' school
in Denver.
Having grown up in a scholarly
environment, you might think that
Rice's life-long goal was to become a
professor. Her childhood dream,
however, was to be a concert pianist.
Rice carried that ambition with her
until her sophomore year at the
University of Denver, she says,
when she realized she lacked the ne
cessary talent and discipline to be a
renowned musician.
Rice changed her major to
"undeclared" and began to take a va
riety of classes until she discovered
she had an interest in political sci
ence. She obtained her master's
degree in that field at Notre Dame
and returned to Denver to work on a
Ph.D. in international studies and
economics.
