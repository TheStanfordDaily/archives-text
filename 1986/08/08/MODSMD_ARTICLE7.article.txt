# UPDATE
## Deaver may face perjury probe 
### 
WASHINGTON — A House panel will vote next
week on whether to recommend that an independent
counsel investigate charges that former White House
Chief of Staff Michael Deaver committed perjury,
the subcommittee's chairman said yesterday.
The panel will consider a report that alleges
"possible perjury before the committee" when
Deaver testified last May during a closed session, said
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce oversight and inves
tigations subcommittee.
The subcommittee will meet Tuesday to consider
approving the report, which asks the independent
counsel to "inquire into whether or not indictments
for criminal misbehavior should be acted upon by
special prosecutor."
Dingell said he will ask the subcommittee to ap
prove the report.
Randall Turk, a Washington attorney representing
Deaver, said that "it's inappropriate to comment un
til such time as we have an opportunity to see any
report prepared by Mr. Dingell's subcommittee."
The report deals with "several items of serious con
flict in Mr. Deaver's testimony before the committee
under oath," said Dingell, who also chairs the full
Energy and Commerce Committee. It also recom
mends that an independent counsel act on findings
by the General Accounting Office that Deaver may

have violated conflict-of-interest laws.
Dingell declined to specify what elements of
Deaver's testimony were in conflict, saying he would
prefer to wait until the report is considered by the
subcommittee before he says more.
However, "NBC Nightly News" quoted sources as
saying Deaver's testimony was compared to that of
several former and current Reagan Administration
officials in regard to Deaver's business contacts in
volving Puerto Rico, Japan and West Germany.
"CBS News" also said sources indicated Deaver tes
timony had differed from that of U.S. Ambassador
Richard Burt.
NBC said the subcommittee report also cited
Deaver's contact with Robert McFarlane, who was
national security adviser at the time, and Mike
Mansfield, the U.S. ambassador to Japan.
NBC also mentioned a meeting between Deaver
and White House Budget Director James Miller 111
involving the B-l bomber, manufactured by Rock
well Inc., a Deaver client.
Deaver, a longtime friend of President and Mrs.
Reagan, has been the target of an investigation into
allegations that he violated ethics laws that prohibit
former government officials from lobbying on mat
ters they handled while in office within a specified
period of time.
