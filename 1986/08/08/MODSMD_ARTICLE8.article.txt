# USSR shelters ex-CIA agent

MOSCOW — The Soviet Union
said yesterday it had given asylum to
former CIA agent Edward Howard,
who has eluded an FBI dragnet
since being charged last year with
selling U.S. secrets to Moscow.
Reports published in the United
States have said the information
Howard sold the Soviets for $6,000
"wiped out" the ClA's Moscow
operations and led the Soviets to ar
rest and execute a Soviet CIA con
tact. •
Howard vanished from his Santa
Fe, N.M., home last September,
just days before the FBI charged him
with espionage. Reagan Administra
tion sources said in October he was
thought to have fled to the Soviet
Union.
His father, who lives in the Dallas

suburb of Garland, was quoted by
the Garland Daily News as saying
his son telephoned from Moscow on
Tuesday morning.
It was believed to be the first
defection by a CIA agent and the
first American defection to Moscow
since the 19605.
The official Tass news agency dis
tributed a statement in English
saying that Howard sought asylum
because "he has to hide from U.S.
secret services, which unfoundedly
persecute him."
Specific details about the damage
Howard may have caused U.S. in
telligence are hazy. But a former
CIA official in Washington, speak
ing on condition of anonymity, said
the damage "has to have been
serious."

Howard worked for the CIA from
January 1981 to June 1983, when he
was fired. U.S. officials said he
flunked a polygraph test that indi
cated he had used illegal drugs while
he was an agent and was guilty of
petty thefts of money.
Howard had been in training for a
Moscow post.
The Los Angeles Times last
month quoted unidentified sources
as saying Howard sold the Soviets
details of U.S. intelligence opera
tions in Moscow that led to the ex
ecution of one of the ClA's prime
contacts, identified as A.G. Tolka
chev, an engineer.
"Howard disclosed virtually every
active operation we had," it quoted a
source as saying. "He wiped out
Moscow station."
