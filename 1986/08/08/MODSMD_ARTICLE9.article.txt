# Pretoria job hinges on U.S. policy shift, aspiring envoy says
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Reagan
Administration's attempt to name a
new U.S. envoy to South Africa suf
fered another blow yesterday as Am
bassador to Denmark Terence Tod
man, a leading candidate for the
post, declared that he would take the
job only if the Administration comes
up with a policy that "commands
the respect" of both blacks and
whites in the strife-torn country.
Todman's remarks were inter
preted by the White House as tanta
mount to taking his name out of
consideration. "That's as good as
removed," said one official, calling
Todman's press conference "an ex
traordinary measure to take" for a
career diplomat.

President Reagan had hoped to
send a black ambassador to Pretoria
as a symbolic statement of opposi
tion to the apartheid system of racial
segregation. Todman became the
most likely nominee after plans to
appoint Robert Brown, a black
North Carolina businessman, fell
through.
Unlike Brown, who took himself
out of the running because of ques
tions about his past business

practices, Todman was regarded as
an impeccable candidate because of
his long career in public life. He has
been U.S. ambassador to several
countries, including Spain and
Chad.
Todman called the press confer
ence in Copenhagen to deny a pub
lished report that he had asked not to
be considered for the South African
post. He told reporters that he would
accept the job "if asked and if there
is a policy that commands the
respect of both sides and the front
line states."
Todman did not call for addi
tional sanctions, maintaining that
"we cannot afford to be totally out of
South Africa." However, his
criticism of the Administration's
policy pointed up the difficulty of
finding a new ambassador at a time
when that policy is under attack at
home and abroad.
While there is no particular time
pressure on the Administration to
fill the Pretoria job, the current am
bassador, Herman Nickle, has an
nounced his intention to leave after
more than four years in the post â€” a
year longer than the normal three
year rotation. With the spotlight on
the Administration's role in South
Africa, it does not help matters to
have a lame-duck ambassador
representing Reagan's policies.
Although Reagan is holding firm
in his opposition to any change of
course on South Africa, frustration
is mounting among Administration
policymakers over their inability to
win any significant reforms from the
white-ruled Pretoria regime.
"Our policies in South Africa
have not worked," a White House
official said. However, at the same
time, this official said he was con
vinced that sanctions were not the
answer to the impasse.
