What do these six names have
in common?
They are all going to be at The
Daily today at 3 p.m. for edit
board. So drag yourself in out of
the sun and lend your voice. The
more the merrier, and things
can only get merrier at Daily
softball. Ahhh, softball....
Softball
Tomorrow. Same place
(North IM fields). Same time (4
p.m.). The Terror, fresh off its
f.rst win of the summer, takes
on the Business School in a spe
cial post-season appearance.
Come defend The Daily's win
ning streak and Tracy's wallet.
But most of all come because, if
we don't get nine, we can't
play.
