# Stanford might test athletes for drugs in 1987

### ERIK ESELIUS Editorial staff 
With the NCAA continuing to apply pres
sure for stricter drug-testing in college ath
letics, Stanford is expected to reluctantly
implement its own drug testing program next
year, following the example of eight other
Pac-10 universities.
At the beginning of every sports season, the
NCAA requires all collegiate athletes to sign a
consent form agreeing to conform and abide
by prescribed NCAA regulations.

The NCAA has recently adopted an addi
tional requirement to this consent form,
whereby an athlete must willingly participate
in NCAA drug-testing, which occurs in all
NCAA post-season championships or bowl
games.
Under the new regulation, an individual
who tests positive for drug use forfeits his or
her entire team from the post-season competi
tion.
"We're sort of caught between a rock and a
hard place," said Stanford Faculty Athletic
Representative Jack Friedenthal. "On one

hand, we want people to take responsibility for
their own actions. On the other, if someone is
caught, then we're out of howl games and
championships.
"What do you do when one player blows it
â€” the whole team is out."
In the past, Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger has been adverse to drug-testing Stan
ford athletes and has told the Times Tribune
that the University would only institute such a
practice if forced by the NCAA.
Recently, the NCAA has become more
stringent in drug-testing procedures and re

quirements.
Geiger, who is on vacation, was un
available for comment.
Once drug-testing is implemented, Stan
ford teams with a possibility of securing a post
season berth would have testing done prior to
that competition, and in effect, "give our
people some sort of protection," Friedenthal
said.
Though "definitely in favor of eliminating
drug usage," Friedenthal said he was not en-
tirely pleased with the new NCAA
drug testing regulations, adding that
the "same treatment should be ap
plied for all students.
"I don't understand it? Why the
athletes? Why not test the people
who drive around campus or the
people who do sensitive drug experi
ments? It's just a lot of media hype,"
Friedenthal said.

Athletes at many schools are
viewed as a coach's investment, and
drug-testing is seen as a means of
protecting that investment, accord
ing to Friedenthal, who added that
Stanford coaches do not have "that
kind of mentality. "
"There are legitimate things
(regarding drug-testing). There are
health aspects. I'm not in favor of
drug use, but I wish the University
would attack this problem on a
global level.
"Maybe we should hand out

needles at the beginning of the
school year, urinate in a bottle at
registration."
Stanford Defensive Coordinator
Dick Mannini voiced strong support
for the proposed testing, praising the
beneficial effect it could have on in
fluencing younger athletes to avoid
drugs.
"If someone wants to kill them
selves either rapidly or slowly, I
guess its their own business, but
when it affects the well-being of
others, then I think steps have to be

taken."
Mannini added that if an athlete
refused such a test, "drastic
measures may have to come up."
Despite some reservations, few
Stanford athletes who were inter
viewed found fault with the NCAA's
effort. As defensive back Toi Cook
said, "If you have nothing to hide, it
should be no problem."
"If I were tested tomorrow," said
defensive lineman Eric Volta,
"besides a little beer, they wouldn't
find anything."
