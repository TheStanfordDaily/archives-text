# Pentagon cuts Lockheed funds for secret jet
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is cut
ting off most monthly payments to the
Lockheed Corp. for the top-secret Stealth
fighter because of what a senior official called
a "complete breakdown in security" at the
firm's Burbank, Calif, plant where the plane
is being built.
The action came as Pentagon and company
officials acknowledged that Lockheed has
made little progress in locating more than
1,000 classified documents reported missing at
the plant last month. Under Secretary of
Defense Donald Hicks said yesterday the Air
Force will withhold a "substantial" portion of
the company's monthly contract payments un
til all security problems are corrected. That
could take several months, officials said.

"The situation at Lockheed is one I consider
to be a near disaster, and I'm not trying to
defend it," Hicks, the Pentagon official in
charge of all "black" or classified programs,
told the House Energy and Commerce sub
committee on investigations during a hearing.
Hicks said there was no evidence that any of
the missing documents have fallen into the
hands of hostile powers. Saying the security
lapse was one that "I detest and deplore," he
said the department was moving to tighten
controls over all secret programs by organizing
a special cadre of Defense Investigative Service
officials to monitor military contractors
working on such programs.
The Stealth jet fighter — an aircraft de
signed to avoid detection by enemy radar — is

considered so secret that the Air Force has
refused to acknowledge that it exists. As a
result, Hicks declined during yesterday's
hearing to identify the Lockheed project by
name. He also said he could not say how
much money would be withheld from
Lockheed because that might disclose how
much was being spent on the unnamed
"black" project.
But so much information on the aircraft has
been reported in trade journals that Subcom
mittee Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.) yes
terday publicly identified the project as the
Stealth fighter for the first time.
The Pentagon's action came two months
after Dingell's subcommittee, based on com
plaints by two Lockheed security officials, first

charged that hundreds of documents were
missing from the Burbank plant and that com
pany officials had falsified audit forms to cover
up the loss.
Lockheed first denied the charges. After a
General Accounting Office investigation,
Lockheed Chairman Lawrence Kitchen
conceded at a July 24 hearing that there had
been an "inexcusable" lapse in security at the
plant.
The missing documents are said to include
classified blueprints, film, tapes and other ma
terials about the Stealth fighter. In one in
stance, a plant assembler removed classified
blueprints showing the configuration of the
Stealth fighter, took them home to his apart
ment and showed them to his girlfriend.
