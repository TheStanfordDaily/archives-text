Mosk seeks another state court term
SAN FRANCISCO — State Supreme Court Justice Stanley Mosk
yesterday ended public speculation about his retirement, saying he
will seek another 12-year term in November.
Mosk, who turns 74 next month, apparently will face little of the
opposition that confronts other liberal justices of the court.
He has been on the court since 1964 and has insisted for about a
year that he was undecided about running again or retiring.
Mosk said he would not solicit contributions or spend any money
campaigning.
By contrast, Chief Justice Rose Bird has about $1 million in the
bank for her uphill campaign effort, and Justices Joseph Grodin and
Cruz Reynoso, also under attack by conservatives, have organized
substantial campaigns.
New shuttle rockets design settled
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Engineers have developed a new
solid rocket engine design that will prevent a failure like the one that
caused the explosion aboard the space shuttle Challenger, according
to a NASA source.
A NASA engineer, speaking on condition that he not be identified,
said that a team at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama has
settled on a new, fundamental design for the rocket engine, a major
step toward returning the shuttle to flight.
The Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger explo
sion of Jan. 28, said that two O-rings in the rocket engine joint failed
to seal, allowing superheated gases to burn through the Wall of a
propellant tank. Fuel and oxidizer from the tank ignited, causing the
explosion.
The NASA engineer said the new solid rocket design will include a
third O-ring and feature a metal lip that will force the joint to remain
sealed.
Study calls lap seat belts hazardous
WASHINGTON — A federal study of auto accidents in which
rear-seat passengers wearing seat belts sustained serious injuries con
cluded yesterday that the lap-only belts may do more harm than good.
The National Transportation Safety Board urged the government to
require rear-seat shoulder belts — instead of the lap-only variety now
on most rear seats — as soon as possible.
Three states — California, Massachusetts and Washington — re
quire rear-seat passengers to use their lap belts.
