ANZUS loses kiwi member
SAN FRANCISCO — U.S. and Australian offi
cials agreed yesterday to stand firm against New
Zealand, the absent member of the trilateral ANZUS
alliance, saying its maverick policies on port and air
access are harmful to the defense of the South Pacific
region.
New Zealand, not invited to this year's ANZUS
talks, has been an inactive partner in the 35-year-old
alliance since Prime Minister David Lange an
nounced in February 1985 that U.S. nuclear-armed
and nuclear-powered ships would not be allowed to
dock at New Zealand ports.
Speaking at a news conference that followed five
hours of formal meetings, U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz said New Zealand effectively
withdrew from the alliance, at least temporarily, by
refusing to recognize a longstanding U.S. policy not
to reveal whether its vessels carry nuclear arms.
Left unresolved at the talks, according to both
sides, was Australia's anger at the U.S. for recently
deciding to subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Un
ion and China, both grain customers of Australia.

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Hayden,
in harshly worded remarks earlier yesterday, ex
pressed the "genuine outrage" of Australians at the
sale decision.
Canada reels in boat people
ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland — Three Canadian
fishing vessels rescued 150 men, women and
children who were found yesterday adrift in two
lifeboats in the Atlantic Ocean, a Canadian Coast
Guard spokesman reported.
"They were let off a ship," the spokesman, Bruce
Reid, said. "They are in good condition other than
the fact they are a bit hungry."
Reid said the survivors told the rescuers that they
had spent five days in the lifeboats after leaving the
ship. He also said radio reports from the rescue ves
sels indicated the fishermen believed the people were
from Sri Lanka, but officials had not confirmed that.
Sri Lanka, an island off India's southern tip, has
been torn by a separatist revolt, and thousands of
citizens have sought refuge abroad.
