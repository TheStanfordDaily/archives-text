For two decades, a taxidermist's dream has graced the Berkeley stu
dent union with its imposing presence. Some Weenies have called
this stuffed bear — a symbol of the university's mascot — "gamey,"
while others would tout it"the heart and soul of the university."
Now, in the greatest scandal since Teapot Dome and Watergate,
the bear has been stolen. Swiped. Filched. Absconded with. Five
finger discounted. And Berkeley is desperately seeking the culprit.
Immediately, teary-eyed Weenies looked across the Bay, 50 miles to
the south. As the football season draws near, Berkeley seems to be
losing the attributes of logic and reason, and has already adopted the
Big Game mentality; all fingers point to Stanford.
But is there any justification in Berkeley's assumption that Stanford
is guilty of this heinous crime? My dear Watson, I think not.
First, this is summer. There is no one around Stanford who'd care
enough to make the 50-mile drive to purloin a 7-foot 200-pound
mothbreeder. Second, the case that enclosed the bear apparently was
not forced open, not jimmied, not broken into, not dynamited. It had
two locks and one key. Who had the key? Unless the key were labeled
"Drop in any mailbox. Postage guaranteed by Stanford," the
likelihood of its presence at Stanford is nil.
Look, Stanford didn't do it.
The only clue Berkeley has, according to UC Rally Committee
chair Tina Hoppe, is that the bear was seen "driving around some
place."
That's pretty helpful; now we know we're dealing with a very
talented bear.
Personally, we feel that the bear disappeared (quite conveniently)
on the eve of his first urinalysis test that would have determined his
eligibility to appear in Cal football games.
A possibility that has not been discounted is that the bear was in
dicted by the FBI for passing secrets to the Soviet Union.
Finally, a popular theory is that the bear was simply a projection of
the fears and insecurities of Cal students, and that when Cal students
became mature and secure enough, the projection would dissolve.
Unfortunately, this theory implies that the bear will reappear very
soon.
Perhaps UC students were fed up with staring at a stuffed bear while
trying to relax at the student union, and simply decided to do away
with the eyesore themselves.
What advice can we give Berkeley? Like Stanford Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington said, "Look closer to home. " We respectfully suggest a
picnic basket be placed at the corner of Shattuck and Telegraph.
