Parking complaints
As the owner of 1.0 car, I found
little comfort in Stanford parking
space availability of 0.79 per em
ployee (Daily, Aug.l).
The idea that I have to compete
with a pool of 20,000 to secure a
space within reasonable distance
from my lab did not come as a
surprise.
Seems that just as the parking
structure across from the lab is
looking to be near completion, the
psychiatry building was moved out
into the parking lot out back, and
soon even more building will start
there for the MGM (Molecular and
Genetic Medicine) Center. This will
of course be followed by the con
struction of the new animal facility.
So the parking space around the
Med Center seems to ebb and flow.
The parking enforcement mean
while charges ahead as though there
were enough spaces.
Now as parking spaces disappear
and huge holes in the ground ap
pear, I must decide if I should buy
an "A" permit — seems that the "A"
parking lots never suffer the same
fate as the "C" lots.
Just as the deluge of winter
begins, I expect parking enforcement
to be at its seasonal high, attempting
to make us obey, without the oppor
tunity to even secure a parking
space.

In Search of Excellence
At fifteen
School is a fine and proper place —
if you don't ride the rails,
don't hit the trails.
School is where you should be —
if you're not rolling and free
on Route 33
(from Kalamazoo to Sault Ste
Marie).
If you don't hear train whistles
at night,
don't speak truck-stop at sight,
don't change plans in mid-flight,
or piggyback strangers alight,
school, my friend, for you is right.
If history for you
is not Route 22,
and romance language
not "Git up and do,"
if Botany One oh oh
is not tumbleweed on the go-go
(as you bend the western curve
out of Gallup, New Mexico),
if for long division you don't ride
to the lovelorn Continental Divide,
and for down home economics don't
rumble and yearn,
then, school, alas, is your place to
learn.
