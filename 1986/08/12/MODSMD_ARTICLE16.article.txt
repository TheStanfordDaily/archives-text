# Just a little horsin' around
## 
### 
My family is heading for the Sierras again this year
and parts of me are not sure I'm ready.
You see, for the second year in a row we're going to a
dude ranch. With horses. Big horses with bad breath
and sweaty flanks.

I am not a horsey person. I don't dislike them and I
can't say, to be fair, that they dislike me either. But
dammit, we don't click. On the few occasions when I
have approached a beast of the equestrian variety there is
. . . how can I put it? A certain formality, a lack of ready
conversation, the uncomfortable feeling that the horse
and I have nothing to say to each other.
The "parts'' I refer to in the first sentence are not only
mental reservations, however, but my own sensitive
hindquarters. Riding a horse for six hours a day after
abstaining from same for the previous 51 weeks is like
experiencing the Chinese water torture, only it's com
pletely different, and much worse.
By the end of my second day with the intermediate
riding group last year I was so sore I actually could not
dismount, although my horse asked me to.
Worst of all, at the end of each day's ride, as tears
of pain filled my eyes, my horse (whose name now
eludes me — it was either "Sundance" or
"Exterminator") would see home approaching around
the bend of the dirt trail, and, with a whinny of recogni
tion, speed up to a fast, wrenching trot designed to keep
me from ever becoming a father.
"Whoa!" I would say, at which, although the word al
legedly means "stop" in Horse, the sadistic brute would

lunge forward faster.
As if that daily torture isn't enough, last year a horse
fell on top of my father. I swear this is true. If you don't
believe it, call him at the Classics Department at 723-
4658 and ask him. He was riding slightly ahead of me
across a grassy area pockmarked with gopher holes when
his horse stumbled and fell sideways before my dad had
a chance to do anything but blaspheme.
Injury was slight, thank heaven — a few bruises on
one leg — but my father, on the other hand, limped for
weeks afterward.
Why do my parents want to return to this place? A tax
dodge? Mom seems even more enthusiastic than last
year; on the other hand, she's already announced that
due to a ''back injury" she will forgo horses for daily
drives to casinos in Carson City.
My parents stress that "family togetherness" is the rea
son for our impending week at the dude ranch. But
couldn't we all play miniature golf instead? Or maybe
race those cars at Malibu Grand Prix?

My parents stress that "family
togetherness" is the reason for
our impending week at the
dude ranch.

Actually, it wasn't that bad. My legs simply went
numb after the fourth day and I didn't feel much of any
thing. And the food there is good and they clean up the
dishes for you.
But it's not much of a consolation when I climb up
on ol' Exterminator.
