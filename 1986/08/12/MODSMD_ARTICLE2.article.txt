# More PCBs spill at industrial park

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Editorial staff 
An oily sheen was reported Wed
nesday in the flood control channel
of Matadero Creek upstream from
Varian Associates, a tenant at Stan
ford Industrial Park, a company
spokesperson said yesterday.
The oily liquid contained 4,900
parts per billion of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), according to Palo
Alto Fire Inspector Heiser. The
PCB concentration found in the
water was 0.7 parts per billion,
Heiser said.
State health regulations deem a
PCB concentration of 7,000 parts
per billion to be a health hazard.
The Environmental Protection
Agency lists PCBs as a suspected
cancer-causing agent.
The problem is "not chronic nor
a steady source," he said.

A leaky storm drain at Varian
Building 2 was responsible for
leaking PCBs into Matadero Creek
in late June. But according to
Heiser, Varian Associates is not re
sponsible for the recent spill because
the source lies upstream of the
Varian property.
Varian is cleaning up the spill and
will be reimbursed once the respon
sible part\' is identified, Heiser said.
Heiser speculated that the PCBs
might be coming from a property
formerly owned by Aydin and cur
rently owned by Hewlett-Packard.
Previous contaminations of the
storm drain system originated from
this area, he said.
However, there is no positive
proof that this site is in any way con
nected with the spill, he cautioned.
Varian has been routinely pulling
samples from the channel upstream,
said Gary Simpson, vice president of
Corporate Communications at
Varian. Simpson said he is
"confident" that Varian is in no way
involved with the spill since it oc
curred upstream.

No announcement of the spill
was made until Friday when the lab
results became conclusive, Heiser
said. Last month Varian had also re
ported an oily sheen, but nothing
was found in the samples, he added.
Further test results will be available
at a later date.
An open dam installed at Varian's
property line to monitor the flow of
water onto its property prevented the

oily liquid from proceeding. The
sand bag dam was installed because
Varian is located at the bottom of
the flood channel, next to the creek.
Hazardous substances leaked by any
of the tenants would have to pass
through Varian property before
reaching the creek. The dam
enables Varian to know whether it is
responsible for any possible pollu
tion of the creek, Simpson said.
