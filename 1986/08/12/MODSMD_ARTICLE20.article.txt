## The 						Bug eyes new post office 
### KIRK JENSEN JOHN POWELL Staff writers 
DEAR BUG ME: I have noticed some physical
changes in the Stanford Post Office. What are they doing
in there? Are they doing anything to shorten those ter
ribly long lines?
— Fee Mail
DEAR FEE: We at the Bug have been very con
cerned with the flurry of activity at the ol' P. 0., espe
cially because we have received so little mail from our
readers this summer.

To learn more about our beloved post office and
plans for its future, we contacted Mike Bosch, manager
of customer services for this area. According to Bosch,
the new beige plastic counter with turquoise trim and a
recessed stamp vending machine is part of a plan to
replace the currently dilapidated equipment with high
tech "window service computers.'' These new machines
will weigh parcels and figure postage, saving time now
spent looking up rates in various booklets. Bosch added
that the new system will also help to reduce paperwork
at the end of each day, lowering accounting expenses.
Unfortunately, not everyone agrees that the new sys
tem will shorten the long lines. Ken Mar, window tech
nician, remains skeptical in the face of progress. Mar
agrees that the new system will be "more accurate in
closing the books each day," but fears even longer lines.

According to Mar, the new system "may slow things
down," because specific routines will be required for
even the smallest transactions.
Being fully aware that we had not yet answered your
question, we inquired further. According to Bosch, the
new counters are only part of the overall plan to improve
service at the Stanford branch. Bosch hopes that by mid-
September 2,000 new post office boxes will be added to
the existing 7,000, giving Stanford more boxes than any
other branch in Northern California. Unfortunately,
the addition may also increase the wait at the windows.
Mar noted that even with 7,000 boxes, one of the three
window clerks is often called upon to distribute the
mail, a problem that is sure to intensify with the addi
tional 2,000.
Before you become red with anger, however, there is
one plan that sounds like a true improvement. In addi
tion to the new boxes, Bosch hopes that "parcel lockers"
will soon be installed. When a package arrives that
doesn't fit into a normal P.O. box, a clerk will put it in
one of these lockers and the key in the receiver's box.
This will allow the box-holder to pick up the package
without waiting in line. Bosch isn't sure when these
lockers will be installed, but claims that the post office
and Stanford may "set a new record in making a quick
decision."
In addition to these plans, Bosch assured us there are
other proposals to improve service at our post office.
DEAR BUG ME: There is a flashing blue light on top
of a light pole to the east of the Stadium (right next to the
bathrooms). What is this light for and why does it flash?
— Blinking in Blue
DEAR BLINKY: Our investigation of this mystery
began with an exploration of the Stanford Stadium east
parking lot in our BugMeMobile. On top of a lamp post
situated between some outlying stadium bathrooms and
Sunken Diamond stands a small, blue light. Doug Wil
liams, communications and safety coordinator for the
Office of Public Safety, explained that the strobe light
indicates the area where a police compound is set up for

football games. The high visibility of
this light makes it an appropriate
marker for the compound, and it
allows people needing police
services an easy way to find the help
they desire.
