# ENTERTAINMENT
## Roving for late night chow 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
Youth is a marvelous quality. So
wonderful that it makes the question
"Is there life after last call?" a mere
matter of rhetoric.
I tried to conduct an informal sur
vey of students, asking them if they
usually seek further entertainment
after going to a nightclub and, if so,
what? Of course, I could not see dis
aster on the horizon. I had to walk
headlong into it. What is it about an
educated student that makes
him/her give nothing but non
committal, wishy-washy responses
to such a direct question?

My mother always told me if
someone does not answer a question
directly, he or she is probably lying.
The most common response
people gave me was a whiny, "It
depends." Why anyone would go
out on an "it depends" type of deal is
beyond my reasoning faculties.
At any rate, the survey was a fail
ure, so you are going to have to put
up with my rendition of what to do
after clubbing. Don't worry, I'll keep
it clean — Rated G, even.
Because most of the better cafes
do double duty as bars, they close at
the same time as most clubs.
However, there are still those select
few that brave the bizarre late night
crowds in search of the almighty
buck.
Topping this list is the ever

popular Zim's on Van Ness (and
other locations) in San Francisco.
For some unknown reason, I seem
to end up at Zim's more often than
not. The prime attraction at Zim's,
aside from the crowd at 4 a.m., is
the world renowned Zimburger.
That's funny, I questioned a friend
from Kenya if he had ever heard of a
Zimburger. He asked me if it tasted
anything like antelope. What could
I say?
Another less-publicized option is
the entertaining little cafe above
Lips, formerly called the Sub Club
as well as other assorted names, on
Ninth Street below the large motel
sign. After a full night of dancing to

quality progressive tracks in Lips, a
hearty breakfast is but a flight of
stairs away — just like mother's
home cooking after early morning
chores. Of course, there is no substi
tute for the latter, but as Abel Mag
witch, the convict in Dickens'
"Great Expectations," would say,
"When you's stahvin', wittles is
wittles!"
If none of these suggestions strikes
your fancy, there is always an all
night coffee shop within a few blocks
of you no matter how lost you think
you are. However, for those who
can't double back one city block


without the aid of a compass, I'm
afraid you are just going to have to
settle for a 7-Eleven Slurpee, or
even worse, the latest grease-laden
concoction from the infamous Uni
versity Creamery.
If your powers of deduction have
not been activated by now, let me
have my way with the obvious. San
Francisco's better cafes do not cater
to the sunrise crowd.
For the finest cafe-action the City
has to offer, you should begin your
evening a bit earlier in order to
spend some time at a cafe before
moving on to its upbeat cousin, the
nightclub. My recommendations in

clude the Billboard Cafe on
Ninth Street, Cafe Santa Cruz on
Van Ness or the Other Cafe on Carl
Street.
Why haven't I mentioned the
Hard Rock Cafe on Van Ness?
Simply because once you've seen
the fantastic decor at the Hard Rock,

Finest cafes in the
City. . . .

there is nothing left to experience.
It's yuppie, "pick-uppy" and, as far
as I'm concerned, out of the ques
tion.
You should pick a cafe that suits
your needs. If you simply want a

place to sit back, talk and eat, either
the Billboard Cafe or Cafe Santa
Cruz will do nicely. What the
former lacks in setting it more than
makes up for in crowd. To the best
of my knowledge, neither regularly
schedules performances.
The Other Cafe is the place to go
if you crave programming, which
includes some comedy shows that I
have had the good fortune to catch.
I was initially lured to the Other
Cafe by the promise of seeing a Bos
ton comedian who I had seen and
enjoyed in his native land.
What has kept me coming back to
the Other Cafe is simple homesick
ness. It reminds me of a few of my
hangouts of yore back in Boston. I
wonder how they manage to pay the
bills without my paycheck on tab?
