# 'Nothing' makes a respectable splash

### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
You've read the reviews: Tries
to do too many things. Too paste
up. Too schizophrenic. The plot
is a mess. Conflicts aren't
revealed up front.
But life is like that; I liked
"Nothing in Common" for that
reason.
Most critics object to the
movie's dual nature, saying that
it's impossible to tell whether the
film wants to be a comedy or a
drama. Then again, that distinc
tion wasn't necessary in a film
like "The Graduate. "
Not that "Nothing in Com
mon'' is up to that caliber. What
results, though, is thoroughly
likable and believable, and the
only problem is the sometimes
predictable nature of the charac
ters and plot.
The two major foci of the story
are a man's relationship to his
work and his relatioilship to his
parents. What the film shows is
the clash of those two worlds,
something that modern
audiences can certainly under
stand.
Tom Hanks, as the aforemen
tioned man, plays essentially the
same character he did on the TV
series "Bosom Buddies;" that is, a
street-smartass advertising execu
tive. Having recently been
promoted to the creative director

position of a prestigious Chicago
advertising agency, he manages
to win a lucrative contract from
an airline and to go to bed with
the owner's daughter.
Along with all this good
fortune, though, comes the
separation of his parents â€” cigar
smoking, womanizing clothing
salesman Jackie Gleason and his
silent, sensitive-and-suffering
wife Eva Marie Saint.

Obviously, Hanks
wants both
women. . . .

Gleason, in a very thoughtful
performance, is closer to Willy
Loman than Ralph Kramden; he
is the tyrant with a heart of gold
minus the heart of gold.
Hanks' sense of comedic
timing is versatile enough to
switch from the almost farcical
nature of advertising to the un
derstandably painful confronta
tions with his father. The
"heavy" scenes are never over
played (except for a couple with
his mother) because the dialogue
is sparse, and the emotional con
tent rests almost exclusively in fa
cial expressions.
So when Gleason somewhat
predictably ends up in the hospital,
the scenes showing Hanks as a
devoted son are not played for tears;
rather, they contain some of the
movie's funnier moments.
The incompatibility of Hanks'
workday world and his parents'
world is demonstrated effectively in
Hanks' loves. In the blue corner,
representing traditional values and
the School of Humanities, is his
high school sweetheart turned
modern dance instructor (Bess
Armstrong), who is the "only girl
your parents ever liked." In the red
corner, representing the "total
woman" and high-tech, is the

airline owner's daughter (Sela
Ward), who is also one of the com
pany executives.
Obviously, Hanks wants both
women, or rather, a clone who has
some qualities from each woman:
the stability of the sweetheart (who
maintains the bedside vigil with him
when his father falls ill) and the
competitive trait and excitement of
the executive (who can't understand
why he would even consider missing
a business meeting to stay with his
sick father).
Half the fun of this movie is
guessing which side ultimately wins.
I recommend "Nothing in Com
mon" to anyone who's having or
who has had problems with parents,
which is to say, anyone with par
ents.
