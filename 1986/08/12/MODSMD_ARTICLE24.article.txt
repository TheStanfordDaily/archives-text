## Draft discourages players from earning degree 
### 
College baseball's drafting procedure is unlike the other two
major college sports, and that's unfortunate.
Unlike football and basketball, the best college baseball
players can be drafted after their junior years — and thus,
many of these athletes do not graduate. The setup of college
baseball actually discourages players from finishing their
degrees.
California standout Lance Blankenship is a recent example
of this sad fact. A powerful hitter with speed, the Cal third
baseman is also a good fielder.

In Blankenship's junior year, the Bears tied for second place
in the Pacific 10 Southern Division, and he was drafted in the
second round of the June draft by the Boston Red Sox. The
Bosox offered the junior $62,500 to sign and skip his senior
year.
Blankenship refused.
Many of you scholar types are thinking, "Great! The kid
wanted to stay in school and get an education — even if it is at
Cal! Good for him!"
The cynics among us might think otherwise. It was well
known that Blankenship wanted to return to Cal and lead the
Bears to the College World Series in 1986 — certainly not an
unreasonable or even a particularly selfish goal. Sort of admira
ble in a way, team spirit and all that.
But there may have been more. It has been suggested by the
even more cynical that perhaps Blankenship was hoping his

own value might go up a little bit . . . College World Series
credentials obviously impress the big leagues. Plus the
speedster was working on the NCAA stolen base record (he got
the Pac-10 mark and wound up second in NCAA history with
187) which would also help out in bargaining.
Things didn't work out that way. Cal finished dead last in
the Southern Division after a miserable year. Blankenship had
a good year, hitting .340 with 10 home runs, 51 RBIs and 46
stolen bases, but things didn't go as planned.
He was drafted in the 10th round bv the Oakland A's for
$2,500.
This is a lesson most college baseball players can under
stand.
Stanford's John Ramos was a junior this past year, and the
All-Pac-10 catcher had an excellent season, was drafted in the
fifth round, and subsequently signed with the New York
Yankees in June for a large sum. Larger, in fact, than Blanken
ship was originally offered. Close to six figures.
Ramos plans to finish his Stanford degree; he only has two
quarters left, which he can complete in the off-season. But
how many other college baseball players do you think will go
back in the off-season — or ever — to graduate?
Most Stanford athletes do, in fact, graduate. But what about
other top baseball schools: USC, Texas, Florida, Arkansas,
Oklahoma, Arizona State . . . ASU is practically a minor
league team the way it sends players to the major leagues.
These schools do not have the same kind of academic stand
ards as Stanford and Cal, and obviously attract different kinds
of students. It is doubtful if players giving up their eligibility
after their junior years ever return.
There is something wrong with the system when top college
athletes are encouraged to leave school early and forgo gradua
tion. This is not the case in college football — most players go

five years in that sport. Most basketball players stay in school
four years, except the occasional "hardship" case, like the War
riors' Chris Washburn. I'm not saying that all of these athletes
graduate, but at least they have more of an opportunity to do so
and are actually encouraged to do so.-
Top college baseball players are, in effect, being used. They
produce for three years, or in the case of junior college transfers
(almost the entire ASU team) one year, and then are gone, left
to make it or break it in the majors. If they want to go back and
complete their education, they have to fund it themselves, as
Ramos is doing. Players lose their scholarships when they lose
their eligibility.
This makes it more difficult to sign a player out of Stanford
than ASU — at least in the past, before the Blankenship exam
ple. A Stanford education is worth quite a lot of money, as we
all know too well. A player has to weigh what he is being of
fered with the price of a Stanford scholarship and the three
years he has already invested towards graduation. Most Stan
ford baseball players have stayed all four years and have then
gone on to sign.
This may no longer be the case. Ramos was offered what he
felt was enough to give up a final scholarship year, and, I'm
sure, was well aware of what happened to Cal's Blankenship.
Stanford students are not dumb.
So in the future, we may be seeing our best baseball players
departing a year early. Sophomore sensation jack McDowell
will be a junior this year, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the
hard-throwing right bander make the jump next June.
Sure it's too bad for us, too bad for the team, but in the case
of Ramos and McDowell, who will most likely receive their
Stanford degrees, it's understandable. They are making the
