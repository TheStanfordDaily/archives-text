# Kepler's clerk relives '60s spirit

Books — more than 1,000 of them — line an
entire wall of Ira Sandperl's modest room. But one
particular volume is missing, although accounted
for.
A common thread interweaves the lives of
Sandperl and the borrower of the book. It is a thread
that altered the fabric of modern history.
The story behind the borrowed book begins in the
'60s as Sandperl was delivering an anti-Vietnam War
speech. A "smartly dressed" man asked a series of
particularly penetrating questions, writes Sandperl in
"A Little Kinder."

The questioner referred to a friend of Sandperl's
who was serving three years in a Texas prison for draft
resistanee.
"This young man says he wouldn't be in his pres
ent position if it hadn't been for knowing you. . . .
Because of his stand, I am strongly influenced to take
a similar action," said the questioner.
Only later, when the questioner's photograph and
story appeared on the front page of The New York
Times, did Sandperl discover his name. The story
was on the Pentagon Papers. The man was Daniel
Ellsberg.
