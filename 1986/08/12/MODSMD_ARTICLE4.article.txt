# Kepler's clerk relives '60s spirit

Books — more than 1,000 of them — line an
entire wall of Ira Sandperl's modest room. But one
particular volume is missing, although accounted
for.
A common thread interweaves the lives of
Sandperl and the borrower of the book. It is a thread
that altered the fabric of modern history.
The story behind the borrowed book begins in the
'60s as Sandperl was delivering an anti-Vietnam War
speech. A "smartly dressed" man asked a series of
particularly penetrating questions, writes Sandperl in
"A Little Kinder."

The questioner referred to a friend of Sandperl's
who was serving three years in a Texas prison for draft
resistanee.
"This young man says he wouldn't be in his pres
ent position if it hadn't been for knowing you. . . .
Because of his stand, I am strongly influenced to take
a similar action," said the questioner.
Only later, when the questioner's photograph and
story appeared on the front page of The New York
Times, did Sandperl discover his name. The story
was on the Pentagon Papers. The man was Daniel
Ellsberg.
Did the two ever meet again?
"Oh yes," says Sandperl. "We got
to be friends. I used to visit him in
his posh San Francisco apartment.
"As a matter of fact, he still has
my book, 'The Gita According to
Gandhi,' " says Sandperl.
A clerk at Kepler's Books and
Magazines in Menlo Park,
Sandperl, 63, read Mahatma
Gandhi's autobiography in 1949,
while a Stanford student. Through
the influence of his mother,
Sandperl had been a pacifist from an
early age. But Gandhi's satyagraha,
or "the force which is born of truth,
love or nonviolence'' challenged
Sandperl to put his ideals into
practice.
"Gandhi was saying, 'If these
values mean anything to you,
buster, you'd better act on them,'
says Sandperl, his voice crackling
with laughter.
"Gandhi changed my outward life
completely," he says.
Attempting to act on those values
led Sandperl to cross paths with
others with similar beliefs.
The racial crossfire that occurred
during the 1960s led to his
friendship with the late Martin Lut
her King Jr.
Sandperl described bringing a
book as a gift to King every time they
met.
One such gift book was a histori
cal analysis by Arnold Toynbee. In
his work, Toynbee pointed out that
the roots of King's approach grew
from Gandhi's non-violent non
cooperation.

"When I gave Martin the book he
laughed and said, 'Ira, you're trying
to make an intellectual out of me.'
"Laughing in return, I said, 'I
wouldn't try to do such a terrible
thing to anybody.
When nine black children were
savagely beaten in Granada, Miss.,
Sandperl and human rights activist
Joan Baez arrived to help.
Baez met Sandperl when she was
16 at a Friends Meeting of Palo Alto
(a Quaker group) where he taught
high school students.
In her book "Daybreak," Baez
writes, "(Sandperl) talked a lot about
Gandhi, and nonviolence, and we
read from a book by a Chinese phi
losopher named Lao-tsu."
"One of the things Lao-tsu said
was, 'This is the was of what shall
be,' and I thought that was the
cleverest thing I'd ever heard,"
writes Baez.
Baez describes Sandperl in her
book as "a very young man, he was
sensitive and wise, gentle, clever,
bright and extremely stubborn. He
had the face of a young Indian
prince, and an ego to match — all
with the added attraction of his limp
which came from a case of polio he
contracted shortly after he was
born."
She continues, "he dressed in
Brooks Brothers clothes and had af
fairs with very attractive, usually
married women."
"Ira is a rascal who longs to be a
saint," Baez writes affectionately of
her mentor.
Sandperl discovered Gandhi's au
tobiography in a bookstore. He had
no money with him at the time, but
said he would come back and pay
the next day if the clerk would let
him take it home, recounts Baez.
T he clerk told him that anyone
who was interested in that book was
not likely to be dishonest.
