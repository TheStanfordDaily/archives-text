# Citizens discuss land use plans
## 
### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial staff 
Community members voiced
concern over projected University
development Thursday at a public
discussion of a Draft Environmental
Impact Report (DEIR), an assess
ment of the environmental
repercussions of proposed changes
in Stanford's county land use per
mit.
The open hearing, held before
the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission in Kresge Auditorium,
included an overview of the DEIR
by the consulting firm that compiled
it, as well as comments from the
City of Palo Alto, area environmen
talists and private citizens.

Santa Clara County commis
sioned an environmental impact
report two years ago when Stanford
applied for a modification of its 1962
county land use permit. The DEIR,
a preliminary version of a final En
vironmental Impact Report (EIR) to
be submitted to the county this fall,
evaluates potential effects of the pro
posed land use modifications on
such factors as campus population
growth, traffic, pollution and
wildlife.
Stanford's requested permit modi
fications would change the zoning
designations of 12 areas on campus
to permit potential academic devel
opment on those sites.
Palo Alto City Planner Ken
Schreiber, representing the city , said

at the hearing that Stanford's pro
posed modifications could bring
about more growth in the Univer
sity's population than the DEIR es
timates claim.
Although the DEIR predicts only
"relatively modest growth over the
next 15 years, if you total all the
square footage projected to be built
under the projected use permit mod
ification, you have about 3.5 mil
lion square feet,'' Schreiber said.
"That is potentially a very, very sig
nificant change.''
According to estimates in the
DEIR, Stanford's daytime popula
tion will grow at an average annual
rate of 0.8 percent until 1990, and
