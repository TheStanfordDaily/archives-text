# Citizens discuss land use plans
## 
### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial staff 
Community members voiced
concern over projected University
development Thursday at a public
discussion of a Draft Environmental
Impact Report (DEIR), an assess
ment of the environmental
repercussions of proposed changes
in Stanford's county land use per
mit.
The open hearing, held before
the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission in Kresge Auditorium,
included an overview of the DEIR
by the consulting firm that compiled
it, as well as comments from the
City of Palo Alto, area environmen
talists and private citizens.

Santa Clara County commis
sioned an environmental impact
report two years ago when Stanford
applied for a modification of its 1962
county land use permit. The DEIR,
a preliminary version of a final En
vironmental Impact Report (EIR) to
be submitted to the county this fall,
evaluates potential effects of the pro
posed land use modifications on
such factors as campus population
growth, traffic, pollution and
wildlife.
Stanford's requested permit modi
fications would change the zoning
designations of 12 areas on campus
to permit potential academic devel
opment on those sites.
Palo Alto City Planner Ken
Schreiber, representing the city , said

at the hearing that Stanford's pro
posed modifications could bring
about more growth in the Univer
sity's population than the DEIR es
timates claim.
Although the DEIR predicts only
"relatively modest growth over the
next 15 years, if you total all the
square footage projected to be built
under the projected use permit mod
ification, you have about 3.5 mil
lion square feet,'' Schreiber said.
"That is potentially a very, very sig
nificant change.''
According to estimates in the
DEIR, Stanford's daytime popula
tion will grow at an average annual
rate of 0.8 percent until 1990, and
from 1990 to the end of the century
at a rate of 0.3 percent a year is
forecast.
Schreiber said Palo Alto "has
been in discussions" with Stanford
over the possibility of including in
its modified land use permit "a con
dition that would limit the popula
tion (growth) of the campus areas to
the numbers cited in the DEIR."
"Without [such a condition], we
would question the fundamental
validity of the document," Schreiber
added.
Ira Fink, of Ira Fink and As
sociates, Inc., the consulting firm
that compiled the DEIR, said he ex
pected the proposed land use modi

fications to have little effect on
campus population levels. Ihe
changes in population (projected in
the DEIR) would probably occur
with or without the proposed
changes (in the land use permit),"
he said.
Similarity, Phillip Williams,
University director of planning, said
that "changes induced (by modifica
tions in the land use permit) will be
relatively minor."
"It's essentially just a housekeep
ing matter," Williams said.
East Palo Alto resident Trevor
Boroughs drew applause from the
audience of about 35 when he
protested the fact that part of the
University Arboretum area along
Palm Drive is slated to be
redesignated from "open space to
"academic reserve" under the pro

posed permit modifications.
"The green area between El
Camino and the (Main Academic)
Quad ... is not just green area, it's
also historic space â€” it houses the
mausoleum of the Stanford family,"
Boroughs said. "I'm sure it's some
thing the founder of Stanford Uni
versity never dreamed of having
developed."
According to the DEIR, the land
on either side of Palm Drive would
be open to potential development,
though the "immediate set back area
from the street" would retain its
"open space" designation.
Judy Chan, University associate
director of planning, said yesterday
she does not anticipate development
in the Arboretum area "anytime in
the near future."
Speaking on behalf of Palo Alto,
Schreiber submitted and was
granted a request that the County
Planning commissioners extend the
DEIR's required 45-day public
review period until Sept. 24.
An audience member at the
hearing asked why the public review
period for the DEIR was taking
place during the summer "when
everybody was gone."
Williams responded that the
timing of the release of the DEIR
reflected only the fact that the report
had just recently been completed.
Once the review period for the
DEIR is completed, a final Environ

mental Impact Report will be sub
mitted to the County Planning
Commission.
Following certification of the
final report by the commission, the
commissioners will vote to approve
or deny Stanford's land use permit
modification proposal.
Linda Elkind, legislative coordin
ator for the Committee for Green
Foothills, requested that the final
EIR contain a copy of a 1985 agree
ment between Stanford, Santa Clara
County and Palo Alto that requires
each part>' to notify the others of ac
tions affecting them.
Under this agreement, Elkind
said, any University development of
the Foothills "would be subject to
policies set by the council of the
City of Palo Alto."
