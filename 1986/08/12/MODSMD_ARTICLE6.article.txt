# Pie-throwers charge punishment too stiff
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
Three Chaparral staff members
involved in a pie-throwing incident
at a spring ASSU meeting have said
they received punishments at the re
quest of University President
Donald Kennedy that are much stif
fer than those recommended by
Diana Conklin, assistant dean o'f
Student Affairs.
All three — recent graduate Ron
Herbst, junior Josh Weinstein and
sophomore joe Dew — were or
dered to "develop guidelines to
prevent pranks (such as pie
throwing) at future ASSU Senate
meetings," said Herbst, who was last
year's Chaparral editor. Copies of
the guidelines are to be given to the
Office of Student Affairs and the
Chaparral, a campus humor maga
zine.
Herbst said he and Dew were also
told to write letters of apology to the
ASSU Senate.
"These were the recommen
dations that (Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs) Diana Conklin made to
President Kennedy," he explained.
But Kennedy added penalties to
Conklin's recommendations, Herbst
said.
Herbst said he and Dew were
given a choice of paying $50 or per
forming 10 hours of community ser

vicc. Weinstein, who wrote a letter
of apology to the senate the clay after
the incident, was given a lighter
penalty: $25 or five hours of com
munity service.
Herbst said he was "a little
surprised that Donald Kennedy was
the most upset by the incident. . . .
His response to her (Conklin's)
recommendations was that [the
punishment] was too weak," he
said.
The three received official notice
of their punishment last week in a
copy of Kennedy's response to Con
klin's recommendations, said Dew.
University policy stipulates that
the president makes the final deci
sion on disciplinary cases after con
sidering the recommendations of
other administrators.
On May 28 several membfers of
the Chaparral staff entered the year's
final ASSU Senate meeting at the
Law School and proceeded to throw
whipped-cream pies at the senators.
Police were called when fights broke
out between some senators and pie
throwers, but no criminal charges
were filed.
Until all the conditions of the
punishment are met, Herbst will not
receive his diploma and Dew and
Weinstein will not be reinstated as
students, said Herbst.
