# Engineering School is tops
## Stanford trains largest number of engineers in nation 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
The Stanford School of Engineering awarded 861 ad
vanced engineering degrees in 1985, more than any
other school in the country.
Engineering School Assoc. Dean Robert Eustis said
he is pleased with the current size of the program.
"We are large, but we're about where we want to be,"
said Eustis, a mechanical engineering professor.
The school conferred 141 doctoral degrees, 699
master's degrees and 23 professional engineering degrees
last year, Eustis said. A professional engineering degree
requires a master's degree plus a short thesis and an ad
ditional year of coursework and research.
Being the country's largest engineering school is not

the institution's top priority, Eustis said. The school's
main goal is to have a top quality program, not the big
gest, he added.
Though the School of Engineering "doesn't try to
recruit large numbers (of engineers), we do try to recruit
the very best," he said.
Stanford attracts the most qualified master's candi
dates by offering financial assistance in the form of Stan
ford fellowships, Eustis said. Top doctoral candidates
who choose Stanford are given jobs as assistants on re
search projects conducted by Engineering School pro
fessors. Because the research program here is large,
Stanford is able to attract a substantial number of doc
toral candidates through these opportunities, he said.
Eustis said he thinks the chance
to do research attracts master's can
didates as well as doctoral candidates
to Stanford.
Some of the 45 units needed to
complete a master's degree may be
credited through research projects.
The 45-unit requirement itself
may also persuade some students to
choose Stanford, Eustis said. This
program can usually be completed
in one year, while comparable pro
grams at other universities usually
take longer, he said.
Engineering students also choose
Stanford over competing institutions
because it is a "university, not a
school of engineering," Eustis said.
The Engineering School sells itself
as a ''School of Engineering within a
first class total university," he said.
According to Eustis, this diversity
is one of the advantages that Stan
ford has over its top competitor for
enrollees, the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology (MIT). MIT
awarded 831 advanced engineering
degrees in 1985, according to the
Engineering Manpower Commis
sion.
Although Stanford's 20-to-l stu
dent/faculty ratio is higher than that
of many of its competitors, Eustis
said he believes "the Stanford fac
ulty work harder."
