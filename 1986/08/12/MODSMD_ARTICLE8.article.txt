# Engineering School is tops
## Stanford trains largest number of engineers in nation 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
The Stanford School of Engineering awarded 861 ad
vanced engineering degrees in 1985, more than any
other school in the country.
Engineering School Assoc. Dean Robert Eustis said
he is pleased with the current size of the program.
"We are large, but we're about where we want to be,"
said Eustis, a mechanical engineering professor.
The school conferred 141 doctoral degrees, 699
master's degrees and 23 professional engineering degrees
last year, Eustis said. A professional engineering degree
requires a master's degree plus a short thesis and an ad
ditional year of coursework and research.
Being the country's largest engineering school is not

the institution's top priority, Eustis said. The school's
main goal is to have a top quality program, not the big
gest, he added.
Though the School of Engineering "doesn't try to
recruit large numbers (of engineers), we do try to recruit
the very best," he said.
Stanford attracts the most qualified master's candi
dates by offering financial assistance in the form of Stan
ford fellowships, Eustis said. Top doctoral candidates
who choose Stanford are given jobs as assistants on re
search projects conducted by Engineering School pro
fessors. Because the research program here is large,
Stanford is able to attract a substantial number of doc
toral candidates through these opportunities, he said.
