## South African court topples 2 detention provisions 
### 
JOHANNESBURG — A provincial court yesterday struck
down two provisions that permit detentions under the state of
emergency imposed June 12, raising the possibility that
thousands of people could be freed.
South African President Pieter Botha's government reserved
the right to appeal the ruling, issued in Durban by a three
judge panel of the Natal province supreme court. Anti
apartheid leaders said they feared the government would try to
negate the decision through executive action.
The court challenge was filed on behalf of Solomon
Tsenoli, publicity secretary in the Durban area for the United
Democratic Front, the largest coalition against the apartheid
policy of race discrimination.
Tsenoli, who was released after the court decision, was
among thousands of activists detained without charge under
the emergency.
Although the court order technically applies only to Tsenoli,
his lawyers said they would demand the release of all the esti
mated 500 detainees in Natal. Separate challenges must be
filed in the other three provinces to request the release of
detainees there.

Government officials will not say how many people have
been jailed under the emergency.
The opposition Progressive Federal Party said yesterday the
total is at least 5,900 and could be as high as 12,000. Max
Coleman, a leader of a monitoring group called Detainees
Parents Support Committee, said its latest estimate was 8,000.
judges in the Natal court accepted arguments by Tsenoli's
lawyers that Botha exceeded his powers in two subsections of
the emergency regulations.
One empowers any member of the security forces to detain
anyone under the regulations if the detention is deemed
"necessary to the maintenance of public order. " The other per
mits the law and order minister to extend the detention for the
duration of the emergency.
According to the court, the provisions could be construed as
meaning "every common criminal might be considered a
threat to the safety of the public and liable as such to be
detained summarily for the duration of the state of emer
gency."
Coleman said he saw no reason why another panel of the
Natal court would reverse the decision on appeal, but added

that the government might try to "neutralize" it through ad
ministrative action. Botha did so recently in amending emer
gency regulations that courts declared invalid.
Dr. Nthatho Motlana, a community leader in the Soweto
black township outside Johannesburg, said the Natal case
"illustrates how power-drunk the government is in thinking it
can detain as it pleases without even observing the laws that it
makes."
He said the government may amend the regulations to get
around the court ruling and validate the detentions
retroactively.
Publishers of South Africa's major English-language
newspapers went to the Natal court yesterday to challenge
emergency press restrictions.
Their suit contends that Botha exceeded his authority in
prohibiting publication of photographs depicting incidents of
unrest and barring the quotation of vaguely defined "subversive
statements."
It also challenges a section that authorizes banning or sei
zure of newspapers and other publications, which it says gives
"subjective discretion" to those taking such steps.
