## Senate adds to sanctions Ban on South African textile imports put on list 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate, making clear it
is ready to step up economic pressure against South
Africa's white minority government, voted 67-29 yes
terday to add a ban on imported South African
textiles to the sanctions list.
But in a narrow, 51-48 test vote, the Senate killed
an amendment by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
that would have markedly toughened South African
sanctions, including tightened financial restrictions
and bans on the import of South African iron, steel
and agricultural products.
Senators balked, 58-41, at a proposal endorsed by
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to give
President Reagan specific authority to sell U.S. gold
stocks in a bid to depress the price South Africa
receives for gold, its most important product.
But on another issue, the Senate was of one mind
as it voted 99-0 to remove from the bill a section that
permitted U.S. visas to be issued to South African of
ficials only on a case-by-case basis. It acted after Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) argued that the step was
a violation of the traditional American insistence on
the freedom of travel.
The roll call on the Kennedy amendment
represented a major test'vote for senators seeking the
strongest possible sanctions against South Africa.
But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, pleaded for the rejec
tion of the Kennedy amendment saying that
stronger sanctions would erode support for the bill.
Kennedy's amendment would have tightened re

strictions on new bank credit for South Africa in or
der to close loopholes that, according to the senator,
exempt 80 percent of financial transactions from the
sanctions bill's ban on new bank loans.
The sanctions the panel would impose include:
barring U.S. landing rights to South African Airways;
prohibiting new investment or bank loans; banning
the import of South African uranium and coal; and
barring the import of products produced by industries
owned or controlled by the South African govern
ment.
Reagan is considered likely to veto any sanctions
legislation.
The committee proposal sets objectives that would
permit sanctions to be lifted: the ending of the cur
rent state of emergency: the release of African Na
tional Congress leader Nelson Mandela; the disman
tling of apartheid; or the beginning of negotiations
with black leaders toward the creation of a non-racial
democracy.
Textile imports became a symbol of that effort
when it became known last month that the Reagan
Administration had signed a new textile agreement
with South Africa in the midst of the controversy over
both apartheid and over the loss of U.S. textile indus
try jobs due to foreign imports.
Lugar contended that a ban on South African
textiles would do nothing to weaken the apartheid
system but would cost the jobs of thousands of black
textile workers.
