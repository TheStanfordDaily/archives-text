# Rehnquist, Scalia pass panel inquiry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Senate
Judiciary Committee voted 13 to 5
yesterday to approve William
Rehnquist's nomination to be the
16th chief justice of the United
States, then gave unanimous ap
proval to Antonin Scalia to fill
Rehnquist's current seat on the Su
preme Court.
Although Rehnquist appears
assured of majority support when
the Senate takes up his nomination
in early September, two Democrats
are considering a filibuster and civil
rights groups have vowed an all-out
floor fight against the 15-year vet
eran of the high court.
Opposition to Rehnquist came
from five of the committee's eight
Democrats â€” Joseph Biden Jr.
(Del.), Edward Kennedy (Mass.),
Howard Metzenbaum (Ohio), Paul
Simon (111.) and Patrick Leahy (Vt.).
Rehnquist survived the most
grueling confirmation hearings for a
Supreme Court nominee since the
Senate rejected two of President
Richard Nixon's candidates for the
court, G. Harrold Carswell and Cle
ment Haynsworth. A number of
senators praised Rehnquist as a bril
liant legal scholar and judge.
"He came out of the hearings

stronger than when he went in,"
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.) said.
"Justice Rehnquist had everything
but the kitchen sink literally thrown
at him in . . . these hearings."
Committee Republicans com
plained that Rehnquist had been
criticized unfairly. Sen. Alan
Simpson (R-Wyo.) called the con
firmation hearings "a puerile exer
cise in justice-bashing" that has
"sullied and trashed" the Senate's
standards.
Kennedy recited criticisms that
opponents of Rehnquist's confirma
tion plan to take to the floor. "The
record of Mr. Rehnquist contains
overwhelming and shocking
evidence of his intense, lifelong hos
tility ... to the claims for racial
justice," Kennedy said. "He is
wrong on equal rights for women,
wrong on separation of church and
state, wrong on basic individual
freedoms under the First Amend
ment."
Several senators said confirmation
of Rehnquist, 61, and Scalia, 50,
would not change the political bal
ance on the nine-member court, but
expressed concern that future
nominations might push the court
too far to the right.
