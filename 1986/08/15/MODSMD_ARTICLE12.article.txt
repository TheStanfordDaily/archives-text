U.S. to fight drugs at border
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration
yesterday announced a massive new campaign to halt
the flow of drugs across the Mexican border.
But the new vow of cooperation from Mexico
came amid the disclosure that a U.S. drug agent had
been detained by police in Guadalajara.
Jalisco state police took Victor Cortez Jr, an agent
with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),
into custody Wednesday, but set him free after he
was identified as a U.S. government agent, said
Francisco Fonseca, a spokesman for the Mexican at
torney general's office.
But Terry Burke, special agent in charge of the
DEA's Phoenix, Ariz., office, charged that Cortez
had been kidnapped, "apparently from a public
place," and beaten.
The incident was divulged as Mexican President
Miguel de la Madrid was concluding a two-day offi
cial visit to Washington.
U.S. officials said the new interdiction program
along the U.S.-Mexican border would be carried out
with the cooperation of the Mexican government,
and that it will include hundreds of new federal
agents and millions of dollars worth of sophisticated
equipment.
But in an appearance at the National Press Club,
de la Madrid denied reports that he may permit U.S.
aircraft to cross the Mexican border in pursuit of air
borne drug traffickers.
Reagan to order 4th shuttle
WASHINGTON — President Reagan intends to
announce in his weekly radio broadcast tomorrow
that he has decided to order that a fourth space
shuttle orbiter be built to replace Challenger and that
he will pay for it by drawing from other space agency
programs, Administration officials said yesterday.
Reagan's decision comes after a long internal Ad
ministration struggle about the future of the space
program.
Officials said construction of the $2.8 billion or
biter would be financed initially with money saved
from the cancellation of shuttle flights this year,
postponement or cancellation of some space agency
science projects and a slowdown in spending on the

manned space station project.
Reagan plans to propose first-year spending from
these sources of about $200 million for the new
shuttle, officials said, but will not seek additional
money from Congress this year.
Local 'escort' service raided
SAN JOSE — Vice detectives broke up a sophisti
cated prostitution ring that kept computerized dos
siers on 12,000 businessmen visiting Northern Cali
fornia from around the world, police said yesterday.
The ring, based in a Victorian building two blocks
from police headquarters in San Rafael, employed
117 prostitutes who carried credit card imprinters to
allow customers to charge the $160 an hour "escort
service" on Visa or MasterCard accounts, police said.
The operation took in more than $25 million over
an eight-year period, investigators said.
"This was a highly sophisticated, well-organized
business," said Lt. Joe Brockman of the San Jose
police, whose officers led a three-month investigation
that included the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service,
San Rafael and Oakland police.
Two Tiburon women alleged to be managers of E,
E & L Enterprises, the parent organization of five es
cort services, were arrested on suspicion of pimping,
pandering and conspiracy after a raid Wednesday,
Brockman said. A man believed to be the kingpin of
the operation was being sought on the same charges.
Radon gas pervades homes
WASHINGTON — One of every eight American
homes is contaminated by a naturally occurring ra
dioactive gas that exposes residents to the cancer
inducing equivalent of smoking half a pack of
cigarettes daily, the Environmental Protection
Agency reported yesterday.
The report officially quantifies for the first time the
pervasiveness of invisible, odorless radon, which
comes from uranium deposits in rock and soil and
seeps into homes through cracks in the foundation.
Once regarded as a public health problem
confined to the uranium mining towns of the West,
radon has been found in high concentrations along
the East Coast from Maine to Florida.
