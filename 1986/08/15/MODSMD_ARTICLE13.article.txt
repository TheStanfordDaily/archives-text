Political violence erupts in Pakistan
LAHORE, Pakistan â€” Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was ar
rested in Karachi and at least four persons were killed by gunfire here
yesterday in Pakistan's bloodiest outbreak of political violence in three
years.
Bhutto, before her arrest, vowed to open a campaign to bring down
the government of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
Hundreds of opposition leaders were arrested Wednesday in an
ticipation of the protests that had been scheduled for yesterday, then
banned by the authorities. Until now, politics generally had been
open and peaceful since martial law was lifted last December.
President Reagan, receiving Prime Minister Mohammed Khan
Junejo in Washington last month, described him as a leader "of a con
stitutional government" and praised Pakistan as "one of our country's
closest partners.''
