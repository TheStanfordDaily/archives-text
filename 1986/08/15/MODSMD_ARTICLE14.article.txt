Stanford prides itself on its Honor Code, the symbol of responsibil
ity and integrity. To weaken it threatens the trust that exists between
students and faculty.
Yet, recently proposed mandatory drug-testing of University ath
letes threatens to blacken this pledge of honesty.
In fact, it reeks ofOrwellian mistrust.
NCAA regulations now require all athletes competing in post
season championships to participate in tests for drugs, including mari
juana, stimulants, anabolic steroids, diuretics and alcohol.
Under pressure from the NCAA, eight Pac-10 universities have in
stituted drug-testing programs. And Stanford has little choice but to
join them.
I he NCAA will disqualify entire teams from post-season competi
tion if just one member tests positive for drugs. Stanford officials speak
of in-house testing as protection for the University against disqualifica
tion.
Indeed, the NCAA seems to have discovered the staggering drug
problem that confronts the United States.
But is drug-testing the solution?
Singling out any one section of the student population is funda
mentally unfair. Whos to say that athletes use drugs more often than
say, English majors or members of student government?
And such mandatory drug-testing of one particular group falls flat
on legal grounds. A New York State appellate court ruled this week
that compelling untenured teachers to undergo tests without
reasonable suspicion that they are drug users is an invasion of privacy
and thus unconstitutional.
I he court ruled mandatory testing without suspicion would violate
Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure.
Instead of requiring tests for all our athletes, why not let team mem
bers decide whether the team should be tested.
Internal trust — and risking a forfeit of major competition — is a far
better solution than invading every team member's privacy to make
sure drug users stay home.
Leaving the decision to the student-athletes is the only alternative
that is in keeping with the Honor Code.
If teams do decide to test, guidelines should be set to protect and
help the athletes, hducational and rehabilitation programs — not
punishment — as well as confidentiality, should be provided.
The NCAA has made its rules and has backed us into a corner. But
Stanford still has a choice — and must exercise this option — to adopt
a policy that preserves the dignity and rights of our athletes.
