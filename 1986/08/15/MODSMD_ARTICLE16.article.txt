## Sightseeing vs. military service 
### 
If you have read any newspapers at all for the last few
decades, you must have seen an article on U.S.-Soviet
arms negotiations. And yet, there are no less arms today
than 40 years ago. Their number and cost are not likely
to decrease in the near future either. What do you think
all that research is for if not to create the need for better,
stronger, faster gadgets than our generation will build,
our children will pay for and our grandchildren (if they
are lucky) will dispose of to purchase an updated ver
sion.
We all know what the price tag looks like; long lines

to buy groceries in the Soviet Union, inner-city poverty
in this country, starvation in much of the Third World.
Why? Did you ever feel the need to go out and beat
up a few Russians? Do you think they would like to have
Americans for breakfast now and then? And yet, the
Soviets pay for their scrap metal-to-be, while we in the
"free world" pay for ours.
What do you think the average Soviet citizen is really
like? They may not have corn flakes for breakfast, but

I'm sure it's not bullets either.
If every young American citizen spent a year with a
Soviet family and vice versa, do you think that a couple
of decades from now it would he easy to spend yet an
other trillion dollars on arms? Wouldn't you like to
spend a couple of years in a different environment,
learning how to speak a foreign language, how to appre
ciate a foreign culture, while doing some sightseeing?
Or would you rather do military service?
The cost? Zilch. Actually, it would save you quite a
bit. You pay for your Warsaw Pact guest here; he pays
for you over there.
What about the military industry? Put your money
into something less capital-intensive, more labor
intensive, and more useful, such as much-needed
equipment for the Third World. Get rid of the deficit
and unemployment in the process.
Exchange costs money. Do you happen to know a
millionaire who can't decide whom to donate his
fortune to? Tell him about the idea. If you don't know
anybody of the kind, think about the idea next time you
vote or write to your congressman.
