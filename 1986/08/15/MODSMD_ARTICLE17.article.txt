# Please, tell me I'm dreaming
## 
### 
Sometimes having fun is just not fun. Especially
when you're all excited about doing something new with
a bunch of new people and expect everything will go
well, you are all the more disappointed when it doesn't.
When that happens, it becomes impossible to separate
reality from nightmare. Believe me, I had a dose of full
bore reality the other night.
T he evening started out innocuously. I was supposed
to go out to dinner and then dancing with a bunch of
friends in the City. We were to go out for Chinese food
and then hit this club south of Market to dance off our
almond chicken.

1 he dream began when I walked into the restaurant
with my girlfriend and told the hostess that we were
from the party of 14. She smiled and said, "Your
party is over in the bar." I saw the woman whom she was
pointing at, but as far as I was concerned, she wasn't in
my party.
After the whole gang arrived, we all sat down at our
table — all nine women and me. Talk about feeling
your masculinity. . . . There was one woman from
Paris who smoked too much and wouldn't look up
through her preppy glasses to utter a word; next to her
was a garishly dressed Italian woman whose red glasses
seemed to jump out from her face; to my right was a
native of Toronto who wanted to borrow my car that
weekend to go to Yosemite; all the way across the huge
round table were several women with long, frizzy hair
wanting to order dumplings and eggplant. Thank God,
my girlfriend was at my side.
At this point in the night, I knew I was dreaming, but
I was intrigued with it all, so I rolled over and contin
ued. When I resumed, I found myself amidst eight
"diverse" women and only four dishes of food. God,
they ate like birds. Anyway, I leaned over to the waiter
and asked for a dish of mu shu pork. Maybe we didn't
look like the sort of people they would give the special
menu to.

Next, 10 men came in and sat down at a table next to
us. These are no ordinary men you would encounter on
an ordinary evening, no siree. They had come there to
play quarters and have a bachelor party. Wonderful.
After an hour of complete self-consciousness and very
little stimulating conversation, we got the check. Of
course, there were no fortune cookies. Even in
nightmares you need fortune cookies.
Next, I got in my car and started to make my way to
the club, which according to one of my companions was
"somewhere on 11th south of Market." Great. So, I got
to Market, yet I was handcuffed; every street corner had
a sign prohibiting left turns. I figured I was not commit
ting a felony so I thought, "What the heck," and took a
left after a few blocks. It was 10:30 p.m. with nobody on
the streets. That is, almost nobody.
Suddenly, what looked like an ambulance pulled up
really close behind me, and I pulled over to let it go by.
It didn't want to go by, however. It wanted to stop me.
Five minutes later I had a moving violation in my hot
little hand. I couldn't even argue this one. It was illegal,
but that doesn't mean it wasn't a rational, safe decision.
At this point, I tried to wake myself and escape, but
couldn't. All I needed was a squadron of policemen out
in front of the house telling me to get off the babysitter.
We found 11th Street, but we couldn't find the club.
There were three in sight, and two had names different
from the one we wanted. "Trask, there are a bunch of
weird looking people walking into the club with no
name," my girlfriend uttered. I looked over to the boun
cers, who looked just too cool for words, and decided
this had to be the place.
I here were a lot of people there, and even the group
that we had come with managed to find the bar. And
then there were the "members," people with that cool,
distant and lonely look that separates them from the rest
of the world. I looked around, and saw that the Parisian
was still smoking and saying nothing. The Canadian still
wanted the car. Ihe Italian wandered around alone,
looking at the posters on the wall.
God, it was fun. Everyone was alone, drinking a Bud
weiser, staring at the band while smoking a cigarette.
One girl from our group found a guy to talk to, but in
between pleasantries, they looked off into the crowd,
straining to think of something else to say. I really
wanted to wake up from the nightmare, but the
policemen just wouldn't leave the front of the house.

Sometimes having fun is just not fun. Especially
when you're all excited about doing something new with
a bunch of new people and expect everything will go
well, you are all the more disappointed when it doesn't.
When that happens, it becomes impossible to separate
reality from nightmare. Believe me, I had a dose of full
bore reality the other night.
T he evening started out innocuously. I was supposed
to go out to dinner and then dancing with a bunch of
friends in the City. We were to go out for Chinese food
and then hit this club south of Market to dance off our
almond chicken.

1 he dream began when I walked into the restaurant
with my girlfriend and told the hostess that we were
from the party of 14. She smiled and said, "Your
party is over in the bar." I saw the woman whom she was
pointing at, but as far as I was concerned, she wasn't in
my party.
After the whole gang arrived, we all sat down at our
table — all nine women and me. Talk about feeling
your masculinity. . . . There was one woman from
Paris who smoked too much and wouldn't look up
through her preppy glasses to utter a word; next to her
was a garishly dressed Italian woman whose red glasses
seemed to jump out from her face; to my right was a
native of Toronto who wanted to borrow my car that
weekend to go to Yosemite; all the way across the huge
round table were several women with long, frizzy hair
wanting to order dumplings and eggplant. Thank God,
my girlfriend was at my side.
At this point in the night, I knew I was dreaming, but
I was intrigued with it all, so I rolled over and contin
ued. When I resumed, I found myself amidst eight
"diverse" women and only four dishes of food. God,
they ate like birds. Anyway, I leaned over to the waiter
and asked for a dish of mu shu pork. Maybe we didn't
look like the sort of people they would give the special
menu to.

Next, 10 men came in and sat down at a table next to
us. These are no ordinary men you would encounter on
an ordinary evening, no siree. They had come there to
play quarters and have a bachelor party. Wonderful.
After an hour of complete self-consciousness and very
little stimulating conversation, we got the check. Of
course, there were no fortune cookies. Even in
nightmares you need fortune cookies.
Next, I got in my car and started to make my way to
the club, which according to one of my companions was
"somewhere on 11th south of Market." Great. So, I got
to Market, yet I was handcuffed; every street corner had
a sign prohibiting left turns. I figured I was not commit
ting a felony so I thought, "What the heck," and took a
left after a few blocks. It was 10:30 p.m. with nobody on
the streets. That is, almost nobody.
Suddenly, what looked like an ambulance pulled up
really close behind me, and I pulled over to let it go by.
It didn't want to go by, however. It wanted to stop me.
Five minutes later I had a moving violation in my hot
little hand. I couldn't even argue this one. It was illegal,
but that doesn't mean it wasn't a rational, safe decision.
At this point, I tried to wake myself and escape, but
couldn't. All I needed was a squadron of policemen out
in front of the house telling me to get off the babysitter.
We found 11th Street, but we couldn't find the club.
There were three in sight, and two had names different
from the one we wanted. "Trask, there are a bunch of
weird looking people walking into the club with no
name," my girlfriend uttered. I looked over to the boun
cers, who looked just too cool for words, and decided
this had to be the place.
