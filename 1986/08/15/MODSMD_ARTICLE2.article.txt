# Third chemical spill found in local creek

More traces of oil were reported
late yesterday afternoon in the flood
control channel of Matadero Creek
upstream from Varian Associates, a
tenant of Stanford Industrial Park, a
company spokesperson said yester
day.
Lab results that will determine
whether this spill also contains
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
will not be known for at least an
other 24 hours, said Gary Simpson,
vice president of Corporate Com
munications at Varian.
Simpson said the oil appears to
have a different consistency than the

PCB-contaminated oil reported in
the same location last week. He said
Varian will continue to take
samples.
No further traces of PCBs were
found from the earlier spill, accord
ing to lab reports concluded earlier
this week. Palo Alto Fire Inspector
Dan Heiser said yesterday.
Heiser said he is "a little
confused" as to the cause of this ear
lier spill.
The PCB concentration found in
the water last week was 0.7 parts per
billion. Seven thousand parts per
billion of PCBs constitutes a health
hazard and must be cleaned up, ac-
cording to Environmental Protec
tion Agency guidelines. PCB is
listed as a suspected cancer-causing
chemical.
A leaky storm drain at Varian
Building 2 was responsible for
leaking PCBs into Matadero Creek
in late June. Simpson said Varian is
in no way responsible for the latest
spills because the unidentified
source (or sources) lie upstream
from Varian property.
