# 'Female Transport' offers insightful challenge
## 
### ANDREW LISAC 
In a summer notable for the vir
tual void of challenging theater pro
ductions, it was a relief to review
"Female Transport," the current
production by City Lights Theatre
in downtown San Jose. It is, indeed,
challenging: the play should be
retitled "Female Trouble," for it
concerns the travails of six women
bound on a prisoner ship from Brit
ain to Australia during the time
when Australia served as the penal
colony in the British colonial
empire during the early 19th

century.
The women are chained, tortured
and starved. They must undergo the
most humiliating internal games
with their ship warden to salvage
some sort of dignity. That they find
any dignity at all is the crux of this
play, for these women are not an
gels. They have cheated, lied,
cardsharked and stolen their way
into the docket, and while they are
not fully aware of the impending
hardships, they must endure life on
the prisoner ship as it sets out to sea.
For the most part, playwright
Steve Gooch portrays his characters

as witless victims, first in the
clutches of their wayward mates
back home, and then in the more
sadistic clutches of the wardens.
Sarah (Allaire Paterson), the most
sympathetic of the six prisoners, is a
buxom young woman with a naive
penchant for pretty clothes and
pretty men — both of which ulti
mately land her in the clink. Once
on board, she tries to make the best
of things and finds herself attracted
to Tommy (George Coughran), the
fresh-faced cabin boy who finds her
special medicine (alcohol) when she
becomes seasick and later lures her

to bed. That these two must share
their narrow bed with two other
prisoners, and on one night wake up
to find a third prisoner hanged to
death from the rafters, is all part of
the unfolding drama.
When Sarah becomes pregnant
by Tommy, she must ultimately
decide whether to marry a young
man who has become hardened
toward brutality during his first
voyage, or to make her own way in
the world without him. She wisely
chooses to make her own way.
Paterson, a recent Stanford
graduate, handles this role with a

verve that is superb for a character
who must undergo the most dra
matic transformation of the female
characters — from comic flippancy
to embattled wisdom.
The other prisoners face similar
choices. Charlotte (Sarah Taylor) is
a riotous and foul-mouthed flirt,
who manipulates men to her bene
fit. Unfortunately for Charlotte, her
behavior attracts the attention of
Sarge, played wonderfully by Roger
Hooper, who is the sadistic and ugly
warden for the ship. Winnie
