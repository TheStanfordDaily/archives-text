# 'Female Transport' offers insightful challenge
## 
### ANDREW LISAC 
In a summer notable for the vir
tual void of challenging theater pro
ductions, it was a relief to review
"Female Transport," the current
production by City Lights Theatre
in downtown San Jose. It is, indeed,
challenging: the play should be
retitled "Female Trouble," for it
concerns the travails of six women
bound on a prisoner ship from Brit
ain to Australia during the time
when Australia served as the penal
colony in the British colonial
empire during the early 19th

century.
The women are chained, tortured
and starved. They must undergo the
most humiliating internal games
with their ship warden to salvage
some sort of dignity. That they find
any dignity at all is the crux of this
play, for these women are not an
gels. They have cheated, lied,
cardsharked and stolen their way
into the docket, and while they are
not fully aware of the impending
hardships, they must endure life on
the prisoner ship as it sets out to sea.
For the most part, playwright
Steve Gooch portrays his characters

as witless victims, first in the
clutches of their wayward mates
back home, and then in the more
sadistic clutches of the wardens.
Sarah (Allaire Paterson), the most
sympathetic of the six prisoners, is a
buxom young woman with a naive
penchant for pretty clothes and
pretty men — both of which ulti
mately land her in the clink. Once
on board, she tries to make the best
of things and finds herself attracted
to Tommy (George Coughran), the
fresh-faced cabin boy who finds her
special medicine (alcohol) when she
becomes seasick and later lures her

to bed. That these two must share
their narrow bed with two other
prisoners, and on one night wake up
to find a third prisoner hanged to
death from the rafters, is all part of
the unfolding drama.
When Sarah becomes pregnant
by Tommy, she must ultimately
decide whether to marry a young
man who has become hardened
toward brutality during his first
voyage, or to make her own way in
the world without him. She wisely
chooses to make her own way.
Paterson, a recent Stanford
graduate, handles this role with a

verve that is superb for a character
who must undergo the most dra
matic transformation of the female
characters — from comic flippancy
to embattled wisdom.
The other prisoners face similar
choices. Charlotte (Sarah Taylor) is
a riotous and foul-mouthed flirt,
who manipulates men to her bene
fit. Unfortunately for Charlotte, her
behavior attracts the attention of
Sarge, played wonderfully by Roger
Hooper, who is the sadistic and ugly
warden for the ship. Winnie
(Allyson Lightbody) is a proud
woman, who taunts everyone
within earshot just to demon
strate that her spirit cannot be
broken. Sarge locks her in a bar
rel and then has her brutally
whipped, which indeed silences
her torrent of expletives, but ulti
mately draws the other prisoners
closer to her.

Winnie's behavior creates a
tough decision for her nemesis,
Nance (Karen Liolios), who has
been promised special treatment
and commutation of her sentence
in Australia if she will act as
keeper of the cell and informant.
When Sarge forces Nance to
report Winnie by threatening to
take away her privileges, Nance
understands the cruelty of her
decision: to sacrifice a fellow pris
oner for her own doubtful bene

fit. Ihe female characters are
rounded out by a lesbian with tender
feelings for a troubled woman
named Pittv, who has been placed
in her care.
lhe real drama in the play,
however, does not derive from the
personal choices of the various
women, but rather in their inter
nalized, oppressive values and
cruelties toward one another. They
steal from one another — both
belongings and food. Their dialogue
is laced with acid comments, which
burn to the marrow, and finally they
are quick to seek any advantage they

may have over another prisoner with
a zeal usually reserved for upwardly
aggressive professionals in Silicon
Valley.
If you have noticed so far that the
lessons of this play have to do with
gender, class and the conflict of
property rights, you will not he
surprised to learn that Gooch con
siders himself, as director George
Forrester would have it, "a feminist
playwright."
One would have to say that this is
not a brilliant play, for it is too
heavy-handed at times and uneven
in tempo. But it is a very accom
plished demonstration of the various
levels of paternalism imbued in the
law courts, prisoner cells and the so
cial level of our own competitive so

ciety — a society which has been
bolstered repeatedly by the subjuga
tion of one group of people, be they
women, black slaves, immigrants or
gays — to an oppressive, controlling
class.
Towards the end, with Sydney in
sight, the female prisoners have not
endured the last of their cruel treat
ment or completed their prison
terms, but they have come a long
way toward understanding the
human condition. As light streams
through the grates of William
Pfanhl's beautifully designed set,
Forrester gives us a timely reminder
that the differences and problems we
see in the nature of other human
beings pales in the reflection of the
light at the end of the voyage.
