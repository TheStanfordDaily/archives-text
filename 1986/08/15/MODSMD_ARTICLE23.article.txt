REM
"Life's Rich Pageant"
★★★★★
Well, REM certainly has the gold
touch with us reviewer-types, but
what can you say when they turn out
an album like "Life's Rich
Pageant?" With songs like
"Hyanena," "Flowers of
Guatemala" and"I Believe You,"
you have quintessential REM. It is
the sound that their first LP
"Murmur" patented. Michael
Stipe's distinctive voice roams,
again, meshing with Peter Buck's
circular guitar riffs until neither is
distinct in that wonderful blend that
is their music. But the album is not
''Murmur" rehashed. The album's
first two songs make that clear with
their driving, harder-rocking sound,
partly fueled by producer Don Geh
man's touches of feedback. The beat
and vocals put REM's signature all
over them, and show that they can
skillfully branch into new direc
tions. In other songs such as "Fall
on Me" in particular, REM attempts
more complex song structures,
weaving in and out of three different
melody lines, and it works great.
This band can do no wrong. They
even throw in a version of a familiar
Greek tune in "Underneath the
Bunker" and turn it into a playful,
rollicking piece that makes you
wonder how they can get away with
so much fun. The clincher on the
album is their cover of "I Am Super
man." It becomes out and out psy
chedelia that rivals The Byrds. Their
harmonies are better than you could
think they were capable of, and the
drum beat builds and gathers such
force that it becomes a two-and-a
half minute catharsis. REM is one
of the few bands in the eighties who,
like U2, have been able to stake out
a new path in music, maintaining
musical integrity while also being

able to carry that sound further on
ward — avoiding stagnation. Great
band. Great album.
Bob Dylan
"Knocked Out Loaded"
★★★★
It's a hard thing reviewing some
one like Dylan, especially in light of
what he has already contributed to
music and the vision he has been
able to reflect. With that in mind,
we cannot ignore his past work as a
standard for comparison. In that
comparison then, "Knocked Out
Loaded" measures up as pretty good
but a little shabby. It is not an album
for a newcomer to Dylan, or even a
Dylan-dabber. For the fanatic,
however, it's still Dylan. He contin
ues with the same sound as on his
last album, "Empire Burlesque,"
but manages to turn up a few
surprises. He opens with two covers,
"You Wanna Ramble" and "They
Killed Him," the latter a Kris Kris
tofferson tune. You remember him.
He's the country singing Rhodes
scholar actor, who co-wrote "Me
and Bobby McGee." On side two,
Dylan co-writes all three songs; one
with Tom Petty — not so unusual;
one with Carole Bayer Sager — get
ting on the unusual side; and one —
the 11-minute-plus song and
story revolving around a Gregory
Peck film — with Sam Shepard.
Now that's weird. On the whole,
however, the covers come the
closest to being songs that you feel
like singing along with. Dylan's
raspy vocals are mostly raspy talking
through the album. Musically, the
musicians are shifted around quite a
bit, and none seems to find a groove
with Dylan. The mix becomes as
unsettling as Dylan's vocals. But
when you listen closely to the songs,
Dylan is still a great songwriter with
an incredible vision. Lyrically, he

can still shiver them timbers, espe
cially with "Brownsville Girl." The
album makes a couple of things
pretty clear: Dylan is still a legendary
songwriter and poet, but it's just too
bad he had to get old.
TTie Jazz Butcher
"Bloody Nonsense"
★★★★
Listening to this outstanding al
bum is like enjoying the good, lean
quality of a choice cut of beef; there
is simply no substitute for hearti
ness. "Bloody Nonsense" is nothing
but Grade AAA prime rib from the
fun and witty lyrics to the amazingly
well-engineered blend of very differ
ent musical styles.
Lead singer Max Eider, who has a
wonderful sense of voice control and
inflection, accentuates every word
with impeccable diction. He carries
each note from the depths of his
baritone range, up to sharp forays,
and then back down again into
deep, wallowing murmurs. His style
is reminiscent of early Bowie mixed
with a touch of the Meat Puppets or
Chris Reed (Red Lorry Yellow
Lorry).
Jazz, folk and post-punk influen
ces are all very evident, and each has
its own unique impact on the varied
musical arrangements. Light
calypso rhythm guitars (both acous
tic and electric) are supported by
jazzy percussion on some tracks.
One might accurately liken the work
to that of Aztec Camera or the Style
Counsil. Yet, an occasional set of
hollow organ chords lends a '60s
feel to this sound, as if the Doors
had somehow made a contribution.
Eider's style of sophisticated dirge
and the always superb bass playing
of David J (Bauhaus/Love and
Rockets) comprise the "modern
