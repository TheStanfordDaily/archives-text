## Walker's presence will be felt but other players may struggle 
### 
The big-name USFL players like
Herschel Walker and Kelvin Bryant may have
some significant impact on the NFL this year
in the opinion of club officials.
However, they see no major changes in the
NFL power structure because of the influx of
players from the idle USFL.
"I think Herschel Walker will have an im
pact, he's one of the best players in profes
sional football," Chicago Bears Director of
Player Personnel Bill Tobin said. "Same with
Kelvin Bryant. But this wild scramble to sign
USFL players is a farce."

will have an impact. . . .

sign USFL players is a
farce.'

In four days, more than 30 former USFL
players have signed with NFL clubs. Besides
Walker, Bryant, Irv Eatman and possibly Jim
Kelly, Tobin said 20 to 22 players at most will
be with NFL teams when the season begins.
"Many of the best players in that league
came out last year," Tobin said. "We got ours
out last year."
Chicago signed former Arizona Outlaws
guard Tom Thayer and former Chicago Blitz
tight end Tim Wrightman last season and this
year has contracted center Larry Rubens, for
merly of the Memphis Showboats.
The NFL owners overwhelmingly rejected a
proposal to expand their rosters from 45 to 49

players on Wednesday, but are allowing a two
game exemption for new signees from the
USFL to win NFL berths. Teams must reduce
their rosters to 60 by next Tuesday.
Along with Thayer and Wrightman, 77
other former USFLers jumped last year, in
cluding standout quarterbacks Bobby Hebert
(New Orleans) and Steve Young (Tampa Bay),
running backs Maurice Carthon (New York
Giants), Craig James (New England), and
Mike Rozier (Houston) and punter Sean Lan
detta (Giants).
Those players, according to New England
Patriots Director of Player Development Dick
Steinberg, will probably have a bigger impact
than most of this year's refugees.
"There's a whole lot of reasons those guys
will be better this year than last," Steinberg
said. "And the reasons are all obvious.
"They will come in ahead of where they left
off last year."
"They don't carry their Heisman Trophies
on their helmets," said Giants General
Manager George Young about this year's
USFL newcomers. "They have to prove them
selves just like everybody else."
Carthon gained a miniscule 70 yards last
year in the NFL, but he came over after a full
18-game, plus playoffs, USFL season. Rozier
was in the same boat.
Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke said
Washington's signing of Bryant on Wednesday
to a four-year deal worth an estimated $3 mil
lion is several large steps down Super Bowl
Road.
The Cowboys were happy with their con
tract with Walker, an estimated $1 million a
year for five years, but some say he won't make
that big of a splash.
"I don't think so," said CBS sportscaster and
former Oakland Raiders Coach John Madden
about Walker's influence. "I don't think he'll
have as big an impact as people say."
