THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. â€” Dallas
Cowboys President Tex Schramm said
Thursday he will not trade Tony Dorsett
even though the 10-year veteran running
back fumed over Herschel Walker's five
year, $5 million contract.
"I told him I didn't even intend to talk
about trading him," Schramm said after
meeting with Dorsett. "We'd never trade
Tony. He is too much a part of our organi
zation."
Dorsett said he wanted to be traded or
given a raise in view of the deal made with
Walker, a refugee from the hibernating
USFL who came to terms Wednesday.
Dorsett warned that if his demands were
not met, he could be a "disruptive force"
on the Cowboys.
Schramm told The Associated Press on
Thursday: "Tony would like to pull back
what he said. He feels sorry he let it flow
out. He didn't mean it. He was just mad
and being egged on by the media."
Dorsett, who receives an annual salary of
about $450,000 plus fringe benefits, agreed
he got out of control. However, he did not
apologize.
"My feelings haven't changed a great
deal," Dorsett said. "I had a nice conversa
tion with Tex so they would know where
my head is at and I know where they are at.
I think the contract surprised everybody,
and I showed some immaturity. It was a fit
of rage."
Asked if he would take back what he said
Wednesday, Dorsett said, "I would take
back yesterday. Instead of saying things

publicly, I should have gone behind closed
doors and I might have handled it a lot bet
ter. Today is a new day."
Dorsett did not repeat he wanted to be
traded but did not take it back.
Schramm said he and Dorsett "shook
hands before he left. Sure, he was still a
little hurt, but he'll be OK. He's a good kid,
a good man."
Schramm said things would be fine once
Walker gets back to camp. "Things will
calm down, life goes on," Schramm said.
Walker, who is expected to practice in a
Cowboys' uniform for the first time on
Friday, agreed to a guaranteed contract on
Wednesday.
Asked if he would renegotiate Dorsett's
contract, Schramm replied, "I feel com
fortable with his contract."
Dorsett, who had fallen into financial
trouble over several sour business ventures,
missed training camp last year until the
Cowboys' renegotiated his contract.
Dorsett had originally welcomed the
thought of playing in the same backfield
with another Heisman Trophy winner, but
was steamed when details of Walker's con
tract came out.
Schramm said he can remember grum
bling among the Cowboys' players when
Dorsett was signed in 1977.
"It's just a historic thing," Schramm
said. "Tony came in as the Heisman
Trophy winner out of Pittsburgh and got a
big salary and some of the veterans started
grumbling. It happens every year with
No. 1 draft choices. It's a fact of the game. "
