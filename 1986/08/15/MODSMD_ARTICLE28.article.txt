# New surgery, brace fight spinal disease
## 
### 
Doctors at Stanford Children's Hospital are using two new tech
niques to treat scoliosis, a curvature of the spine that can be potentially
disfiguring and even life-threatening
In one new treatment, a special brace stops progression of the curve
while the child sleeps. In another treatment, an advanced surgical
procedure lessens risks of paralysis.
The new Charleston brace designed by DOBI-Symplex is unique in
that it offers a more intensive treatment than its predecessors, cutting
the time a brace must be worn from 23 hours each day to about 10
hours each day, according to Dr. Lawrence Rinsky, chief of or
thopedics at Children's Hospital.
Until recently, all braces have held the spine as straight as possible.
The new brace, however, holds the spine "completely unwound in
the opposite direction" of the abnormal curve, said Rinsky, who is also
an associate professor of surgery.
Because of this awkward position, the brace is worn only at night
and the child must adjust to sleeping with it.
Another new treatment involves a new device in surgical correction
of the condition.
In surgery, small pieces of bone are shaved from spinal vertebrae
(and sometimes other bones). They are placed along the abnormal
curve of the spine, bridging vertebrae which otherwise are separated by
ligaments. With time they grow and fuse that section of the spine into
one solid bone.
A steel rod, replacing a cast or brace, is attached to the spine to hold
the bones straight while they fuse together.
