# Minority admissions drop
## Students and administrators move to reverse situation 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
Faced with a decline in black and Latino enroll
ments, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and stu
dent minority leaders are considering plans to boost
minority recruitment during the upcoming academic
year.
Although final figures will not be ready until next
week, jean Fetter, dean of Undergraduate Admissions,
said yesterday that representation of both black and
Latino students at Stanford each declined by 1 percent
last year.
Compared to last year's "record-breaking" number of
minority freshmen, this year there were 100 fewer
Latino applicants, and fewer blacks admitted to Stanford
chose to attend, Fetter said.
Black, Latino and native American students com
prise 18 percent of the current undergraduate popula
tion.

"Minority admissions are down, and that's a fact,''
said Rudy Fuentes, ASSU Council of Presidents mem
ber and a former coordinator of El Centro Chicano.
There has been a "dramatic decrease" in minority en
rollment, especially for the black community," Fuentes
said.
According to Fetter, it is unreasonable to expect an
increase in representation for these groups every single
year. "We have a fixed enrollment of 1,520 to 1,550 stu
dents" and are subject to fluctuations in the applicant
pool and types of students admitted, Fetter said.
"Stanford is one of the most successful selective uni
versities in the number of Chicano students enrolled,"
Fetter said. She attributed this to the large Latino popu
lation in Stanford's geographical area.
While "Stanford admissions are very good in compar
ison to the Ivy League schools," the Latino and black
communities would like to address the enrollment
