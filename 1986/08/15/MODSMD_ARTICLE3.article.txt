# Minority admissions drop
## Students and administrators move to reverse situation 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
Faced with a decline in black and Latino enroll
ments, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and stu
dent minority leaders are considering plans to boost
minority recruitment during the upcoming academic
year.
Although final figures will not be ready until next
week, jean Fetter, dean of Undergraduate Admissions,
said yesterday that representation of both black and
Latino students at Stanford each declined by 1 percent
last year.
Compared to last year's "record-breaking" number of
minority freshmen, this year there were 100 fewer
Latino applicants, and fewer blacks admitted to Stanford
chose to attend, Fetter said.
Black, Latino and native American students com
prise 18 percent of the current undergraduate popula
tion.

"Minority admissions are down, and that's a fact,''
said Rudy Fuentes, ASSU Council of Presidents mem
ber and a former coordinator of El Centro Chicano.
There has been a "dramatic decrease" in minority en
rollment, especially for the black community," Fuentes
said.
According to Fetter, it is unreasonable to expect an
increase in representation for these groups every single
year. "We have a fixed enrollment of 1,520 to 1,550 stu
dents" and are subject to fluctuations in the applicant
pool and types of students admitted, Fetter said.
"Stanford is one of the most successful selective uni
versities in the number of Chicano students enrolled,"
Fetter said. She attributed this to the large Latino popu
lation in Stanford's geographical area.
While "Stanford admissions are very good in compar
ison to the Ivy League schools," the Latino and black
communities would like to address the enrollment
decline right away, Fuentes said.
Stanford needs to gain the com
petitive edge in attracting applicants,
Fuentes said. The University still
"loses the majority of our minority
applicants to Yale, Harvard and
Princeton," he said.

"We are making every attempt to
address the legacy of underrepresen
tation of those groups," Fetter said.
Currently, the University is trying
several "innovative approaches" to
solve the problem, she said.
Fetter plans to meet with student
minority leaders next Tuesday to
hear suggestions and discuss ways to
improve minority admissions.
One plan, now in its initial stages,

calls for a student minority recruit
ment organization, Fuentes said.
The program, funded by the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions, the
ASSU and other various University
departments, will send minority stu
dents back to their "home schools
and areas" to recruit minority appli
cants.
In early September, the recruit
ment program will target high

school seniors, and during
Christmas break, it will shift its em
phasis to juniors and lower class
men, Fuentes said.
"The goal of the program is to get
minority students to apply not only
to Stanford, but to higher education
(in general)," Fuentes said.
Fuentes added that the program
will allow the University to reach
rural areas and areas of high

minority concentration where it has
previously not been successful in
recruiting applicants.
The recruitment program will
"use resources that the University
already has,'' such as videotapes and
publications, Fuentes said. He
added that it will focus on minority
students, though all students may
participate.
Fuentes warned of the dangers of
a decline in minority populations at
major universities.
A decline in enrollment inhibits
the progress of minority communi
ties, Fuentes said. Students who
graduate from elite institutions such

as Stanford strengthen their ethnic
communities by becoming profes
sionals and valuable social re
sources, he said.
"Minority students who attend
Stanford have higher social
mobility," Fuentes said.
According to Fuentes, Stanford
must consistently maintain the
numbers of its minority stu
dents. "You need to create a critical
mass (of minority students) so that

students can confront ethnic issues
and not be alone," he said. "At Har
vard there are 50 Latino students.
What can 50 students do?" Fuentes
said.
The need for higher education is
critical for minority communities in
California, Fuentes said.
Currently, "there are very few
black and Latino students in the
University of California system,"
Fuentes said.
