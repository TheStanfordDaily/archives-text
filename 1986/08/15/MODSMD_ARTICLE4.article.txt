In his one year appointment,

Ambrogi will serve two major roles:
pastor of Memorial Church and
dean of Religious Affairs for the
Stanford community.
Ambrogi, who said he is glad to
be on a campus again and thinks
"Stanford is a very exciting place —
now particularly," will also be a can

Ambrogi added he likes the way
University President Donald Ken
nedy urges students to take their
educational experience and relate it
to the world, and to be of service to
others.

"T hat kind of commitment at the
presidential level is exciting to me,
and I want to be part of that excite
ment," Ambrogi said.
Ambrogi would also like to in
tegrate discussion of religious values
and ethics into the various depart
ments, he said.
He said he has few definite plans
for his year as acting dean, adding
that he wants to listen and talk to
students, finding out their concerns
and ' 'how we at Memorial Church
can best serve those concerns."
In addition to his work with the
National Sanctuary Defense Fund,
Ambrogi has been involved in

numerous social issues such as
human rights in Central America,
nuclear arms, economic justice and
gay and lesbian issues.
Kennedy told the University

social conscience," Kennedy said.
