## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
Thomas Ambrogi, a leader in the
sanctuary movement and former
Jesuit priest, has been named acting
dean of Stanford Memorial Church,
effective Sept. 1.
Ambrogi, 56, currently coordina
tor of the National Sanctuary
Defense Fund, will replace Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, who is leaving his
post to become a Stanford visiting
professor of religious studies and a
member-in-residence at the Center
for International Security and Arms
Control.
In his one year appointment,
during which a national search for a
permanent dean will take place,
Ambrogi will serve two major roles:
pastor of Memorial Church and
dean of Religious Affairs for the
Stanford community.
Ambrogi, who said he is glad to
be on a campus again and thinks
"Stanford is a very exciting place —
now particularly," will also be a can
didate in that search.
Ambrogi added he likes the way
University President Donald Ken
nedy urges students to take their
educational experience and relate it
to the world, and to be of service to
others.

"T hat kind of commitment at the
presidential level is exciting to me,
and I want to be part of that excite
ment," Ambrogi said.
Ambrogi would also like to in
tegrate discussion of religious values
and ethics into the various depart
ments, he said.
He said he has few definite plans
for his year as acting dean, adding
that he wants to listen and talk to
students, finding out their concerns
and ' 'how we at Memorial Church
can best serve those concerns."
In addition to his work with the
National Sanctuary Defense Fund,
Ambrogi has been involved in

numerous social issues such as
human rights in Central America,
nuclear arms, economic justice and
gay and lesbian issues.
Kennedy told the University
News Service he considers Ambrogi
"a transdenominational theologian"
with "an outstandingly diverse
carecr in the church and the world."
"He will bring to Stanford a fine
combination of religious insight and
social conscience," Kennedy said.
Earlier this year, Ambrogi led a
delegation of religious leaders to
refugee camps in El Salvador.
From 1980 to 1984, he served as
executive director of the Commis
sion on Social Justice for the
Archdiocese of San Francisco.
Ambrogi helped lead the cam
paign for Proposition 12, Califor
nians for a Bilateral Nuclear Weap
ons Freeze in 1982. That same year
he also represented the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops at a
German-American consultation on
arms control at Bad 8011.
In 1984, he directed Religious Is
sues '84, a California political action
committee for discussion in
churches and synagogues of ethical
and religious issues relating to the
presidential campaign.
