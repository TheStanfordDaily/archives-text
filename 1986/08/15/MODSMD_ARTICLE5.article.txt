# Comet is fading out of sight ... but not out of mind
## FEATURES 
### SEAN GALLAGHER 
On any clear, moonless night in barren
plains and mountains, the ground is bathed in
a celestial light show from distant stars and
galaxies.
This past year, in the darkened outback of
Australia and the Andes mountains of Chile,
an unusual jewel of diffuse light appeared in
the skv: comet Halley (pronounced Ha'lee,
rhyming with alley).
For most in the Stanford area, however,
comet Halley was barely visible without a tele
scope or a decent pair of binoculars. Many
watchers say they were disappointed.
Several astronomers say the poor showing of
the comet was not surprising; the combination
of city lights and relatively large distance of the
comet from the Earth at closest approach made
viewing difficult. The sun further complicated
matters by blocking the view of the comet
when it was most spectacular. This did not,
however, detract from the wonder of seeing
comet Halley on its 30th recorded visit. Some

even had the pleasure of seeing Halley twice in
a lifetime. Its last appearance was in 1910.
But now the commemorative stamps and
coins have been issued; the return and near
hysterical selling of comet Halley is over.
With the comet currently drifting through the
constellations Crater and Sectans toward its
aphelion (farthest point away from the sun) in
the year 2023, we are left wondering, what was
all the excitement about? Why were so many
electronic and human eyes turned to Halley?
Although five to 10 comets a year arc dis
covered and 1,000 have been documented,
comet Halley is indeed unique. Its visits are
regular (every 76 years) and it is by far the most
active and therefore brightest of the predict
able comets, according to Nature Magazine.
New comets, those that haven't been seen
before, are the most active but cannot be an
ticipated. Halley was close enough to make ex
ploration easy. At the same time thousands of
telescopes on Earth were able to view the

sage of Halley's comet.
comet during the flyby of the
probes, allowing the two sets of data
to be compared. Comet Halley thus
provided an ideal opportunity to
begin comet exploration in earnest
for the first time.
The comet was "recovered" on its
journey toward the sun on Oct.
16, 1982, when two astronomers on
Mount Palomar in Southern Califor
nia detected the comet with the
Hale 5-meter telescope. This was
years after the English
astronomer Edmond Halley sugges
ted that comets make return visits
past Earth and successfully predicted
the return of the comet bearing his
name. In the following three and a
half years, five spacecraft were
prepared and sent to greet Halley.
Two Russian craft, Vega 1 and 2,
were launched from Russia and
named after the places they visited,
Venera (Venus) and Gallei (Halley).
Two Japanese probes, Suisei (comet)
and Sakigake (pioneer) were
launched from japan. Giotto, the
European probe, was named after a
fresco painting by the 14th-century
Florentine painter Giotto di
Bondone in which the comet is
depicted as the Star of Bethlehem.
Giotto was launched from French
Guyana in South America, further
emphasizing the international scope
of the Halley missions.
The United States participated in
the Halley program by using probes
already in place, such as the Pioneer
Venus Orbiter and the Earth
orbiting Solar Maximum Mission,
and by sending up sounding rockets
equipped for spectral analysis.
Locally, the NASA Ames Re
search Center at Moffett Field
turned the ultraviolet sensors of the
Pioneer Orbiter, now circling
Venus, toward the comet during the
period of Halley's closest approach

to the sun. Although Stanford re
searchers were not directly involved
with the Halley missions, many
people from campus went on treks to
the Dish and other areas behind
campus to see the comet in the
December and January night skies.
The combined efforts of
thousands of people and several na
tions provide an image of the comet
that is as strange as it is fascinating.
The comet is a potato-shaped, 15-
by-ten-kilometer body of frozen
water and carbon dioxide, covered
by a layer of material that renders its
nucleus one of the darkest objects in
the solar system.
The comet's surface temperature
during the flyby of the Vega probes
ranged from room temperature to
250 degrees Fahrenheit. As the nu
cleus rotated once every two days the
surface was warmed by the sun,
causing jets of dust, water and car
bon dioxide gas to be ejected from
the frozen interior through surface
vents at a rate of 50 tons per second.
The escaping dust and gases ex
pand out to form the coma, or at
mosphere, surrounding the nucleus.
As the gases continued to expand,
they became charged by solar radia
tion and were eventually carried
away from the comet by the solar
winds to create the tail. The comet
that we see is actually sunlight
reflecting off dust particles and the
glow of the gases interacting with the
solar radiation. During the comet's
approach to the sun, the Pioneer
Venus Orbiter "saw'" the hydrogen
atmosphere around comet Halley
expand to 25 by 35 million
kilometers to become, for a while,
the largest object in the solar system.
The massive amount of informa
tion gathered by both amateur and
professional astronomers is coor
dinated by International Halley
Watch at. the Jet Propulsion Lab in
Pasadena. Eventually, the Halley
Archive will contain all the informa
tion of the comet encounter in a

computer for easy retrieval.
But what will all this tell us?
Comets are thought to contain mat
ter from the very beginning of the
solar system and thus might give
clues about the origin of the solar
system and how a planet like Earth,
which supports life, was formed.
Comets also have something in
common with meteors and as
teroids, which can "hit" close to
home. That is, they occasionally
collide with Earth.
Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan ex
plore the possibility of a comet or as
teroid striking the Earth in their
recent book "Comet." They point
out that "once every million years or
so, a comet or asteroid a kilometer
across will by chance run into the
Earth. The impact energy would
now be about 10,000

megatons This is only a little
less than the cumulative yield of all
the nuclear weapons that humans
seem generally content to have
sharing the planet with them." A
similar impact may have led to the
extinction of the dinosaurs 65 mil
lion years ago and the destruction of
a forest in Siberia in 1908.
Remnants of comet Halley have
also been left behind in the form of
the Eta Aquarids and Orionids
meteor showers. Given sufficient
knowledge of the physical nature of
comets and asteroids and their loca
tion throughout the solar system, it
might be possible to move a threat
ening comet off course, should one
pay us a less than neighborly visit.
This has been the subject of
numerous books, a recent movie
and a student project at MIT called
Icarus.

Comet research will therefore
continue for many reasons. The Jet
Propulsion Lab and NASA are cur
rently planning the Comet Rendez
vous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) for a
visit in the early 1990s to asteroids
1415 Malautra and 46 Hestia as well
as to comet Temple 2. The informa
tion from CRAF will be gleaned
from a variety of instruments that in
clude a probe to be fired into the
surface of Temple 2.
For the time being comet Halley
remains a recent and beautiful
memory. Perhaps members of the
freshman class at Stanford, and cer
tainly those who are younger, will
remember the 1985-1986 apparition
of comet Halley when they see it for
a second time in the summer of
2061. As for the rest of us, we must
be content for a once in a lifetime
experience.

Halley's comet, which appears once every 76 years, recently disappeared from view here last May.
On any clear, moonless night in barren
plains and mountains, the ground is bathed in
a celestial light show from distant stars and
galaxies.
This past year, in the darkened outback of
Australia and the Andes mountains of Chile,
an unusual jewel of diffuse light appeared in
the skv: comet Halley (pronounced Ha'lee,
rhyming with alley).
For most in the Stanford area, however,
comet Halley was barely visible without a tele
scope or a decent pair of binoculars. Many
watchers say they were disappointed.
Several astronomers say the poor showing of
the comet was not surprising; the combination
of city lights and relatively large distance of the
comet from the Earth at closest approach made
viewing difficult. The sun further complicated
matters by blocking the view of the comet
when it was most spectacular. This did not,
however, detract from the wonder of seeing
comet Halley on its 30th recorded visit. Some

even had the pleasure of seeing Halley twice in
a lifetime. Its last appearance was in 1910.
But now the commemorative stamps and
coins have been issued; the return and near
hysterical selling of comet Halley is over.
With the comet currently drifting through the
constellations Crater and Sectans toward its
aphelion (farthest point away from the sun) in
the year 2023, we are left wondering, what was
all the excitement about? Why were so many
electronic and human eyes turned to Halley?
Although five to 10 comets a year arc dis
covered and 1,000 have been documented,
comet Halley is indeed unique. Its visits are
regular (every 76 years) and it is by far the most
active and therefore brightest of the predict
able comets, according to Nature Magazine.
New comets, those that haven't been seen
before, are the most active but cannot be an
ticipated. Halley was close enough to make ex
ploration easy. At the same time thousands of
telescopes on Earth were able to view the

comet during the flyby of the
probes, allowing the two sets of data
to be compared. Comet Halley thus
provided an ideal opportunity to
begin comet exploration in earnest
for the first time.
The comet was "recovered" on its
journey toward the sun on Oct.
16, 1982, when two astronomers on
Mount Palomar in Southern Califor
nia detected the comet with the
Hale 5-meter telescope. This was
years after the English
astronomer Edmond Halley sugges
ted that comets make return visits
past Earth and successfully predicted
the return of the comet bearing his
name. In the following three and a
half years, five spacecraft were
prepared and sent to greet Halley.
Two Russian craft, Vega 1 and 2,
were launched from Russia and
named after the places they visited,
Venera (Venus) and Gallei (Halley).
Two Japanese probes, Suisei (comet)
and Sakigake (pioneer) were
launched from japan. Giotto, the
European probe, was named after a
fresco painting by the 14th-century
Florentine painter Giotto di
Bondone in which the comet is
depicted as the Star of Bethlehem.
Giotto was launched from French
Guyana in South America, further
emphasizing the international scope
of the Halley missions.
The United States participated in
the Halley program by using probes
already in place, such as the Pioneer
Venus Orbiter and the Earth
orbiting Solar Maximum Mission,
and by sending up sounding rockets
equipped for spectral analysis.
Locally, the NASA Ames Re
search Center at Moffett Field
turned the ultraviolet sensors of the
Pioneer Orbiter, now circling
Venus, toward the comet during the
period of Halley's closest approach

to the sun. Although Stanford re
searchers were not directly involved
with the Halley missions, many
people from campus went on treks to
the Dish and other areas behind
campus to see the comet in the
December and January night skies.
The combined efforts of
thousands of people and several na
tions provide an image of the comet
that is as strange as it is fascinating.
The comet is a potato-shaped, 15-
by-ten-kilometer body of frozen
water and carbon dioxide, covered
by a layer of material that renders its
nucleus one of the darkest objects in
the solar system.
The comet's surface temperature
during the flyby of the Vega probes
ranged from room temperature to
250 degrees Fahrenheit. As the nu
cleus rotated once every two days the
surface was warmed by the sun,
causing jets of dust, water and car
bon dioxide gas to be ejected from
the frozen interior through surface
vents at a rate of 50 tons per second.
The escaping dust and gases ex
pand out to form the coma, or at
mosphere, surrounding the nucleus.
As the gases continued to expand,
they became charged by solar radia
tion and were eventually carried
away from the comet by the solar
winds to create the tail. The comet
that we see is actually sunlight
reflecting off dust particles and the
glow of the gases interacting with the
solar radiation. During the comet's
approach to the sun, the Pioneer
Venus Orbiter "saw'" the hydrogen
atmosphere around comet Halley
expand to 25 by 35 million
kilometers to become, for a while,
the largest object in the solar system.
The massive amount of informa
tion gathered by both amateur and
professional astronomers is coor
dinated by International Halley
Watch at. the Jet Propulsion Lab in
Pasadena. Eventually, the Halley
Archive will contain all the informa
tion of the comet encounter in a

computer for easy retrieval.
But what will all this tell us?
Comets are thought to contain mat
ter from the very beginning of the
solar system and thus might give
clues about the origin of the solar
system and how a planet like Earth,
which supports life, was formed.
Comets also have something in
common with meteors and as
teroids, which can "hit" close to
home. That is, they occasionally
collide with Earth.
Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan ex
plore the possibility of a comet or as
teroid striking the Earth in their
recent book "Comet." They point
out that "once every million years or
so, a comet or asteroid a kilometer
across will by chance run into the
Earth. The impact energy would
now be about 10,000

megatons This is only a little
less than the cumulative yield of all
the nuclear weapons that humans
seem generally content to have
sharing the planet with them." A
similar impact may have led to the
extinction of the dinosaurs 65 mil
lion years ago and the destruction of
a forest in Siberia in 1908.
Remnants of comet Halley have
also been left behind in the form of
the Eta Aquarids and Orionids
meteor showers. Given sufficient
knowledge of the physical nature of
comets and asteroids and their loca
tion throughout the solar system, it
might be possible to move a threat
ening comet off course, should one
pay us a less than neighborly visit.
This has been the subject of
numerous books, a recent movie
and a student project at MIT called
Icarus.

Comet research will therefore
continue for many reasons. The Jet
Propulsion Lab and NASA are cur
rently planning the Comet Rendez
vous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) for a
visit in the early 1990s to asteroids
1415 Malautra and 46 Hestia as well
as to comet Temple 2. The informa
tion from CRAF will be gleaned
from a variety of instruments that in
clude a probe to be fired into the
surface of Temple 2.

vous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) for a
visit in the early 1990s to asteroids
1415 Malautra and 46 Hestia as well
as to comet Temple 2. The informa
tion from CRAF will be gleaned
from a variety of instruments that in
clude a probe to be fired into the
surface of Temple 2.
For the time being comet Halley
remains a recent and beautiful
memory. Perhaps members of the
freshman class at Stanford, and cer
tainly those who are younger, will
remember the 1985-1986 apparition
of comet Halley when they see it for
a second time in the summer of
2061. As for the rest of us, we must
be content for a once in a lifetime
experience.

Halley's comet, which appears once every 76 years, recently disappeared from view here last May.
