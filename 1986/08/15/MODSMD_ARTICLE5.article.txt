# Comet is fading out of sight ... but not out of mind
## FEATURES 
### SEAN GALLAGHER 
On any clear, moonless night in barren
plains and mountains, the ground is bathed in
a celestial light show from distant stars and
galaxies.
This past year, in the darkened outback of
Australia and the Andes mountains of Chile,
an unusual jewel of diffuse light appeared in
the skv: comet Halley (pronounced Ha'lee,
rhyming with alley).
For most in the Stanford area, however,
comet Halley was barely visible without a tele
scope or a decent pair of binoculars. Many
watchers say they were disappointed.
Several astronomers say the poor showing of
the comet was not surprising; the combination
of city lights and relatively large distance of the
comet from the Earth at closest approach made
viewing difficult. The sun further complicated
matters by blocking the view of the comet
when it was most spectacular. This did not,
however, detract from the wonder of seeing
comet Halley on its 30th recorded visit. Some

even had the pleasure of seeing Halley twice in
a lifetime. Its last appearance was in 1910.
But now the commemorative stamps and
coins have been issued; the return and near
hysterical selling of comet Halley is over.
With the comet currently drifting through the
constellations Crater and Sectans toward its
aphelion (farthest point away from the sun) in
the year 2023, we are left wondering, what was
all the excitement about? Why were so many
electronic and human eyes turned to Halley?
Although five to 10 comets a year arc dis
covered and 1,000 have been documented,
comet Halley is indeed unique. Its visits are
regular (every 76 years) and it is by far the most
active and therefore brightest of the predict
able comets, according to Nature Magazine.
New comets, those that haven't been seen
before, are the most active but cannot be an
ticipated. Halley was close enough to make ex
ploration easy. At the same time thousands of
telescopes on Earth were able to view the


Hong Kong and other countries throughout the world issued stamps commemorating the pas
sage of Halley's comet.
