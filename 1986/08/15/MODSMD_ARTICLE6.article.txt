# 'Coach of the year' goes to crew coach
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
Stanford Coach Ken Dreyfuss
has been named the Pac-10 Con
ference's men's crew coach of the
year for the 1985-86 season.
Dreyfuss' fellow Pac-10
coaches honored him with the
award because of Stanford's
"noticeable improvement in the
league last year," Dreyfuss said.
The men's varsity improved
throughout the year, Dreyfuss
said, citing the fact that Stanford
avenged two early season losses
and placed third in the finals last
year.
UC-Berkeley and the Univer
sity of Washington had the two
fastest teams in the Pac-10
Championship, but the Stanford
team represented the first real
challenge to the two perennial
conference powerhouses in
recent years, said Dreyfuss, Stan
ford men's coach for the last two
years.
The coach of the year award is,
in part, recognition of Stanford's
ability to close the gap between
the top two teams and the rest of
the conference, he said.

Dreyfuss also pointed to Stan
ford's successful hosting of the
first Redwood Shores Stanford
Rowing Classic, which featured a
challenge between the top three
East Coast teams and the top
three West Coast teams in a
round robin tournament, he said.
Dreyfuss attributed some of the
program's recent success to the
fact that the team was named a
varsity sport two years ago. With
varsity status, the team receives
25 percent of its budget from the
Athletic Department and has
access to the gym and other ath
letic facilities.
Dreyfuss was optimistic about
the team's chances next year.
"While it is a new year, if we
continue to improve there is no
reason why we can't be a con
tender in every race,'' he said.
He added that last year's suc
cess means the team will go into
the next season with an entirely
different attitude.
Before coming to Stanford,
Dreyfuss coached the freshman
crew team at the U.S. Naval
Academy. Dreyfuss was a mem
ber of the 1976 men's Olympic
crew team.
