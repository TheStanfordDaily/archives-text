Taiwan fellowships open to China scholars
Scholars of China are invited to apply for fellowships
for refresher language training and research in Taiwan.
Stanford has been awarded a grant of $150,000 over
three years to administer the Inter-University Program
for Chinese Language Studies in Taipei.
The grant, awarded by the Henry Luce Foundation of
New York City, will expand the existing fellowship pro
gram.
Beginning with the current year, about seven individ
ually designed six- to 12-month fellowships will be
granted. Fellowships average $1,500 per month; lan
guage instruction costs are charged to their grant funds.
Tutorial language instruction is provided by the pro
gram on the campus of National Taiwan University.
The program also provides fellows with office space.
The fellows' research is unrestricted as to subject or per
iod but must be work that can be undertaken in Taiwan.
Other support for this program has been provided
since 1982 by the Committee for Scientific and Schol
arly Cooperation with the United States, a part of
Academica Sinica.
New drug capsule treatment targets tumors
A new way of delivering tiny drug capsules directly to
a tumor has yielded encouraging results in animals with
cancerous growths, reports a team of Stanford Univer
sity Medical School researchers.
The technique is appealing because it delivers high
drug doses to a tumor, but should spare healthy tissues
from the drugs' powerful effects, said Dr. J. Ronald
Tacker, clinical assistant professor of medicine at Stan
ford Medical School.
The new method combines two still-experimental ap
proaches to cancer: tumor bombardment by tiny blood
borne packets containing anti-cancer drugs, and heat.

Because the method involves heating the tumor, it is
potentially most suited to localized cancers, l acker ex
plained. He and his colleagues are pursuing its possible
effectiveness against bladder cancer, a malignancy that
strikes 40,000 individuals each year in the United
States.
The anti-cancer drugs are packaged in tiny envelopes
of fat, called liposimes, which are injected into the
bloodstream and carried throughout the body. Millions
of the tiny spheres — each only slightly larger than a red
blood cell — can be administered in a single injection.
At normal body temperature, the drugs remain sealed
inside the liposomes. But at temperatures a few degrees
above normal, the microscopic parcels melt, allowing
the drugs to leak out.
Colleagues honor linguistics prof, with Festschrift
Charles Ferguson, professor of linguistics, was pre
sented with a two-volume Festschrift in recognition of
his contributions to the field of linguistics at a recent
meeting of the Linguistics Society of America in New
York City.
The work is titled "The Fergusonina Impact" and
subtitled "In honor of Charles Ferguson on the occasion
of his 65th birthday."
A Festschrift is a volume of writings by different auth
ors presented as a tribute or a memorial to a scholar.
Scholars from across the United States and from a
number of foreign countries, including Australia, Eng
land, France, India, Israel, Malaysia, Poland,
Romania and Switzerland contributed articles to the
Festschrift honoring Ferguson.
The project was kept a secret from the honoree for
two years, but a few days before the presentation Fer
guson's wife, Shirley Brice Heath, professor of English
and linguistics, told him what was going to happen.
"I was really quite bowled over," he said.
