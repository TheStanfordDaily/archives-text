# Service board plan gets campus support
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
A proposed board to oversee fund
ing for all University community
service organizations has gained the
support of University President
Donald Kennedy and various
service-oriented campus groups,
according to one of the proposal's
sponsors.
A community services board
would direct funding of organiza
tions such as the Barrio Assistance
Program or the Stanford MESA
Strivers' Program, said ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents member Rudy
Fuentes.
"I've talked to President Ken
nedy," Fuentes said. "We (the com
munity service groups) initiated the
idea, and he supported it."
The funding, which would be dis
tributed by the board, would prob
ably come from two sources: the up
coming University Centennial fund
raising drive and fee assessments, ac
cording to Megan Swezey, student
coordinator for the Stanford Volun
teer Network.
"President Kennedy has always
been big on community service, es
pecially during the Centennial,"
said Swezey. "And the feeling is if
community service groups got to
gether and presented one fee assess
ment rather than many assess
ments," the chances of getting voter
approval would be much greater,
she explained.
Kennedy, who is out of town, was
unavailable for comment.
Fuentes added that the board
might be able to get some non-
Stanford financial support.

An ad hoc task force will be set up
at the beginning of next quarter to
determine the actual makeup and
structure of the proposed board,
Fuentes said. After the initial board
is created, it would put a funding
measure on the spring ASSU elec
tion ballot, he added.
Fuentes said he is also working
closely with the Public Service Cen
ter and the ASSU in planning the
board's goals. "We'd like to include
as many different people as we can,"
he said.
"We want it to be something that
every community service organiza
tion has a say in," agreed Swezey.
Fuentes said he is optimistic
about the board's future even
though there are some obstacles yet
to be overcome.
"I think we won't have problems
(in organizing the board)," said
Fuentes. "(Though) we have to
make the Senate more sensitive to
community service organizations
. . . we have to change their atti
tude."
"There wasn't enough support
(for community service organiza
tions), especially from the ASSU,
and the Volunteer Network has had
problems getting funding," said
Swezey.
She said that, for many groups,
meeting the current ASSU require
ments for funding was "a hassle."
The advantage of organizing
community services under one roof
is twofold, Fuentes said. First, the
service organizations as a whole
would probably be able to get more
money to distribute to the various
organizations, he said. Also, the
entire community services network
would be more organized, which
would make the allocation of re

sources much more efficient,
Fuentes explained.
"We could act as a liaison be
tween Stanford and the surrounding
communities," he said.
Fuentes said he hopes the board's
creation will spawn new community
service organizations.
