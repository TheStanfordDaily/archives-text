# Part of Escondido Road to become walkway
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
The section of Escondido Road in
front of Stern Hall will be closed to
motor vehicles starting today in or
der to complete utilities construc
tion for a new Law School student
center.
After the two-week utilities proj
ect is completed, the section of Es
condido Road between Alvarado and
Arguello Roads will be converte3 to
a landscaped walkway and will be
permanently closed to motor vehicle
traffic, according to Don Hoppe,
construction manager for the Uni
versity's Hydro and Community
Facilities Division.
Plans for the walkway, named the
Galvez-Escondido Mall, call for
wooden benches, isolated grassy
areas and assorted shrubbery along
the path.
"The mall will look like the area
around Braun Music center,"
Hoppe said. It will be landscaped
and will contain bicycle and
pedestrian access, he said.
The design for the mall arose
from aesthetic principles, not safety
considerations, said David Perkin

son, University transportation
manager. The University commis
sioned the Madrone Landscape
Group to design the plans for the
walkway.
The University hopes to pave the
pathway by Sept. 24, "before the fall
quarter begins," Hobbes said. Ac
cording to the terms of the contract,
the construction team will complete
landscaping of the mall by the end
of October, he added.
The new mall will make the traf
fic situation safer by eliminating a
dangerous intersection on campus,
according to Hoppe.
The construction will eliminate
the intersection at Escondido and
Alvarado Road, Hoppe said. During
the academic year, the intersection
is dangerous because it is crowded
with pedestrians, bicycles and motor
vehicles, he said.
The recent completion of Sweet
Hall would only have worsened the
traffic situation, Hoppe added.
According to Perkinson, the mall
will eliminate two Marguerite stops
— one behind Meyer Library, the
other at Branner Hall.
"The overall impact (of the Mar
guerite route change) is minimal,"

Perkinson said. A study of ridership
counts showed that Branner and
Meyer aren't "heavily used stops,"
he added.
The Marguerite will no longer
take an "inner route" through Es
condido Road, but it will travel
along Campus Drive, Perkinson
said.
The Galvez-Escondido Mall will
permanently restrict motor vehicle
access to Stern Hall and Crothers
Hall from Escondido Road, Hoppe
said. When students move into dor
mitories this fall, the University may
create a "short, direct access route"
to Stern in order to make it easier for
them to drop off their luggage,
Hoppe said.
During the landscaping for the
new pathway, the grassy area in
front of Stern will also be
redesigned, Hoppe said. This sec
tion of the project, estimated to
begin in mid-October, could last a
week and would provide further
access problems to Stern, Hoppe
said.
But "contractors are required to
maintain access at all times," and
some sort of access will be provided,
Hoppe added.

The Galvez-Escondido Mall will
cover the area from the Center for
Educational Research at Stanford
on Alvarado Road to the eastern edge
of Stern Hall on Escondido Road.
I wo cul-de-sacs — semicircular

concrete barriers running from the
sidewalk — will redirect traffic away
from the mall from both Alvarado
Road and Escondido Road, Hoppe
said. The cul-de-sacs will have
wheelchair access, Hoppe said.


The striped portion of Escondido Road and Alvarado Road shown above
will be converted to a pedestrian mall.
