## Pentagon unveils $11 billion Army air defense plan 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon yester
day announced an $11 billion, 10-year pro
gram to develop an integrated air defense sys
tem to protect tanks and infantrymen from in
creasingly potent Soviet helicopters on the bat
tlefields of the 21st century.
The program — immediately dubbed "son
of DIVAD," in reference to the now-defunct
Sgt. York gun — is intended to plug the hole
in the Army's tactical air defense caused by the
failure of the earlier DIVAD to meet the Pent
agon's specifications.
Army spokesmen predicted that the system
would be in place by 1991, although they ac
knowledged that engineers have not yet solved
most of the technological problems that led to
the cancellation of the Sgt. York project,
which was usually referred to by military plan
ners as DIVAD, for division air defense.
Deputy Secretary of Defense William Taft
IV approved the new Army concept Thursday,

although the selection of basic hardware has
not yet been made. The new plan is intended
to integrate the front-line air defense role
originally assigned to the Sgt. York with other
battlefield anti-aircraft functions, some of
which can be performed with existing weap
ons.
The plan was made public only nine days
before the first anniversary of Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger's announcement
that the Sgt. York gun was "not wOrth the ad
ditional cost" of completing it. The original
project was scrapped after the Pentagon had
spent $1.8 billion on it.
The Army was somewhat vague on the
details of the new program. Spokesmen said
contractors will be invited to submit proposals
to meet performance goals. Because contracts
are expected to total more than $1 billion a
year, the competition is expected to be brisk.
To provide the front-line defense originally

envisioned for DIVAD, the Army plans a
combination of missiles and guns designed to
shoot down any enemy helicopters and fixed
wing close-air-support aircraft within the line
of sight of the gunner.
Lt. Col. James Starkey, chief of the Army
air defense team, said contractors will be asked
to submit proposals by next January and
prepare prototypes for a "shoot-off in Septem
ber 1987. He said 29 contractors exhibited
some interest in the project, although only be
tween seven and 10 of them appeared to be far
enough along to be expected to have
prototypes ready in 13 months.
The Army estimates that the system will
cost $3.5 billion over the next 10 years, about
the same amount of money that would have
been spent to complete the Sgt. York project.
However, congressional approval is necessary
for any funding of the new plan.
Unlike the canceled DIVAD, the new sys

tern will have no radar of its own. Radar
proved to be the weakest component of the
Sgt. York system because it frequently failed to
find a potential target and because modern
aircraft carry devices that can detect enemy
radar and fire radar-seeking missiles to destroy
the anti-aircraft gun.
Starkey said that the new system would have
only infrared "passive" sensors to help the
gunner find and hit a target. That should
make it easier to conceal the system from hos
tile aircraft, he said.
But passive sensors by themselves are not
nearly effective enough at locating helicopters
and other aircraft. To fill that gap, the Army
proposed a $2.5 billion command and control
program built around airborne radar carried by
helicopters, balloons or drone aircraft and
ground-based radar facilities that would spot
targets and pass the information to the anti
aircraft gunners.
