# Soviets extend nuclear test ban

MOSCOW â€” Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
yesterday extended the Kremlin's twice-prolonged
moratorium on nuclear testing until Jan. 1 and chal
lenged President Reagan to sign a test ban treaty at a
summit this year.
He said in a nationally televised speech that the
ruling Politburo had decided to continue the year-old
moratorium after weighing "all the pros and cons,"
including what he said were domestic calls to end it.
"On behalf of the Soviet people, I am appealing to
(he wisdom and dignity of the Americans not to miss
another historic chance on the way toward ending
the arms race," Gorbachev said, according to an
l .'iglish-language text distributed by the news agency
lass.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes, with the
vacationing president in Santa Barbara, Calif., said
the Administration had not seen the full text of Gor
bachev's speech but U.S. opposition to joining a nu
clear testing moratorium "has not changed."
"U.S. testing is needed to ensure continued
reliability, survivability and the effectiveness of our
nuclear deterrent," Speakes said.
Gorbachev began with a gloomy assessment of
S.-Soviet relations, apparently aimed at appeasing
noratorium foes. He cited the Chernobyl nuclear
accident and the U.S. space shuttle explosion as
proof of the need to end the arms race.
Addressing Reagan, he said, "The Soviet Union is

confident that agreements on ending nuclear tests
can be reached speedily and signed already this year
at the Soviet-American summit meeting.
"That event would, undoubtedly, become the
main real outcome of the meeting, a considerable
step on the way toward ending the arms race."
Gorbachev has proposed before that he and
Reagan meet to sign a test ban treaty, and it was not
clear if he was confirming that the Soviet Union has
decided to go to another full summit this year.
He and Reagan agreed in Geneva last November
to hold such a meeting in the United States, but the
Kremlin has delayed setting a date.
Meetings already held to prepare a new Reagan-
Gorbachev meeting include a two-day session of top
U.S. and Soviet arms experts here last week.
"The way out of deadlocks and confrontation goes
through dialogues and contacts, discussion and
talks," Gorbachev said. "This is the only method to
thaw the ice of mutual mistrust and achieve practical
results."
The moratorium began Aug. 6, 1985, the 40th an
niversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and
initially ran until last Jan. 1.
But Gorbachev prolonged it twice, until the end of
March and then until Aug. 6.
During the moratorium, America conducted 18
nuclear tests in Nevada. Gorbachev noted those ex
plosions in his speech.
