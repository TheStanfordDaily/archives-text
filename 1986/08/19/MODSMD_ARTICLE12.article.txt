CAPE TOWN, South Africa —
The South African government said
yesterday that it had detained 8,501
persons without charge since declar
ing a national state of emergency
two months ago and, breaking offi
cial secrecy on their identities, pub
lished their names for the first time.
As required by law, Louis le
Grange, minister of law and order,
presented to Parliament a 171-page
list of those detained, but he did not
disclose the whereabouts of any of
the prisoners, many of whom have
been held incommunicado since a
state of emergency was proclaimed
June 12.
The government list exceeded by
about 3,000 names the lists of
known detainees compiled by the
opposition Progressive Federal
Part)', the Detainees' Parents Sup
port Committee and church groups,
but it still did not appear to be com
plete.
Neil Ross, head of the Progressive
Federal Party's office that monitors

security detentions, said that the
names of some people who had been
released in recent weeks were on the
government list but that the names
of many others known to have been
detained did not appear.
The Progressive Federals and
other monitoring groups estimate
that more than 13,000 persons have
been detained under the emergency
regulations, although perhaps a
third have been released.
"For some families this list will
answer the question of what has
happened" to missing relatives, Ross
said, "but for others, who can't find
their relatives' names on it, the
question may be even sharper now."
The government Information
Bureau, sole authorized spokesman
on the state of emergency, said it did
not know whether the list included
everyone detained so far under
emergency regulations, which per
mit indefinite detention without
trial, or only those persons held on a
certain past date.
