Reagan to raise sanctions
SANTA BARBARA — President Reagan intends
to impose additional economic sanctions against
South Africa in an effort to head off more sweeping
sanctions already approved by Congress, White
House officials said yesterday.
The new sanctions would be contained in an ex
panded executive order that would also maintain
measures against South Africa initiated by the presi
dent a year ago under similar congressional pressure.
Administration officials said they believe stronger
sanctions than those already in place will be neces
sary to persuade Congress to let stand a Reagan veto
of the far more sweeping sanctions approved last
week.
The officials said that Reagan, who is on vacation
here at his nearby mountain ranch, has not yet selec
ted the precise sanctions that he will impose but in
tends to act soon after Congress returns Sept. 9,
about the time the original sanctions order is sched
uled to expire.
Firms to lift satellites by '89
WASHINGTON — Heartened by President
Reagan's decision to end the government's monopoly
on space, private companies have told the Adminis
tration they will rapidly invest tens of millions of dol
lars and begin commercial launchings of satellites in
30 to 36 months, officials said yesterday.
Reagan announced Friday that the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration will build a
replacement for the Challenger space shuttle, which
was destroyed in the Jan. 28 disaster that killed its
crew of seven and grounded the nation's space pro
gram. At the same time, however, the president or
dered NASA to get out of the business of launching
commercial satellites.
At a news conference yesterday, Secretary of
Transportation Elizabeth Dole said that private in
dustry officials had assured her that "they are ready,
willing and able" to fill the launching void left when
Reagan formally abandoned an original goal of the
shuttle program: to pay its own way by hauling com
mercial cargoes into space.

Creationism purge urged
WASHINGTON — Seventy-two American win
ners of the Nobel Prize in science urged the Supreme
Court yesterday to strike down a Louisiana law re
quiring public schools teaching evolution to teach
creationism as well.
In a brief filed with the high court, the Nobel
laureates and 24 scientific organizations argued that
the "creation-science'' mentioned in the state law is
really religion and has no place in science classes.
The brief represents an extraordinary organiza
tional effort by Murray Gell-Mann, a California In
stitute of Technology professor, who in 1969 won a
Nobel Prize in physics. He assembled the largest
group of Nobel laureates ever to support a single
statement on any subject.
The Louisiana Legislature in 1981 enacted a law
jequiring public schools to "balance" the teaching of
evolution with the teaching of creationism.
A federal trial judge, and the sth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals invalidated the law as a violation of
the constitutionally-required separation of church
and state.
But the Supreme Court last May agreed to review
the lower courts' rulings, setting the stage for its deci
sion sometime in 1987.
Gotti jury picking resumes
NEW YORK — Jury selection resumed at the trial
of reputed, mob boss John Gotti yesterday with
prospective panelists identified only by number to
avoid the publicity that one lawyer said made Gotti
"the most feared man in America today."
Frequent news stories about Gotti, reputed boss of
the Gambino organized crime family, thwarted U.S.
District Judge Eugene Nickerson's attempts to find
impartial jurors in April, forcing him to interrupt the
trial of Gotti and six co-defendants.
To hasten the process when it resumed in Brook
lyn, potential jurors were numbered and then
screened on the basis of their answers to numbered
questions. Nickerson said the process would protect
jurors' privacy.
