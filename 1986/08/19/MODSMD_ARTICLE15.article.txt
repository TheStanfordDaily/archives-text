Israel-Soviet talks skid to sudden halt
HELSINKI, Finland — The first formal talks between the Soviet
Union and Israel in more than 19 years ended abruptly here yesterday
when the Soviets declared that an initial, 90-minute session had been
"sufficient.''
The move came after the Israelis, in opening remarks, raised the is
sues of Moscow's treatment of Soviet Jews and its anti-Israeli policy in
the Middle East. The Soviets rejected both as inappropriate for the
agenda.
The meeting failed to answer the key question of whether the talks,
which came about as the result of a Soviet initiative, represented a step
toward change in the Kremlin's Middle East policy or were only a
propaganda exercise.
The Soviet delegation avoided contact with the scores of Israeli,
American and European journalists in Helsinki for the talks. A spokes
woman at the Soviet Embassy said that officials there would have no
comment.
Violence spreads in Pakistan clashes
LAHORE, Pakistan — At least 14 persons were killed yesterday as
violence spread through Sind Province in southern Pakistan on the
opening day of a revived opposition campaign to force the government
to call new elections.
The violence in the south, underscoring the volatile nature of poli
tical confrontation in Sind, the home territory of Pakistan People's
Party leader Benazir Bhutto, included clashes in Karachi and other
areas between activists of the Movement for the Restoration of
Democracy (MRD) and police and pro-government Moslem League
workers.
The bloody battles in Sind stood in sharp contrast to a peaceful
demonstration by several thousand activists of the MRD in Lahore,
