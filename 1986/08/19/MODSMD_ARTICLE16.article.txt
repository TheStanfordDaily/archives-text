Three State Supreme Court justices who face reconfirmation in
November have suddenly found themselves in the defendant's seat.
The piosecutor contends that the justices have decided in favor of the
criminal one too many times. The justices, who should only have to
survive the "good behavior" test to be reconfirmed, have now been
forced to defend their decision-making record as well as their integrity.
The prosecutor, a political action committee called Crime Victims
for Court Reform (CVCR), has focused its attack on Chief Justice
Rose Bird and Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph Grodin — all
liberals. But this political assault could mean much more than an
ideological shift in the California high court, for it threatens to un
dermine the autonomy of the U.S. judicial system.
CVCR has launched a million-dollar ad campaign to discredit the
justices, focusing on the fact that Bird, Reynoso and Grodin have
voted for the defendant — and thus against the victim — in 80 percent
of the cases they have heard.
But Justice Stanley Mosk, who is also up for reconfirmation in No
vember, has been spared the CVCR attack. Why? Because he has
voted for the defendant 72 percent of the time. As one CVCR
spokesperson said, "You might say that if Bird, Grodin and Reynoso
got an F on criminal cases, Stanley Mosk was more like a D."
Such reduction of judicial opinions to facts and figures is distress
ing. It suggests that justices should conform their opinions to a set pat
tern rather than consider the unique merits of each case. Periodic
reconfirmation was instituted to weed out incompetence, not to
punish justices who do not vote the "right" way.
In its ad campaign, CVCR laments the fact that under the Bird
court, none of the 55 convicts on death row has faced the gas cham
bers. But certainly a judge should not vote for the death penalty simply
to guarantee his or her reconfirmation.
The founding fathers separated the court from the political arena for
a reason: to ensure non-biased, sound decisions. Although the court is
supposed to respond to the people, it should do so by upholding their
laws, not by bending to pressure from special interest groups.
Unfortunately, the effects of the CVCR pressures could extend
beyond the Nov. 4 election and indeed surpass the boundaries of Cali
fornia. Since this state oftentimes leads the nation in legal trends,
judges in other states could start looking over their shoulders, weigh
ing the political clout of monied PACs in addition to the merits of
cases.
Not surprisingly, the three besieged justices are not doing well in
the polls. Now they must face a difficult decision; whether to wage a
political campaign of their own, contradicting themselves by running
on a platform that seeks to rid the courts of politics, or refuse to stump
for their cause and risk defeat.
Certainly crime is a serious problem in the United States, but at
tacking the courts won't solve it. Although politics always seems to en
ter the court in some way or other, CVCR has simply gone too far.
Asking justices to consider what is politically expedient instead of what
is legally correct seriously jeopardizes judicial integrity. If the assault
continues, the court system will soon have to take shelter under the
very legislation that CVCR applauds — the Victim's Bill of Rights.
