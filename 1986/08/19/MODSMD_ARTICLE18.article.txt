## School system promotes racism 
### 
"Who pays you to think?" my father used to ask when
as a hoy, I'd offer some input to a task he'd assigned.
Now I can respond, "Stanford is paying me, Dad," hut
the impetus is no longer present.
My childhood initiatives apparently were the begin
ning of a lifelong commitment to meeting challenges,
the most recent of which was severing a 10-year rela
tionship with the U.S. Army for a universally
recognized formal education at age 28. Although the
impetus to confront dear old dad with the facts of his
son's new found niche has waned, I'm compelled to

JERRIE BROWN

confront and relay my reactions to a few relevant and
contemporary issues facing our academic community.
After a childhood dominated by the confusion be
tween the limitations imposed on me by my father and
my own positive experiences in primarily European
schools, Uncle Sam had a 10-year shot at "spoiling" me
into American mores. The adage is certainly true that
the military system becomes one's parents because it
took up where my father left off in subverting my mind
by attempting to limit my expectations. But, alas, always
ready for a challenge, 1 did everything my dad said I
couldn't just as 1 repeatedly broke barriers and tradition
in the Army to create my own options and destiny. I also
became a 28-year-old college freshman at a Tradition
ally Black Institution (TBI) in the South.
Today, as a 30-year-old graduating senior from that
same TBI, I've studied abroad (Heidelberg); attended
several competitive academic programs at four univer
sities; and maintained honors through all.

Yet, I must gather my collective wit to confront once
again a seemingly new challenge. This society being
what it is (racist), I decided that a college education is
nice, but a Ph.D is imperative! And there are so few
minorities earning them (which brings me to the point).
The National Council on Education Statistics
(NCES) published their third annual report on
minorities and higher education last year, revealing that
our education system is as bankrupt as the rest of our in
stitutions.
I'm suggesting that it's futile to increase recruitment
or to take rather similar measures to remedy minority at
trition in higher education when what is needed is a
complete overhaul of societal values.
Black students, for instance, are just now seeing in
college texts some semblance of truth about the rich his
tory of their forefathers in this-country. It is common to
hear that we must study what "they" study in order to be
competitive. What about all those omissions in the
meantime?
Should the measure of my success in this society be
linked to how well I master certain untruths?
What is then, the purpose of this "education?" The
purpose of our educational system is the maintenance of
our unjust, racist society, as is the purpose of our legal,
political, religious and other institutions. Education
remains a very different game depending upon the color
of the player/student. Justice remains a very different
game depending upon the color of the
player/defendant. Politics remains. . . . Next, my
father will say, "If you're so smart, why aren't you
rich!?"
