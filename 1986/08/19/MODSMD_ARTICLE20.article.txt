## Questionable ethics 
### 
I should like to set the record
straight on some remarks I was
quoted as having made in the story
on reaction to the report of the Stan
ford Medical Center Ethics Com
mittee on animal use (Aug. 8).
I did not "equate the conditions
in which the animals live with a
concentration camp." I did say that
the air vent sticking up over the
parking lot under which the Re
search Animal Facility is buried is
reminiscent of a concentration
camp smoke stack. I hadn't invented
it at that. I copped it from two media
people invited for the facility's
opening who made that observation
in all the objectivity of their calling.
I did not say or imply that polio
would have been vanquished by
nutrition or fitness. I did take excep

tion to the beginning sentence of the
Campus Report story that said,
Important medical progress cannot
be made without animal studies."
First of all, we cannot know that
since it has never been tried, and
besides, a very good case can be
made for the very likely supposition
that greater inroads on heart disease
and cancer, the primary killers, can
be brought about by changes in life
style and environmental factors —
indicated by observation of humans
— than by forcing beagles to smoke
cigarettes or even heart transplants.
I did not say the Ethics Commit
tee was stacked. I don't believe it is
(at least, no more so than any other
University committee; I think none
of them go out of their way to attract
members not already in tune with
what, I believe, is called "the cul
ture of the institution").
The committee I said was stacked

is the Panel on Laboratory Animal
Care (P-LAC). It has been carefully
selected to represent on the face of
it, the full spectrum of relevant con
stituencies — the research faculty,
veterinary medicine, the commu
nity, the law, God and the student
body.
Rigidly excluded form P-LAC has
been even a single bona fide mem
ber of the humane community,
chosen by that community.
I did say that asserting the exis
tence of stringent safeguards govern
ing the use of animals is a lie. It is,
in fact, the Big Lie that the Medical
Center consistently and shamelessly
promulgates, all the more unfor
givably because they have a power
ful sense of what would constitute
such safeguards — meaningful legis
lation and inspection, for instance
— and instantly coalesce in
entrenched opposition any such bid

tair to come to pass.
In reality, there are no laws that
genuinely protect research animals.
State laws specifically do not. The
federal Animal Welfare Act deals al
most exclusively with the housing
and husbandry of animals, not their
fate during experiments. It does not
extend its leaky aegis to 95 percent of
the roughly 50,000 animals a year
used at Stanford, that is, mice, rats,
birds, cold-blooded or farm animals.
The guidelines of the NIH are
merely guidelines. They are essen
tially so meaningless that the NIH
contribution to Stanford since the
University lost its accreditation for
non-compliance with these
guidelines rose by some 44 percent,
from $44,511,192 in 1981 to
$64,240,190 in 1984.
And certainly the P-LAC lias
passed on enough futile, ludicrous
and redundant animal-abusing

protocols (that then got funded) to
shatter any pretense at its meaning
ful vigilance.
If the report was intended as reas
surance to a possibly skeptical
public, its untruthfulness makes it
reprehensible. If it was intended as a
pacifier to an ever-growing animal
rights movement, it has failed. So
will all such feints as long as Stan
ford persists in hermetically sealing
itself against participation by the
animal rights community, in the ar
rogant confidence that appearance is
a satisfactory substitute for reality.
According to the dictum that all
movements must undergo three
stages — ridicule, discussion and ac
ceptance — Stanford seems at last to
have made it to stage two. All it has
to do now is make that quantum
leap to three.
