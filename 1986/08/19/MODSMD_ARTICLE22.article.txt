## Bug: Hair today gone tomorrow 
### KIRK JENSEN JOHN POWELL Staff writers 
DEAR BUG ME: This question has been bugging me
for a long time. I often stay up until the wee hours of the
morning thinking about it. Why is it that males go bald
while females don't?
— Curly
DEAR CURLY: This tendency for men and not
women to go bald is indeed a mystery and a downright
injustice at that. Why should men have to live their
lives in constant fear of losing hair, waiting and waiting
for that dreadful day when the first bald spot appears?
Just think of the pain and suffering experienced in trying
to regain that lost hair: the tonics, the toupees, the
transplants . . . the tragedy. If this is nature's answer to
childbearing for men, however, we'll stop complaining.

It seems the balding phenomenon is still a mystery to
researchers. We first spoke to experts at the Beverly Hills
Bosley Medical Group, which specializes in hair
transplants and scalp reductions. Sam Annenberg,
medical liaison, told us that the most prevalent type of
baldness is known as "male pattern baldness," which in
volves thinning on the top of the head and a receding
hairline.
Annenberg could offer no explanation for why bal
ding occurs except that "it's genetic" and it appears to be
a recessive trait. He also added that this type of pattern
baldness is "very, very rare in females."
Annenberg also told us that experts no longer believe
balding is due to an X-linked recessive gene (which
would help explain why men bald and females don't).
We also contacted Dr. Elaine Orenberg, a researcher
in the Department of Dermatology at the Stanford
Medical Center. She is currently coordinating a study
on the effects and safety of minoxidil (a high-blood pres
sure drug) on male pattern baldness. Orenberg ex
plained, "My impression is that male pattern baldness in
males has a genetic component." She said she believes
in some cases male pattern baldness is definitely heredi
tary. Orenberg also said no one knows why men are

usually the ones affected.
As for the cause of baldness, Orenberg suggested that
it is due to a regression, or atrophy of the hair follicles.
She said some patients are responding very well to
minoxidil, which seems to be most effective on those
patients who have recently gone bald or are still balding.
DEAR BUG ME: As a fraternity brother; lye always
been very interested in the lives and works of the great
classical philosophers. Brit I'm confused about one thing.
W/iy do most have just one name? For instance, did
Plato have a first (or last) name? Is Plato even his real
name?
— It's all Greek to me
DEAR GREEK: We at Bug Me wholeheartedly agree
that this concern with the number and accuracy of phi
losopher's names is of immense importance. To discover
one day that the name of your most admired thinker is
"Joe Plato,' or that his name is actually "Dudley of
Dolos," would undoubtedly destroy one's image of a
wise old man, robed in linen, carrying on a lively
Socratic dialogue in a shady grove nestled in the hills
above Athens.
Our search for the other names of Plato began with a
call to the Classics Department, where an unidentified
source explained there is sufficient evidence to believe
that Plato is not his given name, but there is no factual
account of this first name.
Examination of the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia
Britannica produced a short biography of Plato based
upon the traditional accounts of Diogenes Laertius.
(How did this guy get two names?) This report states that
Plato's name was at first Aristocles, but that it was
changed to Plato for one of three reasons: it was
descriptive either of the great breadth of his shoulders,
his "style" or the shape of his forehead. So it appears
that Plato is some sort of a nickname, although it is
impossible to tell if the name is praising or mocking the
philosopher.
And so, another volume of Bug Me has passed. We
hope our summertime readers have enjoyed the sys
tematic disclosure of unbounded truths that has
transpired on this page every Tuesday. We thank with
all of our hearts everybody who helped us answer the
sometimes impossible, sometimes pointless questions.
And cheers to our readers who endured the sweltering
heat in search of the newspaper, even when it wasn't
delivered to your routine drop point. We hope that your
life has been enriched by ours.

DEAR BUG ME: As a fraternity brother; lye always
been very interested in the lives and works of the great
classical philosophers. Brit I'm confused about one thing.
W/iy do most have just one name? For instance, did
Plato have a first (or last) name? Is Plato even his real
name?
— It's all Greek to me
DEAR GREEK: We at Bug Me wholeheartedly agree
that this concern with the number and accuracy of phi
losopher's names is of immense importance. To discover
one day that the name of your most admired thinker is
"Joe Plato,' or that his name is actually "Dudley of
Dolos," would undoubtedly destroy one's image of a
wise old man, robed in linen, carrying on a lively
Socratic dialogue in a shady grove nestled in the hills
above Athens.
Our search for the other names of Plato began with a
call to the Classics Department, where an unidentified
source explained there is sufficient evidence to believe
that Plato is not his given name, but there is no factual
account of this first name.
Examination of the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia
Britannica produced a short biography of Plato based
upon the traditional accounts of Diogenes Laertius.
(How did this guy get two names?) This report states that
Plato's name was at first Aristocles, but that it was
changed to Plato for one of three reasons: it was
descriptive either of the great breadth of his shoulders,
his "style" or the shape of his forehead. So it appears
that Plato is some sort of a nickname, although it is
impossible to tell if the name is praising or mocking the
philosopher.
And so, another volume of Bug Me has passed. We
hope our summertime readers have enjoyed the sys
tematic disclosure of unbounded truths that has
transpired on this page every Tuesday. We thank with
all of our hearts everybody who helped us answer the
sometimes impossible, sometimes pointless questions.
And cheers to our readers who endured the sweltering
heat in search of the newspaper, even when it wasn't
delivered to your routine drop point. We hope that your
life has been enriched by ours.
