## Burgers: Up close and eaten 
### ERIK ESELIUS TRACY FURUTANI 
After loathing yet another article
extolling the virtues of Napa Valley
or Monterey or similar "diversion,"
readers imagined The Daily writer
to be nothing more than a Fila shirt
and an armful of Rolexes.
"Stanford's thrift-minded students
have a reputation to protect," wrote
one indignant indigent.
Indeed.
So with the closing of the 25 Cent
Hamburger Stand on Woodside
Road in Redwood City, a paucity of
traditional burger "joints" (which we
thrift-minded Daily writers frequent)
developed in the Mid-Peninsula
area. Through word of mouth and
discreet exchanges of Jacksons and
Grants for small slips of paper, we
came up with a list of the best ham
burger places within three miles of
Hoover Tower.

The criteria we used to determine
what was "the best" were simple: a
big burger, a classy dining area and a
crowd with character (once you sub
tract the ever-present Stanford
graduate student).
Thus, we avoided the soylent
green beef substitute served by zit
ridden teenagers in the local plas
steel mall-persona fast-food hovels
and instead concentrated our atten
tion on getting, like Safeway, an
honest deal.
Kirk's Restaurant: At 361 Califor
nia Avenue, this unprepossessing
eatery checked in at one-and-a-half
miles from the Tower.
Catering to the California Avenue
crowd, Kirk's has been an alternative
to Printer's Inc. as a readers' hang
out. Middle-aged women with dog
eared copies of "Anna Karenina" are
not out of character here.
The decor of Kirk's evokes images

of time gone amok. The '50s-style
formica tables clash pleasantly with
the huge stone fireplace and the
numerous house plants. Unfortun
ately, the pit produces a prodigious
amount of smoke that hangs over
the room.
Providently, Kirk's has outdoor
seating.
The burgers themselves come in
one size: one-third pound, with the
option of getting two patties rather
than one. The meat is charbroiled
over an open fire and placed on
buns; you do the rest at the condi
ment bar.
And the taste? Strictly, succulently
backyard grill; sometimes they're
underdone, sometimes they're
burnt, but on the whole they're
juicy and filling. Lettuce and
tomato are nowhere to be found, but
the condiment bar does have relish,
