## Burgers: Up close and eaten 
### ERIK ESELIUS TRACY FURUTANI 
After loathing yet another article
extolling the virtues of Napa Valley
or Monterey or similar "diversion,"
readers imagined The Daily writer
to be nothing more than a Fila shirt
and an armful of Rolexes.
"Stanford's thrift-minded students
have a reputation to protect," wrote
one indignant indigent.
Indeed.
So with the closing of the 25 Cent
Hamburger Stand on Woodside
Road in Redwood City, a paucity of
traditional burger "joints" (which we
thrift-minded Daily writers frequent)
developed in the Mid-Peninsula
area. Through word of mouth and
discreet exchanges of Jacksons and
Grants for small slips of paper, we
came up with a list of the best ham
burger places within three miles of
Hoover Tower.

The criteria we used to determine
what was "the best" were simple: a
big burger, a classy dining area and a
crowd with character (once you sub
tract the ever-present Stanford
graduate student).
Thus, we avoided the soylent
green beef substitute served by zit
ridden teenagers in the local plas
steel mall-persona fast-food hovels
and instead concentrated our atten
tion on getting, like Safeway, an
honest deal.
Kirk's Restaurant: At 361 Califor
nia Avenue, this unprepossessing
eatery checked in at one-and-a-half
miles from the Tower.
Catering to the California Avenue
crowd, Kirk's has been an alternative
to Printer's Inc. as a readers' hang
out. Middle-aged women with dog
eared copies of "Anna Karenina" are
not out of character here.
The decor of Kirk's evokes images

of time gone amok. The '50s-style
formica tables clash pleasantly with
the huge stone fireplace and the
numerous house plants. Unfortun
ately, the pit produces a prodigious
amount of smoke that hangs over
the room.
Providently, Kirk's has outdoor
seating.
The burgers themselves come in
one size: one-third pound, with the
option of getting two patties rather
than one. The meat is charbroiled
over an open fire and placed on
buns; you do the rest at the condi
ment bar.
And the taste? Strictly, succulently
backyard grill; sometimes they're
underdone, sometimes they're
burnt, but on the whole they're
juicy and filling. Lettuce and
tomato are nowhere to be found, but
the condiment bar does have relish,
pickles and onions in addition to the
usual stuff.
The steak burger is their standard
model — a good serviceable ham
burger. Their forte, though, is the
pineapple cheeseburger, which is
exactly as it sounds: a pineapple slice
ring is placed on a piece of cheese
that is placed on the patty and the
whole structure congeals. The
pineapple provides a sweet, if hard
to find, counterpoint to the flesh.
Also recommended are the malts.
After years of experience with malts
and shakes that contain such cryptic
ingredients as "non-fat dairy product
substitute," we found Kirk's malts
refreshing in their powerful malt
taste.
The Kirk's staff is helpful and oc
casionally octogenerian; they'll redo
burgers gone awry.
The restaurant also serves long
hot dogs.
The meal: A pineapple
cheeseburger with a strawberry malt.

Pudley's Burger Saloon: Here, we
came in hungry; we left stuffed —
really gorged. Yes, a short mile-long
jaunt down the heart of Palo Alto
will place you, the consumer,
squarely into a hamburger haven
virtually unmatched for variety and
content.
Let's start boldly with content.
Pudley's has basically three sizes of
hamburgers: large (one-fourth
pound), quite large (one-third
pound) and a small heifer (one-half
pound).
Furthermore, you won't find this
bastion of burgers wasting time call
ing a hamburger with lettuce (wow!)
a specialty sandwich. Take a ride to
Mickey D's for that.
What you will discover here is 20
solid choices of hamburger combin
ations, ranging from the standard to
the rather exotic and original.
For the vanilla person, Pudley's
offers the steady, no-nonsense selec
tions like the Sundance Kid (burger
with American cheese).
Those selections certainly caught
our eyes, but let's face it, we wanted
to sample the adventuresome. They
called it the O.K. Corral. Bacon,
mushrooms, guacamole, jack &

American cheese all found their way
onto one-third of a pound of beef.
Standing room only.
When we received our 'Corrals,
we had to strategize a means of get
ting it closer to our tastebuds. It was
a battle. Ultimately, to our great
satisfaction, we won out. The O.K.
Corral went for $4.60, and we
would have to say, it was one of the
finest burgers we've ever battled.
The coup de grace for Pudley's,
however, is the Gold Mine special.
For under five dollars, Pudley's will
grant you, the consumer, a one-half
pound burger with cheese, accom
panied by an order of log-like fries
and a giant 24-ounce brewski. Few
have survived.
In addition to burgers galore, the
saloon offers all-beef hotdogs and a
bountiful array of sandwiches to ap
pease the anti-burgerites.
The crowd at Pudley's is a mixed
bag of peanuts. Young urban profes
sionals do sometimes appear, but on
the whole, it's a casual, informal
crowd with a love for large beers and
a general hatred for Giants pitcher
Greg Minton.
Once again, if large and savory is
your current appetizing motif, then

without further delay, do some pre
liminary sit-ups and jog over to the
Burger Saloon on 255 University
Ave. Exercise will not be an option
afterwards.
The meal: Gold Mine and pos
sibly, if not definitely, but never si
multaneously, the O.K. Corral.
Located in a pine grove at the cor
ner of Arastadero and Alpine, TTie
Alpine Inn and Beer Garden, at the
limit of human endurance, proved
to be well worth the three-mile
walk.
Formerly Rosotti's or, familiarly,
Zot's, this joint has character. For
starters, when we asked the owner
what his specialty was, he snarled,
"Burgers!" and flashed a wicked set
of teeth.
The interior of the Inn is dim and
wooden; rows of empty beer bottles
from around the world adorn the
area above the counter while pinball
machines and jukeboxes alternate
with wooden cafeteria tables in the
main dining room.
Usually, the inside is buzzing
with blue-collar, Alpine Road
flannel-shirt workers while the chefs
bellow names for order pickups.

Tracy was a little slow to get his.
The Silicon Valley BMW exec
types escape to the beer garden,
which is an enclosed (but uncov
ered) expanse of dirt and picnic
tables behind the main restaurant. A
tinny loudspeaker announces which
orders are ready and a line of suits
dutifully trudge through the dust to
pick up their food.
The burger is a well done,
quarter-pound of grilled meat on a
toasted, buttered French roll. Cheese
is available and so are lettuce and
tomato — at a cost, however.
The condiment bar is the stan
dard ketchup and mustard setup. A
hint: If you're going to the beer gar
den, grab plenty of napkins.
The fries came in the "generous
helping" paper boat. Of the delicate
true French fry variety, they were
wonderfully light and crispy, with
out being burnt or underdone.
And, of course, don't forget the
brew.
The Inn also serves sandwiches
(from egg salad to hot roast beef),
Polish sausage and hard-boiled eggs,
making it quite a lunchtime threat.
The meal: A cheeseburger with
lettuce and tomato, fries and a beer.

So with the closing of the 25 Cent
Hamburger Stand on Woodside
Road in Redwood City, a paucity of
traditional burger "joints" (which we
thrift-minded Daily writers frequent)
developed in the Mid-Peninsula
area. Through word of mouth and
discreet exchanges of Jacksons and
Grants for small slips of paper, we
came up with a list of the best ham
burger places within three miles of
Hoover Tower.

The criteria we used to determine
what was "the best" were simple: a
big burger, a classy dining area and a
crowd with character (once you sub
tract the ever-present Stanford
graduate student).
Thus, we avoided the soylent
green beef substitute served by zit

steel mall-persona fast-food hovels
and instead concentrated our atten

honest deal.
Kirk's Restaurant: At 361 Califor
nia Avenue, this unprepossessing
eatery checked in at one-and-a-half
miles from the Tower.
Catering to the California Avenue
crowd, Kirk's has been an alternative
to Printer's Inc. as a readers' hang
out. Middle-aged women with dog
eared copies of "Anna Karenina" are
not out of character here.
The decor of Kirk's evokes images

of time gone amok. The '50s-style
formica tables clash pleasantly with
the huge stone fireplace and the
numerous house plants. Unfortun
ately, the pit produces a prodigious
amount of smoke that hangs over
the room.
Providently, Kirk's has outdoor
seating.
The burgers themselves come in
one size: one-third pound, with the
option of getting two patties rather
than one. The meat is charbroiled
over an open fire and placed on
buns; you do the rest at the condi
ment bar.
And the taste? Strictly, succulently
backyard grill; sometimes they're
underdone, sometimes they're
burnt, but on the whole they're
juicy and filling. Lettuce and
tomato are nowhere to be found, but
the condiment bar does have relish,
pickles and onions in addition to the
usual stuff.
The steak burger is their standard
model — a good serviceable ham
burger. Their forte, though, is the
pineapple cheeseburger, which is
exactly as it sounds: a pineapple slice
ring is placed on a piece of cheese
that is placed on the patty and the
whole structure congeals. The
pineapple provides a sweet, if hard
to find, counterpoint to the flesh.
Also recommended are the malts.
After years of experience with malts
and shakes that contain such cryptic
ingredients as "non-fat dairy product
substitute," we found Kirk's malts
refreshing in their powerful malt
taste.
The Kirk's staff is helpful and oc
casionally octogenerian; they'll redo
burgers gone awry.
The restaurant also serves long
hot dogs.
The meal: A pineapple
cheeseburger with a strawberry malt.

Pudley's Burger Saloon: Here, we
came in hungry; we left stuffed —
really gorged. Yes, a short mile-long
jaunt down the heart of Palo Alto
will place you, the consumer,
squarely into a hamburger haven
virtually unmatched for variety and
content.
Let's start boldly with content.
Pudley's has basically three sizes of
hamburgers: large (one-fourth
pound), quite large (one-third
pound) and a small heifer (one-half
pound).
Furthermore, you won't find this
bastion of burgers wasting time call
ing a hamburger with lettuce (wow!)
a specialty sandwich. Take a ride to
Mickey D's for that.
What you will discover here is 20
solid choices of hamburger combin
ations, ranging from the standard to
the rather exotic and original.
For the vanilla person, Pudley's
offers the steady, no-nonsense selec
tions like the Sundance Kid (burger
with American cheese).
Those selections certainly caught
our eyes, but let's face it, we wanted
to sample the adventuresome. They
called it the O.K. Corral. Bacon,
mushrooms, guacamole, jack &

American cheese all found their way
onto one-third of a pound of beef.
Standing room only.
When we received our 'Corrals,
we had to strategize a means of get
ting it closer to our tastebuds. It was
a battle. Ultimately, to our great
satisfaction, we won out. The O.K.
Corral went for $4.60, and we
would have to say, it was one of the
finest burgers we've ever battled.
The coup de grace for Pudley's,
however, is the Gold Mine special.
For under five dollars, Pudley's will
grant you, the consumer, a one-half
pound burger with cheese, accom
panied by an order of log-like fries
and a giant 24-ounce brewski. Few
have survived.
In addition to burgers galore, the
saloon offers all-beef hotdogs and a
bountiful array of sandwiches to ap
pease the anti-burgerites.
The crowd at Pudley's is a mixed
bag of peanuts. Young urban profes
sionals do sometimes appear, but on
the whole, it's a casual, informal
crowd with a love for large beers and
a general hatred for Giants pitcher
Greg Minton.
Once again, if large and savory is
your current appetizing motif, then

without further delay, do some pre
liminary sit-ups and jog over to the
Burger Saloon on 255 University
Ave. Exercise will not be an option
afterwards.
The meal: Gold Mine and pos
sibly, if not definitely, but never si
multaneously, the O.K. Corral.
Located in a pine grove at the cor
ner of Arastadero and Alpine, TTie
Alpine Inn and Beer Garden, at the
limit of human endurance, proved
to be well worth the three-mile
walk.
Formerly Rosotti's or, familiarly,
Zot's, this joint has character. For
starters, when we asked the owner
what his specialty was, he snarled,
"Burgers!" and flashed a wicked set
of teeth.
The interior of the Inn is dim and
wooden; rows of empty beer bottles
from around the world adorn the
area above the counter while pinball
machines and jukeboxes alternate
with wooden cafeteria tables in the
main dining room.
Usually, the inside is buzzing
with blue-collar, Alpine Road
flannel-shirt workers while the chefs
bellow names for order pickups.

Tracy was a little slow to get his.
The Silicon Valley BMW exec
types escape to the beer garden,
which is an enclosed (but uncov
ered) expanse of dirt and picnic
tables behind the main restaurant. A
tinny loudspeaker announces which
orders are ready and a line of suits
dutifully trudge through the dust to
pick up their food.
The burger is a well done,
quarter-pound of grilled meat on a
toasted, buttered French roll. Cheese
is available and so are lettuce and
tomato — at a cost, however.
The condiment bar is the stan
dard ketchup and mustard setup. A
hint: If you're going to the beer gar
den, grab plenty of napkins.
The fries came in the "generous
helping" paper boat. Of the delicate
true French fry variety, they were
wonderfully light and crispy, with
out being burnt or underdone.
And, of course, don't forget the
brew.
The Inn also serves sandwiches
(from egg salad to hot roast beef),
Polish sausage and hard-boiled eggs,

hint: If you're going to the beer gar
den, grab plenty of napkins.
The fries came in the "generous
helping" paper boat. Of the delicate
true French fry variety, they were
wonderfully light and crispy, with
out being burnt or underdone.
And, of course, don't forget the
brew.
The Inn also serves sandwiches
(from egg salad to hot roast beef),
Polish sausage and hard-boiled eggs,
making it quite a lunchtime threat.
The meal: A cheeseburger with
lettuce and tomato, fries and a beer.
