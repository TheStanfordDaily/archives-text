# Big Country shines boldly

Objectively, it was a great concert.
For an already confirmed fan, it was a fantastic con
cert.
Those of you not at the Warfield Theater in San
Francisco Sunday night may have missed one of the best
performances of the year in the Bay Area, for the Scot
tish quartet Big Country rocked the small concert hall
with its distinctive big guitar sound, reminiscent of U2
and fellow Scots the Alarm.
In fact, U2 guitarist The Edge was greatly influenced
by Big Country leader Stuart Adamson when the latter
was still with post-punkers The Skids in the early 80s.
It's easy to see why â€” Adamson is one of the smoothest,
most innovative musicians around, and his unique style
of play has earned his new band a large following in
Europe and a steadily growing American audience.
Big Country had not played in the United States since
the release of their first album, "The Crossing," in
1983. This tour is a promotion of their third and most
recent album, "The Seer," which is a little quieter than
their previous two works. Perhaps that's why the
foursome played only five songs (out of 20!) from the
new one, concentrating primarily on older material
from"The Crossing," which contributed a whopping
eight songs to the show.
The band opened with a rousing rendition of
"Wonderland" from their 1984 extended play of the
same name, and didn't let up for a second, going right
into a loud, quickly-paced "Fields of Fire."

Other crowd pleasers included the current hit "Look
Away" (the hardest rocking tune on the new one),
theme song "In a Big Country" and the title track from
1984's "Steeltown" LP.
Adamson showed his amazing guitar ability with
some slick solo work on "Inwards" and "Porrohman."
He managed to make the instrument sound like a
bagpipe with a combination of his eerie style and use of
an E-bow, an electric device held against the strings.
This lent an authentic regional Scottish sound to the
music, which is complemented by the solid backing of
second guitarist Bruce Watson and bassist Tony Butler.
Drummer Mark Brzezicki, recognized as one of the best
in the business, held everything together with a steady,
military-type beat.
Big Country also showcased some slower stuff,
namely the sorrowful "Chance" and the lovely "Just a
Shadow," which the group has toned down a lot for
their live performances.
In between songs, the audience was treated to charm
ing but often unintelligible comments from Adamson,
who had to ask, "Can you understand what I'm saying?"
in his thick Scottish accent. The band members seemed
to be enjoying themselves thoroughly, however, despite
any communication problem. Adamson, Watson and
Butler jumped about, ran around, smiled and joked the
whole way through, giving the entire show a sort of
lighthearted energy that was echoed by the music.
The group saved the best for last, closing out the
dynamic performance with encore performances of
"The Storm," "One Great Thing," "Lost Patrol" (with
the crowd joining in) and an in
spired rendition of Smokey Robin
son's "Tracks of My Tears." But in
stead of finishing there, as they
usually do, Big Country then
delighted the audience with a spon
taneous, wonderful version of
"Honky Tonk Woman," followed
by a medley of other songs and
"Fields of Fire" once again.
The crowd at the Warfield clearly
had as good a time as the band,
rushing to the front at the very
beginning and singing along at every
opportunity. People were literally
dancing in the aisles. As one
concert-goer succinctly said, "I
enjoyed it very much."
Those of you who missed the
show should hope it doesn't take Big
Country another three years to
return to the Bay Area, so you can
have a chance to see one of the great
live bands on stage.
