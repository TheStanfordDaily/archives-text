# Night Guy speaks: An ad hoc viewing
## 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
Before summer ends and you
cut the Stanford scene, there are
a few ad hoc sentiments that I'd
like to share with you.
I was listening to the radio the
other day, and I heard a song
from Chaka Khan, five times.
They must have used a bottle
shaped microphone to keep her
interested long enough to cut the
album. I didn't realize the Foster
Brooks of female entertainers
could sober up long enough to
cut another hit single. I saw her
loaded at the Boston Common,
once was enough!

Jeffrey Osborne has a new song
out that features the line, "Can
you woo woo woo?" Dylan eat
your poetic heart out.
However, I'm certain that
there's more than music cooking
your kettle these days, so let's take
a scenic one-way cruise down
Hollywood Boulevard.
Rodney Dangerfield's "Back to
School" is the funniest movie I've
seen since "Animal House.''
Even the serious romantic scenes
had my sides aching for relief.
The end, in particular, had me
doing a "triple lindy" in the aisle.
Last night I was watching the
Elvis Presley movie, "Wild in the
Country." Elvis should have
stayed exclusively with singing.
He acts with the conviction and
stage savvy of a doorknob. No of
fense.
I'm keeping my fingers crossed
that "Friday the 13th" part six
million is not released this year.
The only way films of this gory
genre could become more sub
verted would be to show them in
3-D and hurl actual body parts
onto the audience. I think Jason,
the mass killer, has already killed
the equivalent of the population
of Billings, Mont. Is this neces
sary?
Then again, if Charles Bron
son makes another "Death Wish"
movie, they will have to carry
him from one death-defying
scene to another in a wheelchair.
The dramatic letdown should be
like hosing down Apollo's
flaming chariot.
In short, most sequels are poor
because they try to do exactly
what the original did — make

money using the same breed of
hype. The one problem is we've
already paid the fiddler for that
tune.
Old movies are your best bet.
They are on television, and
therefore don't require that you
get dressed, drive anywhere or
buy over-priced popcorn laced
with horrid imitation butter.
Yesterday's actors had unique
styles whereas today's limelit crew
has contract disputes. Woe is me,
woe is Ricky Schroeder.
Speaking of yesterday's faces, I
saw Joan Collins on "The
Tonight Show" — again. I can't
believe she is over 50 years old. A
shining example of the capabili
ties of modern plastic surgery.
Johnny Carson is on his way
out, so is David Letterman if he
doesn't pull some new tricks out
of his writers.
Ed McMahon is the funniest
part of "The Tonight Show,'' but
as the host of Star Search, he is a
cinematic belly-flop, and that's
no small splash with Mr. Ed.
Just as McMahon is noted for
his jovial repetition, it seems that
fashions are looking a bit
familiar. The styles of yore are
storming back.

Jason, the mass
killer, has already
killed the equiva
lent of the popu
lation of Billings,
Mont.

If the '60s made any fashion
statement, it was "Go naked!"
Lately, I've been noticing a lot
of people wearing those Texan
string ties. While they look
foolish, they are convenient. . . .
Once you realize how horrible
you look with one, you can
promptly hang yourself with it.
Why has paisley become so
popular for the second time in
American history? It was a novel
pattern when the amoeba was
first discovered, but in the age of
the electron microscope, it has
become obsolete. Maybe it will
be replaced by a quark pattern or
something.
I still hope people continue to
wear baggies. If bell-bottoms ever
come back in style, I'm going to
buy a string tie and hang myself.

saw Joan Collins on "The
Tonight Show" — again. I can't
believe she is over 50 years old. A
shining example of the capabili
ties of modern plastic surgery.
Johnny Carson is on his way
out, so is David Letterman if he
doesn't pull some new tricks out
of his writers.
Ed McMahon is the funniest
part of "The Tonight Show,'' but
as the host of Star Search, he is a
cinematic belly-flop, and that's
no small splash with Mr. Ed.
Just as McMahon is noted for
his jovial repetition, it seems that
fashions are looking a bit
familiar. The styles of yore are
storming back.

Jason, the mass
killer, has already
killed the equiva
lent of the popu
lation of Billings,
Mont.

If the '60s made any fashion
statement, it was "Go naked!"
Lately, I've been noticing a lot
of people wearing those Texan
string ties. While they look
foolish, they are convenient. . . .
Once you realize how horrible
you look with one, you can
promptly hang yourself with it.
Why has paisley become so
popular for the second time in
American history? It was a novel
pattern when the amoeba was
first discovered, but in the age of
the electron microscope, it has
become obsolete. Maybe it will
be replaced by a quark pattern or
something.
I still hope people continue to
wear baggies. If bell-bottoms ever
come back in style, I'm going to
buy a string tie and hang myself.
