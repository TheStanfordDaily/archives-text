# Renaissance prof. helps Farm

### FOX VERNON 
If you are looking for an expert on Stanford, perhaps
you should turn to Prof. Herant Katchadourian. He has
struck a partnership with this academic institution.
At Stanford, he has almost done it all: taught at Stan
ford's Medical School beginning in 1966, served as the
University's first ombudspcrson in 1970, worked as the
dean of Undergraduate Studies from 19/5 to 1980,
taught undergraduates in his popular Human Sexuality
course beginning in 1968, and now he divides his time
between writing books and teaching for the Program in
Human Biology.
In his slacks and sports shirt, he looks Californian,
but this Renaissance man grew up in Beirut, Lebanon.
ITiere he picked up a European education and a calm,
gentlemanlike manner that, when combined with ambi
tion, would propel him into his multidimensional
career. He sums it up in his modest sty le, "I have done a
variety of things without giving anything up.'
Katchadourian came to Stanford in 1966 as an assis
tant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences in
the Medical School. His undergraduate education and
his training in medicine at the American University in
Beirut gave him an intellectual background that in
cluded, along with fluency in five languages, an in

satiable curiosity about people.
"I'm interested in learning why people behave the
way they do," he says simply and calmly, squinting as
he looks across White Plaza at the students going to
classes. His dark-rimmed glasses almost act as a micro
scope as he studies the day's doings.
Stanford people particularly interest Katchadourian
— so much so that he has just come out with a book
about them, "Careerism and Intellectual ism Among
College Students."
The history of this project goes back to 1975, when
Katchadourian, then the dean of Undergraduate
Studies, approached his friend Sally Mahoney, Univer
sity registrar. Mahoney remembers Katchadourian's
curiosity about the information her office was storing in
what was then a state-of-the-art computer.
"Herant kept saying, 'What don't you have?' or, 'My,
you have a lot of data,' " says Mahoney. After that, she
continues, "We used to just chat about what kind of
data we had.''
It turns out that Mahoney had access to data ranging
from admissions information to academic performance.
As an intellectual entrepreneur, Katchadourian could
not resist. The data had potential for publication. The
trick would be to figure out how
to use the data. "I said to Herant,
'What can we do?' "
What they did was organize
this disheveled data pile into a
coherent pamphlet called
"Statistical Study of the Curricu
lum," now a yearly University
publication. The study provided
administrators with an objective
measure of how well the Univer
sity was performing. Says
Mahoney about the project,
"What was wonderful about
Herant was that he understood
that administrative decisions
could be based on consistently
generated data."
The study gave Katchadourian
the credibility he needed to make
changes at Stanford. Taking the
results to different departments,
Katchadourian showed Univer
sity officials exactly which stu
dents were taking which classes.
According to Mahoney, it was
not long before the administra
tion began rearranging its distri
bution requirements.
But for Katchadourian, the
"Curriculum Study" was only a
forerunner of better things.
Wanting to get more from the
data, he soon saw that he could
realize that goal by combining in
terviews and questionnaires with
Mahoney's data. Selecting a
group of 320 entering freshmen,
he followed them through their
Stanford careers. The result was
"Careerism and Intellectualism."
"Katchadourian was wonderful
at resolving complexity," says
Mahoney of the times they spent
together working on the book.
"He was always alert to using the
information along the way as well

as seeing the long-term goal of a
publication."
The project illustrates
Katchadourian's talent, the
shrewd ability to combine his
own success drive with that of
Stanford. Both have benefited
from the partnership.
Another mark of Katch
adourian's talent is his in
volvement in the Program in
Human Biology. According to
Deana Fabbro-Selaya, the hum
bio program administrator,
Katchadourian almost single
handedly salvaged the "ship"
when he stepped in last spring to
coordinate the 4B side of the
core.
Fabbro-Selaya met Katcha
dourian when he was teaching
Human Sexuality, which, aside
from the core, ranks as the most
popular hum bio class. "He and I
got to be good buddies," says
Fabbro-Selaya. "And if he
needed things done, he would
come to me, and basically they
would get done."
In fact, that's how their part
nership began. When
Katchadourian first taught
Human Sexuality, Fabbro-Selaya
found a teaching assistant for
him.
Katchadourian grew so fond of
the class that year, he ended up
teaching it annually from 1968
on, except for the two years he
was on sabbatical. "I began to
teach it because I was a member
of a committee looking at health
issues," says Katchadourian.
Then with a grin he adds, "I
became a captive of the course. "
After teaching the course a few
years, Katchadourian became
frustrated because there were no
comprehensive textbooks on
human sexuality. Characteristic
ally, he seized upon the opportunity
and wrote his own, "Fundamentals
of Human Sexuality," which is now
in its fourth, and in Katchadourian's
eyes, best edition.
"Why is it that one quarter of
Stanford's undergrads — who are no
worse (than other students) with
respect to academic background or
social background — why are these
students not hooking up to the
careerist end of things or the intel
lectualist end of things?" he asks.
Katchadourian calls these stu
dents "the unconnected." He ex
plains that some of them "don't
know what they want to do, but
come here anyway." He adds, "It's
like going to a restaurant when
you're not hungry."
It was concerns like these that
won over Fabbro-Selaya when
Katchadourian first met her. "I'm

not a good person to get an objective
view of Herant," she says beaming
with her fondness for the man.
She beams even brighter when
she recalls how he stengthened the
hum bio core this spring. She had
told the head teaching assistant, who
was frazzled by a hectic winter quar
ter, "Don't worry, you're going to be
working with this man who's the
kindest gentleman."
Katchadourian's confidence,
however, did not equal Fabbro-
Selaya's. According to her, he was
nervous about his first time organiz
ing the core's 4B side, a four unit
humanities course. She found his
humility to be a pleasant surprise,
though. "You know how the egos
are around this place," she says with
a chuckle.
In the end, the course went
beautifully. "The evaluations are in
credible!" Fabbro-Selaya says,
beaming of course, and again
Katchadourian and his partner, the
Program in Human Biology, have
benefited.
