# Renaissance prof. helps Farm

### FOX VERNON 
If you are looking for an expert on Stanford, perhaps
you should turn to Prof. Herant Katchadourian. He has
struck a partnership with this academic institution.
At Stanford, he has almost done it all: taught at Stan
ford's Medical School beginning in 1966, served as the
University's first ombudspcrson in 1970, worked as the
dean of Undergraduate Studies from 19/5 to 1980,
taught undergraduates in his popular Human Sexuality
course beginning in 1968, and now he divides his time
between writing books and teaching for the Program in
Human Biology.
In his slacks and sports shirt, he looks Californian,
but this Renaissance man grew up in Beirut, Lebanon.
ITiere he picked up a European education and a calm,
gentlemanlike manner that, when combined with ambi
tion, would propel him into his multidimensional
career. He sums it up in his modest sty le, "I have done a
variety of things without giving anything up.'
Katchadourian came to Stanford in 1966 as an assis
tant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences in
the Medical School. His undergraduate education and
his training in medicine at the American University in
Beirut gave him an intellectual background that in
cluded, along with fluency in five languages, an in

satiable curiosity about people.
"I'm interested in learning why people behave the
way they do," he says simply and calmly, squinting as
he looks across White Plaza at the students going to
classes. His dark-rimmed glasses almost act as a micro
scope as he studies the day's doings.
Stanford people particularly interest Katchadourian
â€” so much so that he has just come out with a book
about them, "Careerism and Intellectual ism Among
College Students."
The history of this project goes back to 1975, when
Katchadourian, then the dean of Undergraduate
Studies, approached his friend Sally Mahoney, Univer
sity registrar. Mahoney remembers Katchadourian's
curiosity about the information her office was storing in
what was then a state-of-the-art computer.
"Herant kept saying, 'What don't you have?' or, 'My,
you have a lot of data,' " says Mahoney. After that, she
continues, "We used to just chat about what kind of
data we had.''
It turns out that Mahoney had access to data ranging
from admissions information to academic performance.
As an intellectual entrepreneur, Katchadourian could
not resist. The data had potential for publication. The
