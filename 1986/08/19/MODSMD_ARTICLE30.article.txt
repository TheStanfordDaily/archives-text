## McCarthy second in Amateur 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Playing on the familiar Pasatiempo Golf Course
near Santa Cruz, Stanford senior Kathleen
McCarthy advanced to the final round of the 86th
U.S. Women's Amateur Golf Championship last
weekend.
McCarthy was upended 9 and 7 in Saturday's 36-
hole final by UCLA's Kay Cockerill, who scored the
championship's most one-sided victory since 1962.
Despite Saturday's disappointment, the weekend
as a whole had to be satisfying for McCarthy, who
struggled through a nerve-wracking 1986 collegiate
season that saw her drop from No. 1 to No. 5 on the
Cardinal roster.
Among McCarthy's victims en route to the final
was nemesis Danielle Ammaccapane. The former
Arizona State star was the 1985 NCAA champion
and is considered one of the top prospects for the
LPGA tour. But on Friday, McCarthy edged her 1-
up in the semifinals, shooting a 71 over the 18 holes
and dropping a 20-foot putt on the 18th green for the
victory.
After defeating Ammaccapane, the final may have
been somewhat anticlimactic for McCarthy, but she
did take the first hole Saturday when Cockerill three
putted.
After winning the first hole, McCarthy went 21
holes before claiming another. She trailed by six after
the 18-hole morning round, and when she looked
ready to make a run on the front nine of the second
round, Cockerill's putter caught fire. The native of
Los Gatos birdied No. 5, parred No. 6 and birdied
No. 9 to go 7-up and put an end to McCarthy's
comeback aspirations.
McCarthy, who was an All-American as a fresh
man in 1984, will return to Stanford in the fall with
one more year of eligibility.
