# Cardinal aims for bowl game in '86
## 
### 
Football season has arrived.
Well, not really, but the NFL is in action, even in
London, as the Chicago Bears downed the Dallas
Cowboys at Wembley Stadium.
Soon, college football will start and the Stanford
Cardinal will once again put on its collective helmet
(gosh do we sportswriters hate that singular nickname!)
and do battle with the Pacific 10 and other football
powerhouses such as Texas, not to mention San Jose
State.

The general student attitude toward football in my
years here has been one of resignation and apathy,
probably because during that period the men in red
and white have compiled a 9-13 record.
But things could be worse. In that same time, Cali
fornia has gone 6-16. And in the most important
season statistic, Stanford has won Big Game the last
two years in a row. That's the true test of football supe
riority.
This may be a year in which Stanford has more to
look forward to than Big Game. The Cardinal not only
has a great shot at a winning season, but could, if all
goes well, wind up seeing some post-season action as
well.
The team is already guaranteed at least one bowl
game — the Mirage Bowl, in Tokyo, Japan. So it's
technically a regular season game against Arizona —
it's still a bowl game!

I'm not promising you a Rose
Bowl, but I have high hopes for the
Cardinal this fall. Heisman Trophy
candidate John Paye is now a senior,
and if the quarterback can stay
healthy, his talent and experience
will be an integral part of the team.
He has proved himself to be a true
team leader the last few years; as
Paye goes, Stanford usually goes.
But the two-sport star has been
injury-prone. If the Cardinal is to
make post-season play, Paye will
have to stay in one piece.
Paye is not the only member of
the squad to watch. This is the year
of the running back — Stanford's
strongest position. All-Pac-10 soph
omore fullback sensation Brad
Muster has been moved to tailback,
where he will absorb less punish
ment and have more blocking.
Senior Brian Morris takes over the
starting fullback spot. Marshall Dil

lard and Kevin Scott are also
available, so look for Coach Jack El
way to go to a three-man power
backfield at times with such an
abundance of size and speed.
The incoming freshmen, who
arrive this week, are an impressive
group as well. Linebacker Mike
Kohlmoos (snatched away from an
irate Joe Kapp at the last second) was
rated the number two recruit in the
nation. Tight end Ed McCaffery is
six-foot-six and chose Stanford over
Michigan, Notre Dame and Penn
State. Scott Stark is apparently the
Stanford quarterback of the future.
He led the state of California in
passing last year.
When the season ends and Stan
ford is in a bowl game, you can all
be frontrunners and say, "Yeah, I
went to all their games, all the
time.'' Sure you did. Just be there
this year, for once, because this
team is going to win some games.
And I guarantee that it will be in at
least one bowl game following a Big
Game victory.
