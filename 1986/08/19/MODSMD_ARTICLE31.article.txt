# Cardinal aims for bowl game in '86
## 
### 
Football season has arrived.
Well, not really, but the NFL is in action, even in
London, as the Chicago Bears downed the Dallas
Cowboys at Wembley Stadium.
Soon, college football will start and the Stanford
Cardinal will once again put on its collective helmet
(gosh do we sportswriters hate that singular nickname!)
and do battle with the Pacific 10 and other football
powerhouses such as Texas, not to mention San Jose
State.

The general student attitude toward football in my
years here has been one of resignation and apathy,
probably because during that period the men in red
and white have compiled a 9-13 record.
But things could be worse. In that same time, Cali
fornia has gone 6-16. And in the most important
season statistic, Stanford has won Big Game the last
two years in a row. That's the true test of football supe
riority.
This may be a year in which Stanford has more to
look forward to than Big Game. The Cardinal not only
has a great shot at a winning season, but could, if all
goes well, wind up seeing some post-season action as
well.
The team is already guaranteed at least one bowl
game — the Mirage Bowl, in Tokyo, Japan. So it's
technically a regular season game against Arizona —
it's still a bowl game!
