# Free South Africa Fund contributions increasing
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
The Free South Africa Fund now has
$1,100 in donations, but it is still waiting to
receive a gift of $1,500 pledged by this year's
graduating class, according to ASSU Finan
cial Manager Mariah Dickson.
The trust was established through the ASSU
last May by three Stanford Rhodes scholars to
provide an alternate contribution option for
donors critical of Stanford's investment
policies.
Donations to the fund will be released to
Stanford when it divests totally from corpora
tions doing business in South Africa or when
the black majority in that country gains the
political power to determine its future, accord
ing to a statement prepared by the fund's
founders. If, after 10 years, neither of these
conditions has been satisfied, the money will
be given to charities helping South African
blacks.

Donations have increased significantly, said
Dickson, who mentioned that one anonymons
person contributed $500. In fact, the ASSU
has just opened a separate account for the fund
at a local bank.
Dickson credits a letter published in the
June issue of the Stanford Observer, a newspa
per sent to alumni, for the increase in dona
tions. She also said she believes contributions
will continue to grow as this year's graduating
class begins working.
Timing has also caused fewer people to con
tribute to the fund, according to Dickson. She
said she believes that people who might have
donated money have already made gifts to
Stanford through its annual fund drive, and
she expects more alumni to support the Free
South Africa option next year.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, one of the
fund's five faculty trustees, said he would be
pleased if the financial response were more
vigorous. But he expects more dona
tions when the trust is able to make
some mail solicitations.
The problem is that the trust does
not currently have the money to
make the mailings, said Rebholz.
The contributions to the Free South

Africa Fund itself cannot be used for
that purpose.
"We need an angel to give us a
fairly large donation so we can get
these mailings underway," he said.
Rebholz said he believes the Free
South Africa Fund has lived up to its
purpose. "Everyone (who donated)
expressed gratitude for the fund be
cause it solved a moral dilemma for
them."

Dickson also said donors often in
cluded positive and reinforcing
notes with contributions. Most of
the people debating whether or not
to donate to Stanford would have
decided against doing so had it not
been for the fund, she said.
"This is a radical departure from
the typical way of giving to Stan
ford," Rebholz said.
Since the fund's inception, Reb

holz and the three Rhodes scholars
who founded the trust — William
Handley, Michael McFaul and
Susan Rice — have met twice with
the law firm Morrison and Foerster
of San Francisco.
For various technical reasons, the
trust is in the process of changing
into a corporation, according to
Rebholz. He said he expects the
terms of the corporation to be drawn
up within the next month.
The ASSU will continue to be in
charge of the trust money until the
corporation is founded, which
should be by or before the end of

this year, Rebholz said.
One advantage of becoming a
corporation is that gifts received
from other corporations can be spent
outside of the country. In a trust this
is not allowed.
Also, as a public corporation, the
Free South Africa Fund will have to
spend the interest made from in
vested contributions, according to
Rebholz.

Rebholz, the scholars and the law
firm also defined "firms doing busi
ness in South Africa" as firms with a
presence in South Africa. They did
not define "total divestment,"
however, preferring to leave it open
for the newly formed corporation's
board of directors to decide.
The corporation's board will con
sist of the current trustees, as well as
the Rhodes scholar founders.
