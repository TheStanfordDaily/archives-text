# Free South Africa Fund contributions increasing
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
The Free South Africa Fund now has
$1,100 in donations, but it is still waiting to
receive a gift of $1,500 pledged by this year's
graduating class, according to ASSU Finan
cial Manager Mariah Dickson.
The trust was established through the ASSU
last May by three Stanford Rhodes scholars to
provide an alternate contribution option for
donors critical of Stanford's investment
policies.
Donations to the fund will be released to
Stanford when it divests totally from corpora
tions doing business in South Africa or when
the black majority in that country gains the
political power to determine its future, accord
ing to a statement prepared by the fund's
founders. If, after 10 years, neither of these
conditions has been satisfied, the money will
be given to charities helping South African
blacks.

Donations have increased significantly, said
Dickson, who mentioned that one anonymons
person contributed $500. In fact, the ASSU
has just opened a separate account for the fund
at a local bank.
Dickson credits a letter published in the
June issue of the Stanford Observer, a newspa
per sent to alumni, for the increase in dona
tions. She also said she believes contributions
will continue to grow as this year's graduating
class begins working.
Timing has also caused fewer people to con
tribute to the fund, according to Dickson. She
said she believes that people who might have
donated money have already made gifts to
Stanford through its annual fund drive, and
she expects more alumni to support the Free
South Africa option next year.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, one of the
fund's five faculty trustees, said he would be
pleased if the financial response were more
