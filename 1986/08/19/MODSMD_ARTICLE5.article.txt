The preliminary results of a
campus-wide survey have
revealed that asbestos in Univer
sity buildings does not pose a
serious health threat, although
the substance is being removed
from two structures, according to
Asst. Provost John Hughes.
The survey, which is costing
the University $67,000, has en
tered the second phase of its two
phase program that will ulti
mately check every building on
campus for asbestos, Hughes
said.
Inhalation of asbestos fibers is
believed to lead to long-term lung
disease.

The first phase, in which 15
buildings known to have sprayed
on asbestos insulation were
tested, has been completed. The
University is in the process of
removing loose asbestos from two
of the tested buildings, according
to Doug Brown, University asso
ciate director of Health and
Safety.
Air samples taken from the
fifth and sixth floors of the
Durand Earth Sciences Building
and some air spaces between
floors in Jordan Hall tested posi
tive for asbestos, Hughes said.
The tests revealed "not any
thing dramatic,' Brown said.
