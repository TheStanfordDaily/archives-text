# Petition on Reagan library site stalls
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
A petition that would delay a final decision to
locate the proposed Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library in the Stanford foothills near Campus
Road East has been postponed, according to one
of the petition's organizers.
The Stanford Foothills Residents Group,
which is sponsoring the petition, has not been
able to meet because many of its members have
been out of town or otherwise unavailable, ac
cording to Education Prof. Robert Bush, a mem
ber of the group's executive committee.
The group is comprised of foothills
homeowners who oppose construction of the li
brary on the Campus Road East site for a variety

of reasons, including increased traffic the library
may generate, Bush said.
Engineering Prof. Anthony Siegman, another
member of the group's executive committee, said
he opposes only the planned site, not the library
itself.
The group's petition will ask that the site be
changed because "very valuable land should be
preserved for something more directly academic,"
Siegman said.
According to Siegman, the library will not be a
primarily academic facility, and will not be
owned by Stanford under the terms of its licensing
agreement.
Because the planned library site is "right across
the street from residences and is within walking
distance (of campus)," Siegman said, it is a prime

location for future Stanford expansion.
The University, however, has said that the pro
posed library offers substantial academic value
and that the land in the foothills is reserved for
this type of structure.
The residents group also charges that the Uni
versity has disregarded a previous plan for the de
velopment of the foothills that does not include
construction of a Reagan library, Siegman said.
Currently, the University is waiting for the li
brary's licensing agreement to be "signed and
sealed," after which time it plans to commission
an environmental impact report, according to
Charles Palm, a Hoover Institution archivist who
serves as liaison between the University and the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.
