# Increase smallest in 13 years
## Hospital hikes basic rates 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
Stanford University Hospital will increase its rates by
an average of 6.7 percent starting Sept. 1, Sheldon King,
hospital president and chief executive officer, an
nounced yesterday.
The increase is the smallest rise in 13 years. Accord
ing to David Sakai, director of finance, the rate of in
crease has been declining steadily for the past four or
five years. The increases for last year and the year before
were ".9 and 8.3 percent, respectively.
The small increase was accompanied by the approval
of an operating budget for the 1986-87 fiscal year of
$191.4 million, 2.4 percent lower than the $196 mil
lion 1985-86 budget. Both figures were approved by the
hospital's board of directors Aug. 13.
Several factors have contributed to the small rate in
creases and the budget reductions of recent years.
"The primary thing was that top management and the
board really thought that it was time to abate price in
creases in this world of competitive health care,'' Sakai
said.
Another factor is the hospital's recent downsizing ef

fort, which included a layoff of over 200 hospital
employees earlier this year and a rethinking of the hospi
tal's procedures to bring about more efficient use of ma
terials and services.
A general decline in the costs to the hospital also
played a role in the budget reductions and low rate in
creases. Supply and service costs have been declining, as
has the overall rate of inflation. These decreases,
however, have been offset by substantial cost increases
in utilities and malpractice insurance.
These large increases — malpractice insurance costs
alone rose by 69 percent — combine with other factors
to match exactly the 6.7 percent price increase, accord
ing to a hospital press release.
Stanford Hospital is one of the first university hospi
tals to affect such major changes, according to Sakai.
"What we did is being reflected throughout the health
care industry," he said.
With the approval of the hospital's board, the rate in
creases will automatically go into effect Sept. 1.
However, the operating budget requires the additional
approval of the University Board of Trustees, since
members of the University board are general members
of the hospital corporation.
