# Take a trip from the Farm to see the City
## 
### 
No stay in the Bay Area is com
plete without a trip to "the City"
(and whatever you do, don't call It
"Frisco").
Listed below are some of San
Francisco's most famous attrac
tions. Of course, there are many
others besides those listed here —
the rest is up to you. Just remem
ber, it's never really summer In
San Francisco, so dress warmly
and bring a camera.
Cable cars — Back In operation
after a heartbreaking hiatus. They
aren't just transportation, they're
a way of life.
Alcatraz — Known to inmates
as "The Rock," Alcatraz claims
most of its fame from the time
that it was a Devil's Isle-style
federal penitentiary housing such
notable criminals as the "bird
man." The island has also been
used as a fortification, a U.S. mili
tary prison, an army disciplinary
barracks and an American Indian
stronghold. The National Park
Service runs two-hour conducted
tours from the waterfront. The
tours are traditionally very
popular, so get there early.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens. Nowadays,
visitors browse through a shop
ping plaza, watch street
performers and buy chocolate and
ice cream in the original chocolate
factory.
Palace of Fine Arts — A wonder
ful anachronism. Created as the
diadem of the 1915 Pacific Exposi
tion, it has a central rotunda
embracing a Corinthian
colonnade ornamented with
friezes and statues comprise the
Palace.
Chinatown — A long-time resi
dent of Hong Kong once said that
Chinatown reminded him of home

— the rush-hour traffic jams on
the main drag rivaled any traffic
tie-up a Chinese city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also of
fers a kaleidoscope of Asian
delights — restaurants, dim sum
bars, pharmacies displaying
pickled snakes. . . . The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue
house one of the largest Chinese
populations outside of China and
plenty of opportunities for explo
ration.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty
fishermen, seagulls and the ripe
smell of fish once dominated San
Francisco's wharf. Although the
nearby ships still berth, travelers,
carnivals, wax museums and
tourist shops have almost taken
over the surrounding wharf area.
Still, the 19th-century museum
ship Balclutha harks back to the
old days, and some of the city's
best restaurants are to be found
along the wharf.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue
once supported a posh shopping
district catering to the well-to-do
residents of Russian Hill and Nob
Hill. Gay activists have since sup
planted the fur-coated house
wives and chic shops. Shopping
on Polk Street may no longer be
elite, but it's trendy and fun.
Beware of high prices.
Golden Gate Park — The attrac
tions here are too numerous to
name, but there are acres of green
grass, beautiful trees and foliage,
and lots of activity. And if that
doesn't make you happy. . . .
Telegraph Hill — The
Bohemian section of San Fran
cisco. The circuitous streets and
cliff-hanging houses of Telegraph
Hill have been inhabited by suc
cessive generations of flower
children, artists and literati.

49 Mile Drive — This half-day
tour is a planned drive through
the most famous landmarks of the
City. The route starts on Van Ness
Avenue at the Civic Center and is
clearly marked by blue-and-white
seagull signs.
Twin Peaks — A cliche necking
and hangout joint for the Bay
Area's teens, the peaks offer an in
toxicating panorama from the
Marin Headlands to the Santa
Clara Valley.
Lombard Street — A popular
postcard advertises Lombard as
"the crookedest street in the
world." There are 19 hairpin turns
in a single block.
Coit Tower — An impressive
monument to the City's
firefighters, Coit looms on a hill
top and is easily accessible by car.

Nob Hill — Former site of
Leland Stanford Sr.'s palatial
home before the 1906 earthquake,
Nob Hill remains the City's center
of conspicuous consumption.
Visit two glorious hotels, the Fair
mont and Mark Hopkins, then
stroll down the street to the ritzy
shops of Union Square. From Un
ion Square you can jump on the
beginning of the cable car route
and take the long, exhilirating
ride to the Wharf.
Embarcadero Freeway — Just
kidding.
When you tire of the City, cross
the mighty Golden Gate and go to
Sausalito — A gorgeous little town
full of culture and life, and home
of a whole line of restaurants sit
ting right on the Bay.

How to get there from here:
Bus — SamTrans departs from
the Stanford Shopping Center at
the El Camino bus stop. The fare
is under $2 each way. Call 367-
1500 for schedule information or
pick one up at the information
booth in Tresidder. Take a Mar
guerite to the shopping center.
BART — Bay Area Rapid Tran
sit. First you have to get to Daly
City. Trains run every 15-20
minutes.
Train — The CalTrain leaves
from the Southern Pacific station
off University Avenue in Palo Alto.
During the day trains leave about
once each hour and the fare is less
then *10.00 round trip. The train
is by far the fastest and most fun
way to get to the City during the
day. Call 323-6105 for scheduling.

No stay in the Bay Area is com
plete without a trip to "the City"
(and whatever you do, don't call It
"Frisco").
Listed below are some of San
Francisco's most famous attrac
tions. Of course, there are many
others besides those listed here —
the rest is up to you. Just remem
ber, it's never really summer In
San Francisco, so dress warmly
and bring a camera.
Cable cars — Back In operation
after a heartbreaking hiatus. They
aren't just transportation, they're
a way of life.
Alcatraz — Known to inmates
as "The Rock," Alcatraz claims
most of its fame from the time
that it was a Devil's Isle-style
federal penitentiary housing such
notable criminals as the "bird
man." The island has also been
used as a fortification, a U.S. mili
tary prison, an army disciplinary
barracks and an American Indian
stronghold. The National Park
Service runs two-hour conducted
tours from the waterfront. The
tours are traditionally very
popular, so get there early.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens. Nowadays,
visitors browse through a shop
ping plaza, watch street
performers and buy chocolate and
ice cream in the original chocolate
factory.
Palace of Fine Arts — A wonder
ful anachronism. Created as the
diadem of the 1915 Pacific Exposi
tion, it has a central rotunda
embracing a Corinthian
colonnade ornamented with
friezes and statues comprise the
Palace.
Chinatown — A long-time resi
dent of Hong Kong once said that
Chinatown reminded him of home

— the rush-hour traffic jams on
the main drag rivaled any traffic
tie-up a Chinese city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also of
fers a kaleidoscope of Asian
delights — restaurants, dim sum
bars, pharmacies displaying
pickled snakes. . . . The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue
house one of the largest Chinese
populations outside of China and
plenty of opportunities for explo
ration.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty
fishermen, seagulls and the ripe
smell of fish once dominated San
Francisco's wharf. Although the
nearby ships still berth, travelers,
carnivals, wax museums and
tourist shops have almost taken
over the surrounding wharf area.
Still, the 19th-century museum
ship Balclutha harks back to the
old days, and some of the city's
best restaurants are to be found
along the wharf.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue
once supported a posh shopping
district catering to the well-to-do
residents of Russian Hill and Nob
Hill. Gay activists have since sup
planted the fur-coated house
wives and chic shops. Shopping
on Polk Street may no longer be
elite, but it's trendy and fun.
Beware of high prices.
Golden Gate Park — The attrac
tions here are too numerous to
name, but there are acres of green
grass, beautiful trees and foliage,
and lots of activity. And if that
doesn't make you happy. . . .
Telegraph Hill — The
Bohemian section of San Fran
cisco. The circuitous streets and
cliff-hanging houses of Telegraph
Hill have been inhabited by suc
cessive generations of flower
children, artists and literati.
