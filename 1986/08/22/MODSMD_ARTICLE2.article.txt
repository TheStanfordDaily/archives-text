# Welcome to the Stanfords' Farm
## 
### 
Welcome to Leland Stanford
Junior University.
Stanford takes on a different
look in the summer. The academic
intensity of the regular school year
eases somewhat as the sun blazes
down to thwart study efforts.
Bicycle traffic lightens and post of
fice lines shrink ever so slightly.
Lake Lagunita begins to dry up
while the arboretum continues to
be parched by the hot sun.
But the campus loses little of its
usual vitality in the summer.
Many students remain on campus
for summer quarter to study or to
pursue research opportunities.
They are joined by an amazingly
diverse amalgam of visiting high
school and college students, con
ferees, participants in various
sports and leadership camps and
a liberal sprinkling of tourists.
Your stay on the Farm will
surely be a rewarding one if you
give yourself an opportunity to ex
plore the campus and enjoy the di
versity of people and facilities in
the University and its environs.
This guide attempts to offer an in
troduction to some of the more
salient features and services of the
campus, while also encouraging
you to keep an eye out for some of
the more obscure ones.
This guide doesn't pretend to be
exhaustive or all-encompassing.
Hopefully, though, it will get you
started and answer some of your
bigger questions. To begin with,
