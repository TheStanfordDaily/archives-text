# Hidden Stanford: off the beaten path
## 
### 
You've gone on the campus tour. It took
an hour and you saw some interesting
stuff, but there's an empty feeling in your
stomach. This is partly because you haven't
eaten lunch and partly because you're sure
there's more of Stanford to see. Besides,
you're going to be here all summer, and you
need some places to go.
Do not despair, for there are many spots
the tour guide didn't show you — places
hidden and some not-so-hidden. Stanford's
campus is sprawling, and has many special
attractions worth seeking out.
The following is a guide to some of the
hidden Stanford. These places range from
gorgeous to just plain bizarre; most you'll
never see on postcards, but all are worth
seeing at least once. This is only a partial,
subjective listing; hopefully, it will set you
on the road to some discoveries of your
own.
Hoover Tower
Begin your tour of the hidden Stanford
with a trip to the top of Hoover Tower. The
elevator ride is great, and once you get to
the top you can see for miles around. From
here you'll spot parts of the campus you
didn't even know existed.
Stanford Mausoleum
A little morbid perhaps, but a gorgeous
structure nonetheless and worth the trip
just to see the magnificent oak tree that
guards the crypt. While you're here, be sure
to see the Angel of Grief statue nearby.
Cactus Garden
Right next to the Mausoleum, this collec
tion of cacti and other exotic vegetation
used to be the lover's lane of Stanford stu
dents. Now it's a bit overgrown but still
beautiful. Perfect for a romantic stroll or an
afternoon picnic.

The Knoll
This majestic building, looming in
fearsome magnificence on a hill above the
barracks-style Florence Moore Hall, used to
house the University's Department of
Music. Now God only knows what's in it,
but it's certainly one of the grandest build
ings on campus, and fearless undergradu
ates tell stories of spending the night there.
The Dish
It's hard to miss the big satellite dish in
the foothills behind Stanford, but many
people miss visiting it. Take the path that
begins off Junipero Serra Boulevard across
the street from Lake Lagunita, and it's just
a short (though uphill) walk to the Dish.
There you'll have a beautiful view of the Bay
Area. Another great place for a picnic; also
the best place on campus to watch the sun
set or rise.
Meyer Library sundecks
Speaking of great places to watch the sun
set, here's the second best. Stand on the
deck that faces the center of campus and
see the red tile roofs bathed in the pastels of
twilight. Aaah . . . makes you want to
study, or at least go to the library more of
ten.
Green Library
Sure, everybody and his or her dog goes
here to study, but there are so many other
attractions. Start in the old (west) wing, but
before you go in admire the outside and the
neat arcade that runs across it. Once you're
inside just walk straight ahead up the stair
way into the Rotunda. This is beautiful and
plays host to an ever-changing variety of ex
hibits. Off to the left when you get to the top
of the stairs is the Rare Book Room, a must
see.

Now it's time to check out the University
Archives. History buffs and anyone inter
ested in Stanford's past will go crazy here.
The Archives are housed in the lovely
Bender Room at the very top of Green, on
the seventh floor. Be sure to take the
elevator up. It's a great old orange crate of a
contraption — even if you've got no
curiousity about Stanford, you'll soon be
very anxious to get to the Archives. But
don't worry. As the lady next to me on my
first Archives elevator ride said, "When it
gets stuck, it's never for more than a few
minutes." If you survive the elevator ride,
you'il find the Archives a wonderful place,
staffed by extremely gracious, helpful
people.
Highlights of the new (east) wing of Green
are the fountain outside, the Jonsson Li
brary of Government Documents, a periodi
cal section that surely has your hometown
paper and a staff of research librarians who
can seemingly answer any question. Try
them.
Okay, if given all these alternatives, you
still must study, at least try the West Stacks
once. Here you can sit among musty and
dusty books that no one ever reads or study
next to an open window looking out on —
and well within hearing distance of the
soothing sounds of — the Shumway "Hoop"
Fountain.
Frost Amphitheater
Yep, that's right . . . another great place
for a picnic. You always hear about this
place, but few people ever really go there un
less the Dead or some Windham Hill group
is playing a concert. If one of the gates is
open, walk on in, sit down and read a book,
muse about trivial things, or just admire

the sylvan setting. And as long as you're
here, check out the adjacent Band Shak
(sic). Home of the infamous Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching Band and
repository of over 300 street signs from
around the world, this is a stop that no
Stanford visitor should miss.
The Quad at night
If sandstone and red tile start to bore you.
go take a walk through the Quad after sun
down and see how it takes on a whole new
character. The shadows are tremendous
and the walkways are simultaneously
spooky and romantic.
Mayfield Avenue
Take a leisurely evening stroll up the ave
nue from Braun Music Center to the faculty
ghetto. Majestic fraternities and other stu
dent residences line the street, casting
beautiful green lawns out to passers-by.
Old Pavilion
Formerly home of the varsity basketball
team, the Old Pavilion now houses the Uni
versity's personnel offices. It's a mag
nificent office facility, with the high ceiling
and bustling atmosphere of a shopping
galleria, but the best thing about it is the
scale model of the University that sits in the
entrance. Check it out.
Lagunita Courtyard
This quiet, Edenesque spot will shatter
all your preconceptions and convictions
about dormitory architecture.
Steam tunnels
We law-abiding citizens have never actu
ally been down in these ourselves, but we
heard they're really cool.

need some places to go.
Do not despair, for there are many spots
the tour guide didn't show you — places
hidden and some not-so-hidden. Stanford's
campus is sprawling, and has many special
attractions worth seeking out.
The following is a guide to some of the
hidden Stanford. These places range from
gorgeous to just plain bizarre; most you'll
never see on postcards, but all are worth
seeing at least once. This is only a partial,
subjective listing; hopefully, it will set you
on the road to some discoveries of your
own.
Hoover Tower
Begin your tour of the hidden Stanford
with a trip to the top of Hoover Tower. The
elevator ride is great, and once you get to
the top you can see for miles around. From
here you'll spot parts of the campus you
didn't even know existed.
Stanford Mausoleum
A little morbid perhaps, but a gorgeous
structure nonetheless and worth the trip
just to see the magnificent oak tree that
guards the crypt. While you're here, be sure
to see the Angel of Grief statue nearby.
Cactus Garden
Right next to the Mausoleum, this collec
tion of cacti and other exotic vegetation
used to be the lover's lane of Stanford stu
dents. Now it's a bit overgrown but still
beautiful. Perfect for a romantic stroll or an
afternoon picnic.

The Knoll
This majestic building, looming in
fearsome magnificence on a hill above the
barracks-style Florence Moore Hall, used to
house the University's Department of
Music. Now God only knows what's in it,
but it's certainly one of the grandest build
ings on campus, and fearless undergradu
ates tell stories of spending the night there.
The Dish
It's hard to miss the big satellite dish in
the foothills behind Stanford, but many
people miss visiting it. Take the path that
begins off Junipero Serra Boulevard across
the street from Lake Lagunita, and it's just
a short (though uphill) walk to the Dish.
There you'll have a beautiful view of the Bay
Area. Another great place for a picnic; also
the best place on campus to watch the sun
set or rise.
Meyer Library sundecks
Speaking of great places to watch the sun
set, here's the second best. Stand on the
deck that faces the center of campus and
see the red tile roofs bathed in the pastels of
twilight. Aaah . . . makes you want to
study, or at least go to the library more of
ten.
Green Library
Sure, everybody and his or her dog goes
here to study, but there are so many other
attractions. Start in the old (west) wing, but
before you go in admire the outside and the
neat arcade that runs across it. Once you're
inside just walk straight ahead up the stair
way into the Rotunda. This is beautiful and
plays host to an ever-changing variety of ex
hibits. Off to the left when you get to the top
of the stairs is the Rare Book Room, a must
see.

Now it's time to check out the University
Archives. History buffs and anyone inter
ested in Stanford's past will go crazy here.
The Archives are housed in the lovely
Bender Room at the very top of Green, on
the seventh floor. Be sure to take the
elevator up. It's a great old orange crate of a
contraption — even if you've got no
curiousity about Stanford, you'll soon be
very anxious to get to the Archives. But
don't worry. As the lady next to me on my
first Archives elevator ride said, "When it
gets stuck, it's never for more than a few
minutes." If you survive the elevator ride,
you'il find the Archives a wonderful place,
staffed by extremely gracious, helpful
people.
Highlights of the new (east) wing of Green
are the fountain outside, the Jonsson Li
brary of Government Documents, a periodi
cal section that surely has your hometown
paper and a staff of research librarians who
can seemingly answer any question. Try
them.
Okay, if given all these alternatives, you
still must study, at least try the West Stacks
once. Here you can sit among musty and
dusty books that no one ever reads or study
next to an open window looking out on —
and well within hearing distance of the
soothing sounds of — the Shumway "Hoop"
Fountain.
Frost Amphitheater
Yep, that's right . . . another great place
for a picnic. You always hear about this
place, but few people ever really go there un
less the Dead or some Windham Hill group
is playing a concert. If one of the gates is
open, walk on in, sit down and read a book,
muse about trivial things, or just admire

the sylvan setting. And as long as you're
here, check out the adjacent Band Shak
(sic). Home of the infamous Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching Band and
repository of over 300 street signs from
around the world, this is a stop that no
Stanford visitor should miss.
The Quad at night
If sandstone and red tile start to bore you.
go take a walk through the Quad after sun
down and see how it takes on a whole new
character. The shadows are tremendous
and the walkways are simultaneously
spooky and romantic.
Mayfield Avenue
Take a leisurely evening stroll up the ave
nue from Braun Music Center to the faculty
ghetto. Majestic fraternities and other stu
dent residences line the street, casting
beautiful green lawns out to passers-by.
Old Pavilion
Formerly home of the varsity basketball
team, the Old Pavilion now houses the Uni
versity's personnel offices. It's a mag
nificent office facility, with the high ceiling
and bustling atmosphere of a shopping
galleria, but the best thing about it is the
scale model of the University that sits in the
entrance. Check it out.
Lagunita Courtyard
This quiet, Edenesque spot will shatter
all your preconceptions and convictions
about dormitory architecture.
Steam tunnels
We law-abiding citizens have never actu
ally been down in these ourselves, but we
heard they're really cool.
You've gone on the campus tour. It took
an hour and you saw some interesting
stuff, but there's an empty feeling in your
stomach. This is partly because you haven't
eaten lunch and partly because you're sure
there's more of Stanford to see. Besides,
you're going to be here all summer, and you
need some places to go.
