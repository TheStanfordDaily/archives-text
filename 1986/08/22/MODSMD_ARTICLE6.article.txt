# The
						story of a boy and his school
## 
### 
It all began with a little boy . . .
Once upon a time, there was a
little boy. The boy was named
Leland, just like his father. Junior
was rather spoiled, as little boys
go; his father — a two-time gover
nor of California and later a U.S.
senator from the same state — al
ways gave him bigger train sets
than any of his friends had and
would often take the boy and his
mother, Jane, on trips to far-off
places all around the world.
On one of those trips the boy
took a fever and died suddenly, at
the untimely age of 15. The
mother and father were
heartbroken by the loss of the boy,
who was their only child.
Proclaiming "The children of Cali
fornia shall be our children," they
returned to their home in the
Golden State and began making
plans to found a university in the
boy's name.
The two set to work immedi
ately, signing the founding grant
of the new university in 1885,
then calling on eminent architect
Frederick Law Olmsted to help
design the school. The father
sacrificed the land of his 8,250-
acre stock farm to provide the
sprawling grounds for the
campus, at the base of a long line
of foothills south of San Fran
cisco. Olmsted originated the idea
of long, low buildings connected
by arches to form a double quad
rangle, and a young Boston archi
tect named Charles Coolidge came
in to implement Olmsted's plan.
Coolidge employed a style
known as Richardson
Romanesque, which, like the
European Romanesque, is charac
terized by rectilinear stone build
ings joined by covered arcades.
These arcades are formed of suc

cessive half-circle arches and sup
ported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
Ground was broken in 1887 and
by October 1891 the school was
ready to open.
In the meantime the Stanfords
had called upon a man from the
East named Jordan to lead their
new school. David Starr Jordan
left the University of Indiana to
become Stanford University's first
president.
Upon arriving in California, Jor
dan was enthralled by the land
around Stanford and invigorated
by the task before him.
"The possibilities were so chal
lenging to one of my temperament
that I could not decline," Jordan
said of his acceptance of the
presidency.
Despite much derisive and
skeptical criticism of the Univer
sity by Easterners (including one
New York paper which declared
that "for years to come Stanford
professors would lecture in marble
halls to empty benches"), the
school opened with great success
in 1891. About 250 students were
expected, but some 460 showed
up on opening day.
Dr. Jordan told the students
and the rest of the opening day
crowd that "it is for us as teachers
and students in the University's
first year to lay the foundations of
a school which may last as long as
human civilization. ... It is
hallowed by no traditions; it is
hampered by none. Its fingerposts
all point forward."
Jordan would go on to guide
little Leland's university for 21
years. However, only two years
after Jordan took the position, the
boy's father died, leaving his wife

and Jordan to nurture the fled
gling school.
Despite that adversity, the
school grew remarkably in its
early years, expanding both its
physical plant and educational
mission. The Inner Quad class
room buildings had been com
pleted in 1891; the Outer Quad
and magnificent Memorial
Church were added in 1903.
Meanwhile, in 1896 a unique
Stanford tradition was begun: to

memorialize itself, the graduating
class of 1896 placed a bronze
plaque numbered '96' in place of
one of the red-brown stone rec
tangles in the Inner Quad arcade
walkway right in front of the then
uncompleted Church. Every class
since has followed suit, with the
line of plaques now about to turn
the corner in the arcade.
Dr. Jordan did some walking
and counting after that first
plaque was laid, and discovered

that it would take until the year
2517 for the plaques to make a full
trip around the Inner Quad back
to the front of the Church. And if
all the other stones in the inner
walkway would utilized for yearly
plaques, Jordan continued, it
would be the year 8297 before the
entire walkway was exhausted.
All in all, then, things began
well for Stanford University.
However, tragedy soon visited the
