# Movie fun for everyone

### 
Sometime during your stay at Stanford, you will
suddenly realize that Palo Alto is not a thriving
metropolitan center of culture. The only thing to
turn to — besides a trip to the City — is the movies.
During the regular school year, seven or eight film
series may be in operation at the same time, but
during the summer all of these series discontinue.
However, the Peninsula boasts a large number and
variety of movie houses, both first- and second-run,
that make it possible to go to the movies every night.
In Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Mountain View alone
there are several theaters, and within a 15- or 20-
minute distance — in Redwood City, San Mateo and
Belmont — newly-arrived movie addicts will find
their needs liberally tended to:
Aquarius — The Aquarius, on Emerson between
University and Lytton, has two small cinemas that
show mostly foreign films, with an occasional
"small" American feature. Since it is one of Palo
Alto's major claims to culture, it is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Saturday nights; the Palo
Alto moviegoing crowd tends to adopt certain movies
that open at the Aquarius — "El Norte" or "Carmen"
— and keep them playing there for months. It's your
basic (essential) university theater, and though its
films are of highly variable quality, the management
has never compromised its decision to show only art
house selections.
Fine Arts — On California Avenue, just east of El
Camino — in the midst of the nicest commercial area
in Palo Alto. The Fine Arts is a fairly nice theater, it
has been known in the past for grabbing hold of
movies it could show for months and months, like
"Back to the Future" or "Amadeus," but lately the
turnover has been more rapid.

Palo Alto Square — These twin theaters take up
the bottom floor of a very bland-looking office build
ing at the corner of El Camino and Page Mill Road.
They draw mostly high school kids, because, they
tend to show boffo films like "Footloose" and
"Indiana Jones," but they are undeniably comforta
ble and convenient (if you have a car).
Guild, Park — These are Menlo Parks' two movie
theaters. They are located a couple of blocks from
each other on El Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds, including "art house films." They
are pleasant theaters, and pretty reliable with regard
to programming — generally speaking, at least one of
them is offering a film worth seeing at any given
time.
Old Mill 6 — The bane of a moviegoer's existence —
you can't avoid seeing films here because since there
are six screens, two or three new pictures arrive
every week. Besides, the bargain-price twilight
shows are very seductive. But the screens are tiny,
the theater is always crowded and you move from line
to line until you feel you're being processed. Further
more, it's an offensively ugly environment in which
to see movies — the theater looks vaguely like a video
arcade. But if you must, it is located in the Old Mill
Shopping Mall on San Antonio Road, near the San
Antonio Shopping Center. (The easiest way to get to
it is via Alma; if you take the San Antonio turnoff,
you'll immediately find signs for the Old Mill.)
Century 10 Another monster of a theater, this house
has ten screens. However, despite its size it is usually
crowded. But don't worry. Because of the variety of
movies it shows, if you don't get into your first
choice, there is probably another one you'll be able to
see. It's about a 15 minute drive from Stanford, lo
cated at 1500 Sterlin Road, Mountain View.
