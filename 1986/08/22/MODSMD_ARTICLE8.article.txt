# Questions and answers

### 
Have you ever wanted to ask a
question that seemed so dumb
that you were too embarrassed to
ask anybody? Sure you have. In
order to keep you from looking
foolish, listed below are some
answers to the most commonly
asked stupid questions about the
Farm.
How do I know what's going on
around campus?
Keep an eye on the Once Around
the Quad listings in The Daily
(which comes out twice a week —
Tuesdays and Fridays — during
the summer). In addition, the
calendar on the back page of the
weekly Campus Report is very
helpful, listing all kinds of con
certs, exhibits and meetings. The
information booth and various
bulletin boards at Tresidder
Memorial Union will also help you.
Why is it called a "junior univer
sity"?
It's not. Stanford is a university
named after Leland Stanford Jr.,
son of railroad magnate and Cali
fornia Governor Leland Stanford.
See page 7 for more history.
Where do I go to pay my bills?
Bill-paying, like most important
activities related to the practical
side of going to Stanford, goes on
in Old Union, across White Plaza
from the Bookstore. Go to the Cas
hier's Office to pay your bill, but if
you have any questions about a
bill, you're best off starting in the
Bursar's Office. Old Union is also
home to the offices of Credentials,
Scheduling, Housing, Admissions
and Graduate Studies, to name a
few.
I'll be a high school senior in the
Jail and am interested in attend
ing Stanford next year. What do I
do?
You can obtain application in
formation from the Undergradu
ate Admissions office on the
second floor of Old Union. Admis
sions directors will also be able to
answer a lot of your questions
about undergraduate education at
Stanford. Applications probably
won't be available in the summer,
so the best bet is to leave your
name and address with the Ad
missions Office, and they'll send
you an application as soon as
they're available in the fall. The
application deadline is Dec. 15.
How can I get a job on campus?
There's rarely a shortage of em
ployment opportunities at Stan
ford. Check the Help Wanted list

ings in the classified section of
The Daily, as well as the Help
Wanted board at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center. In ad
dition, University Food Service is
almost always hiring (and paying
the rather lucrative University
minimum wage), as are the food
service organizations in Tresid
der.
Don't be bound to campus
though. Downtown Palo Alto is
only a short bike ride away, and
many of the businesses there were
displaying Help Wanted signs as
the regular school year came to a
close.
How the hell do Ifigure out where
my classes are around here, es
pecially in the Quad?
The safest thing to do is carry
the current time schedule with
you any time you venture out in
search of a class until you get a
feel for the place. Class entries in
the time schedule include class lo
cation, usually in a very cryptic
code that is explained on the
inside back cover of the time

schedule. Quad classroom num
bers are particularly strange.
Buildings in the Quad are num
bered by tens, beginning with
Building One in the Inner Quad
almost directly opposite the
Church, progressing clockwise
around the Inner Quad to Build
ing 110, then jumping to the
Outer Quad and making another
clockwise, incrementally-increas
ing trip around. A classroom as
signment like 50-52 D means
Building 50 in the Quad (right
next to the Church), the second
floor (50-51 would be the first
floor), classroom D. Simple
enough, right? Right.
What's the best place to study?
This is a very subjective ques
tion, and the answer has to be
something of a personal matter.
Top centenders, though, include
Cubberley and Green Libraries,
History Corner and the Medical
School Library. Cubberley has at

mosphere (huge wooden tables,
cozy wooden chairs, towering
bookshelves); Green has atmos
phere and comfort (but don't go
there if you're even slightly
drowsy, unless you plan to study
in the hard wooden chairs of the
West or South Stacks); History
Corner has atmosphere, comfort
and privacy (try the enormous
first floor rooms that look out on
the Oval); the Med School Library
just has raw intensity.
The University boasts an
amazing array of libraries and
other spots to study at. Sample
widely, then settle down in your
favorite.
Why does the University use a
tree as a symbol?
The tree in the Stanford seal is a
representation of a hundred-foot
tall redwood that has stood for
centuries at the corner of what is
now the Stanford campus.
Throughout the eighteenth cen
tury, Spanish explorers, mis
sionaries and soldiers traveling up
and down on El Camino Real used
the tree as a landmark, and called
it "Palo Alto," Spanish for "high
tree."
Leland Stanford took the name
for his Palo Alto Stock Farm,
which later became the grounds of
Stanford University. Eventually
the name passed to the town
which sprang up alongside the
new University.
According to the booklet
"Stanford From the Beginning,"
the tree was adopted for the school
seal not only because of its histori
cal significance, but also "because
it symbolizes the strength, inde
pendence and enduring qualities
which a great university must
possess."
How do I go about Joining the
Band or The Daily or any other
campus organization, for that
matter?
Most organizations at Stanford
are remarkably accessible to any
and all interested students. The
easiest way to get involved is stop
by the organization's "headquar
ters" and talk to somebody who
looks like they might know what
they're doing. The Band Shak on
Galvez Avenue is home to the
Band, The Daily's offices are
housed in the Storke Student
Publications Building on the cor
ner of Lomita and Santa Teresa
near the Terman Engineering
Building. You could also just call
the particular organization you're
interested in. Best of luck!

named after Leland Stanford Jr.,
son of railroad magnate and Cali
fornia Governor Leland Stanford.
See page 7 for more history.
Where do I go to pay my bills?
Bill-paying, like most important
activities related to the practical
side of going to Stanford, goes on
in Old Union, across White Plaza
from the Bookstore. Go to the Cas
hier's Office to pay your bill, but if
you have any questions about a
bill, you're best off starting in the
Bursar's Office. Old Union is also
home to the offices of Credentials,
Scheduling, Housing, Admissions
and Graduate Studies, to name a
few.
I'll be a high school senior in the
Jail and am interested in attend
ing Stanford next year. What do I
do?
You can obtain application in
formation from the Undergradu
ate Admissions office on the
second floor of Old Union. Admis
sions directors will also be able to
answer a lot of your questions
about undergraduate education at
Stanford. Applications probably
won't be available in the summer,
so the best bet is to leave your
name and address with the Ad
missions Office, and they'll send
you an application as soon as
they're available in the fall. The
application deadline is Dec. 15.
How can I get a job on campus?
There's rarely a shortage of em
ployment opportunities at Stan
ford. Check the Help Wanted list

ings in the classified section of
The Daily, as well as the Help
Wanted board at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center. In ad
dition, University Food Service is
almost always hiring (and paying
the rather lucrative University
minimum wage), as are the food
service organizations in Tresid
der.
Don't be bound to campus
though. Downtown Palo Alto is
only a short bike ride away, and
many of the businesses there were
displaying Help Wanted signs as
the regular school year came to a
close.
How the hell do Ifigure out where
my classes are around here, es
pecially in the Quad?
The safest thing to do is carry
the current time schedule with
you any time you venture out in
search of a class until you get a
feel for the place. Class entries in
the time schedule include class lo
cation, usually in a very cryptic
code that is explained on the
inside back cover of the time

schedule. Quad classroom num
bers are particularly strange.
Buildings in the Quad are num
bered by tens, beginning with
Building One in the Inner Quad
almost directly opposite the
Church, progressing clockwise
around the Inner Quad to Build
ing 110, then jumping to the
Outer Quad and making another
clockwise, incrementally-increas
ing trip around. A classroom as
signment like 50-52 D means
Building 50 in the Quad (right
next to the Church), the second
floor (50-51 would be the first
floor), classroom D. Simple
enough, right? Right.
What's the best place to study?
This is a very subjective ques
tion, and the answer has to be
something of a personal matter.
Top centenders, though, include
Cubberley and Green Libraries,
History Corner and the Medical
School Library. Cubberley has at

mosphere (huge wooden tables,
cozy wooden chairs, towering
bookshelves); Green has atmos
phere and comfort (but don't go
there if you're even slightly
drowsy, unless you plan to study
in the hard wooden chairs of the
West or South Stacks); History
Corner has atmosphere, comfort
and privacy (try the enormous
first floor rooms that look out on
the Oval); the Med School Library
just has raw intensity.
The University boasts an
amazing array of libraries and
other spots to study at. Sample
widely, then settle down in your
favorite.
Why does the University use a
tree as a symbol?
The tree in the Stanford seal is a
representation of a hundred-foot
tall redwood that has stood for
centuries at the corner of what is
now the Stanford campus.
Throughout the eighteenth cen
tury, Spanish explorers, mis
sionaries and soldiers traveling up
and down on El Camino Real used
the tree as a landmark, and called
it "Palo Alto," Spanish for "high
tree."
Leland Stanford took the name
for his Palo Alto Stock Farm,
which later became the grounds of
Stanford University. Eventually
the name passed to the town
which sprang up alongside the
new University.
According to the booklet
"Stanford From the Beginning,"
the tree was adopted for the school
seal not only because of its histori
cal significance, but also "because
it symbolizes the strength, inde
pendence and enduring qualities
which a great university must
possess."
How do I go about Joining the
Band or The Daily or any other
campus organization, for that
matter?
Most organizations at Stanford
are remarkably accessible to any
and all interested students. The
easiest way to get involved is stop
by the organization's "headquar
ters" and talk to somebody who
looks like they might know what
they're doing. The Band Shak on
Galvez Avenue is home to the
Band, The Daily's offices are
housed in the Storke Student
Publications Building on the cor
ner of Lomita and Santa Teresa
near the Terman Engineering
Building. You could also just call
the particular organization you're
interested in. Best of luck!

Have you ever wanted to ask a
question that seemed so dumb
that you were too embarrassed to
ask anybody? Sure you have. In
order to keep you from looking
foolish, listed below are some
answers to the most commonly
asked stupid questions about the
Farm.
How do I know what's going on
around campus?
Keep an eye on the Once Around
the Quad listings in The Daily
(which comes out twice a week —
Tuesdays and Fridays — during
the summer). In addition, the
calendar on the back page of the
weekly Campus Report is very
helpful, listing all kinds of con
certs, exhibits and meetings. The
information booth and various
bulletin boards at Tresidder
Memorial Union will also help you.
Why is it called a "junior univer
sity"?
It's not. Stanford is a university
named after Leland Stanford Jr.,
son of railroad magnate and Cali
fornia Governor Leland Stanford.
