# How to speak Stanfordese

"Yo dude, let's, like, blow off the
So Fo Po ho and hit the Co Po for
some fro yo, whaddya say? Then
we can hop in the Hoop or go visit
Joe at Go Co, unless he's nerding
out at Mem Chu again."
For those of you who are new to
campus and may have been as
saulted by a stream of monosyl
labic gibberish like the one above,
only to be left wondering just what
sort of new and unusual drugs the
speaker had been experimenting
with, here's a translation of the
above quotation from Stanfordese
into English:
"Hey, don't you feel that we
should shirk our academic re
sponsibilities, put aside our So
viet Foreign Policy homework and
go to the Corner Pocket for some
frozen yogurt? Then we might feel
inclined to go fountain-hopping in
the Shumway Fountain near
Green Library, which so strongly
resembles the rim of a basketball
hoop; or failing that, we could
visit Joe out at his Governor's Cor
ner residence, unless he is spend
ing Saturday night in Memorial
Church praying again."
- Stanford students have
developed a language of their own
to describe their campus and life.
Whether out of linguistic laziness
or a warped desire to be hip, they
reduce many words to truncated
one-syllable grunts. Memorial
Church becomes "Mem Chu"
(sounds like a brand of chewing
gum or tobacco, not a place of
God) and Memorial Auditorium is
"Mem Aud."
Whether you as an individual
decide to adopt this particular
idiom is solely up to you, but the
following listing of acronyms, ab
breviations and other
catchphrases may at least help
you be an active, understanding
recipient of this type of communi
cation rather than a passive, in
comprehending victim of it.

For those of you who are new to
campus and may have been as
saulted by a stream of monosyl
labic gibberish like the one above,
only to be left wondering just what
sort of new and unusual drugs the
speaker had been experimenting
with, here's a translation of the
above quotation from Stanfordese
into English:
"Hey, don't you feel that we
should shirk our academic re
sponsibilities, put aside our So
viet Foreign Policy homework and
go to the Corner Pocket for some
frozen yogurt? Then we might feel
inclined to go fountain-hopping in
the Shumway Fountain near
Green Library, which so strongly
resembles the rim of a basketball
hoop; or failing that, we could
visit Joe out at his Governor's Cor
ner residence, unless he is spend
ing Saturday night in Memorial
Church praying again."
- Stanford students have
developed a language of their own
to describe their campus and life.
Whether out of linguistic laziness
or a warped desire to be hip, they
reduce many words to truncated
one-syllable grunts. Memorial
Church becomes "Mem Chu"
(sounds like a brand of chewing
gum or tobacco, not a place of
God) and Memorial Auditorium is
"Mem Aud."
