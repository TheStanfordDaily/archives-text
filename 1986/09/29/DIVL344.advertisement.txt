WALK-IN HOUSING
Walk-in assignments for vacancies in University housing begin

der Union. If you are registered and unassigned, you are eligible.
Contact the Stanford Housing Center, Old Union 317, for more
details.
When was the last time you read a
bestseller for science class?
1. Would you like a math professor who demonstrates minimal surfaces
with soap bubbles?
2. Would you like a physics professor who responds to fundamental
questions with "I don't know; nobody knows"?
3. Would you like an engineering professor who builds problem-solving
skills by asking you to make animal noises?
4. Would you like to know why we don't all drive electric cars or how to
find the constellation Myopia or what would cause the slowing of time
in a fast rocket?
Last year, a senior in history found that she liked quantum physics, an
artist wrote a paper on lasers, and we discovered that Dante's Inferno
contains references to four-dimensional spheres.
VTSS 51, 52, 53 satisfies your area 6 (math), 7 (natural science), and 8
(technology) requirements. Take it in sequence or on the lay-away plan
(succeeding quarters in future years).
For further information, stop by the VTSS office in Building 370. Sign
up for the class and have a ride on the electric trike (built for the class by
an international relations major); bring a friend.
Class meets MWF 1:15 - 2:05 in 370-370.
