# Drug-testing, AIDS research tops summer news
## 
### 
The summer of 1986 saw a continuation of
some of the important news stories of the pre
vious school year (the DUs and the anti
apartheid movement) and the development of
some potential sources of controversey (drug
testing of athletes and a suit by the United Stan
ford Workers)
What follows is a brief review of the major
news stories of the summer.
Drug testing
The University is expected to initiate a drug
testing program for its athletes beginning in
1987.
According to Faculty Athletic Representative
Jack Friedenthal, the decision was made in
response to new NCAA requirements that all
athletes must participate in drug testing before
all NCAA post-season championships and bowl
games. Under the new regulations, if one mem
ber of a team tests positive for drug use, the
entire team will be forced to forfeit the game.
Once the NCAA program is implemented,
Stanford teams with the possibility of advancing
to post-season competition would have to un
dergo testing in order to "give our people
some sort of protection," Friedenthal said.

AIDS grant
Stanford Medical Schcxjl received in July an
$8.1 million share of a government-sponsored
project aimed at finding a cure for AIDS.
The $100 million, five-year study will concen
trate on testing drugs that have shown the po
tential to counteract the AIDS virus. It could en
roll as many as 1,000 AIDS patients.
In addition to the Medical School, 13 other
research institutions nationwide will participate
in the program, to he coordinated by the Na
tional Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID).
Dr. William Robinson, a professor of infec
tious diseases at the Medical School, has called
$8.1 million share the largest grant ever for in
fectious disease research.
UC divestment
The University of California regents decided
July 18 to divest of the system's $3.1 billion in
vested in companies that do business in South
Africa.
While anti-apartheid protestors here said the
move would pressure Stanford to divest of
its $182 million in South Africa-related stock,
Stanford officials predicted the move would

have little immediate impact on Stanford's in
vestment posture.
The 13-9 vote on the UC divestment came
two days after California Gov. George Deuk
mejian announced in a letter to the regents a
reversal of his position on state investments in
South Africa-related companies.
Pie-throwers punished
The University withheld the diploma of
former Chaparral editor Ron Herbst and pun
ished two other staff members of the magazine
as a result of their involvement in a pie
throwing incident at the final ASSU meeting last
spring.
All three — Herbst, junior Josh Weinstein
and sophomore Joe Dew — were ordered to
develop guidelines to prevent pranks at future
ASSU meetings, and Herbst and Dew were also
told to write letters of apology to the ASSU Sen
ate, according to Herbst.
He said he and Dew were given a choice of
paying $50 or performing 10 hours of commu
nity service. Weinstein, who wrote a letter of
apology to the senate the day after the incident,
was given a lighter penalty: $25 or five hours of
community service.
Until the conditions of the penalty are met,

Herbst will not receive his diploma and Dew
and Weinstein will not be reinstated as stu
dents, according to Herbst
Ferruolo tenure
Asst. Prof. Stephen Ferruolo, who was denied
tenure by the History Department in January,
has been given another chance because of an
ambiguity in Stanford's new tenure review
policy.
A grievance officer found that a new rule re
quiring comparison of a tenure candidate's
work to that of foremost scholars in his field
had been too stringently applied when a tenure
review committee evaluated Ferruolo. The offi
cer, Political Science Prof. Gabriel Almond, also
found that the committee did not solicit letters
from Stanford medieval scholars in other de
partments, a procedure required by the Univer
sity's guidelines.
A new tenure evaluation committee will be
organized and a new letter consistent with the
criteria outlined in the 1984 Faculty Handbook
will be drawn up to send to both external and
internal referees when the department recon
siders his candidacy in r he fall, Ferruolo said.

DU damage
Based on the discovery of nearly $20,000 in
property damage to the University-owned Delta
Upsilon fraternity house, University officials
plan to impose a lengthening of the fraternity s
revocation period, Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin said in July.
According to Norm Robinson, associate dean
of Student Affairs, the extent of destruction is
' 'extraordinarily large.
However, members of the fraternity, which
had its charter and housing privilages revoked
in May, claimed they had been unfairly assessed
for damages for which they were not respon
sible. DU house manager Greg Gamble said the
property damage reflected "deterioration (of
the house) rather than damage."
A damage bill totaling $19,636.13 has been
sent to members of the fraternity, Conklin said.
She added that $13,606.64 worth of damage had
been found in the common areas of the house
and would be assessed proportionally to all res
idents of the fraternity. Additionally, $6,029.49
of damage was discovered in individual
bedrooms and will be billed to the residents of
those rooms.
Road closed
The section of Escondido Road between Alvarado
and Arguello roads was closed permanently to mi>tor
traffic and will become a landscaped walkway, the
University announced in August.
Plans for the walkway — located in front of Stern
Hall and between Stern and Sweet Hall — call for
wooden benches, isolated grassy areas and shrub
bery along the path.
USW sues
United Stanford Workers (USW) officials filed suit
in federal district court in late July charging that the
University is not arbitrating grievances submitted un
der the labor contract signed last year.
In its suit, "he union said the University is still
hearing the backlog of arbitrations filed during the
life of the old contract.

According to University Staff Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler, the University's policy — to handle the ar
bitration backlog chronologically — is in accordance
with the new contract.
In a related story, the California Labor Commis
sioner dismissed in July a complaint charging that
Victor Hill, a USW worker accused of vandalism, was
fired from his job for failing to fill out safety com
plaints with the state.
In his claim, H.ll stated that he was discharged as a
University shipper and receiver for refusing to wear
the required steel-toed shoes. The University,
however, has said Hill was fired soley for slashing the
tires of his operational manager, Hector Allen.
The commisioner noted in his concluding state
ment that "there is no evidence to support (Hill's)
contention" that he was discharged because of his
refusal to wear the shoes.
Perkins sues
Recent graduate Robby Perkins filed a $600,000
suit against the University and Santa Clara County, al
leging brutality and race discrimination during and
after his arrest at a campus anti-apartheid sit-in last

October.
The suit, submitted June 27 at the U.S. Dictrict
Court in San Jose, seeks $100,000 in general damages
and 1500,000 in punitive and exemplary damages.
The suit names several defendants, among them Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy, Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington, Santa Clara County Sheriff
Robert Winter and eight officers present during the
arrest.
Appointments
Ruth Schneider was named director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center (CPPC) in July by
James Lyons, dean of Student Affairs.
Thomas Ambrogi, a leader in the sanctuary move
ment and former Jesuit priest, became acting dean of
Stanford Memorial Church on Sept. 1.
In his one-year appointment, during which a na
tional search for a permanent dean will take place,
Ambrogi will have two major roles: pastor of
Memorial Church and dean of Religious Affairs for
the Stanford community.
