## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Editor's welcome 
### 
It was exactly two years ago today that 1 first set foot in
the office of The Stanford Daily. The staff was holding a
meeting for freshmen interested in writing, and an en
thusiastic editor exclaimed that The Daily ranked as one
of the best college papers in the country while also pro
viding a great place to learn about journalism and have
fun.
Could it be all that? Sure, that's what they're saying
every college paper in the country this fall, I thought at
the time. But two years later, I find myself repeating the
same encouraging words and heartily believing them.
Every night when the last page is completed, even if it's
so late that most sane people have been asleep for hours,
there is a tremendous sense of accomplishment shared
by all 50 or so people who had a hand in producing the
issue.
The Daily is all of the things that that editor said it was
two years ago, but the potential is there to make it even
better. The beginning of a new volume, and, more im
portant, the start of a new year provide a perfect chance
to build on that potential.
Since the most common complaint seems to be that
the ink rubs off on your best white clothing, I assume
readers think we are doing something right. But ink is
not the biggest problem with The Daily. As the size of the
paper and variety of stories in it have grown over the
years, producing it every night has become a more diffi
cult task, and as a result, the paper has been returning to
campus from the printer later and later with every
volume. More than one reader last year caiiea The Daily
"The Stanford Evening News." This year, we will be
more efficient, and Stanford will have a morning paper
again. We may postpone coverage of a late-night event in

order to get the paper out on time, but the result will be
a more dependable Daily, and, we hope, a better in
formed community.
The other changes in The Daily will be largely superfi
cial. The paper will look slightly different, with a new
front page look and a new typeface, and, for the first time
in several years, ads may sit side-by-side with stories. The
natioiVworld section will move to page 2, and front page
news stories will jump to the back page.
But in purpose and commitment, The Daily will
remain the same as it has been in past years, trying to
provide comprehensive and thought-provoking
coverage of this dynamic and ever-active community.
One of the greatest challenges to The Daily is informing
the Stanford community while also training journalists
and providing an opportunity for students to be writers
and columnists. Most of the errors that do get by — and
editors are as upset by them as you — result from the un
easy tension between these two sometimes conflicting
goals. The secret is to develop a balance, and we hope
we will be equal to the task.
Let us know how we are doing or, better yet, come in
and help out. There are dozens of jobs required every
day, and everyone — no matter in what capacity — plays
an important role. But whether you are a casual reader
or an active contributor, I hope you find The Daily as ad
dictive, challenging and true to the words of a former
Daily editor as I have.
