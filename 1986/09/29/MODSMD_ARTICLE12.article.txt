McCloskey attack
against Jews
is opportunistic
Former Congressman Pete McClos
key s (R-Calif.) recent foray attacking
"the Jews" in Stanford's History De
partment fits into his growing pattern
of denouncing American Jews to
enhance the visibility of his own
career. Mr. McCloskey's main public
actions in recent years have been
attacks upon Jews as a stereotyped
group in American politics.
McCloskey quickly adopted Norman
Davies' cause as an opportunity once
again to denounce a conspiracy in
which "the Jews" promote their ethnic
interests at the expense of others. He
is apparently anxious to confront what
he believes to be the conspiratorial
power of this ethnic group in any area
where he sees the chance to win an
audience. Without knowing what was
said at the meeting, McCloskey
declared that Davies was denied
tenure because six Jewish professors
"castigated" a chapter in his latest
book for alleged anti-Semitic in
ferences.
In fact, Stanford Provost James
Rosse soon issued a seven-page letter
explaining that history faculty had
listed a series of lapses of scholarly
judgment on Davies' behalf having
nothing to do with his treatment of
Polish-Jewish relations. History Profes
sor Alexander Dallin, who was on the
search committee that originally
recommended Davies, comments that
the Polish-Jewish issue should never
have been singled out since it was
only "one issue out of 12 that came
up." Furthermore, there is no
evidence yet available that Davies was
ever accused of anti-Semitic leanings

by anybody.
In singling out six Jewish profes
sors, McCloskey does not discuss the
six other professors who voted the
same way. Without evidence as to
professors' motivations, McCloskey
imposes his bigotry in assuming their
behavior is determined by ethnicity,
not scholarly judgment. Thus, he
argues that Davies was denied tenure
because he departed from the "Zionist
view of the history of Poland."
This is not only ludicrous in light of
what is publicly known about the
Davies decision, but is patently offen
sive in its portrayal of a Jewish con
spiracy in Stanford's History Depart
ment.
This prejudiced tone is not new for
McCloskey. He declared in 1982, for
example, that "You're either an Ameri
can for American policy, or you're a
Jew who puts Israel ahead of the U.S."
Such generalized, unsubstantiated and
invidious attacks attest to McCloskey's
assumption that individuals derive
their political views a priori from
their ethnic identity, which inherently
casts doubt on their judgment and
loyalty. This reasoning is a classic case
of bigotry.
McCloskey's public attacks in recent
years against what he calls "the Jewish
lobby" has been zealously extended
into a generalized attack against pro
fessors based on their religion. His
apparent "Jewphobia," publicly
flaunted, is not only a slur against
Stanford's History Department, but is
a frightful reminder that when such
logic has been carried to an extreme,
books by Jewish authors have been
burned.

Reader finds
Daily biased
You have invited me to renew my
subscription to The Daily. I decline to
do so, and would like to tell you why.
I have certainly enjoyed reading about
the events on campus, particularly
since my son attends Stanford.
However, I get enough of leftist bias
in the media as it is. The Washington
Post gives me a plentiful dose of it,
not to mention other nearby
newspapers (The New York Times,
etc.) as well as the electronic media.
What your reporters, along with the
majority of the media, fail to realize is
how out of touch they are with the
overwhelming number of Americans.
The press and academia are today the
last bastions of liberalism (and I use
that term in its pejorative sense) and
are fighting a desperate but losing
battle against a rising tide of freedom:
free markets, increased personal
liberty, free association, and all the
other principles of true liberalism.
Thank you for your consideration,
but until I see a significant change in
your reporters' tendentiousness (and
I'm not holding my breath on that), I
decline your kind offer.
