# Protesters lack commitment
## 
### 
If, during last spring quarter at Stanford University, you
wandered across the campus to White Plaza or the Stanford
Quadrangle only to witness the congregation of a hundred
or so tanned and sunglassed bodies basking in the sun, it is
indeed possible that you have stumbled upon the 1980s ver
sion of organized campus protest: the call for Stanford to
sell its investments in companies that have operations in
South Africa. Divestment, in short.
Sorry. I tried not to be cynical. For over a year now, stu
dents across the country — through various modes of
popular protest — have pressed their universities to divest.
They have staged sit-ins, held mass meetings and built
"shanties." The fact is, it is very difficult to be objective, es
pecially considering that the protesters are burdened to
meet two conditions: First, they must convince the commu
nity that divestment is the most expedient route toward a
South African society free of apartheid; and second, they

must show that they are credible when they say, "Yes, I sin
cerely believe in and am committed to the idea of divest
ment to end apartheid."
Everyone pretty much agrees that apartheid is unjust, is
evil. However, the belief that this universal condemnation
means that all morality, all virtue and all reason rest indi
vestment as the most feasible solution is one of those syl
logistic connections that proponents of divestment firmly
maintain. By the same token, the protesters suggest that op
position to divestment intimates opposition to the abolition
of apartheid, which in many ways distances concerned stu
dents from the struggle in South Africa and certainly from
the campus movement in support of that struggle.
This brings us to the second condition that protesters
face: whether they can dismiss suspicions of hypocrisy and
unfounded idealism and convince the community of their
deep-rooted sincerity and commitment. This, I think, is
central to successful demonstrations, for as long as a barrier
of cynicism remains, none of the cries to divest will be
heard.
It is very difficult to detect commitment in the various
forms of modern campus protest. The demonstrators them
selves make few, if any, sacrifices. It's easy and pointless to
confront authority — any authority. It isn't a big deal; it in
volves no costs at all — totally risk-free. In the divestment
radicalism of the 1980s this challenge has taken the form of
hostile letters to the editor (of The Stanford Daily),>
vituperative notices left on the cars of Stanford Trustees,
publicly impugning the integrity and morality of (University
President) Donald Kennedy and University administrators,
and the übiquitous "Fuck Stanford" sweatshirts.
In none of these instances, however, were students
forced to overcome any trepidation and face consequences
for their "disobedience." Yet, their defiance manages to sus
tain their delusions of greatness. And because of University
administrators' hesitation in punishing those offenders
whose actions breach University policy, student protesters
face little or no punishment. No cost to protest.
The point I'm getting at is this: Without a showing of
resolve and commitment, it's much harder to convince your
audience that you believe what you say and, more impor
tantly, that your wav is the best way. Anyone can stand in the

middle of White Plaza at noon and, with a megaphone in
hand, screech, "Divest now," step down from the platform
and go about one's daily, uninterrupted life. No real cost
there, other than a few hours spent in the sun. Being forced
to do the same on the face of intolerable (or even not so in
tolerable) odds speaks a helluva lot louder than rhetoric,
and sometimes louder than reason. Lacking this, many stu
dents perceive demonstrations as superficial and obtrusive.
If there were sanctioas within the university to prevent
campus disruption — say, threaten sit-in participants with a
one-year academic suspension — then students would have
an easier time making the kind of disquieting symbolic
statements that move and convince people. People are more
apt to listen, recognizing that these protesters, in spite of the
fact that they have a tremendous amount to lose, are first
concerned about the sufferings of black South Africans half
way around the globe, a concern that runs so deep that they
make personal sacrifices toward the end of that suffering.
Recent history teaches a dramatic lesson in effective
protest. Consider the exploits of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
and the civil rights movement he inspired. King and his fol
lowers faced adversity on a daily basis and made huge
sacrifices to advance the cause of civil rights for minorities.
He endured imprisonment, harsh physical and verbal at
tacks and demoralization at the hands of an oppressive
white society determined to humiliate the black race. He
knew the great costs that his role entailed or at least he
quickly became familiar with it.
When black men and women joined and
boycotted the buses, it was at great inconvenience. Those
white men and women who openly sympathized with the
civil rights movement were scorned by their peers, yet their
commitment ran deep, and they pressed for equality in spite
of it all. That kind of commitment is incredibly daunting,
and it readily captures the minds — if not the hearts — of
those who would otherwise not see the deep wounds that
social injustice breeds.
How many college students, I wonder, are so committed
to divestment that they'd willingly endure personal sacrifice
in the fight for that cause? Can they take a bold step and
divest themselves in a much more individualistic statement,
by refusing to purchase or retain products from companies
that do business in South Africa? This, of course, means get
ting rid of many appliances, many conveniences. Wouldn't
this be a much more effective form of protest?
Perhaps I got carried away by what I perceive to be the
relative ease with which modern demonstrators make self
righteous proclamations about the sufferings of black
people in South Africa without really having to grapple with
the real tensions of taking an active, unequivocal stand.
People want to see commitment, sincere commitment.
And it ought to be a primary objective of organized protests
to communicate that commitment. 1 don't mean to detract
from the terrors that black South Africans confront daily by
centering my discussion on young American activists. And
I'm certainly not suggesting that the students drop out of
school and fly over to South Africa to join the fight for
freedom. I'm just not moved by those who would have me
think that a great personal sacrifice was made by missing
lunch to build a shanty.
