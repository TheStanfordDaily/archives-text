## No direction home: Steinbeck drives America 
### BRUCE BROWN Editorial staff 
"Travels With Charley," John Steinbeck's ac
count of a cross-country driving expedition he
undertook in the late 1950s — one in which he
was accompanied only by his French poodle
Charley — is not a book for anyone who has
simply packed up a car and driven across the
country. Rather, it is for those who have not
only done this, but also have used the opportu
nity — the seemingly endless hours and
stretches of highway — to turn off the radio and
use the open road for what it provides best: a
place to break away from the routine of daily
life and reflect upon the larger issues or ques
tions that tend to get buried with the contained
order of life in this country.
Mr. Steinbeck, whose trip was made in a
truck called "Rocinante" (named after Don
Quixote's horse) laden with all the essentials of
a long sojourn — everything from food to liq
uor to soap powder to plastic bags to flash
lights, takes his journey in an attempt to redis
cover his America: its people, the way they talk
and the words they use, their concerns and
worries and hopes. But most of all he takes this
adventure because it is something he himself
needs. He states in his prefatory remarks that
he simply has a restlessness that neither time
and maturity nor adulthood and its responsi
bilities had ever properly quelled.
His itinery takes him first from New York
State, where he sets out full of expectation,
through pan of New England — Vermont and
New Hampshire — to Maine. What he empha
sizes in this section is the remarkably laconic
demeanors of the people he meets. One finds
Steinbeck, in situations such as this, building

upon, even if unintentionally, the traditional
stereotypes of regional America. (Just how
many breakfast places are there where no one
speaks a word?) The same thing, one could add,

occurs when he travels through Texas on the
way home, noting again and again how
hospitable and generous — hut also how
fiercely proud — the Texans are.

His chosen route — perhaps the odd thing
about this hook is the plotted quality about it,
the sense of direction throughout, although it
purports to be a book about the spontaneity ot
highway travel — then turns West and he
begins the long trek to California. He goes by
Niagara Falls and, after being denied entry into
Canada because he didn't have the necessary
health and immunization forms for Charley, he
drives through Pennsylvania and Ohio and into
Michigan. Here, he drives down to Chicago,
where his wife flies to join him and give him a
brief respite from his labors.
For, in a sense, they are labors. He has taken
weeks to get to Chicago, to cover an amount ot
distance that his wife speeds over in an after
noon, and he has sat around in coffee shops,
camped in trailer parks, solicited coversation
from the most unlikely of fellow-travelers. And
he does relate to us, in a fictionalized form,
many of these vignettes. Hut the problem that a
reader may develop is a wariness of the veracity
or likelihood of these dialogues for the very
fact that they are spruced up with a sense of the
fictional. Yet Steinbeck wants one to believe in
these words. He wants us to believe they are
the words of the common man of the road, the
gut-to-mouth thoughts of the everyday Ameri
can consciousness. But they seem too much a
part of well-developed narrative frame, too
convieniently belonging there to be part of a
patchwork trip across the country.
Thus, by the time Steinbeck leaves Chicago
and heads up to Minneapolis/St. Paul, and then
West — North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and
then into California and the Monterey Penin
sula where the writer grew up — one begins to
look not so much for the particulars about

America that he finds, but rather for insights
into the creative life of a future Nobel Laureate
who has snatched a moment of time for the ex
pressive purpose of letting his mind re
examine and sharpen itself. So while there is
no dearth of vignettes in this section, (there is a
certain one that is so absurd — he intervenes in
a dispute between a father and son concerning
the son's desire to be a hairdresser — that any
reader would be dubious) what one is inter
ested in is not John Steinbeck in search of
America, but John Steinbeck in search of him
self.
And what he discovers on the road, beyond
the essential loneliness broken most often only
with the hours of playful banter with Charley,
who serves as a kind of sounding board for the
author when he ruminates aloud, is the undeni
able fact that as one travels through the world —
in this case, across America — what one finds in
every view or each landmark is the indelible
print of one's own subjectivity. "It would be
pleasant", he writes, "to say of my travels with
Charley, I went out to find the truth about my
country and I found it.' And then it would be
such a simple matter to set down my findings
and lean back comfortably with a fine sense of
having discovered truths and taught them to my
readers. 1 wish it were that easy. But what I
carried in my head and deeper in my percep
tions was a barrel of worms. I discovered long
ago in collecting and classifying marine animals
that what I found was closely intermeshed with
how I felt at the moment. External reality has a
way of being not so external after all."
John Steinbeck studied some of that marine
biology here at Stanford, but he left without re
ceiving a degree. Must have been that old rest
lessness.

country and I found it.' And then it would be
such a simple matter to set down my findings
and lean back comfortably with a fine sense of
having discovered truths and taught them to my
readers. 1 wish it were that easy. But what I
carried in my head and deeper in my percep
tions was a barrel of worms. I discovered long
ago in collecting and classifying marine animals
that what I found was closely intermeshed with
how I felt at the moment. External reality has a
way of being not so external after all."
John Steinbeck studied some of that marine
biology here at Stanford, but he left without re
ceiving a degree. Must have been that old rest
lessness.

"Travels With Charley," John Steinbeck's ac
count of a cross-country driving expedition he
undertook in the late 1950s — one in which he
was accompanied only by his French poodle
Charley — is not a book for anyone who has
simply packed up a car and driven across the
country. Rather, it is for those who have not
only done this, but also have used the opportu
nity — the seemingly endless hours and
stretches of highway — to turn off the radio and
use the open road for what it provides best: a
place to break away from the routine of daily
life and reflect upon the larger issues or ques
tions that tend to get buried with the contained
order of life in this country.
Mr. Steinbeck, whose trip was made in a
truck called "Rocinante" (named after Don
Quixote's horse) laden with all the essentials of
a long sojourn — everything from food to liq
uor to soap powder to plastic bags to flash
lights, takes his journey in an attempt to redis
cover his America: its people, the way they talk
and the words they use, their concerns and
worries and hopes. But most of all he takes this
adventure because it is something he himself
needs. He states in his prefatory remarks that
he simply has a restlessness that neither time
and maturity nor adulthood and its responsi
bilities had ever properly quelled.
His itinery takes him first from New York
State, where he sets out full of expectation,
through pan of New England — Vermont and
New Hampshire — to Maine. What he empha
sizes in this section is the remarkably laconic
demeanors of the people he meets. One finds
Steinbeck, in situations such as this, building

upon, even if unintentionally, the traditional
stereotypes of regional America. (Just how
many breakfast places are there where no one
speaks a word?) The same thing, one could add,

occurs when he travels through Texas on the
way home, noting again and again how
hospitable and generous — hut also how
fiercely proud — the Texans are.

His chosen route — perhaps the odd thing
about this hook is the plotted quality about it,
the sense of direction throughout, although it
purports to be a book about the spontaneity ot
highway travel — then turns West and he
begins the long trek to California. He goes by
Niagara Falls and, after being denied entry into
Canada because he didn't have the necessary
health and immunization forms for Charley, he
drives through Pennsylvania and Ohio and into
Michigan. Here, he drives down to Chicago,
where his wife flies to join him and give him a
brief respite from his labors.
For, in a sense, they are labors. He has taken
weeks to get to Chicago, to cover an amount ot
distance that his wife speeds over in an after
noon, and he has sat around in coffee shops,
camped in trailer parks, solicited coversation
from the most unlikely of fellow-travelers. And
he does relate to us, in a fictionalized form,
many of these vignettes. Hut the problem that a
reader may develop is a wariness of the veracity
or likelihood of these dialogues for the very
fact that they are spruced up with a sense of the
fictional. Yet Steinbeck wants one to believe in
these words. He wants us to believe they are
the words of the common man of the road, the
gut-to-mouth thoughts of the everyday Ameri
can consciousness. But they seem too much a
part of well-developed narrative frame, too
convieniently belonging there to be part of a
patchwork trip across the country.
Thus, by the time Steinbeck leaves Chicago
and heads up to Minneapolis/St. Paul, and then
West — North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and
then into California and the Monterey Penin
sula where the writer grew up — one begins to
look not so much for the particulars about

America that he finds, but rather for insights
into the creative life of a future Nobel Laureate
who has snatched a moment of time for the ex
pressive purpose of letting his mind re
examine and sharpen itself. So while there is
no dearth of vignettes in this section, (there is a
certain one that is so absurd — he intervenes in
a dispute between a father and son concerning
the son's desire to be a hairdresser — that any
reader would be dubious) what one is inter
ested in is not John Steinbeck in search of
America, but John Steinbeck in search of him
self.
And what he discovers on the road, beyond
the essential loneliness broken most often only
with the hours of playful banter with Charley,
who serves as a kind of sounding board for the
author when he ruminates aloud, is the undeni
able fact that as one travels through the world —
in this case, across America — what one finds in
every view or each landmark is the indelible
print of one's own subjectivity. "It would be
pleasant", he writes, "to say of my travels with
Charley, I went out to find the truth about my
country and I found it.' And then it would be
such a simple matter to set down my findings
and lean back comfortably with a fine sense of
