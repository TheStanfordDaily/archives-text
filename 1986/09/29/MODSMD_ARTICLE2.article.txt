# Defense slaughters Beavers
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — For those just arriving on
campus, we note a couple of changes in this year's
edition of Stanford football: 1) This team is win
ning games; 2) the defense is leading the way.
You may remember Stanford football from years
past: many points scored, more given up, losing
seasons. Five in a row, to be exact. Saturday's 17-7
victory over Oregon State in front of 21,125
drenched and disappointed Beaver fans at Parker
Stadium may mean that that old scenario is merely
a memory.
First, the Cardinal is 3-0 for the first time since
1972. Second, the defense came within a question
able call of recording its first shutout since 1974 —
a stretch of 126 games — and shut down a Beaver
passing game that had rolled up 339 yards against
No. 5 Michigan the week before.
"We won two out of three," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "Our defense and special teams played
well. They had a good defense — we just didn't get
it together on offense. We've got to pull that thing
together and get something going.''
"We wanted the shutout. We were excited about

that," senior linebacker David Wyman said. "But
we still got a Pac-10 win."
The shutout was lost with 11 minutes remaining
in the game when Oregon State fullback Pat Chaf
fey leaped high in the end zone to pull down a pass
from backup quarterback Dave McLaughlin. Then
Stanford cornerback Toi Cook met Chaffey. Chaffey
hit the ground, Cook hit the ground, and the ball
hit the ground The official signaled touchdown.
"He fumbled around with the ball, and I thought
I did a good job of stripping him," Cook said. "I
saw the ball on the ground, and then they call it a
touchdown. It was a horrible call.
"We wanted the shutout. It was a tainted victory."
Perhaps not a shutout, but definitely a strong de
fensive performance. Oregon State starting quar
terback Erik Wilhelm had completed 39 of 64
passes for 339 yards against Michigan in the
Beavers' closer-than-the-score 31-12 loss in Ann Ar
bor. Against Stanft, d, Wilhelm was on the sidelines
by the second quarter.
Wilhelm finished 10 of 20 for 51 yards with one
interception. McLaughlin, pitching in relief, was 13
of 22 for 114 yards with two interceptions.
"I think maybe we're getting some respect," said
Cook, whose five interceptions in his first two

games made him the nation's leader. "Against Mi
chigan he (Wilhelm) was drilling the ball into
coverage. Against us he was trying to play it safe. I
think he wanted to go downfield, but he wouldn't
take a chance throwing the ball."
"We had their deep game covered pretty well all
day," said safety Walt Harris, who had two of the
Cardinal's three interceptions. "I don't think they
could have gone deep against us today."
With Brad Humphreys' third pickoff of the
season, the Stanford secondary has 10 intercep
tions so far this year. Humphreys, though, credited
the linebacker play in front of them — especially
the return of Wyman, who missed all of last season
with a knee injury suffered late in the 1984 season.
"That's how I got my pick," Humphreys said.
"He had to throw it high over Dave. That's why we
won — the linebackers. 1 saw the linebackers
knocking down balls left and right."
The Cardinal also sacked Wilhelm and McLaugh
lin eight times. Tackle Tony Leiker and outside
linebacker Chris Weber had two apiece to lead
the defense. Leiker, however, was flagged for a
personal foul when he did a Mark Gastineau-like


Jeff Schneider and his fellow Oregon State defenders were left in

sack dance over Wilhelm's prostrate body. "I
guess I found out I can't celebrate that way,
Leiker said.
The coverage was responsible for several of
those sacks, as the Cardinal stuck mostly to a
three- or four-man rush. To quote the Oregon
State play-by-play sheet: "McLaughlin to pass, all
day to throw, finally sacked at 0-36, loses 11 yds.'
"Erik wasn't reading the defense, and that's
what you have to do in our offense,'' said Oregon
State Coach Dave Kragthorpe, whose team fell to
0-3 in the Pacific-10 Conference opener for both
earns. "It was like he was in a fog. He obviously
wasn't moving the team. What it really boils down
to is that he wasn't making good decisions."
Kragthorpe's defense, though, was playing a
good game, holding Stanford to 243 yards of total
offense. Stanford didn't convert on a third-down
play until four minutes remained in the game.
Junior tailback Brad Muster rushed for 82 yards,
but needed 26 carries to do it. And senior quar
terback John Paye passed for only 140 yards and
was intercepted twice.
Two injuries obviously played a major role.
First, wide receiver Jeff James didn't make the trip
because of a sprained heel suffered last week
against San Jose State. James caught 18 passes in
cluding three touchdowns in his first two game to
lead the nation in receptions, and he and Paye
seemed poised to become the best passing com
bination in the conference.
Second, left tackle Jeff Marchin left the game
early with a pinched nerve in his neck, forcing
right tackle John Zentner to move to the other
side of the line as Robbie Coffin took over
Zentner's spot. Beaver defensive tackle Paul Car
berry then proceeded to take advantage of the
loss and introduce himself to Paye and Muster.
Often. Carberry batted down four passes and
made 12 tackles on the day.
"We miss Jeff," Muster said. "We have confi
dence in the second team, it's just that we didn't
have a lot of practice time with them. There was
some missed communication with the tackles,
some breakdowns."
Kragthorpe said, "In my opinion we had one
guy who was playing good football and a bunch
of guys playing mediocre football. Carberry cer
tainly did an outstanding job."
The Stanford offense looked good to start the
game. On the first drive, Paye took the Cardinal
57 yards to the Oregon State 4 before trying to
throw a pass to freshman wide receiver Ed McCaf
frey through three Beaver defenders. One of
them, cornerback Teddy Johnson, made the inter
ception.
The Beavers didn't get far, as linebacker Barry
McKeever stripped wide receiver Dave Montagne
and Weber recovered at the Oregon State 19. The
Cardinal had to settle for a 28-yard field goal by
David Sweeney to go up 3-0.
Stanford mounted its best drive in the second
quarter as the rain turned from steady to torren
tial. The Cardinal went 55 yards in five plays, with
Muster scoring on a toss right behind a devastat
ing lead block from fullback Brian Morris for a
10-0 Stanford lead at halftime.
To start the second half, senior tailback Kevin
Scott took the kickoff 89 yards untouched for an
apparent touchdown, but the play was called back
on a clipping penalty. The Cardinal regrouped to
drive to the Beaver 18, but Sweeney missed a 35-
yard field to the left.
The defense then got the ball back for the Card
inal when McLaughlin dropped the rain-slickec
ball while scrambling away from Leiker at his
own 14. Tackle Lester Archambeau recovered for
the Cardinal, and four plays later, on fourth-and
four from the Oregon State 8, Paye found tighi
end Eric Snelson at the goal line for a 17-0 lead.
> The third quarter ended with the Beavers

deepest penetration through the first 45 minutes
— to the Stanford 36. The shutout remained in
tact, however, when reserve linebacker Darron
Bennett broke through and blocked Marty
Breen's 53-yard field goal attempt, recovering the
ball at the Oregon State 42.
Paye then threw his second interception of the
day, which Johnson returned to his 49. McLaugh
lin then led the Beavers to the Stanford 18, where
he found Chaffey in the end zone for the ques
tionable touchdown.
The Cardinal had one last chance to score, but
fullback Marshall Dillard fumbled at the Oregon
State 8 with 35 seconds remaining.
Despite the subpar offensive outing, Muster
was smiling about the Cardinal's first conference
win. "It's exciting," he said. "We know we don t
have to score 34 points to win. I'm not too con
cerned about the offense right now. We'll just put
in the practice time and get the whole group to
gether."
Wyman was reflecting that new confidence.
"That's been a problem at Stanford — people
have been satisfied with just winning three or
four games," he said.
"Now we want to take it to people."

'It's exciting.... We
know we don't have to
score 34 points to win.
I'm not too concerned
about the offense right
now.'

Card notes
There will lie a ticket booth in White Plaza today and
tomorrow for students wishing to purchase season tick
ets. The package includes home games against San
Diego-State, Washington, USC and Washington State, as
well as Big Game at California's Memorial Stadium. The
cost is $30. Buying the package is the only way for stu
dents to assure themselves of Big Game tickets.
Corvallis doesn't rank as the most exciting place in
the Pac-10, but Elway seemed in a particular hurry to
get home last night. The team buses pulled out of San
Francisco International Airport before some members
of the group had exited the terminal. Among the
stranded were Assoc. Athletic Director Alan Cumm
mlngs, linebacker Kurt Colehower, Sports Informa
tion Director Steve Raczynski, KCBS' Bob Murphy
and other members of the media.
The San Diego Chicken performed at Saturday's
game, but failed to increase attendence, as rain kept
many fans at home. The Chicken's act was, well, fowl.
McCaffrey is the only first-year freshman expected
to play this season. The wide receiver caught two passes
for 12 yards in place of James.
Defensive tackle Sean Scheller celebrated his 21st
birthday with his first sack of the season.
Stanford held Oregon State to only 27 yards rushing
in 27 attempts. In three games so far, the Beavers have
rushed for 63 yards net, an average of 21 yards per
game.
Punter Doug Robison averaged 45.6 yards per kick,
including one effort of 61 yards and another that was
downed at the Oregon State 1.
Wyman led the Cardinal with 11 tackles to give him
35 in three games. Weber made 10 tackles, with two
sacks and a fumble recovery.

CORVALLIS, Ore. — For those just arriving on
campus, we note a couple of changes in this year's
edition of Stanford football: 1) This team is win
ning games; 2) the defense is leading the way.
You may remember Stanford football from years
past: many points scored, more given up, losing
seasons. Five in a row, to be exact. Saturday's 17-7
victory over Oregon State in front of 21,125
drenched and disappointed Beaver fans at Parker
Stadium may mean that that old scenario is merely
a memory.
First, the Cardinal is 3-0 for the first time since
1972. Second, the defense came within a question
able call of recording its first shutout since 1974 —
a stretch of 126 games — and shut down a Beaver
passing game that had rolled up 339 yards against
No. 5 Michigan the week before.
"We won two out of three," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "Our defense and special teams played
well. They had a good defense — we just didn't get
it together on offense. We've got to pull that thing
together and get something going.''
"We wanted the shutout. We were excited about

that," senior linebacker David Wyman said. "But
we still got a Pac-10 win."
The shutout was lost with 11 minutes remaining
in the game when Oregon State fullback Pat Chaf
fey leaped high in the end zone to pull down a pass
from backup quarterback Dave McLaughlin. Then
Stanford cornerback Toi Cook met Chaffey. Chaffey
hit the ground, Cook hit the ground, and the ball
hit the ground The official signaled touchdown.
"He fumbled around with the ball, and I thought
I did a good job of stripping him," Cook said. "I
saw the ball on the ground, and then they call it a
touchdown. It was a horrible call.
"We wanted the shutout. It was a tainted victory."
Perhaps not a shutout, but definitely a strong de
fensive performance. Oregon State starting quar
terback Erik Wilhelm had completed 39 of 64
passes for 339 yards against Michigan in the
Beavers' closer-than-the-score 31-12 loss in Ann Ar
bor. Against Stanft, d, Wilhelm was on the sidelines
by the second quarter.
Wilhelm finished 10 of 20 for 51 yards with one
interception. McLaughlin, pitching in relief, was 13
of 22 for 114 yards with two interceptions.
"I think maybe we're getting some respect," said
Cook, whose five interceptions in his first two

games made him the nation's leader. "Against Mi
chigan he (Wilhelm) was drilling the ball into
coverage. Against us he was trying to play it safe. I
think he wanted to go downfield, but he wouldn't
take a chance throwing the ball."
"We had their deep game covered pretty well all
day," said safety Walt Harris, who had two of the
Cardinal's three interceptions. "I don't think they
could have gone deep against us today."
With Brad Humphreys' third pickoff of the
season, the Stanford secondary has 10 intercep
tions so far this year. Humphreys, though, credited
the linebacker play in front of them — especially
the return of Wyman, who missed all of last season
with a knee injury suffered late in the 1984 season.
"That's how I got my pick," Humphreys said.
"He had to throw it high over Dave. That's why we
won — the linebackers. 1 saw the linebackers
knocking down balls left and right."
The Cardinal also sacked Wilhelm and McLaugh
lin eight times. Tackle Tony Leiker and outside
linebacker Chris Weber had two apiece to lead
the defense. Leiker, however, was flagged for a
personal foul when he did a Mark Gastineau-like


Jeff Schneider and his fellow Oregon State defenders were left in

sack dance over Wilhelm's prostrate body. "I
guess I found out I can't celebrate that way,
Leiker said.
The coverage was responsible for several of
those sacks, as the Cardinal stuck mostly to a
three- or four-man rush. To quote the Oregon
State play-by-play sheet: "McLaughlin to pass, all
day to throw, finally sacked at 0-36, loses 11 yds.'
"Erik wasn't reading the defense, and that's
what you have to do in our offense,'' said Oregon
State Coach Dave Kragthorpe, whose team fell to
0-3 in the Pacific-10 Conference opener for both
earns. "It was like he was in a fog. He obviously
wasn't moving the team. What it really boils down
to is that he wasn't making good decisions."
Kragthorpe's defense, though, was playing a
good game, holding Stanford to 243 yards of total
offense. Stanford didn't convert on a third-down
play until four minutes remained in the game.
Junior tailback Brad Muster rushed for 82 yards,
but needed 26 carries to do it. And senior quar
terback John Paye passed for only 140 yards and
was intercepted twice.
Two injuries obviously played a major role.
First, wide receiver Jeff James didn't make the trip
because of a sprained heel suffered last week
against San Jose State. James caught 18 passes in
cluding three touchdowns in his first two game to
lead the nation in receptions, and he and Paye
seemed poised to become the best passing com
bination in the conference.
Second, left tackle Jeff Marchin left the game
early with a pinched nerve in his neck, forcing
right tackle John Zentner to move to the other
side of the line as Robbie Coffin took over
Zentner's spot. Beaver defensive tackle Paul Car
berry then proceeded to take advantage of the
loss and introduce himself to Paye and Muster.
Often. Carberry batted down four passes and
made 12 tackles on the day.
"We miss Jeff," Muster said. "We have confi
dence in the second team, it's just that we didn't
have a lot of practice time with them. There was
some missed communication with the tackles,
some breakdowns."
Kragthorpe said, "In my opinion we had one
guy who was playing good football and a bunch
of guys playing mediocre football. Carberry cer
tainly did an outstanding job."
The Stanford offense looked good to start the
game. On the first drive, Paye took the Cardinal
57 yards to the Oregon State 4 before trying to
throw a pass to freshman wide receiver Ed McCaf
frey through three Beaver defenders. One of
them, cornerback Teddy Johnson, made the inter
ception.
The Beavers didn't get far, as linebacker Barry
McKeever stripped wide receiver Dave Montagne
and Weber recovered at the Oregon State 19. The
Cardinal had to settle for a 28-yard field goal by
David Sweeney to go up 3-0.
Stanford mounted its best drive in the second
quarter as the rain turned from steady to torren
tial. The Cardinal went 55 yards in five plays, with
Muster scoring on a toss right behind a devastat
ing lead block from fullback Brian Morris for a
10-0 Stanford lead at halftime.
To start the second half, senior tailback Kevin
Scott took the kickoff 89 yards untouched for an
apparent touchdown, but the play was called back
on a clipping penalty. The Cardinal regrouped to
drive to the Beaver 18, but Sweeney missed a 35-
yard field to the left.
The defense then got the ball back for the Card
inal when McLaughlin dropped the rain-slickec
ball while scrambling away from Leiker at his
own 14. Tackle Lester Archambeau recovered for
the Cardinal, and four plays later, on fourth-and
four from the Oregon State 8, Paye found tighi
end Eric Snelson at the goal line for a 17-0 lead.
> The third quarter ended with the Beavers

deepest penetration through the first 45 minutes
— to the Stanford 36. The shutout remained in
tact, however, when reserve linebacker Darron
Bennett broke through and blocked Marty
Breen's 53-yard field goal attempt, recovering the
ball at the Oregon State 42.
Paye then threw his second interception of the
day, which Johnson returned to his 49. McLaugh
lin then led the Beavers to the Stanford 18, where
he found Chaffey in the end zone for the ques
tionable touchdown.
The Cardinal had one last chance to score, but
fullback Marshall Dillard fumbled at the Oregon
State 8 with 35 seconds remaining.
Despite the subpar offensive outing, Muster
was smiling about the Cardinal's first conference
win. "It's exciting," he said. "We know we don t
have to score 34 points to win. I'm not too con
cerned about the offense right now. We'll just put
in the practice time and get the whole group to

Cardinal had to settle for a 28-yard field goal by
David Sweeney to go up 3-0.
Stanford mounted its best drive in the second
quarter as the rain turned from steady to torren
tial. The Cardinal went 55 yards in five plays, with
Muster scoring on a toss right behind a devastat
ing lead block from fullback Brian Morris for a
10-0 Stanford lead at halftime.
To start the second half, senior tailback Kevin
Scott took the kickoff 89 yards untouched for an
apparent touchdown, but the play was called back
on a clipping penalty. The Cardinal regrouped to
drive to the Beaver 18, but Sweeney missed a 35-
yard field to the left.
The defense then got the ball back for the Card
inal when McLaughlin dropped the rain-slickec
ball while scrambling away from Leiker at his
own 14. Tackle Lester Archambeau recovered for
the Cardinal, and four plays later, on fourth-and
four from the Oregon State 8, Paye found tighi
end Eric Snelson at the goal line for a 17-0 lead.
> The third quarter ended with the Beavers

deepest penetration through the first 45 minutes
— to the Stanford 36. The shutout remained in
tact, however, when reserve linebacker Darron
Bennett broke through and blocked Marty
Breen's 53-yard field goal attempt, recovering the
ball at the Oregon State 42.
Paye then threw his second interception of the
day, which Johnson returned to his 49. McLaugh
lin then led the Beavers to the Stanford 18, where
he found Chaffey in the end zone for the ques
tionable touchdown.
The Cardinal had one last chance to score, but
fullback Marshall Dillard fumbled at the Oregon
State 8 with 35 seconds remaining.
Despite the subpar offensive outing, Muster
was smiling about the Cardinal's first conference
win. "It's exciting," he said. "We know we don t
have to score 34 points to win. I'm not too con
cerned about the offense right now. We'll just put
in the practice time and get the whole group to
gether."
Wyman was reflecting that new confidence.
"That's been a problem at Stanford — people
have been satisfied with just winning three or
four games," he said.
"Now we want to take it to people."

CORVALLIS, Ore. — For those just arriving on
campus, we note a couple of changes in this year's
edition of Stanford football: 1) This team is win
ning games; 2) the defense is leading the way.
You may remember Stanford football from years
past: many points scored, more given up, losing
seasons. Five in a row, to be exact. Saturday's 17-7
victory over Oregon State in front of 21,125
drenched and disappointed Beaver fans at Parker
Stadium may mean that that old scenario is merely
a memory.
First, the Cardinal is 3-0 for the first time since
1972. Second, the defense came within a question
able call of recording its first shutout since 1974 —
a stretch of 126 games — and shut down a Beaver
passing game that had rolled up 339 yards against
No. 5 Michigan the week before.
"We won two out of three," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "Our defense and special teams played
well. They had a good defense — we just didn't get
it together on offense. We've got to pull that thing
together and get something going.''
"We wanted the shutout. We were excited about

that," senior linebacker David Wyman said. "But
we still got a Pac-10 win."
The shutout was lost with 11 minutes remaining
in the game when Oregon State fullback Pat Chaf
fey leaped high in the end zone to pull down a pass
from backup quarterback Dave McLaughlin. Then
Stanford cornerback Toi Cook met Chaffey. Chaffey
hit the ground, Cook hit the ground, and the ball
hit the ground The official signaled touchdown.
"He fumbled around with the ball, and I thought
I did a good job of stripping him," Cook said. "I
saw the ball on the ground, and then they call it a
touchdown. It was a horrible call.
"We wanted the shutout. It was a tainted victory."
Perhaps not a shutout, but definitely a strong de
fensive performance. Oregon State starting quar
terback Erik Wilhelm had completed 39 of 64
passes for 339 yards against Michigan in the
Beavers' closer-than-the-score 31-12 loss in Ann Ar
bor. Against Stanft, d, Wilhelm was on the sidelines
by the second quarter.
Wilhelm finished 10 of 20 for 51 yards with one
interception. McLaughlin, pitching in relief, was 13
of 22 for 114 yards with two interceptions.
"I think maybe we're getting some respect," said
Cook, whose five interceptions in his first two

games made him the nation's leader. "Against Mi
chigan he (Wilhelm) was drilling the ball into
coverage. Against us he was trying to play it safe. I
think he wanted to go downfield, but he wouldn't
take a chance throwing the ball."
"We had their deep game covered pretty well all
day," said safety Walt Harris, who had two of the
Cardinal's three interceptions. "I don't think they
could have gone deep against us today."
With Brad Humphreys' third pickoff of the
season, the Stanford secondary has 10 intercep
tions so far this year. Humphreys, though, credited
the linebacker play in front of them — especially
the return of Wyman, who missed all of last season
with a knee injury suffered late in the 1984 season.
"That's how I got my pick," Humphreys said.
"He had to throw it high over Dave. That's why we
won — the linebackers. 1 saw the linebackers
knocking down balls left and right."
The Cardinal also sacked Wilhelm and McLaugh
lin eight times. Tackle Tony Leiker and outside
linebacker Chris Weber had two apiece to lead
the defense. Leiker, however, was flagged for a
personal foul when he did a Mark Gastineau-like


Jeff Schneider and his fellow Oregon State defenders were left in

sack dance over Wilhelm's prostrate body. "I
guess I found out I can't celebrate that way,
Leiker said.
The coverage was responsible for several of
those sacks, as the Cardinal stuck mostly to a
three- or four-man rush. To quote the Oregon
State play-by-play sheet: "McLaughlin to pass, all
day to throw, finally sacked at 0-36, loses 11 yds.'
"Erik wasn't reading the defense, and that's
what you have to do in our offense,'' said Oregon
State Coach Dave Kragthorpe, whose team fell to
0-3 in the Pacific-10 Conference opener for both
earns. "It was like he was in a fog. He obviously
wasn't moving the team. What it really boils down
to is that he wasn't making good decisions."
Kragthorpe's defense, though, was playing a
good game, holding Stanford to 243 yards of total
offense. Stanford didn't convert on a third-down
play until four minutes remained in the game.
Junior tailback Brad Muster rushed for 82 yards,
but needed 26 carries to do it. And senior quar
terback John Paye passed for only 140 yards and
was intercepted twice.
Two injuries obviously played a major role.
First, wide receiver Jeff James didn't make the trip
because of a sprained heel suffered last week
against San Jose State. James caught 18 passes in
cluding three touchdowns in his first two game to
lead the nation in receptions, and he and Paye
seemed poised to become the best passing com
bination in the conference.
Second, left tackle Jeff Marchin left the game
early with a pinched nerve in his neck, forcing
right tackle John Zentner to move to the other
side of the line as Robbie Coffin took over
Zentner's spot. Beaver defensive tackle Paul Car
berry then proceeded to take advantage of the
loss and introduce himself to Paye and Muster.
Often. Carberry batted down four passes and
made 12 tackles on the day.
"We miss Jeff," Muster said. "We have confi
dence in the second team, it's just that we didn't
have a lot of practice time with them. There was
some missed communication with the tackles,
some breakdowns."
Kragthorpe said, "In my opinion we had one
guy who was playing good football and a bunch
of guys playing mediocre football. Carberry cer
tainly did an outstanding job."
The Stanford offense looked good to start the
game. On the first drive, Paye took the Cardinal
57 yards to the Oregon State 4 before trying to
throw a pass to freshman wide receiver Ed McCaf
frey through three Beaver defenders. One of
them, cornerback Teddy Johnson, made the inter
ception.
The Beavers didn't get far, as linebacker Barry
McKeever stripped wide receiver Dave Montagne
and Weber recovered at the Oregon State 19. The
Cardinal had to settle for a 28-yard field goal by
David Sweeney to go up 3-0.
Stanford mounted its best drive in the second
quarter as the rain turned from steady to torren
tial. The Cardinal went 55 yards in five plays, with
Muster scoring on a toss right behind a devastat
ing lead block from fullback Brian Morris for a
10-0 Stanford lead at halftime.
