# Defense slaughters Beavers
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — For those just arriving on
campus, we note a couple of changes in this year's
edition of Stanford football: 1) This team is win
ning games; 2) the defense is leading the way.
You may remember Stanford football from years
past: many points scored, more given up, losing
seasons. Five in a row, to be exact. Saturday's 17-7
victory over Oregon State in front of 21,125
drenched and disappointed Beaver fans at Parker
Stadium may mean that that old scenario is merely
a memory.
First, the Cardinal is 3-0 for the first time since
1972. Second, the defense came within a question
able call of recording its first shutout since 1974 —
a stretch of 126 games — and shut down a Beaver
passing game that had rolled up 339 yards against
No. 5 Michigan the week before.
"We won two out of three," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "Our defense and special teams played
well. They had a good defense — we just didn't get
it together on offense. We've got to pull that thing
together and get something going.''
"We wanted the shutout. We were excited about

that," senior linebacker David Wyman said. "But
we still got a Pac-10 win."
The shutout was lost with 11 minutes remaining
in the game when Oregon State fullback Pat Chaf
fey leaped high in the end zone to pull down a pass
from backup quarterback Dave McLaughlin. Then
Stanford cornerback Toi Cook met Chaffey. Chaffey
hit the ground, Cook hit the ground, and the ball
hit the ground The official signaled touchdown.
"He fumbled around with the ball, and I thought
I did a good job of stripping him," Cook said. "I
saw the ball on the ground, and then they call it a
touchdown. It was a horrible call.
"We wanted the shutout. It was a tainted victory."
Perhaps not a shutout, but definitely a strong de
fensive performance. Oregon State starting quar
terback Erik Wilhelm had completed 39 of 64
passes for 339 yards against Michigan in the
Beavers' closer-than-the-score 31-12 loss in Ann Ar
bor. Against Stanft, d, Wilhelm was on the sidelines
by the second quarter.
Wilhelm finished 10 of 20 for 51 yards with one
interception. McLaughlin, pitching in relief, was 13
of 22 for 114 yards with two interceptions.
"I think maybe we're getting some respect," said
Cook, whose five interceptions in his first two

games made him the nation's leader. "Against Mi
chigan he (Wilhelm) was drilling the ball into
coverage. Against us he was trying to play it safe. I
think he wanted to go downfield, but he wouldn't
take a chance throwing the ball."
"We had their deep game covered pretty well all
day," said safety Walt Harris, who had two of the
Cardinal's three interceptions. "I don't think they
could have gone deep against us today."
With Brad Humphreys' third pickoff of the
season, the Stanford secondary has 10 intercep
tions so far this year. Humphreys, though, credited
the linebacker play in front of them — especially
the return of Wyman, who missed all of last season
with a knee injury suffered late in the 1984 season.
"That's how I got my pick," Humphreys said.
"He had to throw it high over Dave. That's why we
won — the linebackers. 1 saw the linebackers
knocking down balls left and right."
The Cardinal also sacked Wilhelm and McLaugh
lin eight times. Tackle Tony Leiker and outside
linebacker Chris Weber had two apiece to lead
the defense. Leiker, however, was flagged for a
personal foul when he did a Mark Gastineau-like
