# Secondary silences critics

### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — For the last few years
they've been the target of fans' frustrations
and sportswriters' witticisms. They've also
been the target of opponents' game plans and
opposing receivers' dreams. Rodney Danger
field got more respect than the Stanford sec
ondary of the recent past.
You remember the jokes: What's slower
than the Stanford secondary? Nothing. The
lines: "Stanford's pass defense was as effective
as a screen door in a submarine." The
nicknames: Swiss-cheese defense, big-play
defense (big-plays going the wrong way.)
And you remember the losses.
No more.
This year's team is 3-0 after Saturday's 17-7
victory here over Oregon State. And the sec
ondary is possibly the strongest point of the
defense that was responsible for that victory.
The contingent of cornerbacks Toi Cook
and Alan Grant, strong safety Brad
Humphreys and safety Walt Harris has inter
cepted 10 passes in three games. Saturday,
they allowed Oregon State half the passing
yardage the Beavers accumulated the week
before against No. 5 Michigan. The only
touchdown pass against them this season
looked incomplete to everyone but the offi
cial.
"We're kind of sick of hearing how we're

like the San Diego Chargers," Cook said, re
ferring to the all-offense, no-defense NFL
team.
Beaver quarterback Erik Wilhelm was
highly touted going into the Stanford game,
coming off a record-breaking performance at
Michigan. But the Cardinal defense stopped
Wilhelm and caused Oregon State Coach
Dave Kragthorpe to remove him in the
second quarter.
"We had the deep game covered pretty well
all day," Harris said. "1 don't think they could
have gone upfield against us today."
"I think he (Wilhelm) wanted to go
downfield, but he wouldn't take a chance
throwing the ball," Cook added.
Against the Beavers, the game plan was to
force Wilhelm to throw short, then stop the
receiver for minimal gain. It worked. Wil
helm's average gain was five yards per com
pletion, and backup Dave McLaughlin wasn't
much better at eight per completion.
"I was talking to Dave (Wyman) before the
game," Cook said. "We said the big thing
we've got to do is tackle. It's hard for them to
win if they try five here and 10 there."
"We weren't concerned with their offense,"
Harris said, "just our defense. Make them
throw short, rally up quick, and make them
pay for catching the ball.
"We were really pumped for this game, to
get a few interceptions. We like this kind of
game — it's a challenge."

Cook and Harris have been playing regu
larly for the last three years, while Humphreys
broke into the lineup last season, and Grant is
a redshirt freshman, taking the place of Sam
Sutherland, last year's freshman sensation
who transferred to Colorado after he was
caught stealing credit cards and checkbooks
with two teammates last winter.
Grant is not a weak link in the defense.
"He's a great athlete," Cook said. "He's going
to be great before he leaves. He's as good as
any of us. No one is going to try to pick on
him."
The experience of the other three has
helped as well. "I think everyone understands
the defense now," said Cook.
"There's a lot of pride and desire, and
we're playing relaxed," he added. "Coach
(Dick) Mannini calls it the Vanilla Defense be
cause it's so simple. We just go out and exe
cute."
Harris moved this year from cornerback to
safety to make room for Grant, and he is en
joying the switch. "It's great. Beautiful," he
said. "I get to wander around the zone and
read the quarterback. That's what happened
on my interceptions — the quarterback
rolled, and I read his eyes and followed them
to the ball."
The criticism of years past has also
played a small factor. "It's always a


Eric Snelson's eight-yard touchdown grab left Oregon
State cornerback David Brannon looking for help and was

the final score in a 17-7 Stanford victory. For Snelson it was
the first scoring catch of the season.

motivating factor," Harris said. "I don't

think anyone can criticize our speed —
we're the fastest in the conference. And
no one can criticize our ability."
And with that comes a desire to turn
the label "big-play defense" into a pos
itive tag. "With any good defense, you

want to create turnovers — make that
big hit or tip a pass so someone can in
tercept it,"he said.
"This defense is good," Cook said.
"We're going to score some points
ourselves."

An opportunistic Stanford secondary led by strong safety Brad Humphreys, who also garnered an inter
ception, forced four of five Oregon State turnovers while holding the Beavers to a mere seven points.
With the victory the Cardinal advanced to 3-0.

Michigan. But the Cardinal defense stopped
Wilhelm and caused Oregon State Coach
Dave Kragthorpe to remove him in the
second quarter.
"We had the deep game covered pretty well
all day," Harris said. "1 don't think they could
have gone upfield against us today."
"I think he (Wilhelm) wanted to go
downfield, but he wouldn't take a chance
throwing the ball," Cook added.
Against the Beavers, the game plan was to
force Wilhelm to throw short, then stop the
receiver for minimal gain. It worked. Wil
helm's average gain was five yards per com
pletion, and backup Dave McLaughlin wasn't
much better at eight per completion.
"I was talking to Dave (Wyman) before the
game," Cook said. "We said the big thing
we've got to do is tackle. It's hard for them to
win if they try five here and 10 there."
"We weren't concerned with their offense,"
Harris said, "just our defense. Make them
throw short, rally up quick, and make them
pay for catching the ball.
"We were really pumped for this game, to
get a few interceptions. We like this kind of
game — it's a challenge."

Cook and Harris have been playing regu
larly for the last three years, while Humphreys
broke into the lineup last season, and Grant is
a redshirt freshman, taking the place of Sam
Sutherland, last year's freshman sensation
who transferred to Colorado after he was
caught stealing credit cards and checkbooks
with two teammates last winter.
Grant is not a weak link in the defense.
"He's a great athlete," Cook said. "He's going
to be great before he leaves. He's as good as
any of us. No one is going to try to pick on
him."
The experience of the other three has
helped as well. "I think everyone understands
the defense now," said Cook.
"There's a lot of pride and desire, and
we're playing relaxed," he added. "Coach
(Dick) Mannini calls it the Vanilla Defense be
cause it's so simple. We just go out and exe
cute."
Harris moved this year from cornerback to
safety to make room for Grant, and he is en
joying the switch. "It's great. Beautiful," he
said. "I get to wander around the zone and
read the quarterback. That's what happened
on my interceptions — the quarterback
rolled, and I read his eyes and followed them
to the ball."
The criticism of years past has also
played a small factor. "It's always a

motivating factor," Harris said. "I don't

think anyone can criticize our speed —
we're the fastest in the conference. And
no one can criticize our ability."
And with that comes a desire to turn
the label "big-play defense" into a pos
itive tag. "With any good defense, you

want to create turnovers — make that
big hit or tip a pass so someone can in
tercept it,"he said.
"This defense is good," Cook said.
"We're going to score some points
ourselves."

An opportunistic Stanford secondary led by strong safety Brad Humphreys, who also garnered an inter

With the victory the Cardinal advanced to 3-0.
CORVALLIS, Ore. — For the last few years
they've been the target of fans' frustrations
and sportswriters' witticisms. They've also
been the target of opponents' game plans and
opposing receivers' dreams. Rodney Danger
field got more respect than the Stanford sec
ondary of the recent past.
You remember the jokes: What's slower
than the Stanford secondary? Nothing. The
lines: "Stanford's pass defense was as effective
as a screen door in a submarine." The
nicknames: Swiss-cheese defense, big-play
defense (big-plays going the wrong way.)
And you remember the losses.
No more.
This year's team is 3-0 after Saturday's 17-7
victory here over Oregon State. And the sec
ondary is possibly the strongest point of the
defense that was responsible for that victory.
The contingent of cornerbacks Toi Cook
and Alan Grant, strong safety Brad
Humphreys and safety Walt Harris has inter
cepted 10 passes in three games. Saturday,
they allowed Oregon State half the passing
yardage the Beavers accumulated the week
before against No. 5 Michigan. The only
touchdown pass against them this season
looked incomplete to everyone but the offi
cial.
"We're kind of sick of hearing how we're

like the San Diego Chargers," Cook said, re
ferring to the all-offense, no-defense NFL
team.
Beaver quarterback Erik Wilhelm was
highly touted going into the Stanford game,
coming off a record-breaking performance at
Michigan. But the Cardinal defense stopped
Wilhelm and caused Oregon State Coach
Dave Kragthorpe to remove him in the
second quarter.
