# Fencing beginners learn from Hurst

### KEN STEVENS Editorial Staff 
Though the fencing season does
not stan until the winter quarter,
Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst is
already biting his nails.
The next few days could be the
most important of the school year
for Hurst as he waits to see how
many students sign up for fencing
classes.
Unlike most NCAA sports at Stan
ford, the men's and women's fen
cing teams rely entirely on walk-on
athletes to build their respective
programs. Last year, the men's team
was the only NCAA team at Stanford
without scholarships, and this year
the women's team's only scholar
ship has been taken away.
In fact, the Athletic Department
was set to eliminate fencing, but the
proposal was met with protest, and
the program was salvaged. "We
were going to be eliminated and
the ground sown with salt," Hurst
said.
"We essentially appealed to two
groups â€” the alums since we've
had fencing for 78 years, and the
students (from whom 1400
signatures were received in peti
tions)," he added.
Normally, teams without scholar
ships to offer prospective student
athletes have trouble competing
and are often forced to drop to a
lower division. The Stanford men's
and women's programs, however,
have flourished, with the men's best
finish being eighth in the nation in
1983, and the women's top mark
being sixth place last year.
"We stay in the top 20," Hurst
said, noting that the teams fence
against top-notch competition. "The

competition is tlic Ivy League
schools. We're not competing
against USC."
The secret to the success of Stan
ford's fencing teams has been the
ability of Hurst and assistant coach
Sherry Posthumus to take students
new to fencing and build them into
national contenders.
"We teach people to fence after
they get here," Hurst said. "Fencing
is one of less-than-a-handful of var
sity sports that you can learn in col
lege and earn a letter in."
Out of 12 fencers on the varsity
men's team last year, only four had
fenced prior to attending Stanford.
"That's why it's so important to get
people to come out," Hurst said.
And that's why he will be watch
ing attentively to see how many stu
dents sign up for fencing as a physi
cal education class.
Students who enroll in fencing
can take the beginning, inter
mediate and advanced classes all in
one school year. Then, they are
ready to receive private lessons
from Hurst.
"The normal progression is we
take someone as a freshman, they
could be on the team the next year
and start the next,'' Hurst said.
Though his teams have been
talented in the past, Hurst is con
cerned that the well may dry up
soon if not enough students look to
fencing as an alternative.
Few freshmen enroll in fencing,
probably because it is not as well
known as other sports such as ten
nis and golf. Yet, it is precisely the
freshmen whom Hurst hopes to
reach.
"Rarely do we see a freshman un
less he's had some high school ex
perience," Hurst said.
