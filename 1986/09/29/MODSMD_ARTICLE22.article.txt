# Victories dig spikers out of hole
## After poor start, volleyball now 6-5 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
For the past two women's volleyball
seasons, the Cardinal, led by one of the
top all-time collegiate players, Kim
Oden, spent almost the entire fall as
the nation's No. 1 ranked squad. Each
campaign, however, ended in a disap
pointing loss to an underdog op
ponent — UCLA in 1984 and the Uni
versity of the Pacific in 1985 — in the
NCAA championship game.
This season, without Oden and with
its dominating Pacific West conference
having been split up into the tradi
tional Pacific 10 and the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association, the Cardinal is a
brand new team .n a brand new situa
tion.
While Oden was the only significant
player lost to graduation, she was so
significant that the team's strategy has
undergone a marked change. The
change has meant a great deal of ex
perimental lineups and an uncharac
teristic five early season losses to six
wins. The Cardinal, ranked No. 4 in the
preseason polls and No. 1 as its
schedule got underway, is now No. 7.
As the team has adjusted to its new
player combinations and the talents of
two dynamic freshmen — setter Lara
Asper and middle blocker Jenny Chaf
fee — it has also picked up its play, ac
cording to Head Coach Don Shaw. Last
Wednesday the Cardinal lost a five
game match to UOP, a match Shaw said
his squad "should have won, but did
not quite pull out."
Friday and Saturday nights, Stanford
hosted and easily defeated Washington
and Washington State, respectively, to
put its conference record at 3-1.
Of the Cardinal's poor start, Shaw
said, "We normally are a slow starting
team, but in the past few years we have
won the close ones that, this year, we
have lost."

In three of its five losses, the
matches went the full five games. As
well, perennial Stanford standouts,
Nancy Reno and two-time All-America
Wendi Rush, both missed a couple of
games due to ankle injuries.
At this point in the season, Shaw is
looking for the players and combina
tions of players he can count on when
things start to get serious down the
road. He is not worried about the
season's humble beginnings and said
he didn't think that the team's morale
is low.
Shaw believes the relative
mediocrity of the Cardinal so far could
work to its advantage as the NCAA
tournament draws closer. "Other
schools aren't gunning for us as they
did in the past," he said. "There isn't
the pressure to stay on top. Opponents
know they're going against a strong
program when they play us, but the
program is entering a new phase."
Thus far this season, the schools
heading the rankings have been UCLA,
UOP, San Diego State, San Jose State,
and Hawaii. The introduction of new
conferences has resulted in a phenom
enon Stanford and UCLA, among a
couple other top volleyball programs,
have never experienced: They are not
in the nation's No. 1 league.
Shaw said that the PCAA, which in
cludes all the above teams except the
Bruins, has proven itself to be the
strongest conference in the nation this
season.
Despite the personnel and confer
ence changes which have affected all
the nation's best programs, Shaw feels
the same group of teams will be com
peting for the national title that has in
the past. He added that if Stanford
"comes on strong at the right time," it
could do what Cardinal volleyball has
not done for two seasons — win its last
game.
