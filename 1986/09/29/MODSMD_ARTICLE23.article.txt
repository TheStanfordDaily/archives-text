# Bosox rout Jays, clinch title

### 
BOSTON — Jubilant fans celebrated Sunday as the Bos
ton Red Sox clinched their first divisional title since 1975,
but extra security patrols kept the capacity crowd from
storming the field at Fenway Park.
Police and security guards lined the first- and third-base
walls and mounted police gathered under the center-field
bleachers before Boston completed their 12-3 drubbing of
the second-place Toronto Blue Jays for the American League
East championship.
City police and Red Sox management wanted to avoid a
repeat of the scene at Shea Stadium in New York where
Mets fans celebrating the team's clinching of the National
League East title tore up the field, doing an estimated
$250,000 in damage.
"Police did a phenomenal job in formulating this plan,"
Mayor Raymond Flynn said outside the ballpark.
"Unfortunately, it became necessary from the lessons we
learned from other cities— It's great to win games and
pennants, but it's more important to guarantee the safety of
the people who come to the games."

Red Sox players came out to take bows for the fans after a
clubhouse celebration, and pitching ace Roger Clemens
rode onto the field with a mounted police officer, waving to
the fans and signaling No. 1.
Thousands of pennant-waving, chanting fans poured into
the streets after the game, but no arrests were reported, said
police spokeswoman Jane Sheehan.
Boston police cut off traffic on streets around the ballpark
starting at 6 a.m. and brought in extra horse and canine
units. Police academy cadets stood in formation blocking
one street bordering the park, and mounted police were
stationed on other barricaded streets.
The streets around the park before the game were lined
with vendors and beaming fans, many of whom have waited
for this day since the Red Sox last won the pennant in 1975,
and suffered through many promising years that ended with
the team folding in August, September or October.
