# Bosox rout Jays, clinch title
## 
### 
BOSTON — Jubilant fans celebrated Sunday as the Bos
ton Red Sox clinched their first divisional title since 1975,
but extra security patrols kept the capacity crowd from
storming the field at Fenway Park.
Police and security guards lined the first- and third-base
walls and mounted police gathered under the center-field
bleachers before Boston completed their 12-3 drubbing of
the second-place Toronto Blue Jays for the American League
East championship.
City police and Red Sox management wanted to avoid a
repeat of the scene at Shea Stadium in New York where
Mets fans celebrating the team's clinching of the National
League East title tore up the field, doing an estimated
$250,000 in damage.
"Police did a phenomenal job in formulating this plan,"
Mayor Raymond Flynn said outside the ballpark.
"Unfortunately, it became necessary from the lessons we
learned from other cities— It's great to win games and
pennants, but it's more important to guarantee the safety of
the people who come to the games."

Red Sox players came out to take bows for the fans after a
clubhouse celebration, and pitching ace Roger Clemens
rode onto the field with a mounted police officer, waving to
the fans and signaling No. 1.
Thousands of pennant-waving, chanting fans poured into
the streets after the game, but no arrests were reported, said
police spokeswoman Jane Sheehan.
Boston police cut off traffic on streets around the ballpark
starting at 6 a.m. and brought in extra horse and canine
units. Police academy cadets stood in formation blocking
one street bordering the park, and mounted police were
stationed on other barricaded streets.
The streets around the park before the game were lined
with vendors and beaming fans, many of whom have waited
for this day since the Red Sox last won the pennant in 1975,
and suffered through many promising years that ended with
the team folding in August, September or October.
Mark Baker of Newton, who with a partner was hawking
Red Sox 1986 divisional championship
T-shirts, said they wanted to get rid of
their bundle quickly "so we can party
with everyone else."
In the other noteworthy event of the
day, Wade Boggs became the first Bos
ton player to get 200 hits in four con

secutive seasons Sunday in the victory
over the Blue Jays.
With a 93-61 record and their first di
vision title since 1975, the Red Sox will
meet the California Angels for the AL
pennant in a best-of-seven series
opening here on Oct. 7.
The AL East was the last of the major
league's four divisions to be settled
and marked the earliest date since divi
sion play began in 1969 that all races
were over.

The Blue Jays, whose feint hopes of
overtaking Boston were crushed in a 2-
0 loss to southpaw Bruce Hurst on Sat
urday, gambled on right-hander Duane
Ward, acquired from the Atlanta Braves
in July.
Ward lasted less than two innings in
his first major league start. He allowed
only two hits, but walked three, threw
a wild pitch and hit a batter before
giving way to Joe Johnson with none
out in the second.
