SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Fran
cisco 49ers' superstar Joe Montana,
recuperating from a back operation,
says there's a possibility he might
return to the game this year but that
he has to be absolutely certain it
wouldn't cripple him.
"1 would like to come back this
year if 1 can get back to 100 percent,''
the National Football League quar
terback told KCBS radio in a taped
interview aired Sunday.
"This type of injury could be per
manently damaging if I didn't, and I

don't want to take that chance," he
said, sounding a little depressed.
Montana said he was feeling pretty
good at the moment, especially after
getting out of the hospital where he
was operated on for a herniated disc.
Asked how he felt about the tons
of get-well wishes he had received
from fans, Montana said, "It's just
overwhelming... to see that the fans
are still there and still really care. It
made me feel really good.
"I want to thank the fans for the
cards, all the phone calls, flowers,

the pizzas (at the hospital). I could
go on and on. I really appreciate all
their support. 1 just want to tell them
I'll be back as soon as I can."
Montana said his doctors are opti
mistic for his recovery, and that if it
takes until next season, that's the way
it has to be.
"If it does take until next year it'll
be a tough season for me, watching,
but unfortunately that might be what
I have to do. I'm shooting to come
back as fast as I can, with as little risk
as possible.
