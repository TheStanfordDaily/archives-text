Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins
continued to struggle Sunday in a day
of NFL action that also featured an up
set of the Los Angeles Rams and a near
upset of the New York Giants.
Marino threw a career-high four in
terceptions as the Dolphins lost 31-16
to San Francisco. The defeat was the
third in four games for the Dolphins,
their worst start since the 0-3-1 begin
ning in 1969, the year before Don
Shula took over as coach.
"We've never been in this position
before where you walk off the field
embarrassed, upset and disappointed.
That's where we are," Shula said. "I'm
bitterly disappointed in my football
team, including myself."
The Rams, meanwhile, lost to the
lightly regarded Philadelphia Eagles
34-20 in Buddy Ryan's first victory as a
head coach, and the Giants had to rally
to stave off an upset by the New Or
leans Saints, 20-17.
While the San Francisco defense was
frustrating Marino, Jeff Kemp hit Jerry
Rice with two touchdown passes.
The 49ers accomplished their vic
tory over Miami in much the same way
the 49ers beat the Dolphins the last
time the two teams met, San Fran
cisco's 38-16 win in the Super Bowl 19
months ago. While Marino completed
27 of 46 for 301 yards, he was con
stantly hurried and never got his
rhythm.
Kemp, subbing for the injured Joe
Montana, completed 14 of 29 for 168
yards but made the game's big play —
a 50-yard connection to Jerry Rice with
15 seconds left in the half. It came just
three plays after the Dolphins, sluggish

for most of the half, had cut the lead to
10-9 and gave the 49ers a 17-9 advan
tage at halftime.
Eagles 34, Rams 20
Quarterback Ron Jaworski's three
touchdown passes and a defense that
stopped NFL rushing leader Eric Dick
erson carried Philadelphia over the
previously unbeaten Rams.
Jaworski, who left the game with
8:34 left in the third quarter with a
slight concussion, completed 17 of 27
passes for 213 yards as the Eagles
silenced the Veterans Stadium boo
birds, who after three losses were
shouting for Ryan's scalp.
The ferocity of the Eagles' offense
was only slightly more suprising than
the collapse of the Rams' defense, third
in the league before Sunday. Los An
geles lost its first after three victories.
The Eagles, last in rushing defense,
stonewalled Dickerson in the first half,
allowing him just 19 yards on eight
carries. He wound up with 58 yards on
17 rushes.
Giants 20, Saints 17
Phil Simms threw a 4-yard touch
down pass to tight end Zeke Mowatt
with 8:03 to play as the New York
Giants rallied from a 17-point first-half
deficit to beat upset-minded New Or
leans.
The touchdown pass was the second
of the day for Simms and capped a
seven-play, 72-yard drive that the
Giants quarterback ignited with an 18-
yard scramble. The pass gave the

Giants their third straight victory,
raising their record to 3-1.
Redskins 19. Seahawks 14
George Rogers rushed for 115 yards
and two touchdowns to lead unde
feated Washington to victory over pre
viously unbeaten Seattle.
Rogers' second score, from 7 yards
out, gave Washington a 16-7 lead late in
the third quarter. The run capped a 74-
yard drive and gave the Redskins some
breathing room after they had used a
team-record 57-yard field goal by Steve
Cox to take a 9-7 halftime lead.
Seattle's Steve Largent caught three
passes to equal Harold Carmichael's
NFL record of catching a pass in 127
consecutive games.
Broncos 27, Patriots 20
Sammy Winder and Gerald Willhite
scored second-half touchdowns and
the Denver defense smothered New
England in that half, rallying the un
beaten Broncos past the Patriots.
Trailing 13-3 at halftime, the
Broncos scored on four of their five
possessions in the second half.
John Elway — who endured a dread
ful first half, hitting on only six of 18
passes for 48 yards with one intercep
tion — returned to form on Denver's
opening possession of the second half.
He completed passes of 17 yards to
Steve Watson and 32 yards to rookie
Mark Jackson, then found tight end
Clarence Kay for the 1-yard scoring
toss.
