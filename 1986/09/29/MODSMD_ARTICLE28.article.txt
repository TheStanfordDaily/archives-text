# Sign-up changes bring criticisms

### 
This year's revisions in the class
list signing schedule, which gave
students the opportunity to reserve
courses yesterday and Saturday, was
designed to enable freshmen to
complete class sign ups over the
weekend, freeing them to take ad
vantage of activities planned for
today and tomorrow, according to
Registrar Sally Mahoney.
Some returning students, who
didn't arrive on campus in time to
take advantage of the class list sign
up open to all students on Saturday,
have complained that the system is
unfair.
Critics claim that the new system
gives an advantage to students who
arrived early and it may now be
impossible for a student to reserve
a course that would have been
open in the old system.
Answering student concerns,
Mahoney said returning students
had a chance to sign up for courses
at the end of Spring Quarter last
year.
Classes requiring class lists are

offered primarily to freshmen, and
it is unlikely that many returning
students will be inconvienced by
the change, she added.
The decision to include yesterday
and Saturday in the class list signing
schedule was approved by the
Committee for Undergraduate
Studies subcommittee on Residen
tial Education and Advising, accord
ing to Mahoney.
The subcommittee thought that
students taking advantage of the
new system would mostly be fresh
men or orientation volunteers, who
arrive on campus early, Mahoney
said.
Though many orientation volun
teers took advantage of the new sys
tem, it was not designed to reward
them, Mahoney said.
Times for alphabetical groupings
in the class list signing schedule for
today and tomorrow are listed in
the Autumn Quarter Time
Schedule.
