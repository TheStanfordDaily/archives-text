To most freshmen and transfers,
Stanford Orientation must seem some
what surreal: arriving in an unfamiliar
place only to have one's every social,
academic and material need taken cart*
of by a host of startlingly friendly
strangers with red t-shirts and baffling
acronymic titles.
But the work that goes into organiz
ing orientation is anything but surreal.
The task of transforming the rather vast
and vague concept of orientation (i.e.,
welcoming new students to Stanford)
into the reality of a tightly- coordinated
schedule of events is an arduous one,
involving months of planning, paper
pushing and simple elbow grease. It's a
remarkable operation, one that Dean
of Residential Education Alice Supton
compares to "running a company.
What makes Stanford Orientation
even more remarkable is the fact that,
aside from some supervision and
trouble-shooting by Supton and orien
tation advisor Joe Pisano, it is com
pletely student-run.
Since April, a staff of 12 student co
ordinators led by junior Alison G>r
mack has been working feverishly to
organize the huge array of orientaion

activities. Since last Thursday, the co
ordinators have watched as 192 orien
tation volunteers, guided by an ex
haustive 48-page work schedule, have
executed their carefully-laid plans.
With two days of orientation still
ahead, Cormack smiled when asked
how the week has gone so far.
"Things are going so smoothly, I
can't believe it. We haven't had a major
problem yet," she said. "I couldn't be
more pleased with how it's going."
There is obviously ample potential
for snafus in a schedule boasting more
than 50 separate events, but Cormack
isn't particularly surprised at how well
things have gone.
"I was always sure that orientation
would happen and go well; I was just
never sure that we (the coordinators)
had thought of everything," said G>r
mack.' The coordinators have worked
so well and so hard that it had to work
out."
The coordinators' hard work began
in the spring with the unenviable task
of selecting the 192 volunteers from
more than 500 applicants
"That was hell," said junior Julie
Switzer, coordinator of Parent's Day,
part of the first day of orientation.

In keeping with their "Top Gun" orientation theme, Okada Theme Assistant Steve Dial and Resident
Assistant Tish Peterson guide freshman Wilie Lin in for a safe landing as part of their activities welcom
ing the Class of 1990 on Thursday. Friday, the theme continued as the Okada staff sent its frosh on a
reconnaissance flight throughout campus in search of clues which would lead them to their welcoming
party that evening.
