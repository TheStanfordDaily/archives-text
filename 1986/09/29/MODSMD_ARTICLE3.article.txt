To most freshmen and transfers,
Stanford Orientation must seem some
what surreal: arriving in an unfamiliar
place only to have one's every social,
academic and material need taken cart*
of by a host of startlingly friendly
strangers with red t-shirts and baffling
acronymic titles.
But the work that goes into organiz
ing orientation is anything but surreal.
The task of transforming the rather vast
and vague concept of orientation (i.e.,
welcoming new students to Stanford)
into the reality of a tightly- coordinated
schedule of events is an arduous one,
involving months of planning, paper
pushing and simple elbow grease. It's a
remarkable operation, one that Dean
of Residential Education Alice Supton
compares to "running a company.
What makes Stanford Orientation
even more remarkable is the fact that,
aside from some supervision and
trouble-shooting by Supton and orien
tation advisor Joe Pisano, it is com
pletely student-run.
Since April, a staff of 12 student co
ordinators led by junior Alison G>r
mack has been working feverishly to
organize the huge array of orientaion

activities. Since last Thursday, the co
ordinators have watched as 192 orien
tation volunteers, guided by an ex
haustive 48-page work schedule, have
executed their carefully-laid plans.
With two days of orientation still
ahead, Cormack smiled when asked
how the week has gone so far.
"Things are going so smoothly, I
can't believe it. We haven't had a major
problem yet," she said. "I couldn't be
more pleased with how it's going."
There is obviously ample potential
for snafus in a schedule boasting more
than 50 separate events, but Cormack
isn't particularly surprised at how well
things have gone.
"I was always sure that orientation
would happen and go well; I was just
never sure that we (the coordinators)
had thought of everything," said G>r
mack.' The coordinators have worked
so well and so hard that it had to work
out."
The coordinators' hard work began
in the spring with the unenviable task
of selecting the 192 volunteers from
more than 500 applicants
"That was hell," said junior Julie
Switzer, coordinator of Parent's Day,
part of the first day of orientation.

In keeping with their "Top Gun" orientation theme, Okada Theme Assistant Steve Dial and Resident
Assistant Tish Peterson guide freshman Wilie Lin in for a safe landing as part of their activities welcom
ing the Class of 1990 on Thursday. Friday, the theme continued as the Okada staff sent its frosh on a
reconnaissance flight throughout campus in search of clues which would lead them to their welcoming
party that evening.
During the summer, all the coordin
ators remained on campus, meeting
weekly while attending to the individ
ual responsibilities attached to their as
signed portion of orientation.
The first half of the summer, accord
ing to Cormack, was primarily spent
doing "conceptual planning," resolv
ing questions of programming and
scheduling, while the latter half of the
summer was spent in taking care of
"more down-to-earth, nitty-gritty
details."
Throughout, the coordinators were
responsible for all aspects of the plan
ning, ranging from ordering bags of
popcorn to working out a script and
order for the "History of Stanford"
slide show and getting Frisbees for
Field Day.
For Cormack, this boiled down to a

nine-to-five job all summer. Much of
her time, and that of her fellow coord
inators, was spent in filling out work
orders and labor requests and making
phone calls to various University de
partments such as Events and Services.
This year's orientation is bigger than
ever before, according to Cormack,
with 40 percent more events than last
year's program. There is a new Com
edy Club and a Festival of Drama,
Music and Art, and most of the new
events came in the areas of either aca
demic information sessions or ethnic
welcoming functions.
The increased number of academic
programs during orientation sprung
up primarily in response to a
University-wide perception that in the
past, orientation was slanted dis
proportionately toward the social
aspects of Stanford life and didn't give

students enough exposure to aca
demic/intellectual opportunities at
Stanford, according to Cormack.
The new academic events include a
set of three faculty debates (the
brainchild of Philosophy Prof. John
Perry), a session on how to read a great
work of Western culture (9:00 a.m.
today in Memorial Auditorium for up
perclassmen who are still wondering
how this is done) and a discussion of
issues of Western culture (tomorrow at
7 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.)
The idea is to enliven the minds of
students and stimulate them intellectu
ally, while also allowing an opportu
nity to make acquaintances and have
fun, according to Pisano.
The breadth of ethnic welcoming
events was enhanced this year with the
addition to the Parents' Day calendar of
individual parents' luncheons for each

of the five major ethnic groups
represented at Stanford (Asian-
American black, Chicano/Latino, native
American and international). Tradi
tionally, there has been a single huge
luncheon for all parents in Frost Am
phitheatre on the first day of orienta
tion.
The object of Parents' Day, accord
ing to coordinator Switzer, is to "let
the parents know what their child will
be going through while they're here
... that their child is leaving but he or
she is coming to a wonderful place."
The addition of ethnic luncheons was
thought to be consistent with that goal.
The ethnic luncheons were well
received, according to Sally Terry, a
senior who, along with junior Mark
Garner, is coordinating the Black
Recruitment and Orientation Commit
tee (BROC).

"The parents were really impressed
with the reception," Terry said. "It
made them feel better about where
their son or daughter was going to be."
Terry Yen, a junior who is co
coordinator of the Asian-American
New Student Orientation Committee
(AANSOC) says that his committee's
Orientation events have a two-fold pur
pose.
"First, they are to help Asian-
American students feel comfortable at
Stanford by introducing them to the
Asian-American community at Stanford
... and second, to introduce non-

Asians to the Asian-American commu
nity here."
Another new addition to the orienta
tion calendar is the set of trips occur
ring today and tomorrow. More than
1,000 freshman will he going on the 14
faculty-led trips to various spots in the
Bay Area, according to junior Paige
Mazzoni, coordinator of the trips.
She said the trips, made possible by
the elimination of the old Monday-
Tuesday schedule of registration in
Maples Pavilion, serve a dual purpose:
"showing the freshman what the Bay
Area has to offer and showing them
that the professors are human and ap
proachable."
Certainly, the coordinators' work
has been, in Supton's words,
"stupendous," but all of the coordina
tors hasten to point out that their care
ful planning would be for naught with
out the work of the red-shirted orienta
tion volunteers.
"The orientation volunteers are
key," said Cormack. "This year's OV's
have been the most enthusiastic group
we've ever seen."
The enormous success of this year's
orientation can be traced directly to
the spirit the coordinators and volun
teers brought to their work.
Cormack expressed that spirit by
saying "You just have to care, be con
cerned about the freshmen and about
how their first days here are."
Supton echoed those words: "We
want people to feel when they come in
that here is a community eager to
receive them.... We really want
people to have a warm welcome.'
"The key to all of it is knowing that
we did it, that students did it," said Cor
mack. "The fact that students can do
that is a great testament to this Univer
sity."
