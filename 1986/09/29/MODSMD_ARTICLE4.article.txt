# Land report to be revised
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER 
The University will make revisions
in a report outlining the effects of
changes in Stanford's revised land use
plan after the Palo Alto City Council
charged last week that the report is
vague and urged that it be changed, ac
cording to University Planning Direc
tor Phil Williams.
The report, called a Draft Environ
mental Imapact Report (DEIR), must
be submitted for review by Santa Clara
County before the University can
update a 1962 plan that specifies the
future uses of Stanford lands.
The Palo Alto City Council's objec
tions with the DEIR "had to do with the
clarity of the document, their (council
members) understanding of the issue,
and the traffic chapter," said University
Planner Charlotte Strem.
"We will need to substantially revise
the existing drafting," she said.
The University will prepare answers
to the questions about the DEIR raised
by the city council and other con
cerned Palo Alto citizens.
"We are going to wait until we get all
of the public documents," Strem said.
The city council's recommendation
came two days before the end of a
public review of DEIR. All questions
concerning rhe report that are raised
during fhe 45-day review period
(extended 30 additional days by Paid
Alto) will be added to the DEIR along
with the University's written responses.
The final draft will then be sent to
Santa Clara County for final approval.
Santa Clara County commissioned an
environmental impact report two years
ago when Stanford applied for a modi
fication of its 1962 county land use per
mit. The DEIR, a draft version of the
final Environmental Impact Report
(EIR) originally to be submitted to the
county this fall, evaluates potential ef
fects of the proposed land use modifi
cations on such factors as campus pop
ulation growth, traffic, pollution and
wildlife.
Stanford began the DEIR in 1980
when revisions made in the 1962 land
use plan required a new land use per
mit. The changes deal with 12 parcels
of University land and involve modifi
cations in their designated use. For ex
ample, some land set aside for housing
under the 1962 plan is now designated
for academic use, and some areas
meant for low density instruction and
research have been changed to high
density.
The DEIR, compiled by the Berkely
consulting firm of Ira Fink and As
sociates Inc., was released in early Au
gust.
According to the DEIR, the Univer

sitv's 1982-83 daytime population of
27,810 is estimated to grow to 30,520
by the year 2000, an increase of 2,170
in faculty, staff, students, other
employees, visitors, volunteers and
patients. Growth between 1982-83 and
1990 will be at a rate of 0.8 percent a
year, while growth from 1990 until
the end of the century will be at a 0.3
percent rate, according to the DEIR
predictions.
Much of the criticism of the DEIR
focused on traffic estimates and its
treatment of toxic waste disposal.
Williams agreed that the report was
incomplete in addressing the issue of
waste disposal. "We need to do more
homework about solid waste disposal"
he said.
Another weakness of the report,
cited by the city council, involved its
addressal of water run-off. "The report
failed to mention who was going to pay
for the cost of the run-off," said coun
cilman Larry Klein.
The city council also questioned the
accuracy of some of the University's
population estimates in the report.
The University estimate that a pro
posed 3 5 million square feet in floor
area would bring 2170 new faculty and
staff to the campus is too low accord
ing to several councilmen.
in an August ;nwtiug held befo>xi
Santa County County Planning Com
mission, Palo Alto City Planner Ken
Screibner, representing the city, said
although the DEIR predicts only
"relatively modest growth over the
next 15 years, if you total all the square
footage projected to be built under the
projected use permit modification, you
have about 3.5 million square feet." He
added that the growth is a "potentially
very, very significant increase."
But Williams explained that in the
case of University development the
number can be deceiving. "In a Uni
versity there is not a direct correlation
between floor area and population,"
he said. "Floor area includes parking
structures, pools and simply improving
facilities, which don't neccessarily in
crease population. This is where it dif
fers from urban development.
"We needed to grow. Areas such as
the Medical Center had changed since
1962," Williams said.
Ira Fink, of the firm that compiled
the DEIR, said in the August meeting
that he expected the proposed land
use modifications would have little ef
fect on campus population levels. "The
changes in population (projected in
the DEIR) would probably occur with
or without the proposed changes (in
the land use permit)," he said.
