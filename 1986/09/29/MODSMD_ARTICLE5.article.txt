# Gifts to Stanford are tops
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
The University received $179 mil
lion in gifts and grants from private
donors in the fiscal year ending August
31, making it first among U.S. private
institutions in gift support.
Following Stanford in private contri
butions were Harvard, Cornell, Colum
bia and Yale.
Donations from private individuals
totalled $72.4 million, bequests ac
counted for $36 million, corporation
donated $36 million and foundations
offered $31 million in grants.
Last year, the University garnered
$125 million in gift and grant support,
leaving it only second to Harvard in re
ceiving private contributions.
"There was a general overall in
crease in contributions," said David
Fulton, director of communications for
development
While the total gifts and grants
reached record heights, the annual
fund dropped in contributions to $131
million from last year's record year,
said Anne Bilodeau, director of the An
nual Fund.
Bilodeau attributed the decline to
two events in the previous year: the
Cardinal Club had a one-time auction
which netted $825,000 and the Univer

sity was in the last year of a three-year
challenge — a concerted effort over
the period to increase fundraising rev
enues.
According to Fulton, two extraordi
nary contributions were included in
this year s totals. Ihe late Liliore Green
Rains, a Southern California woman
who had no direct affiliation with Stan
ford, left the University $18 million
from her estate There also were $22
million dollars in advanced gifts to the
Centennial campaign which is slated to

begin in early 19H7.
The University does not have that
much discretion in where the donated
funds go. Most donors specifiy where
they want their money to go," Fulton
said. For example, donors have given
the University $12 million of computer
equipment in the past year.
Fulton partly attributed the Univer
sity's fundraising success to its geogra
phic location. The University attracts
donors because it "stands out as a top
private university and as the outstand

ing university west of the Mississippi,
Fulton said.
According to Bilodeau, the Univer
sity's strength as an academic and re
search institution serves as a drawing
card.
People donate to Stanford for two
primary reasons, said Bilodeau. They
appreciate what Stanford gave them
and would like to demonstrate their
gratitude," and they are "proud of Stan
ford's accomplishments as a research
and teaching institution.
