Chinese pledge reforms
PEKING — In a major new ideological statement, China's ruling Com
munist Party pledged yesterday to combat "the ugly and decadent aspects
of capitalism" while pressing forward with its efforts to reform the nation's
economic system.
The party's 210-member Central Committee, in its first meeting in a year,
adopted a resolution nearly 10,000 words long that urges party members to
make economic development the "key link" in their work. Under the late
Chairman Mao Tse-tung, Communist cadres had been told that the "key
link" was to continue carrying out the class struggle.
The new resolution also declared China's efforts at opening to the
outside world to "be a basic, unalterable state policy," noting that "closing
one's country to external contact results only in stagnation and backward
ness."
But the resolution made it clear that China's Marxist leadership does not'
intend to permit any sweeping political liberalization to accompany its
drive towards modernization.
"In essence, bourgeois democracy serves to protect the capitalist sys
tem, the resolution said. "Bourgeois liberalization, which means
negating the socialist system in favor of capitalism, is in total contradiction
to the people's interests and to the historical trend, and it is therefore
firmly opposed by the masses."
The new document represents the most concerted attempt yet by Deng
Xiaoping's regime to confront directly the ideological problems it has
faced in justifying its unorthodox, market-oriented economic reforms to
the party rank and file.
Nevertheless, the party stressed that China was still in what was called
"the initial stage of socialism." The resolution said the party did not expect
to eliminate private enterprise or differences in income in China for many
years.
Major dollar drop possible
WASHINGTON — Failure of the world's key finance ministers over the
weekend to agree to lower interest rates or stabilize foreign-exchange
rates could cause a sharp fall-off in the dollar when exchange markets open
today, officials of several governments warned yesterday.
One influential European finance minister said central banks there and
in Japan were prepared to intervene in an effort to stop a sharp decline in
the dollar.
"If there is turbulence in the markets pushing the German mark sharply
higher, the Bundesbank will have to intervene" to stabilize the mark's posi
tion within the European monetary system, an official of a European
central bank said.
So far as could be determined. U.S. officials have no plans to join in an
effort to stop a dollar slide.
In a major speech yesterday to the Interim Committee, the governing
body of the International Monetary Fund, Treasury Secretary James Baker
again warned that the U.S. trade deficit and the Japanese and West German
surpluses "may well increase again in 1988 and remain at politically and
economically unacceptable levels."
Either the dollar has to come down more, or economic growth in
Europe and Japan has to accelerate to reduce these imbalances, Baker said.
But he stopped short of saying that the United States would act on its own if
coordination of policy fails.
West Bank mayors chosen
JERUSALEM — Israeli officials, as part of their master plan to supplant
radical influence on the occupied West Bank by restoring a measure of
local rule to the area, yesterday appointed new Palestinian mayors in three
of the territory's major towns.
The appointments in the towns of Hebron, Ramallah and El Bireh return
elements of local rule to all of the municipalities that lost it four years ago
when Israel dissolved local authorities and fired town mayors because of
their support for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel has not per
mitted municipal elections in the West Bank since 1976.
The new mayors are all considered political moderates who, while
professing the requisite support for Palestinian nationalism, are closely
linked to King Hussein's Jordan.
The new appointments are the latest development in the Israeli plan to
help Jordan reassert its influence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
as a substitute for the PLO. Jordan's Hussein has been pushing to extend his
power in the area since he abruptly ended talks with PLO leader Yasser
Arafat last February after Arafat refused to publicly announce his accep
tance of two United Nations resolutions that recognize Israel's right to ex
ist.
The head of Israel's civil administration in the territories, Brig. Gen.
Ephraim Sneh, said yesterday that the new appointments had been made at
the insistence of local residents and were "a gesture to the local popula
tion.".
Gulf war intensifies
MANAMA, Bahrain — As Iraq and Iran gear up for what many predict will
be a climactic battle on land, a sharp escalation of fighting is also taking
place in the sea lanes of the Persian Gulf, through which much of the
world's oil passes.
Both Iran and Iraq have stepped up their attacks on shipping in the gulf
in an effort to bring economic ruin to the other side, Iraq by destroying
Iran's oil export capability and Iran by threatening the Arab states in the
gulf region that provide most of Iraq's military budget.
One result, according to a Western diplomat here, has been a "major es
calation of tension" in the past month in the tiny gulf states. "Anxiety is
quickly turning into something approaching panic," he said.
According to diplomats and Arab analysts, the attempt at economic stran
gulation may force a showdown battle in the Iran-Iraq war, as both sides
grapple with collapsing economies that prevent them from sustaining a
long-term fight.
The war entered its seventh year last week, with Iran reportedly massing
650,000 troops, most of them poorly trained volunteers, along a 600-mile
front in what many analysts see as the prelude to a major attack. Iraq, which
is much better equipped, has reportedly put 300,000 troops in fixed defen
sive positions to repel the expected onslaught.
In Washington, Reagan administration officials said last week that they
were convinced a major offensive is imminent and that it may open what
one State Department analyst called "a new phase in the war."
Winery union asks boycott
SAN FRANCISCO — The bitter harvest-time winery walkout escalated
yesterday as striking workers officially pleaded for a statewide boycott of
the biggest-selling wines in California, and employers prepared strategy
that could include mass firings and replacement.
"The boycott starts today," said Robert Fogg, Local 186 president of the
Winery, Distillery and Allied Workers Union. Fogg added that he hoped the
international union would make it a nationwide boycott.
On Wednesday, Locals 186 and 45, headquartered in Modesto and
Fresno respectively, decisively rejected the 12-member Winery Employers
Association's new contract offer. About 2,200 people are on strike.
We are asking the public not to buy products manufactured by the
members of the association," said Fogg.
Eleven wineries and allied operations of the 12-member association,
from Napa Valley to Bakersfield 350 miles south, have been struck. Fogg
said 98 union members have been crossing picket lines.
"We recommend that the public buy from other companies with whom
we have contracts," he said. "Permanent replacement is the companies' last
straw, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's what happens That's all they
can do to the strikers."
Although money is an issue, much of the dispute is over fringe benefits.
