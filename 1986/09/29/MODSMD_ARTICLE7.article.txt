## Summit obstacles unresolved 
### 
UNITED NATIONS â€” Secretary- of
State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met
again last night to try to settle the Nich
olas Daniloff case and eliminate other
impediments to a superpower summit
meeting this year.
The meeting, in the offices of the So
viet mission here, was the fourth that
the two officials have held since they
arrived at the United Nations last week.
Like the others, Sunday's session was
kept secret until it was well under way.
Shultz and Shevardnadze met a few
hours after White House chief of staff
Donald Regan hinted that Washington
might be ready to be flexible on a key
Soviet demand for smoothing relations
between the two countries.
Asked on the CBS-TV program "Face
the Nation" if the administration was
unyielding in its expulsion order
against 25 diplomats in the Soviet mis
sion at the United Nations, Regan said,
"I'm not sure about every single name.
I don't want to close every single
door."
Shultz had said last week that the ex
pulsion order would not be changed
even though Soviet officials have indi
cated that their price for resolving the
Daniloff case includes some modifica
tion of the order.

Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov said last week that
Moscow is as serious about the expul
sion order as Washington is about the
Daniloff case.
"In your eyes Daniloff is the obstacle
(to a summit)," Gerasimov said last

week. "In our eyes it is the expulsion."
U.S. officials have said that all 25 of
the diplomats are KGB intelligence of
ficers.
Under the order, the expelled
diplomats must leave the country by
Wednesday. Despite Soviet objections,
U.S. officials say they expect Moscow to
comply with the order because it is a
well-established principle of interna
tional relations that a host country has
a right to demand the removal of indi
vidual diplomats working on its terri
tory.
Nevertheless, Soviet anger at the or
der seems certain to complicate efforts
to settle the Daniloff case.
Shultz and Shevardnadze are
working against an informal Tuesday
deadline because the Soviet foreign
minister is scheduled to leave for an
official visit to Canada, breaking off his
face-to-face contacts with the Secretary
of State.
Although a Soviet official said "both
sides will be worse for it" if the
disputes are not settled before
Shevardnadze leaves the country,
Shultz insists that he will not rush the
talks.
"Obviously it is desirable to get the
matter settled as quickly as possible if
we can get it settled on the right basis,"

Shultz said. "Mr. Shevardnadze and I
have both worked at having a good
personal capacity of talking to one an
other so it is certainly useful to have it
done while he is here. But that may not
be possible."
Shultz and Shevardnadze met three
times, for a total of about four hours,
last week at the United Nations. They
had met earlier for 14 hours in Wash
ington on Sept. 19 and 20.
Shultz returned to Washington to
conduct other business Friday but
returned to New York at midday Sun
day.
An administration official said that
lower ranking diplomats continued to
work on the Daniloff case Friday and
Saturday but that additional Shultz-
Shevardnadze meetings would be
needed to wrap up any agreement.
However, the official said informa
tion about the negotiations is scarce
even inside the because
"George Shultz is being his own Soviet
desk officer on this one
Shultz has said repeatedly that it will
be impossible to hold a "fruitful" sum
mit until the Soviets withdraw
espionage charges against Daniloff, a
Moscow correspondent for U.S. News
& World Report.
