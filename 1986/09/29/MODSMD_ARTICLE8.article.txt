# Tax reform approved by Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Senate, capping an ex-,
traordinary drive for an overhauled federal income
tax system, gave final approval and sent to President
Reagan on Saturday a bill sharply cutting tax rates
and limiting or repealing many widely used deduc
tions.
The bill, which seemed in peril several times in
the past year because of opposition by powerful in
terest groups, was approved 74 to 23. Asked who
deserves credit for the legislative feat, Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) mut
tered, "God, I think."
Reagan, who made tax overhaul his No. 1 domestic
priority, called the Tax Reform Act of 1986 "fairer,
simpler for most people, one that encourages growth
and that is pro-family."
He said he will sign the bill "when it arrives on my
desk." The Senate still must approve an accompany
ing package of technical corrections and additions,
an action expected in the next few days.
The bill, approved two days after the House put its
final stamp on the measure, would cut the top tax
rate for individuals to 38.5 percent in 1987 for the tax
forms that must be filed by April 15, 1988. In subse
quent years, there would be two statutory rates of 15
percent and 28 percent and a third hidden rate of 33
percent.
Corporations would pay $120 billion more in taxes
by 1991, and the revenue gained would be used to
reduce individuals' taxes by 1.6 percent in 1987 and
6.1 percent in 1988. Six million low-income
Americans would be removed from the tax rolls by a

higher standard deduction and personal exemption.
The rate cuts also would be a boon for some wealthy
taxpayers, who could see cuts of more than $50,000
each in 1988.
"Taxes are about more than money. They are
about more than economics," Packwood said. "They
are about fairness, and this bill is fair."
Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), one of the first advocates
of lower rates and fewer breaks, said, "As an un
biased observer, I'd say this is the most significant tax
bill since 1954 and maybe since 1913," when the
income tax was created.
Even as they debated the 925-page bill, legislators
in both chambers were murmuring about restoring
some of the tax breaks it would wipe out.
"If I thought we would have to live with this tax bill
for the next 10 years with no changes, I would vote
against it," said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). "But we all
know, we talk about it in the corridors, that it will be
changed."
Packwood, however, said he and House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D
-111.) have agreed to fight "tooth and nail" against sig
nificant changes in the new system.
Eleven Republicans and 12 Democrats voted
against the tax plan, while 41 Republicans and 33
Democrats voted for the bill. Three senators did not
vote.
In return for lower rates, the bill requires
Americans to give up such widely used deductions as
those for sales taxes and mortgage interest. Both
breaks would be repealed, as would income averag

ing and the deduction for two-income families. Many
high-income taxpayers could no longer deduct con
tributions to Individual Retirement Accounts.
The interaction of low rates and fewer deductions
would fall differently on different taxpayers, even
those with the same incomes. The Joint Committee
on Taxation calculates that 76.3 million Americans
would see their taxes reduced, while 20.4 million
households, including 10.5 million with income
below $30,000 per year, would pay more.
The legislation is projected to leave unchanged the
total amount of tax revenue collected over the next
five years, although on a year-by-year basis revenue
would fluctuate by as much as $17 billion from what
it would have been. Most economists predict the tax
changes will slow the economy slightly in the short
run, but improve growth somewhat over the longer
term.
Supporters of tax overhaul sold it on the Senate
floor as a way to build confidence in government,
showing working people who feel wronged by the
tax system that Congress can make it work in their fa
vor.
But to the end, legislators disagreed over whether
the package they approved achieves that goal. Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) pointed out that
the legislation that is supposed to treat all taxpayers
equally includes $10.6 billion worth of special
"transition rules," exemptions for specific companies
and projects.
