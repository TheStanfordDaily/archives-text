# Kennedy praises diversity

### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Speaking Thursday night in packed Memorial
Auditorium, University President Donald Kennedy urged
members of the freshman class to take advantage of the
"opportunity represented by Stanford's diversity."
Kennedy, who was loudly cheered by the 1,575 members
of the Class of 1990, noted diversity at several levels of the
University.
Stanford is not only a world of ideas; it is a very hetero
geneous one, Kennedy said, adding that this diversity of
ideas and academic disciplines creates "a federation of spe
cial intellectual interests."
Kennedy also cited diversity among members of the stu
dent body and faculty.
Diversity is not something that just happens. We pursue
it with a variety of policies that are designed to make it pos
sible for students — and faculty and staff as well — from a
variety of economic, social and regional backgrounds to be
a part of this world of ideas," he said.
Diversity, however, creates several risks that students
must face, including the inability to "come to grips with dif
ference," Kennedy said.
"Merely to tolerate' differences is not enough, because
by tolerance we usually mean a willingness to let something
alone and not bother it,"he said.
Kennedy cautioned students not to squander the oppor-

tunities provided by such diversity.
"Students here sometimes feel and act like non
participants in the process. Perhaps it is because too many
students accept too readily the notion that they are ap
prentices, unready to take hill part in the life of the mind,"
he said.
"You don't have to have a degree to play," Kennedy said,
encouraging students to be active participants in intellectual
life at the University.
The opportunities presented to students are linked to cer
tain obligations that students should strive to fulfill, he said.
"The other side of opportunity is obligation — the obliga
tion to treat ideas seriously and to explore them energeti
cally, without alienation and with full respect for their com
plexity. And it is, eventually, to take the results of that
process and invest at least some of them in improving the
human condition," Kennedy said.
The president also encouraged students to participate in
areas of public service, a theme Kennedy has frequently
espoused.
"Hundreds of students avail themselves to those (public
service) opportunities each year. It helps to keep them cali
brated — to relate growing capacity and new knowledge
to a world that aches for just those qualities," he said.
Also addressing the freshman class were Jean Fetter, dean
of undergraduate admissions, Carolyn Lougee, dean of un
dergraduate studies, and COP member Kim Crawford.
