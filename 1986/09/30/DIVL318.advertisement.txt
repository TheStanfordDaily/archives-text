NEW COURSE OFFERING:
SOCIOCULTURAL IMPLICATIONS OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY
(ANTH 238 I VTSS 159)
I
The Anthropology Department announces a new course for students in the
professional schools, and in Hand S, who are concerned about what high
technology might end up doing to help or harm people, to distort a people's
culture or to make it more satisfying. This course is for students who want to
learn to think critically and creatively about these problems — using the
perspective, methods, and models of sociocultural anthropology, suitably
adapted.
The course is open to all graduate students, and all undergraduates
contemplating Honors Theses — regardless of major. While previous courses in
anthropology will be helpful, the course is so structured that the student new to
anthropology will be able to produce a paper that will make anthropological
sense, addressing a problem congenial to his or her interests and expertise in
science, technology, public or educational policy, journalism, economic analysis,
the humanistic analysis of values, etc. There will be units on: analytical tools of
sociocultural anthropology, the Microelectronic and Biotechnical Revolutions, and
culture and high technology in Japan.
The 5-unit course, taught by Prof. Robert B. Textor, will meet M-W-F at
1:15-2:45 in Room 269. Friday meetings will feature informal, off-the-record
conversations with scientists or technologists from Stanford or from Silicon Valley
or the biotech industry, or leaders from the local venture capital and political
arenas.
