# Senate overrides president's veto
## 
### 
WASHINGTON CAP) â€” The
House, dealing President Reagan a
major foreign policy reversal, voted
yesterday to override his veto of
punitive economic sanctions
against the white minority govern
ment of South Africa.
The 313-H3 vote rejected, in ef
fect, Reagan's last-minute offer to
invoke new but limited sanctions by
executive order against the South
African government of President P.
W. Botha.
The Democratic-controlled
House originally approved the
sanctions legislation 308-77, and it
had seemed virtually impossible
that the chamber would reverse
course and sustain Reagan's veto of
last week.
The Reagan defeat in the House
shifts the battle to the Senate, where
Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.)
has acknowledged that finding

enough votes to sustain the presi
dent's veto has proved "very diffi
cult."
In the moments before the vote,
House members debated once
more the wisdom of attacking the
South African system of racial apart
heid with tough sanctions.
Hep. Dante Fascell (D-Fla.), chair
man of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, told the House it was
imperative to override the Reagan
vet< because, "We need to express
very clearly once again our feeling
as the institution representing the
American people the feelings we
have about the institution of apart
heid."
But Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) said
the congressional sanctions would
bring "hunger, joblessness and
hardship" to South African blacks
and ultimately force, "a revolution,
not an evolution."
