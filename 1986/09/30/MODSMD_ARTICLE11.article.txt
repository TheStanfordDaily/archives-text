## A 						Word to the Wise 
### 
To the Class of 1990:
You've undoubtedly received more advice
during orientation than you could possibly
want.
Get your distribution requirements out of
the way. Leave enough time in your schedule
for rest and relaxation. Take Calculus. Set
goals. Question authority.
I could add some advice of my own to your
endless list of caveats. So I will.
It's a simple suggestion, seemingly silly, but
don't be fooled.
The advice is this: Take quotes, not notes.
Stanford s professors are riveting,
provocative and witty, and can really turn a
phrase. Yet at quarter's end, the average stu
dent's class notes invariably read like
"Pilgrim's Progress."
No one wants to prepare for exams by
studying soporific notes, and no one should
have to.
After two years of trudging through my own
dull notes, in which I had attempted to pick up
on major themes in lectures while ignoring
humorous asides, I got smart.
I devoted my entire junior year to record
ing, verbatim, the funny things professors said,
often missing much more important ideas.
When Dead Week arrived, and everyone
was whining about their work, I just grinned
as I opened my colorful notebooks.
"The Cuban Revolution," explained Political

Science Prof. Richard Fagen, "was sort of like
Big Game Week except that it went on for 10
years."
"(Historian Charles) Beard, lectured His
tory Prof. David Kennedy, "died in New
Haven, Connecticut, which is an appropriate
place to be dead in."
"(President) Reagan was a great Cub fan,"
ad-libbed Assoc. History Prof. Jack Rakove.
"That's where he got his start Unfortunately,
that's not where he stopped.
It was in Rakoves "lHth-Centurv America
that I began to take quotes at the expense of
notes. Rakove, a diehard Chicagoan perhaps
known best for telling his students "I don't
care if you read my book so long as you buy
it," gives a fast-paced lecture that all true
quote-takers must experience.
"Smith College is, among other things, the
place where Nancy Reagan did not get an edu
cation."
"This philosophy represents a sort of ma
ture republicanism in the lower case. No such
thing, of course, as a mature republicanism in
the upper case.
Rakove is at his best during his annual
colonial America slide show, in which he of
fers only sporadic comments as he flips from
one patriot to the next.
"Tom Paine. God is he uglv."
"James Madison. Receding hairline. I can
certainly sympathize with that problem."
