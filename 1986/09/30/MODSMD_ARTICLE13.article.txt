Orientation should be an opportunity for freshmen to
get their feet wet, not their heads soaked in booze. The
University should therefore be commended for continu
ing its policy of an alcohol-free orientation.
A freshman's first stay on the Farm is a heady enough
experience in itself without the added effects of alcohol.
With a full slate of activities, the newcomers have more
than enough opportunities to stay busy.
Stanford is first and foremost an institution of higher
learning, and freshmen can discover this through sum
mer reading discussions, faculty debates and speeches
scheduled for orientation. The impact of these activities
would be lost if experienced in an alcohol-induced haze.
It must also be remembered that while most freshmen
have consumed alcohol, they have not encountered it in
the large amounts that are so readily available on the col
lege level. What used to be a brew snuck out of Mom and
Dad's refrigerator is now a huge fraternity party where
beer flows like water. It's a big change for a newcomer.
Couple this with the pressure of being "cool" in front of
new friends and showing them how much alcohol one

can drink, and the potential is there for one drunk fresh
man.
So a freshman gets falling-down drunk, vomits all over
his dorm's bathroom and is hungover the next day; it's
not a very positive way to kick off four years at Stanford.
The orientation experience that was supposed to make
newcomers feel an important and welcome part of the
Stanford community will now be remembered with dis
taste.
This is not to say that freshmen should not be allowed
to drink, or that Residential Education should strive to
make Stanford a "dry" campus. Like it or not, alcohol is a
major pan of the college experience. However, for this
brief five-day period, there are more important and
worthwhile activities in which freshmen can take part.
Once freshmen have better adjusted to life at Stanford,
they can sample alcohol on their own initiative â€” with
out the pressures of orientation,
For many students, orientation is one of the most
memorable occasions at Stanford. Without alcohol, there
is a better chance that this memory will be a fond one.
