American media
doesn't tell about
life outside U.S.
When a Boeing 747 Pan American
plane landed at San Francisco Interna
tional Airport on June 22,1 began
wondering what sort of life the Ameri
can people lead. It was my first visit to
the United States; I was one of four
African journalists attending the 1986
summer program in mass communi
cations at one of America's most
prestigious universities — Stanford.
Outside the airport building, I
decided to take a taxi. After about
three-quarters of an hour, we arrived
at Stanford, and I carried my heavy
luggage to the International Center.
The following day I met my col
leagues, and on Tuesday classes began
in earnest.
We took classes in mass media and
society and TV production; both
courses were very stimulating. There
were about 15 students in both
classes, and each day we Africans were
exposed to new methods in commu
nications.
Outside classes, I studied the Amer
ican way of life very closely. My two
roommates, both Americans, were
very friendly and told me about the
American people. I visited Palo Alto,
and took the bus to San Francisco. I
also had the opportunity to mix so
cially with black students from Africa
— members of the Stanford African
Students Association.
However, one thing that dismayed
me was that the media in the United
States seems to be narrow-minded.
There was very little coverage, if
any at all, of the outside world on the
television news, the radio, or even the
newspapers. My African colleagues
and I were a bit surprised by this, for
we learned very little about Africa
through the media.
We were shocked about such things
as drug abuse and the Reagan Admin
istration's stance on apartheid.
I remember well one night listen
ing to a radio call-in show. "These
creatures calling for sanctions against
South Africa have not read their
Bible," one listener was saying. "God

was the first racist," he went on, to my
annoyance and dismay. "He separated
the Israelis from the 12 tribes, making
them a special people," he said. He
even quoted from the book of
Leviticus.
It was disgusting, to say the least. I
come from a country whose people
strongly abhor the evil system of
apartheid, and to hear someone sup
porting Uncle Sam's stance on apart
heid was very disturbing.
There were some other issues in
the news that drew my attention: the
appointment of William Rehnquist as
Chief Justice, the campaign against
drugs by the U.S. government and the
search for a new ambassador to South
Africa.
When the course finally ended and
I was on the plane home, I looked
back on my stay in the United States as
satisfying. I had been, though for a
short time, in the land of opportuni
ties, where there is a lot of everything.
I also learned that a lot of
Americans don't go along with some
of the policies of the present Washing
ton administration; but, then, their
dissent doesn't seem to carry much
weight with their former cowboy
President.
I am glad to have met some very
friendly Americans, listened to some
very good lectures at Stanford and
glad, too, to have been exposed to
modern technology. Sadly, though,
most people in the United States don't
appear to be aware of the world
outside their own. They are given very
little by the media, and the little they
are given is projected very negatively.

Reagan's policy
in South Africa
promotes racism
Since students left for summer,
Reagan's policy (or the lack of a
coherent one) in South Africa has
become clearer and more rancid. It is
condemnable that his strongest action
in the South African situation has been
to impose economic sanctions against
Zimbabwe.

Why? Because a member of the
Zimbabwean cabinet denounced
Reagan's refusal to implement similar
economic sanctions against the Botha
government, which is practically
enslaving and murdering black South
Africans. A representative of the U.S.
administration said Zimbabwe's ac
tions were beyond "... the accepted
norms of diplomatic civility and
practice."
I believe Zimbabwe's position is
considerably short of Reagan referring
to the Soviet Union as an "evil
empire." If diplomatic and formal
relations were to be curtailed or
terminated because of heated dis
course, there practically would be no
international relations at all among
most countries. Of course, I expect
Margaret Thatcher to denounce
prompdy Reagan's economic sanc
tions against Zimbabwe since she
steadfastly opposes all such actions. I
shall not leave unnoticed that another
foreign "ally" of this country was
recently found stealing from and
spying against this country. There
hasn't even been a whimper from
Reagan, or Sen. Jesse Helms and Jerry
Falwell — all super-patriots.
A word is in order about the diver
sionary observations made by many
about black South Africans attacking
other black South Africans, as if this
were something unique to them. Let
us not forget that most crimes, includ
ing murder, against black South
Africans are at the hands of the
Pretorian government. The last time I
heard, this government was controlled
by white South Africans. And, as I
recall, it was whites who killed whites
in the Civil War in this country.
Reagan's policies toward South
Africa are not just his alone. Silent and
supportive citizens and institutions in
this country as well become ac
complices to his actions abroad. Per
haps those accomplices can take some
comfort that only a few hundred lives
were lost over the summer. The issue
becomes how many more lives must
be lost because of inactivity, incom
petence, ignorance and perhaps even
racism.
