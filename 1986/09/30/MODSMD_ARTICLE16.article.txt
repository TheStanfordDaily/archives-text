# Make Palo Alto nuclear free
## 
### 
What does the word 'nuclear' bring to mind?
"Danger, death, sadness, corruption, explosion, cancer,
children, waste, bombs, pollution, terrible, terrible devalu
ing of human life."
This answer was made by a high school student in a 1980
questionnaire compiled by Prof. John Mack of Harvard
Medical School. Of the responses quoted by Dr. Mack in his
study of 1,000 children, I find this one the most moving. I
agree with that unknown student, now six years older, that
we are, in our endless pursuit of superiority in nuclear
weapons, establishing, whether we intend to or not, a
"terrible, terrible devaluing of human life." At the heart of
our nuclear enterprise are insanity, enormous peril and the
deliberate, suicidal abandonment of our responsibility for
one another. We are destroying our children, who no
longer believe a viable future exists for them; we are setting
in jeopardy the genetic integrity of the race.
I do not think many Palo Altans are aware of the political
vigor and public effectiveness of the Nuclear Free Zone
movement. Do many in our town realize that both New

York City and Chicago are now — the former by city council
resolution, the latter by city council ordinance — Nuclear
Free Zones? One hundred and thirteen other American
cities and councils, ranging from tiny West Tisbury in Massa
chusetts with a population of 250, to the largest county in
New Jersey, Union County, with a population of 564,094,
have campaigned to make their communities nuclear weap
ons free, starting in February 1981 with Hawaii County,
Hawaii. The process continues, as more and more American
citizens feel that the value of human life and the dignity and
worth of the human community must be reaffirmed.
The federal government, through the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), has issued a second civil
defense plan, after the disastrous failure of the first ("Crisis
Relocation Plans") in 1984. FEMA intends to build 3,400
blast shelters to house state and local officials, who would
stay in the shelters through the "trans-attack period," then
emerge to implement "post-attack government and society."
The rest of us, poor souls, would manage as best we could
sans shelters; the experience would develop initiative and
ingenuity, no doubt. The response to FEMA's plans has been
negative. Mary McGrory, in the Washington Post (May 15,
1986), comments as follows:
"Scientist George Rathjens reminds us that 'the radiation
released at Chernobyl is minute compared to the radiation
from just a few nuclear bombs.' James MacKernzie, senior
scientist of the Union of Concerned Scientists, says a single
nuclear weapon would kill 500,000 people and instantly
cause 600,000 severe injuries.
"FEMA pays lip-service to all these downbeat views. It
says, having been instructed by the whoops of laughter that
buried its earlier blueprint for salvation, that the 'U.S. would
probably not survive as a political and social entity after a
major nuclear exchange.'"
If FEMA officials are now, finally, compelled to imagine
such a scenario, then we must thank scientists like Rathjens,
MacKernzie, Linus Pauling and Hans Bethe and psychiatrists
and doctors, such as Mack and Herbert Abrams, who never
give up in the struggle to restore sanity to U.S. foreign and
military policy and to assist in the search for peace and dis
armament.
We can and should help. One of the strongest expres
sions of our abhorrence of nuclear weapons can find its
voice, which will be heard, when we declare the City of Palo
Alto nuclear weapons free.

The Palo Alto Nuclear Free Zone Coalition (PANFZ), lo
cated at the Mid-Peninsula Peace Center in downtown Palo
Alto, was formed less than a year ago to educate the people
of Palo Alto about the value and importance of such a
declaration. The PANFZ coalition has, with the help of
several lawyers, drawn up an ordinance to declare Palo Alto
a Nuclear Weapons Free Zone. This ordinance is closely
related to the Nuclear Freeze Resolution No. 6023, passed
by the City Council of Palo Alto on April 19, 1982, and
describes its link to the freeze on the first page:
"The continuation of nuclear weapons research and de
velopment in Palo Alto puts us in direct conflict with Resolu
tion No. 6023 by (a) making Palo Alto a more likely target in
the event of war; (b) making it more difficult for persons
who are concerned about the morality of working in nu
clear war industries to find non-nuclear-related work; and
(c) making the local economy dependent on nuclear con
tracts, to the detriment of the civilian economy.
"Peace is a local issue. Ending the nuclear arms race and
achieving a peaceful and stable world will require local as
well as national initiatives."
The first requirement under the ordinance, if passed,
would be as follows:
"No person shall knowingly engage in work, within the
City of Palo Alto, the purpose of which is the classified re
search, development, production, deployment, launching,
maintenance or storage of nuclear weapons or components
of nuclear weapons."
Basic research in education, medicine, agriculture or in
dustry would not be affected by the ordinance.

One of the strongest expres
sions of our abhorrence of
nuclear weapons can find its
voice ... when we declare
Palo Alto nuclear weapons
free.

Our ordinance would accomplish, in a number of years,
the shut-down of all nuclear weapons-related research and
production within the city limits. A Considerable number of
firms would be affected. Those firms would be compelled
by law to produce goods which could not, in any way,
become incorporated in nuclear weapons. Such a program
of conversion, carried out in Palo Alto, would give an en
couraging example to other cities in the Bay Area. Bay Area
residents must realize that the nuclear weapons corpora
tions, both large and small, which now flourish in our midst
make us a prime target. With the outbreak of nuclear war,
we would last about 10 minutes, according to one expert
(Lenny Siegel of Pacific Studies Center).
Now it is our turn to transform our town into a base of
peace and hope. Let us all join forces together to make Palo
Alto nuclear weapons free.
