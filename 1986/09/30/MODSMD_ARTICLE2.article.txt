# Mosher files suit against Stanford
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Editorial Staff With wire reports 
Steven Mosher, the former anthropology
doctoral student who was expelled in 19H3 be
cause of allegedly unethical activities during his
research in China, tiled a lawsuit against the
l niversitv yesterday, saying his professional
reputation had been seriously damaged.
I think what's happened to me sets a dan
gerous precedence, said Mosher, who spoke
at a news conference at the law offices of his at
torney, Marvin Belli.
The suit, filed in Superior Court, names Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and the An
thropology Department as co-defendants and
seeks Mosher's reinstatement in the anthropol
ogy doctoral program, a retraction of allega
tions by Kennedy and the department and un
specified damages.
According to reporters, Mosher charged the
I Diversity with slander, breach of contract and
violation of his civil rights. Other charges in
cluded interference with contractual obligation
and prospective economic advantage,
negligence, fraud and libel.
Neither Kennedy nor department officials
could be reached for comment.
According to Iris Brest, staff attorney in the

Legal Office, the University has not yet received
a copy of Mosher s complaint But she said
"We're satisfied that the Stanford process was
fair. Its conclusion has been sustained without
dissent by 19 people from a variety of academic
disciplines, both at Stanford and elsewhere,
who have thoroughly reviewed all the available
evidence.
Brest said she could not recall any precedent
for a student being readmitted into a program
from which he had been expelled through a
suit. She added that the courts are usually reluc
tant to intercede in the internal affairs of aca
demic institutions.
Mosher was terminated by a 11-0 vote of An
thropology Department faculty on Feb.
19H3, for "illegal and seriously unethical con
duct' while in China in 1979 and 1980. He
recently was named director of the Asian
Studies Center at the Claremont Institute, in
Montclair, Calif.
The charges against him are said to include
smuggling, bribing Chinese officials to obtain
government documents and venturing into ter
ritory closed to foreigners. Mosher has said
repeatedly that the University expelled him be
cause he wrote an article condemning Chinese
birth-control policies. The article, accompanied
by photographs of naked women awaiting
abortions in their eighth month of pregnancy,

was published in a Taiwanese magazine.
Following extensive internal reviews, Ken
nedy upheld Mosher's termination Sept. 30,
1985- Kennedy said Mosher's "lack of candor"
had "eroded the trust and confidence necessary
to graduate education." At the time, Mosher
said he would challange Stanford's decision in
court.
In a statement released at the news confer
ence, Mosher charged he was "sacrificed to
maintain Stanford University's research connec
tions with the Chinese regime."
Mosher has also repeatedly claimed he was
terminated because of "slanderous" allegations
by his former wife.
Some scholars had blamed Mosher for a
decision by the Chinese to sharply limit
fieldwork by American social scientists. Mosher
was one of the first American anthropologists
permitted to do extended field work on a rural
Chinese commune.
At the time of his decision regarding
Mosher's appeal, Kennedy cited more than a
dozen incidents in which Mosher withheld sig
nificant information, gave conflicting versions
or was purposely misleading. Most came to
light during an initial faculty investigation of
Mosher's conduct, but some were revealed
during the president's review of Mosher's ap
peal.
