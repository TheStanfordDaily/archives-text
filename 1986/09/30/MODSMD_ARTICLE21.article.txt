## Bug is back for inquiring minds 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Welcome back to Stanford and also to Bug Me, The
Daily's answer to Kafka. I'll be serving as your grand
inquisitor, getting answers to all those questions that
you would have asked but didn't because you've sent
them to me. That's my job, ma'am. I'm Bug Me.
In the past, Bug Me has tracked down the answers
to such perplexing problems as what is done with
food service leftovers, why there are some bicycles
on campus that have never been moved from the
front of your dorm in four years and just whether or
not new Supreme Court Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Associate Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor actually dated when they attended Stan
ford Law School together (we are told they may have,
but are assured that judicial restraint was always ex
ercised).
Bug Me does not, however, limit its scope to just
the University. My predecessors have inquired all
over the country to nail down the answers to such
questions as whether Yogi Bear was named for Yogi
Berra and why dog sled drivers yell "Mush!"
I'll try to answer as many questions as I can. But re
member: I'm not an attorney, and I'm not a sex thera
pist, though the two might make an interesting com
bination. Nothing is taboo in Bug Me (except dating
your sister in all but a few states) so send your ques
tions to Bug Me, Stanford Daily, Storke Publications
Building, Stanford, CA 94305. Or just drop it in my

box if you're by The Daily.
In the very near future, Bug Me will enter the tech
nology mainstream of the '80s and you'll be able to
send me questions on LOTS by electronic mail, if you
feel so inclined. More about that next week.
Now, on with the countdown.
Dear Bug Me,
What's up with the big, ugly parking structure
being built between the Med Center and the old
Anatomy Building (i.e. how much does it cost, what's
tlie purpose, will it reduce the number of cars parked
in the arboretum, etc.)?
— Seth Brundle
One assumes that a parking structure will be used
for parking cars, but who can tell? Dennis Perkinson,
the University's manager of transportation, says that
the latest estimate is that you will be able to park cars
there. In fact, you'll be able to park about 1,100 of

them there. The ground was broken this past winter,
and it should be done by next summer, depending
on the weather. The parking garage is budgeted at
$9.4 million and will have metered parking and
spaces for C permits. I've not been to the arboretum
lately, but the next time you are, park by the Med
Center.
Dear Bug Me,
How many different kinds of T-shirts does the
!x)okstore sell, and u 'here does it get the ugly designs?
— Ralph Lauren
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I needn't
tell vom that, Ralph. Depending on the day you visit
the bookstore and its stock, you'll find about 25 dif
ferent kinds of T-shirts, says Laura Dowling, the cloth
ing buyer for the Bookstore and Track House.
Dowling gets inundated by suggested designs from
shirt manufacturers as well as from students and
alums. Most of the manufacturers come up with their
own designs to garner what amounts to around an
eighth of the bookstore's total business, according to
Dowling.
Does anyone — like maybe you, Ralph — ever
suggest a design out of the goodness of his heart
because he doesn't like the available selection?
"People usually don't give me ideas," Dowling
says, but she would welcome any T-shirt desigas.
Maybe a Lake Lag Yacht Club T-shirt will someday
outsell Polo.
