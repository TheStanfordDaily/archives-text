## Students decide to be, or not to be, doctors 
### KELLY SUND Editorial Staff 
Fall quarter at Stanford seems to be
the most popular time of year for stu
dents to entertain the notion of becom
ing doctors. Freshmen, particularly,
find it easy to state medicine as their
chosen Field before encountering the
competitive classes that make up the
pre-med curriculum.
As the year goes by, though, pre
meds become scarcer and scarcer.
They don't just die off â€” they undergo
subtle metamorphoses to become clas
sics majors, economics majors and
other species of undergraduates.
Why do so many students abandon
their dreams of curing the world's
sick? What characteristics separate
those pre-meds that stick it out from
those that change their mind? The
answers to these questions can't be
simple.
Here are case studies illustrating the
college careers of two students who
entered Stanford in the fall of 1984 and
are currently juniors. Both came in as
pre-meds, and Karla Tinklenberg still
plans to be a doctor. Donna Caldwell
continues to major in biological
sciences, but she currently hopes to
earn a master's degree in business ad
ministration and make a career out of
public health administration. Although
comparing the two stories might not
lead to any concrete explanation of
why some pre-meds choose new occu
pations while others do not, the ac

counts shed some light on the subject.
Tinklenberg admits that part of her
interest in medicine might come from
the fact that her father is a physician
and her mother is a nurse practitioner.
Her parents often talk about their
work, and Tinklenberg says she is im
pressed that both their jobs.
"I think that's unusual. A lot of
people don't like getting up in the
morning and going to work. 1 know,
though, that I started considering
medicine during junior high," Tinklen
berg said, "because we had a career
day at the beginning of high school
and I knew I wanted to go to one of the
physician talks."
Tinklenberg has followed a tradi
tional pre-medical course of study at
Stanford. During her freshman year
she took the 20 series in calculus and
four chemistry courses. She took two
more chemistry classes during her
sophomore year and also completed
the six courses in the human biology
major core and several human biology
major electives during this time. Now,
during her junior year, she plans to
take the 20 series in physics and more
human biology major electives.
Most of Tinklenberg's doubts about
becoming a doctor stem from these
classes, "especially around midterm
and finals time."
"1 don't want to waste some of the
best years of my life stresed over
schoolwork the whole time," she said.
Tinklenberg said she has changed
the way she looks at being a pre-med

to help her deal with her worries
about succeeding. She has stopped
concentrating solely on being accepted
by a good medical school. Instead, she

said she focuses on her desire to be a
doctor and assumes that she will go to
medical school, even if she is not ac
cepted the first year she applies.

Caldwell's two older sisters are both
doctors, and she says they were in
fluential both in causing her to choose
a medical career and in finally decid
ing against one.
"My sisters and I have always had
similar interests," Caldwell said.
"When I discovered my love of biology
in high school, which is the same time
my sisters became interested in biol
ogy, 1 naturally assumed that I would
become a doctor also."
Caldwell's course of study has been
less traditional than Tinklenberg's.
Caldwell did not take calculus during
her freshman year, because, she said,
she "dislikes math" and does not plan
to take the 20 series in calculus until
her senior year.
Caldwell says she plans to take two
quarters of physics now, in her junior
year, and then go overseas spring quar
ter.
Caldwell says she decided during
winter quarter of her sophomore year

that she no longer wished to become a
doctor. Tough classes had little to do
with her decision, though, as she went
on to declare Biological Sciences as
her major duing the next quarter.
"Since 1 observed my sisters going
through medical school, internships
and residencies first-hand, 1 know
more about how difficult and un
pleasant it is to become a doctor than
most pre-meds," Caldwell said. "I
realized sophomore year that my inter
est in medicine wasn't strong enough
to make it worthwhile for me to go
through those years. I'm more inter
ested in a career in law or business
with a biological emphasis."
Since both Tinklenberg and
Caldwell are juniors, they could still
change their minds about their future
careers. But both appear confident in
their choices, having decided to
pursue or abandon a medical career
on the strength of their desires to
become doctors.
