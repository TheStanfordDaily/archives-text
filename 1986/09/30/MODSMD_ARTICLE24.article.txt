# Water polo aims for perfect year
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
The 1986 collegiate water polo
season is only three weeks old, but
top-ranked Stanford has been so domi
nant in compiling a 15-0 record that at
least one opposing coach is waving the
white towel of surrender.
"The UC-Irvine coach has said that
we shouldn't lose a game," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said yesterday.
In fact, the Irvine coach is not alone
in his prediction. Dettamanti is so
confident of his team's ability that he is
already comparing it to the 1981 Card
inal team that was undefeated and
captured the NCAA championship.
"We've had tremendous success,"
Dettamanti said. "It parallels our '81
team which dominated the other
teams."
The Stanford coach mentioned that
California, UCLA, Pepperdine, UC-
Santa Barbara and USC field strong
teams, but he suggested they would be
battling for the No. 2 spot.
"The only way those teams are going
to beat us is if we have a bad game,"
Dettamanti said.
So far this season, no team has come
close to blemishing the Cardinal's per
fect record. Stanford has outscored its
opponents 222-75, with its margin of
victory being almost 10 goals per
game.
The Irvine Tourney Sept. 19-21
brought together eight of the top 10
teams in the nation, but the Cardinal
made a mockery of the occasion. After
waltzing through the preliminary
rounds, the defending NCAA cham
pions stymied No. 2 Cal, 7-2, and then
knocked off UCLA, 12-5, for the cham
pionship.
On Sept. 18, UCSB came within two
goals of Stanford, losing 10-8. Pep
perdine also lost by a pair (12-10) to
the Cardinal in last Sunday's final of the
Brown Invitational. Yet, Dettamanti

said that even in those games Stanford
really was not challenged.
"Mainly, the games aren't as close as
the scores," he said, noting that the
Cardinal has held large leads in each of
its games. "The teams will come back
when I put my subs in."
As thoroughly as his team has
dominated the first few weeks of the
season, Dettamanti is not that
surprised. "We're the defending cham
pions and returning a lot of people —
four All-Americans," he said. "I thought
we would be a better team than last
year, and I thought that the Pac-10
teams would be a little down."
Leading the Cardinal offensive attack
are Craig Klass and David Imbernino.
Klass was the Pac-10 Player of the Year
for the 1985 season, and Imbernino has
garnered All-America honors the past
three years. Klass led Stanford with 13
goals during the team's five matches
the past weekend, and Imbernino fol
lowed with 11.
The defense has been highlighted by
the goalie tandem of All-American
Todd Kemp and Obi Greenman, who
alternate starting and each play one
half. "Our two goalies are playing very
well," Dettamanti said. "I think we
have two of the best goalies in the na
tion.
"We're not only scoring a lot of
goals, we're playing great defense."
The one low point on the season has
been an injury that has sidelined
senior Chris Thompson, a three-year
starter. Thompson suffered a collapsed
lung while lifting weights and could be
lost for the season.
"Just before the season started, it
collapsed on him," Dettamanti said.
"There were a couple of blisters on his
lung, and they had to operate. We have
to determine whether to bring him
back or redshirt him. We've played
well without him this year. We
definitely need him more next year
with players graduating."
