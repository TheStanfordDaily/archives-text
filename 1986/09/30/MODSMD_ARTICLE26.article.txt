## Defense hungry for revenge 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Coach Jack Elway came into yesterday's press con
ference feeling pretty much the same as he did after
his Stanford football team defeated Oregon State 17-
7 on Saturday: happy with the defense and special
teams, disappointed in the offense.
"What we're looking for is more consistency as far
as our personnel is concerned and putting more
points on the board," Elway said. "We had mistakes
in execution at the wrong time but not a lot of turn
overs."
A big problem Saturday was injuries. Wide
receiver Jeff James, the nation's leader with 18 recep

tions in his first two games, was out with a sprained
heel; tackle Jeff Marchin watched from the sidelines
with a pinched nerve in his neck; and tackle John
Zentner was forced to play with a pulled groin.
James "felt progressively better last week," Elway
said. "It's one of those things where the only thing is
for him to rest. We don't know right now whether
he'll play against San Diego State." Marchin and
Zentner are expected to be healthy for Saturday's
game at home against the 3-1 Aztecs.
The big news yesterday for the Cardinal was the
USA Today/CNN poll, which ranked Stanford No. 24
in the nation â€” the first time Stanford has appeared
in the poll since it began four years ago. The Cardinal

was one of six Pacific 10 Conference teams ranked in
the top 25.
"USA Today is right all the time. It's a real thrill to
be 24th," Elway said dryly. "Hey, if we win this one,
we might move up to 22nd."
Asked where he'd rank his undefeated Cardinal,
Elway said, "I'd rank us No. 1. No doubt in my mind.
Oklahoma and Washington lost, so they must be
lousy football teams," he joked.
That 3-0 record, the first for Stanford since 1972, is
due in large part to an improved defense. The Card
inal was mentioned in Sports Illustrated after the
team received complaints for dirty play from Texas


It took about five tacklers to bring down Stanford fullback Brian Morris last
Saturday, as the senior gained 20 yards on five carries. The second-leading

Kym Boyman/Daily file
rusher for the Cardinal also caught four passes against Oregon State and
threw the key block that led to Brad Muster's three-yard touchdown.
