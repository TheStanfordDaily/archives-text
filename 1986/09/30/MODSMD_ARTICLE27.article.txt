# Struggling men's soccer battles injuries, officials

### 
Adversity has been the companion of the Stanford men's
soccer team so far this season.
First, the Girdinal has been decimated by a long list of in
juries. The casualties are numerous: Pat Sheehy, a team cap
tain, is out with a broken foot; Tim Westergren, has a stress
fracture; leading returning scorer, Brian Mahaffey, is out for
the season with a stress fracture; Luke Garrott has a twisted
ankle; team captain Neal Stephens is sick; Jerry Maldonado
is also ill ... and so on.
Stanford struggled to overcome the loss of many key
players in last weekend's Pacific 10 Conference Tournament
only to fall victim to poor officiating.
The squad played well in a Friday night match against
powerhouse UCLA but lost 2-0. Then Stanford met host
school Washington.
Neither team scored in regulation although Stanford
Coach Sam Koch noted that the Cardinal did have goal op
portunities. The match went into overtime, but controversy
began even before regulation play ended.
With about four minutes left to play, freshman forward
Chris Porch was pulled down within the 18-yard line â€” an
infraction that, if called, would have resulted in a penalty
kick for the Cardinal.

However, no call was made. "It was a flagrant, obvious
foul," Koch said. "Everyone in the stands was wondering
why no call was made. Everyone on the sidelines was won
dering why no call was made."
The worst was yet to come. With two minutes left in the
overtime period, the official called a Washington goal on a
shot which failed to go over the line. Stanford lost the match
1-0.
"The goal was a crime," Koch said.
Some Washington players went up to Koch following the
game to apologize for the officiating.
"That showed how bad the call was," Koch said. "The Cal
coach was on the endline and even he said it wasn't a goal.
Normally we don't get along too well with Cal. He was in a
good position to see the play.
"When he (the official) called the goal and didn't call the
penalty kick ... that is pretty weak in character. It was very
disappointing because the players played so well, defended
very well. We had a chance to win in regulation but didn't.
We should have won it earlier.''
Stanford has now been shut out the last four games in a
row, as the team's record has dropped to 3-5-2. The squad
has yet to face Pacific Soccer Conference opposition.

Due to a rash of injuries to key players, the Stanford soccer team has yet to hit full stride this season. The team's
most recent losses came against UCLA on Friday and Washington on Saturday.
