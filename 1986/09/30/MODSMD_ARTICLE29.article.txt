## 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
Airing Oct. 4, courtesy of Stanford University Hospital,
Health Matters," a nationally syndicated television series
addressing a different medical problem each week, will find
its way into America's homes.
The series is aimed at a lay audience, and programs will
focus on such diverse topics as diabetes, AIDS, sleep prob
lems, aging, infertility, heart disease, drug/alcohol
rehabilitation and colorectal cancer. "Health Matters" will
l>e hosted by Carol Kline, a former news anchor at an ABC
affiliate in North Carolina. .
The first show, filmed at Stanford, is titled "The Assisted
Heart and will feature Dr. Norman Shumwav, chairman of
the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery.
According to program consultant Ron Goben, each half
hour program begins with a 15-minute feature segment
about a specific medical problem and may focus on either
recent advances in clinical research or how afflicted individ
uals cope with the problem. The second half is a local seg
ment in which medical experts discuss treatments and an
swer questions from an interviewer.
"Health Matters," which will be shown in 30 television
markets across the nation, is produced by Medstar, a
Pennsylvania-based company. According to Goben, a com
mittee from the hospital selects feature topics from a list
given to it by Medstar. The committee retains complete

editorial control and selects local experts to be interviewed
for the second part of the program.
Though clinical breakthroughs at Stanford receive a great
deal of attention from local and network television, this is
Â» the first time the hospital has actually sponsored a program.
Goben says the hospital is sponsoring the 22-week televi
sion series as a public service and "to increase the visibility
of the hospital."
"University hospitals have services and expertise as well
as nationally recognized physicians and programs unique to
the communities in which they reside," Spyros
Andreopolous, director of Stanford Medical Center commu
nications and consultant to the show, said in a recent press
release."They are, therefore, well-suited for taking leader
ship in this area."
He added that the goal is to have a program that is
credible, informative and consistent with Stanford's overall
philosophy of presenting topics from differing viewpoints.
All programs will be shown on KQED at noon on Satur
days and again at 7 a.m. on Fridays. They will be repeated on
KQED's sister station, KQEC, Thursdays at 9 p.m.
Experts lined up for the series include Dr. Michael Elias
tam, director of emergency services at Stanford Hospital; Dr.
William Hazle, medical director of the Stanford Alcohol and
Drug Treament Center; Cecele Quaintance, director of the
Mid-Costal Perinatal Outreach Program; and Dr. Hewlett
Lee, executive director of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic.
