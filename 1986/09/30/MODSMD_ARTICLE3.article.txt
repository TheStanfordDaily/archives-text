1 )espite national tenor over drug abuse and calls for drug
testing, Stanford's substance abuse policy will remain the
same, according to University officials.
I don't see a change in basic policy. Our posture is that
of educators, to help people make informed decisions," said
1 )iana Conklin, assistant dean of Student Affairs and director
of the How "On the other hand if we see someone in trou
ble we want to help them out, she said.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said: "I've been a
dean of students at various schools since 1962, and drugs
have been an issue for all but two of those years. It ebbs and
Hows.
"Certainly, drug testing is something new, but the hysteria
is not new," he said.
I see increasing pressure from outside to regulate stu
deni.s and to enforce regulations with more vigor," Conklin
said.
Before the 19605, schools operated in the place of par
ents lr seems that schools are going back to regulation,"
she said.
She said Stanford should resist the stampeding national
nxxxl on the drug abuse issue. "As an institution, we need
to keep a tenacious hold on our view of students as adults
and to help them make informed decisions."
' It's the fear of the unknown. In the 60s it was marijuana
and hallucinogens Now the unknown is crack," Lvons
added.
I lie University's drug policy, formulated in the 60s, has
worked well, he said.
Wr are not a sanctuary from the law," Lyons said . "We're
not good at enforcing things; we're good at producing edu
cational and psychological services that accompany drug
problems. We are augmenting the law.
The University's interest must go beyond a discplinarv
response to the problem," he said.
I'here s a difference between how we view use and how
we view abuse, " according to Lyons. Under Stanford's Fun
damental Standard, students may not engage in activities
that imperil other students, he said. "The distribution of
drugs that threaten the welfare and even the lives of others
is unacceptable.
The highly addictive nature of cocaine and crack, a
o K'.iine mixture that can be smoked, is "scary", he said. But
he added that drug testing doesn't appear to be a good
response.
The NCAA has required all varsity athletes to sign state
ments agreeing to be tested should they or their teams enter
post season competition, but Lyons said singling out ath
letes is hypocritical.
How can you justify testing athletes instead of other stu
dents-' If the objective is to eliminate or minimize the use of
certain drugs, is that necessarily the way to do it? We have
two fatal examples that it is not," he said, referring to the
drug-related deaths of basketball star Len Bias and football
star Don Rogers, who both were subject to drug testing
Perhaps other schools have less trust in their students,"
he s.ud " i rust is a ke\ ingredient in how we put this institu
tion together. Drug testing operates on the principle of
mistrust
Ik s.ud Stanford is the otih Pacific 10 Conference school
which has not instituted a drug-testing program for its ath
letic program.
I think drug testing is for the benenfit of coaches and
si nook not the athletes," he said. "I've had folks from other
schools tell me we don't want the embarassment of one of
out students being exposed There s only a concern tor my
team
Me s.iid a national study conducted by Michigan State in
dicates drug use among college students has gone down.
College students seem to be getting the brunt of some na
tional paranoia (drug testing* is a convenient way of
ducking responsibilit\ tor the issues that probably underlie
d ug abuse, he said.
