The University has added one year to the time that
must pass before the Delta Upsilon fraternity can apply
for recognition by Stanford, due to a "series of instances
of unacceptable behavior" by DU members since the fra
ternity's charter and housing priviliges were revoked in
May.
In an Aug. 27 letter to DU President Scott Hartman, As
sociate Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson wrote
that he had been initially inclined to impose a minimum
extension of two or three years to the time that the DUs
will spend unreconized and unhoused.
However, after noting that all current DU members,
including pleges, will likely be graduated by 1991, Rob
inson, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin
and Fraternal Afairs Adviser Joe Pisano, decided to add
only a year. The extension means the DUs must now wait
until winter quarter 1991 before the fraternity can peti
tion to regain group housing privileges.
Conklin said the three administrators acted against the
DUs in order to "let a generation pass in the hopes the
group will have a whole new self-definition and be free
of the old behavior."
The examples of unacceptable behavior Robinson

cited included pledging a new class of fraternity mem
bers despite being specifically told by Pisano not to do
so, several lewd and vulgar acts and recently discovered
destruction done by the DIJs to their house.
On July 14, the Row Facilities Office determined that
total damages attributable to current DU members were
almost $20,000. According to Conklin, the total cost of
the renovations necessary to make the DIJ s former
house inhabitable for residents exceeded $125,000.
Although some members of the fraternity have said
the damage was the result of normal wear and tear, Row
Facilities Director Lucy Williams said this summer:
"We re pretty experienced at this and know what s new
damage and what's old."
In his letter, Robinson listed a May 2 incident in which
four DU pleges chopped down three palm trees down in
the area north of Toyon Hall. When the four where ar
rested, Robinson wrote, they told police that they were
gathering palm fronds for a DU luau party, which was
planned apparently in violatioan April 15 ban on all so
cial events at the fraternity.
Robinson also noted a May 2 incident in which a group
of DU members disturbed the lower Row between 3 and
4 a.m. by singing vulgar and disparaging songs about the
Sigma Chi fraternity, while urinating on the plaque in
front of the Sigma Chi house.
