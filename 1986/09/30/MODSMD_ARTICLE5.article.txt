## 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
"It's a big, huge white bear, and it's
gone," a UC-Berkeley junior,
attesting to the fact that, despite intense
efforts by the UC police, Oskie the
Bear, Cal's seven-foot-tall stuffed mas
cot which has been missing since sum
mer. has not been found.
Berkeley police and students alike
are baffled, as culprits left no wit
nesses. no clues.
"You (Stanford) guys stole him,''
accused Chris Krueger of the Daily
California!!, Cal's campus newspaper.
"That's the hot conjecture. I've heard it
from a hundred people " According to
Krueger, the LJC police have "looked
everywhere" and "have followed the
dumbest leads in the history of police
investigation.'
One recent tip led Berkeley police
to a stuffed Alaskan brown bear in Oak
land's Golden Bear Bar. Another al
leged bear sighting turned out to be a
theatrical costume for a character
named Lurky Monster. Police were
again disappointed when a lead led
them to a stuffed bear from Marriott's
Grqat America.
Prior to his mysterious disap
pearance, Oskie was housed in a large
glass case in Berkeley s student union.
Custodians first noticed Oskie's disap
pearance the morning of Sunday, Aug
3. Krueger said one person claimed he
saw Oskie in Mountain View on Aug. ".
"I'm pretty P.O.'d, but I could see
why they would do it. said Berkeley
pre-law student Jini Dayenini.
"Supposedly, it's hidden at Stanford,
and they'll bring him out at Big Game.
Loyal to the traditional rivalry, she
added "You have to be pretty creative

to do something like tins so maybe
Stanford couldn't do it
Krueger said he expects Oskie to ap
pear on the 50-yard line at Big Game
painted red.
According to Krueger, Oskie i v
valued at upwards of $3,000. and
"people would like to see the bear
back."
Radio station KGO, which covers Cal
football games, is offering .1 $500
reward for Oskie's return. The As.s(X"i
ated Students of the University of Cali
forma, however, has yet to take action.
"We'd really like a picture to make
sure he's okay, to make sure his stuff
ing isn't all pulled out. said Krueger
The Daily Californian has offered com
plete anonymity to Oskie's captors
should they agree to furnish such ;i
photograph.
Like many distraught students
Krueger asked, If you didn't steal him
who the hell did?
Because of its 94-year old Big Game
rivalry with Berkeley. Stanford is con
sidered by many to be a prime suspect
in the case, but Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington has said he doesn't
"think it has anything to do with Stan
ford.
"My advice (to the Berkeley police)
was to look closer to home, Her
rington told The Daily last month.
Despite Herrington s theories, the
Berkeley police have asked Stanford
police to "keep an eye open' for the
bear, Herrington said.
Known pranksters on campus have
denied any involvement in the matter
Jeff Stevens, manager for the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band, said the Band had not taken part
in the bear-napping
