### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
President Reagan has not yet responded to a letter drafted
by Council of Presidents Member Mary Thurber and signed
by -<3 other student leaders from around the country - , urging
him to impose economic sanctions against the apartheid
based regime in South Africa. •»
Since receiving the letter, Reagan has vetoed a bill calling
for economic sanctions, but Thurber said she is still hopeful
that the letter has had an impact.
The letter has made the (Reagan) administration realize
that students are watching the apartheid issue closely, she
said The signatures represent thousands of potential
voters — a force President Reagan cannot neglect," Thurber
said in a press release.
Fhe COP member said she fully expects Reagan to
respond to the letter, signed by student leaders from com
munity, state and private colleges
The letter criticizes the Reagan adminsitration s current
policy of "constructive engagement, which calls for Ameri
can businesses to try to effect change by maintaining a pres
ence in the white-ruled countrv

" Constructive engagement' has been \our policy toward
South Africa for over five years; yet. it has produced no
definitive changes within that country the letter reads.
The letter, which was mailed Sept. 16, represents the
beginning of a national campaign on the part of students
here and elsewhere to have greater impact on pressing is
sues, according to Thurber. "Student government presi
dents .. feel the time has come for them to take their lob
bying efforts beyond the campus ,md onto the national
level," she said in the release
Thurber currently has plans to pursue this national cam
paign after she receives President Reagan's repK to the let
ter, she said. The first step is to establish a student network
to keep the communication open between those student
representatives who expressed an interest in the letter, she
said.
One of Thurber s goals for the proposed network is to
send a delegation of 20 or 30 students to meet with Reagan,
she said, adding that it ma\ lx* possible to schedule the
meeting as soon as November or December.
Through the network, student leaders will also be able to
keep abreast on issues such as tuition costs, legislation at
feet ins grants and loans to students, she said

Thurber said she is confident the ASM will he in favor of
the plan to create the network when she presents it to the
senate this quarter
Before drafting and distributing the letter to approxi
mately 300 student leaders, Thurber contacted fellow COP
member Carey White. The two presidents agreed that stu
dents here would be in favor of the idea, ciiing last year's
passage of a referendum calling for the I niversity to divest
shares of stock in companies doing business in South Africa,
she said.
Thurber was unable to contact the other two COP mem
bers, she said.
Explaining the fact that onh 43 out of 300 student leaders
signed the letter, Thurber said mam student governments
were unable to get their acts together over the summer.
It may not have been the time to send the letter but
those who did sign it were very pleased, Thurber said.
Schools whose student leaders did not sign the letter in
clude Harvard, Vale and Princeton.
Thurber said she plans to write to schools that didn't par
ticipate in the letter campaign and invite them to join the
network of nclkxjls interested in lobbsing on a national
level
