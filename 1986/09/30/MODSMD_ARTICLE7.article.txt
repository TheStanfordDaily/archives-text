Emergency budget debated
WASHINGTON — The Senate opened debate on a $556 billion catch-all
spending bill yesterday, but quick passage appeared unlikely, and law
makers were looking at stop-gap legislation to keep the government going
when fiscal 1987 begins tomorrow.
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) chairman of the Senate Appropriations Com
mittee, said he hoped "the single largest appropriations measure this body
has ever considered," would clear the Senate late today or early tomorrow
without major changes.
Hatfield's committee had stripped out many of the House-passed provi
sions that sparked threats of a veto by President Reagan. But keeping the
bill free from add-ons in the Senate would be a challenge.
In the first test, the Senate refused to approve $200 million in special aid
tor the Philippines. By a S1 -43 vote, it rejected an amendment by Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) that would have taken that money from assis
tance to other nations except Israel and Egypt.
But there were 120 other amendments pending, including one by Hat
field on a nuclear arms freeze.
President Reagan has cited arms control limitations as the leading
reasons he would veto a House-approved $562 billion spending bill.
The House approved a freeze on spending for Reagan's "Star Wars"
missile defense system, continuation of a ban on anti-satellite weapons
tests, a prohibition of LI S. nuclear weapons tests so long as the Soviets ob
serve their own test ban, a ban on chemical weapons and a requirement
that the administration comply with the SALT II treaty.
Even it the Senate completes its work before tomorrow, striking a final
compromise with the House that also was acceptable to the administration
would be nearly impossible by then. Without authority to spend their al
lowances, government agencies would be forced to close down.
To avert such a crisis, Congress was expected to pass a stop-gap bill that
would allow agencies to continue operating at their current budget levels
in the new fiscal year.
Criminal reforms proposed
WASHINGTON — A federal commission proposed a sweeping rewrite of
criminal sentencing procedures yesterday, carrying out congressional or
ders to sharply limit judges' discretion in sentencing and eliminate early
release of prisoners through parole.
The U.S. Sentencing Commission, a nine-member panel created by
Congress in 19H4, published its plan for mandatory sentencing guidelines
in a 170-page draft report. The commission will propose final guidelines
early next year, which will be binding on all federal judges unless Congress
votes to overturn them.
The system would remove the nearly unfettered discretion in sentencing
that judges now enjoy, replacing it with a numerical ranking system for all
crimes that would require judges to hand down sentences within narrow
ranges. Congress enacted the law to reduce wide disparities in sentences
for similar crimes.
Commission Chairman William Wilkins Jr., a judge on the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., said the panel plans to seek significantly
tougher sentences for white-collar crime and drug trafficking. While only
15 percent of defendants now go to prison for price-fixing, for example,
the panel would require two to eight months in prison for offenses involv
ing less than $1 million while also mandating incarceration for securities
fraud and other white-collar offenses.
The system assigns "weights" to different aspects of roughly 2,600 crimi
nal offenses. Judges would have to tally these numbers and hand down sen
tences within narrow ranges, which could not fall outside the maximum or
minimum sentences now on the books.
The most revolutionary change is that the 40,000 prisoners sentenced
each year could no longer be paroled after serving as little as one-third of
their sentences, as is now common. Instead, prisoners would have to serve
their full terms, with reductions of up to days a year for good behavior.
Jaruzelski meets with Deng
PEKING — For the first time in more than a quarter century, the top
leaders of China's Communist Party met face-to-face yesterday with a Com
munist Party chief from a Soviet-bloc nation.
The Polish leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who is in Peking for a three
day visit, conferred yesterday morning with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
and then with the Chinese party general secretary, Hu Yaobang.
In the meetings, the Polish leader apparently sought to emphasize that
China has common bonds with other Communist countries. The official
New China News Service said that Jaruzelski "extended congratulations to
Deng on China's successes resulting from the open policy, saying that all
Socialist countries are closely following China's development."
Jaruzelski is first secretary of the Polish Communist Party, and his session
with Hu represented in effect a restoration of the links between the Polish
and Chinese parties that were suspended during the bitter ideological feud
between China and the Soviet Union in the early 19605.
"When Jaruzelski is received by Hu Yaobang, it's a de facto normalization
of relations between their parties," a Western European diplomat said.
Not since the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's visit to Peking in 1959
has any leader of the Chinese party met with his counterpart from the So
viet Union or any of its closest allies in Eastern Europe — Poland, East Ger
many, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.
The only Eastern European party leaders to visit China since then have
been those from Romania and Yugoslavia, the rtvo nations that carry
foreign policy relatively independent of the Soviet Union.
Jaruzelski s stop here is expected to be the first in a series of visits to
China by leaders of Soviet bloc countries. East German leader Erich
Honecker is scheduled to arrive here next month, and Hungarian leader
Janos Kadar or another senior Hungarian party leader is likely to come
here within the next year.
India to buy U.S. engines
NEW DELHI, India — In what would be the first major purchase of mili
tary equipment from the United States in years, India has indicated that it is
prepared to use General Electric engines in the development of its new
generation of combat aircraft, according to well-informed sources.
The light combat aircraft, as the plane is being called during its design
phase, is intended to be India's first indigenously produced major
warplane and would come into ser\ ice in the mid-19905. It would serve the
country well into the 21st century. The craft carries few weapons and
primarily is used to intercept other aircraft, rather than to support ground
troops
The aircraft is one ot three or tour projects clearly designed to propel In
dia, which already has the world's fourth-largest armed forces, info self
reliance in major weapons systems that so far it has had to purchase from
the Soviet Union or the West.
Reports in the Indian press that General Electric has received from India
a letter of intent to buy the engines drew a formal "no comment from the
I defense Ministry yesterday, but the decision to go ahead with the American
engine purchase reportedly has been made, according to sources who
have been following the protracted discussions closely.
U S officials in Washington said the} had been informed that approval of
the deal "was on the way
The powerful F404 engine is used in the FlB Hornet and in Northrop's
F2O and is looked upon in aviation circles as one of the most advanced jet
engines currently operational
India is designing its own jet engine at its laboratories in Bangalore, but
it is not expected to tx* operational for several years.
The initial discussions with General Electric reportedly involve the pur
chase of at least 10 F404 engines for the early prototypes of the light com
bat aircraft and perhaps as many as SO to 60 more, depending upon the
pace of development of the Indian engine. Total production of the aircraft
likely will run into the hundreds.
A final contract for the engines has yet to be negotiated but the initial
purchase alone would be worth many millions of dollars
