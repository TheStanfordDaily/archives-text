# Daniloff freed by Soviets

WASHINGTON' — American journalist Nicholas
Daniloff was released from house arrest in the Soviet
Union and flown home yesterday as part of a deal
that will also free a suspected Soviet spy, void the ex
pulsion of some suspected spies from the Soviet mis
sion to the United Nations and later release a
prominent Soviet dissident from exile in Siberia, U.S.
officials said.
President Reagan, asked by reporters yesterday if
he had "blinked in the standoff, replied: "They
blinked," referring to the Soviets.
The complex swap, outlined by government
sources, signals the end of a month-long freeze in
U.S.-Soviet relations and clears the path to a summit
between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev by year's end.
A series of "favorable announcements" leading up
to the summit will mask the fact that both sides have
abandoned tough positions that had made the
Daniloff dispute one of the rockiest in recent U.S.-
Soviet relations, said the sources, who refused to be
named.
The United States, in particular, has agreed to drop
its highly publicized expulsion of several suspected

Soviet spies at the U.N. mission, including one man
identified as the KGB station chief in New York, one
source said. Another likelv to remain, a source said,
is the resident agent for the Soviet GRU, or military
intelligence bureau.
Those expulsions had been touted by White House
officials as evidence of the United States' toughness
with the Soviets over their arrest of Daniloff on
trumped-up spy charges early this month.
The next step in the agreement was to be taken at 9
a.m. EDT today in New York, where accused Soviet
spy Gennadiy Zakharov was to plead no contest
before a federal magistrate to three counts related to
espionage against the United States. A no-contest plea
is not an admission of guilt but is legally the same as
a conviction, in that it allows a judge to mete out
punishment.
Under the agreement, Zakharov will be allowed to
leave the country lout will not be officially expelled, a
detail one source termed "a distinction without a dif
ference."
Within a week, the Soviet Union is expected to
reply by releasing dissident Soviet physicist Yuri Or
lov, now exiled in Siberia after serving seven years in

a labor camp, and his wife, lrina, sources said.
Orlov, 61, is a physicist who was arrested in 1977
after joining fellow dissident Anatoly Shcharansky in
founding a group to monitor Soviet compliance with
the human rights provisions of the Helsinki accords.
Daniloff, 51, told reporters at Moscow's
Sheremetevo Airport that he was unaware of what
kind of deal was struck to allow him to leave. He said
that he was informed only yesterday afternoon, a few
hours before his Lufthansa flight took off for
Frankfurt, that he was free to leave.
To conclude the deal, the United States has agreed
to renegotiate its previously ordered expulsion of 25
Soviets at the United Nations, all of whom have been
identified by administration officials as operatives of
Soviet intelligence agencies.
Fourteen of the Soviets already have left the
country, but the departure date for the remaining 11
has been delayed from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15. Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze is personally
negotiating permission for at least six or seven of the
11 to remain in the United States for the remainder
of their terms.
