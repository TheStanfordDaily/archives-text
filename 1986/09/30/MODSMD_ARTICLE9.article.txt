# Israel indicts man as war criminal
## 
### 
JERUSALEM â€” The Israeli govern
ment yesterday formally indicted
former Cleveland autoworker John
Demjanjuk for World War II crimes it
described as "amongst the most
serious and awful in human history.
The action, which came seven
months after Demjanjuk's extradition
from the United States to Israel, sets
the stage for the country's first war
crimes trial since Adolf Eichmann was
convicted 25 years ago of overseeing
the systematic extermination of mil
lions of European Jews. Eichmann was
hanged in 1962.
The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, 66,
was accused in the indictment of com
mitting "crimes against the Jewish
people, crimes against humanity, war
crimes and crimes against minorities"
as a sadistic guard known as "Ivan the
Terrible" at the Treblinka death camp
in Poland. He emigrated to the
United States in 1952 and settled in
Cleveland.
Demjanjuk faces the death penalty in
a trial now expected to begin in

December and to last for several
weeks.
The former Ford Motor Co. em
ployee has contended that he is the vic
tim of mistaken identity perpetuated
by Soviet authorities who provided im
portant physical evidence against him
in connection with previous legal
proceedings in the United States.
Demjanjuk was stripped of his U.S.
citizenship in 1981 after being found
guilty of lying about his past when he
immigrated. A Soviet-supplied copy of
an identity card issued in his name by
authorities at a Nazi training facility for
death camp guards was a key exhibit in
both the citizenship case and his sub
sequent extradition to Israel.
Speaking to reporters outside the
Jerusalem district courthouse yester
day morning, Demjanjuk's American
attorney, Mark O'Connor, repeatedly
raised the case of American reporter
Nicholas Daniloff in questioning the
reliability of Soviet-supplied evidence
against his client.
