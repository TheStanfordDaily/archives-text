## New Children's Hospital moves to meet future medical challenges 
### 
As you walk the quiet corri
dors of Children's Hospi
tal at Stanford, time seems
suspended. Around you, children
are fighting for life and health.
Dedicated doctors and nurses are
fulfilling an age-old commitment
to the young and vulnerable.
In fact, you are witnessing a rush
of medical progress. Deadly afflic
tions of the recent past, such as
tuberculosis, rheumatic fever and
polio, are gone. The end is com
ing for such intractable enemies
as cancer, leukemia and cystic
fibrosis. Researchers in nearbv

laboratories are advancing stead
ily into the realm of genes and
molecular processes, where they
are finding tools to combat many
more diseases.
To maintain this rapid advance,
and to continue serving the spe
cial medical and emotional needs
of young patients, Children's
Hospital and Stanford University
will soon build a new, world-class
facility. The new Children's Hos
pital will adjoin Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center and will

continue all the pediatric pro
grams currently offered by Chil
dren's and Stanford University
Hospitals.
Progress is nothing new at Chil
dren's Hospital. From the day of
its founding in 1919 as a home for
convalescent children, the hospi
tal has grown steadily in impor
tance as a center for pediatric care
and research.
Each step forward in knowledge
has been translated into new facil
ities and new services. Originally,
the Convalescent Home was quar
tered in a wing of the old Leland
Stanford summer place that sur
vived the 1906 earthquake. Four
separate nursing units were con

structed in the 1920'5. Except for
the McLaughlin Unit, those struc
tures were demolished in the late
1960's and replaced with the
existing hospital.
As the medical sciences have
advanced, so has awareness of
children's emotional, intellectual
and spiritual needs. For example,
those who treat children have
learned how much the strength of
the family contributes to the
recovery of the child. Over the
decades, the family has become
the cornerstone of care at Chil
dren's Hospital.
All of this knowledge and expe
rience will be incorporated into

the new Children's Hospital
building. Special rooms and facili
ties will be provided for such
advanced therapies as bone mar
row transplantation. The modern
diagnostic, therapeutic and surgi
cal resources of Stanford Univer
sity Hospital will be just a few
steps away. For most patient
beds, there will be built-in "par
ent beds" so that mothers and
fathers can stay close to their chil
dren around the clock.
Ground-breaking for the new
125-bed Children's Hospital is
scheduled for autumn of 1987,
and the new building should be
completed by early 1990.
