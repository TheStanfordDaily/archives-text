# Digestive disease center treats body and mind
## 
### 
Diseases of the digestive
system can be difficult to
diagnose and treat. In
many cases, both mind and body
are involved. For example, when
a child is stressed by a parental
divorce or the birth of a sibling,
the problem often shows up in
the digestive system as colitis or
an ulcer. And when a child
suffers from an organic digestive
disorder, the physical symptoms
may be complicated by psycho
logical distress.
Now, by drawing together exper
tise and technology from several
medical disciplines, Children's

Hospital is helping children fight
this potentially devastating group
of illnesses.
The new Pediatric Center for
Digestive Diseases and Nutri
tional Support treats long-term
digestive ailments and offers
nutritional support to children
with special metabolic needs.
Physicians and nurses team up
with psychologists, social workers
and nutritionists to assess and
treat each young patient.

Co-directors of the Center are Dr.
John Kerner, associate professor
of pediatrics at Stanford Univer
sity Medical School, and Dr.
Ricardo Castillo, assistant profes
sor of pediatrics at Stanford. Dr.
Kerner has received national rec
ognition for his textbook, Manual
of Pediatric Parenteral Nutrition. Dr.
Castillo is also well-known for his
research and teaching in pediatric
nutrition.
