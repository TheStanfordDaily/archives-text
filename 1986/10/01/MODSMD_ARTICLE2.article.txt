# Clinic helps obese youngsters grow to normal weight
## 
### 
Fat is a problem
for many Ameri
can children.
Approximately 15
percent of all U.S.
youngsters are clini
cally obese. A Chil-

dren's Hospital at Stanford
research team is starting with
patients as young as four years of
age to treat this demoralizing and
dangerous condition.
Studies have demonstrated that
obese children are likely to
become obese adults. A long-term
weight problem poses life
threatening medical risks.

"Clinical obesity is associated
with physiological complications,
such as high blood pressure and
diabetes, as well as psychological
disorders, including low self
esteem and depression,"
explained Dr. Lawrence D.
Hammer, director of a pilot
program designed to treat
obesity in pediatric patients
But improper attempts to
lose weight can be just as
dangerous as obesity.
"Children must have adequate
nutrition in order to develop nor
mally. Uncontrolled dieting can
actually retard growth," Dr. Ham
mer continued. "Parents should
be very cautious about putting
young children on diets without
adequate supervision."

There are no easy answers to
childhood obesity. But Children's
Hospital researchers think that,
by intervening early, they can
help children learn new attitudes
and behavior patterns that will be
carried into adulthood. Their pilot
treatment program is aimed at
building healthy eat
ing patterns, encour
aging selection of
more nutritious foods
and increasing physical activity.
Dr. Hammer, Assistant Professor
of Pediatrics at Stanford Univer
sity School of Medicine, along
with Dr. Robert L. Berkowitz,
Clinical Assistant Professor of
Psychiatry, and research assistant
Ronda Flanzbaum, has focused
initially on overweight children
between the ages of four and six.
The Children's Hospital program
is designed to influence the eating
patterns of the whole family. For
each child, at least one parent
must participate in 12 weekly
sessions.
The goal of this program is not
weight loss but rather a healthier
proportion of weight to height.
The yardstick for measuring suc
cess is the Body Mass Index

(BMI), which is calculated by
dividing weight by the square of
the height. A growing youngster
could actually gain weight but
also gain more height and come
out a winner in terms of BMI.
Of ten children who participated
in the first pilot pro
gram, nine com
pleted the course.
Preliminary results
have been encouraging.
The average BMI for the group
declined from 23.85 to 22.95, or
approximately five percent. On
the average, each child lost two
thirds of a pound while growing
about three-quarters of an inch.
Mothers who participated in the
program also lost weight, about
2.5 pounds apiece. Researchers
theorize that this reflects parents'
better understanding of nutri
tional principles and a generally
better "food environment" in the
home.
This achievement is particularly
impressive in view of the fact that
the children were wrestling with
severe weight problems. Partici
pants in the program were gener
ally more than 20 percent above
their ideal body weights and eight
of the nine finishers were among
the top five percent of their age
group in terms of body mass
index.
The Children's Hospital pro
gram utilized the "Traffic Light
Diet" developed at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh. The Traffic
Light system divides foods into
three groups based on nutritional
value relative to calories. Nutri
tious, low-calorie foods such as
fresh fruits and vegetables get a
"green light," meaning that you
can eat all you want. Red light
foods, such as cake, candy and
pizza, should be reserved for spe
cial occasions. The yellow light
category should be consumed
with caution.

Therapists used games and flash
cards to help children distinguish
between food groups. The young
sters also exercised for 15 minutes
during each hour-long meeting.
"They need to learn what it feels
like to have their hearts beat fast,
to work up a sweat, and to get
tired," Dr. Hammer explained.
Meanwhile, the parents learned
to encourage correct eating habits
and daily physical activity as well
as to control the foods made
available to their children at
home. The group sessions also
allowed the parents to discuss the
difficulties they experienced.
The parents helped their children
keep daily records of the foods
they ate. Children who achieved
their dietary goals were rewarded
with stickers and praise.
According to Dr. Hammer, the
Traffic Light Diet may sound sim
ple but it is not easy.
"It's almost impossible to go to a
fast food restaurant and stay
within the dietary recommenda
tions," he pointed out. "Practi
cally the only thing they could
have would be plain
hamburgers."

Dr. Hammer and his colleagues
plan to organize a second pilot
program in the
near future.
Children's Hos
pital also offers
individual evalu
ation and treat
ment programs
for overweight children and
teenagers.
Funding for the pilot program has
been provided by the multidisci
plinary Stanford Center for the
Study of Youth Development.
