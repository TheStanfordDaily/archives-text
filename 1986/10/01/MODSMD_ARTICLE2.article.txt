# Clinic helps obese youngsters grow to normal weight
## 
### 
Fat is a problem
for many Ameri
can children.
Approximately 15
percent of all U.S.
youngsters are clini
cally obese. A Chil-

dren's Hospital at Stanford
research team is starting with
patients as young as four years of
age to treat this demoralizing and
dangerous condition.
Studies have demonstrated that
obese children are likely to
become obese adults. A long-term
weight problem poses life
threatening medical risks.
