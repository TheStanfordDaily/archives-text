# Children's Hospital remembers Floyd McElroy, a lifelong friend
## 
### 
Floyd L. McElroy, a longtime
friend and former trustee of
Children's Hospital at Stan
ford, died at his home in Wood
side on Saturday, September 20.

Mr. McElroy's association with
Children's Hospital dates back to
May, 1920, when he helped organ
ize a work day for
Stanford students
at the hospital
site. With the
cooperation of
President Ray
Lyman Wilbur,
who declared a
half holiday, the students cleaned
up the old Leland Stanford resi
dence and prepared it for use as a
children's convalescent home.
The tradition of "Con Home"
work days persisted into the
1960'5.

Mr. McElroy was elected presi
dent of Stanford's Associated Stu
dents in the spring of 1920. In
June he represented the student
body at the dedication of the
Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children, the original predecessor
of today's Children's Hospital.
A native of Ukiah, California, Mr.
McElroy worked his way through
Stanford by operating a laundry
agency and pressing clothes.
Later he won a scholarship to the
Harvard University Graduate
School of Business, which he sup
plemented by selling Wearever
Aluminum cookware and wash
ing dishes at Cambridge
Cafeteria.
Mr. McElroy went on to a suc
cessful career with the investment
counseling firm of Loomis, Sayles

& Co., from which he retired as
Chairman of the Board in 1964.
Returning to live in Woodside, he
served on the Children's Hospital
Board from 1967 to 1976.
In 1966, Mr. McElroy agreed to
chair the $4.6 million "Progress
Fund" which financed construc
tion of the current Children's
Hospital facility. He took great
satisfaction in turning his skills as
an investment counselor to this
cause. Addressing his fellow
financial professionals, he said:
"What better mission in life could
I have served?"
Upon Mr. McElroy's retirement
from the Board in 1976, his fellow
directors named a 15-bed nursing
unit in his honor. The Floyd L.
McElroy Pavilion continues to
house children admitted to Chil
dren's Hospital for treatment of
catastrophic childhood illnesses.
Mr. McElroy and the former Edith
Margaret Chelini of Vallejo were
married in the Stanford Memorial
Chapel in 1925. Dr. Charles Gard
ner, Stanford chaplain and a
founder of Children's Hospital,
performed the ceremony.
Along with his wife of 61 years,
Mr. McElroy is survived by two
daughters, Betty McElroy Bogart
of San Francisco and Jean McEl
roy Converse of Bronxville, N.Y.
There are four grandchildren.
The family asks that memorial
gifts be made to the Floyd L.
McElroy Fund at Children's Hos
pital or to the Floyd L. McElroy
Fellowship at the Stanford School
of Business.
