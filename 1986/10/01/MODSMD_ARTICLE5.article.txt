# Intrepid trio walks Divide for Children's
## 
### 
After five months and 3,100
miles on fungus-riddled
feet, three young men
walked out of the woods in Cana
da's Glacier National Park last
September having raised $16,000
in gifts for Children's Hospital at
Stanford.
Jeff Child, Jim Borden and Mark
Belton quit their jobs in January to
plan their trek along the Conti
nental Divide. It was to be the
last, great adventure of youth for
the high school and college bud
dies, as well as a fund-raiser for
the kids at Children's Hospital.
The expedition was a success on
all counts. Setting off from the
border town of Antelope Wells,
N.M. on March 13, the trio con
quered some of the roughest ter
rain in the lower 48 as they
traversed New Mexico, Colorado,
Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
Their route took them up to
13,100 feet, through Rocky Moun
tain snow country (which they
traversed on cross country skis)

and across the basins and ranges
of the northern plains states.
The hikers were wary of ava
lanches and grizzly bears. Thanks
to caution and good luck, they
avoided misfortune. The worst
health problem they encountered
was athlete's foot.
The trip was as much a feat of
logistics as a physical challenge.
Before leaving, the three friends
packed more than 2,500 pounds

of food, maps and other essen
tials for shipment to general deliv
ery at 23 rural post offices along
the route. Although they each lost
15 to 20 pounds, it was not from
lack of eating. Their supply sys
tem worked.
The team also proved effective at
raising money. They enlisted the
support of eight corporate spon
sors and, with the help of volun
teer graphics professionals,
produced an attractive brochure.
The suggested minimum contri
bution to Children's Hospital was
a penny a mile, or $30. For three
cents a mile, contributors received
postcards from three points in the
journey.
After homecoming welcomes
from their families and the staff at
Children's Hospital, the three
adventurers are ready to live in
civilization. But they have not run
out of challenges. For one thing,
"it's going to take some time to
get adjusted to people again,"
said Jeff Child.
