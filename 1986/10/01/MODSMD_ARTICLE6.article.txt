# New bone marrow means new hope for Kelly
## 
### 
Bette George of Sultana has
learned more than she
wants to know about lym
phoma since her nine-year-old
daughter, Kelly, was diagnosed
with the disease in December,
1984. When Kelly's symptoms
reappeared last summer, after
many difficult months of chemo
therapy and a brief period of
remission, Bette knew that the
next step was bone marrow
transplantation.
A year ago, that would have
meant a long stay in Seattle, a
thousand miles from the George
family's Central Valley home. But
today Kelly is getting well in
Palo Alto, slowly rebuilding her
immune system with bone mar
row donated by her eleven-year
old brother, Jason.
As Kelly's family has learned, the
transplant procedure is just one
part of a successful bone marrow
program. The patient must return
to the hospital frequently for
checkups, medication and blood
products. If something seems
amiss, they want a place like Chil
dren's Hospital to be close by.
So, while Kelly's dad, Stephen,
stays in Sultana to manage the
family orchards and fruit packing
business, Kelly and Bette are liv
ing next door to Children's Hos
pital in the Ronald McDonald
House. An innovative day hospi
tal program at Children's pro
vides specialized treatment on an
outpatient basis.
The only drawback to this
arrangement is that Kelly must
still avoid close contact with other
children at Ronald McDonald
House. Her resistance to infection
will be low for several months to
come. Even an ordinary cold
could be catastrophic. With chil
dren like Kelly in mind, the
Ronald McDonald Board recently

announced plans to add 12 rooms
to the facility. The addition will
include several units designed
specifically for bone marrow or
organ transplant patients and
their families.
Kelly's doctor is Michael Amylon,
M.D., staff hematologist-oncolo
gist at Children's Hospital and
assistant professor of pediatrics at
Stanford University School of
Medicine. According to Dr. Amy
lon, bone marrow transplantation
is now the treatment of choice for
several types of leukemia, as well
as other blood disorders including
aplastic anemia and immune defi
ciency states.
The donor is usually a brother or
sister. In Kelly's case, her tissues
matched perfectly with Jason's.
The first step in transplantation is
destruction of the body's own
bone marrow (and immune sys
tem) by means of total body irra
diation and chemotherapy.
Meanwhile, healthy bone marrow
cells are collected from the back
of the donor's hip bone with a
needle and a syringe.

Then the donated marrow is
injected into the donor's blood
stream through a vein, much like
a blood transfusion.
To shield bone marrow recipients
from infection, Children's Hospi
tal built a special suite of pressur
ized rooms with air filters to
remove airborne dust and germs.
This $200,000 facility, along with
special staff training and other
expenses, was funded by a
$130,000 challenge grant from the
James Irvine Foundation and
matching gifts from other donors.
Researchers at Stanford and else
where are continuing to explore
the genetic and immune systems
and to develop new treatments
based on transplantation tech
niques. Dr. Amylon foresees a
day when doctors may be able to
replace defective or missing genes
in bone marrow cells, rather than
just replacing the cells. This
approach might open the door to
cures for such inherited diseases
as sickle cell anemia and thalasse
mia as well as inborn metabolic
disorders.


Doing very nicely, thank you: Kelly George and her mother, Bette,
meet Dr. Michael Amylon in the day hospital for a progress check.
