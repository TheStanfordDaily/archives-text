# Donors invited to share Hopkins legacy
## 
### 
Friends of Children's Hospi
tal who plan annual gifts of
$1,000 or more are invited
to participate in the Mrs.
Timothy Hopkins Society,
a group that carries on
the tradition of the
woman who laid the
organization's finan
cial foundation.
The Hopkins Society
was established
recently by the Chil
dren's Hospital
Board to honor both
Mrs. Hopkins and
the benefactors of the
current era. Members'
gifts will be used to sup
port innovative patient care
and research programs. Partici
pants will be kept informed of
advances in the work of the hos
pital through special presenta
tions and tours.

Known as the "godmother" of the
Stanford Convalescent Home,
predecessor of Children's Hospi
tal, Mrs. Timothy Hopkins served

as the first Chairman of the
Endowment Committee. Her
extraordinary vision led to the
creation of the Women's
Advisory Board, which
later grew into six thriv
ing Auxiliaries with a
membership of more
than 2,200.
Mrs. Hopkins'
unique legacy to
Children's Hospital
includes a collection
of dolls that contin
ues to delight young
patients and visitors.
Born Mary Kellogg
Crittenden, she was
married to Timothy
Hopkins, son of railroad
pioneer Mark Hopkins and one
of Stanford University's original
trustees.
Invitations to charter membership
in the Hopkins Society are being
sent to friends of Children's Hos
pital. For more information,
please call (415) 327-4800, exten
