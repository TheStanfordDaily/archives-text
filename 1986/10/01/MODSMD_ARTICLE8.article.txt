# It's time to review your giving plans
## 
### 
Now that the new tax code has
been signed into law, contributors
should review their plans for
charitable giving. Some donors
may benefit by making certain
types of contributions now rather
than later.
For example, those who do not
itemize deductions will be able to
reduce their taxable incomes by
the entire amount of any gifts
made before the end of 1986. This
one-time benefit can help reduce
1986 tax bills calculated under the
existing higher rate structure.
Whether you give today or tomor
row, your support means new
hope to young lives. But be sure
to ask a professional tax advisor
how the new regulations will
affect your giving plans.
