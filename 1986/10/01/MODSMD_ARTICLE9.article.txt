The Allied Arts Guild, operated
by the Woodside-Atherton Auxil
iary to Children's Hospital at 75
Arbor Road in Menlo Park, is
gearing up for the holidays. The
Traditional Shop has assembled a
delightful collection of hand
carved and hand-painted orna
ments, holiday greeting cards,
exquisite crystal and other
unusual items. Allied Arts is open
Monday through Saturday from

Of special interest among Allied
Arts gift ideas is Taste the Season,
a cookbook featuring over 100
tempting seasonal recipes that
blend new and traditional Califor

nia tastes. This beautiful volume
was produced by members of the
Woodside-Atherton Auxiliary, led
by Food Editor Donna Hicks and
Project Director Tita Kolozsi. It is
available at major Peninsula book,
department and specialty stores,
as well as the Traditional Shop.
The Palo Alto Auxiliary brings
