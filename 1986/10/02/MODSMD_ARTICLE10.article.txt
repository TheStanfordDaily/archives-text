# S. Africa threatens grain boycott
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — South African Foreign Minister
Pik Botha warned at least two Republican senators in
a long-distance telephone call yesterday that the
Pretoria government intends to halt grain purchases
from the United States if, as expected, Congress
enacts sanctions against that government.
Supporters of sanctions quickly decried the South
African lobbying effort as an improper foreign intru
sion into the U.S. legislative process and criticized
conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) for his role in
arranging the calls.
"I believe that all Americans and especially Ameri
can farmers will condemn foreign bribery and in
timidation to change a vote in the United States Sen
ate," declared Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "It is an
affront to the decency of the American people."
It is not known whether the effort had the support
of the Reagan administration.
Botha made the call to Sen. Edward Zorinsky CD-
Neb.) and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) as the
Republican-controlled Senate prepared to vote to
morrow on whether to override President Reagan's
veto of the sanctions package. Supporters of the sanc
tions package were believed to already have the ne

cessary two-thirds majority needed to enact the legis
lation over the objections of Reagan.
Meanwhile, South African President Pieter Botha
vowed that racial segregation of South Africa's resi
dential areas will continue as long as he is president.
Botha defended segregation in residential areas as
the cornerstone of his government's policies and the
basis for any further reforms.
"You will have to get rid of me first before you get
rid of this principle," he told the annual Cape provin
cial congress of his National Party in the port city of
East London.
He added, however, that his government was will
ing to allow greater flexibility in the enforcement of
residential segregation by opening a few urban areas
to all races and granting permits to individual blacks,
Indians and "coloreds," or people of mixed-race, to
move into some upper-class white suburbs.
"It is strange that we are prepared to travel in a car
with a colored, and allow him to ride on our bakkie
(pickup truck) on the farm," Botha said, "but when
he wants to live close to you then there is trouble. We
must try to keep our sense of proportion in this mat
ter."
But he emphasized the strict limits on his

flexibility, saying: "We cannot agree that the principle
of (a racial group's) own residential area be
destroyed. It is the cornerstone of our minority pop-'
ulation policy."
While he is willing to permit blacks, coloreds and
Indians to move into exclusive suburbs now
: reserved for whites, he will not permit them to move
into working-class white neighborhoods, where
opinion polls show resistance to racial integration is
strongest.
"I am pleading for the poor when I plead for the
retention of community life," Botha said, arguing that
poor whites would be pushed out and become "slum
F dwellers" if their neighborhoods were opened to all
the races.
He also said that he favored ending what racial
segregation remains in public facilities, saying that he
has never believed that the 1953 Separate Amenities
Act is practical.
In the past year, most of South Africa s restaurants,
bars and hotels have been opened to all races, but
other facilities, ranging from public toilets in some
cities to buses and libraries and town halls, continue
to be segregated or closed to blacks.
