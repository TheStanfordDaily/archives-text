### FELICIA PAIK Editorial staff 
With the appointment of two new residential deans for
the 19H6-H" seh(X)l year, every student — whether living on
or off campus — is affiliated with a residential dean.
Chris Griffith is the new dean for undergraduates in Man
zanita Hark and for graduate students in Crothers and Croth
ers Memorial. Juan Yniguez is the new dean tor Stern and
Wilbur halls. Yniguez also will serve as an advisor lor
Chicano students.
The role of Griffith, Yniguez and the five other residential
deans is to provide direct assistance and consultation for
students with academic and personal difficulties.
Instituted last year, this system is a change in structure, ac
cording to Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Residential Edu
cation and director of the Row.
Several years ago, three counseling deans working out of
a central office were available to students, according to Con
klin.
"We soon realized there was a need to put the people
(the deans) into the residential neighborhood, so the stu
dents could have easier access. Now, it's like having a local
office to the Dean of Student Affairs Office," she said.

"We have expanded in number so that all students,
housed and unhoused, could have access. I'sage (of deans)
is very heavy," Conklin said.
"This position (of residential dean) helps students iden
tify with one person in a geographic area," Yniguez said.
According to Yniguez, his role as advisor to Chicano stu
dents is by "no means exclusive but may lie helpful when
appropriate.
Prior to my coming on board, there was no Latino or
Chicano in my position. I hope to smooth over any cultural
differences that may arise," Yniguez said.
Yniguez plans to lie visible in his role as dean.
"By the end of the quarter 1 hope everyone (in Stern and
Wilbur) will know who I am, if not personally, at least know
my name and role in the residences," lit* said.
Griffith compared her role to that of a residential fellow.
"The residential fellow provides the educational focus of
the dorm. He is there to develop programs in the dorms
which are extensions of academic learning," Griffith said.
"But, his time is limited since he is a faculty member. The
focus is usually on the area of expertise of the residential
fellow," she said.
Her role, however, is to provide assistance for students
whose problems are not necessarily academic, she said.
