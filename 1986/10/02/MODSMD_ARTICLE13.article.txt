# Type-A's wanted

### 
Due to a Bay Area-wide shortage
of type-A positive blood, the Stan
ford Blood Center is asking all indi
viduals with this type of blood to
donate at the Bloodmobile, which
will be parked in White Plaza from
12-4 p.m. today.
According to Roger Svoboda, ad
ministrator of the Blood Center, the
situation, while not yet critical, has
been getting "progressively worse
over the last week or so."

The center has had to go outside
the local area recently in an effort to
maintain supplies of the blood type,
and Svoboda said this prompted the
center to try to gather the much
needed blood.
Any student who cannot make it
to the Blood Center this afternoon
can go to the Blood Donor Center,
located on 800 Welch Road, near
the Stanford Barn. The center can
be reached by taking Marguerite.
