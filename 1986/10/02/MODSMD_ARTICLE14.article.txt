Clearly, the use of drugs in college athletics is a prob
lem. The untimely death of University of Maryland bas
ketball star Len Bias is a frightening reminder that drug
use has become an all-too-common habit among college
athletes.
However, the NCAA's solution to the prevalence of
drugs on America's college campuses is hypocritical, un
fair and possibly unconstitutional. What's more, it's
blatantly self-serving.
The NCAA requires only athletes on teams that have
qualified for post-season play to submit to drug testing. If
a player tests positive for drug use, he or she would not
be able to compete for at least 90 days after the test, and
there is even the possibility that an entire team could
become ineligible as a result of one player's actions.
The NCAA isn't concerned about the college athlete —
it's only concerned about the college athlete who plays
for a good team. Apparently, the drug problem among
some of the less successful college teams is of no interest
to the NCAA. If the NCAA were truly committed to fight
ing drugs in college athletics, it would institute random,

across-the-board drug testing for all member schools.
However, the overall policy of testing college athletes
for drugs is a bad one. Not only does drug testing
seriously damage the integrity and spirit of amateur ath
letics, but it violates the freedom of the individual as
well. Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons' assessment of
the NCAA policy as "probably unconstitutional and a bad
response" is an accurate one.
But perhaps most disturbing in all of this is the fact
that its policy shows the NCAA is mainly concerned with
one thing: itself. It is not surprising that the NCAA chose
to enforce its drug policy only in post-season play. After
all, who administers most post-season tournaments? And
doesn't the NCAA have its image on the line in the Final
Four, at least as much as the teams playing the games?
The solution to this problem is not easy. The NCAA
should develop an education program and bring it into
college locker rooms. The student-athlete with an ad
mitted drug problem should be offered entry into a free,
anonymous rehabilitation program — not a seat on the
bench. Granted, implementing such programs would be
costly and complicated. But it would also be courageous.
