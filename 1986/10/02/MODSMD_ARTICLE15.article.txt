Chevron boycott
would pit U.S.
against Angolans
Don't believe everything you read
on a Stanford kiosk. The posters that
appeared last week saying "Free
Angola — Boycott Chevron" were
seemimgly an appeal to students who
oppose the oppression of black
Africans. In fact, however, this boycott
was originated by the ultra-right
American Republic Foundation to
punish Chevron for doing business in
Angola and to bolster the Reagan
administration's support for guerrillas
fighting the Angolan government.
Chevron, formerly Gulf Oil, operates
an oil installation in Cabinda province
jointly with the Angolan government.
Since early this year, the United
States has been sending arms and
supplies to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA
(National Union for the Total Inde
pendence of Angola) forces, which
until then had been almost entirely
backed by South Africa. South Africa
also launches devastating air attacks
against Angola and periodically sends
its own troops in to support Savimbi.
There are good reasons why South
Africa is attempting to undermine the
Angolan government. A prosperous,
independent Angola would set a bad
example for Namibians and black
South Africans who seek their own
freedom. And control of Angola would
give South Africa free access to the
rich oil deposits that it needs to bol
ster its economy. In helping UNITA,
the United States is making common
cause with the apartheid regime.
The government of Angola, which is
recognized by every major nation
except the United States and South
Africa, is admittedly Marxist. But it
encourages private agriculture and a
free market and has constantly sought
better relations with the United States.
American firms do more than $1
billion a year in business with the
Angolans.
The Reagan administration supports
UNITA as part of its effort to challenge
the Soviet Union in "low intensity

conflicts" all over the Third World,
including Cambodia, Afghanistan and
Central America. The Soviets do pro
vide aid to Angola and will undoubt
edly increase the amount as U.S.
involvement escalates. There are also
about 25,000 Cuban troops in Angola.
They were invited in by the govern
ment shortly after Angola achieved
independence from Portugal when a
massive invasion by South Africa was
threatening the capital city of Luanda.
Angola has repeatedly pledged to
send the Cubans home once South
Africa ends its cross-border attacks
and gives up its illegal occupation of
neighboring Namibia.
Meanwhile, the Angolan people are
destined to become victims of the
Reagan administration's simplistic
view of the entire world as an arena
for East/West conflict. The guerrilla
war we now support has caused
widespread famine, devastation and
death, as Savimbi's forces systemati
cally plant mines in productive farm
ing areas, raid villages and massacre
their inhabitants with knives and
machetes, and attack civilian aircraft
carrying vital supplies.
There is no chance for a UNITA
victory, only protracted war. As long
as it continues, the United States will
be regarded throughout black Africa
— and the world — as an ally of
South Africa in promoting ruthless
terrorism against an independent
African nation. Boycotting companies
that do business in Angola will not
"free Angola" but only support the
effort to destroy it.

Class schedules
should be changed
I am confident that all of the fresh
men (and women) will join me in
thanking the whole orientation staff
for their wonderful work. Whether
they are orientation volunteers, resi
dent fellows, academic advisers or
resident assistants, their time, their
patience and their friendliness have
tremendously helped our smooth
introduction to Stanford.

Having started our trek so well, we
were somewhat surprised when we
discovered that the first feat of arms
we were expected to accomplish here
was to work out a schedule which
does not require us to be at two
different places at the same time.
Although I do realize that the
publicaton of the Time Schedule must
be the consecration of tedious work
on behalf of the administration — and I
do keep in mind that, if criticism is
easy, art is difficult — I venture to voice
the following suggestions.
• Could the Western Culture and
Freshman English classes be at com
pletely different time slots than are
most introductory lectures? This
would already considerably alleviate
the schedule conflicts most freshmen
struggle against.
• Could there be more sections of
popular classes? It is surprising to
notice that there is only one section of
Psychology 1 and Economics 1 but
two 0f... the introductory course to
petroleum engineering.
I believe minor changes could help
solve major problems faced every
quarter by a substantial part of the
student body and add serenity to a
year that promises to be challenging
and rewarding for all of us.
