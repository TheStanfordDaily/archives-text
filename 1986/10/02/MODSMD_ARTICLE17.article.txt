# Stanford harbors liberalism
## 
### 
Welcome. It is good to be here with you among the roll
ing foothills and beautiful environs. You are entering as
Stanford celebrates 100 years as a leader in education. You
are a part of why we celebrate, and, of course, I congratulate
you, the members of the class of 1990, who have been
invited to test your spirit here on the Farm. By any measure,
that is an important and notable achievement.
However, 1 do not intend to give here today the usual sort
of address to a freshman class — pointing with pride,
viewing with concern and ending with hortatory peroration
inviting you to play a leading role in this university or in the
salvation of mankind.
The truth of the matter is that you will not be equipped to
do so.
Nor will I insult your intelligence by telling you that you
are the brightest and best-educated class ever to enter the
Quad. Almost certainly, though you can point to growing so
phistication in the natural and social sciences, the graduat
ing class of 1909 had sounder instruction in history, in lan
guages, in the long tradition of western literature and phil
osophy, in economics and in serious ethical reflection than
most of you will receive after four years on this horse ranch.
And think of this horse ranch. Think of economics not as a
dismal but as a luminous science. Look about you at the
buildings here before us, the residence halls, the vast libra
ries. The lecture rooms populated by the ghosts of the

BRENDAN KELLY

generations who came before you. Reflect upon the fact that
all of this — beauty, utility and aspiration all fused — was
created in its physical aspect by the fortunes of great Ameri
can entrepreneurs. It was owing to their economic creativity
that Stanford and the other great private institutions of
higher learning grew up on these shores. They did not ask
permission. All of this spread before you was not created by
the Department of Education, was not created even by the
New Deal and die New Frontier, but by the men who built
railroads, made steel, drilled for oil, mastered banking or
sent ships trading across the seven seas.
And yet — I ask you this not at all rhetorically — is it not
striking that the climate of economic opinion among the
majority here is undoubtedly socialist, whether of the hard
or soft variety? You will find that our American heroes on
this campus, to the extent we have any, are those who
moved things in a so< .alist direction, and this against all the
evidence history presents about socialist performance.
You'll find our heroes are not those past and present who
liberated human economic energies. Our heroes are
people like the Kennedys, the benign American socialists;
and Daniel Ortega, the not so benign Nicaraguan socialist;
and Nelson Mandela (of Mandela-free University), who
would clamp South Africa in a Socialist vise if he were free
to do so. Solzhenitsyn spoke here a few years ago, but he
returned home afterward while the socialist tropism
remains.
Which brings us logically enough to the hospitality of this
University to what can only be called junk thought. To be
truthful, I have not been around the world, but I've been
away from here for one-and-a-half years. I spoke often to all
sorts of folks, and I have found this campus to be a greater
bastion of conformity than any small town in Australia or
Japan. Alice Springs, Aomori and Aberdeen were centers of
wild and unfettered speculation compared with our institu
tion of higher learning. There is a wider difference of

opinion in a Marine Corps regiment or Baptist tent meeting
than there is today at Stanford.
1 ask: Who among us today would dare say that
homosexuality is a perversion? No one, even though The
New York Times called it such as recently as 20 years ago.
How rapidly the Zeitgeist ventriloquizes. And how many
advocate aid to the contras or the Afghans? Who would aver
that there is no quick and obvious remedy for the ills of
South Africa? Who favors SDI? Who among us would not
rather give an honorary degree to Helen Caldicott or Alan
Cranston than to Jeane Kirkpatrick or Ronald Reagan? The
answer is: not many of us. This American academy
produces a herd of independent minds, who graze like
sheep on liberal fodder.
It is not a Sahara of the intellect; mind does exist. But you
will have to work for it, and don't be quick to label ideas and
reject thought by simplistic deduction. A healthy respect for
contrary ideas is key to achievement here, and my gripe is
not the presence of the afore-mentioned liberal fodder but
its suffocating abundance.
I'd like to finish with some genuine thought in the form
of a quotation from R.W. Emerson's "Self-Reliance:"
"Else tomorrow a stranger will say with masterly good

sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time,
and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion
from another."
You'll find many here anxious to pass on their opinion
and, quite self-defensively, that is why we have gathered, to
hear and be heard.
Invoke mind, principle, belief, religion or whatever else
may be required to sustain perspective for your time here.
Think about that. Think about it both historically and analyti
cally. If you do you will not at all arrive at the same answers,
but you will be in the company of those concerned with
boii> to know rather than what to know. It is then you will
see the magic of this place and its reason for inviting you
here.

neering.

Welcome. It is good to be here with you among the roll
ing foothills and beautiful environs. You are entering as
Stanford celebrates 100 years as a leader in education. You
are a part of why we celebrate, and, of course, I congratulate
you, the members of the class of 1990, who have been
invited to test your spirit here on the Farm. By any measure,
that is an important and notable achievement.
However, 1 do not intend to give here today the usual sort
of address to a freshman class — pointing with pride,
viewing with concern and ending with hortatory peroration
inviting you to play a leading role in this university or in the
salvation of mankind.
The truth of the matter is that you will not be equipped to
do so.
Nor will I insult your intelligence by telling you that you
are the brightest and best-educated class ever to enter the
Quad. Almost certainly, though you can point to growing so
phistication in the natural and social sciences, the graduat
ing class of 1909 had sounder instruction in history, in lan
guages, in the long tradition of western literature and phil
osophy, in economics and in serious ethical reflection than
most of you will receive after four years on this horse ranch.
And think of this horse ranch. Think of economics not as a
dismal but as a luminous science. Look about you at the
buildings here before us, the residence halls, the vast libra
ries. The lecture rooms populated by the ghosts of the

BRENDAN KELLY

generations who came before you. Reflect upon the fact that
all of this — beauty, utility and aspiration all fused — was
created in its physical aspect by the fortunes of great Ameri
can entrepreneurs. It was owing to their economic creativity
that Stanford and the other great private institutions of
higher learning grew up on these shores. They did not ask
permission. All of this spread before you was not created by
the Department of Education, was not created even by the
New Deal and die New Frontier, but by the men who built
railroads, made steel, drilled for oil, mastered banking or
sent ships trading across the seven seas.
And yet — I ask you this not at all rhetorically — is it not
striking that the climate of economic opinion among the
majority here is undoubtedly socialist, whether of the hard
or soft variety? You will find that our American heroes on
this campus, to the extent we have any, are those who
moved things in a so< .alist direction, and this against all the
evidence history presents about socialist performance.
You'll find our heroes are not those past and present who
liberated human economic energies. Our heroes are
people like the Kennedys, the benign American socialists;
and Daniel Ortega, the not so benign Nicaraguan socialist;
and Nelson Mandela (of Mandela-free University), who
would clamp South Africa in a Socialist vise if he were free
to do so. Solzhenitsyn spoke here a few years ago, but he
returned home afterward while the socialist tropism
remains.
Which brings us logically enough to the hospitality of this
University to what can only be called junk thought. To be
truthful, I have not been around the world, but I've been
away from here for one-and-a-half years. I spoke often to all
sorts of folks, and I have found this campus to be a greater
bastion of conformity than any small town in Australia or
Japan. Alice Springs, Aomori and Aberdeen were centers of
wild and unfettered speculation compared with our institu
tion of higher learning. There is a wider difference of

opinion in a Marine Corps regiment or Baptist tent meeting
than there is today at Stanford.
1 ask: Who among us today would dare say that
homosexuality is a perversion? No one, even though The
New York Times called it such as recently as 20 years ago.
How rapidly the Zeitgeist ventriloquizes. And how many
advocate aid to the contras or the Afghans? Who would aver
that there is no quick and obvious remedy for the ills of
South Africa? Who favors SDI? Who among us would not
rather give an honorary degree to Helen Caldicott or Alan
Cranston than to Jeane Kirkpatrick or Ronald Reagan? The
answer is: not many of us. This American academy
produces a herd of independent minds, who graze like
sheep on liberal fodder.
It is not a Sahara of the intellect; mind does exist. But you
will have to work for it, and don't be quick to label ideas and
reject thought by simplistic deduction. A healthy respect for
contrary ideas is key to achievement here, and my gripe is
not the presence of the afore-mentioned liberal fodder but
its suffocating abundance.
I'd like to finish with some genuine thought in the form
of a quotation from R.W. Emerson's "Self-Reliance:"
"Else tomorrow a stranger will say with masterly good

sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time,
and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion
from another."
You'll find many here anxious to pass on their opinion
and, quite self-defensively, that is why we have gathered, to
hear and be heard.
Invoke mind, principle, belief, religion or whatever else
may be required to sustain perspective for your time here.
Think about that. Think about it both historically and analyti
cally. If you do you will not at all arrive at the same answers,
but you will be in the company of those concerned with
boii> to know rather than what to know. It is then you will
see the magic of this place and its reason for inviting you
here.
