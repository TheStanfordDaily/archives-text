Stanford is retaining 30,600 shares of
Diamond Shamrock Corp. stock due to
the company's pending salt' of its
South African subsidiary.
Last spring, the Board of Trustees
voted to sell the University's stock in
the company if it had not sold its South
African subsidiary, Diamond Shamrock
Africa, Ltd., by Oct. 1.
Although Diamond Shamrock still
owns its subsidiary, Stanford has not
divested of the stock because it ap
pears that a sale is in progress, said
Diana Diamond, a staff member for the
Trustees' Special Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility.
Diamond Shamrock Corp. notified
the University in mid-September that a
South African company has agreed to
purchase Diamond Shamrock's
Simonstown facility, but has since said
that ownership will not be transferred
for another two to three weeks. Dia
mond said the two companies still
have to resolve legal and fiancial
minutiae.
Diamond said the Trustees will
reconsider the Diamond Shamrock
issue at their Oct. 14 meeting.
The oil and gas company employs
s'x non-whifes and rhree whites at its
Simonstown facility, which is located
outside Cape Town on South Africa's
western coast.
A secretary in the company's Dallas,
Texas, headquarters said that
"continuous defense of our fine record
(on race relations) was not justified by
the size of our (Simonstown) opera
tion."
The secretary, who works in the
company's public relations depart
ment, cited figures that said the facility
represented .000027 percent of Sham
rock's total assets as of Dec. 31, 1985.
She said several large investors, such
as Stanford and some pension funds,
had kept her office busy with requests
for information about Diamond Sham
rock's South African operations.
The University owned 30,600 shares
in the Dallas, Texas, oil and gas com
pany as of Sept. 9. Those shares were
worth $332,928 at the close of yester
day's trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Diamond Shamrock Chairman
William Bricker first announced in
April that the plant would be sold.
Last spring, the trustees said the Dia
mond Shamrock decision was a result
of their overall policy of selective di
vestment. "Total divestment might give
us a moment of satisfaction, but the
morning after we would have lost all of
our leverage in South Africa," Board
President Warren Christopher said at
the time.
