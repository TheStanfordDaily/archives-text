## Survive dorm food: Indulge at Stuft Pizza

Stuft Pizza Bar and Grill
191 Castro St.
Mountain View
To survive college cafeteria food, one occasionally needs
to break away and order a pizza. For years, Stanford stu
dents have relied on the services of Domino's to satisfy their
late night cravings. Others with more energy (and a car)
venture into Palo Alto and order pizza at Ramona's. But
those who are serious pizza lovers should try Stuft Pizza Bar
and Grill in Mountain View.
According to its menu, Stuft Pizza has two origins, each
equally important in contributing to the uniqueness and
quality of the restaurant.
The restaurant is housed in a completely restored build
ing, once owned by Jake Mockabee, a local entrepreneur. In
1887, Mockabee purchased the corner of Castro and Villa
streets for $650. The corner lot has housed several busi
nesses: a blacksmith shop, a hardware company and now
Stuft Pizza.
Stuft Pizza management claims the second contribution is

the origin and evolution of pizza. It was created in Naples
and eventually came to the United States via immigrants.
The restaurant is split-level with seating on the first and
third floors. The second floor consists of the entry, the
mahogany bar and the take-out window. The design is neat
and simple with lots of wood paneling. At lunch and dinner
the restaurant is filled with the young working crowd and
families.
The Stuft Pizza menu includes calzoni, hamburgers, sand
wiches, soups and salads. It also has complete cocktail ser
vice.
I have eaten at the restaurant three times. Each time I
have had the "Stuft Special — Old Castro Street's Finest'
($11.25) which includes pepperoni, Italian sausage, mush
room, red onion, bell pepper and tomato. Every time the
pizza has been good. The vegetables are freshly cut, and the
crust is not too thick. The pizza consists predominantly of
toppings, as it should, and the toppings and cheese do not
fall off the pizza dough.
I have also had the dinner salad ($2.25) which was lacking
in die "seasonally available garden vegetables," as all that
was served were tomatoes and garbanzo beans.
Prices are moderate. A medium pizza ranges in price
from $8-12.
