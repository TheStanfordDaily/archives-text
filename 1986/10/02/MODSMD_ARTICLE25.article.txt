## Stanford football: really that good? 
### 
O.K. So the Stanford football team is ranked
No. 20 by United Press International. So the Card
inal has won its first three games, including a 31-
20 victory over perennial Southwest Conference
power Texas. So the defense came within a blown

call of recording its first shutout in 126 games.
"Yeah, but," you ask, "are they really that
good?"
Sure, you remember 1983, when the Cardinal
was picked to do as well as 7-4. They finished 1-
10. And you remember 1984: 5-6. 1985: 4-7.
No. 20, yeah. Just like last year when Indiana
opened 4-0 to earn a No. 19 ranking and
proceeded to finish 4-7.
You remember your freshman year when your
RA talked you into buying season tickets. Midway
through, you were giving them to your roommate
to sell to the scalpers. You told him to keep the
dollar.
So, you want to know, are these guys for real?
Well, don't make plans for Pasadena on New

Year's Day now. But if you want to see a bowl
game in person, don't make the plane reserva
tions home just yet.
There are five teams in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence ranked ahead of the Cardinal — USC, Wash
ington, UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State. All with
the exception of ASU are on the Stanford
schedule. That means four games the Cardinal
should (not necessarily will) lose.
Conversely, the Cardinal should win the other
four games on its schedule. So, the Cardinal
should finish 7-4, which is in all likelihood bowl
material.
But fate has not been kind to the Cardinal with
regard to "shoulds." Four years ago, Stanford was
5-5, had upset Washington and Ohio State and
was staring a bid to the Hall of Fame Bowl
squarely in the eyes. All that was left was winning
Big Game. Mark Harmon's field goal with four
seconds left had given Stanford a 20-19 victory
following a classic John F.lway drive down the
field in the game's final two minutes.
Then came The Play. Cal won 25-20. Stanford
stayed home.
Those should-wins aren't automatic. San Diego
State may be minus Todd Santos, but Jim Plum
has worthy credentials and the Aztecs' offense is a
force to be reckoned with. Preseason last-place

If leading Cardinal receiver Jeff James is unable to play again this week because of the injured foot he suffered against San Jose State,
Stanford will rely on senior Thomas Henley (20), who was switched from running back to receiver during spring drills.

pick Washington State merely
managed a tie with Arizona State last
week. The rain in Oregon always
makes things interesting. And Big
Game? When's the last time records
meant anything?
Conversely, though, upsets are a
Stanford tradition. In 1982, Washington
came into Stanford Stadium the No. 1
team in the nation. The Huskies left 43-
31 losers. The Cardinal went down to

UCLA two years ago with starting quar
terback John Paye on the sidelines and
came away with a 23-21 win. Even in
the misery of that 1983 season, No. 19
Arizona played the winless Cardinal —
and Stanford came out ahead 31-22 for
the only win in that 1-10 campaign.
"Great," you say. "So they might go
to the Rose Bowl or they might go 3-8.
Should I bother going to the games, or
should I plan to catch up on my
reading on the weekends? Are they
good?"
Yes, they are good. How good, we
have yet to see. Texas is nowhere near
the top 20 this year, and San Jose State

and Oregon State never have been.
That does mean, though, that the Card
inal has passed the first test of a good
football team; they've beaten the teams
they should.
San Diego State is a team the Card
inal should beat. If they don't, kiss the
top 20 goodbye. If they do, the ques
tion will still remain: Is Stanford really
a top 20 team?
The following week Washington
comes to town. The same Washington
that blasted Ohio State and Brigham
Young on successive weekends.
Talk to me in two weeks. That's
when we'll know.

10. And you remember 1984: 5-6. 1985: 4-7.
No. 20, yeah. Just like last year when Indiana
opened 4-0 to earn a No. 19 ranking and
proceeded to finish 4-7.
You remember your freshman year when your
RA talked you into buying season tickets. Midway
through, you were giving them to your roommate
to sell to the scalpers. You told him to keep the
dollar.
So, you want to know, are these guys for real?
Well, don't make plans for Pasadena on New

Year's Day now. But if you want to see a bowl
game in person, don't make the plane reserva
tions home just yet.
There are five teams in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence ranked ahead of the Cardinal — USC, Wash
ington, UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State. All with
the exception of ASU are on the Stanford
schedule. That means four games the Cardinal
should (not necessarily will) lose.
Conversely, the Cardinal should win the other
four games on its schedule. So, the Cardinal
should finish 7-4, which is in all likelihood bowl
material.
But fate has not been kind to the Cardinal with
regard to "shoulds." Four years ago, Stanford was
5-5, had upset Washington and Ohio State and
was staring a bid to the Hall of Fame Bowl
squarely in the eyes. All that was left was winning
Big Game. Mark Harmon's field goal with four
seconds left had given Stanford a 20-19 victory
following a classic John F.lway drive down the
field in the game's final two minutes.
Then came The Play. Cal won 25-20. Stanford
stayed home.
Those should-wins aren't automatic. San Diego
State may be minus Todd Santos, but Jim Plum
has worthy credentials and the Aztecs' offense is a
force to be reckoned with. Preseason last-place

If leading Cardinal receiver Jeff James is unable to play again this week because of the injured foot he suffered against San Jose State,
Stanford will rely on senior Thomas Henley (20), who was switched from running back to receiver during spring drills.

pick Washington State merely
managed a tie with Arizona State last
week. The rain in Oregon always
makes things interesting. And Big
Game? When's the last time records
meant anything?
Conversely, though, upsets are a
Stanford tradition. In 1982, Washington
came into Stanford Stadium the No. 1
team in the nation. The Huskies left 43-
31 losers. The Cardinal went down to

UCLA two years ago with starting quar
terback John Paye on the sidelines and
came away with a 23-21 win. Even in
the misery of that 1983 season, No. 19
Arizona played the winless Cardinal —
and Stanford came out ahead 31-22 for
the only win in that 1-10 campaign.
"Great," you say. "So they might go
to the Rose Bowl or they might go 3-8.
Should I bother going to the games, or
should I plan to catch up on my
reading on the weekends? Are they
good?"
Yes, they are good. How good, we
have yet to see. Texas is nowhere near
the top 20 this year, and San Jose State

and Oregon State never have been.
That does mean, though, that the Card
inal has passed the first test of a good
football team; they've beaten the teams
they should.
San Diego State is a team the Card
inal should beat. If they don't, kiss the
top 20 goodbye. If they do, the ques
tion will still remain: Is Stanford really
a top 20 team?
The following week Washington
comes to town. The same Washington
that blasted Ohio State and Brigham
Young on successive weekends.
Talk to me in two weeks. That's
when we'll know.
