# Top-ranked Miami gets breather after big win
## 
### 
When Tulsa defeated Houston 24-14 last Saturday it
marked the 18th anniversary of a memorable game.
Back in 1968, Houston routed — to put it mildly —
Tulsa by a score of 100-6, the most points ever scored
against a major-college team.
What brought that game to mind are two games on this
week's schedule in which the 100-point mark probably
could be threatened if the coaches so desired.
Northern Illinois, 0-5, visits No. 1-ranked Miami and
there is no point spread. Last week, Northern Illinois lost
to Division I-AA Western Illinois 10-0. Earlier, Western Il
linois lost to Kansas State 35-7, which lost to Division 1-
AA Northern lowa 17-0, which was tied by Division II
Mankato State 16-16, which lost to Division II North
Dakota State 48-0 — you get the picture.
"There's no easy answer," Northern Illinois Coach
Jerry Pettibone said. "Miami definitely has a great chance
to win the national championship. They'll play Penn State

in the Orange Bowl for the national title; that's my
prediction.
"All we can do is go down there and just play as well as
we can. The best thing for me to do is call (Miami Coach)
Jimmy Johnson and plead my case."
Don't worry, Jerry. Johnson remembers the good old
days when you coached together on the same Oklahoma
staff in the early 1970s ... Miami 63-0.
The other likely blowout finds Oklahoma, smarting
after last week's 28-16 loss to Miami and subsequent fall
from first place to sixth in the Associated Press poll, a 51-
point favorite at home against Kansas State.
The series stands at 56-11-4 and Oklahoma owns an
NCAA-record 32 consecutive victories over Kansas State
(1937-68).
K-State will come out throwing, but the Wildcats don't
have a Vinny Testaverde .Oklahoma 63-14.
