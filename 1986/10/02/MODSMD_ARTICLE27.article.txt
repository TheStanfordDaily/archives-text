# Boston ace bruises elbow with playoffs week away
## 
### 
BOSTON â€” The Boston Red Sox
had their playoff hopes jolted last
night when 24-game winner Roger
Clemens was hit on the elbow by a line
drive in an 11-7 victory over the Bal
timore Orioles.
Clemens, named earlier to start
against California in the American
League Championship Series' opener
here Tuesday, was hit on the right el
bow by a drive off the bat of Bal
timore's John Stefero in the second in
ning.
After the ball ricocheted over
second baseman Mart) 1 Barrett's head
for an RBI single, Clemens grabbed his
elbow and was escorted immediately
Itito the clubhouse for an examination
by Dr. Arthur Pappas, the Boston club
physician.

He was then taken to a nearby hospi
tal, where Pappas reported that X-rays
disclosed no broken bones. He said
that Clemens suffered a bruised elbow
and his status is "day-to-day."
Pappas said he expected Clemens to
be pitching "in the early playoffs," and
the Red Sox made no immediate plans
to change their pitching strategy.
"X-rays showed no bone damage
other than a bruise and now we just
have to wait until tomorrow to see how
much swelling and discomfort there
is," Pappas said.
"The ball hit just above the elbow on
the outside and there doesn't appear to
be any muscle damage," the doctor
added. "We just have to wait. We're not
talking a matter of weeks, we're talking
a matter of days."

"It was very scary," Boston Manager
John McNamara said. "It was a very
anxious time when he went to the
hospital."
In his final regular-season appear
ance before the playoffs, Clemens, 24-
4, was foiled in his bid to become Bos
ton's first 25-game winner since Mel
Parnell in 1949.
The Red Sox, who had 17 hits, took a
4-0 lead in the first on an RBI single by
Jim Rice, a run-scoring double by Don
Baylor, a sacrifice fly by Dwight Evans
and an RBI infield hit by Tony Armas.
Tim Lollar replaced Clemens after
Stefero's hit and gave the Orioles a run
in the second.
Rich Gedman drove in another run
in the Boston second before Cal Rip
ken hit his 24th homer for Baltimore in
the third.
Boston's Ed Romero hit his second
homer of the season in the fourth
before the Orioles tied the score 6-6
with four runs in the fifth. Eddie Mur
ray, who had three hits, singled home
one run. Mike Young had a two-run

double and another run came across
on a wiM pitch
Rob Woodward, 2-3, who replaced
Lollar in the fifth, was the winner. Tony
Arnold, the second of four Baltimore
pitchers, was the loser in his first major
league decision.
Wade Boggs went l-for-4, with an in
tentional walk in the decisive eighth,
dropping his average one point to a
league-leading .357. Don Mattingly of
the New York Yankees went 2-for-4,
raising his average to .350.
