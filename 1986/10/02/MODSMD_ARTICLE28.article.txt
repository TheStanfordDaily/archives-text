# Stanford outshoots SJSU, loses anyway
## Hat trick drops Card to 2-4-1 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
As the old saying goes, close only counts in
hand grenades and horseshoes. In field hockey,
close doesn't quite make it.
The Stanford field hockey team was often close
against San Jose State yesterday, outshooting the
Spartans 23-8, but the Cardinal still suffered a 3-1
defeat in the Northern Pacific Conference contest
in San Jose.
The loss dropped Stanford to 0-1-1 in the Nor-
Pac and to 2-4-1 overall. San Jose State is now 2-2
in the conference and 2-2-1 overall.
Stanford goalkeeper Karen Jones had trouble
with only one Spartan, but that one did the trick

— a hat trick to be exact. San Jose State's Sheryl
Sorg scored all three of the Spartans' goals.
Sorg has been the Spartan offense so far this
season. In five games, San Jose State has seven
goals — all by Sorg.
Sorg's goals came in the ninth, 12th and 42nd
minutes. Laura Gartland put the Cardinal on the
board with a goal in the 67th minute, but Stanford
was unable to beat San Jose State goalkeeper Jill
Jacobson again. Jacobson had nine saves in the
game.
Stanford faces another NorPac opponent on
Saturday when it hosts the University of the
Pacific. Last year the Cardinal beat the Tigers 2-1

Despite 28 shots on goal, the field hockey team still lost yesterday's match against San Jose State, 3-1.
in the midst of a nine-game winning
streak that propelled it to the NorPac
title and a berth in the NCAA playoffs,
where it lost 3-0 to lowa. Two of the
wins in that streak came against San
Jose State.
If the Cardinal is to reach the NCAAs
this year, it will need to begin a similar
streak soon. Stanford has already lost
as many games as it did all all last
season, when it finished 10-4-1.
