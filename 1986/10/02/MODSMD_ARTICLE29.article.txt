# New medical lab to open this week
## 
### 
A new state-of-the-art laboratory
for research in magnetic resonance
imaging will be dedicated at Stan
ford University Medical Center to
morrow in honor of the late Felix
Bloch, Stanford's first Nobel
laureate.
Bloch, who was a physics profes
sor at Stanford from 1934 until his
death in 1983, shared the Nobel
Prize in 1952 with Edward Purcell
for inventing the fundamental
method used in the magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) process.
MRI is thought to be one of the
most important advances in diag
nostic medical imaging since the X
ray was introduced.
The laboratory, to be called the
Felix Bloch Laboratory for Research
in Magnetic Resonance Imaging and

housed in the Department of Diag
nostic Radiology and Nuclear
Medicine, provides a much-needed
MRI facility within the medical
school that can be devoted exclu
sively to MRI research, according to
department chairman Dr. Ronald
Castellino.
The lab is equipped with a
Resonex MRI scanner, an innovative
new machine with great flexibility
for imaging research, said Dr. Leslie
Zatz, professor of radiology who
has been appointed the new labora
tory's director by Castellino.
The laboratory will serve as a
clinical research facility to explore
new applications of MRI medicine.
The imaging technique can also be
a useful new tool for other areas of
research, Zatz said.
