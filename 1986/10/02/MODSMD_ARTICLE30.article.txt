Bankers and poets at Biz School
Among the new students enrolling at the Stanford
Business School, which begins instruction today, are
a post office manager, two fighter pilots, a French
brandy maker and a professional hockey player.
"This year's class is a really outstanding mix of
people with great academic skills and fascinating
backgrounds," said Wayne Forester, the outgoing
director of admissions, who waded through more
than 3,800 applicants in choosing the entering class.
Among the 318 first-year students are 49 consul
tants, 56 students who worked in investment banking
after getting their undergraduate degrees and the
president of a steel company.
"There is even one member of a motorcycle
gang," Forester said. "But he was the leader."
Students also include a minister and a rabbinical
student, a California wine maker and a producer of
films for major league baseball.
Some applicants gave very straightforward reasons
for desiring to attend business schoo' One said he
"always wanted to play on the Stanford golf course.
A few applicants, however, were not as brief and sub
mitted 100-page essays to support their cases.
Among the class of 1988, 12.2 percent are
minorities and 24.5 percent are women. The average
age is 26.8 years, but the age range is from 21 to 47,
including 12.9 percent who are 30 or over. Students
came from 36 states and 14 countries.
Huntington's disease advance
Stanford Medical School scientists have identified
a protein on brain cells that may be involved in the
development of Huntington's disease, they reported

in an article to appear in the Oct. 3 issue of the jour
nal Science.
The finding opens up new avenues of research
toward finding a drug that may be able to slow or halt
the disease, a rare but significant hereditary condi
tion thought to affect approximately one in 20,000 in
dividuals, said Dr. Dennis Choi, the Stanford assistant
professor of neurology who led the study.
The protein is a receptor found on the surface of
certain brain cells, including those known to
degenerate in patients with Huntington's disease Al
though the receptor protein itself probably does not
cause the disease, the scientists believe that it may be
the docking point for chemicals that ultimately cause
the cell to destruct.
Choi cautioned that while the new research holds
much promise, the therapeutic implications of the
discovery do not represent a breakthrough or a new
treatment for Huntington's disease.
"We know there are drugs that can specifically
block these damaging chemicals from docking, hut
we re quite a way from testing humans," he said.
According to Choi, the finding confirms previous
theories while moving researchers a step closer
toward understanding at the molecular level what
causes the brain cell death seen in the disease.
But the finding will certainly be of great interest
because Huntington's disease is representative of a
group of degenerative brain diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and others,
which as a class constitute the fourth leading cause of
death in the United States, according to Choi.
Opera official chosen
Susan Overman, most recently director of devel

opment for the San Francisco Opera, has been ap
pointed to manage the Stanford University School of
Medicine fund-raising programs, announced David
Mitchell, director of medical development.
Mitchell said in a Sept. 22 announcement that
Overman will report to him as associate director of
medical development. She holds the additional title
of director of development for the medical school.
Her specific duties will involve supervising selec
ted development activities for the School of
Medicine, with an emphasis on the school's ongoing
support programs, Mitchell said. She will also con
centrate on completing that portion of the Medical
Center Agenda Campaign that involves fundralsing
to increase the school's endowment.
Since 1984, Overman served in the top fund
raising capacity at the opera. For five years previous
to that, she was director of resource development for
the CARF Foundation in New York, where she di
rected a 78-person fund-raising staff for the nonprofit
charitable organization, Mitchell said.
Service coordinators named
Stanford graduate Magdalena Fittoria has been
named coordinator of the Public Service Center's
newest project, the Stanford Tutoring Program. The
program is designed to coordinate and offer support
to already existing Stanford tutoring in East Palo
Alto's Ravenswood School District.
Also, Sue Gray has been named to the newly estab
lished position of coordinator of the center's volun
teer clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse will serve as
the hub for information regarding public service
projects, programs, internships and jobs.
