# COP favors campus pub

### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
The Council of Presidents is forming a task force to estab
lish a pub on campus, according to COP member Carey
White, and several student groups have proposed building
the pub in the Old Firehouse.
"It would be an alternative place for students to hang out
and visit," said Michael Ramsey-Perez, coordinator of Stu
dent Organization Services.
"It's supposed to be a wild, fun place — not a place where
you study,' White said.
Whether or not alcohol would be sold at the pub remains
an unresolved question.
"It would not be a pub if it didn't have beer," White said,
"but we know that alcohol is a sensitive issue.
"If there is any possible way, we'd like to not have carding
at the door. II we had to card at the door in order to have
the kind of pub facility we want, you have to realize that
there are 6,000 graduates and at least 1,000 undergraduates
who are over 21," White added.
Whether or not the pub would be run by students also
remains undecided. "That issue is pretty much up in the air.
That's not a central issue, White said.
An acceptance or rejection of the pub would be reached
by a consensus of the University administration, the student
government and student groups, according to Ramsey-
Perez.
"We intend to talk to ... every student service and group
who could have an interest in the pub. That includes Tres
idder Union, the Stanford Bookstore, the Old Union and the
Storke Building," White said.
The task force will also negotiate with organizations cur
rently located in the Old Firehouse.
"One proposal put forth to residents in the Firehouse is,
if we found alternative space for you, would you be willing

to take it so we can use the Firehouse as a central meeting
place for students?" Ramsey-Perez said.
"The notion of relocating the residents at the Firehouse is
problematic. Space on the campus is premium. There are
lots of proposals coming from academic departments for
that space. Sweet Hall is already crammed — it's too small,"'
he said.
The cost of a pub could be prohibitive. It would take
"tons of money to renovate the Firehouse, according to
Ramsey-Perez. White estimated the price tag at to
$500,000.
But a portion of that sum would he spent on improving
the Firehouse whether or not a pub is built there. The
Firehouse "is falling down," according to COP member
Mary Thurber.
Such obstacles shouldn't be allowed to hinder plans for a
student pub, according to White.
"It has got to be done as a long-term plan ... as some
thing not with a deadline on it, but as something that will get
done," he said.
Student reaction to the proposal has been unanimously
positive, according to White. The idea was "met with more
instant support than anything the ASSU's ever proposed," he
wrote in an information sheet for students interested in
joining the task force.
Ramsey-Perez said the past record of student reaction to
similar proposals has been mixed. "There is an interest in
an alternative meeting place, but I don't know if students are
willing to pay for it,"he said, recalling the students' "no"
vote on a fee assessment for improvements at the Lake
Lagunita Boathouse last spring.
The administration has been "kind of indifferent" to the
proposal for a pub, according to Thurber.
A graduate student first suggested building a student pub
during a COP forum in summer quarter to assess student re
action to development at Tressider Union.
