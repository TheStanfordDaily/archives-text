# Reagan Library clears city panel
## 
### BRUCE BROWN Editorial staff 
The Palo Alto Planning Commission
last night agreed unanimously that the
preparatory construction plans for the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
meet zoning ordinances in the Stan
ford foothills.
Last spring, the Stanford University
Board of Trustees approved a site in a
small dell west of Junipero Serra
Boulevard for the $30 million library.
The area had previously been desig
nated as an academic reserve and open
space in the Santa Clara County land
use plan.
The city planning commissioners
decided that the proposed library
structure qualified as a low-density use
of the land — a requirement of the
current zoning plan. Low density
assumes that the disruption to an area
around a proposed structure will be
minimal.
. Last night's approval will set off a se
ries of procedures that will move the
plans for the library closer to finaliza
tion.
The commission will now refer its
decision to the Palo Alto City Council,
which next meets Oct. 20. The coun
cil is then likely to vote on whether to
approve the library's low-density clas
sification, sending its conclusion to the
Santa Clara County Planning CommLs
sion, which will in turn either endorse
the project or make suggestions on
ways for it to meet the zoning specifi
cations.
An issue that remains of concern to
the planning commission is that of the
access road to the library facilities. The
trustees have approved the concept of
extending Campus Drive East 1,230
feet across Junipero Serra and up to
the library entrance, but that approval
is only tentative. The proposed road
would be two lanes and rural in char
acter. It would not be much wider than
the dirt path that currently runs up into
the hills.
Potential access from other major
thoroughfares, such as Sandhill Road,
is still being examined.
If the plans for the building are
eventually finalized by the city and
county authorities, and the package is
approved by Congress, the twenty
acres of land on which it will sit will be
leased by the University to the United
States Government. The completed
Reagan Library will then be adminis
tered by the Archivist of the United
States.
The commission members must
now look into ways to limit the devel
opment in the area around the library
site to ensure that the library and the
surrounding area maintains its low
density classification.
Although the project designers have
underscored their intent to make the

library a place of scholarly research
and not one to be overrun by the gen
eral public, panel members expressed
an awareness that considering its loca
tion in the Bay Area, and the current
president's high level of popularity, the
library could become a major attrac
tion, with attendence figures far
exceeding the projected 300,000 to
500,000 visitors per year.
Commission member Pat Cullen
commented about the institution's
promised lack of traffic: "That's what
they told us about the shopping cen
ter."
Supporters of the proposed location
of the library claim the library deserves
a low-density qualification for several
reasons. First, they say, the library will
be primarily a research facility. Accord
ing to planners and organizers, the
Reagan Library will definitely not be a
public museum, as many of the other
presidential libraries are because it
will have only 10,500 square feet
devoted to exhibitions.
Most other presidential libraries
have capacities of between 18,000 and
28,000 square feet devoted to perman
ent displays. The kinds of presidential
memorabilia that tend to attract most
tourists, such as garments and official
vehicles, will not be located in the li
brary but rather likely sent to a private
Reagan museum in Illinois.
Public programs, in general, vyill be
quiet in nature, planners say.
Planners have pointed out that the li
brary will be open only between the
hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. daily,
thus preventing an influx of traffic
during rush hours. After the structure
is completed, there is predicted only to
be a 3 percent increase in the traffic
flow, which translates roughly into 400
cars per day.
The proposed parking for these cars
is a two-tiered, 300-car lot that would
be on the library grounds but essen
tially obscured from street view.
The proposal also stresses that the
architectural design of the building —
a quadrangle around a central court
yard — and the surrounding area will
blend in comfortably with the overall
physical look of the campus. This
design emphasizes broad, open spaces
and an avoidance of anything
monumental in scope.
Plans call for details as specific as
even the traditional Stanford red-tiled
root and allow the possibility of se
quoia redwoods on the grounds.
The grounds comprise a total of 20
acres, half of which will actually be
used for the building. The other half
will be landscaped and preserved as
part of a general Stanford plan to
reforest sections of the foothills. The
proposed building can be expected to
become less visible from the street as
this reforesting process takes root.
