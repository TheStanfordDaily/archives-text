# Band gets Orient-ed
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
Each fall, as Stanford's incoming stu
dents go through the orientation
process that acquaints them with
their new school, the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) goes through a similar
process. Called "Band Kamp" (sic), the
Band's orientation is a week long ses
sion of recruitment, rehearsal and all
campus rallies. Interested individuals
are invited to audition for the group,
and cuts are made to arrive at the lean,
mean music machine hilled as "The
World's Largest Rock and Roll Band
This fall, the emphasis in the Band's
orientation was on "Orient,' and the
stakes were particularly high in audi
tions as the LSJUMB readied to accom
pany the football team to Tokyo for the
Coca-Cola Bowl (formerly the Mirage
Bowl) on Thanksgiving weekend.
The prospect of a trip to Japan un
doubtedly raised interest in the Band,
according to senior Chris Schroeder,
the Band's public relations director.

Band members jubilantly oil their valves in anticipation of performing in a far-off land.
"(Band orientation) was big. We had
a lot of people, which means we had to
make a lot of cuts," Schroeder s v aid,
noting that almost 40 individuals were
cut from the Band this year compared
to "a total of less than 10 last year."
Many of those who tried out were
former Band members coming back to
the fold.
"It seemed like there were a lot
more people who returned after not
playing for a while, and I think that's
directly related to Japan," Schroeder
said.
"I think a free week in Japan would
lure a lot of people," Band Manager
Jeff Stevens said.
Sure enough, it did, but the trip to
Japan doesn't fully account for the big
freshman turnout at auditions.
"There was some press coverage of
the fact that the Band would be accom
panying the football team to Japan, but
I really doubt that any freshmen got
wind of that," Schroeder said. In fact,
"the turnout was something of a
surprise" because "this past year the
Band lost several of its traditional
avenues of reaching freshmen,' ac
cording to Schroeder.
"This year's the first time that we
weren't mentioned in the orientation
packct that was mailed to freshmen,"
he explained, "and that's a way we
traditionally got letters of interest from
incoming students."
In addition, "Orientation this year
was much more scheduled, much ful
ler (than in years past)," so that fresh
men had less opportunity to attend the
first Band rehearsal on Thursday of ori
entation week.
The result, Schroeder said, was that
"freshman turnout at Band orientation
events was sparse."

However, Stevens said, "we did a
really great job of P.R. for ourselves
through our playing (at various rallies
during orientation)."
Those goodwill tours of campus
throughout orientation, combined
with the prospect of a trip to Japan,

largely explain what Stevens called "a
huge crowd" at last Monday's rehearsal
and at auditions over the weekend.
The trip to Japan, though, is a two
edged sword. While it has heightened
enthusiasm among present and
prospective Band mertibers, financial

and space restrictions have neces
sitated a second round of cuts before
the journey.
Stevens said that the Band's mem
bership stands at 150 now and will
remain at that level through Big Game.
But only 95 Band members will be

able to make the trip to Japan.
"We want to take the people who are
the most involved in the Band,"
Stevens said. "We want to take a lot of
young people."
In Japan, the LSJUMB will perform a
joint halftime show with the University
of Arizona Marching Band. The two
bands will wear matching uniforms
that, according to Stevens, will be
more like Stanford's regular uniforms
than those of the Arizona group. At the
request of the bowl organizers, all the
musicians will wear blazers in the style
of the LSJUMB, Stevens said.
The LSJUMB will take a special
jumbo pack of Dollies to Japan, with
both last year's and this year's five
women squads making the trip.
Stanford's representatives are as yet
unclear about the final form that the
joint halftime show will take, Stevens
said. "But the Arizona people are
writing the show, and they know that
we don't march. That's about all I can
say. The Japanese people don't like
straight marching ... they hated U.S.C.
last year," he added.
The Japanese group in charge of the
Coca-Cola Bowl also knows of the
Band's penchant for rock and roll, but
that doesn't present any problems.
"From what we understand, they
(the Japanese) are pretty fond of Amer
ican rock and roll, so we figure to be a
pretty big hit," Schroeder said.
Still the bowl organizers have sent
the Band a list of songs they'd like to
hear, including "Georgia," "We Are the
World" and "My Old Kentucky Home"
(the latter "because the Japanese like
Kentucky Fried Chicken," Stevens ex
plained in all seriousness).
"I hope we get to play some of our
own music," he said.
The Coca-Cola Bowl will be played

on a Sunday in Tokyo, but because of
the time difference between Japan and
the United States, the game will be
seen on American television on Satur
day.
Because the Band is performing
along with the Arizona group, and be
cause the final content of the show will
be largely dictated by the Japanese
bowl organizers, the show, unlike
some LSJUMB outings in the past, will
almost certainly be suitable for family
viewing.
"Well, the networks won't have to be
afraid of catching anything they can't
broadcast nationally, that's for sure,"
Schroeder said. "If ever there were a
safe time to film the Band and show it
nationwide, that would be it."
The Band's faculty director, Prof. Ar
thur Barnes, will travel to Japan this
weekend with Stanford Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger. The two will meet
with delegations from Arizona and the
Coca-Cola Bowl to work out specifics
of the game and band performance.
"It's a logistics meeting," Barnes
said. "We're going to find out how best
to put on what we need to do."
"I really don't know how we (the
LSJUMB) are going to be used ... or
abused," he continued."Both bands
are worried that they're going to lose
their identity."
Stevens said that the Band's prepara
tion for the trip will focus not so much
on any extra rehearsal as upon orienta-.
tion for the venture into a radically dif
ferent culture as representatives of a
reputable American university.
"More than anything, the Band just
needs to understand what it's getting
into," he explained.
One of the more interesting aspects

Johnson and Julie Nasif (obscured) kick up their heels and grin happily at the thought of bringing pizza, beer, large
wooden forks and other amenities of Western culture to Japan when the Band travels to Tokyo for the Coca-Cola
Bowl on Thanksgiving weekend.
of the trip is that the Band will fly a
chartered jet across the international
date line on the Wednesday before
Thanksgiving, effectively missing al
most all of Thanksgiving. On the way
home, it will leave Tokyo on Tuesday
night and arrive in San Francisco on
Tuesday morning.

Less well-received,
was the Band's ar
rival as surprise
guests at a private
black-tie fundrais
ing dinner in
honor of the UC-
Berkeley Band.

Meanwhile, the Band is preparing it
self mentally for its itinerant Thanks
giving by travelling widely both in the
past few weeks and in the months
ahead. Already, the group has travelled
to Austin, Texas and exotic Lafayette,
Calif, (just outside of Berkeley).
Some 40 Band members made the
pilgrimmage to Austin for the Texas
football game three weeks ago. Several
travelled by plane while others drove
in vans, stopping along the way to pick

up Bandsmen scattered across the
southwest United States.
"We called it our Sunbelt Tour," said
senior Phil Cline, the Band's alto
saxophone section leader.
In Austin the Band didn't play a
pregame or halftime show because of
limited size, but did play rally music
throughout the game and also per
formed a well-received postgame
show, according to Stevens.
Less well-received was the Band's
trip to Lafayette as surprise guests at a
black-tie fundraising dinner in honor
of the UC-Berkeley Marching Band's
95th anniversary, last Saturday night.
The part)' was held at the home of a
Berkeley alum whose neighbor
(ironically named Gil Berkeley) is a
Stanford graduate. The Stanford neigh
bor caught wind of the party and called
the Stanford Band to tip it off and invite
the group to crash the event.
The LSJUMB was quick to accept the
invitation, according to Stevens, and
arrived down the street from the party
just behind four busloads of fully
uniformed Cal bandsmen.
The Stanford group snuck into the
garage of the neighbor, and after a
tense wait, "snuck down the driveway
and charged into the backyard playing
Bill Tell'(the William Tell Overture),"
Stevens said.
"Some of their band members were
really pissed," said Stevens. "But we
only played two songs, and after they
got done playing they came over and
told us how funny they thought it was.
The Cal guy who owned the house
thought it was hilarious."
On Nov. 8, the Band will travel to
Pasadena for the UCLA football game.
It's hoped that that trip will be a run
through for another LSJUMB trip to
Pasadena in early 1987.
