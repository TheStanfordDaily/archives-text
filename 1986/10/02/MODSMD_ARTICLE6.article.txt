### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
Each fall, as Stanford's incoming stu
dents go through the orientation
process that acquaints them with
their new school, the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) goes through a similar
process. Called "Band Kamp" (sic), the
Band's orientation is a week long ses
sion of recruitment, rehearsal and all
campus rallies. Interested individuals
are invited to audition for the group,
and cuts are made to arrive at the lean,
mean music machine hilled as "The
World's Largest Rock and Roll Band
This fall, the emphasis in the Band's
orientation was on "Orient,' and the
stakes were particularly high in audi
tions as the LSJUMB readied to accom
pany the football team to Tokyo for the
Coca-Cola Bowl (formerly the Mirage
Bowl) on Thanksgiving weekend.
The prospect of a trip to Japan un
doubtedly raised interest in the Band,
according to senior Chris Schroeder,
the Band's public relations director.
