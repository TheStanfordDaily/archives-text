# Farm resists drug testing

### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
When University of Maryland basketball star
Len Bias and former UCLA football player Don
Rogers died of drug abuse this summer, the cry
went out across the country for colleges to imple
ment mandatory drug-testing programs for
student-athletes.
Stanford, however, has remained unswayed by
the mounting number of schools that have
adopted such programs. Instead, the University
has put its trust in the individual student-athlete
to be responsible for his or her own actions and
has refused to develop a mandatory drug testing
program.
"We believe that you know the difference be
tween the right thing to do and the wrong thing
to do intrinsically, said Andy Geiger, director of
the Athletic Department- "We don't want to play
cops and robbers
While the University does not have its own
mandatory drug-testing program, Cieiger stressed
that the lack of such a program does not mean the
University is unconcerned about drug use.
"Let me emphasize that we re not soft on drug
use," he said.
Despite Stanford's determination to let student
athletes make their own decisions about drug
use, the NCAA requires all collegiate
athletes to sign a consent form agree
ing to conform to and abide by
prescribed NO\A regulations.
The NCAA requires athletes on
teams that qualify for post-season
championship or bowl games to wil
lingly participate in drug testing.
"We reserve the right to do it before,
during or after the (post-season) coin
petition," said Frank IJryasz, assistant
director of research and sports science
for the NCAA.
If a player tests positive for drug use,
he or she would be ineligible to com
pete for a minimum of 90 days after the
test, Urasz said, adding that in some in
stances an entire team can become in
eligible as the result of one person's
actions.
Should the 3-0 Cardinal football

team receive and accept a bowl bid,
the 22 regular starting players would
lie tested, Geiger said. Fourteen other
players would be randomly selected to
submit to drug tests.
"If we go to a bowl game, you better
believe they're going to test us," said
Jack Friedenthal, faculty athletic repre
sentative.
The purpose of singling out student
athletes for drug tests remains unclear
to some at the University.
"It's not clear at all to me what the
tests are supposed to do,' said James
Lyons, dean of Student Affairs.
Lyons said the policy could be aimed
at taking away "an unfair advantage
caused by use of performance
enhancing drugs, embarrassing
coaches and players with disclosures
of the names of student-athletes found
to be using NCAA-banned drugs or a
general feeling in society that street
drugs are evil.
"They (the NCAA) have a solution in
search of several problems," Lyons

said, calling the NCAA's rule "a fairly
serious step, probably unconstitutional
and a had response."
Uryasz and the NG\A see the policy
in a different light.
"Its basis ... (is to ensure) clean,
equitable competition in the champi
onship events," Uryasz said.
As for Stanford's persistence in not
implementing a mandatory drug test
ing program, Uryasz said the NCAA has
not put any pressure on the University
to develop such a system.
"It has always been the NCAA's phil
osophy to understand that all schools
are unique," he said.
Stanford could become truly unique
if it does not begin mandatory drug
testing.

Thirty-six percent of NCAA Division I
institutions now have mandatory drug
testing for student-athletes, and an
other 17 percent are actively planning
to implement such programs, Uryasz
said.
Stanford doesn't appear to be
joining the ranks of those universities
anytime soon. As Geiger noted, the
University "has no plans" to begin
mandatory drug tests.
Friedenthal agreed with Geiger,
stating that "we're not going to drug
test mandatorily at this University."
Geiger noted that if student-athletes
voluntarily want to be tested for drug
use, the University will comply with
the students' requests.
