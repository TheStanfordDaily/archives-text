U.S., Soviets downplay hopes
MOSCOW — Soviet and U.S. officials yesterday warned against unrealis
tic hopes for the hastily arranged meeting between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Iceland next week but indicated that
the session might produce a breakthrough toward an agreement to limit
intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
White House chief of staff Donald Regan, appearing on ABC-TV's "Good
Morning, America," said the Oct. 11-12 meeting in Reykjavik "could lead to
a better understanding and, perhaps, some give here and there in order to
reach an agreement so we get some arms reductions."
Saying it was unlikely that any agreement would actually be signed by
Reagan and Gorbachev in Iceland, Regan added: "I am not trying to hype
this meeting to that extent."
His view was echoed by Soviet spokesmen in Moscow and in the United
States. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, interviewed On
NBC-TV's "Today" show, predicted "some kind of breakthrough" in Reyk
javik but said it would probably be limited to new instructions to lower
level weapons specialists that would provide the momentum for a new
agreement.
In continuing arms-control talks in Geneva, both sides have indicated
their willingness to reduce their intermediate-range missiles to 100 war
heads apiece. But differences remain, particularly because the United
States wants the same 100-warhead limit on Soviet weapons in Asia, which
China regards as a threat, while retaining an equal number of intermediate
range weapons in the continental United States. Moscow has offered only
to freeze its Asian arsenal at the current level of 513 warheads.
The main objective at this third Reagan-Gorbachev meeting will be to
agree on instructions to arms control negotiators to push them toward an
agreement that can be signed at a full-fledged summit in the United States.
Reagan: U.S. firm in Daniloff deal
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, calling Nicholas Daniloff a "very
welcome visitor," met with the journalist at the White House and denied
that the United States had caved in while forging the complex agreements
that brought the reporter his freedom.
Reagan, appearing with Daniloff and his family in the Rose Garden,
defended U.S. actions that resulted in Daniloffs release by the Soviets a
month after he was apprehended on charges of espionage.
"I don't think there was any caving in at all," Reagan said. "I just said
there wouldn't be any meeting until he was freed."
When asked whether U.S.-Soviet relations are now back on track, Reagan
replied: "We'll find out in about 10 days." Reagan is scheduled to meet with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on Oct. 11-12 in Iceland — a session that
was a key ingredient in the negotiations that led to Daniloffs release.
The 51-year-old reporter, who was greeted earlier by a cheering throng
of colleagues at U.S. News & World Report offices here, praised Reagan for
his efforts.
"This is a very complex situation and, if it hadn't been for President
Reagan taking a very deep and personal interest in my case, it would prob
ably be some years before I would stand here and say: 'Thank you, Mr.
President,' " Daniloff said at the White House.
Daniloff said he was very pleased with the conditions under which he
was released. "There was no trial in my case," he said. "My honor and in
tegrity were preserved."
He also hailed the agreement to allow dissident Soviet physicist Yuri Or
lov and his wife to emigrate to the United States as a "terrific achievement."
Baker warns of protectionism
WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Treasury James Baker warned yester
day that failure of the Europeans and Japanese to "adjust their economies
and attitudes" could unleash a flood of global protectionism and isolation
ism.
Baker's comments moved the simmering debate over international in
terest rates and the value of the dollar squarely into the political arena and
indicated that the Reagan administration would continue to push hard for
economic policy changes by leading trading partners, particularly West
Germany and Japan.
Baker's remarks, contained in an address to the joint annual meeting of
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank here, follow last
weekend's inability of the seven major industrial nations to settle disputes
over trade, interest rates and exchange rates.
The administration is disappointed that Bonn and Tokyo have refused to
take steps to stimulate their economies and increase imports of American
goods to help reduce a swollen U.S. trade deficit.
"Some of these countries appear to be taking steps to enhance growth,
although not as rapidly as the trade imbalances may necessitate," Baker
said, referring pointedly to Germany and Japan. "Moreover, troubling
forecasts suggest that some nations' growth may slow over the course of
the next year."
German and Japanese officials dispute Baker's reading of their economic
data and have refused to take expansionary steps — such as reducing inter
est rates — fearing inflation and overheated growth.
S. Korean opposition fights Chun
SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Young Sam, a driving force behind the op
position New Korea Democratic Party, said yesterday that his party would
carry out a series of public rallies throughout the country in an effort to
force President Chun Doo Hwan to agree to direct presidential elections.
Kim said the first rally was scheduled for Oct. 9, in Kunsan, a port city in
the west. It is to be followed by others at the rate of one a week until Chun
agrees either to meet with Kim and Kim Dae Jung, the other behind-the
scenes opposition leader, or accepts an opposition demand for a presiden
tial system of government and direct election of the president.
Chun, a former general who came to power in 1980 after a military coup
d'etat, has said that he will step down in 1988.
Not until Chun drops his insistence on having a parliamentary form of
government will the New Korea Democratic Party resume its place in a Na
tional Assembly committee on constitutional revision, Kim said in an inter
view. His New Korea Democratic Party announced Tuesday that it would
boycott the committee's meetings.
If the new rallies take place, they could result in the sort of confronta
tions that have become part of the South Korean political scene. In May,
student radicals disrupted an opposition rally in Inchon and touched off
the most violent incident in South Korea since 1980, when 193 people
were killed in a 10-day insurrection in Kwangju.
Kim said he was confident that the rallies could be brought off peace
fully.
"All but a handful of students realize that they cannot afford to make the
New Korea Democratic Party an enemy in their struggle for democratiza
tion," he said. "Democracy must be achieved by peaceful and non-violent
means. Violence will only invite violence."
Airlines hike fares
NEW YORK — United Airlines led the way today in a new round of fare
hikes by major airlines, a move that was widely expected after consolida
tion in the industry knocked out most discount carriers.
United, the nation's largest carrier, said that it would raise fares about 5
percent effective today for 80 to 90 non-stop routes from its Chicago hub.
American, Delta and Trans World Airlines followed suit on many of their
own routes, although the effective dates varied.
The airlines increased one-way ticket prices by $10 for coach and $15 for
first class on trips under 1,000 miles For trips over 1,000 miles the in
creases are $20 for coach and $30 for first class. For example, United's reg
ular one-way fare between Chicago and Los Angeles will rise from $410 to
$430 in coach and from $615 to $645 in first class.
