# U.S. plots to scare Khadafi
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” In August the
Reagan administration launched a se
cret and unusual campaign of decep
tion designed to convince Libyan
leader Moammar Khadafi that he was
about to be attacked again by U.S.
bombers and perhaps be ousted in a
coup, according to informed sources
and documents.
The secret plan, adopted at a White
House meeting on Aug. 14, was out
lined in a three-page, memo that John
Poindexter, the president's national se
curity affairs adviser, sent to President
Reagan. ,
"One of the key elements" of the
new strategy, the Poindexter memo
said, "is that it combines real and illu
sionary events through a disinforma
tion program with the basic goal of
making Khadafi think that there is a
high degree of internal opposition to
him within Libya, that his key trusted
aides are disloyal, that the U.S. is about
to move against him militarily."
It was an elaborate plan involving "a
series of closely coordinated events in
volving coven, diplomatic, military and

public actions," according to Poindex
ter's memo. Military officers expressed
some reservations about the plan, and
intelligence specialists were deeply
divided about its potential efficacy. The
plan was the latest phase of the admin
istration's policy, first adopted last
year, to try to topple Khadafi, a known

instigator of terrorist acts targeted by
the administration as a threat that has
to be removed.
The objective of the plan was to
keep Khadafi "preoccupied" and "off
balance" and to portray him as
"paranoid and ineffective" so that, as
the memo put it, "forces within Libya
which desire his overthrow \Cill be em
boldened to take action."
Poindexter's three-page memo to
Reagan outlining the plan was drafted
in preparation for a National Security
Planning Group (NSPG) meeting con
vened to consider the next steps the
administration would take against
Khadafi.
The president, Poindexter and nine
other key officials met at the White
House to discuss this plan at 11 a.m.
Thursday, Aug. 14. Sources said the
basic plan was approved and codified
in general terms in a formal presiden
tial decision document. Details of the
plan were left to Poindexter, the State
Department and the Central Intelli
gence Agency.
Soon after the meeting, administra

tion officials told reporters that the
United States had new intelligence in
dicating that Khadafi was again step
ping up his terrorist plans, following a
four-month lull after the April 14
American bombing raid against Libya.
But Poindexter's memo to Reagan
just before the Aug. 14 meeting painted
a less alarming picture: "Although the
current intelligence-community assess
ment is that Khadafi is temporarily
quiescent in his support of terrorism,
he may soon move to a more active
role."
Other sources confirmed that there
was no significant, reliable intelligence
in mid-August to suggest that Khadafi
was stepping up his terrorist plans.
But the State Department and the
CIA concluded that it might be an op
portune moment to execute the coup
de grace against the Libyan leader.
The administration has concluded
that, as the Poindexter memo said,
"any alternative leadership to Khadafi
would be better for U.S. interests and
international order."
