## Admission Clues

If that class is admitted and I'm
not in it, you 'll regret it, Dean Jean
May be not today, maybe not tomor
row, but soon, and for the rest of
your life
With a new school year comes a
new essay in Stanford's Undergrad
uate Admissions application:
"Select your favorite quotation, or
one that holds special importance
for you, and comment upon its sig
nificance."
If this essay had appeared in the
days of Fred Hargadon, applicants
would have known to quote his fa
vorite book, "The Phantom Toll
booth."
But Jean Fetter, who might be
described as a riddle wrapped in a
mystery inside an enigma, is not so
easy to figure out.
1 called her yesterday to get some
tips for applicants. Here's what 1
came up with.
She says she has no single favor
ite book but particularly likes
biographies. She says she has no
single favorite movie but loves
Woody Allen and Ingmar Bergman.
And she says she has no single fa
vorite poem but is partial to Dylan
Thomas.
She also says that applicants
quoting from her personal favorites
will be judged the same as every
one else.
Sure.
I'd go with Bergman.
I'd avoid "The Little Prince,"
"Stripes" — unless it's Bill Murray's

eloquent rationalization for choos
ing to enter the Army rather than a
monastery — and Steven Mosher's
"Broken Earth."
Finally, rumor has it that Jon
Reider, an assistant dean in the Ad
missions Office, gives top marks to
applicants who show familiarity
with "Finnegans Wake" and the
speeches of George McGovern.
The higgest change in the new
application is that it no longer asks
students for their photograph.
Fetter explains that "some stu
dents misunderstood how the
photos were used," meaning that
they thought their looks played a
part in the selection process.
Emphasizing that admissions offi
cers have not consciously used the
photos in selecting past classes, Fet
ter said she feels that the photos
might have had an effect on
decision-making anyway.
The decision to drop the photos
is especially interesting because the
admissions office will now deter
mine who the minorities are by ask
ing applicants to self-identify.
At least one person won't be
dismayed when she reads that
pictures are no longer required.
Four years ago, my mother shook
her head as she looked at the photo
I had stapled to my Stanford appli
cation.
"Why don't you use a picture of
your friend Danny instead?" she
suggested. "He's got such nice
eyes."
