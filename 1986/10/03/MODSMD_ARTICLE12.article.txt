The release Monday of U.S. journalist Nicholas
Daniloff, who was accused by the KGB of being a spy,
would seem to bode well for U.S.-Soviet summit
prospects. In reality, however, it is another in a long list
of incidents serving as evidence that such a meeting may
not accomplish much.
On the surface, the deal has the encouraging air of
compromise about it. Daniloff was released, but so was
Soviet spy Gennady Zahkarov; Soviet human rights ac
tivist Yuri Orlov will be allowed to emigrate, but more
than two dozen Soviet employees at the United Nations
— accused of spying by U.S. officials — will remain in
the United States. All in all, the deal appears to be a favor
able sign that the United States and the Soviet Union are
willing and able to negotiate. And the exchange did pave
the way for the talks in Iceland scheduled for next
weekend.
But favorable first impressions give way to a sobering
reality: The Daniloff deal is indicative of how strained
and laborious U.S.-Soviet relations have become. The
two superpowers traded accusations and inflamed rhetor
ic for a month before arriving at an agreement that was
so obvious it was almost a foregone conclusion, and
upon completion of the deal, both sides claimed they got
the better of it. It's an all-too-familiar scenario.
Indeed, it's a scenario characterized by the distrust
that has plagued relations between the Soviet Union and

the West since the days of Stalin. The construction of the
Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis and, more recently,
the controversy over the downing of Korean Air Lines
Flight 007 are all grave chapters in the delicately
balanced U.S.-Soviet relationship. It is unrealistic to ex
pea a two-day meeting between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Gorbachev to significantly alter that rela
tionship.
Prospects for the summit become even more bleak
when one looks at its agenda. In the Daniloff case, both
sides focused on resolving one issue. For the summit,
however, there are numerous issues. Gorbachev and
other Soviet officials have lobbied for an agenda exclu
sively on arms control, while Reagan officials have said
they want the meeting to cover the broader political rela
tionship. Gorbachev wants to talk about SDI and
Euromissiles. Reagan hopes to discuss Soviet misconduct
in places like Nicaragua and Afghanistan. With no clear
set of goals, chances of reaching any are slim.
But expectations for summits such as these always run
high. And there is an outside chance that Reagan and
Gorbachev will come to a meaningful agreement on an
important issue. But the likelihood that the meeting will
produce a thaw in the frigid U.S.-Soviet relationship is
low. A warming trend in the cold air of Reykjavik is unus
ual, to say the least.
