Law school women
call on students
to protest sexism
On Tuesday, Sept. 23, two women
were asked during an interview with a
law firm whether they were married or
had children. One was a woman of
color, the other had an Hispanic
surname. No men were asked these
questions. The Stanford Law School
non-discrimination policy, which was
developed through the cooperative ef
forts of the students, faculty and place
ment director, had recommended
against asking questions related to
marital and parental status. The policy
mandated that if such questions were
asked, they be asked of everyone. Sur
veys were to be used to determine
whether questions had been asked
selectively.
The law school non-discrimination
policy was developed last spring.
Copies were sent to all employers in
terviewing at the law school and were
included in the packet of materials in
terviewers received when they arrived
on campus. Students were informed of
the policy at orientation meetings on
interviews. The placement director
told students to report possible viola
tions to her. She would then send a
questionnaire to students who had in
terviewed with the firm in question to
gather relevant data. The question
naires were to be distributed immedi
ately while students clearly remem
bered their interviews. A written copy
of the policy was distributed to all stu
dents with an attached note restating
the placement office s procedures. It
was stated explicitly that the issuance
of a questionnaire would be automatic.
The two students who were asked
the questions about their marital and
parental status independently reported
their experiences to the placement
director. One student was told ques
tionnaires would be distributed early
Wednesday morning. By mid

afternoon no questionnaires had been
distributed. When the student returned
to the placement office, she was asked
to meet with the placement director
and the dean of Student Affairs. During
an hour-long meeting, the student was
told that the administration did not
recognize the policy's requirement
that questionnaires be sent. The place
ment director had spoken with the in
terviewer, who was genuinely apolo
getic. The administration felt that this
was all the action that was necessary,
unless the student wanted to speak
with the interviewer personally. The
student felt betrayed by the school's
failure to implement what had seemed
a clear and explicit policy.
Distributing a questionnaire was ne
cessary to learn what had happened. In
view of the placement office's refusal
to do so, Women of Stanford Law
(WSL) issued a questionnaire in the in
terest of women at the law school. WSL
did not have a list of the students who
had interviewed with the firm in ques
tion. As a result, it was necessary to dis
tribute questionnaires to all second
and third-year students. An ex
planatory note did not accompany the
questionnaire because we did not want
to prejudice responses.
We are grateful to the many students
who answered the questionnaire. It
was clear from the responses that most
students, including the two women
concerned, found the firm to be pro
fessional and concerned with affirma
tive action. Although we do not
condone the firm's asking inappropri
ate questions, our main dissatisfaction
lies with the placement office and
school administration.
We have spoken with Paul
Goldstein, the chair of the faculty com
mittee on career placement. His com
mittee will meet next week to review
and clarify the policy. We, however,
feel that a collective student response
is appropriate. Many student organiza
tions sent representatives to meetings
regarding the policy for more than
four months last spring. We are calling
on the Law Association to form a griev
ance committee composed of repre

sentatives from the Asian-American,
Black, Jewish and Native Americans law
student associations and WSL and
other concerned students. Members of
the committee would be available to
discuss and follow up any respoases
students have to interview experi
ences. We feel strongly that the individ
ual students who experience discrimi
nation should not have to act as their
own advocates.
We ask the Law Association to add
this issue to the agenda for the upcom
ing general student meeting. We are
shocked at the placement office's
response to this situation and hope
that students and student organizations
will express their concerns to the
dean, the faculty committee and the
placement office directly.

mandated that if such questions were
asked, they be asked of everyone. Sur
veys were to be used to determine
whether questions had been asked
selectively.
The law school non-discrimination
policy was developed last spring.
Copies were sent to all employers in
terviewing at the law school and were
included in the packet of materials in
terviewers received when they arrived
on campus. Students were informed of
the policy at orientation meetings on
interviews. The placement director
told students to report possible viola
tions to her. She would then send a
questionnaire to students who had in
terviewed with the firm in question to
gather relevant data. The question
naires were to be distributed immedi
ately while students clearly remem
bered their interviews. A written copy
of the policy was distributed to all stu
dents with an attached note restating
the placement office s procedures. It
was stated explicitly that the issuance
of a questionnaire would be automatic.
The two students who were asked
the questions about their marital and
parental status independently reported
their experiences to the placement
director. One student was told ques
tionnaires would be distributed early
Wednesday morning. By mid

afternoon no questionnaires had been
distributed. When the student returned
to the placement office, she was asked
to meet with the placement director
and the dean of Student Affairs. During
an hour-long meeting, the student was
told that the administration did not
recognize the policy's requirement
that questionnaires be sent. The place
ment director had spoken with the in
terviewer, who was genuinely apolo
getic. The administration felt that this
was all the action that was necessary,
unless the student wanted to speak
with the interviewer personally. The
student felt betrayed by the school's
failure to implement what had seemed
a clear and explicit policy.
Distributing a questionnaire was ne
cessary to learn what had happened. In
view of the placement office's refusal
to do so, Women of Stanford Law
(WSL) issued a questionnaire in the in
terest of women at the law school. WSL
did not have a list of the students who
had interviewed with the firm in ques
tion. As a result, it was necessary to dis
tribute questionnaires to all second
and third-year students. An ex
planatory note did not accompany the
questionnaire because we did not want
to prejudice responses.
We are grateful to the many students
who answered the questionnaire. It
was clear from the responses that most
students, including the two women
concerned, found the firm to be pro
fessional and concerned with affirma
tive action. Although we do not
condone the firm's asking inappropri
ate questions, our main dissatisfaction
lies with the placement office and
school administration.
We have spoken with Paul
Goldstein, the chair of the faculty com
mittee on career placement. His com
mittee will meet next week to review
and clarify the policy. We, however,
feel that a collective student response
is appropriate. Many student organiza
tions sent representatives to meetings
regarding the policy for more than
four months last spring. We are calling
on the Law Association to form a griev
ance committee composed of repre

sentatives from the Asian-American,
Black, Jewish and Native Americans law
student associations and WSL and
other concerned students. Members of
the committee would be available to
discuss and follow up any respoases
students have to interview experi
ences. We feel strongly that the individ
ual students who experience discrimi
nation should not have to act as their
own advocates.
We ask the Law Association to add
this issue to the agenda for the upcom
ing general student meeting. We are
shocked at the placement office's
response to this situation and hope
that students and student organizations
will express their concerns to the
dean, the faculty committee and the
placement office directly.
