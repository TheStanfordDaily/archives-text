# Fight prejudice on Farm

Looking down from the hill where Stanford's radio tele
scope dish stands, the red tile roofs of the campus are easy
to see. All of Stanford's buildings have these roofs, in accor
dance with the wishes of Mrs. Leland Stanford, who wanted
to be able to spot Stanford from heaven (or at least so goes
the story that I've heard). Noticing this similarity of roofs —
a similarity that often extends into other parts of the build
ings as well — it is nice to note that this uniformity of archi
tecture does not reflect the composition of the Stanford
community. The diversity of the staff, faculty and students at
this University is so refreshing that I sometimes wonder
whether Mrs. Stanford, after so many years of looking down
at red tile roofs, wouldn't find it a pleasant surprise to see a
bright blue roof appear on one of the newer buildings.

Yet, though Stanford does offer a great variety of people
to interact with, many new arrivals run away from this diver
sity and instead cling — sometimes for their entire time
here — to the familiar. Last year was my freshman year here,
and I remember another freshman in my dorm telling me
that she had just met her roommate, and since they had
"nothing in common," she was going to avoid her as much
as possible. Even before their first conversation, she had
assumed — because of her roommate's looks, hometown,
parents or whatever — that there was no way for the two of
them to get along. The worst thing about this kind of ap
proach is that it isn't just applied to a few select people. Your
classmates, your teammates, everyone you meet is judged in
the same way. Another freshman in my dorm read an ad
vertisement for an ethnic dance and asked: "Why can't they
act like normal people?" This inability even to try to get to
know people who are in some way different from you and
the tendency not even to give them a chance Is harmful not
only to the person looking at things in this way but also to
those with whom this person interacts. What would you do
if your roommate walked into your room for the first time,
looked at the posters you had put up, and quickly walked
out again without even talking to you? Not a happy welcome
to Stanford.
Okay, so hopefully most of the people coming here are
not going to act like that. You probably won't take one look
at your roommate or classmate and write them off. But a
related problem that most people miss is the assumptions
you make about people when you first meet them. The easy
ones to spot are prejudices based on ethnicity, religious ten
dency or nationality. But "some of my best friends are
(white/black/ Asian/Jewish/Christian/Indian — substitute
the term of your preference)," you say. "I wouldn't assume
things about them." Yet because of the way they're brought
up, everyone does, expecting certain things of certain kinds
of people. What is important to remember is this: Each one
of us carries around prejudices like these and has to be
aware of them if we want to give the people we meet a fair
shake and not jump to all sorts of conclusions.
Other prejudices, though not based on religion or eth
nicity and therefore not played up as much, can be just as
bad. Someone studies a lot, so he or she becomes a "nerd,"
relegated forever to the world of pocket protecters, glasses
and computers. Or someone is good at sports, so he or she
is a "jock," carrying with that name the assumption that his
or her I.Q. is the same as his or her shoe size. The list is end

less, but it is easy to see that prejudices of all kinds exist
everywhere.
"All right, so maybe I do have my prejudices," you say.
"Big deal. Everyone has them, so why should I bother
paying much attention to them? I'm pretty fair to people."
The problem with this kind of attitude is that if you're not
aware of your assumptions they can lead to all sorts of
things. Anything from going along with your friends who
decide to throw the hall "nerd" into the shower "just for the
fun of it" to letting your views about Jews make you look the
other way when someone with more extreme views decides
to do something about the "problem" (it's the often used —
and quite rightly so — example of Nazi Germany).
Prejudices and the desire to avoid anything unfamiliar can
very easily affect not only the person with those views but
the people around him or her.
So what does this have to do with life here at Stanford? It's
just something to keep in mind when you're meeting your
roommates, teachers and classmates. If a person isn't the
same color or studies (or parties) more or less than you do,
you should still try to greet them in the same way you would
someone who does everything "your way." There are a lot
of fun people out there, and you're just as different to them
as they are to you. Try not to assume things about them, and
hopefully, they'll not try to assume things about you. You'll
both discover that the other one is just a person: different in
some ways, the same in others, but not someone to run
away from or be scared of.

those with whom this person interacts. What would you do
if your roommate walked into your room for the first time,
looked at the posters you had put up, and quickly walked
out again without even talking to you? Not a happy welcome
to Stanford.
Okay, so hopefully most of the people coming here are
not going to act like that. You probably won't take one look
at your roommate or classmate and write them off. But a
related problem that most people miss is the assumptions
you make about people when you first meet them. The easy
ones to spot are prejudices based on ethnicity, religious ten
dency or nationality. But "some of my best friends are
(white/black/ Asian/Jewish/Christian/Indian — substitute
the term of your preference)," you say. "I wouldn't assume
things about them." Yet because of the way they're brought
up, everyone does, expecting certain things of certain kinds
of people. What is important to remember is this: Each one
of us carries around prejudices like these and has to be
aware of them if we want to give the people we meet a fair
shake and not jump to all sorts of conclusions.
Other prejudices, though not based on religion or eth
nicity and therefore not played up as much, can be just as
bad. Someone studies a lot, so he or she becomes a "nerd,"
relegated forever to the world of pocket protecters, glasses
and computers. Or someone is good at sports, so he or she
is a "jock," carrying with that name the assumption that his
or her I.Q. is the same as his or her shoe size. The list is end

less, but it is easy to see that prejudices of all kinds exist
everywhere.
"All right, so maybe I do have my prejudices," you say.
"Big deal. Everyone has them, so why should I bother
paying much attention to them? I'm pretty fair to people."
The problem with this kind of attitude is that if you're not
aware of your assumptions they can lead to all sorts of
things. Anything from going along with your friends who
decide to throw the hall "nerd" into the shower "just for the
fun of it" to letting your views about Jews make you look the
other way when someone with more extreme views decides
to do something about the "problem" (it's the often used —
and quite rightly so — example of Nazi Germany).
Prejudices and the desire to avoid anything unfamiliar can
very easily affect not only the person with those views but
the people around him or her.
So what does this have to do with life here at Stanford? It's
just something to keep in mind when you're meeting your
roommates, teachers and classmates. If a person isn't the
same color or studies (or parties) more or less than you do,
you should still try to greet them in the same way you would
someone who does everything "your way." There are a lot
of fun people out there, and you're just as different to them
as they are to you. Try not to assume things about them, and
hopefully, they'll not try to assume things about you. You'll
both discover that the other one is just a person: different in
some ways, the same in others, but not someone to run
away from or be scared of.

Looking down from the hill where Stanford's radio tele
scope dish stands, the red tile roofs of the campus are easy
to see. All of Stanford's buildings have these roofs, in accor
dance with the wishes of Mrs. Leland Stanford, who wanted
to be able to spot Stanford from heaven (or at least so goes
the story that I've heard). Noticing this similarity of roofs —
a similarity that often extends into other parts of the build
ings as well — it is nice to note that this uniformity of archi
tecture does not reflect the composition of the Stanford
community. The diversity of the staff, faculty and students at
this University is so refreshing that I sometimes wonder
whether Mrs. Stanford, after so many years of looking down
at red tile roofs, wouldn't find it a pleasant surprise to see a
bright blue roof appear on one of the newer buildings.

Yet, though Stanford does offer a great variety of people
to interact with, many new arrivals run away from this diver
sity and instead cling — sometimes for their entire time
here — to the familiar. Last year was my freshman year here,
and I remember another freshman in my dorm telling me
that she had just met her roommate, and since they had
"nothing in common," she was going to avoid her as much
as possible. Even before their first conversation, she had
assumed — because of her roommate's looks, hometown,
parents or whatever — that there was no way for the two of
them to get along. The worst thing about this kind of ap
proach is that it isn't just applied to a few select people. Your
classmates, your teammates, everyone you meet is judged in
the same way. Another freshman in my dorm read an ad
vertisement for an ethnic dance and asked: "Why can't they
act like normal people?" This inability even to try to get to
know people who are in some way different from you and
the tendency not even to give them a chance Is harmful not
only to the person looking at things in this way but also to
those with whom this person interacts. What would you do
if your roommate walked into your room for the first time,
looked at the posters you had put up, and quickly walked
out again without even talking to you? Not a happy welcome
