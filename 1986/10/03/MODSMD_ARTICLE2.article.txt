The ASSU Senate last night approved
a resolution calling for a meeting with
University President Donald Kennedy
on Stanford's investments in compan
ies that do business in South Africa.
The resolution also reaffirms the sen
ate's commitment to total divestment.
The resolution, drafted by under
graduate senators Stacey Leyton and
Leonard Adler, cites deteriorating con
ditions in South Africa and the UC
Board of Regents' recent decision to
divest itself of $3.1 billion in South
Africa-related stock.
Leyton said a copy of the resolution
will be delivered to Kennedy today.
The proposed meeting is designed
to allow students the opportunity to
communicate their concerns to Ken
nedy before the next meeting of Stan
ford's Board of Trustees in mid-
October. If Kennedy accepts the invita
tion, he will meet with members of the
faculty, staff and workers in conjunc
tion with students from Stanford Out
of South Africa (SOSA), the Stanford
African Students Association (SASA)
and the Black Student Union (BSU).
SQSA al>o hopes the meeting would
allow Kennedy to explain hfs current
position on divestment, to report on
his recent trip to South Africa and to
"show people that the University cares
about what they think," according to
Carey White of the Council of Presi
dents.
Citing a recent Commission on In

that documents the negative effect of
corporations doing business in South
Africa, the resolution also calls for the
Board of Trustees to put pressure on
those corporations to disinvest.
