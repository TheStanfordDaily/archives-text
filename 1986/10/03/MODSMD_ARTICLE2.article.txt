# ASSU requests Kennedy meeting
## 
### TRICIA WRIGHT 
The ASSU Senate last night approved
a resolution calling for a meeting with
University President Donald Kennedy
on Stanford's investments in compan
ies that do business in South Africa.
The resolution also reaffirms the sen
ate's commitment to total divestment.
The resolution, drafted by under
graduate senators Stacey Leyton and
Leonard Adler, cites deteriorating con
ditions in South Africa and the UC
Board of Regents' recent decision to
divest itself of $3.1 billion in South
Africa-related stock.
Leyton said a copy of the resolution
will be delivered to Kennedy today.
The proposed meeting is designed
to allow students the opportunity to
communicate their concerns to Ken
nedy before the next meeting of Stan
ford's Board of Trustees in mid-
October. If Kennedy accepts the invita
tion, he will meet with members of the
faculty, staff and workers in conjunc
tion with students from Stanford Out
of South Africa (SOSA), the Stanford
African Students Association (SASA)
and the Black Student Union (BSU).
SQSA al>o hopes the meeting would
allow Kennedy to explain hfs current
position on divestment, to report on
his recent trip to South Africa and to
"show people that the University cares
about what they think," according to
Carey White of the Council of Presi
dents.
Citing a recent Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) report
that documents the negative effect of
corporations doing business in South
Africa, the resolution also calls for the
Board of Trustees to put pressure on
those corporations to disinvest.
"The senate and the Board of Trus-
tees need to put force behind the CIR
statement," Leyton said.
The resolution calls on companies
to commit to disinvestment widiin six
months, and it encourages Stanford to

begin divesting of stock in companies
that do not do so by that time.
The ASSU also voted last night to
place all Student Organization Funds
into South Africa-free investments. Pre
viously, those funds were allowed to
remain in University investment pools
because of higher interest rates.
After last spring's special election
calling for fair interest rates for student

organizations, all interest rates will be
the same, regardless of whether funds
are placed in University investments or
in South Africa-free investments. This
removes the need for separate pools
and preserves the senate's original
goal of total divestment.
The senate meets every two weeks
during the school year. Meetings are
open to the public.
