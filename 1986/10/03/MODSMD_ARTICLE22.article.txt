University plans conversion of residence area
The Searsville block, a group of 13 faculty and staff
homes adjoining Roble athletic field and Governor's
Corner, eventually will be converted for academic
use at Stanford.
At its September meeting, the Board of Trustees
approved plans for the University to purchase the
leaseholder interests of the homes for a period of up
to 20 years.
Called the Homeowners Protection Plan, the pro
gram was initially developed when construction
began on the Environmental Safety Facility located
across Campus Drive West from the Searsville block.
The plan allows lessees the option of leasing back
their home until the death of the surviving spouse or,
in the case of those with mortgages, of applying the
remaining balance of the mortgage toward the pur
chase of a another home elsewhere on campus.
The University has already purchased three of the
13 homes, including two from the estates of
deceased residents. The purchase prices, which have
averaged more than $300,000 per home, are based
on appraisals that do not take into account the pres
ence of the Environmental Safety Facility.
All but three of the 16 residents of the homes in
the Searsville block are retired faculty and staff. Most
of the retirees art 70 years or older. The University
expects that remaining leases will be converted to
the new plan over the next 10 to 15 years.
Pair of film series opens
The Discovery Film Series, presented by Stanford
University Events and Services, and the Other

Cultures Film Series, presented by the University's
Bechtel International Center, both begin their 1986-
87 runs next week.
The Discovery Film Series kicks off with two
showings of "Austria" on Monday. A travel documen
tary narrated in person by its producer, Stan Larue,
"Austria" will be shown at 2:30 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium, and again at 7:45 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium.
Larue's film explores the Danube and other major
Austrian rivers and the cities of Innsbruck, Salzburg
and Vienna. He visits the Lippizaner horses of the
Spanish Riding School, the Vienna Woods and the
Austrian Alps.
The film is the first of eight in the Discovery Film
Series. The films are shown the first Monday of each
month October through May.
Tickets are $4.00 for the matinee and $5.00 for the
evening show, available at the door or at the Tresid
der Ticket Office.
The Other Cultures Film Series begins its ninth
season at 7:30 p.m. Thursday with a free showing of
"Beyond the Walls."
Filmed in Israel in 1985 and nominated for an
Academy Award for best foreign film of the year,
"Beyond the Walls" is a prison drama about the Arabs
and Jews who unite against a common captor.
All films in the Other Cultures series are shown in
the original language with subtitles, and there is no
admission charge. The films — features or documen
taries about patterns of life in other countries and
cultures — are shown every Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in
the assembly room of the International Center.
Future films will feature Argentina, Mexico, the
People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

Sievert etchings at International Center
An exhibition of etchings and other works on
paper by young West German artist Claus Sievert will
be on view at Stanford's Bechtel International Center
beginning today and running through Oct. 31
A reception for the artist will be held at the center
from 5-7 p.m. today.
Sievert's etched and painted imagery often derives
from nature and frequently tends toward the surreal.
Common subjects of his work include single trees in
landscapes and other scenes from the California
Sierra, city scenes and interiors with figures.
Since Sievert moved to California from West Ger
many in 1981, his work has been on exhibit at the Ach
enbach Foundation, the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco, several San Francisco art galleries and the
Visitor's Center in Yosemite National Park.
The Bechtel International Center will be open for
viewing of Sievert's work from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m.
weekdays and from noon until 11 p.m. weekends.
Archives seek historical film footage
As the University's Centennial Celebration, which
began last fall and will culminate in 1991, gets into
gear, Stanford Archives curator Roxanne Nilan has
put out an urgent appeal for film footage of Stanford
activities from the University's founding to 1970.
Footage showing Stanford students and faculty over
the years is needed for a variety of Centennial proj
ects, including a 16 mm film. Nilan would like to
make any donated footage a permanent part of Stan
ford's archival collections. Interested persons or
prospective donors should phone Nilan at 723-2952.

Sievert's etched and painted imagery often derives
from nature and frequently tends toward the surreal.
Common subjects of his work include single trees in
landscapes and other scenes from the California
Sierra, city scenes and interiors with figures.
Since Sievert moved to California from West Ger
many in 1981, his work has been on exhibit at the Ach
enbach Foundation, the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco, several San Francisco art galleries and the
Visitor's Center in Yosemite National Park.
The Bechtel International Center will be open for
viewing of Sievert's work from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m.
weekdays and from noon until 11 p.m. weekends.
Archives seek historical film footage
As the University's Centennial Celebration, which
began last fall and will culminate in 1991, gets into
gear, Stanford Archives curator Roxanne Nilan has
put out an urgent appeal for film footage of Stanford
activities from the University's founding to 1970.
Footage showing Stanford students and faculty over
the years is needed for a variety of Centennial proj
ects, including a 16 mm film. Nilan would like to
make any donated footage a permanent part of Stan
ford's archival collections. Interested persons or
prospective donors should phone Nilan at 723-2952.
University plans conversion of residence area
The Searsville block, a group of 13 faculty and staff
homes adjoining Roble athletic field and Governor's
Corner, eventually will be converted for academic
use at Stanford.
At its September meeting, the Board of Trustees
approved plans for the University to purchase the
leaseholder interests of the homes for a period of up
to 20 years.
Called the Homeowners Protection Plan, the pro
gram was initially developed when construction
began on the Environmental Safety Facility located
across Campus Drive West from the Searsville block.
The plan allows lessees the option of leasing back
their home until the death of the surviving spouse or,
in the case of those with mortgages, of applying the
remaining balance of the mortgage toward the pur
chase of a another home elsewhere on campus.
The University has already purchased three of the
13 homes, including two from the estates of
deceased residents. The purchase prices, which have
averaged more than $300,000 per home, are based
on appraisals that do not take into account the pres
ence of the Environmental Safety Facility.
All but three of the 16 residents of the homes in
the Searsville block are retired faculty and staff. Most
of the retirees art 70 years or older. The University
expects that remaining leases will be converted to
the new plan over the next 10 to 15 years.
Pair of film series opens
The Discovery Film Series, presented by Stanford
University Events and Services, and the Other

Cultures Film Series, presented by the University's
Bechtel International Center, both begin their 1986-
87 runs next week.
The Discovery Film Series kicks off with two
showings of "Austria" on Monday. A travel documen
tary narrated in person by its producer, Stan Larue,
"Austria" will be shown at 2:30 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium, and again at 7:45 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium.
Larue's film explores the Danube and other major
Austrian rivers and the cities of Innsbruck, Salzburg
and Vienna. He visits the Lippizaner horses of the
Spanish Riding School, the Vienna Woods and the
Austrian Alps.
The film is the first of eight in the Discovery Film
Series. The films are shown the first Monday of each
month October through May.
Tickets are $4.00 for the matinee and $5.00 for the
evening show, available at the door or at the Tresid
der Ticket Office.
The Other Cultures Film Series begins its ninth
season at 7:30 p.m. Thursday with a free showing of
"Beyond the Walls."
Filmed in Israel in 1985 and nominated for an
Academy Award for best foreign film of the year,
"Beyond the Walls" is a prison drama about the Arabs
and Jews who unite against a common captor.
All films in the Other Cultures series are shown in
the original language with subtitles, and there is no
admission charge. The films — features or documen
taries about patterns of life in other countries and
cultures — are shown every Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in
the assembly room of the International Center.
Future films will feature Argentina, Mexico, the
People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.
