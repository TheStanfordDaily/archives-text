## Could TV really be getting better? Two new dramas point in the right direction 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial Staff 
• Is television getting bener? The answer is a definite
"yes, at least according to Us magazine. Since Us is a
standing member of the sub-literate People maga
zine genre, one hardly need pay attention to its
breathless critical announcements. But I think Us'
•dramatic opinion is of interest, simply because it
seems to mirror a larger popular belief that televi
sion is, if not better, at least more interesting than it
used to be.
This is in part because the three big networks have
become much more aggressive about marketing
their latest models. If "Hill Street Blues" re-wrote the
rules for television quality, then "Miami Vice," like it
or not, has changed the rules for how influential tele
vision can be in popular culture. The worlds of fash
ion, advertising, publishing and rock music have in
some way been affected by the violent razzle-dazzle
of "Miami Vice." Just think of how many times you've
seen Don Johnson's stubble plastered across maga
zine covers in the past year.
The mighty triumvirate of NBC, CBS and ABC has
taken careful note of its success. They realize that the
main reason why "Miami Vice" initially took off was
because the media latched onto it as something dif
ferent, something new to television. And so this year
the networks are courting journalists with relentless
zeal, hyping the new programs as slick, hip creations.
The media has reciprocated by giving television
more coverage than ever before.
A root cause of the networks' current stampede to
promote their new shows is cable TV, the bogey man
of network executives. The networks are belatedly
realizing that they can't compete with cable TV (or
worse yet, the dreaded VCR) if they don't offer some
thing distinctive. Hence their current ad campaigns,
which use pop music, rock video editing techniques,
and a certain tongue-in-cheek humor.
All this promotion is meant to seduce the viewer
Into thinking of the new shows as funnier and more
exciting than anything on cable. It's not true, of
course. The new network fare is just like the old in
that it fails the most basic requirement; these enter
tainments aren't even entertaining, let alone in
formative, illuminating or moving. Basically, they are

unimaginative Xeroxes of the hit of the day,"The
Cosby Show." "The Cosby Show" itself is a rehash of
family sit-com cliches, the only difference being that
the cast is black.
For the above reasons, I'm tempted to write that
television is as dismal and uninspiring as it's ever
been, that any belief otherwise is just hype. Even
cable TV, once hailed as the bringer of light and
goodness to the small screen, seems to be failing
miserably. One major cable network has resorted to
repeating old "Airwolf" episodes to fill its program
ming schedule. So much for that cultural savior.
As someone interested in popular culture,
however, I'm not ready to throw in the towel yet. I'm
even prepared to say that yes, network television
really is making some improvements. They may only
be baby steps so far, but at least they're headed in the
right direction. ("But what about public tv?," you
wail. Let's leave poor, bankrupt PBS out of this. With
the exception of plays, most if not all of the good pro
grams on PBS are British, and it's good domestic
products we're interested in here).
Two new shows are what bring me to this conclu
sion. Judging by their first few episodes, NBC's "L.A.
Law" and "Crime Story" have the potential to
become two of television's best dramas. "L.A. Law" is
co-written and co-created by Steven Bochco, whom
most TV reviewers regard as a messiah of sorts, since
he co-created "Hill Street Blues." While watching
"L.A. Law" you can almost feel yourself being told to
sit up straight and act like an adult, for here there are
no fistfights, shootouts or screaming car chases. The
conflicts and tension comes from watching the char
acters (a group of lawyers in a 'high-powered' law
firm) wrestle with their various legal and personal
problems.
And lord, is the tension exquisite, if the show's
two-hour premiere was anything to go by. Wry obser
vation and black humor dominated the script;
Bochco's pen ryiust drip acid. Directed by Gregory
Hoblit, one of Bochco's "Hill Street" cronies, the
premiere raced along at a whipcord pace, forcing the
viewer to pick up information for himself. The only
sour note came at the sentimental and contrived end
ing, wherein a young lawyer embraces his client, a
black rape victim who also suffers from cancer. It was
a good reminder that whenever Bochco felt like get

ting mushy on "Hill Street" it was time to get up and
check out the refrigerator. But if he can avoid this
flaw in the future, Bochco's "L.A. Law" could go far.
No one will ever accuse "Crime Story" of excessive
sentimentality. The premiere may well have been the
most violent thing I've seen on network television.
The show depicts the efforts of an elite police team
led by Lt. Torello (moodily played by Dennis Farina)
to crack down on organized crime, in particular the
budding network of a young crime boss named Luca
(Anthony Denison). It's set in Chicago in the early
'60s, when Mayor Daley's police force shook down
anyone who so much as looked at them the wrong
way.
The show's creator, Chuck Adamson, actually led
an elite police force in Chicago way back when, so
the show is rooted in a specific time and place,
unlike most shows, which are set in a bland and
probably mythical Middle America. And the sense of
period works heavily in the show's favor. Cops and
crooks alike cruise around in gleaming
Studebakers; shoot-outs take place in cavernous de
partment stores. Executive producer Michael Mann's
style calls for lots of neon and early '60s rhythm
and blues, helping to build the atmosphere.
While there are some silly continuity errors in the
scripts, one thing that sets "Crime Story" apart is that
later this year the setting will shift to Las Vegas in the
'70s. Thus nothing is static on the show. The charac
ters will be allowed to change and grow, and writers
Adamson and Gustave Reininger (who write each
episode) will be able to pursue extended themes and
ideas.
Unfortunately, "Crime Story" is scheduled against
"Moonlighting," so few people may tune in to watch
Luca and Torello act out their rituals of crime and
punishment. The sad irony of this is that the irresistl
ible Maddie and Dave also represent superior televi
sion. Wretched shows still far outnumber good ones,
so it's a waste that viewers should have to decide be
tween two ambitious shows.
This gripe aside, it is possible to look at the current
TV line-up and find some bright spots. The above
mentioned programs do not insult their viewers. If
television is taking baby steps forward now, we can
hope that one day those steps will become manful
strides.

two-hour premiere was anything to go by. Wry obser
vation and black humor dominated the script;
Bochco's pen ryiust drip acid. Directed by Gregory
Hoblit, one of Bochco's "Hill Street" cronies, the
premiere raced along at a whipcord pace, forcing the
viewer to pick up information for himself. The only
sour note came at the sentimental and contrived end
ing, wherein a young lawyer embraces his client, a
black rape victim who also suffers from cancer. It was
a good reminder that whenever Bochco felt like get

ting mushy on "Hill Street" it was time to get up and
check out the refrigerator. But if he can avoid this
flaw in the future, Bochco's "L.A. Law" could go far.
No one will ever accuse "Crime Story" of excessive
sentimentality. The premiere may well have been the
most violent thing I've seen on network television.
The show depicts the efforts of an elite police team
led by Lt. Torello (moodily played by Dennis Farina)
to crack down on organized crime, in particular the
budding network of a young crime boss named Luca
(Anthony Denison). It's set in Chicago in the early
'60s, when Mayor Daley's police force shook down
anyone who so much as looked at them the wrong
way.
The show's creator, Chuck Adamson, actually led
an elite police force in Chicago way back when, so
the show is rooted in a specific time and place,
unlike most shows, which are set in a bland and
probably mythical Middle America. And the sense of
period works heavily in the show's favor. Cops and
crooks alike cruise around in gleaming
Studebakers; shoot-outs take place in cavernous de
partment stores. Executive producer Michael Mann's
style calls for lots of neon and early '60s rhythm
and blues, helping to build the atmosphere.
While there are some silly continuity errors in the
scripts, one thing that sets "Crime Story" apart is that
later this year the setting will shift to Las Vegas in the
'70s. Thus nothing is static on the show. The charac
ters will be allowed to change and grow, and writers
Adamson and Gustave Reininger (who write each
episode) will be able to pursue extended themes and
ideas.
Unfortunately, "Crime Story" is scheduled against
"Moonlighting," so few people may tune in to watch
Luca and Torello act out their rituals of crime and
punishment. The sad irony of this is that the irresistl
ible Maddie and Dave also represent superior televi
sion. Wretched shows still far outnumber good ones,
so it's a waste that viewers should have to decide be
tween two ambitious shows.
This gripe aside, it is possible to look at the current
TV line-up and find some bright spots. The above
mentioned programs do not insult their viewers. If
television is taking baby steps forward now, we can
hope that one day those steps will become manful
strides.
• Is television getting bener? The answer is a definite
"yes, at least according to Us magazine. Since Us is a
standing member of the sub-literate People maga
zine genre, one hardly need pay attention to its
breathless critical announcements. But I think Us'
•dramatic opinion is of interest, simply because it
seems to mirror a larger popular belief that televi
sion is, if not better, at least more interesting than it
used to be.
This is in part because the three big networks have
become much more aggressive about marketing
their latest models. If "Hill Street Blues" re-wrote the
rules for television quality, then "Miami Vice," like it
or not, has changed the rules for how influential tele
vision can be in popular culture. The worlds of fash
ion, advertising, publishing and rock music have in
some way been affected by the violent razzle-dazzle
of "Miami Vice." Just think of how many times you've
seen Don Johnson's stubble plastered across maga
zine covers in the past year.
The mighty triumvirate of NBC, CBS and ABC has
taken careful note of its success. They realize that the
main reason why "Miami Vice" initially took off was
because the media latched onto it as something dif
ferent, something new to television. And so this year
the networks are courting journalists with relentless
zeal, hyping the new programs as slick, hip creations.
The media has reciprocated by giving television
more coverage than ever before.
A root cause of the networks' current stampede to
promote their new shows is cable TV, the bogey man
of network executives. The networks are belatedly
realizing that they can't compete with cable TV (or
worse yet, the dreaded VCR) if they don't offer some
thing distinctive. Hence their current ad campaigns,
which use pop music, rock video editing techniques,
and a certain tongue-in-cheek humor.
All this promotion is meant to seduce the viewer
Into thinking of the new shows as funnier and more
exciting than anything on cable. It's not true, of
course. The new network fare is just like the old in
that it fails the most basic requirement; these enter
tainments aren't even entertaining, let alone in
formative, illuminating or moving. Basically, they are

unimaginative Xeroxes of the hit of the day,"The
Cosby Show." "The Cosby Show" itself is a rehash of
family sit-com cliches, the only difference being that
the cast is black.
For the above reasons, I'm tempted to write that
television is as dismal and uninspiring as it's ever
been, that any belief otherwise is just hype. Even
cable TV, once hailed as the bringer of light and
goodness to the small screen, seems to be failing
miserably. One major cable network has resorted to
repeating old "Airwolf" episodes to fill its program
ming schedule. So much for that cultural savior.
As someone interested in popular culture,
however, I'm not ready to throw in the towel yet. I'm
even prepared to say that yes, network television
really is making some improvements. They may only
be baby steps so far, but at least they're headed in the
right direction. ("But what about public tv?," you
wail. Let's leave poor, bankrupt PBS out of this. With
the exception of plays, most if not all of the good pro
grams on PBS are British, and it's good domestic
products we're interested in here).
Two new shows are what bring me to this conclu
sion. Judging by their first few episodes, NBC's "L.A.
Law" and "Crime Story" have the potential to
become two of television's best dramas. "L.A. Law" is
co-written and co-created by Steven Bochco, whom
most TV reviewers regard as a messiah of sorts, since
he co-created "Hill Street Blues." While watching
"L.A. Law" you can almost feel yourself being told to
sit up straight and act like an adult, for here there are
no fistfights, shootouts or screaming car chases. The
conflicts and tension comes from watching the char
acters (a group of lawyers in a 'high-powered' law
firm) wrestle with their various legal and personal
problems.
