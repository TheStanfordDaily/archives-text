### GINA POE 
What does Nola Darling want?
Sex? Love? It's all and none of the
above in her sexy, man-filled world.
Nola Darling (Tracy Camila Johns)
is very frank with herself about her
own sexual desires. And why
shouldn't Nola be honest with her
self? She's so seductive that her very
walk knocks the socks off the three
lovers (not one, not two, but three)
she invites into the sanctuary of her
bed.

"She's Gotta Have It" depicts a
segment in the life of this rather
promiscuous young woman who
won't be bound to any conventional
role. She knows what she likes, she
knows what she wants, and through
it all she's loyal to herself. Her
good-natured, unromantic soul
provides us with a very modern
look at love, sex and the individual.
The film is fresh and unique.
Writer, director, editor and co-star
Spike Lee has created a surprising
and realistic tale of lovers and their

various poses with the understated
irony of Woody Allen. Without any
preaching or moralizing, Lee tells it
like it is. He isn't afraid to take
chances: He edits one love scene
with innovative splicing, and the
lovers seemingly jump to the beat
of an African drum. At some points
his characters speak directly to the
audience, as if we were interview
ing them about Nola.
In these "interviews," Nola's
lovers introduce themselves. First,
there is the fast-talking, lovable
comic fool Mars (Lee), who wears
his Air Jordan sneakers in bed and
chants, "Baby baby please!" The
more mature, possessive Jamie is
played with superb sensitivity by
Tommy Redmond Hicks. But Greer
Childs, who manages to be both
macho and narcissistic, is a little
overdone by actor John Canada Ter
rell. Childs appeals to Nola, but he
insists on "improving" her too
much. None of the three men are
exactly the ideal mate, but Nola
finds something appealing in each
of them. And to be honest about it,
they do make good love.
Mention should be made of this
film's unusual production record.
Part of its spontaneity could be due
to its rigorous shooting schedule of
12 days, entirely in Brooklyn, under
a miniscule budget of $175,000. It
also has an all-black cast.
There's something in this film for
everyone. The characters are easily
recognizable and just as easy to
relate to. At the screening I atten
ded, the man ahead of me could not
control his bellowing laughter,
while a woman behind me gasped
at some of the racier love scenes. If
these reactions are any indication,
audiences will have a great time at
"She's Gotta Have It." Everyone
should see it for a change from the
typical movie offerings. It's truly en
tertaining and, more than anything
else, it's definitely different.
