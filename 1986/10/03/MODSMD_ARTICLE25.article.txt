Beauty and the Beast (1946)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean Cocteau directs what is perhaps the
greatest of all fairy tale films. Josette Day,
appropriately, is Beauty, and Jean Marais is
her superb Beast. His castle, with live
heads in bas-relief on the walls and hands
that grow out of tables to pour wine for
his guests, is a cross between Gustave
Dore and Salvador Dali.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Nosferatu the Vampyre."

This was big-bucks producer-director
Ivan Reitman's first film without Bill Mur
ray, and while it still made medium-big
bucks, it has a basic problem: It proved
that Bill Murray was the only reason to see
Reitman's movies Robert Redford and
Debra Winger star in this remake of
"Adam s Rib," and while Winger doesn't
necessarily suffer from the comparison to
Katharine Hepburn, Redford is no Spen
cer Tracy. He gives the latest in his series
of non-performances; he's not as terrible
as he was in Out of Africa' only because
his role here, the nobly suffering district
attorney, is the type Redford loves. Winger
isn't nearly as comfortable; she has to play
the super-competent, professional woman
at the same time as she makes gaga eyes
over Redford, and she only occasionally
exhibits her vast naturalistic charm. Darryl
Hannah, in the Judy Holliday role, makes
more of an Impact because she is only
asked to look sultry and victimized. This
entire movie, from the plot to the clothes
to the characters' "cute", eccentricities, has
been programmed by Hollywood to ap
peal to what it perceives as the "yuppie"
market; only people who are happy to
perceive themselves as such could like the
movie.
Plays Sunday night at 7 and 9:30.

Top Gun (1986)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
It's tough to decide which is the more
impressive machine — the fighter (ets that
carom across the wide screen in Dolby
stereo, or the movie itself, which is a su
perbly crafted missile targeting the box of
fice. This picture is nothing more than a
string of terrific commercials for the
armed forces (with a Coca-Cola ad volley
ball game and a Calvin Klein ad love scene
thrown in), and it's the kind of "socko" en
tertainment production executives have
wet dreams about. The screenplay, by Jim
Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., might have been
phoned in, and director Tony Scott, who
began his career making television com
mercials, is certainly the man for the job.
Tom Cruise is a hotshot navy fighter jock
who gets the girl (Kelly McGillis), loses his
best friend, grows as a person, etc., etc.
Hie aerial combat scenes are very impres
sive, and it's literally impossible to tell
when the models take over for the real
jets. There are two good jokes associated
with this production: Jerry Bruckheimer
and Don Simpson, who co-produced
"Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop" and
i now this, still insist that they are risk
takers, who "don't follow trends"; and the
U.S. Navy actually got paid more than $1
million for all this fantastic publicity.

Men
Guild, Menlo Park
Say it slowly now: "German ... com
edy." That's right. And "Men" is funny, in
an updated Lubitsch boudoir-comedy
style. It's a shaggy-man story of a triangle
in which the cuckolded husband moves
out of his house and, incognito, into the
apartment of his wife's lover. The two men
become friends, eventually the wife
comes to visit — you get the picture.
"Men" has pretences toward ideas on men
and women, fidelity and friendship, but it
doesn't deliver; it would be hard to imag
ine a thinner movie than this. But it's well
made, by director Doris Dorrie, and well
acted, particularly by Heiner Lauterbach as
Julius, the husband. Dorrie maintains her
lightly ironic tone right up until the end
ing; perhaps because the movie isn't really
about anything, the final scene is a botch.

Back to School
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
If you like Rodney Dangerfield and his
aggressive, cynical, overbearing style of
humor, then you'll probably like this
movie, which has been strung together as
little more than a showcase for its star.
Even Dangerfield fans may get tired of the
sickly sentimental story — "Back to
School" attempts to give us the warm,
human Rodney Dangerfield underneath
the bluster and only succeeds in showing
us there's nothing there. But the gags are

good enough and frequent enough to
help you forget the plot, in which Danger
field decides to get his college degree as a
way of encouraging his son to stay in
school, and Dangerfield cruises through
the whole thing as if he were in another
movie, anway.

Blue Veb*t
Stanford Theatre, Palo Alto
Director David Lynch comes up with a
provocative, unsettling fantasy of small
town life and coming of age that, finally,
amounts to less than it seems. He's
working with his own story here, after the
travesty of "Dune," and he brings to bear
all of his peculiar, visionary talent: The
picture rides along the edge of the surreal,
and is full of the hallucinatory images and
squeamish intensity characteristic of
Lynch's "Eraserhead" and"The Elephant
Man." Kyle MacLachlan ("Dune") plays a
young man just out of high school in a
nameless Southern town; he becomes in
volved, through sexual curiosity (which in
Lynch's world borders on obsession) and
his own ingenuousness, in the violent and
violently sexual relationship between
torch singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella
Rossellini) and small-time hood Frank
(Dennis Hopper, in an over-the-edge,
maniacal performance). MacLachlan's un
holy curiosity drags Laura Dern, daughter
of a hilarious parody of a '50s TV detective,
into the sordid goings-on. Dern, who is lit
and shot to look pretematurally beautiful,
is the blond soul of innocence, as
opposed to Rossellini and Hopper's
creeping rot; Lynch makes the point that
you can't have one without the other, and
he's trying to make some sort of socio
political connection in his blurring of
1950s and '80s styles and props, but it's
nothing we haven't seen before. He'd be

better off simply letting his imagination
run away with him, as he did in
"Eraserhead." Still, "Blue Velvet" is a tour
de force by a master image-maker.

Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In making his version of "Dracula,"
Werner Herzog was inspired by F.W. Mur
nau's 1922 class "Nosferatu." Herzog's im
agery echoes Murnau's and in some
instances expands on it — as in the creepy
sequences when the streets of Bremen fill
up with coffins. Klaus Kinski gives a fasci
nating performance as the vampire; the
scene in which he stays all night with Lucy
(eerily beautiful Isabelle Adjani) may be
the most unusual piece of erotica in the
history of movies. Lumpy and unevenly
acted as it is (Bruno Ganz makes a vacant
Jonathan Harker), this film contains
flashes of brilliance.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with "Beauty
and the Beast."

The Purple Rose of Cairo (1989)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A marvel. Woody Allen's ineffably sweet
comedy, imaginative and suffused with
feeling, is a full-length variation on one of
his best stories, "The Kugelmass Episode."
Mia Farrow plays Cecilia, a poor working
girl in the New Jersey of the Depression,
married to an insensitive lug (Danny
Aiello) who squanders her wages on craps
and liquor and then brutalizes her. She
returns night after night to the local
moviehouse, the Jewel, to daydream, and
one night a character in a B-movie called
"The Purple Rose of Cairo" steps down off
the screen and declares his love for her.
From that point on the movie operates on

several narrative levels at once. Jeff
Daniels plays both the character, Tom, and
the actor who "created" him, Gil; his
scenes with Mia Farrow in his "fictional"
guise harken hack to the tender looniness
of Felllni's "The White Sheik," and those
between Cecilia and Gil are reminiscent
of "It Happened One Night." The mag
nificent cast includes Edward Herrmann,
Zoe Caldwell, John Wood, Deborah Rush,
Van Johnson, Milo O'Shea, Karen Akers,
Stephanie Farrow, Dianne Wiest and Ir
ving Metzman, but it is Farrow who gives
the movie its soul: The delicate intensity of
her acting recalls Lillian Gish.
Plays tomorrow night with "Zelig."
— S.V
Zelig (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen made this charming movie
about a man whose fear of being
ostracized permits him to change his
features at will to conform to the people
around him. It's a certifiable anomaly:
Zelig's tale is told through the combina
tion of deftly doctored footage from the
1920s and early '30s, present-day inter
views, analytical statements delivered by
contemporary social observers, and
"historical" scenes between Zelig (Allen)
and his psychiatrist-lover (Mia Farrow).
And the tone is a weird hybrid of sage and
lunatic, like the best of Allen's short
stories. "Zelig" lacks the breadth of great
comedy, but for what it is, it's just about
perfect.
Plays tomorrow with "The Purple Rose
of Cairo."

impressive machine — the fighter (ets that
carom across the wide screen in Dolby
stereo, or the movie itself, which is a su
perbly crafted missile targeting the box of
fice. This picture is nothing more than a
string of terrific commercials for the
armed forces (with a Coca-Cola ad volley
ball game and a Calvin Klein ad love scene
thrown in), and it's the kind of "socko" en
tertainment production executives have
wet dreams about. The screenplay, by Jim
Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., might have been
phoned in, and director Tony Scott, who
began his career making television com
mercials, is certainly the man for the job.
Tom Cruise is a hotshot navy fighter jock
who gets the girl (Kelly McGillis), loses his
best friend, grows as a person, etc., etc.
Hie aerial combat scenes are very impres
sive, and it's literally impossible to tell
when the models take over for the real
jets. There are two good jokes associated
with this production: Jerry Bruckheimer
and Don Simpson, who co-produced
"Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop" and
i now this, still insist that they are risk
takers, who "don't follow trends"; and the
U.S. Navy actually got paid more than $1
million for all this fantastic publicity.

Men
Guild, Menlo Park
Say it slowly now: "German ... com
edy." That's right. And "Men" is funny, in
an updated Lubitsch boudoir-comedy
style. It's a shaggy-man story of a triangle
in which the cuckolded husband moves
out of his house and, incognito, into the
apartment of his wife's lover. The two men
become friends, eventually the wife
comes to visit — you get the picture.
"Men" has pretences toward ideas on men
and women, fidelity and friendship, but it
doesn't deliver; it would be hard to imag
ine a thinner movie than this. But it's well
made, by director Doris Dorrie, and well
acted, particularly by Heiner Lauterbach as
Julius, the husband. Dorrie maintains her
lightly ironic tone right up until the end
ing; perhaps because the movie isn't really
about anything, the final scene is a botch.

Back to School
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
If you like Rodney Dangerfield and his
aggressive, cynical, overbearing style of
humor, then you'll probably like this
movie, which has been strung together as
little more than a showcase for its star.
Even Dangerfield fans may get tired of the
sickly sentimental story — "Back to
School" attempts to give us the warm,
human Rodney Dangerfield underneath
the bluster and only succeeds in showing
us there's nothing there. But the gags are

good enough and frequent enough to
help you forget the plot, in which Danger
field decides to get his college degree as a
way of encouraging his son to stay in
school, and Dangerfield cruises through
the whole thing as if he were in another
movie, anway.

Blue Veb*t
Stanford Theatre, Palo Alto
Director David Lynch comes up with a
provocative, unsettling fantasy of small
town life and coming of age that, finally,
amounts to less than it seems. He's
working with his own story here, after the
travesty of "Dune," and he brings to bear
all of his peculiar, visionary talent: The
picture rides along the edge of the surreal,
and is full of the hallucinatory images and
squeamish intensity characteristic of
Lynch's "Eraserhead" and"The Elephant
Man." Kyle MacLachlan ("Dune") plays a
young man just out of high school in a
nameless Southern town; he becomes in
volved, through sexual curiosity (which in
Lynch's world borders on obsession) and
his own ingenuousness, in the violent and
violently sexual relationship between
torch singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella
Rossellini) and small-time hood Frank
(Dennis Hopper, in an over-the-edge,
maniacal performance). MacLachlan's un
holy curiosity drags Laura Dern, daughter
of a hilarious parody of a '50s TV detective,
into the sordid goings-on. Dern, who is lit
and shot to look pretematurally beautiful,
is the blond soul of innocence, as
opposed to Rossellini and Hopper's
creeping rot; Lynch makes the point that
you can't have one without the other, and
he's trying to make some sort of socio
political connection in his blurring of
1950s and '80s styles and props, but it's
nothing we haven't seen before. He'd be

better off simply letting his imagination
run away with him, as he did in
"Eraserhead." Still, "Blue Velvet" is a tour
de force by a master image-maker.

Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In making his version of "Dracula,"
Werner Herzog was inspired by F.W. Mur
nau's 1922 class "Nosferatu." Herzog's im
agery echoes Murnau's and in some
instances expands on it — as in the creepy
sequences when the streets of Bremen fill
up with coffins. Klaus Kinski gives a fasci
nating performance as the vampire; the
scene in which he stays all night with Lucy
(eerily beautiful Isabelle Adjani) may be
the most unusual piece of erotica in the
history of movies. Lumpy and unevenly
acted as it is (Bruno Ganz makes a vacant
Jonathan Harker), this film contains
flashes of brilliance.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with "Beauty
and the Beast."
— S.V.
The Purple Rose of Cairo (1989)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A marvel. Woody Allen's ineffably sweet
comedy, imaginative and suffused with
feeling, is a full-length variation on one of
his best stories, "The Kugelmass Episode."
Mia Farrow plays Cecilia, a poor working
girl in the New Jersey of the Depression,
married to an insensitive lug (Danny
Aiello) who squanders her wages on craps
and liquor and then brutalizes her. She
returns night after night to the local
moviehouse, the Jewel, to daydream, and
one night a character in a B-movie called
"The Purple Rose of Cairo" steps down off
the screen and declares his love for her.
From that point on the movie operates on

several narrative levels at once. Jeff
Daniels plays both the character, Tom, and
the actor who "created" him, Gil; his
scenes with Mia Farrow in his "fictional"
guise harken hack to the tender looniness
of Felllni's "The White Sheik," and those
between Cecilia and Gil are reminiscent
of "It Happened One Night." The mag
nificent cast includes Edward Herrmann,
Zoe Caldwell, John Wood, Deborah Rush,
Van Johnson, Milo O'Shea, Karen Akers,
Stephanie Farrow, Dianne Wiest and Ir
ving Metzman, but it is Farrow who gives
the movie its soul: The delicate intensity of
her acting recalls Lillian Gish.
Plays tomorrow night with "Zelig."

Zelig (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen made this charming movie
about a man whose fear of being
ostracized permits him to change his
features at will to conform to the people
around him. It's a certifiable anomaly:
Zelig's tale is told through the combina
tion of deftly doctored footage from the
1920s and early '30s, present-day inter
views, analytical statements delivered by
contemporary social observers, and
"historical" scenes between Zelig (Allen)
and his psychiatrist-lover (Mia Farrow).
And the tone is a weird hybrid of sage and
lunatic, like the best of Allen's short
stories. "Zelig" lacks the breadth of great
comedy, but for what it is, it's just about
perfect.
Plays tomorrow with "The Purple Rose
of Cairo."

Beauty and the Beast (1946)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean Cocteau directs what is perhaps the
greatest of all fairy tale films. Josette Day,
appropriately, is Beauty, and Jean Marais is
her superb Beast. His castle, with live
heads in bas-relief on the walls and hands
that grow out of tables to pour wine for
his guests, is a cross between Gustave
Dore and Salvador Dali.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Nosferatu the Vampyre."

Memorial Auditorium
This was big-bucks producer-director
Ivan Reitman's first film without Bill Mur
ray, and while it still made medium-big
bucks, it has a basic problem: It proved
that Bill Murray was the only reason to see
Reitman's movies Robert Redford and
Debra Winger star in this remake of
"Adam s Rib," and while Winger doesn't
necessarily suffer from the comparison to
Katharine Hepburn, Redford is no Spen
cer Tracy. He gives the latest in his series
of non-performances; he's not as terrible
as he was in Out of Africa' only because
his role here, the nobly suffering district
attorney, is the type Redford loves. Winger
isn't nearly as comfortable; she has to play
the super-competent, professional woman
at the same time as she makes gaga eyes
over Redford, and she only occasionally
exhibits her vast naturalistic charm. Darryl
Hannah, in the Judy Holliday role, makes
more of an Impact because she is only
asked to look sultry and victimized. This
entire movie, from the plot to the clothes
to the characters' "cute", eccentricities, has
been programmed by Hollywood to ap
peal to what it perceives as the "yuppie"
market; only people who are happy to
perceive themselves as such could like the
movie.

made, by director Doris Dorrie, and well
acted, particularly by Heiner Lauterbach as
Julius, the husband. Dorrie maintains her
lightly ironic tone right up until the end
ing; perhaps because the movie isn't really
about anything, the final scene is a botch.

Back to School
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
If you like Rodney Dangerfield and his
aggressive, cynical, overbearing style of
humor, then you'll probably like this
movie, which has been strung together as
little more than a showcase for its star.
Even Dangerfield fans may get tired of the
sickly sentimental story — "Back to
School" attempts to give us the warm,
human Rodney Dangerfield underneath
the bluster and only succeeds in showing
us there's nothing there. But the gags are

good enough and frequent enough to
help you forget the plot, in which Danger
field decides to get his college degree as a
way of encouraging his son to stay in
school, and Dangerfield cruises through
the whole thing as if he were in another
movie, anway.

Blue Veb*t
Stanford Theatre, Palo Alto
Director David Lynch comes up with a
provocative, unsettling fantasy of small
town life and coming of age that, finally,
amounts to less than it seems. He's
working with his own story here, after the
travesty of "Dune," and he brings to bear
all of his peculiar, visionary talent: The
picture rides along the edge of the surreal,
and is full of the hallucinatory images and
squeamish intensity characteristic of
Lynch's "Eraserhead" and"The Elephant
Man." Kyle MacLachlan ("Dune") plays a
young man just out of high school in a
nameless Southern town; he becomes in
volved, through sexual curiosity (which in
Lynch's world borders on obsession) and
his own ingenuousness, in the violent and
violently sexual relationship between
torch singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella
Rossellini) and small-time hood Frank
(Dennis Hopper, in an over-the-edge,
maniacal performance). MacLachlan's un
holy curiosity drags Laura Dern, daughter
of a hilarious parody of a '50s TV detective,
into the sordid goings-on. Dern, who is lit
and shot to look pretematurally beautiful,
is the blond soul of innocence, as
opposed to Rossellini and Hopper's
creeping rot; Lynch makes the point that
you can't have one without the other, and
he's trying to make some sort of socio
political connection in his blurring of
1950s and '80s styles and props, but it's
nothing we haven't seen before. He'd be

better off simply letting his imagination
run away with him, as he did in
"Eraserhead." Still, "Blue Velvet" is a tour
de force by a master image-maker.

Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In making his version of "Dracula,"
Werner Herzog was inspired by F.W. Mur
nau's 1922 class "Nosferatu." Herzog's im
agery echoes Murnau's and in some
instances expands on it — as in the creepy
sequences when the streets of Bremen fill
up with coffins. Klaus Kinski gives a fasci
nating performance as the vampire; the
scene in which he stays all night with Lucy
(eerily beautiful Isabelle Adjani) may be
the most unusual piece of erotica in the
history of movies. Lumpy and unevenly
acted as it is (Bruno Ganz makes a vacant
Jonathan Harker), this film contains
flashes of brilliance.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with "Beauty
and the Beast."

The Purple Rose of Cairo (1989)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A marvel. Woody Allen's ineffably sweet
comedy, imaginative and suffused with
feeling, is a full-length variation on one of
his best stories, "The Kugelmass Episode."
Mia Farrow plays Cecilia, a poor working
girl in the New Jersey of the Depression,
married to an insensitive lug (Danny
Aiello) who squanders her wages on craps
and liquor and then brutalizes her. She
returns night after night to the local
moviehouse, the Jewel, to daydream, and
one night a character in a B-movie called
"The Purple Rose of Cairo" steps down off
the screen and declares his love for her.
From that point on the movie operates on

several narrative levels at once. Jeff
Daniels plays both the character, Tom, and
the actor who "created" him, Gil; his
scenes with Mia Farrow in his "fictional"
guise harken hack to the tender looniness
of Felllni's "The White Sheik," and those
between Cecilia and Gil are reminiscent
of "It Happened One Night." The mag
nificent cast includes Edward Herrmann,
Zoe Caldwell, John Wood, Deborah Rush,
Van Johnson, Milo O'Shea, Karen Akers,
Stephanie Farrow, Dianne Wiest and Ir
ving Metzman, but it is Farrow who gives
the movie its soul: The delicate intensity of
her acting recalls Lillian Gish.
Plays tomorrow night with "Zelig."

Zelig (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen made this charming movie
about a man whose fear of being
ostracized permits him to change his
features at will to conform to the people
around him. It's a certifiable anomaly:
Zelig's tale is told through the combina
tion of deftly doctored footage from the
1920s and early '30s, present-day inter
views, analytical statements delivered by
contemporary social observers, and
"historical" scenes between Zelig (Allen)
and his psychiatrist-lover (Mia Farrow).
And the tone is a weird hybrid of sage and
lunatic, like the best of Allen's short
stories. "Zelig" lacks the breadth of great
comedy, but for what it is, it's just about
perfect.
Plays tomorrow with "The Purple Rose
of Cairo."

Beauty and the Beast (1946)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean Cocteau directs what is perhaps the
greatest of all fairy tale films. Josette Day,
appropriately, is Beauty, and Jean Marais is
her superb Beast. His castle, with live
heads in bas-relief on the walls and hands
that grow out of tables to pour wine for
his guests, is a cross between Gustave
Dore and Salvador Dali.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Nosferatu the Vampyre."

Legal Eagles
Memorial Auditorium
This was big-bucks producer-director
Ivan Reitman's first film without Bill Mur
ray, and while it still made medium-big
bucks, it has a basic problem: It proved
that Bill Murray was the only reason to see
Reitman's movies Robert Redford and
Debra Winger star in this remake of
"Adam s Rib," and while Winger doesn't
necessarily suffer from the comparison to
Katharine Hepburn, Redford is no Spen
cer Tracy. He gives the latest in his series
of non-performances; he's not as terrible
as he was in Out of Africa' only because
his role here, the nobly suffering district
attorney, is the type Redford loves. Winger
isn't nearly as comfortable; she has to play
the super-competent, professional woman
at the same time as she makes gaga eyes
over Redford, and she only occasionally
exhibits her vast naturalistic charm. Darryl
Hannah, in the Judy Holliday role, makes
more of an Impact because she is only
asked to look sultry and victimized. This
entire movie, from the plot to the clothes
to the characters' "cute", eccentricities, has
been programmed by Hollywood to ap
peal to what it perceives as the "yuppie"
market; only people who are happy to
perceive themselves as such could like the
movie.
Plays Sunday night at 7 and 9:30.

Top Gun (1986)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
It's tough to decide which is the more
impressive machine — the fighter (ets that
carom across the wide screen in Dolby
stereo, or the movie itself, which is a su
perbly crafted missile targeting the box of
fice. This picture is nothing more than a
string of terrific commercials for the
armed forces (with a Coca-Cola ad volley
ball game and a Calvin Klein ad love scene
thrown in), and it's the kind of "socko" en
tertainment production executives have
wet dreams about. The screenplay, by Jim
Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., might have been
phoned in, and director Tony Scott, who
began his career making television com
mercials, is certainly the man for the job.
Tom Cruise is a hotshot navy fighter jock
who gets the girl (Kelly McGillis), loses his
best friend, grows as a person, etc., etc.
Hie aerial combat scenes are very impres
sive, and it's literally impossible to tell
when the models take over for the real
jets. There are two good jokes associated
with this production: Jerry Bruckheimer
and Don Simpson, who co-produced
"Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop" and
i now this, still insist that they are risk
takers, who "don't follow trends"; and the
U.S. Navy actually got paid more than $1
million for all this fantastic publicity.

Men
Guild, Menlo Park
Say it slowly now: "German ... com
edy." That's right. And "Men" is funny, in
an updated Lubitsch boudoir-comedy
style. It's a shaggy-man story of a triangle
in which the cuckolded husband moves
out of his house and, incognito, into the
apartment of his wife's lover. The two men
become friends, eventually the wife
comes to visit — you get the picture.
"Men" has pretences toward ideas on men
and women, fidelity and friendship, but it
doesn't deliver; it would be hard to imag
ine a thinner movie than this. But it's well
made, by director Doris Dorrie, and well
acted, particularly by Heiner Lauterbach as
Julius, the husband. Dorrie maintains her
lightly ironic tone right up until the end
ing; perhaps because the movie isn't really
about anything, the final scene is a botch.
