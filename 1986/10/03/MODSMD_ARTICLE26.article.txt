### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
"Stanford is the long distance capital of the world this
weekend," Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson said, describing
the 13th Annual Stanford Cross Country Invitational that gets
under way tomorrow at 10 a.m. at the golf course.
The Cardinal men's squad will seek to defend its Invita
tional championship, while the women aim for their sixth
consecutive title. More than 35 college teams from across
the country will assemble at the 5,000-meter course.
"This will be an exciting and colorful meet," Johnson
said. "There are a lot of interesting mixes."
Topping the list of runners to watch are Stanford's Marc
Olesen and North Carolina State's Suzie Tuffy, who won the
NCAA championship last fall at Marquette with a time of
16:22.53. Tuffy will join teammates Stacy Belotta and Janet
Smith to make up the strongest trio of runners from any
school.
Olesen, the senior caiptain of the Cardinal men's team,
placed fourth at the NCAA championship last year and is the
top-scoring runner returning to NCAA competition this
season.
"We have a good chance Saturday," Johnson said.
In the "Meeting of the Minds" at Cambridge two weeks
ago, where Stanford met Harvard, Rice and Northwestern,
both the men's and women's teams emerged victorious, a
feat they hope to duplicate this weekend.

"It will be an interesting and revealing meet where the
runners will show how they perform in national competi
tion," Johnson said.
In last year's Stanford Invitational, Cardinal runners took
top honors in both the men's and women's divisions, with
the women winning for the fifth-straight time.
Four Stanford men placed in the top six, as the Cardinal
downed UC-Irvine. Oleson and Ryan Stoll, both returning
for Stanford, tied for first in 1985's individual competition.
Jennifer Abraham of Irvine is die top returning female run
ner.
Along with North Carolina State, three other top-ranked
teams will compete on the women's side. UCLA, sixth at last
year's NCAAs, ninth-place BYU and No. 15 Clemson will all
participate, along with Arkansas, California, Fresno State,
USC, Arizona State and local teams such as St. Mary's, Uni
versity of San Francisco, San Francisco State and UC-Davis.
On the men's side, North Carolina State and UCLA figure
to challenge Stanford's title defense. Arizona State, Texas-El
Paso, Fresno State, Irvine, San Diego State and USC are
other strong teams. Local schools include San Jose State,
Chico State, USF and Santa Clara.
Cross-country competition resumes Monday, as over
2,000 high school athletes from California and Nevada com
pete in the finale of the Stanford Invitational.
The meet will start at 1 p.m. at the Stanford Golf Course
and continue throughout the afternoon.
