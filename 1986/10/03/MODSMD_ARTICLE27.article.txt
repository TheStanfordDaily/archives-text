# Undefeated water polo hosts NorCal Tourney
## 24-game win streak on line for Card 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
After beginning the season with 14
road wins on its way to a 15-0 record,
the defending national champion
Stanford men's water polo team will
open its home schedule today and
tomorrow, hosting a nine-team field
in the Northern California Water
Polo Tournament at DeGuerre Pool.
With a field comprised of six top
-20 teams, including No. 2 California,
the tournament offers fans the possi
bility of witnessing the two top teams
in the country squaring off.
"The guys are pretty excited about
being home," Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti said. "It is the first chance
for everyone to see us play. We are
the No. 1 ranked team in the nation,
and no one around here has seen us
play yet."

Today's Cardinal games are at
10:20 a.m. against 20th-ranked UC-
Davis and 1:50 p.m. against 15th
ranked University of the Pacific. Stan
ford will most likely face ninth
ranked Fresno State tomorrow at
8:00 a.m. and Cal, in the biggest con
test of the weekend, tomorrow at
11:30 a.m.
The Cal match is a preview of the
Pacific-10 Conference opener against
the Bears next Friday. It may also be
payback time for the Cardinal, as Cal
defeated Stanford to win the tourna
ment last season.
"The toughest game for us will be
Berkeley," Dettamanti said. "The
guys will remember losing to them
last year."
After winning the NCAA cham
pionship last season with a 25-4
record, the Cardinal has, believe it or
not, improved tremendously and is

eyeing an undefeated season and a
second-straight NCAA title.
Perhaps the biggest improvement
since last season has been the
defense, particularly at the goalie po
sition.
Junior Obi Greenman and sopho
more Todd Kemp share the
goalkeeping duties. Each keeper has
a different style, making it tougher
on opponents to settle in on a partic
ular brand of play.
"The other team doesn't know
which goalie will start," Dettamanti
said. "Just when you get used to one,
you throw in the other."
"The goalies seem to like it that
way (each playing one half)," Detta
manti added. "I haven't noticed any
difference between one or the other.
I think we have the best goalie com

bination in the country, and we might
even have the two best goalies in the
country."
Stanford returns nine of its top 11
scorers from last year, including 1985
Pac-10 Player of the Year Craig Klass
and three-time All-America and team
captain Dave Imbernino. Klass has
tallied 40 goals already this year, with
Imbernino scoring 24. Junior Erich Fis
cher is having his best season to date,
having scored 35 goals thus far.
If the first few weeks are any indica
tion of things to come, Stanford might
very well attain its goal of matching the
1981 Cardinal team's perfect season.
They have been dominating the op
position, including wins over every
team rated in the top five.
