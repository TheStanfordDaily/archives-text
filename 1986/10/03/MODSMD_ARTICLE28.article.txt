# Hopeful women's field hockey takes on talented Pacific team in NorPac contest
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
At about this time last year, the Stan
ford field hockey team was 1-3-1, in
cluding a 0-1-1 record in Northern
Pacific Conference play, and had
recently completed an eastern road
trip on which it went 1-2.
The Cardinal did not appear to be
headed for a very successful season,
but then it took off on a nine-game
winning streak that gave it the NorPac
championship and a 10-3-1 regular
season mark.
Now Stanford has an overall record

of 2-4-1 and a 0-1-1 mark in the NorPac.
The Cardinal is once again coming off
an eastern road trip. This one included
four games against teams in the na
tion's top 20.
Isn't this what is known as deja vu?
"I certainly hope so," Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "The con
ference season is just beginning. We
still have plenty of time to win the con
ference."
Stanford will attempt to begin an
other late-season today when it
hosts the University of the Pacific at 2
p.m. The Tigers are currently 2-0 in the

NorPac and 3-3 overall. Their league
wins include a home victory over
Chico State and a road triumph over
San Jose State, which beat Stanford 3-1
on Wednesday.
Donna Bonino has been UOP's main
offensive threat, scoring three goals.
Lisa Bocchino has added two for the
Tigers.
Stanford's attack has been paced by
senior co-captain Andi Wolpert, who
has two goals and an assist for the
season. Wolpert has also provided
teammates Laura Gartland (two goals)
and Kathy Thomas (one goaljr with

scoring opportunities on rebound
shots.
Johnson did not offer any complex
strategy for today's game. "We'll need a
lot of teamwork and hustle that we
showed back East," she said. "We (ust
have to play more consistently now "
Tomorrow's game will mark the
Cardinal's sixth outing in the last two
weeks. Stanford embarks on a light
schedule following the UOP game,
with its next action being the following
Saturday at Chico State.
The Cardinal travels to Berkeley for
the Cal Invitational Oct. 16-18.
