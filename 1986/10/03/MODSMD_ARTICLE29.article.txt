# The
						Greek returns for another season
## Stanford unanimous choice of all eight 
### 
Tradition never dies. And neither
does The Daily's Greek of the Week.
As is customary here at the Penin
sula's largest morning paper, every'
Friday of the college football season
will see Daily writers and editors trying
their hand at picking the winners of 10
of the top games across the nation.
We will also feature a Guest Greek
every week, selected from the Stanford
community. Last year's guests were
headlined by University President
Donald Kennedy and Dean of Admis
sions Jean Fetter.
Also, look for a contest Big Game
week for a lucky reader to win dinner
for two at a fine area restaurant and
become the Guest Greek for the final
week of the season.
Daily writer John Lis had the best
record last year, finishing 50-20 for a
phenomenal .714 percentage, though
he had to hold off a late-season drive
by former Sports Editor Pete Haven,
who finished 48-22.
In honor of his fine performance last

season, Haven has been asked back to
kick off the new season.
Haven picked Stanford to come
away with a 27-13 win tomorrow and
atone for last year's debacle in his
home town of San Diego. "The Stan
ford defense has really played incredi
bly," Haven said. "I don't even know if
they will give up a touchdown. And the
offense should score even more if Jeff
James is healthy."
He also went on to pick Notre Dame
over Alabama in Tuscaloosa ("I think
they're due,"he said) and UCLA over
Arizona State.
Last year, several readers asked us to
print point spreads with the selections.
Doing so would imply that we
condone gambling on college athletics
and cannot appreciate the games for
their own innate drama. For those who
would use our selections to help in
winning dorm football pools or other
such criminal activities on this campus,
we have only one suggestion: call a
Reno bookmaker.
