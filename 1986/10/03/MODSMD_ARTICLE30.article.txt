# Soccer hosts Westmont, seeks to avoid shutout
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The Stanford men s soccer team
has several goals for tomorrow's
game against Westmont College.
What is hoped is that the team gets
those goals on the scoreboard.
The Cardinal has been shut out in
its last four games, dropping its
record to 3-5-2, 0-2 in the Pacific Soc
cer Conference. With its next two
games against non-league oppo
nents, Westmont and UC-Davis, Stan
ford will be hoping to kick its of
fense into gear before conference

play resumes with a game against St.
Mary's.
It is a tribute to senior goalie Tom
Austin (and the Stanford defense)
that the Cardinal did not lose all four
of those last games. Austin's shutout
of Portland on Sept. 24 gave Stanford
a tie before Stanford grudgingly
allowed two goals to defending na
tional champion UCLA and one to
Washington in consecutive losses
last week.
Austin now has a goals-against
average of 1.51 this season, and,
were it not for a four-goal half early
in September against Cal Poly-San

Luis Obispo, he would have an
average of 1.10.
Unfortunately, the offense has
struggled to only nine goals in the
season's 10 games despite having
outshot its opponents, 128-99. This is
partly because midfielder Pat Sheehy
and forward Tim Westergren have
been sidelined with stress fractures.
Forward Juan Garcia leads the
Cardinal with five points on two
goals and one assist, while forwards
Ross Torres, Jim Cole and Kevin
Woodhouse each have four points.
Tomorrow's game begins at 11
a.m. at Harrv Maloney Field.
