BOSTON (AF) — Boston third
baseman Wade Boggs, bidding for his
third American League batting title,
was scratched from the Boston lineup
Thursday hours before the Red Sox'
scheduled game with the New York
Yankees.
Boggs said he has a tear in his right
hamstring muscle and he will sit out
two games with the Yankees before
making a decision on whether he will
play in the final two games of the
season (Saturday and Sunday).
"My right hamsting has been bother
ing me for 10 days," said Boggs, whose
.357 average leads New York's Don

Mattingly by seven points. "I thought it
was a knot, but Dr. (Arthur) Pappas
looked at it yesterday (Wednesday)
and said 'there is a tear in there.'
"If 1 went out there and did what I
did last night it might spread and I
might miss the playoffs," he added.
"The playoffs are something I've
looked forward to all season, I don't
want to miss them.
"The tear is about the size of a quar
ter, and hopefully it won't get any
worse."
