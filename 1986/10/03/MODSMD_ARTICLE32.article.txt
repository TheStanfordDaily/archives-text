# Spikers on road again
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
You'd think that one of the pre
eminent collegiate women's volleyball
programs in the history of the sport
would he allowed to play a little volley
ball in its own gym once in a while.
Well, for this year's edition of Cardinal
volleyball, you'd be wrong.
Of its first nine games, Stanford was
in foreign arenas for eight, and after
the extreme luxury of two home
games last weekend, the squad is back
on the road. On this trip, the Cardinal
will be exploring especially unfriendly
territory.
Tonight, Stanford's 6-5 record and
No. 13 ranking will be challenged by
Arizona, a team that, like Stanford, is
adjusting to a new game plan after the
graduation of its best player ever.
Tomorrow evening, No. 7 Arizona
State will welcome the Cardinal to its
home for a match that could make or
break Stanford's drive back toward the
top of women's volleyball.
Last fall's team, which finished the
season 28-3, had a tough time on its
journey south, its both the Wildcats and
Sun Devils stretched Stanford to five
games. The Cardinal won its fifth game
versus the Wildcats, 15-9, but lost the
rubber game to Arizona State, 16-14.
Stanford Coach Don Shaw does not
have fond memories of that ordeal.
"We didn't have a real good week'end
down there," he said. "Everybody
seemed a little fatigued."
Stanford will meet an Arizona team
that is drastically different from the
one it met last year, thanks to the
graduation of All-America, anil now
U.S. National Team member, Missy
McLinden. According to Shaw, McLin
den was to recent Wildcat squads what
sophomore All-America Elaina Oden is

to NCAA-champ University of the
Pacific. Not only did McLinden lead the
1985 Wildcats in kills, but she led in
blocks and digs as well.
Arizona State returns five starters
from last fall's 22-13 NCAA-qualifying
team. All-America Tammy Webb leads

the team from her middle blocker po
sition and played with the U.S. National
Team over the summer. Setter Regina
Stahl and three hitters are back as well,
making the Sun Devils a very experi
enced and smooth unit, according to
Shaw.

well remember the Arizona road trip last year when then-No. 1 Stanford
was shocked by ASU and narrowly avoided an Arizona State upset.
