## 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
Beginning this week, University students will have at their
fingertips a wealth of information on 90 different health top
ics and upcoming events.
By logging-in on LOTS, typing in "Health-Net" and hitting
return, students will enter the world of Stanford Health-Net,
a "health promotion network" that has been two years in
the making.
Health-Net is the brainchild of Dr. Paul Walters, directer
of Cowell Student Health Services, and Tom Robinson, now
a fourth-year medical student at Stanford.
Robinson said he hopes everyone will use the new health
network. "We feel we've designed something anyone can
use," he said.
Once logged on to Health-Net, students can choose from
any of its four components: "Self-Help-Info," " News-Events-
Resources," "Bulletin-Board" and "Gripes-and-Status."
If the user selects "Self-Help-Info," he or she can inquire
about any or all of the 90 health topics currently available

through the 12 subheadings. Health-Net provider some
basic information on each of these topics, and about lull ot
them allow the user to enter an interactive question/answer
session in which the computer asks yes-or-no questions
about symptoms related to a health problem. At the end of
such a session, the computer may suggest a course of action,
such as obtaining immediate medical attention, going to
Cowell or trying a certain kind of home treatment.
Subheadings and health topics include: colds and com
mon problems such as hay fever and flu; digestive problems
such as diarrhea, nausea and vomitting; skin prob'ems such
as athlete's foot, sunburn, acne and poison oak; bone,
muscle and joint problems such as sprains and tennis el
bow; women's health with 14 topics; men's health with 6
topics; birth control; and AIDS and other sexually transmit
ted diseases.
Of the latter topics, "people feel less comfortable talking
about these," Robinson said. He said he thinks many stu
dents will inquire about these topics through Health-Net be
cause it is "anonymous and easily accessible anytime, day or
night."
