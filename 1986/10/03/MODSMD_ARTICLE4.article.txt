Changes in the federal income tax code may make some
scholarship and fellowship money taxable, University
Provost James Rosse told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
In other business at the meeting, the 19th Faculty Senate's
first, two faculty representatives told Rosse they object to the
design proposed for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
The 57-member deliberative body represents Stanford's
1,320 professors.
The two senators, Political Science Prof. David Abernethy
and Electrical Engineering Prof. Anthony Siegman, were
told that their concerns would be transmitted to the Board
of Trustees during its meeting in mid-October.
Senators also learned of two resignations: Law School
Dean John Ely has asked to be replaced when his five-year
term expires next summer; and Lee Zeigler, director of the
Bechtel International Center for 17 years, has said he will
quit next year.
Three provisions of the new tax laws will affect students,
Rosse said, but none of the changes are expected to affect
students during the 1986-87 academic year.
Graduate students face the biggest change. Under the cur
rent tax code, the money earned from degree-related re
search or teaching is tax-exempt.
The new code would tax those earnings if they exceeded
the amount needed to pay tuition. In addition, all graduate
assistantships could become fully taxable after Jan. 1,1988, if
a controversial section of the code is not extended.
