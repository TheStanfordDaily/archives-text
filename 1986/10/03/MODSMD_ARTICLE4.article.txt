# Tax effects addressed Profs, object to library

### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Changes in the federal income tax code may make some
scholarship and fellowship money taxable, University
Provost James Rosse told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
In other business at the meeting, the 19th Faculty Senate's
first, two faculty representatives told Rosse they object to the
design proposed for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
The 57-member deliberative body represents Stanford's
1,320 professors.
The two senators, Political Science Prof. David Abernethy
and Electrical Engineering Prof. Anthony Siegman, were
told that their concerns would be transmitted to the Board
of Trustees during its meeting in mid-October.
Senators also learned of two resignations: Law School
Dean John Ely has asked to be replaced when his five-year
term expires next summer; and Lee Zeigler, director of the
Bechtel International Center for 17 years, has said he will
quit next year.
Three provisions of the new tax laws will affect students,
Rosse said, but none of the changes are expected to affect
students during the 1986-87 academic year.
Graduate students face the biggest change. Under the cur
rent tax code, the money earned from degree-related re
search or teaching is tax-exempt.
The new code would tax those earnings if they exceeded
the amount needed to pay tuition. In addition, all graduate
assistantships could become fully taxable after Jan. 1,1988, if
a controversial section of the code is not extended.
Elizabeth Traugott, dean of Graduate
Studies, said her office is preparing a
statement to explain the new law's im
pact, but said many of the bill's details
will remain vague until they are
translated into legal language.
The new law also phases out, over a
five-year period, the tax deduction for
interest paid on student loans, Rosse
said.
The new code would also tax schol
arships and fellowships that exceed
tuition and "related expenses." The
Public Affairs Office said "related ex
penses" cover fees, books and equip
ment required for enrollment or for
particular courses.
Under current law, "students en
rolled in educational programs which
counted toward their degree were
relieved from paying income tax on
any part of any scholarship or fellow
ship received," according to an analy
sis prepared by the Public Affairs Of
fice.
Limits on tax-exempt bonds could
cramp Stanford's current financing
techniques. The University relies heav
ily on tax-exempt bonds to finance
major projects. Under the new bill,
private, non-profit institutions could
have only $150 million outstanding at
any one time.
Fortunately for the University, it won
a one-time exemption that permits an
additional $105 million in bonds to be
issued to help pay for the revamping of
Near West Campus science facilities.
That project is expected to cost $250
million.
One of the most expensive changes
for the University will be a provision

requiring the restructuring of em
ployee pension programs, Rosse said.
Following the tax presentation, Sieg
man told Rosse he opposed a 350- to
400-seat auditorium that he said could
convert the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library into the Ronald Reagan Presi
dential Library and Conference Center.
Siegman lives on Junipero Serra
Boulevard near the planned library
site.
He said the auditorium was not ne
cessary in an archival library and
would serve no academic purpose,
since it would be located three times
as far from the Inner Quad as any of
the campus' other major auditoriums.
Current plans call for the library to
be built above Junipero Serra
Boulevard, south and west of Lake
Lagunita.
Siegman said the auditorium would
doubtlessly be used if it were built, but
the only other uses he could imagine
— for conferences or presentations to
busloads of tourists — would violate
current agreements about the library's
nature and purpose.
Abernethy, who served as the faculty
representative on the Ronald Reagan
Library Commission, said he opposes a
two-floor building. He said the com
mission, which planned the building,
approved the site off Junipero Serra
Boulevard on the condition that its
visibility be reduced.
The building's now-planned second
floor would be visible from a long
stretch of Junipero Serra Boulevard
and from Lake Lagunita, Abernethy
said.
Rosse also said the University will
not lose money due to a change in
federal reimbursement for research.
