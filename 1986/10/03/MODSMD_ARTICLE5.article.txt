# Admissions policy: no bias toward gays

### DAN DE LUCE Staff writer 
Sexual orientation will not be considered in
graduate and undergraduate admissions at Stan
ford, University President Donald Kennedy an
nounced in June. This addition to the non
discrimination policy came 11 years after gay ac
tivists first began lobbying the University for the
change.
Campus gay activists said the new statement,
which applies to all schools and departments,
marks a major step for the homosexual commu

"The gay community has been pushing for the
non-discrimination policy for quite some
years This is the last step," said junior Atticus
Tysen, member of the steering committee for the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance.
Faculty and staff were already protected by sep

One freshman last year wrote a letter to Dean
of Admissions Jean Fetter and expressed the need
for an explicit non-discrimination policy to make
gays feel more comfortable about coming to Stan
ford and to help combat homophobia on campus.
Fetter's office contacted the freshman who sent
the letter, and he had a personal meeting with
her, Tysen said.
"We were all terribly impressed that he got up
the guts to do it," said sophomore Joyce Adams, a
lesbian activist.

Some Ivy League schools have had policies for
several years that spelled out non-discrimination
for sexual orientation, and gay activists here said
Stanford's slow response was partly due to the
caution of administration officials.
"It took a long time because institutional
processes take some time to change," said Noelle
Hanrahan, a leading lesbian activist on campus
who graduated last year. "Stanford's moving in
the right direction," she added.
Hanrahan said Kennedy last year started
meeting with GLAS members once a quarter to
