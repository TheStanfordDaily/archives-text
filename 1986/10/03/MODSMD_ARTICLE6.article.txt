# New dean examines education problems
## CERAS seeking to stop dropouts 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
Traditional approaches to the crisis in public
education have proven ineffective, and new
answers must be sought, according to Stanford s
new dean of education.
"We have an obligation to think hard about
people in schools that aren't doing well ... and
don't have many resources," Mike Smith said at
the school's fall convocation Tuesday.
Before his recent appointment at Stanford,
Smith was director of the Wisconsin Center for
Education Research and professor of educa
tional policy studies and educational psychology
at the University of Wisconsin. He has also
served as associate director of the National In
stitute of Education and chief of staff to the sec
retary of the Department of Education.
Smith said that as a "moderately well-to-do'
institution, Stanford "has the luxury to think
about the hardest problems in ways that haven t
been thought about before.
Among these problems is a high dropout rate
of students in poor inner-city schools. This drop
out rate, which is 14 percent nationally, exceeds
50 percent in large cities with high minority con
centrations.
Ironically, Smith said, many ot the state and
local programs designed to combat this drop
out rate have had the opposite effect. Certain
kinds of increased requirements and testing pro
grams have created an environment which puts
down kids" and dooms them to a cycle ot fail
ure," he said.
Such a negative academic environment is of
ten reinforced by factors outside of the school,
according to Smith. A poor home environment
in which parents fail to encourage their childs
studies or one in which the child is preventec
from studying puts educators in a difficult posi
tion, he said.

"The schools can help, but they can't com
pensate" entirely for a detrimental home envi
ronment, said Smith. Nevertheless,"the schools
have to do what they can."
One new approach to these problems that
Smith suggested is the accelerated school con
cept being developed by Prof. Henry Levin of the
Center for Educational Research at Stanford
(CERAS).
The accelerated school concept, Levin said,
dispenses with the traditional notion that
"educationally needy" students should be
placed in slow, repetitive, remedial programs.
Not only do these programs bore students, said
Levin, they reinforce students' negative aca
demic self-images.
In accelerated schools, "educationally needy"
students would be placed in accelerated pro
grams designed to help them catch up. In addi
tion, senior citizens would volunteer as tutors to
work with students on a one-to-one basis, and
school hours would be extended to include time
for homework, Levin said.
If this approach were applied at the elemen
tary level, Levin said, the dropout rate could be
significantly cut.
"When a student formally drops out of high
school, the dropping-out took place a long time
before," he said.
Accelerated schools are currently being set up
in both Redwood City and San Francisco, target
ing neighbor hoods in which poor academic per
formance has been the norm. These schools will
be the first of their kind, but Levin hopes that if
they are successful, the idea of accelerated
schools will spread across the country.
While Levin acknowledged that "there are no
magic solutions' to the problems faced by inner
city schools today, he said he looks to the long
term. He believes that accelerated schools,
should they prove effective, could have a "major
impact on American education within 10 years.
