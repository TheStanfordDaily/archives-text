# Cardinal looks for revenge
## SPORTS 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It was one year ago this weekend, and it
was not pretty.
The Stanford Cardinal went into San
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and simply
played what Coach Jack Elway called "our
worst football game so far."
How had? San Diego State rolled up four
touchdowns and 347 yards of total offense.
That was the first half.
The Aztecs finished with 513 yards of
total offense, 320 of those passed by quar

terback Todd Santos, who went 18-24 with
five touchdowns. The final verdict: San
Diego State 41, Stanford 22.
"We may no' evaluate this film," Elway
said afterward. "I don't know if there are
any bright spots."
There weren't many. And if an elephant
never forgets, neither does a defensive
back.
"They embarassed us," strong safety Brad
Humphreys said this week. "There are a lot
of guys back from that game. We're not
going to forget it. This one will be easy to

get up for — it's all revenge. That was the
low point of last season; I think it was the
low point of my life "
In the meantime, the Stanford defense
has become the strong point of a 3-0 team.
And, Humphreys said, "We want revenge."
They won't be able to do it tomorrow
against Santos. The junior passer, who was
averaging 286 yards in his first four games,
suffered a fractured wrist against New
Mexico last week and will be out three to
six weeks.

The Cardinal will be looking for a big day from fullback Brad Muster in tomorrow's game against San Diego State. After three
games, Muster leads the team in rushing with 228 yards and in scoring with four touchdowns.
They dont care. "It doesn't matter to me,"
strong safety Alan Grant said. "It's still the same
team."
Senior Jim Plum will take over the duties from
Santos. Plum, a Parade High School All-American,
completed four of eight passes for 18 yards
against UCLA in his only appearance this season.

7 think it was the low
point of my life.'
— Brad Humphreys

With Santos, the Aztecs opened 3-1, defeating
Long Beach State and Western Athletic Confer
ence foes Utah and New Mexico. Their only loss
was a 45-14 drubbing at UCLA.
Lost in all the defensive hopes for atonement is
a Stanford offense that never got untracked last
week at Oregon State. The Cardinal was held to
243 yards by the Beavers in that 17-7 victory.
But a year ago, the offense had no problem
rolling up yardage. Stanford had 498 yards of total
offense, and quarterback John Paye set the school
single-game completion record as he connected

on 40 of 56 passes for 385 yards.
The offense did have a problem scoring points.
Of those 40 completions by Paye, none reached
the end zone. The offense scored only one touch
down the whole game, though playing without
running back Brad Muster.
If there is a game for Stanford to put it together,
it would seem to be tomorrow, as San Diego State
is allowing an average of 33 points a game. But
the Cardinal may be without wide receiver Jeff
James. The junior caught 18 passes in his first two
games to lead the nation, but suffered a sprained
heel against San Jose State and missed last week's
game. If James cannot play, freshman Ed McCaf
frey is expected to get the starting call again.
The Cardinal's other major loss is at left tackle,
where Jeff Marchin is listed as doubtful with a
pinched nerve in his neck. John Zentner, who is
probable with a groin pull, is expected to move to
the left side, and Robbie Coffin will take over at
right tackle.
Tomorrow's game is Stanford's first since
cracking the United Press International Top 20 for
the first time in four years. "It's an honor to be in
the top 20," Elway said. "It's a tribute to the staff
and the players. What we want to do now is keep
winning.
"I suppose it's also an incentive for teams to get
excited to play us. That's okay, too, I guess."
Kickoff is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. at Stanford
Stadium. The game will be broadcast on KCBS
(740 AM) and KZSU (90.1 FM).

In the meantime, the Stanford defense
has become the strong point of a 3-0 team.
And, Humphreys said, "We want revenge."
They won't be able to do it tomorrow
against Santos. The junior passer, who was
averaging 286 yards in his first four games,
suffered a fractured wrist against New
Mexico last week and will be out three to
six weeks.

The Cardinal will be looking for a big day from fullback Brad Muster in tomorrow's game against San Diego State. After three
games, Muster leads the team in rushing with 228 yards and in scoring with four touchdowns.
They dont care. "It doesn't matter to me,"
strong safety Alan Grant said. "It's still the same
team."
Senior Jim Plum will take over the duties from
Santos. Plum, a Parade High School All-American,
completed four of eight passes for 18 yards
against UCLA in his only appearance this season.

With Santos, the Aztecs opened 3-1, defeating
Long Beach State and Western Athletic Confer
ence foes Utah and New Mexico. Their only loss
was a 45-14 drubbing at UCLA.
Lost in all the defensive hopes for atonement is
a Stanford offense that never got untracked last
week at Oregon State. The Cardinal was held to
243 yards by the Beavers in that 17-7 victory.
But a year ago, the offense had no problem
rolling up yardage. Stanford had 498 yards of total
offense, and quarterback John Paye set the school
single-game completion record as he connected

on 40 of 56 passes for 385 yards.
The offense did have a problem scoring points.
Of those 40 completions by Paye, none reached
the end zone. The offense scored only one touch
down the whole game, though playing without
running back Brad Muster.
If there is a game for Stanford to put it together,
it would seem to be tomorrow, as San Diego State
is allowing an average of 33 points a game. But
the Cardinal may be without wide receiver Jeff
James. The junior caught 18 passes in his first two
games to lead the nation, but suffered a sprained
heel against San Jose State and missed last week's
game. If James cannot play, freshman Ed McCaf
frey is expected to get the starting call again.
The Cardinal's other major loss is at left tackle,
where Jeff Marchin is listed as doubtful with a
pinched nerve in his neck. John Zentner, who is
probable with a groin pull, is expected to move to
the left side, and Robbie Coffin will take over at
right tackle.
Tomorrow's game is Stanford's first since
cracking the United Press International Top 20 for
the first time in four years. "It's an honor to be in
the top 20," Elway said. "It's a tribute to the staff
and the players. What we want to do now is keep
winning.
"I suppose it's also an incentive for teams to get
excited to play us. That's okay, too, I guess."
Kickoff is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. at Stanford
Stadium. The game will be broadcast on KCBS
(740 AM) and KZSU (90.1 FM).

It was one year ago this weekend, and it
was not pretty.
The Stanford Cardinal went into San
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and simply
played what Coach Jack Elway called "our
worst football game so far."
How had? San Diego State rolled up four
touchdowns and 347 yards of total offense.
That was the first half.
The Aztecs finished with 513 yards of
total offense, 320 of those passed by quar

terback Todd Santos, who went 18-24 with
five touchdowns. The final verdict: San
Diego State 41, Stanford 22.
"We may no' evaluate this film," Elway
said afterward. "I don't know if there are
any bright spots."
There weren't many. And if an elephant
never forgets, neither does a defensive
back.
"They embarassed us," strong safety Brad
Humphreys said this week. "There are a lot
of guys back from that game. We're not
going to forget it. This one will be easy to

get up for — it's all revenge. That was the
low point of last season; I think it was the
low point of my life "
In the meantime, the Stanford defense
has become the strong point of a 3-0 team.
And, Humphreys said, "We want revenge."
