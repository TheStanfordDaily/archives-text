# Cardinal looks for revenge
## SPORTS 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It was one year ago this weekend, and it
was not pretty.
The Stanford Cardinal went into San
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and simply
played what Coach Jack Elway called "our
worst football game so far."
How had? San Diego State rolled up four
touchdowns and 347 yards of total offense.
That was the first half.
The Aztecs finished with 513 yards of
total offense, 320 of those passed by quar

terback Todd Santos, who went 18-24 with
five touchdowns. The final verdict: San
Diego State 41, Stanford 22.
"We may no' evaluate this film," Elway
said afterward. "I don't know if there are
any bright spots."
There weren't many. And if an elephant
never forgets, neither does a defensive
back.
"They embarassed us," strong safety Brad
Humphreys said this week. "There are a lot
of guys back from that game. We're not
going to forget it. This one will be easy to

get up for — it's all revenge. That was the
low point of last season; I think it was the
low point of my life "
In the meantime, the Stanford defense
has become the strong point of a 3-0 team.
And, Humphreys said, "We want revenge."
They won't be able to do it tomorrow
against Santos. The junior passer, who was
averaging 286 yards in his first four games,
suffered a fractured wrist against New
Mexico last week and will be out three to
six weeks.
