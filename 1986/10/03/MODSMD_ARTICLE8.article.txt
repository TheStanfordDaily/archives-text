Gandhi assassination fails
NEW DELHI, India — A man in an army uniform yesterday fired a
homemade pistol at Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and President Zail Singh,
missing them but slightly wounding six other people. Authorities said the
captured assailant did not belong to a terror group.
The shooting triggered an investigation into protection given the prime
minister, who has been threatened repeatedly by Sikh separatists. Police
said the gunman was not a Sikh.
The government said several police assigned to protect Gandhi were
suspended after the attack, which occurred as Gandhi, 42, and the presi
dent left a prayer service commemorating the 117 th anniversary of the
birth of Mohandas Gandhi, who led India's struggle for independence
from Britain.
Police said the attacker hid in heavy vines that covered a gazebo on the
grounds of the Rajghat, or State Memorial, where the Mahatma was
cremated. He fired a homemade pistol several times, they said.
After the shooting, Gandhi appeared on government television and said
smiling: "Everything is okay. There is nothing to tell."
He then closeted himself with Home Minister Buta Singh, who is respon
sible for internal security, and other officials. Indian news agencies said the
group discussed the security lapse and tightening protection for Gandhi.
Both Gandhi and Singh have been threatened by extremist groups, in
cluding Sikh separatists who want to set up a separate Sikh nation in Punjab
state, the only part of India where Sikhs outnumber Hindus.
Dissident to leave Soviet Union
MOSCOW — Soviet authorities yesterday told the wife of dissident Yuri
Orlov that she and her husband soon will leave the Soviet Union for the
United States, a friend reported.
Irina Orlov was not told when she and her husband would depart or
when they would be reunited, the friend said.
Until today, the Soviets had not contacted Mrs. Orlov about emigrating.
Secretary of State George Shultz announced Monday that Orlov, who has
spent eight years in labor camps and in internal exile in Siberia, would be
allowed to emigrate with his wife to the United States by Oct. 7. Their
emigration was part of the superpower agreement that freed U.S. journalist
Nicholas Daniloff and Soviet U.N. employee Gennady Zakharov.
Mrs. Orlov was called to the national visa agency this afternoon and told
she would be allowed to leave, said the friend, who was reached at Mrs. Or
lov's apartment in Moscow. The friend spoke on condition of anonymity.
Mrs. Orlov had gone to visit her sick mother, her friend said, and was not
available for comment.
Orlov, 62, was a founding member of the unofficial human rights group
formed to monitor Soviet compliance with the 1975 Helsinki accord.
The group, which at one time had 30 active members, disbanded in
1982, by which time all but three members had been imprisoned, banished
to Siberia or exiled abroad.
Chernobyl had military functions
VIENNA, Austria — There is growing evidence that the damaged nuclear
power plant at Chernobyl and others like it in the Soviet Union have been
used for both civilian and military purposes.
According to unofficial Soviet sources and Western nuclear officials, the
Soviet military has a direct role in managing at least some of the 14 remain
ing reactors of the same design as the ifhit that exploded and burned April
16 at Chernobyl.
Military authorities appear to have no comparable role in running the
country's conventional, pressurized-water reactors.
In interviews, U.S. and West European officials said that some of the
graphite reactors like those at Chernobyl may be used to produce
weapons-grade plutonium, but that their most likely military purpose
would be to make tritium, a rare isotope of hydrogen used in ther
monuclear weapons.
The indications of a military function add a new dimension to Soviet ex
planations for the very large commitment Moscow has made to an unusual
reactor design that is now acknowledged to have inherent safety flaws.
Some Western nuclear officials attending a special session of the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency here last week, which completed two interna
tional agreements on nuclear accidents, said that there is evidence that the
Soviets have, in fact, used those reactors for weapons production. They said
the extent of involvement and precise role of those reactors remains un
clear.
Fines important to INS efforts
SAN FRANCISCO — Strict fines against employers who knowingly hire il
legal aliens are crucial to any immigration law aimed at gaining control of
the border, an INS official said yesterday.
"There's no question that employer sanctions are the cornerstone that
would help us control our border," said Harold Ezell, western region com
missioner for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The region in
cludes California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam.
"We believe that 95 percent of the employers would comply," he said.
He said the INS would treat all employers the same if economic sanc
tions are enacted, from the small family-owned stores to large hotel chains.
In lamenting the lack of an immigration reform law, Ezell blamed a
reluctant Congress nervously watching the election clock, special interest
groups lobbying to kill the bill and "greedy growers" insisting on procur
ing illegal aliens to work their farms.
Ezell called the news conference to announce that the number of ap
prehensions of illegal aliens in the western region increased a record 39
percent last year, jumping from 673,000 to 936,000.
Ezell also tied illicit drug trafficking to "wide-open" borders, and said
the flow of drugs cannot be stopped without also dealing with the illegal
alien problem.
However, Ezell said he doesn't believe illegal aliens are bringing drugs
with them when they cross the border.
Ezell said he didn't know how many of the total apprehensions were
repeats. But he said that during the peak month in the San Diego area,
70,000 illegal aliens were apprenhended and about 45,000 of those were
first-time offenders. He said the other 25,000 had been previously ap
prehended an average of two times each.
Charges filed in Manila case
MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government filed rebellion
charges yesterday against a suspected top Communist leader, his wife and
an aide who were arrested by military agents in a government hospital.
Rodolfo Salas, 39, his wife Josefina Cruz and bodyguard Jose Concep
cion, face a maximum penalty of death. They are detained under heavy
guard in police headquarters in the suburban city of Quezon.
The charges allege that Salas, chairman of the outlawed Communist Party
of the Philippines, his wife and an aide took up arms to overthrow the gov
ernment through the party's subordinate organizations and military fronts,
like the New People's Army and the National Democratic Front.
The National Democratic Front, in a press statement, demanded the im
mediate release of the three and asked military authorities to stop sabotag
ing peace talks going on with President Corazon Aquino.
"The fate of the peace process is now in hands of President Corazon
Aquino," National Democratic Front representatives Satur Ocampo and An
tonio Zumel said. Negotiatioas for a truce have temporarily stopped be
cause of Salas' arrest.
Salas is by far the biggest rebel catch for the military since die arrest of
Jose Sison in 1977. Salas took over Sison's top post in the Communist
hierarchy.
