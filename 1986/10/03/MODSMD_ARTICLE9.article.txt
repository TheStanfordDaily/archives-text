# S. Africa sanctions become law
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Republican-controlled Sen
ate yesterday handed President Reagan the biggest
policy reversal of his presidency by overriding his
veto of sanctions against South Africa.
The 78-21 bipartisan vote, coming close on the
heels of an override vote in the House earlier this
week, means that the sanctions become law despite
strong objections raised by the president and retalia
tion threatened by the Pretoria government.
The override was the culmination of a bitter, two
year struggle between Reagan and Congress over
how the United States should express its opposition
to South Africa's system of racial discrimination
known as apartheid. The action also reflected a
growing dissatisfaction in Congress with Reagan's
general stewardship of foreign policy.
Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.), called it a repudia
tion of the president's policy of "constructive engage
ment," proving that "while it is true that the presi
dent is the architect of foreign policy, he is not the
czar of foreign policy."
This setback comes only eight days before Reagan
meets with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in
Iceland, and the president himself confided to
several senators before the vote that he feared the
embarrassment of an override would undermine his
position in those talks.
After the vote, Reagan expressed his hope that the
sanctions would not bring more violence and repres
sion to South Africa. "Now is the time for South
Africa's government to act with courage and good
sense to avert a crisis," he said in a statement.
Congress has previously overridden five Reagan
vetoes, but none was of this magnitude. Not since
1973, when Congress overrode Richard M. Nixon's
veto of the War Powers Act, has an incumbent presi
dent suffered as significant a foreign policy reversal
in Congress.
But even when defeat was certain, Reagan took no
action to defuse the confrontation effectively, as he

usually does when caught in a no-win situation. Most
members of his party were unpersuaded by his last
minute promise to impose weaker sanctions by exec
utive order or by his appointmeru of a black ambas
sador to Pretoria.
The vote also was an enormous victory for the
beleaguered liberal faction in Congress, which began
agitating for sanctions two years ago by participating
in protests that led to their arrests outside the South
African Embassy. Many of the nation's most
prominent black leaders, including Coretta Scott
King, were in the chamber when the vote was cast.
"I believe today that Martin Luther King's dream
has been advanced," declared Mrs. King, who called
the sanctions a "death blow" to the white minority
government of South Africa.
Although the sanctions are much weaker than
liberal Democrats had originally sought, the new
legislation would ban all new U.S. investment in that

country; bar U.S. imports of iron, steel, c \
uranium, agricultural products and textiles from
South Africa; revoke landing rights for South African
airliners; prohibit new bank loans to South Africa;
and prohibit exports of oil to South Africa. Many of
those provisions would take effect immediately.
After a year, if the president determines that no
substantial progress has been made in dismantling
apartheid, he can take additional steps, including bar
ring South Africans from depositing money in U.S.
banks; banning the import of diamonds and strategic
minerals from South Africa; and halting military aid
to any country, such as Israel, that is believed to be
violating the U.N. embargo on arms shipments to
Pretoria.
There was considerable disagreement in Congress
about how much economic damage the sanctions
might cause. Some congressional sources estimated
that the bill could affect as much as $36 billion in
foreign exchange per year. Sen. Nancy Kassebaum
(R-Kan.) set the cost in commodities alone at close to
$350 million.
The economic impact could be compounded by
South Africa's threat to retaliate by cutting off U.S.
grain shipments, hurting America's already ailing
farm sector. But Department of Agriculture figures
show that South Africa accounts for less than 1 per
cent of U.S. farm exports.
The U.S. package of sanctions clearly is more strin
gent than any yet imposed by other governments, in
cluding those of the European Economic Commu
nity, the Commonwealth nations, Australia, Canada,
Japan and several African countries.
Thirty-one Republicans joined 47 Democrats in
voting for the override, a clear indication of how
deeply the issue of South Africa has divided the Re
publican Party. Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), a
longtime Reagan supporter, was credited by the
liberals with masterminding the president's defeat,

dent is the architect of foreign policy, he is not the
czar of foreign policy."
This setback comes only eight days before Reagan
meets with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in
Iceland, and the president himself confided to
several senators before the vote that he feared the
embarrassment of an override would undermine his
position in those talks.
After the vote, Reagan expressed his hope that the
sanctions would not bring more violence and repres
sion to South Africa. "Now is the time for South
Africa's government to act with courage and good
sense to avert a crisis," he said in a statement.
Congress has previously overridden five Reagan
vetoes, but none was of this magnitude. Not since
1973, when Congress overrode Richard M. Nixon's
veto of the War Powers Act, has an incumbent presi
dent suffered as significant a foreign policy reversal
in Congress.
But even when defeat was certain, Reagan took no
action to defuse the confrontation effectively, as he

usually does when caught in a no-win situation. Most
members of his party were unpersuaded by his last
minute promise to impose weaker sanctions by exec
utive order or by his appointmeru of a black ambas
sador to Pretoria.
The vote also was an enormous victory for the
beleaguered liberal faction in Congress, which began
agitating for sanctions two years ago by participating
in protests that led to their arrests outside the South
African Embassy. Many of the nation's most
prominent black leaders, including Coretta Scott
King, were in the chamber when the vote was cast.
"I believe today that Martin Luther King's dream
has been advanced," declared Mrs. King, who called
the sanctions a "death blow" to the white minority
government of South Africa.
Although the sanctions are much weaker than
liberal Democrats had originally sought, the new
legislation would ban all new U.S. investment in that

country; bar U.S. imports of iron, steel, c \
uranium, agricultural products and textiles from
South Africa; revoke landing rights for South African
airliners; prohibit new bank loans to South Africa;
and prohibit exports of oil to South Africa. Many of
those provisions would take effect immediately.
After a year, if the president determines that no
substantial progress has been made in dismantling
apartheid, he can take additional steps, including bar
ring South Africans from depositing money in U.S.
banks; banning the import of diamonds and strategic
minerals from South Africa; and halting military aid
to any country, such as Israel, that is believed to be
violating the U.N. embargo on arms shipments to
Pretoria.
There was considerable disagreement in Congress
about how much economic damage the sanctions
might cause. Some congressional sources estimated
that the bill could affect as much as $36 billion in
foreign exchange per year. Sen. Nancy Kassebaum
(R-Kan.) set the cost in commodities alone at close to
$350 million.
The economic impact could be compounded by
South Africa's threat to retaliate by cutting off U.S.
grain shipments, hurting America's already ailing
farm sector. But Department of Agriculture figures
show that South Africa accounts for less than 1 per
cent of U.S. farm exports.
The U.S. package of sanctions clearly is more strin
gent than any yet imposed by other governments, in
cluding those of the European Economic Commu
nity, the Commonwealth nations, Australia, Canada,
Japan and several African countries.
Thirty-one Republicans joined 47 Democrats in
voting for the override, a clear indication of how
deeply the issue of South Africa has divided the Re
publican Party. Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), a
longtime Reagan supporter, was credited by the
liberals with masterminding the president's defeat,
