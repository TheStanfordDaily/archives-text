# Off-campus housing listed on computer
## 
### KRISTEN FEHLHABER 
Each year, about 3,000 Stanford students must
search for off-campus housing.
This year was no different. Walk-in housing
registration took place Thursday, making Univer
sity housing available to some students not as
signed to a residence in last spring s housing lot
tery. Not surprisingly, the number of students
wanting housing greatly exceeded the spaces
available, according to Nancy Kokuchi, off
campus housing coordinator.
Fortunately for those who remain unhoused,
the quest tor an off-campus residence became
easier in August with the unveiling of the
"Housing Off-Campus" file.
This SOCRATES-like computer program was
developed by Information Technology Services
(ITS) and is pan of FOLIO, a system allowing
access to a number of computerized data re
sources. FOLlO's design is similar to SOCRATES'
and uses the same commands — instructions
such as find, browse and display.
FOLIO can be accessed through LOTS termi
nals, personal computers with ITS accounts and
special FOLIO terminals located on the 3rd floor
of Meyer Library and in the East Wing catalog area
of Green Library. Additional terminals are located
in Forsythe Hall and the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
With the housing file, more than 500 rental list
ings can be searched by categories such as rent,
city, type of accomodation (i.e. apartment,
cottage) or pet policy. Each listing in the file con
tains information on the distance from campus,
deposit and lease requirements, pool and yard
availability, the number of bedrooms, the gender
preferred, smoking policy, laundry and kitchen

facilities and wheelchair access.
The new computer service can also help locate
affordable housing.
High housing costs in Palo Alto have caused po
tential faculty and staff to turn down offers of em
ployment from Stanford.
Renting a two- or three-bedroom house in Palo
Alto can cost anywhere between $1,000 and
$1,500 per month, while a typical house usually
sells for more than $200,000.
Each listing also has a contact person whose
name and telephone number is available at the
housing office, located in 315 Old Union. Stan
ford identification is required to get this informa
tion.
The computer does not, however, help with
locating a roommate. Kikuchi said that her office
has tried to help people with this problem in the
past, but that there hadn't been much interest.
The office still handles roommate preference
sheets that can be looked at by interested people.
Access to FOLIO is available to owners of ITS
accounts by typing "FOLIO." The file is also
available to owners of FOLIO accounts. ITS pres
ently provides FOLIO accounts at no cost to the
Stanford community.
These accounts can be obtained from library
service locations and from the Off-Campus
Housing Office.
Computer printouts of the listings are posted in
the Off-Campus Housing Office, and a FOLIO ter
minal is expected there sometime this fall.
The service was funded by an IBM/Stanford
grant. Other files on FOLIO include the
Bookstore's book catalog, internships and fellow
ships, faculty research interests and Odyssey, a lis
ting of internships and research opportunities for
Stanford students.
