Rose Bowl, here we come. We 11... maybe, but with a 4-
0 record and probable top-20 ranking in both polls, the
Stanford football team is off to its best start since 1952.
Saturday's 17-10 win over San Diego State showed that
the Cardinal, with an offense slowed by injuries to
starters Jeff James and Jeff Marchin, has found a new way
to win. The defense has come to the fore and is keyed by
a ball-hawking secondary and aggressive linebackers and
linemen. So intimidating is this new Stanford defense
that it left players from traditional powerhouse Texas
complaining about aggressive play after the Cardinal
humbled the Longhorns in Austin.
It must be noted, however, that the Cardinal has built
its unblemished record at the expense of a rebuilding
Texas, outmanned San Jose State, traditional weak sister
Oregon and a San Diego State team minus star quarter
back Todd Santos.
The meat of the schedule still lies ahead, and Stan
ford's biggest challenge of the young season comes next
Saturday when the Cardinal faces a high-scoring Wash
ington squad in a game to be nationally televised by

WTBS. Also on tap are games with Pacific 10 Conference
powers USC, UCLA and Arizona.
Even with the most difficult part of the schedule
ahead, Stanford has an excellent chance of finishing at
least 7-4. While a 7-4 audit would not lead Cardinal fans
to Pasadena, it would almost surely mean the team
would receive its first bowl bid since 1978.
Stanford's recent football success has also helped the
Farm gain notoriety on the national sports scene. Unlike
other schools which are known either for their
academics — Harvard, Yale and the other Ivies — or
those known only as football factories — Ohio State,
Oklahoma and Nebraska — the Farm is known for excel
lence in both. A strong football tradition is being revived,
and Stanford's academics are still top-notch.
And who knows, with some breaks, the Cardinal might
be able to knock off the dreaded Huskies, Trojans,
Bruins and Wildcats and earn a trip to Pasadena. This
team just seems to have a knack for winning.
For now the sun is shining, the Band is playing and
Stanford football is 4-0. What more could anyone pos
sibly want?
