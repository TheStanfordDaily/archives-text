# Divestment will not end apartheid
## 
### 
As the movement to divest all U.S. holdings in
South Africa accelerates, fewer and fewer people are
asking whether divestment is wise, helpful or in the
best interests of the United States. Last year, Stanford
students were arrested while demonstrating Stan
ford's refusal to divest. The University of California
system voted to sell their holdings related to South
Africa last spring. Governor Deukmejian just signed
legislation requiring the sale of $11 billion of state in
vestments in companies doing business in South
Africa. A close upcoming election with Tom Bradley
may have provided the impetus. President Reagan
courageously refused to join the bandwagon by
vetoing a congressional bill which provides for im
mediate sanctions against the South African govern
ment and additional punishment if apartheid is not
dismantled within a year.

If our primary goal is to see apartheid eliminated
with minimal violence, divestment is not the answer.
Divestment will destroy whatever minor influence
we have with the South African government. South
Africa is not a banana republic that can be bullied
into submission. The strength of its economy is only
marginally attributable to U.S. support. Direct U.S. in
vestment, which at its peak was only $2.6 billion, has
dropped to $1.3 billion, less than 2 percent of the
South African gross national product. South Africa,
which has the highest per capita income, life expec
tancy and literacy rate on the continent, can survive
on its own. African neighbors as far away as Kenya
and Zaire depend on South Africa for essential ex
ports. The effect of our coercion is limited. While di

system and assuages those who are frustrated by the
intransigence of the South African government, it will
not help bring an orderly end to apartheid. Many
argue that divestment will most hurt those people it
is designed to help.
To divest is to wash our hands of the South
Africans and admit there is nothing helpful left to em
ploy. If violent overthrow is indeed inevitable, then
we should divest to cut our losses and divorce our
selves from the impending upheaval, turmoil and
revolution. If a peaceful, non-violent solution is still
possible, the United States should stay involved and
help to implement it. By divesting, we destroy our in
fluence and alienate the parties who are most able to
bring peaceful change.
Peaceful change will be a long, intractable, pain
fully negotiated process. It is not well-suited to the
quick-fix solutions demanded by the protesters and
the Congress. The white South African government
has the most to lose, and any change will be slow and
calculated. The only rapid solution will be a violent
one.
The white government has made some progress,
which includes the desegregation of some private
schools, restaurants and hotels, integration of sports
teams, abolition of mixed-marriage legislation,
repeal of job reservation, non-white participation in
parliament, investment in black education and
legalization of black unions. While we see such
concessions as minor and inadequate, they represent
widespread reform to many South Africans. In either
case, the reform represents a positive start and the
possibility for eventual peaceful solution.
For Americans to demand the immediate disman
tling of apartheid is hypocritical. Examine the United
States' timely progress on racial equality. American
blacks were rioting and burning cities a full century
after slavery was abolished to protest their unfair and
unequal treatment. Even in 1962, it took several
hundred casualties, federal troops and five days to
get one black man admitted to the University of Mis
sissippi. The U.S. history of freedom marches, riots,
beatings, separate facilities, and poll taxes represents
a long, protracted struggle for equality. Nevertheless,
we have the effrontery to demand immediate results

from white South Africans. Suppose in the 19505, a
country on which we were only moderately depen
dent had threatened us with economic sanctions if
we did not adhere immediately to its principles of ra
cial equality. Would the United States reaction have
been any less stubborn than, that of the white South
Africans?
The best environment for social change is a
healthy economy where black labor is most needed
and therefore in the best position to bargain. Consid
erable reform has been initiated by U.S. companies
in South Africa that adhere to the Sullivan principles,
named after Rev. Leon Sullivan, a Baptist minister and
General Motors Corporation director. These prin
ciples provide for non-segregation in eating, comfort
and work facilities; equal pay; training programs and
increased management roles for blacks, coloreds,
and Asians; and improved quality of life outside the
work environment. At one point, 192 American com
panies had adopted these principles, and a number
of South African companies followed. Unfortunately,
16 of these U.S. companies have withdrawn this year,
along with 39 in 1985, thanks to the divestment
movement.
The United States should continue to maintain
contact with leaders of all South African racial
groups, openly condemn and urge dismantling of the
apartheid system, offer helpful support to both sides,
refrain from dictating policy, and stay involved to
help influence a peaceful solution. The arms em
bargo is entirely appropriate. We should continue to
provide millions of dollars in aid to the ongoing
human rights fund administered by the American
embassy in Pretoria, the non-white scholarship fund,
the AFL/CIO black training programs and the aid to
minority small businesses. Rather than divest, we
should invest in those American companies that ad
here to the Sullivan principles and provide a role
model for human rights on South African soil. We
should not ask Stanford to divest but rather investi
gate which companies are doing the most to improve
the situation and invest further.

As the movement to divest all U.S. holdings in
South Africa accelerates, fewer and fewer people are
asking whether divestment is wise, helpful or in the
best interests of the United States. Last year, Stanford
students were arrested while demonstrating Stan
ford's refusal to divest. The University of California
system voted to sell their holdings related to South
Africa last spring. Governor Deukmejian just signed
legislation requiring the sale of $11 billion of state in
vestments in companies doing business in South
Africa. A close upcoming election with Tom Bradley
may have provided the impetus. President Reagan
courageously refused to join the bandwagon by
vetoing a congressional bill which provides for im
mediate sanctions against the South African govern
ment and additional punishment if apartheid is not
dismantled within a year.

If our primary goal is to see apartheid eliminated
with minimal violence, divestment is not the answer.
Divestment will destroy whatever minor influence
we have with the South African government. South
Africa is not a banana republic that can be bullied
into submission. The strength of its economy is only
marginally attributable to U.S. support. Direct U.S. in
vestment, which at its peak was only $2.6 billion, has
dropped to $1.3 billion, less than 2 percent of the
South African gross national product. South Africa,
which has the highest per capita income, life expec
tancy and literacy rate on the continent, can survive
on its own. African neighbors as far away as Kenya
and Zaire depend on South Africa for essential ex
ports. The effect of our coercion is limited. While di

system and assuages those who are frustrated by the
intransigence of the South African government, it will
not help bring an orderly end to apartheid. Many
argue that divestment will most hurt those people it
is designed to help.
To divest is to wash our hands of the South
Africans and admit there is nothing helpful left to em
ploy. If violent overthrow is indeed inevitable, then
we should divest to cut our losses and divorce our
selves from the impending upheaval, turmoil and
revolution. If a peaceful, non-violent solution is still
possible, the United States should stay involved and
help to implement it. By divesting, we destroy our in
fluence and alienate the parties who are most able to
bring peaceful change.
Peaceful change will be a long, intractable, pain
fully negotiated process. It is not well-suited to the
quick-fix solutions demanded by the protesters and
the Congress. The white South African government
has the most to lose, and any change will be slow and
calculated. The only rapid solution will be a violent
one.
The white government has made some progress,
which includes the desegregation of some private
schools, restaurants and hotels, integration of sports
teams, abolition of mixed-marriage legislation,
repeal of job reservation, non-white participation in
parliament, investment in black education and
legalization of black unions. While we see such
concessions as minor and inadequate, they represent
widespread reform to many South Africans. In either
case, the reform represents a positive start and the
possibility for eventual peaceful solution.
For Americans to demand the immediate disman
tling of apartheid is hypocritical. Examine the United
States' timely progress on racial equality. American
blacks were rioting and burning cities a full century
after slavery was abolished to protest their unfair and
unequal treatment. Even in 1962, it took several
hundred casualties, federal troops and five days to
get one black man admitted to the University of Mis
sissippi. The U.S. history of freedom marches, riots,
beatings, separate facilities, and poll taxes represents
a long, protracted struggle for equality. Nevertheless,
we have the effrontery to demand immediate results

from white South Africans. Suppose in the 19505, a
country on which we were only moderately depen
dent had threatened us with economic sanctions if
we did not adhere immediately to its principles of ra
cial equality. Would the United States reaction have
been any less stubborn than, that of the white South
Africans?
The best environment for social change is a
healthy economy where black labor is most needed
and therefore in the best position to bargain. Consid
erable reform has been initiated by U.S. companies
in South Africa that adhere to the Sullivan principles,
named after Rev. Leon Sullivan, a Baptist minister and
General Motors Corporation director. These prin
ciples provide for non-segregation in eating, comfort
and work facilities; equal pay; training programs and
increased management roles for blacks, coloreds,
and Asians; and improved quality of life outside the
