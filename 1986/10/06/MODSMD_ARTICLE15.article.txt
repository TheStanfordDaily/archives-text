# Adapting to Stanford as a foreigner
## 
### 
Question: Who is more confused
than a newly arrived freshman at Stan
ford?
Give up? The answer: a newly
arrived foreign freshman at Stanford.
Thrown into a totally alien culture, he
is not just trying to get oriented to life
at Stanford. Tougher still, he is trying
to get oriented to American life.

Having been transported thousands of
miles in a matter of a few hours, the
sudden switch of cultures takes the
foreign student by surprise when he
first arrives on campus. For Americans,
going to college is a big enough step.
In comparison, the foreign student
takes a giant leap when he leaves be
hind his own culture and practically
begins life afresh. The term "culture
shock" is well-worn — almost a cliche.
But few can appreciate the reality and
magnitude of this shock until they have
experienced it.
Being a foreigner myself, spotting
the lost, almost baffled faces of foreign
students among the hordes of fresh

men during orientation brought back
memories of my own experiences
during the early pan of my freshman
year.
"Hey, Nish, how's it goin?"
How's what going?
"Hey, didn't you hear me, buddy?
What have you been up to?"
Not knowing that when Americans
ask you that question, they don't really
want an accurate answer, I proceeded
into a lengthy account of what 1 had
been doing all day — three classes in
the morning, lunch, tennis, a nap in the
afternoon
"What have you been up to?" I asked
him when I finished.
"Not much." And he sauntered away.
Well, that was a concise answer!
Another incident that comes to mind
is when a friend asked me what games
I played in high school.
"Football and ..." I started to an
swer.
"You played what?" he asked in
credulously, l(K)king my 5-foot-7, 145-
pound frame over.
"Football," I repeated.
He burst out laughing. "You're a
great kidder, Nish."
It was only later that I discovered

that what the rest of the world calls
"football," Americans call "soccer" and
that football was a game in which the
ball was thrown, caught and carried
using your hands. Very logical, these
Americans.
Very soon, 1 discovered that televi
sion and football were the two great
American passions — two subjects on
which I had little to say. Fo<xl was an
other problem — the names of the
dishes were as unpronounceable as
they were unpalatable. I did not digest
partying American-style too well either.
After my first few days at Stanford, 1 was
convinced that it was impossible for me
to engage in any kind of protracted con
versation with an American.
The first sign that things might
change for the better came at a dinner
at my adviser's home. After a wonder
ful meal, I was talking with my advi
ser's wife. She thought that I was at a
terrific advantage being a foreigner in
America, as people would respect the
fact that I was from a part of the world
that they knew little about.
I wasn't impressed. "But all they ask
about are TV and football.'
"That is unimportant. You'll make
friends verv soon."

I was still unconvinced. But she was
tight. I had failed to recognize that
America absorbs people of all back
grounds like no other country, and that
Stanford is especially good at making
you feel at home, far away from home.
In no time at all, I found myself making
friends.
In spite of all the difficulties I had in
the beginning, in retrospect, these
problems seem only inevitable —
something that a foreign student
should be mentally prepared for. I
know this is easy to say now, when
those days of feeling like the proverbial
square peg in a round hole are over.
And it would help foreign freshmen if
the University arranged a few seminars
for them so they can familiarize them
selves with American "idiomology"
(which bears little resemblance to En
glish spoken elsewhere), customs and
food. The International Center tries to
do its part, but continues to be the
reserve of the graduate students. One
hopes that foreign students will go
through a smoother transition period
than they have in the past.
