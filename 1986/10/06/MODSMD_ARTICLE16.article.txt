Stanford offers
variety of thought
As a freshman, I thank Brendan
Kelly for his gracious welcome (Daily,
Oct. 2). I appreciate the beautifully
orchestrated introduction that 1 was
given when 1 arrived here. 1 already
feel at home.
However, I refuse to accept his
narrow-minded opinions regarding
the political atmosphere on the Stan
ford campus. Yes, Mr. Kelly, many of
us share heroes like John and Robert
Kennedy (although I've never heard
anyone call Teddy a modern-day
hero). Yes, many of us consider Nel
son Mandela and Desmond Tutu
heroes, for they seek peace and
equality. (I have yet to see evidence of
the "Socialist vise" you speak of.)
I also question your judgement of
"conformity," Mr. Kelly. Do you see
anyone who questions your conserva
tive point of view as a conformist? Do
you believe that any "liberal" opinion
is fodder, upon which sheeps like me
can graze? What 1 have seen, although
perhaps limited, of Stanford politics
has been wondrefully diverse. 1 have
met upperclassmen campaigning

against Lyndon La√üouche, and I have
seen freshmen starting Bible discus
sion groups. I have heard arguments
for and against divestment. I have read
my mind and I have read your edito
rial column. I see nothing at Stanford
to convince me that anyone's opinions
are "junk thought," but you proclaim
the University has an unnatural
hospitality for the same.
I disagree with your political views,
Mr. Kelly. 1 would "dare say' that
homosexuality is not a perversion, but
rather an individual choice. I would
"dare say" that I oppose aid to the
Nicaraguan contras. In my opinion,
promotion of violence is not an op
tion. However, I respect your right to
carry that opinion. 1 do not dismiss
you because 1 disagree; I welcome the
chance to see things from a different
perspective.
You recommended a "healthy
respect for contrary ideas." I fail to
see how your description of opposing
ideas as "liberal fodder" promotes
such a healthy respect. I ask you to
put away your judgement and to
discuss, celebrate and thrive in the
wonderful variety of thought that
Stanford offers. Perhaps then you will
see that if you truly respect the
opinions of others, there is no such
thing as "junk thought."
