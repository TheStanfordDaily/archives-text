# Stanford's AIDS policy is non-discriminatory
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Along with fears regarding the contagious
ness of AIDS comes the inevitable question:
What should businesses and institutions do
when a student contracts the disease?
Though statewide debate has grown more in
tense in recent months, Stanford and the Uni
versity ol California have had non
discrimination policies in effect since April.
In contrast to Proposition 64, which labels
AIDS an infectious disease and calls for the
quarantine of carriers, Stanford and the UC
system treat AIDS as a terminal illness that is
not contagious through casual contact.
"We quickly realized the policies we had in
place would he just fine, said James Lyons,
Stanford's dean of Student Affairs. "It's another
on the list of venereal diseases. Ii is unlike most
others in that it is fatal.
"Certainly AIDS is new. Nobody knew about
it six years ago, hut for years at Stanford we've

had students with terminal illnesses. That s not
a new phenomenon, just a very sad one.
"Last year was more or less a year to try- to fig
ure out how to approach the AIDS issue, he
added, noting that "most people realized last
year that AIDS is a very hard disease to con
tract."
Lyons said Stanford was ahead of a number
of institutions in looking at this phenomenon.
Cathy Kodama, coordinator of UC-Berkelev's
AIDS Kducation Project, said other schools have
taken a stance similar to that of Stanford and the
I Jniversity of California.
"We haven't developed any special policies
with respect to AIDS," said Kodama. "We
simply don't feel that people with AIDS present
any special threat to the living environment.'
The lIC system's policy came from UC Presi
dent David Gardner's office.
Kodama cited two instances of AIDS in the
UC-Berkelev staff, saying, "They had a right to
work until they were no longer able to do so
and (were) then handled as if they had any

other terminal illness.'
According to Lyons,- between seven and 10
cases of AIDS in Stanford students have been
reported to his office.
"It tends to be a very private situation. It's not
unusual for somebody to leave the University
without telling us, and later on we learn from
their friends what caused their death," he said.
Kodama said Stanford's policy and the one
governing all nine I'C campuses are similar.
"The gist (of both statements) is exactly the
same."
The AIDS Education Project at Stanford was
created last year to educate and foster under
standing and compassion concerning AIDS.
"We (the Stanford Office of Student Affairs)
made common cause with GLAS (the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford) in forming the
AIDS Education Project at Stanford, which now
has taken on a life of its own," Lyons said.
"It was extraordinarily useful that we were
able to work with GIAS in educating the com
munity. Stanford was very fortunate in having a

well-organized gay and lesbian community
when the phenomenon hit us.
"In the future, we will provide whatever sup
port we can to help the AIDS Education Project.
We do what we can with regards to AIDS," he
added.
In the coming year the Office of Student Af
fairs will continue to use the Residential Educa
tion Program as "a vehicle, whenever appropri
ate, to sponsor informative residence-based
discussions on the topic of AIDS," according to
Lyons.
AIDS experts such as Pat Christen applaud
the Stanford and UC policies. Christen is a
spokesperson for the San Francisco AIDS Foun
dation and a 19H2 Stanford graduate in biology.
"I think it (AIDS) is very wisely handled that
way. It's not a casually contagious disease, so
there's no point in re-inventing the wheel
simply because we have a new disease."
"There have been a lot of studies done on
people who have lived with people who have
AIDS. Only those who were sexually interactive

tested positive for the disease.
"The fears people have come more from ig
norance than from acknowledged medical
fact," Christen said.
"The Stanford Res Fal program is excellent,
so 1 would encourage them to use it. They
already have a system in place which is ideal for
educating students in a natural environment,"
Christen said.
"Students are more receptive to information
when they are at home and comfortable. They
are more likely to ask questions than they
would be in a big auditorium," she added.
For information on AIDS, Stanford students
can consult the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Stan
ford or Cowell Student Health Center or the
San Francisco AIDS Foundation at (415) H64-
6606.
The U.S. Public Health Service also offers a
toll-free hotline designed to answer often
asked questions regarding AIDS. A recorded
message is available 24 hours-a-day, seven days
a-week. The number is 800-324-AIDS.
