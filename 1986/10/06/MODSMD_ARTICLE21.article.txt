American Draft Law Violators,

J'rom earliest colonial days, when
American conscientious objectors
refused to fight against Nat ire Ameri
can tribes, until the early 1980s, when
500,000 youths refused to register for
the draft, Americans hare consistently
riolated conscription laws Draft resis
tance is one of the largest, longest and
most successful campaigns of ciril dis
obedience in American history.
Resisters hare contributed to altering
American foreign policy and military
policy, pioneering direct-action tactics
and dereloping pacifist and humanis
tic ideals. Resisters hare made signifi
cant and lasting contributions to ciril
and religious liberty. They hare been a
powerful, catalytic force in the modern
peace morement.
So begins Stephen Kohn in his new
book, "Jailed for Peace: The History of
American Draft Law Violators, 1658-
1985." He has written this book, he
says, to fill an "unfortune void." Ac
cording to Kohn, no book had been
published that fully documents the his
tory and political impact of anti-war
conscientious objectors.
"Jailed for Peace" is excellent in
many respects. Concise and clearly
written, it makes important points and
supports them with a strong collection
of evidence. Although somewhat
flawed and not nearly the comprehen
sive survey Kohn suggests, this work
deserves reading. If Greenwood Press
does a good job of promotion and dis
tribution, "Jailed For Peace" will itself
make a significant and lasting contribu
tion to liberty and world peace.
The people and ideas Kohn ex
amines are not often found in U.S. his
tory texts or in television network spe
cials which "relive" the dramas of this
war or that. Reminding us that "it was
not warriors alone who carved out the
New World in America,"he first intro
duces 17th century settlers who
refused to own slaves, steal land from
the Indians or be conscripted into the
King's armies. Following this strain of
peace-making through the Revolution
ary War years, when every colony with
a sizable pacifist population
recognized conscientious objection as

valid exemption from military service,
Kohn notes that these rights were
protected "even when the invasion of
important cities by British troops
seemed imminent."
"Jailed for Peace" is a long, deep his
tory of resistance. It includes slavery
abolitionists of the mid-1800s, who
called for a campaign of civil dis
obedience to end war; incarcerated
World War I military refusers, who
started a tradition of work strikes and
other protests of prison conditions;
and World War II conscientious objec
tors, who decided they'd had enough
of alternative service and walked out of
work camps.
After covering the early Cold War
years, Kohn devotes special attention
to the Vietnam anti-conscription move
ment, which literally defeated the draft
and accelerated the war's end. It was
fascinating to learn new information
about this period, such as the fact that
morale within Selective Service
dropped precipitously as anti-draft ac
tivity spread; the staff turnover rate in
creased from 6 percent to 18 percent
between 1965 and 1968.
Kohn next turns to contempo
rary resistance. Levels of draft law

violation, in the form of non-registra
tion, are substantially higher than ever
before. Kohn says he believes the
"overwhelming" majority of at least
500,000 non-registrants will continue to
escape prosecution. Presidential ad
visors, including Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger, fear the anti-draft
movement will unite with the anti
nuclear movement to become a more
effective anti-war campaign.
Examining the "enormous prob
lems" confronting the registration pro
gram, Kohn calls this loose network of
groups and individuals "potentially the
most effective anti-draft movement in
American history," and indeed there
are many who believe it has already
delayed government efforts to bring
back inductions and even helped limit
direct U.S. military involvement in
Central America.
As he documents non-cooperation,
Kohn attempts to show an evolution, a
broadening of its philosophies and tac
tics. Each new generation of resisters,
he says, took inspiration from and
added to the ideas of previous genera
tions, so that by the 19605, "the base of
the draft resistance movement had ex
panded far beyond the narrow pacifist

and religious communities."
This evolutionary analysis, while
useful in identifying trends, is overly
simplistic. History has more ragged
edges, more clouded distinctions, than
Kohn presents. For example, while it is
true that many early American resisters
were pacifists, one cannot say, as Kohn
does, that anti-draft efforts up into the
1800s were "strictly" pacifist.
Numerous non-pacifists immigrated to
a young United States to avoid con
scription in their homelands. American
resistance r o the draft has stemmed
from a wide range of motivations and
ideals, and the beliefs of colonial ob
jectors can be categorized no more
neatly than those of their modern
counterparts.
Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of
"Jailed for Peace" is Kohn's failure to
clarify that the ranks of anti-draft move
ments have always included people
who have no immediate or even possi
ble military obligation. Women and
older men, such as the famous anar
chists Emma Goldman and Dr. Ben
jamin Spock, have organized side-by
side with non-cooperators, often
taking equal or greater risks. Males too
young to be drafted have also aided the

fight against forced soldiering. These
resisters merit much more discussion
and credit than Kohn gives them.
The final chapters of the book
chronicle legal history and comment
on the place of civil disobedience in
the American democratic tradition.
Here Kohn, who is himself a lawyer,
advances some of his boldest claims.
Drawing upon the Declaration ot Inde
pendence, extensive case law and
other sources, he asserts that "direct
action and civil disobedience are con
stitutionally recognized by the very
spirit and underlying premises of U.S.
government." Furthermore, he contin
ues, "juries have the ultimate power to
legalize civil disobedience."
This power of "nullification," de
signed to prevent government oppres
sion, gives juries the irreversible
right to acquit a defendant in a crimi
nal trial, regardless of any and all
"facts" presented during testimony. By
considering this option, a jury acts, in
the words of one federal appeals court
judge, "as spokesman for the commu
nity conscience in determining
whether or not blame can be
imposed."
But, says Kohn, jurors are rarely told
any more that they can legally ignore
and thereby reject the law during their
deliberations. Judges stopped telling
jurors of their nullification powers
during the 19th century, and modern
court decisions have upheld a judge's
right to refuse the information. Poten
tial jurors need to be aware of nullifica
tion before they ever enter the court
room. Kohn's writing may generate
more enthusiasm for public education
and influence a few judges.

It will definitely have an effect on
many who read it, and many should.
There are lessons and a wealth of good
information to be gleaned from this
book. Organizing for peace becomes
easier when more citizens know that a
small but determined minority, even
when suffering extreme public perse
cution, can create tangible social
change.
"Jailed for Peace" is especially ap
propriate for classroom use and for
schools and public libraries. As part of
a Greenwood Press series,
"Contributions in Military Studies, it
goes out to a variety of government
offices and military colleges. Those
already active in anti-war organizing
will find it an inspiring and helpful ref
erence.
Kohn urges that "it is imperative that
society fully recognize and appreciate
the sacrifice, courage and legitimacy of
conscientious objection to war.... The
inhuman barbarism of nuclear
holocaust has forced new generations
to evaluate their willingness to support
warfare in any capacity."
The anti-draft movement cuts
through official debate on military per
sonnel policy to address deeper ques
tions, such as whether the armed
forces should exist at all. Resisters, he
feels, "question the morality of an
assumed reality."
"Jailed for Peace," in telling the
resistance story, furthers that question
ing.

legalize civil disobedience."
This power of "nullification," de
signed to prevent government oppres

right to acquit a defendant in a crimi

"facts" presented during testimony. By
considering this option, a jury acts, in

But, says Kohn, jurors are rarely told
any more that they can legally ignore
and thereby reject the law during their
deliberations. Judges stopped telling
jurors of their nullification powers
during the 19th century, and modern
court decisions have upheld a judge's
right to refuse the information. Poten

"Jailed for Peace: The History of
American Draft Law Violators,
1658-1965"
By Stephen M. Kohn
Greenwood Press, Westport,
Conn.
$29.95
J'rom earliest colonial days, when
American conscientious objectors
refused to fight against Nat ire Ameri
can tribes, until the early 1980s, when
500,000 youths refused to register for
the draft, Americans hare consistently
riolated conscription laws Draft resis
tance is one of the largest, longest and
most successful campaigns of ciril dis
obedience in American history.
Resisters hare contributed to altering
American foreign policy and military
policy, pioneering direct-action tactics
and dereloping pacifist and humanis
tic ideals. Resisters hare made signifi
cant and lasting contributions to ciril
and religious liberty. They hare been a
powerful, catalytic force in the modern
peace morement.
So begins Stephen Kohn in his new
book, "Jailed for Peace: The History of
American Draft Law Violators, 1658-
1985." He has written this book, he
says, to fill an "unfortune void." Ac
cording to Kohn, no book had been
published that fully documents the his
tory and political impact of anti-war
conscientious objectors.
"Jailed for Peace" is excellent in
many respects. Concise and clearly
written, it makes important points and
supports them with a strong collection
of evidence. Although somewhat
flawed and not nearly the comprehen
sive survey Kohn suggests, this work
deserves reading. If Greenwood Press
does a good job of promotion and dis
tribution, "Jailed For Peace" will itself
make a significant and lasting contribu
tion to liberty and world peace.
The people and ideas Kohn ex
amines are not often found in U.S. his
tory texts or in television network spe
cials which "relive" the dramas of this
war or that. Reminding us that "it was
not warriors alone who carved out the
New World in America,"he first intro
duces 17th century settlers who
refused to own slaves, steal land from
the Indians or be conscripted into the
King's armies. Following this strain of
peace-making through the Revolution
ary War years, when every colony with
a sizable pacifist population
recognized conscientious objection as

valid exemption from military service,
Kohn notes that these rights were
protected "even when the invasion of
important cities by British troops
seemed imminent."
"Jailed for Peace" is a long, deep his
tory of resistance. It includes slavery
abolitionists of the mid-1800s, who
called for a campaign of civil dis
obedience to end war; incarcerated
World War I military refusers, who
started a tradition of work strikes and
other protests of prison conditions;
and World War II conscientious objec
tors, who decided they'd had enough
of alternative service and walked out of
work camps.
After covering the early Cold War
years, Kohn devotes special attention
to the Vietnam anti-conscription move
ment, which literally defeated the draft
and accelerated the war's end. It was
fascinating to learn new information
about this period, such as the fact that
morale within Selective Service
dropped precipitously as anti-draft ac
tivity spread; the staff turnover rate in
creased from 6 percent to 18 percent
between 1965 and 1968.
Kohn next turns to contempo
rary resistance. Levels of draft law

violation, in the form of non-registra
tion, are substantially higher than ever
before. Kohn says he believes the
"overwhelming" majority of at least
500,000 non-registrants will continue to
escape prosecution. Presidential ad
visors, including Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger, fear the anti-draft
movement will unite with the anti
nuclear movement to become a more
effective anti-war campaign.
Examining the "enormous prob
lems" confronting the registration pro
gram, Kohn calls this loose network of
groups and individuals "potentially the
most effective anti-draft movement in
American history," and indeed there
are many who believe it has already
delayed government efforts to bring
back inductions and even helped limit
direct U.S. military involvement in
Central America.
As he documents non-cooperation,
Kohn attempts to show an evolution, a
broadening of its philosophies and tac
tics. Each new generation of resisters,
he says, took inspiration from and
added to the ideas of previous genera
tions, so that by the 19605, "the base of
the draft resistance movement had ex
panded far beyond the narrow pacifist

and religious communities."
This evolutionary analysis, while
useful in identifying trends, is overly
simplistic. History has more ragged
edges, more clouded distinctions, than
Kohn presents. For example, while it is
true that many early American resisters
were pacifists, one cannot say, as Kohn
does, that anti-draft efforts up into the
1800s were "strictly" pacifist.
Numerous non-pacifists immigrated to
a young United States to avoid con
scription in their homelands. American
resistance r o the draft has stemmed
from a wide range of motivations and
ideals, and the beliefs of colonial ob
jectors can be categorized no more
neatly than those of their modern
counterparts.
Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of
"Jailed for Peace" is Kohn's failure to
clarify that the ranks of anti-draft move
ments have always included people
who have no immediate or even possi
ble military obligation. Women and
older men, such as the famous anar
chists Emma Goldman and Dr. Ben
jamin Spock, have organized side-by
side with non-cooperators, often
taking equal or greater risks. Males too
young to be drafted have also aided the

fight against forced soldiering. These
resisters merit much more discussion
and credit than Kohn gives them.

pendence, extensive case law and

obedience to end war; incarcerated
World War I military refusers, who
started a tradition of work strikes and
other protests of prison conditions;
and World War II conscientious objec
tors, who decided they'd had enough
of alternative service and walked out of
work camps.
After covering the early Cold War
years, Kohn devotes special attention
to the Vietnam anti-conscription move
ment, which literally defeated the draft
and accelerated the war's end. It was
fascinating to learn new information
about this period, such as the fact that
morale within Selective Service
dropped precipitously as anti-draft ac
tivity spread; the staff turnover rate in
creased from 6 percent to 18 percent
between 1965 and 1968.
Kohn next turns to contempo
rary resistance. Levels of draft law

violation, in the form of non-registra
tion, are substantially higher than ever
before. Kohn says he believes the
"overwhelming" majority of at least
500,000 non-registrants will continue to
escape prosecution. Presidential ad
visors, including Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger, fear the anti-draft
movement will unite with the anti
nuclear movement to become a more
effective anti-war campaign.
Examining the "enormous prob
lems" confronting the registration pro
gram, Kohn calls this loose network of
groups and individuals "potentially the
most effective anti-draft movement in
American history," and indeed there
are many who believe it has already
delayed government efforts to bring
back inductions and even helped limit
direct U.S. military involvement in
Central America.
As he documents non-cooperation,
Kohn attempts to show an evolution, a
broadening of its philosophies and tac
tics. Each new generation of resisters,
he says, took inspiration from and
added to the ideas of previous genera
tions, so that by the 19605, "the base of
the draft resistance movement had ex
panded far beyond the narrow pacifist

and religious communities."
This evolutionary analysis, while
useful in identifying trends, is overly
simplistic. History has more ragged
edges, more clouded distinctions, than
Kohn presents. For example, while it is
true that many early American resisters
were pacifists, one cannot say, as Kohn
does, that anti-draft efforts up into the
1800s were "strictly" pacifist.
Numerous non-pacifists immigrated to
a young United States to avoid con
scription in their homelands. American
resistance r o the draft has stemmed
from a wide range of motivations and
ideals, and the beliefs of colonial ob
jectors can be categorized no more
neatly than those of their modern
counterparts.
Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of
"Jailed for Peace" is Kohn's failure to
clarify that the ranks of anti-draft move
ments have always included people
who have no immediate or even possi
ble military obligation. Women and
older men, such as the famous anar
chists Emma Goldman and Dr. Ben
jamin Spock, have organized side-by
side with non-cooperators, often
taking equal or greater risks. Males too
young to be drafted have also aided the

fight against forced soldiering. These
resisters merit much more discussion
and credit than Kohn gives them.
The final chapters of the book
chronicle legal history and comment
on the place of civil disobedience in
the American democratic tradition.
Here Kohn, who is himself a lawyer,
advances some of his boldest claims.
Drawing upon the Declaration ot Inde
pendence, extensive case law and
other sources, he asserts that "direct
action and civil disobedience are con
stitutionally recognized by the very
spirit and underlying premises of U.S.
government." Furthermore, he contin
ues, "juries have the ultimate power to
legalize civil disobedience."
This power of "nullification," de
signed to prevent government oppres
sion, gives juries the irreversible
right to acquit a defendant in a crimi
nal trial, regardless of any and all
"facts" presented during testimony. By
considering this option, a jury acts, in
the words of one federal appeals court
judge, "as spokesman for the commu
nity conscience in determining
whether or not blame can be
imposed."
But, says Kohn, jurors are rarely told
any more that they can legally ignore
and thereby reject the law during their
deliberations. Judges stopped telling
jurors of their nullification powers
during the 19th century, and modern
court decisions have upheld a judge's
right to refuse the information. Poten
tial jurors need to be aware of nullifica
tion before they ever enter the court
room. Kohn's writing may generate
more enthusiasm for public education
and influence a few judges.

It will definitely have an effect on
many who read it, and many should.
There are lessons and a wealth of good
information to be gleaned from this
book. Organizing for peace becomes
easier when more citizens know that a
small but determined minority, even
when suffering extreme public perse
cution, can create tangible social
change.
"Jailed for Peace" is especially ap
propriate for classroom use and for
schools and public libraries. As part of
a Greenwood Press series,
"Contributions in Military Studies, it
goes out to a variety of government
offices and military colleges. Those
already active in anti-war organizing
will find it an inspiring and helpful ref
erence.
Kohn urges that "it is imperative that
society fully recognize and appreciate
the sacrifice, courage and legitimacy of
conscientious objection to war.... The
inhuman barbarism of nuclear
holocaust has forced new generations
to evaluate their willingness to support
warfare in any capacity."
The anti-draft movement cuts
through official debate on military per
sonnel policy to address deeper ques
tions, such as whether the armed
forces should exist at all. Resisters, he
feels, "question the morality of an
assumed reality."
"Jailed for Peace," in telling the
resistance story, furthers that question
ing.
