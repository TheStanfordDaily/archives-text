# Cook may be lost for season
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The Stanford secondary suffered a serious
loss Saturday when cornerback Toi Cook, the
nation's interception leader, fractured his left
wrist in the game against San Diego State.
Cook underwent surgety to insert a screw
in the wrist yesterday morning at the Stanford
Medical Center. Doctors said he will be out
eight to 10 weeks, but Cook said he hopes to
be back within six.

"It might heal faster, so I can be back ear
lier," Cook said yesterday evening. "They're
not going to rush me back unless it has healed
early."
The injur}' occured on the fourth play of the
game, after San Diego State fullback Corey
Gilmore caught a short pass from Jim Plum.
"He cut up toward the middle," Cook said,
"and Dave Wyman and Barry McKeever hit
him from the inside, 1 hit him from the
outside, and they just rolled over onto my
wrist. That's all 1 remember."
Cook's wrist was dislocated one inch at the
time he was taken to the Palo Alto Medical
Center. Team doctor Don Bunce manipulated
the gap to two or three millimeters, at which
point the wrist could have healed without sur
gery in three to six months.
Bunce performed the two-hour surgery
yesterday on the navicular bone of the wrist in
consultation with Dr. Rod Hence, a bone spe
cialist at the Medical Center. Hence has
worked with other athletes, most recently
Ronnie Lott of the San Francisco 49ers.
The official word is that Cook will miss the
final seven games of the regular season, but
should be able to play if the Cardinal goes to a
postseason bowl game â€” a good possibility
given Stanford's 4-0 start. Cook, however, said

he hopes to be back for Big Game against Cal
ifornia in seven weeks. The Cardinal is idle
the week before. If he were back by then, he
would also be able to play in the regular
season finale against Arizona at Tokyo, Japan.
Cook had five interceptions, six pass deflec
tions and 14 tackles in Stanford's first three
games. He had three interceptions in the
season opener at Texas and two against San
Jose State the following week. In his three
previous seasons, two as a starter, he inter
cepted nine passes and led the team in that
category the past two years. He was expected
to earn All-Pacific 10 Conference honors this
season.
Cook's replacement is Pat Kelly, a third-year
sophomore who has seen limited action the
past two seasons. Kelly made six tackles Satur
day in helping the secondary to its third game
without surrendering a touchdown pass.
"Pat's a good, solid player," Cook said.
"He's got good technique. There was a lot of
talk about our secondary having a lack of
depth, but Pat's an adequate replacement.
They're all adequate replacements."
Linebacker Kurt Colehower said, "More
than anything, it's psychological. Toi's such a
sure thing on the corner. He really knows the
position."
