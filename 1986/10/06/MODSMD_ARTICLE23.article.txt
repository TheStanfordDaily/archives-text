### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Flaying before a capacity crowd at
DeGuerre Pool on Saturday, the No. 1
ranked Stanford men's water polo
team culminated a dominating
weekend of play bv trouncing No. 2
California 9-7 in a match that was not as
close as the score indicated. The team
won the Northern California Water
Polo Tournament and pushed its
record to 19-0.
The Cirdinal defeated UC-Davis 17-4
and the University of the Pacific 13-3
on Friday and Fresno State 13-5 on Sat
urday to set up the meeting between
the top two teams in the country.
Instead of a closely contested match,
however, Stanford dominated play
from the opening whistle, taking a 6-2
lead by the end of the first quarter
' I think we played really tentatively
in the first period, and Stanford was
really on," California Coach Pete
Cutino said. "They really took advan
tage of the little mistakes that we
made."
In the first period, Erich Fischer
scored three of his team-high four
goals to set the tone for the match in
the early going. The junior from Reed
ley, Calif, scored 11 goals during the
weekend to bring his goal output to 46
on the season. Fie has tallied as many
goals this season as he has in his two
previous years at Stanford.
"Our offense has improved mainly

because of Erich Fischer," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "He has
really taken up the slack since last
year."
The first quarter was simply a
showcase for the Cardinal offense.
With goalies Todd Kemp and Obi
Greenman beginning the offense with
long passes to both sides of the pool,
Stanford's counter-attacking style was
working in high gear. The Cardinal's
team speed proved to be too much for
the Bears.
"The thing that really makes our of
fense go is our counter-attack," Detta

manti said. "We wear teams down with
it."
Most productive in the frequent
counter-attacks were seniors Dave Im
bernino and Craig Klass. Imbernino
contributed four goals in the contest
and eight goals during the four-game
tournament, with Klass scoring once
against Cal and six times in the tourna
ment.
The second and third periods dem
onstrated the prowess of the Stanford
defense. By the end of the third quar
ter, after shutting out Cal for two quar

ters, Stanford led by a commanding 8-2
margin.
"Two things make our defense as
strong as it is," Dettamanti said.
"Experience and excellent goalies.
Most of them have been together for
four years. We have a great team
defense."
In the match's closing minutes, Cal
managed to whittle the Cardinal lead
to its final 9- 7 score only after Detta
manti had taken out his entire starting
lineup.

It may be that the only way any water polo team is going to knock off Dave Imbernino (above) and his Stanford
teammates is if the Cardinal is forced to play with its eyes closed. This weekend, Stanford improved to 19-0 with four
victories in the NorCal Tourney at DeGuerre Pool.
