# Spikers surprise ASU, big crowd
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Now they know they can win, and
win big.
Thursday, the women's volleyball
team traveled to Arizona to find out if it
had what it takes to be among the top
squads in the collegiate ranks. The
Cardinal returned home yesterday af
ternoon knowing that it could not only
play with the nation's best, but beat
them — soundly.
Friday night, Stanford defeated
Arizona in four games. The Cardinal
came back Saturday to win again, this
time in three games and over seventh
ranked Arizona State. The victories up
the team's record to 8-5 overall and 5-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
While they knew the Arizona game
would not Ik* a cakewalk, it was the
ASU game that the spikers knew would
set the tone for the rest of the season.
So after a 15-11, 14-16, 15-4, 15-4 win
over the Wildcats in a game marred
only by the second game, in which the
Cardinal failed to take advantage of a
10-3 lead, Stanford got down to busi
ness and pulled together for its best
match of the season.
"We probably played our most com
plete match from start to finish,"
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said "We
jumped on them from the beginning.
We didn't give them a chance."
Not only did the Cardinal have to
overcome a highly touted Sun Devil
team, but it had to defeat a record
breaking ASU crowd as well. According
to sophomore middle blocker Laura

Olesen, over 8,000 fans showed up for
the match to cheer their team to vic
tory and to win the free dinners that
were given out as bait to insure that at
tendance records were broken.
"We kind of quieted them down,"
Olesen said.
Both Olesen and Nieves said that the
15-9, 15-8, 15-6 "romp" — as Olesen
put it — over the Sun Devils was more
than just Stanford's eighth win.
"We went into the ASU match
knowing that against the really top
teams we'd played well, and we felt
good about that," Nieves said. "But we
hadn't won these games. To play well
and come away with a win is really a
shot in our arm. It's great for our confi
dence."
According to Olesen, the ASU team
walked onto the court looking very
sure of itself, but after the No. 13 Card
inal had annihilated it in front of 8,000
dumbfounded fans, "they looked real
down."
Stanford, Olesen said, played its
most unified, spirited match of the fall
"We a really good team
oriented kind of game," she said. "This
was a very important game We really
had to win."
Nieves pointed to Theresa Smith's
serving and the middle blocking of
Olesen and Nancy Reno as the keys to
the victory. Smith, a sophomore hitter
and one of Stanford's three partici
pants in this summer's Olympic Fes
tival, has developed a jump serve
that has been wreaking havoc on the
opposition ever since she unveiled her
secret weapon early this season.
The jump serve, which can be seen
fairly often in men's play, is a rarity in
women's volleyball. According to
Nieves, the Cardinal has seen only one
jump server this season.
"Theresa had seven aces versus
Arizona and five versus Arizona State.
Her closest competitor in that category
had two aces," Nieves said. "She
turned both matches around early."
The Sun Devils' top weapon was no
secret: Tammy Webb, a senior All-
America hitter. According to Nieves, by
stopping Webb, Olesen and Reno
stopped an ASU offense that depends
on its big hitter playing her best.

"They need her to play well, they
thrive on her getting hot, Nieves said.
"Olesen and Reno just shut her down
with their blocking."
Olesen said, that other than the
team's loss of concentration in its
second game versus Arizona, Stanford
had a fairly easy time defeating the un
ranked Wildcats.
"We just played our game. We
played a steady game," Olesen said.
According to both Nieves and
Olesen, the graduation of standout
Missy McLinden has left Arizona in
poor shape. "They definitely miss her,
Nieves said. "They just don't have the
firepower without her "
The Cardinal's next matches will be
this weekend at Maples Pavilion in the
Josten's Invitational, which will include
teams from Colorado State, Illinois
State and top-ranked San Jose State.
Now they know they can win, and
win big.

played a steady game," Olesen said.
According to both Nieves and
Olesen, the graduation of standout
Missy McLinden has left Arizona in
poor shape. "They definitely miss her,
Nieves said. "They just don't have the
firepower without her "
The Cardinal's next matches will be
this weekend at Maples Pavilion in the
Josten's Invitational, which will include
teams from Colorado State, Illinois
State and top-ranked San Jose State.
Now they know they can win, and
win big.
Thursday, the women's volleyball
team traveled to Arizona to find out if it
had what it takes to be among the top
squads in the collegiate ranks. The
Cardinal returned home yesterday af
ternoon knowing that it could not only
play with the nation's best, but beat
them — soundly.
Friday night, Stanford defeated
Arizona in four games. The Cardinal
came back Saturday to win again, this
time in three games and over seventh
ranked Arizona State. The victories up
the team's record to 8-5 overall and 5-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
While they knew the Arizona game
would not Ik* a cakewalk, it was the
ASU game that the spikers knew would
set the tone for the rest of the season.
So after a 15-11, 14-16, 15-4, 15-4 win
over the Wildcats in a game marred
only by the second game, in which the
Cardinal failed to take advantage of a
10-3 lead, Stanford got down to busi
ness and pulled together for its best
match of the season.
"We probably played our most com
plete match from start to finish,"
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said "We
jumped on them from the beginning.
We didn't give them a chance."
Not only did the Cardinal have to
overcome a highly touted Sun Devil
team, but it had to defeat a record
breaking ASU crowd as well. According
to sophomore middle blocker Laura

Olesen, over 8,000 fans showed up for
the match to cheer their team to vic
tory and to win the free dinners that
were given out as bait to insure that at
tendance records were broken.
"We kind of quieted them down,"
Olesen said.
Both Olesen and Nieves said that the
15-9, 15-8, 15-6 "romp" — as Olesen
put it — over the Sun Devils was more
than just Stanford's eighth win.
"We went into the ASU match
knowing that against the really top
teams we'd played well, and we felt
good about that," Nieves said. "But we
hadn't won these games. To play well
and come away with a win is really a
shot in our arm. It's great for our confi
dence."
According to Olesen, the ASU team
walked onto the court looking very
sure of itself, but after the No. 13 Card
inal had annihilated it in front of 8,000
dumbfounded fans, "they looked real
down."
Stanford, Olesen said, played its
most unified, spirited match of the fall
"We a really good team
oriented kind of game," she said. "This
was a very important game We really
had to win."
Nieves pointed to Theresa Smith's
serving and the middle blocking of
Olesen and Nancy Reno as the keys to
the victory. Smith, a sophomore hitter
and one of Stanford's three partici
pants in this summer's Olympic Fes
tival, has developed a jump serve
that has been wreaking havoc on the
opposition ever since she unveiled her
secret weapon early this season.
The jump serve, which can be seen
fairly often in men's play, is a rarity in
women's volleyball. According to
Nieves, the Cardinal has seen only one
jump server this season.
"Theresa had seven aces versus
Arizona and five versus Arizona State.
Her closest competitor in that category
had two aces," Nieves said. "She
turned both matches around early."
The Sun Devils' top weapon was no
secret: Tammy Webb, a senior All-
America hitter. According to Nieves, by
stopping Webb, Olesen and Reno
stopped an ASU offense that depends
on its big hitter playing her best.

"They need her to play well, they
thrive on her getting hot, Nieves said.
"Olesen and Reno just shut her down
with their blocking."
Olesen said, that other than the
team's loss of concentration in its
second game versus Arizona, Stanford
had a fairly easy time defeating the un
ranked Wildcats.
"We just played our game. We
played a steady game," Olesen said.
According to both Nieves and
Olesen, the graduation of standout
Missy McLinden has left Arizona in
poor shape. "They definitely miss her,
Nieves said. "They just don't have the
firepower without her "
The Cardinal's next matches will be
this weekend at Maples Pavilion in the
Josten's Invitational, which will include
teams from Colorado State, Illinois
State and top-ranked San Jose State.
