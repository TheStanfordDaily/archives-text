# Women's soccer works overtime vs. Sonoma St.
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
After 120 minutes of back-and
forth action, the Stanford and
Sonoma State women's soccer teams
had to settle for a 1-1 tie Friday at
Maloney Field.
"We thought we probably could
beat them," Stanford Coach Helen
Keohane said. "Both teams had a lot
of chances, so I guess it was fair that
it was a tie."
Friday's result brings the Card
inals season record to 1-5-1, with the
team's lone victory coming in its pre
vious contest at Rhode Island on
Sept. 25.
Stanford looked to be on the road
to its second straight victory as it
controlled the pace of the first half.
"We played really well the first half
of the game," Keohane said.

Manda Dunlop put the Cardinal
ahead 1-0 in the eighth minute of the
game. It was her first goal of the
season.
Despite several opportunities,
Stanford could not increase its lead.
Sonoma eventually tied the score in
the 11th minute of the second half,
and the game went to overtime.
"One of the overtimes, we played
well, and the other, they did,"
Keohane said.
Neither team could score in the
first or second overtime, however,
and the game ended in a tie.
"They were ranked, I think, sixth
in the Western region," Keohane
said. "(So) it was a decent result."
Though her team has been on the
winning side only once this season,
Keohane indicated that the players
are holding up well. "It's frustrating
that we're not winning as many

games as we could, but we're playing
better," she said.
Fart of the struggle this season has
been a result of a relatively inexperi
enced lineup. "The majority of the
players are sophomores," Keohane
said. "It's a young group. Hopefully,
if they hang in there, we'll do well in
a couple of years. 1 know that's hard
to swallow."
Stanford's Achilles' heel so far has
been an unproductive offense.
"We've had trouble scoring goals,"
Keohane said. "We just don't have
one person who's a good finisher.
It's no one person's fault."
Defensively, the Cardinal has been
respectable, considering the team's
competition. "You'll have to assume
that they (the Stanford defense) will
give up a goal a game — not because
of the players, but because of the
teams we're playing," Keohane said.
