# Stanford a winner at home

### 
After being shut out its last four
games, the Stanford men's soccer team
got a much-needed 1-0 victory over
Westmont Saturday at Maloney Field,
raising its record to 4-5-2 on the
season.
Jim Cole assisted Chris Porch to give
the Cardinal its long sought-after goal.
It also marked Porch's first goal of the
season.
"We played well,'' Stanford Coach
Sam Koch said. "There were times
when we played extremely well. There
were times when we had breakdowns.
We played well enough to win, and
that's what's important."
Westmont surged with moments left
in the game, but the Stanford defense
was able to hold.
"(Goalkeeper) Tom Austin played a
suner aame." Koch said.
