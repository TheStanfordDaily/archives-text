# Olesen, Card women cross finish line first
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
The hot Falo Alto weather Saturday
morning was only outdone by the
scorching performances of the Stan
ford cross country teams, as the Card
inal women and Stanford senior Marc
Olesen successfully defended their
titles in the 13th Annual Stanford Invi
tational Cross Country Meet.
The victory marked the Cardinal
women's seventh consecutive champi
onship at the Invitational.
As if the performances of Olesen
and the Stanford women's team were
not enough, the Cardinal men gar
nered a second place finish, narrowly
losing to North Carolina State by three
points.
"I feel good about the efforts of both
teams," Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson said.
"The women were a very pleasant
surprise," he said. "I know we're good,
but there were eight teams in the top
20 here.
"We will now build off of the inertia
and momentum from the win,"
Johnson added.
Freshman Carol Gray, who finished
seventh, shared Johnson's enthusiam.
"I'm happy that we pulled it off as a
team,'' she said. "This year we have
more team unity. If we keep working
together like we have been, we'll go
through the season undefeated."
In contrast to the strong sense of
team unity that pervades the Cardinal
cross country squads, one individual
nonetheless has risen to national
prominence. Marc Olesen, the fourth
place finisher in the 1985 NCAA Cham
pionships and the top returning scorer
this year, crossed the finish line of the
10,000 meter course alone Saturday in
an impressive 30:38.5 for his second
Stanford Invitational title in as many
years.
"It was a good run for me," Olesen
said. "I ran close to my best time on
the course.
"I had a hard run, but I wasn t put up
against the wall," he added.
Olesen was equally pleased with the
squad's performance. "The team beat
the teams we need to beat to go to

NCAAs, he said. "We just need to
move the fourth and fifth men up (in
their times)."
"Marc did what lie had to do,"
Johnson said. "Now we have to get the
fourth, fifth and sixth men up. This
meet was a weather vane. It points us

in tJit* right direction. Now we need to
go there."
Johnson was overtly optimistic about
the remainder of the season. "We're
the best on the West Coast," he ;x(ded,
"and that's going to get us to (the NCAA
championships in) Arizona."
