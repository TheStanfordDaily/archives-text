# Field hockey shuts out UOP
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
One of the basic strategies in field
hockey is to get a shot on goal
whenever you can, no matter what the
angle or the goalie's position. A clear
shot on goal could result in a lucky
rebound right to a teammate, a short
corner opportunity, or the ball might
just squeeze through the goalkeeper's
pads and into the cage.
When Ami Chitwood drove the ball
at the University of the Pacific cage
from 20 feet down the endline, the last
thing she was expecting, midway
through the first half, was to score the
game-winning goal. She did though
and Stanford defeated the the visiting

Tigers 1-0 to put its record at 3-4-1
overall and 1-1-1 in Northern Pacific
Conference play. UOP dropped to 3-4
overall, 2-1 in the conference.
The Cardinal won despite taking an
uncharacteristically low number of
shots. Usually, the team finds itself far
ahead in the shots-taken category,
while its opponents take many fewer
shots but have a far higher percentage
of their shots actually score.
Saturday, the situation was reversed
as UOP gave sophomore All-NorPac
goalie Karen Jones her share of save
opportunities, and Stanford, though al
most always threatening, got few balls
into the crease.
Chitwood's game winner came after
sophomore wing Laura Gartland

carried the ball through just about the
entire Tiger defense before knocking a
shot off the right pad of the UOP
goalie.
Chitwood, a junior forward, con
trolled the ball at the endline, and with
the defense behind the play, had a
clear if unlikely shot at the cage.
Her drive went between the
goalkeeper's pads and glanced off
them into the goal, giving the
surprised Cardinal a 1-0 lead.
Stanford's defensive unit, which due
to injuries is made up largely of players
moved from offensive positions, took it
from there, keeping the ball out of its
end for the majority of the match and
giving up few corners.
