Harvard University has divested
from eight companies that do business
in Soutli Africa, including five in which
Stanford owns stock.
Harvard announced Thursday that it
had sold $150 million worth of stock in
Ford Motor Company; Schlumberger
Co., an oil ifiilTiiig concern; Phelps
Dodge, a mining company: and five oil
companies â€” Chevron, Exxon, Mobil,
Royal Dutch Petroleum and Texaco.
Stanford owns stock worth approxi
mately $29.5 million in Ford, Chevron,
Schlumherger, Mobil, Exxon and
Texaco.
Roderick MacDougall, Harvard's
treasurer, said Harvard's sales grew out
of the university's policv of selective di
vestment. according to a New York
I imes report.
The Times, quoting a Harvard
report, said the decision to sell the oil
company stocks was due to a South
African law. The law prohibits oil com
parties from giving information to
shareholders about sales of petroleum
products to the military or police.
Reportedly, the law also requires the
companies to supply oil products to
the government on demand.
Harvard decided to divest from Ford
because its South African subsidiary,
SAMCOR, continues to bid for govern
ment sales.
Schlumberger and Phelps Dodge ap
parently failed to provide Harvard with
enough information about their South
African operations and their compli
ance with the Sullivan Principles.
Stanford's Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility will not change its
agenda because of Harvard's action,
said Prof. Frederick Hillier, chairman
of the commission.
Hillier, an operations research pro
fessor, said Chevron, Ford, Mobil and
Texaco were among several compan
ies whose South African operations
were scrutinized this summer by Politi
cal Science Prof. Richard Rrody Hillier
said that Rrody, last year's OR chair
man, prepared reports on those com
panics and said the CIR will review the
reports later this fall
