BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Australia will take a 2-1 lead into the "reverse
singles of the Davis Cup tennis semifinal after Ken Flach and Paul Annacone pulled
out a doubles victory yesterday to keep the United States' hopes alive.
Flach and Annacone, who had not played tc>gether since they were in the junior
ranks, defeated Pat Cash and John Fitzgerald 8-10, 1-6, 7-5, 13-11, 9-7 in a match
that was resumed yesterday with the Americans trailing by two sets to one.
Cash will tace Brad Gilbert in the opening "reverse singles" at the Milton
courts today with Australia s Paul McNamee then due to face American Tim
Mayotte.
Flach and Annacone knew they had to win yesterday to keep alive U.S. hopes of
winning the international tennis trophy for the first time since 1982.
The makeshift pair, playing together only because Flach's regular partner,
Robert Seguso, was injured, gave a brave display, matching the more experienced
Australian combination shot for shot.
The match lasted almost five hours in total, with the desperately close final two
sets lasting two hours.
Cash, as is allowed under Davis Cup rules, elected not to play his singles
against Gilbert yesterday, and both "reverse singles" were switched to today.
Flach and Annacone, who were regular partners as juniors, displayed tremen
dous tenacity. Flach, particularly, was fired up.
"Ken has a tremendous drive that is contagious," said U.S. captain Tom Gor
man.
The Australians had much in their favor in the doubles, including the grass
courts, a fierr#» <nn and a partisan crowd.
