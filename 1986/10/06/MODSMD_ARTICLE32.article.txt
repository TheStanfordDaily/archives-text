# Career Fair brings 96 businesses to Farm
## 
### LISA WOLF 
Whether you hold lofty aspirations for future
employment or merely need a means to pay your
tuition debt, Friday's Career Fair was for you. Or
ganized by the Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC), the fair brought 96 different busi
nesses to White Plaza.
"The fair is set up to enhance the pre-existing,
give-and-take relationship between potential
employees and employers. We are providing a
relaxed atmosphere both to establish initial con
tacts and to answer basic questions," said Yolande
Morales, the event's organizer.

The CPPC organizes the fair to provide students
the opportunity to investigate career options by
bringing potential employers to campus.
More than 300 businesses, representing techni
cal and non-technical fields, participated in this
year's fair.
"A major goal for this year was to increase the
number of booths promoting public service or
ganizations alongside the more mainstream job
opportunities," said one CPPC worker. Twenty
one different public service groups attended the
fair, including CALPIRG (California Public Interest
Research Group) and the Peace Corps.
One complaint about the event was its timing.

"1 need to work out this quarters schedule before
I can even begin to think about next year s plans,
said an English major.
Organizers ol the fair acknowledged a flaw and
said that next year they would try to hold the
event during the second week of classes. It is
really never too early to start thinking about your
career, but the first week of classes is a pretty hec
tic time," said a CPPC worker.
Still, the fair had no shortage of enthusiasm on
the pan of either students or business representa
tives, many of whom are Stanford alumni.
An Arthur Anderson recruiter said, I haven't
been away from here so long that I ve forgotten

how scary looking for a job can be.
"I think students would be happy to know that
we, the businesses, want to attract and impress
the students as much as they want to attract and
impress us."
Its nice to be able to just talk to potential
employers without worrying about making an im
pression," said one economics major. Fhis is
probably the only time I II lx* able to talk to an in
vestment banker while wearing shorts and a
ripped t shirt," he said.
The center's next major event is a career explo
ration series scheduled tor February.
