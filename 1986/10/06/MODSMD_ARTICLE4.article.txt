# 1952, 1986: Cardinal 4-0
## SPORTS 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The year was 1952. Harry Truman
was in the White House. There was a
senior quarterback at Washington
State named Jack Elway. And Stan
ford University had a football team
that began the year by winning its
first four games.
It took 34 years for a Stanford foot
ball team to repeat the trick. And in
yesterdays 17-10 victory over San
Diego State, the Cardinal relied on a

time-tested formula to remain unde
feated at 4-0: combine a suffocating
defense with an effective ground
game.
It may not he exciting football, hut
it certainly is winning football. The
Stanford defense avenged a 513-yard
A/tec outburst a year ago by holding
San Diego State to 234 yards and
only one touchdown that came with
4:30 to play. Meanwhile, running
back Brad Muster ground out 115
yards on 21 carries with one touch
down, running behind a line without

starting tackles Jeff Marchin and John
Zentner.
"The defense as a whole played
our best game all year," outside
linebacker Kurt Colehower said.
"We maintained the intensity longer
than we have all year."
"They've got a better defense,"
San Diego State Coach Denny Stolz
said. "Their defense was incredible."
Linebackers David Wyman and
Harry McKeever had 15 and 13
