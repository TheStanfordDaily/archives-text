# 1952, 1986: Cardinal 4-0
## SPORTS 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The year was 1952. Harry Truman
was in the White House. There was a
senior quarterback at Washington
State named Jack Elway. And Stan
ford University had a football team
that began the year by winning its
first four games.
It took 34 years for a Stanford foot
ball team to repeat the trick. And in
yesterdays 17-10 victory over San
Diego State, the Cardinal relied on a

time-tested formula to remain unde
feated at 4-0: combine a suffocating
defense with an effective ground
game.
It may not he exciting football, hut
it certainly is winning football. The
Stanford defense avenged a 513-yard
A/tec outburst a year ago by holding
San Diego State to 234 yards and
only one touchdown that came with
4:30 to play. Meanwhile, running
back Brad Muster ground out 115
yards on 21 carries with one touch
down, running behind a line without

starting tackles Jeff Marchin and John
Zentner.
"The defense as a whole played
our best game all year," outside
linebacker Kurt Colehower said.
"We maintained the intensity longer
than we have all year."
"They've got a better defense,"
San Diego State Coach Denny Stolz
said. "Their defense was incredible."

tackles, respectively, to lead the defensive ef
fort, and seven Cardinal defenders sacked Az
tec quarterback Jim Plum, starting in place of
the injured Todd Santos.
The front three is where our defense
starts, Colehower said in reference to down
linemen Tony I.eiker, Ray Huckestein and
Lester Archambeau. "They make the lineback
ers look like linebackers should. They control
the line, and we're supposed to make the
tackles."
The front seven held San Diego State to
only 39 yards rushing in 39 attempts. It was
the second straight game the Cardinal has
allowed exactly one yard per rush.
The secondary, though, suffered a severe
loss when senior cornerback Toi Cook
fractured his left wrist on the fourth play of
the game. Cook underwent surgery yesterday
morning and may miss the rest of the season.
Pat Kelly came on to replace Cook and
helped the secondary hold Plum without a
touchdown pass. In four games, the only
scoring pass against the Cardinal was a ques
tionable play in the fourth quarter of last
week's game at Oregon State.
Offensively, Muster managed his first 100-
yard game of the season, largely behind the
blocking of Kurt Josephson and Tom Nye. For
Josephson, it was his first game ever at tackle,
moving from guard to take the place of
Zentner.
"We know when we get a great running
play," Josephson said. "We knew the running
game was well over 100 yards. On Brad's last
touchdown run, he ran right up my butt. It
feels great when it works that way."
Muster explained that the Aztecs' 4-3
defense shifted to the tight end side, putting a
defensive tackle in the guard-tackle gap, and a
defensive end in the tackle-tight end gap. Nye
and Josephson were able to kick out the
linemen to spring Muster.
"I felt we had better control of the line of
scrimmage today," quarterback John Paye
said. "The offensive line was more in control
than in our last game."
Paye, however, had a subpar outing, com
pleting 15 of 26 passes for 162 yards. The ab
sence of wide receiver Jeff James, out with a
sprained heel, was apparent. Thomas Henley,
the other wide receiver, had three spectacular
catches — one for a touchdown — but none

of James' replacements made a reception.
James had caught 18 passes in his first two
games to lead the nation.
"I feel confident with Jeff in there,' Paye
said. "It's now three years that we've been
working together, so we can tell what each
other is doing out there.''
"With J.J. on one side and me on the other,
we have a threat," Henley said. "Teams can't
just play one or the other. They can't double
on me and leave Jeff open, or double him and
leave me open."
James said he will play next week against
No. 12 Washington. "For sure. They'll have to
hold me down with chains and ropes to keep
me out of that one," he said.
Despite an improved running game, the of
fense put only 17 points on the board for the
second straight game. "You look at the last
couple of games, where we have scored early,
and then we get complacent," Muster said.
"We've got to play series in and series out and
not look at the scoreboard."
The Cardinal again had trouble on third
down, converting only 5 of 12 opportunities.
"I think we just have not come up with that
third down conversion play," Paye said. "We
just haven't found our personality yet to get
that third down play. It's a matter of everyone
doing what they're supposed to. Someone
makes a mistake, and we can't make any
mistakes."
San Diego State took a 3-0 lead in the first
quarter on a 42-yard field goal by Kevin Rahill,
but the Cardinal came back to take a 7-3 lead
on its next possession when Paye found Hen
ley in the end zone from 19 yards out to cap a
nine-play, 78-yard drive.
It appeared Aztec cornerback Clarence
Nunn had intercepted Paye in the end zone,
but Henley reached around to take the ball
away. "I reached a hand in to knock it out,"
Henley said. "It went into the air, and I just
reached out and grabbed it."
The Cardinal mounted another drive late in
the first half, keyed by a 24-yard burst by
Muster, to move to the San Diego State three,
but on third-and-goal, Paye was sacked by
blitzing linebacker Richard Brown. A 29-yard
field goal by David Sweeney gave the Cardinal
a 10-3 halftime edge.
The Cardinal opened the second half by
moving to the Aztec 33, but on fourth-and
one, Muster was stopped cold for no gain.

On its next possession, Stanford moved 80
yards in six plays as Muster went three yards
off tackle for the score. Henley had catches of
20 and 37 yards to set up the touchdown.
San Diego State came back to reach the
Stanford 6. Needing two touchdowns, Stolz
sent fullback Corey Gilmore off guard on
fourth-and-two, but cornerback Alan Grant
stopped him a yard shy of the marker.
On their next possession, the Aztecs went
61 yards as tailback Chris Hardy went in from
a yard out to close the gap to 17-10 with 4:30
to play.
The Cardinal took less than three minutes
off the clock, and following a Doug Robison
punt, San Diego State took over on its 21 with
1:49 to play. Then the Cardinal defense sealed
the verdict. Huckestein sacked Plum for a loss
of four, then Colehower recovered a fumbled
snap at the Aztec 13-
With No. 12 Washington coming into Stan
ford Stadium, the problem of scoring must be
solved. But there is no panic among the Card
inal. "It's going to click," Josephson said. "We
can't do anything about today, but we know
we're on the verge of putting it all together."
"We don't have a problem scoring more
points than the other team because of our
defense," Muster said. "'As long as we win
games, there's no problem. I'm not real con
cerned about things. I think they'll take care
of themselves."
Card notes
By holding San Diego State to 10 points, the
Cardinal is now allowing an average of 11.8 points
per game to lead the Pacific 10 Conference.
With his 115 yards yesterday, Muster passed
Bobby Grayson and Bill Tarr to move into fourth
place on the Stanford all-time rushing list. Muster
now has 1,660 yards in his career, only 29 behind
Vincent White, who is in third place.
Stanford, ranked No. 20 by United Press Interna
tional going into Saturday's game, but only No. 23
by the Associated Press, will have a difficult time
moving into the AP Top 20 this week. Only No. 15
UCLA, No. 17 Michigan State and No. 19 Fresno
State were losers among ranked teams.
This week's game against Washington will begin
at 4 p.m., not 1:30 as printed on tickets. The game
will be carried on national cablfc television by
WTBS.
