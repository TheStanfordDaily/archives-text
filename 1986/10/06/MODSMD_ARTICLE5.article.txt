# Students to give aid to Nicaragua
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
Medical and graduate students com
mitted to improving health services in
Central America plan to send approxi
mately $20,000 worth of equipment
to a private Nicaraguan
hospital next month.
A student group, called the Palo Alto-
Stanford Medical Aid Committee for
Central America (PASMAC), is purchas
ing the supplies from UNICEF. UNICEF
offers this type of aid at a cost substan
tially below retail. The $20,000 in relief
supplies will cost the group about
$5,000.
The group plans to send a represen
tative to Granada, Nicaragua along with
the donated materials in order to
insure that they make it to their des
tination.
"We have a definite idea where the
supplies are going and how they are
used," said Mary Navarro, the group's
coordinator.
The hand-delivery system and the
fact that PASMAC never sends money
are necessary precautions designed to
prevent the Nicaraguan government
from diverting donated resources away
from the hospital singled out by PAS
MAC.
"We don't send things to the
Nicaraguan Ministry of Health. We have
a personal relationship with one hospi
tal so we can make sure what has
arrived," Navarro said.
The hospital chosen by the group is
outside the Nicaraguan civil war zones
and is a low priority for the Sandinista
government.
In 1985, for instance, penicillin sent
by PASMAC was the only supply
available to the hospital all year, she
said.
The group has sent approximately
$25,000 in supplies and equipment, in
cluding text books and respirators, to
the Nicaraguan facility, its "sister hospi
tal," Navarro said.
"We've done all right," she said, add
ing that the group is excited about the
upcoming relief package.
Money for the donated supplies and

equipment comes from fund-raising
events planned by PASMAC. These
events included a benefit, featuring Mi
chael Hedges, and a mailing campaign,
Navarro said, adding that the group
plans to organize several fund-raisers
in the near future.
Jn addition to s-ndins* aid to the
foreign hospital, the group tries to ed
ucate people in this country about a
cause-effect relationship between U.S.
intervention in Nicaragua and a sag
ging health care system in that country,
Navarro said.
The more the United States esca
lates the war, the worse (health care)
will get," she said.
But she added that the group does
not consider itself political. "We don't
do any kind of lobbying. We don't get
directly involved in electing or defeat
ing people running for office.
"Our main concern is that people
who need health care can get some,"
she said.
The group, organized in 19H4, con
sists of a core group of six to eight
medical and graduate students and
staff members. There is also a board of
advisers, which reviews literature pub
lished by the group, helps prioritize
relief requests and suggests ways in
which to combat bureaucracy.
In addition, the board serves as a
resource group when PASMAC or
ganizes events or needs speakers at
Navarro said she would like to ex
pand the group this year to include un
dergraduates. PASMAC will need the
additional help this year since it is
planning to take on another committ
ment. The group hopes to raise money
to purchase equipment and supplies to
stock a clinic in a Managua barrio.
Currently, there is little more than a
building there, Navarro said. "There
are so mm. places where we could be
helpf we could get more (student)
support," she added.
Beginning tomorrow, the group will
meet bi-weekly on Tuesdays at 7:30
p.m. in the Aspen Room of Tresidder
Union. Meetings will include an educa
tional presentation followed by a short
planning session.
