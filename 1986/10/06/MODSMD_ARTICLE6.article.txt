# Intrepid writer blows off steam in tunnels
## FEATURES 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
You probably read about them in The Daily
orientation issue and have been wondering
ibout them since. Your curiosity may even have
ncreased each time you saw a manhole in the
And when you ordered a Domino s Pizza
•our wonderment may have been too much to
Teat as you thought, "If it takes them at least a
lalf hour to find my dorm, it might take them a
ear to find me if I were under it.
I refer, of course, to the University's steam
unnels
Our orientation issue lists them with other
weird fun" to be had here on the Farm In the
ourse of my first week as Hug Me columnist,
in inquirer wanted to know if any maps of
hem existed and, il so, would I please print
hem.
Yes, we have utility record drawings, I
i iv h\ u ilrh Riirh:inan. the director of

Operations and Maintenance. They detail .ill the
tunnels, cables and pipes under the University,
but 1 couldn't see them and I certainly couldn't
publish them.
"Could you tell me where they are?' I asked
Buchanan.
"A few random places, was the noncommit
tal response.
Buchanan went on to tell me that people oc
casionally venture into the tunnels But he said
you couldn't stumble onto them by accident
and that they aren't very pleasant places to ex
plore
I've thought about giving tours so people
would see how unpleasant it really is, Bu
chanan said.
Needless to say. I immediately volunteered.
Buchanan put me in touch with Lois Breckin
ridge ( Breck. to those that know him well),
the supervisor of the University's steanifitters
Sure. I II show vou a few nlaces " he s:«kl

with :i laugh that was just a little too knowing
about what I was in for.
I showed up at the steamfitters shed on
Bonair Siding where I felt slightly un
depressed with my Stanford uniform of shorts,
no socks and sneakers.
"VC'e can't take you down there like that,"
Breck laughed, "we've got to get you some
clothes
In a matter of minutes, I was ready for Hallo
ween, decked out in coveralls, hard hat, work
gloves, dust mask and flashlight. I was a
ridiculous and the steamfitters knew it
Breck asked one of his steamfitters for a ciga
rette before we got in the truck. A last cigarette,
I thought. Great.
Marion King (another steamfitter), Breck and
I took off in a truck for the Central Energy
Facility, more commonly known as the steam
plant, where we would begin my tour. Marion
wasn't just there for a ride to the plant and back,
is I later found our He was also there to make

sure that we came out after we went in.
Breck knew I was from The Daily and under
stood that 1 was doing a feature, but couldn't
understand why people thought it might be fun
to explore in the tunnels, although he said he
once found someone who was living out of a
sleeping bag inside a manhole near the Knoll.
"If you go down there alone and something
happens, nobody's gonna know you're down
there until you start stinkin', Breck said.
The steam plant, an unmarked building on
most maps of the campus, is responsible for the
heating and cooling of the University and the
Medical Center, as well as for backup power in
case of a power failure If there s a blackout at
Stanford, backup generators kick on to power
the Med Center and to keep the heating and air
conditioning going, but they won't keep your
desk lamp or your Macintosh running
The steam plant houses four boilers (of
which two were needed to supply the demand
while I was there) that produce at a

maximum of 80,000 tons per hour at 125
pounds per square inch. The steam goes
through the 10 miles of steam tunnel under
the University at 350 degress ;md returns at 250
degrees.
Also housed at the steam plant is the Univer
sity's c<x)ling system that has been in opera
tion since the 19" 7 4 energy crisis The chilled
water system utilizes several miles of pipeline
buried directly in the ground to cool 90 per
cent of the buildings on campus. Before the
facility was built, each building had its own
cooling system — a maintenance and efficiency
nightmare.
The chilled water system is a closed network
that re-uses the water in three towers Seven
"chillers" that cool the water with lithium
bromide send the water out at 42 degree to
the various buildings, where blowers blow
through coils filled with the chilled water. The
