Yes, we have utility record drawings, I
i iv h\ u ilrh Riirh:inan. the director of

Operations and Maintenance. They detail .ill the
tunnels, cables and pipes under the University,
but 1 couldn't see them and I certainly couldn't
publish them.
"Could you tell me where they are?' I asked
Buchanan.
"A few random places, was the noncommit
tal response.
Buchanan went on to tell me that people oc
casionally venture into the tunnels But he said
you couldn't stumble onto them by accident
and that they aren't very pleasant places to ex
plore
I've thought about giving tours so people
would see how unpleasant it really is, Bu
chanan said.
Needless to say. I immediately volunteered.
Buchanan put me in touch with Lois Breckin
ridge ( Breck. to those that know him well),
the supervisor of the University's steanifitters
Sure. I II show vou a few nlaces " he s:«kl

with :i laugh that was just a little too knowing
about what I was in for.
I showed up at the steamfitters shed on
Bonair Siding where I felt slightly un
depressed with my Stanford uniform of shorts,
no socks and sneakers.
"VC'e can't take you down there like that,"
Breck laughed, "we've got to get you some
clothes
In a matter of minutes, I was ready for Hallo
ween, decked out in coveralls, hard hat, work
gloves, dust mask and flashlight. I was a
ridiculous and the steamfitters knew it
Breck asked one of his steamfitters for a ciga
rette before we got in the truck. A last cigarette,
I thought. Great.
Marion King (another steamfitter), Breck and
I took off in a truck for the Central Energy
Facility, more commonly known as the steam
plant, where we would begin my tour. Marion
wasn't just there for a ride to the plant and back,
is I later found our He was also there to make

sure that we came out after we went in.
Breck knew I was from The Daily and under
stood that 1 was doing a feature, but couldn't
understand why people thought it might be fun
to explore in the tunnels, although he said he
once found someone who was living out of a
sleeping bag inside a manhole near the Knoll.
"If you go down there alone and something
happens, nobody's gonna know you're down
there until you start stinkin', Breck said.
The steam plant, an unmarked building on
most maps of the campus, is responsible for the
heating and cooling of the University and the
Medical Center, as well as for backup power in
case of a power failure If there s a blackout at
Stanford, backup generators kick on to power
the Med Center and to keep the heating and air
conditioning going, but they won't keep your
desk lamp or your Macintosh running
The steam plant houses four boilers (of
which two were needed to supply the demand
while I was there) that produce at a

maximum of 80,000 tons per hour at 125
pounds per square inch. The steam goes
through the 10 miles of steam tunnel under
the University at 350 degress ;md returns at 250
degrees.
Also housed at the steam plant is the Univer
sity's c<x)ling system that has been in opera
tion since the 19" 7 4 energy crisis The chilled
water system utilizes several miles of pipeline
buried directly in the ground to cool 90 per
cent of the buildings on campus. Before the
facility was built, each building had its own
cooling system — a maintenance and efficiency
nightmare.
The chilled water system is a closed network
that re-uses the water in three towers Seven
"chillers" that cool the water with lithium
bromide send the water out at 42 degree to
the various buildings, where blowers blow
through coils filled with the chilled water. The
chilled water returns at 55 degress and
is used over and over again. The sys
tem is manned 24 hours a day and is
maintained by steamfitters who are al
ways on call.
Breck, who is 57, has been a steam
fitter at Stanford for more than 20
years. He may be exceeded in seniority
by "Steamy," a Persian cat mascot that
has stood guard over the control panel
for as long as Breck can remember.
Metal stairs going straight down led
us to the tunnel.
Earlier, Marion warned me that if 1
felt faint or dizzy in the tunnel, I
should say something and we'd pop
out a manhole and take a break. Breck
probably wouldn't pull out unless 1
said something, though, Marion said.
Hp explained that BrerW likes the heat

because it is good for his back.
Breck went down the stairs into the
tunnel first, and when he was out of
earshot, Marion whispered to me that
it wasn't really as bad as all that.
We started in a newer tunnel that
was about four-and-a-half feet in
diameter. The steam pipes run through
the center, so you have to walk along
the side and duck your head to
negotiate your way through.
I asked Breck if the steamfitters ever
get used to being in the tunnel.
"You never get used to it," Breck
said very seriously.
From our starting point, we went
past the opening for the new Center
for Integrated Studies which had some
heavily insulated computer cables
emerging through it. Then the tunnel
got smaller and older.

My search for a map of the tunnels
had taken me to the University ar
chives, where all that turned up was a
drawing dated 1889 showing a tunnel
from History Corner in the Quad to
Encina Hall. Apparently, the tunnels
connecting the older buildings on
campus date back about that far.
Breck pointed out some metal
grating we had to go through. He
welded the grating in place during the

1960s when there was a fear that
protesters might go down in the tun
nels and wreak havoc. The door of the
grating is open, but it can be locked
shut if the campus political situation
should change.
All the manhole covers that are
marked "steam," and many that aren't,
cover a long drop into the tunnel.
Breck complained that people who
like to roll manhole covers pose a dan

ger because a drop into the tunnel
could kill. Covers that are habitually
pulled off are sealed, and the police
are notified.
We continued under Sequoia Hall
and the Varian Physics Building. At this
point, there is no light in the tunnel
and hardly any sound. Steamfitters
keep each other talking in the tunnel
to make sure their partners are alive.
"How does your wife feel about you
being down here, Breck?" I asked.
"She says a little prayer for me."
Somewhere under Math Corner,
Breck and 1 stopped to see some of the
old pipes that remain, forming a loop
perpendicular to the tunnel. They
predate the better expansion joints
used today.
During our stop to look at the old
pipes, Breck spent some time em
phasizing to me how safe Operations
and Maintenance is compared to
similar departments elsewhere. Man
agement is very safety-conscious and
provides training and funds when they
are necessary.
"Safety isn't something you bargain
for," Breck said.

We spent about 10 minutes sitting in
the tunnel talking about what the life of
a steamfitter is like, while my face was
dripping and my eyeballs were sweat;
ing.
1 had to get out of that tunnel. Finally
we moved on.
An open manhole was further down
the tunnel, and there was Marion. We
were a little late at Math Corner be
cause of the time Breck had taken to
discuss safety. Marion was a little anx
ious.
"I was looking for you all up and
down the line," Marion told us. Breck
explained that we stopped to talk and
told me to go up the manhole first.
"Go up and see the sky again," Breck
said.
I emerged through a manhole in the
Quad in Math Corner. It was a great
relief to be out. Even though I'd been
underground only 45 minutes and
hadn't done any work, it was then that 1
understood what Miller Time is all
about.


Approximate route of adventurous writer through perilous steam tunnels
leads from (1) point of entry under the University's steam plant to (2) point
of exit near Math Corner in the Outer Quad.
On the ride back I was told that
everyone who makes it out gets to
keep their flashlight and gloves.
Do I recommend the trip? Well, I'm
glad to have had the experience but I
now know how dangerous it is. With
out gloves you would no doubt be
burned, and without a hard hat it is
only a matter of time before you bang
your head on something and knock
yourself out. Not to mention that it is
oppressively hot, and there are about
100 years of dust down there.
Still, 1 plan to keep the flashlight.

Marion King (another steamfitter), Breck and
I took off in a truck for the Central Energy
Facility, more commonly known as the steam
plant, where we would begin my tour. Marion
wasn't just there for a ride to the plant and back,
is I later found our He was also there to make

sure that we came out after we went in.
Breck knew I was from The Daily and under
stood that 1 was doing a feature, but couldn't
understand why people thought it might be fun
to explore in the tunnels, although he said he
once found someone who was living out of a
sleeping bag inside a manhole near the Knoll.
"If you go down there alone and something
happens, nobody's gonna know you're down
there until you start stinkin', Breck said.
The steam plant, an unmarked building on
most maps of the campus, is responsible for the
heating and cooling of the University and the
Medical Center, as well as for backup power in
case of a power failure If there s a blackout at
Stanford, backup generators kick on to power
the Med Center and to keep the heating and air
conditioning going, but they won't keep your
desk lamp or your Macintosh running
The steam plant houses four boilers (of
which two were needed to supply the demand
while I was there) that produce at a

maximum of 80,000 tons per hour at 125
pounds per square inch. The steam goes
through the 10 miles of steam tunnel under
the University at 350 degress ;md returns at 250
degrees.
Also housed at the steam plant is the Univer
sity's c<x)ling system that has been in opera
tion since the 19" 7 4 energy crisis The chilled
water system utilizes several miles of pipeline
buried directly in the ground to cool 90 per
cent of the buildings on campus. Before the
facility was built, each building had its own
cooling system — a maintenance and efficiency
nightmare.
The chilled water system is a closed network
that re-uses the water in three towers Seven
"chillers" that cool the water with lithium
bromide send the water out at 42 degree to
the various buildings, where blowers blow
through coils filled with the chilled water. The
chilled water returns at 55 degress and
is used over and over again. The sys
tem is manned 24 hours a day and is
maintained by steamfitters who are al
ways on call.
Breck, who is 57, has been a steam
fitter at Stanford for more than 20
years. He may be exceeded in seniority
by "Steamy," a Persian cat mascot that
has stood guard over the control panel
for as long as Breck can remember.
Metal stairs going straight down led
us to the tunnel.
Earlier, Marion warned me that if 1
felt faint or dizzy in the tunnel, I
should say something and we'd pop
out a manhole and take a break. Breck
probably wouldn't pull out unless 1
said something, though, Marion said.
Hp explained that BrerW likes the heat

because it is good for his back.
Breck went down the stairs into the
tunnel first, and when he was out of
earshot, Marion whispered to me that
it wasn't really as bad as all that.
We started in a newer tunnel that
was about four-and-a-half feet in
diameter. The steam pipes run through
the center, so you have to walk along
the side and duck your head to
negotiate your way through.
I asked Breck if the steamfitters ever
get used to being in the tunnel.
"You never get used to it," Breck
said very seriously.
From our starting point, we went
past the opening for the new Center
for Integrated Studies which had some
heavily insulated computer cables
emerging through it. Then the tunnel
got smaller and older.

My search for a map of the tunnels
had taken me to the University ar
chives, where all that turned up was a
drawing dated 1889 showing a tunnel
from History Corner in the Quad to
Encina Hall. Apparently, the tunnels
connecting the older buildings on
campus date back about that far.
Breck pointed out some metal
grating we had to go through. He
welded the grating in place during the

1960s when there was a fear that
protesters might go down in the tun
nels and wreak havoc. The door of the
grating is open, but it can be locked
shut if the campus political situation
should change.
All the manhole covers that are
marked "steam," and many that aren't,
cover a long drop into the tunnel.
Breck complained that people who
like to roll manhole covers pose a dan

ger because a drop into the tunnel
could kill. Covers that are habitually
pulled off are sealed, and the police
are notified.
We continued under Sequoia Hall
and the Varian Physics Building. At this
point, there is no light in the tunnel
and hardly any sound. Steamfitters
keep each other talking in the tunnel
to make sure their partners are alive.
"How does your wife feel about you
being down here, Breck?" I asked.
"She says a little prayer for me."
Somewhere under Math Corner,
Breck and 1 stopped to see some of the
old pipes that remain, forming a loop
perpendicular to the tunnel. They
predate the better expansion joints
used today.
During our stop to look at the old
pipes, Breck spent some time em
phasizing to me how safe Operations
and Maintenance is compared to
similar departments elsewhere. Man
agement is very safety-conscious and
provides training and funds when they
are necessary.
"Safety isn't something you bargain
for," Breck said.

We spent about 10 minutes sitting in
the tunnel talking about what the life of
a steamfitter is like, while my face was
dripping and my eyeballs were sweat;
ing.
1 had to get out of that tunnel. Finally
we moved on.
An open manhole was further down
the tunnel, and there was Marion. We
were a little late at Math Corner be
cause of the time Breck had taken to
discuss safety. Marion was a little anx
ious.
"I was looking for you all up and
down the line," Marion told us. Breck
explained that we stopped to talk and
told me to go up the manhole first.
"Go up and see the sky again," Breck
said.
I emerged through a manhole in the
Quad in Math Corner. It was a great
relief to be out. Even though I'd been
underground only 45 minutes and
hadn't done any work, it was then that 1
understood what Miller Time is all
about.

leads from (1) point of entry under the University's steam plant to (2) point

On the ride back I was told that
everyone who makes it out gets to
keep their flashlight and gloves.
Do I recommend the trip? Well, I'm
glad to have had the experience but I
now know how dangerous it is. With
out gloves you would no doubt be
burned, and without a hard hat it is
only a matter of time before you bang
your head on something and knock
yourself out. Not to mention that it is
oppressively hot, and there are about
100 years of dust down there.
Still, 1 plan to keep the flashlight.

Buchanan.

fitter at Stanford for more than 20
years. He may be exceeded in seniority
by "Steamy," a Persian cat mascot that
has stood guard over the control panel
for as long as Breck can remember.
Metal stairs going straight down led
us to the tunnel.
Earlier, Marion warned me that if 1
felt faint or dizzy in the tunnel, I
should say something and we'd pop
out a manhole and take a break. Breck
probably wouldn't pull out unless 1
said something, though, Marion said.
Hp explained that BrerW likes the heat

because it is good for his back.
Breck went down the stairs into the
tunnel first, and when he was out of
earshot, Marion whispered to me that
it wasn't really as bad as all that.
We started in a newer tunnel that
was about four-and-a-half feet in
diameter. The steam pipes run through
the center, so you have to walk along
the side and duck your head to
negotiate your way through.
I asked Breck if the steamfitters ever
get used to being in the tunnel.
"You never get used to it," Breck
said very seriously.
From our starting point, we went
past the opening for the new Center
for Integrated Studies which had some
heavily insulated computer cables
emerging through it. Then the tunnel
got smaller and older.

My search for a map of the tunnels
had taken me to the University ar
chives, where all that turned up was a
drawing dated 1889 showing a tunnel
from History Corner in the Quad to
Encina Hall. Apparently, the tunnels
connecting the older buildings on
campus date back about that far.
Breck pointed out some metal
grating we had to go through. He
welded the grating in place during the

1960s when there was a fear that
protesters might go down in the tun
nels and wreak havoc. The door of the
grating is open, but it can be locked
shut if the campus political situation
should change.
All the manhole covers that are
marked "steam," and many that aren't,
cover a long drop into the tunnel.
Breck complained that people who
like to roll manhole covers pose a dan

ger because a drop into the tunnel
could kill. Covers that are habitually
pulled off are sealed, and the police
are notified.
We continued under Sequoia Hall
and the Varian Physics Building. At this
point, there is no light in the tunnel
and hardly any sound. Steamfitters
keep each other talking in the tunnel
to make sure their partners are alive.
"How does your wife feel about you
being down here, Breck?" I asked.
"She says a little prayer for me."
Somewhere under Math Corner,
Breck and 1 stopped to see some of the
old pipes that remain, forming a loop
perpendicular to the tunnel. They
predate the better expansion joints
used today.
During our stop to look at the old
pipes, Breck spent some time em
phasizing to me how safe Operations
and Maintenance is compared to
similar departments elsewhere. Man
agement is very safety-conscious and
provides training and funds when they
are necessary.
"Safety isn't something you bargain
for," Breck said.

We spent about 10 minutes sitting in
the tunnel talking about what the life of
a steamfitter is like, while my face was
dripping and my eyeballs were sweat;
ing.
1 had to get out of that tunnel. Finally
we moved on.
An open manhole was further down
the tunnel, and there was Marion. We
were a little late at Math Corner be
cause of the time Breck had taken to
discuss safety. Marion was a little anx
ious.
"I was looking for you all up and
down the line," Marion told us. Breck
explained that we stopped to talk and
told me to go up the manhole first.
"Go up and see the sky again," Breck
said.
I emerged through a manhole in the
Quad in Math Corner. It was a great
relief to be out. Even though I'd been
underground only 45 minutes and
hadn't done any work, it was then that 1
understood what Miller Time is all
about.

leads from (1) point of entry under the University's steam plant to (2) point
of exit near Math Corner in the Outer Quad.
On the ride back I was told that
everyone who makes it out gets to
keep their flashlight and gloves.
Do I recommend the trip? Well, I'm
glad to have had the experience but I
now know how dangerous it is. With
out gloves you would no doubt be
burned, and without a hard hat it is
only a matter of time before you bang
your head on something and knock
yourself out. Not to mention that it is
oppressively hot, and there are about
100 years of dust down there.
Still, 1 plan to keep the flashlight.
You probably read about them in The Daily
orientation issue and have been wondering
ibout them since. Your curiosity may even have
ncreased each time you saw a manhole in the
And when you ordered a Domino s Pizza
•our wonderment may have been too much to
Teat as you thought, "If it takes them at least a
lalf hour to find my dorm, it might take them a
ear to find me if I were under it.
I refer, of course, to the University's steam
unnels
Our orientation issue lists them with other
weird fun" to be had here on the Farm In the
ourse of my first week as Hug Me columnist,
in inquirer wanted to know if any maps of
hem existed and, il so, would I please print
hem.
Yes, we have utility record drawings, I
i iv h\ u ilrh Riirh:inan. the director of

Operations and Maintenance. They detail .ill the
tunnels, cables and pipes under the University,
but 1 couldn't see them and I certainly couldn't
publish them.
"Could you tell me where they are?' I asked
Buchanan.
"A few random places, was the noncommit
tal response.
Buchanan went on to tell me that people oc
casionally venture into the tunnels But he said
you couldn't stumble onto them by accident
and that they aren't very pleasant places to ex
plore
I've thought about giving tours so people
would see how unpleasant it really is, Bu
chanan said.
Needless to say. I immediately volunteered.
Buchanan put me in touch with Lois Breckin
ridge ( Breck. to those that know him well),
the supervisor of the University's steanifitters
Sure. I II show vou a few nlaces " he s:«kl

with :i laugh that was just a little too knowing
about what I was in for.
I showed up at the steamfitters shed on
Bonair Siding where I felt slightly un
depressed with my Stanford uniform of shorts,
no socks and sneakers.
"VC'e can't take you down there like that,"
Breck laughed, "we've got to get you some
clothes
In a matter of minutes, I was ready for Hallo
ween, decked out in coveralls, hard hat, work
gloves, dust mask and flashlight. I was a
ridiculous and the steamfitters knew it
Breck asked one of his steamfitters for a ciga
rette before we got in the truck. A last cigarette,
I thought. Great.
Marion King (another steamfitter), Breck and
I took off in a truck for the Central Energy
Facility, more commonly known as the steam
plant, where we would begin my tour. Marion
wasn't just there for a ride to the plant and back,
is I later found our He was also there to make

sure that we came out after we went in.
Breck knew I was from The Daily and under
stood that 1 was doing a feature, but couldn't
understand why people thought it might be fun
to explore in the tunnels, although he said he
once found someone who was living out of a
sleeping bag inside a manhole near the Knoll.
"If you go down there alone and something
happens, nobody's gonna know you're down
there until you start stinkin', Breck said.
The steam plant, an unmarked building on
most maps of the campus, is responsible for the
heating and cooling of the University and the
Medical Center, as well as for backup power in
case of a power failure If there s a blackout at
Stanford, backup generators kick on to power
the Med Center and to keep the heating and air
conditioning going, but they won't keep your
desk lamp or your Macintosh running
The steam plant houses four boilers (of
which two were needed to supply the demand
while I was there) that produce at a

maximum of 80,000 tons per hour at 125
pounds per square inch. The steam goes
through the 10 miles of steam tunnel under
the University at 350 degress ;md returns at 250
degrees.
Also housed at the steam plant is the Univer
sity's c<x)ling system that has been in opera
tion since the 19" 7 4 energy crisis The chilled
water system utilizes several miles of pipeline
buried directly in the ground to cool 90 per
cent of the buildings on campus. Before the
facility was built, each building had its own
cooling system — a maintenance and efficiency
nightmare.
The chilled water system is a closed network
that re-uses the water in three towers Seven
"chillers" that cool the water with lithium
bromide send the water out at 42 degree to
the various buildings, where blowers blow
through coils filled with the chilled water. The
chilled water returns at 55 degress and
is used over and over again. The sys
tem is manned 24 hours a day and is
maintained by steamfitters who are al
ways on call.
