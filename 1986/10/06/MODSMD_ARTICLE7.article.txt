Israeli planes attack Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Israeli warplanes attacked bases of Syrian-backed
leftist militias in north Lebanon s Altkar province this morning, the Beirut
based Voice of Lebanon radio station reported.
There was no immediate official or independent confirmation of the
report, which said eight Israeli jets bombed the villages of Kosha, Berkayel
and Dahr Nsar in Syrian-controlled Akkar at 8:05 a.m. Israeli military offi
cials had no immediate comment.
An earlier report by the Voice of Lebanon, which is run by President
Amin Gemayel's Christian Phalange Party, said the raid's targets were Pales
tinian guerrilla bases in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, also controlled by the
Syrian army.
Syria, with 25,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, is considered the
country's main power broker.
The station's later report quoted unidentified police sources as saying
training bases for the Social Nationalist and Baath parties, both of which are
supported by Syria, were bombed and rocketed by the raiding jets.
There was no immediate report of casualties.
The radio said Israel was convinced that several guerrilla attacks into its
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon were carried out by
fighters trained at the Akkar bases.
Fighter-bombers, believed to be Israeli, streaked over Beirut at about the
time the raid was reported. •
But the Lebanese army command said it could not tell whether the harm
less runs over the capital confirmed the report of the Israeli raid.
Supreme Court begins 1986 term
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court begins its 1986 term today with a
conservative new leader and a conservative new member but with its
centrist justices still holding the key to the outcome of a host of controver
sial cases.
The highest profile cases that the court has agreed to consider raise the
questions of whether the death penalty is racially discriminatory, whether
federal anti-bias law protects victims of AIDS and whether states can require
the teaching of creationism in public schools.
The first term of the court under Chief Justice William Rehnquist also
finds the Reagan Administration staking out positions that seem less stri
dent in tone and less controversial in substance than those it embraced last
year.
Despite the hoopla over the confirmations of Rehnquist and Justice An
tonin Scalia, veteran court watchers say the moderate justices at the center
will continue to be decisive, as they have for years.
The biggest changes likely to be visible this term as a result of the ap
pointments are the new arrangements for seating on the bench and the
shift in offices that already has occurred.
The court now includes justices appointed by six presidents over a 30-
year span, beginning with the appointment of Justice William Brennan by
President Dwight Eisenhower. Such a mix of justices has traditionally made
the court slow to change. The court also has the same political lineup it has
had for nearly 20 years, delicately balanced between its liberal and conser
vative wings.
Scalia is expected to provide substantially more intellectual firepower
for the conservative position, but many observers agree that President
Reagan will need to replace one or more of the court's moderates or
liberals to convert the court to a conservative bastion.
Violence grows in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Although the South African govern
ment says its emergency measures are bringing under control the political
violence that has ravaged this country since September 1984, independent
monitoring groups report that in many cases the decrease in organized
resistance has been accompanied by wildcat violence by bands of angry,
leaderless black youths.
Nearly four months after launching the biggest crackdown on black dis
sent in South Africa's history, the government of President Pieter Botha says
it is ;« last getting on top of the persistent violence.
The official Bureau for Information, the only authorized source of news
about what is known here as unrest since stringent press restrictions were
introduced June 12, said the number of incidents fell in August to their
lowest level this year and is still declining.
But attacks on black policemen, township councilors and others accused
of being collaborators with the apartheid system of segregation and white
minority rule continue.
The last 10 days have seen the death of a black policeman, a bombing in
a Johannesburg hotel, a hand-grenade explosion in a multi-racial nightclub
and two bomb attacks on the homes of white officials working for township
administrations, raising fears that the violence may be spreading into white
areas.
The crackdown is on an unprecedented scale, even for a country with a
long record of suppressing political dissent. The support committee esti
mated that 16,000 political and community leaders have been detained
since the state of emergency was declared, which is double the number
detained during the 1960 emergency, when the government outlawed the
main black nationalist parties, the African National Congress and Pan-
Africanist Congress.
Orlov and wife land in New York
NEW YORK — Yuri Orlov, jailed and exiled to Siberia for nearly a de
cade because of his human rights activities, arrived here with his wife yes
terday to begin a new life in the United States.
The Orlovs' plane, Aeroflot flight 315, landed at John F. Kennedy Interna
tional Airport at 2:30 p m. EDT.
The plane had made a one-hour refueling stop in Gander, New
foundland, at about 10:3" 'm. KDT, but no one got off.
Orlov boarded the pla Moscow at 8 40 a.m. (10:40 p.m. PDT;, ac
cording to Michael Matera, a < diplomat who said he saw the dissident
enter the plane in Moscow by aa. stairway.
Matera said Orlov was hatless but wore a warm winter coat. The 62-year
old dissident was brought to Moscow from the Siberian town of Kobyia on
Saturday and was not seen by reporters at any point.
Orlov s wife. Irina, boarded the plane later and was not allowed to see or
speak with her husband beforehand.
In Gander, airport officials refused to confirm the Orlovs were aboard
the Aeroflot jet that stopped there, but the plane's (light number was the
same on which the couple left Moscow and no regular Aeroflot flight was
scheduled to pass through Gander yesterday.
Strong yen fails to curb debt
1 OKI O — About a year ago, Japan, Britain, France and West Germany
agreed to help the United States sell more of its gixxls abroad.
They agreed to raise the value of their currencies in relation to the dollar
— in theory lowering the cost of exported American products The Ameri
can gcxxls, according to the plan, would become more competitive, more
would be sold, and the huge U.S. trade deficit would be reduced.
But it has not worked in Japan. Since the agreement was struck, the ven
has risen about 60 percent against the dollar, but the U.S. trade deficit has
continued to grow. Last year's deficit with Japan was about f5O billion, a
third of the global I S deficit of $150 billion, and this year it is expected to
rise to roughly 160 billion.
Japan's trade surplus continues to rise despite an "action program' an
nounced by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone-s government that calls,
among other things, for reducing tariffs on many imported products, and
despite Nakasone s appeal to his people to "buy foreign
The problem is that the yen prices of U S goods here — high by U.S.
standards — have not declined. There are exceptions, but in general the
yen prices have remained the same: some have even gone up.

Violence grows in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Although the South African govern
ment says its emergency measures are bringing under control the political
violence that has ravaged this country since September 1984, independent
monitoring groups report that in many cases the decrease in organized
resistance has been accompanied by wildcat violence by bands of angry,
leaderless black youths.
Nearly four months after launching the biggest crackdown on black dis
sent in South Africa's history, the government of President Pieter Botha says
it is ;« last getting on top of the persistent violence.
The official Bureau for Information, the only authorized source of news
about what is known here as unrest since stringent press restrictions were
introduced June 12, said the number of incidents fell in August to their
lowest level this year and is still declining.
But attacks on black policemen, township councilors and others accused
of being collaborators with the apartheid system of segregation and white
minority rule continue.
The last 10 days have seen the death of a black policeman, a bombing in
a Johannesburg hotel, a hand-grenade explosion in a multi-racial nightclub
and two bomb attacks on the homes of white officials working for township
administrations, raising fears that the violence may be spreading into white
areas.
The crackdown is on an unprecedented scale, even for a country with a
long record of suppressing political dissent. The support committee esti
mated that 16,000 political and community leaders have been detained
since the state of emergency was declared, which is double the number
detained during the 1960 emergency, when the government outlawed the
main black nationalist parties, the African National Congress and Pan-
Africanist Congress.

Strong yen fails to curb debt
1 OKI O — About a year ago, Japan, Britain, France and West Germany
agreed to help the United States sell more of its gixxls abroad.
They agreed to raise the value of their currencies in relation to the dollar
— in theory lowering the cost of exported American products The Ameri
can gcxxls, according to the plan, would become more competitive, more
would be sold, and the huge U.S. trade deficit would be reduced.
But it has not worked in Japan. Since the agreement was struck, the ven
has risen about 60 percent against the dollar, but the U.S. trade deficit has
continued to grow. Last year's deficit with Japan was about f5O billion, a
third of the global I S deficit of $150 billion, and this year it is expected to
rise to roughly 160 billion.
Japan's trade surplus continues to rise despite an "action program' an

among other things, for reducing tariffs on many imported products, and
despite Nakasone s appeal to his people to "buy foreign

Israeli planes attack Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Israeli warplanes attacked bases of Syrian-backed
leftist militias in north Lebanon s Altkar province this morning, the Beirut
based Voice of Lebanon radio station reported.
There was no immediate official or independent confirmation of the
report, which said eight Israeli jets bombed the villages of Kosha, Berkayel
and Dahr Nsar in Syrian-controlled Akkar at 8:05 a.m. Israeli military offi
cials had no immediate comment.
An earlier report by the Voice of Lebanon, which is run by President
Amin Gemayel's Christian Phalange Party, said the raid's targets were Pales
tinian guerrilla bases in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, also controlled by the
Syrian army.
Syria, with 25,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, is considered the
country's main power broker.
The station's later report quoted unidentified police sources as saying
training bases for the Social Nationalist and Baath parties, both of which are
supported by Syria, were bombed and rocketed by the raiding jets.
There was no immediate report of casualties.
The radio said Israel was convinced that several guerrilla attacks into its
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon were carried out by
fighters trained at the Akkar bases.
Fighter-bombers, believed to be Israeli, streaked over Beirut at about the
time the raid was reported. •
But the Lebanese army command said it could not tell whether the harm
less runs over the capital confirmed the report of the Israeli raid.
Supreme Court begins 1986 term
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court begins its 1986 term today with a
conservative new leader and a conservative new member but with its
centrist justices still holding the key to the outcome of a host of controver
sial cases.
The highest profile cases that the court has agreed to consider raise the
questions of whether the death penalty is racially discriminatory, whether
federal anti-bias law protects victims of AIDS and whether states can require
the teaching of creationism in public schools.
The first term of the court under Chief Justice William Rehnquist also
finds the Reagan Administration staking out positions that seem less stri
dent in tone and less controversial in substance than those it embraced last
year.
Despite the hoopla over the confirmations of Rehnquist and Justice An
tonin Scalia, veteran court watchers say the moderate justices at the center
will continue to be decisive, as they have for years.
The biggest changes likely to be visible this term as a result of the ap
pointments are the new arrangements for seating on the bench and the
shift in offices that already has occurred.
The court now includes justices appointed by six presidents over a 30-
year span, beginning with the appointment of Justice William Brennan by
President Dwight Eisenhower. Such a mix of justices has traditionally made
the court slow to change. The court also has the same political lineup it has
had for nearly 20 years, delicately balanced between its liberal and conser
vative wings.
Scalia is expected to provide substantially more intellectual firepower
for the conservative position, but many observers agree that President
Reagan will need to replace one or more of the court's moderates or
liberals to convert the court to a conservative bastion.
