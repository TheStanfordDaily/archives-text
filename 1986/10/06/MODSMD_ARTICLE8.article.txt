# Soviet sub fire extinguished
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The fire that crippled a Soviet
nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed submarine
about 1,200 miles off Cape Hatteras, N.C.. appears to
have been [Sut out, and the vessel is being towed by a
Soviet auxiliary repair ship toward the north
northeast, apparently heading home, a Pentagon
spokesman said yesterday.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told
reporters yesterday that photographs of the sub show
it had sustained a powerful explosion. "The force of
the explosion was very, very great," Weinberger said.
The pictures show "a lot of damage."
Weinberger said the photos show hatches blown
away, the submarine's skin peeled back and a hole in
the vessel's side. At least three crew members were
killed in the incident.
Earlier Sunday the fire had been brought under
control and the vessel began moving slowly under its
own power for about 20 minutes. For some reason, it
stopped and remained dead in the water for several
hours. Around 12:45 p.m. it began moving again at
normal speed for a surfaced sub, this time for several
hours.
Once again, however, there were apparent prob
lems. Later in the afternoon the Soviet auxiliary ship
Krasnogvardeysk, which was in the Caribbean when
the accident occurred, passed a line to the sub and
began towing it.
A Defense Department official told The Washing
ton Post that the hole in the sub's side appeared not

to be the result of an explosion but of crew members
cutting away a section of the vessel's 426-foot-long
hull, a step apparently necessary' to bring the situa
tion under control.
The 9,300-ton Yankee-class submarine, one of the
Soviet Union's older model atomic subs, sustained
the accident on Friday morning and surfaced with
smoke pouring from one of 16 missile tubes at the
top of the hull. It was soon joined by three Soviet
merchant ships.
At least 50 of the sub's 120-member crew were
evacuated to the merchant ships. An American
submarine-hunting plane, a P3C Orion, which first
spotted the sub early Saturday, is making repeated
passes to observe from overhead.
Although it is still not known what caused the ex
plosion or where the fire was burning, the Pentagon

official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it
was not believed to have involved either of the ves
sel's two nuclear reactors. The fact that smoke was
coming from a missile tube could mean either that
there was a fire in the missile or that smoke from a
fire elsewhere was simply being vented through die
tube.
Fires in submarines have been known to start in
ordinary ways in paper, upholstery or acoustical tiles.
All nuclear-powered submarines carry auxiliary die
sel engines and large quantities of diesel fuel as well
as oil to lubricate the turbines.
"It doesn't matter how it starts," the official said.
"You talk fire on a sub and you're talking trouble. Big
trouble. That immediately eats up your oxygen and
you run into difficulties very quickly. You've got to
surface."
If the fire involved a missile, it could have been
something as simple as an electrical fire in the
rocket's electronics or as threatening as the burning
of the rocket's fuel. Soviet submarine-launched
missiles are liquid-fueled.
Pentagon officials would not speculate as to
whether a hole cut into the sub's side might have
served to dump a burning missile.
Whatever happened aboard the submarine,
sources agreed that the likelihood of a bomb explod
ing was essentially nil and that the threat of a signifi
cant radiation release was low but not impossible.
