# SDI could obstruct summit talks
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — When President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev try to fashion the outlines of a
new arms agreement at their summit
this weekend, they will probably run
into a familiar obstacle: the U.S. missile
defense research program commonly
known as "Star Wars."
Three-and-a-half years after its birth,
the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)
program remains the principal barrier
to major reductions of strategic weap
ons.
Senior U.S. officials said this week
that they want to avoid a direct con
frontation over Star Wars at the Reyk
javik meeting, preferring to concen
trate on topics on which the super
powers are closer to agreement, such
as medium-range missiles in Europe
and Asia.
But many arms control specialists
predict that the dispute over the pro
gram will nonetheless affect the shape
of the discussion between the two
leaders. The Soviets seek to block de

velopment of the most advanced SDI
technologies through a ban on under
ground nuclear tests, and to offer
flexibility on strategic arms in ex
change for U.S. concessions on the
program that they would most like to
kill.
In remarks that have attracted little
notice here, Soviet officials have
repeatedly drawn a connection be
tween nuclear testing and the Star
Wars program.
The Soviets have identified a nuclear
test moratorium as one of the principal
items on their agenda for the Reykjavik
meeting, and last week Boris Pyadys
hev, a spokesman for the Soviet
foreign ministry, emphasized the im
portance of the Star Wars issue by
asserting that the "main" (law in the
U.S. arms control position was an
"unwillingness to move toward pre
venting the breakthrough of nuclear
weapons into space."
The Reagan administration, in con
trast, has said that continued nuclear

testing is necessary for deterrence and
that Star Wars research cannot be sig
nificantly constrained. Pentagon offi
cials have also said that missile defense
weapons powered by nuclear bombs
— including lasers, particle beams, mi
crowave beams and pellet guas — are
scientifically promising, "very impor
tant options" for a Star Wars system.
Since the last Reagan-Gorbachev
summit, both sides have narrowed
their differences somewhat by agree
ing to coasider a temporary ban on
comprehensive missile defense
deployments. But they remain far apart
not onJy on the duration of the ban but
also on the type of scientific research
that each can pursue in the meantime.
In a recent appearance before the
United Nations, for example, President
Reagan said that he is willing to guar
antee that the United States will not
deploy "an advanced strategic defen
sive system" for at least seven years,
and that during this period it will con
duct research, development and test

ing, "which is permitted" by the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
The Soviets have demanded,
however, that each side promise to ad
here to the entire treaty for "up to 15
years," and to conduct no realistic tests
of either exotic or prosaic missile
defense technologies during this per
iod. Two weeks ago at the negotiations
in Geneva, chief Soviet negotiator Vik
tor Karpov described this demand as
an "adamant precondition" for agree
ment on strategic arms reductions.
Technical experts at the Pentagon
and elsewhere said last week that the
Soviet proposal would probably force
postponement or modification of Star
Wars tests now planned for the early
19905. The Soviets have complained
that at least four tests listed in the Pent
agon's annual report to Congress on
the program "appear to go beyond
what is permissible under a clear
reading of the treaty provisions," ac
cording to several officials.
