# Reagan downplays summit hopes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON —President Reagan
sought yesterday to dispel what he
termed "inaccurate speculation and
false hopes" that his summit with So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will lead
to new superpower agreements.
Reagan also said he would confront
Gorbachev in Iceland this weekend on
the Soviet Union's continued military
operations in Afghanistan and
"unceasing" human rights violations.
Meanwhile, House Democrats,
saying they don't want to hamper
Reagan's arms bargaining power at the
summit this weekend, said they were
willing to compromise on arms con
trol restrictions added to a Pentagon
budget bill.
"I believe we will be able to find a
way to compromise," said House
Majority leader Jim Wright (D-Texas).
"We do not want to make his task more
difficult, we want to make it easier."
He said Democrats are talking with
Senate Republicans in an effort to
"postpone any confrontation" over five
major restrictions added by the

Democratic-nan House to a stop-gap
budget bill.
Reagan, speaking to a business
group meeting at the White House,
said in the strongest terms since the
Iceland summit was announced last
week that he viewed it as merely a

preparatory session for the full-scale
meeting he and Gorbachev envisioned
after they first met in Geneva last No
vember.
Officials in both Moscow and Wash
ington have said both sides appear to
be narrowing differences on ways to

reduce numbers of medium and long
range missiles, but Reagan said the
purpose of the session in Reykjavik is
"planning and preparations, not treaty
signing and publicity.
"I hope that in explaining all this I
have done something to dispel some
of the inaccurate speculation and false
hopes raised about the Iceland talks,"
he said. "I expect these talks to be use
ful and successful, but only as prepara
tion for future summit conferences."
Reagan also said the Soviet decisions
to arrest and hold U.S. News & World
Report correspondent Nicholas
Daniloff on spy charges "underscores
the differences between our two sys
tems.
"It was an extremely grave step, but
one that could hardly surprise us. After
all, human rights violations in the So
viet bloc remain unceasing because
they are institutionalized and sanc
tioned by the state ideology."
At the same time, Reagan brushed
aside as "titillating," suggestions by
conservative critics that by going to the

summit, he is "soft on communism."
The White House reinforced
Reagan's view that the summit was a
working session, by announcing that
Nancy Reagan would remain behind in
Washington, despite plans by Gorba
chev's wife to go to Iceland.
"We were surprised that Mrs. Gorba
chev is coming," Speakes said. "It was
our understanding that this meeting
was to be brief, a limited number of
people traveling. It was to be a straight
forward business meeting with very
little, if any, social activity connected
with it."
Minutes later, as they spoke to an
anti-drug abuse group in the White
House Rose Garden, Reagan and his
wife were asked whether the American
first lady would now be included in the
U.S. entourage at the summit.
"No," they declared in unison.
Mrs. Reagan shrugged and smiled
when asked why she wouldn't go to
Reykjavik, even though Mrs. Gorba
chev planned to be there.
