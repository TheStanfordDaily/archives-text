## Teaching vs. Research 
### 
Do Stanford professors place too little
importance on teaching?
Does the University encourage profes
sors to de-emphasize that aspect of their
jobs?
The questioas are neither new here nor
unique to Stanford, but are worth examin
ing.
At issue are what many see as conflicting
goals — teaching and research. Professors
must strike a balance between the two, al
ways pursuing their own scholarly en
deavors, but not at the expense of their
work with students.
Stanford's critics often say the University
focuses too much on bolstering its status as
a world-class research institution. Some say
the pressure to publish ground-breaking
studies — pressure that the University can
exert through, among other things, its
criteria for salary hikes and tenure —
becomes so great that professors begin to
treat teaching as a secondary function.
What this means is that Stanford profes
sors may spend less time with students,
and, possibly, less time preparing for
lectures, than professors at, say, a small
liberal arts college. Certainly, many profes
sors here do spend little time with students

and relegate much teaching to assistants.
But perhaps at Stanford teaching should
come second. After all, the best teachers
seek constantly to advance knowledge in
their area of study and to challenge them
selves with new ideas rather than simply
teach from stale notes year after year. In ad
dition, professors here encourage students
to assist them with their research, which is
undeniably a great learning experience.
Last spring, the research-teaching issue
came to the fore after Political Science Frof.
John Manley, the noted thorn in the side of
University President Donald Kennedy,
raised the question of whether Stanford is
in fact emphasizing research at the expense
of teaching.
"Stanford's administration is saying to
professors, 'We want to be No. 1 — give us
more publications, more prizes,'" Manley
said in a letter to Kennedy. "The adminis
tration is getting increasingly oppressive.
Teach ng is increasingly subordinated to
(research).
"This raises questions about what kind of
university Stanford is, and whether we want
to be that kind of university."
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee addressed the issue in the summer
edition of "In Writing."

"Does the institution really value teach
ing in its structure of incentives and
rewards?" she wrote. "That is a question we
need to keep asking.'
She continued: "Recently, some of our
dedicated teachers have not been advanced
to tenure in decisions that weighed their
research deficiencies more heavily than
their teaching contributions. These cases
have elicited, and deserved, some critical
questioning.
"But Stanford does prize teaching.
Teaching ability and commitment are
scrutinized in every appointment deci
sion."
Lougee noted a "strong emphasis on un
dergraduate teaching that is surviving un
der the intensifying emphasis on research,"
offering as examples three world
renowned scholars who teach introductory
undergraduate courses at Stanford.
Finally, Lougee wrote, "preserving ap
propriately strong emphasis on teaching re
quires constant vigilance and strong admin
istrative support."
Students here would do well to consider
the questions raised by Manley and to
maintain the vigilance that Lougee urges.
The quality of education at Stanford is at
stake.
