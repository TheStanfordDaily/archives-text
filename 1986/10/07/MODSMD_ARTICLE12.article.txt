## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Public service pays 
### 
We've heard it all before; Stanford students are
Yuppies extraordinaire, existing merely to pack their
resumes and earn as much money as possible while still
having fun. Though we might not admit to being whole
heartedly preprofessional, we certainly know people
here who appear to devote almost all their energy to the
goals of the "me generation."
Fortunately, Stanford offers, with University President
Donald Kennedy's blessing, a way to fight the Yuppie
stereotype — opportunities to give some time to public
service.
Public service opportunities abound in the Bay Area,
especially in places like East Palo Alto, where an entire
community goes without some of the most basic needs
many Stanford students have learned to take for granted.
Even though the city lies right outside Stanford's gates, it
is far too easy to ignore the needs of East Palo Altans and
continue on with campus life as usual.
But rather than give in to the Yuppie stereotype, Stan
ford students should listen to people like Kennedy, who
has pointed out the many public service opportunities
available for those who want to help. Within easy walking
distance of every on-campus student residence is Owen
House, where Stanford's Public Service Center assigns
interested students to one-time-only or regular volun
teer service positions.

This year, Owen House is organizing numerous public
service activities that can appeal to any student in every
department, from engineering to education. New tutor
ing programs geared toward elementary school children
in East Palo Alto, as well as the more traditional care of
the elderly, handicapped and disabled are begging for
students with the enthusiasm and energy needed to fill
these positions. Even dorms can get into the act by
"adopting" social concern agencies, giving their particu
lar agency either money or volunteer work.
Of course, giving time to public service benefits the
student as well as the person in need. Academic credit
and public service scholarships are the more tangible
rewards; a sense of accomplishment and the learning ex
perience are longer-term benefits for students who
volunteer. Working in public service can also help stu
dents explore potential careers and majors, giving them
the experience necessary to make informed decisions
about their own futures.
Now may be one of the last opportunities to give time
and energy to public service before we embark on
making careers in the larger world outside Stanford.
If we are the future leaders of the world, then now is
the time to prove that we care enough about our fellow
human beings to make a small sacrifice for needy
people. Now is the time to volunteer for public service.
