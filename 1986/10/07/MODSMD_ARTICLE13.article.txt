# Support S. Africa sanctions
## 
### 
A conservative viewpoint in The
Stanford Daily? What an unusual no
tion. More often than not you'll find
this author defending President
Reagan's foreign policy, and being
damn proud of it! Unfortunately for fel
low conservatives (1 know you're out
there somewhere), I've chosen for my
editorial topic an issue wherein the
president and I now find each other on
opposite sides of the fence. The subject
is that of imposing economic sanctions
on South Africa. While I don't particu
larly enjoy agreeing with my col
leagues on the left, the time has arrived
when all Americans should unite in
support of this important and prudent
measure.

The president is, however, correct in
one respect on this issue. While eco
nomic sanctions may convince Pretoria
to move more quickly toward abolish
ing its racist apartheid policy, they will
more likely do greater damage to black
South Africans than to whites and will
further destablize an already unstable
country. But the president must re
member that blacks are already suffer
ing greatly in South Africa, and if
Pretoria continues its authoritarian
rule, the country will become more
unstable anyway. If greater suffering
must be endured as a means by which
the ultimate end of freedom is at
tained, then so be it. It is
presumptuous of President Reagan to
be concerned for the welfare of blacks
in South Africa, should sanctions be
imposed, when the majority of these
people themselves desire such a mea
sure. They understand, as I now agree,
that sanctions are a necessary evil, cer
tainly no more evil than apartheid it
self, and that sanctions must be imple
mented as a means through which
change will be effected.
Six months ago I was still a believer
in the president's policy of
"constructive engagement." His argu
ment warranted attention; that is to say,
if the Pretoria government could be

moved toward reform on the issue of
apartheid peacefully, without sanc
tions, then everyone would be better
off. But, as of late, Pretoria simply has
not come around. We have tried being
civil, but this has proven naive and un
successful. Real reform has been mar
ginal to nonexistent. In the last half
year, the South African government has
moved away from, instead of toward, a
peaceful resolution of one of the
world's greatest injustices. With its
restriction on the press and jailing of
thousands of black protesters, Pretoria
appears more an authoritarian regime
than a Western democracy. President
Reagan seeks a peaceful solution to the
problem of apartheid, but by opposing
Congress' economic sanctions, he is
promoting, and not preventing, a
bloody revolution in South Africa.
Conservatives make the argument
that the outlawed African National
Congress (ANC) is militant and com
munist in nature, its leaders avowed
Marxists who will settle for nothing
short of a bloody revolution. No doubt
such an analysis is quite possibly true.
If ever there were a revolution in
South Africa, it would most likely be
one of the most bloody, horrifying
wars of the 20th century. Extremists on
all sides would fight, black versus black
as well as black versus white, until the
very end, and in that end, blacks led by
the ANC would probably overthrow
the white minority government. In the
process, the West could do virtually
nothing to stop the systematic killing of
millions of people, both black and
white alike. The ANC would establish a
Marxist totalitarian dictatorship' in or
der to "consolidate the revolution,"
with Cuba and the Soviet Union the
new government's principle sponsors.
The United States might try to make
amends with the newly established
government, but such a Marxist regime
would have nothing to do with a
country which for so long prolonged
its "proletarian revolution" by support
ing the white Afrikaner government.
Such a scenario may seem horrify
ing; however, it seems to me the unfor
tunate and likely future of South Africa
if Pretoria does not change its course

by abolishing apartheid soon. The inte
gration of blacks into mainstream
white South African society, including
the right to vote, can be done
gradually. But it must begin now, or
else South Africa faces a violent and
tragic end. While hard-line con
servatives may have the ability to
predict the probable outcome of a
revolution in South Africa, they lack
the political prudence necessary for
preventing such a massacre. Economic
sanctions have become the necessary
alternative to affording Pretoria the
freedom of expressing its own
domestic problem, a problem which
ultimately concerns all humankind.
The world has given South African
Prime Minister P.W. Botha ample time
to move his government in a positive
direction, but he has instead opted to
resist the inevitable — the abolishment
of apartheid and the institution of a to
tally free and integrated South Africa.
Perhaps with sanctions finally
enacted into law by Congress with
overwhelming support, having over
ridden the president's veto, the Ameri
can people can now send the message
to Pretoria that enough is enough! The
world can no longer stand for a social
policy which denies the rights of the
many to secure the luxury of a few. We
have waited patiently for reforms but
have instead witnessed an even greater
repression of fundamental human
rights. The conservative school of
thought professes to represent
freedom and the rights of the individ
ual within the democratic state — a
state, mind you, theoretically represen
tative of all the individuals in a society.
Well, this conservative is doing just that
by supporting, reluctantly, economic
sanctions against the racist government
of South Africa. May history show our
country's actions to be both timely and
prudent. May these sanctions finally
convince the leaders of South Africa
that apartheid is morally unacceptable,
and that its abolishment is not only
best for South Africa but is ultimately
best for the world and humankind.

all sides would fight, black versus black
as well as black versus white, until the
very end, and in that end, blacks led by
the ANC would probably overthrow
the white minority government. In the
process, the West could do virtually
nothing to stop the systematic killing of
millions of people, both black and
white alike. The ANC would establish a
Marxist totalitarian dictatorship' in or
der to "consolidate the revolution,"
with Cuba and the Soviet Union the
new government's principle sponsors.
The United States might try to make
amends with the newly established
government, but such a Marxist regime
would have nothing to do with a
country which for so long prolonged
its "proletarian revolution" by support
ing the white Afrikaner government.
Such a scenario may seem horrify
ing; however, it seems to me the unfor
tunate and likely future of South Africa
if Pretoria does not change its course

by abolishing apartheid soon. The inte
gration of blacks into mainstream
white South African society, including
the right to vote, can be done
gradually. But it must begin now, or
else South Africa faces a violent and
tragic end. While hard-line con
servatives may have the ability to
predict the probable outcome of a
revolution in South Africa, they lack
the political prudence necessary for
preventing such a massacre. Economic
sanctions have become the necessary
alternative to affording Pretoria the
freedom of expressing its own
domestic problem, a problem which
ultimately concerns all humankind.
The world has given South African
Prime Minister P.W. Botha ample time
to move his government in a positive
direction, but he has instead opted to
resist the inevitable — the abolishment
of apartheid and the institution of a to
tally free and integrated South Africa.
Perhaps with sanctions finally
enacted into law by Congress with
overwhelming support, having over
ridden the president's veto, the Ameri
can people can now send the message
to Pretoria that enough is enough! The
world can no longer stand for a social
policy which denies the rights of the
many to secure the luxury of a few. We
have waited patiently for reforms but
have instead witnessed an even greater
repression of fundamental human
rights. The conservative school of
thought professes to represent
freedom and the rights of the individ
ual within the democratic state — a
state, mind you, theoretically represen
tative of all the individuals in a society.
Well, this conservative is doing just that
by supporting, reluctantly, economic
sanctions against the racist government
of South Africa. May history show our
country's actions to be both timely and
prudent. May these sanctions finally
convince the leaders of South Africa
that apartheid is morally unacceptable,
and that its abolishment is not only
best for South Africa but is ultimately
best for the world and humankind.

A conservative viewpoint in The
Stanford Daily? What an unusual no
tion. More often than not you'll find
this author defending President
Reagan's foreign policy, and being
damn proud of it! Unfortunately for fel
low conservatives (1 know you're out
there somewhere), I've chosen for my
editorial topic an issue wherein the
president and I now find each other on
opposite sides of the fence. The subject
is that of imposing economic sanctions
on South Africa. While I don't particu
larly enjoy agreeing with my col
leagues on the left, the time has arrived
when all Americans should unite in
support of this important and prudent
measure.

The president is, however, correct in
one respect on this issue. While eco
nomic sanctions may convince Pretoria
to move more quickly toward abolish
ing its racist apartheid policy, they will
more likely do greater damage to black
South Africans than to whites and will
further destablize an already unstable
country. But the president must re
member that blacks are already suffer
ing greatly in South Africa, and if
Pretoria continues its authoritarian
rule, the country will become more
unstable anyway. If greater suffering
must be endured as a means by which
the ultimate end of freedom is at
tained, then so be it. It is
presumptuous of President Reagan to
be concerned for the welfare of blacks
in South Africa, should sanctions be
imposed, when the majority of these
people themselves desire such a mea
sure. They understand, as I now agree,
that sanctions are a necessary evil, cer
tainly no more evil than apartheid it
self, and that sanctions must be imple
mented as a means through which
change will be effected.
Six months ago I was still a believer
in the president's policy of
"constructive engagement." His argu
ment warranted attention; that is to say,
if the Pretoria government could be

moved toward reform on the issue of
apartheid peacefully, without sanc
tions, then everyone would be better
off. But, as of late, Pretoria simply has
not come around. We have tried being
civil, but this has proven naive and un
successful. Real reform has been mar
ginal to nonexistent. In the last half
year, the South African government has
moved away from, instead of toward, a
peaceful resolution of one of the
world's greatest injustices. With its
restriction on the press and jailing of
thousands of black protesters, Pretoria
appears more an authoritarian regime
than a Western democracy. President
Reagan seeks a peaceful solution to the
problem of apartheid, but by opposing
Congress' economic sanctions, he is
promoting, and not preventing, a
bloody revolution in South Africa.
Conservatives make the argument
that the outlawed African National
Congress (ANC) is militant and com
munist in nature, its leaders avowed
Marxists who will settle for nothing
short of a bloody revolution. No doubt
such an analysis is quite possibly true.
