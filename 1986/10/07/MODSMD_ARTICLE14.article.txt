# ASSU a behemoth of bureaucracy
## 
### 
The Yale Daily News' "Insider's Guide to Colleges''
quoted a Stanford student who described the ASSU
as a "playground for student resume-builders." The
only occasionally apocryphal "Lisa Birnbach's Col
lege Book'' listed "student government" as one of the
biggest student gripes about Stanford. Many Stan
fordites say this is no big surprise, but I was shocked
to discover that students were even aware of the
ASSU's existence.
Admittedly, this is somewhat of an exaggeration,
but consider the evidence that points to students' ig
norance of their government. Last spring, a special
election was held on a proposed funding amend-

ment. An underwhelming 3 percent of the students
voted in this election. That means you could take a
rather sizable dorm like Branner, and the entire
voting population of that hall could fit in one car to
drive over to Meyer to vote, assuming of course that
you either drop the one-tenth of a person left over,
or take something larger than a VW Rabbit.
Consider the fee assessment refunds, which essen
tially pay students a tidy sum just to vote in the spring
elections. Even with this outright bribery, less than
half the student body voted in these elections. How
about the fact that there were more graduate student
senate seats than candidates for those seats? Perhaps
the most amusing event in the elections was the dis
closure that one grad senate campaigner told The

Daily editorial board that the only reason he was run
ning was that he wanted a free ASSU flicks pass,
which all senators receive.
It's not like no one has ever tried to improve the
ASSU; each year seems to bring another failed at
tempt to make it a form of student government that
students can feel they get $15 a quarter out of. Last
year's COP twice offered the students a new form of
the ASSU constitution. The first, which replaced the
senate with two small boards of nine students each,
died by less than 100 votes, after a last-minute, well
publicized mudslinging campaign between the COP
and various campus organization leaders. The
second, a poor substitute for the "real change" the
authors promised in the first, also failed by a
hundred votes.
This year's COP also has plans for trying to bring
the ASSU closer to the students it's supposed to be
serving. Its first effort has been in the form of
various "task forces," aimed at bringing specific
benefits, such as a re-evaluation of Stanford's faculty
and staff affirmative action policy or the construction
of a student pub on campus. This is a great idea, ex
cept for one problem:
Where are they going to find people?
Sure, some of the task forces will see a gtx)d turn
out of eager students, but I find it ironic to note that
the ad for the task forces was sandwiched between an
ad to find graduate senators and an ad to find a
whopping 80 people to fill spots on University com
mittees. Are there really enough students on this
campus who are willing to spend their time working
for the ASSU?
I'll bet there aren't.
The problem isn't that hard to figure out: The stu
dent government isn't interesting to the average stu
dent. Former COP member Mike Collins, in pushing
for one of the new constitutions, said: "C'mon ...

Name one good thing the ASSU has ever done for
you." There just aren't strong links between the gov
ernment and the students it's supposed to serve. Ad
mittedly, the flicks and course notes are good
services, but aside from costing extra money (above
and beyond the fee assessment), most students don't
see a link between the lumbering behemoth of bu
reaucracy that is the senate and these few links with
the student body.
What the ASSU does, it often does well. Taking a
peek into the administrative side of their Tresidder
office reveals some people who are putting serious
hours into what they're doing. This is great for the
students but also somewhat alienating; it's like step-

Most people want little to
do with the ASSU.

ping out of sunny northern California and into some
grim Manhattan office. As an addition to the regular
Stanford workload, ASSU work, even just on a com
mittee, doesn't seem to me like it would appeal to
the average student.
I first met current COP member Carey White at a
mini-party at the ASSU office, hosted by the previous
COP. If they want to try to find students who want to
serve on their task forces and committees, maybe
Carey and company will have to do something like
this on a larger scale. As it stands, most people want
little to do with the ASSU, and it's not at all hard to
see why.
