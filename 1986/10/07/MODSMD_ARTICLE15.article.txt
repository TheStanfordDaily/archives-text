# Rethink Western Culture
## 
### 
The debate over the Western Culture requirement raises
some profound and fundamental questions about the
philosphy and politics of education. Whose history and cul
ture should we learn? How should we learn about history
and culture? Who determines the standards by which we
evaluate a given work of literature, art or culture?
Certainly, the "great works" of Western culture are im
portant and represent some of the universal themes of
literary, philosphical and social thought. Yet virtually all of
these works are written by educated, white males from the
upper classes. Does this select group hold a monopoly on
profound insights into human nature, ethics, philosophy
and politics? Is there not also much to be leanred about the
human condition from the oral traditions and writings of
Africans, Native Americans, women, African Americans,
Chicanos and Asians (to name a few)?

For instance, Rousseau's "Discourse on the Origin and
Foundation of the Inequality Among Mankind" (1754) and
"Social Contract" (1762) introduce us to the Enlightenment
ideas of equality, natural rights and democracy that so
profoundly influenced the founders of this country. But per
haps Rousseau's books should be contrasted with works that
show how only certain humans (propertied white males)
benefited from these ideas: Mary Wollstonecraft's
"Vindication of the Rights of Women" (1792) and David
Walker's "Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World"
(1829).
One of the courses in the Western Culture program is
called "Ideas of Human Liberation" and includes readings
from John Stuart Mill, William James and Jean Paul Sartre.
But where are the writings of W.E.B. Du√üois, Simone de
Beauvoir, Mao Tse-tung, Leopold Sedar Senghor, Mohandas
Gandhi or Jose Marti? Are not feminism, black conscious
ness, negritude and resistance to colonialism and
neocolonialsim relevant to the question of human libera
tion?
In demanding change in or replacement of the Western
Culture requirement, students are saying that it is not suffici
ent to learn only the ruling class version of history. By the
time we get to college, the prettified version of Western and
American history as a continual march of progress has been
fully ingrained in most of our consciousnesses. Now is the
time to challenge those ideas, to encourage students to
question and re-examine their "knowledge" of their society,
their culture and their history. Students are seeking to learn
how the grand sweep of history affected the common
people and why the grand sweep of history ignores the con
tributions of common people and of non-Western cultures.
To understand the history of American slavery and its
demise, it is not enough to read about John Brown, Harriet
Beecher Stowe, abolitionism, Abraham Lincoln and the
battles of the Civil War; we also should learn about Freder
ick Douglass, Nat Turner, the slave rebellions, Harriet Tub
man and the participation of both free blacks and black
slaves in the Civil War. To understand the process and the
impact of industrialization, it is not enough to learn about
Andrew Carnegie, Leland Stanford, John D. Rockefeller,
Henry Ford and technolgical innovation; we also should
learn about the workers' struggles for decent working con
ditions, labor leaders such as Eugene Debs, Big Bill

Haywood and Mother Jones and the organizing efforts of
groups such as the Knights of Labor, the Socialist Party and
the Industrial Workers of the World.
Nor is it enough simply to read the ideas that guided or
emerged from the "great" historical movements of Western
history. These "great works" should be viewed in the social
context from which they emerged, and the ideas and histori
cal movements of Western culture should be analyzed in
terms of their impact on the common people of the Western
world as well as on the non-Western cultures. In studying
Christianity, for example, we can ask how the same world
view which offered redemption for all humanity was also
able to serve as a justification for the oppression and exter
mination of non-Christian (and non-Western) peoples and
cultures.
Some friends have told me that they generally agree with
the students' concerns; they agree that it is important to un
derstand the social context and the impact of these books,
and they too would like to see more emphasis on the role of
women and minorities. But they are concerned about
quality; we cannot let our desire to incorporate other
perspectives lead us to sacrifice a "great work" for a
"substandard" book. Yet the challenge to the Western Cul
ture requirement also forces us to question those very
criteria by which we evaluate the quality of a book.
Are not the standards by which we evaluate culture them
selves elite-generated and, therefore, elitist? The standards
for greatness of the works of Western culture have been es
tablished by those same privileged few who wrote them; a
such, they suffer from the same biases of race, class an
gender as the works themselves. Works of popular cultur
are denigrated precisely because of the audience(s) i
which they are addressed. Non-Western art is labelt
"primitive." In an age in which African-Americans are st
struggling for equality in social life, their cultural works wi
of course, also be judged inferior by the cultural elites.
Ntozake Shange s "For Colored Girls Who Have Cons
ered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf," a masterpiece
modem American theater, draws its power largely from t
fact that it is written in the "substandard" dialectical Engli
spoken by the people whose experiences it relates. T
songs of Woody Guthrie and Bruce Springsteen pay tribui.
to the everyday struggles of the working class; one cannot,
however, discuss American music without mentioning them
both. The murals of Diego Rivera are masterful works of art,
no less so than the paintings of Goya.
The Western Culture program has begun to show some
signs of moving in the directions suggested by the current
debate. For instance, several of the tracks focus on placing
works in the context of the social and material conditions
which generated them. One of the tracks touches on slavery
and anti-semitism in Western culture, and one of the tracks
(Conflict and Change) even seeks to challenge the very con
cept of Western culture. And there are certainly a number of
courses available in which students can learn about other
cultures and other historical traditions. But as long as the
University requires a full year of Western Culture, only one
course on a non-Western culture and no ethnic studies or
feminist studies course, the University is sending a clear sig
nal to the students that it believes one culture is superior to
the others.
