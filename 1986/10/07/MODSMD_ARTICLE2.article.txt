# Assessing academic advising

"The Ms" job is to make sure that the freshmen are doing
OK, that they don't have three midterms on one day or get
too stressed out," according to junior Ed Hashima, an advis
ing associate in Toyon Hall.
"Almost half the time it's questions like, 'Should I study or
should I party?' " he added.
The Ms — always upperclassmen — answer questions,
both academic and social, that freshmen ask throughout
their first year at Stanford. These students advise groups of
four to seven people and are the bridge between the fresh
men and their advisers.
"That's a number one job," said Audrey Bernfield, direc
tor of Undergraduate Advising. "It's crucial. The AA can an
ticipate problems and alert the adviser so they can both
help the student."
Until last year, only freshmen in all-freshmen dorms were
assigned to AAs. In the four-class dorms, "the HFs (resident
fellows) felt that the seniors, juniors and sophomores are a
big enough help in advising and that adding AAs would
make an additional bureaucratic mess," said Steve
Singleton, coordinator of the Advising Associate Program.
AAs were assigned to Roble Hall, a four-class dorm, for
the 1985-86 academic year as an experiment. The AAs were
recruited from upperclassmen planning to live in Roble.
Roble RF Evan Porte us, a professor at the Stanford Busi
ness School, said the experiment proved a success.
"We had the program for two reasons. First, it was the
previous role of an RA (resident assistant) to also be an AA
here, and that was spreading the job thin. Second, we
thought if we had more people in the house with positions
of responsibility, it would be a better house," he said.
Beginning this year, almost all freshmen have AAs, and all
AAs for four-class dorms live in those dorms. There are two
exceptions: four-class dorms Serra and Cedro. Except for
one engineering AA in Cedro, the RFs in those dorms
decided not to use the AA program, according to Singleton.
Cedro RF Dan Weinberger said he initially didn't see a
need for AAs in the four-class dorm. "It seemed funny to
single out some people when everyone can help. Also, we
have just 30 freshmen, so it seemed like overkill."
Weinberger, an assistant professor of psychology, said he
has since changed his mind and plans to have AAs live in
Cedro next year. "This year (Residential Education) had the
AAs help out with orientation, and they were very helpful.
Now an AA is not just someone who comes into the dorm
and is given a label. They are more involved and have a
status."
Training for the AAs this year began on Sept. 22 and con
tinued for five days. A day-long workshop titled "Dealing
with Diversity" was designed to heighten awareness of
freshmen's different backgrounds and concerns.
Why would an upperclassman want to go through the
training and responsibility?
"One reason was nostalgic," said senior Ben Page. "I have
only one year of school left, and I kind of wish I was a fresh
man again. So it's kind of reliving my freshman year."
Page, an AA in Roble Hall, said "it's much better" to live in
the dorm with the advisees than living away. "When I was a
freshman, I barely ever saw my AA. My freshmen know
where I am if they have a problem."
Other upperclassmen have different reasons. "Because I
transferred here from USC, where we didn't have AAs or ad
visers, I had to look for solutions by myself," Hashima said.
"That was hard, especially after high school where there are
no problems."
John Derryberry, a freshman in four-class Burbank, said
he likes the idea of the AAs living in the dorm. "I think it
would be hard having to run all over campus to find my AA."
Seniors, having experienced the traditional set-up of an
AA living away from the dorm, generally approve of the new
program. "My AA was helpful — when she was available,"
said Ben Gong. "I would ask questions of other people in
my classes and the professor, but that took more effort and
time."
"I knew freshmen who never saw their AAs except for the
first time," said senior Joe Nolan.
