## Stern and encouraging turn arounds in food service 
### KATHY LACHENAUER 
Long-standing Stanford traditions include going to Big
Game, receiving a midnight kiss on The Quad and ridicul
ing Stern food whenever possible. Bill Carlstead, assistant
manager of Stern Food Service, is determined to eliminate
this last custom.
Of the eight University Food Services on campus,
Carlstead does admit that students complain the most about
the food at Stern. However, he believes that attacks on Stern
food stem from the fact that Stern houses a majority of fresh
men. First year students are accustomed to Mom's "open
refrigerator policy,'' Carlstead says, and now they "just can't
have what they want every day."
Carlstead believes that the preconceived ideas of upper
classmen also damage Stern food's reputation. According to
Carlstead, "everything seems bad" to unlucky upperclass
men who did not want to draw into Stern, so they already
hate the food.
But Carlstead, at age 25 and a recent graduate of Cal-Poly
Pomona, believes he is young enough to relate to the stu
dents' grievances and can help to solve them. "I'll do any
thing for the students," Carlstead says. During his two-and
one-half years with Stern Food Service, his sincere effort has
made a difference.
For example, Carlstead sometimes works 15 days straight
without a break. For last year's special "luau" dinner, he
went to work at midnight to pick up the food shipped from
Hawaii.
Carlstead says he also makes a point to learn students'
names quickly. His office is always open (6 a.m. to 8 p.m.) to
students and their requests.

"All they have to do is ask," he says. Zapata requested tor
tillas and beans at every dinner. Now they get it.
Whether it be a choice between red and green apples or
chunky versus smooth peanut butter, Carlstead tries to meet
the students' wants. Frantic students sometimes approach
him 30 minutes before a weekend trip or a dorm barbecue
asking for food. Carlstead does his best to "stay flexible" and
"cater to all students" — even unprepared ones.
Recent features unique to Stern Food Service have given
students "more of a choice than a standard University meal
plan," Carlstead says. Every morning there is a make-your
own breakfast set up so students can cook pancakes and
eggs the way they like. For Saturday and Sunday brunches,
students can also make their own waffles and omelettes.
Despite Carlstead's obvious efforts, he refuses to credit
himself for the improvements at Stern. He applauds his
manager, Virginia Varkonyn, and co-worker Leisa Griffith
for the changes.
Carlstead also praises James Keeton who became head of
University Food Services in September 1985. Keeton imple
mented a computer system in the eight Food Service offices
which stores recipes, costs and inventory records. Carlstead
says this system has made his job easier and more organ
ized, giving him more time to concentrate on students'
needs.
Because Stern Food Service serves over 1,300 meals a
day, Carlstead is the first to admit that students will still be
dissatisfied with an occasional cold casserole or mystery
meat. /
"Problems are bound to happen with institutional, bulk
cooking," Carlstead says. But when these problems arise,
Stern eaters can always turn to Bill Carlstead for help.
