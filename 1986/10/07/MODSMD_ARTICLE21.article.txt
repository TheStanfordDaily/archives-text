# The
						Bug checks out solar eclipses and stop signs
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
This week, the Bug tackles questions
about the sky, sound and stop signs.
Remember, these are real questions
from real readers. If they weren't,
would I be able to bend them in my
hand like I'm doing now? Of course
not.
Don't stew over those questions any
more than you have to — mail them to
me or put them in my box at The Daily.
Dear Bug Me,
The Campus Calendar has a solar
eclipse listed for Oct. 3 and a lunar
one on Oct. 17. Are both eclipses for
real? Where can Igo to see them?
— Star Struck
That ole' Campus Calendar, of which
we found stacks quite unceremoniusly
left in White Plaza, seems to be preoc
cupied with the stars. Not only does it
list two eclipses for this month, but it
sees fit to list who is hosting the
Tonight Show every week.
Unfortunately, I couldn't alert you to
last Friday's eclipse in time but, like
Johnny Carson, if you tuned in you
wouldn't have seen what you were
looking for anyway.
Friday's eclipse was a beaded annu
lar solar eclipse. The World Almanac
describes it as when the center of the
moon and the sun coincide. It was
visible throughout North America ex
cept in California. Apparently we were
disenfrachised from this eclipse be
cause it started somewhere over
Greenland. Don't write your congress
man to complain. It won't help.

We're not going to have much luck
on the upcoming one either says Lindy
of the Minolta Planetarium of De Anza
College in Cupertino. It will be a lunar
eclipse of the moon, and the earth will
come between the sun and the moon.
The earth's shadow will be on the
moon blocking its reflection. Its quite a
sight at night, but you won't be able to
see it in the daytime. Of course, that
eclipse will be during the day when we
can't see it.
If you're interested in a road trip,
Lindy suggests the Arabian Sea for the
best view.
Dear Bug Me,
When will the road work and
landscaping between Stern and Sweet
Halls be finished'!' Is this something
that's going to drag on interminably,
only to be completed in a flurry of ac
tivity fust before Commencement next
tyring, just after all the students have
left but just in time for the parents ar
riiing?
— Gad Fly
Last week's Campus Report had a
map depicting all the construction on
campus and its estimated time of com
pletion. The mall going up between
Stern and Sweet Halls is due to be
completed by Oct. 31. (The parking
structure mentioned in this column
last week is listed on the map as having
a completion date of June 2,1987).
Segar describes the pupose of the
mall as two-fold. First, it will rectify a
traffic circulation problem in that area.
Second, it will replace the grassy area
the Stern residents lost when Sweet
Hall was erected.

Besides, you can always use a good
mall.
Dear Bug Me,
How many stop signs are there on
campus now? How does this compare
with to the national average at other
universities?
Don Gardner,
electrical engineering grad student
Sometimes, when I got really behind
in my Great Works reading last year, I
would try to come up with ways that I
could save time during the course of
the day so that I'd have more time to
read. I'm not saying I ever did it mind
you, but I did think about it.
I suppose if one were to spend even
less time (or even not stopping at all)
at a stop sign, one might save some

time that could be devoted to Plato. I
don't recommend it, and I don't think
that the Stanford Police do either.
Bob Segar of the University's plan
ning office tells me that most requests
for stop signs come from the commu
nity and are approved by Capt. Wul-
Ischleger of the Stanford Police.
Neither Segar nor Wullschleger was
able to venture an estimate about the
number of signs, although there are a
finite number of intersections on
campus which one could count — ex
cept the time could be better devoted
to Plato. Really.
Stanford is unique in that it has an
enclosed campus with no roads going
through the middle. A school in an
inner-city like Cal-Berkeley or George
Washington would have a far different
number of stop signs.
