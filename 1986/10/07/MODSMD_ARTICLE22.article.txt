## Stanford earthquakes: are you prepared? 
### AMANDA BAER 
If Nostradamus could truly foresee
the future, then Stanford residents
might need to be wary of May, 1988. In
that month, the medieval sage foretold,
California is to experience a major
earthquake along its infamous San
Andreas fault.
Although Nostradamus' prediction
cannot be tested for another 19
months, it is already known that the
Stanford area experiences barely per
ceptible tremors constantly. Bridget
Hylak, a Stanford senior working with
the police department's Special
Services Unit to provide information
on earthquake safety, noted that the
Stanford area has recently felt three
minor quakes measuring four to five
on the Richter scale.
Hylak said that some scientists
theorize that a major quake will follow
frequent minor activity.
On the basis of this theory, Hylak
feels "it (a major earthquake) could be
now, it could be a few years from
n0w.... Pressure along the fault is
building and will have to be released
eventually."
Hylak explained that the destructive
force of an earthquake depends on two
circumstances: the magnitude of the
quake measured on the Richter scale
and one's distance from the quake's
epicenter, or the point where the en
ergy of the fault is located. Because of
these factors, it is possible for an
earthquake measuring four on the
Richter scale to feel like a major quake
near the epicenter but go unnoticed a
few miles away.
Stanford is located less than two
miles west of the San Andreas fault,
which extends 500 miles along the Cal
ifornia coast from San Diego to north
of San Francisco. Known as a lateral
fault, the San Andreas fault is actually
the junction between two "plates" of
land. Hylak compared San Andreas to
"a piece of glass cut by an exacto
knife." Although the two pieces fit to
gether with relative smoothness, Hylak
explained, they nevertheless push
against each other — one going south,

the other moving north — sometimes
sliding past each other as much as 10
or 12 feet at a time.
When the two plates really start
moving, the result can be a catastrophe
like the Great San Francisco
Earthquake of 1906. That fault move
ment brought an estimated $400 mil
lion in damages to San Francisco and
also wreaked havoc on the Stanford
campus. Both the old gymnasium and
the library were demolished as well as
the larger buildings on campus, in
cluding Memorial Church. The clock
which formerly stood atop the church
was shaken from its perch and jack
knifed into the chapel below.

Total damages to
the campus during
the 1906
earthquake
equalled $1 mil
lion, and one stu
dent was killed.

According to Hylak, total damages to
the campus during the 1906 quake
equalled $1 million, and one student
was killed. In general, smaller, one
story buildings such as lecture halls
and some dormitories received only
slight damage. Buildings made of rein
forced concrete, such as Roble Hall,
escaped with only falling plaster dama
ges.
Today's structures, Hylak assured,
are much safer, particularly the more
recent buildings, which have to meet
safety codes established in Stanford's
Earthquake Response Plans of 1980.
If and when a big quake comparable
to 1906 hits, students should follow a
few basic procedures. Before a quake
even comes, Hylak said, dorm resi

dents should prepare by positioning
beds where they will not be hit by fall
ing objects such as books, lamps and
framed posters. Homeowners may
wish to store an emergency supply of
food and dorm residents a battery
operated radio and a flashlight, Hylak
suggested. Beyond these precautions,
though, quake-area inhabitants can do
little until the earthquake hits.
During the quake, residents should
stay where they are, Hylak emphasized.
"Most injuries are caused by things
falling on people— People panic and
run out into hallways and streets, only
to get hit by falling objects," she noted.
If indoors, the resident should stay
there and get under a sturdy piece of
furniture such as a desk, keep his or
her head down and arms over neck. If
outside, the resident should stay out in
the open, as far from trees and power
lines as possible. If caught in a down
town area, victims should seek refuge
under a doorframe, which is the
strongest point of the structure.
"Even if the whole building comes
down, the doorway is still sound,"
Hylak said.
When the tremors stop, residents
should carefully evacuate buildings,
find a spot of known safety and stay
there. Finally, Hylak urged residents to
cooperate with police and rescue auth
orities.
For more information, students may
attend the annual Quakefest Informa
tional Fair, held in White Plaza on Oct.
15. Part of Earthquake Awareness
Week, 0ct.13-17, the fair will host
several companies and agencies con
cerned with earthquakes, including the
American Red Cross, Rescue Dogs As
sociation, Northrup Builders, San Jose
Search and Rescue and the United
States Geological Survey. Students may
also call the Earthquake Safety line at
723-0569 or contact the Blume
Earthquake and Engineering Center in
Terman Engineering Building.
So when will the Big One hit? Ac
cording to Hyiak, no one really knows.
It could be May of 1988 but don't chalk
one up for Nostradamus yet. Wait and
