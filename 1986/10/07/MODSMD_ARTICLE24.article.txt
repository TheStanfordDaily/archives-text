# Hopkins thrives by the sea

### DANIEL ZUCKER 
What exactly is the Hopkins Marine Station? If you
have no idea about the answer to this question, you need
not fear being branded as ignorant, for you fall into a
group that includes many of your fellow Stanford stu
dents.
The station, in fact, is nearly as old as Stanford itself.
Founded in 1892, Hopkins Marine Station is the oldest
marine laboratory on the Pacific Coast and the second
oldest in the United States. The station falls under the
jurisdiction of Stanford's department of biology.
"Research in marine biology" and "furthering educa
tion" are the station's main missions, according to Prof.
David Epel, the station's acting director. Combining
these goals means in part that marine organisms are
studied at the station not only for their own merit but as
models for more general systems.
For example, Epel is using sea urchin eggs to study the
mechanisms involved in egg fertilization and early devel
opment in general.
Likewise, Epel said, Asst. Prof. William Gilly is using
squid axons to study the ways in which nerve impulses
are transmitted â€” information applicable to many more
organisms.
Even the Stanford University School of Medicine is in
volving itself in such research. According to Epel, Pathol
ogy Prof. Irving Weissman is using the protochordate, a
marine invertebrate, to study the origins of the immune
system.
Epel said tremendous opportunities exist for student

involvement at the station, and the most common avenue
is through the courses given at the station.
In the spring quarter, between 10 and 20 Stanford un
dergraduates come to the station to take an intensive
course centered on one particular topic area. Epel ex
plained that this is a total immersion program in which
the students live at the facility and devote all of their time
to marine studies. Eventually, the students are allowed to
pursue individual research projects.
In the summer, Epel continued, the station is opened
to graduates and undergraduates from all over the
United States. A more diverse selection of courses, be
tween six and eight, is offered for this expanded session.
Epel commented that a large amount of student re
search is ultimately published.
To assist in these varied projects, the station has equip
ment ranging from scuba gear to electron microscopes.
A small boat for sample collecting, several mini
computers and a complete library make up what Epel
called "excellent facilities for these courses." The station
itself is located in a marine biological preserve, making it
a particularly suitable place to do such research.
Though the station is a near-ideal research facility,
Epel emphasized that a "virtual revolution" in biological
research techniques is necessitating an expansion of the
station. As yet, though, no concrete plans have been
made for such projects.
For further information about the station, Epel recom
mends contacting Judy Thompson at the Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove, or Noreen Ford in the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences.
