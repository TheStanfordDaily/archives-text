## Stanford cracks AP, UPI top twenties 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
On the strength of its first 4-0 start
since 1952, the Stanford Cardinal has
earned the No. 18 ranking nationally in
the Associated Press Top 20 by a panel
of sportswriters from across the nation.
It is the first time since 1982 that the
Cardinal has cracked the AP poll.
Stanford was also ranked in the
other major wire service poll, moving
up from No. 20 to No. 17 in the United
Press International Top 20. UPI polls
coaches for its rankings. Stanford was
picked No. 18 in the USA Today/CNN
poll as well, jumping six spots this
week, the biggest jump of any one
team in the poll.
But rankings won't mean anything
when No. 12 Washington, a 50-18 win
ner over California on Saturday, visits
Stanford Stadium for a nationally
televised matchup with the Cardinal.
"Washington is the best football

team [we'll play] this year," Stanford
■Coach Jack Elway said at yesterday's
[press conference. "They've definitely
jgot the best defense — 1 think their
defense stands up to any in the
[country.'
But Elway refused to criticize his of
fense, which has scored only 17 points
in each of its last two outings — a 17-7
victory over Oregon State and Satur
day's 17-10 win over San Diego State.
"We're never satisfied in terms of how
we want to execute," he said. "But I'll
say it again: 1 don't nitpick a win. I
think 17 points will be enough to win
on Saturday — if they score 16."
Elway said that Jeff James, the na

tion's top receiver through two games
who has missed the last two with a
sprained heel, should be ready for Sat
urday, as should tackle John Zentner,
who missed the San Diego State game
with a pulled groin. Tackle Jeff Marchin
is still questionable with a pinched
nerve in his neck.
James' return should greatly help
the passing game, which in his absence
has lacked its usual explosiveness un
der quarterback John Paye, and should
force defenses not to concentrate on
wide receiver Thomas Henley.
"I think John Paye is doing fine," El
way said. "I do think we've had some
injuries and some mixups, and we miss
Jeff James, but he's done fine."
One injury that will hurt the Card
inal is the loss of cornerback Toi Cook
to a fractured wrist, possibly for the
rest of the regular season. Cook had
led the nation in interceptions going
into Saturday's game.
"It definitely hurts our spirit,"
outside linebacker Chris Weber said
about the loss of Cook. "We're confi
dent with Toi there. You can sense his
presence in the huddle — not by what
lie says but by how he plays."
"He's got that instinct to go for the
football," Elway said. "Toi's loose, and
he covers well, but he plays the ball
really well." Elway said he expects to
start Pat Kelly at Cook's position Satur
day, but may also move safety Walt Har
ris back to cornerback and start Hick
Theder at safety at some point this
season.
The Washington game is being seen
as a test for a top-20 team to prove it
belongs there. For Weber, there's
something more important. "We're
really not out to prove anything to
anybody but ourselves," he said. "It all
comes down to proving to ourselves
what we can do, what we can be."
Elway said: "I think we're pretty
damn good right now, and we're 4-0,
and I'm not going to be talked out of
it."
Card notes
A reminder that Saturday's game begins
at 4 p.m., not 1:30 as is printed on schedules

and tickets. It will be carried on national
cable television by the Turner Broadcasting
System.
There will be a representitive from the
Freedom Bowl at Saturday's game. The
game is played Dec. 30 at Anaheim Stadium.
It is the first bowl to express an interest in
the Cardinal.
Though the defense had only one fumble
recovery, the Cardinal continues to lead the
nation in turnover ratio at plus 2.75 per
game. The Cardinal is only allowing 11.8
points per game, eighth in the nation. Stan
ford is also ninth nationally in rushing

defense at 80.3 yards per game.
Linebacker David Wyman had 18
tackles Saturday to give him 57 in four
games. The senior was the Stanford choice
for Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week.
Fullback Brad Muster was chosen by the
offensive coaches for Offensive Player of
the Week following his season high 115
yards rushing on 21 carries. The junior also
scored on a touchdown run of three yards
and caught seven passes for 51 yards.
The Huskies lead the Pac-10 in rushing
defense, allowing only 74.5 yards per game,
good for seventh in the country. Washing

ton is No. 9 in the nation in turnover ratio
with a plus 1.5 per game.
The last time Stanford opened 5-0 was in
1951 under Coach Chuck Taylor. The Card
inal went on to go 9-0, but then lost Big
Game to California and the Rose Bowl to Il
linois to finish 9-2. Stanford faced Washing
ton in the sixth game of the season that year
as well, winning 14-7 and improving the its
record to 6-0.
Other seasons Stanford opened 5-0: 1940
(10-0, including a Rose Bowl win over Ne
braska), 1932 (6-4-1), 1929 (9-2), 1926 (10-
0-1, including a 7-7 Rose Bowl tie with

Alabama and Stanford's only national cham
pionship), 1924 (8-1-1, including a Hose
Bowl loss to Notre Dame), 1905 (8-0) and
1902 (6-1).
The last time the Cardinal cracked the top
10 was in the final poll of the 1971 season,
when a Rose Bowl victory over Michigan
put Stanford at No. 10. Stanford was No. 8
the previous year after winning the Hose
Bowl against Ohio State.
This is also the best start for a team
coached by Elway His 1982 San Jose State
team opened 3-0 before losing to Califor
nia.


The Stanford defense again rose to the occasion last Saturday against San
Diego State by burying opposing runners. Aztec Corey Gilmore (bottom of

pile with ball) totalled only 29 yards on nine carries, while San Diego State
amassed a mere 95 yards rushing during the game.
