### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
With a record of 4-5-2, the men's soccer team

Stanford's meeting with the Aggies last season,
the two teams battled to a 0-0 draw.
The Cardinal is coming off a 1-0 victory over
Westmont Saturday. It was goalie Tom Austin's
fourth shutout of the season and lowered his
goals-against average to a paltry 1.37. Austin re
corded five saves in the game in defending
against 12 Westmont shots on goal.
"Tom Austin came up with the key saves when
we needed them. We needed the victory after
playing well up in Seattle (in the Pacific-10 Con
ference Tournament)," Stanford Coach Sam Koch
said.
Forward/midfielder Brian Mahaffey, the
leading returning scorer for the Stanford team, is
available for today's game against the Aggies after
seeing his first action of the year in Saturday's
match against Westmont. He has recovered from
a stress fracture suffered before the season began.
Both Pat Sheehy and Tim W'estergren are suf
fering from stress fractures. They practiced yes
terday and could play in today's game.
With eight graduated players and numerous in
juries, the soccer team is essentially a completely
different unit from last season. "It's a new team,"
? said Koch. "The players that have been playing
have been dointj a real good job."

Entering today's game, forwards Juan Garcia
and Jim Cole lead the Stanford team in points
with five. Cole leads in assists with three, and Gar
cia shares the goal-scoring lead at two with Ross
Torres, who has four points. Kevin Woodhouse
also has four points for the Cardinal.
"Davis will be tough. It is important for us to
win to have momentum going into the St. Mary's
match. We're going to take it one day at a time,"
Koch said.

'It's a new team.... The
players that have been
playing have been
doing a real good job.'
