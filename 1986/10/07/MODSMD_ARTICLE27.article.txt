### 
SEATTLE (AP) — Dave Krieg threw
for three touchdowns, two in an 18-
second span in the third quarter, as
Seattle beat San Diego 33-7 yesterday
on a record-breaking receiving night
for the Seahawks' Steve Largent and
the Chargers' Charlie Joiner.
After a frustrating start, Largent
caught a 17-yarder from Krieg early in
the second quarter for his 128 th con
secutive game with a catch. He also
moved into fourth place on the all-time
receiving yardage list and caught a 15-
yard touchdown pass, the second of
Krieg's three.
Joiner moved past Don Maynard to
become the NFL's all-time receiving
yardage leader on a 20-yard pass from
Dan Fouts in the third quarter. He
finished with four receptions for 39
yards and now has 11,855 yards.
It was also a banner night for
Seattle's Norm Johnson, who kicked
four field goals, including a 54-yarder
that tied his own team record, and for
Curt Warner, who ran for 142 yards on

28 carries. Krieg, whose other scoring
passes were a 46-yarder to Byron
Franklin and a two-yarder to Eric Lane,
was 21 of 35 for 284 yards.
But the night was particularly gratify
ing for Largent, who spent the evening
listening to cries of "Steve, Steve,
Steve'' from the Kingdome crowd of
63,287. Most satisfying was his touch
down, which topped off the Seattle
burst that turned a 7-6 deficit into a 23-
7 lead in 1:45. It was aided by two
fumbles by San Diego's Lionel James.
The rally began 4:24 into the third
period with Johnson's 54-yard field
goal which gave the Seahawks their
first lead of the night. Johnson also had
second-quarter field goals of 29 and 30
yards and a 20-yarder in the final quar
ter.
Then, one play after Joiner's record
breaking catch, Kenny Easley stripped
the ball from James, and Eugene Rob
inson recovered for Seattle at midfield.
Two plays later, Krieg threw the bomb
to Franklin.

James fumbled the ensuing kickoff,
and Lane recovered for Seattle. On the
next play, Krieg hit Largent for the
score that made it 23-7 and broke the
game open.
The victory was the fourth in five
games for Seattle and the Chargers lost
their fourth iN five.
