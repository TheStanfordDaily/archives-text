# 5-foot-2, low IQ?
## 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
For reasons that are not entirely
clear, there seems to be a relationship
between height and intelligence in
children, a group of Stanford research
ers recently reported.
Scientists concluded that height ac
counted for a two percent variance in
the IQ scores of the shortest to the tal
lest children.
The study tested 13,887 non
institutionalized children between the
ages of six and 17 and included their
scores on two types of intelligence
tests: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale
for Children (WISC), which measures
intellectual ability, and the Wide Range
Achievement Test (WRAT), which
measures academic achievement.
According to Stanford pediatrician
Dr. Darrell Wilson, one possible expla
nation for the findings is that short
children are treated differently by
adults than taller children. Short
children tend to be babied, he ex
plained.
The difference could also be caused
by some intra-uterine damage or post
natal malnutrition that affects height as
well as intelligence, he added.
Because the study showed no
change in the correlation as the
children grew with age, researchers
cautioned against any type of therapy,

such as the use of synthetic growth
hormones, to stimulate growth in short
children for the purpose of trying to
increase intelligence. They suggested
that a child's intellectual abilities may
be determined early in life and would
not be affected by any relative changes
in height.
When told about this study, 6-foot-2
junior Barb Hunt, a psychology major,
said: "I think it's great, if it's true. There
are so many people who don't like
being tall, especially women."
Hunt, a member of the Stanford
women's basketball team, said she en
joys being tall. As a child, she recalled
that people often mistook her for
being older than she actually was.
"When you're taller, people think
you're older," Hunt explained."They
treat you older and expect you to act
older."
"It's absolute nonsense," said fresh
man Susan Lopez-Aguado about the
height-intelligence correlation. A
petite five-foot-tall woman, Lopez-
Aguado plans to major in chemical en
gineering. "I don't feel inferior to tall
people."
She did, however, have a few com
plaints about being short. "When you
buy pants, the legs are always way too
long,'' she said. She also said she
dislikes "getting used as an armrest"
and has difficulty seeing over people's
shoulders when standing in a crowd.
