"The best way to fight for peace is to know
about each other, said Stanislav Rostotsky, the
head of a visiting delegation of Soviet citizens.
Rostotsky and two members of the delegation
yesterday conducted an informal discussion ses
sion with Stanford students at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
The three Soviets are in the United States as
part of a bilateral exchange with the Soviet Union
sponsored by the Center For U.S.-U.S.S.R In
itiatives. A group of Americans from the Bay Area
visited the Soviet Union in April on a similar trip.
Rostotsky, a noted Soviet film director and vice
president of the Soviet Peace Committee, Victor
Sheine of the Institute of International Relations
and Sergei Fabrichnikov of the U.S. and Canada
Studies Institute are visiting Stanford for five days
to learn more about the U.S. educational system
as well as to broaden the understanding between
American and Soviet people. Other members of
the delegation are at UC-Berkeley. They are

staying with American families and will head
north for Washington after leaving the Bay Area.
Fabrichnikov emphasized that exchange is im
portant to both nations. "This provides good op
portunities to know each other better and to en
large contacts in scientific fields. The fields with
possibilities of exchange are wide."
Sheine added that the delegation sought to im
prove relations at all levels of society.
All three pointed out that the avenues available
for exchange are much more open than they have
been in previous years. Stressing the importance
of Americans knowing that Soviet citizens are
"normal," Rostotsky said: "We like American
people and American culture, and you must know
us. We must speak about politics and life and
love."
Rostotsky, whose films have twice been
nominated in the United States for Academy
Awards, said he believes that films could be use
ful in achieving the goal of mutual understanding.
"We should intensify exchange in films and
books and literature. It's the most important.'
