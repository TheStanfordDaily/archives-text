# University to fight stadium seat-saving
## 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM 
Beginning Saturday at the
Washington-Stanford football game,
the long-standing but infrequently en
forced policy against seat-saving in
Stanford Stadium will be more
strongly enforced.
The stricter enforcement, to include
increased police forces at games, is a
response to complaints that large
groups — mainly dorms and fraterni
ties — send a few students to reserve
large blocks of seats, excluding and in
timidating smaller groups and individ
uals.
"It has gotten worse in recent times,
and it reached unacceptable levels at
the San Diego State game," said Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons. He ex
plained that dorms and fraternities
tend to intimidate smaller groups by
using "bully tactics."
Lyons also cited as a problem the
tendency for groups to line up outside
the stadium hours before —
sometimes the night before — games.
In the lines there are problems with
drunkenness, especially when high
school students become involved, he
said, adding that the combination of
drunkenness and the great rush into
the stadium when the doors open is
very dangerous and has resulted in in
juries. "We were very, very lucky that
there wasn't a serious accident (last
weekend)," Lyons said.
Lyons and Director of Athletics Andy
Geiger today will release a statement
outlining the policy. Additionally, a let
ter will be sent tomorrow to the
residences.
Geiger stated that the policy is basi
cally "an appeal to the good judgment

anu goou neiglioor sense that we
hopefully have in this community."
Geiger said he hopes that once stu
dents are asked to obey the no-seat
saving rule they will respect the policy
and honor the rights of others.
"If people really want to be there
and sit as a group," Lyons said, "they'll
have to be there as a group."
Marvin Herrington, chief of Stanford
Police and director of Public Safety,
said: "It only becomes a police prob
lem if people try to push each other
around." But, he added: "My hope is
that students will respect each other to
the point at which they will
cooperate."
In response to the strengthened en
forcement of the seating policy, Jim
Flanigon, president of the Theta Delta
Chi fraternity, said he will be sorry to
see the policy vigorously enforced. "A
lot of the fun of the game," he ex
plained, "is being with people you
know."
"It's up to the people saving the
seats to make sure that they are
respectful of the other people in
volved," commented Jack Alden, a resi
dent advisor in Roble Hall. He added
that the policy, instead of focusing on
the saving of seats, should focus on the
lines outside the stadium and the gen
eral admissions process. "That's where
the unsafe things are," he said.
According to Alden, the effective en
forcement of a seating policy would re
quire police involvement that, he feels,
would only serve to create more an
tagonism and would cause problems
such as those that occurred at Berkeley
during Big Game two years ago.
Big groups do like to sit together, Al
den admitted, saying: "It's a little un
reasonable to try to stop that."
