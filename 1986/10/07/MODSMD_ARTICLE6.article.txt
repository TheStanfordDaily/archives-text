# Group to review Western Culture
## 
### FRANK QUARATIELLO 
In response to criticism that the
Western Culture Program fails to ad
dress the concerns and contributions
of women, minorities and other
cultures, Provost James Rosse has ap
pointed a task force to com
prehensively review the program and
recommend specific reforms.
The task force will be headed by His
tory Prof. Paul Seaver and will include
Asst. Provost Fernando de Necochea,
Philosophy Prof. John Perry, Clayborne
Carson, associate professor of history;
Susan Stephens, asscociate professor
of classics; Barry Katz, an instructor for
VTSS (values, technology, science and
society); Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Carolyn Lougee, and two stu
dents to be named by the ASSU.
They will focus on the under
representation of women and
minorities in the Western Culture
courses, a requirement for graduation.
The first meeting of the task force
will be within two weeks, according to
Seaver. In the meantime, some task
force members are familiarizing them
selves with the issues by studying in
formation provided by Lougee.

The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which last week advised Rosse
to form the task force, has suggested
that the group complete a preliminary
report in January 1987 and a subse
quent report in April 1987.
Seaver said he feels that these
deadlines might pose a problem since
he would like to consult with as many
people as possible on all sides of the
issue before drafting a report. This may
take more time, but Seaver is
"determined that the task force ac
complish its goals because the prob
lem has been overlooked too long," he
said.
When the Western Culture Program
was first established in 1980-81, profes
sors were encouraged to experiment
with course content and to incorporate
women and minorities into the core
program. The result was divergence of
the Western Culture tracks away from
the core list.
At an open forum held last Tuesday
to discuss the Western Culture pro
gram, Carson said a fair treatment of
Western Culture must reflect the fact
that "the domination of the non-
Western world has brought new ele
ments into the West."
