If Brian Lantz gets his way, all Stanford stu
dents and employees will he tested for the
AIDS virus and those people who test positively
for the virus will not lie allowed to attend, teach
or work at this institution.
Lantz is a longtime associate of political ac
tivist Lyndon Laßouche and a co-author of
Proposition 64, the AIDS iniative facing Califor
nia voters on the November election hallot. The
controversial proposition has drawn fire from
many quarters, including Stanford President
Donald Kennedy and Dr. David Korn, dean of
the Stanford Medical School.
The proposition has also been opposed by
many California medical associations,
numerous Democratic and Republican
politicians and groups like the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GIAS).
The supporters of the initiative seek to
declare its contagious all carriers of the AIDS
virus and make them subject to quarantine and
reportable disease regulation According to the

ballot, the proposition could cost taxpayers
hundreds of millions of dollars if the measure
is interpreted to require added disease controls
to contain AIDS, acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
Essentially, the proposition puts AIDS in the
same category as highly contagious com
municable diseases that can warrant stronger
public health measures than those currently in
use.
Kennedy, Korn and six other Stanford faculty
members were among the prominent citizens
asking the public to defeat Proposition 64 in an
ad that appeared in The Palo Alto Weekly on
Sept. 24. Kennedy, a former head of the Food
and Drug Administration, said that he rarely
takes public stands on political issues but was
moved to act by the glaring problems with the
initiative.
The ad also solicited contributions for a Palo
Alto-based group called Scientists and Citizens
Against 64, which sponsored the public appeal.
The other Stanford signatories, all acting as in
dividuals, were Paul Berg, professor of bio

chemistry and 1980 Nobel Prize recipient;
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi; emeritus engi
neering faculty member Edward Ginzton; Dr. R.
Hewlett Lee, clinical professor of surgery;
W.K.H. Panofsky, former director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator; and Law School Prof.
Byron Sher, a state assemblyman.
The open letter in the advertisement called
Proposition 64 .. an attempt by a small politi
cal group to dictate the public health policy of
California."
Peninsula No On 64, a coalition of Stanford
students and area residents, has been working
on campus to fight the initiative. GIAS member
Roland van Gaalen, a Stanford doctoral student
in statistics and economics, says that anti-64
workers at Stanford have registered hundreds
of voters on the campus. According to van
Gaalen, the majority of those who registered
appeared to be already opposed to Proposition
64.
"Many students seem to regard the outcome
as a foregone conclusion," van Gaalen said,
refering to the fact that many voters assume the

proposition has no chance to succeed. But, he
added, "we shouldn't be complacent. You can
never tell what's going to happen in Bakersfield
and Fresno.
"1 think we will win this campaign," van
Gaalen added, "but if it is a small margin it
would be very bad. It would be nice if we could
completely obliterate the Laßouche campaign.
Much of the anti-64 literature focuses on the
connection to Lyndon Laßouche, who, among
other comments, has called Britain's Queen
Elizabeth a drug pusher.
GLAS and Peninsula No On 64 will be co
hosting a "Stop Laßouche" party at the Vortex
dance club on Tuesday, Oct. 14. All proceeds
from the "progressive rock" dance party will go
to the statewide No On 64 campaign.
The pro-64 organization, Prevent AIDS Now
Initiative Committee ( PANIC), contends that the
proposition is justified because AIDS can be
contracted through casual contact. Lantz, who is
also vice president of PANIC, cites a reported
case of a three-year-old child who allegedly
gave AIDS to his older brother by biting him.

But most medical experts say that AIDS can
only be contracted through intimate contact —
sexual intercourse with an infected person,
receipt of infected blood through transfusions
or the use of infected needles. According to
Korn, the proposition has been presented to
the public "based on patently inaccurate scien
tific information which unproductively feeds
on public fears of a genuine health threat.
"The bottom line involving this initiative is
that everyone wants to see a rapid culmination
of the AIDS epidemic, but Proposition 64
would make that significantly more difficult.
Because the measure is based on scientific inac
curacies, it will send the fight agianst AIDS off
in unproductive directions, diverting resources
and attention away from the most productive
tracks of research and public policy," he said.
Critics of the proposition have argued that it
will lead to the unwarranted isolation of AIDS
victims, firing of food service workers and
removal of some teachers and students from
schools.
