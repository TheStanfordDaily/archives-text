Nicaragua: Americans downed
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The Defense Ministry said last night that a man
who survived the downing of a contra rebel supply plane in southern
Nicaragua identified himself as a U.S. military adviser in El Salvador, and
the three dead crewmen as Americans.
The ministry said in a statement that the survivor of the Sunday after
noon incident had identified himself as Eugene Hafenfuf, 35, and said he
was a U.S. military adviser in El Salvador.
There was no confirmation immediately available late yesterday of
Hafenfuf s identity by U.S. officials in Central America.
However, ABC's "Nightline" reported early today that U.S. Assistant Sec
retary of State Elliott Abrams flatly denied that the plane could have been a
U.S. military aircraft because Congress has prohibited such aid to the con
tras.
Earlier in Washington, Maj. Eugenia Thornton, a Pentagon spokes
woman, said she had no report on the plane incident, no confirmation that
it had occurred, and no identification of any individuals who might have
been aboard such a flight.
The Nicaraguan Defense Ministry statement said Hafenfuf had identified
the other crewmen as Americans but it gave no further details about him or
his whereabouts yesterday, or about the three dead crewmen.
The government's Voice of Nicaragua radio said the plane was shot
down about 18 miles north of San Carlos, near the Costa Rican border. San
Carlos is 91 miles southwest of Managua.
It said the plane was believed to be a propeller-driven DC-6.
Capt. Rosa Pasos, Defense Ministry spokeswoman, told The Associated
Press there was no confirmation of reports from the area that several
people, including an American, had survived and been captured. She said
three bodies were found inside the plane.
She said nationalities of the victims was unknown, and that details of the
incident were sketchy.
No one who was authorized to comment could immediately be located
at the U.S. embassy. The United States has supported the contra rebels in
their 4-year-old war to oust Nicaragua's leftist government.
Sandinista troops previously have shot down two full-sized rebel planes,
as well as four light planes and seven helicopters, in the war with the con
tras, Pasos said.
BankAmerica merger proposed
SAN FRANCISCO — Beleaguered BankAmerica Corp. said yesterday it is
considering a $2.77 billion merger proposal from First Interstate Bancorp
that would combine the nation's second and fourth largest banks.
Announcement of the potential mega-merger came at the end of
BankAmerica directors' monthly meeting and after stock-market trading
closed for the day.
Under the terms of the proposal, each share of BankAmerica common
stock would be exchanged for .22 of a share of First Interstate common
stock and one share of preferred stock estimated at about $6 per share by
First Interstate's investment banker, Goldman Sachs & Co.
BankAmerica stock closed up 87 cents to $12.25 a share yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange. First Interstate fell 37 cents to $54.75.
First Interstate officials did not immediately comment on the proposal.
Company spokesman Arthur J. Montgomery could not be reached.
BankAmerica, the nation's second largest bank holding company, had
revenues at the end of 1985 of $118.5 billion, smaller only than Citicorp
with $173.6 billion. First Interstate was fourth largest with $49 billion.
Soviet troop withdrawal begins
NEW DELHI, India — The Soviet Union will begin its promised pullout
of six regiments from Afghanistan next week, coinciding with the meeting
in Iceland between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
according to an Indian news agency report yesterday from Moscow.
The report, carried by United News of India and citing well-informed
sources, said the pullout will be completed by the end of October. It adds,
without specific attribution, that "further withdrawals will take place next
year depending on Pakistan's behavior in handling the intrusion of rebels
from its territory."
This is believed to be the first suggestion that Moscow is prepared to go
beyond the withdrawal of an estimated 6,000 troops from Afghanistan an
nounced by Gorbachev in a well-publicized speech on Asian policy in
Vladivostok July 28.
Western experts generally have played down the Gorbachev initiative as
little more than window dressing designed to ease diplomatic pressure on
Moscow over Afghanistan while putting pressure on Pakistan.
The timing of yesterday's report suggested broader Soviet goals,
however, and also provided indications that Moscow may be trying to
prepare opinion at home and elsewhere for an eventual total withdrawal
should considerable differences be bridged in negotiations between Af
ghanistan and Pakistan.
The attribution of the Indian news agency report made it unclear
whether it came directly from Soviet officials.
Laßouche followers are indicted
WASHINGTON — Federal, Virginia and Loudoun County, Va. law en
forcement officers staged a dawn raid on the Leesburg, Va. headquarters of
political extremist Lyndon Laßouche Jr. yesterday as a federal grand jury
in Boston handed up indictments of 10 Laßouche followers and five affili
ated organizations for credit card fraud and obstruction of justice.
The 117-count indictment, which names three of Laßouche's top aides
and a former Pennsylvania Ku Klux Klan leader who has worked closely
with the group for years, caps a 23-month grand jury probe of allegations
that the group defrauded thousands of contributors of more than $1 mil
lion.
More than 275 armed officers from numerous agencies, carrying search
warrants, took part in the 6:45 a.m. raid on two Leesburg office buildings
the Laßouche group rents.
"The indictment reflects the persistence of the FBI in investigating alle
gations in the face of attacks on the U.S. attorney's office and on the FBI and
(the group's) efforts to stop the investigation," said Robert Mueller 111, the
U.S. attorney in Boston.
Laßouche group spokesmen yesterday called the charges politically
motivated.
Federal officials said the investigation had been one of the most difficult
in recent memory because the Laßouche group had filed many court mo
tions delaying the proceedings. Authorities said the federal and state inves
tigations are continuing.
Hostages plead for assistance
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Three French hostages said in a videotaped appeal
for help yesterday that they believe their government has abandoned them
to a slow death, and they cannot survive captivity much longer.
Islamic Jihad, the fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group that holds the
Frenchmen and at least three Americans, said it would free them if Kuwait
releases 17 prisoners convicted of bombing the U.S. and French embassies
there in 1983.
The Islamic Jihad statement did not mention the American captives, but
the group made the same demand in the past in exchange for their
freedom.
Copies of the 20-minute videotape and the typewritten statement in
Arabic from Islamic Jihad, whose name means Islamic Holy War, were
delivered to offices of Western news agencies in Moslem West Beirut.
Hostage Jean-Paul Kauffmann, a journalist, appealed for diplomacy by
Premier Jacques Chirac's government similar to tactics the U.S. government
used to gain the release of American journalist Nicholas Daniloff from the
Soviet Union. All three Frenchmen were kidnapped early last year.
In a similar videotape from Islamic Jihad last Friday, two American
hostages asked the Reagan administration to work as hard for their
freedom as it did for Daniloff s.
