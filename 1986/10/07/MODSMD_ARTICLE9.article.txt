# Crippled Soviet submarine sinks
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — A Soviet nuclear-powered sub
marine lost its three-day battle for survival in the
predawn darkness yesterday morning and, after a
frantic effort to rescue the crewmen still aboard, sank
in 18,000 feet of water about 600 miles northeast of
Bermuda.
The Yankee-class submarine, damaged by an ex
plosion and fire Friday morning, had been on a
routine patrol in"The Box," about 1,300 miles off the
U.S. East Coast, when the liquid fuel in one of its
missiles caught fire, causing a gigantic explosion that
ripped the cap off one of its 16 missile tubes and tore
holes elsewhere in the 9,300-ton ship, according to
the Defense Department.
One of several Soviet merchant ships that had
steamed to the scene attempted to tow the sub north
eastward for much of the day and night Sunday. But
a Pentagon spokesman said the salvage crew in the
Yankee apparently could not control the leaks.
A Navy P3C Orion anti-submarine plane from Ber
muda reported that the submarine started to sink at
12:20 a.m. EDT and slipped under the waves at about
4 a.m. after all remaining crewmen were removed,
the Pentagon said.
Three crewmen died in the original explosion and
fire.
Washington Post correspondent Celestine Bohlen
reported from Moscow that the Soviet government
acted with unusual candor and speed in announcing

the sinking in a radio broadcast, saying that "the im
mediate cause is the speedy flooding of water from
the outside. The reactor has been shut down. Accord
ing to the conclusion of specialists, the possibility of
a nuclear explosion and radioactive contamination of
the environment is excluded."
The Pentagon agreed with the Soviet assessment
about contamination. High-ranking military officers
who briefed reporters yesterday said the nuclear
warheads on the missile that caught fire were either
burned completely or ejected into the ocean without
exploding.
The officers said they also doubted that the nuclear
power plant now lying on the rocky bottom of the At
lantic would deteriorate and send poisonous radio
active substances into the surrounding ocean.
The explosion apparently was in the third missile
tube behind the sail on the port side. The explosion
evidently caused a fire too big to control and filled
much of the submarine with smoke, forcing the
Yankee skipper to surface where the lethal fumes
could be ventilated into the open ai..
The Soviet news agency Tass did not say how many
crewmen were injured, but Pentagon sources said
several were hurt and were taken off the submarine
by small boats from the three to five freighters on the
scene.
Small boats battled heavy seas as they rescued the
remainder of the 120-man crew by searchlight, ac

cording to the Pentagon.
Navy officials said the sunken sub is one of the
oldest in the Soviet fleet and doubted there would be
an effort to retrieve it.
The submarine had been towed only 80 miles at a
speed of 2 mph before the freighter abandoned the
effort. The U.S. government had offered to send Navy
ships to assist the Soviets but was told to "remain
clear," according to the Pentagon.
Noting that the missile door had been "torn com
pletely loose and bent back like a pretzel," the Pentf
agon officials said that "the force of the explosion
was enormous when it came up through that tube. So
obviously the ship had a very severe shock when that
explosion occurred. It may have kicked some circuit
breakers open. It is also safe to assume that the vessel
was obviously taking on a great deal of water.
"The damage to the submarine is in the missile
area," the briefers said, but they said they were not
sure what caused the explosion.
The Pentagon officials said U.S. forces had sampled
the air and water around the sub and detected no
sign of radioactivity as of yesterday. They added that
two U.S. nuclear submarines have sunk in the last
two decades and that in sampling the bottom and
marine life around them, "we've never had any
detectable increase over the normal background ra
diation."
