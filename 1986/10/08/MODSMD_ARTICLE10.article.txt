# Reagan seeks free hand at summit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
appealed directly to Congress yester
day to erase tough restrictions on his
nuclear weapons program, arguing
that his weekend summit with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev "can only
succeed if our government is united."
Two days before flying to Iceland,
Reagan summoned Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders to a
White House breakfast to "make a spe
cial appeal'' for lifting House-passed
barriers to his arms buildup.
"It is exceedingly difficult for me to
enter into discussions with the Soviets
when legislative restrictions apply to
the very areas that are under negotia
tions with the Soviets," Reagan told the
lawmakers.
"I ask you not to tie my hands. Don't
undermine my negotiating position.

Each of you are key to any chance we
have of proceeding with a united gov
ernment. I appreciate very much your
efforts to help make this trip a suc
cess."
The House has approved a budget
measure that would ban nuclear tests,
prohibit testing of anti-satellite weap
ons, require adherence to the SALT II
treaty, freeze funding for Star Wars
defense and block production of bi
nary chemical weapons. A Senate ver
sion of the catch-all spending bill con
taias no such restrictions.
"I believe very strongly that a
meeting of this kind can only succeed
if our government is united," Reagan
said. "I cannot stress the importance of
this enough. I need your bipartisan
support. On occasions in the past,
where it was clearly in the national in

terest to unite, we have done so. I have
every confidence that we will do so
again on this occasion."
House Majority Leader Jim Wright
(D-Texas) has offered to put off further
action on the restrictions until after the
Iceland meeting and the regular sum
mit expected to follow late in the year.
Wright said he told the president
that "we do not want to have a divisive
quarrel before the summit."
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said Wright's proposal for
delaying any decision was discussed,
but indicated the White House wants
the issue resolved now.
"It was the president's position that
we would prefer to pass" a spending
bill for the entire year "with appropri
ate funding levels on domestic and
defense spending and that it be with

out restrictions on the president's
policy-making abilities in SALT 11, nu
clear testing and the other areas we
have laid out," said Speakes.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State
George Shultz said the summit should
give "additional impulse and guid
ance" for curbing medium-range nu
clear missiles in Europe and Asia but
that an agreement will not be "a piece
of cake by any means."
While the Soviets are expected to
press their demands for a moratorium
on nuclear weapons tests, Shultz said
that "as long as you have nuclear weap
ons, you have to conduct tests.... Just
to all of a sudden stop testing we don't
think would be a wise idea from our
standpoint."
