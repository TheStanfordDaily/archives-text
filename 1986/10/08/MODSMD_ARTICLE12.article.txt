# Expert discusses Daniloff case
## 
### JOHN POLLACK CLAY CALVERT Staff writers 
Stating that the United States "paid a
ransom" for the release of U.S. jour
nalist Nicholas Daniloff from the Soviet
Union, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution last night criticized the
Reagan administration's handling of
the Daniloff case.
Richard Staar, a Soviet affairs expert,
told more than 75 people at Branner
Hall that the exchange of Daniloff for
accused Soviet spy Gennadi Zakharov
established "a very bad precedent" for
U.S. dealings in similar cases.
Daniloff, a correspondent for U.S.
News and World Report, was arrested
in Moscow last month and charged
with spying for the CIA. After spending
13 days in a Soviet prison and 17 days
under protective custody at the U.S.
Embassy, Daniloff was expelled from
the Soviet Union for "impermissable
activities."
Zakharov, a member of the Soviet
mission at the United Nations, pleaded
no contest to charges of espionage and
was expelled from the United States
for five years.
"The U.S. did not get the best of the
deal," Staar said, noting that world
public opinion of the case "equates
Daniloff with Zakharov" as a spy.
Stressing that Daniloff was not a spy,
Staar said the exchange demonstrated
to the Soviets that "the U.S. will always
trade a hostage for one of their KGB
people. In other words, we paid a ran
som for Daniloff."
Given the Reagan administration's
response, the Soviets might take
similar action in the future.
"The Soviets have done it once,
they'll do it again. Why shouldn't they
do it again?" Staar said.
"I think (the exchange) was the
wrong thing to do They would

have released Daniloff anyway," he
said.
He also predicted that the Soviets
will use this weekend's mini-summit in
Iceland — a result of the Daniloff case
— as an opportunity to cancel Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's promised
1986 visit to Washington.
Staar contrasted the Reagan adminis
tration's handling of the Daniloff affair
with the handling of similar cases in
the past. He cited the 1978 case of F.J.

Crawford, a U.S. businessman arrested
by the Soviets in response to the ar
rests of two alleged Soviet spies in the
United States.
Crawford, convicted of currency vio
lations, was released after the United
States imposed economic sanctions
against the Soviet Union. The accused
Soviet spies remained in U.S. prisons
five months after the release of Craw
ford.
"It was not a swap," Staar said.
