The once-secret plan of the White House to spread lies
that might prompt the overthrow of Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafi is a deliberate abuse of trust.
According to a trail of memorandums first disclosed
last week by Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, the
plan was to "combine real and illusionary events —
through a disinformation program — with the basic goal
of making Khadafi think that there is a high degree of in
ternal opposition to him within Libya, that his key trusted
aides are disloyal, that the U.S. is about to move agaiast
him militarily."
But instead of deceiving Khadafi, the White House
deceived the American press and therefore the American
people.
The Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 25 that the
United States and Libya were on a collision course and
that the Pentagon was planning new and bigger raids on
Libyan oil terminals. White House officials said the ac
count was "not authorized but was highly authoritative."
In short, they confirmed the report.
The New York Times later reported that a White
House directive appeared to have been too eagerly
carried out by the National Security Council officials who
were the Journal reporter's sources.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes, however, has
denied any disinformation campaign, and State Depart
ment spokesman Charles Redman told The Daily that
"there was no disinformation given out to American
journalists."
The policy outlined in the memorandums and ap
proved by President Reagan is simply "classic strategic
deception, not disinformation," Redman said. It's a mat
ter of "leading the recipients of information to believe
that something is other than what it is."

An example of such deception is the secret movement
of ships, something impossible to keep secret. Secretary
of State George Schultz said at a news conference last
week that the government has learned the press often
focuses on secret ship movements and therefore
decided to use this tendency' to make Khadafi think he is
in danger of being invaded.
"We can absolutely bank on the fact that if die fleet
does something or other, you (the press) will scream.
Khadafi will hear it, and the fleet may, or may not, be get
ting ready to do something," he said.
But at issue here are not military movements tossed
out for independent interpretation. The fact is that gov
ernment officials led journalists on a wild goose chase of
lies, and the American press was deliberately used as a
pawn.
All of us, the media and the people, must trust our gov
ernment to some extent. That trust was betrayed.
Granted, the initial intent was to lie abroad, not at
home. Schulz defended that intent by saying, "If I read
that my government was trying to confuse somebody
who was conducting terrorist acts and murdering
Americans, I would say, 'Gee, I hope it is true." "
But regardless of how noble or desirable the end, lies
are not a justifiable means. A lie inevitably casts doubt on
the speaker's honesty, and even his truthful words will
be tainted. If the United States lies about its plans regard
ing Libya, why should anyone believe its statements
about the Soviet Union or about anything else? Once we
are deceived, we have every right to doubt all statements
made by the deceiver.
"Total honesty is the bottom line" for U.S. government
dealings with American journalists, Redman told The
Daily. The events of the past week belie those words. We
can only hope that future events will uphold them.
