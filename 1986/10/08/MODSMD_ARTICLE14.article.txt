# Drugs an internal problem
## 
### 
America has finally begun to admit to its widespread and
profound taste for illegal drugs. Virtually every day we read
of the arrest or the overdose of yet another rock star or well
known athlete. Polls conducted in schools and on sidewalks
reveal startling figures of the extent of our drug use. Habits
once limited to the very wealthy or the very poor are taking
hold in every income bracket, in every social strata.
The avalanche of publicity that this epidemic has received
has led to a wave of proposals by our legislators to curb the
traffic of illegal drugs. Some have called for the death

JOHN MCDONNELL

penalty for dealers; others have requested "war-time"' levels
of appropriations for the battle against the import of drugs
across our borders. Every politician or public figure has his
or her own plan to combat this "importation of death" at
tempting to undermine the foundation of our country.
Apparently, our administration has taken the call to battle
literally. This summer we witnessed the attack on suspected
South American drug plants by U.S. Blackhawk helicopters.
We are training anti-drug commando forces in other
countries to raid the very factories that have provided their
depressed economies with a source of valuable American
dollars. In essence, we are attempting to stifle the supply
while tossing in the towel on the demand.
South American citizens have expressed outrage, perhaps
justifiably, at this intrusion upon their national sovereignty.
Who is the United States, they ask, to send warplanes or mil
itary- advisers to their countries because of an American
penchant for refined coca leaves or marijuana? Isn't the
United States' drug habit a domestic problem?
The reasoning of our present leaders, which supposedly
represents our collective national thinking, does appear a
bit curious. Our goal is to deny ourselves open access to
those intoxicants that are habit-forming and should be kept
in the hands of trained physicians. A serious habit can lead
to loss of productivity in the workplace and carries the pos
sibility of an overdose. Many robberies and violent crimes
are attributed to drug-trafficking and the need to support a
drug habit.
These problems do pose a serious threat to our national
stability, but isn't the only ultimate solution really here, in
our own country? What would we think if other countries
decided that they were sick of the pollution of their young
by American-made cigarettes and sent planes to firebomb
the tobacco fields in Virginia and North Carolina? The ef

fects of nicotine addiction aren't as immediately harmful as
cocaine or heroin addiction, but they are just as real and let
hal. It may take a smoker years to develop lung cancer or
emphysema, but that smoker will die just as assuredly as he
would from an overdose. Even if the smoker manages to
quit, the effects would linger and could possibly develop
into cancer. But a junkie who has quit his habit has virtually
no chance of a spontaneous overdose.
So is it that we Americans must rely on the existence of
immediate, visible effects of a harmful habit in order to
realize its danger? We legalize and control drugs that kill
slowly, like tobacco and alcohol, but if there's a chance that
the user may fall dead immediately, then we feel we must
take measures to prohibit that drug. Apparently, we do not
like to be shown the results of our habits. We'd rather com
mit suicide slowly and legally. As Abraham Lincoln
remarked more than 100 years ago, the biggest threat to the
future of the United States will not come from abroad, it will
come from enemies within.

In essence, we are trying to
stifle the supply while tossing
in the towel on the demand.

And despite elaborate and extensive measures to control
the flow of illegal drugs into our country', all indications are
that we have only slowed the escalation of drug smuggling.
Recent seizures of hundreds of pounds of cocaine and tons
of marijuana serve as proof that the market here for drugs is
booming and that our demand refuses to yield to our own
best interests. Nationwide networks facilitate the distribu
tion of these drugs throughout the country. The United
States is a consumer-oriented society, and apparently this
generation has transferred its conception of mass
consumption to our collective daig habit. The problem at
hand is as deeply imbedded in our system as the basic
tenets of capitalism and free trade. Therefore, we should
turn our attention inward if we are to ride out the wave of
our newest epidemic.

remarked more than 100 years ago, the biggest threat to the
future of the United States will not come from abroad, it will
come from enemies within.

In essence, we are trying to
stifle the supply while tossing
in the towel on the demand.

And despite elaborate and extensive measures to control
the flow of illegal drugs into our country', all indications are
that we have only slowed the escalation of drug smuggling.
Recent seizures of hundreds of pounds of cocaine and tons
of marijuana serve as proof that the market here for drugs is
booming and that our demand refuses to yield to our own
best interests. Nationwide networks facilitate the distribu
tion of these drugs throughout the country. The United
States is a consumer-oriented society, and apparently this
generation has transferred its conception of mass
consumption to our collective daig habit. The problem at
hand is as deeply imbedded in our system as the basic
tenets of capitalism and free trade. Therefore, we should
turn our attention inward if we are to ride out the wave of
our newest epidemic.
