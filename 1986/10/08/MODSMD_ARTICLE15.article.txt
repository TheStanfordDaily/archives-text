# Why not give Rehnquist a chance?

### 
Recently, The Daily printed an editorial entitled
"The Rehnquist Era" (Oct. 1) which, I must admit,
has me quite stymied as to the basis for the editors'
apparent fears regarding the future performance of
our new Supreme Court chief justice. The editorial
frequently questions Rehnquist's objectivity and in
fact takes several opportunities to wonder "whether
he will use his considerable talent to protect the Con-

stitution or simply to serve as a tool of the right-wing
ideologues in the Reagan administration." Sensing
that once again The Daily seemed to be perched on
the verge of over-reaction, I paused to mull over this
markedly inflammatory statement, but for the life of
me I could not figure out what The Daily is so
worked up about.
The Daily is worried that Rehnquist will fail to
protect the Constitution. As far as I can tell, however,
the chief justice is actually quite fond of the Constitu
tion; I'm sure he will do his best to protect our favor
ite near-bicentennial document from all excessively
broad-minded or indecent forms of interpretation.
Why, Rehnquist"s voting record shows that he stands
for the Constitution (exactly as our forefathers wrote
it, of course) and that he is perfectly willing to stand
up for anyone whose rights are expressly guaranteed
in the Constitution. Without his strong belief in up
holding the integrity of the Constitution, Rehnquist
could never have defended the legality of the
"separate but equal" doctrine that has played such a
tremendous part in our nation's history. Nor could
he have justified voting against allowing the press
and the public to attend most criminal trials (a
right" that is, after all, not actually written into the
first amendment). His ardor for the Constitution led

him to vote to uphold laws involving government
discrimination against aliens, minorities and illegiti
mate children, none of whom is specifically
protected by the Constitution. And we must not for
get Rehnquist's selfless willingness to discriminate
against women for their own good by voting, for ex
ample, to allow states to bar pregnant women from
working.
Rehnquist's great willingness to protect the Consti
tution can perhaps only be parallelled by his author
ity to do so. As chief justice, Rehnquist, along with his
clerks, determines which of the more than 5,000
cases filed each year will ever be discussed by him
self and the other justices (only 150 or so are heard).
Furthermore, as long as he votes in the majority,
Rehnquist has the authority to decide which justice
will write the majority opinion, the contents of which
generally establish the framework for future debate
on the subject.
Clearly, Rehnquist is going to protect the Constitu
tion. The question remains, however, as to why The
Daily is so worried about his appointment as chief
justice. Maybe The Daily is concerned that Rehnquist
will not support the average American. This would
be a strong point against him, but Rehnquist's very
demeanor suggests that he does support John Q.
Public: In fact, he's an average guy himself. He goes
out for beer and burgers with the clerks and prefers
to wear Wallabees and sweaters rather than wing tips
and pinstripes Heck, the guy plays poker even
month with fellow appointee Antonin Scalia and can
be found from time to time singing songs at the
piano with Scalia and fellow justice Sandra Day
O'Connor But most importantly, his voting record
shows that he believes in the rule of the majority
over assertions of minority rights If that's not stand
ing up for the average guy, 1 don't know what is,
If The Daily is not concerned about his support of

the common individual, perhaps the editors are
worried because Rehnquist used to be a drug addict.
If this is so, The Daily must realise that Rehnquist's
addiction is no longer an issue. Although he was
hospitalized five years ago for addiction to a painkil
ler after court employees noticed that his speech was
slurred and that he seemed to suffer memory lapses,
Rehnquist assured the President that he had long
since kicked the habit. He must have been convinc
ing because Reagan hired him as chief justice right
then and there.

In point of fact, Rehnquist
himself is quite an
average guy.

It seems that the most likely basis for The Daily's
hesitation about Rehnquist is fear of retribution.
Rehnquist does not appear to be overly fond of stu
dents, particularly active ones. He once labelled stu
dent radicals "the new barbarians" and did, in fact,
argue that President Nixon had the power to declare
"qualified martial law in order to quiet Vietnam War
protesters. But those were different times and those
60s protesters had such nasty grooming habits. They
really were kind of barbarian, weren't they?
By now it ought to be apparent that The Daily has
no cause for alarm. So, what d'ya say, folks; the guy is
already in for life, why don t we give him a chance?

Clearly, Rehnquist is going to protect the Constitu
tion. The question remains, however, as to why The
Daily is so worried about his appointment as chief
justice. Maybe The Daily is concerned that Rehnquist
will not support the average American. This would
be a strong point against him, but Rehnquist's very
demeanor suggests that he does support John Q.
Public: In fact, he's an average guy himself. He goes
out for beer and burgers with the clerks and prefers
to wear Wallabees and sweaters rather than wing tips
and pinstripes Heck, the guy plays poker even
month with fellow appointee Antonin Scalia and can
be found from time to time singing songs at the
piano with Scalia and fellow justice Sandra Day
O'Connor But most importantly, his voting record
shows that he believes in the rule of the majority
over assertions of minority rights If that's not stand
ing up for the average guy, 1 don't know what is,
If The Daily is not concerned about his support of

the common individual, perhaps the editors are
worried because Rehnquist used to be a drug addict.
If this is so, The Daily must realise that Rehnquist's
addiction is no longer an issue. Although he was
hospitalized five years ago for addiction to a painkil
ler after court employees noticed that his speech was
slurred and that he seemed to suffer memory lapses,
Rehnquist assured the President that he had long
since kicked the habit. He must have been convinc
ing because Reagan hired him as chief justice right
then and there.

In point of fact, Rehnquist
himself is quite an
average guy.

It seems that the most likely basis for The Daily's
hesitation about Rehnquist is fear of retribution.
Rehnquist does not appear to be overly fond of stu
dents, particularly active ones. He once labelled stu
dent radicals "the new barbarians" and did, in fact,
argue that President Nixon had the power to declare
"qualified martial law in order to quiet Vietnam War
protesters. But those were different times and those
60s protesters had such nasty grooming habits. They
really were kind of barbarian, weren't they?
By now it ought to be apparent that The Daily has
no cause for alarm. So, what d'ya say, folks; the guy is
already in for life, why don t we give him a chance?

Recently, The Daily printed an editorial entitled
"The Rehnquist Era" (Oct. 1) which, I must admit,
has me quite stymied as to the basis for the editors'
apparent fears regarding the future performance of
our new Supreme Court chief justice. The editorial
frequently questions Rehnquist's objectivity and in
fact takes several opportunities to wonder "whether
he will use his considerable talent to protect the Con-

stitution or simply to serve as a tool of the right-wing
ideologues in the Reagan administration." Sensing
that once again The Daily seemed to be perched on
the verge of over-reaction, I paused to mull over this
markedly inflammatory statement, but for the life of
me I could not figure out what The Daily is so
worked up about.
The Daily is worried that Rehnquist will fail to
protect the Constitution. As far as I can tell, however,
the chief justice is actually quite fond of the Constitu
tion; I'm sure he will do his best to protect our favor
ite near-bicentennial document from all excessively
broad-minded or indecent forms of interpretation.
Why, Rehnquist"s voting record shows that he stands
for the Constitution (exactly as our forefathers wrote
it, of course) and that he is perfectly willing to stand
up for anyone whose rights are expressly guaranteed
in the Constitution. Without his strong belief in up
holding the integrity of the Constitution, Rehnquist
could never have defended the legality of the
"separate but equal" doctrine that has played such a
tremendous part in our nation's history. Nor could
he have justified voting against allowing the press
and the public to attend most criminal trials (a
right" that is, after all, not actually written into the
first amendment). His ardor for the Constitution led

him to vote to uphold laws involving government
discrimination against aliens, minorities and illegiti
mate children, none of whom is specifically
protected by the Constitution. And we must not for
get Rehnquist's selfless willingness to discriminate
against women for their own good by voting, for ex
ample, to allow states to bar pregnant women from
working.
Rehnquist's great willingness to protect the Consti
tution can perhaps only be parallelled by his author
ity to do so. As chief justice, Rehnquist, along with his
clerks, determines which of the more than 5,000
cases filed each year will ever be discussed by him
self and the other justices (only 150 or so are heard).
Furthermore, as long as he votes in the majority,
Rehnquist has the authority to decide which justice
will write the majority opinion, the contents of which
generally establish the framework for future debate
on the subject.
