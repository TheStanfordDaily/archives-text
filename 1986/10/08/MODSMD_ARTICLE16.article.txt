# Gimme that sexy religion
## 
### 
Sex and religion have a lot in common. I think the first
time that any of us got involved with either of them, neither
lived up to its press. Both are pans of our lives where
fireworks are supposed to happen, and lots of time we get
pretty disappointed when they don't. Sex and religion are
also two things that you're not supposed to talk about in
public. Well, not in any depth at least. The statements ..
and then we went home together" and .. and then we
went to fellowship" are very similar in that a polite con
versational curtain is usually closed at that point, and details
are left to the imagination. We are not entirely comfortable
talking about either sex or religion. How do you react
when someone accosts you on the street and says, "Who is
your Lord and Savior?" It's happened to you, and it's hap
pened to me, and it seems to me to be about as comfortable
of a pick-up as, "Do you like oral sex?" We have countless
forums these days to talk about sex in this country. (Come
on, you read "Ask Beth" too, admit it). I want to talk about
religion.

I suppose in the usual pedantic kind of style my old En
glish teacher encouraged, I should define what I mean by
religion. I don't want to. (Precisely what do you mean by
sex? Gender? Roles? Courtship? Bonding? THE ACT?) Reli
gion is one of those things that just happens to people that
other people point at and say, "Hey, that's religious." I plan
to do a lot of pointing myself.
One of my friends seems to me to be the most religious
atheist I have ever met. Back when I was in high school, he
and I used to have the most heated discussions about
whether or not a supreme being existed and other related
matters. He would go into a tirade about all the horrible
things organized religions had done throughout history.
Wars, repression, slavery, torture: You name it, and organ
ized religions have been responsbile for it at one time or
another. The Afrikaaners are a very religious people, as are
the Libyans, he'd point out. He was right, but my friend was
also among the most moral people I knew. Didn't drink,
smoke or do drugs, and he followed an honest impulse to
do right by people. So maybe he didn't believe in a god or a
church, but his fervor in defending his beliefs made me feel
he had, nevertheless, a religion.
I think having a religion is a good thing.
Don't get me wrong. I think anyone showing a Falwellian
impulse to lord their purported moral superiority over
anyone else is as about as repulsive as you can get. But, 1
think that some people have the misconception that religion
is something well-dressed people do in stuffy rooms on
Sunday mornings. And it just ain't so. Religion is what you're
doing when you're grabbed by the gonads by the excite
ment of any idea. And there are a heck of a lot of really excit
ing ideas out there, particularly under the heading of reli
gion. Satori, salvation, satyagraha.... Wee, zowie! Religion is
probably the second best turn-on there is. Everyone should
have some.
Religion between consenting adults is something that

should be approached with some degree of responsibility,
however. Failure to observe some basic safe-religion
practices can result in such problems as unwanted hostili
ties or such social diseases as prejudice, persecution and —
the one that has been in the news most often recently— ter
rorism.
Religious terrorism is, of course, fatal in most cases, and
there is no known cure, although Washington has recently
claimed to have found a treatment. The so-called "surgical
strike" has only been approved for limited types of religious
terrorism and is merely a treatment. It is not a cure, and
scientifically rigorous double-blind testing has not been
completed. Nevertheless, if the appropriate prophylactic
measures are taken, people can have satisfying religious
lives despite the dangers.
Extended metaphors aside, it is important to approach
any religious discussion with a degree of tolerance and an
open mind because it is a very personal matter to most
people. The two real dangers, as I see it, are ignorance and
judgmentalism. Well, I'm no expert. (I did know one of the
two religious studies undergrad majors on campus two
years ago. He graduated. There was one listed in the direc
tor)' last year. There were 470 econ majors listed last year. I
just thought you'd like to know.) I will, however, endeavor
to be as accurate as I can. I also will try not to be a "Siskel
and Ebert and Religion" or the KZSU picks of religion (all
religions rated on a scale of one to four flightless waterfowl,
four being the best), but there have been ideas that have
made a strong impression on me from a wide variety of
religions, and those are the things I'd like to bring up in
future columns.
Religion is a wonderful tapestry, rich in history and cover
ing every aspect of the human condition. The institutions of
religion exert a remarkable influence on the social and poli
tical climates of the entire world today, and in addition to
religion's global ramifications, the ideas and philosophies of
the vast diversity of religions can affect us very personally. I
think that it is as important to come to terms with our
spirituality as it is to come to terms with our sexuality. I
think that other religions can be understood and tolerated
without compromising one's personal beliefs, and I believe
that only through toleration can the harsh religious differ
ences that plague the world be resolved.
Worship, faith and morality are the bedrock of the human
desire to be more than the flesh that encases us. Unfortun
ately, they are also the bedrock of the equally human desire
to feel superior to others as well, it seems. But we cannot
remedy that which is bad about religion without first com
ing to terms with what religion means to each of us as indi
viduals, and without accepting the fact that each of us does
have spiritual desires in the same, very real sense that each
of us has sexual desires. I think that we have had a genera
tion of spiritually frustrated people in this country, and 1
believe that the proliferation of exotic religious groups
during the '70s and the recent rise of so-called fundamen
talism are indications of that frustration. Yes, there have
been many atrocities committed by religions and religious
people in this world, and we will no doubt only see more in
the future. Nevertheless, we are no stronger than our con
victions will let us be, and I believe that solutions to any of
the world's ills will only be arrived at through religious
drive in concordance with intellectual achievement.
So: Hey, babe, how's your religious life?
