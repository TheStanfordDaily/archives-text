# Harvard stock sale explained
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Harvard University, which last week
announced it was divesting from eight
South Africa-related companies, did so
because of its "clear commitment to
avoid involvement as a shareholder in
significant sales to the South African
police and military."
That statement is contained in a
report issued last Thursday by Har
vard's Corporation Committee on
Shareholder Responsibility. The
report, which discloses the university's
divestment rationale, announced the
sale of $158.7 million in stocks and
bonds held in five major oil companies
and three other companies.
The major oil companies are Royal
Dutch Petroleum, Exxon, Texaco,
Mobil and Chevron. The other com
panies are Ford Motor Co.;
Schlumberger, an oil-drilling concern;
and Phelps Dodge, a mining company.
Stanford owns about $29 5 million
in six of the companies: Ford, Chevron,
Schlumberger, Mobil, Exxon and
Texaco.
The decision to divest came after
Harvard reviewed its entire stock
portfolio for sales to the South African
police and military â€” entities the
report says are "agencies of the South
African government directly involved
In the enforcement of apartheid."
Based on that evaluation, the Har
vard committee identified the oil, com
puter, automotive and mining indus
tries "as either important in the en
forcement of apartheid or strategic to
the South African government."
The committee said the probability
is high that the five major oil compan
ies sell to the government, since "the
South African government needs oil
products to operate its military and
police equipment, and South African
law expressly provides that companies
... supply such products to the govern
ment upon demand."
In addition, South Africa's 1977 Pe
troleum Products Act prohibits oil
companies from giving shareholders,
such as Harvard, any information about
sales of petroleum products to the mil
itary or the police, the report says.
Chevron, contacted yesterday,
denied that American companies sell
significant quantities of oil to the South
African government. The South African
government has its own sources for oil
and petroleum products, said Chuck
Wootton, Chevron's coordinator of in
ternational public affairs.
Wootton also stressed Chevron's lIA
rating on the Sullivan principles. The
Sullivan ratings are on a five-point
scale with I being the best. A lIA rating
means a company is "making good
progress" in implementing the prin
ciples.
