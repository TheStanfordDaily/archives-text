## The 						art of designing majors 
### MONIQUE SCHEER 
Having serious trouble deciding on a major because you
can't quite find your particular academic "niche"? Chances
are, you're one of approximately 200 students each year
with the same problem, according to Kathy Thoelecke at the
Undergraduate Advising Center (UAC).
Thoelecke, the program coordinator for the individually
designed major program for the School of Humanities and
Sciences, advises students who think an individually de
signed major may be the answer to their problem. "But
most of them just need more intense (academic) counsel
ing" she said.
Anyone wanting to get started in the I.D. major process in
the School of Humanities and Sciences, must first talk with
Thoelecke.
"I can tell within the first 30 minutes if (the student) is
suited for an I.D. major," she said. These students are
usually juniors, sometimes sophomores, who in their years
at Stanford have not been able to fit their academic goals to
any department in the School of Humanities and Sciences.
Each year somewhere between 20 and 25 students actually
get into the program.
According to Thoelecke, the School of Humanities and
Sciences is not seeking out students who might want to
pursue an I.D. major. Those who do go through the pro
gram, she said, "give up the benefit of 'rubbing shoulders'
with other students in their field."
Some students, however, are suited for the program, and
rather than being sought out, they themselves come to the
UAC. "These students are not confused," Thoelecke said.
They come into her office with a coherent, thought-out
proposal for study that simply does not fit under a depart
ment heading. Some students in the past have designed
such majors as paleoanthropology, the Black American
tradition, women and change, and architecture. The
proposals themselves are kept strictly confidential so that
there can be no chance of duplication.
"The point is that the major be unique to you," Thoelecke
emphasized.
Designing your own major can be exciting and fulfilling,
provided that you have a strong sense of what you want
from your undergraduate education. You can supplement
your program with an honors project, but it is not inher
ently an honors program. The only requirement is that you
have a lot of energy and initiative.

Students applying for an I.D. major in either the School of
Humanities and Sciences or the School of Engineering must
do so at least three full quarters before graduation. They
must submit a proposal that describes their motivation for
the proposed major, including evidence of its academic
merit, a list of the proposed courses that constitute the
major and the sequence in which they are to be taken.
The Committee in Charge in the School of Humanities
and Sciences does not list any specific requirements for any
I.D. major except that it contain at least 60 units in courses
above the 100 level. In approving proposals, it takes into
consideration whether the proposal is designed to meet the
aims of the student and whether the proposal is comparable
to degrees obtained by students in regular departments.
The committee also looks for breadth as well as depth in
the proposed courses of the major in order to protect the
liberal arts tradition of the school and to avoid over
specialization. And of course, it makes sure that the work is
interdisciplinary and cannot be done through an already es
tablished major.
The I.D. major in the School of Engineering, however,
must meet the general requirements established for engi
neering majors. These include at least 21 units of math, 17
units of science and 40 units of engineering courses. The
entire proposal can neither fall short of 90 units nor exceed
107 units.
Before proposals are submitted for approval, they must
be endorsed by advisers: two faculty members for the engi
neering major and three faculty members on the Academic
Council for the humanities and sciences degree. These
people become the student's permanent advisers for the
major.
The proposals are then submitted, with a current tran
script, to a committee for approval. If rejected, students can
make the necessary adjustments in their proposal and
reapply. Approval is understandably rigid, Thoelecke said,
"in order to protect the integrity of the degree."
As a result, individually designed majors have been as
well-received in the "real world" as any other degree given
at Stanford. Students who design their own majors generally
do not have a specific career in mind for which they would
like to train. They are usually primarily committed to an aca
demic pursuit that happens to be especially unique. Pursu
ing an individually designed major allows them to do so and
gives them a different, and no less gratifying, sense of ac
complishment, Thoelecke said.
