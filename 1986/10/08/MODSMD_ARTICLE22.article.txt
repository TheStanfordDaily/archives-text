Fraternity mess
"A Travis County (Austin, Texas)
grand jury's investigation into the
alcohol-related death of a University
fraternity pledge may widen to in
clude felony charges of tampering
with witnesses and aggravating per
jury against some fraternity mem
bers and other witnesses," the Sept.
25 Daily Texan reported. The Daily
Texan is the university newspaper at
the University of Texas at Austin.
Apparently, on Sept. 18, Phi Kappa
Psi fraternity pledge Mark Thomas
Seeberger died of alcohol poison
ing. Unidentified sources said that
investigators looking into
Seeberger's death believe that active
members of the fraternity encour
aged the pledges not to cooperate
with the Austin police department.
Tampering with a witness is
"where a person, with the intent to
influence a witness, coerces a
prospective witness to withhold any
information in an official proceed
ing."
Aggravated perjury is committed
"where a person, with the intent to
deceive, makes a false statement un
der oath or swears to the truth of a
false statement previously made."
Both charges are third-degree
felonies, punishable by two to 10
years in prison and a fine of up to
$3,500.
Terry Keel, assistant district attor
ney for Travis Countv, would not

confirm or deny these charges.
Autopsy reports show that
Seeberger died of an alcohol
overdose and had consumed about
18 ounces of rum within a two-hour
period. His blood alcohol level was
0.43 percent.
Seeberger was said to be on a
"ride" — "a hazing activity where ac
tive members drive pledges far from
campus and leave them to find their
way back."

The autopsy also revealed that
Seeberger had "Kiss my ass" and the
Greek letters for Phi Kappa Psi writ
ten on the back of his legs.
All about pizza boxes
Mont}' Zickubr, a columnist at the
Daily Evergreen wrote a very incite-
Jul opinions piece on "Reinventing

the Pizza Box We thought we'd share it with \>ou
You see them laying on the floors of residence
halls, stacked on top of trash cans and floating
about in various public places — pizza boxes.
It isn t that the people who order the pizza do
not care about the environment in which they
live, it's the construction of a pizza box that makes
it too cumbersome for neat disposal.
The boxes are ux) difficult to bend, making
them too large to fit in regular sized trash cans.
The flat, aerodynamic shape of a pizza box
leads many along the pathway of temptation as
they hurl their boxes out the window.
Perhaps the dining hall system is to blame for
the pizza-box plague. It they would deliver food
of the students choice right to their rooms,
maybe the Dominoes of the world would have
fewer boxes to manufacture, resulting in tidy sur
roundings.
Since it is unlikely the dining halls will ever of
fer home delivery, and nagging pizza-eaters to
clean up has shown no results, a major redesign
of the traditional pizza box is in order.
Stiff cardboard, which currently makes up a
box, could be replaced with a sturdy form of flash
paper. Then, when the pizza is gone, all one
would have to do is light a match and poof! in
stant vaporization.
However, this method does not solve the di
lemma of what happens to the uneaten pizza
crusts, which are usually strewn about the inside
of the box. When the disintegration of the box oc

curs, the pizza crusts will fall to the floor creating
an icky mess.
A practical method would be to make a
accordion-style pizza box, which would neatly
fold together for easy trash can disposal. The
bends could be made sturdy enough to keep the
box from collapsing as you carry the pizza up to
your room to eat, then, when your (sic) all done,
you can easily crush the box small enough to fit
into the trash.
The problem with the acordion box is that
even when the box is reduced in size, it still Will
take up all the space in those tiny trash cans WSU
(Washington State University) was so generous to
provide.
Another method would be to imprint each box
with a poster of some kind. After you finish eating
you can cut the box apart and cover your walls
with the four-color likeness of Barry Manilow,
Erik Estrada, Michael Jackson or one of your
other pop stars in a series to make stand-up fig
ures of President Reagan, Darth Vader or Marilyn
Monroe.
These novel solutions might work, but there is
one practical method that should be initiated im
mediately.
All over campus, in each dorm and in every
other place where pizza eating is popular, special
bins should be set up. Each bin should be 25
inches square and about four feet high, with a two
inch slot on top. Pizza boxes could be slid into
the slot and easily disposed of. Each bin could
hold at least 15 empty boxes and if a special com
pactor feature is added, even more.
Those bins would be cost-efficient; in fact, recy
cling the cardboard pizza boxes would eventually
pay for the bins, and would make the WSU
campus a more pleasant place to eat pizza.
