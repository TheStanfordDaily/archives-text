Fraternity mess
"A Travis County (Austin, Texas)
grand jury's investigation into the
alcohol-related death of a University
fraternity pledge may widen to in
clude felony charges of tampering
with witnesses and aggravating per
jury against some fraternity mem
bers and other witnesses," the Sept.
25 Daily Texan reported. The Daily
Texan is the university newspaper at
the University of Texas at Austin.
Apparently, on Sept. 18, Phi Kappa
Psi fraternity pledge Mark Thomas
Seeberger died of alcohol poison
ing. Unidentified sources said that
investigators looking into
Seeberger's death believe that active
members of the fraternity encour
aged the pledges not to cooperate
with the Austin police department.
Tampering with a witness is
"where a person, with the intent to
influence a witness, coerces a
prospective witness to withhold any
information in an official proceed
ing."
Aggravated perjury is committed
"where a person, with the intent to
deceive, makes a false statement un
der oath or swears to the truth of a
false statement previously made."
Both charges are third-degree
felonies, punishable by two to 10
years in prison and a fine of up to
$3,500.
Terry Keel, assistant district attor
ney for Travis Countv, would not

confirm or deny these charges.
Autopsy reports show that
Seeberger died of an alcohol
overdose and had consumed about
18 ounces of rum within a two-hour
period. His blood alcohol level was
0.43 percent.
Seeberger was said to be on a
"ride" â€” "a hazing activity where ac
tive members drive pledges far from
campus and leave them to find their
way back."

The autopsy also revealed that
Seeberger had "Kiss my ass" and the
Greek letters for Phi Kappa Psi writ
ten on the back of his legs.
