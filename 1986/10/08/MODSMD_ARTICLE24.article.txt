## New York City Ballet tours West Coast First Bay Area visit in 24 years reflects the Balanchine legacy 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
It would be difficult to imagine a
program by the New York City Ballet in
which George Balanchine's choreog
raphy did not shine with brilliance.
His classic piece, "Symphony in
Three Movements,' erupted with such
memorable vitality Saturday afternoon
that Peter Martins' description of
Balanchine's legacy as a "monument to
dance" became instantly definitive.
Performing last Wednesday through
Sunday at Berkeley's Zellerbach
Auditorium, the New York City Ballet
marked its first West Coast tour since
1974 and first visit to the Bay Area in 24
years. Works by ballet master in chief
Martins and co-director Jerome Hob
bins are a solid part of the repertoire,
while still frequently sharing programs
with the genius of works by their
predecessor Balanchine.
The dynamic .complexity of
"Symphony in Three Movements"
resonates with Stravinsky's imposing,
music to prcxluce a stylish ballet that
emphasizes pure energy over marked
emotions. Stravinsky's composition has
all the violence and tension Balanchine
sought in portraying post-war society.
Bringing the piece to life were conduc
tor Gordon Boelzner and the New
York City Ballet Orchestra, who also
performed the program's other pieces.
A corps of 16 pony-tailed women
(who were occasionally lacking in pre
cision) and a series of soloists and
principal couples weave their way
through a continuously developing
design. Many Balanchine hallmarks are
present: speed, accents and lightness
mixed with strength. Repeated jumps
that linger airbound, hips twisted to
the side and knees pulled in; all these
elements add a contemporary edge to
the piece.
Heather Watts and Jack Soto are es

pecially adept at artfully negotiating
the work's athletic demands. Their
Second Movement Pas De Deux, with
its powerfully knotted forms, is
strangely dramatic. So too is the en
semble's finishing pose: the men
crouched in readiness downstage, the
women standing behind, emphasizing
horizontal and vertical, as the music
concludes alone.
The dancers wear only leotards and
tights, with white for the corps, black

for the men, and a splash of startling
pink for the three principal women.
Simplicity of costume was always one
of Balanchine's aesthetics, as it gives a
clean, uncluttered look and does not
visually interfere with the dancers'
movement.
The Sonata for Two Pianos by
Poulenc lends a brooding quality to
Peter Martins' "Poulenc Sonata," a
portrait of romance and indecision. To
the fine accompaniment of two pianists

onstage, Kyra Nichols dances in medi
tation and distress over two men,
Alexandre Proia and Christopher
d'Amboise. Nichols' expression of in
ner strength is vivid hut not overdone.
Her primary asset is her lyricism,
which Martins deliberately explored
when choreographing this piece for
her.
