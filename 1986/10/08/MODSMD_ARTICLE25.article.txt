# R.E.M.: raw, energetic music
## 
### GREG CAMENZIND 
R.E.M. is not "rapid eye movement" — it's raw, ener
getic music. Actually, R.E.M. is a progressive rock-and
roll band from Athens, Georgia, also home of the Univer
sity of Georgia. The four fellows of R.E.M. came together
to play campus and local club gigs, but after four short
years and as many LPs, the band has played for audiences
throughout the United States. Recently, the boys from
Georgia came to play at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley,
only to cancel the show because of rain. But R.E.M.
promised to come back and play another day.
And it did. The band returned to the Oakland
Coliseum last Wednesday. The weather was fine and a
certain electricity seemed to fill the hall as R.E.M.'s per
severing, die-hard fans awaited the band's promised
return. Guadalcanal Diary, another Georgia band,
opened the show with a fairly good display of progres
sive music. The highlight of the set was the encore, an
extremely humorous parody of the musical styles of The
Who and Jefferson Starship in a medley including
"Cumbaya," "White Rabbit," "We Built This City" and"I
Can See For Miles."
R.E.M. started their set with a fitting interpretation of
the Creedence Clearwater Revival tune, "Who'll Stop the
Rain.' They then broke into "These Days," one of the
harder-edged tunes on their recent album "Life's Rich
Pageant." "These Days" is par for the course on the new
LP, layering Peter Buck's metal-style guitar leads with
Mike Mill's diverging and harmonic basslines. These ef
fects mesh tightly with the quick-tempoed drum of Bill
Berry, and vocalist Michael Stipe's haunting, mumbled
chants.
One of R.E.M.'s most surprising qualities is its rich,
harmonic vocal combinations. This ability was handily
represented in the band's rendition of "Moral Kiosk"
(from the "Murmur" LP), a song that has Stipe warbling
madly, at times almost yodeling, into the microphone.
The other group members supported Stipe's cries, creat
ing an aural landscape of differing harmonies.
R.E.M. has been criticized in the past for not changing
their live performances enough from their sound on
studio tracks. Perhaps it was in reaction to this that Wed-'
nesday's concert was filled with unusual stylistic varia
tions, especially on tunes from before "Life's Rich
Pageant."
"Auctioneer," from the "Fables of the Reconstruction"
LP, was particularly unique both in sound and perfor
mance. Stipe remained essentially motionless as he
stood slumped over the mike, almost droning as he

faced the side of the stage, while Buck applied a great
deal of distortion to his guitar licks. It should be clarified
that Stipe's stage presence is always interesting, even dis
turbing at times. He often focused his attention on one
person in the audience while making quirky gestures
and facial expressions.
Probably the most impressive song in sheer musical
quality was "I Believe," a declaration of faith in coyotes,
"time as an abstract" and change. The song is fueled by
ringing guitar riffs and Stipe's anthem-like incantation.
Again, Mike Mill's unusual ability to find alternate bass
harmonies enhances the melody magnificently. Peter
Buck once commented on Mill's harmonic innovations:
"When I come up with a chord progression, Mike will do
a bass part that has nothing to do with it but still makes
sense."
In addition to some fine interpretations of "Little
America," "Pretty Persuasion" and "Can't Get There
From Here," R.E.M. demonstrated great technical ability
on "Driver 8, Hie Flowers of Guatemala" and espe
cially on "Swan Swan H.," a piece that Peter Buck and
Mike Mills played on acoustic guitars.
R.E.M. is most noted for its obscure, often unintel
ligible, lyrics. Most of the lyrics are written by Stipe, who
seems to draw a lot of his inspiration from his interests
in primitivism, sound textures and common history or
folk lore. Jim Herbert, one of Stipe's former an teachers
at the University of Georgia, describes R.E.M.'s music as
"romantic, layered, somewhat diffused and having a cer
tain Southern ambience— Michael's lyrics touch on
that wet underside of the board that is the South. It's a
little bit squirmy and dark."
One of the concert's most memorable moments came
when Stipe brought a music stand onstage and read his
"pledge of allegiance." Some of the key points to his
creed were as follows: "I pledge allegiance to the flag,
not the real flag, but the flag I made ... to the ground I
stand on and nothing else ... to Dr. Seuss for inspiring a
creative, hallucinatory childhood I pledge allegiance
to trains."
As the "personality" of the band, Stipe maintained a
persona that some might find off-putting but that R.E.M.'s
fans found fascinating. His flashes of aloofness were
dwarfed by the transfigurative effects of the music on
everyone present. Out of consideration for those who
had waited in the rain for the cancelled show, Stipe and
Buck did a nice acoustic rendering of "So. Central Rain,"
with Stipe chanting throughout, "I'm sorry!" He needn't
have worried. R.E.M. was clearly forgiven.
