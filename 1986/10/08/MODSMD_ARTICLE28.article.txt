## CPPC: It's not just for job-seeking seniors 
### STEVEN LURIE Editorial staff 
Do you picture the Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter (CPPC) as a place where only seniors flock when they ex
perience the real-world-is-suddenly-around-the-corner
blues? If so, then you should drop into the CPPC, located on
White Plaza between the Stanford Bookstore and the School
of Education.
Under the new leadership of Director Ruth Schneider,
the CPPC is continuing its tradition of offering important
services and resources, and an increasing number of
services are being extended to students who are not
seniors.
The CPPC's services and resources can be divided into
two categories: those for students needing full-time employ
ment and those catering to the needs of any student inter
ested in identifying and realizing their goals.
"The most important service provided by the CPPC is
one-to-one counseling," Schneider said. Counselors are
available to students to help clarify career goals or just to an
swer general life questions. Regarding academic and career
goals, experienced counselors will help students find re
sources and organize a job search. Also, peer counselors are
available on an appointment or drop-in basis.
Another popular CPPC service is what students affec
tionately label the "fun tests." PACE, the Program for Assess
ment and Career Exploration, offers students and alumni
the chance to learn about themselves and their career
preferences through the latest in career assessment and
evaluation tests.
More than 650 Stanford students have participated in the
program since it was started two years ago. The two major
tests offered are the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory and
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.
Strong-Campbell features 325 questions asking whether
students like, dislike, or are indifferent to various career and
occupation titles. Myers-Briggs offers basic personality as

sessments (i.e., thinking or feeling) based on 126 questions
about social attitudes, hobbies and work habits. Students fill
out tests and later meet with counselors in order to get and
discuss the results.
The CPPC offers many services to those students seeking
summer internships as a way to acquire exposure to a given
career field. Internships can be paid, for academic credit, or
a combination of both and are offered in every imaginable
field from ecology to public service.
Students can discover about internships through four
basic methods. Odyssey, a special database, can quickly
search for jobs by region, city or field of interest. Odyssey
terminals are located at the CPPC and on the second floor of
Meyer Library. The Career Resource Library — with those
big red binders at the CPPC — contains hundreds of listings.
The Summer Recruiting Program attracts about 30 organiza
tions that conduct on-campus interviews. Finally, the Sum
mer Job Open House is an annual winter quarter event
where professionals describe their responsibilities and give
advice on how to enter the field.
The CPPC staff is continually working to upgrade the lists
of job opportunies. For example, Karen Mcintosh of the
CPPC's counseling staff headed a resource mailing project
that increased the number of internship listings this year by
33 percent.
The job listing board is a much used CPPC feature.
Employers from all over the Stanford area post cards de
scribing their needs. Offers range from student-run com
panies to housewives needing gardeners and baby sitters.
The 200 to 250 job listings include temporary and part- and
full-time jobs.
Stanford's Career Planning and Placement Center offers
much more than interviews for nervous seniors in coats and
ties. The CPPC can provide all students with, as a staff" mem
ber describes, "a feel for what is out there."
Counseling, self-evaluation tests and internship listings
are designed to help students identify and realize their
goals.
