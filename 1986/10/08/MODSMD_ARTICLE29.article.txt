## Stanford beats Davis, improves mark to .500 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff Writer 
"It is important for us to have mo
mentum going into the St. Mary's
match," said Stanford men's soccer
coach Sam Koch earlier this week.
He got his wish. The Cardinal soccer
team traveled to UC-Davis and
defeated the Aggies 2-0. In moving to
5-5-2 on the season, the Cardinal
defeated an Aggie team that was
ranked 12th nationally in Division 11.

The loss dropped the Aggies to 8-4.
Both the Stanford goals came in the
second half. Forward Chris Porch
scored the first with an assist from Ross
Torres at the 58-minute mark. The
second was tallied by midfielder Mike
Mossmer at the 72-minute mark on an
unassisted shot.
"We've been waiting for Chris Porch
to produce. He's starting to come
through and put the ball in the net. He
has a lot of potential and a lot of work
ahead of him," Koch said.

The Cardinal labored through in
tense heat and fatigue in the first half.
The exhaustion left many players in the
locker room at halftime wondering ex
actly why they had made the more than
2-hour bus ride to face the Aggies. In
keeping Stanford even in the trying
first half, goalie Tom Austin stayed hot
with four saves in the game. He now
has 51 on the season and a goals
against average of 1.25.

Men's soccer raised its record to 5-5-2 with a 2-0 win over UC-Davis on the road yesterday. Senior midfielder Mike
Mossmer (8) scored the second goal of the game unassisted for his second goal of the year. The victory was the second
straight for the Cardinal.
"The heat didn't help us. Vie played
everybody. The players hadn't sweated
that much all week. Tom Austin made a
couple key saves in the first halt to
keep us in the game," Koch said.
"They (Davis) moved the ball well
and had a very strong midfield. They
one-touched the ball very well, but just
couldn't finish it off. We picked up our
marks in the second halt and they tired
because they used very few subs.'
The Cardinal fired 10 shots at Davis
goalie Boh Daugherty, who recorded
only one save in the game. The Aggies
wound up with seven shots on goal
In the deciding second half, reserves
Jeff Rona, Dave Kang and Jim Killfoil
came oft the bench in the second half
and played extremely well

Stanford has put together impressive
back to back non-conference wins
over Westmont and now Davis, vault
ing the team back to the .500 mark.
These victories came after tough losses
to I CLA and Washington, the latter in
overtime. Both were suffered in the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships
last week.
The two wins give the Cardinal —
which has been decimated by injuries
and hurt by graduation — much
needed confidence as they begin con
ference play here Oct. IS against St.
Man's.
'St. Mary's is a big game for us It we
continue to play as we are, we'll be in
good shape. We've improved a great
deal on defense. We still have room for
improvement, but we're playing better.
They have more confidence in their
play. We learned we could play with
the top teams in the country at the Pac
-10 Tournament,' said Koch.
