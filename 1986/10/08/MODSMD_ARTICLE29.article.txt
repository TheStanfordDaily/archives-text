## Stanford beats Davis, improves mark to .500 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff Writer 
"It is important for us to have mo
mentum going into the St. Mary's
match," said Stanford men's soccer
coach Sam Koch earlier this week.
He got his wish. The Cardinal soccer
team traveled to UC-Davis and
defeated the Aggies 2-0. In moving to
5-5-2 on the season, the Cardinal
defeated an Aggie team that was
ranked 12th nationally in Division 11.

The loss dropped the Aggies to 8-4.
Both the Stanford goals came in the
second half. Forward Chris Porch
scored the first with an assist from Ross
Torres at the 58-minute mark. The
second was tallied by midfielder Mike
Mossmer at the 72-minute mark on an
unassisted shot.
"We've been waiting for Chris Porch
to produce. He's starting to come
through and put the ball in the net. He
has a lot of potential and a lot of work
ahead of him," Koch said.

The Cardinal labored through in
tense heat and fatigue in the first half.
The exhaustion left many players in the
locker room at halftime wondering ex
actly why they had made the more than
2-hour bus ride to face the Aggies. In
keeping Stanford even in the trying
first half, goalie Tom Austin stayed hot
with four saves in the game. He now
has 51 on the season and a goals
against average of 1.25.
