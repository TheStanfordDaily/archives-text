# Card fans in the stands: apathetic or acceptable?
## 
### 
In the seventh grade, I took part in a fierce "touch" foot
ball league. We talked tough, ran post-patterns. Some ate
gravel for vitamins. Through it all, I endured every kind of
46-flex, red-dog blitz and other sordid, unmentionable
maneuvers.
To say the least, it was a competitive league; everyone was
bent on making that spectacular play. Then one day, some
one went too far.

Amid the din of pre-pubescent "alligator" incantations, I
watched with both horror and some amusement as my next
door neighbor attempted the diving catch. He squealed not
from the unmitigated joy of having caught the ball, but
rather from the searing pain. After all, it was asphalt.
At the time, I truly commiserated with the dull-witted
lout. In retrospect though, I realize that this cement-loving
ignoramus broke a cardinal sin in sports etiquette: never
over-hustle or over-dramatize on adverse playing condi
tions. Namely, don't dive dumb, and of course, don't drive
drunk.
That stated, it's appropriate (I think) to tie this all together
with the partisan Stanford faithful — that endearing morass
of sun-baked limbs on the sunny side of the stadium and
life.
No one has mistaken us as a collective body determined
to dive headlong on cement for the sake of the Cardinal
team, America or mom. In fact, sometimes the most enthusi-

asm we can muster is ambivalence that, I suppose, isn't en
it o|l
People perpetually complain about our inability to
levitate off our hinders in gusto to cheer on the Stanford
Cardinal. Heaven forbid, there wasn't one "Spartanbuster"
poster among the crowd. The shame, the tragedy.
Still, I insist that we're not all bad as Cardinal rooters.
Sure, we bring our suntan oil. Sometimes we do miss that
15-yard completion because of an errant Frisbee. An oc
casional brewski? Why yes, but of course. Some years past, it
was a necessary local anesthetic. Now, we 11... let's just say it
staves off dehydration.
Our ways as fans are more subtle. We jingle keys — a
thoroughly pompous and downright obnoxious ritual of
snobbery. It works, we're 4-0. We have dorms that inspire
the team onward with renditions of "My Generation" and
"Satisfaction" on kazoos.
We pay tribute to past games, raising our arms in mock
touchdown demonstration to commemorate the infamous
touchdown call (not "the play" but an earlier referee non
call) in the 1982 Big Game.
And then, when the time seems right, we actually do rise
up to offer loud praise and congratulations.
Indeed, we're much better fans than the cementheads at
other schools. At Texas A&M, the students pay for seats only
to stand the entire game, as if to prove to the world that they
are more bipedal than the rest of us. Sounds like a complex
to me.
At Georgia, everyone barks after a good play. They don't
howl, but actually bark like canines. Oh I don't know, maybe
we ought to do the same. We could moo. Whale noises?
California fans do something really zany. They throw
oranges at the Band. It's a strange thing — a fetish with fruit.
Try to understand, they're a bit unstable.
So at the Huskie game, sit back, enjoy your Meisterbrau
and revel in knowing that Stanford fans don't worship con
crete.
