# Angels defeat Red Sox 8-1
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — Mike Witt
pitched a five-hitter and the Califor
nia Angels jolted Boston ace Roger
Clemens for four runs in the second
inning last night to beat the Red Sox
8-1 in the first game of the American
League playoffs.
Clemens, pitching for the first
time since being struck on the right
elbow by a line drive last week,
could not find his rhythm early on
the clear, 50-degree night.
Brian Downing drove in four runs
for the Angels who scored more
runs against Clemens than any team
this year. They pounded him for 10
hits and eight runs, seven earned, in
seven 1-3 innings.

Witt, meanwhile, flirted with the
first no-hitter in playoff history, hold
ing the Red Sox hitless for five 2-3 in
nings before Wade Boggs beat out an
infield chopper for a single. The hit
broke a string of 16 straight batters
retired by Witt after walking Boggs,
the major-league batting champion,
leading off the first.
When Boggs got his hit, however,
Witt and the Angels had the game in
control and they coasted the rest of
the way in the opener of the best-of
seven series. Game 2 was scheduled
for 3:05 p.m. EDT today.
Clemens, the most dominant
pitcher in baseball this season with a
24-4 record including a 3-0 mark
against the Angels, came out throw

ing hard with fastballs exceeding 95
mph. He escaped a two-on, two-out
jam in the first inning by retiring
Doug DeCinces on a drive to the
center-field wall, and opened the
second by easily striking out Rob
Wilfong and Dick Schofield.
But then Clemens; averaging just
over two walks per game this season,
suddenly ran into trouble. He
walked Bob Boone on a 3-1 pitch
and narrowly missed on a full-count
delivery to Gary Pettis.
Ruppert Jones followed with a line
single up the middle and rookie
Wally Joyner, who had doubled in
the first inning, sliced an RBI double
into left field that made it 2-0.
After Clemens threw ball one to
Brian Downing, Red Sox pitching
coach Bill Fischer walked hurriedly to
the mound to talk with his struggling
ace. As soon as the visit was over and
Sammy Stewart began warming u|">,
Downing lined a two-run single into
the left-field corner.
By the time Clemens finished strik
ing out Reggie Jackson, he had thrown
45 pitches in the second inning and
had been rocked for four runs in an in
ning for only the second time this
season.

While the crowd of 32,993 sat in
stunned silence, the Angels scored
again in the third. Shortstop Spike
Owen made a high throw for an error
on Wilfong's one-out grounder, and
singles by Boone and Pettis increased
the lead to 5-0. Pettis had been 0-for-9
against Clemens until the hit.
NX itt, given a big cushion, breezed
through a Boston batting order that
had only a collective .178 average
against him in his career. The 6-foot-7
right-hander was 18-10 this season, yet
was only 1-2 against the Red Sox
despite a 2.66 ERA against them.
Clemens had settled down in the
middle innings and retired 13 of 1-4
batters before the Angels knocked him
out in the eighth.
