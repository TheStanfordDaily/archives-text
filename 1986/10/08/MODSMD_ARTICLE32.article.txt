## Cardinal to take on talented USF squad 
### ED STACKLER 
It should be an evenly matched and
exciting game today as the young Stan
lord women's soccer team faces a
freshman "Pele from the north. The
Cardinal will face the University of San
Francisco Lady Dons and their scoring
sensation, Shanna Haines.
Haines, one of three soccer players
in Southern California last year to win
a prestigious Pele Scholarship, is
known to be extremely effective in free
kicks and corner kicks.
The records of both Stanford and
USF this year have left much to be
desired. The Cardinal has posted only
one win this season, against Rhode Is
land two weeks ago. They have tied
one game and lost the other five to
bring their record to 15-1.
Similarly, the Lad\ Dons have won
only one game in this season, the
second year of existence for the pro
gram. Their one victory was a bright
spot in their season, however, as they
upset Cal State-Havward, the third
ranked team in the country at the time.
It is the unpredictability of the Lady
Dons in general, and the scoring threat
of Shanna I laines in particular, that will
pose a threat to the Cardinal.

The general strategy, according to
Stanford Head Coach Helen Keohane,
is to "score a couple of goals and get
on top and keep tabs on the danger
ous Haines, who has already scored six
goals this season.
According to Keohane, Haines was
actually being recruited by Stanford
last spring to play soccer. Eventually,
she chose USF and did not complete
her Stanford application.
The Cardinal's offense is very capa
ble and evenly distributed. "Any of our
four to six girls on the front can score,"
said Keohane.
Freshman midfielder Tonya An
tonucci leads the Cardinal in scoring
with two goals. She is accompanied by
a strong offensive lineup that includes
Manda Dunlop, Amy Geisse and
Christy McDevitt, who each have
scored one goal.
Shanna Haines and the Lady Dons
will find getting the ball past Cardinal
goalkeeper Vija Brookshire no easy
task. Brookshire is allowing only 1.57
goals per game this season and is a
proven team leader on the field.
A victory today will be an important
confidence builder for the winner, and
this game could be a needed rallying
