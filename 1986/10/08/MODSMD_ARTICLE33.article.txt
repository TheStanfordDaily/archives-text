# Soccer faces graduation losses, injuries
## 
### ALICIA KENT 
Until this Saturday, a season of ups and dowas and injur
ies and illness has controlled the men's soccer team.
However, with its 1-0 win over Westmont College Satur
day, the team has begun a rebuilding process, trying to im
prove its record of 4-5-2.
Labeling this season as a building year," Stanford Head
Coach Sam Koch was prepared to recoastruct a team to rival
last year's 2nd place team. However, Koch did not foresee
the unusually high number of injuries that plagued the
players.
Its frustrating when you lose that many players. Almost
every guy on the raster was hit by the flu or had a bad twist
(of the ankle)," said Koch.
Team co-captain Pat Sheehy, who played mid-fielder, has
been out with an ankle stress fracture for a month and a half,
along with team co-captain Neal Stephens, a full-back, who
has missed a week and a half of play because of a bronchial
infection.
Starters Tim Westergreen and Brian Mahaffey, both
juniors, were forced to miss much of the season because of
stress fractures. Sophomore Luke Garrott, a starting for
ward, has also missed league play due to a sprained ankle
injury.
Sophomores Chris Dechet, Juan Garcia and Jim Killfoil
and junior Jerry Maldonado were ill during tournament

travel in Seattle, Portland and San Diego. Freshman Chris
Helling suffered problems with a bad knee while sopho
more Chris Illick suffered problems with blisters.
Sophomore Mike Meyers pulled a hamstring and senior
Mike Mossmer has suffered pulled stomach muscles, al
though both have been able to play in league action. In ad
dition, several players, including Kevin Woodhouse, have
ankle injuries that have affected their play.
It is unusual for one team to experience such a high num
ber of injuries. At a loss for an answer as to why his team was
afflicted with this bad luck, Koch said, "I'm not that religi
ous; maybe that's why we've had such bad luck. Maybe the
team doesn't drink enough milk. 1 can't really guess why this
has happened â€” bad breaks, maybe."
Yet Koch does not feel that team injuries are the only
thing responsible for the mediocre team record. "The injur
ies have not helped us, but in some games we just didn't
play well," he said.
He attributes much of the team's non-win games to men
tal frustrations. "Mentally we have to be ready. When we
step onto the field, we decide our own fate," Koch said.
The temporary loss of team leaders and starters has been
frustrating for the team as a whole. "It's tough when you're
missing your key people. If we could keep the same inten
sity level, we could really do well," freshman midfielder Jeff
Rona said.
With many of last year's top players graduated and much

of this year's team injured, the team is made of younger, less
experienced players. "We've had to pull together because
we have so many new guys. The injuries haven't helped
either," senior Dave Rang said.
But this situation has made it possible for more of the
players to put in playing time. Kang hadn't expected to play
much this year; at this point in the season, however, his
average game time has been half the game.
In addtion to more playing time for the younger players,
the team has worked together as a unit to fight the loss of
key players. Kang pointed out that the team has worked
harder than ever for one another. "Team unity is the best its
ever been," agrees team captain Sheehy.
Stephens, also a team captain, noticed the increased en
thusiasm of the new players. "They all want to play, so they
come out and play hard. They respect the coach and they lis
ten," Stephens said.
The need for more starters and consistent players has
helped motivate the younger players. Koch has noticed a
competition among the players that he feels motivates them
to fight for starting positions.
"People are fighting. If a spot opens up, there is always
someone to fill it," said the injured Mahaffey.
Mark Semioli and Chris Porch, both mid-fielders, have
proven their strength in filling key starting positions and
have gained experience with more playing time. Ross

Torres, Deckett, Garcia and Jerry Maldonado have also
strengthened the team.
This competition has been a plus for the new players, but
it has been frustrating for the injured players. "1 don't like
sitting on the bench. It's frustrating. I'm a leader by action,
so of course I'd rather be playing,'' said Sheehy.
When the injured players return, Koch has insisted that
they earn their spots in the starting lineup. "You lose your
touch on the ball when you don't play. It's just not the same
when you try to keep in shape on the side lines," said Koch.
For Mahafiy, Saturday was his first game returning from
his injury. "I was kind of nervous, just coming back is hard.
But I did the best I could," he said.
Stephens, who Koch feels has regained about 95 percent
of his skill, said that after playing in three games he is finally
beginning to feel good about his game and his touch on the
ball.
As for future games, Koch sees Sheehy and hopefully
more key players playing at 100 percent by games against
the University of Nevada-Las Vegas or Fresno State. Koch
predicts that the addition of returning players can only help
the intra-team competition and will strengthen the team as a
unit.
He is optimistic about the team's skills. "They are a good
group of kids. I feel if they they are ready to play when they
come on the field and know they have to win, they can beat
anyone," Koch said.
