# New prize honors teaching excellence
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
An annual faculty prize honoring excellence in under
graduate instruction at Stanford is now possible due to a gift
commitment of $600,000 by Laurance Hoagland of Saint
Louis, Mo.
The first such award aimed specifically at exceptional un
dergraduate teaching, the Laurance and Naomi Carpenter
Hoagland Prize is expected to provide a substantial boost
toward improving the quality of Stanford undergraduate
education — one of the University's main goals for the cen
tennial years.
"The award will keep attention on undergraduate educa
tion," said Dean of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn Lougee.
Hoagland made the gift, an endowment for the award, to
express appreciation for the undergraduate education he
and many of his family members have received at Stanford.
The winner of the Hoagland prize will be paid for one
academic quarter during which he or she will lie given sub
stantial creative license in developing ways to improve un
dergraduate education at Stanford, according to Lougee,

who announced the news of the prize Friday at the Junior
Convocation.
Chosen faculty members can tackle projects — such as
developing a new course, revising an existing course or
leading a field research project — in working toward the
betterment of undergraduate studies.
"Hopefully, the award will provide a focal point in honor
ing undergraduate education. It's the only prize the Univer
sity has that specifically honors undergraduate teaching,'
Lougee said.
Income from the initial gift will insure that at least one
Hoagland prize will be awarded each year at the Junior Con
vocation.
The prize will complement existing faculty honors — the
Dean's and Gores awards for undergraduate and graduate
teaching excellence and the Dinkelspiel award for general
contributions to undergraduate education.
Lougee said the recipients of the award will normally be
tenured professors early in their teaching careers and are
expected "to provide a model for teaching" that the Univer
sity can "hold up to be emulated" by other instructors.
The first Laurance and Naomi Carpenter Hoagland Prize
will be awarded 1987-88.
