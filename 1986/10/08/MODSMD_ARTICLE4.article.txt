# Letter assails seat-saving
## 
### ANDREW PATZMAN Staff writer 
Citing disturbances at Saturday's Stanford-San Diego State
footbali game, University officials yesterday sent a letter to
resident assistants asking students to "stop the practice of
trying to reserve a block of seats for other house residents
who come later."
According to the letter, signed by Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyoas and Director of Athletics Andy Geiger, "if resi
dential or other groups want to sit together they must show
up together."
Lyons and Geiger's letter names three "problems associ
ated with this practice (of saving seats)."
• Individual students and small groups "have been sub
jected to the worst kind of threats, intimidation and bully
tactics by the 'seat-savers,' " specifically large dorms and fra
ternities.
• Students lining up outside the stadium the night before a
game have "occasionally resulted in calls to the police about
drunkenness, fighting and difficulties associated with the
many high school students who join the party."
• "When the gates opened last Saturday, the surge by those
in line (some of whom were very drunk) and the subse
quent race to the stands resulted in some minor injuries."
Although the letter states that the University plans to "re
emphasize" its long-standing policy of "first-come, first
serve" seating, it includes no enforcement measures.
"It's just a request to keep order in the student section of
the stadium," Geiger said of the letter. "It's a plea for sanity."
"I don't think it's workable," junior Lori Abert said of
plan. "Coming out of the blue like this, students are going to
resist." She predicted that the Stanford-Washington game
this weekend "is going to be a disaster..., There's going to
be hostility."
Abert, who has spoken to Lyoas and Geiger about her

concerns, said she fears a ban on saving seats will "triple or
quadruple ' the number of students who camp out at the
stadium and then scramble for seats when the gate opens.
Eric Jacobsen, president of the Kappa Alpha fraternity,
agreed. "What this means is that the whole house is going to
have to be there (at the gate)," he said. "It's going to be a
worse rampage than ever running in there."
Geiger said yesterday that the Athletic Department plans
to "set up a queue" in front of the student entrance to the
stadium in order to minimize "the mob scene" at the gate.
"The First one to get there will be number one, and so on,"
he explained.
The Athletic Department will manage the queue for the
game this weekend, but "would dearly love to turn this over
to students," Geiger said.
According to Lyons, seating at games should be "a matter
of student self-enforcement."
"If students want to impose a system themselves, I'll sup
port it," Geiger said.
Lyons noted that students in the past have made attempts
to set up a system to make group seating arrangements
before football games. But he said "by the time anything got
done, it was the end of the season."
Madera House Resident Assistant Ashley David said one of
the reasons why students rush to save seats at games is that
"the student section is kind of small."
According to Geiger, however, as of last weekend only
4,305 season tickets had been sold for a total of 8,448 stu
dent seats at the stadium. "The problem is that people sit on
top of each other," he said.
"I think block seating is great," Geiger said, "but so is or
der in the stands."
Lyons said "disturbances" at last Saturday's game in
cluded "cases of heat exhaustion combined with dainke-
ness.
He also said students at the game
had told him of "drunken brawling" by
"a group of what we'd have to call ex-
DUs." No ex-DU members could be
reached for comment.

Geiger declined to discuss details of
the disturbances.
He predicted that the letter's request
for "fairness" would be heeded by stu
dents. "I go on the assumption that
Stanford is a terrific place and is pop
ulated by terrific people," he said.
Jacobsen praised Lyons and Geiger
for "asking people to be nice and not
sending in the police or something."
