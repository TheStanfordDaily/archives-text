# Stanford divests Shamrock stock
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Stanford yesterday announced its
largest divestment action to date — the
sale of 30,600 shares of Diamond
Shamrock Corp. valued at about
$350,000.
Upon learning of Stanford's deci
sion. Diamond Shamrock told the Uni
versity it will withdraw from South
Africa by Dec. 1, according to Univer
sity Treasurer Rodney Adams. Until
now, the Texas-based oil and gas com
pany has neglected to set a firm date
for concluding the sale of its South
African subsidiary.
The Board of Trustees voted in May
to sell its Diamond Shamrock holdings
if the company had not sold its South
African subsidiary by Oct. 1.
Adams interpreted Diamond Sham
rock's establishment of a firm sale date
to be an indication of the effectiveness
of Stanford's divestment process.
"They were accepting of the action,
and I found it significant that they
called us (yesterday) — after we'd
taken action, Adams said. According
to a Treasurer's Office memo issued by
Adams, Stanford's Diamond Shamrock
shares should be sold by Friday.
The decision to divest was made
Monday morning at University Presi
dent Kennedy weekly meeting with
top Stanford administrators, according
to Adams.
He said Kennedy made the decision
after consulting with Trustee
Gcrtther. rbaTrrrtan of rhe Board of
Trustees' Special Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility.

Kennedy did not return a phone call
yesterday afternoon to the President's
Office, and Diamond Shamrock could
not be reached for comment.
The decision apparently was delayed
until six days after the Trustees'
deadline because Diamond Shamrock
has a buyer for Diamond Shamrock
Africa, Ltd. The sale has yet to be
finalized, however, and Kennedy
decided that Diamond Shamrock had
received enough time, Adams said
"It took a little while for them (the
University vice presidents) to get to
gether and present the information to
Donald Kennedy," Adams said. "It's
good to make sure you've got your
facts straight."
Diamond Shamrock Chairman
William Bricker announced in April
that the subsidiary and its Simonstown
facility would be sold. At the time of
the Stanford trustees' decision, Dia
mond Shamrock said it expected to be
out of South Africa by Sept. 30.
On Sept. 15, the company told the
University that a South African com
pany had agreed to buy and that a
definitive agreement would be signed
"in short order," according to Univer
sity News Service. The companies are
reportedly negotiating the sale's legal
and financial fine points.
On Monday, the News Service re
ported, Diamond Shamrock said it
hoped to complete the sale by Dec. 1,
but indicated this was not firm.
Adams said Stanford's deliberate ac
had heard of the divestment decision
and confirmed that it would withdraw
from South Africa by Dec. 1, he said.
"I think a number of other univer
sities that sold their stock in a formula
manner probably had little effect (on
the companies involved)," Adams said.
"In some ways, it's the process that
counts."
The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) recommended
divesting from Diamond Shamrock last

May, when the University's stock was
valued at more than $500,000.
The CIR noted that the company had
not signed the Sullivan principles, was
not a member of the American Cham
ber of Commerce in South Africa or
any other organization working against
apartheid, and showed no prospects of
changing its actions in South Africa.
Stanford currently owns stocks
valued at $187 million in 65 South
Africa-related firms. Its total sharehold
ings are valued at about $1.5 billion. Its
only other divestment action came on
May 13 when the trustees voted to sell
$9,900 worth of stock in Newmont
Mining.
