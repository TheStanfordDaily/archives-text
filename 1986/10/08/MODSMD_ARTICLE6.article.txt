# Fac Sen nixes plan to revamp council
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Efforts to give the Academic Council
the power to effect legislation drew a
mostly skeptical reaction at last week's
Faculty Senate meeting.
Before 1968, when the Faculty' Sen
ate was created, the Academic Council
retained legislative power, but since
the creation of the senate, the Aca
demic Council has steadily declined in
significance.
A proposal by Mathematics Prof. Hal
sey Rovden that the council have the
power to initiate legislation with a mini
mum of 150 affirmative votes met with
only sparse support at the Faculty Sen
ate last Thursday.
"I'm not inclined to shift power to a
body that's too large and has a quorum
that's too small," said Tjeerd Van An
del, a professor of geology and human
biology.
The council includes 1,350 mem

bers of the Stanford professoriate, who
elect 55 representatives to the senate.
After 12 years of service on a similar
body in the UC system, Van Andel said
the Stanford Faculty Senate came as "a
great relief' to him.
The Faculty Senate has the final say
in matters ranging from admissions
policy, academic programs and curric
ulum, research policy and conferral of
degrees.
"We have for all practical purposes
abolished the council" by denying it
any "significant power," said English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz.
"While elected, this body is not
genuinely representative of the fac
ulty, Rebholz said. "People out there
are alienated. Most don't know who
represents their constituency."
Law Prof. John Kaplan — recalling
the "troubled times" of the late 1960s
— said the Academic Council failed as
a representative body during that per
iod.
At the Academic Council, prior to
the senate's creation, "the real issue
was who could get the troops there,"'
not the quality of arguments pre
sented, Kaplan said.
The Academic Council behaved
"very badly" because it was "so big and
so unwieldly, and so few people
showed up for important votes," he
said.
Since the senate's formation in the
fall of 1968, none of its decisions have
been reversed on appeal to the coun
cil.
Royden made the proposal in reac
tion to a senate steering committee's
suggestion last spring to abolish the
council, said Bob Beyers, information
officer for the senate.
Royden said: "We're in very quiet
times, so far as general affairs (of the
University) are concerned. These are
times when we should pay particular
attention to spelling out constitutional
procedures, in case we should ever be
back in times like the late 19605, when
passions were high. Debate in the Aca
demic Council can be very salutory in
giving everyone a chance to be heard."
"Turnout has been minimal (at Aca
demic Council meetings)," said
Beyers.
Industrial Engineering Prof. James
Adams said that discussion of issues in
the council was "very valid" but "the
idea that 10 percent (of all council
members) can pass something is scary
to me," he said.
He said Royden's proposal could al
low the domination of the Medical
School because of its large faculty.
Earlier in the meeting, Rebholz
charged that previous senate steering
committees had been "very stubborn
about putting matters on the agenda."
He said the faculty might welcome
more debate over such issues as South
African investment policy.
In the mid-'6os the late Education
Prof. Herbert Packer conceived the
idea of having a representative body of
faculty that evolved into the Faculty
Senate.
The Faculty Senate is different from
many similar governing bodies at
other universities, Beyers said, because
members are drawn from various dis
ciplines and schools.
Representation in the senate of a
certain graduate school or department
was determined by a compromise be
tween the size of the faculty and the
size of student enrollment, Beyers said.
