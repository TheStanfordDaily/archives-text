# Lyons: Stanford's housing diverse
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER 
The combination of the University's housing sys
tem and its emphasis on residentional education
makes the Stanford lifestyle distinctive from that of
other schools in the country, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said yesterday.
Speaking at a Mother's Club function, Lyons
stressed the importance of division in University
housing.
"The division of housing arrangements at Stanford
gives students the best of two worlds," he said.
The houses keep relations on a personal level, and
their arrangement into dormitories brings greater
services to students, Lyons explained. The residences
are "an area where Stanford is distinctive because of
what we try to do. There's a tremendous variety
here," he said.
This variety includes "*0 different organizations of
living units, each unit accomodating 34 to 238
people Food arrangements on campus also vary,
from independent cooking in trailers and apartments
to eating clubs, where students collectively plan
menus and buy their own food.
"There aren't many complaints about food be
cause if they don't like it they can go somewhere
else." Lyons told the mothers.
Lyons also praised the diversity of the houses
themselves. In addition to theme houses, which in
clude Black, Asian, Chicano and Native American,
.Stanford also has all-freshman dorms, four-class

dorms and upperclassmen-only dorms.
Currently, the University is trying to make this
housing system available to students each of their
four years, he said.
"We're working so that all undergraduates can live
here for four years," Lyons said, noting that under the
current system, students have only three years of
guaranteed campus housing.
Lyons also stressed the presence of a "hidden
agenda" at Stanford.
"When .students come here, they read what we say
in handbooks and catalogues. From the eyes of the
dean and the parent, 1 can comment on a hidden
agenda,' of which the most important is to make and
keep friends," he said.
"These (relationships) are very important, not
trivial, to the kids. A whole human agenda is based
on making friends," said Lyons.
In his speech, Lyons told the mothers some of the
questions their children are asking themselves as
freshmen, including: "Can 1 function in such a
rigorous environment?"
Lyons said that most freshmen ask themselves,
"How did I ever get in here?" And as juniors, they
ask, "How did he ever get in here?"
"Most of the students are coming from the top 10
percent of their class, so 90 percent will feel some
disappointment. This is the time to ask themselves
questions such as, Will I do history? Can I do his
tory?' " he said
Lyons said he feels college is the chance for stu

dents to experiment, and he explained that it is for
that reason that Stanford does not fail students.
"Like all research, you must he prepared for a
negative outcome," he said.
Another important aspect of college life is living
with a roommate, according to Lyons
"It's not a trivial question," he said, adding that a
student once came to him complaining that his
roommate liked to act out the Battle of Gettysburg in
their room. "There was a lot of learning going on
there," said Lyons.
Many students, most of whom come to college
never having shared a room with someone, are un
dergoing this important learning process for the first
time, Lyons said.
He also outlined a study that indicated a higher in
cidence of marital difficulties among those who had
lived alone or unhappily with another roommate in
college.
"Sometimes it's the little things with coping that
are important," Lyons said, citing as examples writing
checks and doing laundry
"It sounds like a simple thing, but learning to take
care of yourself is also important at Stanford," Lyons
said, noting that the Cowell Health Center devotes
half of its care to helping the students help them
selves.
"Vie increased the length of time of appointments
for students to ask questions about themselves. That s
