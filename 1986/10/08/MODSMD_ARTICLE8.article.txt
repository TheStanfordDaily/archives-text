Weinberger travels to Peking
PEKING — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger arrived in Peking
yesterday on the heels of Soviet officials who are seeking improved rela
tions with China. At the same time, a Chinese delegation was preparing to
leave for Washington and talks on military logistics.
And so, the secretary of defense finds his journey here sandwiched be
tween two sets of international meetings, each carrying symbolic signifi
cance for the triangular relationship of the United States, China and the So
viet Union.
Weinberger's visit comes at a time when U.S. relations with China —
economic, military and diplomatic — are at a crossroads, and the Soviet
Union is trying to improve its relations with China, which have been frozen
for more than two decades.
"We have a major chance with the Chinese," a senior State Department
official said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified by name.
According to a Pentagon source, Weinberger had hoped to announce
here that a U.S. Navy vessel was to call at a Chinese port for the first time
since the communists took power here in 1949. That was seen as a sym
bolic occasion that would call attention to the improvement in U.S.-
Chinese military ties.
Weinberger was not pleased, the Pentagon source said, when the
Chinese leaked word last month of the planned visit.
The Soviet Union's role in Asia continues to be a focal point, an issue
Weinberger referred to in a speech Saturday night in Anchorage, Alaska,
that raised the curtain on his 19-day global tour. But a U.S. expert on
Chinese affairs said Monday that "our overall relationship with China has
broadened considerably."
Committee cites security breach
WASHINGTON — The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said yes
terday that recently exposed spy cases have caused damage "far greater
than anyone in the U.S. government has yet acknowedged publicly" involv
ing "billioas of dollars of actual and potential damage to U.S. military pro
grams." But, the committee said, the U.S. government has a totally inade
quate counterintelligence program to combat "expanding hostile intelli
gence operations" against this country.
In a 141-page report on U.S. counterintelligence and security programs,
the committee said the government's intelligence agencies — with differ
ing missions and needs — are refusing to cooperate fully with each other.
"Our committee found a security system paralyzed by bureaucratic iner
tia, with little ability to bridge the gaps between agencies or between differ
ent security disciplines like personnel security and computer security,"
Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.), the committee chairman, said.
There are "too many secrets, too much access to secrets, too many spies
... and too little effort given to combating the very real threat which spies
represent to our national security," he said.
The report called upon the Reagan administration to draw up a "national
counterintelligence strategy" that would establish national objectives and
integrate the planning and resources of the various agencies involved in
counterintelligence. It suggested that the National Security Council, which
operates an Interagency Group for Counterintelligence under Federal
Bureau of Investigation Director William Webster, be given responsibility
for devising and carrying out the strategy.
The committee carried out its 16-month review in cooperation with the
administration, which is expected to release its report next week and to in
clude many of the same recommendations, Durenberger said.
Laßouche vows to resist arrest
WASHINGTON — Political extremist Lyndon Laßouche, his inner circle
penetrated by indictments and a sweeping federal fraud investigation,
declared yesterday that "I have committed no crime" and "will not submit
passively to an arrest."
Laßouche, who was not indicted, responded to the charges against 10 of
his followers and five of his organizations by saying the Reagan administra
tion will be "condemned by history" if federal prosecutors seek to charge
him after a massive raid seeking records at his headquarters in Leesburg,
Va.
"I will not submit passively to an arrest, but in such a scenario I will
defend myself," Laßouche said in a statement read by Warren Hamerman,
head of National Democratic Policy Committee.
Laßouche's statement was described as "a personal message" to Presi
dent Reagan. Laßouche also charged that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
"demanded my head, as a price" for the Iceland summit with Reagan this
weekend.
Laßouche, a frequent fringe candidate for president who says he is run
ning again in 1988, espouses bizarre theories of global conspiracy involv
ing the Queen of England, international drug traffickers, the Soviet KGB
and prominent Americans.
He also blamed the raids, which involved nearly 400 police and federal
investigators, on White House chief of staff Donald Regan and Asst. Attor
ney General-designate William Weld, formerly the U.S. attorney in Boston,
where the federal investigation of Laßouche's organization began.
Pope concludes visit to France
LYON, France — Pope John Paul II ended his four-day visit to France yes
terday on the same theme that he began it, expressing hope for an end to
the threat of terrorist violence that prompted his hosts to mount an un
precedented security shield around him.
Shortly after his arrival for an arduous tour of rhe basilicas of this south
eastern region of France, the pope prayed for an end to violence and called
on terrorists, guerilla groups and warring governments to observe at least a
one-dav cease fire on October 27 when he has called a "world day of
prayer,"
Yesterday, after a hai: Mjr airport meeting with French Prime Minister
Jacques Chirac, the pontiu . rain asked that "France know the peace to
which it has a right, that it be sheltered from troubles of international ter
rorism. which should be denounced by all of humanity, by states and by in
ternational organizations."
John Paul also had a private talk with French President Francois Mit
terand immediately after his arrival in Lyon Saturday, and according to a
French government spokesman, the two discussed terrorism and the fate
of eight French hostages in Lebanon. Vatican spokesman Dr. Joaquin
Navarro-Valls said that the pope would not comment on his talks with the
two French leaders.
Kohl hopeful for new detente
BONN, West Germany — Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a keynote speech
yesterday to the Christian Democratic party convention in Mainz, said that
the superpower summit meeting in Iceland this weekend could produce a
new East-West detente.
Kohl said that the summit meeting will also advance the cause of arms
control, a pressing issue in West Germany.
He said that he saw hope for a new East-West accord not only in connec
tion with the summit meeting in Iceland but also because of Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's "reformist policies.
"These policies contain risks," he said, "but also chances, which could
lead to more understanding and cooperation and, above all, to important
new results in arms control and disarmament."
Kohl promised members of his party that the Christian Democrats would
be successful in the Jan. 25 national election, and that they would stay in
power for four more years. But he warned against overconfidence and
urged his listeners to make sure of a strong turnout on election day.
Public opinion polls show the Christian Democrats running comfortably
ahead of the opposition Social Democrats. Thus the Christian Democratic
Union — the party's formal name — and their Bavarian allies, the Christian
Social Union, could team up again with the Liberal Free Democrats to
ensure another term for the center-right coalition now in power.
