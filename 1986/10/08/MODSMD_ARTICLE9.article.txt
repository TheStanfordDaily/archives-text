Managua claims it shot down an American plane

MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The Nicaraguan govern
ment charged yesterday that the United States was re
sponsible for the flight of a cargo plane said to have
been downed Sunday by Nicaraguan troops, and an
American who survived the crash said that he
boarded the downed aircraft, a C 123 cargo plane, in
El Salvador.
All others aboard the plane — two Americans and
a Nicaraguan — were killed, according to Nicaraguan
authorities.
The survivor, Eugene Hasenfus, was allowed to
speak briefly to local journalists in the port of San
Carlos, near the crash site, The Associated Press re
ported. Hasenfus said he was an aviation specialist
but did not indicate whether he was in the military or
a civilian.
He did not describe the plane's cargo or the pur
pose of the flight. The Nicaraguan Defense Ministry
said yesterday that Soviet-made weapons and am
munition had been recovered from the wreckage
and charged that the plane had been on a mission to
"resupply the anti-Sandinista rebels, known as con
tras, before it was shot down."
Hasenfus said the flight began in Miami, picked
him up in El Salvador, then went to Honduras where
it picked up a Nicaraguan and entered Nicaraguan air
space from Costa Rica at a site called La Noca, the
news agency reported.

Hasenfus said the Nicaraguan was among the three
who died in the crash. Military officers who accompa
nied him said the other two killed were Americans
whom they identified as Wallace Blaine Sawger Jr.
and Bill Cooper.
Earlier U.S. embassies in Central
America denied that Hasenfus and the three
reportedly killed had any direct links to the U.S. gov
ernment.
"It is clear to us this flight was part of the escalation
of the United States war against us," Angela Saballos,
spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry,
charged.
The official newspaper of the ruling Sandinista
Party, Barricada, said yesterday that the aircraft is
"proof of the open participation of the United States
in a war of aggression against Nicaragua."
Nicaragua's Defense Ministry said last night that
the camouflage-painted plane was downed Sunday
afternoon with a Soviet-made rocket fired by Sandi
nista infantrymen in Nicaragua's southeastern
jungles, about 30 miles north of the Costa Rican bor
der.
Last night the ministry said Hasenfus identified
himself to troops capturing him as a U.S. military ad
viser serving in El Salvador.
In El Salvador, the U.S Embassy said that Hasenfus
"is not pan of the U.S. military group here. He has no

links with the U.S. Embassy. We don't know who he
is."
An embassy official said by telephone from San
Salvador that the U.S. coasul there reported no U.S.
personnel were missing yesterday. One embassy offi
cial speculated that Hasenfus had claimed to work in
El Salvador under pressure from Nicaraguan inter
rogators.
In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, a spokesman for the
U.S.-backed contras said by telephone that all his
groups' aircraft were accounted for and undamaged
"in their airports."
Carlos Icaza of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force
(FDN), the largest contra army with an estimated
14,000 guerrillas, said no FDN members were aboard
the crashed plane.
Icaza said the FDN sometimes accepts aid, includ
ing assistance with air resupply of its field fighters,
from private volunteers. But he said that in recent
weeks no private group made any attempt to coor
dinate such assistance with the FDN.
In Nicaragua, an Army helicopter flew several
foreign television crews and photographers to the
rain-soaked jungle site of the crash at midday yester
day, the Defense Ministry confirmed.
The Army spokeswoman said Hasenfus is likely to
undergo interrogation.
