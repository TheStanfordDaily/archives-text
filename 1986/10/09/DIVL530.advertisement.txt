Korean Air Lines
Flight 007
a lecture, open to the public without charge, by
Seymour M. Hersh 1
The Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist's new book,
The Target is Destroyed, reveals what the Russians knew—and
didn't know—when their missile destroyed a civilian airliner

American intelligence and the Reagan administration, and the
implications for international security.
