"If everyone over 50 had
checkups for colorectal

high as 75%," says Dr. LaSalle D.
Leffall, Jr., past president,
American Cancer Society. "You
can 't cure it if you don't know
you have it." But if it's detected
early, the cure rate for colorectal
cancer is very high. Your doctor
can perform the digital and
proctoscopic exams, and you
take care of the simple stool
blood test at home.
Since men and women arc
equally affected by this disease,
we urge everyone over 50 to get
regular checkups.
The warning signs for
colorectal cancer are a change in
bowel habits and blood in the
stool.
People with a family history of
colon or rectal cancer or
ulcerative colitis are at higher
risk and are urged to be doubly
cautious.
Checkup Guidelines for
men and women over 50
without symptoms:
• digital exam annually

No one faces
cancer alone.
