# Budget concerns plague Reagan

### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
and House Democrats reached an im
passe on arms-control issues yesterday
that threatened to shut down the
federal government shortly before the
president meets with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in Iceland on Satur
day.
Reagan, in a letter to House Majority
Leader Jim Wright (D-Texas), rejected
as unacceptable a proposed compro
mise by the Democrats to delay until
early next year the resolution of their
differences on arms control. Instead,
he called on Democrats to abandon
House-passed legislation that would
put new restraints on U.S. arms policy.
"I cannot be forced by the Congress
to accept language that restricts our
bargaining position at the negotiating
table," the president said. "We must
not send a message to the Soviets that
could be construed as an incentive to
delay undertaking serious discussions
now because of a belief that they could
get a better deal from Congress later."
In response, Wright said that while
House Democrats were willing to com

promise with the president to avoid an
embarrassing confrontation immedi
ately before the summit, they were un
willing to completely surrender to his
position.
"We've gone the second mile
We've turned the other cheek, we've
handed the olive branch, we've done
everything but give away the store, and
he wants us to give away the store,"
Wright said. "The American people un
derstand that this is not a dictatorship."
He said the Democrats would settle
for as little as "a nod" from the presi
dent that he does not intend to violate
the 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty later this year, as he has threat
ened to do, but that Reagan refused to
make any such concession to
Congress.
The dispute threatened to block pas
sage of an omnibus spending bill to
fund the government beyond midnight
tomorrow. The House-passed arms
control measures, which are provi
sions for legislation funding the
government for the remainder of the

fiscal year, would continue a ban on
testing of anti-satellite weapons, limit
production of chemical weapons, re
quire Reagan to abide by the unratified
SALT II treaty and halt all testing of nu
clear weapons if the Soviets allow the
U.S. to verify their current test ban.
Reagan argued that such measures
would unfairly tie his hands in talks
with Gorbachev. "Partisan differences
on national security issues must be set
aside during this crucial time in our
negotiations with the Soviets," the
president said in his letter.
At the same time, Budget Director
James Miller 111 told House leaders that
the president would veto any short
term spending measure designed to
fund the government until early next
week. This move was designed to
deprive the Democrats of an opportu
nity to revive their arms-control issues
immediately after Reagan returns from
Iceland.
Such a veto would have the effect of
shutting down the government, except
for essential services, at midnight
tomorrow, shortly before Reagan

holds his first meeting with Gorba
chev. The president would not neces
sarily be affected by the shutdown.
While some members of Congress
thought it might be unseemly for the
government to go unfunded while the
president is negotiating with Gorba
chev, Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.) noted that the shutdown
would coincide with a three-day
weekend that includes Yom Kippur
and Columbus Day."I don't think it
makes any difference," he said.
Wright said the House had no inten
tion of staying in session if Reagan
chose to shut down the government
tomorrow. "If the government reaches
a point to where it is not functioning, it
is not our fault," he said.
Funding for the government was to
have expired at midnight last night, but
Congress averted that crisis by passing
a two-day spending bill that takes it
through tomorrow.
Various proposals were exchanged
yesterday to settle the other arms is
