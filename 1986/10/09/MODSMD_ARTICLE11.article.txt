# Goodby says U.S. arms position good

### KRISTIN BARENDSON 
President Reagan is in the best position of any
president in history to achieve an arms control
agreement, the U.S. ambassador to Finland said
Tuesday night.
In the first in a series of public lectures on
the history and future of arms control, James
Goodby spoke to a crowd of about 70 at Ter
man Auditorium tracing the progress of arms
control negotiations with the Soviet Union from
Eisenhower's presidency through the 19705.
Goodby blamed presidents' difficulties in ar
riving at agreements on the fact that "they are
hemmed in by advisers and share decisions
with Congress. They don't have mechanisms or
ability to control arms."
Goodby stressed several turning points in the
U.S. presidential policy on disarmament. The
Eisenhower administration first instituted a test
ban proposal that lasted until 1961, when the
Soviets started conducting secret tests, he said.
In 1966, Goodby said, John Kennedy ran for
president on a "missile gap" platform, based on
the incorrect assumption that the United States
trailed the Soviets in defense technology and
needed to catch up. Acting on this idea, the two

superpowers officially began the "arms race,"
Goodby said.
The scramble for defense and the search for
an alternative came to a head that same year,
with the birth of the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks. Kennedy, who had only a year earlier
refused to deploy an anti-ballistic missile sys
tem, now was willing to negotiate to "put the
lid" on ABM's, Goodby added.
"A talk on strategic arms was scheduled for
1968, but it was put off with the Soviet invasion
of Czechoslovakia," Goodby said.
"Parallel to the progress of deployment nego
tiations, MIRV (multiple independently tar
getable re-entry vehicle) was born," Goodby
continued. He said that MIRVs represent an im
portant change because "they give a great ad
vantage to the side that strikes first, providing
incentive to do so." Goodby mentioned that the
MIRV is not restricted under current treaties,
therefore making counterstrike forces inevi
table.
Although Goodby expressed concern over
treaties that are inadequate or have expired, his
final words offered a note of optimism for the
future. "Consensus is possible if everybody
does something about it,"he said.
