President Ronald Reagan's handling of two recent inci
dents, the Daniloff affair and the imposition of sanctions
on South Africa, shows that Reagan, once considered the
consummate media master, may be losing his touch.
Policy making requires a mix of obstinance and con
ciliation. In regard to the bill seeking to impose eco
nomic sanctions on South Africa, Reagan was hard
headed when he should not have been. The opposite is
true with the Daniloff case.
Sanctions against the apartheid-based regime in South
Africa gained the support of a large majority of Congress,
well over the two-thirds majority required to override a
presidential veto, and have been advocated by many stu
dent, religious and government leaders. The momentum
in this country is for sanctions, and it is discouraging that
Reagan could so inepdy misjudge the will of the people.
A conciliatory attitude by Reagan would have been the
most appropriate.
In reanrH m the Daniloff affair. Reaean went against

what has been one of the major tenets of his administra
tion â€” tough dealing with the Soviet Union. By trading
journalist Nicholas Daniloff for Soviet United Nations of
ficial Gennadi Zakharov, Reagan in effect set a very dan
gerous precedent in justifying the Soviet Union's taking
of an American hostage in order to force the release of a
Soviet spy.
The Daniloff case represented a perfect opportunity
for Reagan to play tough with the Soviet Union. A
declaration stating that the United States would accept no
less than the unconditional release of Daniloff would
have been the appropriate course of action instead of the
negotiation that took place.
It is important for a president to properly gauge the
amount of obstinance or compromise that a particular
situation calls for. However, in regard to Daniloff and
South Africa, Reagan appears to be woefully ignorant of
the correct line of action.
