Divestment is a
viable solution
We are lucky here at Stanford to
have a myriad of individuals and
thus individual ideals. College
provides a broad forum for political
views. It is interesting and necessary
to investigate issues from many
angles, but I sincerely believe that
there is also a point at which hard
facts must override personal opinion.
I was disturbed by the blunt
criticism of divestment voiced by
Allen C. Estes in his column
("Divestment will not end apartheid,"
Daily, Oct. 6). Mr. Estes points out that
"divestment is not the answer" for
ending apartheid and that "to divest is
to wash our hands of the South
Africans." Mr. Estes, how can you
justify giving financial backing to a
country that is openly racist and
oppressive to black and colored
factions that comprise the majority of
the poulation? You suggest that
foreign investment provides decent
jobs for black workers in South Africa.
Unfortunately, discrimination is also
perpetrated in the South African
workplace, with minority workers
making about 60 percent of the
average white worker's earnings.
Mr. Estes points out that a peaceful
solution to the problem in South
Africa would take time to develop, but
racial discrimination in South Africa
has existed for more than 30 years.
Simply because the issue seems new
to some Americans does not mean
that the problem needs more time to
be solved.
Stanford University has some $187
million invested with companies
operating in South Africa. Although
you have suggested that with wise
investments in that country certain
companies could work toward black
liberation in South Africa, there is no
way that companies operating under
an oppressive governmental system
and using exploitative labor laws to
their advantage are going to make
significant headway with the problem
of racial inequality.
It is true that divestment cannot end
the entrenched system of apartheid in
South Africa. Negotiation and rational
discussion will be an integral part of
any viable solution for ending apart
heid. Divestment is a base for display

ing U.S. distaste for the racist system
in South Africa. Divestment is not a
trendy issue nor one that should be
taken lightly. The fact that there is a
country in the 20th century operating
under a government that not only
condones but encourages racial
discrimination is obscene. I believe
that U.S. companies are symbolic of
the country they represent, and I
would prefer that American funds and
particularly the funds of this Univer
sity have no part in the demented
workings of a white-supremist nation.

Freshman, undeclared
Fraternity party
not a disruption
Although the brothers of Delta
Kappa Epsilon (DKE) appreciate
coverage of our house events, I find it
necessary to address the Stanford
community in order to clarify any
misconceptions that may have arisen
due to a photograph of the DKE
house (Daily, Oct. 1). From the cap
tion, it could be inferred that the
Dekes interfered with the final event
of freshman orientation by holding a
major, beer-bust. Not so. The members
of our house simply upheld a five-year
tradition of offering the freshmen a
cold drink on their way back from
their reception at the Kennedy house.
We specifically made a point of
asking all passers-by not to stop on
the way to, but rather on the way back
from, the reception, so as not to delay
or interfere with that long-awaited
handshake. All varieties of soft drinks
were readily available and in a much
more visible and accessible location
than was the beer, which was located
at the door of the house. And al
though visible in the photograph, the
banner hanging on the side of the
house was not entirely readable. It
read "Beer and Soft Drinks," in full
accordance with the University's
policy on alcoholic beverages.
We at Delta Kappa Epsilon sincerely
apologize to all freshmen whose
orientation was disturbed by this
gesture and invite them, their orienta
tion volunteers, their advisers, their
RAs, the faculty, staff and all interested
members of the community to the
Deke house to discuss this issue. All
are welcome this and every Wednes
day at lunch for Dekeburgers.
