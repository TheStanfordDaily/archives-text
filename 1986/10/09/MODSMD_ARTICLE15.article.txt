# New Stanford calendar is insulting
## 
### 
Have you seen it?
There it sits, front and center, as I walk into the
Stanford Bookstore:
The "Women of Stanford" calendar.
My, what a clever and thoughtful creation, so typi
cal of that inspiring entrepreneurial spirit that
pervades this fine institution of higher learning. And
those "women": such a beautiful visual representa
tion of all that comes to mind when I think about the
women I have come to know at Stanford. Can't wait
to buy one and hang it on my wall so that I may sit
and contemplate the loveliness of 12 women I don't
even know, but who have chosen to pose as repre
sentatives for the women I do know (but who obvi
ously were not of the high caliber sought after in the
calendar).
What? You detect a hint of sarcasm?
Well, that's a shame, because I honestly do hate
being sarcastic.
It's just that I'm a bit concerned.
In fact, I'm very concerned.

Upon seeing the calendar, my first concern was for
those women not represented in the calendar. In
case you have yet to see it, the title of the calendar it
self should be enough to tip you off. It seems to me
that it would be next to impossible to create any kind
of photo collection that could accurately represent
such a broad phrase as "The Women of Stanford."
From my limited experience it would have to include
Blacks, Whites, Chicanos, Asians, Europeans, Jews, In
dians, women with physical handicaps, tall women,
short women, big women, little women, women who
choose not to shave their body hair, women into
punk movements, feminist movements, the Grateful
Dead— The list could go on.
Needless to say, it would be hard to capture the es
sence of all of this in 12 pictures, but "The Women of
Stanford" does not even bother to try. Nor do they
bother to more accurately entitle their calendar
"Some of the women of Stanford." In fact, the
creators of the calendar so give into the common
high-school stereotype of what Stanford Women (or
any collection of California Coeds) should ideally
look like that it is almost laughable, if it weren't for
the painful results that are always caused by such
mindless exploits, but which are so rarely consid
ered.
The "Women of Stanford" calendar creates a dan
gerous stereotype that can cause serious problems
for any woman who comes to Stanford and does not

readily fit into any of the "types" portrayed in the
calendar. It can also cause just as many problems for
the women who do but would prefer not to be
thought of in those terms. Stereotypes affect an indi
vidual's physical health, mental health, behavior and
self-concept. In fact, there is probably no aspect of
human functioning that any kind of sex-role
stereotypes do not in some way affect.
Let's not be naive. The continued production and
purchase of things like this calendar are directly
linked to bulemia, anorexia, depression, low self
esteem, suicide, low intellectual growth, poor per
sonal relationships and much more.
I've heard people say that this calendar in particu
lar is relatively harmless, that they've "seen much
worse." I would like to argue that there is little, if any,
difference between this calendar and pornography in
their results. Both dangerously objectify and
stereotype women (and men) and create ideas that
are false and meaningless. Beauty does not supply
meaning. Mass media has created such a pervasive
concept of what is attractive in a woman (and a man)
that if you don't buy into it (and go health-crazy and
cosmetic-crazy) you are almost always forced to react
against it; it is impossible to ignore and decide
through experimentation, discussion and thought
what is right for you.
But I am perhaps becoming too abstract. Let's
move quickly to my second concern: How was such a
calendar allowed to be created? What is its connec
tion with Stanford? It seems to me an embarrassment
that the prestigious Stanford name was allowed to be
used on a project that goes completely against every
thing that the university (supposedly) supports. Is
there no regulation guarding the use of the word
Stanford on items? There must be, or else I could sell
Stanford shotguns, or call myself "The Man of Stan
ford" and go on a recruiting tour of the East. If
there's not, please let me know. I think it's time for a
change in policy. If there is, how did this calendar get
by? Did it get by? Is it "legal?" If not, why is the Stan
ford Bookstore selling it?
Perhaps, though, my most perplexing concern in
volves the creators and models for the calendar. Why
would you want your picture on the wall of someone
who does not even know you? I'm not trying to be
flip. It's just that I am really having trouble under
standing the mentality that would find it at all excit
ing to have your picture lusted over by a group of
guys with overactive hormones.
It seems as if it would only make life at Stanford
harder for you. Now you will have to continually fight
to prove that there is more to you than a pretty face.
How will you ever be sure that any guy who may
fancy himself attracted to you is actually attracted to
the complete you and not to the image you've
created? Haven't you now set yourself up, through
the selling of your picture, as something to be pos
sessed? Does it thrill you to know that at Stanford
there will be a certain number of women who,
thanks to you and Christie Brinkley and countless

others, will be trying to emulate you instead of trying
to discover their most fulfilled selves?
Perhaps you think I am blowing this particular
calendar out of proportion. It's just that at Stanford it
seems as if we should be spending our time and en
ergy publishing against the media's representation of
men and women, not bolstering the powerfully shal
low mentality that allows such misrepresentations to
continue. It's actually not that surprising that such a
calendar occurred at a school where people so love
to create dichotomies and live in contradiction;
where academic life is kept so separate from social
life; where we love to intellectualize over the plight
of South Africa, while ignoring our own govern
ment's treatment of the American Indian; where we
feel good about doing our few hours of public ser
vice per week while planning the fastest way to get
rich; and where we don't realize that mind and body
are one, that it is a dangerous game to try and divest
them.
It is also not surprising that this calendar exists at a
school at which our being allowed to attend is for the
most part highly dependent on the success of our
parents. Beauty, therefore, is a bit like our current
financial status in that it is an inherited wealth and
provides a false sense of accomplishment.
I would welcome a reply from any of the 12
women in the calendar as to why they did it (the
calendar was not open to the general student popula
tion) and what they feel about it. And I really don't
mean to be so harsh on just the women, because the
bulk of the responsibility falls on the men. That's why
I thought it was important for a man to write this
column. As many women as feel the need can protest
such calendars, but it is very easy for most to dis
count them on the inane claims of jealousy, etc. (Let's
admit it: Most of us try to have our cake and eat it too,
and it is very difficult to give up the sweet creamy
icing for a much drier morsel simply for the sake of
those less fortunate—) It is not until the oppressors,
the men, stand up and shout "Enough!" that this mad
ness will stop. It's time that we realize that we can
never separate "women's problems" from "men's
problems." Both are opposite sides of the same coin.
The temptation to identify with the male viewpoint
is legitimized everwhere. Women are rewarded for
perseverance in promoting male propaganda. When
women speak the truth, disbelief comes from all
sides. It is only when men as a collective are willing
to give up some of their power that change will
come. As long as we continue to promote such
meaningless garbage, we will forever lose touch with
our tender and more expressive sides; we will never
be able to deal effectively with women on any level
other than sexual/physical.
Come on, everybody. Let's take down the posters,
throw out the calendars and start fulfilling our poten
tial to love.
