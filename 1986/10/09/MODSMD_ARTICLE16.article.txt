# ASSU is alive and well, thank you
## 
### 
Today, yesterday and for the past week our office
has been flooded with students looking for ways to
get involved in the ASSU. It's too bad Chris Adamson,
Tuesday's Daily columnist ("ASSU a Behemoth of Bu
reaucracy," Daily Oct. 7), wasn't there to see it. We'd
like to take this opportunity to fill in new students
and remind old students why Adamson's brand of
negative attitude failed by a 2-1 margin at the polls
lost spring. (He didn't mention in his article that he'd
run for the Council of Presidents against us. Wonder
why?)

ASSU COP

Let's talk about involvement in student govern
ment. Why would anyone want to be involved? We
sure don't pay exorbitant wages. We don't have free
beer even. week. We don't have huge bonfires in
Lake Lag Why would anyone spend their time at the
ASSU, or even part of it?
To gain experience working with something that's
meaningful to them.
One hundred and twenty people work in the ASSU
on an ongoing basis. That's not counting the people
on University committees, or the volunteer task force
students or the associates who work on specific proj
ects. That's the people who come in and have a regu
lar job waiting for them when the year begins.
Some of them get paid and some of them don t,
but they all get experience: in business management
and analysis, in finance and banking, in making (and
taking responsibility tor) controversial ueci iiKC
whose funding should be cut when fees are too high,
in designing and presenting an effective case to ad
ministrators to convince them to act on students
concerns.

We'll take that bet Adamson makes (that there
aren't enough students who want to get involved)
right now.
In the first week of advertisement for the 49 posi
tions open on University committees, we ran out of
applications three times. More than 200 applications
were picked up by students. That's as many as in the
bigger cycle last spring; that's more students than we
can even interview for the available spots. We must
have missed the apathy, or else it's just a chronic
disease of Daily columnists.
The day after the first preliminary ad went out for
task forces — added in the ASSU News as a trial,
before we were even sure we'd go with all those task
forces — we started getting calls from people who
wanted to work with us or combine their efforts with
ours. At the end of the week the dozens of new stu
dents who came to our barbecue (if Adamson wants
parties, perhaps he should have come — or not)
were applying to those task forces. The following
week we wrote detailed descriptions of all minority
issue task forces and sent them to every theme house
and ethnic center. And we began recruiting at dining
hall tables, walking around from table to table telling
what's up and handing out our phone numbers.
Within an hour of the first dinner we got calls
Why did people respond? Not because student
government is something wonderful. It's just like
other things you can choose to spend your time on: a
lot of work, some fun, some excitement, and if you
pick the right thing, some tremendous experiences.
And that's what we're here for. We handle the work
.\e ic supposed to do — allocating money to student
groups, getting students on University committees so
they can play an active role in governance, running a
full-service bank for 300 campus organizations, pro
viding the student-run services like flicks and notes
and letting the University know, over and over and

hopefully persuasively, when we think something's
wrong. And after handling that work, people can look
back at the end of the day or the end of the year and
say: "Yeah, I learned something." Because they have.
If there's a problem it isn't that "student govern
ment isn't interesting to the average student," as
Adamson says. Life is short, and people make choices
every day as to what's important to them. But a few
hundred people just decided it was worth it to them
to look into the ASSU, and that's good enough for us.
Maybe they care about getting a pub on campus;
maybe they have something they want to say about af
firmative action; maybe they just want to feel like
they're in the middle of a few interesting things.
The best part about the ASSU is that it's free.
Seriously. One of our biggest jobs — probably the
biggest job — is deciding how to give away ei>ery
cent of the $17 a quarter we collect from students.
That's right. $600,000 a year goes right out the door
to independent student groups — name one that you
know; it probably gets funding from those fees — so
that they can do the programming they want. The
ASSU funds itself from a few cents off everyone's $1
trip to the Sunday Flicks and investments of project
sales in the past. That's the way it was designed; that's
the way we like it.
We don't have problems with uninformed people
writing Daily columns about the ASSU. That will hap
pen until we can get enough information out to every
student to tell them what the the ASSU really is: op
portunities to take, and nothing else. This is a start.
We won't convince Chris Adamson, but then he had
his mind made up before he ever heard of the ASSU
or ran for office. That's OK.
Kim Crawford, Randy Fuentes, Mary Thurher and
Carey White are the members of the ASSU Council of
Presidents
