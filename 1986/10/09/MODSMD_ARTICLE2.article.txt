# Near West Campus plan proposed
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
The University Board of Trustees will vote
Oct. 14 on the "basic planning principles" of an
ongoing $250 million redevelopment of the sci
ence and engineering area on campus. The 40-
acre plan is believed to be the largest
redevelopment effort ever at any university in
the country.
Stanford has begun the reworking of the area
because the current buildings are now over
crowded and obsolete. Most are one- and two
storv structures that were built in the 1940s and
19505.
The construction of the "Near West Campus"
is expected to take 10 to 15 years. The complex
will be roughly the size of the entire campus at

MIT.
Vice Provost Ray Bacchetti, who leads a plan
ning group that has been working for three
years on plans to improve the science and engi
neering facilities, said: "The existing buildings
have about one million square feet. Of that,
about 400,000 square feel will essentially
remain; 200,000 will be substantially renovated;
400,000 will be torn down and replaced; and
400,000 square feet of new space will be built,
for a total of 1.4 million square feet of building
space."
The architecture will resemble the Main
Quadrangle, but no decisions have been made
yet on specific building shapes, styles, sizes or
occupants.
Most of the money for the project will come
from gifts to the University. Alum William

Hewlett has already given $40 million to Stan
ford expressly for the Near West Campus. Bac
chetti said the University expects to borrow an
other $20 million and use another $20 million
in annual budget money allocated for facilities
and buildings.
Among the planning principles which will be
presented for formal trustee approval on Tues
day are: the axes of the complex incorporating
the main pedestrain walkways between the
buildings; the "exedra," a semi-circular space
which will include an arbor and fountain; and a
science quadrangle with couityard. The Faculty
Senate will be given a presentation on the proj
ect on Oct. 16.
According to University Planning Director
Phil Williams, the science quadrangle will be
about half the size of the Main Quad. He said

the trustees have seen "fairly elaborate presen
tations of prospective drawings and large scale
models" of the overall plan. However, the exact
plan for each building will be approved indi
vidually to maintain flexibility for the planners
and architects.
The area is approximately bounded by the
Stanford Museum on the north, the Main Quad
on the east, the Medical Center on the west and
Panama Street on the south. It will include two
long, intersecting alleys of trees, a series of
arcades and intimate courtyards. The structures
will be characterized by red tile roofs.
If the trustees approve the basic principles
on Tuesday, the deans and the provost will
spend the next two to three months working on
details of building sizes and location of depart
ments. The plan already calls for division of the

area into three zones: physical and materials
sciences, electrical engineering and earth
sciences in the south (closest to Roblegym); in
formation sciences in the middle near Serra
Street; and biology, chemistry and chemical en
gineering in the north.
The basic plan for the Near West Campus was
finalized this summer by The Architects Col
laborative (TAC) of San Francisco and
Cambridge, Mass. it includes concepts from
three diverse exploratory plans that were laid
out between November and February of last
year.
The consultants are expected to finish their
report on the plan around the beginning of
next year. Williams said the next step involving
the trustees will be a presentation of a "statement
of design guidelines," which will indicate to ar
chitects what building materials can be used and
the expected "character" of the new buildings.
Beyond that, Williams said, "the development
of a parking structure plan may come early, since
the current parking space will be devoted to new
buildings." Detailed planning is already under
way on an additional biology building that was
approved by the trustees last year.
Humanities and Sciences Dean Norman Wes

sells said life will be "a little hectic during
demolition and construction, but "with the right
kind of sequencing, actual work in buildings will
not be impeded in measurable ways." New quar
ters for the Computer Science Department are a
high priority for University officials.
Applied Physics Prof. Robert Byer, who chairs a
faculty consulting group called FUTURES, said he
is pleased with TAC's master plan. "It reflects
quite accurately the concerns for a regional
design, and it will encourage faculty interaction."
TAC's plan also allows for a second phase of ex
pansion, said Bacchetti, "way down the pike."
Two new buildings could be added to the west
side of Near West Campus while a third could be
constructed north of Terman Engineering Center.
