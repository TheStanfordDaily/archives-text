Looking for a new place to eat in the
Stanford area? California Cafe, con
veniently located in the Stanford Barn,
might be the right choice. The restau
rant opened only nine weeks ago and
was still packed at 9 p.m. when we
arrived for dinner (Make your reserva
tions early!). The first thing that we
noticed about the restaurant was the

central dining area. This section con
tained most of the Cafe's clientele (a
noisy hunch) and a piano. The happy
looking pianist was churning out selec
tions of adult contemporary music,
oblivious to the fact that he could
hardly he heard. The decor was a
mixture of many things, including or
ange and green wallpaper, tropical
plants and neon signs. The waitresses
wore wildly colored stockings. All the
chefs are on exhibit to the crowd un
der the signs of their specialties
("Grill," "Bakery" and the like).
If you wish, you can sample wines
before dinner in special sampling

glasses before choosing from the ex
tensive wine list. We chose the Califor
nia Cafe Private Label Chardonnay, a
wine made exclusively for the restau
rant by a local winery. It was dry, light,
fruity and smooth. Next came the
bread, which was warm and soft,
having been baked on the premises.
We were surprised to find that it was
replaced after we were only half done
with it. The salad was excellent, topped
with a light Dijon-flavored vinaigrette.
As the main course, we ordered the
grilled salmon and the smoked
monkfish. Both were superb. The sal
mon came in a delicately seasoned
sauce and was verv tender. What is

monkfish? You just have to come in
and try it. It too was tender but had a
stronger flavor than the salmon. Both
fishes were completely boneless and
came with an assortment of vegetables,
including cauliflower, zucchini,
squash, carrots, string beans, broccoli,
red pepper and potatoes. The
lambchops were also recommended.
For dessert we had the cheesecake and
the chocolate mousse tort. The
cheesecake was delicious and came
with a not-too-sweet raspberry puree.
The chocolate mousse tort was very
light and fluffy. The "Chocolate
Decadence" was also highly recom
mended.

Both the waitress and the busboy
mentioned Mac Arthur Park as the
Cite s main competition. There are dif
ferences, though. Mac Arthur is solidly
yuppie, while this place seemed to be a
mixture of yuppies and families. The
waitress told us that many of the cus
tomers worked at the Medical Center
or Stanford Shopping Center.
Cafe s main focus seems to be on va
rieties of fish and salads, although they
do offer some meat dishes (and a con
spicuously located "baby back ribs" on
the menu). Dress is more casual than
Mac Arthur Park. The tables are covered
with paper, but no crayons are

supplied. The prices are moderately
expensive, with main courses ranging
from $6-115. The service is prompt and
courteous, owing partially to the fact
that each waitress can communicate
orders to the kitchen via a hand-held
computer. Don t get up in the middle
of the meal. You'll be run over by all
the waitresses and busboys.
California Cafe is not the place for an
intimate dinner because ot its noise
level, bright lighting and open space.
Instead, it stands out as a lively place
for a group with its excellent food,
good service and an atmosphere
varied as California itself.
