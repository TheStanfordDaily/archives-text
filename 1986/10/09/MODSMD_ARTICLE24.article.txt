## Resurgent offense lifts Card 
### ED STACKLER 
Offensive and defensive domination
was the name of the game yesterday as
the Stanford women's soccer team
breezed by the potentially tough soc
cer squad from the University of San
Francisco, 3-0.
In the first half, Stanford set the pace
of the game by taking several quick,
close shots at the Dons' goal and by
frustrating the USF offense with a
seemingly impenetrable backfield.
Rarely did the ball find its way past
Cardinal fullbacks Hilary Turner, Chris
Scott and Anne Youmans in the first
period.
USF standout freshman Shanna

Haines was held to an average day, at
tempting only two shots at the goal and
missing them both. Early in the second
period, however, Haines was called
upon to take over for the injured USF
goalkeeper, Hollie Brashear.
Haines' mediocre day was at least
partially the result of Turner's out
standing one-on-one defense. "Hilary
Turner did a real good job of shutting
her (Haines) down," Stanford Coach
Helen Keohane said.
Stanford's offensive hero in the
game was Stacey Keare, a sophomore
forward who has had an up-and-down
season. "She (Keare) played the
second half of the Sonoma game, and
then she had two really good days at

practice," Keohane said. "She was
ready to play."
Keare's presence of mind and deter
mination forced a goal midway
through the first half of the game when
the USF goalie blocked a kick and then
let the ball slip from her grasp. Keare
quickly slipped past the goalkeeper
and tapped the ball into the heart of
the net in a casual manner.
Five minutes into the second half,
the score was still 1-0. Then, once
again, it was Keare receiving an assist
from sophomore Christy McDevitt and
hammering a high shot into the upper
corner of the goal.
Several minutes later, the Cardinal
scored its third and final goal. Blair

Eliot, a freshman midfielder, slipped a
pass to veteran midfielder Amy Geisse,
who took the assist and kicked a high,
straight shot over the goalkeeper.
For most of the second half, the
Dons often threatened to score. The
threat was slim however; Cardinal
goalkeeper Vija Brookshire played as
steadily and energetically as usual, and
the midfield offense, led by former
high school All-America Tonya An
tonucci, consistently kept the ball away
from the Dons.
"We played them (USF) as if they
were the No. 1 team on the coast," An
tonucci said. "We took advantage of
their flat defense. Our passing was
good, and we were confident."
