# Saturday's game: top 20 showtime
## 
### 
For the last three years, Stanford
football has resembled a dime-store
paperback â€” fun, perhaps, but without
a whole lot of meaning. When winning
Big Game means the difference be
tween a 3-8 season and a 4-7 one, you
just can't get too excited about the
greater ramifications of the football
game.

But wait a minute. Five-straight
losing seasons are about to come to an
end in a matter of weeks. Unless you've
spent the last week waiting outside the
stadium for seats or something, you
know the Cardinal is 4-0 for the first
time since 1952. That's as many games
as Stanford won all last season.

You want meaning, you'll get
meaning this week. No. 18 Stanford
hosts No. 12 Washington. The only
game this weekend between ranked
teams. And without a doubt, the big
gest game since seniors arrived on
campus three years ago.
Its also, to put it bluntly, put up or
shut up time for the Stanford team. It's
4-0, and without a doubt a good foot
ball team, one that should reasonably
be expected to finish 7-4 and go to a
bowl game. By all estimations, that is a
good season.
But this team hasn't said one word
about being satisfied with merely
good. And if the Cardinal intends to
join the nation's elite, it will have to
defeat the nation's elite.
Enter Washington. Continually
among the elite of the top 20. Add a na
tional television audience. All that's
missing is a victory to prove beyond a
doubt to anyone concerned that the
Cardinal this season is for real.
