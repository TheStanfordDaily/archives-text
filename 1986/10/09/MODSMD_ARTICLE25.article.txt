# Saturday's game: top 20 showtime
## 
### 
For the last three years, Stanford
football has resembled a dime-store
paperback — fun, perhaps, but without
a whole lot of meaning. When winning
Big Game means the difference be
tween a 3-8 season and a 4-7 one, you
just can't get too excited about the
greater ramifications of the football
game.

But wait a minute. Five-straight
losing seasons are about to come to an
end in a matter of weeks. Unless you've
spent the last week waiting outside the
stadium for seats or something, you
know the Cardinal is 4-0 for the first
time since 1952. That's as many games
as Stanford won all last season.

You want meaning, you'll get
meaning this week. No. 18 Stanford
hosts No. 12 Washington. The only
game this weekend between ranked
teams. And without a doubt, the big
gest game since seniors arrived on
campus three years ago.
Its also, to put it bluntly, put up or
shut up time for the Stanford team. It's
4-0, and without a doubt a good foot
ball team, one that should reasonably
be expected to finish 7-4 and go to a
bowl game. By all estimations, that is a
good season.
But this team hasn't said one word
about being satisfied with merely
good. And if the Cardinal intends to
join the nation's elite, it will have to
defeat the nation's elite.
Enter Washington. Continually
among the elite of the top 20. Add a na
tional television audience. All that's
missing is a victory to prove beyond a
doubt to anyone concerned that the
Cardinal this season is for real.

The players may believe it, the
coaches may believe it, but no one else
does. They want to. Oh, do they want
to. But everyone is preparing for what
is believed to be the inevitable let
down that will set in around 7 p.m. Sat
urday evening. "We're gonna get killed
Saturday, aren't we?" has become the
most common line on campus this
week. It is said, though, with just a
tinge of hope.
"The community at large," outside
linebacker Chris Weber said Monday,
"really doesn't concern me. It comes
down to proving to ourselves what we
can do, what we can be."
They believe what they can do. Sat
urday is the chance to prove what they
can be.

The higher-ups at this university
have decided that small groups of stu
dents who show up early at football
games to reserve seats for their fellow
dorm or house residents can no longer
do so.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
and Athletic Director Andy Geiger cite
intimidation by groups, problems
outside the stadium the night before
games and a dangerous surge of the
crowd after the gates open as reasons
for prohibiting the practice.
The Athletic Department said it will
set up a queue at Saturday's game to
control the influx into the stadium, but
the assumption has to be that more stu
dents will be there when the gates
open an hour before game time. If 10
people saved seats for an entire house
last week, there will be all 50 house
residents in line this week.
One means of ameliorating the

problem does seem to be opening the
gates earlier, allowing people to drift
into the stadium, instead of pressing
outside the gates. This would probably
move a lot of tailgate parties into the
stadium, but the problems outside
would be greatly reduced.
But where are the people?
One fact that came out of that earlier
story: Out of a student population of
about 13,000, only 4,305 season tickets
have been sold. A package of five
games costs only $30, and that includes
an $11 Big Game ticket. For the first
time in four years, Stanford has a good,
competitive football team. And only
half of the student section has been
sold so far.
It's not just the students. Only 36,500
fans were at last week's game against
San Diego State. And even worse, only
43,000 are expected for the Washing
ton game. Nowhere else in the country

are two top-20 teams playing Saturday,
and only 43,000 of the Bay Area's 5 5
million residents will be in the stands
to see it.
It's said that fans will support a win
ner. They have the winner. Where's the
support?
The Bear may not quit, but Kapp
should
Tuesday, the San Francisco
Chronicle's Glenn Dickey called on Joe
Kapp to resign as the football coach at
California, which is 1-3 this season.
What makes Dickey's column particu
larly harsh is that he was Kapp's biggest
supporter in the media.
Translation: Kapp will be working
elsewhere this time next year.
And one wild, unsubstantiated
rumor: Ohio State Coach Earle Bruce
as the new coach at Cal. Remember,
you read it here first.

The players may believe it, the
coaches may believe it, but no one else
does. They want to. Oh, do they want
to. But everyone is preparing for what
is believed to be the inevitable let
down that will set in around 7 p.m. Sat
urday evening. "We're gonna get killed
Saturday, aren't we?" has become the
most common line on campus this
week. It is said, though, with just a
tinge of hope.
"The community at large," outside
linebacker Chris Weber said Monday,
"really doesn't concern me. It comes
down to proving to ourselves what we
can do, what we can be."
They believe what they can do. Sat
urday is the chance to prove what they
can be.

The higher-ups at this university
have decided that small groups of stu
dents who show up early at football
games to reserve seats for their fellow
dorm or house residents can no longer
do so.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
and Athletic Director Andy Geiger cite
intimidation by groups, problems
outside the stadium the night before
games and a dangerous surge of the
crowd after the gates open as reasons
for prohibiting the practice.
The Athletic Department said it will
set up a queue at Saturday's game to
control the influx into the stadium, but
the assumption has to be that more stu
dents will be there when the gates
open an hour before game time. If 10
people saved seats for an entire house
last week, there will be all 50 house
residents in line this week.
One means of ameliorating the

problem does seem to be opening the
gates earlier, allowing people to drift
into the stadium, instead of pressing
outside the gates. This would probably
move a lot of tailgate parties into the
stadium, but the problems outside
would be greatly reduced.
But where are the people?
One fact that came out of that earlier
story: Out of a student population of
about 13,000, only 4,305 season tickets
have been sold. A package of five
games costs only $30, and that includes
an $11 Big Game ticket. For the first
time in four years, Stanford has a good,
competitive football team. And only
half of the student section has been
sold so far.
It's not just the students. Only 36,500
fans were at last week's game against
San Diego State. And even worse, only
43,000 are expected for the Washing
ton game. Nowhere else in the country

are two top-20 teams playing Saturday,
and only 43,000 of the Bay Area's 5 5
million residents will be in the stands
to see it.
It's said that fans will support a win
ner. They have the winner. Where's the
support?
The Bear may not quit, but Kapp
should
Tuesday, the San Francisco
Chronicle's Glenn Dickey called on Joe
Kapp to resign as the football coach at
California, which is 1-3 this season.
What makes Dickey's column particu
larly harsh is that he was Kapp's biggest
supporter in the media.
Translation: Kapp will be working
elsewhere this time next year.
And one wild, unsubstantiated
rumor: Ohio State Coach Earle Bruce
as the new coach at Cal. Remember,
you read it here first.
For the last three years, Stanford
football has resembled a dime-store
paperback — fun, perhaps, but without
a whole lot of meaning. When winning
Big Game means the difference be
tween a 3-8 season and a 4-7 one, you
just can't get too excited about the
greater ramifications of the football
game.

But wait a minute. Five-straight
losing seasons are about to come to an
end in a matter of weeks. Unless you've
spent the last week waiting outside the
stadium for seats or something, you
know the Cardinal is 4-0 for the first
time since 1952. That's as many games
as Stanford won all last season.

You want meaning, you'll get
meaning this week. No. 18 Stanford
hosts No. 12 Washington. The only
game this weekend between ranked
teams. And without a doubt, the big
gest game since seniors arrived on
campus three years ago.
Its also, to put it bluntly, put up or
shut up time for the Stanford team. It's
4-0, and without a doubt a good foot
ball team, one that should reasonably
be expected to finish 7-4 and go to a
bowl game. By all estimations, that is a
good season.
But this team hasn't said one word
about being satisfied with merely
good. And if the Cardinal intends to
join the nation's elite, it will have to
defeat the nation's elite.
Enter Washington. Continually
among the elite of the top 20. Add a na
tional television audience. All that's
missing is a victory to prove beyond a
doubt to anyone concerned that the
Cardinal this season is for real.
