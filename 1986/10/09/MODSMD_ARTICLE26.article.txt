# Werdel leaves Stanford for pro circuit
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Marianne Werdel, who as a fresh
man last year earned All-America
honors and was the No. 2 singles
player on the NCAA-champion Stan
ford women's tennis team, has for
saken the rest of her college eligibility
in order to turn professional.
Werdel, who compiled a 21-9 singles
record at Stanford last season, made
her decision at the beginning of Sep
tember and has competed in two pro
fessional tournaments since.
"I've been thinking about it for
awhile," Werdel said yesterday."It was
in the back of my mind. I decided to
get out and go for it."
"She was very driven," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "She
wanted to jump right into it."
Werdel was one of the most highly
recruited players ever to join the Card
inal women's tennis program, having
established herself as the nation's top
junior. She had pondered becoming a
professional straight out of high school
but eventually chose Stanford, where
she was the fourth person in her family
to play tennis.
"I think her decision to come to
school was more of her parent's deci
sion," Brennan said.
"My parents really wanted me to go
to school, and I wasn't sure," Werdel
said.
The first month of the 1986 season
was a nightmare for Werdel, as she was
upset by players she previously had
never lost to. The native of Bakersfield

had trouble adjusting to the limited
practice time available while attending
college.
After losing to San Diego State's
Anne Moeller on Feb. 27 and dropping
to 1-3 on the season, Werdel expressed
her frustration. "Before, tennis was my
main concern," she said. "Now I have
classes. When you're playing in the
pros, you have a match every day.
Here, there are only two matches a
week."
Even when she was playing her
poorest tennis, Werdel said that she
never considered leaving the team
during the season. "The whole pur
pose of coming to school was to see
what school was like, not just to play
tennis," she said.
As the season progressed, Werdel's
game did too. In late April, she
knocked off USC's Heliane Steden in
straight sets in what Brennan labeled
one of the most memorable college
matches he had ever seen. Steden at
the time was the No. 4 player in the na
tion.
At the NCAA team championships in
Austin, Tex. May 15-19, Werdel
produced one key victory after an
other, defeating Miami's Lise Gregory
in the semifinals and outgunning
Steden in the finals.
She was seeded No. 8 in the ensuing
individual championships but lost to
California's Heather Ettus in the third
round.
Following the school year, Werdel
played on the summer professional
tour and played well enough to con
vince herself to devote all of her

energies to tennis. "I had two really
good summers in a row," she said.
Werdel said that her Stanford exper
ience was a very positive one. "It was
one of the best decisions I've ever
made."
Nevertheless, university life was not
the most conducive environment in
which to improve her tennis game.
"It's really frustrating, because every
summer you do really well, and then
you can't play, and your ranking goes
down," she said.
Werdel informed Brennan of her
decision in a letter last month. "I don't
think anyone was really too surprised,"
he said.
Brennan said he was disappointed
but understood Werdel's desire to join
the professional ranks. "I don't think
anyone should turn pro while they're
in school," he said. "On the other
hand, it's awfully tough in this competi
tive world to play since you were eight
and then be told: 'We want you to go to
school.'
"These kids are so revved up, it's
hard to hold them back," he added.
Brennan said that Werdel's frustra
tion during the early pan of last season
may have led to her decision. "Here
she was playing No. 2, losing a few
matches and seeing players she can
beat playing in Europe and Africa."
The transition from amateur to pro
fessional has been a smooth one so far
for Werdel. She has played in two tour
naments in the past month and has
been pleased with the results.
In her first professional action, Wer
del advanced to the quarterfinals in a

Tampa, Fla. tournament, scoring an im
pressive early-round victory over Car
ling Bassett, the No. 11 player in the
world.
She then advanced to the round of

16 in a New Orleans event, losing to
highly ranked Wendy Turnbull.
Werdel expects to be No. 32 in the
world when the new rankings are
released, and she has already set her

sights even higher. "By the time I go to
Europe in March or April, I want to be
in the top 20," she said. "(Before then)
1 have three tournaments on hard
courts indoors so I should do well."

her decision at the beginning of Sep
tember and has competed in two pro
fessional tournaments since.
"I've been thinking about it for
awhile," Werdel said yesterday."It was
in the back of my mind. I decided to
get out and go for it."
"She was very driven," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "She
wanted to jump right into it."
Werdel was one of the most highly
recruited players ever to join the Card
inal women's tennis program, having
established herself as the nation's top
junior. She had pondered becoming a
professional straight out of high school
but eventually chose Stanford, where
she was the fourth person in her family
to play tennis.
"I think her decision to come to
school was more of her parent's deci
sion," Brennan said.
"My parents really wanted me to go
to school, and I wasn't sure," Werdel
said.
The first month of the 1986 season
was a nightmare for Werdel, as she was
upset by players she previously had
never lost to. The native of Bakersfield

had trouble adjusting to the limited
practice time available while attending
college.
After losing to San Diego State's
Anne Moeller on Feb. 27 and dropping
to 1-3 on the season, Werdel expressed
her frustration. "Before, tennis was my
main concern," she said. "Now I have
classes. When you're playing in the
pros, you have a match every day.
Here, there are only two matches a
week."
Even when she was playing her
poorest tennis, Werdel said that she
never considered leaving the team
during the season. "The whole pur
pose of coming to school was to see
what school was like, not just to play
tennis," she said.
As the season progressed, Werdel's
game did too. In late April, she
knocked off USC's Heliane Steden in
straight sets in what Brennan labeled
one of the most memorable college
matches he had ever seen. Steden at
the time was the No. 4 player in the na
tion.
At the NCAA team championships in
Austin, Tex. May 15-19, Werdel
produced one key victory after an
other, defeating Miami's Lise Gregory
in the semifinals and outgunning
Steden in the finals.
She was seeded No. 8 in the ensuing
individual championships but lost to
California's Heather Ettus in the third
round.
Following the school year, Werdel
played on the summer professional
tour and played well enough to con
vince herself to devote all of her

energies to tennis. "I had two really
good summers in a row," she said.
Werdel said that her Stanford exper
ience was a very positive one. "It was
one of the best decisions I've ever
made."
Nevertheless, university life was not
the most conducive environment in
which to improve her tennis game.
"It's really frustrating, because every
summer you do really well, and then
you can't play, and your ranking goes
down," she said.
Werdel informed Brennan of her
decision in a letter last month. "I don't
think anyone was really too surprised,"
he said.
Brennan said he was disappointed
but understood Werdel's desire to join
the professional ranks. "I don't think
anyone should turn pro while they're
in school," he said. "On the other
hand, it's awfully tough in this competi
tive world to play since you were eight
and then be told: 'We want you to go to
school.'
"These kids are so revved up, it's
hard to hold them back," he added.
Brennan said that Werdel's frustra
tion during the early pan of last season
may have led to her decision. "Here
she was playing No. 2, losing a few
matches and seeing players she can
beat playing in Europe and Africa."
The transition from amateur to pro
fessional has been a smooth one so far
for Werdel. She has played in two tour
naments in the past month and has
been pleased with the results.
In her first professional action, Wer
del advanced to the quarterfinals in a

Tampa, Fla. tournament, scoring an im
pressive early-round victory over Car
ling Bassett, the No. 11 player in the
world.
She then advanced to the round of

16 in a New Orleans event, losing to
highly ranked Wendy Turnbull.
Werdel expects to be No. 32 in the
world when the new rankings are
released, and she has already set her

sights even higher. "By the time I go to
Europe in March or April, I want to be
in the top 20," she said. "(Before then)
1 have three tournaments on hard
courts indoors so I should do well."

After a successful summer playing on the women's tennis tour, Marianne Werdel has decided to turn professional.
Marianne Werdel, who as a fresh
man last year earned All-America
honors and was the No. 2 singles
player on the NCAA-champion Stan
