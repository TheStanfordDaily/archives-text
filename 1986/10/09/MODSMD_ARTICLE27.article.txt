# Spikers host Invitational

### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Looking at the teams playing in tonight's and tomorrow
night's Josten's Invitational Volleyball Tournament — Stan
ford, San Jose State, Illinois State and Colorado State — it
seems obvious that the two schools facing each other for the
championship Friday night will be perennial powers Stan
ford and SJSU.

While it doesn't hurt for most people to believe this fairly
safe statement, it is exactly this approach to the tournament
that Stanford Coach Don Shaw wants his players to avoid.
"One of our philosophies is that we always expect the
other team to play the best match of their life," Shaw said.
"If you take a team lightly, then you should expect trouble."
Such is the advice that Shaw will be giving his players
before they take the Maples Pavilion
court at 6 p.m. to face unranked Illinois
State (4-10). The Redbirds have been

hurt by several injuries to their top
players which have left them with no
recourse but to start four freshmen.
"I know they've got talent, these are
many of the same players I was recruit
ing last year," Shaw said. "Illinois State
had an excellent recruiting year, but
the adjustment from high school to

college is so great."
For Shaw, however, facing a team
starting four freshmen doesn't make
his job any easier. "To me, their having
to make this adjustment so quickly
means they're unpredictable," he said.
In all likelihood, the 12th-ranked
Cardinal, coming off a solid victory

over then seventh-ranked Arizona State
last weekend, will be facing SJSU, 11-1
and No. 3 in the nation, in tomorrow's
8 p.m. championship.
Facing SJSU tonight at 8 p.m. will be
No. 15 Colorado State. The Lady Rams,
with a 16-2 record, are in the middle of
their best season ever.
