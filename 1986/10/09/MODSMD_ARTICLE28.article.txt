# Sox, Astros win
## 
### 
BOSTON — Dwight Evans' fifth
inning popup fell for a tie-breaking
double, and the Boston Red Sox won
the battle of bad hops, blunders and
bizarre plays to beat the California An
gels 9-2 Wednesday and even the
American League playoffs at one game
apiece.
Every ball seemed like an adventure
in Fenway Park's late afternoon sun
and the swirling wind, and Evans' lucky
double in the fifth put the Red Sox
ahead 3-2. The Red Sox broke the
game open with three runs in the
seventh, helped by three errors, and
three more runs in the eighth, capped
by Jim Rice's two-run homer, to gain a
split at home in the first two games of
the best-of-seven series.
Game 3 is scheduled for Friday night
in Anaheim, site of the next three
meetings.
Astros 1, Mets 0
HOUSTON — Mike Scott prevailed
in the heralded "Shootout at the K Cor
ral" with Dwight Gooden, equalling a

playoff record with 14 strikeouts and
throwing a five-hitter as the Houston
Astros defeated the New York Mets 1-0
Wednesday night in the first game of
the 1986 National League playoffs.
Glenn Davis' home run leading off
the second inning was all Scott, who
led the major leagues in strikeouts
with 306, needed.
Gooden, the major-league strikeout
leader the past two seasons, gave up
seven hits and struck out five in seven
innings while working in and out of
trouble as the Astros wasted numerous
scoring chances.
Game 2 of the best-of-seven series
tonight will match Houston right
hander Nolan Ryan, 12-8, baseball's all
time strikeout leader, against left
hander Bob Ojeda, 18-5.
Davis, who became only the second
Astro to hit 30 or more homers in a
season with 31 this year, hit a 1-0 pitch
from Gooden to straightaway center
field to lead off the second. Center
fielder Lenny Dykstra was at the wall
waiting, but there was no chance.
