doing business in South Africa and the pos-

policies.
The group plans to urge Kennedy to to
sign a public statement with other univer
sities, calling for the South African govern
ment to release Nelson Mandela and other
political prisoners, Casanueva said. The
group will also propose that the Univer
sity's scholarship exchange program with
South Africa be broadened to include
exiled South African students, she said.
The meeting, which is closed to the
