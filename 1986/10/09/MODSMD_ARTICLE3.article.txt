# Interim stadium policy reached
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
A group of six students and Stanford
administrators yesterday struck a com
promise that asks student groups inter
ested in camping outside Stanford
Stadium tomorrow night to register
with the Axe Committee by that after
noon and to follow temporary rules
designed to eliminate rowdiness at the
game Saturday.
Each group that registers will also he
asked to send representatives to a
meeting later tomorrow, where Axe
Committee organizers will explain the
new rules, which are designed to
facilitate orderly admission to the
stadium and limit the alcohol in the
crowd at the Stanford-Washington foot
ball game. Beer kegs will not be
allowed in the stadium, and a new line
forming system will be implemented,
according to junior I.ori Abert, one of
the students who took part in yester
day's meeting.
Another meeting will be held Mon
day at noon in the Tresidder Aspen
Room for all students interested in
forming a committee to develop a per
manent policy on behavior at the
stadium.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
called yesterday's meeting in response
to confusion over rules for student
conduct at football games, according to
Abert. "He suggested that we get to
gether with other students to establish
guidelines that are clear," she said.
Abert, junior Clark Eller and senior
Mike Tuchin met with Lyons, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington and
Director of Athletics Andy Geiger to
work out the temporary solution.
At last Saturday's Stanford-San Diego
State game, some minor injuries
resulted from a crush by students who
had camped outside the stadium as
they tried to be the first through the
gates The University is also concerned
about drunkenness and fighting that
have occurred outside the stadium the
night before and in the stadium the day
of football games.
The University had already asked
that student groups not save blocks of
seats, a practice that has resulted in in
timidation of students seeking individ
ual seats or blocks for small groups.
All groups wishing to camp outside
the stadium tomorrow night should
register by 4 p.m. tomorrow afternoon
with the Axe Committee office in the
Old Fire house, according to a letter
stating the temporary rules. At 4 p.m.,
each group should send three repre
sentatives to a meeting .it the stadium s
gate 12, where the rules will be ex
plained.
"Our purpose in having three repre
sentatives per group register is so that
we can communicate with them rather
than, say ISO people," Tuchin said.
Abert said: "This is a temporary solu
tion, a compromise until we can
develop a better plan
Tuchin said Lyons would "look un
favorably" on any group that does not
comply with the rules. Lyons agreed.
adding: "That's certainly the way that
the students who put these rules to
gether would feel."
The proposed committee's long
term goal should be to establish a "safe
and equitable'' seating plan, Tuchin
said. "By equitable' we mean we won't
discriminate against any particular
group, and we won't discriminate
against any individuals who are told by
larger groups that they can't sit in cer
tain seats because they are saved."
"Whatever (the new policy) is, it has
to be fair," Lyons said. "Everybody has
to have an equal chance for seats."
Lyons said he is "delighted that stu
dents are interested in taking responsi

bility" for developing a behavior policy
for football games.
Herrington described yesterday's
meeting as "very positive.' He said
police enforcement would not in
crease for this week's game, adding
that students commonly misun
derstand the intentions of the police at
the stadium.
"If there is a confrontation involving
a threat or physical harm, then we will
intervene, as we always have.... What
I'm interested in is that the students
come to the game and see it safely," he
said.
Tuchin is the chairman of the Stan
ford Axe Committee. He said he plans
to involve the committee, with more
than 100 members, in establishing a
new policy for safe seating.
