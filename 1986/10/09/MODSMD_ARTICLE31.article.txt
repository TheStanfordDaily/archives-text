S t is your education. So I invite you to take full advantage of Stanford's library
services, which can enrich your education enormously. The libraries provide a
â–  vast range of information on subjects vital and recondite, esoteric and common-place.
You will find more than books in the library: its staff include librarians with knowledge of
most academic disciplines and dozens of languages. They are expert in finding appropriate
subject literature for your need, whether the information is in journal articles, popular
magazines, books, technical reports, manuscript or archival sources, maps, motion
pictures, or machine-readable data files.
With over five million volumes and nearly three million microtexts, the resources here are
vast. And staff will help you gain access to these as well as to occasionally needed items in
other North American research libraries.
Please ASK us. Let us know your informational needs. My colleagues and I extend to
you our welcome to the educational world of the Stanford libraries. o^^
