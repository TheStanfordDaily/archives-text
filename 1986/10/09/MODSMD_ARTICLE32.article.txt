# FINDING LIBRARY MATERIALS
## Using the Catalogs... 
### 
There are two kinds of catalogs at
Stanford-the online catalog and the
card catalog-and you will need to
become familiar with both in order to locate
library materials. Socrates, the online catalog,
is usually the best place to begin your search
since all materials-new and oldâ€”acquired since
1973 are added to Socrates and it offers search
capabilities that are not available with the
manual card catalogs. Also, since August 15,
1986, cards for newly processed materials are no
longer added to card catalogs in most libraries.
Records for these materials are found only in
Socrates. However, the manual card catalogs
still contain many thousands of records for items
acquired before 1973 that are not yet in Socrates.
Records for these items are now in the process of
being gradually added to the online catalog.
Please consult the handout entitiled "Compari
son of the Green Library Card Catalog and
Socrates, the Online Catalog," which is
available near Socrates terminals. If you cannot
locate the material you need, ask for assistance at
the nearest reference desk.
