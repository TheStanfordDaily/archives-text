# Socrates, the Online Catalog...
## 
### 
Socrates contains records for
approximately half of the libraries'
collections: all items in the Meyer
Memorial Library and records for items processed
since 1973 for Green Library and the branch
libraries. Records for the Coordinate Libraries'
materials have been added to Socrates since 1977.
Socrates can be searched from terminals
located in Green, Meyer, and the branch libraries
as well as in the Hoover Institution Library, and
Robert Crown Law Library. Printing facilities
are available at Green and Meyer and will be
installed at other locations within the year.
Socrates can also be searched from outside the
libraries using terminals or personal computers
that are equiped with modems. At the Privileges
Desk in Green Library or at reference desks in
other campus libraries, you may a obtain free
account which provides twenty-four hour access
to Socrates.
Socrates was designed to be accessible to all
library users regardless of computer experience.
New users can be self-tutored by printed guides
located near Socrates terminals and by following
online HELP instructions. Consult staff at the
reference desks about training sessions which are
being offered this autumn.
