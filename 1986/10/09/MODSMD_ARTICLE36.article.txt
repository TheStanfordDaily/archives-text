# Online Database Searching...
## 
### 
One aspect of reference service is
computerized searching of online
databases. This service, called the
Computer Search Service, provides access to
hundreds of online databases, some of which
correspond to familiar printed indexing and
abstracting sources. A computer search of
appropriate databases can often save you time and
effort as well as provide you with a means of
accessing information that printed indexes cannot.
Covering virtually all fields, the databases
provide references to published articles, books,
conference proceedings, technical reports,
government documents, etc., and in some cases
the actual data or text.
Each computer search is a collaborative effort
between a librarian/search analyst, who has a
knowledge of available databases and computer
protocols with which to search them, and a
researcher. A search is arranged by appointment

and there generally is a fee, although financial
assistance is available. Staff at public service
desks throughout the library system or the Data
Services Librarian at Green Library (725-1055)
will be happy to provide you with further
information about this service.
