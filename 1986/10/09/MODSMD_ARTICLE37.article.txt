# Card Catalogs...
## 
### 
The card catalog located near the
entrance to the East Wing of Green
Library contains cards listing most
holdings of the Libraries of Stanford. It provides
multiple access points (author, title and subject)
to books, journals, and other materials held by
most Stanford Libraries. For materials in Jackson
School of Business Library, Lane Medical
Library, Robert Crown Law Library, and the
Hoover Institution Library only one access point
(usually author or title) is given. Cards listing
the holdings of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Library are not included in this catalog. More
over, the catalog does not contain cards for books
in the Meyer Library (all of Meyer's holdings
appear in Socrates) nor for most of the holdings
of the Jonsson Library of Government
Documents. Finally, much of the non-book
materials (printed music, sound recordings, manu
scripts and archives, technical reports, audio
visual materials, etc.) held by the Stanford
University Libraries are not represented in this
catalog.
Branch libraries and the Coordinate libraries
have card catalogs which provide access to many
materials housed in those individual libraries.
