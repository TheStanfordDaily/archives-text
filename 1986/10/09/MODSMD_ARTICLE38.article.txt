Borrowing Materials: Borrowing
regulations have been developed to meet the
varying research and instructional needs of
faculty, students, and other members of the
Stanford community. Loan periods range from
two weeks to an academic year. All eligible
borrowers must present appropriate identification
cards to check out library materials. Current
University ID cards serve as library cards for
faculty, students, and staff. For specific
information, contact the Privileges Desk in the
East Wing of Green Library (723-1491) or the
loan desks of the other libraries.
Recalling Materials: If the material
you need is charged to another borrower who has
used the material for at least two weeks, most
campus libraries will recall the material for you.
Recall slips are available at the circulation desk
in each library. Recalls generally take about
seven days. If material you have charged out is
recalled, return the materials promptly for the use
of others. Fines for overdue recalls are high,
since another person is inconvenienced by the
delay.
Renewing Loans: Procedures for
renewing charged materials vary according to
your university status (faculty, student, etc.) and
to the regulations of the particular libraiy from
which the material was borrowed.
Returning Materials: To avoid fines
for lost or overdue library materials, always
return charged materials on time to the library
from which the material was borrowed.
