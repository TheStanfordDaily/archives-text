### 
Research Libraries Group: The
Research Libraries Group (RLG) is a consortium
of over 35 major research institutions and
libraries including Stanford, Yale, Columbia, the
New York Public Library, University of
Michigan, UC Berkeley, Princeton, Cornell, and
University of Pennsylvania. RLG member
institutions may borrow materials from each
others' collections with minimal restrictions. The
RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network)
database provides access to the cataloging records
(currently over 10 million and growing rapidly)
of the members' collections and can be searched
by reference desk staff. In addition to interlibrary
loan, faculty and students of RLG member
institutions have on-site access privileges at
fellow member libraries.
Interlibrary Loan: Faculty, registered
students, and staff may submit interlibrary loan
requests for materials that are not available at
Stanford but which are needed for research.
Forms are available at the Reference Desk in
Green and at public service desks in the other
libraries. The requests should be submitted in
person at the desk where the forms were obtained.
The Interlibrary Loan Service of the Stanford
University Libraries (located on the first floor of
Green East) is able to acquire about 85% of the
requested items, and many of those requests are
filled within two weeks from RLG libraries.

U.C. Berkeley/Stanford
Research Library Cooperative
Program: This program makes the
library resources of the U.C. Berkeley and the
Stanford University Libraries available to faculty,
academic staff, and currently registered graduate
students from both institutions. The program
provides participants with reciprocal borrowing
privileges at both campuses, campus to campus
delivery of materials, and access to one another's
bibliographic records. Registered participants can
request materials directly from Berkeley by
dialing 964-BAKER on a special toll free tele
phone in Green Library. Materials will be
delivered to the Green Loan Desk where materials
can be picked up and returned. To register for the
program, contact the Privileges Desk in Green
Library. A brochure on the program is available
at public service desks.
Gutenberg Express: The Gutenberg
Express provides transportation between the
Stanford and Berkeley campuses. The bus makes
two runs each day, Monday through Friday
(except holidays). Departure times from Stanford
are 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. The bus leaves
from the Green Library service vehicle area
between Hoover and Green Library. The bus
departs Berkeley for Stanford from the West
Circle on Oxford Street at 7 a.m. and 3:45 p.m.
The trip takes approximately 1-1 1/2 hours, and
the cost is $2.25 (exact change is required) per
passenger one way. Passengers can pay at the
bus or purchase a booklet of eight coupons at
the Central Berkeley Garage, 4952 Oxford Street,
Berkeley. Passengers must have current Stanford
or UC Berkeley identification.
