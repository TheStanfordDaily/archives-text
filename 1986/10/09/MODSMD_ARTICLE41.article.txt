# PRESERVATION
## 
### 
Stanford University Libraries are committedto the preservation of library materials.
You can help by...

1. Making notes on separate paper rather than
defacing library materials with pen, pencil, or
highlighter notations.
2. Handling bound materials gently when
photocopying to prevent breaking the bindings.

3. Enjoying food and drink away from library
materials to avoid damage from spills and pest
irrfestation.
4. Protecting library materials from inclement
weather and returning materials to the desk rather
than book drops whenever possible.

5. Removing books from shelves by pushing
adjacent volumes back and grasping by the sides
to avoid pulling them at the top of the spine.
6. Reporting any existing damage so that it can
be repaired properly. Home remedies of scotch
tape and glue will only compound damage.
