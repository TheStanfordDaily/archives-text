# COLLECTIONS:
## SCIENCE & ENGINEERING 
### 
The bulk of the University Libraries
collections in science and engineering
are assembled in the seven branch
libraries described below. In each a reference
librarian is available to provide information and
bibliographic assistance in the use of the
collections.
Biology Library (Falconer)
(Biological Science Center, Herrin Building, 3rd
floor, Lisa Brainard, Acting Head Librarian; 723-
1528): The Falconer Biology Library contains
over 78,000 volumes, including 2,000 serials
titles. There is a strong emphasis in the areas of
cell and developmental biology, genetic and
molecular biology, and population biology. The
Jasper Ridge Papers and the Senior Honors
Papers are two small special collections main
tained in the library. Photocopy machines are
available in the library including a photocopy
service provided by the the Biology Department.
Chemistry Library (Swain) (Until
Winter Quarter, Old Chemistry Building, ground
floor; after the beginning of Winter Quarter, the
west end of the Organic Chemistry Buidling;
Lisa Brainard, Head Librarian; 723-9237): The
Swain Chemistry and Chemical Engineering
Library houses collections in catalysis, fluid
mechanics, bio-engineering, polymers, and
surface science, kinetics, electrochemistry,
organic, inorganic, physical and biophysical
chemistry and chemical engineering. The library
also maintains collections of dissertations earned
by Stanford chemistry and chemical engineering
students since 1950 and a large collection of
catalogs from the chemical supply companies.

Earth Sciences Library
(Branner) (Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building, 2nd floor; Charlotte Derksen, Head
Librarian; 723-2746): The Branner Library
supports the undergraduate, graduate and special
programs of the School of Earth Sciences. Its
collections include current and retrospective
materials in all fields of applied earth sciences,
geology, geophysics, and petroleum engineering.
State and foreign geological, hydrological,
natural hazards, and natural resources maps and
topographical quadrangles of the U.S. Geological
Survey form a large part of the 91,000 sheet map
collection. Reports produced by the School of
Earth Sciences are also kept on file.
Engineering Library (Terman
Engineering Center, 2nd-4th floors; Eleanor
Goodchild, Curator and Head Librarian; 723-
9164): The 70,000 volume collection of the
Engineering Library includes research material for
research in Aeronautics and Astronautics,
Electrical Engineering , Mechanical Engineering,
Engineering-Economics Systems, Materials
Science and Engineering, Civil Engineering,
Industrial Engineering, and Operations Research.
In addition to reference materials, monographs
and serials, the library houses a large number of
technical reports both in hard copy and
microfiche. Course reserves, including a large
number of videotapes, are available at the loan
desk.
Hopkins Marine Station Library
(Pacific Grove, CA; Alan Baldridge, Head
Librarian; 408/373-0464): The library of the
Hopkins Marine Station is housed in the
Monterey Boatworks building, beside Monterey
Bay, on the Station's Pacific Grove campus 90
miles from Stanford. The collection includes the
University Libraries' major holdings in marine
biology with special emphasis on biological

rhythms, developmental biology, marine botany,
marine ecology, marine zoology, neurobiology,
and the physiology of marine organisms.
Holdings are listed in Socrates as well as in the
main catalog in Green Library. Users interested
in obtaining these materials should contact staff
in the Falconer Biology Library, the Branner
Earth Sciences Library, or Interlibrary Services at
Green, or call Alan Baldridge directly.
Mathematical and Computer
Sciences Library (Sloan Mathematics
Center, Building 380, 4th floor; Henry Lowood,
Acting Head Librarian; 723-4672): The collection
of the Mathematical and Computer Science
Library contains materials on pure and applied
mathematics, statistics, operations research, and
computer science. Computer Science materials
emphasis programming languages, artifical
intelligence, computer architecture, database
management, and computer graphics. The
collection includes a large number of technical
reports obtained through exchange agreements
with other universities and research institutions.
Graduate reserves materials for courses in
mathematics, statistics, computer science, and
operations research, including both books and
videotapes, are located here.
Physics Library (Varian Building, 3rd
floor, Henry Lowood, Head Librarian; 723-4392):
The collections of the Physics Library include
more than 40,000 volumes of books and journals
covering the fields of high energy physics, low
temperature physics, nuclear physics, theoretical
physics, plasma physics, solid state physics,
astronomy and astrophysics. The library
cooperates closely with the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center Library, particularly in the use
of technical reports and reprints.
