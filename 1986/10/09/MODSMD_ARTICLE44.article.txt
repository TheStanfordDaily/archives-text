### 
T' he Coordinate Libraries directly serve
the school or institution of which they
are a part and, like the University
Libraries, are open to all members of the Stanford
community.
Hoover Institution Library and
Archives (Neil McElroy, Reference Librarian;
723-2058): The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an interdisciplinary
research center for advanced study on political,
social, economic, and educational change in the
20th century. The Institution's library, which
contains about 1.6 milion volumes, is one of the
largest specialized research collections in the
United States, with outstanding area collections
on Africa, East Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia and
the Soviet Union, Latin America, the Middle East,
North America, and Western Europe (see "Foreign
Language and Area Collections," page 5). The
Institution also has one of the nation's largest
private archives, with nearly four thousand
individual collections consisting of the papers of
leading individuals and organizations in politics,
education, journalism, scholarship, and the
military.

J. Hugh Jackson Library of
Graduate School of Business (Hannah
Roos, Reference Librarian; 723-2162): The
Jackson Library supports study and research in
accounting, finance, marketing, economic
analysis and policy, computer and information
systems, decision science, international business,
public management, organizational behavior, and
management of the total enterprise. The collec
tion contains more than 300,000 cataloged items
as well as several hundred thousand corporate
reports, a periodicals collection with approxi
mately 2,300 titles of current subscriptions, and
more than 500,000 corporate 10K and annual
reports on microfiche. Professional librarians are
on duty at the Reference Desk to assist in using
the collection.
Lane Medical Library (Valerie Su,
Reference Librarian; 723-6691): Lane Medical
Library's collection includes approximately
300,000 books and nearly 3,000 periodical titles
covering clinical medicine and its specialties,
basic science, public health, nurisng, and related
fields. This year, Lane is installing a new inte
grated library system which will provide public
access to the online catalog and which will also
computerize the library's circulation system.

Tours, which include an introduction to using
some of the basic reference tools, are given every
Wednesday at 12:30 and at other times by
appointment.
Robert Crown Law Library (Paul
Lomio, Reference Librarian; 723-2477): The Law

of Anglo-American law, international law, and
foreign law. The collection includes books,
journals, reports, statues (codes and session laws),
digests, advance sheets, loose-leaf services, and
pamphlets as well as a wide variety of reference
books. Due to the nature and use of law materials
much of the collection does not circulate although
materials may be charged out to carrels for
continuing research. Monographic titles from the
Anglo-American subject collection and the foreign
and international collections do circulate.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center

428-2411): Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
Library has a collection of books and journals
centering on high energy physics. It has an
extensive collection of reports and preprints in
