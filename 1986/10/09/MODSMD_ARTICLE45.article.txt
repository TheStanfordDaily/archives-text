# FOREIGN LANGUAGE & AREA STUDIES

### 
Collecting responsibility for Foreign
Language and Area Studies has been
divided between the Hoover Institu
tion Library and Green Library. In both libraries
curators who have built and shaped outstanding
research collections in these fields are available
for consultation and reference assistance.
Africana: The African Collections at
Stanford are primarily housed in Green and
Hoover with other components of the collection
found in branch libraries. All African news
papers and a pamphlet collection are in Hoover as
are most of the archival collections. The Hoover
Library's collection has extensive holdings on the
colonial and independence period as well as
important collections on sub-Saharan Africa.
Subjects include history from 1880 to date,
politics, and economics. Materials dealing with
anthropology, linguistics, literature, geography
as well as pre-colonial, colonial, and current
history, politics and economics are found in
Green Library. Karen Fung, Deputy Curator of
the African Collections, is available for reference
assistance, Hoover Tower, Rm. 212, 725-3505.
Central European Materials:
Central European Collections in Green, covering
Germany, Austria, Switzerland and their
neighbors, contain extensive resources in many
formats. A Guide to Germanic Collections is
available in the Green Library. The Germanic
Collections Curator, Peter R. Frank (Green
Library 172E, 723-4602), and his assistants are
ready to answer questions from patrons relating
to research in this area.
The Central European Collections at the
Hoover Institution offer a strong collection on
German participation in the two World Wars, and
include extensive archival material on the Nazi
party. Current acquisitions stress the field of
government and politics, especially in the two
German states. Agnes F. Peterson is available
for reference in Room 214, Hoover Tower, 725-
3595.
East Asian Collection: The East
Asian Collection housed in the Hoover
Institution is unique in the Western World.
Planned while World War II was still raging, it
was launched by an extensive acquisitions
program in China and Japan during the early
postwar years. The collection has fostered an
imaginative and varied research program, with
emphasis on relations between the United States
and Asia in the 20th century. Within this larger
frame of reference, attention is given to the
internal affairs of Asian nations, particularly
China and Japan, and to their relations with each
other. The collection includes approximately
153,800 titles and unusually comprehensive
serial holdings. Most basic English language
materials are housed in Green Library. Ramon
Myers (Lou Henry Hoover Building, 725-3441)
is Curator of the East Asian Collection.

Latin American and Iberian
Collections: Green Library has an
active acquisition program for both current and
out-of-print materials from all of the countries of
Latin America and from Spain and Portugal. The
collections are particularly strong in the social
sciences, history, and literature, and for study and
research on Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile,
Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. Current efforts
focus on Central American and Caribbean
collections. Reference assistance is available
during posted office hours and by appointment
from James Breedlove (Green Library 172 C, 723-
9142), curator of Green Library's Latin American
and Iberian Collections, or from his assistants
Deborah Bundy and Maria Leal (723-9413).
The Hoover Institution's Latin American
Collection includes outstanding holdings on
Castro's Cuba and on the Peron regimes in
Argentina. The curator is William Ratliff, who
is available for research assistance in Room 203,
Hoover Tower, 723-2106. Materials stressing
20th century government and politics in Spain
and Portugal are also collected with special
emphasis on the Spanish Civil War, the two
World Wars, the Revolution of Flowers in
Portual of 1974, and the restitution of democracy
in Spain since 1975. Agnes F. Peterson (Room
214, Hoover Tower, 725-3595) is happy to
provide reference assistance in this area.
Mexican American Materials: The
Mexican American Collections at Stanford
include both primary and secondary source
materials that support both teaching and graduate
level research. The collections are primarily
housed within the Green Library. The
collections document the Mexican American
experience in the United States from both
historical and contemporary perspectives.
Research materials include such microfilm
archives as the Spanish, Mexican, and Territorial
records for New Mexico dating from 1621 to
1912, and such contemporary data as are available
from the 1980 U.S. Census on the Spanish
speaking population. The Mexican American
Curator, Roberto G. Trujillo, as well as Janet
Goitia as collection development specialist, are
available for reference assistance in the Green
Library, Room 172 A, 723-3150 or 723-9412.

Middle East Collection: Collections
in the major languages of the Middle East -
Arabic, Persian, Turkish (modern and Ottoman)
are housed in the Hoover Library. Western
language materials on the Middle East are found
in Green Library and other campus libraries, as
well as in the Hoover Library. The Hoover
Middle East Collection emphasizes 20th century
history, politics, economics, military affairs,
social change, and current affairs, but also
includes holdings on Islam and Arabic literature.
The Hoover Institution also makes available
Middle Eastern serials and newspapers in Arabic,
Persian, Turkish, and Western languages. For
information and assistance, contact Edward Jajko,
Middle East Bibliographer, Room 211, Hoover
Tower, 723-2050.
Slavic and East European
Collections: The Slavic and East
European Collections at Stanford are housed in
two primary locations: Green Library and the
Hoover Institution Library. The Hoover
Library's holdings consist of more than 400,000
volumes in the fields of 20th century history,
politics, economics, sociology and other social
sciences. In addition, the Hoover Institution's
archives have extensive archival holdings in this
area. The Green Library collections cover other
fields and periods in the social sciences and
humanities. Green collections in Slavic
language, literature, and history are among the
most important in the country. Both Hoover and
Green Libraries maintain outstanding reference
collections. At Green Library bibliographic
service is provided by Wojciech Zalewski,
Curator for Slavic and East European Collections
(Green Library 172F, 723-9274), or one of his
assistants. At the Hoover Institution biblio
graphic assistance is available from Joseph D.
Dwyer (723-2066) and Maciej M. Siekierski, and
Slavic reference librarian Hilja Kukk.
Other Western European
Collections: Centered on French and
Italian studies, Green Library's holdings in this
area are especially strong in literary criticism,
social history, and popular culture from the early
modern to the modem period. The collections
have been enhanced in recent years by acquisition
of a large number of Italian biographies, several
Renaissance manuscripts, and a variety of video
materials and machine-readable data files.
Curator of Romance Languages and Humanities,
Mary Jane Parrine (Green Library 172 D, 723-
9481), provides information on the collections
during regular office hours and by appointment.
The Romance office is staffed by knowledgeable
library specialists who are also able to answer
reference questions.
Materials stressing government and politics of
20th century France, Belgium, and Italy, are
collected at the Hoover Institution. Special
emphasis is placed on the Fascist period in Italy,
the two world wars, and the French Fifth
Republic. Agnes F. Peterson will be happy to
provide reference assistance in Room 214,
Hoover Tower, 725-3595.


The archives of the Mexican American Legal
