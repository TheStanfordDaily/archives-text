Action Boxes: User comments and
recommendations are encouraged and will receive
prompt attention by library staff. "Action
Boxes" are located in the catalog area in the East
Wing of Green and on the second floor of Meyer.
Similar boxes are located in other campus
libraries. Suggestions can also be directed to the
library via the Socrates "Suggest" command.
Responses to comments are posted on a bulletin
board in the hallway between the East and West
Wings in Green Library and near the stairway on
the second floor in Meyer Library. If you include
your name and address, we will respond to you
directly.
Computer Workstations: There are
two clusters of IBM micro-computers in Green
Library. A cluster of six IBM Personal Compu
ters is available for use by Stanford students,
faculty and staff. Printing facilities are not
available at this cluster and users supply their
own software. The other cluster, which consists
of six IBM ATs and printing facilities, is for the
use of graduate students working on their disser
tations. To use either cluster you must present
identification at the Green Loan Desk. Three
terminals are available in Green Library
communications rooms (located near the main
stairway on each level in the East Wing) for
unrestricted use by those with I.T.S. or Socrates
accounts.

Use of the microcomputer clusters in the
Meyer and Engineering Libraries is primarily for
those students with course assignments requiring
use of the computers. If machines are available,
other students, facutly, or staff may use them.
Lockers: Lockers in the Green Library are
available to provide patrons with secure places to
keep personal belongings while using the library
and to hold properly checked out library materials
between visits to the library. All lockers
assignments are made by the Stack Division
(room 42A, lower level, Green East). Locker
assignments must be renewed each quarter.
Photocopy: Photocopy machines are
located throughout the library system. Copies
cost $.10 each. Change machines are located
near photocopy machines. Using a COPICARD,
a plastic card similar to a credit card, eliminates
the need to have correct change and offers reduced
rates for volume purchasers. COPICARDS may
be purchased in denominations ranging from 100-
5,000 copies at Nuts & Mudd in Terman, or in
Green Library at the COPICARD sales office
(hours: Monday-Thursday, 1:00-4:30 p.m.). The
Photocopy Center, located at the Graduate School
of Business, may be used for large copying jobs
or when high quality copying is desired.

Services for the Physically
Limited: The University Libraries staff is
committed to providing the opportunity for all
members of the Stanford community to benefit
fully from library resources and services. The
Green and Meyer libraries are accessible to
persons with limited mobility and the public
service staff will be happy to provide these
patrons with hints on accessing the collections.
Not all branch libraries are readily accessible, so
physically limited patrons should call ahead to
make arrangements that are mutually satisfac
tory. All libraries provide paging services.
Telephones: Pay phones and courtesy
phones for free calling within the University are
located throughout the Green and Meyer libraries.
Such phones are also generally available in
buildings where branch libraries are located.
Please ask at the service desks in the branch
libraries for more information.
Typewriters: Three coin-operated, self
correcting, electric typewriters are available for
use on the second floor of the Meyer Library.
Vending Machines: Although food is
not allowed in the libraries, refreshment is
available close by. Snack and beverage machines
are located on the first floor of the Meyer Library
and in the Terman Engineering Center.
