# Union remodelling delayed by 2 years
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
At least two more years will pass before the
planned renovation of Tresidder Union is started.
A severe shortage of space in the Computer Sci
ence Department has led the Provost's Office to
request an extension of its interim agreeement
with Tresidder to house computer facilities in the
old bowling alley, according to Ellie Oppenheim,
director of Tresidder Union.
Originally, the Union had planned to request
concept and site approval for planned changes
from the I'Diversity Board of Trustees this winter
quarter.
Student leaders were critical of this new delay
in Tresidder renovation.
Citing the existence of only one student union,
Council of Presidents member Carey White said it
was amazing that the University could not find
space for a complete student union and for the
Computer Science Department.
"Students want this plan," White said. "It has
been in the works for six years."
According to White, the renovations would also
have alleviated the present shortage of student of
fice spaces.
Tresidder was the only option that the Univer
sity had in creating extra computer space, said
Ray Bacchetti, director of the University Budget.
"Every inch of (eligible computer) space on
campus that I know of is being used," he said.
Bacchetti added that the Tresidder plan was still
in its initial stages. It never generated broad Uni
versity support, and it needed a very large quan
tity of funds to implement the project, he said.
One compromise solution considered by
Tresidder is to build a two-story addition on top
of the patio which could temporarily house the
computer department. This proposal would allow
Tresidder to continue with its renovation plans
and give the Computer Science Department a
place to operate, Oppenheim said.
Oppenheim added that the delay will not
prevent Tresidder from creating a new student
lounge on the second floor, providing students
with a warm, comfortable place to meet. Plans for
revisions of the first floor lobby will continue as

well, she said.
Original renovation plans included moving the
Coffee House to the site of the present computer
facilities, moving The Store to the Coffee House,
moving the Corner Pocket to the present site of
The Store and enlarging the current Tresidder
kitchen.
Plans for the new store included building extra
shelf space, selling fresh fruit, fresh-baked breads,
dairy products and renting VCR.v The Coffee
House would have occupied a much larger space,
and the Corner Pocket would have been next to
the kitchen.
Two years ago, Tresidder offerred its space to
LOTS under the assumption that the computers
would leave by March 1987. The University
originally designed Sweet Hall to alleviate the
shortage of computer facilities, but the new un
dergraduate computer science major has led to
unanticipated space demands, Oppenheim said.
Although this new interim agreement lasts until
1988, it may take five to 10 years for an alternative
computer site to be built on the Near West
Campus, said the Tresidder newsletter this
month.
Bacchetti said that the future of the computer
facilities after 1988 was an "unsolved problem."
Last February, the Academic Senate established
three new computer related majors — Computer
Science, Computer Systems Engineering and
Symbolic Systems — according to Prof. Nils
Nilsson, chairman of the Computer Science De
partment.
According to Nilsson, the new majors have put
excessive space demands on an already crowded
department. The department has a total of 50,000
square-feet at all its facilities including Tresidder
and would need another 25,000 square feet just to
decompress into an acceptable working environ
ment.
An additional 25,000 square-feet of space will
be needed to satisfy the department's expected
short-term growth, Nilsson said.
Currently, computer science facilities include
Sweet Hall, Margaret Jacks Hall, Cedar Hall, the
computer laboratories on Welch Road and the
Iresidder facility. When the Academic
Senate declared the new majors, no
new facilities were assigned to the
Computer Science Department.
Last year, 150 students pursued the
Mathematics and Computation Science
major, and Nilsson predicts that 200 or
300 additional students may now major
in a computer-related field. To prepare
the department for this dramatic
growth, the l'nive r< *i rv

several courses and professors. These
additions will take up even more
space, Nilsson said
According to Les Earnest, associate
chairman of the Computer Science De
partment, "Jacks Hall is so crowded
that some Ph.D. students don't even
have desks."
COP member Mary Thurber ques
tioned why the computer department
was using the student facilities in the
first place She said a student union
should be a place where students can
come to meet, relax and have fun. Now
they have to go to the dorms, she said

An additional 25,000 square-feet of space will
be needed to satisfy the department's expected
short-term growth, Nilsson said.
Currently, computer science facilities include
Sweet Hall, Margaret Jacks Hall, Cedar Hall, the
computer laboratories on Welch Road and the
Iresidder facility. When the Academic
Senate declared the new majors, no
new facilities were assigned to the
Computer Science Department.

major, and Nilsson predicts that 200 or
300 additional students may now major

At least two more years will pass before the
planned renovation of Tresidder Union is started.
A severe shortage of space in the Computer Sci
ence Department has led the Provost's Office to
request an extension of its interim agreeement
with Tresidder to house computer facilities in the
old bowling alley, according to Ellie Oppenheim,
director of Tresidder Union.
Originally, the Union had planned to request
concept and site approval for planned changes
from the I'Diversity Board of Trustees this winter
quarter.
Student leaders were critical of this new delay
in Tresidder renovation.
Citing the existence of only one student union,
Council of Presidents member Carey White said it
was amazing that the University could not find
space for a complete student union and for the
Computer Science Department.
"Students want this plan," White said. "It has
been in the works for six years."
According to White, the renovations would also
have alleviated the present shortage of student of
fice spaces.
Tresidder was the only option that the Univer
sity had in creating extra computer space, said
Ray Bacchetti, director of the University Budget.
"Every inch of (eligible computer) space on
campus that I know of is being used," he said.
Bacchetti added that the Tresidder plan was still
in its initial stages. It never generated broad Uni
versity support, and it needed a very large quan
tity of funds to implement the project, he said.
One compromise solution considered by
Tresidder is to build a two-story addition on top
of the patio which could temporarily house the
computer department. This proposal would allow
Tresidder to continue with its renovation plans
and give the Computer Science Department a
place to operate, Oppenheim said.
Oppenheim added that the delay will not
prevent Tresidder from creating a new student
lounge on the second floor, providing students
with a warm, comfortable place to meet. Plans for
revisions of the first floor lobby will continue as

well, she said.
Original renovation plans included moving the
Coffee House to the site of the present computer
facilities, moving The Store to the Coffee House,
moving the Corner Pocket to the present site of
The Store and enlarging the current Tresidder
kitchen.
Plans for the new store included building extra
shelf space, selling fresh fruit, fresh-baked breads,
dairy products and renting VCR.v The Coffee
House would have occupied a much larger space,
and the Corner Pocket would have been next to
the kitchen.
Two years ago, Tresidder offerred its space to
LOTS under the assumption that the computers
would leave by March 1987. The University
originally designed Sweet Hall to alleviate the
shortage of computer facilities, but the new un
dergraduate computer science major has led to
unanticipated space demands, Oppenheim said.
Although this new interim agreement lasts until
1988, it may take five to 10 years for an alternative
computer site to be built on the Near West
Campus, said the Tresidder newsletter this
month.
Bacchetti said that the future of the computer
facilities after 1988 was an "unsolved problem."
Last February, the Academic Senate established
three new computer related majors — Computer
Science, Computer Systems Engineering and
Symbolic Systems — according to Prof. Nils
Nilsson, chairman of the Computer Science De
partment.
According to Nilsson, the new majors have put
excessive space demands on an already crowded
department. The department has a total of 50,000
square-feet at all its facilities including Tresidder
and would need another 25,000 square feet just to
decompress into an acceptable working environ
ment.
An additional 25,000 square-feet of space will
be needed to satisfy the department's expected
short-term growth, Nilsson said.
