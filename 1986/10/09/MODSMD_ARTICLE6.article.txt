# Academic ball serves all
## 
### KACEY FITZPATRICK 
For years Stanford students were made to feel as if they
were on one long snipe hunt as they ran madly between
scattered, obscure nooks of the campus in their search for
information about academic opportunities, research pro
grams and grants, overseas studies, seminars, computers
and basic advising.
No more. Sweet Hall — located between Stern Hall and
Meyer Library — gathers these student services under one
roof.
Construction of the new building was completed in Au
gust. According to Curtis Williams, director of Facilities and
Project Management, plans for the building began in the fall
of 19HS, with two goals in mind initially: first, to quicklv pro
vide a facility to house the large Low Overhead Time
Sharing (LOTS) system and other computer-based services,
and second, to build that facilitv as inexpensivelv as possi
ble.
The space on which Sweet Hall was built is a prime site,
according to Williams.
"There is not much empty space in the center of campus,
so the idea was to maximize use of this facility," he explains.
That is why a project that began at 30,000 square feet now
covers SO,OOO square feet and houses almost all student in
formational services.
Director of LJndergraduate Advising Audrey Bernfield is
enthusiastic about the new facilitv.

Recently completed Sweet Hall brings together under one roof a host of aca
demic service offices previously scattered ahout campus.
"We hope that students come en
masse to see the services offered at
Sweet Hall," she says. "We provide a
huge variety of services. I don't think
advising has ever been better."
The services now centered in Sweet
Hall are many in number and diverse
in nature:
Undergraduate Advising Center
The Undergraduate Advising Center
(UAC) is a resource center for under
graduates who need specific answers
to educational questions. UAC does not

provide alternative academic advisers
for students but does function as a sup
plement by working with regular ad
visers.
With both a premed and a prelaw
adviser, UAC is prepared to advise stu
dents individually as they contemplate
entering professional fields. UAC also
sponsors day fairs like "A Majors
Event," which can help students clarify
their choices of a major.
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities
Undergraduate Research Opportuni

ties (URO) was started in 1974 to
facilitate interaction between under
graduates and faculty members.
"Stanford has excellence in its un
dergraduate education on the one
hand, and it has excellence in its re
search faculty on the other hand," says
Laura Zelznick, director of URO. "The
purpose of the URO program is to
combine the two of them so that un
dergraduates can take advantage of the
research faculty, and so that the re
search faculty can have better contact
with the students."
Faculty members from all depart
ments of the university conduct re
search projects throughout the year.
Students can earn University credit — or
sometimes salary — while also getting
valuable hands-on experience in their
field of interest. Descriptions of the
projects and job openings are listed in
URO on the first floor of Sweet Hall.

In January 1985, according to
Zelznick, the URO began "a second
phase" of activity, making research
grants available to students.
Three kinds of grants are offered to
Stanford undergraduates. The Fire
stone Major Grant is for extended re
search in the social sciences and natu
ral sciences. The Golden Grant is
available for humanities scholarship
and artistic creation. Small Grants pro
vide up to $500 for research expenses.
For both the Firestone and the Golden
grants, students must commit them
selves to their proposed projects
during at least three academic quar
ters, and the maximum award is
$2,500.
Last year Stanford awarded 11
Golden Grants, 25 Firestone Grants
and 75 Small Grants.
The grants represent honors proj
ects which get students more deeply

involved in research and understand
ing a specified subject of interest. They
offer an opportunity to break away
from the structured education of the
freshman and sophomore years.
Projects for 1986 Golden Grant win
ners include junior Brigid Doherty's
"Independent Painting Study in Berlin:
An Experiment in Figurative Expres
sionism," and junior Teresa Mary
McCarthy's "Gaelic Influences in Flann
O'Brien." One student is writing a play,
and another is writing a novella. Nich
olas Schiff, a junior, received financial
backing for his honor's thesis in the
history of modern brain research.
Titles of Firestone Grant projects in
clude junior James Chang's
"Differential Gene Expression of Or
nithine Decarboxylase," based on tech
niques in molecular biology and ge
netic engineering. Thomas Ehrlich
man, a junior, traveled to a small

peasant town in the Andes in order to
study the resilience of natives to cul
tural change. Sophomore Charles
Jones is testing and applying a recently
developed geological dating method
in a project titled "Desert Varnish
Dating in Coastal Peru." Junior Susan
Peinhold is investigating "Patterns of
Women's Political Participation Before
and After the 1974 Portuguese Revolu
tion."
The third function of URO, in addi
tion to arranging student-faculty re
search and awarding grants for inde
pendent projects, is to make data
available to students electronically.
Folio is a massive computer system
which was developed as part of Project
Concourse, a three-year pilot study
begun in the fell of 1985 by Informa
tion Technology Services (ITS) with a
grant from IBM. The project will e.\
periment and evaluate what happens
in a university environment when aca
demic and reference materials are
made available electronically.
Folio includes all of Socrates and
Odyssey, as well as database for infor
mation on any subject, including off
campus rental housing. On Sept. 30, a
brand new file went public. It lists all
the research interests or involvements
of each faculty member and can be
continually updated.
Soon to be available are additional
files with information on scholarships
and fellowships for graduate study
University public events, San Mateo
community service organizations, Hay
Area environmental services, I'niver
sity job openings and Harvard business
Review abstracts, as well as student,
faculty and staff directories
Information and Research
Information Systems
The staff of Information and Re
search Information Systems (IKIS) is
now located on the third floor of Sweet
Hall. IRIS provides students and faculty
with information about computing on
campus.
The IRIS microcomputer evaluation
lab (formerly called Elmer and located
in Forsythe Hall) contains various
kinds of computer equipment, includ
ing programming languages, word
processing, spread sheets and graph
ics. Visitors may experiment with the
systems in order to evaluate which is
best suited to their needs.

During the school war. IRIS plans to
offer several options tor learning about
computers, including seminars on cur
rent topics, tutorial material for inde
pendent study and formal courses.
Center for Teaching and Learning
The Center foi Teaching ind l earn
ing (CTL) can help students succeed in
a challenging university environment.
Work loads and pressures on students
are so great that high school study
habits often do not suffice
All students are given the right to
free academic peer tutoring. This
privilege allows up to eight hours of
tree tutoring per course pet quarter
The tutors are students who have
already taken the course in question
and received an "A Ideally, the tutors
know the course s instructors and can
give hints as to what tactics work best
and w hat areas should be emphasized.
According to Dr. Michele Fisher
director of CTL: "The Center for l each
ing and Learning actually serves a real
diverse selection of students, from the
'A student who wants to get an V to
the student w ho needs to develop bet
tei study habits now that the\ Ye on the
university level. \nd the tutors benefit
as well — they learn a subject even bet
ter when they get the chance to tutor
it."
Each quarter the CM. offers .1 one
unit Reading Rate Improvement
course, which will double a student s
reading rate while also increasing
comprehension It teaches methods
for skimming, critical reading reten
tion and analvsis of mater ial

Offered foi two units even quarter
is .1 Learning Strategies course, de
signed to increase the qualitv and pn>
ductivit\ of time and effort spent on
an\ activity.
Included in the course are sessions
on time management, sell
management, note-taking, memory,
concentration, textbook studv, dealing
wnli anxiety, test preparation, logical
structures, research paper preparation
and identification of priorities. The

course is integrated into a student s
schedule so that time is spent applying
strategies directl\ to the participant s
other courses.

Overseas Studies
Stanford's Overseas Studies Program
began 2S years ago and lias grown to
the extent that now one-third of Stan
ford students (600 "00 per \ear) stud\
abroad for at least one quarter. This
percentage is much higher than that of
other institutions.
The University of California-
Berkeley, known for its excellent over
seas program, sends a total of onh five

percent of its students abroad each
year. In addition, the I C-Berkeley pro
gram is very competitive, requiring
that students be fluent in the language

and commit themselves to an entire
year.
Stanford wants to think of our stu
dents .is leaders of the world ... as
leaders of California and as leaders of
the* Tinted States, sa\ s Nancy Padgett,
deput\ director of the Overseas
Studies Program Its important to
have .i multi-cultural perspective be
cause the world and all of society is
multi cultural
Padgett adds: "It's important and

desirable to see your interests first
hand. Our roots and the roots of every
thing we stud\ are in Europe. What
happens in San Francisco and New

York is just a derivative.
"Students interested in design and
fashion go to Italy Those interested in
medicine might go to England. Tech
nology majors might study in Berlin.
Others may go to Paris tor the arts.
There are centers for all disciplines,
and the faculty of every department at
Stanford has contacts all over the
world.
Innovative Academic Courses
Innovative Academic Courses con
sists of three programs which offer aca
demic opportunities in topics not
available through regular departmen
tal classes.
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) encourage stu
dents to explore their personal and po
litical values and to develop educa
tional goals. All workshops include an
action project outside of the class
room, with the aim of building skills
and confidence while allowing stu
dents to see the effects of their action
in the community. SVC'OPSI offers
some 3-4 week mini-courses for one
unit each.
Fresh man-Sophomore Seminars
(FSS) are taught by Stanford lecturers
and are usually limited to enrollments
of 10 students. They investigate well
defined problems and questions, del
ving deeply into current issues.
Undergraduate Special Courses
(UGS) fills gaps in the undergraduate
curriculum, offering topics from
"Working Effectively with Disturbed
Children" to "Truth is 24 Frames a
Second: Analyzing Classic Movies." The
courses are often organized and taught
by community members or students.
Information about all Innovative
Acacemic Courses can be obtained on
the first floor of Sweet Hall.

Innovative Academic Courses
Innovative Academic Courses con
sists of three programs which offer aca
demic opportunities in topics not
available through regular departmen
tal classes.
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) encourage stu
dents to explore their personal and po
litical values and to develop educa
tional goals. All workshops include an
action project outside of the class
room, with the aim of building skills
and confidence while allowing stu
dents to see the effects of their action
in the community. SVC'OPSI offers
some 3-4 week mini-courses for one
unit each.
Fresh man-Sophomore Seminars
(FSS) are taught by Stanford lecturers
and are usually limited to enrollments
of 10 students. They investigate well
defined problems and questions, del
ving deeply into current issues.
Undergraduate Special Courses
(UGS) fills gaps in the undergraduate
curriculum, offering topics from
"Working Effectively with Disturbed
Children" to "Truth is 24 Frames a
Second: Analyzing Classic Movies." The
courses are often organized and taught
by community members or students.
Information about all Innovative
Acacemic Courses can be obtained on
the first floor of Sweet Hall.

For years Stanford students were made to feel as if they
were on one long snipe hunt as they ran madly between
scattered, obscure nooks of the campus in their search for
information about academic opportunities, research pro
grams and grants, overseas studies, seminars, computers
and basic advising.
No more. Sweet Hall — located between Stern Hall and
Meyer Library — gathers these student services under one
roof.
Construction of the new building was completed in Au
gust. According to Curtis Williams, director of Facilities and
Project Management, plans for the building began in the fall
of 19HS, with two goals in mind initially: first, to quicklv pro
vide a facility to house the large Low Overhead Time
Sharing (LOTS) system and other computer-based services,
and second, to build that facilitv as inexpensivelv as possi
ble.
The space on which Sweet Hall was built is a prime site,
according to Williams.
"There is not much empty space in the center of campus,
so the idea was to maximize use of this facility," he explains.
That is why a project that began at 30,000 square feet now
covers SO,OOO square feet and houses almost all student in
formational services.
Director of LJndergraduate Advising Audrey Bernfield is
enthusiastic about the new facilitv.

Recently completed Sweet Hall brings together under one roof a host of aca
demic service offices previously scattered ahout campus.
"We hope that students come en
masse to see the services offered at
Sweet Hall," she says. "We provide a
huge variety of services. I don't think
advising has ever been better."
The services now centered in Sweet
Hall are many in number and diverse
in nature:
Undergraduate Advising Center
The Undergraduate Advising Center
(UAC) is a resource center for under
graduates who need specific answers
to educational questions. UAC does not

provide alternative academic advisers
for students but does function as a sup
plement by working with regular ad
visers.
With both a premed and a prelaw
adviser, UAC is prepared to advise stu
dents individually as they contemplate
entering professional fields. UAC also
sponsors day fairs like "A Majors
Event," which can help students clarify
their choices of a major.
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities
Undergraduate Research Opportuni

ties (URO) was started in 1974 to
facilitate interaction between under
graduates and faculty members.
"Stanford has excellence in its un
dergraduate education on the one
hand, and it has excellence in its re
search faculty on the other hand," says
Laura Zelznick, director of URO. "The
purpose of the URO program is to
combine the two of them so that un
dergraduates can take advantage of the
research faculty, and so that the re
search faculty can have better contact
with the students."
Faculty members from all depart
ments of the university conduct re
search projects throughout the year.
Students can earn University credit — or
sometimes salary — while also getting
valuable hands-on experience in their
field of interest. Descriptions of the
projects and job openings are listed in
URO on the first floor of Sweet Hall.

In January 1985, according to
Zelznick, the URO began "a second
phase" of activity, making research
grants available to students.
Three kinds of grants are offered to
Stanford undergraduates. The Fire
stone Major Grant is for extended re
search in the social sciences and natu
ral sciences. The Golden Grant is
available for humanities scholarship
and artistic creation. Small Grants pro
vide up to $500 for research expenses.
For both the Firestone and the Golden
grants, students must commit them
selves to their proposed projects
during at least three academic quar
ters, and the maximum award is
$2,500.
Last year Stanford awarded 11
Golden Grants, 25 Firestone Grants
and 75 Small Grants.
The grants represent honors proj
ects which get students more deeply

involved in research and understand
ing a specified subject of interest. They
offer an opportunity to break away
from the structured education of the
freshman and sophomore years.
Projects for 1986 Golden Grant win
ners include junior Brigid Doherty's
"Independent Painting Study in Berlin:
An Experiment in Figurative Expres
sionism," and junior Teresa Mary
McCarthy's "Gaelic Influences in Flann
O'Brien." One student is writing a play,
and another is writing a novella. Nich
olas Schiff, a junior, received financial
backing for his honor's thesis in the
history of modern brain research.
Titles of Firestone Grant projects in
clude junior James Chang's
"Differential Gene Expression of Or
nithine Decarboxylase," based on tech
niques in molecular biology and ge
netic engineering. Thomas Ehrlich
man, a junior, traveled to a small

peasant town in the Andes in order to
study the resilience of natives to cul
tural change. Sophomore Charles
Jones is testing and applying a recently
developed geological dating method
in a project titled "Desert Varnish
Dating in Coastal Peru." Junior Susan
Peinhold is investigating "Patterns of
Women's Political Participation Before
and After the 1974 Portuguese Revolu
tion."
The third function of URO, in addi
tion to arranging student-faculty re
search and awarding grants for inde
pendent projects, is to make data
available to students electronically.
Folio is a massive computer system
which was developed as part of Project
Concourse, a three-year pilot study
begun in the fell of 1985 by Informa
tion Technology Services (ITS) with a
grant from IBM. The project will e.\
periment and evaluate what happens
in a university environment when aca
demic and reference materials are
made available electronically.
Folio includes all of Socrates and
Odyssey, as well as database for infor
mation on any subject, including off
campus rental housing. On Sept. 30, a
brand new file went public. It lists all
the research interests or involvements
of each faculty member and can be
continually updated.
Soon to be available are additional
files with information on scholarships
and fellowships for graduate study
University public events, San Mateo
community service organizations, Hay
Area environmental services, I'niver
sity job openings and Harvard business
Review abstracts, as well as student,
faculty and staff directories
Information and Research
Information Systems
The staff of Information and Re
search Information Systems (IKIS) is
now located on the third floor of Sweet
Hall. IRIS provides students and faculty
with information about computing on
campus.
The IRIS microcomputer evaluation
lab (formerly called Elmer and located
in Forsythe Hall) contains various
kinds of computer equipment, includ
ing programming languages, word
processing, spread sheets and graph
ics. Visitors may experiment with the
systems in order to evaluate which is
best suited to their needs.

During the school war. IRIS plans to
offer several options tor learning about
computers, including seminars on cur
rent topics, tutorial material for inde
pendent study and formal courses.
Center for Teaching and Learning
The Center foi Teaching ind l earn
ing (CTL) can help students succeed in
a challenging university environment.
Work loads and pressures on students
are so great that high school study
habits often do not suffice
All students are given the right to
free academic peer tutoring. This
privilege allows up to eight hours of
tree tutoring per course pet quarter
The tutors are students who have
already taken the course in question
and received an "A Ideally, the tutors
know the course s instructors and can
give hints as to what tactics work best
and w hat areas should be emphasized.
According to Dr. Michele Fisher
director of CTL: "The Center for l each
ing and Learning actually serves a real
diverse selection of students, from the
'A student who wants to get an V to
the student w ho needs to develop bet
tei study habits now that the\ Ye on the
university level. \nd the tutors benefit
as well — they learn a subject even bet
ter when they get the chance to tutor
it."
Each quarter the CM. offers .1 one
unit Reading Rate Improvement
course, which will double a student s
reading rate while also increasing
comprehension It teaches methods
for skimming, critical reading reten
tion and analvsis of mater ial

Offered foi two units even quarter

wnli anxiety, test preparation, logical
structures, research paper preparation
and identification of priorities. The

course is integrated into a student s
schedule so that time is spent applying
strategies directl\ to the participant s
other courses.

Overseas Studies
Stanford's Overseas Studies Program
began 2S years ago and lias grown to
the extent that now one-third of Stan
ford students (600 "00 per \ear) stud\
abroad for at least one quarter. This
percentage is much higher than that of
other institutions.
The University of California-
Berkeley, known for its excellent over
seas program, sends a total of onh five

percent of its students abroad each
year. In addition, the I C-Berkeley pro
gram is very competitive, requiring
that students be fluent in the language

and commit themselves to an entire
year.

Overseas Studies
Stanford's Overseas Studies Program
began 2S years ago and lias grown to
the extent that now one-third of Stan
ford students (600 "00 per \ear) stud\
abroad for at least one quarter. This
percentage is much higher than that of
other institutions.
The University of California-
Berkeley, known for its excellent over
seas program, sends a total of onh five

percent of its students abroad each
year. In addition, the I C-Berkeley pro
gram is very competitive, requiring
that students be fluent in the language

and commit themselves to an entire
year.
Stanford wants to think of our stu
dents .is leaders of the world ... as
leaders of California and as leaders of
the* Tinted States, sa\ s Nancy Padgett,
deput\ director of the Overseas
Studies Program Its important to
have .i multi-cultural perspective be
cause the world and all of society is
multi cultural
Padgett adds: "It's important and

desirable to see your interests first
hand. Our roots and the roots of every
thing we stud\ are in Europe. What
happens in San Francisco and New

York is just a derivative.
"Students interested in design and
fashion go to Italy Those interested in
medicine might go to England. Tech
nology majors might study in Berlin.
Others may go to Paris tor the arts.
There are centers for all disciplines,
and the faculty of every department at
Stanford has contacts all over the
world.
Innovative Academic Courses
Innovative Academic Courses con
sists of three programs which offer aca
demic opportunities in topics not
available through regular departmen
tal classes.
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) encourage stu
dents to explore their personal and po
litical values and to develop educa
tional goals. All workshops include an
action project outside of the class
room, with the aim of building skills
and confidence while allowing stu
dents to see the effects of their action
in the community. SVC'OPSI offers
some 3-4 week mini-courses for one
unit each.
Fresh man-Sophomore Seminars
(FSS) are taught by Stanford lecturers
and are usually limited to enrollments
of 10 students. They investigate well
defined problems and questions, del
ving deeply into current issues.
Undergraduate Special Courses
(UGS) fills gaps in the undergraduate
curriculum, offering topics from
"Working Effectively with Disturbed
Children" to "Truth is 24 Frames a
Second: Analyzing Classic Movies." The
courses are often organized and taught
by community members or students.
Information about all Innovative
Acacemic Courses can be obtained on
the first floor of Sweet Hall.

For years Stanford students were made to feel as if they
were on one long snipe hunt as they ran madly between
scattered, obscure nooks of the campus in their search for
information about academic opportunities, research pro
grams and grants, overseas studies, seminars, computers
and basic advising.
No more. Sweet Hall — located between Stern Hall and
Meyer Library — gathers these student services under one
roof.
Construction of the new building was completed in Au
gust. According to Curtis Williams, director of Facilities and
Project Management, plans for the building began in the fall
of 19HS, with two goals in mind initially: first, to quicklv pro
vide a facility to house the large Low Overhead Time
Sharing (LOTS) system and other computer-based services,
and second, to build that facilitv as inexpensivelv as possi
ble.
The space on which Sweet Hall was built is a prime site,
according to Williams.
"There is not much empty space in the center of campus,
so the idea was to maximize use of this facility," he explains.
That is why a project that began at 30,000 square feet now
covers SO,OOO square feet and houses almost all student in
formational services.
Director of LJndergraduate Advising Audrey Bernfield is
enthusiastic about the new facilitv.

Recently completed Sweet Hall brings together under one roof a host of aca
demic service offices previously scattered ahout campus.
"We hope that students come en
masse to see the services offered at
Sweet Hall," she says. "We provide a
huge variety of services. I don't think
advising has ever been better."
The services now centered in Sweet
Hall are many in number and diverse
in nature:
Undergraduate Advising Center
The Undergraduate Advising Center
(UAC) is a resource center for under
graduates who need specific answers
to educational questions. UAC does not

provide alternative academic advisers
for students but does function as a sup
plement by working with regular ad
visers.
With both a premed and a prelaw
adviser, UAC is prepared to advise stu
dents individually as they contemplate
entering professional fields. UAC also
sponsors day fairs like "A Majors
Event," which can help students clarify
their choices of a major.
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities
Undergraduate Research Opportuni

ties (URO) was started in 1974 to
facilitate interaction between under
graduates and faculty members.
"Stanford has excellence in its un
dergraduate education on the one
hand, and it has excellence in its re
search faculty on the other hand," says
Laura Zelznick, director of URO. "The
purpose of the URO program is to
combine the two of them so that un
dergraduates can take advantage of the
research faculty, and so that the re
search faculty can have better contact
with the students."
Faculty members from all depart
ments of the university conduct re
search projects throughout the year.
Students can earn University credit — or
sometimes salary — while also getting
valuable hands-on experience in their
field of interest. Descriptions of the
projects and job openings are listed in
URO on the first floor of Sweet Hall.

In January 1985, according to
Zelznick, the URO began "a second
phase" of activity, making research
grants available to students.
Three kinds of grants are offered to
Stanford undergraduates. The Fire
stone Major Grant is for extended re
search in the social sciences and natu
ral sciences. The Golden Grant is
available for humanities scholarship
and artistic creation. Small Grants pro
vide up to $500 for research expenses.
For both the Firestone and the Golden
grants, students must commit them
selves to their proposed projects
during at least three academic quar
ters, and the maximum award is
$2,500.
Last year Stanford awarded 11
Golden Grants, 25 Firestone Grants
and 75 Small Grants.
The grants represent honors proj
ects which get students more deeply

involved in research and understand
ing a specified subject of interest. They
offer an opportunity to break away
from the structured education of the
freshman and sophomore years.
Projects for 1986 Golden Grant win
ners include junior Brigid Doherty's
"Independent Painting Study in Berlin:
An Experiment in Figurative Expres
sionism," and junior Teresa Mary
McCarthy's "Gaelic Influences in Flann
O'Brien." One student is writing a play,
and another is writing a novella. Nich
olas Schiff, a junior, received financial
backing for his honor's thesis in the
history of modern brain research.
Titles of Firestone Grant projects in
clude junior James Chang's
"Differential Gene Expression of Or
nithine Decarboxylase," based on tech
niques in molecular biology and ge
netic engineering. Thomas Ehrlich
man, a junior, traveled to a small

peasant town in the Andes in order to
study the resilience of natives to cul
tural change. Sophomore Charles
Jones is testing and applying a recently
developed geological dating method
in a project titled "Desert Varnish
Dating in Coastal Peru." Junior Susan
Peinhold is investigating "Patterns of
Women's Political Participation Before
and After the 1974 Portuguese Revolu
tion."
The third function of URO, in addi
tion to arranging student-faculty re
search and awarding grants for inde
pendent projects, is to make data
available to students electronically.
Folio is a massive computer system
which was developed as part of Project
Concourse, a three-year pilot study
begun in the fell of 1985 by Informa
tion Technology Services (ITS) with a
grant from IBM. The project will e.\
periment and evaluate what happens
in a university environment when aca
demic and reference materials are
made available electronically.
Folio includes all of Socrates and
Odyssey, as well as database for infor
mation on any subject, including off
campus rental housing. On Sept. 30, a
brand new file went public. It lists all
the research interests or involvements
of each faculty member and can be
continually updated.
Soon to be available are additional
files with information on scholarships
and fellowships for graduate study
University public events, San Mateo
community service organizations, Hay
Area environmental services, I'niver
sity job openings and Harvard business
Review abstracts, as well as student,
faculty and staff directories
Information and Research
Information Systems
The staff of Information and Re
search Information Systems (IKIS) is
now located on the third floor of Sweet
Hall. IRIS provides students and faculty
with information about computing on
campus.
The IRIS microcomputer evaluation
lab (formerly called Elmer and located
in Forsythe Hall) contains various
kinds of computer equipment, includ
ing programming languages, word
processing, spread sheets and graph
ics. Visitors may experiment with the
systems in order to evaluate which is
best suited to their needs.

During the school war. IRIS plans to
offer several options tor learning about
computers, including seminars on cur
rent topics, tutorial material for inde
pendent study and formal courses.
Center for Teaching and Learning
The Center foi Teaching ind l earn
ing (CTL) can help students succeed in
a challenging university environment.
Work loads and pressures on students
are so great that high school study
habits often do not suffice
All students are given the right to
free academic peer tutoring. This
privilege allows up to eight hours of
tree tutoring per course pet quarter
The tutors are students who have
already taken the course in question
and received an "A Ideally, the tutors
