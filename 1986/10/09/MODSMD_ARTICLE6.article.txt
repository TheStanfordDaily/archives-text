# Academic ball serves all

### KACEY FITZPATRICK 
For years Stanford students were made to feel as if they
were on one long snipe hunt as they ran madly between
scattered, obscure nooks of the campus in their search for
information about academic opportunities, research pro
grams and grants, overseas studies, seminars, computers
and basic advising.
No more. Sweet Hall — located between Stern Hall and
Meyer Library — gathers these student services under one
roof.
Construction of the new building was completed in Au
gust. According to Curtis Williams, director of Facilities and
Project Management, plans for the building began in the fall
of 19HS, with two goals in mind initially: first, to quicklv pro
vide a facility to house the large Low Overhead Time
Sharing (LOTS) system and other computer-based services,
and second, to build that facilitv as inexpensivelv as possi
ble.
The space on which Sweet Hall was built is a prime site,
according to Williams.
"There is not much empty space in the center of campus,
so the idea was to maximize use of this facility," he explains.
That is why a project that began at 30,000 square feet now
covers SO,OOO square feet and houses almost all student in
formational services.
Director of LJndergraduate Advising Audrey Bernfield is
enthusiastic about the new facilitv.
