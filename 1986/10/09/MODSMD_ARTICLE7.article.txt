# Wilbur urges dorm classes
## 
### JAY FRY 
If an experimental program underway in Wilbur Hall is as
successful as its proponents hope, discussing Dante over
dinner or Luther during lunch may become more com
monplace than ever before.
Beginning this fall, freshmen in Wilbur Hall's all
freshman and freshman-sophomore dorms have received
their housing assignments based on their selection of West
ern Culture tracks. Both Residential Education and the
residence fellows who instigated the program hope that
concentrating students from the same tracks will help jump
start intellectual discussions in the dormitories and dining
hails.
The underlying purpose of the experiment, according to
Dennis Matthies, an RF for Otero and a co-author of the pro
posal. is "to break down the difference between what hap
pens in the dorm and what happens in the classroom. We
want it to become natural to talk about classes."
As a result of the program, HO percent of the freshmen en
rolled in the Literature and the Arts track of Western Culture
and 50 percent of those in the Great Works track live in Wil
bur, said Matthies According to Alice Supton, assistant dean
of Residential Education, Madera and Rinconada residents
are split evenly between the two classes, all Otero freshmen
are enrolled in Great Works, and one-third of Trancos is in
Literature and the Arts
Discussion sections are cluster based as a result of this
