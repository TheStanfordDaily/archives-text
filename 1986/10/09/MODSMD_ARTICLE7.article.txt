# Wilbur urges dorm classes
## 
### JAY FRY 
If an experimental program underway in Wilbur Hall is as
successful as its proponents hope, discussing Dante over
dinner or Luther during lunch may become more com
monplace than ever before.
Beginning this fall, freshmen in Wilbur Hall's all
freshman and freshman-sophomore dorms have received
their housing assignments based on their selection of West
ern Culture tracks. Both Residential Education and the
residence fellows who instigated the program hope that
concentrating students from the same tracks will help jump
start intellectual discussions in the dormitories and dining
hails.
The underlying purpose of the experiment, according to
Dennis Matthies, an RF for Otero and a co-author of the pro
posal. is "to break down the difference between what hap
pens in the dorm and what happens in the classroom. We
want it to become natural to talk about classes."
As a result of the program, HO percent of the freshmen en
rolled in the Literature and the Arts track of Western Culture
and 50 percent of those in the Great Works track live in Wil
bur, said Matthies According to Alice Supton, assistant dean
of Residential Education, Madera and Rinconada residents
are split evenly between the two classes, all Otero freshmen
are enrolled in Great Works, and one-third of Trancos is in
Literature and the Arts
Discussion sections are cluster based as a result of this
experimental program, said Matthies. Each
section involves students from three of the all
freshman and freshman-sophomore dorms in
Wilbur. The instructors have the option to
hold section meetings in the newly renovated
seminar rooms in Wilbur Office instead of in
the Quad, according to Charles Junkerman, a
Madera RF and another of the proposal's auth
ors.
The experiment, which borrows many of its
characteristics from the-residence-based
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) program
already in place in Florence Moore Hall, is
striving for "more of a cultural, intellectual
and coherent atmosphere in the dorms,"
Junkerman said.
Because the tracks are residence-based like
SLE, Res Ed believes students will find it
easier to discuss Western Culture lectures,
readings and, in turn, other classes. "We do
not want students to feel that they should stop
thinking when they step into their dorm,"
Supton said.
Both Matthies and Junkerman see this pro
gram as beneficial in promoting extra pro
grams and activities directly related to the top
ics students will be studying. "There is a
greater concentration of students for periph
eral programs than if they are scattered all
over campus," Junkerman said.
"It is very important to find ways to encour
age students to be more active rather than
passive in their course taking," Matthies said.
He said he foresees more student-initiated

evening programs such as film screenings and
small-scale dramatic productions related to
students' Western Culture topics. With most of
the students located in one dorm complex,
Matthies said it will also be easier for students
to attend programs put on by RFs and faculty
members.

According to Supton, Res Ed believes that
"the higher critical mass and greater concen
tration of similar experiences will create
more intellectual excitement and fervor" in
the dorms. She said she hopes this atmos
phere will encourage students to invite faculty
members to eat in the residence dining halls.
Junkerman said he hopes that the Western
Culture lecturers will become a more con
stant presence in the dorms.
Resident assistants, while not officially in
volved, should help in "promoting a strong

intellectual climate and provide the
framework so intellectual discussion can get
started,'' according to Otero RA Braden Pen
hoet.
"I think it's fabulous," said Karen Abrams,
an Otero freshman enrolled in Great Works.
"It's a great way to get to know people on an
intellectual level. It doesn't limit you — it
opens up more possibilities. It also provides a
nice sense of security, especially in the begin
ning."
According to Matthies, the experiment will
be under close scrutiny this year, and a com
prehensive evaluation will be made following
spring quarter. Already, Junkerman said, the
Conflict and Change track of Western Culture
has expressed interest in adopting a similar
residence-based program.
Other large classes, such as Economics 1,
Computer Science 105 and 106, Chemistry 31
and some calculus courses, have also begun
looking at the possibilities of dorm-based sec
tions, even before the success of the Wilbur
experiment is known.
The experimental Wilbur program was out
lined this summer in a proposal put forward
by current and former RFs from Madera,
Otero, Rinconada and Trancos. According to
Junkerman, the proposal was based largely on
their experiences as RFs and the success of
the SLE program in fostering "creative think
ers."
"SLE is one of the most successful pro
grams at Stanford. To imitate its successes, we
took what we could," he said. "Most am
bitiously, we'd like to create an atmosphere
similar to that in a small liberal arts college."
The current program, Junkerman said, "is
an experiment that depends on the imagina
tion and energy of everyone involved."

Junkerman said.
Because the tracks are residence-based like
SLE, Res Ed believes students will find it
easier to discuss Western Culture lectures,
readings and, in turn, other classes. "We do
not want students to feel that they should stop
thinking when they step into their dorm,"
Supton said.
Both Matthies and Junkerman see this pro
gram as beneficial in promoting extra pro
grams and activities directly related to the top
ics students will be studying. "There is a
greater concentration of students for periph
eral programs than if they are scattered all
over campus," Junkerman said.
"It is very important to find ways to encour
age students to be more active rather than
passive in their course taking," Matthies said.
He said he foresees more student-initiated

evening programs such as film screenings and
small-scale dramatic productions related to
students' Western Culture topics. With most of
the students located in one dorm complex,
Matthies said it will also be easier for students
to attend programs put on by RFs and faculty
members.

According to Supton, Res Ed believes that
"the higher critical mass and greater concen
tration of similar experiences will create
more intellectual excitement and fervor" in
the dorms. She said she hopes this atmos
phere will encourage students to invite faculty
members to eat in the residence dining halls.
Junkerman said he hopes that the Western
Culture lecturers will become a more con
stant presence in the dorms.
Resident assistants, while not officially in
volved, should help in "promoting a strong

intellectual climate and provide the
framework so intellectual discussion can get
started,'' according to Otero RA Braden Pen
hoet.
"I think it's fabulous," said Karen Abrams,
an Otero freshman enrolled in Great Works.
"It's a great way to get to know people on an
intellectual level. It doesn't limit you — it
opens up more possibilities. It also provides a
nice sense of security, especially in the begin
ning."
According to Matthies, the experiment will
be under close scrutiny this year, and a com
prehensive evaluation will be made following
spring quarter. Already, Junkerman said, the
Conflict and Change track of Western Culture
has expressed interest in adopting a similar
residence-based program.
Other large classes, such as Economics 1,
Computer Science 105 and 106, Chemistry 31
and some calculus courses, have also begun
looking at the possibilities of dorm-based sec
tions, even before the success of the Wilbur
experiment is known.
The experimental Wilbur program was out
lined this summer in a proposal put forward
by current and former RFs from Madera,
Otero, Rinconada and Trancos. According to
Junkerman, the proposal was based largely on
their experiences as RFs and the success of
the SLE program in fostering "creative think
ers."
"SLE is one of the most successful pro
grams at Stanford. To imitate its successes, we
took what we could," he said. "Most am
bitiously, we'd like to create an atmosphere
similar to that in a small liberal arts college."
The current program, Junkerman said, "is
an experiment that depends on the imagina
tion and energy of everyone involved."

If an experimental program underway in Wilbur Hall is as
successful as its proponents hope, discussing Dante over
dinner or Luther during lunch may become more com
monplace than ever before.
Beginning this fall, freshmen in Wilbur Hall's all
freshman and freshman-sophomore dorms have received
their housing assignments based on their selection of West
ern Culture tracks. Both Residential Education and the
residence fellows who instigated the program hope that
concentrating students from the same tracks will help jump
start intellectual discussions in the dormitories and dining
hails.
The underlying purpose of the experiment, according to
Dennis Matthies, an RF for Otero and a co-author of the pro
posal. is "to break down the difference between what hap
pens in the dorm and what happens in the classroom. We
want it to become natural to talk about classes."
As a result of the program, HO percent of the freshmen en
rolled in the Literature and the Arts track of Western Culture
and 50 percent of those in the Great Works track live in Wil
bur, said Matthies According to Alice Supton, assistant dean
of Residential Education, Madera and Rinconada residents
are split evenly between the two classes, all Otero freshmen
are enrolled in Great Works, and one-third of Trancos is in
Literature and the Arts
Discussion sections are cluster based as a result of this
experimental program, said Matthies. Each
section involves students from three of the all
freshman and freshman-sophomore dorms in
Wilbur. The instructors have the option to
hold section meetings in the newly renovated
seminar rooms in Wilbur Office instead of in
the Quad, according to Charles Junkerman, a
Madera RF and another of the proposal's auth
ors.
The experiment, which borrows many of its
characteristics from the-residence-based
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) program
already in place in Florence Moore Hall, is
striving for "more of a cultural, intellectual
and coherent atmosphere in the dorms,"
Junkerman said.
