House passes anti-narcotics bill
WASHINGTON — A compromise anti-narcotics bill was approved yester
day by the House, which included a death penalty for drug-related murders
despite a threatened Senate filibuster that could kill the election-year legis
lation.
The amended version of the drug bill, first approved in the House Sept.
11, was passed on a 391-23 vote.
"We have as a society to hold die death penalty over the heads of those
who would kill at random to make sure their enterprise ... their drug
syndicate remains intact," said Rep. George Gekas (R-Pa.), the original
sponsor of the death-penalty provision.
The bill would provide the death penalty for the commission of murder
to further a continuing narcotics enterprise.
Before the debate, House Majority Leader Jim Wright (D-Texas), who in
cluded the provision in the revised legislation approved Tuesday by the
Rules Committee, acknowledged the filibuster threat by moderate Senate
Republicans and liberal Democrats.
The Senate, which passed its version of the anti-drug bill last week,
deleted the death penalty provision as well as several other controversial
items, including a relaxation of the rule that would bar the use of illegally
obtained evidence in court.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.), himself an opponent of the
death penalty, acknowledged that the drug bill could not pass without the
provision.
The bill was passed when the House approved a resolution to concur
with the Senate-passed bill with changes made by House and Senate aides
who fashioned the compromise measure.
South Africa expels workers
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The South African government, in its
first reprisal against a black-ruled neighbor for backing international sanc
tions against it, said yesterday that it would expel more than 68,000 Mozam
bique workers.
The action, which has broad political and social ramifications here and
in Mozambique, appears to herald South Africa's long-threatened cam
paign of "countersanctions." Further steps against neighboring Zimbabwe
and Zambia and perhaps against the United States, Western Europe and
Japan are expected.
The South African government's announcement in Pretoria late Wednes
day said simply that Mozambique workers would no longer be admitted to
the country and that those now here, mostly miners, would be repatriated
at the end of their contracts, which generally run for 14 months.
The official reason cited by the government was Mozambique's support
of the African National Congress, the principal group fighting minority
white rule here.
First Interstate defends merger
SAN FRANCISCO — BankAmerica Corp. remained silent yesterday on a
merger proposal that banking industry sources say it is sure to reject, while
its suitor, First Interstate Bancorp, denied its $2.7 billion offer is under
priced.
"The proposal, which is made on a friendly basis, is intended to offer an
alternative which is not only fair but attractive to the shareholders,
employees and customers of both companies," the Los Angeles-based com
pany said in a statement.
"The merger proposal was crafted to respond to specific issues raised in
discussions with BankAmerica management and its advisers."
Under the complex terms of the proposal, each of the 154 million shares
of BankAmerica common stock would be exchanged for 0.22 of a share of
First Interstate common stock — roughly $12 at current market prices —
and a share of new preferred stock.
The preferred stock has been valued by First Interstate's investment
banker, Goldman Sachs & Co., at $6, but analysts estimate its worth at as
low as $3.
BankAmerica spokesman Arthur Miller said the San Francisco-based par
ent company of Bank of America has no timetable for accepting or rejecting
the stock-swap offer. The company has had no formal comment since dis
closing on Monday that it received the proposal in the mail last Friday and
will consider it further once it receives more information from First Inter
state.
Pinochet shakes up his army
SANTIAGO, Chile — President Augusto Pinochet dismissed the army
member of Chile's military junta and retired nine generals yesterday in a
shake-up of senior army ranks.
The changes appeared to underline Pinochet's determination not to
relax his 13-year-old military dictatorship.
Pinochet, the 70-year-old army commander, named one of his most loyal
aides, Lt. Gen. Humberto Gordon, director of the secret police agency, to
represent the army on the four-member junta effective Dec. 11.
Gordon will replace Lt. Gen. Julio Canessa.
Among those retired were Maj. Gen. Luis Danus, commander of the
southern military region; Brig. Gen. Gaston Frez, commander of the north
ern region; and Maj. Gen. Alejandro Medina, the joint chiefs erf staff chair
man.
The 53,000-man army has been Pinochet's power base since he seized
the presidency from Salvador Allende in a 1973 coup.
Farm bankruptcies predicted
CHAMPAIGN, 111. — There will be "an explosion" of farm bankruptcy
filings once farmers and their lawyers realize the advantages of a new bank
ruptcy law approved by Congress, a Chicago attorney predicts.
"It's the best thing that's happened to farmers in the 20th century," attor
ney Richard Mason said. "It's a shot in the arm. It's going to save a lot of
farmers."
The new bankruptcy measure, Chapter 12 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act,
won House and Senate approval last week and awaits action by President
Reagan.
A key provision of the bill would give the court permission to allow
qualified people to reorganize their debts without the unanimous approval
of all creditors — a major stumbling block in Chapter 11 reorganizations,
Mason explained. ,
Under the new provision, the court could confirm a debtor's plan to
repay creditors if it appeared to be in the best interests of everyone; if it
were workable; and if secured creditors either got their collateral back or
were repaid over a period of time the court felt was reasonable.
Wine workers return to jobs
Nearly 2,200 Northern California winery workers probably had no
choice but to return to their jobs Monday after admitting that they had been
badly defeated by nine companies in a bitter seven-week strike.
The industry' s "victory" may not be as complete as it seems if the
workers' anger over their defeat causes any significant reduction in pro
ductivity. But each new defeat of a union encourages more companies,
even prosperous ones, to demand contract concessions from their
workers.
The wineries forced the workers to take a cut of $1 an hour in wages and
benefits by issuing a believable threat to permanently fire everyone who
stayed on strike.
Two weeks ago, angry strikers voted overwhelmingly to reject the com
panies demands. One worker commented bitterly that "when we accept
an offer like that, then they (management) really think you're a joke."
Nevertheless, in a second vote last week on the same management pro
posal to cut wages and benefits, the workers approved it by 66 percent after
the industry issued its ultimatum: work or be permanently fired
