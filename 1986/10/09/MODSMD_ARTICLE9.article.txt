# Confusion surrounds plane
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — New questions and conflicting
information yesterday increased the uncertainty over
the origins and sponsorship of a cargo plane loaded
with weapons that was shot down in Nicaragua as two
congressional probes began focusing on possible
U.S. links to the plane.
The top military commander of the Nicaraguan
rebel force known as contras said the flight was
bringing in supplies for his troops in southern
Nicaragua but echoed Reagan administration officials
in saying that the U.S. government had "nothing to
do" with the event.
The State Department complained that Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government had refused to receive
consular representatives trying to see Eugene
Hasenfus, 45, a U.S. citizen and the sole survivor of
the crash. State Department spokesman Charles Red
man warned that the incident "raises the question of
whether a U.S. embassy can function normally in
Nicaragua."
Intelligence officials told members of Congress in
a closed briefing that two Americans killed in the
crash, pilot William Cooper and copilot Wallace
Blaine Sawyer Jr., of Magnolia, Ark., had worked for
the Central Intelligence Agency "years ago" but were
no longer on the payroll, according to congressional
sources. A third person killed in the crash was identi
fied only as a Latin American.
The sources said that members of Congress were
told that Hasenfus was not a former CIA employee.
But in Marinette, Wis., an old friend of Hasenfus
recalled that he "was always talking about what he'd

done when he worked for them" 20 years ago, Wash
ington Post correspondent Kevin Klose reported.
Hasenfus' cousin, Jade, said Sally Hasenfus, the
wife of the captured American, flew to Miami yester
day to meet State Department officials. He said he un
derstood that the department was trying to arrange a
reunion between Hasenfus and his wife.
The congressional sources quoted the intelligence
officials as saying the airplane had flown into
Nicaragua from Ilopango Air Base in El Salvador, a
tightly guarded Salvadoran military facility. But the
intelligence officials told members of Congress they
had not yet sorted out the sponsor or sponsors of the
operation, according to those who heard the brief
ing.
Although the House committee spans the political
spectrum, "nobody got excited about the mission,"
according to one source. "We all know this has been
going on for years. This time they just got caught."
Another source at the meeting said the incident is
not likely to affect Congress' attitude toward the con
tras or toward the $100 million in aid awaiting final
approval. Those who support the aid think that ear
lier approval would have allowed professionals to
take over the contras' effort to overthrow the Sandi
nistas and saved these three lives, the source said.
The day's developments cast new doubt on the
kind of plane involved in the crash. The Nicaraguan
government has identified it as a U.S.-built C-123
Provider, a big military transport used extensively in
the Vietnam war, but Defense Department spokes
men said televised pictures from the crash site ap

peared to show a Canadian-built C-7 transport, which
has short takeoff and landing capability.
In Miami, William Kress, a spokesman for South
ern Air Transport Co., who had previously denied all
knowledge of the flight, said a search of company
records had found that Cooper was issued a South
ern Air identity rard last April to allow him access to
company grounds to do repair work on the plane
that crashed. "We did maintenance on the aircraft
that crashed," he said, and identified it as a C-123,
adding that it was not owned by Southern Air.
Kress also said that Sawyer had once worked for
the company but left last year. FBI officials said Wed
nesday that two of their agents visited Southern Air
offices as part of a probe into possible violations of
the U.S. Neutrality Act, which prohibits Americans
from engaging in hostile acts against countries not at
war with the United States.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair
man, Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), said his committee
would also investigate the crash. And Sen. David
Durenberger (R-Minn.), chairman of the Select Com
mittee on Intelligence, said "there will be many in
vestigations" into the incident.
President Reagan, asked yesterday whether he ap
proved of private supply efforts for the contras, told
reporters: "Well, we're in a free country where
private citizens have a great many freedoms."
Reagan reasserted that there was "no government
connection" with the plane or its mission. Asked who
the fliers were working for, he said:"l don't know."

the Central Intelligence Agency "years ago" but were
no longer on the payroll, according to congressional
sources. A third person killed in the crash was identi
fied only as a Latin American.
The sources said that members of Congress were
told that Hasenfus was not a former CIA employee.
But in Marinette, Wis., an old friend of Hasenfus
recalled that he "was always talking about what he'd

done when he worked for them" 20 years ago, Wash
ington Post correspondent Kevin Klose reported.
Hasenfus' cousin, Jade, said Sally Hasenfus, the
wife of the captured American, flew to Miami yester
day to meet State Department officials. He said he un
derstood that the department was trying to arrange a
reunion between Hasenfus and his wife.
The congressional sources quoted the intelligence
officials as saying the airplane had flown into
Nicaragua from Ilopango Air Base in El Salvador, a
tightly guarded Salvadoran military facility. But the
intelligence officials told members of Congress they
had not yet sorted out the sponsor or sponsors of the
operation, according to those who heard the brief
ing.
Although the House committee spans the political
spectrum, "nobody got excited about the mission,"
according to one source. "We all know this has been
going on for years. This time they just got caught."
Another source at the meeting said the incident is
not likely to affect Congress' attitude toward the con
tras or toward the $100 million in aid awaiting final
approval. Those who support the aid think that ear
lier approval would have allowed professionals to
take over the contras' effort to overthrow the Sandi
nistas and saved these three lives, the source said.
The day's developments cast new doubt on the
kind of plane involved in the crash. The Nicaraguan
government has identified it as a U.S.-built C-123
Provider, a big military transport used extensively in
the Vietnam war, but Defense Department spokes
men said televised pictures from the crash site ap

peared to show a Canadian-built C-7 transport, which
has short takeoff and landing capability.
In Miami, William Kress, a spokesman for South
ern Air Transport Co., who had previously denied all
knowledge of the flight, said a search of company
records had found that Cooper was issued a South
ern Air identity rard last April to allow him access to
company grounds to do repair work on the plane
that crashed. "We did maintenance on the aircraft
that crashed," he said, and identified it as a C-123,
adding that it was not owned by Southern Air.
Kress also said that Sawyer had once worked for
the company but left last year. FBI officials said Wed
nesday that two of their agents visited Southern Air
offices as part of a probe into possible violations of
the U.S. Neutrality Act, which prohibits Americans
from engaging in hostile acts against countries not at
war with the United States.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair
man, Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), said his committee
would also investigate the crash. And Sen. David
Durenberger (R-Minn.), chairman of the Select Com
mittee on Intelligence, said "there will be many in
vestigations" into the incident.
President Reagan, asked yesterday whether he ap
proved of private supply efforts for the contras, told
reporters: "Well, we're in a free country where
private citizens have a great many freedoms."
Reagan reasserted that there was "no government
connection" with the plane or its mission. Asked who
the fliers were working for, he said:"l don't know."
