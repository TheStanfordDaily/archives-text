# Kalb resigns due to Libya policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Bernard Kalb, the assistant sec
retary of state for public affairs, announced his resig
nation Wednesday in protest against the deception
and disinformation campaign that the Reagan admin
istration launched against Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafi in August.
"You face a choice — as an American, as a spokes
man, as a journalist — whether to allow oneself to be
absorbed in the ranks of silence, whether to vanish
into unopposed acquiescence or to enter a modest
dissent," Kalb said at an emotional news conference
with the State Department press corps shortly after
the regular noon briefing.
The resignation of the State Department's prin
cipal spokesman, coming just three days before Pres
ident Reagan's meeting in Iceland with Soviet leader

Mikhail Gorbachev, embarrassed the administration
and again raised questions about its credibility.
Kalb said he had reached his decision to resign out
of concern for the impact of the disinformation pro
gram on the credibility of the United States. "Faith in
the word of America is the pulse beat of our
democracy. Anything that hurts America's credibility
hurts America,"he said.
The 64-year-old former television reporter who
became State Department spokesman in January
1985 said he was also concerned about his own
credibility "both as a spokesman and a journalist."
The administration has been extremely sensitive to
allegations, which it has repeatedly denied, that it
deliberately fed misleading information to the U.S.
media in August aimed at convincing Khadafi that he

was about to be attacked by the United States or over
thrown in rnnn
Secretary of State George Shultz issued a short
statement Wednesday saying he was sorry to see Kalb
leave and that he had admired him as a fine jour
nalist, colleague, adviser and friend. "I wish him
well," Shultz said.
On a trip to North Carolina with Reagan, White
House spokesman Larry Speakes declined to com
ment on Kalb's resignation. Asked if Kalb's service to
the administration had been valued, Speakes said:
"Kalb worked for Secretary Shultz."
Later, a senior White House official told reporters
that the administration was upset with Kalb's deci
sion to resign, but this official insisted on anonymity
when criticizing Kalb.
