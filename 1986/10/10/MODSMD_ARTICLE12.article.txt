## Of Editors and Ethics 
### 
When a Playboy photographer came to Stan
ford in April 1985 seeking women for its Pac
10 pictorial, The Daily ran the magazine s
recruitment advertisements, despite protests
from a vocal group of students. The editors de
termined that running the ads did not con
stitute an endorsement of the magazine's ex
ploitation of women.
When members and pledges of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity were accused last year of
dropping flaming couches from a balcony and
harassing students, The Daily reported several
complaints about the fraternity. Editors
ignored cries of sensationalism, arguing that
each story was newsworthy.
Daily editors and reporters are often
accused of being callous and immoral, of
going after controversial stories that make for
good reading and of showing no journalistic
restraint. The Playboy ads and DU stories are
two examples of Daily obstinacy that critics
frequently cite.
Daily editors face tough ethical questions al
most every day.
Should the news department assign a story
on a Row house fight if a high-level Stanford
administrator has asked that the story not be
pursued?
Should the sports department print the spe
cific injury of a Stanford tennis player if her
Berkeley opponent might see the article and
play to her weakness?
Should the features department run a story
about a student cocaine dealer?
What few outside The Daily realize is that in
recent years the editors have killed more con
troversial stories than they have run. In the
three cases above, The Haily honored requests

to withhold newsworthy information.
Following are four scenarios that Daily
editors and reporters might encounter. What
would you do in each case?
Case One: A Daily reporter overhears a fra
ternity member at a party say that his fraternity
stole a valuable University-owned item.
Should she use that admission in a story, treat
it as background information to be verified
elsewhere, or pretend that she never heard it?
Case Two. Nine students arrested for acts of
civil disobedience ask The Daily not to print
their names. The students, who refuse to give
their names to police because they want to
remain in jail, tell The Daily that identifying
them will result in their cite release. The Daily
has the names of five of the nine students.
Should it print them, wait until it has all nine
names and then print them, or withhold all the
names?
Case Three: A resident assistant in a fresh
man dormitory is fired for unspecified
reasons. She tells The Daily that her dismissal
points up serious problems in the Residential
Education grievance procedures. A Res Ed offi
cial agrees that the dismissal is significant and
that it raises important questions about the RA
program, yet asks that the story not appear.
Should The Daily run a story about the RA
firing? Should it run a story focusing on the RA
grievance procedure without mentioning the
RA's dismissal? Or should it just kill the story?
Case four. A student driving alone is killed
in a single-car crash. A police report says he
was intoxicated at the time. The student's par
ents ask The Daily not to include that fact in
the obituary. Should the editors comply with
the request?
