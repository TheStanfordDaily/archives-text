### SOHAILA ABDULALI 
Armando Valladares, a former politi
cal prisoner in Cuba, spoke Wednes
day night of the "reality" of Cuban
leader Fidel Castro's leftist dictatorship
and said the solution to the many prob
lems afflicting Latin America is in
democracy, "not in dictatorships, nei
ther in Che's model nor in Castro's."
Valladares, brought to Stanford Uni
versity by the Hoover Institution, Am
nesty International and several profes
sors in the History and Political Sci
ence departments, made the appear
ance as part of a national tour to
promote his book "Against All Hope,"
an account of his 22 years in Cuban
prisons. He was released in 1983
largely through the efforts of Amnesty
International, a human rights group
based in England.
In a 20-minute presentation fol
lowed by an hour of answering ques
tions posed by the mostly Cuban audi
ence, Valladares, who spoke through
an interpreter, described the absence
of human rights in Cuba. He said that
during the 2H years of Castro's rule,

thousands of Cubans have been killed
by the government, and two million
have been forced to flee the country.
He added that there is no freedom of
expression in Cuba.
Lashing out against Castro's support
ers in other countries, Valladares said
there are no good dictatorships and
condemned the "selective sensitivity
which only arises to fight human rights
violations when they arise in dictatros
hips of the right." Saying that people
who visit Cuba for short periods of
time see only what the government
wants them to see, he predicted that
the world will be horrified when it
finds out the reality of revolutionary
Cuba, just as it was horrified when
Stalin's atrocities in the Soviet Union
were discovered.
Valladares also compared Cuba to
Nicaragua, speaking of the "moral"
deficiency" in the governments of both
countries.

Reagan administration's distinction be
tween dictatorships of the right and the

left, Valladares said all dictatorships are
evil. He added, though, that there is
some hope of democracy in countries
such as Chile with right-wing dictator
ships, while there is no precedent for a
Marxist regime giving way to a
democracy. He added that Marxist rev

olutions are part of a systematic inter
national plan to spread communism,
and thus more dangerous.
Valladares said he hopes the United
States government will change its
policy toward Cuban refugees and al
low them to enter this country freely.
According to Valladares, his chief
concern regarding U.S. policy toward
Cuba lies in U.S. immigration policies
concerning Cuban refugees. Denying
them entry will only punish them.
