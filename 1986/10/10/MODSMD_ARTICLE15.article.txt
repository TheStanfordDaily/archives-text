## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Campus needs pub 
### 
It is gratifying to see the Council of Presidents have
taken the initiative of proposing an on-campus pub. This
is the sort of commitment and leadership one expects
from the COP and the ASSU â€” conceiving new projects
and then presenting them to the student body for ap
proval.
The pub proposal is a good one. Granted, there are
some necessary precautions that must be taken, includ
ing barring under-age people and area high school stu
dents from drinkin3. But a pub would be a welcome ad
dition to a campus that sadly offers only an undersized
Coffee House and a sterile student union in the way of
student hangouts.
An on-campus pub could be an interesting and fun
meeting place for students who are tired of fraternity
parties. The drawback is that not everyone would be old
enough to buy alcohol in the pub, but a system could be
arranged whereby Stanford students who are minors
could still take advantage of the social atmosphere.
Crucial to the success of this proposal is the issue of
student leadership after the pub's creation. Students in
volved in the early planning stages should seek student
opinion on this issue early in the process.
Few can forget the headaches resulting from the stu
dent leadership controversy at the Coffee House in the
past several years. The best way to avoid more un
profitable arguing is to approach the student-run issue as

soon as possible.
COP member Carey White has said the council is in
vestigating the pub's feasibility, and it will consider the
leadership issue once it has been determined that the
business would be successful here.
It is a mistake, however, to delay addressing the issue
of student leadership. It is far more advisable to examine
this issue now before the process goes much further.
According to White, the COP fully plans to follow stu
dent opinion on the leadership question. Currently, the
COP considers it better to have a pub under outside
leadership than no pub at all, but there is no reason why
students here cannot easily have both.
Certainly, student leadership would increase the pub's
value by offering students the opportunity to earn money
while gaining practical business experience at the same
time.
Also, pub planners and students debating whether or
not to support a pub should consider including a grill.
An on-campus burger joint would be immensely
popular. Undoubtedly, the grill would bring in more
customers (both over and under 21), making the place
more financially sound and more accessible to students
who are minors.
A pub is not an invaluable addition to Stanford, but
this campus would be improved by a place where you
could buy a good hamburger and a glass of dark beer.
