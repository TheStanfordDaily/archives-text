Grad students
caught in study
carrel snare
On Tuesday, graduate students
seeking dissertation carrels had to
stand in line in order to present
themselves personally to the authori
ties of Green Library's Access Services
Division. There had been people
waiting in line since 5 a.m., and a
crowd since at least 6; the sign-up
process was officially slated to begin
at 8. Well after 10, the people
who had arrived at opening time had
not all been served. One woman,
wearing a back brace, had given up
because she was in pain. People with
children to get to school, people with
jobs and even people with teaching
or other responsibilities to the Univer
sity were all expected to stand in line
for two, three or more hours. The
workers were efficient and courteous,
but the situation was absurd. They
were required to allow early comers
to request rooms by themselves, since
librarian Darla Crockett's memo had
declared that people would no longer
be assigned two-to-a-carrel unless they
stated such a preference.
At 10:30, there were no rooms left.
Anyone with a job or children was out
of luck, as was the woman with the
back brace, who had returned. Mean
while, some of the rooms had been
assigned as singles. Humanities
graduate students have no offices.
They are only granted a desk in an
office if they have the good fortune to
be hired as course assistants. Now,
some have to conduct their Ph.D.
research out of lockers smaller than a
single filing drawer, while a few of
their colleagues — those without any
obligations before 10:30 on Tuesday
mornings — have two file drawers, a
desk and 10 shelves. Some of those
who declared themselves willing to
share have been not double-assigned

but triple-assigned.
This policy is senseless. Rather than
accommodating as many students as
comfortably as possible, the Access
Services Division has seen to it that
the carrel-assignment system is as
unfair and inconvenient as possible.
Fewer people are likely to be served,
since some carrels may not be
double-assigned, and those who have
been served were served in a frustrat
ing and humiliating way. What pur
pose could this spectacle have served?
Hundreds of graduate students waited
for hours to present cards whose
existence could have been checked
against records already available in
the Access Services office. Spaces
were denied, effectively, on the
grounds of poverty, family status,
handicap or luck, while a more just
mail-it-in system could have saved
everyone time and trouble. Access
Services could have provided more
real access by giving preference to
people willing to share their carrels,
allowing more students to use them.
I hope the thoughtlessness and
inflexibility of the head of the Green
Library Access Services Division is not
irremediable.

Graduate students, English
US. must stand
against apartheid
Allen Estes serves up the standard
apologies for the South African gov
ernment and the usual tired argu
ments against divestment in his
column "Divestment will not end
apartheid" (Daily, Oct. 6).
In doing so, he misses the central
point. In case Mr. Estes hasn't noticed,
well over 2,000 people have died in
South Africa in the last two years,
virtually all of them black, and the
overwhelming majority of them at the

hands of the government and its
agents. In case Mr. Estes hasn't
noticed, the world is nearly unani
mous in its willingness to take a firm
stand against the institutionalized
racism and oppression of apartheid —
only America and Britain are sailing
against the tide, at great cost to our
international reputation.
For many years, Americans and
many other supporters of peaceful
change have ceded the South African
government time for its promised
reforms.
South Africa's response has been
the institution of violent repression on
an unprecedented scale — replete
with shadowy murders, massive
detention without trial, prison torture,
air strikes against sovereign neighbors
and comprehensive censorship of
news reports so that they can be
replaced with the ominous newspeak
of the government's Bureau of Infor
mation.
The central point, then, which is
lost in the morass of Mr. Estes' well
intentioned but somewhat dubious
incrementalist arguments, is this: At
certain times in history, the nature of
an evil is so clear and so odious, and
the cost of its continuance so great for
its victims as to be painful to all think
ing human beings, that we are called
upon to take a stand. We can no
longer stand idly by and merely watch
the horror unfold — especially when
our inaction — namely, our continued
investments — may actually be contri
buting to the government's ability to
prosecute the horror.
On the issue of South Africa, that
time is now, and many of us feel that
Stanford's — and America's — stand
should be unequivocal: Apartheid and
the apparatus which sustains it are
wrong, and we will not support them
any longer in any way.
