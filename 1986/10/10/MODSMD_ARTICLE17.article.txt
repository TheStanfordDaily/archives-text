# Anarchy facilitates intellectualism
## 
### 
The growing movement at Stanford to intensify
academics is threatening to stifle the creativity and
freeness of thought that has made this campus
unique and number one in the nation. Efforts to
eradicate the "anti-intellectualism" here at Stanford
are doing and will do little more than turn this
school into another stiff-necked institution bent on
conformity and obedience of the students. It is the
anarchical attitudes here that have set Stanford apart
from other schools, for they facilitate true free
thought and — exactly opposite to what many are
saying — true intellectualism.

statement made to oneself, or to the world, a person
falls into a blind following of what is told to him or
her. An attitude then starts to affect the mind, pro
gramming it into being a follower, submissive and
subservient to the concept of "academia" and the
people who make up this concept. Of course, these
people are seen as model students and will most cer
tainly become model citizens in society. But they will
never have the brains or the guts to go out and run
things or change something
Stanford is famous for the many great men and
women who have graduated from here — men and
women who have gone out and succeeded not be
cause they followed the norm, but because they
could think for themselves. And they were better
ready to be in charge of "the system" because during
their stay at Stanford "the system was ridiculed
Stanford has turned out great graduates because they
could see that the establishment is not some mysteri
ous temple of stone, but just some people who aren t
anv smarter than themselves. Stanford students

spend their time in an environment where the es
tablishment is ridiculed. Classes and grades don't
matter, the Stanford Band weekly ridicules conform
ity, the student senate gets hit with whipped cream
pies annually, the list goes on and on. And with each
event that a student hears about — or better yet, par
ticipates in — a never-say-die achiever develops, who
is open to new ideas and innovative ways. These
qualities fostered at Stanford have made this campus
the best in the nation.

You have to say, "To hell with the establishment," in
order for your mind to develop fully. Without this
statement made to oneself or to the world, a person
falls into a blind following of what is told to him or
her.

But some people want to change this — and they
are doing so. Certain forces on campus, under the
premise of raising intellectualism at Stanford, are
working to eliminate "undesirable elements here.
Seeming to forget that the campus should be a place
for students to come and explore new thoughts, ac
tivities and ways of living, they are attempting to turn
it into a totalitarian academic oligarchy, where stu
dents passively and obediently follow the guidance
of the faculty and administration.
Just look around, it's happening all around you.
Non-conformist faculty are being weeded out or

denied tenure; certain student groups are being pun
ished excessively for minor infractions and certain
living groups are also being harassed and even ter
minated. The admissions policy has already been
changed to one where more studious, less ob
noxious students are being admitted.
Now, I'm not saying that Stanford will cease to lie a
good school. It will always be considered one of the
best. But once this dark cloud of conformity com
pletely descends upon the campus, Stanford will only

be something like seventh best in the nation. But
most importantly, the freedom, disobedience and
"true intellectualism" (the mind development that
comes from defying authority) will be gone. It's
really sad to see someplace that was so good get
messed up, but what can one do? Speaking out or
showing anarchical traits receive threats of suspen
sion or dismissal. And so, little by little, dissent disap
pears, the authoritative grip tightens, and Stanford
inches ever so closer to being like everyone else. It's
really sad.
