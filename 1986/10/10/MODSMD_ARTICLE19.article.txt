# Divestment is a moral duty
## 
### 
Allen Estes' recent column (Daily, Oct. 6) begins: "As the
movement to divest all U.S. holdings in South Africa ac
celerates, fewer and fewer people are asking whether di
vestment is wise, helpful or in the best interests of the
United States." He goes on to argue that divestment would
be neither helpful (i.e. efficacious) nor in the best interests
of the United States. What about wisdom? Is there nothing
more to wise moral judgement than considerations of ef
ficacy?
Estes points out that direct U.S. investment constitutes
less than 2 percent of South Africa's gross national product.
Thus, South Africa can survive perfectly well on its own. He

is no doubt correct in stating that "the effect of our coercion
is limited." However, the argument cuts both ways: The con
structive effect of companies staying in South Africa and set
ting a good example by adhering to the Sullivan Principles
would be equally limited. In other words, what we have
before us to consider is not the use of some powerful
weapon, but merely a gesture, little more than a voice
crying from across the ocean.
But does this mean that our moral choice is any less im
portant? Absolutely not. Does not the acid test of ethical be
havior come when we are faced with a call to stand up for
what is right even though it may cost us something, yet not
have much practical effect?
We must assume that the good is an end in itself. If we
don't grant that, we have no basis at all for our moral stand
ards, whatever they may be. For if the good is not good
regardless of whether it wins out, then whatever wins out is
good becuse it wins out. In other words, power becomes
the standard which replaces the good. That's a bad state of
affairs, folks.
Regarding divestment, or any other issue of public
morality, we ought to be asking, first of all, what is the
morally correct course of action. Yet all I seem to hear these
days are arguments about whether such and such a course
of action will be effective or not. That is not moral reason

ing; that is pragmatism. I am not saying the two are mutually
exclusive, but I am insisting they are independent.
When Mr. Estes writes, "if violent overthrow is indeed in
evitable, then we should divest to cut our losses," he is
keeping die argument in the sphere of pragmatism, an in
sidious tactic. I have no quarrel, though, with the sentence
which immediately precedes this: "To divest is to wash our
hands of the South Africans and admit there is nothing help
ful left to employ." This is more or less true, but that does
not make divestment an act of weakness. We are all familiar
with and — I hope — embarrassed by the paternalistic atti
tude that the United States is the world's moral watchdog.
To steer clear of this attitude does not mean that we should
avoid taking moral stands, only that we should not persist in
a chauvinistic, exaggerated view of our influence. Moral
strength and power to effect change are two very different
things. Often — though by no means invariably — the
greatest examples of moral courage come from the ranks of
the powerless.
Admittedly, South Africa is a strong nation, and even the
U.S. government does not have a great deal of clout in in
fluencing its internal affairs; Stanford has barely any. Fur
thermore, we are bound by other moral principles to limit
the extent of our meddling. If one has some contact with
evil and not a great deal of power to change it, one's first
responsbility is to exhort those in power to change their
ways. When that fails, one is morally obligated to dissociate
himself from that evil. Otherwise, one shares in the respon
sibility for it. That is not a morally weak choice. It is simply
the right choice when one is not in a strong position of in
fluence.
Divestment is nothing less than a way of calling the white
government of South Africa a liar. It is a way of saying that
we are not impressed with the tokens of liberalization they
have thrown out to appease the indignation of the global
community. It is not a "quick-fix solution" it is not a solu
tion at all. It is a final statement of disgust at decade upon
decade of shameless resistance to the establishment of so
cial justice.
