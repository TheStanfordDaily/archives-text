The scene: It's Friday and classes are over. You find some
friends and decide to go on a bike ride. While walking over
to the bike racks, you notice two adults pointing at you and
gesturing excitedly. Funny, they look familiar.
It can't be.
It's your parents.
Not to worry. It's Parents' Weekend, and they are
supposed to be here. They are going to have so much to do
they will hardly have time to see you. And, they have com
pany.
More than 1,500 parents will be spending this weekend at

the Farm, a 50 percent increase over last year's Parents'
Weekend turnout.
"A lot of siblings and grandparents will be coming, too.
So it's really a family event," said Debbie Duncan, director
of the Stanford Parents' Fund and organizer of Parents'
Weekend.
"Also, we expect about 100 or 150 parents to just show
up, not having realized they were supposed to register,"
said senior Tanya Novak, a student director of the weekend.
A parent vs. student softball game at the Sunken Diamond
tomorrow morning will be a new event. San Francisco

Chronicle columnist Herb Caen is scheduled to be one of
the parent team captains. Caen said he expects to play
against his son Christopher, a Stanford junior.
"He's good, and I'm not so good. In fact, it'll probably be a
shambles because I haven't practiced," the elder Caen said.
"But we'll cheat a lot. By hook or by crook, I'm looking
forward to winning this game. Everything will be under
handed!"
The welcome by University President Don Kennedy and
the family tailgate party were the favorite events last year
and should be popular again, Duncan said.
"We're expecting 1,100 people to attend the family picnic
on Saturday. That means 1,100 shish kebabs, 1,100 brownies
and 1,100 bags of popcorn."
Sounds good. Yet you still have questions. Mom and Dad
are too smart to think they're paying $16,000 a year for you
to go to picnics. Should they see another side of your life
here? What about academic life at the University?
The answer is faculty lectures. Parents can choose from
"How to Read the Short Story," "Understanding the Brain"
and "Love or Marriage: Pick Only One?" in the first session
of lectures, at 2:15 this afternoon.
And you still have time for that bike ride, because at 3:30
p.m. parents can decide between "Remembering Solar En
ergy and Conservation During the Oil Glut," "The Black
Magic Myth of the Mass Media" and "Athletics and Civiliza
tion."
Professors Nancy Packer, Craig Heller, Jerry Talley, Gil
Masters, Jeremy Cohen and Antony Raubitscheck,
respectively, will be giving the talks. They were nominated
by a student committee formed to choose their favorite pro
fessors.
Duncan swears that everything went as planned last year
for Parents' Weekend. The only changes to date in the pro
gram are the times for two of tomorrow's events, made ne
cessary when the kickoff for the Washington football game
was changed from 1:30 to 4 p.m..
That means the tailgate picnic will be moved from noon
to 1 p.m., "which will make the caterers happy," Duncan
said.
Sunday Night Flicks Saturday Night Special times will also
be changed, from a one-time showing at 8 p.m. to two
showings at 7 and 9:30, according to Duncan, who expects a
large turnout for the 9:30 showing.
Adding the Sunday Flicks for parents was Novak's idea.
"I'd always tried to explain the Flicks to my parents, and
all the paper-throwing sounded kind of silly. It's one of
those things you have to experience," she said.
Also new this year is programming on Sunday, instituted
at the request of parents who attended past Parents'
Weekends. Some parents are coming from as far away as
Belgium and Singapore, and wanted to make the long jour
ney more worthwhile.
Sunday features a morning talk titled "The Other Side of
Academic Life: Campus Spirituality," hosted by a multi
denominational group of campus ministers, as well as a buf

fet lunch at which Hoover fellow Alvin Rabushka will ad
dress the question, "Is Tax Reform Finished?"
This Parents' Weekend is the second one in as many
years. The Weekend use to be an annual tradition, but was
discontinued in the 1960s because it "wasn't in vogue," only
to be revived last year, according to Novak.
The mother of a Stanford football player first suggested
the idea of resuscitating the Parents' Weekend tradition.
"She noticed there are activities for mothers of Stanford
football players and thought, "Why not have something for
all parents?' " Duncan said.
Although parents pay for meals, they are not asked to pay
a registration fee. This means that Parents' Weekend does
not pay for itself. It costs about $12,000, paid for by the Par

ems' Fund budget. If the weekend continues to be held
every year, a registration fee of $5 or $10 may be charged in
the fiiture, according to Duncan.
Finally, freshmen will be comforted to know that they
won't be alone this weekend in hearing their families
debate the linguistic origin of such strange words as "Mem
Chu" and "Mem Aud." Parents of sophomores, juniors and
seniors will be arriving in almost equal numbers to those of
freshmen, according to Duncan.
So, if your folks don't quite jump at the right time during
"All Right Now" this weekend, go easy on them. After all,
you want Dad to be in a good mood when you explain that
your ten-speed bike was stolen again.
Bike? What bike?
