# Morris meditates, educates

### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
Imagine finals week without
stress.
OK, those of you who are fresh
man, imagine a first date without
stress.
Aaaaah, that's nice.
Let's enlarge this a little: Imagine a
world free of stress and tension, full
of people at peace with themselves
and each other.
Mmmm ... even nicer.
It's diffficult to imagine, certainly,
but that kind of stress-free, peaceful
world is the ultimate goal of
transcendental meditation, accord
ing to Dr. Bevan Morris, president of
Maharishi International University.
Morris, speaking at Stanford today
on the role of TM in education and
everyday life, explains that TM has
both a personal dimension and a
larger, societal dimension.
"Transcendental meditation
releases stress; that increases mental
and physical energy,... and it
definitely increases creativity and in
telligence," he says.
Furthermore, Morris continues,
group transcendental meditation can
be a significant force for promoting
peace among people.

"The importance of this is as a way
of producing peace, because nothing
else is doing that," he says.
Dr. Nancy Lonsdorf, formerly in
residence in the Stanford Medical
Center Department of Psychiatry and
another exponent of TM, explains
further:
"TM has benefits for the individ
ual. But the real goal of TM is to
bring peace to the individual and
thereby to bring about a more
peaceful world," Lonsdorf says.
"When individuals become less
stressed, that has an influence on
other people ... there have been
some very good studies on people

practicing TM in a community ...
they show a significant correlation
between people practicing TM and
reduced crime rates, lower numbers
of people checking into hospitals"
and similar positive effects.
The long-range goals of TM, then,
are rather ambitious and complex.
But the technique itself is not partic
ularly complicated or mystical, ac
cording to Morris.
"TM is a single mental technique
that produces a state of complete
silence and restful alertness," he
says. It is ordinarily practiced for 15-
20 minutes twice a day, and "is not
religious in its orientation," but is
rather a "mechanical-scientific tech
nique."
John Black, director of the
Transcendental Meditation Program
in Palo Alto, says that "the purpose of
any kind of meditation is to develop
consciousness," and "consciousness
determines the level of our success
in everything we do."
In TM, the highest state of that
consciousness is awareness and ex
perience of what Morris refers to as
"the unified field."
"The unified field is the basic field
of natural law — the single field


Dr. Bevan Morris
President, M.I.U.
from which all laws of nature arrive
which are responsible for this uni
verse, Morris explains. It's a physical
field which can be experienced as the
fundamental state of our own con
sciousness."
One of the most basic premises be
hind TM is the belief, as Morris puts it,
that "the human brain is capable of ex
periencing the unified field."
In physiological terms, what all this
means is that TM "increases brain wave
coherence, as measured on an
electroencephalagraph," says Black,
going on to explain that increased
brain wave coherence is "a physiologi
cal signature of more integrated brain
functioning."
TM reduces stress and raises physi
cal energy levels because, according to
Black, in 20 minutes of TM the body's

metabolic rate drops twice as much as
in deepest sleep," so that TM erases
stress that sleep never reaches.
A more advanced type of TM is
called "TM-Sidhi," according to
Lonsdorf. The effects of TM-Sidhi,
when it is practiced in a group, are
more intense than those of regular TM.
Exponents of TM contend that there
would be a significant effect on efforts
for world peace if less than 1 percent
of the world's population were to
practice TM-Sidhi as a community.
Morris puts the number of people
necessary for such a significant effect at
roughly 7,000.
The founder of TM, Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi, currently has some 2,000
individuals gathered in India practic
ing TM-Fidhi together, according to
Lonsdorf.
Morris's school, the Maharishi Inter
national University (M.1.U.) in Fairfield,
lowa, which offers programs at pre
school through Ph.D. levels, is similar
to any other American school, with the

distinction that all of its students
practice TM twice a day.
The result, says Morris, is that M.I.U.
produces students who are "very well
prepared to deal with careers and
normal adult life.
Morris reports that M.I.U. alumni
who go into business careers "report a
level of satisfaction with their educa
tion that is two to three times higher
than the national average," as gleaned
from annual surveys.
Further studies have shown that stu
dents practicing TM in conjunction
with their educations have shown sig
nificant increases in both I.Q. and GPA
in comparison to control groups not
practicing TM.
A lecture series will soon be circulat
ing the country to espouse the value of
TM in association with education, ac
cording to Morris.
"We would like to see that as many
students as possible have the benefits
of this technology," says Morris.

students as possible have the benefits
of this technology," says Morris.
Imagine finals week without
stress.
OK, those of you who are fresh
man, imagine a first date without
stress.
Aaaaah, that's nice.
Let's enlarge this a little: Imagine a
world free of stress and tension, full
of people at peace with themselves
and each other.
Mmmm ... even nicer.
It's diffficult to imagine, certainly,
but that kind of stress-free, peaceful
world is the ultimate goal of
transcendental meditation, accord
ing to Dr. Bevan Morris, president of
Maharishi International University.
Morris, speaking at Stanford today
on the role of TM in education and
everyday life, explains that TM has
both a personal dimension and a
larger, societal dimension.
"Transcendental meditation
releases stress; that increases mental
and physical energy,... and it
definitely increases creativity and in
telligence," he says.
Furthermore, Morris continues,
group transcendental meditation can
be a significant force for promoting
peace among people.

"The importance of this is as a way
of producing peace, because nothing
else is doing that," he says.
Dr. Nancy Lonsdorf, formerly in
residence in the Stanford Medical
Center Department of Psychiatry and
another exponent of TM, explains
further:
"TM has benefits for the individ
ual. But the real goal of TM is to
bring peace to the individual and
thereby to bring about a more
peaceful world," Lonsdorf says.
"When individuals become less
stressed, that has an influence on
other people ... there have been
some very good studies on people

practicing TM in a community ...
they show a significant correlation
between people practicing TM and
reduced crime rates, lower numbers
of people checking into hospitals"
and similar positive effects.
The long-range goals of TM, then,
are rather ambitious and complex.
But the technique itself is not partic
ularly complicated or mystical, ac
cording to Morris.
"TM is a single mental technique
that produces a state of complete
silence and restful alertness," he
says. It is ordinarily practiced for 15-
20 minutes twice a day, and "is not
religious in its orientation," but is
rather a "mechanical-scientific tech
nique."
John Black, director of the
Transcendental Meditation Program
in Palo Alto, says that "the purpose of
any kind of meditation is to develop
consciousness," and "consciousness
determines the level of our success
in everything we do."
In TM, the highest state of that
consciousness is awareness and ex
perience of what Morris refers to as
"the unified field."
"The unified field is the basic field
of natural law — the single field


Dr. Bevan Morris
President, M.I.U.
from which all laws of nature arrive
which are responsible for this uni
verse, Morris explains. It's a physical
field which can be experienced as the
fundamental state of our own con
sciousness."
One of the most basic premises be
hind TM is the belief, as Morris puts it,
that "the human brain is capable of ex
periencing the unified field."
In physiological terms, what all this
means is that TM "increases brain wave
coherence, as measured on an
electroencephalagraph," says Black,
going on to explain that increased
brain wave coherence is "a physiologi
cal signature of more integrated brain
functioning."
TM reduces stress and raises physi
cal energy levels because, according to
Black, in 20 minutes of TM the body's

metabolic rate drops twice as much as
in deepest sleep," so that TM erases
stress that sleep never reaches.
A more advanced type of TM is
called "TM-Sidhi," according to
Lonsdorf. The effects of TM-Sidhi,
when it is practiced in a group, are
more intense than those of regular TM.
Exponents of TM contend that there
would be a significant effect on efforts
for world peace if less than 1 percent
of the world's population were to
practice TM-Sidhi as a community.
Morris puts the number of people
necessary for such a significant effect at
roughly 7,000.
The founder of TM, Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi, currently has some 2,000
individuals gathered in India practic
ing TM-Fidhi together, according to
Lonsdorf.
Morris's school, the Maharishi Inter
national University (M.1.U.) in Fairfield,
lowa, which offers programs at pre
school through Ph.D. levels, is similar
to any other American school, with the

distinction that all of its students
practice TM twice a day.
The result, says Morris, is that M.I.U.
produces students who are "very well
prepared to deal with careers and
normal adult life.
Morris reports that M.I.U. alumni
who go into business careers "report a
level of satisfaction with their educa
tion that is two to three times higher
than the national average," as gleaned
from annual surveys.
Further studies have shown that stu
dents practicing TM in conjunction
with their educations have shown sig
nificant increases in both I.Q. and GPA
in comparison to control groups not
practicing TM.
A lecture series will soon be circulat
ing the country to espouse the value of
TM in association with education, ac
cording to Morris.
