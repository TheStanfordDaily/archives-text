Imagine finals week without
stress.
OK, those of you who are fresh
man, imagine a first date without
stress.
Aaaaah, that's nice.
Let's enlarge this a little: Imagine a
world free of stress and tension, full
of people at peace with themselves
and each other.
Mmmm ... even nicer.
It's diffficult to imagine, certainly,
but that kind of stress-free, peaceful
world is the ultimate goal of
transcendental meditation, accord
ing to Dr. Bevan Morris, president of
Maharishi International University.
Morris, speaking at Stanford today
on the role of TM in education and
everyday life, explains that TM has
both a personal dimension and a
larger, societal dimension.
"Transcendental meditation
releases stress; that increases mental
and physical energy,... and it
definitely increases creativity and in
telligence," he says.
Furthermore, Morris continues,
group transcendental meditation can
be a significant force for promoting
peace among people.

"The importance of this is as a way
of producing peace, because nothing
else is doing that," he says.
Dr. Nancy Lonsdorf, formerly in
residence in the Stanford Medical
Center Department of Psychiatry and
another exponent of TM, explains
further:
"TM has benefits for the individ
ual. But the real goal of TM is to
bring peace to the individual and
thereby to bring about a more
peaceful world," Lonsdorf says.
"When individuals become less
stressed, that has an influence on
other people ... there have been
some very good studies on people

practicing TM in a community ...
they show a significant correlation
between people practicing TM and
reduced crime rates, lower numbers
of people checking into hospitals"
and similar positive effects.
The long-range goals of TM, then,
are rather ambitious and complex.
But the technique itself is not partic
ularly complicated or mystical, ac
cording to Morris.
"TM is a single mental technique
that produces a state of complete
silence and restful alertness," he
says. It is ordinarily practiced for 15-
20 minutes twice a day, and "is not
religious in its orientation," but is
rather a "mechanical-scientific tech
nique."
John Black, director of the
Transcendental Meditation Program
in Palo Alto, says that "the purpose of
any kind of meditation is to develop
consciousness," and "consciousness
determines the level of our success
in everything we do."
In TM, the highest state of that
consciousness is awareness and ex
perience of what Morris refers to as
"the unified field."
"The unified field is the basic field
of natural law â€” the single field
