Welcome to KZSU Picks, a bi-weekly
record review column in which the
KZSU staff pronounces its erudite criti
cal judgements on the newest releases.
If you don't know what KZSU is, shame
on you. Anyway, this is not your usual
run-of-the-mill review column. Rather
than use boring old stars to rate an al
bum, our reviewers like to rank
records, as well as rank on them, with
strange and random things. Case in
point: This week's albums are rated by
new TV shows that are doomed to fail
miserably. (So "Alf" isn't going to make
it, huh? That's too bad. He sure was a
cute little sucker).
Fishbone— "In Your Face"
"My Sister Sam"
"My Sister Sam"
"My Sister Sam"
"My Sister Sam"
You remember these wacky guys,
right? They put out an EP about two
years ago chock full o' their unique
brand of funny and hyperactive ska
punk (we call it "skunk"). It didn't
really catch on, perhaps because their
music just didn't fit in to any of your
usual radio molds. Or maybe it was be
cause about half the songs on the
record were forgettable excursions
which took a potentially fun idea for a
three-and-a-half minute song and
drove it about six miles into the crust
of the earth.
Diversity is the spice of life, whether
you're at Stanford or in a skunk band

from Los Angeles. On "In Your Face,"
the fellas have given us a variety of mu
sical experiences on the album.
Sure, there's the requisite number
of trendy dance-alongs based on silly
themes like having dates or the threat
of nuclear war. But now there's other
stuff: songs performed at different
speeds, songs that are only three-and
a-half-minutes long, songs that appear
to be Fishbone's idea of what a soft bal-

lad or a love song should be — noth
ing Julio Iglesias is gonna call them
about covering, mind you, but there is
some change in tempo.
Furthermore, it appears that the
dudes have settled their civil war re
garding the speeds of the fast songs.
Previously, the vocals had gone along
at speeds which left the rest of the in
struments in the dust. This made the

desirable listening speed about 45
rpm, which meant you had to deal with
squeaky vocals and irate EE neighbors.
But now, all is peachy. It's a happy
time.

Paul Simon — "Graceland"
"The Ellen Burstyn Show"
"The Ellen Burstyn Show"
"The Ellen Burstyn Show"
"The Ellen Burstyn Show"
"The Ellen"
The Short Little Man with the Reced
ing Hairline has once again done just
fine without The Man with the Big
Hair. One is struck by this album's con
fidence; it shows that Simon has
reached perfection as a songwriter. His
lyrics are full of wonderful glimpses
into the weird conglomeration that is
American society: "She's got diamonds
on the soles of her shoes/Well, that's
one way to lose these/Walking
blues... ./The poor boy changes
clothes/And puts on aftershave/To
compensate for his ordinary shoes."
And: "She looked me over/And I guess
she thought/I was all right/All right in a

sort of limited way/For an off-night."
In "Graceland," Simon gives us an
album that is striking both for its pow
erful images and its music. He diverts
from his traditional folk/blues sound
by recording nine of the 11 songs with
musicians from Soweto (the other two
are with Los Lobos and a Cajun band),
and the album is an unusual mix of
African beat and '50s rhythm and blues.
Songs like "Homeless," a beautiful a
capella song half in an African dialect
and half in English; "Graceland," about
Simon's pilgrimage to Elvis Presley's
home and "Diamonds on the Soles of
Her Shoes" make the album a sheer
joy, despite some of the overly com
mercial sensibilities of others, like
"You Can Call Me Al" and "Crazy Love,
Volume II." We're pretty stoked about
this $8 slab of vinyl.
— Atul Gawande
The Human League — "Crash"
"ALF"
"ALF"
Music sure is a funny thing. Think
about it. How many different notes are
there that the human ear can pick up?

How many different ways can the
human being manipulate those notes?
How many different rhythm tracks can
the Human League go through in a
career? Well, you could go crazy think
ing about the first two, but the third
one has a definite answer — current
Zoo Picks Census Research puts it at
somewhere between one and two.
Of course, this kind of raw data is
understandably incomprehensible to

the non-professional record reviewer,
so we're pleased to help out where we
can. You see, it comes down to the fact
that the League, like your hair dryer,
has two settings: high and low. Now,
this can be done right. You can get
really upbeat, danceable, airhead pop
that sounds like it was almost mixed to
death on the former setting, and on the
other get cavity-inducing disco ballads

which ask such philosophical ques
tions as, "Ooh baby, don't you wanna
love me, cuz I sure do love you?," but
somehow still make you want to shed
those in-tempo tears on atmosphere
alone.
Well, we're sorta used to the
Humans succeeding at any speed. But
on "Crash" (a tempting title for us,
which we will mercifully ignore), the
band seems to have wandered into the
largely uncharted zone of badly done
junk music. It couldn't have been easy
to do. After all, when you're in the
mood for throbbing mindlessness, you
figure what the heck, the worse, the
better. But when Philip Oakley's occa
sionally soothing baritone is the only
thing reminding you of the value of life
for 40 minutes straight, you are not
having a good record experience.
Instead, you are listening to an end
less slew of really annoying shrill
voices chopped up and grilled slowly,
painfully, over a bed of smoldering
and uninteresting synth-noises, in both
fast and slow modes. Oh, every once in
a while, the League sorta stumbles into
a groove you can dig, but they don't
seem to remember how they got there
once the inevitable slow fade into the
Land of Redundant Choruses begins.
OK, so no one ever said the Human
League was going to make a master
piece. We just wanted something to eat
twinkies by.

the Human League go through in a
career? Well, you could go crazy think
ing about the first two, but the third
one has a definite answer — current
Zoo Picks Census Research puts it at
somewhere between one and two.
Of course, this kind of raw data is
understandably incomprehensible to

the non-professional record reviewer,
so we're pleased to help out where we
can. You see, it comes down to the fact
that the League, like your hair dryer,
has two settings: high and low. Now,
this can be done right. You can get
really upbeat, danceable, airhead pop
that sounds like it was almost mixed to
death on the former setting, and on the
other get cavity-inducing disco ballads

which ask such philosophical ques
tions as, "Ooh baby, don't you wanna
love me, cuz I sure do love you?," but
somehow still make you want to shed
those in-tempo tears on atmosphere
alone.
Well, we're sorta used to the
Humans succeeding at any speed. But
on "Crash" (a tempting title for us,
which we will mercifully ignore), the
band seems to have wandered into the
largely uncharted zone of badly done
junk music. It couldn't have been easy
to do. After all, when you're in the
mood for throbbing mindlessness, you
figure what the heck, the worse, the
better. But when Philip Oakley's occa
sionally soothing baritone is the only
thing reminding you of the value of life
for 40 minutes straight, you are not
having a good record experience.
Instead, you are listening to an end
less slew of really annoying shrill
voices chopped up and grilled slowly,
painfully, over a bed of smoldering
and uninteresting synth-noises, in both
fast and slow modes. Oh, every once in
a while, the League sorta stumbles into
a groove you can dig, but they don't
seem to remember how they got there
once the inevitable slow fade into the
Land of Redundant Choruses begins.
OK, so no one ever said the Human
League was going to make a master
piece. We just wanted something to eat
twinkies by.

Welcome to KZSU Picks, a bi-weekly
record review column in which the
KZSU staff pronounces its erudite criti
cal judgements on the newest releases.
If you don't know what KZSU is, shame
on you. Anyway, this is not your usual
run-of-the-mill review column. Rather
than use boring old stars to rate an al
bum, our reviewers like to rank
records, as well as rank on them, with
strange and random things. Case in
point: This week's albums are rated by
new TV shows that are doomed to fail
miserably. (So "Alf" isn't going to make
it, huh? That's too bad. He sure was a
cute little sucker).
Fishbone— "In Your Face"
"My Sister Sam"
"My Sister Sam"
"My Sister Sam"
"My Sister Sam"
You remember these wacky guys,
right? They put out an EP about two
years ago chock full o' their unique
brand of funny and hyperactive ska
punk (we call it "skunk"). It didn't
really catch on, perhaps because their
music just didn't fit in to any of your
usual radio molds. Or maybe it was be
cause about half the songs on the
record were forgettable excursions
which took a potentially fun idea for a
three-and-a-half minute song and
drove it about six miles into the crust
of the earth.
Diversity is the spice of life, whether
you're at Stanford or in a skunk band

from Los Angeles. On "In Your Face,"
the fellas have given us a variety of mu
sical experiences on the album.
Sure, there's the requisite number
of trendy dance-alongs based on silly
themes like having dates or the threat
of nuclear war. But now there's other
stuff: songs performed at different
speeds, songs that are only three-and
a-half-minutes long, songs that appear
to be Fishbone's idea of what a soft bal-

lad or a love song should be — noth
ing Julio Iglesias is gonna call them
about covering, mind you, but there is
some change in tempo.
Furthermore, it appears that the
dudes have settled their civil war re
garding the speeds of the fast songs.
Previously, the vocals had gone along
at speeds which left the rest of the in
struments in the dust. This made the

desirable listening speed about 45
rpm, which meant you had to deal with
squeaky vocals and irate EE neighbors.
But now, all is peachy. It's a happy
time.

Paul Simon — "Graceland"
"The Ellen Burstyn Show"
"The Ellen Burstyn Show"
"The Ellen Burstyn Show"
"The Ellen Burstyn Show"
"The Ellen"
The Short Little Man with the Reced
ing Hairline has once again done just
fine without The Man with the Big
Hair. One is struck by this album's con
fidence; it shows that Simon has
reached perfection as a songwriter. His
lyrics are full of wonderful glimpses
into the weird conglomeration that is
American society: "She's got diamonds
on the soles of her shoes/Well, that's
one way to lose these/Walking
blues... ./The poor boy changes
clothes/And puts on aftershave/To
compensate for his ordinary shoes."
And: "She looked me over/And I guess
she thought/I was all right/All right in a

sort of limited way/For an off-night."
In "Graceland," Simon gives us an
album that is striking both for its pow
erful images and its music. He diverts
from his traditional folk/blues sound
by recording nine of the 11 songs with
musicians from Soweto (the other two
are with Los Lobos and a Cajun band),
and the album is an unusual mix of
African beat and '50s rhythm and blues.
Songs like "Homeless," a beautiful a
capella song half in an African dialect
and half in English; "Graceland," about
Simon's pilgrimage to Elvis Presley's
home and "Diamonds on the Soles of
Her Shoes" make the album a sheer
joy, despite some of the overly com
mercial sensibilities of others, like
"You Can Call Me Al" and "Crazy Love,
Volume II." We're pretty stoked about
this $8 slab of vinyl.

The Human League — "Crash"

Music sure is a funny thing. Think
about it. How many different notes are
there that the human ear can pick up?

How many different ways can the
human being manipulate those notes?
