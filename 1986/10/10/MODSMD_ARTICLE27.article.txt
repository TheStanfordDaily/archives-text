# 'Blue Velvet' is a bore

### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
I didn't like "Blue Velvet." Many critics, however, have
lauded David Lynch's latest film for its unorthodox style.
Actually, I must admit that after a summer movie season
filled with the recycled plots and formula screenwriting
of such hits as "Top Gun" and "Karate Kid II," it is quite
refreshing to see a movie that dares to be different, and
"Blue Velvet" definitely succeeds on that level. Unfortun
ately, being "different" doesn't always translate into
quality, and although "Blue Velvet" is unusual and
technically well-made, the final product is muddled and
emotionally uninvolving.
"Blue Velvet's" problems can best be summed up as a
case of style over substance. The basic plot of "Velvet" is
an interesting, perverse allegory of the struggle between
good and evil. Alas, Lynch fails to bring any new insights
to this theme.
The one thing that could have saved this movie for me
was an interesting hero. Kyle MacLachan, who plays Jeff

Beaumont, the so-called lead character, should function
to some extent as a figure with whom the audience can
identify and care about. Instead MacLachan (who is now
zero-for-two in terms of his movie career â€” his first loss
was "Dune") turns in a pallid performance that does
nothing to increase the audience's involvement with the
film.
Laura Dern, who was so good in "Smooth Talk," is
hopelessly miscast as a subservient "nice girl," spending
most of her time staring dreamily into MacLachan's eyes.
Dennis Hopper gives another one of his patented
portrayals of a drug-crazed psycho, while Isabella Ros
selini is pleasant to look at in a thankless, one
dimensional role.
The one thing Lynch has going for him is his visual
flair, but visuals alone aren't enough to sustain this film.
"Blue Velvet" fails to deliver an interesting character or
evoke an empathetic response, problems which over
whelm it by the end. These problems leave the viewer
feeling as though he's been through a strange but ulti
mately empty experience.
