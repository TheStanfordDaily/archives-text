Citizen Kane (1941)
Pagoda Palace, San Francisco
Orson Welles was only in his mid
-205 when he came to Hollywood to
make this film, but he had already es
tablished himself as an enfant terrible
on Broadway and on radio. The bris
tling, vibrant feeling of the picture is
due in part to the youthfulness of most
of the people who collaborated on it
(only the screenwriter, Herman J.
Mankiewicz, had been working in
movies for long) and in pan to the
subject: publisher William Randolph
Hearst, who was still very much alive.
An extraordinary movie. With Welles
as Kane, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Com
ingore, Ruth Warrick, Agnes
Moorehead and Everett Sloane;
photographed by the great Gregg
Toland.
Plays today and tomorrow with "The
Magnificent Ambersons," Monday with
"The Lady From Shanghai," Tuesday
with "Macbeth," Wednesday with
"Touch of Evil" and Thursday with
"Mr Arkadin."

The Magnificent Ambersons
(1942)
RKO decided that Orson Welles had
been too extravagant with their time
and money when he made this film
(his second, right after "Citizen
Kane"), so they cut 40 minutes out of it
and gave him a reputation for ir
responsibility that he has never
managed to live down. Even in its
truncated form, "Ambersons" is one of
the great American movies. It
chronicles the tumbling of the gra
cious, tiered society of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries into the age of
greed through the descent of one
grand family. Welles evokes the declin
ing Victorian period in scenes of balls
and sleigh rides that one does not for
get, and his depiction of the private
bickering of a public family is almost
expressionistic. A barely adequate Tim
Holt plays the focal character, young
George Miniver, but the rest of the cast
is extraordinary, especially Agnes
Moorehead as his embittered spinster
aunt, Richard Bennett as his grandfat
her, Dolores Costello as his mother
and Joseph Cotten as the rejected
suitor who loves her all his life. With
music by Bernard Herrmann and for
midable photography by Stanley Cor
tez.

The Lady From Shanghai (1948)
Orson Welles made this insanely
complicated and thoroughly bizarre
murder mystery, adapting his over

written screenplay from a novel by
Sherwood King. He plays the hero, too
— an Irish sailor who hires on to crew
a yacht belonging to a brilliant crimi
nal lawyer (Everett Sloane) and his al
luring wife (Rita Hayworth). Welles
and Hayworth were undergoing
divorce proceedings while the movie
was in production, and that may have
contributed to Welles' depiction of the
Bannisters' marriage in this movie —
they are as nasty and hateful a couple
as any ever put on the screen. This is a
very entertaining piece of stylized hys
teria, directed with astonishing wit and
cool assurance. Welles' performance
isn't any good (and his Irish accent is
as unconvincing as his Scottish brogue
in "Macbeth"), but Everett Sloane is
terrific as Arthur Bannister, who walks
bent over like a stick figure, a pair of
(unexplained) crutches close to his
legs. The film is most famous, of
course, for the spectacular crazy house
finale — one of the high points of
American fibr(s of this period.
— S.v.
Macbeth (1948)
Orson Welles filmed Shakespeare's
tragedy in a matter of weeks on a Gene
Autry set at Republic Pictures. (That ex
plains much of the desperately sweep
ing camera movement.) It would be
nice to say that he turned out a gem
under these atrocious conditions, but
visually audacious as this "Macbeth" is
— it's seldom boring — it cannot fairly
be called a good movie. Welles gives a
distracted performance in the title
role; his peculiar decision to outfit
everyone with Scottish accents really
blocks him, and it finishes off Jeanette
Nolan's Lady Macbeth. She is perhaps
the worst Lady Macbeth of any century.
The sole survivor of this mesmerizing
mess is Dan O'Herlihy, who brings
something very fine and subtle to the
role of Macduff.
— S.v.
Touch of Evil (1958)
Nearly two decades after "Citizen
Kane," Orson Welles made this breath
taking baroque thriller. He and his
photographer, Russell Metty, shot the
film in Venice, Calif., but it seems to
have been made in hell, and no one
who has seen it can drive through
Venice without thinking he is in hell.
The peculiarly effective cast includes
Welles himself, Marlene Dietrich,
Charlton Heston, Akim Tamiroff,
Joseph Cotten, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mer
cedes McCambridge and Janet Leigh,
who has an extremely unpleasant pre
"Psycho" encounter in a motel.

— an Irish sailor who hires on to crew
a yacht belonging to a brilliant crimi
nal lawyer (Everett Sloane) and his al
luring wife (Rita Hayworth). Welles
and Hayworth were undergoing
divorce proceedings while the movie
was in production, and that may have
contributed to Welles' depiction of the
Bannisters' marriage in this movie —
they are as nasty and hateful a couple
as any ever put on the screen. This is a
very entertaining piece of stylized hys
teria, directed with astonishing wit and
cool assurance. Welles' performance
isn't any good (and his Irish accent is
as unconvincing as his Scottish brogue
in "Macbeth"), but Everett Sloane is
terrific as Arthur Bannister, who walks
bent over like a stick figure, a pair of
(unexplained) crutches close to his
legs. The film is most famous, of
course, for the spectacular crazy house
finale — one of the high points of
American fibr(s of this period.

Macbeth (1948)
Orson Welles filmed Shakespeare's
tragedy in a matter of weeks on a Gene
Autry set at Republic Pictures. (That ex
plains much of the desperately sweep
ing camera movement.) It would be
nice to say that he turned out a gem
under these atrocious conditions, but
visually audacious as this "Macbeth" is
— it's seldom boring — it cannot fairly
be called a good movie. Welles gives a
distracted performance in the title
role; his peculiar decision to outfit
everyone with Scottish accents really
blocks him, and it finishes off Jeanette
Nolan's Lady Macbeth. She is perhaps
the worst Lady Macbeth of any century.
The sole survivor of this mesmerizing
mess is Dan O'Herlihy, who brings
something very fine and subtle to the
role of Macduff.
— S.v.
Touch of Evil (1958)
Nearly two decades after "Citizen
Kane," Orson Welles made this breath
taking baroque thriller. He and his
photographer, Russell Metty, shot the
film in Venice, Calif., but it seems to
have been made in hell, and no one
who has seen it can drive through
Venice without thinking he is in hell.
The peculiarly effective cast includes
Welles himself, Marlene Dietrich,
Charlton Heston, Akim Tamiroff,
Joseph Cotten, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mer
cedes McCambridge and Janet Leigh,
who has an extremely unpleasant pre
"Psycho" encounter in a motel.

Citizen Kane (1941)
Pagoda Palace, San Francisco
Orson Welles was only in his mid
-205 when he came to Hollywood to
make this film, but he had already es
tablished himself as an enfant terrible
on Broadway and on radio. The bris
tling, vibrant feeling of the picture is
due in part to the youthfulness of most
of the people who collaborated on it
(only the screenwriter, Herman J.
Mankiewicz, had been working in
movies for long) and in pan to the
subject: publisher William Randolph
Hearst, who was still very much alive.
An extraordinary movie. With Welles
as Kane, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Com
ingore, Ruth Warrick, Agnes
Moorehead and Everett Sloane;
photographed by the great Gregg
Toland.
Plays today and tomorrow with "The
Magnificent Ambersons," Monday with
"The Lady From Shanghai," Tuesday
with "Macbeth," Wednesday with
"Touch of Evil" and Thursday with
"Mr Arkadin."

The Magnificent Ambersons
(1942)
RKO decided that Orson Welles had
been too extravagant with their time
and money when he made this film
(his second, right after "Citizen
Kane"), so they cut 40 minutes out of it
and gave him a reputation for ir
responsibility that he has never
managed to live down. Even in its
truncated form, "Ambersons" is one of
the great American movies. It
chronicles the tumbling of the gra
cious, tiered society of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries into the age of
greed through the descent of one
grand family. Welles evokes the declin
ing Victorian period in scenes of balls
and sleigh rides that one does not for
get, and his depiction of the private
bickering of a public family is almost
expressionistic. A barely adequate Tim
Holt plays the focal character, young
George Miniver, but the rest of the cast
is extraordinary, especially Agnes
Moorehead as his embittered spinster
aunt, Richard Bennett as his grandfat
her, Dolores Costello as his mother
and Joseph Cotten as the rejected
suitor who loves her all his life. With
music by Bernard Herrmann and for
midable photography by Stanley Cor
tez.

The Lady From Shanghai (1948)
Orson Welles made this insanely
complicated and thoroughly bizarre
murder mystery, adapting his over

written screenplay from a novel by
Sherwood King. He plays the hero, too
— an Irish sailor who hires on to crew
a yacht belonging to a brilliant crimi
nal lawyer (Everett Sloane) and his al
luring wife (Rita Hayworth). Welles
and Hayworth were undergoing
divorce proceedings while the movie
was in production, and that may have
contributed to Welles' depiction of the
Bannisters' marriage in this movie —

as any ever put on the screen. This is a
