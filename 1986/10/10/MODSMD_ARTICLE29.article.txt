Back to the Future (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Robert Zemeckis (director) and Bob
Gale (co-writer) team up again for the first
time since their terrific "Used Cars"
(1980), and though their material here has
less vulgar energy and bite, it still has their
unflagging innovation in setting up gags.
This time-travel fantasy satirically cross
references the consumer cultures of the
1950s and '80s, but it's mostly about the
Oedipal complexities of teen-aged Marty
McFly (Michael J. Fox) going back in time
and meeting his teen-aged parents. Typi
cally for Zemeckis and Gale, the comic
structure is incredibly intricate, with jokes
that set up reverberations throughout the
movie; you have to pay attention to catch
everything. There are some very funny
performances, notably by Fox, Cristopher
Lloyd and Crispin Glover, who does some
undefinably hilarious things as Marty's
dad. With Lea Thompson.
Plays Saturday at 7 and 9:30.

The Trial (1963)
Cubberley Auditorium
Franz Kafka's famous novel was an odd
choice for Orson Welles to film, and his
movie has a number of dreadful mistakes
in it (like an inappropriate jazz score). But
it's fascinating, too: shot against a bleak,
post-T.S. Eliot landscape of concrete apart
ment buildings and rows of lampposts
piercing a foggy gray sky, it's full of visual
coups and scenes that don't quite work
but are intriguing anyway. In the best se
quence, Anthony Perkins runs through
corridors illuminated by bars of light
thrown in through chinks in the wall.
Perkins gives Joseph K. too many nervous
tics, but by the middle of the film, his per
formance begins to make some sense. The
real stars are Welles' camera and Edmond
Richmond's lighting. Welles turns up in
person as the Advocate ( it's not one of his
better performances), as do Jeanne
Moreau, Elsa Martinelli, Romy Schneider
and Akim Tamiroff.
Plays Tuesday at 8 p.m.

Stop Making Sense (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jonathon Demme's film of the Talking
Heads' appearance at the Pantages Theatre
in Hollywood in December '83, with a
brilliant virtuoso performance by the lead
vocalist/songwriter David Byrne. No rock
performer since the young Mick Jagger
can have demonstrated such an over
whelming combination of precisely di
rected energy, razor wit and versatility.
With his mongoose neck and scarecrow
body, his hair slicked back except for a
furtive patch that explodes over one eye,
he looks like a elemented Walker Evans
figure, but everything he does is funny. He

never stops mocking himself; he can be
science-fiction hero and villian, mutant,
devil and evangelist, nerd and obsessive,
and yet remain the crown prince of non
sense, a New Wave Edward Lear. Demme's
direction of the film is not merely a matter
of taste and tact; he constructs the movie
the way Byrne constructed the concert, on
a theatrical/cinematic metaphor that peaks
in the "stop making sense" number,
"Girlfriend is Better," when Byrne thrusts
his mike in front of a techie creeping
around on stage with a lighting instrument
and then points the mike at the camera —
at us. The other members of the band —
Jerry Harrison, Chris Frantz, Tina
Weymouth, Bernie Worrell, Alex Weir,
Steve Scales, Ednah Holt and Lynn Mabry
— each demonstrate a distinctive person
ality. Byrne wrote most of the songs,
which have dry, sneaky word-game lyrics
that bounce off each other like billiard
balls and veer into unanticipated direc
tions. An ecstatic film.
Plays today and tomorrow with Laurie
Anderson's "Home of the Brave."

Bellzalre the Cajun
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Armand Assante gives a dignified and
powerful performance as Belizaire, a
Cajun healer in 19th-century Louisiana
who sees his people being driven off their
land. But apart from Assante, this story of
religious and racial intolerance is slow
and lifeless. Director Glen Pitre made the
movie with the creative and financial assis
tance of Robert Duvall, and Duvall's
deadening, moralizing touch can be felt in
every frame (he makes a cameo appear
ance as a priest at a burial). "Belizaire" is
redeemed, though, by Assante and by the
Cajun music that throbs in the background
throughout the film.

A Room with a View
Camera Three, San Jose
E.M. Forster described his Edwardian
romantic/comic novel as "clear and bright
and well-constructed, but so thin," and
that's a pretty accurate summing up of this
movie version, directed by James Ivory
from an adaptation by Ruth Prawer Jhab
vala. Jhabvala's screenplay is very faithful
to Forster, and preserves much of his
beautifully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger thematic,
more didactic elements of the novel (such
as Forster's sternly humanistic belief in
the supreme sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to inflate the
characters' passions; they keep everything
very light, entertaining and borderline
frivolous, and the movie stays exception
ally neat and well-constructed simply by
following Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and en-

joyable group, with the slight exception of
Helena Bonham Carter, whose Lucy
Honeychurch doesn't seem quite the ves
sel for passion that Forster intended. She's
very likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith, Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm Elliot,
Julian Sands, Simon Callow, Rosemary
Leach, Judi Dench and others.

She's Gotta Have It
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
independent black filmmaker Spike
Lee's $175,000, black-and-white feature
screams out its shoestring budget and its
maker's inexperience and lack of craft at
every moment: It's made in a mock
documentary, flashback style, with charac
ters speaking directly to the camera, that's
completely wrong for the subject matter;
it's full of needless film-school gimmickry
in the editing; and some of the acting is
truly bad. But parts of the movie are
hilarious, including every scene that
features Lee as Mars Blackmon, one of the
three lovers of Nola Darling (Tracy Camila
Johns), a young black woman who lives in
Bed-Stuy and would rather not commit.
"She's Gotta Have It" is basically a black
version of the omnipresent yuppie sex
comedy, set in Brooklyn rather than Man
hattan or Chicago; it's funnier and sexier
than the norm, but the characters are
cardboard; and it doesn't have any more
to say about young love and sexual
freedom than "About Last Night" did. The
movie's real impact lies in Spike Lee's per
sonal style — the way he can plead "Please
baby, please baby, baby, baby please"
while maintaining perfect dignity.

The Year of Living Dangerously
(1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Set in Indonesia in 1965, in the last
gasps of President Sukarno's regime, Peter
Weir's film is richly, vividly enjoyable; it
has a sensuousness that was missing from
his last picture, "Gallipoli," and Linda
Hunt's amazing portrayal of Billy Kwan, a
Chinese-American photographer, gives it
an emotional center. Without her, it
wouldn't have one. Weir has made a
cinematic guess at what a Conrad novel
might be like without philosophy, without
conviction; it's as if he had assimilated all
the old movies he'd ever seen with daring
journalist heroes and seething revolutions
and feverish romances in unlikely settings

and compressed them into one super
deluxe entertainment. What he has added
is his own seductive elusiveness — his
suggestion that there is more inside his
movie than meets the eye, when in fact
there is a great deal less. It's a hell of a
movie, though. Starring Mel Gibson and
Sigourney Weaver; written by Weir, David
Williamson and C. J. Koch; shot by that
wizard, Russell Boyd.
Plays Sunday with "Sylvia."

The Rules of the Game (1939)
Red Vic, San Francisco
"One starts with the environment to
arrive at the self," wrote Jean Renoir. "I
remain a man of the 19th century, and 1
need observation as a point of departure."
Having chronicled the death throes of the
European aristocracy in "Grand Illusion,"
Renoir set this film, made two years later,
among the new aristocracy in France: the
nouveaux riches, for whom love is game
with a fixed set of rules, and to break them
— as the anachronistic, romantic aviator
Jurieu (Roland Toutain) does — is in bad
taste and therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approaching his sub
ject triumphs; "Rules of the Game" is both
a social and a psychological drama, and
one of the three or four greatest movies
ever made. And it's one that was almost
lost to us forever — the original negative
was destroyed by the Nazis and the film
was reassembled from bits and pieces in
the '50s. Renoir worked with Carl Koch on
the screenplay (based loosely on Alfred de
Musset's "Les Caprices de Mariannes");
Claude Renoir shot it; Coco Chanel de
signed the costumes. The superlative cast
includes Marcel Dalio (he played the Jew,
Rosenthal, in "Grand Illusion"), Nora
Gregor, Mila Parely, Odette Talazac.Julien
Carette, Paulette Dubost and Renoir him
self.

movie has a number of dreadful mistakes
in it (like an inappropriate jazz score). But
it's fascinating, too: shot against a bleak,
post-T.S. Eliot landscape of concrete apart
ment buildings and rows of lampposts
piercing a foggy gray sky, it's full of visual
coups and scenes that don't quite work
but are intriguing anyway. In the best se
quence, Anthony Perkins runs through
corridors illuminated by bars of light
thrown in through chinks in the wall.
Perkins gives Joseph K. too many nervous
tics, but by the middle of the film, his per
formance begins to make some sense. The
real stars are Welles' camera and Edmond
Richmond's lighting. Welles turns up in
person as the Advocate ( it's not one of his
better performances), as do Jeanne
Moreau, Elsa Martinelli, Romy Schneider
and Akim Tamiroff.
Plays Tuesday at 8 p.m.

Stop Making Sense (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jonathon Demme's film of the Talking
Heads' appearance at the Pantages Theatre
in Hollywood in December '83, with a
brilliant virtuoso performance by the lead
vocalist/songwriter David Byrne. No rock
performer since the young Mick Jagger
can have demonstrated such an over
whelming combination of precisely di
rected energy, razor wit and versatility.
With his mongoose neck and scarecrow
body, his hair slicked back except for a
furtive patch that explodes over one eye,
he looks like a elemented Walker Evans
figure, but everything he does is funny. He

never stops mocking himself; he can be
science-fiction hero and villian, mutant,
devil and evangelist, nerd and obsessive,
and yet remain the crown prince of non
sense, a New Wave Edward Lear. Demme's
direction of the film is not merely a matter
of taste and tact; he constructs the movie
the way Byrne constructed the concert, on
a theatrical/cinematic metaphor that peaks
in the "stop making sense" number,
"Girlfriend is Better," when Byrne thrusts
his mike in front of a techie creeping
around on stage with a lighting instrument
and then points the mike at the camera —
at us. The other members of the band —
Jerry Harrison, Chris Frantz, Tina
Weymouth, Bernie Worrell, Alex Weir,
Steve Scales, Ednah Holt and Lynn Mabry
— each demonstrate a distinctive person
ality. Byrne wrote most of the songs,
which have dry, sneaky word-game lyrics
that bounce off each other like billiard
balls and veer into unanticipated direc
tions. An ecstatic film.
Plays today and tomorrow with Laurie
Anderson's "Home of the Brave."

Bellzalre the Cajun
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Armand Assante gives a dignified and
powerful performance as Belizaire, a
Cajun healer in 19th-century Louisiana
who sees his people being driven off their
land. But apart from Assante, this story of
religious and racial intolerance is slow
and lifeless. Director Glen Pitre made the
movie with the creative and financial assis
tance of Robert Duvall, and Duvall's
deadening, moralizing touch can be felt in
every frame (he makes a cameo appear
ance as a priest at a burial). "Belizaire" is
redeemed, though, by Assante and by the
Cajun music that throbs in the background
throughout the film.

A Room with a View
Camera Three, San Jose
E.M. Forster described his Edwardian
romantic/comic novel as "clear and bright
and well-constructed, but so thin," and
that's a pretty accurate summing up of this
movie version, directed by James Ivory
from an adaptation by Ruth Prawer Jhab
vala. Jhabvala's screenplay is very faithful
to Forster, and preserves much of his
beautifully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger thematic,
more didactic elements of the novel (such
as Forster's sternly humanistic belief in
the supreme sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to inflate the
characters' passions; they keep everything
very light, entertaining and borderline
frivolous, and the movie stays exception
ally neat and well-constructed simply by
following Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and en-

joyable group, with the slight exception of
Helena Bonham Carter, whose Lucy
Honeychurch doesn't seem quite the ves
sel for passion that Forster intended. She's
very likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith, Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm Elliot,
Julian Sands, Simon Callow, Rosemary
Leach, Judi Dench and others.

She's Gotta Have It
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
independent black filmmaker Spike
Lee's $175,000, black-and-white feature
screams out its shoestring budget and its
maker's inexperience and lack of craft at
every moment: It's made in a mock
documentary, flashback style, with charac
ters speaking directly to the camera, that's
completely wrong for the subject matter;
it's full of needless film-school gimmickry
in the editing; and some of the acting is
truly bad. But parts of the movie are
hilarious, including every scene that
features Lee as Mars Blackmon, one of the
three lovers of Nola Darling (Tracy Camila
Johns), a young black woman who lives in
Bed-Stuy and would rather not commit.
"She's Gotta Have It" is basically a black
version of the omnipresent yuppie sex
comedy, set in Brooklyn rather than Man
hattan or Chicago; it's funnier and sexier
than the norm, but the characters are
cardboard; and it doesn't have any more
to say about young love and sexual
freedom than "About Last Night" did. The
movie's real impact lies in Spike Lee's per
sonal style — the way he can plead "Please
baby, please baby, baby, baby please"
while maintaining perfect dignity.

The Year of Living Dangerously
(1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Set in Indonesia in 1965, in the last
gasps of President Sukarno's regime, Peter
Weir's film is richly, vividly enjoyable; it
has a sensuousness that was missing from
his last picture, "Gallipoli," and Linda
Hunt's amazing portrayal of Billy Kwan, a
Chinese-American photographer, gives it
an emotional center. Without her, it
wouldn't have one. Weir has made a
cinematic guess at what a Conrad novel
might be like without philosophy, without
conviction; it's as if he had assimilated all
the old movies he'd ever seen with daring
journalist heroes and seething revolutions
and feverish romances in unlikely settings

and compressed them into one super
deluxe entertainment. What he has added
is his own seductive elusiveness — his
suggestion that there is more inside his
movie than meets the eye, when in fact
there is a great deal less. It's a hell of a
movie, though. Starring Mel Gibson and
Sigourney Weaver; written by Weir, David
Williamson and C. J. Koch; shot by that
wizard, Russell Boyd.
Plays Sunday with "Sylvia."

The Rules of the Game (1939)
Red Vic, San Francisco
"One starts with the environment to
arrive at the self," wrote Jean Renoir. "I
remain a man of the 19th century, and 1
need observation as a point of departure."
Having chronicled the death throes of the
European aristocracy in "Grand Illusion,"
Renoir set this film, made two years later,
among the new aristocracy in France: the
nouveaux riches, for whom love is game
with a fixed set of rules, and to break them
— as the anachronistic, romantic aviator
Jurieu (Roland Toutain) does — is in bad
taste and therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approaching his sub
ject triumphs; "Rules of the Game" is both
a social and a psychological drama, and
one of the three or four greatest movies
ever made. And it's one that was almost
lost to us forever — the original negative
was destroyed by the Nazis and the film
was reassembled from bits and pieces in
the '50s. Renoir worked with Carl Koch on
the screenplay (based loosely on Alfred de
Musset's "Les Caprices de Mariannes");
Claude Renoir shot it; Coco Chanel de
signed the costumes. The superlative cast
includes Marcel Dalio (he played the Jew,
Rosenthal, in "Grand Illusion"), Nora
Gregor, Mila Parely, Odette Talazac.Julien
Carette, Paulette Dubost and Renoir him
self.

Back to the Future (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Robert Zemeckis (director) and Bob
Gale (co-writer) team up again for the first
time since their terrific "Used Cars"
(1980), and though their material here has
less vulgar energy and bite, it still has their
unflagging innovation in setting up gags.
This time-travel fantasy satirically cross
references the consumer cultures of the
1950s and '80s, but it's mostly about the
Oedipal complexities of teen-aged Marty
McFly (Michael J. Fox) going back in time
and meeting his teen-aged parents. Typi
cally for Zemeckis and Gale, the comic
structure is incredibly intricate, with jokes
that set up reverberations throughout the
movie; you have to pay attention to catch
everything. There are some very funny
performances, notably by Fox, Cristopher
Lloyd and Crispin Glover, who does some
undefinably hilarious things as Marty's
dad. With Lea Thompson.
Plays Saturday at 7 and 9:30.

never stops mocking himself; he can be
science-fiction hero and villian, mutant,
devil and evangelist, nerd and obsessive,
and yet remain the crown prince of non
sense, a New Wave Edward Lear. Demme's
direction of the film is not merely a matter
of taste and tact; he constructs the movie
the way Byrne constructed the concert, on
a theatrical/cinematic metaphor that peaks
in the "stop making sense" number,
"Girlfriend is Better," when Byrne thrusts
his mike in front of a techie creeping
around on stage with a lighting instrument
and then points the mike at the camera —
at us. The other members of the band —
Jerry Harrison, Chris Frantz, Tina
Weymouth, Bernie Worrell, Alex Weir,
Steve Scales, Ednah Holt and Lynn Mabry
— each demonstrate a distinctive person
ality. Byrne wrote most of the songs,
which have dry, sneaky word-game lyrics
that bounce off each other like billiard
balls and veer into unanticipated direc
tions. An ecstatic film.
Plays today and tomorrow with Laurie
Anderson's "Home of the Brave."

Bellzalre the Cajun
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Armand Assante gives a dignified and
powerful performance as Belizaire, a
Cajun healer in 19th-century Louisiana
who sees his people being driven off their
land. But apart from Assante, this story of
religious and racial intolerance is slow
and lifeless. Director Glen Pitre made the
movie with the creative and financial assis
tance of Robert Duvall, and Duvall's
deadening, moralizing touch can be felt in
every frame (he makes a cameo appear
ance as a priest at a burial). "Belizaire" is
redeemed, though, by Assante and by the
Cajun music that throbs in the background
throughout the film.

A Room with a View
Camera Three, San Jose
E.M. Forster described his Edwardian
romantic/comic novel as "clear and bright
and well-constructed, but so thin," and
that's a pretty accurate summing up of this
movie version, directed by James Ivory
from an adaptation by Ruth Prawer Jhab
vala. Jhabvala's screenplay is very faithful
to Forster, and preserves much of his
beautifully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger thematic,
more didactic elements of the novel (such
as Forster's sternly humanistic belief in
the supreme sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to inflate the
characters' passions; they keep everything
very light, entertaining and borderline
frivolous, and the movie stays exception
ally neat and well-constructed simply by
following Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and en-

joyable group, with the slight exception of
Helena Bonham Carter, whose Lucy
Honeychurch doesn't seem quite the ves
sel for passion that Forster intended. She's
very likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith, Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm Elliot,
Julian Sands, Simon Callow, Rosemary
Leach, Judi Dench and others.

She's Gotta Have It
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
independent black filmmaker Spike
Lee's $175,000, black-and-white feature
screams out its shoestring budget and its
maker's inexperience and lack of craft at
every moment: It's made in a mock
documentary, flashback style, with charac
ters speaking directly to the camera, that's
completely wrong for the subject matter;
it's full of needless film-school gimmickry
in the editing; and some of the acting is
truly bad. But parts of the movie are
hilarious, including every scene that
features Lee as Mars Blackmon, one of the
three lovers of Nola Darling (Tracy Camila
Johns), a young black woman who lives in
Bed-Stuy and would rather not commit.
"She's Gotta Have It" is basically a black
version of the omnipresent yuppie sex
comedy, set in Brooklyn rather than Man
hattan or Chicago; it's funnier and sexier
than the norm, but the characters are
cardboard; and it doesn't have any more
to say about young love and sexual
freedom than "About Last Night" did. The
movie's real impact lies in Spike Lee's per
sonal style — the way he can plead "Please
baby, please baby, baby, baby please"
while maintaining perfect dignity.

The Year of Living Dangerously
(1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Set in Indonesia in 1965, in the last
gasps of President Sukarno's regime, Peter
Weir's film is richly, vividly enjoyable; it
has a sensuousness that was missing from
his last picture, "Gallipoli," and Linda
Hunt's amazing portrayal of Billy Kwan, a
Chinese-American photographer, gives it
an emotional center. Without her, it
wouldn't have one. Weir has made a
cinematic guess at what a Conrad novel
might be like without philosophy, without
conviction; it's as if he had assimilated all
the old movies he'd ever seen with daring
journalist heroes and seething revolutions
and feverish romances in unlikely settings

and compressed them into one super
deluxe entertainment. What he has added
is his own seductive elusiveness — his
suggestion that there is more inside his
movie than meets the eye, when in fact
there is a great deal less. It's a hell of a
movie, though. Starring Mel Gibson and
Sigourney Weaver; written by Weir, David
Williamson and C. J. Koch; shot by that
wizard, Russell Boyd.
Plays Sunday with "Sylvia."

The Rules of the Game (1939)
Red Vic, San Francisco
"One starts with the environment to
arrive at the self," wrote Jean Renoir. "I
remain a man of the 19th century, and 1
need observation as a point of departure."
Having chronicled the death throes of the
European aristocracy in "Grand Illusion,"
Renoir set this film, made two years later,
among the new aristocracy in France: the
nouveaux riches, for whom love is game
with a fixed set of rules, and to break them
— as the anachronistic, romantic aviator
Jurieu (Roland Toutain) does — is in bad
taste and therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approaching his sub
ject triumphs; "Rules of the Game" is both
a social and a psychological drama, and
one of the three or four greatest movies
ever made. And it's one that was almost
lost to us forever — the original negative
was destroyed by the Nazis and the film
was reassembled from bits and pieces in
the '50s. Renoir worked with Carl Koch on
the screenplay (based loosely on Alfred de
Musset's "Les Caprices de Mariannes");
Claude Renoir shot it; Coco Chanel de
signed the costumes. The superlative cast
includes Marcel Dalio (he played the Jew,
Rosenthal, in "Grand Illusion"), Nora
Gregor, Mila Parely, Odette Talazac.Julien
Carette, Paulette Dubost and Renoir him
self.

Back to the Future (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Robert Zemeckis (director) and Bob
Gale (co-writer) team up again for the first
time since their terrific "Used Cars"
(1980), and though their material here has
less vulgar energy and bite, it still has their
unflagging innovation in setting up gags.
This time-travel fantasy satirically cross
references the consumer cultures of the
1950s and '80s, but it's mostly about the
Oedipal complexities of teen-aged Marty
McFly (Michael J. Fox) going back in time
and meeting his teen-aged parents. Typi
cally for Zemeckis and Gale, the comic
structure is incredibly intricate, with jokes
that set up reverberations throughout the
movie; you have to pay attention to catch
everything. There are some very funny
performances, notably by Fox, Cristopher
Lloyd and Crispin Glover, who does some
undefinably hilarious things as Marty's
dad. With Lea Thompson.
Plays Saturday at 7 and 9:30.

The Trial (1963)
Cubberley Auditorium
Franz Kafka's famous novel was an odd
choice for Orson Welles to film, and his
movie has a number of dreadful mistakes
in it (like an inappropriate jazz score). But
it's fascinating, too: shot against a bleak,
post-T.S. Eliot landscape of concrete apart
ment buildings and rows of lampposts
piercing a foggy gray sky, it's full of visual
coups and scenes that don't quite work
but are intriguing anyway. In the best se
quence, Anthony Perkins runs through
corridors illuminated by bars of light
thrown in through chinks in the wall.
Perkins gives Joseph K. too many nervous
tics, but by the middle of the film, his per
formance begins to make some sense. The
real stars are Welles' camera and Edmond
Richmond's lighting. Welles turns up in
person as the Advocate ( it's not one of his
better performances), as do Jeanne
Moreau, Elsa Martinelli, Romy Schneider
and Akim Tamiroff.
Plays Tuesday at 8 p.m.

Stop Making Sense (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jonathon Demme's film of the Talking
Heads' appearance at the Pantages Theatre
in Hollywood in December '83, with a
brilliant virtuoso performance by the lead
vocalist/songwriter David Byrne. No rock
performer since the young Mick Jagger
can have demonstrated such an over
whelming combination of precisely di
rected energy, razor wit and versatility.
With his mongoose neck and scarecrow
body, his hair slicked back except for a
furtive patch that explodes over one eye,
he looks like a elemented Walker Evans
figure, but everything he does is funny. He

never stops mocking himself; he can be
science-fiction hero and villian, mutant,
devil and evangelist, nerd and obsessive,
and yet remain the crown prince of non
sense, a New Wave Edward Lear. Demme's
direction of the film is not merely a matter
of taste and tact; he constructs the movie
