# Shamrock denies firm date of sale

### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Diamond Shamrock Corp., the Texas company
from which Stanford is divesting, yesterday denied a
report that it will definitely be out of South Africa by
Dec. 1.
Stanford decided to divest Monday after Diamond
Shamrock missed an Oct. 1 deadline for selling its
operation outside Cape Town, South Africa. The
Board of Trustees in May had voted to divest if the
operation was not sold by Oct. 1.
"That (Dec. 1) is what we're estimating,... but it's
not as if anything is going to expire or run out," said
Paul Vitale, associate director of investor relations for
Diamond Shamrock.
Vitale contradicted Stanford Treasurer Rodney
Adams who said Tuesday that Diamond Shamrock
had made Dec. 1 a firm date for their withdrawal.
Adams had said Diamond Shamrock set that

date after learning of Stanford's decision to divest,
and he said the corporation's decision indicated the
effectiveness of Stanford's selective divestment
policy.
Adams was out of town yesterday and was,
therefore, unavailable for comment.
Diamond Shamrock is selling its Simonstown,
South Africa, plant as part of a general withdrawal
from the chemical business, and Vitale said that Stan
ford's divestment would not have a major effect on
the company.
"I really think that what's going to happen is we're
going to have this thing sold by Decemlier, and when
the South African thing is sold, Stanford's going to
think of buying the stock back," Vitale said.
Last spring, Diamond Shamrock told the University
that it would be out of South Africa by Sept. 30. But
when Occidental Petroleum bought the chemicals di
vision this summer, it did not want the South African
plant, Vitale said. Diamond Shamrock sold the plant

to a South African chemical company in September,
but legal and financial fine points surrounding the
sale have delayed Diamond Shamrock's withdrawal
from the country.
Diamond Shamrock's South Africa plant, which
produces chemicals for textiles, paints and paper
products, has nine full-time employees, including six
coloreds.
Diamond Shamrock reported assets of $3.1 billion
in its 1985 annual report. The South African opera
tion, valued at $125,000, represents about .004 per
cent of the company's total assets.
The decision to divest was made Monday morning
at University President Donald Kennedy's weekly
meeting with top Stanford Administrators, Adams
said Tuesday.
Adams said Kennedy made the decision after con
sulting with Trustee James Gaither, chairman of the
Board of Turustees' Special committee on Invest
ment Responsibility.
