## Undefeated Stanford takes on Huskies Top 20 showdown televised nationally 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Under the lights at Stanford Stadium
tomorrow evening, 18th-ranked Stan
ford will put its perfect 4-0 record on
the line against 12th ranked Washing
ton in the biggest game for the Card
inal in the last four seasons.
The last time the Huskies faced a
Cardinal squad with bowl-game aspira
tions was in 1982. Washington was No.
1 at the time with a 7-0 record, but
quarterback John Elway went 20-of-30
for 265 yards and two touchdowns to
spark a 43-31 Cardinal upset.
That was also the last time the Card
inal has defeated Washington, which
has won every other meeting between
the teams since 1977.
Hut the Cardinal has won its first
four games for the first time since
1952 and has earned the No. 18
ranking in the Associated Press poll.
The last time the Cardinal was nation
ally ranked was 1982. And tomorrow's
game is the only one in the nation be
tween ranked teams. Starting time has
been moved back to 4 p.m. to allow
cable station WTBS to televise the
game nationally.
Those four victories have largely
come behind the play of a defense that
is allowing only 11.8 points per game,
the best in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Against the Huskies last year, the Card
inal suffered a 34-0 defeat in Seattle.
But this year is different.
"They're really well-drilled,'' Wash
ington Coach Don James said, "and
you can see the difference on defense
— they're not out of position and
giving up the big play."
That defense will have six large
problems and one fast problem tomor
row. The large problems are 240-
pound fullback Rick Fenney, who has
rushed for 265 yards this season, and
an offensive line that weighs 295, 264,

272, 296 and 300 pounds across. The
fast problem is wide receiver Lonzell
Hill, who is averaging 18.9 yards per
catch on 14 receptions.
"We have to slow down the running
game," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said,
"and make them pass when they have
to, rather than want to. They have good
balance. Hill's a great receiver, and
they've got a giant offensive line. We've
got to execute, play emotionally and
disciplined, and play every down."
The Cardinal defense will also be
missing comerback Toi Cook, out for
six to 10 weeks with a fractured wrist
suffered last weekend. Sophomore Pat
Kelly inherits Cook's position, and El
way said nothing will change in the
coverage scheme with Cook out.
"We've got a whole lot of confidence
in Pat," he said. "He's confident in the
defensive scheme. We're happy to have
a backup of his quality starting against
Washington."
On the offensive side, the Cardinal is
fortunate to have wide receiver Jeff
James all but certain to start tomorrow.
James caught 18 passes in his first two
starts to lead the nation, but a sprained
heel suffered against San Jose State
kept him out of the last two games. The
Cardinal went from averaging almost
30 points a game with James to 17
points in each game without him.
"Obviously, we miss Jeff James in
our passing combination," Elway said.
"There's a real electricity between Jeff
and John Paye."
The Cardinal running game is also
looking up. Running back Brad Muster
topped 100 yards for the first time last
week, picking up 115 yards on 21
carries to give him 316 on the year.
Tackle John Zentner is also expected
to return to action after missing last
week with a groin pull, but a pinched
nerve in his neck will likely keep tackle
Jeff Marchin out again. Kurt Josephson,
who played well in his first game ever

at tackle last week, will fill in again.
The Huskies, though, are seventh in
the nation and first in the conference
in rushing defense, allowing only 74.5
yards per game. 'Their defense stands
up to any in the country," Elway said.
"If they played anyone in the country, I
wouldn't bet against them.
"We have to lie prepared and be up.
I know this team will be up. Hopefully,

they'll take us for granted," he said.
James, whose 3-1 team suffered its
only loss two weeks ago in a confer
ence game at USC, saw an incentive for
his squad. "If you don't have a league
loss or tie, you have a cushion," he said
of the race for the Rose Bowl. "You can
lose one. I don't think you can lose
two."
Around 7 tomorrow evening, the

Cardinal will find out what kind of cus
hion its Rose Bowl hopes enjoy.
Card notes
A crowd of only 43,000 is expected for to
morrow's game. Tickets are available from
the Ticket Office today and at the stadium
tomorrow. Student tickets are $5.
Washington quarterback Chris
Chandler is completing 57 percent of his

passes and averaging 180 yards per game.
Husky kicker Jeff Jaeger is the No. 5 field
goal kicker in NCAA history. Jaeger's 72
three-pointers are seven shy of the NCAA
record, and he has converted 82 percent of
his attempts. With 306 career points, he is
62 off the NCAA mark.
The Husky offensive line averages 285
pounds. The Stanford defensive line
averages 247 pounds. The Cardinal front
seven averages 238 pounds.

an offensive line that weighs 295, 264,

272, 296 and 300 pounds across. The
fast problem is wide receiver Lonzell
Hill, who is averaging 18.9 yards per
catch on 14 receptions.
"We have to slow down the running
game," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said,
"and make them pass when they have
to, rather than want to. They have good
balance. Hill's a great receiver, and
they've got a giant offensive line. We've
got to execute, play emotionally and
disciplined, and play every down."
The Cardinal defense will also be
missing comerback Toi Cook, out for
six to 10 weeks with a fractured wrist
suffered last weekend. Sophomore Pat
Kelly inherits Cook's position, and El
way said nothing will change in the
coverage scheme with Cook out.
"We've got a whole lot of confidence
in Pat," he said. "He's confident in the
defensive scheme. We're happy to have
a backup of his quality starting against
Washington."
On the offensive side, the Cardinal is
fortunate to have wide receiver Jeff
James all but certain to start tomorrow.
James caught 18 passes in his first two
starts to lead the nation, but a sprained
heel suffered against San Jose State
kept him out of the last two games. The
Cardinal went from averaging almost
30 points a game with James to 17
points in each game without him.
"Obviously, we miss Jeff James in
our passing combination," Elway said.
"There's a real electricity between Jeff
and John Paye."
The Cardinal running game is also
looking up. Running back Brad Muster
topped 100 yards for the first time last
week, picking up 115 yards on 21
carries to give him 316 on the year.
Tackle John Zentner is also expected
to return to action after missing last
week with a groin pull, but a pinched
nerve in his neck will likely keep tackle
Jeff Marchin out again. Kurt Josephson,
who played well in his first game ever

at tackle last week, will fill in again.
The Huskies, though, are seventh in
the nation and first in the conference
in rushing defense, allowing only 74.5
yards per game. 'Their defense stands
up to any in the country," Elway said.
"If they played anyone in the country, I
wouldn't bet against them.
"We have to lie prepared and be up.
I know this team will be up. Hopefully,

they'll take us for granted," he said.
James, whose 3-1 team suffered its
only loss two weeks ago in a confer
ence game at USC, saw an incentive for
his squad. "If you don't have a league
loss or tie, you have a cushion," he said
of the race for the Rose Bowl. "You can
lose one. I don't think you can lose
two."
Around 7 tomorrow evening, the

Cardinal will find out what kind of cus
hion its Rose Bowl hopes enjoy.

this weekend. Stanford has not beaten the Huskies since 1982, and a
Rose Bowl bid could be on the line.
Under the lights at Stanford Stadium
tomorrow evening, 18th-ranked Stan
ford will put its perfect 4-0 record on
the line against 12th ranked Washing
ton in the biggest game for the Card
inal in the last four seasons.
The last time the Huskies faced a
Cardinal squad with bowl-game aspira
tions was in 1982. Washington was No.
1 at the time with a 7-0 record, but
quarterback John Elway went 20-of-30
for 265 yards and two touchdowns to
spark a 43-31 Cardinal upset.
That was also the last time the Card
inal has defeated Washington, which
has won every other meeting between
the teams since 1977.
Hut the Cardinal has won its first
four games for the first time since
1952 and has earned the No. 18
ranking in the Associated Press poll.
The last time the Cardinal was nation
ally ranked was 1982. And tomorrow's
game is the only one in the nation be
tween ranked teams. Starting time has
been moved back to 4 p.m. to allow
cable station WTBS to televise the
game nationally.
Those four victories have largely
come behind the play of a defense that
is allowing only 11.8 points per game,
the best in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Against the Huskies last year, the Card
inal suffered a 34-0 defeat in Seattle.
But this year is different.
"They're really well-drilled,'' Wash
ington Coach Don James said, "and
you can see the difference on defense
— they're not out of position and
giving up the big play."
That defense will have six large
problems and one fast problem tomor
row. The large problems are 240-
pound fullback Rick Fenney, who has
rushed for 265 yards this season, and
an offensive line that weighs 295, 264,

272, 296 and 300 pounds across. The
fast problem is wide receiver Lonzell
Hill, who is averaging 18.9 yards per
catch on 14 receptions.
