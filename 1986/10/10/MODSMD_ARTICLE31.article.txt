# Women's soccer meets N. Colo.
## 
### ED STACKLER 
How long can a good thing last? That
is the question for the Stanford
women's soccer team today as they
face yet another tough visiting soccer
team.
The Grizzlies of Northern Colorado
are rumored to be a very talented
team. Tuesday, their hot streak ended
in a game against Colorado College,
but that loss leaves their record at an
unbelievable six wins and only one
loss.
"They're going to be tough,"
Stanford Coach Helen Keohane said
of the Grizzlies. "They have no real in
dividual stars, but defensively they give
you no time." Defense seems to be the
key to staying ahead of the Grizzlies.
Lately, the Cardinal defense has
been remarkably effective. Vija Brook
shire, the starting goalkeeper, has
allowed only 1.35 goals per game this
season. Tenacious play by fullbacks
Hilary Turner, Chris Scott and
freshman Christine Martin has also
kept opponents' scoring to a mini
mum.
If the Stanford defense does play

well, it is likely that the Cardinal of
fense can put points on the board.
Like Northern Colorado, Stanford's
offensive talent is well distributed.
Three women are tied for leading
scorer this season, each with two goals:
Amy Geisse, Tonya Antonucci and
Stacey Keare. At least four other
women in the midfield and forefield
have also shown definite scoring po
tential.
Teamwork and one-touch passing
will be crucial components of the
Cardinal offense if the Grizzlies are to
be beaten."But," Keohane said,"a few
individual performances would help."
The Cardinal will be trying to "take
the ball to the corners and serve it to
the middle rather than going staight up
the middle," said Wednesday's high
scorer Stacey Keare.
Cardinal morale and confidence is
high going into this soccer match. The
team has played well in its three most
recent games, beating Rhode Island 2-
1, University of San Francisco 3-0 and
holding Sonoma State to a 1-1 tie.
The squads will face each other on
Maloney Field at 3 p.m.
