# Stanford takes on Bears at DeGuerre
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
There they go again.
After downing California three times
already this season, the top-rated Stan
ford men's water polo team will take
on No. 2 Cal today for the fourth time
this year. The match is the Pacific-10
Conference opener for both teams and
will begin at 3 p.m at DeGuerre P(X)1.
In addition, the Cardinal will play
against a Stanford alumni team tomor
row at 11 a.m. at DeGuerre.
Today's match against Cal may well
determine whether the 19-0 Cardinal
can be beaten at all this year or
whether it will run away from the pack
altogether.
After returning nine of its top 11
scorers from last year's NCAA cham
pion team, the Cardinal has
solidified its starting lineup during the
course of this season and has played
near-flawless team water polo. Stan
ford has dominated every opponent
this season, winning 28 straight
matches dating back to last year. Only
three teams have come as close as
three goals to beating the Cardinal.
Senior Craig Klass and junior Erich
Fischer lead the way for the Cardinal,
both having scored 46 goals on the
season. Seniors David Imbernino (32
goals), Greg Ocasek (19 goals) and
Greg Gamble (16 goals) and junior
Matt Tingler (17 goals) combine to
make Stanford a threat to score from

any position in the water.
Sophomore goalie Todd Kemp and
junior goalie Obi Greenman have led
the stingy Cardinal defense, allowing
an average of only five goals per game.
If any team can upend Stanford,
however, the most likelv team is 16-4
Cal.
"Everything has to improve (from
Cal's latest loss to Stanford) for us to
win," California Coach Pete Cutino
said. "All our departments have to be
on, particularly our goal output. This is
a much better Stanford team than last
year."
Cutlno's Bears have improved
against the Cardinal each time they
have played them this year. Like the
mark of many a good team, Cal plays at
its best against worthy opponents such
as Stanford. Last Saturday in the North
ern California Water Polo Tournament
at DeGuerre, the Bears scored five
goals in the fourth period to bring the
score to its final 9-7 margin.
"Even time we play against them."
Greenman said. "They get a little better
against us."
Pride is on the line for Gil today. No
good team likes to lose, and Cal has
been manhandled by the Cardinal not
just once but three times. Maybe the
Bears can turn up its performance a
notch and catch the Stanford team nap
ping.
