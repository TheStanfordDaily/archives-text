# Volleyball victorious over ISU

### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
The easy part is over; now
comes the hard part.
The Cardinal women's volley
ball team easily defeated Illinois
State last night in its First-round
match of the Josten's Invita
tional. Tonight it will take on No.
3 San Jose State in the champi
onship match at 8 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
The Spartans had a fairly easy
time of it themselves, winning
over 15th-ranked Colorado
State, 15-4, 13-15, 15-7, 15-7. ISU
and CSU will play for third place
in the tournament at 6 p.m.
Stanford faltered only once,
and very slightly, in its 15-5,15-3,
15-9 victory over an injury
riddled, and therefore inexperi
enced, Redbirds squad. The
Cardinal letdown came midway
through the third game, when its
errors and Illinois State's lone
offensive streak of the match
allowed the unranked visitors to
pull even at seven.
Before ISU could pull ahead,
though, Stanford had them on
the ropes 14-7 and then had the
match a couple side outs and
services later. While the 12th
ranked, now 9-5, Cardinal knew
it couldn't be too sure of itself
going into the match, it did
know that even a less-than
satisfactory performance would
probably result in a win.
Except for the third game
lapse, the spikers played as if
they were going against the na
tion's top team, and the outcome
of the match was never really in
doubt for the team or the sparse
crowd.
"It went pretty much like we
expected it to," junior middle
blocker Nancy Reno said.
Offensively, Reno led the
Cardinal with nine kills, hitting
at an awesome .643 success rate.
By contrast, ISU's kill leader,
Chris Rehor with eight, had only
a .133 hitting percentage.
Theresa Smith had eight kills
and devastated the Redbirds
with her jump serve, which was
stopped only by her own errors.
Naturally, Wendi Rush did most
of the setting, piling up 2 7 assists
in 46 attempts.
For the night, Smith had an al
most unthinkable 10 aces, a
Stanford record Sophomore
