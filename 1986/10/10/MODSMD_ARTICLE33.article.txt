# Volleyball victorious over ISU
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
The easy part is over; now
comes the hard part.
The Cardinal women's volley
ball team easily defeated Illinois
State last night in its First-round
match of the Josten's Invita
tional. Tonight it will take on No.
3 San Jose State in the champi
onship match at 8 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
The Spartans had a fairly easy
time of it themselves, winning
over 15th-ranked Colorado
State, 15-4, 13-15, 15-7, 15-7. ISU
and CSU will play for third place
in the tournament at 6 p.m.
Stanford faltered only once,
and very slightly, in its 15-5,15-3,
15-9 victory over an injury
riddled, and therefore inexperi
enced, Redbirds squad. The
Cardinal letdown came midway
through the third game, when its
errors and Illinois State's lone
offensive streak of the match
allowed the unranked visitors to
pull even at seven.
Before ISU could pull ahead,
though, Stanford had them on
the ropes 14-7 and then had the
match a couple side outs and
services later. While the 12th
ranked, now 9-5, Cardinal knew
it couldn't be too sure of itself
going into the match, it did
know that even a less-than
satisfactory performance would
probably result in a win.
Except for the third game
lapse, the spikers played as if
they were going against the na
tion's top team, and the outcome
of the match was never really in
doubt for the team or the sparse
crowd.
"It went pretty much like we
expected it to," junior middle
blocker Nancy Reno said.
Offensively, Reno led the
Cardinal with nine kills, hitting
at an awesome .643 success rate.
By contrast, ISU's kill leader,
Chris Rehor with eight, had only
a .133 hitting percentage.
Theresa Smith had eight kills
and devastated the Redbirds
with her jump serve, which was
stopped only by her own errors.
Naturally, Wendi Rush did most
of the setting, piling up 2 7 assists
in 46 attempts.
For the night, Smith had an al
most unthinkable 10 aces, a
Stanford record Sophomore
Amy Hayes served the most aces for
the Cardinal last season, compiling 45
in over 30 matches.
In last night's second game, SJSU
showed flashes of both invincibility
and serious vulnerability in improving
its record to 13-1 Lisa Ice led the
flashes of invincibility with lefthanded
kills barely visible to the human eye
and should give Cardinal blockers a lot
tougher match than they had yesterday.
After the match, SJSU Coach
Dr. Richard Montgomery expressed
concern over his team's lack of consis
tency.
"We're a little in and out, a little bit
spotty right now," Montgomery said.
"A really good team doesn't play
streaky."
Montgomery said SJSU's slight
troubles may have been due to the
team's looking past Colorado State
towards tonight's championship, but
thinks they more likely can be attrib
uted to the tough schedule his team
has been on recently.
"We're a good team; we know we're
a good team," Montgomery said, "but
we've been playing a lot of matches
recently, and it's hard to keep going.
It's a lot of day in, day out kind of stuff.
"I like to think we're mature enough
and strong enough to avoid the let
downs," Montgomery added, "but,
heck, I guess that's human nature."
While Montgomery did not think the

Spartans uncharacteristically high
ranking and Stanford's relatively low
ranking would have an effect on
tonight's standoff, Stanford Coach Don
Shaw and senior hitter Barbra Fontana
disagreed.
"They haven't always been up
there," Shaw said. "This is the first year
they've had to deal with the pressure "
"They're in a tougher position than

us," Fontana said. "Either way, we're
OK (win or lose). They're coming out
not to lose; we're coming out to win."
A loss tonight would not kill Stan
ford's season, but according to Reno, a
win would do a great deal for keeping
the Cardinal's recent hot streak alive.
"It's a really important point in our
season," Reno said. "Beating ASU last
weekend was a really pivotal moment."

flashes of invincibility with lefthanded
kills barely visible to the human eye
and should give Cardinal blockers a lot
tougher match than they had yesterday.
After the match, SJSU Coach
Dr. Richard Montgomery expressed
concern over his team's lack of consis
tency.
"We're a little in and out, a little bit
spotty right now," Montgomery said.
"A really good team doesn't play
streaky."
Montgomery said SJSU's slight
troubles may have been due to the
team's looking past Colorado State
towards tonight's championship, but
thinks they more likely can be attrib
uted to the tough schedule his team
has been on recently.
"We're a good team; we know we're
a good team," Montgomery said, "but
we've been playing a lot of matches
recently, and it's hard to keep going.
It's a lot of day in, day out kind of stuff.
"I like to think we're mature enough
and strong enough to avoid the let
downs," Montgomery added, "but,
heck, I guess that's human nature."
While Montgomery did not think the

Spartans uncharacteristically high
ranking and Stanford's relatively low
ranking would have an effect on
tonight's standoff, Stanford Coach Don
Shaw and senior hitter Barbra Fontana
disagreed.
"They haven't always been up
there," Shaw said. "This is the first year
they've had to deal with the pressure "
"They're in a tougher position than

us," Fontana said. "Either way, we're
OK (win or lose). They're coming out
not to lose; we're coming out to win."
A loss tonight would not kill Stan
ford's season, but according to Reno, a
win would do a great deal for keeping
the Cardinal's recent hot streak alive.
"It's a really important point in our
season," Reno said. "Beating ASU last
weekend was a really pivotal moment."

It was a quick win for Barbra Fontana (digging bail) and the Stanford
women's volleyball team last night The Cardinal beat Illinois State
easily in three games as Theresa Smith (not pictured) recorded a team
record 10 aces.
The easy part is over; now
comes the hard part.
The Cardinal women's volley
ball team easily defeated Illinois
State last night in its First-round
match of the Josten's Invita
tional. Tonight it will take on No.
3 San Jose State in the champi
onship match at 8 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
The Spartans had a fairly easy
time of it themselves, winning
over 15th-ranked Colorado
State, 15-4, 13-15, 15-7, 15-7. ISU
and CSU will play for third place
in the tournament at 6 p.m.
Stanford faltered only once,
and very slightly, in its 15-5,15-3,
15-9 victory over an injury
riddled, and therefore inexperi
enced, Redbirds squad. The
Cardinal letdown came midway
through the third game, when its
errors and Illinois State's lone
offensive streak of the match
allowed the unranked visitors to
pull even at seven.
Before ISU could pull ahead,
though, Stanford had them on
the ropes 14-7 and then had the
match a couple side outs and
services later. While the 12th
ranked, now 9-5, Cardinal knew
it couldn't be too sure of itself
going into the match, it did
know that even a less-than
satisfactory performance would
probably result in a win.
Except for the third game
lapse, the spikers played as if
they were going against the na
tion's top team, and the outcome
of the match was never really in
doubt for the team or the sparse
crowd.
"It went pretty much like we
expected it to," junior middle
blocker Nancy Reno said.
Offensively, Reno led the
Cardinal with nine kills, hitting
at an awesome .643 success rate.
By contrast, ISU's kill leader,
Chris Rehor with eight, had only
a .133 hitting percentage.
Theresa Smith had eight kills
and devastated the Redbirds
with her jump serve, which was
stopped only by her own errors.
Naturally, Wendi Rush did most
of the setting, piling up 2 7 assists
in 46 attempts.
For the night, Smith had an al
most unthinkable 10 aces, a
Stanford record Sophomore
Amy Hayes served the most aces for
the Cardinal last season, compiling 45
in over 30 matches.
In last night's second game, SJSU
showed flashes of both invincibility
and serious vulnerability in improving
its record to 13-1 Lisa Ice led the
flashes of invincibility with lefthanded
kills barely visible to the human eye
