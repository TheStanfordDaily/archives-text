# Card field hockey travels to last-place Chico State
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
After facing two of the top three teams in the Northern
Pacific Conference in its past two games, the Stanford field
hockey team would seem to have a breather tomorrow
against NorPac cellar-dweller Chico State.
However, a breather — a long one — is just what Stan
ford might need after it plays in Chico. The recent warm
weather could mean that the temperature will reach the 90s
for the 2 p.m. contest.
According to Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson, the Cardinal
can expect a physically demanding game from the Wildcats.
"They're a hard-hitting team," she said. "They run a lot. It's
hot up there, and they're usually in good shape."
But so far this year, the Wildcats' offense definitely has not
been in good shape, having scored only two goals in three
games. Only Colleen Watts and Sue Schmidt have been able
to find the net for Chice State.
Still, the Wildcats will enjoy the home-field advantage.
Being at home in field hockey might not be as crucial as it is
in other sports, but Johnson believes that it will give Chico
State an edge, not only because of the heat. "They have a

good support group up there for field hockey, and they
should really turn out.''
Another factor in the Wildcats' favor is that the Cardinal at
tack has also had its problems. Stanford has tallied only
seven goals in its eight games. The leading scorers have
been Laura Gartland and Andi Wolpert, each with two goals.
Johnson has been encouraged, however, by the
midfielders' ability to get off more shots, giving the forwards
scoring opportunities on rebounds.
The defense was also impressive in its last outing, a 1-0
win over UOP last Saturday. Stanford had given up three
goals while losing to San Jose State the previous Wednesday,
but the Cardinal was able to stifle the Tigers.
"In the San Jose State game, we were a little slow. We
were still on eastern time (Stanford had just finished a four
game road trip through New England)," Johnson said. As a
unit, we were much stronger against UOP."
San Jose State (2-2 in the conference, 3-4 overall), Califor
nia (1-0-2, 3-2-2) and UOP lead the NorPac with four points
each. Stanford (1-1-1, 3-4-1) is fourth with three, and Chico
State (0-2-1, 0-2-1) is in last place with one point.
