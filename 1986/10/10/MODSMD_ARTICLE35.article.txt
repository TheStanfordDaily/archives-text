# Greeks sneak peek into this football week
## Card skipper Mark Marquess joins ranks of prognosticators 
### 
A rookie was the big winner and the
guest was the big loser in the first week
of the Daily's Greek of the Week prog
nostications.
Cardinal Today Editor Erik Sten was
the only one of the Daily's six resident
Greeks to correctly forecast San Jose
State's heart-stopping upset of Fresno
State last Saturday. With that daring
pick, Sten took the early lead in the
race for the case of Henry Weinhard's
Private Reserve with a 7-3 record.
Meanwhile, former Daily Sports
Editor Pete Haven returned from the
abyss of graduation to turn in a dismal
4-6 mark. Haven missed all five non-
Pacific 10 Conference picks.
Sports writer Tom Senf deserves
special mention this week. Senf, 6-4
last week to tie sports editor Ken
Stevens for second place, suffered a

separated shoulder yesterday in Dosa
Beta's 32-0 whitewashing of Larkin in
B-League intramural action, but proved
he could pick with pain by submitting
his selections on time. Our best wishes
for a recovery by the playoffs. This
week's Greek is Stanford Baseball
Coach Mark Marquess. The 1969 All-
America first baseman for the Cardinal
also earned three letters in football
from 1966-1968. As the hardball coach
at his alma mater, Marquess has won
398 games in his career.
Marquess picked his old team to pull
off the upset tomorrow by a 27-24
score. Two of Marquess' ballplayers —
safety Walt Harris and tight end Jim
Price — will be in uniform tomorrow,
and a thiid, cornerback Toi Cook —
started four games before being
sidelined with a fractured wrist.
