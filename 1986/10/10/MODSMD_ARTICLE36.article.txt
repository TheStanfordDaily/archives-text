# Ojeda, Mets even N.L. playoffs; series moves on to New York
## 
### 
HOUSTON (AP) — The pitching
pendulum swung to New York last
night as Bob Ojeda matched finesse
against the power of Nolan Ryan, pitch
ing the Mets to a 5-1 victory over Hous
ton for a split of the first two games of
the National League playoffs.
Held without a run in support of
their ace, Dwight Gooden, in the first
game of the playoffs Wednesday night,
New York's tablesetters, Len Dykstra
and Wally Backman, got the Mets'
scoring machine going against Ryan.
And the big hitters — Keith Hernan
dez, Gary Carter and Darryl Strawberry
— applied the throttle.
Hernandez hit a two-run triple along
with a single and scored a run. Carter
had an RBI double, and Strawberry
drove in a run with a long sacrifice fly.
Backman had two hits, scored twice
and drove in a run. And Dykstra had
two hits and scored once.
Ojeda, 18-5 during the regular
season, allowed 10 hits, struck out five
and walked two — baffling and
beleaguering Houston's hitters with
his slow curve, changeup and oc
casional fastball. He flirted with trou
ble often, but the Astros managed just
one run.
The Astros, wasting one chance after
another, did not score until the

seventh on Phil Garner's RBI single. By
then, it was too late.
After a day off today, the best-of
seven series resumes tomorrow in
New York with Ron Darling, 15-6,
going for the Mets against Bob Knep
per, 17-12, in Game 3.
Beaten 1-0 in Game 1 by Mike Scott,
the Mets scored their first two runs of
the playoffs in the fourth inning against
Ryan, then nailed baseball's all-time
strikeout leader for three more in the
fifth. Held to a 100-pitch limit during
the latter part of the season after com
ing off his second tour on the disabled
list, Ryan could now work as long as he
was able, Astros Manager Hal Lanier
said.
Ryan was gone after five innings,
lifted for a pinch hitter. Coming off a 5-
1 finish during the regular season,
Ryan had given up five runs on seven
hits, striking out five.
Ryan, 12-8 during the season, had
retired the first 10 hitters, one shy of
the playoff record, when he got
Dykstra to ground out to first leading
off the fourth. Vida Blue set the record
of 11 consecutive outs at the start of a
game for Oakland in 1974.
But, on a 2-0 pitch, Backman got the
Mets first hit, a bouncing single up the
middle, and Hernandez followed with

an 0-2 single, a soft liner to center that
sent Backman to second. Carter, held
hitless in four at-bats and fanned three
times by Scon in Game 1, doubled off
the wall in right-center, scoring Back
man and sending Hernandez to third.
Hernandez scored on a sacrifice fly to
deep left field by Strawberry, and the
Mets led 2-0.
The Mets scored three more times
after Ryan had gotten two out in the
fifth. Rafael Santana singled with one
out, and Ojeda, attempting to sacrifice,
bunted into a forceout. Dykstra
slapped a Ryan curveball into left field
for a single that sent Ojeda to second,
and Backman drove in a run with his
second single.
Dykstra wound up at third, and
Backman went to second on the play
when center fielder Billy Hatcher's
throw was up the third-base line and
past catcher Alan Ashby for an error.
Hernandez then hit a line drive in the
right-center field gap, just out of
Hatcher's reach, for a two-run triple,
and the Mets had a 5-0 lead.
The Astros picked up right where
they left off in the series opener,
squandering one scoring chance after
another until finally breaking through
in the seventh.
