# Archambeau impressive after summer
## Redshirt freshman gains 20 pounds during offseason; wins starting spot 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff Writer 
Imagine being 6-feet-5 inches tall,
weighing 225 pounds and being told
that you were too small to play foot
ball. Sound ridiculous?
Well, that is exactly what happened
to redshirt freshman Lester Archam
beau. It's not that the Stanford coaches
didn't want to play him. They just knew
that for Archambeau to play up to his
potential, he needed to get bigger.
Stanford Defensive Coordinator Dick
Mannini knew that he had a potentially
great defensive end on his hands, but
he also knew that Archambeau needed
another year of conditioning.
So if you're Lester Archambeau, you
listen and do what you're asked to do.
The results have been even better than
expected. The once-skinny lineman
from Montville, New Jersey has come
back from a grueling summer 20
pounds heavier and a lot stronger. In
the process, he has caught the eye of
many.
"He's exceeded our expectations as
a redshirt freshman," Mannini said.
"He had an excellent spring, and it's
obvious to us that he hasn't begun to
scratch the surface of his potential."
If Mannini is right, Cardinal football
fans have a lot to look forward to. Ar
chambeau is just the type of player that
can make you say "Garin Who?," when
you think of current NFL standout and
former Cardinal lineman Garin Veris.
Through four games Archambeau
has been in on 22 tackles and 2.5 sacks.
Watch him explode off the ball and
drive the opponent staight back and
you'll know why football pundits
around the conference are predicting
big things for this young man.
Yet with all the sudden adulation, Ar
chambeau remains modest. True to
what his teammates and coaches cite as
his "workaholic" attitude, Archambeau
continually finds something to work
on.

"I feel that I'm playing pretty well.
I'm picking up a lot of experience that
I lacked at the beginning of the
season," Archambeau said. "1 really felt
that my pass rush was better during
spring ball, but I'm working on it every
day."
For Archambeau, an industrial engi
neering major, hard work is nothing
new. In high school, Archambeau not
only excelled on the playing field but
also in the classroom. His statistics,
both academic and scholastic were
good enough to get him named to the
first team of the USA Today Academic
All-America squad and The Associated
Press First Team All-New Jersey. He
also picked up a Garden State Distin
guished Scholar award just for fun.
Over the summer, Archambeau kept
up his hard work. "After spring ball, I
was first on the depth chart at defen
sive end. I knew that I'd have to get a
lot bigger to hold that spot. I also had
to prepare myself mentally for start
ing," Archambeau explained.
The result was a schedule that would
kill most mortals. Archambeau worked
40 hours per week, came home and
spent five nights a week weight lifting,
after which he ran — just for good
measure.
His long hours did not go un
noticed. "We're really pleased with
Lester's progress," Mannini said. "He's
increased his strength and weight. He's
still growing, too. There is no limit to
his potential."
In a year that has seen the Cardinal
defense emerge as a tough, hard
hitting unit, Archambeau, like many
others on the squad, feels that the only
difference is attitude.
"Having David Wyman back is a
huge plus. He gets all of us fired up.
Also, we're just more experienced and
playing better," Archambeau said. "We
also worked our butts off this summer
to get in shape," he added.
"Surprisingly, he's taken on the role
of a leader," Mannini said. "Some

people are just natural leaders on and
off the field."
Archambeau says recent media hype
that Stanford has turned into a dirty
team is all nonsense.
"We're tough, yes. But dirty? No way.
We just decided not to take all the stuff
that teams dish out. Now, we're taking

on the offensive, and just because this
is Stanford, they don't expect that from
us," Archambeau said.
As for the 12th-ranked Washington
Huskies, Stanford's opponent tomor
row, Archambeau feels ready. "A lot of
people still don't believe in us — just

like before the Texas game. We need
to beat Washington, and we aim to do
it,"the redshirt freshman said.
"Practice this week was intense."
Archambeau said cornerback Toi
Cook, who fractured his wrist in last
weekend's game and will probably

miss the remainder of the regular
season, will definitely be missed, but
he feels that sophomore Pat Kelly can
fill in. "Any time you lose a star, it
hurts," he said. "Fat (Kelly) will fit right
in. Also, they (Washington) run a lot, so
there won t be as much pressure on
the defensive backs."


Stanford defensive tackle Lester Archambeau (72) worked out ex
tensively over the summer, and his hard work has paid off, earning the

chambeau may develop into one of the best linemen in the Pac-10.
