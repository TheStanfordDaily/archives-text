# Frat suspended for rowdy party
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
The University yesterday temporar
ily suspended the Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity due to "the drunkenness, the
belligerence and the lack of respect"
displayed at a house party Monday
night, according to Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.
The disturbance was reported to
police at 3:20 a.m. by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
"The mental picture of men dressed
in boxer shorts and women scantily
clad, all soaked in beer, raises some
questions," said Fraternal Affairs Advi
ser Joe Pisano. "Certainly, that was not
an average party. What was going on?"
In an Oct 8 letter to fraternity Presi
dent Stephen Modory, Lyons
prohibited all Phi Delt social events, on
or off campus, spoasored or planned
by pledges or members of the frater
nity until further notice.
"Violation of this action will be
cause to consider a more serious and
permanent action," the letter states.
"I don't imagine there was anybody
asleep in my neighborhood," Kennedy
said of Monday night.
Police entered the house at about
3:30 a.m. and broke up the party.
According to Modory, the party was
a private one that "just got out of
hand."
The All-Greek Council, a committee
formed last spring of students involved
in fraternities and sororities, began in
vestigation of the incident at a meeting
yesterday, according to Pisano.
Pisano will consider the council's re
commendation when making a deci
sion on the future of the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity. Pisano estimated that a
decision should be reached in about
two weeks.
"It's not clear that they'll be denied
housing or recognition," Pisano said.
He added that "The Phi Delts need to
bridge the gap between their stated
purpose and the reality of their daily
life."
Modory said, "Maybe we do have to
re-evaluate the ways we have fun. Many
people would be offended by those
ways. We want to have fun, but most of
all we want to continue existing at the
University."
Kennedy met with officers, mem
bers and pledges of the Phi Delt house
at 7:30 a.m. yesterday to discuss their
behavior.
"There are times when it is useful
for a president to deliver a strong
message about what is and isn't accep
table here," Kennedy said. "This is a

group of people that I think can turn
things around."
Modory called yesterday's meeting
with Kennedy "very constructive" and
said "a lot of positive things will come
out of this in one way or another."
According to Pisano, the suspension
is ironic because the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity set guidelines for having par
ties that were adopted by the Inter
fraternity Council last spring. The
pamphlet, entitled "How to Throw a
Safe and Successful Party," is "a good
package" according to Pisano.
"I don't think it's ironic," Modory
said yesterday. "To tell you the truth,
all of those rules were followed. There
were numerous people at the party
who were sober, to make sure that
people were safe. And there was food
around.
"One question that will come up is,
were people in danger at the party? I
think not," Modory said. He added that
"The noise was our fault though."
Modory said he was annoyed by a
press release pointing out that minors
at the party were intoxicated. "The Uni
versity lets students make their own
decisions about alcohol. People being
exposed to alcohol is part of growing
up in college."
Pisano said the action against the Phi
Delts was not part of any overall action
by the University against the
frats."Some say Stanford is anti-frat.
Stanford is neither pro- nor anti-frat.
They're anti-problem. We support the
best ideals of fraternity life."
According to Lyons, "Certainly it's
the case that if one looks at the history
of parties that have gotten out of con
trol here, there are higher incidences
of them at the residential fraternities."
Modory said: "Right now is not a
good time for fraternities at the Univer
sity." Pisano agreed, saying, "People

need to know that there is short
tolerance for this t>pe of behavior right
now."
A presentation on the future of
fraternal organizations is scheduled for
Oct. 17 at 4 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
Kennedy, Lyons, Pisano and Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin
are scheduled to speak. The presenta
tion will he open to all students.

The University yesterday temporar
ily suspended the Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity due to "the drunkenness, the
belligerence and the lack of respect"
displayed at a house party Monday
night, according to Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.
The disturbance was reported to
police at 3:20 a.m. by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
"The mental picture of men dressed
in boxer shorts and women scantily
clad, all soaked in beer, raises some
questions," said Fraternal Affairs Advi
ser Joe Pisano. "Certainly, that was not
an average party. What was going on?"
In an Oct 8 letter to fraternity Presi
dent Stephen Modory, Lyons
prohibited all Phi Delt social events, on
or off campus, spoasored or planned
by pledges or members of the frater
nity until further notice.
"Violation of this action will be
cause to consider a more serious and
permanent action," the letter states.
"I don't imagine there was anybody
asleep in my neighborhood," Kennedy
said of Monday night.
Police entered the house at about
3:30 a.m. and broke up the party.
According to Modory, the party was
a private one that "just got out of
hand."
The All-Greek Council, a committee
formed last spring of students involved
in fraternities and sororities, began in
vestigation of the incident at a meeting
yesterday, according to Pisano.
Pisano will consider the council's re
commendation when making a deci
sion on the future of the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity. Pisano estimated that a
decision should be reached in about
two weeks.
"It's not clear that they'll be denied
housing or recognition," Pisano said.
He added that "The Phi Delts need to
bridge the gap between their stated
purpose and the reality of their daily
life."
Modory said, "Maybe we do have to
re-evaluate the ways we have fun. Many
people would be offended by those
ways. We want to have fun, but most of
all we want to continue existing at the
University."
Kennedy met with officers, mem
bers and pledges of the Phi Delt house
at 7:30 a.m. yesterday to discuss their
behavior.
"There are times when it is useful
for a president to deliver a strong
message about what is and isn't accep
table here," Kennedy said. "This is a

group of people that I think can turn
things around."
Modory called yesterday's meeting
with Kennedy "very constructive" and
said "a lot of positive things will come
out of this in one way or another."
According to Pisano, the suspension
is ironic because the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity set guidelines for having par
ties that were adopted by the Inter
fraternity Council last spring. The
pamphlet, entitled "How to Throw a
Safe and Successful Party," is "a good
package" according to Pisano.
"I don't think it's ironic," Modory
said yesterday. "To tell you the truth,
all of those rules were followed. There
were numerous people at the party
who were sober, to make sure that
people were safe. And there was food
around.
"One question that will come up is,
were people in danger at the party? I
think not," Modory said. He added that
"The noise was our fault though."
Modory said he was annoyed by a
press release pointing out that minors
at the party were intoxicated. "The Uni
versity lets students make their own
decisions about alcohol. People being
exposed to alcohol is part of growing
up in college."
Pisano said the action against the Phi
Delts was not part of any overall action
by the University against the
frats."Some say Stanford is anti-frat.
Stanford is neither pro- nor anti-frat.
They're anti-problem. We support the
best ideals of fraternity life."
According to Lyons, "Certainly it's
the case that if one looks at the history
of parties that have gotten out of con
trol here, there are higher incidences
of them at the residential fraternities."
Modory said: "Right now is not a
good time for fraternities at the Univer
sity." Pisano agreed, saying, "People

need to know that there is short
tolerance for this t>pe of behavior right
now."
