# Peete leads Trojans to national ranking

LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Quarterback Rodney Peete has had a very positive effect
on USC in its climb back to football respectability.
"Positive," in fact, could be Peete's middle name.
"I've always believed you should be positive in every situation.'' said the sopho
more, whose scrambling and timely passing have helped the Trojans to a 4-0
record and catapulted them from nowhere to No. 9 in the Associated Press
rankings.
"That's the way I've been all my life, look for positive things in everything I do.
Nothing positive will come out of negative thoughts.
"My attitude is a carryover from my father; that's his attitude,'' said Peete, whose
dad, Willie, is an assistant coach with the Kansas City Chiefs.
Although Peete's football career was jeopardized last December when he suf
fered a serious tear to his left Achilles tendon in the Aloha Bowl, he was positive
he would bounce back.
This fall, he seems even quicker and more agile than before the injury.
"He's amazing. He's always upbeat," USC Coach Ted Tollner says of the person
able, articulate young man. "Even when he had the cast on, he was in the weight
room every day talking to the guys."
Peete's attitude has served him well on the field this season. Even during the
Trojans' game against Baylor last month, when he and the rest of the Southern Cal
offense did not have a first down until the fourth quarter, Peete was convinced
something good would happen.
After giving a brief pep talk in the huddle, Peete drove the Trojans down the
field and threw a 12-yard scoring pass to Ken Henry with four minutes remaining
to tie the game 14-14.
