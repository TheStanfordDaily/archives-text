### 
BERKELEY (AP) — Four mem
bers of the California football team
have been questioned by police in
vestigating a reported rape on the
campus, according to school offi
cials.
No arrests have been made, and
no charges been filed. UC officials
wouldn't reveal the identities of the
four players, and Sports Informa
tion Director Kevin Reneau said the
athletes will play in tomorrow's
game against Oregon State.
"It would be inappropriate to
make any further statement, or take
any action in regard to the persons
involved, until the investigation is
complete," Reneau said.
Officials said the police findings
will be turned over to the Alameda
County district attorney's office
once the investigation is completed,

probably early next week.
Campus officials said the incident
occurred Sept. 27 after Cal had
been beaten by San Jose State, 35-
14. The woman, who is a freshman,
said in a complaint filed with
campus police that three of the four
men had sexual relations with her
and forced her to have oral sex with
them, said Ray Colvig, chief publica
tion officer for the university.
Colvig said the incident occurred
near the victim's room in a co
educational dormitory. He said the
woman didn't file her complaint
immediately but was examined at
the campus health facility the morn
ing after the incident.
The incident also is being inves
tigated by the UC Office of Student
Conduct.
