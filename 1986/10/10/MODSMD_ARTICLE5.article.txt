# University investigates DU hazing
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
The University has begun an
investigation into allegations
that pledges of the un
recognized Delta Upsilon frater
nity were forced by DU mem
bers to drink alcohol to the
point of vomiting, according to
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano.
The investigation will be con
ducted by University Judicial Af
fairs Officer Sally Cole.
On Tuesday, Stanford police
sent a report to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyoas concerning
an intoxicated DU pledge the
police found asleep in his van.
The pledge told police that he
and other pledges had been
hazed.
"If the allegation is sustained, they
will be prosecuted legally and/or
through the judicial affairs officer,"
Pisano said yesterday.
Last May, the University dissolved
the fraternity and revoked its housing
privileges. This year, the house, lo
cated at 353 Mayfield is a coed
residence.
Since then, the DUs have pledged a

new class of fraternity members
despite being told by Pisano not to do
so, according to Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson.
Dealing with the DUs is a frustrating
issue because the University does not
recognize the fraternity, Pisano said. "It
would be a little maddening. How can
you prosecute a group that you say
does not exist?" he said.
Members of the unofficial fraternity
will be prosecuted individually if the
allegations of hazing are proved true,
Pisano said.
"Collectively we've already done the
worst thing you can do to the DUs."
Present restrictions on the fraternity
state that the earliest time the fraternity
could apply for recognition is 1989.
The earliest date for housing is fall
1991.
"All we could do is add more time to
that," Pisano said. "But alter a point, all
(of the current members) will have
graduated. It doesn't make sense to
punish those who aren't the problem."
