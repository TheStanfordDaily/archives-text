point of vomiting, according to
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano.
The investigation will be con
ducted by University Judicial Af

On Tuesday, Stanford police
sent a report to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyoas concerning
an intoxicated DU pledge the
police found asleep in his van.
The pledge told police that he
and other pledges had been
hazed.
