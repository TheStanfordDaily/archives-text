### LIZ LEMPERT 
"Even though the Public Service Center will
soon become mainstream, I hope that you will
never lose the energy and idealism of embattled
beginners," said University President Donald
Kennedy at a Public Service Center open house
held yesterday in Owen House.
The event, featuring a few brief remarks from
Kennedy, was designed to acquaint the Stanford
community with the center and to introduce
some new programs that are scheduled to start
this year. During the open house, visitors were
free to wander throughout the Owen House and
ask questions of the center's representatives.
Monisha Bhutani, a freshman who attended the
open house, said: "It's a good opportunity to find
out about all the opportunities for students to get
involved in."
"The most common excuse for not volunteer
ing for public service is 'I don't have enough
time,"' said Alma Derricks, the center's media and
public relations coordinator.
But it doesn't have to take a lot of time You
can volunteer once a week — even once a month
... or you can spend a whole summer or an
entire year."
In order to make volunteer opportunities more
accessible to the Stanford community, the center
will hold its third annual Community Service
Faire in White Plaza today from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Representatives from many agencies will present
information on the wide range of public service
opportunities available in the Palo Alto area.

83 the center was established as an advisory com
mittee to the president's office in order to review
public service opportunities for Stanford stu
dents, according to Derricks.
Derricks said the Public Service Center is the
umbrella organization for most public service
groups on campus.
Among the programs highlighted at the open
house were the Stanford Tutoring Program, the
Reach Out Today project and recently created
Stanford day camp/summer school.
The Stanford Tutoring Program, one of the ser
vice groups working in the center, will coor
dinate and oversee all Stanford tutoring programs
in East Palo Alto. The program, which received a
three-year $75,000 grant from the San Francisco
Foundation, is not meant to replace already exist
ing tutoring projects but will serve as a support
network for students and groups interested or in
volved in the East Palo Alto community.
"There have been several tutoring programs
on campus, but their successes have fluctuated.
Most are started and run by one student who
eventually graduates off. The (program) insures a
central person and contact," Derricks said.
The morale seems to be higher, the commu
nity participation is greater and the schools are
getting better. There is a new energy," said Mag
dalena Fittoria, the head of the Stanford Tutoring
Program.
"There is a lot of initiative out there. Students
are/:alling me even- day to volunteer." she said.
An orientation and training workshop will be
held on Saturday at El Centro Chicano from 9-
