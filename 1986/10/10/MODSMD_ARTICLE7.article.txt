# Experts talk on summit

University experts on international
relations and arms control are skepti
cal about the prospects of the Reagan-
Gorbachev meeting in Iceland this
weekend.
"It seems to me that it is a cosmetic
meeting," said Politcal Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall.
The announcement of the mini
summit came on Sept. 30 after Soviet
Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, in a letter
to President Reagan, offered to meet
the president on the neutral soil of
Reykjavik, Iceland. Reagan labelled the
meeting as a preparatory summit to
clear the way for a future meeting with
Gorbachev in Washington, scheduled
tentatively for later this year.
Marshall said Reagan is not inter
ested in an arms control agreement be
cause the president thinks he can win
the arms race. As long as the United
States pursues the Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI), the Soviets will not put
any limitations on offensive missiles,
he said.
Marshall added that the Soviets
pursued the meeting in order to woo Britain and
Germany from the NATO alliance.
According to Coit Blacke r , associate director for
the center on International Security and Arms Con
trol, the Soviet Union and the United States have dif
ferent motivations for initiating the summit. The
Soviets only wish to discuss arms control, while the
United States considers the issue of human rights and
areas of regional conflict such as Afghanistan to be
critical agenda items.
The recent circumstances of the case involving
Nicholas DanilofF, the U.S. journalist who was ar
rested by Soviet agents in August and recently
released, will increase the importance of human
rights as an issue for the United States, he said.

Richard Staar, coordinator of the International
Studies Program at the Hoover Institution, said the
meeting will be a photographic opportunity for the
president to act in the role of peacekeeper. With na
tional elections coming in November, the mini
summit will provide Republicans with a public rela
tions coup, he said.
However, Starr said the Soviets might use the mini
summit to justify a delay in the regular summit,
which was planned last year in Geneva. The Soviets
can then mobilize public opinion against the United
States and force it to make compromises on SDI, he
said. He added that the Soviets have an edge, because
"we want the summit more than they do."
Blacker agreed that the Soviets possess a public re
lations advantage going into the summit. For the last
week, Moscow has been emphasizing the importance
of these talks, which they introduced, he said, adding
that the Soviets have trumpeted such possible
outcomes as a moratorium on nuclear weapons. "If

the summit is a success, they can take the credit. If it
fails, they can blame the U.S.", he said.
According to History Prof. Barton Bernstein, there
are two reasons why summits occur. Summits con
firm agreements already reached by countries, and
they also arise when "there is a desire within the
body politic" for a dialogue between the two com
peting countries.
Bernstein said the November elections are a sub
stantial motivating factor for Reagan to agree to the
summit. While Reagan already has the support of
conservative Republicans, this diplomatic move will
enable Reagan to acquire a more "centrist" appeal,
he said.
If an agreement is reached, if another meeting is
proposed or if nothing disastrous happens, then the
summit should be considered successful, Bernstein
said.
"I would be very surprised if anything substantial
occurs," he added.
