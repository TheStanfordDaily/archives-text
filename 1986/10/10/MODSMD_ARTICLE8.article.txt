Claiborne impeached by Senate
WASHINGTON — The Senate, exercising its impeachment powers for
only the fifth time, found U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne guilty of "high
crimes and misdemeanors" yesterday and removed him from his $78,700-
a-year lifetime post.
By a margin that far exceeded the two-thirds majority necessary for con
viction, senators adopted three of the four articles of impeachment to oust
the Las Vegas, Nev., judge, who is serving a prison term for federal income
tax evasion.
Claiborne had fought unsuccessfully for a full-blown Senate trial with as
many as 58 witnesses. But the Senate adopted a procedure in which a spe
cial 12-member committee heard 18 witnesses over seven days last month
and summarized the evidence in a booklet presented to other senators.
Claiborne tried to get a U.S. district judge, a panel of appellate judges
and even the Supreme Court to overrule the streamlined procedure, but
the courts refused to intervene.
Claiborne's impeachment trial was the first such proceeding in 50 years.
Only four federal officials — all of them judges — had been convicted by
the Senate. Claiborne was the only sitting judge to be serving a prison term
at the time of his Senate trial.
Impeachment proceedings against him were necessary only because he
had refused to resign his lifetime judgeship and was getting paid while in
prison.
Reagan in Iceland for summit
Iceland — President Reagan arrived in a cold, pounding rain
in Iceland yesterday nigh! for his hastily scheduled and widely questioned
summit conference with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
The president, his overcoat buttoned to the neck, was greeted at the
Keflavik airport 30 miles from here by Vigdis Finnbogadottir, the 56-year
old former theater director and professor of French who is president of
Iceland, the little North Atlantic country that is the surprise site for the
second encounter between the leaders of the two superpowers.
Gorbachev is scheduled to arrive here today for the weekend round of
talks that have aroused both controversy and intense speculation. They
were suddenly proposed by Gorbachev and accepted by Reagan less than
two weeks ago.
While many analysts and critics expect little out of the talks save the set
ting of a formal date for another summit conference in the United States
later this year or next year, a recent change of atmosphere has led some to
wonder if the talks might produce something more substantial.
Reagan and Gorbachev met for the first time in Geneva last November.
The Soviets have taken the position that, although a conciliatory spirit was
established at Geneva, the American government has failed so far to follow
through with concrete steps that could lead to some kind of disarmament
agreement.
Laßouche harrasses lawyers
WASHINGTON — Political extremist Lyndon Laßouche and his as
sociates were so upset about the federal investigation of the group's
finances that they spent entire nights making telephone calls to harass gov
ernment lawyers, picketed several courthouses and sent colleagues to Ger
many to keep them from appearing before a grand jury, federal authorities
testified yesterday.
Yesterday's hearing in federal magistrate's court in Alexandria, Va.
brought forth a wealth of testimony about the little-known world of the
Laßouche organization —■ a world in which a range of political activists on
the political fringes, from neo-Nazis to the militant Jewish underground,
were said to have traded information with the Laßouche followers and
then informed on one another to the authorities.
After a five-hour hearing yesterday, U.S. Magistrate Harris Grimsley or
dered Steinberg and her husband Jeffrey, both Leesburg, Va. residents who
are said to be top Laßouche lieutenants, held without bail pending their
trial on obstruction of justice charges in Boston. Grimsley said that there is
"clear and convincing evidence" that the Steinbergs and an array of
Laßouche-affiliated organizations are obstructing justice in connection with
a Boston grand jury investigation that on Monday returned a 117-count in
dictment.
U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone of Boston has fined the Laßouche
group more than $21 million for failing to respond to subpoenas.
Immigration bill passes House
WASHINGTON — Immigration reform legislation easily cleared a test
vote and neared passage in the House yesterday night, brightening chances
that Congress may soon resolve a frustrating, 15-year struggle to tighten
control of the nation's porous borders.
The 278-129 test vote, which came on a procedural question, signaled a
major comeback for the sweeping and controversial measure that would
mandate fines and jail terms for employers who knowingly hire illegal
aliens while offering legal status to tens of thousands of others already in
the country.
Sponsors of the package dismissed it as dead two weeks ago when the
House turned down a Democratic plan to resolve a critical dispute involv
ing the rights of Western growers to retain their largely alien work forces.
But key Republicans and Democrats revived the bill with a new compro
mise this week, prompting many lawmakers to marvel during yesterday's
debate about the reform drive's resiliency.
Despite the optimism, the House bill only narrowly survived being
gutted late yesterday when an amendment to remove the amnesty provi
sions for those illegally here was defeated by a small margin.
U.S. Navy ships will visit China
PEKING — The United States and China reached final agreement yester
day, after more than two years of negotiating, on a visit by three U.S. Navy
ships to the Chinese port of Qingdao next month.
Although the visit would have little military significance, the timing of
the announcement, two days before the Iceland summit conference,
served to underline the growing ties between Washington and Peking at a
time when U.S.-Soviet relations, which had been thawing, are in a state of
uncertainty.
Under the agreement, three vessels — a cruiser, a destroyer and a frigate
now in Sydney, Australia — will visit Qingdao from Nov. 5-11 A Chinese of
ficial said the ships would bring 894 officers and men to the city.
Although the agreement provides for a reciprocal visit by the Chinese
navy to the United States, the force here is considered a coastal navy, and
no plans were announced for Chinese vessels to head for the United States.
South Africa group loses funds
PRETORIA, South Africa — Cracking down harder on the United Demo
cratic Front, the country's leading anti-apartheid group, the South African
government yesterday barred it from receiving any foreign funds, which
now constitute more than half its budget.
President Pieter Botha, acting under a 1974 law intended to prevent
foreign control of South African political movements, declared the United
Democratic Front to be an "affected organization" prohibited from receiv
ing any money from abroad.
The government later appointed a senior security officer to freeze the
UDF accounts, inspect its finances and oversee many of its day-to-day
operations to ensure compliance with the new restriction.
Azhar Cachalia, treasurer of the three-year-old coalition of anti-apartheid
groups, told reporters later in Johannesburg that the move brought the
government within a step of formally outlawing the organization, whose
700 affiliates have more than 2 million members. As he spoke, security
policemen searched the organization's offices, seizing boxes of docu
ments.
