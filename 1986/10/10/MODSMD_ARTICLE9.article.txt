### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — An Ameri
can captured after a contra weapons
supply plane was shot down over
Nicaragua said yesterday he worked
with CIA employees and took part in
10 such flights from Honduras and El
Salvador.
Eugene Hasenfus, 45, of Marinette,
Wis., said in a nationally broadcast
news conference that four of the flights
were made from Aguacate air base in
Honduras and six from Ilopango air
base in El Salvador.
"We would be flying into Honduras
... and we would be loading up on
small arms and ammunition, and this
would be flown to Nicaragua," he said.
"These we would drop to the contras."
Hasenfus said 24 to 26 "company
people" assisted the program in El Sal
vador, including flight crews, mainte
nance crews and "two Cuban nation
alized Americans that worked for the
CIA." Hasenfus identified the Cuban-

Americans as Max Gomez and Ramon
Medina.
Hasenfus said he was offered the job
in June by William Cooper, identified
as the pilot of the aircraft. Cooper was
one of three people killed when the
aircraft was shot down Sunday by a
surface-to-air missile and crashed in
southern Nicaragua.
Nicaraguan officials have claimed
the supply operation was part of a CIA
effort to help the contras, who have
been fighting for four years to over
throw the Sandinista government. Un
der restrictions imposed by Congress,
the CIA may not aid the contras.
CIA spokeswoman Kathy Pherson
said the agency could only respond to
Hasenfus' remarks by repeating its ear
lier denials of involvement.
President Reagan and other U.S. offi
cials also have denied that the plane or
its crew had ties to the U.S. govern
ment.

Hasenfus said he was told he would
be paid $3,000 per month plus
housing, transportation and expenses
for working with the air crews.
He said he was employed by Cor
porate Air Services, which has the
same Miami address as Southern Air
Transport, formerly owned by the CIA.
Hasenfus said he left the Marines in
1965 and then "took an employment
with a company called Air America.
This company worked in Southeast
Asia."
Air America was one of the CIA
airlines during the Vietnam War.
He said he stopped working for Air
America in 1973 and returned to the
United States.
Nicaraguan officials have said
Hasenfus faces up to 30 years in prison,
although no charges have been filed.
U.S. Donald Tyson
met for two hours yesterday with offi

cials at the Nicaraguan Foreign Mini
stry.
Asked when the Sandinistas would
allow U.S. officials to see Hasenfus,
Tyson said: "I really don't have any
thing to say."
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman An
gela Saballos said the bodies of the
three men killed in the crash would be
returned to their families. One victim
has not been identified.
Nicaragua sent the United States a
note of protest Wednesday and called
on the Reagan administration "to aban
don its politics of force, threats and in
tervention in Central American and ac
cept the path of dialogue."
In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the larg
est of the contra groups, said the men
on the plane had worked with them
since 1984.
