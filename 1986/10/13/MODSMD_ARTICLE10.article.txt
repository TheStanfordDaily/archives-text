# Nicaragua: Hasenfus to stand trial
## 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua â€” President Daniel Ortega
says that an American captured after a rebel supply
plane was shot down will be tried soon, but it still
was not clear yesterday what charges would be filed
against him.
The president made his first comments on the Oct.
5 downing of a C-123 transport over southern
Nicaragua in a nationally broadcast town meeting Sat
urday.
Ortega angrily denounced what he called the
"direct participation" of the U.S. government in
aiding guerrillas fighting the Nioiraguan govern
ment.
Ortega later told reporters that Eugene Hasenfus,

of Marinette, Wis., will be tried soon in the People's
Courts.
"In a very short time, I mean quickly, he will be
sent to the appropriate courts to be judged," he said.
Other Sandinista officials have said Hasenfus could
face up to 30 years in prison. The People's Courts
were formed after the leftist Sandinista National
Liberation Front came to power in July 1979, ending
42 years of government by the rightist, pro-American
Somoza dynasty.
The president said documents found in the C-123's
wreckage proved the U.S. role. "There are no doubts
about the involvement of the United States in all
these actions," Ortega said.

President Reagan and other officials have denied
any U.S. government involvement in the flight.
But Ortega said U.S. officials "stimulate terrorist
actions such as this, but when people die they do not
take responsibility for the action They just call
them heroes."
Ortega said other Americans helping the insur
gents, known as contras, would end up in prison or
be killed.
Hasenfus said Thursday he took part in 10 supply
flights from El Salvador and Honduras for rebels
inside Nicaragua and that the CIA was involved in the
operation.
