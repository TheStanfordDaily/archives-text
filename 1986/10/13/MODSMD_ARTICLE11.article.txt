# Public service grants awarded

One student helped provide medi
cal care at Native American gatherings
and religious ceremonies last summer.
Another set up a sister hospital pro
gram with a hospital in El Salvador.
Two others worked with terminally ill
children in Northern California, taking
them sailing and horseback riding.
The students were recipients of
Public Service Summer Fellowships,
said Sue Gray, coordinator of the
public service opportunities clearing
house.
Fellowship grants, which range from
$200 to $1,200, are used to fund

innovative public service projects of
the students' own design," Gray said.
About 20 students receive fellow
ships each summer. The three-year-old
program is funded by an anonymous
donation of $500,000.
There are no geographical limits on
the area in which a project can take
place, nor are specific types of projects
preferred. "We don't want to cut off
creative, imaginative ideas," said Gray.
Stanford student Lome Needle
received a fellowship to start the East
Palo Alto/Stanford Summer Academy.
In his program, 21 kids from East Palo
Alto worked with computers at LOTS,
wrote plays and stories, and partici

pated in cultural- and community
awareness sessions in which they dis
cussed aspects of life in East Palo Alto.
"I was looking for a summer public
service project, and an idea was float
ing around Owen House (the campus
public service center) about a summer
program for kids, so 1 jumped in,"
Needle explained.
He said he aimed to motivate
children to continue their education.
"In some high schools in East Palo
Alto, three-quarters of the kids drop
out," he said.
Gray said that many students had a
"bonding experience" with people
that they worked with and that many

wanted to continue after the summer,
even though fellowship funding had
ended.
The deadline for applications, which
must outline the scope of the pro
posed projects, is mid-April. Applica
tions will be available in January.
Owen House staffers often work with
students in developing their ideas.
A selection committee evaluates the
proposal as to its community impact,
impact on the Stanford community,
and its feasibility given an 8-week time
frame. The selection committee is
comprised of faculty, staff, community
leaders and previous fellowship
recipients.
Besides their dedication, the most
striking thing about fellowship
recipients is their flexibility, according
to Gray. She said the students have "a
great ability to adapt to a changing en
vironment."
She said this allows them to deal
with unexpected changes in their proj
ects resulting from both their own new
ideas and from changes in the commu
nity they are working in.
