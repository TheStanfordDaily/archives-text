# Stanford felines on hit list
## 
### AIMEE BERG 
Four University staff members, worried that a campus
wide cat-extermination drive has begun, are circulating a
flier urging people to adopt Stanford's semi-wild cats.
But Ron Parker of Stanford's Department of Operations
and Maintenance said cats are being trapped and sent to the
pound unharmed.
Parker said the cat population has gotten out of hand and
that die current trapping campaign began after several com
plaints were received from building managers.
Herb Fong, manager of plants and grounds, said there are
"hundreds of calls each year reporting dead cats under
buildings and in walls."
The campus cat population has flourished thanks to stu
dents and staff who cannot resist the temptation to feed and
sometimes shelter a wandering feline.
"There's no doubt in my mind that the problem is
human-induced," Fong said. "And it's (caused by) the
people with the best intentions."
One University maintenance worker claims he knew of a
woman who, for seven years, spent part of her monthly So
cial Security check on Kibbles 'n' Bits that she left for cats in
the Quad.
The cats carry fleas and can transmit disease, Fong said.
Parker said "these cats are not in the best health. Many
don't have proper medical care."

Parker told of a University plumber who was attacked in
the steam tunnels by the mother of wild kittens. He nearly
underwent the painful rabies series of shots.
Strays also reside in dorm rooms, basements and near
food service. Junior Mimi Coughlin recalled an incident last
year when two people in Twain "were raising a nest of
abandoned kittens (that) had maggots and smelled. You'd
go into the laundry room and run over their tails with the
door," she said. The cats would then sqeal loudly and
scamper away, only to return when hungry.
During her freshman year at Wilbur Hall, Coughlin said,
cats "always used to sit on the lunch tables outside... beg at
mealtime, and eat off your plate."
Vadim Matte, one of the four founders of the Help Save
the Cats project, wrote in a newsletter that the University
diverted a portion of its cat-control funds to the group. The
letter says the group has agreed to spay or neuter the cats
and to provide identification and shot information with a
collar.
The cats are then returned to campus.
So far, Matte wrote, "this is happening in the area of the
McCullough Building, Durand Building, and other SEL
buildings."
Parker would like to see the over-population problem
prevented by "educating people that they're not doing cats a
favor by feeding them on a random basis."
