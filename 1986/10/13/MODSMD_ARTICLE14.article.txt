If the "mental picture of men dressed in boxer shorts
and women scantily clad, all soaked in beer, raises some
questions" for Fraternal Affairs Advisor Joe Pisano, cer
tainly the possible threat of denying housing or recogni
tion to the Phi Delta Theta fraternity raises serious ques
tions in the minds of Stanford students.
Temporary suspension of the fraternity is the logical
result of a party that was too loud, too late and apparently
t(x> rowdy. When even University President Donald Ken
nedy's relatively secluded dwelling is disturbed by the
party's noises at 3:30 a.m., then some punitive action
must be taken against any group that would be so incon
siderate to its neighbors.
But revoke housing and/or recognition of the Phi
Delts for one private party that got slightly out of hand?
Unless the All Greek Council's investigation into the
party turns up evidence of some illegal or violent behav
ior, the administration would simply be going too far in
revoking housing for a "first offense" so early in the year.
The University must be careful not to act irresponsibly
out of frustration from its experiences with other frater
nities in the past. Making an example out of this case
would be counterproductive, considering how unrea
sonable the threatened punishment is compared to the
infraction.

Of course, the Phi Delts must also assume some re
sponsibility in this unfortunate and unnecessary affair. If
fraternities consider themselves a major source of Stan
ford social life, then they must conduct their parties in a
responsible manner, instead of forcing others to control
social events by calling the police. Indefinite suspension
should sober up the Phi Delts enough to teach them a
lesson about what is and is not acceptable behavior for
campus parties.
If fraternity presidents truly experience confusion as
to what Stanford considers acceptable party behavior,
the University needs to lay down specific guidelines by
which the fraternities can know where to draw the line at
their social functions. Perhaps such issues as what time
parties should end, what is an acceptable noise level,
how much alcohol can be available and what days of the
week parties can be held should be addressed by the
University and made clear to the fraternities (as well as to
everyone else who holds parties on campus).
If miscommunication persists in these issues, frats will
feel unfairly punished while the University becomes
more frustrated with what it considers students' blatant
disregard of acceptable behavior on campus.
