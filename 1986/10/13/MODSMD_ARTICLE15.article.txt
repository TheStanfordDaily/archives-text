Producer:
Stanford calendar
is harmless
Well, I knew someone would say
something eventually. It was inevi
table, especially with the shortage of
chic protestable events this quarter.
We're all suckers for a little bit of
controversy, but perhaps this latest
one should have begun on a more
realistic note than Scott Shaeffer's
column (Daily, Oct. 9).
In his column, Shaeffer attacks the
"Women of Stanford" calendar by
wondering first whether there is "no
regulation guarding the use of the
word Stanford on items." Well, there
is one. And if Shaeffer had done a
little research, he would have discov
ered that the Stanford Bookstore owns
all licensing rights to the name
"Stanford." A contract was signed with
the Bookstore in order for the calen
dars to be sold both on and off
campus. The Bookstore decided that
the Stanford name was not being
jeopardized, and thus granted the
license.
Of course, in most of his discourse,
Shaeffer takes issue with the whole
idea of the calendar. I can't even
begin to take issue with him, because
it would simply be too ridiculous.
However, there are a few thing that
bear mentioning.
Shaeffer believes there is little
difference between this calendar and
pornography. Give me a break. Most
of my friends, both male and female,
think the whole thing is "cute." But
pornographic? I'm sorry if Shaeffer is
offended by a few too many shoulders
and smiles.
What? You detect a hint of sarcasm?
It's just that the whole thing seems
rather harmless. And I can say that
because ultimately I would be respon
sible had any exploitation taken place.
(So that gets about 3,000 guys off the
hook.) After all, I am a woman too,
and there is no wav in hell I would

sponsor a project if it were to create
"women's problems," as Shaeffer
phrases it.
Believe me, Stanford women have
enough to worry about: tuition, get
ting into graduate school and Stanford
men's problems, to name a few. We
don't need to spend time emulating
our fellow students when we are
confident enough to act on our own.

Calendar column
missed the point
Those of you who haven't read
Scott Shaeffer's column in Thursday's

Daily (Oct. 9) really missed out on a
good laugh.
Shaeffer's beef is with the creators
of the calendar and the 12 gals who
agreed to be photographed for this
endeavor.
Allow me to quote from the article.
"Stereotypes affect an individual's
physical health, mental health, behav
ior and self-concept."
"The continued production and
purchase of things like this calendar
are directly linked to bulemia,
anorexia, depression, low self-esteem,
suicide, low intellectual growth, poor
personal relationships and much
more."
Much more? Gee. So that's why all

these nasty problems keep plaguing
mankind and in particular the stu
dents of Stanford.
But Shaeffer doesn't stop there. He
goes on to say that "It is also not
surprising that this calendar exists at a
school at which our being allowed to
attend is for the most pan highly
dependent on the success of our
parents. Beauty, therefore, is a bit like
our current financial status in that it is
an inherited wealth and provides a
false sense of accomplishment."
I'm still reeling from that one. I
guess all those grades and test scores
weren't so important after all.
Come on, Shaeffer. That poor little
calendar isn't that horrible. If you're
so "insulted" by it, why don't you just
walk away from it?

Calendar doesn't
offend women;
column does
In response to Scott Shaeffer's
column (Daily, Oct. 9) which so
bravely and thoughtfully championed
the cause of the abused Stanford
woman driven to suicide by said
diabolical calendar: Lighten up. Lest
you think we are of the oppressive
sex, we're women. And to tell the
truth, it wasn't the calendar we found
offensive — it was die column.

Besides Mr. Shaeffer's massive
generalizations, there are two things
which made us particularly angry
about the article.
The first is, we resent his thinking
that we are so insecure and have such
fragile egos and low self-esteem that
looking at a dozen gorgeous girls
would send us screaming to aerobics
classes and razor blades. Mr. Shaeffer
says that the calendar is "directly
linked to bulemia, anorexia, depres
sion, low self esteem, suicide, low
intellectual growth, poor personal
relationships and much more." The
"much more" perplexes us. What
could he have skipped? Nervous
breakdowns? It is demeaning that Mr.
Shaeffer gives Stanford women so
little credit.
Maybe Mr. Shaeffer overdramatized
his column to make a point, but his
attack on the girls who posed for the
calendar was completely out of line.
He makes them sound like a bunch of
vapid, shallow exhibitionists who are
turning the rest of us into miserable
neurotics. In suggesting this, he is
being unfair to both groups — the
girls who weren't in the calendar and
the girls who were. Now, this may be
sick, this may stem from some sub
liminal desire to be one-dimensional
and superficial, but if someone said
"You're beautiful, please be in our
calendar," we think many Stanford
women would be flattered. The girls
didn't model because they are excess
ively vain megalomaniacs. They did it
for fun.
Please don't misunderstand us. We
aren't trying to champion the calen
dar. We don't think it's the best thing
that ever happened to Stanford, but
we also don't think it is the epitome of
pornography and superficiality that
Mr. Shaeffer claims. By writing this
letter we are probably sustaining an
issue that should never have existed,
but we felt that the injustice of the
attack deserved a response.
