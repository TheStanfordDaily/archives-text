# Robertson must be taken seriously
## 
### 
Pat Robertson wants to be president, make no
mistake. Wishy-washy political wannabees don't rent
Constitution Hall in Washington to announce their
intentions, as Pat did.
Neither do simple country preachers.
This guy means business, and he has plenty of re
sources to match his audacity.

Robertson owns his own satellite cable TV network
that can reach millions of people. He's already col
lected the endorsement of several other evangelists,
including rock-and-roller-turned-holy-roller Jimmy
Swaggert. Most important, Robertson has mastered
what Ronald Reagan has shown to be the con
summate political skill of our time — using the
media well.
On Sept. 17, in the most heavily promoted partial
announcement in recent memory, Robertson vowed
he would run for president if three million people
signed petitions supporting him. By half-announcing,
Robertson can continue to host his religious talk
show, "The "00 Club. As a formally declared candi
date, he would forfeit that privilege
But lest we doubt his sincerity, Mr. Robertson has
assured us that "1 know God's will for me." Clearly,
Pat Robertson is a man who takes himself very
seriously. But how should we take him?
Until recently, most educated people treated the
religious right more or less as a joke — wisecracking
as they flipped past the television preachers in search
of a good ballgame. At least that's tlie way it was in my
house. We lumped the Jerry Falwells together with
the Moonies and the Baghwans as "religious
curiosities and promptly forgot about them.

But now America is faced with a card-carry nig reli
gious fanatic who claims he converses with God,
heals people over the phone, proclaims prophecies,
and influences the weather. In his autobiography,
Robertson records a conversation in which God spoke
to him and said, "Pat, I want you to have an RCA trans
mitter." More recently, Robertson prayed on televi
sion to divert hurricane Gloria from his studio in Vir
ginia.
I'll be the first to admit, it's hard to take a guy like
that seriously. Yet that is exactly what we must do. To
dismiss the Robertson campaign as a "political
curiosity" would be a grave mistake.
The 1988 presidential election marks the full
throttle entrance of religious fundamentalism into
American politics. Already this fall evangelical candi
dates are on the ballot for major offices in more than
a dozen states. How we choose to regard the
Robertson candidacy could affect the political
landscape for years to come.
Traditionally, the press in America has maintained
a healthy skepticism about the role of religion in
politics, while carefully trying to separate the two.
When Jimmy Carter professed to be a born-again
Christian, the reception he got from the press and
public was less than enthusiastic. John Kennedy
repeatedly had to assure the public that his Roman
Catholicism would not interfere with his perfor
mance as president.
Both men were asked to separate their religious
convictions from their political beliefs, and then to
stand for public judgment on the merits of the latter.
Just because this time around a candidate is
wearing his religion on his sleeve is no reason for
the press, or the public, to apply any different criteria
in assessing him
Robertson's unusual background should not
garner him any special status in this campaign. He
must be subjected to the same scrutiny and be held
accountable to the same standards of reason and
common sense we reserve for all other candidates.

Pat Robertson has chosen to make religion an
issue in his election bid. And if his zeal leads him to
say outlandish or offensive things — such as his
claim that Christians are more patriotic and familv
oriented than non-Christians — then those state
ments should of course be covered as straight news.
But just as we cannot afford to downplay
Robertson's often incredible religious pronounce
ments, we must be careful not to accept religious
rhetoric as a substitute for substantive debate on
other issues.
We all know that religion is a touchy subject that
elicits strong reactions from people, and that such
subjects can sometimes generate feverish excitement
on a national scale. One need look no further than
the current "drug epidemic" to see how easily
Americans — especially politicians — can lose their
heads on issues with moral implications. This fall
members of both parties fell all over themselves in
the scramble to be on the "right" side of the drug
issue.
Americans are at least as excitable about religion
as they are about drugs. Before long, politicians may
be scrambling like crazy to get on the "right" side of
the religion isue. Herein lies the real danger of
mixing religion and politics — especially when the
religion in question is one of the most intolerant
ones around, Christianity.
Pat Robertson has already suggested that Christians
make better patriots than non-Christians. Once
something as personal and supposedly private as
one's relgious belief becomes a yardstick for deter
mining how good a citizen someone is, then the
problem is no longer just intolerance, it is institution
alized intolerance.
Pat Robertson may be a religious figure in a politi
cal campaign, but he must not be allowed to turn that
campaign into a religious crusade.

But now America is faced with a card-carry nig reli
gious fanatic who claims he converses with God,
heals people over the phone, proclaims prophecies,
and influences the weather. In his autobiography,
Robertson records a conversation in which God spoke
to him and said, "Pat, I want you to have an RCA trans
mitter." More recently, Robertson prayed on televi
sion to divert hurricane Gloria from his studio in Vir
ginia.
I'll be the first to admit, it's hard to take a guy like
that seriously. Yet that is exactly what we must do. To
dismiss the Robertson campaign as a "political
curiosity" would be a grave mistake.
The 1988 presidential election marks the full
throttle entrance of religious fundamentalism into
American politics. Already this fall evangelical candi
dates are on the ballot for major offices in more than
a dozen states. How we choose to regard the
Robertson candidacy could affect the political
landscape for years to come.
Traditionally, the press in America has maintained
a healthy skepticism about the role of religion in
politics, while carefully trying to separate the two.
When Jimmy Carter professed to be a born-again
Christian, the reception he got from the press and
public was less than enthusiastic. John Kennedy
repeatedly had to assure the public that his Roman
Catholicism would not interfere with his perfor
mance as president.
Both men were asked to separate their religious
convictions from their political beliefs, and then to
stand for public judgment on the merits of the latter.
Just because this time around a candidate is
wearing his religion on his sleeve is no reason for
the press, or the public, to apply any different criteria
in assessing him
Robertson's unusual background should not
garner him any special status in this campaign. He
must be subjected to the same scrutiny and be held
accountable to the same standards of reason and
common sense we reserve for all other candidates.

Pat Robertson has chosen to make religion an
issue in his election bid. And if his zeal leads him to
say outlandish or offensive things — such as his
claim that Christians are more patriotic and familv
oriented than non-Christians — then those state
ments should of course be covered as straight news.
But just as we cannot afford to downplay
Robertson's often incredible religious pronounce
ments, we must be careful not to accept religious
rhetoric as a substitute for substantive debate on
other issues.
We all know that religion is a touchy subject that
elicits strong reactions from people, and that such
subjects can sometimes generate feverish excitement
on a national scale. One need look no further than
the current "drug epidemic" to see how easily
Americans — especially politicians — can lose their
heads on issues with moral implications. This fall
members of both parties fell all over themselves in
the scramble to be on the "right" side of the drug
issue.
Americans are at least as excitable about religion
as they are about drugs. Before long, politicians may
be scrambling like crazy to get on the "right" side of
the religion isue. Herein lies the real danger of
mixing religion and politics — especially when the
religion in question is one of the most intolerant
ones around, Christianity.
Pat Robertson has already suggested that Christians
make better patriots than non-Christians. Once
something as personal and supposedly private as
one's relgious belief becomes a yardstick for deter
mining how good a citizen someone is, then the
problem is no longer just intolerance, it is institution
alized intolerance.
Pat Robertson may be a religious figure in a politi
cal campaign, but he must not be allowed to turn that
campaign into a religious crusade.

Pat Robertson wants to be president, make no
mistake. Wishy-washy political wannabees don't rent
Constitution Hall in Washington to announce their
intentions, as Pat did.
Neither do simple country preachers.
This guy means business, and he has plenty of re
sources to match his audacity.

Robertson owns his own satellite cable TV network
that can reach millions of people. He's already col
lected the endorsement of several other evangelists,
including rock-and-roller-turned-holy-roller Jimmy
Swaggert. Most important, Robertson has mastered
what Ronald Reagan has shown to be the con
summate political skill of our time — using the
media well.
On Sept. 17, in the most heavily promoted partial
announcement in recent memory, Robertson vowed
he would run for president if three million people
signed petitions supporting him. By half-announcing,
Robertson can continue to host his religious talk
show, "The "00 Club. As a formally declared candi
date, he would forfeit that privilege
But lest we doubt his sincerity, Mr. Robertson has
assured us that "1 know God's will for me." Clearly,
Pat Robertson is a man who takes himself very
seriously. But how should we take him?
Until recently, most educated people treated the
religious right more or less as a joke — wisecracking
as they flipped past the television preachers in search
of a good ballgame. At least that's tlie way it was in my
house. We lumped the Jerry Falwells together with
the Moonies and the Baghwans as "religious
curiosities and promptly forgot about them.

But now America is faced with a card-carry nig reli
gious fanatic who claims he converses with God,
heals people over the phone, proclaims prophecies,
and influences the weather. In his autobiography,
Robertson records a conversation in which God spoke
