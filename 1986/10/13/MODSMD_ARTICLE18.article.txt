# Take advantage of office hours
## 
### 
A good friend of mine who just
returned from overseas has found that
he has the "no-motivation blues." The
classes seem interesting, the profes
sors are great — everything is wonder
ful except that my friend just can't get
psyched. My immediate response was
this: "Go talk to the prof, and find out
why the material should be interesting
to anyone at all." He looked at me a bit
bewildered. "Office hours?" he
proclaimed, aghast at the mere possi
bility of one-on-one confrontation.
"But I've never been to office hours."

JEFF WEXLER

"Look,"' I said, "I went to office
hours for almost every class I had. You
don't have to kiss up, you can just go
and talk and eventually you get
psyched about the class."
As a freshman 1 was told that all Stan
ford professors are required to keep
office hours. So, hating Western Cul
ture, I went to my section leader's of
fice hours. "Ms. Gardiner," I said, "I
hate history. Why bother? This is
worthless and I hate it." (Being the ma
ture frosh that I was, I was being very
diplomatic and objective.) We spent
the next hour talking about everything
but Western Culture. I just got to know
this woman and why she cared about
this material. Her reasons were pretty
good, so I gave it a shot.
Junior year brought me into a law
school class, with a law school profes
sor and law school expectations. My
professor was (and still is) regarded as
the finest in his field — the term "god"
is often used in conjunction with his
name. I had some big questions, so I
took a few minutes to organize my
thoughts on paper, made an appoint
ment and headed to his office. While
we chatted, Prof. (Marc) Franklin con
ferred with his assistant, then took a
call from a reporter at The New York
Times regarding the Ariel Sharon case.
Yet he never ignored me. I charged
right through my list of questions
(having read the cases, I cited text) and

he Mped me find the answers. 1 em
phasize "helped" because those office
hours gave me the confidence — along
with some study hints — to do well in
the class.
Then came senior year and distribu
tion requirement area two. On recom
mendation I signed up for an art class.
Having been graced with no artisitic
ability 1 was more than a bit nervous.
So I went for office hours and discov
ered a professor whose love for the
material was unavoidably contagious. 1
still can't remember if Cleobis and
Biton are didalic or geometric — just
kidding, Prof. (Jody) Maxmin — but 1
did pass the class and become the an
cient Greek art expert as 1 travelled
through the museums of Europe.
My office hours stories are
numerous and almost all positive. And
why shouldn't they be — Stanford
profs, are some of the best people in
the world, and a chat with a Stanford
prof, is something special indeed.
On a practical note, remember that
the only way to do well in a class is to
enjoy it. If you can do that naturally,
then skip the rest of this column. But if
you find yourself a little bored or a
little sluggish come assignment or
lecture time, then try office hours. If
you can't make the scheduled hours,
make an appointment.
I probably sound like a hard-core
red-hot, but believe me, I was anything
but. I had better things to do than
struggle through classes, so I found a
way to get into them
1 would bet my diploma that the
profs, who find you at their doors
won't be annoyed by your interest. If
anything, they have to respect it. At
least you're giving it a shot, right?
1 don't know if my friend will take
my advice. But to the rest of you, espe
cially the freshmen, I say: Get into the
office hour habit this week, before
midterms hit. You and your GPA will
be glad you did.

material was unavoidably contagious. 1
still can't remember if Cleobis and
Biton are didalic or geometric — just
kidding, Prof. (Jody) Maxmin — but 1
did pass the class and become the an
cient Greek art expert as 1 travelled
through the museums of Europe.
My office hours stories are
numerous and almost all positive. And
why shouldn't they be — Stanford
profs, are some of the best people in
the world, and a chat with a Stanford
prof, is something special indeed.
On a practical note, remember that
the only way to do well in a class is to
enjoy it. If you can do that naturally,
then skip the rest of this column. But if
you find yourself a little bored or a
little sluggish come assignment or
lecture time, then try office hours. If
you can't make the scheduled hours,
make an appointment.
I probably sound like a hard-core
red-hot, but believe me, I was anything
but. I had better things to do than
struggle through classes, so I found a
way to get into them
1 would bet my diploma that the
profs, who find you at their doors
won't be annoyed by your interest. If
anything, they have to respect it. At
least you're giving it a shot, right?
1 don't know if my friend will take
my advice. But to the rest of you, espe
cially the freshmen, I say: Get into the
office hour habit this week, before
midterms hit. You and your GPA will
be glad you did.
