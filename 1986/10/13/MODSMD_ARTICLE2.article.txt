# Card close, but loses to Huskies
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Take the would'ves, should'ves, could'ves, mix in all the
its, and the Stanford Cardinal comes out of Saturday's game
against Washington still undefeated and in the driver's seat
in the Pacific 10 Conference race.
Unfortunately, the 18th-ranked Cardinal couldn't get a
field goal or touchdown when it needed one, and the 12th
ranked Huskies handed Stanford a 24-14 loss in front of
52,000 at Stanford Stadium and a national cable television
audience.
With the defeat, Stanford falls to 4-1 overall, 1-1 in the Pac
-10, and lost an opportunity to remain the only undefeated
and untied team in the conference. For two hours following
USC's 37-17 loss to Washington State on Saturday, the Card
inal was all alone in first place in the Pac-10.
Trailing 17-14 midway through the third quarter, the
Cardinal offense gave kicker David Sweeney two chances to
tie the game, but Sweeney missed a 40-yard kick wide right
and then a 39-yarder wide left.
The Cardinal came back again though, and behind quar
terback John Paye, who passed for 364 yards and two touch
downs on the day, and tailback Kevin Scott, Stanford drove
to the Washington 5.
Then, facing a fourth-and-one, Stanford Coach Jack Elway
kept Sweeney on the sideline and elected to go for the
touchdown.
"We thought about tying it up," Elway said, "but we
decided to go for the win. We made the call, and it didn't
wo. k We'd missed two field goals, so we thought we'd go
get it, and we didn't get it."
So, with 5:36 to play, Paye faked the 49 Sweep left and
bootlegged right on the 349 Sucker play. Husky linebacker
Bo Yates stayed home though, taking away the run option.
Paye then looked for tight end Eric Snelson dragging over
the middle, but threw high and was intercepted by corner
back Tony Zackery.
"Obviously, that was the turning point, down in tight," El
way said.
The Huskies then mounted a four-minute drive against a
disheartened Stanford defense, with fullback Rick Fenney
scoring from nine yards out to put the game out of reach.

linebacker Chris Weber said. "Missing two field goals and
then you don t score again. In the back of your mind you
start wondering what do we have to do. It was frustrating."
The loss overshadowed a spirited effort by a Stanford
team that had won its first four games for the first time since
1952. Many had questioned the Cardinal's credentials in
cracking the top 20, but there were few who doubted at the
end.
If they don t believe in our team now, they won't at the
end of the season, said Weber, who was third on the team
in tackles with 10. "We believe in ourselves. We proved a
lot of things to ourselves today. We're upset ourselves now,
but when we look at the film, I think we'll feel a lot better.
We lost on the scoreboard, but we won on the field.
They 11 know it tomorrow — they're probably pretty sore.
They're probably pretty happy now — they beat a pretty
good football team."
"To me, there was never any doubt we could win this
game," said wide receiver Jeff James, who returned to action
after missing two games, and caught six passes for 84 yards
and a touchdown. "That's why it's so difficult to shake it off.
We knew at what level we had to play, and we played at that
level today."
The Cardinal offense had been latent the two weeks
before, but Saturday James returned to action and Paye
simply exploded. The senior quarterback completed 28 of
47 passes for 364 yards and two touchdowns — his third
best game ever. His prime receiver was running back Brad
Muster, who was held to only 11 yards rushing, but caught
11 passes for 129 yards.
The Cardinal stalled on its first drive of the game, but got
its first break when Andre Riley fumbled Doug Robison's
punt, and Mike Noble recovered for Stanford at the Wash
ington 39. Following a sack, Paye hit wide receiver Thomas
Henley for a 20-yard gain on third-and-21, but Muster was
stopped at the Husky 30 for no gain on fourth down.
On Stanford's next possession, Paye hit Muster on a 29-
yard fly pattern over the middle, then found Snelson in the
end zone on a seam pattern to cap an eight-play, 71-yard
drive and give the Cardinal a 7-0 lead with 7:39 left in the
first quarter.
The Huskies came back to drive 58 yards to the Stanford
14, but Jeff Jaeger missed a 32-yard field goal try wide right.
Jaeger is the most accurate kicker in the NCAA, hitting 82
percent of his attempts, and hadn't missed inside of 50 yards
this season.
Washington tailback Vince Weathersby opened the Husky
drive with a 33-yard run around the right side, and Chandler
capped the 12-play, 80-yard drive by finding Fenney wide
open on the left side to tie it at 7-7.
After a Sweeney punt was downed at the Washington 2
and the Cardinal defense stopped Washington, the Cardinal
went 55 yards on six plays to take a 14-7 lead. A 17-yard pass
to Henley and a 21-yarder to Scott set up a 19-yard scoring
strike to James with 1:47 left in the half.
"I was supposed to run a fly route," James said, "but the
flow was going right, so I ran to the side John was scram
bling to. That was a great throw — he rolled right, then
threw across his body left. There aren't many quarterbacks
who can make that play."
Husky quarterback Chris Chandler then brought Wash
ington back, with key completions to wide receivers Daryl
Franklin and Lonzell Hill to reach the Stanford 18.
On third-and-10, though, Chandler scrambled left, then
turned into defensive tackle Lester Archambeau, who ap

plied a devestating hit. The seven-yard sack brought on
Jaeger, who connected from 42 yards to make the halftime
score 14-10.
After the teams exchanged punts to start the second half,
Chandler gave the Huskies the lead when he hit Hill on a 42-
yard bomb down the right sideline to make it 17-14 with
4:02 left in the third quarter. Hill was working against cor
nerback Pat Kelly, who had good coverage but was just a
step behind when Chandler delivered the perfect pass. Kelly
was starting his first game in place of the injured Toi Cook.
Scott returned the ensuing kickoff 34 yards to the Stan
ford 41, and Paye took the Cardinal 36 more yards to the

Washington 23, but Sweeney missed his first three-point try
wide right.
On its next possession, Stanford went 50 yards to the
Washington 22, widi Muster making a spectacular leaping
catch between two defenders for a 27-yard gain early in the
drive, but Sweeney again was wide of the mark.
Sweeney was so upset that he threw his helmet across the
locker room after the game — and accidently hit Snelson in
the head. Three stitches were needed to close the gash.
The Cardinal defense then stopped Washington on a
fourth-and-nine at the Stanford 33, and the Cardinal took

over with 8:34 to play. An 18-yard pass to Muster and a 14-
yard reverse run by Scott took the ball into Husky territory.
On a third-and-14 from the 38, Paye hit James for a 24-yard
gain and the first down.
Scon went eight yards again on a reverse to the 6. Then
Paye just missed James on a timing pattern to the left corner
of the end zone. Muster got one yard on third-and-two, and
then Elway chose not to play for the tie.
"It was a*tough loss," Elway said. "This football team was
so close to getting it. They have nothing to be ashamed of.
Washington's a fine football team."


Star Washington receiver Lonzell Hill caused the Stanford defense problems all day
last weekend, catching nine passes for 137 yards including a 42 yard touchdown recep-

managed to bring down the speedy senior on this play however.
