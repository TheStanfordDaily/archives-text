Take the would'ves, should'ves, could'ves, mix in all the
its, and the Stanford Cardinal comes out of Saturday's game
against Washington still undefeated and in the driver's seat
in the Pacific 10 Conference race.
Unfortunately, the 18th-ranked Cardinal couldn't get a
field goal or touchdown when it needed one, and the 12th
ranked Huskies handed Stanford a 24-14 loss in front of
52,000 at Stanford Stadium and a national cable television
audience.
With the defeat, Stanford falls to 4-1 overall, 1-1 in the Pac
-10, and lost an opportunity to remain the only undefeated
and untied team in the conference. For two hours following
USC's 37-17 loss to Washington State on Saturday, the Card
inal was all alone in first place in the Pac-10.
Trailing 17-14 midway through the third quarter, the
Cardinal offense gave kicker David Sweeney two chances to
tie the game, but Sweeney missed a 40-yard kick wide right
and then a 39-yarder wide left.
The Cardinal came back again though, and behind quar
terback John Paye, who passed for 364 yards and two touch
downs on the day, and tailback Kevin Scott, Stanford drove
to the Washington 5.
Then, facing a fourth-and-one, Stanford Coach Jack Elway
kept Sweeney on the sideline and elected to go for the
touchdown.
"We thought about tying it up," Elway said, "but we
decided to go for the win. We made the call, and it didn't
wo. k We'd missed two field goals, so we thought we'd go
get it, and we didn't get it."
So, with 5:36 to play, Paye faked the 49 Sweep left and
bootlegged right on the 349 Sucker play. Husky linebacker
Bo Yates stayed home though, taking away the run option.
Paye then looked for tight end Eric Snelson dragging over
the middle, but threw high and was intercepted by corner
back Tony Zackery.
"Obviously, that was the turning point, down in tight," El
way said.
The Huskies then mounted a four-minute drive against a
disheartened Stanford defense, with fullback Rick Fenney
scoring from nine yards out to put the game out of reach.
