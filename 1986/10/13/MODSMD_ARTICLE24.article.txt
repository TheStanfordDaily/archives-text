## What a long strange trip it will be 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM 
A formula for adventure: add travel,
foreign languages, danger, wilderness,
amazing sights and great physical chal
lenge. Multiply by nine months and en
ter the result into the appropriate sec
tion of the Guiness Book Of World
Records.
The creators of this exotic formula,
Bret Andersen, Martin Engel, Ann
Knabe and Dan Buettner, had all of the
above in mind on Aug. 8 when they
mounted their bikes to begin pedaling
on what would become an approxi
mately 18,000-mile bike trek from
Prudhoe Bay, Alaska — the north
ernmost point of North America ac
cessible by road — through North,
Central and South America to Tierra
Del Fuego, the southernmost tip of
South America. When they reach the
end of their journey in April, they will
become the first people to have
traversed the continents completely on
bicycles.
The theme of the trip is "Amity
Among Nations."
"I truly believe that friendship
among nations begins with friendship
among individuals," said Buettner, or
ganizer of the trek. "People tend to
judge a country by individuals they
know from that country or from what
the media tells them. Folks take at least
a cautious interest in you when you're
doing something this insane — it's a
great opportunity to get to know
them."
Anderson, Engel and Buettner met
in high school in Minnesota and Knabe
met Engel at the University of Minne
sota Medical School. All four found
they shared interests in biking, Spanish
culture and language, and adventure.
"It just seemed like the bike trek was a
natural culmination of all our inter

ests," commented Buettner.
Preparation for the trip began more
than a year ago when the four bikers
began sending letters to presidents,
vice presidents and ambassadors of the
countries they would traverse. They
also wrote to companies asking for
supplies and support. As a result, their
equipment was donated and they were
personally invited into Colombia and
Guatemala by those nations' presi
dents. And in Chile and Nicaragua they
will receive special diplomatic treat
ment.
Additionally, the four were invited to
participate in an Expo '86 exhibit in
Vancouver. Due to delays, they arrived
two weeks late and missed the exhibit;
however, they did manage to get a VIP
tour of the U.S. Pavilion as some com
pensation.
At the beginning of the trek, there
was no support van, and for the first
300 miles the cyclists had to pack 30 to
40 pounds of equipment on their 30-
pound bikes. Thus loaded, they would
bike their average 100-120 miles per
day across the Alaskan tundra, battling
high winds, steep hills and gravel.
The support van did eventually
come, and now they cycle free of
equipment. However, somewhere in
Mexico (they are not yet certain
where) they will lose their van and
again have to pack their bikes. And if
this were not enough, between
Panama and Colombia at the Darier
Gap, they will need to break down the
bikes themselves in order to walk
across.
To train for the trek, all four partici
pated in marathons and triathalons as
well as in skiing, swimming and, of
course, biking. But, said Buettner, "An
18,000-mile bike trek is not something

eventually take them to Tierra Del Fuego.
