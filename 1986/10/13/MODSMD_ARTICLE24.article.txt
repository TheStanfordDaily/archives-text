## What a long strange trip it will be 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM 
A formula for adventure: add travel,
foreign languages, danger, wilderness,
amazing sights and great physical chal
lenge. Multiply by nine months and en
ter the result into the appropriate sec
tion of the Guiness Book Of World
Records.
The creators of this exotic formula,
Bret Andersen, Martin Engel, Ann
Knabe and Dan Buettner, had all of the
above in mind on Aug. 8 when they
mounted their bikes to begin pedaling
on what would become an approxi
mately 18,000-mile bike trek from
Prudhoe Bay, Alaska — the north
ernmost point of North America ac
cessible by road — through North,
Central and South America to Tierra
Del Fuego, the southernmost tip of
South America. When they reach the
end of their journey in April, they will
become the first people to have
traversed the continents completely on
bicycles.
The theme of the trip is "Amity
Among Nations."
"I truly believe that friendship
among nations begins with friendship
among individuals," said Buettner, or
ganizer of the trek. "People tend to
judge a country by individuals they
know from that country or from what
the media tells them. Folks take at least
a cautious interest in you when you're
doing something this insane — it's a
great opportunity to get to know
them."
Anderson, Engel and Buettner met
in high school in Minnesota and Knabe
met Engel at the University of Minne
sota Medical School. All four found
they shared interests in biking, Spanish
culture and language, and adventure.
"It just seemed like the bike trek was a
natural culmination of all our inter

ests," commented Buettner.
Preparation for the trip began more
than a year ago when the four bikers
began sending letters to presidents,
vice presidents and ambassadors of the
countries they would traverse. They
also wrote to companies asking for
supplies and support. As a result, their
equipment was donated and they were
personally invited into Colombia and
Guatemala by those nations' presi
dents. And in Chile and Nicaragua they
will receive special diplomatic treat
ment.
Additionally, the four were invited to
participate in an Expo '86 exhibit in
Vancouver. Due to delays, they arrived
two weeks late and missed the exhibit;
however, they did manage to get a VIP
tour of the U.S. Pavilion as some com
pensation.
At the beginning of the trek, there
was no support van, and for the first
300 miles the cyclists had to pack 30 to
40 pounds of equipment on their 30-
pound bikes. Thus loaded, they would
bike their average 100-120 miles per
day across the Alaskan tundra, battling
high winds, steep hills and gravel.
The support van did eventually
come, and now they cycle free of
equipment. However, somewhere in
Mexico (they are not yet certain
where) they will lose their van and
again have to pack their bikes. And if
this were not enough, between
Panama and Colombia at the Darier
Gap, they will need to break down the
bikes themselves in order to walk
across.
To train for the trek, all four partici
pated in marathons and triathalons as
well as in skiing, swimming and, of
course, biking. But, said Buettner, "An
18,000-mile bike trek is not something

you can train for. It's something you
either have the physical propensity to
do or you don't do it."
The group's pattern is to bike for
five to six days, camping out in tents at
night, and then to rest for a few days
before starting again. During their rest
periods they have visited cities such as
Fairbanks, Vancouver, Portland, Seattle
and San Fransisco, as well as other
points of interest.
The highlight of the trip thus far,
they agree, came along a small mining
road in British Columbia where they
saw an absolutely spectacular glacier.
"It was an amazing glacier,'' re
ported Knabe. "I've never seen any
thing so huge." Engel added: "It was a
perfect day, too."
On the road, the intrepid bikers
have met many varied people. But
what does not vary is the response of
these people to the bikers, described
by Buettner as "uniformly positive."
"Only our relatives give us negative

input," joked Engel. Anderson added:
"Some motorists give negative input
from behind."
"I've been impressed by the
hospitality we've received from total
strangers," commented Engel. "People
just open their doors to us. ...
Sometimes when you really need it,
people show up with the best
hospitality."
As they pedal along the continent,
the bicyclists converse only when the
road is wide. Otherwise they spend

their time thinking, watching the
scenery or listening to Walkmans.
"Sometimes it's nice too, not to be able
to talk to people," Engel said, explain
ing that this small group is together all
day, every day, on the road. "Being on
a bike gives you some personal time.
After this great adventure, Knabe
and Engel will return to medical
school, and Anderson plans to attend
Stanford next year in the MBA pro
gram.
"It will be hard to return to the

structured life of school after living
like we have been for a year," said
Knabe. "I've enjoyed the travel."
"Anyone can do this," he advised.
"Age makes no difference. If you want
to go travel or experience new things,
just go do it."
"There's no real barrier to doing it,"
Engel added. "You just have to have
the guts to get out there and do it."
Excitement, apprehension over the
unknown and the lure of the foreign
fill the bicyclists' minds as they ride
south for the remaining three-quarters
of their trip. Although they have no
definite route, they do plan to take the
Pan American highway from Mexico to
South America.
Getting home is still a question
mark. Buses and hitch-hiking were
mentioned as means of transport back
from the tip of Argentina. Or, said
Buettner, "If worse comes to worse,
we'll bike back to Buenos Aires." But
not all the way home.
For more information about the ad
venture, the bikers will present a slide
show of their journey tomorrow at 8
p.m. in the Bechtel International Cen
ter.

and Engel will return to medical
school, and Anderson plans to attend
Stanford next year in the MBA pro
gram.
"It will be hard to return to the

structured life of school after living
like we have been for a year," said
Knabe. "I've enjoyed the travel."
"Anyone can do this," he advised.
"Age makes no difference. If you want
to go travel or experience new things,
just go do it."
"There's no real barrier to doing it,"
Engel added. "You just have to have
the guts to get out there and do it."
Excitement, apprehension over the
unknown and the lure of the foreign
fill the bicyclists' minds as they ride
south for the remaining three-quarters
of their trip. Although they have no
definite route, they do plan to take the
Pan American highway from Mexico to
South America.
Getting home is still a question
mark. Buses and hitch-hiking were
mentioned as means of transport back
from the tip of Argentina. Or, said
Buettner, "If worse comes to worse,
we'll bike back to Buenos Aires." But
not all the way home.
For more information about the ad
venture, the bikers will present a slide
show of their journey tomorrow at 8
p.m. in the Bechtel International Cen
ter.

A formula for adventure: add travel,
foreign languages, danger, wilderness,
amazing sights and great physical chal
lenge. Multiply by nine months and en
ter the result into the appropriate sec
tion of the Guiness Book Of World
Records.
The creators of this exotic formula,
Bret Andersen, Martin Engel, Ann
Knabe and Dan Buettner, had all of the
above in mind on Aug. 8 when they
mounted their bikes to begin pedaling
on what would become an approxi
mately 18,000-mile bike trek from
Prudhoe Bay, Alaska — the north
ernmost point of North America ac
cessible by road — through North,
Central and South America to Tierra
Del Fuego, the southernmost tip of
South America. When they reach the
end of their journey in April, they will
become the first people to have
traversed the continents completely on
bicycles.
The theme of the trip is "Amity
Among Nations."
"I truly believe that friendship
among nations begins with friendship
among individuals," said Buettner, or
ganizer of the trek. "People tend to
judge a country by individuals they
know from that country or from what
the media tells them. Folks take at least
a cautious interest in you when you're
doing something this insane — it's a
great opportunity to get to know
them."
Anderson, Engel and Buettner met
in high school in Minnesota and Knabe
met Engel at the University of Minne
sota Medical School. All four found
they shared interests in biking, Spanish
culture and language, and adventure.
"It just seemed like the bike trek was a
natural culmination of all our inter

ests," commented Buettner.
Preparation for the trip began more
than a year ago when the four bikers
began sending letters to presidents,
vice presidents and ambassadors of the
countries they would traverse. They
also wrote to companies asking for
supplies and support. As a result, their
equipment was donated and they were
personally invited into Colombia and
Guatemala by those nations' presi
dents. And in Chile and Nicaragua they
will receive special diplomatic treat
ment.
Additionally, the four were invited to
participate in an Expo '86 exhibit in
Vancouver. Due to delays, they arrived
two weeks late and missed the exhibit;
however, they did manage to get a VIP
tour of the U.S. Pavilion as some com
pensation.
At the beginning of the trek, there
was no support van, and for the first
300 miles the cyclists had to pack 30 to
40 pounds of equipment on their 30-
pound bikes. Thus loaded, they would
bike their average 100-120 miles per
day across the Alaskan tundra, battling
high winds, steep hills and gravel.
The support van did eventually
come, and now they cycle free of
equipment. However, somewhere in
Mexico (they are not yet certain
where) they will lose their van and
again have to pack their bikes. And if
this were not enough, between
Panama and Colombia at the Darier
Gap, they will need to break down the
bikes themselves in order to walk
across.
To train for the trek, all four partici
pated in marathons and triathalons as
well as in skiing, swimming and, of
course, biking. But, said Buettner, "An
18,000-mile bike trek is not something

you can train for. It's something you
either have the physical propensity to
do or you don't do it."
The group's pattern is to bike for
five to six days, camping out in tents at
night, and then to rest for a few days
before starting again. During their rest
periods they have visited cities such as
Fairbanks, Vancouver, Portland, Seattle
and San Fransisco, as well as other
points of interest.
The highlight of the trip thus far,
they agree, came along a small mining
road in British Columbia where they
saw an absolutely spectacular glacier.
"It was an amazing glacier,'' re
ported Knabe. "I've never seen any
thing so huge." Engel added: "It was a
perfect day, too."
On the road, the intrepid bikers
have met many varied people. But
what does not vary is the response of
these people to the bikers, described
by Buettner as "uniformly positive."
"Only our relatives give us negative

input," joked Engel. Anderson added:
"Some motorists give negative input
from behind."
"I've been impressed by the
hospitality we've received from total
strangers," commented Engel. "People
just open their doors to us. ...
Sometimes when you really need it,
people show up with the best
hospitality."
As they pedal along the continent,
the bicyclists converse only when the
road is wide. Otherwise they spend

their time thinking, watching the
scenery or listening to Walkmans.
"Sometimes it's nice too, not to be able
to talk to people," Engel said, explain
ing that this small group is together all
day, every day, on the road. "Being on
a bike gives you some personal time.
