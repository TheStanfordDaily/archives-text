# What became of the DUs' house?

### PAULINA CHEN 
"What's going on behind those pink curtains?" is a
question frequently asked as people pass the
residence at 553 Mayfield. Formerly the home of the
Delta Upsilon fraternity, the address now belongs to
a regular co-ed row house opened in the wake of the
fraternity's removal from campus last spring. The
house, temporarily being called "553 Mayfield," is
still undergoing repairs, but the pink curtains are a
sign of the extensive repairs and improvements that
have already taken place at the house.
Row Facilities Manager Lucy Williams says that al
though the bills for the ongoing repairs have not
been received yet, costs for the refurbishment will
exceed the originally estimated $125,000 figure. Of
that amount, Delta Upsilon was billed for $20,000, or
about $500 per fraternity member.
"Since then we have discovered more (damages
caused by Delta Upsilon), but because we already
billed them, their portion of the cost will not be in
creased," says Williams, adding that it is generally a
policy to estimate low on damage costs to make it
financially easier on the students.
Among the repairs and improvements are a com
plete washdown of the house, the replacing and
repainting of wall panels, repair of electrical fixtures
and removal of the bar, as well as the installation of
new pink curtains, new carpets in some of the rooms
and new furniture (including solid oak tables in the
dining rooms).
"We had to be especially creative in transforming
the bathrooms," says Williams. "The people (living)

there (now) seem to be very proud of the house."
"Beautiful is how Chip Atterbury, the resident as
sistant of 553 Mayfield, describes his new home. At
terbury, a senior, has had previous experience as an
RAin a Row House.

'We had to be especially
creative in transforming
the bathrooms.'

Atterbury considers his responsibilities at 553
Mayfield to include "programming" activities, "being
there for the people," "helping people find things on
their own,'' and "making life here more
pleasurable."
The residents of 553 Mayfield feel that the most
unique aspect of the house is the composition of its
population. Of the 38 residents, all of whom wait
listed into the house over the summer, 27 are sopho
mores and eight are transfers. Approximately half the
residents are women.

Chip Bragg, a transfer from Southern California,
savs that the sophomores are "not yet set in their
ways" and are therefore "eager and ready to experi
ence new things."
Many residents also agree that the small number of
people living in the house creates a more comforta
ble* family-like atmosphere.
"It's not like any other Row House. There are
fewer people, so you get to know everyone very
quickly. There are no strangers wandering around,"
says Laura Slachmuijlder, a sophomore who lived in
Arroyo last year.
The residents are also enthusiastic about the lood
and the location of the house.
"Dominique is an awesome cook. She gets the
same food as other dorms and houses, but she takes
extra time to season things well and make attractive
arrangements," says Atterbury. "Her desserts are the
best."
"The major asset (of 553 Mayfield) is the location,"
says senior Darin Greenen. "It is so close to every
thing."
"Friends stop by to say "Hello" on their way to the
post office or to Tresidder," says Slachmuijlder.
There have been some typical new residence
problems. "Since we don't have any structure yet, it
has been difficult to organize many house activities,"
Greenen explains.
Atterbury anticipates that the activities of 553
Mayfield will include tailgaters and volleyball games.
"But we want to stay more low-key (than the previ
ous residents)," he says.
