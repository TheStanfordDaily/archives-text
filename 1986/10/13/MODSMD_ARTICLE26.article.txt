# What you will do after graduation

### MARY K. McDEVITT 
WASHINGTON — Sixty ex-
Stanfordites shoehorned into one
of Washington's trendiest discos
Saturday night to watch the Card
inal play the Washington Huskies
on national television.
They didn't seem to know that
they weren't in the stands at Stan
ford Stadium.
Many of the fans, graduates from
1977 to 1986, stood with their backs
to the game — chugging a Bud or a
Bartles & Jaymes as they talked
about boyfriends and girlfriends,

retold stories of freshman year and
complained about current jobs.
"Down in front," yelled one
frustrated fan halfway back.
The lone Husky loyal, regretting
his boisterous scream as the win
ning touchdown scored, raised his
arms to shield the rain of napkins,
sugar bags and French fries.
"It's too bad you belong to the
Washington Alumni Association
where no one ever graduates,"
yelled one Cardinal fan.
It was just like old times — ex
cept that the beer was on tap, the
wooden chairs were splinterless
and the graduates wore name tags.
Most of the fans here are living in
Washington, but some came to
town from as far away as New York
City. They spoke more of memories
of the Farm than about their new

jobs at the White House or The New
York Times or in real estate man
agement or on the pro tennis cir
cuit.
Many were visibly disappointed
by the loss, though one might think
that they would be used to it by
now.
One alumnus, who said he bet
$1,000 dollars on the 10-and-a-half
point spread on the game, smiled
unabashedly as the last seconds
ticked off.
Stanford University Now (SUN), a
national network of recent
graduates, sponsored the event at

Champions in Georgetown. SUN
organizes volunteers, conducts
semi-annual fundraising phone ap
peals and hosts social gatherings
across the nation. This year they
held a farewell party in Oakland for
Halley's Comet, a pub night in
Washington and a wine tasting in
Seattle. All recent graduates auto
matically become members of SUN.
SUN also has headquarters in
New York, Chicago, Portland and 35
other regions around the country,
according to a flier put out by the
organization.
The club spread out recent issues
of The Daily on the barroom table
and gave away two football media
guides as door prizes.
For the next game here, they may
organize pre-game tailgating.
Yes, there is life after Stanford.
