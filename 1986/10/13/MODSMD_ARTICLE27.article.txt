"It is a monster. More than 1,100
pages long, Stephen King's latest novel
is a tour de force in which he sum
mons up all the bogeymen of his child
htxxl, both of the human and the in
human variety. Think of "It" as an all
night horror film festival, with King
screening his worst nightmares for
your viewing pleasure.
Except Stephen King doesn't seem
to have "worst nightmares. He writes
about horror, and nightmares are his
source material, so he has to cultivate
them carefully. "It" draws together all
of King s favorite had dreams. As he
brings out one grotesque bit after an
other you can sense King's sense of
glee, it's easy to imagine him grinning
over his typewriter, beer in hand, won
dering what shambling horror to intro
duce next.
Partially for this reason, "It" isn't
really a scary book. Certainly there are
many chilling passages as well as some
of the memorably eerie images no
King book would be complete without,
but "It" is too much of a good time to
really be called frightening. King prob
ably realized that a book of the scope
he was aiming for — 1,000-plus pages
— couldn't be scary all the way

through. He instead allows a mood of
quiet dread to pervade throughout the
early parts of "It." Later on, however,
this mood is punctured by the frequent
appearances of various colorful
monstrosities, and these monsters are
what give "It" its exuberant roller
coaster quality.
In many ways, the book is a summa
tion of sorts for King. He's announced
that he plans to move onto other things
now, so i like to think of "It" as a big
graduation ceremony, with King hand
ing out diplomas to the wolfman, the
vampire, the mummy and all the other
fiends who have served him so well.
But at the same time, "It" is more than
a fond wave goodbye to all the spooks
who made King's fortune. It's also the
climax to a decade's worth of reflec
tion on the mysteries of childhood.
Perhaps children hold a natural fas
cination to all writers working in the
horror genre. Kids have little control
over their lives, their imaginations are
usually working overtime, and thus
belief in the supernatural comes more
easily to them. In many horror stories
(including "It"), this belief is what
saves kids: while the poor stupid adults
are paralyzed by their rationality, it's
the little tykes who are best equipped
to fight the horror. Contrary to what
the adults might say, the kids in horror
stories know exactly what can hurt
them.
Much of King's work deals with this
idea, and he writes about children with
real authority. But interestingly
enough, King's best piece on child
hood, "The Body," is entirely realistic.
There are no haunted hotels or
vampire towns in"The Body," only a

hike to see a dead boy's corpse.
Recently filmed as "Stand By Me," "The
Body" ranks as one of King's best and
most unusual works, both for its
naturalism and maturity.
"It" reconciles "The Body" with the
rest of King's writing, for its young
heroes face both natural and unnatural
evils as they come of age. In the sum
mer of 1958, a group of seven misfit
children become friends and form a

club. Calling themselves the Losers,
they are drawn into conflict with a
monstrous force that wields a perverse
influence over their town of Derry,
Maine. There has always been some
thing foul about Derry, it transpires.
Throughout the town's history, bizarre
and half-remembered atrocities have
occured Now in 1958 children are
vanishing with alarming frequency,
and Derrv's adults seem curiously

resigned to the disappearances. Only
the Losers are motivated to act.
Their motivation serves them well,
but not quite well enough. They finally
confront It, the big bad monster cor
rupting the town, but they can't destroy
It. In 1985, now all successful adults,
the seven ex-Losers receive a grim
summons to return to Derrv and
destroy It for gix>d.
The experiences of the Losers pro
vide King with some wonderful ma
terial as a writer. When describing the
kids' lives in 1958, King writes
evocatively about the last day of school,
the discovery of sex, the fear of big
kids and the realization that adults can
be deceitful, irrational and even evil.
More specifically, in the Losers King is
able to create some unique characters.
Stan Uris, the club's one Jewish mem
ber, is written in sketchy and uncon
vincing terms, but otherwise King
succeeds in creating a group of
believable outsiders. The best of these
include a wise ass named Richie,
whose mouth always gets him in trou
ble, and an archetypal fat kid named
Hen who. having always been alone,
doesn't really understand the concept
of loneliness.
There is ill so Mike, a black farmer's
son. Mike is perhaps the most sophisti
cated of King's creations here, for King
feels no compulsion to make Mike a
black symbol. There's no attempt to
give Mike a "black" character by having
him speak "jive," listen to soul music,
or whatever cliche you prefer. Mike is
the novel's most thoughtful and
sensitive character, and what differ
ences he has from his white friends
come out in subtle ways.
Naturally, mention must be made of
the book's other characters, the as
sorted nasties who terrorize the
Losers. It often appears as a clown, and
King gets quite a bit of mileage out of
this image. But since It also appears to
its victims as their worst fear, it takes
the shapes of Rodan, the Teenage
Werewolf, a mummy, a vampire and
the Creature from the Black Lagoon. A
clever bit of black humor comes when
the Creature attacks one boy. As he's
being strangled to death, the boy
recognizes the absurdity of the situa
tion — he can even feel the zipper on
the back of the creature's cheap rubber
suit — but it doesn't help him any.
"It" is almost derailed at its conclu
sion when, having built up his evil
menace for a thousand pages, King
can't really find a way to defeat It. The

climax lapses into a quasi-mysticism,
much like the lame collaboration be
tween King and Peter Straub, 1984 s
"The Talisman." Fortunately, the book s
denouement provides a far better
emotional payoff. One of the Losers,
now in his late 30s, reflects that our
child-selves were once the repository
of all we could become, but he doesn t
mourn his lost childhood. Instead, he
thinks, "It is good to be a child, but it is
also good to be a grownup and con
sider the mystery of childhood."
At the end of "It,"the horror is
defeated, and order can take over once
more. In endings like this, King brings
out a contention he has discussed in
interviews, namely that the horror
genre is as conservative as a three
piece suit, since the evil can always be
defeated, somehow. As much as I like
King's work, I think this is a very limit
ing view of horror fiction and what it
can do. Thus it's a pleasure to come
across someone like Clive Barker, who
feels the same way. Briefly, Barker is a
young English writer being touted as
"the big challenge to Stephen King."
This is a silly way to describe Barker.
For some reason, when it comes to
horror, book publishers and reviewers
fall prey to a fastest-gun-in-the-West
mentality as to who the scariest author
is. Why not appreciate each talent for
what it, and it alone, has to offer? What
Barker has to offer is a truly untamed
imagination and a keen wit. "The In
human Condition," a collection of
Barker stories recently released to cri
tical acclaim here in the United States,
showcases the author's best qualities,
notably his versatility, diabolical
humor and literary flair.
One story, "The Body Politic," shows
just how darkly funny Barker can be.
What if a man's hands grew tired of ser
ving the rest of the body? The story
depicts the gory yet humorous results.
"Down, Satan!" is an eerie modern-day
fable about a multi-millionaire who
sets out to build a hell on earth in or
der to summon up the devil. "Tine Age
of Desire" posits the question: What if
a man were aroused by everything he
saw? This last story is the best in
Barker's collection, for it shows how
the best horror fiction takes an un
blinking look at modern society and
comes up with some unsettling truths,
without ever becoming preachy.
Stephen King's work can do the
same thing, but what's admirable about
Barker is that his brand of horror
doesn't wear a three-piece suit.
