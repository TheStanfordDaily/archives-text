## Water polo downs California, falls to alumni for first defeat 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
These guys are just overpowering.
No collegiate water polo team can
defeat the Stanford men's water polo
team this year — and no team can even
come close.
At DeGuerre Pool on Friday, the No.
1 ranked Cardinal (20-0, 1-0 in the
Pacific-10 Conference) overwhelmed
an outmanned No. 2 California (16-5,
0-1 in Pac-10 play ) 13-5.
On Saturday, however, perhaps the
only team outside of the United States
National Team capable of beating the
Cardinal did just that. The team was the
Stanford Alumni squad.
With a starting lineup that included
1984 Olympians Chris Dorst, Drew
McDonald, Jody Campbell and current
United Sates National Team members

Alan Mouchawar and James Bergeson,
the alumni team prevailed 13-11. In all
likelihood, it will be the only loss suf
fered by Stanford this season.
In falling to Stanford for the fourth
time this season on Friday, the Bears
were victimized by a trademark of this
year's Cardinal team — a blazing start
out of the blocks. In the first quarter
this year, Stanford has scored 84 goals
to its opponents' 16.
"If a team is really good, that's when
they start their lead," California Coach
Pete Cutino said, "in the first half."
Against Cal, the Cardinal offense ex
ploded in the first half, scoring five
goals in the first quarter. The defense,
spearheaded by goalie Obi Greenman
and senior Greg Gamble, was im
penetrable. At halftime, Stanford led by
a commanding 8-0 margin.
"Our first half was the best we've

played this year," senior Craig Klass
said. "If our defense can play well —
and today you saw an indication of
how well we can play — then we
should win."
In the second half, with Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti substituting
freely, the Cardinal widened its lead to
the final 13-5 score. Cal could not
come closer than 9-4 at the end of the
third quarter.
"That was just domination," Detta
manti said."l have been here for 10
years and we have never shut out Cal
for an entire half. We played almost a
perfect game."
Several players got in on the scoring
action for Stanford, led by junior Matt
Tingler with four goals and Klass with
three. Klass upped his team-high goal

Senior Greg Gamble has been an important part of the Stanford water polo team for the last four years, starting
since his freshman year. Things have changed a lot since Gamble's first season, when the squad finished 11-13-3.
total to 49 on the season. In addition,
sophomore Jeff Oeding and senior
David Imbernino each chipped in two
goals.
"You have a whole group of guys
that can score at Stanford," Cutino said.
"You stop one phase of their game and
they turn on another phase; that is a
mark of a good team."

"Everyone played well," Dettanuu.i.
said. "It was by far Man Tingler's best
game at Stanford. He had a hand in at
least half of our goals."
Including four wins over No. 2 Cal
and victories over third ranked South
ern California (13-7) and No. 5 IJCLA
(12-5), the Cardinal has played all the
top teams in the country and has not
yet been tested.
Stanford may remain untested all
year long, according to Cutino.
"I don't think anyone can get close
to them this year," Cutino said.
