# Beaten soph sues 2 frats

### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
A Stanford student who suffered a
collapsed lung and two broken ribs in
a fight after a fraternity Rush party last
spring quarter has filed a lawsuit
against Stanford University, the Delta
Upsilon and Sigma Chi fraternities and
the students who allegedly beat him.
The suit, filed in the Santa Clara Su
perior Court, asks for unspecified gen
eral and punitive damages, the San
Jose Mercury News reported yesterday.
David Curry, then an 18-year-old
freshman, was involved in a fight at 3
a.m. April 11, 1986 with two other
freshmen, Bill McKelvy and Randy Von
Feldt, after the three had attended
Rush parties at the DU, Sigma Chi and
Beta Theta Pi fraternities.
The fight, in which Curry was al
legedly kicked by McKelvy and Von
Feldt, occurred on Lasuen Mall be
tween the DU and Sigma Chi fraterni
ties and was eventually broken up by a
DU member.
"He was beaten so badly they
thought he was going to die," John
Crowley, attorney for the plaintiff, told
the San Jose Mercury News. "We feel
Stanford has some responsibility."
Lyons said he was not surprised that
Curry filed a lawsuit.
"Anytime an organization serves al
cohol, they run the risk of a lawsuit if
wnething or someone
gets hurt..,. Someone's going to hold
them responsible," he said.
"We're lucky we haven't had any
(lawsuits) before," he added.
University staff counsel Iris Brest
said she could not comment on the
lawsuit because she had not yet been
informed of the details.
Curry was driven home by a DU and
was taken to the Cowell Health Center
by resident assistant Joe Henri at
Curry's Twain residence after the
freshman complained that he could
not breathe. Curry was then moved to
Stanford Hospital's Intensive Care Unit

where he remained for more than a
week.
Following the altercation last year,
Lyons said Curry, McKlevy and Von
Feldt were "quite drunk" and termed
the incident a "near-death" situation.
University judicial hearings were
held against all three students after the
incident. However, the results of the
hearings are confidential, Lyons said.
The fight apparently started on the
way from the Sigma Chi fraternity,
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said.
Niemeyer called the incident "a
gross misunderstanding that resulted
in a brutal beating." He added that
"clearly, alcohol abuse caused this sit
uation."
The incident between the freshmen
was the first in a string of incidents in
volving the DUs that eventually led the
University to revoke the fraternity's
charter and housing privileges in
May.
On the night of the altercation, the
DUs reportedly continued to serve al
cohol after the 10 p.m. curfew set by
the Intrafraternity Council. Rush par
ties and social activities for the DUs
were subsequently banned by the Uni
versity.
In a letter to then-DU president Scott
Hartman, Fraternal Affairs adviser Joe
Pisano wrote that evidence existed that
"those freshmen involved in the fight
wcti? d'rlYikln# with f)U members
shortly before the altercation."
But the Curry incident was not cited
by the University three weeks later
when it revoked recognition of the
DUs for two years and terminated the
fraternity's housing privileges.
John Christensen, president of die
Sigma Chis, said last spring: "At 3 a.m.
the three freshmen ... rudely tried to
enter the house. They came in and
were promptly tossed out." The three
freshmen were in the house for no
more than five minutes, he said.
'It's quite a year already for Stanford
fraternities," Pisano said.
