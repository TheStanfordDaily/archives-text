# Women's soccer blanks Grizzlies, for four straight
## 
### ED STACKLER 
After outlasting the Grizzlies of Northern Colorado 1-0
last Friday, the Stanford women's soccer team suddenly
gained "giantkiller" status.
The Cardinal struck early in the game, getting a quick,
surprise goal from midfielder Tonya Antonucci. Only
two minutes into die game, Antonucci drove diagonally
to the goal and kicked the ball high and hard into the net.
"It was h0t.... It was a bullet," teammate Vija Brookshire
said about the kick.
Tonya Antonucci is a freshman and a high school All-
American. At five-foot-three, Antonucci is an unimposing
figure at first glance and could easily be underestimated
by her opponents. She is the Cardinal's most effective of
fensive weapon this season, however, leading the team
with three goals.
As the first half continued, it was apparent that Stan
ford was in control The Cardinal had possession of the
ball for a longer time, and the offense continued to
pound at the resilient Northern Colorado defense
At halftime it was still 1-0. The mid-game break and
pep talk was not enough to spark the faltering Grizzlies
though.
We couldn't get untracked. In the second half we
couldn't make adjustments," Northern Colorado coach

Stanford forward Jennifer Hill (with ball) re-injured her back in the Cardinal's 1-0 win over
Northern Colorado last Friday. The junior was first hurt in practice and missed two games.
Her status is day-to-day and she may be able to play against Cal next weekend.
