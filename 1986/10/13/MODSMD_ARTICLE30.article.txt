# Women's soccer blanks Grizzlies, for four straight
## 
### ED STACKLER 
After outlasting the Grizzlies of Northern Colorado 1-0
last Friday, the Stanford women's soccer team suddenly
gained "giantkiller" status.
The Cardinal struck early in the game, getting a quick,
surprise goal from midfielder Tonya Antonucci. Only
two minutes into die game, Antonucci drove diagonally
to the goal and kicked the ball high and hard into the net.
"It was h0t.... It was a bullet," teammate Vija Brookshire
said about the kick.
Tonya Antonucci is a freshman and a high school All-
American. At five-foot-three, Antonucci is an unimposing
figure at first glance and could easily be underestimated
by her opponents. She is the Cardinal's most effective of
fensive weapon this season, however, leading the team
with three goals.
As the first half continued, it was apparent that Stan
ford was in control The Cardinal had possession of the
ball for a longer time, and the offense continued to
pound at the resilient Northern Colorado defense
At halftime it was still 1-0. The mid-game break and
pep talk was not enough to spark the faltering Grizzlies
though.
We couldn't get untracked. In the second half we
couldn't make adjustments," Northern Colorado coach

Stanford forward Jennifer Hill (with ball) re-injured her back in the Cardinal's 1-0 win over
Northern Colorado last Friday. The junior was first hurt in practice and missed two games.
Her status is day-to-day and she may be able to play against Cal next weekend.
Kadlecek said. "We weren't sharp men
tally."
The Grizzlies did play a little better
in the second period though, keeping
the outcome of die game in doubt until
the end. The Cardinal defense was put
to a rigorous test as the Grizzlies took
most of their attempts at the goal in the
second half.
Keeping the Grizzlies from scoring
in the remainder of the game was a dif
ficult feat in itself for the Stanford
defense. Hilary Turner once again
lived up to the team's expectations,
shutting down the Grizzlies' top
scorer, Lisa Jacobsen. Jacobsen had
scored 11 goals previous to this
game.
Fullbacks Anne Youmans, Catherine
Barrera, and Chris Scott, along with

freshman sweeper Christine
"Thunderfoot Martin, succeeded in
staying between the Stanford goal and
the speedy Grizzly forwards.
Both teams' goalkeepers held steady
throughout the game. Cardinal goalie
Vija Brookshire had 10 saves in the
game, while Shari Lewis of Northern
Colorado had 11 saves.
With Stanford's victory, Northern
Colorado dropped to 6-1.
This win was very important for
Stanford. The team is now undefeated
in their last four games, and confi
dence has returned to the Cardinal
ranks.
"I've never felt this strong of a win
ning attitude on the team," said
Berkshire, a sophomore.
The team is definitely prepared to
get back on the road and play at San
Francisco State. And while it is not
good to look too far down the road,
next Saturday's home game against na
tionally ranked California must be
on its mind.
