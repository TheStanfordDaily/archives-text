# Bosox win thriller

### 
ANAHEIM (AP) â€” Dave Henderson,
whose two-run homer capped a four
run rally in the ninth inning that kept
Boston alive, hit a sacrifice fly in the
11th inning yesterday that gave the Red
Sox a 7-6 victory over the California
Angels in Game 5 of the American
League playoffs.
The Red Sox, who several times
were perilously close to elimination,
instead narrowed California's lead to 3-
2 in the best-of-seven series. Game 6 is
scheduled tomorrow night in Boston.
Henderson's heroics, which came
after his defensive miscue on Bobby
Grich's freak home run had put Cali
fornia ahead in the sixth, enabled Bos
ton to avoid being swept in three
games at Anaheim Stadium after split
ting the first two games at Fenway Park.
Don Baylor and Henderson hit two
run homers as the Red Sox overcame a
5-2 deficit in the ninth, and the same
two players triggered the Red Sox vic
tory in the 11th.
Baylor, leading off the 11th, was hit
by a pitch from Donnie Moore. It was
the 36th time Baylor was hit this year
and the 228 th time for the AL leader in
that department.
Dwight Evans singled Baylor to
second and Rich Gedman's fourth hit
of the game, a bunt single, loaded the
bases. Henderson followed with his
sacrifice fly to medium-deep center.
The victory went to Steve Crawford,
who pitched out of a bases-loaded jam
with one out in the ninth and also
worked the 10th.

Calvin Schiraldi, tagged with Bos
ton's heart-breaking loss in Game 4,
worked a perfect 11th for the save.
The Angels battled back against
three Boston relievers to tie it 6-6 in
the bottom of the ninth.
Trailing 6-5, Bob Boone led off with
a single against Bob Stanley. Boone, 3-
for-3 yesterday and 9-for-17 in the se
ries, was replaced by pinch-runner
Ruppert Jones, who took second on a
sacrifice by Gary Pettis.
Joe Sambito relieved Stanley, and
Wilfong grounded his first pitch just
beyond the reach of second baseman
Marty Barren. Jones was running all the
way and slid home safely, just ahead of
right fielder Evans' strong throw to
Gedman.
Dick Schofield then greeted Craw
ford with a single that sent Wilfong to
third, and Brian Downing was inten
tionally walked to load the bases.
But with the winning run 90 feet
from home plate and the outfield
drawn in, Crawford managed to get out
of it by retiring Doug DeCinces on a
shallow fly to right and, after going 2-0
on Grich, got him on a soft liner back
to the mound.
Henderson fouled off a 2-2 pitch
before launching a drive over the left
field fence. Henderson danced down
the first-base line and his teammates
streamed onto the field to greet him
while the crowd sat in shocked silence.
Witt struck out five, walked none
and allowed eight hits in his 8 2-3 in
nings.
