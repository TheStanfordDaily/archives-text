# Astros down Mets

### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Mike Scott
pitched a three-hitter in a record
setting performance, beating the New
York Mets 3-1 last night as the Houston
Astros evened the National League
playoffs at two victories apiece.
Alan Ashby, given a second chance
when his foul popup wasn't caught, hit
a two-run homer, and Dickie Thon
added a solo shot, accounting for all
the runs off Mets left-hander Sid Fer
nandez.
Sqott, who beat the Mets 1-0 in Game
1, became the first pitcher in either
league to pitch two complete games in
a playoff series.
Scott won Game 1 with a five-hitter,
equalling a playoff record with 14
strikeouts. While he was less over
powering this time out, returning on
three days rest after throwing 125
pitches in Game 1, he was no less ef
fective. He did not give up a hit until
Ray Knight's two-out single in the fifth
inning, while walking none and strik
ing out five.
That gave Scott 19 strikeouts, most
ever in a league playoff. Dave Stieb had
18 strikeouts for Toronto in last year's
American League playoffs against
Kansas City.
The lone run off Scott came in the

eighth when pinch-hitter Danny Heep
drove in Mookie Wilson with a
sacrifice fly.
Scott's 16 and two-thirds consecutive
scoreless innings bettered the previ
ous NL record of 15 and two-thirds set
by Los Angeles' Don Sutton in 1974.
Rookie left-hander Jim Deshaies, 12-
5 during the season, will face the Mets'
Dwight Gooden, who lost Game 1
despite giving up just one run in seven
innings, as the two sides try to break
the second tie of the playoffs in Game
5 today. There was a forecast for a
chance of rain for the game.
Astros Manager Hal Lanier wrestled
with the decision whether to bring
Scott back on three days of rest, al
though he had a 5-3 record in games
earlier this season that he had started
without the normal four days off. But
the gamble paid off as Scott had his
split-fingered fastball working to per
fection.
Wilson led off the Mets eighth with
an infield hit behind second base.
Knight followed with a hard ground
ball to third. As Phil Garner threw out
Knight at first, Wilson continued on to
third, barely hesitating as he rounded
second. Heep drove him home with a
fly ball to medium-deep center field.
