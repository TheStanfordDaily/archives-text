# Cross country goes to Arizona Invitational, starts preparation for NCAA championship
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
At the the Arizona Invitational, to be held this after
noon in Tuscon, the Stanford cross country teams
will fuse the skills of athletics with education as they
run the course in preparation for the NCAA finals five
weeks from now at the same venue.
"The military calls this a reconnoitering exercise,"
Stanford coach Brooks Johnson said. "It's a case of
learning the course and finding out if 2,500 feet
makes a difference."
The distance Johnson referred to is the altitude
change. "I don't think it will make a difference, but
you never know,"he added.
The teams' goals for the meet are clearly long
range, focusing more on the championships than the

Arizona Invitational itself.
"We're ranked No. 1 in October," Johnson said.
"It's more important to be ranked first on the 25th of
November."
The Cardinal goes to Arizona after a shining per
formance at last week's Stanford Invitational. In a
field of 37 teams, the women's squad emerged on
top, successfully defending their invitational title for
the sixth consecutive year.
Leading the team's effort was Carol Gray, a fresh
man from New Carlisle, Ind., who finished seventh in
the 5,000-meter competition. Cory Schubert and
Kathy Smith, both juniors, also finished well, gal
vanizing the team's bid at first place at the meet.
The men finished in fine form as well, garnering
second place after losing to North Carolina by a mere
three-point margin. Senior team captain Marc Olesen

was second to none, however, as he finished the race
well ahead of the competition.
The victory marked the second invitational title for
Olesen, the top scorer in the NCAA. Last year, he
shared the championship with teammate Ryan Stoll,
also a senior, when both finished the race in 31:40.1.
The team is now looking ahead to the NCAA cham
pionships. "It's five weeks to the finals, and that's
when it counts," Johnson said.
Though Stanford has yet to run the course in Tus
con, Johnson exudes confidence about his teams.
"We've run well down there in Arizona in the past,"
he said. "After running Monday, we'll work out our
strategy to run the course in the finals.
"We also run well at Fresno," Johnson added, re
ferring to the site of the District 8 regionals. "Things
are really falling into place for the finals."
