Maree Chung's first goal of the
season, a rehound shot in the final five
minutes, hroke a scoreless tie and
propelled the Stanford field hockey
team to a 1-0 Northern Pacific Confer
ence victory over host Chico State on
Saturday.
The win upped the Cardinal's Nor-
Pac record to 2-1-1 and evened its
overall record at 4-4-1. The Wildcats
fell to 0-3-1, both in the NorPac and
overall.
According to Captain Andi Wolpert,
the Cardinal played a sluggish first half
against the last-place Wildcats. "We
were really flat," she said.
Wolpert insisted, however, that Stan
ford was not taking Chico State lightly
"We always have a hard time against
them,' she said. "Even though we were
playing a last-place team, all the teams
in our conference are pretty even."
The sweltering Chico heat can make
things difficult for a visiting team, but
Wolpert didn t believe it had anything
to do with the Cardinal's slow start
"The last couple of years we've played
there, it's been something like ioo
degrees, but this time it was onlv about

85." she said. "When we play there, we
always expect it to he hot."
The Cardinal had its chances
throughout the second hall, hut
couldn't break through until Chung's
game-winner. After the Stanford
defense had cleared the hall out of its
own area, freshman right wing Tracy
Stieglitz fired a corner shot at Wildcat
goalkeeper Karin Koines. Koines
managed to make a pad save on
Stieglitz' shot, hut she could not stop
Chung on the rebound
Stanford goalkeeper Karen Jones re
corded her second consecutive
shutout and third whitewashing of the
year. She lowered her goals-against
average to 1.33 per game.
Another defensive standout for the
Cardinal was sophomore Alison Smith.
Smith, normally a midfielder, played
her first game ever at center-halfback,
replacing freshman Lisa Longstreth,
who quit the team last week. "She
(Smith) played really, really well,"
Wolpert said.
The Cardinal's overall performance
was not as good. "Even though we
won. we didn't feel we played very
well," Wolpert said. "But I think we
have a lot of potential and that we can
still win our conference."
