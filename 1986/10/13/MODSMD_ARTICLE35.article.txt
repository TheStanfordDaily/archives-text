# Cardinal spikers lose tough game in four to SJSU
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Alter five straight wins, including a
strong upset over Arizona State, every
thing was put in perspective for Card
inal volleyball Friday night by San Jose
State, which defeated Stanford three
games to one in the championship
match ofjosten's Invitational at Maples
Pavilion this weekend.
Approximately 2,500 fans saw a
decidedly more consistent and experi
enced Spartan team drop the first
game, 15-10, before jumping all over
the Cardinal in the second game, 15-4,
and then playing clutch volleyball to
pull just ahead at the end of the third
and fourth games, winning both by the
score of 15-12. Stanford dropped to 9-6
on the season, while San Jose State im
proved to 14-1.
The rankings going into Friday
night's final had Stanford at No. 12 and
the Spartans at No. 3. Their competitive
performance was evident against San
Jose State.
The teams virtually traded points
through the last two games before the
Spartan experience saved and then
won the majority of the crucial points,
which shows that the Cardinal spikers
may be better than their ranking indi
cates. According to Spartan Christa
Cook, a senior outside hitter, they're
much better.
"They should be a lot higher
ranked," Cook said, "they're a great
team."
So if Stanford is a great team, and
San Jose State defeated them, then this
really must have been some match,
and it was. Cook attributed the show
down's excitement to the teams'
similar playing style.
"We both play the same kind of
game, very aggressive," Cook said.
"The momentum's fast and it gets very
intense. From the first point you've got
to play your best."
In the second game, Stanford did not
play its best as the momentum got a
little too fast for them. The Cardinal
were down quickly and just as quickly
it was too late to come back. Momen
tum seems to be a key word when it
comes to volleyball.
"Anytime you lose 15-4, you're con
cerned," Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben
Nieves said, "but in volleyball the mo
mentum can change so fast and you
can be caught off guard.... We could
just as well beat them 15-4."

What Nieves described as a
"fantastic" Spartan team really showed
its stuff when every dig really counted.
San Jose State outside hitter Lisa Ice,
the tournament's MVP, tagged Spartan
play at these moments as the ultimate
difference leading to her team's win.
"1 wasn't sure it was over until we
really did it," Ice said. "Stanford's not a
team that gives up. It was a couple
really key plays, a couple digs by
Danielle (Spier), a couple blocks."
Nieves disagreed- with Ice's assess
ment of where the match was won and
lost. "It didn't boil down to just those
last plays, tonight," he said.
"I can't really pinpoint one thing,"
Nieves went on. "After a match, we al
ways come up with several things we
can do better We made some er
rors tonight, some mental, a lot physi
cal."
The mental errors showed in a
couple instances of Cardinal confusion
concerning its position rotation. Physi
cal error was most evident in service
errors that stopped streaks and lost
possession during both the third and
fourth games.
Senior Barbra Fontana led the Card
inal in kills with 14 and digs with 13-
Theresa Smith had 13 kills, but her
record setting jump serve that
devastated Illinois State Thursday night
was not with her Friday night. While
Smith did serve four aces, she commit
ted the same number of service errors.
With Cook and Ice, among others,
blocking well all night, Cardinal hitting
percentages were down. Smith hit at a
decent .273 success rate, Fontana
managed only a .136 percentage. As a
team, Stanford's hitting percentage was
.186. Before the Invitational the team
percentage was .249 for die season. On
the other side of the net, Ice hit 18
kills, Cook 11. Their hitting percent
ages were .292 and .250, respectively.
The consolation match was won
easily by No. 15 Colorado State, 15-13,
15-6, 15-9, as they upped their record
to 18-2. The Invite's All-Tournament
team consisted of Nancy Reno, Wendi
Rush, and Smith from Stanford; Spar
tans Ice, Cook, and Gina Watson; and
CSU hitter Angie Knox. The most
glaring omittance from the team was
probably "halftime entertainer" Dr.
Dig, who challenged lucky ticket
holders to ace him between games, al
lowing only two.
The Cardinal will be at home again
next weekend.

the tournament's MVP, tagged Spartan
play at these moments as the ultimate
difference leading to her team's win.
"1 wasn't sure it was over until we
really did it," Ice said. "Stanford's not a
team that gives up. It was a couple
really key plays, a couple digs by
Danielle (Spier), a couple blocks."
Nieves disagreed- with Ice's assess
ment of where the match was won and
lost. "It didn't boil down to just those
last plays, tonight," he said.
"I can't really pinpoint one thing,"
Nieves went on. "After a match, we al
ways come up with several things we
can do better We made some er
rors tonight, some mental, a lot physi
cal."
The mental errors showed in a
couple instances of Cardinal confusion
concerning its position rotation. Physi
cal error was most evident in service
errors that stopped streaks and lost
possession during both the third and
fourth games.
Senior Barbra Fontana led the Card
inal in kills with 14 and digs with 13-
Theresa Smith had 13 kills, but her
record setting jump serve that
devastated Illinois State Thursday night
was not with her Friday night. While
Smith did serve four aces, she commit
ted the same number of service errors.
With Cook and Ice, among others,
blocking well all night, Cardinal hitting
percentages were down. Smith hit at a
decent .273 success rate, Fontana
managed only a .136 percentage. As a
team, Stanford's hitting percentage was
.186. Before the Invitational the team
percentage was .249 for die season. On
the other side of the net, Ice hit 18
kills, Cook 11. Their hitting percent
ages were .292 and .250, respectively.
The consolation match was won
easily by No. 15 Colorado State, 15-13,
15-6, 15-9, as they upped their record
to 18-2. The Invite's All-Tournament
team consisted of Nancy Reno, Wendi
Rush, and Smith from Stanford; Spar
tans Ice, Cook, and Gina Watson; and
CSU hitter Angie Knox. The most
glaring omittance from the team was
probably "halftime entertainer" Dr.
Dig, who challenged lucky ticket
holders to ace him between games, al
lowing only two.
The Cardinal will be at home again
next weekend.
Alter five straight wins, including a
strong upset over Arizona State, every
thing was put in perspective for Card
inal volleyball Friday night by San Jose
State, which defeated Stanford three
games to one in the championship
match ofjosten's Invitational at Maples
Pavilion this weekend.
Approximately 2,500 fans saw a
decidedly more consistent and experi
enced Spartan team drop the first
game, 15-10, before jumping all over
the Cardinal in the second game, 15-4,
and then playing clutch volleyball to
pull just ahead at the end of the third
and fourth games, winning both by the
score of 15-12. Stanford dropped to 9-6
on the season, while San Jose State im
proved to 14-1.
The rankings going into Friday
night's final had Stanford at No. 12 and
the Spartans at No. 3. Their competitive
performance was evident against San
Jose State.
The teams virtually traded points
through the last two games before the
Spartan experience saved and then
won the majority of the crucial points,
which shows that the Cardinal spikers
may be better than their ranking indi
cates. According to Spartan Christa
Cook, a senior outside hitter, they're
much better.
"They should be a lot higher
ranked," Cook said, "they're a great
team."
So if Stanford is a great team, and
San Jose State defeated them, then this
really must have been some match,
and it was. Cook attributed the show
down's excitement to the teams'
similar playing style.
"We both play the same kind of
game, very aggressive," Cook said.
"The momentum's fast and it gets very
intense. From the first point you've got
to play your best."
In the second game, Stanford did not
play its best as the momentum got a
little too fast for them. The Cardinal
were down quickly and just as quickly
it was too late to come back. Momen
tum seems to be a key word when it
comes to volleyball.
"Anytime you lose 15-4, you're con
cerned," Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben
Nieves said, "but in volleyball the mo
mentum can change so fast and you
can be caught off guard.... We could
just as well beat them 15-4."

What Nieves described as a
"fantastic" Spartan team really showed
its stuff when every dig really counted.
San Jose State outside hitter Lisa Ice,
the tournament's MVP, tagged Spartan
play at these moments as the ultimate
difference leading to her team's win.
"1 wasn't sure it was over until we
really did it," Ice said. "Stanford's not a
