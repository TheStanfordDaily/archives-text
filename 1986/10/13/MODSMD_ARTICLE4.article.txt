# Kennedy reasserts selective divestment policy
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy on
Friday reaffirmed his commitment to a case-by
case strategy regarding divestment from com
panies doing business in South Africa.
Kennedy, meeting with about 20 members of
the Stanford community, said the recent and
sizable divestment actions by Harvard Univer
sity and the University of California were not
based on "novel analysis or new criteria" and
would probably not alter the stance (if Stan
ford's Board of Trustees.
However, Kennedy said he is losing patience
with Schlumberger Ltd., which he said is lag
ging in providing information to Stanford on its

apartheid-combatting activities. He said he is
not sure if the trustees share his feelings.
The trustees voted Sept. 9 to buy no more
Schlumberger stock until receiving a report on
the company's anti-apartheid actions. Stanford
owns 124,000 shares of the company's stock, a
holding worth about $4.1 million.
Several students told Kennedy they believe
U.S. firms in South Africa do more harm than
good by strengthening the South African eco
nomy and paying taxes to the nation's racist
government.
Education Prof. Joel Samoff predicted that
events in South Africa would develop as they
did in Zimbabwe, which was formerly white
ruled Rhodesia. When racial strife broke out in
that country, Samoff said, the United States and

Great Britain brokered a compromise to end
the civil war.
Samoff said similar "arm-twisting" would
probably be needed to change the South
African government, but added that large U.S.
investments in the nation could limit the U.S.
government's flexibility.
Kennedy defended current University policy.
"I believe it is possible that considered over
all ... the presence of American firms is more
negative than positive, but I do think there are
numbers of American firms for which the bal
ance sheet is positive," Kennedy said.
In judging a company's South African in
volvement, Kennedy said Stanford considers
three things: The company's adherence to the
Sullivan Principles, its aggressiveness in at

tempting to convince the South African govern
ment of the need for social reform and the
company's efforts in providing fundamental
human services to blacks.
Kennedy said U.S. corporations could aid the
transition to a post-apartheid society by provid
ing "multi-racial, community-based, democratic
means of delivering fundamental human
services."
He called South Africa "an extraordinary
welfare state" and said the government
represses blacks through its control of educa
tion and health-care services.
According to Kennedy, U.S. companies have
provided a critical alternative to government
provided services by adopting black schools,
establishing medical clinics in non-white

townships and providing integrated housing at
universities.
Education Prof. Martin Carnoy suggested that
Stanford require companies in its portfolio to
support black workers' unions.
Kennedy also said he is not convinced that
the South African government dislikes the
withdrawal of foreign investment.
"Because of uncertainties and because of
feelings in the international business commu
nity about the whole divestment issue, the ten
dency is for those companies (being sold by
foreign firms) to go at fire-sale prices. So it isn't
clear that, in fact, the South African government
isn't benefitting from most of those transac
tions."
