# Higher education criticized
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
"Some people don't get educated
here — too many for the greatest uni
versity in the country," said Education
Secretary' William Bennett from a pul
pit at Harvard University.
Bennett also assailed higher educa
tion in general during a Friday address
to Harvard undergraduates, which he
was invited to deliver in commemora
tion of the university's 3Soth anniver
sary.
The Reagan Cabinet member also
criticized sclnx)ls for neglecting their
moral responsibilities, being too con
cerned about money and showing a
liberal bias.
Harvard President Derek Bok coun
tered that Bennett's address raised im
portant questions, but shed "more heat
than light."
Stanford President Donald Kennedy reacted similarly to
the speech. "It's a mystery to all of us why Secretary Bennett
is bent on annoying, rather than grappling with the real
problems in higher education and its relation to govern
ment," Kennedy said. "His affection for controversy is hard
to understand."
Bennett, a Harvard Law School graduate, said he was glad
to be helping the school celebrate its birthday. But "there
are too many intellectual and educational casualties among
the student body of Harvard," Bennett said.
"1 would fault Harvard and other universities for this:
There's not that much effort to see to it, systematically and
devotedly, that real education occurs," he said.
Bennett compared university requirements to the menu
in a Chinese restaurant, with students picking "at leisure"
from column A and column B. He said students should have
a "real core curriculum" including American and Euro£>ean
history, the great works of Western art and literature and the
major achievements of the scientific disciplines.
Kennedy said he certainly does not regard Stanford's cur
riculum to be a Chinese menu. As far as Bennett's core con
cept, Kennedy said that what is appropriate for an under
graduate education "depends on the person and the pur
pose."
Bennett also said the unaddressed problem of drugs on
campus illustrates the moral hypocrisy of colleges. "Most of
our colleges would not dream of claiming to offer a moral
education to their students, to their charges," he said. "But
there is no shortage of moralizing or moral posturing — es

pecially the kind that does not cost anything of the individ
ual, that does not take time or self-denial or effort."
"It is true that dealing with the drug problem requires a
more sustained effort than signing a petition or mounting a
demonstration; it requires individual and institutional time
and long-term commitment," Bennett said. "These have not
been very forthcoming on very many of our campuses.
In response, Kennedy said that Stanford and other institu
tions take positions on both internal and external problems,
contrary to the implication of Bennett's statements. I really
don't understand what he's talking about," Kennedy said.
Bennett accused schools with being overly concerned
about money, to the point of corruption. "Money has meant
growth and expansion, which in some places has meant a
diffusion and loss of focus, a loss of central purpose. And
more money hits given many in our universities the oppor
tunity to avoid doing one thing above all — actually teach
ing large numbers of students; or, in some cases, any stu
dents," he said.
Bennett also warned against allowing "a pervasive kind ot
conformism and intolerance to permeate our institutions of
higher education. Prestigious, selective, leading universities
— whatever modifier you wish — have a tendency in our
time to show a liberal bias," he said.
But he added that "this need not be a great problem, as
long as we are very careful that a generally shared political
viewpoint does not lead to the explicit or implicit censor
ship of unpopular ideas."
Bennett criticized "active liberals" for not condemning
incidents where conservative speakers were shouted down
on college campuses.
Replying to that criticism, Kennedy said, "Secretary Ben
nett should have heard the vigor of debates here over the
last two years. I think free speech is alive and well at Stan
ford."
