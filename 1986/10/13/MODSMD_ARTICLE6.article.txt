# Plan reduces seat-saving
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
The new plan organizing students
who were waiting to enter Saturday's
football game worked smoothly, ac
cording to students and University offi
cials.
The temporary rules, worked out
Wednesday by students and adminis
trators, required groups wishing to
camp overnight at the stadium to regis
ter with the Axe Committee by Friday
afternoon and meet with the commit
tee later that day
Two Stanford administrators last
week proposed abolishing pre-game
seat-saving, but Axe Committee Chair
man Mike Tuchin said that the idea was
rejected Wednesday during a meeting
among students, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger and Police Chief Marvin
Herrington.
Lvons said student behavior on Sat

urdav was much better than during
home games earlier this season.
"It looked to me like the seat-saving
was greatly reduced,' Lyons said yes
terday."The jamming at the gate was
relieved quite a bit."
Lyons, one of the administrators
who proposed abolishing seat-saving,
had also complained that students
were injured last week during a rush
when the student gates opened.
Friday's Axe Committee meeting
with gate-side campers drew 27 stu
dents representing seven fraternities
and Trancos Hall.
"It was an excellent turnout. As far as
I know, every group that slept over had
registered with us," Tuchin said yester
day.
During the meeting, representatives
were presented with a rule and several
recommendations to govern their be
havior Friday night and Saturday after -

Football-goers don't seem amused by having to wait in line for a seat, in accordance with the new policy of no seat
saving.
