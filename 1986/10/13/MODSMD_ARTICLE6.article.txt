# Plan reduces seat-saving
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
The new plan organizing students
who were waiting to enter Saturday's
football game worked smoothly, ac
cording to students and University offi
cials.
The temporary rules, worked out
Wednesday by students and adminis
trators, required groups wishing to
camp overnight at the stadium to regis
ter with the Axe Committee by Friday
afternoon and meet with the commit
tee later that day
Two Stanford administrators last
week proposed abolishing pre-game
seat-saving, but Axe Committee Chair
man Mike Tuchin said that the idea was
rejected Wednesday during a meeting
among students, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger and Police Chief Marvin
Herrington.
Lvons said student behavior on Sat

urdav was much better than during
home games earlier this season.
"It looked to me like the seat-saving
was greatly reduced,' Lyons said yes
terday."The jamming at the gate was
relieved quite a bit."
Lyons, one of the administrators
who proposed abolishing seat-saving,
had also complained that students
were injured last week during a rush
when the student gates opened.
Friday's Axe Committee meeting
with gate-side campers drew 27 stu
dents representing seven fraternities
and Trancos Hall.
"It was an excellent turnout. As far as
I know, every group that slept over had
registered with us," Tuchin said yester
day.
During the meeting, representatives
were presented with a rule and several
recommendations to govern their be
havior Friday night and Saturday after -

noon — when the gates opened.
The rule prohibited kegs of beer
outside the stadium. "That's basically
the only rule. Past that, we're just ask
ing for cooperation," Tuchin told the
group on Friday.
The representatives were also asked
to refrain from serving l">eer to local
high school students, a practice that
Tuchin said has been a problem in the
past.
"If there is pushing, the police will
close the gates — and keep them
closed until after the game if neces
sary," Tuchin said.
In addition, he said: "Police have
said they will not open the gates unless
people form some semblance of a
line."
Tuchin also recommended that
groups bring more people to save
seats.
The stadium line was small at mid
night Friday — only members of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity were waiting.
But by 9:20 Saturday morning, 35
students were present, representing
the dorms Trancos, Synergy and Soto
and the fraternities Kappa Sigma,

Kappa Alpha, Sigma Chi, Phi Delia
Theta, Zeta Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Delta Kappa Epsilon and Phi Psi.
Students who spent the night
outside the Stadium agreed that the
scene was calm.
Sophomore Dave Steward, an SAE
who was at the stadium from 1-7:30
a.m., said, "It was a much more casual
scene up until the last five or 10
minutes before die gate opened. But
once the gate was about to open,
everybody crushed up (against the
gate). So on the whole, the situation
wasn't really better than the past."
Describing the scene on Friday
night, Steward said, "The police came a
few times. Once they told someone to
turn down his stereo and that was
about it."
According to senior Grant Stanley,
president of the Sigma Chi fraternity,
"It was a lot more calm than its been in
the past."
