Salvador quake survivors found
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Rescue teams continued to pull a few
survivors from the mangled ruins of the Ruben Dario commercial building
yesterday and used dogs and ultra-sound equipment in a seemingly futile
search for an American businessman buried in the lobby of the collapsed
Gran Hotel El Salvador.
Salvadoran Red Cross officials said the crisis caused by Friday's
earthquake was "stabilizing," as badly needed medicine, food and tempo
rary shelters arrived from the United States, Europe and Latin America.
Some of the injured who previously had been too afraid to leave their
shattered neighborhoods began to arrive at medical centers to seek treat
ment for their wounds.
Much of the capital's telephone service was restored and the capital's
wealthier neighborhoods were receiving water and electricity again, but
most poor or heavily damaged areas remained without services.
Salvadoran Red Cross spokesman Ernesto Ferreiro said 400 people died
and 6,810 were injured in the earthquake that registered 5.4 on the Richter
scale. The death toll is expected to rise as bodies are recovered from the
rubble.
Shamir to head government
JERUSALEM — Yitzhak Shamir, who is scheduled to take over as Israel's
prime minister this week, is an uncompromising nationalist with an almost
messianic belief that "right makes might" — a twist on the aphorism — and
a priority list that puts the Middle East peace process third, behind Israel's
economy and its national security.
Shamir, 70, an underground leader before Israel became an indepen
dent nation in 1948, is now the foreign minister and is scheduled to ex
change posts tomorrow with Prime Minister Shimon Peres, his centrist
rival who has led the government for 25 months.
As his words suggest, Shamir will bring a different emphasis and a differ
ent style to the job. The publicity-conscious Peres spent much of his term
trying to overcome what he described as an international image of Israeli
intransigence.
Reagan policies may be illegal
WASHINGTON — As long as the Reagan Administration openly encour
ages gun running in Central America, more Americans will become in
volved, killed and put on trial and the distinction will be blurred between
who's official and who isn't, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee said yesterday.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said most members of Congress feel the U.S.
government has overstepped the bounds by giving a "wink and a shrug" to
private groups supporting contra rebels seeking to overthrow the govern
ment of Nicaragua.
Congress barred military aid from the United States to the contras in
1984 but later authorized non-military aid.
The question of whether the U.S. government has gone beyond that has
come under intense scrutiny since Eugene Hasenfus, an ex-Marine who
once flew for Air America, a CIA-operated airline in Vietnam, was captured
in Nicaragua after his arms-laden plane was brought down by a Nicaraguan
missile.
Lifting Poland sanctions possible
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration is considering ending eco
nomic sanctions against Poland as a result of the Warsaw government's
recent amnesty for political prisoners, a State Department official said yes
terday.
The official said that no decision has been made, however, on final lifting
of the sanctions that were originally imposed five years ago following
Poland's declaration of martial law.
Some of the measures were repealed earlier. The most important
remaining ones are a ban on new U.S. credit guarantees and suspension of
"most-favored-nation" trade status, which provides the same low tariffs that
apply to most non-communist nations. The only communist countries cur
rently enjoying most-favored-nation status are Romania, Hungary, Yugos
lavia and China
Last month, Poland released more than 200 political prisoners, including
some of the country's best-known dissidents. At the time, U.S. officials said
that the sanctions almost certainly would be lifted provided the amnesty
was a real one.
However, one official recalled that many of the dissidents released un
der earlier amnesties were later re-arrested. The official said that Washing
ton wants to wait to make sure that procedure will not be repeated this
time.
FBI unravels Laßouche network
WASHINGTON — Federal investigators, with more than two truckloads
of seized records to sort through, are focusing on obstruction of justice
charges as they try to unravel political extremist Lyndon Laßouche's net
work of organizations.
After nearly two years of investigating what U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson
called "an organizational policy of fraud and bilking," the government last
week raided Laßouche's Virginia headquarters and indicted several of his
inner circle members, his fund-raisers and assorted corporations and com
mittees.
The government provided a broad look at its case last week in persuad
ing a federal magistrate to hold without bond two top Laßouche lieutenants
facing obstructon charges.
That evidence touched Laßouche himself, who has not been charged but
who prosecutors contend "dominates and controls" an organization
charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice.
It also shed light on what is one of the most bizarre political organiza
tions ever — whose members, according to the FBI, make late-night
harassing telephone calls to opponents and thought they could get CIA
help to "spike" a federal fraud investigation of them.
BankAmerica president chosen
SAN FRANCISCO — Former World Bank president A.W. Clausen was
named yesterday to his old job as chief executive officer for both
BankAmerica Corp. and its financially troubled Bank of America unit.
He replaces the man who was his replacement, Samuel Armacost.
Armacost, 47, announced his resignation Friday as president and chief
executive officer of the corporation after five stormy years as head of the
nation's second-largest blinking concern. He spent a total of 25 years with
the company.
Clausen, 63, left BankAmerica and Bank of America in April 1981 and
became president of the World Bank in July of that year. He retired from
the World Bank earlier this year.
Queen gets Chinese welcome
PEKING — About 1,000 children waving flowers and miniature British
and Chinese flags welcomed Queen Elizabeth II to a spruced up Peking
yesterday, the start of a six-day trip that is the first to China by a reigning
British monarch.
She will be officially welcomed this morning in a ceremony in
Tiananmen Square including a 21 gun salute, dancing children and a
People's Liberation Army honor guard.
Later she will meet President Li Xiannian before visiting the Forbidden
City, once the home of China's last emperor, overthrown in 1911, and the
circular Temple of Heaven
She also will attend a reception for British and Commonwealth guests.

Salvador quake survivors found
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Rescue teams continued to pull a few
survivors from the mangled ruins of the Ruben Dario commercial building
yesterday and used dogs and ultra-sound equipment in a seemingly futile
search for an American businessman buried in the lobby of the collapsed
Gran Hotel El Salvador.
Salvadoran Red Cross officials said the crisis caused by Friday's
earthquake was "stabilizing," as badly needed medicine, food and tempo
rary shelters arrived from the United States, Europe and Latin America.
Some of the injured who previously had been too afraid to leave their
shattered neighborhoods began to arrive at medical centers to seek treat
ment for their wounds.
Much of the capital's telephone service was restored and the capital's
wealthier neighborhoods were receiving water and electricity again, but
most poor or heavily damaged areas remained without services.
Salvadoran Red Cross spokesman Ernesto Ferreiro said 400 people died
and 6,810 were injured in the earthquake that registered 5.4 on the Richter
scale. The death toll is expected to rise as bodies are recovered from the
rubble.
Shamir to head government
JERUSALEM — Yitzhak Shamir, who is scheduled to take over as Israel's
prime minister this week, is an uncompromising nationalist with an almost
messianic belief that "right makes might" — a twist on the aphorism — and
a priority list that puts the Middle East peace process third, behind Israel's
economy and its national security.
Shamir, 70, an underground leader before Israel became an indepen
dent nation in 1948, is now the foreign minister and is scheduled to ex
change posts tomorrow with Prime Minister Shimon Peres, his centrist
rival who has led the government for 25 months.
As his words suggest, Shamir will bring a different emphasis and a differ
ent style to the job. The publicity-conscious Peres spent much of his term
trying to overcome what he described as an international image of Israeli
intransigence.
Reagan policies may be illegal
WASHINGTON — As long as the Reagan Administration openly encour
ages gun running in Central America, more Americans will become in
volved, killed and put on trial and the distinction will be blurred between
who's official and who isn't, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee said yesterday.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said most members of Congress feel the U.S.
government has overstepped the bounds by giving a "wink and a shrug" to
private groups supporting contra rebels seeking to overthrow the govern
ment of Nicaragua.
Congress barred military aid from the United States to the contras in
1984 but later authorized non-military aid.
The question of whether the U.S. government has gone beyond that has
come under intense scrutiny since Eugene Hasenfus, an ex-Marine who
once flew for Air America, a CIA-operated airline in Vietnam, was captured
in Nicaragua after his arms-laden plane was brought down by a Nicaraguan
missile.
Lifting Poland sanctions possible
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration is considering ending eco
nomic sanctions against Poland as a result of the Warsaw government's
recent amnesty for political prisoners, a State Department official said yes
terday.
The official said that no decision has been made, however, on final lifting
of the sanctions that were originally imposed five years ago following
Poland's declaration of martial law.
Some of the measures were repealed earlier. The most important
remaining ones are a ban on new U.S. credit guarantees and suspension of
"most-favored-nation" trade status, which provides the same low tariffs that
apply to most non-communist nations. The only communist countries cur
rently enjoying most-favored-nation status are Romania, Hungary, Yugos
lavia and China
Last month, Poland released more than 200 political prisoners, including
some of the country's best-known dissidents. At the time, U.S. officials said
that the sanctions almost certainly would be lifted provided the amnesty
was a real one.
However, one official recalled that many of the dissidents released un
der earlier amnesties were later re-arrested. The official said that Washing
ton wants to wait to make sure that procedure will not be repeated this
time.
FBI unravels Laßouche network
WASHINGTON — Federal investigators, with more than two truckloads
of seized records to sort through, are focusing on obstruction of justice
charges as they try to unravel political extremist Lyndon Laßouche's net
work of organizations.
After nearly two years of investigating what U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson
called "an organizational policy of fraud and bilking," the government last
week raided Laßouche's Virginia headquarters and indicted several of his
inner circle members, his fund-raisers and assorted corporations and com
mittees.
The government provided a broad look at its case last week in persuad
ing a federal magistrate to hold without bond two top Laßouche lieutenants
facing obstructon charges.
That evidence touched Laßouche himself, who has not been charged but
who prosecutors contend "dominates and controls" an organization
charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice.
It also shed light on what is one of the most bizarre political organiza
tions ever — whose members, according to the FBI, make late-night
harassing telephone calls to opponents and thought they could get CIA
help to "spike" a federal fraud investigation of them.
BankAmerica president chosen
SAN FRANCISCO — Former World Bank president A.W. Clausen was
named yesterday to his old job as chief executive officer for both
BankAmerica Corp. and its financially troubled Bank of America unit.
He replaces the man who was his replacement, Samuel Armacost.
Armacost, 47, announced his resignation Friday as president and chief
executive officer of the corporation after five stormy years as head of the
nation's second-largest blinking concern. He spent a total of 25 years with
the company.
Clausen, 63, left BankAmerica and Bank of America in April 1981 and
became president of the World Bank in July of that year. He retired from
the World Bank earlier this year.
Queen gets Chinese welcome
PEKING — About 1,000 children waving flowers and miniature British
and Chinese flags welcomed Queen Elizabeth II to a spruced up Peking
yesterday, the start of a six-day trip that is the first to China by a reigning
British monarch.
She will be officially welcomed this morning in a ceremony in
Tiananmen Square including a 21 gun salute, dancing children and a
People's Liberation Army honor guard.
Later she will meet President Li Xiannian before visiting the Forbidden
City, once the home of China's last emperor, overthrown in 1911, and the
circular Temple of Heaven
She also will attend a reception for British and Commonwealth guests.
