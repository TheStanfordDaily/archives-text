# Star Wars impasse ends summit
## 
### 
REYKJAVIK, Iceland — The summit
meeting between President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
collapsed last night after the two
leaders reached sweeping potential
agreements to reduce nuclear arsenals
but deadlocked on the crucial issue of
restricting the U.S. missile defense pro
gram widely known as "Star Wars."
Secretary of State George Shultz,
reporting in a strained voice on a
meeting that began with bright prom
ise and ended gloomily after more
than seven hours of negotiation yester
day, said he was "deeply disappointed"
and no longer saw "any prospect" for a
summit meeting in Washington be
tween the two leaders in the coming
months.
Gorbachev, in a news conference
last night, painted a bleak picture
of U.S.-Soviet relations and said that
the talks had "ruptured" over the fun
damental differences between the su
perpowers on SDI and the ABM treaty.
He said Reagan's insistence on deploy
ing SDI had "frustrated and scuttled"
the opportunity for an agreement.
"I said to the president that we were
missing a historic chance," Gorbachev
said. "Never had our positions been so
close together."
In his remarks before leaving
Iceland, Reagan said, however, that
"though we put on the table the most
far-reaching arms control proposal in
history, the general secretary
(Gorbachev) rejected it."
"We moved toward agreement on
drastically reduced numbers of
intermediate-range missiles in both
Europe and Asia," Reagan said. "We ap
proached agreement on sharply
reduced strategic arsenals for both our
countries. We made progress in the
area of nuclear testing, but there was
remaining at the end of our talks one

area of disagreement" — the American
SDI program.
Shultz told reporters that the two
leaders, aided by groups of experts,
had reached a contingent agreement to
eliminate all nuclear ballistic missiles
within 10 years and also had made
progress on human rights issues.
But he added that the two days of
talks here had ended without agree
ment because the Soviets insisted on a
change in the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty that would have limited
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) anti-missile program to labora
tory research.
The meeting here, which had been
billed by the Reagan administration as
only a preparatory session before a
Washington summit, turned into a full
blown summit involving marathon
meetings and extraordinary negotia
tions that moved far beyond the lim
ited agenda that officials on both sides
had suggested would be the case.
The foundering of the talks on the
missile defense issue also raises
doubts about the future of die long
running superpower negotiations on
nuclear arms at Geneva.
Instead of nuclear arms reduction,
the fate of Reagan's SDI program now
looms as the dominant issue in super
power relations. But both Shultz and
Gorbachev said the two sides would
present their arms reduction proposals
at Geneva, holding out a slim hope that
some progress could be made if the
impasse over SDI can ever be resolved.
Last night, in a one-hour-and-40-
minute news conference, Gorbachev
said he had proposed the Iceland
meeting because "we could not have
allowed the failure" of a summit in
Washington. And he indicated that he
would not agree to come to the United
States unless the deep dispute on de
fensive systems could be solved.

The two leaders met for more than
11 hours Saturday and yesterday, in
cluding an unscheduled afternoon
meeting yesterday that lasted nearly
four hours. U.S. officials said they were
hopeful last night of an agreement be
cause both sides wanted deep cuts in
offensive nuclear weapons.
"As we came more and more down
to the final stages, it became more and
more clear that the Soviet Union's ob
jective was effectively to kill off the SDI
program," Shultz said, "and to do so by

<; e pkjnp a rhanee descrihed hv them
as a strengthening, ... in the ABM
treaty that would so constrain research
permitted under it that the program
would not be able to proceed force
fully."
In a news conference here, Reagan
said, "No, there will not be another
summit in the near future that I can see
at this time. The Soviets are the ones
who refused to make the deal. It shows
them up for what they are."

SDI program.
Shultz told reporters that the two
leaders, aided by groups of experts,
had reached a contingent agreement to
eliminate all nuclear ballistic missiles
within 10 years and also had made
progress on human rights issues.
But he added that the two days of
talks here had ended without agree
ment because the Soviets insisted on a
change in the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty that would have limited
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) anti-missile program to labora
tory research.
The meeting here, which had been
billed by the Reagan administration as
only a preparatory session before a
Washington summit, turned into a full
blown summit involving marathon
meetings and extraordinary negotia
tions that moved far beyond the lim
ited agenda that officials on both sides
had suggested would be the case.
The foundering of the talks on the
missile defense issue also raises
doubts about the future of die long
running superpower negotiations on
nuclear arms at Geneva.
Instead of nuclear arms reduction,
the fate of Reagan's SDI program now
looms as the dominant issue in super
power relations. But both Shultz and
Gorbachev said the two sides would
present their arms reduction proposals
at Geneva, holding out a slim hope that
some progress could be made if the
impasse over SDI can ever be resolved.
Last night, in a one-hour-and-40-
minute news conference, Gorbachev
said he had proposed the Iceland
meeting because "we could not have
allowed the failure" of a summit in
Washington. And he indicated that he
would not agree to come to the United
States unless the deep dispute on de
fensive systems could be solved.

The two leaders met for more than
11 hours Saturday and yesterday, in
cluding an unscheduled afternoon
meeting yesterday that lasted nearly
four hours. U.S. officials said they were
hopeful last night of an agreement be
cause both sides wanted deep cuts in
offensive nuclear weapons.
"As we came more and more down
to the final stages, it became more and
more clear that the Soviet Union's ob
jective was effectively to kill off the SDI
program," Shultz said, "and to do so by

<; e pkjnp a rhanee descrihed hv them
as a strengthening, ... in the ABM
treaty that would so constrain research
permitted under it that the program
would not be able to proceed force
fully."
In a news conference here, Reagan
said, "No, there will not be another
summit in the near future that I can see
at this time. The Soviets are the ones
who refused to make the deal. It shows
them up for what they are."
