# Senators disagree on president's stand

WASHINGTON — The Republi
can chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee praised Presi
dent Reagan yesterday for holding
firm in the face of what he des
cribed as unreasonable Soviet
demands, but Democrats chided
the president for missing a historic
chance to reduce nuclear arsenals.
"President Reagan's negotiating
position in Iceland was imaginative,
generous and careful in preserving
the defense of our country and the
free world," said Sen. Richard Lugar
(R-Ind.), the committee chairman.
He said Reagan "did not blink" in
the face of a tough Soviet stance.
Sen. Gary Han (D-Colo.) said the
weekend meeting in Iceland "may
be remembered as the summit of
low expectations for arms control."
"Many of us have argued that an
unreasonable attachment to a
speculative space-based defensive

system would come to block real
progress toward arms control —
this has apparently transpired,"
Hart said. "By maintaining his com
mitment to Star Wars, the president
has rejected a proposal leading to
deep reductions and the potential
elimination of offensive nuclear
weapons."
Lugar said Gorbachev "attempted
to trap the president and put the
United States into perpetual
jeopardy" by limiting the U.S. anti
missile program to laboratory re
search and banning development
and testing.
"When faced with this cold stare
by the Soviet leader, President
Reagan did not blink," Lugar said.
Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.),
ranking Democrat on the Foreign
Relations Committee, described the
summit as "a sad day for mankind."
