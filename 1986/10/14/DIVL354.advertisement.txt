|| Volunteers in Asia provides an unparalleled opportunity for a student to
better understand this "real world." At the request of institutions in
Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, China and Korea, VIA
volunteers go to Asia to teach English or work with village-level technol
ogy. Undergraduates go for six or twelve months; people with a bach
elor's degree for one or two years.
As a volunteer, you live in an Asian setting (often as a member of an
Asian family) and become part of a local neighborhood. It can be a tough,
mind-stretching, and patience-building experience. It also brings some of
the finest friends of a lifetime - and an education not found in books or
§ within the confines of a college campus.
So, get plugged in! If you're interested in an educational experience that
will broaden your view of the world, we'd like to talk with you about Volun
teers in Asia. Come by the VIA office in the basement of the Old Union
Clubhouse (723-3228). And come hear returned volunteers describe their
VIA experience:
