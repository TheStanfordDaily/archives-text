# CHARLIE GOFEN
## Go Team! 
### 
My friend Roykus seemed down
when I met him Sunday.
"It's nothing, Charlie. It's just the
football game."
We played a good game, I
replied. Almost pulled it off.
"No, it's not that. It's Ted Turner.".
Ted Turner?
"If he hadn't picked up the game
on national TV, it would have
started early enough for me to catch
some rays. Look at me. I'm wan."
But it was an exciting game,
wasn't it?
"Sure, I must've seen 200 friends
while I was walking through the
aisles. At one point, I even got to sit
with a dozen Kappas. Yeah, it was
exciting."
But how about the plays? I saw
you cheering after Brad
Humphreys' great interception.
What is it you were yelling? "Go
team!" wasn't it?
"No, that was my dorm yelling
'Roble!' We're trying to impress the
Axe Committee by showing dorm
spirit at football games."
What a silly concept. Why cheer
for your own dormitory when
you're there to support the team?

"It's no less logical than anything
else at the game. Why does the
Band make fun of Cal during the
pregame show and USC during
halftime, even though we're playing
Washington?"
I have no idea.
"Why do students jingle their
keys at opposing teams from state
schools?"
I don't know.
"I do. The jingling used to be a
way of making fun of rich Southern
Cal students who drive fancy cars.
Now it means nothing, but the point
is, who cares?"
At least you've got to admit that
you get a little choked up when the
Band plays the Star-Spangled Ban
ner.
"Actually, a group of us sang our
own version so loudly we drowned
the Band out."
Well there's one thing we have to
agree on. With five minutes to go,
down by three, and Stanford at the
5-yard line on fourth and one, El
way's rollout play was a terrible call.
"I don't know, Charlie. I didn't
see it. It got too chilly, so I left after
the third quarter."
