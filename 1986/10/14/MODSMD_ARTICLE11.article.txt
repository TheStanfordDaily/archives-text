# Amnesty battles for human rights
## 
### AMANDA BAER 
Continuing its efforts to promote human rights
around the world, the Stanford chapter of Amnesty
International plans this year to aid campaigns against
the death penalty in Malaysia and against torture and
human rights violations in Chile.
According to Lisa Price, chairperson of the Stan
ford group, Al's campaign to free "prisoners of con
science" has resulted in the release of three out of
every four of the organization's adopted prisoners. In
Al's vernacular, prisoners of conscience are those
who have been "imprisoned for their beliefs, color,
sex, ethnic origin, language or religion'' and who
have not used nor advocated violence.
With more than 500,000 members in 150
countries, AI also campaigns for fair, prompt trials for
all political prisoners, while working against torture
and the death penalty. The organization claims to
have worked on behalf of more than 25,000
prisoners around the world during its 25-year exis
tence.
The group's success is due to the "extraordinary
time and effort" expended in ensuring that AI reports
are accurate and that the group is impartial, accord
ing to Rena Margulis, the AI regional membership co
ordinator for San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.
"Before we receive a piece (about human rights vi
olations)," Price noted, "it is well researched

They don't go on hearsay. They verify everything."
For that reason, she added, AI is well-respected in the
world.
The effectiveness of the organization, Price ex
plained, rests in understanding that governments are
vulnerable to world opinion. Margulis said negative
world opinion can have ill effects on a country's in
ternational trade.
Although AI will not directly claim credit for the
release of any prisoner, the prisoners themselves feel
AI has contributed to the improvement of their situa
tions in prison and to their releases, Price said.
The group's most common method of political
persuasion is mass letter-writing campaigns to gov
ernment officials in countries where human rights
are violated, as well as publicizing human rights
abuses and long-term adopting of specific prisoners
of conscience.
According to Price, most of the work the Stanford
AI group does involves the Urgent Action Network.
This network, she explained, seeks to aid prisoners
in immediate danger of torture or execution as well
as people held in detention and those who have dis
appeared altogether. Price said the campus group
receives new biographies weekly and writes two to
three letters a week in response.
"We might write a Czechoslovakian prisoner one
week, a prisoner in El Salvador another week and a
South African prisoner the next," Price noted.

Also, Price said, the group will undertake two spe
cial campaigns this year: one against the growing use
of the death penalty in Malaysia (Price cited the ex
ecution of two Australian drug traffickers in that
country) and another against torture and human
rights violations in Chile arising from a recently
declared state of siege by the government of Chilean
President Augusto Pinochet.
"The biggest thing is this Chile campaign
Hopefully, we will organize a big rally for it," Price
said.
Future Al-sponsored events include a Human
Rights Awareness Week to be held sometime in the
spring, Price said. Last year's Awareness Week
featured a panel discussion about the Solidarity trade
union in Poland and a speech by a former Islamic
prisoner of conscience released by Al's efforts.
Finally, the Stanford AI group plans to sponsor an
outreach program to educate students, which in
cludes showing films and inviting speakers to the
dorms, Price said.
"We would like to see people using us as a
resource for projects We have a lot of factual in
formation and literature," Price noted.
The chapter was founded 15 years ago, Price said,
and it is "one of the oldest campus groups in the
whole country." The chapter holds weekly meetings
at the Bechtel International Center.
