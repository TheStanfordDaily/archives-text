## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Drug fad overdone 
### 
With coming elections, politicians are scrambling to
find an issue that hasn't already been worked to death.
Prospective legislators are jumping on the latest band
wagon fad — the so-called war on drugs.
Politicians, regardless of the facts, are milking public
sympathy for all it's worth, implying that drugs are run
ning rampant with no end in sight. Accordingly, the
public has reached a point of near-hysteria in its
rekindled concern with drug abuse.
Rational public concern has made many people look
long and hard at this perplexing issue, and the fact is that
the drug crisis has peaked and is even on the decline.
Heroin use stopped spreading 15 years ago, and cocaine
use has remained constant since 1979, while the use of
marijuana has dropped by half since 1978, studies show.
Furthermore, there are considerably fewer new users,
indicating that the United States is on the road to a
relatively drug-free society.
Yet hysteria continues to rise, and this concern is
causing Congress to consider unwise legislation. The
public has cried for the Air Force to stop drug smug
gling and has even suggested that the military imple
ment border stations around every state, requiring every
traveler to stop for inspection. In effect, such legislation
would turn citizens against citizens.

The worst outgrowth of drug-paranoia is the reoent
fad of required drug-testing for job applicants and
employees of businesses. Legislation requiring govern
ment and military personnel to be tested has been
passed, with little, if any, regard to the Fourth Amend
ment, which protects against unlawful searches and
seizures. All of this legislation is happening too fast for
logical examination of its possible ramifications.
Unfortunately, some of these effects are just beginning
to appear in everyday life. When people start losing their
jobs over a joint smoked two months ago, or when
suspicion is aroused when an employee registers a false
positive on a drug-test, it is time to sit back and weigh the
advantages against the harms to society. It is desirable to
promote anti-drug policies, but it can be carried too far.
The government and businesses have shown that they
have no faith in their people. Old morals are twisted
when children start turning in their own parents to the
police. This type of activity does not unite a nation in its
cause against drug abuse; rather, it tears it asunder by
eliminating the foundation of trust that it was built on.
Let us not make the mistake of misdirected intentions
in our common cause against drugs. This time the enemy
is only ourselves.
