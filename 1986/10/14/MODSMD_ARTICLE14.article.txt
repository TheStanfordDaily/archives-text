# Stanford lags behind U.S. divestment effort
## 
### 
This past Friday, 15 members of the Stanford
community, including members of the Black Stu
dent Union, Stanford African Students Associa
tion, Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA), ASSU
Senate, Council of Presidents and faculty met with
President Kennedy to discuss his position on di
vestment following his recent trip to South Africa.
In the course of our conversation, President
Kennedy made it clear that, if it is up to him, Stan
ford will not follow the examples of Columbia,
Georgetown, the University of California system,
the California State Assembly and U.S. Congress
in withdrawing support for apartheid. Instead,
Kennedy seems determined to maintain U.S. cor
porate presence in South Africa indefinitely. This
is in spite of a recent statement by the Commis
sion on Investment Responsiblity (the University
committee with the task of supervising our invest
ments in South Africa) advocating quite the con
trary.

In the course of the meeting Mr. Kennedy
brought up a few points that we would like to
share with the rest of the Stanford community
and comment upon briefly. Perhaps it will show
why the rest of the country moves against apart
heid and Stanford is left behind.
Perhaps the most startling statement issued by
Mr. Kennedy concerned what he felt the South
African government and black South Africans
thought of U.S. disinvestment from their country.
He said it isn't clear that the South African govern
ment doesn't want disinvestment and that black
South Africans do.
The fact is the South African government fears
U.S. disinvestment very much. Any South African
who publicly speaks in favor of disinvestment can
be charged with treason, which carries the sen
tence of life imprisonment. The South African
government has spent millions of dollars an
nually on lobbyists and public relations cam
paigns in the United States and Europe to fight
the divestment movement.
Hostile responses by the South African govern
ment to recent U.S. sanctions should have pro
vided ample evidence for the conclusion that they
favor continued U.S. economic involvement, but
when asked about Botha's tirade after sanctions

were imposed, Kennedy avoided the issue and
simply termed Botha's action a "stupid political
move." Did Botha not make it clear that apart
heid's defenders want continued investment?
Kennedy's confusion over the stand of South
African blacks also seems unwarranted. Despite
the possible consequences, virtually all major
anti-apartheid groups and leaders in South Africa
have called for divestment. This includes the
major black trade unions, political bodies and
church groups. On December 1, 1985, at the
founding convention of COSATU (a new organi
zation of unions which represents 500,000
workers), a resolution was passed explicitly call
ing for divestment and the withdrawal of foreign
companies. Other proponents of divestment in
clude the United Democratic Front, the South
African Council of Churches and the African Na
tional Congress. Bishop Desmond Tutu, whose
opinion Kennedy used to refer to often, has also
joined the call for companies to leave South
Africa.
When pressed on this point, Kennedy argued
that this is only one side of the political spectrum.
Other groups, he argued, oppose divestment. He
named only one such group, Inkatha, which hap
pens to depend on the South African government
for military and economic support, and is led by
Chief Gastha Buthelezi, who is widely denounced
as a collaborator with the apartheid regime by all
major black leaders in South Africa.
Yet perhaps all of this evidence matters very
little to Kennedy anyway. When pressed on
whether he agrees that if South African blacks
favored divestment, Stanford should respect their
opinion and divest, Kennedy refused to make a
definite commitment. He indicated only that he
would take their opinion into serious considera
tion. The voices of the victims of Stanford's policy
seem to merit only token attention.
Almost every major poll shows that South
African blacks are overwhelmingly in favor of U.S.
disinvestment as a means of exerting pressure on
the apartheid regime. For how much longer can
we turn a deaf ear to these people in their cry for
help and still claim to be a moral institution?
At one point, President Kennedy admitted that
the sum total of all U.S. corporations operating in
South Africa probably had a net negative effect on
the blacks of South Africa. Yet between 1977 and
the spring of 1985, Stanford did not divest one

penny from any corporation doing business in
South Africa. Only after direct pressure from the
Stanford community was any action ever taken to
divest. As it stands, Stanford has divested less than
half of 1 percent of its holdings in companies that
operate in South Africa.
The South African government itself provides
the best evidence for the argument that apart
heid's defenders favor continued U.S. corporate
investment. One former South African prime
minister, J.B. Vorster, admitted, "Each trade
agreement, each bank loan, each new investment
is another brick in the wall of our continued exis
tence."
To further confuse the issue, President Ken
nedy said one of our main weapons for causing
corporate withdrawal from South Africa is setting
a deadline for companies to disinvest if apartheid
has not ended. In an open letter to the Stanford
community in May 1985, Kennedy stated: "Bishop
Tutu has said that unless the system is being dis
mantled within two years, he will urge foreign
companies to leave. I believe that timetable is fair
and reasonable, and that it can be made a rallying
point for those who wish to use economic influ
ence constructively rather than discard it" (Daily,
May 1985).
Since then, the level of oppression in South
Africa, as evidenced by the recent state of emer
gency, has caused Archbishop Tutu to call for im
mediate U.S. disinvestment. At the meeting,
however, President Kennedy indicated he would
neither adhere to Tutu's present position nor to
the deadline he promised in 1985. He explained
that since the situation in South Africa has wor
sened, he sees it as necessary to extend that
deadline for disinvestment to give apartheid a
little longer to reform itself.
We would like to ask, what is the good of set
ting a deadline when you don't stick to it? If we
reward the South African government by easing
outside pressure every time it escalates its violent
tactics, what message are we sending to the apart
heid regime?
Perhaps the most disconcerting part of the
meeting was what Council of Presidents member
Kim Crawford termed a "subtle but fundamental
shift." In previous years, Stanford joined other in
stitutions in pursuing a policy that basically said:
"Apartheid is wrong, but we want to stay in there
and force apartheid to reform. If the South

African government refuses to reform and it
seems that we are having no impact in moving
toward the dismantling of apartheid, we will
divest." Many set May 1987 as the deadline for di
vestment.
Kennedy's statements of last Friday indicate
that he was never sincere in this approach. As the
situation in South Africa has deteriorated and the
government has become increasingly intran
sigent, few continue to speak of the possibility of
reform. Public and private institutions have in
creasingly been saying "enough is enough" and
divesting. Instead, Kennedy has decided to give
apartheid a little more time.
He continually emphasized corporate contri
butions to building a "post-revolutionary soci
ety." This indicates to us that Kennedy plans on
advocating that companies stay in South Africa up
to and through the end of apartheid. If this is true,
it means that Stanford has completely abandoned
its goal — if this goal ever was sincere — of
seeking to pressure the South African govern
ment to end apartheid.
Today the Board of Trustees meet. Total divest
ment is not on their agenda. Two companies with
particularly distasteful practices are. We ask all
concerned members of the Stanford community
to join us in calling for Stanford to withdraw its
support of apartheid, starting with these two com
panies and culminating in total divestment. The
only way we can make the administration listen is
to stand up and be heard.
And what are we calling for? The Commission
on Investment Responsibility in June 1986 outline
a proposed policy: "These arguments lead us to
recommend that the University use all channels
of communication between ourselves and the
leaders of American companies doing business in
South Africa to make known their intention to dis
invest from South Africa if apartheid continues
and if the government of South Africa remains
adament in its refusal to negotiate a transition to
full political citizenship with legitimate black
leaders."
We call for the Board of Trustees to follow this
recommendation and issue a deadline for com
panies to pull out of South Africa.

Motamedi on behalf of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA).
