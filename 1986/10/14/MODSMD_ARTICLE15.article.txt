# The 						Invisible
## Girl experiences the Farm 
### 
When the Invisible Girl — my freshman roommate
— first came to Stanford, Dean Fred was the dean of
admissions. Asked on an application to "one of those
schools back East" to describe herself in one word,
she naturally put "invisible." Asked what one posses
sion she would save if the house were on fire, she
said her purple sunglasses, because purple was the
only color that managed to remain visible on her,
and without them the firemen might trample her or
drown her with the hose. Although she lived within

the required 500 miles of many East Coast schools,
she refused to go to any interviews, a fact to which
many schools did not take kindly. I.G. w;ts perfectly
willing to go to them, but her adopted mother wasn't
so sure it would he a good idea. So the Stanford ap
plication, when it came, was a welcome remission —
no interview required, or frankly even possible. The
year we were freshman, the question had been,
"What one person would you choose to meet if you
could go back in time?" 1 chose Oscar Wilde. The In
visible Girl chose H.G. Wells. "Because he under
stood invisibility," she wrote. To fill the rest of the
page, she wrote about invisibility as a way of life.
"Great!" wrote Dean Fred on my letter of acceptance.
On the Invisible Girl's he wrote, "Fascinating Meta
phor."
"Metaphor?" said the Invisible Girl to her adopted
mother
"Yes, dear, a simile without 'like' or as.' "
But I digress. I'm telling you about my old
roommate and dear friend because 1 have recently
been doing some thinking about the whole question
of roommates I met I.G. at the Coffee House last
week for cappucino. (She does have a name, but it Is
not easy to pronounce or even spell in most earth

languages. The closest approximation I've ever heard
of it was by a native speaker of Welsh.) She breezed
in late, saying she'd been waiting for the telephone
outside. She was waiting to place a call to Pacific Bell
to beg them not to disconnect her phone and had
overheard a girl calling her parents, presumably col
lea, to complain about her new roommate.
"Poor thing," she said. "You'd never know it to
look at her. I mean, she's nice. She's a nice girl. But,
she listens to heavy metal ... you know, that music
that's just noise— I think her parents sent her here
to dry up or something. What? Oh, they're going
OK The girl obviously lost interest when they
started asking her about her classes. I was going to
tell her to buy earplugs, but I thought she might have
resented my listening."
That last comment represents a lot to me — a
whole year's worth of living with her first visible
roommate. I.G. and I are great friends now, but it
wasn't always this way. In fact, we disliked each other
on sight — as it were. We never thought we would
make it til December, let alone the rest of our time at
Stanford. Basically, she thought I was boring, and I
thought she was sneaky Here are a tew examples:
She never could understand why I was afraid to take
the late bus home alone from San Francisco if I
missed the 10 o'clock train. "No one will bother
you," she would say, amazed. Of course, no one
would ever do anything to her — she had a tendency
to spook people out — and if she ever were to worry,
all she had to do would be to take off her sunglasses
and her purple gloves. Or, if she were really dressed
up, she could take off her satin purple blouse — to
become perfectly safe. And I was overly resentful that
she could be in the room overhearing my phone
conversations without my knowing it, or be present
at what I thought were private meetings. She reason
ably pointed out that it was her room too, she had a
key, and it was a bit much to ask her to wear sun
glasses in her own room. "You could say some
thing," I said. "Make some noise and let me know
you're around.'' She replied that she always did, un
less she were taking a nap.
First rule of successful roommating: mutual trust.
Eventually I did stop feeling her covers every time I
went into the room, but it took a while. Second rule

of successful roommating: expect a trying experi
ence. Try some new things. Try to get along. Try not
to go crazy. It can even be good for you.
I.G. and I were disappointed in each other when
we first met, but having her for a roommate turned
out to be one of the best things that ever happened to
me. I learned to be more spontaneous, less afraid; I
learned to wear purple lipstick. With me, a less ob
vious side of her would show up — the quiet,
thoughtful side, a girl who worries what people
thought of her and, just like everyone else,
sometimes wondered if she really fit in. She cheered
me up, and I calmed her down.
Not every random pairing will necessarily turn out
so well. Third rule of successful roommating: Forget
the stories Ma Bell proliferates of roommates calling
each other when they're 70. You'll end up over
whelmed, not intimate. Let the friendship develop
naturally. It was a wonderful day for me when I
realized I no longer needed to look to know if I.G.
were in the room. I was finally able to see beyond
her "image." Speaking of "image:" First impressions
are often wrong. Tastes change. When the Invisible
Girl and I came back from Rome last December, she
was into acoustic music — Suzanne Vega, the Roches.
I wasn't as surprised as some other people were —
people who didn't know her so well.
Values are important, though. Not values as in
politics — that's often simply another taste — but
personal values. Whether a person is open-minded
or intolerant, flexible or set in his ways, easy-going or
highly-strung. These are some of the kinds of
qualities that will ultimately make or break a
friendship, and they are the qualities you may not be
able to see right away. Kindness. Compassion.
Humour. But don't feel too bad if you're not good
friends. Maybe it just wasn't meant to be. It was, after
all, a random pairing.
"I wonder if there's any hope for those two," I said
to the Invisible Girl. She shook her head, purple ear
rings floating back and forth. "Time will tell,' she
said.
Good luck, all you new roommates.
