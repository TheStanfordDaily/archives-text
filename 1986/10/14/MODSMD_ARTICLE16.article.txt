Stanford women
calendar exposes
equivalent harms
Daily columnist Scott Shaeffer
claims that the "Women of Stanford"
calendar can cause bulimia and
suicide (Daily, Oct. 9) and should not
be sold at the Stanford Bookstore. He
made some lengthy arguments and
suggested throwing out such calen
dars.
I did, leaving a big, white gap on
the wall above my desk. I then went to
the Bookstore looking for something
that could cover that big, white gap. In
the calendar section, I found
"Obsession" â€” 13 months of
anonymous, female body parts. Inter
esting and stimulating, but also capa
ble of causing "low intellectual
growth." Leaving "Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Calendar 1987" and others
for someone else to buy, I thought of
getting a book to stand on my desk.
I didn't buy "Huckleberry Finn"
(too derogatory), or "Nudes" by
Edward Weston (unclothed women as
"photographic objects" in meaning
less poses), or "The Jewish American
Prince Handbook" (teeming with
defamatory stereotypes), or "Beer
Drinking Games" (useless; University
policy prohibits these games), or
"History of White People in America"
parts I and II (racist) or "Mein Kampf'
(about as racist they come). Scott
would make me throw out any one of
those, so I looked for a harmless,
decorative object.
After an employee recommended a
"Stanford shot glass" (Stanford associ
ated with alcohol), I gave up and went
home. The big, white gap is now
covered by Scott's editorial.
