## The 						trailers that would not die Manzanita marks 17th year 
### JON SHERMAN 
All too often people are repulsed by
that which, on the surface, is unusual
and perhaps ugly, and yet has deeper
beauty which only the truly "clued"
may appreciate.
On Sept. 11, 1969, F.E. Gallagher Jr.,
director of Escondido Village and Peter
Burchyns, director of Manzanita Park
invited the community to "come see
the University's newest residences."

'Sometimes they die
in there and smell.'

Though Manzanita had a projected
lifespan of only four years, Gallagher
and Burchyns refrained from using the
term "temporary" in describing the
Park — and with good reason.
It was built in just 120 days to ease
the undergraduate housing shortage
the University then faced, and 16 years
have passed since the completion of
the 450-resident complex. Residential
Education has no plans for the Man
zanita Park Trailers until at least 1990.
The question is, then, why are the
porta-houses still here?
One reason, according to Terry
McGovern, manager of University
Housing Facilities Projects, is that the
trailers are economically sound. The
original $1.3 million investment that
Stanford had hoped to gain back by
selling the trailers has been repaid
and, as a result, income from the
trailers exceeds expenses and aids
residences which run at a loss.

Addressing the question of Manza
nita's economy of space, Rodger Whit
ney, director of housing, concedes that
a traditional dormitory, were it to l)e
built on the space the trailers currently
occupy, would house a greater num
ber of students. "But," says Whitney,
"as long as Manzanita Park is operating
as viable housing and is a popular
choice among students, we have no
formal plans for its future."
The trailers originally held only un
dergraduate students. The completion
of Governor's Corner in 1982,
howe/er, eased the residential over
crowding. Today, Manzanita's popula
tion is 75 percent graduate students.
As the park opened, a disgruntled
student resentfully termed Manzanita
"admittedly better than a tent city in
Frost Amphitheatre, which would
cause all sorts of social diseases." Less
than one month later, a resident called
the park "the greatest thing since crea
tion." It might not be quite that won
derful, but for the most part, current
residents seem pleased.
Ann Scheck, a Manzanita resident as
sistant, enjoys living in the trailers and
has done so for the past two years. She
says that at least part of her affinity for
the trailers stems from the certain ad
vantages which Manzanita provides:
Each resident has a private bedrcxim,
and each trailer has a living room, a
kitchen and a dining room.
In addition, residents have their
choice where and when they eat. "The
trailers are a lot like the suites across
campus," says Aimee Berg, a
resident of the park, "except that
they're made of tin."
The trailers are by no means a

Utopian way of life; disadvantages
unique to Manzanita exist as well.
Berg, commenting on the social sit
uation in Manzanita, finds the
graduate-to-undergraduate ratio "a bit
disgruntling. You don t meet as many
of your peers. Also, a lot of social life is
missed because you're not forced to
walk by people's doors and mingle;

you have to make a special effort."
Social life inside the trailers is a bit
easier. "You can hold a conversation
through the walls," says Scheck, "but
you learn to sleep heavier."
She adds that ants are also a prob
lem, because "they like to come in
doors when it rains."
"It's quite a wildlife refuge," agrees

Berg. "There are holes in the founda
tion below the trailer which cats can
get into, and sometimes they die in
there and smell."
Another rather disconcerting fact
about the trailers is their flammability.
Like any other mobile home, trailers
pose a fire hazard. In 1980, one burned
to the ground in 10 minutes.

Aside from these and other minor
drawbacks (including the fact that they
have less than no aesthetic value: "It
looks like Winnebago farm," says
Berg), the trailers are a rather attractive
place to live for a student who desires
a more quiet living area. Those who
desire a more attractive campus will
have to wait until 1990.

The original 1969 architect's blueprint of Manzanita trailer park proves yet again that some things look better on paper.
All too often people are repulsed by
that which, on the surface, is unusual
and perhaps ugly, and yet has deeper
beauty which only the truly "clued"
may appreciate.
On Sept. 11, 1969, F.E. Gallagher Jr.,
director of Escondido Village and Peter
Burchyns, director of Manzanita Park
invited the community to "come see
the University's newest residences."

'Sometimes they die
in there and smell.'

Though Manzanita had a projected
lifespan of only four years, Gallagher
and Burchyns refrained from using the
term "temporary" in describing the
Park — and with good reason.
It was built in just 120 days to ease
the undergraduate housing shortage
the University then faced, and 16 years
have passed since the completion of
the 450-resident complex. Residential
Education has no plans for the Man
zanita Park Trailers until at least 1990.
The question is, then, why are the
porta-houses still here?
One reason, according to Terry
McGovern, manager of University
Housing Facilities Projects, is that the
trailers are economically sound. The
original $1.3 million investment that
Stanford had hoped to gain back by
selling the trailers has been repaid
and, as a result, income from the
trailers exceeds expenses and aids
residences which run at a loss.

Addressing the question of Manza
nita's economy of space, Rodger Whit
ney, director of housing, concedes that
a traditional dormitory, were it to l)e
built on the space the trailers currently
occupy, would house a greater num
ber of students. "But," says Whitney,
"as long as Manzanita Park is operating
as viable housing and is a popular
choice among students, we have no
formal plans for its future."
The trailers originally held only un
dergraduate students. The completion
of Governor's Corner in 1982,
howe/er, eased the residential over
crowding. Today, Manzanita's popula
tion is 75 percent graduate students.
As the park opened, a disgruntled
student resentfully termed Manzanita
"admittedly better than a tent city in
Frost Amphitheatre, which would
cause all sorts of social diseases." Less
than one month later, a resident called
the park "the greatest thing since crea
tion." It might not be quite that won
derful, but for the most part, current
residents seem pleased.
Ann Scheck, a Manzanita resident as
sistant, enjoys living in the trailers and
has done so for the past two years. She
says that at least part of her affinity for
the trailers stems from the certain ad
vantages which Manzanita provides:
Each resident has a private bedrcxim,
and each trailer has a living room, a
kitchen and a dining room.
In addition, residents have their
choice where and when they eat. "The
trailers are a lot like the suites across
campus," says Aimee Berg, a
resident of the park, "except that
they're made of tin."
The trailers are by no means a

Utopian way of life; disadvantages
unique to Manzanita exist as well.
Berg, commenting on the social sit
uation in Manzanita, finds the
graduate-to-undergraduate ratio "a bit
disgruntling. You don t meet as many
of your peers. Also, a lot of social life is
missed because you're not forced to
walk by people's doors and mingle;

you have to make a special effort."
Social life inside the trailers is a bit
easier. "You can hold a conversation
through the walls," says Scheck, "but
you learn to sleep heavier."
She adds that ants are also a prob
lem, because "they like to come in
doors when it rains."
"It's quite a wildlife refuge," agrees

Berg. "There are holes in the founda
tion below the trailer which cats can
get into, and sometimes they die in
there and smell."
Another rather disconcerting fact
about the trailers is their flammability.
Like any other mobile home, trailers
pose a fire hazard. In 1980, one burned
to the ground in 10 minutes.

Aside from these and other minor
drawbacks (including the fact that they
have less than no aesthetic value: "It
looks like Winnebago farm," says
Berg), the trailers are a rather attractive
place to live for a student who desires
a more quiet living area. Those who
desire a more attractive campus will
have to wait until 1990.
