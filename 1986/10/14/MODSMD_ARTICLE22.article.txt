# Frenzied students have someone to turn to
## Sophomores search for their advisers with the help of the Undergraduate Advising Center 
### KATHY LACHENAUER 
When study lists were due last Friday, sopho
mores realized that their advisers were no
longer there to pamper them.
At scheduled meetings and dinners, advisers,
resident fellows, resident associates and advis
ing associates guided first-year students
through the process of filing a study list of fall
quarter courses. By Friday, freshmen had little
trouble filling out these lists and obtaining their
advisers' signatures.
Undeclared sophomores, on the other hand,
were frantic. They had the same advisers from
their freshmen year and needed to obtain their
signatures so their study lists would be ap
proved. They searched vacated offices and
spent hours on the phone hoping to track
down their long-lost advisers.
Others abandoned the search for their ad
visers were assigned to last year. Second-year
Less daring sophomores went to the Under
graduate Advising Center in Sweet Hall to have
their study lists approved.
Problems arose because sophomores no

longer lived in the freshmen dorm their ad
visers were assigned to last year. Second-year
students could not simply stroll down to a
dorm dinner and find their advisers waiting for
them with pen in hand.
Dara Denels found out how difficult it was
for some sophomores to track down their ad
visers. "I've left messages on three different
answering machines but can't find her," Denels
said. Her adviser did not have an office on
campus, and a frustrated Denels said she felt
awkward about having to track her down.
Faced with a situation similar to Denels',
sophomore Caroline Mosley admitted that
advising problems were nothing new for her.
According to Mosley, her adviser only came to
one of the numerous dinners and adviser func
tions scheduled during the freshmen year. Mos
ley, a pre-med student, said that her adviser
helped her with career plans because he was a
surgeon but was "not helpful with classes or
curriculum."
Jose Garay, a sophomore transfer student
from Yale, never even met his adviser. During
orientation, Garay was assigned a table where

he could go and find his adviser. But "there
were too many people— I couldn't find it,"
Garay said.
Although Garay said he is very satisfied with
his switch to Stanford, he considered the Yale
advising system to be "a lot more sensible." At

'It's getting to the point
where sophomores
would rather declare a
major.'

Yale, a master of the college sought out Garay
and proved to be a helpful and personal coun
selor, Garay explained.
Not all Stanford advisers were as elusive as
Garay's. Sophomore Paul Silvestre said his advi
ser gave him six different telephone numbers
so Silvestre could be assured of reaching him.
These numbers included an office phone, a

home phone, an emergency number and a
number with a secret dial-in code for leaving
messages.
Silvestre joked about the confusion of such
an elaborate phone system. "It's getting to the
point where sophomores would rather just
declare a major" than have to cope with the
complications of the advising program, Sil
vestre said.
Audrey Bernfield, director of Stanford's Un
dergraduate Advising Program, said that the
advising center is especially geared towards un
declared sophomores — who make up three
fourths of the entire sophomore class.
For the past two weeks Bernfield helped
sophomores locate their missing advisers.
When advisers could not be found or if sopho
mores were unsatisfied with their advice, they
could turn to Bernfield and her staff of profes
sional counselors for help.
"We are here to help students redefine their
thoughts" about college and will keep counsel
ing them until they declare a major, Bernfield
said.
According to Bernfield, many sophomores

considered coming to her office simply a mat
ter of red tape. Sophomores wanted their study
lists signed without any academic counseling.
But with nine years of Stanford advising experi
ence, grilling questions and frank advice,
Bernfield dispelled students' misconceptions.
For example, sophomore Chris Davis came
into the advising center merely hoping for a
signature on his study list. After talking to
Bernfield he realized how helpful advising can
be for an undeclared sophomore. "She let me
know what's out there, and before I make any
more decisions about a major, I'm going to go
talk to her again," said Davis.
Despite Bernfield's own luck with advising
second year students, she admitted that
"sophomore advising is never going to be per
fect." Bernfield said there was a mixed bag of
wonderful and enthusistic advisers and others
who were not so good.
Whether a sophomore had a good adviser or
not, Bernfield said she believes "everybody (all
sophomores) should sooner or later stop by
(the Undergraduate Advising Center). A
second opinion can't hurt."

be for an undeclared sophomore. "She let me
know what's out there, and before I make any
more decisions about a major, I'm going to go
talk to her again," said Davis.
Despite Bernfield's own luck with advising
second year students, she admitted that
"sophomore advising is never going to be per
fect." Bernfield said there was a mixed bag of
wonderful and enthusistic advisers and others
who were not so good.
Whether a sophomore had a good adviser or
not, Bernfield said she believes "everybody (all
sophomores) should sooner or later stop by
(the Undergraduate Advising Center). A
second opinion can't hurt."
When study lists were due last Friday, sopho
mores realized that their advisers were no
longer there to pamper them.
At scheduled meetings and dinners, advisers,
resident fellows, resident associates and advis
ing associates guided first-year students
through the process of filing a study list of fall
quarter courses. By Friday, freshmen had little
trouble filling out these lists and obtaining their
advisers' signatures.
Undeclared sophomores, on the other hand,
were frantic. They had the same advisers from
their freshmen year and needed to obtain their
signatures so their study lists would be ap
proved. They searched vacated offices and
spent hours on the phone hoping to track
down their long-lost advisers.
Others abandoned the search for their ad
visers were assigned to last year. Second-year
Less daring sophomores went to the Under
graduate Advising Center in Sweet Hall to have
their study lists approved.
Problems arose because sophomores no

longer lived in the freshmen dorm their ad
visers were assigned to last year. Second-year
students could not simply stroll down to a
dorm dinner and find their advisers waiting for
them with pen in hand.
Dara Denels found out how difficult it was
for some sophomores to track down their ad
visers. "I've left messages on three different
answering machines but can't find her," Denels
said. Her adviser did not have an office on
campus, and a frustrated Denels said she felt
awkward about having to track her down.
Faced with a situation similar to Denels',
sophomore Caroline Mosley admitted that
advising problems were nothing new for her.
According to Mosley, her adviser only came to
one of the numerous dinners and adviser func
tions scheduled during the freshmen year. Mos
ley, a pre-med student, said that her adviser
helped her with career plans because he was a
surgeon but was "not helpful with classes or
curriculum."
Jose Garay, a sophomore transfer student
from Yale, never even met his adviser. During
orientation, Garay was assigned a table where

he could go and find his adviser. But "there
were too many people— I couldn't find it,"
Garay said.
Although Garay said he is very satisfied with
his switch to Stanford, he considered the Yale
advising system to be "a lot more sensible." At

'It's getting to the point
where sophomores
would rather declare a
major.'

Yale, a master of the college sought out Garay
and proved to be a helpful and personal coun
selor, Garay explained.
Not all Stanford advisers were as elusive as
Garay's. Sophomore Paul Silvestre said his advi
ser gave him six different telephone numbers
so Silvestre could be assured of reaching him.
These numbers included an office phone, a

home phone, an emergency number and a
number with a secret dial-in code for leaving
messages.
Silvestre joked about the confusion of such
an elaborate phone system. "It's getting to the
point where sophomores would rather just
declare a major" than have to cope with the
complications of the advising program, Sil
vestre said.
Audrey Bernfield, director of Stanford's Un
dergraduate Advising Program, said that the
advising center is especially geared towards un
declared sophomores — who make up three
fourths of the entire sophomore class.
For the past two weeks Bernfield helped
sophomores locate their missing advisers.
When advisers could not be found or if sopho
mores were unsatisfied with their advice, they
could turn to Bernfield and her staff of profes
sional counselors for help.
"We are here to help students redefine their
thoughts" about college and will keep counsel
ing them until they declare a major, Bernfield
said.
According to Bernfield, many sophomores

considered coming to her office simply a mat
ter of red tape. Sophomores wanted their study
lists signed without any academic counseling.
But with nine years of Stanford advising experi
ence, grilling questions and frank advice,
Bernfield dispelled students' misconceptions.
For example, sophomore Chris Davis came
into the advising center merely hoping for a
signature on his study list. After talking to
Bernfield he realized how helpful advising can
be for an undeclared sophomore. "She let me
know what's out there, and before I make any
more decisions about a major, I'm going to go
talk to her again," said Davis.
Despite Bernfield's own luck with advising
second year students, she admitted that
"sophomore advising is never going to be per
fect." Bernfield said there was a mixed bag of
wonderful and enthusistic advisers and others
who were not so good.
Whether a sophomore had a good adviser or
not, Bernfield said she believes "everybody (all
sophomores) should sooner or later stop by
(the Undergraduate Advising Center). A
second opinion can't hurt."
