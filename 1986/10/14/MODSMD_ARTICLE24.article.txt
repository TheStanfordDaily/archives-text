## Med Center opens high-tech diagnostic lab 
### DAVID LIPPEATT 
A new laboratory for research in the field of magnetic
resonance imaging has been set up at Stanford University
Medical Center to honor the memory of the late Felix Bloch,
Stanford University's first Nobel laureate.
The laboratory, known as the Felix Bloch Laboratory for
Research in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, was dedicated
Oct. 3 in a private ceremony at the Medical Center. Its con
struction resulted from a gift made by Rhoda and Elliot
Levinthal. Elliot Leventhal was a student of Bloch's in the
19405.
Bloch, whose career as a physics professor at Stanford
spanned the years from 1934 until his death in 1983, shared
the 1952 Nobel Prize in physics with Edward Purcell for
their independent discovery of the phenomenon that pro
vides the theoretical underpinning of the Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) process.
MRI, a non-invasive, non-hazardous technique for
producing images of specified sections of the v body, is
thought to be one of the most important advances in diag
nostic medical imaging since the X-ray was introduced.
MRI is based on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
phenomenon discovered by Bloch and Purcell. Bloch and
his students later built upon these pioneering experiments
and made a profound impact on chemistry and biology with
their discovery of the "chemical shift," which allows the
nondestructive analysis of chemical and biochemical ma
terial.
Bloch participated in the development of both the first
commercial NMR instrumentation and early clinical MRI
machines, according to Levinthal.
In MRI, the patient is placed between the poles of what is
basically an ordinary electromagnet surrounded with an RF
antenna, according to Dr. Leslie Zatz, professor of radiology
who has been appointed director of the laboratory. Mag
netic field pulses from the device cause nuclei of atoms in
the body possessing a property known as "spin" to align by
flipping the axis of this "spin." When the pulses stop, the

nuclei relax by flipping back to their original configuration
and release radio waves in the process. These waves are
then processed to produce images of internal body
structures.
"The potentials of MRI have only been scratched so far,"
Zatz said. The technique promises to provide highly
detailed medical information in areas as diverse as psychia
try, oncology, neonatology and cardiology, and, since it in
volves no radiation, it is less risky than X-rays, he said.
The only hazard, Zatz added, would be to those patients
who either wear pacemakers, which would react adversely
to the MRI machine's magnetic field, or have iron implants
in their bodies, which would twist when the machine is on.
Another benefit of MRI, according to Zatz, is that, because
the imaging techiques are so different, "some diseases show

up much more selectively on MRI than X-rays."
The laboratory's main component is a Resonex MRI scan
ner, an innovative new machine which provides "a flexible
system that's very convenient for research," Zatz said.
The laboratory, housed in the Medical School's Depart
ment of Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, pro
vides a valuable MRI facility within the Medical School that
can be devoted exclusively to MRI research, according to
department chairman Dr. Ronald Castellino.
"We are particularly delighted that the laboratory will
honor professor Bloch in view of his enormous contribu
tions to this technology," Castellino added.
Elliot Levinthal, who was himself associated with the
Medical School for 20 years, concurred.
"Felix was particularly moved that his idea had such
broad applications, especially to the medical field. It is quite

fitting that he be honored at the Medical School," Levinthal
said.
The new laboratory will serve as a clinical research facility
to explore new applications of MRI in medicine. In this area,
older MRI units are already in use in clinical practice at the
Palo Alto Clinic and El Camino Hospital.
The Bloch lab will serve as the first test site for the new
Resonex machine, which is "flexible, with changeable
features," and is "so small that it can be located in an exist
ing lab without new construction," said Zatz.
The Resonex device is built so that the magnetism is
confined to a very small area. This feature makes it possible
to work close to the unit.
"This may be helpful in studies of small infants or very
sick individuals who need to be monitored," Zatz con
cluded.

honor professor Bloch in view of his enormous contribu
tions to this technology," Castellino added.
Elliot Levinthal, who was himself associated with the
Medical School for 20 years, concurred.
"Felix was particularly moved that his idea had such
broad applications, especially to the medical field. It is quite

fitting that he be honored at the Medical School," Levinthal
said.
The new laboratory will serve as a clinical research facility
to explore new applications of MRI in medicine. In this area,
older MRI units are already in use in clinical practice at the
Palo Alto Clinic and El Camino Hospital.
The Bloch lab will serve as the first test site for the new
Resonex machine, which is "flexible, with changeable
features," and is "so small that it can be located in an exist
ing lab without new construction," said Zatz.
The Resonex device is built so that the magnetism is
confined to a very small area. This feature makes it possible
to work close to the unit.
"This may be helpful in studies of small infants or very
sick individuals who need to be monitored," Zatz con
cluded.
