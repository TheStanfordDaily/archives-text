## Stanford's effort impresses Elway 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Cardinal may have lost
to Washington on Saturday, but the
Cardinal obviously impressed some
people watching on national cable
television. Hoping for more of the
same, CBS announced that it will carry
the Stanford-USC game in two weeks
to 80 percent of the country. Game
time has been moved up to 12:40 p.m.
The Cardinal didn't impress the
coaches who vote in the United Press
International poll, though. The Card
inal fell out of the UPI Top 20 after
having been ranked No. 17 the previ
ous week. The USA Today/CNN poll
dropped Stanford from No. 18 to No.
20. The Associated Press will release its
poll this morning.
The Cardinal also impressed Stan
ford Coach Jack Elway. "They should
come out with a good feeling," he said.
"They stood there with the best in the
country and played with them. They
ought to know they're damn good.
We've played in five football games
and have not played in an emotional
valley yet. You play so well, and you
don't win the football game. It's a good
learning experience."
"We learned we don't like to lose,"
was all center Andy Sinclair could
think of. Then he allowed: "At no point
in the game were we intimidated. We

were excited to be playing them. We
wanted to get back into the game. We
stayed with them, and we blocked
them. They're great athletes."
According to Elway's favorite for
mula, the Cardinal stayed even on of
fense and defense against the Huskies.
The special teams, though, saw kicker
David Sweeney miss two field goals of
39 and 40 yards when the Cardinal was
trailing 17-14.
"It's frustrating," Elway said. "We're
going to stay with David. A lot of kick
ers are obsessed with how far they can
kick. Accuracy is the key â€” then you
have something you can bank on. Why
we stress accuracy is that our observa
tion in practice is that he hasn't been
that consistent."
The Cardinal defense turned in an
other fine effort, led by linebacker
David Wyman. One of 16 finalists for
the Dick Butkus Trophy, presented an
nually to the best linebacker in the
country, Wyman had a career-high 20
tackles Saturday to give him a team
leading 77 through five games.
The loss dropped Stanford to 1-1 in
Pacific 10 Conference play and left it as
one of six teams with one conference
loss. Only Arizona State at 2-0-1 is un
defeated.

grab gave Stanford an early 7-0 lead.
10 matchups and 2-4 overall, needing a
victory to keep a place in the Rose
Bowl race. Arizona (1-1) and UCLA (1-
1) have easy games against Oregon
State and California, while USC (2-1)
hosts first-place Arizona State. Wash
ington (2-1) plays Bowling Green in a
non-conference game, and Washington
State (2-1-1) has the week off.
Card notes
Representatives from the Freedom and
Holiday Bowls were in attendance at Satur
day's game. The Freedom Bowl is played at
Anaheim Stadium, the Holiday Bowl at San
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Both games
are Dec. 30, the Tuesday after Christmas.
Senior quarterback John Paye moved
into sixth place on the all-time Pac-10 total
offense list with 372 yards of total offense
Saturday. Paye now has 6,477 yards, just 23
yards behind former Cal quarterback Rich
Campbell in fifth. Paye is also No. 2 in the
conference this season in total offense with
225.6 yards per game, and No. 3 in passing,
with 235 6 yards per game.
Junior running back Brad Muster
became Stanford's third-leading receiver
with 11 receptions Saturday to give him 143
for his career. He passed the Dallas Cow
boys' Tony Hill and the Chicago Bears'
Ken Margerum. Muster is the Pac-10
leader in receptions this season with 34,
fourth-best in the nation. He's also first in
the conference in all-purpose running at
132.2 yards per game.
