# Offense comes up just short against Huskies
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Saturday's 24-14 Washington victory over
Stanford was a game of ironies and a game of
inches, and Cardinal quarterback John Paye was
in the middle of it all.
The 6-foot-3 senior completed 28 of 47
passes for 364 yards and two touchdowns. But
the statistics don't fully explain Paye's perfor
mance. It was the manner in which he was able
to move the Cardinal offense — scrambling
away from the Husky defense and throwing
across his body — that impressed everyone on
hand.

"l thought John did a great job," Washington
Coach Don James said after the game. "He wore
us out."
The Stanford offense had been criticized
prior to the Washington game for its lack of
productivity against lesser opponents. The team
had scored just 17 points against both Oregon
State and San Diego State.
The Cardinal answered most of its critics Sat
urday, however, compiling 433 total yards
against a defense that rates with the nation's
best.
On its third possession, Stanford moved the
ball 71 yards on eight plays to take a 7-0 lead.
Paye's 29-yard completion to Brad Muster set

up an 11-yard scoring strike to Eric Snelson on
the following play.
The Cardinal's other touchdown was also a
product of the right arm of Paye. With 4:13
remaining in the first half and the score 7-7,
Stanford took the ball at its own 45 following a
Washington punt. Paye wasted no time in
moving the Cardinal downfield, completing
consecutive passes to Snelson, Thomas Henley
and Kevin Scott to put the ball at the Husky 11.
Following an unsuccessful pitch play to
Muster and an incomplete pass, Stanford was
faced with a seemingly impossible third-and-18
situation, but Paye displayed both patience and
a strong arm in completing a 19-yard touch

down pass to Jeff James.
On that play, the Husky defense forced Paye
out of the pocket, chased him toward the right
sideline and narrowly missed sacking him. As
he was scrambling, Paye spotted James continu
ing his pattern across the middle and threw a
strike across his body that brought most of the
crowd of 52,000 to its feet.
"I was flushed out of the pocket, rolled right,
and I saw him," Paye said. "That's usually a dan
gerous pass."
Despite Paye's individual heroics, when Stan
ford fans think back to Saturday's game, before
they talk about Paye, they surely will remember
it as the game that the Cardinal could have and

should have won.
What is most frustrating and ironic about the
game for Stanford fans is that the Stanford of
fense dominated a strong defense, yet came
away with fewer points than it had scored when
the offense was supposedly sputtering in previ
ous weeks.
"I think the whole game their defense didn't
stop our offense," Jeff James said.
That statement must infer that the Cardinal
stopped itself. And indeed, that was the case.
Not only did kicker David Sweeney miss two
field goals within his range, but at least two
