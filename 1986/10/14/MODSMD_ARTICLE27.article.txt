in the 5,000-meter race with a time of
18:01.0. Junior Kathy Smith also placed
in the top 20, crossing the finish line in
18:31-5 for 18th place.

Stevens, 25th.
The men's squad also finished lower
than usual, placing fifth in a field of 24
schools.

completing the 8,400-meter course in
25:49.6. Central Arizona's Mark Roberts
