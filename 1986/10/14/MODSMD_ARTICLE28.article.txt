# Women's soccer at S.F. State
## 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
"Unpredictable" is the key word in the Stanford women's
soccer match against San Francisco State today.
The Cardinal hits the road again after three home games
in a row, taking on a team that has had an up-and-down
season much like Stanford's own.
The Gators' record this season is 5-5-2, compared to the
Cardinal's 3-5-1. San Francisco State's record, however, may

be misleading in several ways.
For example, earlier this season the Gators lost to Santa
Clara, a relatively weak team, 4-0. On the other hand, the
Gators played an incredibly tough game against Cal State-
Hayward, a nationally ranked squad, and were beaten
slimly, 1-0.
S.F. State is "a little erratic," according to Stanford Coach
Helen Keohane. "They've played up and down this year, but

they have a lot of fight."
Once again, Stanford will be facing a
fairly well-rounded team. "They don't
have any one outstanding player," said
Hilary Turner, who is usually the Card
inal's defensive "hit man," taking on
the opposing team's best player in one
on-one coverage.
"We don't know what to expect," the
veteran fullback said. "We have
enough confidence to win. We are

playing together so well as a team."
Offensively, Stanford leading
scorer's Tonya Antonucci, as well as
the other Cardinal forwards, will be
called upon to establish the momen
tum.
The defense will be looking to
goalkeeper Vija Brookshire for another
steadfast performance. Brookshire has
not allowed a goal in the last two
games and is allowing opponents an
average of only 1.2 goals per game.
One factor to keep in mind about
this game is the Gator's hometown
crowd. "Playing there is tough because
they have rowdy fans," Keohane said.
