# Mauch hopes jinx is extinct
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — Whenever California Manager
Gene Mauch listens, he hears the words. Wherever
the Boston Red Sox look, they see them.
Choke. Curse. Collapse.
Ugly sounding. But labels that whichever one loses
the American League playoffs this week will have to
live with for another winter. Is either one meant to
win?
No Mauch-led team has reached the World Series
in his 25 years of major league managing, the longest
such streak ever. His 1964 Philadelphia Phillies blew
it in the final week. His 1982 Angels fell apart in the
playoffs.
California was within one strike of making the trip
this October when it squandered a three-run lead in
the ninth inning Sunday and eventually lost a chance
to win the team's first pennant.
"Monkey, are you on my back again?" Mauch said
recently when asked about the spell.
Mauch and the Angels, still leading the best-of
seven series 3-2, get another try to break the jinx
tonight in Game Six at Fenway Park. Kirk McCaskill,
the Game Two loser, will be opposed by Boston's
Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd, the loser in the third game.

California rookie first baseman Wallyjoyner, who
hit .455 in the first three games but missed the next
two when hospitalized by a bacterial infection in his
lower right leg, made the trip to Boston and is ex
pected to play.
Boston again will be trying to avoid elimination,
having staved it off in Sunday's 7-6 victory in 11 in
nings. The Red Sox, without a World Series champi
onship since 1918, spent the entire regular season
fighting off AL East challengers and the ghost of
missed opportunities past, before narrowly escaping
a wipeout along the California coast.
Sunday, Anaheim Stadium was adorned with more
than a dozen banners recalling Boston's inability to
win big games in previous seasons.
"Actually, there must have been 15 signs like that
around the park," Red Sox designated hitter Don
Baylor said. "I saw them, but anyone who knows this
club knows we are not choking."
Yet anyone who saw the Red Sox lose Saturday
night would have said differently. Boston was only
three outs from tying the series 2-2 when dominating
Roger Clemens let a 3-0 lead slip away in the ninth in
ning, and the Angels won 4-3 in the 11th.

But, in the ebb and flow of playoff baseball, the
tide quickly turned back against Mauch on Sunday.
California's best pitcher, Mike Witt, took a 5-2 lead
into the ninth inning before Baylor hit a two-run
homer with one out.
Witt retired the next batter on an easy popup, then
Mauch pulled his ace and brought in a left-handed
Gary Lucas to pitch to lefty Rich Gedman, who was 4-
for-4 with a home run against Witt. Lucas, who had
struck out Gedman Saturday night, hit him with a
pitch Sunday.
Mauch then summoned Donnie Moore, who gave
up a home run to Dave Henderson that put Boston
ahead 6-5. The Angels tied the score in the bottom of
the ninth but left the bases loaded, and Henderson's
sacrifice fly won it in the 11th.
"I've never had much success relieving Mike Witt.
But I've also never seen Rich Gedman do anything
but strike out against Gary Lucas," Mauch said.
"I can handle it this way. If I had left him (Witt) in
and Gedman had another hit, I couldn't have han
dled that."
It has been Mauch's handling of
pitchers in tense situations that has
stirred criticism in the past. In 1964, he
overworked pitchers Jim Bunning and
Chris Short in the stretch and they
wore down as Philadelphia was unable
to hold a six-game lead with two weeks
remaining in the National League race.
