# Accused regrets Rush altercation
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Randy Von Feldt, one of two stu
dents named in a lawsuit that alleges
they beat a classmate after a fraternity
Rush party last spring, said yesterday
that he regrets his actions in that al
tercation.
"I feel real bad about the incident. I
would do it real differently if I had to
do it over again," Von Feldt said from
his home in Fairmont, Minn.
Sophomore David Curry, who suf
fered a collapsed lung and two broken
ribs in the fight last spring quarter, has
sued Von Feldt and sophomore Bill
McKelvy, who he claims beat him. The
suit also names Stanford University and
the Delta Upsilon and Sigma Chi fiater
nities, according to the San Jose Mer
cury News.
"I think what I did wasn't 100 per
cent right. I have regrets ... but there's
nothing I could do about it right now,"
Von Feldt said.
None of the three sophomores who
were involved in the fight, which oc
curred between the DU and Sigma Chi
fraternities April 11, are enrolled at
Stanford this quarter. University judi
cial hearings were held against
McKelvy, Von Feldt and Currry after
the fight, but the results are confiden
tial, Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said.
Following the incident, Lyons said
the three studertts we;re "quite drunk"

and termed the fight a "near-death" sit
uation.
McKelvy and Von Feldt were later
charged with felony battery.
Von Feldt said "the whole thing
(incident) started at the Sigma Chi's
(house.)"
He said the three freshman spent
most of the night at a Rush party at the
DU fraternity and that he did not attend
the Beta Theta Pi Rush party, as was
previously reported by University offi
cials following the incident.
Also, Von Feldt said the fight was not
broken up by a DU member, but "just
sort of ended."
He said he knew a lawsuit was a pos
sibility but had not been notified
before contacted by The Daily.
He said he will return to school next
quarter and that he is "ready to kind of
stan over."
Bill McKelvy, currently living at
home in Germantown, Tenn., could
not be reached for comment yesterday.
But his mother, Diane McKelvy, said:
"We're going to fight this. Bill hasn't
done anything wrong."
She said the incident has been diffi
cult for the family. "Usually, the only
time we're in the papers is when we're
involved in a charity," she said.
According to professors at the Stan
ford Law School, in order for the plain
tiff to win against the University and/or
either fraternity, he must prove that
