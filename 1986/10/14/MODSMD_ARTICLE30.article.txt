NEW YORK (AP) — National
League President Chub Feeney
called off yesterday's Game 5 of the
National League playoffs between
the Houston Astros and New York
Mets because of rain, and there was
little prospect for improvement in
the weather until tomorrow.
With the best-of-seven series tied
at two games apiece, rookie left
hander Jim Deshaies of Houston
had been scheduled to go yesterday
against 1985 Cy Young Award win
ner Dwight Gooden of New York.
A constant drizzle forced Na
tional League officials to delay the
12:10 p.m. PDT start, and Feeney
postponed the game at 1:22 p.m.
The game was rescheduled for
10:05 a.m. today, but the National
Weather Service predicted 100 per
cent chance of rain today.
A rainout today would postpone
the game until 10 a.m. tomorrow,
with Games 6 and 7 on Thursday
and Friday at Houston.
While saying he was aware of
today's forecast, Feeney said: "I
didn't want to start and then have to

stop. We're going to try tomorrow
(today)."
Rainouts would not affect the
Mets' pitching rotation, with
Gooden scheduled to be followed
in Game 6 by Bob Ojeda regardless
of the schedule.
"It just gives Doc (Gooden) a
day's rest he doesn't need," Mets
Manager Davey Johnson said. "And
the weather reports are very bad to
morrow." Johnson said another
rainout would not change his rota
tion.
Houston Manager Al Lanier said,
however, that Deshaies would be
dropped from his rotation, and be
replaced by Nolan Ryan for Game 5.
For Game 6, Lanier said he would
come back with Bob Knepper, loser
of Game 3.
If today's game also is rained out,
Lanier said Scott would be a possi
bility for Game 6, depending on
what happens in Game 5.
"I could push Nolan back one
day for Game 5, then come back
with Scott or Knepper in Game 6,"
Lanier said.
