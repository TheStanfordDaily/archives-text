# Cincinnati uses fake punt to drop Pittsburgh to 1-5
## 
### 
CINCINNATI (AP) — Cincinnati
punter Jeff Hayes made up for a
blocked kick and a safety by sprinting
61 yards with a fourth-quarter fake last
night to give the Bengals a 24-22 vic
tory over the reeling Pittsburgh
Steelers.
Pittsburgh, suffering its worst start in
17 years, had built a 19-14 fourth
quarter lead with the help of a touch
down set up by a blocked punt and a
safety achieved by chasing Hayes out of
the end zone on another punt try.
Hayes surprised the Steelers defense
by taking a fourth-down snap, eluding
a tackle, balancing along the sideline
and racing to his first National Football
League touchdown with 13:47 to play.
Their fourth consecutive victory
over the Steelers kept the Bengals, 4-2,
tied with Cleveland for first place in
the AFC Central. The Steelers fell to 1-
5, their worst start since Chuck Noll's
team went 1-13 in 1969, his first as
Pittsburgh's head coach.

Until Hayes' fourth-quarter gamble,
the Steelers appeared headed for vic
tory behind rookie quarterback Bubby
Brister.
Brister, a third-round draft choice
playing his first regular-season game
for the injured Mark Malone, dove one
yard for a first-quarter touchdown set
up by Hayes' blocked punt. He coolly
completed three of four passes for 40
yards in a third-quarter scoring drive
that gave the Steelers their first lead 16-
14.
Brister completed 12 of 33 for 191
yards.
Strong safety Donnie Shell's 48th
career interception set up a 24-yard
field goal by Gary Anderson that gave
Pittsburgh a more comfortable 19-14
lead late in the third quarter.
Hayes' touchdown put Cincinnati
back ahead, and Jim Breech kicked a
40-yard field goal to give Cincinnati a
24-19 advantage and become the Ben
gals' all-time scoring leader. His 550

points moved him one ahead of Horst
Muhlmann.
Anderson kicked a 44-yard field goal
with 2:35 to play to trim the lead to two
points, and Pittsburgh had one last
chance after Hayes' punt pinned them
at their own 8 with 2:02 to play. But the
Steelers gained just one yard in four
plays to end their final threat.
In the second quarter of the game,
Cincinnati running back Bill Johnson
suffered a neck injury and was taken
from the field on a stretcher.
Johnson, in his second NFL season,
caught a 10-yard pass from quarterback
Boomer Esiason and was doubled for
ward in a sitting position by several
tacklers with 48 seconds left in the first
half.
Doctors examined him on the
ground for several minutes before he
was gingerly placed on a stretcher and
immobilized, then wheeled to a dress
ing room.
X-rays disclosed no fracture.
