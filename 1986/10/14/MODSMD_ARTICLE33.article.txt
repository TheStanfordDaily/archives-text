# Med School finds gene linked to blood cancer
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER 
Medical School researchers have made a
breakthrough in the study of lymphatic cancer, isolating
a gene whose alterations are strongly linked with a
malignancy of white blood cells, which play an important
role in the body's immune system.
The "oncogene" isolated by the researchers is only
one of a handful linked with human malignancies, and is
associated with a form of cancer called follicular cancer,
which, according to Dr. Michael Cleary, is the second
most prevalent adult lymphoma, after Hodgkin's disease.
The gene was isolated after researchers cloned a frag
ment of DNA at a chromosomal break point. "That DNA
could be used to search for the gene," said Cleary, an as
sistant professor of pathology at the Medical School.
"Once we demonstrated it existed, we could then use
(the DNA) to isolate it, so the entire process was depen
dent on the break point."
In a paper last November for the National Academy of
Science, the researchers described evidence that such an
oncogene existed. This past year they worked to verify its
existence. Dr. Stephen Smith, associate professor of
pediatrics, and Dr. Jeffrey Sklar, assistant professor of pa
thology, assisted Cleary in the research.
By cloning the gene, scientists can closely study the
structure of its protein. "It looks like it (the gene) is
potentially involved in a large class of human lymphae.
The next step is to study the product of the gene to see

what role it has in causing the cancer. Once that is esti
mated we can then go on and see if we can inhibit this
product with drugs against it," said Cleary, who empha
sized that this last step is a long-term goal. The isolation
of this oncogene is relevant for only a few forms of lym
phatic cancer.
The oncogene was created by rearrangements in an
tibody genes. This occurs when DNA breaks and then
reattaches, resulting in two separate chromosomes that
are translocated, or have traded places. It is estimated
that 90 percent of patients with follicular lymphoma have
this characteristic pattern of broken and reattached DNA.
Cleary and his colleagues were able to show that this
DNA translocation results in the abnormal reunion of
two genes to create a hybrid gene.
The isolation was first reported in the Oct. 10 issue of
the medical journal "Cell." The study may eventually
result in the development of a new therapy to combat
follicular lymphoma, a slow-growing cancer which with
current treatment methods is difficult to cure. One unex
pected finding was that the protein product of the gene
is related to a product of the Epstein-Barr virus, known
to affect the growth of B-cells.
The study was made possible through grants from the
National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Soci
ety and the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust, as well as
through scholarship funds from the Markey Trust and
the Leukemia Societv of America.
