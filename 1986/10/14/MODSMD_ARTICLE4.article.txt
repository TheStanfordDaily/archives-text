# Labor Relations Board dismisses USW complaint
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
In two unrelated University-labor develop
ments, the National Labor Relations Board has
dismissed a United Stanford Workers union
claim and the USW has filed a suit in district
court contesting the University's interpretation
of its contract.
The NLRB last week dismissed a complaint
filed by the USW charging that the University il
legally witheld imformation before the arbitra
tion proceedings of USW-member Victor Hill, a
former shipper and receiver at the University.
"The NLRB found that the union received all
the information that it was legally entided to,"
said Priscilla Wheeler, general counsel for the
University. She added that the NLRB could not
find enough evidence to continue the proceed-

ings and have an administrative law judge hear
the complaint.
Earlier this summer, Wheeler called the USW
charges "red herrings which clouded the
merits of the case."
But according to Mary Ann Tenuto, staff
counsel for the USW, the case was not dis
missed because of its merit. The NI.RB dis
missed the charge because the University
reversed its position, she said.
The University technically committed a viola
tion of the national labor laws, Tenuto said. The
NLRB only dropped the case after the University
wrote a letter to the union saying it would not
continue to withold information in the future,
she said.
The University dismissed Hill last October
for allegedly slashing the tires of his super
visor's car. The arbitration hearings were

scheduled initially for last May, but severe
delays prevented it from being completed until
Sept. 30.
The sickness of Felix Barthelemy, manager of
employee relations, and an extraordinarily
large amount of testimony caused the delay.
Ordinarily, arbitration proceedings last two
days, but Hill's case required four days of tes
timony, Tenuto said.
With the withholding of information issue re
solved, an arbiter will now read briefs from
University and USW lawyers and determine the
legitimacy of Hill's firing.
In the other matter, the LISW has recently
filed a suit in district court charging that the
University refuses to proceed with grievance ar
bitration hearings required by a new labor con
tract.
This claim against the University, which is

still in its pre-trial stages, involves the contract
accepted by workers last October after heated
negotiations.
A backlog of about 100 cases was created
from February 1984 to April 1985 when the
University refused to arbitrate any grievances
with the USW, Tenuto told The Daily this sum
mer. The University is a couple of years behind
in scheduling its arbitration hearings, she said.
By scheduling the old cases first, the Univer
sity is preventing the new contract from being
tested, she said.
According to Wheeler, the USW complaint is
a "very puzzling matter.''
The most recent contract spells out the Uni
versity's policy on grievances, Wheeler said.
Under the new contract, the University handles
arbitration hearings chronologically except for
cases which involve the firing of an employee.

Union officials say that an interim agreement
signed in 1984 called for hearings to be ar
ranged chronologically, but say that the new
contract requires that new grievances be heard,
Tenuto said.
According to Wheeler, both the 1984 interim
agreeement and the new contract arrange
hearings chronologically.
On many of the arbitrations which the USW
cites in its suit to demonstrate non-compliance
in scheduling, the USW has never contacted the
University, Wheeler added.
USW President Tim Johnson told The Daily
this summer: "The reason this dispute is impor
tant enough to take court action is because die
practical effect of the adminstration's position is
to preclude the resolution of disputes over con
tract interpretation before we renegotiate the
contract in 1988."
