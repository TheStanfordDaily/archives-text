# Experts not surprised by talks' failure
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
Experts at Stanford and the Hoover Institution
agreed yesterday that the failure of this weekend's su
perpower mini-summit to reach an arms control
agreement was expected, and they said it may have
an effect on upcoming elections in Western Europe.
Describing his reaction to the recent mini-summit
in Iceland as "one of relief," Hoover Fellow Richard
Sta;»r said he was pleased that "the President didn't
compromise on SDI."
President Reagan's refusal to limit testing on the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), commonly
referred to as "Star Wars," was the issue that caused
negotiations between the superpowers to break
down last weekend in Reykjavik, Iceland.
Staar said the concessions offered by the Soviets
were "all contingent on revising the ABM (Anti-
Ballistic Missile) treaty" to restrict all research, devel
opment and testing on SDI to the laboratory.
Hubert Marshall, professor emeritus in political
science, said the breakdown of the talks "was ex
pected" because Reagan is "really not interested" in
disarmament. Reagan operates from the incorrect
belief that the United States can win the arms race,
Marshall said.
Reagan believes the Soviets cannot compete with
the United States in the militarization of space, and
that eventually they will "withdraw from competi
tion" for co-equal superpower status and resign
themselves to being a regional power, Marshall said.
Marshall called the mini-summit a "cosmetic exer
cise (held) for domestic political reasons " Reagan
went to the mini summit "to assuage the public con
cem" over arms control, he said.
At a speech in Branner Hall last week, Staar
predicted that the mini-summit would not produce

an arms-control agreement, and that the failure
would be used by the Soviets as an excuse to avoid a
full-dress summit in Washington later this year.
Staar said yesterday that the breakdown of talks
will "give (the Soviets) time to work on propaganda
here in the U.S." and in Western Europe.
Western Europe is of particular concern to the
Soviets because of upcoming elections in Great Brit
ain and West Germany. In both countries, parties
with strong anti-nuclear stances have the potential to
increase their influence over their governments
Staar said he worries that propaganda efforts by the
Soviets could influence the elections in this direc
tion, and he predicted that NATO might collapse if
either West Germany or Great Britain became
nuclear free
The possible effect of the failed mini summit on

European elections was also noted by Marshall, who
said that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev "went to
Iceland... hard at work to create an image of peace."
Marshall said the Soviets hope an image of Gorba
chev as peacemaker and Reagan as warmonger will
contribute to the showings of anti nuclear parties in
upcoming elections in Western Europe
Marshall said Reagan believes SDI will force the
Soviets to conclude that the cost of an arms race is
too great for them. Hut this outlook is unrealistic, he
said, noting that the annual increase in real gross na
tional product (GNP) is "roughly equal in both
countries.
He added that the Soviet Union has a "big advan
tage" in an arms race because it "Is not a democracy,
yet their people are patriotic," allowing the Soviets to
sacrifice consumption for military expenditures.
