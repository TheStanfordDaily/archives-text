# Holiday causes schedule conflict
## 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
Some students chose to miss classes,
and several professors rescheduled
their lectures yesterday in observance
of Yom Kippur, the highest of Jewish
High Holy Days.
While Stanford's quarter system
manages to accommodate major Chris
tian holidays such as Christmas and
Easter, it often conflicts with Jewish
holidays such as Yom Kippur and Rosh
Hashana, the first day of the Jewish
New Year.
Translated from Hebrew, Yom Kip
pur means Day of Atonement and is
supposed to be a time of prayer and
reflection for worshippers. This year
Yom Kippur began when the sun set
Sunday and ended at dusk yesterday.
Junior Dave Councilman described
Yom Kippur as "the day you go to
atone for your sins" and"the most holy
day for Jews in the year."
He said that, ideally, one walks to
temple on Yom Kippur, prays and then
walks home. He explained that obser
vers are not supposed to use bicycles
or motor vehicles on the holiday.
Councilman sa'd that he fasted but
attended classes Jespite the holiday
He said that students are "torn be
tween going to classes and keeping
up" by observing Yom Kippur in the
traditional way
Though Jews are supposed to take
the day off, "most students I know go
to class," he said. "To miss class and go
to services can be pretty hard."
"It's easier not to observe (Yom Kip

pur) at school than it is at home," he
explained. "If a professor knew there
were a lot of Jewish students in his
class, it would be nice if he suggested
holding it the next day instead."
A. Mitchell Polinsky, professor of law
and economics, chose not to teach
classes yesterday in order to observe
Yom Kippur. Sunday night he went to
Hillel services, and yesterday he stayed
at home.
Polinsky said he feels the Univer
sity's policy is fine the way it stands.
"Individual professors should make
their own decisions (about whether to
teach)," he said.
Ronald Rebholz, professor of En
glish, taped his lecture for yesterday
and made it available to students by
putting it on reservV? in the library.
When asked if she went to classes
yesterday, first-year graduate student
Noa More replied, "Of course not!"
She did, however, admit that she
"drove all over the universe."
More explained her reasons for not
attending classes: "There should be the
right to observe religious holidays. The
right exists, and if you don't use it, the
right tends to go away " She said her
professors were "very accommodat
ing."
Last year, the University scheduled
classes to begin on Rosh Hashana,
which "put a lot of pressure on stu
dents and faculty," said IX*an of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons.
Since then, the University has vowed
to modify its academic calendar in the
future to avoid scheduling the first day
of classes on these holidays.
When asked if he thought the Uni
versity should recognize Rosh Hashana
or Yom Kippur, Lyons said, "No, I think
there's a difference with calling off the
. whole University: classes, the libraries,

the (administrative) offices... every
thing."
He added, "Every religion has a very
high holy day. It just wouldn't be
practical to do that."
The University's failure to observe
Yom Kippur should not affect
employees. "The University makes it
possible for employees to take per
sonal days off," said Lyons. "It's more
the option of the individual."
