Afghan aid sparks controversy
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — The United States is launching a sensitive
"humanitarian aid" program here for the anti-Soviet resistance fighters in
neighboring Afghanistan that some diplomats fear could inadvertently
weaken the resistance by fostering corruption and luring Afghan guerrillas
away from the front.
The project is regarded as unprecedented by some U.S. officials because
the Agency for International Development will be used to send funds to a
guerrilla movement in a virtually ungovemed war zone.
In the coming weeks, AID will provide money and material to the fragile
alliance of Afghan resistance parties based here in northwestern Pakistan,
who are to distribute it to the fighting fronts inside Afghanistan. The
supplies will include "non-lethal" goods, such as U.S. military surplus
boots and sleeping bags and equipment for schools and clinics in areas of
Afghanistan dominated by the resistance.
AID will not send Americans into Afghanistan and will be unable to di
rectly monitor the disbursement of its supplies inside the country.
El Salvador denies involvement
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — The Salvadoran chief of staff, indirectly
contradicting Vice President Bush, said yesterday that no U.S. national
could work for the Salvadoran military without High Command's approval,
and to his knowledge none has been given.
Gen. Adolfo Blandon, who made the statement to U.S. reporters, was ad
dressing a declaration by Bush Saturday that a Cuban-American — identi
fied as die leader of a secret supply program here for anti-Sandinista rebels
— was a counterinsurgency specialist helping the Salvadoran government
put down "a Marxist-led revolution" in their own country.
Salvadoran military leaders have denied their facilities were being used
to move rebel supplies into Nicaragua or that their personnel were in
volved.
Bush has said a U.S. counterinsurgency adviser outside the regular U.S.
military assistance program — and identified as chief of the anti-Sandinista
resupply effort — was working directly with the Salvadoran government.
Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount said he knew nothing about
the situation or the adviser, variously identified as Gomez or as Felix
Rodriguez. President Jose Duarte, in response to a number of reports from
volunteer organizations and rebel officials over the last three years, has
denied that Ilopongo Airport is being used to intervene in Nicaragua. He
said Friday he knows nothing of Gomez's activities.
The Reagan administration repeatedly has denied the supply operation
has anything to do with the U.S. government, including the CIA It has
declined to reveal what it knows about the operation, however, including
what the Salvadoran military may have done to provide cover for it and
what role Gomez played in it.
Salvadoran quake toll at 890
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Homeless Salvadorans set up makeshift
shelters in fields, the Maternity Hospital delivered babies in the parking lot,
and survivors yesterday went about burying the nation's 890 known
earthquake dead.
President Jose Duarte put the number of injured in last Friday's
catastrophe at 10,000 and the homeless at 150,000.
The devastation was confined mostly to this capital city of 800,000
people, and Duarte told El Salvador in a broadcast Sunday night: "We are
practically going to have to reconstruct all of the city."
He asked for more international aid, requesting medicines and supplies
for battered hospitals where teams worked outside to treat patients.
Search teams struggled to retrieve victims from toppled buildings. Spe
cially trained dogs led by Swiss, French and American teams burrowed into
crawl spaces looking for signs of life.
Duarte said the city suffered $2 billion in damage and that every govern
ment building in this Central American capital was hit, including the presi
dential palace.
Government operations were moved to the military command
headquarters.
U.S. scientists split Noble Prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — American biochemist Stanley Cohen and
Italian-American neurobiologist Rita Levi-Montalcini were awarded the
1986 Nobel Prize for medicine yesterday.
Sweden's Karolinska Institute, which awards the Nobel Prize, cited the
two scientists for their discoveries of "growth factors" that regulate human
cell and organ development and could be keys to understanding senile
dementia and other diseases.
The scientists will share the prize of roughly $300,000.
Levi-Montalcini, 77, who has worked in her native Italy, Brazil and the
United States, where she also has citizenship, was cited for her discovery of
the so-called epidermal growth factor.
Cohen, 63, born in New York City, works at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, Tenn. Through experiments using snake venom and salivary
gland secretions, he was able to isolate, refine and identify the so-called
never growth factor.
Both the nerve and epidermal growth factors could show how the
growth and differentiation of cells is regulated.
Clausen stalls BofA takeover
SAN FRANCISCO — A.W. "Tom" Clausen's return to leadership of
beleaguered BankAmerica Corp. will stall a decision on First Interstate
Bancorp's $2.8 billion takeover bid, giving BofA more time to resolve its
problems, analysts said yesterday.
Clausen and directors of the nation's second-largest commercial bank,
which has lost $577 million so far this year after losing $337 million last
year, indicated they are determined to rebuff First Interstate's offer and
remain independent.
The directors put off a decision until Clausen and new BankAmerica
president Thomas Cooper have time to study the situation.
First Interstate officials were off yesterday because of Columbus Day and
were not available for comment.
Clausen, 63, named chairman and chief executive officer on Sunday of
BankAmerica Corp. and its main unit, Bank of America, was charged with
the task of returning the bank to profitability and restoring the common
stock dividend.
Analysts had a mixed reaction to Clausen's return as replacement for
Samuel Armacost, who resigned as chief executive officer, and Leland Prus
sia, who retired afychairman.
Newspaper workers may strike
SAN FRANCISCO — After management proposed an 18-month contract
with a wage freeze, more than 5,000 employees of the three major
newspapers in San Francisco and San Jose will begin taking votes today to
authorize the union leadership to call a strike in the two cities.
Negotiators bargaining jointly for nine unions, led by the San Francisco-
Oakland Newspaper Guild Local 52, went back to the bargaining table yes
terday with The San Francisco Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner and
The San Jose Mercury News to try and hammer out an agreement. The
Tribune in Oakland is not involved in the talks.
A "yes" majority vote would not mean an immediate strike. It would au
thorize the leadership, after obtaining AFL-CIO sanction, to call a strike if it
wishes.
The guild represents editorial, clerical, sales, circulation, business, com
puter, advertising, classified and janitorial workers. Negotiations have been
going on since the old-contract expired June 30.
