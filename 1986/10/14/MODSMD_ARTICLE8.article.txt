# Reagan says there's still hope

### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said last night
that the United States is "ready to pick up where we
left off' in the collapsed Iceland summit talks with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but vowed not to
agree to Gorbachev's demand that the United States
slow development of a missile defense system.
In a nationally televised address one day after the
Reykjavik summit concluded without agreement,
Reagan offered gestures of conciliation to Gorba
chev, but stressed he would stand firm on the Strate
gic Defense Initiative, which became a contentious
stumbling block at the Iceland summit.
"We proposed the most sweeping and generous
arms control proposal in history," Reagan said.
"While we parted company with this American offer
still on the table, we are closer than ever before to
agreements that could lead to a safer world without
nuclear weapons."
Earlier in the day, Reagan's national security affairs
adviser, John Poindexter, told reporters that U.S.
negotiators at Geneva will attempt to hold the Soviets
to the deep cuts in strategic and intermediate-range
missiles that Gorbachev said he was willing to make
if the United States restricted SDI, also known as the
"Star War" program, to laboratory research.
Poindexter said U.S. negotiators will attempt to
"pocket these various pieces" that the Soviets "said
they agreed to" at Reykjavik.
In his speech, Reagan said the summit collapsed
because he could not accept a Gorbachev proposal
that would have the effect of "killing" his missile
defense system.
"I told him I had pledged to the American people

that 1 would not trade away SDI. There was no way I
could tell our people their government would not
protect them against nuclear destruction," Reagan
said. "I went to Reykjavik determined that everything
was negotiable except two things, our freedom and
our future.
"1 am still optimistic that a way will be found," said
Reagan. "The door is open and the opportunity to
elimine the nuclear threat is within reach."
White House chief of staff Donald Regan said in a
television interview that it is "possible" that the presi
dent would appoint a special envoy on arms control
to help restart negotiations with Moscow.
There were also hints that Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Schevardnadze might meet next month at a review
conference on the Helsinki accords in Vienna. Senior
officials traveling on Shultz's plane said "it would
seem natural for the two to meet on this occasion."
Regan had said in Iceland there would not be an
other Reagan-Gorbachev summit, but the president
took a more hopeful view last night. While Gorba
chev gave "no indication" whether or when he in
tends to come to the United States, as he agreed last
year, "I repeat tonight that our invitation stands and
that we continue to believe additional meetings
would be useful," Reagan said. "But that's a decision
the Soviets must make."
Reagan's address, delivered from the Oval Office,
reflected what White House officials said were last
minute changes he made in the text. Reagan said the
scope of the Reykjavik talks also covered human
rights, regional conflicts and bilateral relations, but

"by their (the Soviets') choice, the main subject was
arms control."
He said the two leaders "seemed to be in agree
ment" that intermediate-range missiles in Europe
and Asia could be "drastically reduced." And, he said,
"both sides seemed willing to find a way to reduce
even to zero the strategic ballistic missiles we have
aimed at each other."
But Reagan said the missile defense system, which
he began in 1983, became the centerpiece of the
talks, along with the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty,
which limited defensive systems on each side.
"SDI is America's insurance policy that the Soviet
Union would keep the commitments made at Reyk
javik. SDI is America's security guarantee, if the
Soviets should, as they have done too often in the
past, fail to comply with their solemn commitments.
"SDI is what brought the Soviets back to the arms
control talks at Geneva and Iceland," Reagan said.
"SDI is the key to a world without nuclear weapons."
"So," Reagan said, "if there is one impression I
carry away with me from these October ta s, it is
that, unlike the past, we are dealing now from a posi
tion of strength. And for that reason we have it within
our grasp to move speedily with the Soviets toward
even more breakthroughs.
"Our ideas are out there on the table," he said.
"They won't go away. We are ready to pick up where
we left off. Our negotiators are heading back to
Geneva, and we are prepared to go forward
whenever and wherever the Soviets are ready. So
there is reason, good reason, for hope."

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but vowed not to
agree to Gorbachev's demand that the United States
slow development of a missile defense system.
In a nationally televised address one day after the
Reykjavik summit concluded without agreement,
Reagan offered gestures of conciliation to Gorba
chev, but stressed he would stand firm on the Strate
gic Defense Initiative, which became a contentious
stumbling block at the Iceland summit.
"We proposed the most sweeping and generous
arms control proposal in history," Reagan said.
"While we parted company with this American offer
still on the table, we are closer than ever before to
agreements that could lead to a safer world without
nuclear weapons."
Earlier in the day, Reagan's national security affairs
adviser, John Poindexter, told reporters that U.S.
negotiators at Geneva will attempt to hold the Soviets
to the deep cuts in strategic and intermediate-range
missiles that Gorbachev said he was willing to make
if the United States restricted SDI, also known as the
"Star War" program, to laboratory research.
Poindexter said U.S. negotiators will attempt to
"pocket these various pieces" that the Soviets "said
they agreed to" at Reykjavik.
In his speech, Reagan said the summit collapsed
because he could not accept a Gorbachev proposal
that would have the effect of "killing" his missile
defense system.
"I told him I had pledged to the American people

that 1 would not trade away SDI. There was no way I
could tell our people their government would not
protect them against nuclear destruction," Reagan
said. "I went to Reykjavik determined that everything
was negotiable except two things, our freedom and
our future.
"1 am still optimistic that a way will be found," said
Reagan. "The door is open and the opportunity to
elimine the nuclear threat is within reach."
White House chief of staff Donald Regan said in a
television interview that it is "possible" that the presi
dent would appoint a special envoy on arms control
to help restart negotiations with Moscow.
There were also hints that Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Schevardnadze might meet next month at a review
conference on the Helsinki accords in Vienna. Senior
officials traveling on Shultz's plane said "it would
seem natural for the two to meet on this occasion."
Regan had said in Iceland there would not be an
other Reagan-Gorbachev summit, but the president
took a more hopeful view last night. While Gorba
chev gave "no indication" whether or when he in
tends to come to the United States, as he agreed last
year, "I repeat tonight that our invitation stands and
that we continue to believe additional meetings
would be useful," Reagan said. "But that's a decision
the Soviets must make."
Reagan's address, delivered from the Oval Office,
reflected what White House officials said were last
minute changes he made in the text. Reagan said the
scope of the Reykjavik talks also covered human
rights, regional conflicts and bilateral relations, but

"by their (the Soviets') choice, the main subject was
arms control."
He said the two leaders "seemed to be in agree
ment" that intermediate-range missiles in Europe
and Asia could be "drastically reduced." And, he said,
"both sides seemed willing to find a way to reduce
even to zero the strategic ballistic missiles we have
aimed at each other."
But Reagan said the missile defense system, which
he began in 1983, became the centerpiece of the
talks, along with the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty,
which limited defensive systems on each side.
"SDI is America's insurance policy that the Soviet
Union would keep the commitments made at Reyk
javik. SDI is America's security guarantee, if the
Soviets should, as they have done too often in the
past, fail to comply with their solemn commitments.
"SDI is what brought the Soviets back to the arms
control talks at Geneva and Iceland," Reagan said.
"SDI is the key to a world without nuclear weapons."
"So," Reagan said, "if there is one impression I
carry away with me from these October ta s, it is
that, unlike the past, we are dealing now from a posi
tion of strength. And for that reason we have it within
our grasp to move speedily with the Soviets toward
even more breakthroughs.
"Our ideas are out there on the table," he said.
"They won't go away. We are ready to pick up where
we left off. Our negotiators are heading back to
Geneva, and we are prepared to go forward
whenever and wherever the Soviets are ready. So
there is reason, good reason, for hope."
