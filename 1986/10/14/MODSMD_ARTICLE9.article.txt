# Gorbachev may face party rebuke
## Soviet leader risks his credibility, comes home empty-handed 
### 
Iceland — Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev flew home yester
day from the failed summit meeting in
Iceland, empty-handed and facing an
uncertain reception from his Kremlin
associates and the Soviet people.
In his Sunday news conference, Gor
bachev signaled that he wanted to keep
the dialogue going with President
Reagan on arms control, despite his
deep disappointment that they reached
a stalemate on Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative, often referred to as
"Star Wars."
But, for Soviet tastes, Gorbachev
may have come off as far too con
ciliatory, far too eager to make a deal.
Even before he came to Reykjavik for

the hastily arranged meeting, he was
challenged for being too generous
toward the U.S. president on nuclear
issues. Now, by his own admission, he
has made additional major conces
sions, yet failed to bring anything
home from the two days of talks that he
personally initiated.
Soviet leaders and negotiators have
rarely been known to make conces
sions. On the rare occasions when they
have done so, it has usually been a last
minute change of position in order to
nail down an agreement.
But Gorbachev said Sunday night
that the new Soviet proposals for deep
reductions in offensive nuclear weap
ons and a global ceiling of 100

intermediate-range weapons on each
side, both tentatively accepted by
Reagan, would remain on the bargain
ing table in the Geneva arms talks. The
Soviet leader acknowledged that he
had made "unprecedented conces
sions."
"Gorbachev's problem is that he
may be seen by his people as a Russian
Jimmy Carter," a diplomat said.
Soviet sources agreed that Gorba
chev's remarks after the collapse of the
talks were surprisingly magnanimous
for a Kremlin leader. He delivered
only a ritual condemnation of the
American "military-industrial com
plex," blaming it for controlling
Reagan as if he were a puppet. Later,

however, he said that Reagan and he
could still work together.
Gorbachev's Sunday-night news
conference was carried by the Soviet
television network, but yesterday's
newspapers in Moscow reported,
tersely, only that the meeting had
ended.
Further accounts of the meeting, fol
lowing Gorbachev's optimistic line, are
expected to appear in the state-run
press later in the week, Soviet sources
said. But the glum faces of Gorbachev's
key foreign policy and propaganda ad
visers as he spoke Sunday night may
indicate the reaction of other Commu
nist Party officials.
