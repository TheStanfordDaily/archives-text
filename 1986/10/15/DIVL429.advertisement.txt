NCR Microelectronics — Fort Collins is in beautiful
Colorado...usually. However, on October 24 we will be
at Stanford. If you have ideas for advancing semicon
ductor technologies or CAD — or other plans for a
career in microelectronics — come see us then.
In 1981, we started a little semicustom business and
have grown to become the number one supplier in the
world for the not so basic "ASICs" (Application
Specific IC's) known as cell-based designs. Specifically,
this is the fastest growing segment of the microelec
tronics industry, and w you probably know, that in
itself is usually a pretty fast business.
Vk attract the best people in the industry with a simple
offer: a meaningful career with a growing leader. If you
want to hear more, please contact the placement office
for more details.
An equal opportunity employer.
