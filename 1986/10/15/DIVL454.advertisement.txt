For 25 Years, we've been
exporting America's
most valuable resource.
The men and women of the Peace Corps. Dedicated
volunteers who help people in developing countries live
better lives.
It's tough. And it takes more than just concern. It takes
motivation. Commitment.
But for 25 years, being a Peace Corps volunteer has
been a chance to stop dreaming about a better world
and start doing something about it.
