# Kennedy: Darwin's work affected more than science
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Stepping briefly out of his role as University
president, Donald Kennedy — the Harvard
graduated biologist — last night told more than
100 people at Branner Hall that Charles Darwin's
findings in the Galapagos Islands effected more
than the biological sciences.
Kennedy, the first of four speakers in Branner s
year-long "Learning and Discovery" series,
stressed that Darwin's impact went far beyond the
demonstration that biological species are not im
mutable.
Darwin's findings were "a kind of demonstra
tion that a single way of knowing wasn't possible
anymore," Kennedy said, noting that a unified
view of natural philosophy was no longer possi
ble.
Kennedy also said Darwin's findings did not
overthrow the notion of divine creation, that "all
forms of life existed as they were made, the intri
cate work of a creator.
"No one supposed that creation had been dis
proves only special creation. God had not been
denied, only forced to retreat still more into the
spectator's role," he said.

Kennedy, who presented slides taken last year
on his trip to the Galapagos Islands, called the is
lands an ideal "laboratory of evolution."
The islands, isolated 600 miles west of Ecuador,
contain numerous endemic Species of birds and
other animals that vary in size and color. In addi
tion, the Galapagos are relatively new, volcanic is
lands, with simple vegetation patterns formed be
tween 500,000 and one million years ago, Ken
nedy said.
The proximity of the islands to each other
allowed Darwin to deduce that changes in climate
were not responsible for variation among
species, Kennedy said.
Darwin found "definite, but subtle, differ
ences" among species special to the islands, Ken
nedy said, adding that such differences were
"simple enough so as to suggest a definite rela
tionship" between variations of a single species.
"Changes in form (of endemic species) ap
peared to be taking place over time," Kennedy
said, noting that such observations from his three
week stay on the islands led to Darwin's theory
on the origin of species by natural selection.
Kennedy called Darwin "a very careful obser
ver" who had been "relentlessly curious about
nature" since his childhood.
