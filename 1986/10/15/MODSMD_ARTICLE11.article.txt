# Forums to focus on sanctuary movement
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
The sanctuary issue will take center stage
tonight as the first of three public forums ad
dresses historical questions surrounding the
movement.
The programs, sponsored by Ecumenical
Ministries at Stanford and Memorial Church,
will feature experts from around the world.
The forums will be held in Memorial Church
at 7:30 p.m. tonight and the next two Wednes
days on Oct. 22 and 29.
Though Dean of Student Affairs James Lvons
said he applauds the principle behind the
sanctuary movement, he said Stanford could
not establish itself as a sanctuary since that
would be "taking a political position."
Last spring the sanctuary issue at Stanford
heated up when Columbae, a University co-op,
gave sanctuary to a Salvadoran refugee known
only as German. The University said the action
violated the Residential Education guest

policy.
Lyons termed sanctuary "a powerful and
neccessary cause,".but he added that "using
the University as a sanctuary is a different
issue" and, as last year's incident showed, it vi
olates University policy.
The University's oudook on the situation
has not changed since then. "The fact that we
are not going to alter our guest policy has
nothing to do with sanctuary," Lyons said.
But a number of groups have tried, as the
Columbae residents did, to get the University
to take a political position, Lyons said. By
resisting these attempts, the University is able
"to keep the environment free" for students to
make their own decisions on the issue at hand.
Saying that he hopes the programs sched
uled this month will prompt "a resuscitation"
of the sanctuary movement, Lyons described
the oppression — the use of force and the
deprivation of fundamental human rights — in
other countries as "situations that invite our at
tention."
