The Stanford Board of Trustees yesterday voted to
divest the University of nearly $4.5 million worth of stock
in Schlumberger and in Grey Advertising, approving the
largest sale of stock in companies not meeting Stanford's
guidelines for investment in South Africa. While the ac
tion is commendable, the University's long delay in
making a significant stand on apartheid is deplorable.
Stanford's leaders should not be allowed to become
complacent now that they have finally, months after an
initial proposal, made a meaningful move in the direc
tion of divestment. This is not the end; it Is only a first
step. .
The University's Committee on Investment Responsi
bility correctly recommended that Stanford follow a
policy of selective divestment. The goal of divestment —
whether selective or total — is to end apartheid, but it is
only through selective divestment on the University's
part and selective disinvestment on the part of U.S. cor
porations, that all involved can keep their influence for
positive change in South Africa.
No one knows if total divestment will work to end
apartheid or, for that matter, if a selective policy will.
Total divestment, however, will doom the anti-apartheid

movement if that strategy failc. Partial divestment gives
the University an opportunity to maintain continual pres
sure for a racially just South Africa. It is through selective
divestment that Stanford can best work to improve the
condition of oppressed South Africans. It is easy to turn
one's back on a problem; it is much more difficult to face
up to the problem and work to solve it constructively, as
Stanford has finally begun to do.
But the University seems to be going about the fight in
a half-hearted manner. The selective divestment
guidelines should be toughened, and it is in this area that
Stanford, after noticeably lagging behind the UC-system
and Harvard, can assume a degree of leadership on the
divestment issue.
Stanford could sponsor proxy resolutions demanding
that companies in its portfolio follow stricter guidelines
in their dealings in South Africa or withdraw from the
country within a year. If the businesses failed to meet the
revised, more difficult standards, the University could au
tomatically divest of its stock in the offenders.
This new policy would give Stanford more arms to
bear in the fight against apartheid. And with the board's
decision yesterday, the fight has just begun.
