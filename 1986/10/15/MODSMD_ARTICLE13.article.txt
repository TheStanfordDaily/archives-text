University frat
policy is juvenile
Before I start, just let me say that I
am not a member of any fraternity,
nor am I sure that I ever intend to
become a member of one. However,
the administration's policy toward
fraternal life on campus has become
so juvenile that I can no longer
remain silent on this issue..
When I came to Stanford last year,
the thing that I was most impressed
with was the students' ability to bal
ance hard work and fun. I found
Stanford students knew how to put in
the work necessary to get the most
out of their education. Yet, when it
came time to unwind, Stanford stu
dents also knew how to party. The
administration, at that time, seemed
very up-to-date in realizing the impor
tance of balancing work and play.
However, all of a sudden this once
"hip" administration appears to be
getting more archaic by the day.
The clincher came on Friday, Oct.
10 when a front-page headline in The
Daily read, "Frat suspended for rowdy
party." In the following article Frater
nal Affairs Advisor Joe Pisano was
quoted as saying, "The mental picture
of men dressed in boxer shorts and
women scantily clad, all soaked in
beer, raises some questions." Horror
of horrors! The electric chair wouldn't
be a severe enough punishment for
those naughty boys and girls. The only
question their actions rose would be
why I chose that night to stay home
and study.
Wake up, Mr. Pisano, this is the '80s.
1 would think that the administration
would be happy that Stanford stu
dents, supposedly some of the bright
est students in the nation, still know
how to have a good time. Stanford
prides itself on having a well-rounded,
outgoing student body, yet the actions
of the administration serve constantly
to squelch the social side of a Stanford
student; the side that makes us so
unique. Granted, for some students
the party scene is not their style, but
for those of us who do enjoy going to
fraternity parties, I ask the administra

tion to allow us to have our fun.
Finally, I want to ask the students
how much of your free social time is
spent at fraternity parties. If the an
swer for you is a good portion, then I
ask you not to stand by indifferently
and watch the administration disband
one fraternity after another. Let them
know that we don't want Stanford to
become the MIT of the West

ASSU can rise
above criticism
There are two sides to every story,
and Chris Adamson (The Daily, Oct. 7)
has not presented either. Instead, he
has presented a negative and unin
formed criticism of an organization
about which he apparently kncftvs very
little. •
The main criticism of the ASSU
seems to be that even were the ASSU
to have some good ideas, no one
would be willing to help. He claims
that since students do not feel they are
benefiting personally from the ASSU,
they therefore have no motivation to
get involved with it. By taking one
look around Stanford, we can clearly
see that this is not true. Dozens of
organizations on campus exist that
entail students working together
toward a goal from which they will
not directly benefit.
Chris Adamson also claims that
there are no links between the gov
ernment and the students "it's
supposed to serve." Does ASSU stand
for Associated Slave of Stanford Uni
versity? Of course not. The purpose of
the ASSU is to represent the interests
of the students and assist them in
planning and accomplishing their
goals. The ASSU exists to represent
student views to the administration
and to assist and coordinate students'
interests into feasible plans of action.
The ASSU offers a set of recourse that
no other student group can offer:
energetic, hardworking people with
diverse knowledge and experiences
who are willing to help you.
For example, since the time of last
year's vote when Stanford students

called for divestment, the ASSU Senate
and COP have taken the responsibility
to make sure that the University feels
pressured by the students. Presently,
(University President) Donald Ken
nedy has agreed to discuss his view
point on the issue with senate, COP
and SOSA members, so that we will
know which angle of the situation to
hit hardest. Other projects, such as the
Western Culture issue, the mistreat
ment of Stanford workers and the
funding cut of five sports last spring,
have had much student interest and
support and are priorities on the
ASSU agenda this fall.
However, not all of Mr. Adamson's
criticisms are completely off-track.
Bureaucracy exists throughout Ameri
can society, and the ASSU is no excep
tion. The paperwork involved in
implementing any project or idea is
overwhelming! Nevertheless, rather
than moan and groan about it, we
should instead realize that the paper
work and regulations provide the
continuity for this complex organiza
tion that we as students obviously
cannot. Bureaucracy stinks, but com
plaining won't make it go away.
Nevertheless, actions speak louder
than words, and only the accomplish
ments of the ASSU in the year to come
can validate the words you read today.
And it is here that I have the most
confidence. The COP this year consists
of four incredibly hard-working
people with plenty of knowledge of,
and experience with, the ASSU. The
senate consists of mostly new mem
bers, each one filled with new ideas,
perspectives and a lot of energy and
ambition. Interest in University com
mittees and "task forces" is incredibly
strong this year, and it is clear to
everyone involved that this year will
be one of great action for the ASSU.
Chris Adamson uses bureaucracy as
a scapegoat for his unwillingness to
participate with the ASSU, claiming
that the red tape prevents anything
from getting accomplished. People
control bureaucracy, not vice versa,
and this year the ASSU will demon
strate that it Is strong enough to
overcome paperwork, bureaucracy
and, yes, even Daily columnists.

Wake up, Mr. Pisano, this is the '80s.
1 would think that the administration
would be happy that Stanford stu
dents, supposedly some of the bright
est students in the nation, still know
how to have a good time. Stanford
prides itself on having a well-rounded,
outgoing student body, yet the actions
of the administration serve constantly
to squelch the social side of a Stanford
student; the side that makes us so
unique. Granted, for some students
the party scene is not their style, but
for those of us who do enjoy going to
fraternity parties, I ask the administra

tion to allow us to have our fun.
Finally, I want to ask the students
how much of your free social time is
spent at fraternity parties. If the an
swer for you is a good portion, then I
ask you not to stand by indifferently
and watch the administration disband
one fraternity after another. Let them
know that we don't want Stanford to
become the MIT of the West

ASSU can rise
above criticism
There are two sides to every story,
and Chris Adamson (The Daily, Oct. 7)
has not presented either. Instead, he
has presented a negative and unin
formed criticism of an organization
about which he apparently kncftvs very
little. •
The main criticism of the ASSU
seems to be that even were the ASSU
to have some good ideas, no one
would be willing to help. He claims
that since students do not feel they are
benefiting personally from the ASSU,
they therefore have no motivation to
get involved with it. By taking one
look around Stanford, we can clearly
see that this is not true. Dozens of
organizations on campus exist that
entail students working together
toward a goal from which they will
not directly benefit.
Chris Adamson also claims that
there are no links between the gov
ernment and the students "it's
supposed to serve." Does ASSU stand
for Associated Slave of Stanford Uni
versity? Of course not. The purpose of
the ASSU is to represent the interests
of the students and assist them in
planning and accomplishing their
goals. The ASSU exists to represent
student views to the administration
and to assist and coordinate students'
interests into feasible plans of action.
The ASSU offers a set of recourse that
no other student group can offer:
energetic, hardworking people with
diverse knowledge and experiences
who are willing to help you.
For example, since the time of last
year's vote when Stanford students

called for divestment, the ASSU Senate
and COP have taken the responsibility
to make sure that the University feels
pressured by the students. Presently,
(University President) Donald Ken
nedy has agreed to discuss his view
point on the issue with senate, COP
and SOSA members, so that we will
know which angle of the situation to
hit hardest. Other projects, such as the
Western Culture issue, the mistreat
ment of Stanford workers and the
funding cut of five sports last spring,
have had much student interest and
support and are priorities on the
ASSU agenda this fall.
However, not all of Mr. Adamson's
criticisms are completely off-track.
Bureaucracy exists throughout Ameri
can society, and the ASSU is no excep
tion. The paperwork involved in
implementing any project or idea is
overwhelming! Nevertheless, rather
than moan and groan about it, we
should instead realize that the paper
work and regulations provide the
continuity for this complex organiza
tion that we as students obviously
cannot. Bureaucracy stinks, but com
plaining won't make it go away.
Nevertheless, actions speak louder
than words, and only the accomplish
ments of the ASSU in the year to come
can validate the words you read today.
And it is here that I have the most
confidence. The COP this year consists
of four incredibly hard-working
people with plenty of knowledge of,
and experience with, the ASSU. The
senate consists of mostly new mem
bers, each one filled with new ideas,
perspectives and a lot of energy and
ambition. Interest in University com
mittees and "task forces" is incredibly
strong this year, and it is clear to
everyone involved that this year will
be one of great action for the ASSU.
Chris Adamson uses bureaucracy as
a scapegoat for his unwillingness to
participate with the ASSU, claiming
that the red tape prevents anything
from getting accomplished. People
control bureaucracy, not vice versa,
and this year the ASSU will demon
strate that it Is strong enough to
overcome paperwork, bureaucracy
and, yes, even Daily columnists.

University frat
policy is juvenile
Before I start, just let me say that I
am not a member of any fraternity,
nor am I sure that I ever intend to
become a member of one. However,
the administration's policy toward
fraternal life on campus has become
so juvenile that I can no longer
remain silent on this issue..
When I came to Stanford last year,
the thing that I was most impressed
with was the students' ability to bal
ance hard work and fun. I found
Stanford students knew how to put in
the work necessary to get the most
out of their education. Yet, when it
came time to unwind, Stanford stu
dents also knew how to party. The
administration, at that time, seemed
very up-to-date in realizing the impor
tance of balancing work and play.
However, all of a sudden this once
"hip" administration appears to be
getting more archaic by the day.
The clincher came on Friday, Oct.
10 when a front-page headline in The
Daily read, "Frat suspended for rowdy
party." In the following article Frater
nal Affairs Advisor Joe Pisano was
quoted as saying, "The mental picture
of men dressed in boxer shorts and
women scantily clad, all soaked in
beer, raises some questions." Horror
of horrors! The electric chair wouldn't
be a severe enough punishment for
those naughty boys and girls. The only
question their actions rose would be
why I chose that night to stay home
and study.
Wake up, Mr. Pisano, this is the '80s.
