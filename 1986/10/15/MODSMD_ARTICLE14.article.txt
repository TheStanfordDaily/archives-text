# Italy, Yankees: history repeats itself

### 
"ITALIAN GOVERNMENT COLLAPSES," the
headline screamed as I picked up the paper this sum
mer. I flipped to the sports section and was greeted
by the title 'Tankess sink 7 1/2 behind — Steinbren
ner may fire Piniella" Hadn't I read both of these
items many times before? Was there a link between
the two? I decided to look into the matter and discov
ered that the history of the New York Yankees since
George Steinbrenner became the controlling share
holder in 1973 provides the perfect analytic tool for
understanding post-World War II Italian politics.

Both institutions have grand histories rich in tradi
tion. The Roman Empire spanned huge distances and
lasted many centuries, while the Yankees achieved
similar dominance over baseball from the late '20s
through the '30s and during the years 1948-1963. It is
since 1945 and 1973, respectively, that the parallels
have become particularly striking. To begin with, one
force has remained in power in each of the situa
tions. In Italy, the Democratic Christian parry (DC)
has never been excluded from government, while
Steinbrenner has stayed in firm control of the
Yankees during his tenure. He may actually wield
more power over the Yankees than the DC does over
Italy — he owns 55 percent (a majority) of the stock.
The DCs share of the vote peaked with a total of 48 5
percent in 1948, and has gradually declined to ap
proximately 35 percent. Be that as it may, the fact

remains that there has been a constant agent of
power in both circumstances.
PA Allum in his book "Italy: Republic Without
Government?" discusses the phenomenon of cabinet
instability and ministerial stability in Italian politics.
Ministers serve the government, lose their jobs when
the government collapses, and then promptly return
to power as heads of a new government. Alcide
DeGasperi formed eight separate governments,
while Amintore Fanfani created five and Mariano
Rumor started four. A similar phenomenon has oc
curred with the Yankees. The durable Billy Martin
has managed on four occasions (so far), while Bob
Lemon and Dick Howser have each led the team
twice. Thus an examination of Yankee history under
Steinbrenner helps to understand the contemporary
Italian political scene.
Almost all Italian prime ministers have belonged
to the DC. In a similar fashion, many of the Yankee
managers have been members of the "Yankee fam
ily" prior to running the club. Lou Piniella (the cur
rent manager), Martin and Berra all played for the
Yankees. Gene Michael was the team's general
manager before his stint, while Clyde King and Dick
Howser coached the team. Prime ministers outside
the DC such as Republican Giovanni Sp.idolini and
Socialist Bettino Craxi — the current prime minister
— may be compared to ex-Yankee skippers like Bob
Lemon and Bill Virdon, both of whose only previous
contact with the club before their managerial roles
came as opposing players.
The terms of tenure are short in both institutions.
The shortest government, the eighth DeGasperi gov
ernment, lasted a mere 12 days; the first Craxi gov
ernment set longevity records when it lasted slightlv
longer than three years. The second Craxi govern
ment is the 45th post-war government, an average of
slightly more than one government per year. As for
the Yankees, Bob Lemon was fired only 14 games

into the 1982 season, and Martin's first tenure of
three seasons (1975-1978) remains the longevity
standard for managers under Steinbrenner. Lou
Piniella became the 14th Yankee manager since 1973
this spring, also an average of slightly more than one
change per year. Thus the analysis works on a statisti
cal a»mvell as a theoretical level.
Both institutions promise stability while they
practice instability. Each Italian government sends
out the message that this time it will last; Steinbren
ner repeatedly declares that the manager will stay in
command for a long time.
The reality of both situations has given the lie to
these promises and has been described in book
forms. Sparky Lyle wrote "The Bronx Zoo" and told
about the turbulent 1978 season. Giuseppe DiPalma
penned "Surviving Without Governing," about the
Italian political process. Thus both institutions issue
grand proclamations that are refuted by less idealistic
observers.
Finally, both Italy and the Yankees presently find
themselves in less prominent positions than they did
previously. Italy, while unquestionably an important
country, possesses virtually nothing of its once
mighty empire, and cannot claim to be a super
power. The Yankees were recently eliminated by the
Boston Red Sox and have not won a divisional title in
five years. Both institutions bemoan their decline and
occasionally harken back to the days of yore when
they reigned supreme in their respective endeavors.
Flipping further through the sports pages, 1 found
an article about the Celtics and the Lakers. I wonder
what the history of their rivalry would tell me about
U.S.-Soviet relations.

has managed on four occasions (so far), while Bob
Lemon and Dick Howser have each led the team
twice. Thus an examination of Yankee history under
Steinbrenner helps to understand the contemporary
Italian political scene.
Almost all Italian prime ministers have belonged
to the DC. In a similar fashion, many of the Yankee
managers have been members of the "Yankee fam
ily" prior to running the club. Lou Piniella (the cur
rent manager), Martin and Berra all played for the
Yankees. Gene Michael was the team's general
manager before his stint, while Clyde King and Dick
Howser coached the team. Prime ministers outside
the DC such as Republican Giovanni Sp.idolini and
Socialist Bettino Craxi — the current prime minister
— may be compared to ex-Yankee skippers like Bob
Lemon and Bill Virdon, both of whose only previous
contact with the club before their managerial roles
came as opposing players.
The terms of tenure are short in both institutions.
The shortest government, the eighth DeGasperi gov
ernment, lasted a mere 12 days; the first Craxi gov
ernment set longevity records when it lasted slightlv
longer than three years. The second Craxi govern
ment is the 45th post-war government, an average of
slightly more than one government per year. As for
the Yankees, Bob Lemon was fired only 14 games

into the 1982 season, and Martin's first tenure of
three seasons (1975-1978) remains the longevity
standard for managers under Steinbrenner. Lou
Piniella became the 14th Yankee manager since 1973
this spring, also an average of slightly more than one
change per year. Thus the analysis works on a statisti
cal a»mvell as a theoretical level.
Both institutions promise stability while they
practice instability. Each Italian government sends
out the message that this time it will last; Steinbren
ner repeatedly declares that the manager will stay in
command for a long time.
The reality of both situations has given the lie to
these promises and has been described in book
forms. Sparky Lyle wrote "The Bronx Zoo" and told
about the turbulent 1978 season. Giuseppe DiPalma
penned "Surviving Without Governing," about the
Italian political process. Thus both institutions issue
grand proclamations that are refuted by less idealistic
observers.
Finally, both Italy and the Yankees presently find
themselves in less prominent positions than they did
previously. Italy, while unquestionably an important
country, possesses virtually nothing of its once
mighty empire, and cannot claim to be a super
power. The Yankees were recently eliminated by the
Boston Red Sox and have not won a divisional title in
five years. Both institutions bemoan their decline and
occasionally harken back to the days of yore when
they reigned supreme in their respective endeavors.
Flipping further through the sports pages, 1 found
an article about the Celtics and the Lakers. I wonder
what the history of their rivalry would tell me about
U.S.-Soviet relations.

"ITALIAN GOVERNMENT COLLAPSES," the
headline screamed as I picked up the paper this sum
mer. I flipped to the sports section and was greeted
by the title 'Tankess sink 7 1/2 behind — Steinbren
ner may fire Piniella" Hadn't I read both of these
items many times before? Was there a link between
the two? I decided to look into the matter and discov
ered that the history of the New York Yankees since
George Steinbrenner became the controlling share
holder in 1973 provides the perfect analytic tool for
understanding post-World War II Italian politics.

Both institutions have grand histories rich in tradi
tion. The Roman Empire spanned huge distances and
lasted many centuries, while the Yankees achieved
similar dominance over baseball from the late '20s
through the '30s and during the years 1948-1963. It is
since 1945 and 1973, respectively, that the parallels
have become particularly striking. To begin with, one
force has remained in power in each of the situa
tions. In Italy, the Democratic Christian parry (DC)
has never been excluded from government, while
Steinbrenner has stayed in firm control of the
Yankees during his tenure. He may actually wield
more power over the Yankees than the DC does over
Italy — he owns 55 percent (a majority) of the stock.
The DCs share of the vote peaked with a total of 48 5
percent in 1948, and has gradually declined to ap
proximately 35 percent. Be that as it may, the fact

remains that there has been a constant agent of
power in both circumstances.
PA Allum in his book "Italy: Republic Without
Government?" discusses the phenomenon of cabinet
instability and ministerial stability in Italian politics.
Ministers serve the government, lose their jobs when
the government collapses, and then promptly return
to power as heads of a new government. Alcide
DeGasperi formed eight separate governments,
while Amintore Fanfani created five and Mariano
Rumor started four. A similar phenomenon has oc
curred with the Yankees. The durable Billy Martin
has managed on four occasions (so far), while Bob
Lemon and Dick Howser have each led the team
twice. Thus an examination of Yankee history under
Steinbrenner helps to understand the contemporary
Italian political scene.
