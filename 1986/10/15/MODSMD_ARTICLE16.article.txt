# Apartheid: the 'in' issue
## 
### 
Over the last two years, I have never seen more bizarre
and interesting development as the student obsession with
South Africa. Here you have the whole range of actors:
liberal zealots, right-wing pragmatists, tough cops arresting
limp students, and administrators telling everyone to stay
calm. Yet I still cannot agree with those who believe this
issue is so important and worthy of all this effort.
For all their religious zeal in pursuing the "freedom of
blacks in South Africa," several questions need to be raised
and answered in many of my fellow non-activists' minds.
First: Why South Africa?
There are many other regions on this globe that have far
worse problems than South Africa. The most blatant exam
ple is the war that is going on in Afghanistan. Forget about
equality and freedom;,it's a full scale war. Entire villages
have been destroyed, mass executions have been carried
out regularly, and chemical weapons have been allegedly
used against the insurgents. The loss of life there is of an en
tirely different magnitude than that in South Africa.

I know what you're thinking: "Yeah, Afghanistan. Sure it's
bad but it's been that way since 1980. Besides, there's noth
ing we can do." To many of us, the deaths there are distant
and easily forgotten. It's also not blatant racial violence like
in South Africa. Most of all, however, we don't see the mas
sacres there on the 5 o'clock news.
That does not make the killing any less wrong or less im
portant than what is going on in South Africa. If your con
cern is with human life and real atrocities, you're looking at
the wrong place when you look to the southern tip of Africa.
Another example is Ethiopia. There you have a Marxist
government that possesses the largest standing army south
of the Sahara. To fund this war machine there has been
heavy military expenditures at the expense of the popula
tion's survival. There has been forced collectivization with
many people dying in transit or in squalid camps. Many of
the separatist rebels within the country are being cordoned
off and slowly starved to death.
What about the Soviet Union itself? A nation that shot
down a Korean airline into the sea. A nation paranoid of its
own population. A country with forced labor camps in the
wastes of Siberia and a continuous frontier of barbed wire
and border guards used not only to keep others out, but its
own population in. A nation that blacklists those who
practice religion and abuses Jews.
But enough of these cases. On the moral repugnance
scale, the issues in South Africa take an easy second place to
the violence in these areas and in countries like Cambodia,
Chile and Lebanon.
Then there is the question of divestment. Why this partic
ular route? To the students, it was the only tenuous link that
they had with the situation in South Africa. From their logic,
we should get the Universtiy to sell the shares of stock it
owns of corporations that do business with South Africa.
The idea that this could have a profound effect on South
Africa's government is almost laughable. The South Africans
have shown a vers' strong will in refusing to bow to pressure
from abroad, and it is more than likely that they could

survive economically without any foreign assistance. In
response to the rest of the world halting shipments of mili
tary supplies to South Africa, the South Africans built up an
arms industry from scratch and now even exports its weap
ons to other countries of the world
Even if you divest from corporations that deal in South
Africa, what good does it do? Sure, you've made a moral
gesture. Big deal. When its done with, you have no leverage
left. Many argue that the presence of American corporations
has a positive effect in the country due to their subscription
to the Sullivan principles. Some go so far as to advocate
more investment there to give the United States more eco
nomic influence.
Furthermore, the stock we divest ourselves of will now
belong to someone else who obviously will not have the
same qualms about owning South African stocks as the
protestors do. There are plenty of people in the world — a
majority it seems — that would gladly sacrifice their
morality for a few dollars.
Instead of divesting from corporations to achieve some
result, it would seem logical to buy as many shares of these
companies as possible. If you know how stocks work, you
realize that owning a share of the company gives you some
control over it. The more stock you own, the more de facto
control you possess over the company. With the assistance
of other stockholders, it would then be possible to force
management to make changes or even remove the
managers if they don't. That's why the companies are called
public corporations. They are responsible to shareholders.
Then there is the sanctions movement. Recent acts of
Congress, for example, border on the ridiculous. For every
sanction you slap on the South Africans, they'll find two
loopholes. So what if "there will be no new investment in
South Africa." They'll only be slightly inconvenienced by
getting it through off-shore front companies or third-party
transactions. So what if you restrict direct flights from South
Africa. All they'll do now is make a stop in Lesotho or in
Europe. An inconvenience, but hardly a crushing blow to
push them to get rid of apartheid. These actions and others
have not helped the blacks in South Africa. Hasn't it become
obvious that the more the white leadership is antagonized,
the more resilient they get? It's very dangerous to back a de
termined man into a corner. Instead of wilting under the
pressure, he only gets more dangerous and stubborn.
I guess what really makes this the"in" issue on campus is
the racial element involved. The United States still has a
great deal to surmount in its own racial problems, and many
of us cannot stand to see a Western government based on
the suppression of blacks. Notice that I didn't say the
suppression of "people" in general, but "blacks" in particu
lar. There are many oppressed people in the world far
worse off than the South African blacks. We can handle gen
eral oppression in other parts of the globe — we've become
desensitized to it. Yet we can't handle discriminatory
oppression. To many, that's doubly wrong. Yet, I think it's
time we stopped looking at the world in black and white
and instead started focusing on who are the worst oppres
sors and who are the most impoverished victims. In this
light, is South Africa still the most important issue? I doubt
it.

ple is the war that is going on in Afghanistan. Forget about
equality and freedom;,it's a full scale war. Entire villages
have been destroyed, mass executions have been carried
out regularly, and chemical weapons have been allegedly
used against the insurgents. The loss of life there is of an en
tirely different magnitude than that in South Africa.

I know what you're thinking: "Yeah, Afghanistan. Sure it's
bad but it's been that way since 1980. Besides, there's noth
ing we can do." To many of us, the deaths there are distant
and easily forgotten. It's also not blatant racial violence like
in South Africa. Most of all, however, we don't see the mas
sacres there on the 5 o'clock news.
That does not make the killing any less wrong or less im
portant than what is going on in South Africa. If your con
cern is with human life and real atrocities, you're looking at
the wrong place when you look to the southern tip of Africa.
Another example is Ethiopia. There you have a Marxist
government that possesses the largest standing army south
of the Sahara. To fund this war machine there has been
heavy military expenditures at the expense of the popula
tion's survival. There has been forced collectivization with
many people dying in transit or in squalid camps. Many of
the separatist rebels within the country are being cordoned
off and slowly starved to death.
What about the Soviet Union itself? A nation that shot
down a Korean airline into the sea. A nation paranoid of its
own population. A country with forced labor camps in the
wastes of Siberia and a continuous frontier of barbed wire
and border guards used not only to keep others out, but its
own population in. A nation that blacklists those who
practice religion and abuses Jews.
But enough of these cases. On the moral repugnance
scale, the issues in South Africa take an easy second place to
the violence in these areas and in countries like Cambodia,
Chile and Lebanon.
Then there is the question of divestment. Why this partic
ular route? To the students, it was the only tenuous link that
they had with the situation in South Africa. From their logic,
we should get the Universtiy to sell the shares of stock it
owns of corporations that do business with South Africa.
The idea that this could have a profound effect on South
Africa's government is almost laughable. The South Africans
have shown a vers' strong will in refusing to bow to pressure
from abroad, and it is more than likely that they could

survive economically without any foreign assistance. In
response to the rest of the world halting shipments of mili
tary supplies to South Africa, the South Africans built up an
arms industry from scratch and now even exports its weap
ons to other countries of the world
Even if you divest from corporations that deal in South
Africa, what good does it do? Sure, you've made a moral
gesture. Big deal. When its done with, you have no leverage
left. Many argue that the presence of American corporations
has a positive effect in the country due to their subscription
to the Sullivan principles. Some go so far as to advocate
more investment there to give the United States more eco
nomic influence.
Furthermore, the stock we divest ourselves of will now
belong to someone else who obviously will not have the
same qualms about owning South African stocks as the
protestors do. There are plenty of people in the world — a
majority it seems — that would gladly sacrifice their
morality for a few dollars.
Instead of divesting from corporations to achieve some
result, it would seem logical to buy as many shares of these
companies as possible. If you know how stocks work, you
realize that owning a share of the company gives you some
control over it. The more stock you own, the more de facto
control you possess over the company. With the assistance
of other stockholders, it would then be possible to force
management to make changes or even remove the
managers if they don't. That's why the companies are called
public corporations. They are responsible to shareholders.
Then there is the sanctions movement. Recent acts of
Congress, for example, border on the ridiculous. For every
sanction you slap on the South Africans, they'll find two
loopholes. So what if "there will be no new investment in
South Africa." They'll only be slightly inconvenienced by
getting it through off-shore front companies or third-party
transactions. So what if you restrict direct flights from South
Africa. All they'll do now is make a stop in Lesotho or in
Europe. An inconvenience, but hardly a crushing blow to
push them to get rid of apartheid. These actions and others
have not helped the blacks in South Africa. Hasn't it become
obvious that the more the white leadership is antagonized,
the more resilient they get? It's very dangerous to back a de
termined man into a corner. Instead of wilting under the
pressure, he only gets more dangerous and stubborn.
I guess what really makes this the"in" issue on campus is
the racial element involved. The United States still has a
great deal to surmount in its own racial problems, and many
of us cannot stand to see a Western government based on
the suppression of blacks. Notice that I didn't say the
suppression of "people" in general, but "blacks" in particu
lar. There are many oppressed people in the world far
worse off than the South African blacks. We can handle gen
eral oppression in other parts of the globe — we've become
desensitized to it. Yet we can't handle discriminatory
oppression. To many, that's doubly wrong. Yet, I think it's
time we stopped looking at the world in black and white
and instead started focusing on who are the worst oppres
sors and who are the most impoverished victims. In this
light, is South Africa still the most important issue? I doubt
it.
Victor Vescovo is a senior in economics.
Over the last two years, I have never seen more bizarre
and interesting development as the student obsession with
South Africa. Here you have the whole range of actors:
liberal zealots, right-wing pragmatists, tough cops arresting
limp students, and administrators telling everyone to stay
calm. Yet I still cannot agree with those who believe this
issue is so important and worthy of all this effort.
For all their religious zeal in pursuing the "freedom of
blacks in South Africa," several questions need to be raised
and answered in many of my fellow non-activists' minds.
First: Why South Africa?
