# Trustees vote to divest of $4.5 million
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The University Board of Trustees yesterday
approved divestment of nearly $4.5 million in
stock held in Schlumberger Ltd. and Grey Ad
vertising.
Until yesterday's meeting, Stanford had sold
stock worth $359,900 in divesting from two
other companies with operations in South
Africa.
There's still a lot more to be done," said
Operations Research Prof. Frederick Hillier,
chairman of the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR). ' But I think people will
realize that lx>th the CIR and the trustees are
serious about carrying out selective divest
ment."
But a student member of Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA) said Stanford should sell
all of its stock in companies that operate in
South Africa — more than $189 million in 66
companies.
Junior Stacey Levton said companies operat

ins in South Africa do more harm than gcxxl
since their taxes support the enforcement of
apartheid. Even so, Levton called yesterday's ac
tion "a big victory for the ami apartheid ino\e
ment."
The move by the trustees gives the CIR a i-()
record this year on divestment recommen
dations.
The CIR, which advises the trustees on invest
ment decisions related to social issues, has also
successfully argued for the sale of the Univer
sity's stock in Diamond Shamrock Corp. and
Newmont Mining. The commission s 12 mem
bers include students, faculty, staff and alumni.
CIR Chairman Hillier said the commission
will scrutinize the South African activities of at
least 22 more companies in the Stanford
portfolio during this school year.
The CIR in May gave three reasons for divest
ing from Schlumberger, an oil company based
in France.
I he commission based its decision partially
on Schlumberger's lack of adherence to the
Sullivan Principles.

The six Sullivan Principles constitute a racial
policy for U.S. companies operating in South
Africa and aim to promote racial equality in that
nation. Participation is voluntary, and only a
handful of companies in the Stanford portfolio
have not signed their agreement to the prin
ciples.
In addition, the CIR said Schlumherger is not
a known member of any organization in South
Africa working against apartheid and criticized
Schlumherger s contention that it would not be
appropriate for it to take positions on social is
sues such as apartheid.
"CIR s guidelines are based on the principle
that to justify its doing business in South Africa,
a company in which Stanford is invested must
take political positions," says the ClR's May
leport.
The tiustees postponed a decision until yes
terdav's meeting while the trustees' Special
Committee on Investment Responsibility
(SCIR) attempted to acquire further informa
tion from Schlumherger on its apartheid
combatting activities.

University President Donald Kennedv, a
member of the SCIR. said Friday that
Schlumherger was dragging its feet in provid
ing that information.
Stanford owns 124.000 shares of
Schlumherger that on Mondav were valued at
$4,123,000.
The CIR recommended last month that the
University divest from Grey Advertising and
buy no further stock in I.octite Corp The trus
tees decided yesterday to do both.
The University's 3,800 shares of Grey Adver
tising stock were valued at $342,000 on Mon
day. The CIR voted in September to recom
mend divestment from Loctite, but changed its
advice upon learning that Stanford had already
sold the stock for economic reasons.
In its September recommendation, the CIR
said Grey Advertising "did not sign the Sullivan
Principles until June 1986 — substantially after
many other United States companies with in
vestments in South Africa had signed and sub
stantially after the recent heightening of gov
ernment repressions in South Africa."

In addition, the New York-based firm
belongs to neither the U.S. Corporate Council
on South Africa nor the American Chamber of
Commerce in South Africa. The CIR considers
membership in those organizations to be an in
dicator ot an activist, ;inti-apartheid commit
ment.
Loctite, based in Newington, Conn., sells in
dustrial and consumer adhesives and sealants
through Loctite (South Africa) Party, Ltd.
According to the CIR report, Loctite does not
belong to the U.S. Corporate Council on South
Africa, and"the CIR found Loctite's attitude
toward the Sullivan Principles or their substan
tial equivalent inadequate, (and) its member
ship in the (American Chamber of Commerce)
passive."
The board's action came one week after the
University decided to sell its 30,600 shares of
Diamond Shamrock Corp. valued at about
$350,000.
Stanford's total shareholdings are valued at
about $1.5 billion.

buy no further stock in I.octite Corp The trus
tees decided yesterday to do both.
The University's 3,800 shares of Grey Adver
tising stock were valued at $342,000 on Mon
day. The CIR voted in September to recom
mend divestment from Loctite, but changed its
advice upon learning that Stanford had already
sold the stock for economic reasons.
In its September recommendation, the CIR
said Grey Advertising "did not sign the Sullivan
Principles until June 1986 — substantially after
many other United States companies with in
vestments in South Africa had signed and sub
stantially after the recent heightening of gov
ernment repressions in South Africa."

In addition, the New York-based firm
belongs to neither the U.S. Corporate Council
on South Africa nor the American Chamber of
Commerce in South Africa. The CIR considers
membership in those organizations to be an in
dicator ot an activist, ;inti-apartheid commit
ment.
Loctite, based in Newington, Conn., sells in
dustrial and consumer adhesives and sealants
through Loctite (South Africa) Party, Ltd.
According to the CIR report, Loctite does not
belong to the U.S. Corporate Council on South
Africa, and"the CIR found Loctite's attitude
toward the Sullivan Principles or their substan
tial equivalent inadequate, (and) its member
ship in the (American Chamber of Commerce)
passive."
The board's action came one week after the
University decided to sell its 30,600 shares of
Diamond Shamrock Corp. valued at about
$350,000.
Stanford's total shareholdings are valued at
about $1.5 billion.
The University Board of Trustees yesterday
approved divestment of nearly $4.5 million in
stock held in Schlumberger Ltd. and Grey Ad
vertising.
Until yesterday's meeting, Stanford had sold
stock worth $359,900 in divesting from two
other companies with operations in South
Africa.
There's still a lot more to be done," said
Operations Research Prof. Frederick Hillier,
chairman of the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR). ' But I think people will
realize that lx>th the CIR and the trustees are
serious about carrying out selective divest
ment."
But a student member of Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA) said Stanford should sell
all of its stock in companies that operate in
South Africa — more than $189 million in 66
companies.
Junior Stacey Levton said companies operat

ins in South Africa do more harm than gcxxl
since their taxes support the enforcement of
apartheid. Even so, Levton called yesterday's ac
tion "a big victory for the ami apartheid ino\e
ment."
The move by the trustees gives the CIR a i-()
record this year on divestment recommen
dations.
The CIR, which advises the trustees on invest
ment decisions related to social issues, has also
successfully argued for the sale of the Univer
sity's stock in Diamond Shamrock Corp. and
Newmont Mining. The commission s 12 mem
bers include students, faculty, staff and alumni.
CIR Chairman Hillier said the commission
will scrutinize the South African activities of at
least 22 more companies in the Stanford
portfolio during this school year.
The CIR in May gave three reasons for divest
ing from Schlumberger, an oil company based
in France.
I he commission based its decision partially
on Schlumberger's lack of adherence to the
Sullivan Principles.

The six Sullivan Principles constitute a racial
policy for U.S. companies operating in South
Africa and aim to promote racial equality in that
nation. Participation is voluntary, and only a
handful of companies in the Stanford portfolio
have not signed their agreement to the prin
ciples.
In addition, the CIR said Schlumherger is not
a known member of any organization in South
Africa working against apartheid and criticized
Schlumherger s contention that it would not be
appropriate for it to take positions on social is
sues such as apartheid.
"CIR s guidelines are based on the principle
that to justify its doing business in South Africa,
a company in which Stanford is invested must
take political positions," says the ClR's May
leport.
The tiustees postponed a decision until yes
terdav's meeting while the trustees' Special
Committee on Investment Responsibility
(SCIR) attempted to acquire further informa
tion from Schlumherger on its apartheid
combatting activities.

University President Donald Kennedv, a
member of the SCIR. said Friday that
Schlumherger was dragging its feet in provid
ing that information.
Stanford owns 124.000 shares of
Schlumherger that on Mondav were valued at
$4,123,000.
