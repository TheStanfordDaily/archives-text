## All that it's Krakow-ed up to be 
### LOW SILVER 
When the nuclear accident occured at Chernobyl
last spring, a cloud spread all the way to Stanford's
Overseas Studies program.
Launching its pilot program in Krakow, Poland,
Overseas Studies found that few students were will
ing to brave possible radiation exposure to gain an
inside view of life behind the Iron Curtain. However,
25 Stanford undergraduates did go, returning en
riched, not glowing.
For eight weeks in the summer, the students
studied at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, taking
courses taught by English-speaking professers and
living in the university's dorms.
Termed a success by Nancy Padgett, deputy direc
tor of Overseas Studies, the program will be offered
again this summer quarter, with plans to move it to
spring quarter by 'a7-'BB.
About 40 to 50 people initially expressed interest
in the program, according to Rob Graham and Jenny
Polanski, participants. Padgett, however, asserted that
only nine people dropped out.
Nine didn't strike us as a large number since our
(Overseas Studies) programs always have an attri
tion rate," she said. Padgett also commented that not
all of the drop-outs were related to Chernobyl.
'I know that Chernobyl scared more than a few
people away and so did terrorism," said Graham.
To Polanski, Chernobyl was "something to be con
cerned about."
Stanford checked into it, and they wouldn't have
sent us if it was dangerous," she said "I really wanted

to go, and as long as Stanford didn't cancel the pro
gram, I knew I would take advantage of it'
Once the students arrived in Poland, Chernobyl
became less of a concern.
"We didn't really think about it," said Graham.
"There were some jokes about bad lettuce and don't
drink the milk, but other than that it was far from our
minds."
In fact, both the students and Padgett suspect that
the Polish government imported food for the stu
dents.
Living and studying in a communist country posed

no problems for the students, who experienced no
run-ins with the Polish government.
"We felt very welcome there; in fact, we were al
most heroes," commented Graham. "Most Poles had
never met an American before." -
In addition, Padgett stated that "both the govern
ment and the Jagiellonian University were very anx
ious to have Stanford there." The government aided
Stanford by granting the students special visas that
allowed them an easier exchange of currency.
While in Poland, the students took courses in the
relationship of church and state, the history of the
Polish working class, Poland as tie between East and
West, and Polish literature and the arts. The classes
were taught in English by Polish professors.
According to Padgett, no major changes are set for
next year, other than changing some of the courses
to meet with students' recommendations.
"Our long-range goal," said Padgett, "is to link
with Stanford's center in Berlin so students could
study East-West relations there in the spring and then
at Poland in the summer."
Senior Kathy Healy, an international relations
major said, "the classes need a lot of work. There
needs to be a lot more diversity, but I know Stanford
is working on it."
"Being in Poland made the experience a lot more
meaningful," she added. "I was able to integrate what
I was learning in the classes with what I was seeing."
For Graham, it was "a very eye-opening experi
ence. We all really enjoyed the program. Poland has a
different political system, language, way of life. It is a
great way to broaden your horizens."
