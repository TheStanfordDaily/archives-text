# PSC helps students reach out

Owen House is known to many Stan
ford students only as "the building
next to the Campus Bike Shop."
But as the home of the University's
Public Service Center (PSC), Owen
House offers Stanford students a tre
mendous range of public service op
portunities, from supporting the devel
opment of Third World nations by
biking cross-country to working in a
shelter for runaway children to being a
tour guide at the Stanford University
Hospital.
Three years ago, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy became con
cerned that Stanford students weren't
involved enough in public service, ac
cording to Catherine Milton, current
director of the PSC.

Milton, who was originally ap
pointed by Kennedy to study methods
of increasing public service awareness
on campus, recommended the es
tablishment of a center where students
could go to find out about public ser
vice activities.
The following year, the University
opened Owen House, home of the
Stanford Volunteer Network (SVN),
Stanford-in-Government (SIG), the
Stanford International Development
Organization (SIDO) and Public Ser
vice Fellowship Programs.
The opportunites offered by these
various organizations are so diverse
that there is indeed something to at
tract and involve anyone. The SVN, for
instance, offers students the chance to
tutor children, participate in Adopt-a-
Grandparent, distribute food to low

income families in the surrounding
area or coach sports for East Palo Alto
elementary school students.
Other organizations are more politi
cally oriented. SIG specializes in fin
ding summer internships in Washing
ton, D.C. for Stanford students, while
SIDO sponsors educational programs
on Third World development, raises
money to fund overseas projects and
provides information on internships in
developing countries.
If all this still doesn't spark an inter
est, you can even come up with your
own ideas for public service and
receive a grant from the Public Service
Summer Fellowship to help you put
your plans into action.
In the past, students have used their
fellowships to counsel refugee
children from El Salvador and work for

Mother Theresa in Calcutta. Just last
summer, the Stanford Summer
Academy was created with a fellowship
to help combat East Palo Alto's 75 per
cent high school drop-out rate.
Response to the Public Service Cen
ter's programs has been increasing
every year. This fall's Reach Out Today
program, an effort to get every Stan
ford student out working for the com
munity on one day, has never received
so much support from the student
body, according to Megan Swezey, one
of the directors of the SVN.
Swezey feels that the increased
response is due in part to increased
publicity.
"Public service is becoming more
and more established here. It's seen as
something more and more people do
at Stanford," she said
Which means that the PSC is very
busy this year, according to Tim Stan
ton, assistant director of the PSC. '«
"I don't see any expansion for the
PSC in the near future, but the center is
very student-oriented. If a group of stu
dents shows up on our doorstep with a
good idea, then the center will expand
its programs."
Stanton estimates that 1,500 students
are involved on a regular basis with
PSC programs, while another 500 to
1,000 students are involved on more of
a part-time basis. There are more than
6,500 undergraduates here at Stanford.

As Milton says: "Part of being at Stan
ford is being part of a larger commu
nity and realizing your responsibilities
to that community."
The Public Service Center offers
ample opportunity for Stanford stu
dents to heed Milton's words.
