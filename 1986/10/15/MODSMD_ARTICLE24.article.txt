# Nickel's worth of info from the Bug

Before we sun today's inquisi
tion, let me apologize if last week's
column seemed a little disjointed. I
said that I would be responding to a
question about sound, but due to
space limitations I do that this
week. For some reason, the ques
tions got rearranged last time and
you may have read someone's last
name before finding out who he
was. There should be no more bugs
plaguing the Bug this week, so here
we go.
Dear Bug Me,
I have some Aiwa stereo equip
ment that I am very satisfied with.
However, I am unsure how to
pronounce "Aiwa," which is a mat
ter of tremendous concern to me. Is
it pronounced "eh-wab," "ayee
wah," "I-wab" or what? Please
clarify this for me.
— Uladmosnjeka Knaijnakopecza
The answer to this one was easily
found. I called an authorized Aiwa
dealer — Peninsula Audio-Video in
Belmont. According to the folks
there, the definitive pronunciation
is "I-wah."
Inquisitive Bug that I am, I
thought there might be some inter
esting etymology involved here, es
pecially given the fact that Aiwa's
headquarters are in New Jersey.
What I was really hoping for was
a story about how an Indian tribe
pioneered the turntable and that
"aiwa" was their word for high
fidelity.
The Aiwa people could not
oblige, however. They say that it is a
Japanese word for love and har
mony. Actually, that makes sense
since I remember from Western
Culture that some philosophers felt
that the body could be harmonized
by music
Dear Bug Me,
Is the rumor true that there are
bars on Hoover Tower because a
girl jumped off as a result of being
rejected by a sorority? How many
people bave killed themselves by
Jumping off Hoover Tower/'
— Chicken Little
This is very sad Robin Chandler
of the University Archives called my
attention to some back issues of
The Daily and the San Francisco
Chronicle. It seems that there were
two suicides off Hoover Tower in
1965. The first suicide from the
tower since its dedication in June

1941 occurred on Jan. 15,1965. The
victim was a 22-year-old Stanford
graduate student of philosophy
who had a straight-A record but was
apparently suffering from a serious
health problem. Later that same
year on Aug. 5, a 73-year-old Menlo
Park man jumped from the 285-foot
tower. He was also believed to have
been driven to the deed by poor
health.
According to Gary Gruber of the
Hoover Institution, there was
originally a "modified" railing on
the observation deck that was
replaced by fencing at some point.
The Chronicle's report of the
second suicide said that the obser
vation deck was immediately closed
so that a mesh could be put up.

Apparently, the rumor about the
sorority girl is false since I have
been unable to find a record of any
other suicides since those two.
Now for something a little less
heavy.
Dear Bug Me,
Why is there a Modess machine
(you know, it sells those things) in
the men's restroom (Room 32) at
Roble Gym?
— Fred
Perhaps a more appropriate
question here would be why are
you unable to utter, much less
write, the word "tampon" when
you don't even sign your last name.
The question is a valid one,
however, as the University is actu
ally selling tampons in the men's
room in question.
