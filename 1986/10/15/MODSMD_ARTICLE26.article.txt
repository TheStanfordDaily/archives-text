# Quake victims seek relief
## 
### 
In an effort to raise funds for victims of the earthquake
that inflicted widespread damage in the El Salvador capital
of San Salvador on Friday, the American Red Cross is asking
students, faculty and staff to donate at several locations
around campus.
All checks should be made payable to the American Red
Cross and can be placed in boxes at Tresidder, Meyer and
Green libraries and many of the dormitories around
campus.
Dormitories that are participating in the earthquake relief
program are Toyon, Branner, Wilbur, Stern, Roble, Lagunita,
Governor's Corner and the Italian House on the Row.
Poor and overcrowded residential neighborhoods were
among the areas hardest hit by the earthquake. The disaster
left at least 600 dead, approximately 10,000 wounded and
40,000 homeless.
Damage caused by the quake is expected to top $2 bil
lion.
