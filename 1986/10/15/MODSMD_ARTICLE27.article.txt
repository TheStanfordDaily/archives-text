## Stanford String Quartet opens 1986-87 season 
### GREG CAMENZIND 
The Stanford String Quartet opened its se
ries of performances for this year with a mar
velous concert last Friday night at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Their program — including music
from Mozart, Janacek and Beethoven —
featured challenging, unusual pieces that
would be most difficult for even a quartet of the
highest caliber. The artists met this challenge,
however, creating an evening of enjoyable, so
phisticated music.
The quartet was formed in 1983 by four fac
ulty members in the Stanford Music Depart
ment. Since then, as Stanford's ensemble-in
residence, the group has performed to great
critical acclaim both in the United States and in
Europe. The quartet's members are Andor Toth
and Roy Malan on first and second violin, Ber
nard Zaslav on viola and Stephen Harrison on
cello. The musicians have performed as soloists
with major symphonies and chamber en
sembles in London, Mexico, Cleveland, Los An
geles and San Francisco, and on various award
winning recorded works.

The first selection in the concert was
Wolfgang Mozart's Adagio and Fugue in C
minor, K. 546, a composition that has been des
cribed as having little passion and lacking in
spontaneity. In the program notes, it was spec
ulated that the piece was "from a more solemn,
earnest Mozart — the Masonic Mozart, per
haps" (whatever that means). In any case, upon
hearing the quartet's performance, it was clear
that the musicians had their work cut out for
them.
This was not a standard Mozart tune and,
therefore, was not graced with the pleasant airs
that are so popular with classical music fans.
Rather, the music was a bit somber, making the
performance all the more challenging to both
the musicians and the audience. Still, the
opening theme, as introduced by the violins,
was expressed with great intensity. This energy
in rendering the piece was maintained
throughout, as the theme was recapitulated in
cello and viola against the inversions played by
the violins. The fugue pattern was performed
brilliantly as each artist took his turn as the lead
voice.

The brief Mozart composition was followed
by a more recent musical work — the Quartet
No. 2, or "Intimate Letters" (1928), by Leos
Janacek. (I don't know how to pronounce his
last name either). Janacek composed the entire
work in just 22 days, shortly before his death at
the age of 74. The all-knowing program notes
state that "Intimate Letters'' is "a statement not
of youthful passion, but is instead the com
poser s confession of his long love for a woman
nearly 40 years his junior." Each of the four
movements was written to explore a different
stage in the composer's relationship to
Kamilla Stoesslova, who for 13 years was the
unacknowledged inspiration for his music."
The opening movement, as unraveled by the
Stanford Quartet, was not what one would ex
pea from its title. There was a surprising am
biguity in the musical expressions of the theme.
The rondo form of the beginning indicated a
changing, organic view of the relationship. The
movement alternated between pure expres
sions of love and complex turmoil, creating a
sense of indecision and longing.
The following movements continued the ex

ploration of the composer's changing feelings,
and were informed with a sense of foreboding.
These feelings were translated by the quartet's
precise playing, especially on the mix of piz
zicato and flourishes, into an emotional climax
— "a longing that resolves itself in fulfillment"
— depressing a musical portrait of Kamilla. The
quartet's mastery was evident in its interpre
tation of the music. The musical images of the
composer's last work were colored with great
tenderness and reflected on the Moravian
lyricism of Janacek's Czechoslovakian roots.
The third and final phase of the concert was
the Quartet in B-Flat Major, Op. 130 and Grosse
Fuge, Op. 133 of Ludwig van Beethoven. The ar
tists made a strong, vigorous presentation of
the sudden alternation of tempos and musical
themes, creating a "kaleidoscopic style" in the
first movement that sharply contrasted with the
lighter German folk-dance feeling of the third
and fourth movements. The emotional cul
mination of this work is in the cavatina, "an
emotional plunge into Beethoven's most inti
mate musical moment." (Here I beg to differ
with the program notes; what about the great

"Pastorale" symphony?) The four musicians
presented the cavatina with great sensitivity,
creating a melancholy reflection on beauty.
The Grosse Fuge journeys through a cycle of
musical themes that are deep and turbulent. Ac
cording to Kerman (someone important in
music criticism, I gather), die final movement
"orbits upon a private musical sphere of its
own, needing no other sounds, needing no
other universe."
A profound anxiety is evoked in Beethoven's
alternation of soft, light airs and darker, ques
tioning tones. At times, the swift and strong
voice of the first violin induced a vibrant, opti
mistic feel, only to be shadowed by the groping
darkness of the cello and viola.
Considered together, the concert's program
of music seems to have been intended to be
one of great challenges and uncommon styles.
The Stanford String Quartet wanted to try to put
on a "meaty selection of music, and none of
that 'nice stuff,' " as cellist Stephen Harrison put
it after the concert. Friday night's performance
was certainly "meaty," but it was also nice,
boding well for the rest of the Quartet's season.
