# Kathleen Turner shines in 'Peggy Sue'
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
These days, for an actress to be considered "serious," she
has to star in movies that have prestige written all over
them. From this principle we get the annual spate of movies
starring Jessica Lange, Meryl Streep and Sissy Spaceck,
movies duly commended by critics but which, with the oc
casional exception of an "Out of Africa," few people go to
see.
These "actressy" films don't have to be flops, however.
Hollywood could be more aggressive about promoting
them. Instead of the usual solemn ad campaigns, why don't
the studios ever try more colorful sales pitches? At screen
ings of Jessica Lange's "Country," for example, theatre
owners could have given free tickets to the first 50 couples
who came dressed as dirt-poor farmers. For now, though,
the Sarah Bernhardts of the day will have to take their com
mercial, lumps and wait for recognition at Oscar time.
One major actress who has neady avoided the cul-de-sac
of the obscure "serious" movie is Kathleen Turner. While
no less talented than the aforementioned trio, Turner has
appeared in popular romps like "Romancing the Stone" and
its unfortunate sequel, "The Jewel of the Nile," as well as the
more sophisticated "Prizzi's Honor."
Turner's unpredictability is her greatest asset: she's tri
umphed in such wild card roles as China Blue, the pros
titute in "Crimes of Passion," a part that would have had
most major actresses reaching for the nearest Joseph Papp
production in a hurry. The China Blue role, as well as
Turner's debut in "Body Heat," bring up the point that
Turner brings a noticeable sex appeal to her roles unlike,
say, Sissy Spaceck. (The interesting implication here is that

sex has no part at all to play in our serious, Oscar-minded
movies).
All this is a means of introducing "Peggy Sue Got
Married," a movie that soars largely because of Turner and
that will probably rank her among the contenders at the
next Academy Awards ceremony. In "Peggy Sue," Turner
plays the title character, a woman on the brink of both
divorce and middle age who decides to attend her 25th high
school reunion. Her teenage daughter persuades her to
wear her old prom dress to the reunion, but Peggy Sue can't
bring herself to enjoy the event. She feels her life has gone
nowhere since high-school; the appearance of her husband,
whom she married right after graduation, does little to
cheer her up.
But something mysterious happens at the reunion. Peggy
Sue meets the class nerd, only now he's a polished
entrepreneur, far more successful than any of the jocks who
used to insult him. They are crowned king and queen
of the reunion, and while onstage she passes out. Waking
U P> Peggy Sue finds herself back in 1960, during the final
weeks of her senior year in high school.
For audiences, this is familiar territory; one immediately
thinks of Back to the Future." But where that movie wittily
showed how the '50s would be a nightmare for an '80s teen
ager, "Peggy Sue Got Married" is about how an adult goes
back to a simpler time in life, when life's possibilities
seemed almost infinite. Thus "Peggy Sue" covers more
serious ground. Living her teenage life a second time,
Peggy Sue is ail-too aware that her grandparents will die
shortly, that Charlie (Nicolas Cage), the gangling boy she
goes out with, will prove to be an unfaithful husband.
Which is not to say that "Peggy Sue" isn't a very funny
film, because it is. Much of the humor comes from the fact
that '50s life seems hilarious to the grown-up Peggy Sue; she

cracks up when her father proudly brings home a new Ed
sel. Everything seems quaint and ridiculous to her. The one
bohemian in her high-school class wears black turtlenecks
and writes abysmal, Kerouac-inspired poetry. Charlie's big
dream is to become the next Fabian. And Peggy Sue's
mother gives her a serious talk, dourly telling her to avoid
having sex.
We laugh along with Peggy Sue, which is fine, until the
filmmakers decide to get serious. In its last half-hour, the
movie becomes very confused; it falls flat on its face and *
never quite gets up again. Writers Jerry Leichtling and Ar-. *'
lene decide that there's been enough gentle comedy,
now it's time for a lot of snuffling and sobbing to occur
onscreen. The script becomes a wet hanky. Peggy Sue tries

to break up with Charlie, so that she won't get pregnant and
be made to marry him the minute she's received her di
ploma. She also sees her grandparents one more time and,
in one very odd scene, her grandfather's lodge club holds a
mystic ceremony to send Peggy Sue back to the present.
Peggy Sue s town is presented as a slice of Norman Rock
well Americana, and all the people in it, with the exception
of the class nerd (who's really a smart guy, wouldn't you
know it), are caricatures of real people. We're a long way
from the small town of David Lynch's "Blue Velvet," where
the boy next door is redly a voyeur and where powerful
subconscious forces seem to lurk behind the corner deli. In


"fn^cg^u. I tfssS? nerd and PeBBy Sue (Barry Mllkr and Kithittn
Peggy Sue's town, things really do
seem funny and anachronistic, much
like Peggy Sue herself, a middle-aged
woman wearing the bobby sox of a
teenager.
For this reason, the movie doesn't
have any emotional payoff. When we're
asked to take things seriously, we can't.
And so the resolution of the plot seems

weak and disappointing. â€¢
The one consistent high note
throughout the movie is Kathleen
Turner's performance. She makes her
character immediately appealing.
What's more, Turner knows how to a a
with other actors, not at them, unlike
certain other grandes dames of Ameri
can movies. Thus the rest of the cast is
complemented by her performance,
and when we hear Marshall Crenshaw
(doing Buddy Holly, or is it the other
way around?) sing "Peggy Sue, I love
You," it's an understandable sentiment.
