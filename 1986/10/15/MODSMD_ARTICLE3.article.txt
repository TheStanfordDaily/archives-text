## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Although tewiT in number than at
previous anti-apartheid demonstra
tions, students calling for total divest
ment held a noon rally yesterday in
White Plaza.
Adrienne Rich, poet and a guest pro
fessor of English here this quarter, and
a South African Stanford student spoke
to about 90 people, a small crowd
compared to similar protests held last
year that often had more than 300
people.
Chanting and carrying banners,
about 60 protesters then marched
from White Plaza to the Hoover Institu
tion, where University trustees were
meeting in Stauffer Auditorium.
"My whole life has been apartheid.
Apartheid has determined where 1
could be born, where 1 could live,
whom I could marry, how much 1
could earn, where 1 could work, what
kind of work I could do — in fact, my
whole life," Bernie September, a
graduate student in counseling psy
chology who arrived from South Africa
three weeks ago, told the crowd.
"This is the first place I realized I'm
a South African. We want one person,
one vote. We want to be pan of the ma
chinery (of government)," she said.
Fred Gate, student representative on
the Board of Trustees' Academic Affairs

and Development Committee who at
tended yesterday's board meeting, said
chants of divest now could be heard
clearlv'at the meeting
"There was a visible tenseness," said
Gate, a third-year lav/ student. 'Feople
were sort of looking out the windows
at die banners beinx dioppevi.
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSa)
members said they did not think num
bers were low at the protest, which
they organized.
"For a rally in the first part of the
year, it's the largest turnout I've ever
seen," said SOSA member Stacey
Leyton. "We've never had this many
freshmen," she added
Leyton said SOSA members have
been studying successful divestment
campaigns at other schools, including
UC-Berkeley.
"We're going to be lobbying individ
ual trustees and pressuring the ones
who are sympathetic." she said
Stanford students voted by a two
thirds majority in favor of total divest
ment in a 1986 referendum and SOSA
activists said they hope to capitalize on
a sympathetic, but uncommitted,
majority.
"We're drawing new people into
being active. There's a lot of (passive)
support, but being involved is a real
important thing," SOSA member Mike
Schmitz said.


Approximately 90 students rallied for divestment yesterday. Protesters
marched to the Mark Hatfield Memorial Court outside the Hoover Institu-

Kym Boyman/Daily
tion and shouted down to University President Donald Kennedy and the
Board of Trustees.
