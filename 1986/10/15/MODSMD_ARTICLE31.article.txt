# CRUISE WITH YOU
## 
### 
Okay, it's time to stop kidding
around. Seriously. No, not
really. But this baby goes pretty
straightforward, because we've
got some serious things to tell
you this week. So look out.
New Theory I: It's more fun when
you work with others who are also
interest. And it works better,
too. In fact, it works so well
that there's a good chance
most of the things we've listed
on this page — all the issues
you see discussed here — will
have some action taken on
them this year. A damn good
chance. In fact, for some of
them crucial steps have already
been successfully taken.
New Theory II: Share the wealth.

We're learning a lot in our
jobs. But there's enough action
around here that it won't thin
out if we share it. In fact, it'll
get thicker. Another good rea
son for this page.
So what's a Task Force? A
Task Force is a group of people
who believe in accomplishing
at least one goal that they hold
in common. They work to
gether, dividing up tasks and
projects, using each others'
specialties and up tasks and
projects, using each others'
specialties and strengths to
produce results none of them
could do alone. Not even us
elected people.

Task Force members work with
someone from the Council of
Presidents and maybe a few
from the Senate, who together
advise them, offer any help
they can, and do an oversize
share of the hard work. Task
Forces can be led by a President
or by a student member. We
think they'll work. Because
some of them are working
already.
So what are Associates?
Associates are students who
take the opportunity to work
with a given service on a spe
cial project or in a special job.
They help design the job and
take credit for it when it works.
Or die doing it.
