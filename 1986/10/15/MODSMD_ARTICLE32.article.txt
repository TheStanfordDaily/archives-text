STUDENT HEALTH ADVISORY REVIEW
AND EVALUATION TASK FORCE
OBJECTIVE: Aid in upgrading services offered by Cowell Stu
dent Health Center.
We'll inject you with a virus to make you violently ill and
you'll get to see firsthand what it's like to be treated at Cowell.
You can find out how to make Cowell a swell place, one that
you'd want to vist even if you're not sick. Get a pool table in
stalled. A catering service. Hell, make it into a pub! Meet all the
nurses. Meet all the doctors. Have lunch with the director. Learn
about Captain Trips. Put it down on your med school application.
FUNDING ANALYSIS TASK FORCE
OBJECTIVE: Create a fair set of guidelines for the funding of
student groups.
Find out the best way to make funds fun. Be fundy. Have
fund. Make sure the money gets in the right hands. Control the
Program Board. Create loopholes so any studentt group with beer
and a band can get funding for a party. Or don't.
' Qualifications: Aggressivesness. Curiosity. Ability to make
keen, insightful comments and have them ignored by the Senate.
Statistics 60. (What a dumb course, huh?)
SANCTUARY AWARENESS BOARD
OBJECTIVE: Help raise awareness of the Sanctuary for Central
American refugees. t
Make pamphlets, conduct tours, learn how to milk a goat, hir
Nicaraguans, and generally help jseople who did not vote for
Reagan, not only because they were smart but because they were
in Central America.
Qualifications: Collect as many versions of the Cult's
Sanctuary as you can possibly find. Bring them to the next
KZSU dance-a-thon.
Pre-requisites: Russian 103, US Foreign Policy 101.
THE BUILD A SOVIET SUBMARINE
TASK FORCE
Qualifications: College algebra, one quarter of non-calculus
physics, advanced swimming. Some knowledge of nuclear ex
plosives preferred, but not required. Must be willing to travel.
THE PUB GROUP
OBJECTIVE: Read on.
God, do we need a pub. Hire bands. Hold a KZSU dance-a
thon. Serve beer. Serve wine. Serve your country. Establish a
pub. Call it the Keystone. Do it soon, so we can go there before
we graduate. Plan the whole thing. Make it bright and cheery.
Make it black and seamy. Put it in the Old Firehouse and make it
sort of dreamy.
THEME HOUSE DEVELOPMENT
OBJECTIVE: Develop a student report on theme house effec
tiveness.
1
Find out how students feel about theme houses. See if we
should divide the campus into mini-countries and conduct our
own wars. Or see if Hoover's Bunzel Report was just as profes
sional, objective, and non-biasedly scholarly as everything else
Hoover does.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TASK FORCE
OBJECTIVE: To research the effectiveness of Stanford's affirm
ative action program.
Ever notice how many of your professors are Andalusian?
Quite frankly, it's becoming a problem. You may not notice it in
class; you may not see it in questions on the problem sets; you
might not catch the fact that all the TAs are Andalusian as well.
But years from now, when you've left Stanford far behind, those
effects will still be there: you will have paid $68,00 for an
Adalusian education.
It's been said Stanford has one of the best affirmative action
programs in the country. Find out who said it.

VENTURE CAPITAL TASK FORCE
OBJECTIVE: To come up with new ideas for student-run busi
nesses and put them in place.
Money. Money everywhere. Most of it, unfortunately, is not
ours, nor is it yours. But we both came to Stanford to change
that.
Meet mercenary people, get to know them, and steal their
ideas. Start up businesses which will not make a profit until you
are gone. Put them on your resume and get a job with a high
paying firm in Cupertino. And remember, it's not your money
anyway, so what the hell.
CAMPUS SECURITY BOARD TASK FORCE
OBJECTIVE: To flag problems with police-community rela
tions and ensure the effectiveness of the new University police
advisory board by energizing ethnic and other communities af
fected by the police.
Something about those police: they just won't leave you
alone. They're so friendly these days — they do their damndest to
make sure students have their IDs with them day and night. Isn't
that nice? Yeah, really.
There is often a lack of communication between police and
the community on critical issues. The new University board to
deal with these relations can do a crucial examinaation of the real
problems — provided it has student input. That's what this Task
Force is for. I think.
COMMUNITY SERVICE BOARD TASK FORCE
OBJECTIVE: To develop a funding board that will use student
fees and external fundraising to give campus groups the resources
they need to do communtiy service.
"What?" you say. "Communist service needs money?" You
know it Thirty-five campus service groups that we know fo need
up to $50,000 a year to operate, but they can get nearly none of it
from us. We collect money from students only to give it right
back in certain types of programming — and community service
falls outside the bounds. See what you can do. We promise we
won't make you do a Hands Across America thing.
TASK FORCE ON STANFORD
STUDENT/WORKER RELATIONS
OBJECTIVE: To develop communication between workers and
students, particularly through a Day of Appreciation in the Spring
for Stanford's workers and students.
Many students don't know the person who cleans their dorm
or the people who make their meals. Some students don't want
to know the people who make their meals. Some people who
make meals don't want the students to know who they are. But
this is the exception. In general, there should be more interaction
between workers and students.
This Task Force is designed to help recognize the workers'
contributions to Stanford, specifically through the Frost celebra
tion it will organize one day in May.
