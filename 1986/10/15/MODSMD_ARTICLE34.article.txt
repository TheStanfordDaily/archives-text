## Women's soccer loses to San Francisco St. 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
The unpredictable, rowdy Gators of San Francisco State
came out on top yesterday afternoon in their match against
the Stanford women's soccer team. Stanford dropped the
game 3-1.
Stanford took to the road knowing that the Gators were
an erratic team. San Francisco State had nearly beaten the
best team on the West Coast and subsequendy had lost
miserably to average squads.
A very important, if overlooked, factor in the game turned
out to be the Gators' home-field advantage. A combination of
the San Francisco State fans and the attitude of the team it
self played upon the Cardinal's frustrations, forcing Stan
ford's first loss in four games.
The game started out in a pattern typical of the Cardinal's
last four games. A moderate number of shots were taken at
both goals, but both teams' defenses and goalkeepers were
perfect.
But with five minutes left to go in the half, Stanford got a
break. A Gator player illegally kicked a Stanford player in
the goalie s box and the Cardinal was given a penalty kick.
Senior midfielder Amy Geisse was called upon to take the
free shot. She fulfilled her duty by slamming the ball to the
left of the Gator goalie for her third goal of the season.
Geisse now is tied with Tonya Antonucci as Stanford's
leading scorer this season.
Stanford let .-0 at halftime, and held its lead until only 20
minutes were left in the game. "We dominated most of the
game," Geisse said,"but during the last 20 minutes they (the
Gators) took advantage of being at home."
First, San Francisco State tied up the game with a good,
routine goal. In quick succession though, they scored on a
penalty kick and then another clean poal.

At this point, the Cardinal was in a definite rut. The Gators
had become more intense, and perhaps more nasty "It
became very physical," Stanford Coach Helen Keohane said.
They re a hard-fighting team. We just weren't able to get
a second goal and put them away," she said.
Amy Geisse agreed that tolerating the Gators both men
tally and physically was no simple task. "They have very ob
noxious fans, she said. "Thev (the opposing players) were
very vocal and took a lot of hacks."
It was possible for the Stanford women to stand a certain
amount of verbal abuse and rough play even though most of
them were not used to such conduct. But in the end, their
nerves and tempers wore thin.
Geisse also admitted her team's faults. "We were getting
our confidence built to where we were a tad overconfi
dent, she said. We 11 come back fighting hard," she added
when asked about the rest of the season.
The game statistics showed a fairly good game for the
Cardinal despite the disappointing score and hard feelings.
The Cardinal took 20 shots at the opposite goal, as
compared to the Gators' 11 attempts. •
Both the offense and defense performed well under the
game s inordinately high tension. The Cardinal controlled
the ball well on the field. "The midfielders had a hard talk,
but they all played really well," said Keohane.
With that in mind, Stanford should have no trouble pre
paring for their Saturday home game against California.
Keohane and Geisse agree that low spirits will not be a
problem.
"If anything, we could get too psyched for the game," said
Keohane. The obvious key to a victory Saturday is for this
talented young team to keep their wits about them and play
steadily throughout the full game.
