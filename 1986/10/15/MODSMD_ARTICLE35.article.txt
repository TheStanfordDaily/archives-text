# Practice underway today for basketball; Montgomery takes over young squad
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
When men's baske f ball practice
begins today, a familiar face will be
missing at Stanford. Coach Tom Davis
has taken his full-court pressure and
wholesale substitutions to lowa, and
Mike Montgomery is on the Farm
ready to begin his first season at the
helm of the Cardinal.
"Our job is to assess our talent and
make any adjustments necessary,"
Montgomery said yesterday,"and con
tinue the building process Tom Davis
began."
Montgomery is faced with a team
lacking in experience. With four
players lost to graduation, three of
whom started last season, and guard
John Paye in all likelihood playing foot
ball through the East-West Shrine
Game and skipping basketball season,
Montgomery has only one senior and

two juniors on this year's team.
Senior guard Novian Whitsitt, junior
forward Greg Buder and junior center
Eric Reveno are the only players with
two letters to their credit. "How much
of an effect that has on us remains to
be seen," Montgomery said.
Montgomery's top two returnees
from last year's 14-16 team are sopho
mores. Todd Lichti earned first-team
All-Pacific 10 Conference honors last
year as a guard, the first freshman to
receive that honor in eight years. The
other is center Howard Wright, who
started 27 of 30 games last season and
led the Cardinal in rebounding at 6.3
per game.
Lichti will start the season at for
ward, Montgomery said. At 6-foot-4,
Lichti is hoping for an NBA career as a
guard, but played both positions last
season. "Obviously, in the future, I'd
like to play at the guard spot," Lichti
said. But right now, I think the team

needs me at forward. I don't think it
will restrict me; I don't think it will
change the way I play."
The Cardinal doesn't have anyone
else with experience at small forward,
but is also shorthanded at both guard
positions. Last year's top two point
guards were the graduated Keith
Ramee and Paye, leaving sophomore
Terry Taylor as the only natural point
man. Whitsitt and redshirt sophomore
Scott Meinert are the only other re
turning guards.
Montgomery said he will not desig
nate two different guard positions, but
will try to get his best five players on
the floor together. "We're somewhat
depthwise thin at guard," he said. "I
like our quality, we're just going to
have to remain healthy."
"The idea is to have the five best
players out there," Whitsitt said. "It
doesn't matter if you have two point
guards or two shooting guards. We'll

all have to bring the ball upcourt.
When you go out there, you discover
parts of your game you didn't have
before."
Montgomery pointed to differences
in his coaching style that should be ap
parent from the outset. The full-court
pressure and hurry-up offense of the
Davis yeais are gone, as is the mass
substitution system that allowed each
starter to substitute for himself.
"The perception will be that we're
more controlled," Montgomery said,
but that won't be the reality. In reality,
we'll shoot the ball as quickly or
quicker than under Tom. We won't
take the ball out of the net and run it
down there, but we'll be less restricted
after that."
"I think jhis will us more of a
chance to get into the flow," Wright
said. "It was hard for the second string
to come into the game and have to
make something happen."
