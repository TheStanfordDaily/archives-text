# Hockey season starts
## 
### 
It's the seventh game of the
American League Series. Boston's
ace Roger Clemens bears down on
California's Reggie Jackson. Two
men on, two men out; the Red Sox
cling to a slim 3-2 lead. The crowd
roars.

The crowd roars as Edmonton's
Wayne Gretzky runs out on to the
field brandishing an NHL (it's a little
like "NFL" but without the "F")
schedule.
"Boston plays Edmonton this Sat
urday," he yells deperately. Police
and guard dogs quickly take care of

the lunacy by ushering the Great
One off the field. Wayne and his
sport hockey slink off â€” unwanted
and unloved.
But underneath the oceans of
football, baseball and basketball
fans lies a stagnant little cesspool of
hockey well-wishers. We care, and
we realize that the NHL season has
begun.
It's true. Hockey season is here
and California is simply abuzz.
Hordes upon hordes scour the
sports sections to validity whether
the Calgary Flames upset the
Quebec Nordiques. Zamboni sales
at your local Zamboni retailer are
booming. Yes, hockey is here.
But let's face it. The aforemen
tioned scenario was only a cruel
hoax. For Californians, the term
hockey sounds like a brain condi
tion. A Nordique? Could be some
thing derogatory. "Leave me alone,
you ... you big Nordique."
