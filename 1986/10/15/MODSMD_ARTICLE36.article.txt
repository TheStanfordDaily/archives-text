# Hockey season starts
## 
### 
It's the seventh game of the
American League Series. Boston's
ace Roger Clemens bears down on
California's Reggie Jackson. Two
men on, two men out; the Red Sox
cling to a slim 3-2 lead. The crowd
roars.

The crowd roars as Edmonton's
Wayne Gretzky runs out on to the
field brandishing an NHL (it's a little
like "NFL" but without the "F")
schedule.
"Boston plays Edmonton this Sat
urday," he yells deperately. Police
and guard dogs quickly take care of

the lunacy by ushering the Great
One off the field. Wayne and his
sport hockey slink off — unwanted
and unloved.
But underneath the oceans of
football, baseball and basketball
fans lies a stagnant little cesspool of
hockey well-wishers. We care, and
we realize that the NHL season has
begun.
It's true. Hockey season is here
and California is simply abuzz.
Hordes upon hordes scour the
sports sections to validity whether
the Calgary Flames upset the
Quebec Nordiques. Zamboni sales
at your local Zamboni retailer are
booming. Yes, hockey is here.
But let's face it. The aforemen
tioned scenario was only a cruel
hoax. For Californians, the term
hockey sounds like a brain condi
tion. A Nordique? Could be some
thing derogatory. "Leave me alone,
you ... you big Nordique."

And what about a zamboni anyway?
Is it something that .you order at Com
padres? Well, no. To end the excruciat
ing suspense, a zamboni is the ma
chine that re-surfaces the ice between
periods in a hockey game.
If you're a Califomian or West Coast
person in general and are still
confused, a zamboni is the big truck
like vehicle that clears the frozen water
during the intermission of the Ice
Capades.

Now, at least, we have a common
hockey bond. With this in mind, let us
strive boldly onward into the realm of
prognostication.
The Philadelphia Flyers should be
the class once again in the Patrick Divi
sion. The Pittsburgh Penguins, led by
center Mario Lemieux, will challenge.
In the Adams Division, Quebec will
dethrone the proud Montreal
Canadiens. The Nordiques have an of
fense that rivals Edmonton while main
taining a better than average defense.
Finally, we move from the Wales
Conference to the Campbell Confer
ence, where the Minnesota North Stars
will dominate the Norris Division. A

perennial letdown a la the NFL's New
York Jets, the Stars have coalesced as a
complete team. The rest of the division
will finish below .500.
The Symthe Division has become
synomonous with the Edmonton
Oilers and the same will apply this year
— barely. Calgary will chase the Oilers
down to the wire.
So we might as well ask the question
that millions of sports enthusiasts
having been pondering. Who will win
the Stanley Cup? Look no further past
the Mississippi. The Stanley Cup cham
pions will be the Minnesota North
Stars.
I'd like a zamboni, make it stiff.
