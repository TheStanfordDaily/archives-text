# Curtin, Schubert return from injuries
## Top cross country runners healthy for fall 
### ALICIA KENT 
When junior Christa Curtin and senior Cory Schubert
came to Stanford University, their lives were focused on be
coming the nation's best women cross country runners. But
both women have faced numerous injuries and setbacks
that have not only harmed their competing seasons, but
have forced the two to refocus their priorities.
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson, who has coached the
women since their freshman years, sees how important run
ning is to Curtin and Schubert. "Running is a very big slice
of their lives, perhaps too big," Johnson said.
Yet he feels that Curtin and Schubert have had very differ
ent experiences in dealing with their disappointing seasons
at Stanford.
Curtin, who is from Bellmore, N.Y., has competed only
twice since her freshman year. After an amazing high school
career, her experience at Stanford has been a letdown. "It
was frustrating, depressing. I didn't know if I wanted to run
anymore," Curtin said.
Curtin came to Stanford as one of the nation's top dis
tance runners, being the 1982 Junior National Champion in
the 3,000 meters. In her freshman year at Stanford, she
placed 52nd in the NCAA Championships, 13th at the
District-8 Meet, fifth at the WCAA Conference Champion
ships and eighth at the Stanford Invitational.
However, she faced several knee injuries, stress fractures
in her femur and feet and illnesses that destroyed her
sophomore year of competition. After a summer of light
training, Curtin feels that she has a new perspective on run
ning. "In the past I've pushed myself too hard. Now I'm less
frantic about getting back," she said.
After summer classes ended for Curtin, she returned
home and had a chance to think about this season. "I
thought a lot this summer; I had a chance to put my head to
gether," she said. Curtin visited with former coaches and
friends and talked a lot with her parents. "The bottom line is

that I love to run. I have the potential to do it," concluded
Curtin.
Because of her new attitude about her running career,
Curtin is less expectant about this season. "It's not do or die
anymore. I want to run as best as I can, but if I don't, I
shouldn't let it get to me," she said.
Curtin's first workout with the team was last Friday. "It
takes a while to get used to it again. But if I can stay healthy
and be consistent, I can make it," Curtin said.

As for long-term goals, Curtin said that she has the poten
tial and the talent to make the Olympic Trials. "I haven't yet
reached my potential. If I can stay healthy, there's hope; I'm
young," the sophomore said.
Schubert, one year older than Curtin, also has had
numerous injuries. She had stress fractures in each femur
and two foot surgeries to cure a neuroma, never running for
more than three months without being hurt.
Schubert, who is from San Jose, came to Stanford as the
nation's number one prep distance runner, having placed
first at the 1983 Junior Nationals in the 3,000 meters and
qualifying for the U.S. Olympic Trials.
Injuries kept her from participating in the trials, but she
was able to compete as a freshman at Stanford in 1983,

placing 31st at the NCAA Championships and seventh at the
District-8 Meet.
This season, after red-shirting in 1985 due to injury,
Schubert plans to take things more slowly and build up her
strength. "Running hurts a lot. My body has to learn to adapt
to the stresses," she said.
She isn't sure why she had such "unlucky" seasons, but
guesses she may have been pushing herself too hard.
However frustrating it was, Schubert continued to train after
each injury. "I never once thought about giving up, not until
I believe in my heart that I gave running the best I could,"
Schubert said.
Now Schubert is trying to put things in perspective. She
says she has realized that if she can be successful in one
thing, she can be successful in another. "Besides, Brooks
says running is just a bunch of people with a little bit of
clothes on, running in circles," Schubert said.
As for this season, she isn't ready to set any immediate
goals. "Right now I'm working on being a part of the team,"
said Schubert, who is the women's cross country team cap
tain."! enjoy being captain; I can see myself in the team."
Schubert plans to compete as a fifth-year senior next year
but tries not to speculate about what she will do after col
lege. "I have long-term goals about the Olympics trials, but I
try to keep them in the back of my mind"
Schubert s mother, who has been supportive of her
daughter throughout her running career, does look ahead.
"If she makes her mind up, she'll be the top," said Maggie
Schubert.
She attributes her daughter's ability to continue running
after having so many injuries to "determination, competive
ness. Cory is a tough cookie, she never gets down."
Both Curtin and Schubert have worked together to deal
with their injuries and inability to compete. "In the past, we
were always competitors. Now we talk about our injuries.
Its been hard for both of us (being injured), but now it's all
behind us," said Schubert.

Both Curtin and Schubert have worked together to deal

were always competitors. Now we talk about our injuries.
Its been hard for both of us (being injured), but now it's all
behind us," said Schubert.

Stanford junior Cory Schubert has battled numerous in
juries during her cross country career.
When junior Christa Curtin and senior Cory Schubert
came to Stanford University, their lives were focused on be
coming the nation's best women cross country runners. But
both women have faced numerous injuries and setbacks
that have not only harmed their competing seasons, but
have forced the two to refocus their priorities.
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson, who has coached the
women since their freshman years, sees how important run
ning is to Curtin and Schubert. "Running is a very big slice
of their lives, perhaps too big," Johnson said.
Yet he feels that Curtin and Schubert have had very differ
ent experiences in dealing with their disappointing seasons
at Stanford.
Curtin, who is from Bellmore, N.Y., has competed only
twice since her freshman year. After an amazing high school
career, her experience at Stanford has been a letdown. "It
was frustrating, depressing. I didn't know if I wanted to run
anymore," Curtin said.
Curtin came to Stanford as one of the nation's top dis
tance runners, being the 1982 Junior National Champion in
the 3,000 meters. In her freshman year at Stanford, she
placed 52nd in the NCAA Championships, 13th at the
District-8 Meet, fifth at the WCAA Conference Champion
ships and eighth at the Stanford Invitational.
However, she faced several knee injuries, stress fractures
in her femur and feet and illnesses that destroyed her
sophomore year of competition. After a summer of light
training, Curtin feels that she has a new perspective on run
ning. "In the past I've pushed myself too hard. Now I'm less
frantic about getting back," she said.
After summer classes ended for Curtin, she returned
home and had a chance to think about this season. "I
thought a lot this summer; I had a chance to put my head to
gether," she said. Curtin visited with former coaches and
friends and talked a lot with her parents. "The bottom line is

that I love to run. I have the potential to do it," concluded
Curtin.
Because of her new attitude about her running career,
Curtin is less expectant about this season. "It's not do or die
anymore. I want to run as best as I can, but if I don't, I
shouldn't let it get to me," she said.
Curtin's first workout with the team was last Friday. "It
takes a while to get used to it again. But if I can stay healthy
and be consistent, I can make it," Curtin said.

As for long-term goals, Curtin said that she has the poten
tial and the talent to make the Olympic Trials. "I haven't yet
reached my potential. If I can stay healthy, there's hope; I'm
young," the sophomore said.
Schubert, one year older than Curtin, also has had
numerous injuries. She had stress fractures in each femur
and two foot surgeries to cure a neuroma, never running for
more than three months without being hurt.
Schubert, who is from San Jose, came to Stanford as the
nation's number one prep distance runner, having placed
first at the 1983 Junior Nationals in the 3,000 meters and
qualifying for the U.S. Olympic Trials.
Injuries kept her from participating in the trials, but she
was able to compete as a freshman at Stanford in 1983,

placing 31st at the NCAA Championships and seventh at the
District-8 Meet.
This season, after red-shirting in 1985 due to injury,
Schubert plans to take things more slowly and build up her
strength. "Running hurts a lot. My body has to learn to adapt
to the stresses," she said.
She isn't sure why she had such "unlucky" seasons, but
guesses she may have been pushing herself too hard.
However frustrating it was, Schubert continued to train after
each injury. "I never once thought about giving up, not until
I believe in my heart that I gave running the best I could,"
Schubert said.
Now Schubert is trying to put things in perspective. She
says she has realized that if she can be successful in one
thing, she can be successful in another. "Besides, Brooks
says running is just a bunch of people with a little bit of
clothes on, running in circles," Schubert said.
As for this season, she isn't ready to set any immediate
goals. "Right now I'm working on being a part of the team,"
said Schubert, who is the women's cross country team cap
tain."! enjoy being captain; I can see myself in the team."
