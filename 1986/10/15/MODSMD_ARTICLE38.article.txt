NEW YORK (AP) — Gary Carter
broke out of a l-for-21 slump with a
run-scoring single in the 12th inning
that gave the New York Mets a 2-1 vic
tory over the Houston Astros yesterday
and moved them within a game of
their third National League pennant.
The game-winning hit gave the Mets
a 3-2 lead in games in the best-of-seven
playoff against Houston and sent the
series back to the Astrodome for

games 6 and 7.
BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Red
Sox, behind Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd's
gutty pitching and Spike Owen's four
hits, charged past the California Angels
10-4 last night, tying the American
League playoffs and setting up a
decisive seventh game.
By winning Game 6, the Red Sox

overcame a 3-1 deficit in the best-of
seven series and put themselves in the
position they wanted. Roger Clemens,
Boston's ace right-hander and the most
dominant pitcher in baseball this
season, will start Game 7 Wednesday
night, opposed by left-hander John
Candelaria.
The deciding game will mark yet an
other chance for the Angels to win the
first pennant in their 26-year history.
