# Soccer home versus St. Mary's; first conference game for Card
##

"The second season is suiting. If we win the league, we
could go to the playoffs. We're not favored by any stretch of
the imagination, but the way we've been playing it's a possi
bility," freshman forward Chris Porch said yesterday.
Porch was discussing the NCAA tournament playoffs. The
Stanford men's soccer team has never played in the NCAA
tournament. It's that kind of confidence that may get them
there, and confidence is something the Cardinal will take
into today's Pacific Soccer Conference opener here against
St. Mary's at 3 p.m.
The squad is coming off two tough losses to UCLA and
Washington in the Pacific 10 Conference tournament and
consecutive victories over Westmont and UC-Davis.
Stanford will face a much improved St. Mary's team. In
last year's meeting, the Cardinal won 3-0, but St. Mary's is 6-
6-1 this season with a conference record of 1-0-1. The con
ference victory came 2-1 against San Jose State and the tie 3-
3 against Santa Clara.
St. Mary's top player is Dave Bristol, who has three goals
and three assists on the season. Goalie Randall Smith has re
corded a 1.65 goals-against-average this season.
Porch, who scored the first goal in the victory at Davis, is

finally beginning to grow accustomed to his new surround
ings.
"It was really tough to begin with. 1 was really nervous at
first. I wanted to make a good first impression on the team.
Mike Mossmer and Jim Cole really helped me get adjusted,"
Porch said.
And he has made a good impression. With 5 points on the
season, he shares the team lead with Ross Torres, Juan Gar
cia and Cole. He also shares the team lead in goals with Gar
cia and Torres at two.
"No one's afraid to give the ball to anyone else. We're
confident in each other. Everyone on the team has to be up
(for us to play well)," Porch said.
Indeed, balance is one of Stanford's strong suits. No less
than 10 players have contributed points this season, and all
but two of the 10 have scored a goal.
"Jerry Maldonado (starting midfielder) and Ross Torres
(an alternate at starting forward) have come up through our
junior varsity program and are playing well. They keep im
proving with every game," Stanford Coach Sam Koch said.
"St. Mary's has a strong midfield and a good forward line.
We will have to mark well," he added
The Cardinal will likely be without the services of Luke
Garrot, Pat Sheehy, and Tim Westergren due to injury.
