## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The Hoard of Trustees yesterday approved design plans
for a "80-student housing complex that may be opened to
graduate students by 1988.
At their second meeting of the school year, the trustees
also approved a design for the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library and learned that the Athletic Department lost nearly
I 00,000 during the past school vear.
In addition, the board established the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Professorship. There are no immediate plans to fill the
chair, for which $1 million in donations have been received
The graduate student housing complex will consist of 35
low, Spanish-style buildings. Construction on the $30 mil
lion project is scheduled to begin this spring, and most units
are expected to be ready for occupancy by fall 1988.
Stanford provides on-campus housing for about per
cent of its undergraduates, but only 40 percent of its
graduate students live on campus, according to University-
News Setvice. This project will increase that figure to 50
percent, according to Carol Mullet', project coordinator for
the Student Affairs Office
the complex will be located along Bowdoin Street be
tween Campus Drive East and die Stanford Campus Recrea
tion Association (SCRA) facility.
The trustees also approved the design of a California
mission-style quadrangle for the Reagan Library. The library
will be located south of Lake Lagunita and above Junipero
Serra Boulevard
But the trustees reserved ' the right to require, after fur
ther discussion between the University and the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation, a reduced size of the pro
posed auditorium and alternative use 1 - for the space in
volved"
A proposed 350-seat auditorium has been criticized by
Electrical Engineering Prof. Anthony Siegman. who said it

was not necessary in an archival library.

the library a convention center

According to University News Service, the library's ai

chitectural features will include red tile roofs, a stone finish,
thick walls and cloistered walkways The buildings will
enclose a courtyard comparable in size to the Old Union
courtyard.
The building will be one-story high on three sides, with a
second story on the side of the building that faces campus

The committee said the Athletic De
partment's expenditures exceeded its
income by $699,000 last year. The
shortfall was attributed mainly to three
factors: a shortfall of about $200,000 in
gift income to the Varsity Fund; an un
derbudgeting of nearly $200,000 in
operations and maintenance; and a
decrease of nearly $200,000 in ex

A department reserve fund will off

The committee told the board that
the Athletic Department will prepare a
long-range plan by February to show
how programs and finances will be
brought into balance by the 1987-88
