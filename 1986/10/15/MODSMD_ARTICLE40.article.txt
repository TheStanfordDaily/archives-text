# University announces Centennial campaign goals

### TODD PIERCE 
The University has announced goals
for a fund-raising campaign that, by es
tablishing new foundations for Stan
ford's second century, will have far
reaching effects on undergraduate
education here.
The drive, probably the most ener
getic and all-encompassing ever at
tempted by a university, is pan of Stan
ford's 1991 Centennial celebration.

"The three major objectives are im
proving undergraduate education,
strengthening the faculty with addi
tional endowment and rebuilding the
science and engineering facilities,"
said David Fulton, director of commu
nications and deputy to the vice presi
dent for development.
The fund drive, planned by the Of
fice of Development, will complement
the centennial celebration currently
being prepared by a joint fac
ulty/administration committee. A
prospectus drafted by the Office of De
velopment with help from the
Provost's office and a Board of Trustees
sub-committee will be the basis for the

five-year project
The campaign aims to increase fund
ing for undergraduate programs, raise
money for the Near West science com
plex and channel new resources to de
partments in the humanities and social
sciences. Projects for the graduate
schools include new allotments to the
humanities and social sciences, which
traditionally cannot rely as heavily as
the hard sciences can on the private
and public sectors for support.
The prospectus outlines the details
of undergraduate academic, financial
and athletic improvements slated for

funding initiatives. Attempting to see
that some parts of the University do
not lag behind others," the committee
seeks a balance between the construc
tion of science buildings and the
strengthening of Stanford's
"community of scholars."
The new science center will house
highly sophisticated research laborato
ries and will provide more classroom
space. According to the prospectus, the
need for complex laboratories is acute.
What served in earlier generations is
inadequate to today's needs, let alone
those of the decades ahead," the

prospectus states.
For the "community of scholars,''
the campaign will try to raise money
for 100 new named endowed profes
sorships. The new chairs will cost $1.5
million each and will follow one of
three plans. Some of the chairs will be
traditional — named endowed profes
sorships — and will be permanently
identified with a school or department,
while others will be Centennial Profes
sorships, also bearing a donor name.
These chairs will used to recognize
and reward distinguished teaching.
The last type of endowed chair will be

used to develop fields, such as the fine
arts and the history of science, in
which Stanford aspires to deeper
coverage, according to the prospectus.
The success of such majors as VTSS
(values, technology, science and soci
ety), international relations and human
biology prompted the goal of 12
Centennial Professorships in the inter
disciplinary departments, the
prospectus states.
The campaign will also provide new
funding for independent study, honors
work and interdisciplinary programs,
which the Drospectus calls "integral to

our intellectual vigor and to the high
quality and standing of undergraduate
offerings." The prospectus also men
tions new public service programs and
the maintenence of the need-blind ad
missions policy as fund-raising objec
tives.
Another goal of the Centennial drive
is to build and renovate the residential
and athletic facilities.
Collecting money for these plans
will be a tremendous task. "Something
like 6,000 or 7,000 volunteers," will be
needed, according to Fulton.
