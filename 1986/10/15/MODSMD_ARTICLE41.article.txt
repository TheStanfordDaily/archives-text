# Campaign to increase student housing
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
By 1991, the 100 th anniversary of the the
opening of Stanford, the University hopes to build
enough new residence halls to guarentee all un
dergraduates four years of housing.
Currently, undergraduates are only guarenteed
on-campus housing for three of their years at the
University.
This last increase in student housing will be one
of the fund-raising goals in the Centennial cam
paign, said Richard Bennett, director of campaign
planning in the Office of Development.
University officials plan to fund the $18 million
project entirely through Centennial contributions
instead of room rents and loans like previous

housing developments, Bennett said. The Univer
sity hopes to raise more than $500 million in the
Centennial campaign, he added.
Bennett added that Stanford administrators hope
the Centennial campaign will lure contributions
from alumni who often prefer to give to other parts
of the University.
Traditionally, it's been much more difficult to
raise money for dormitories and for student
housing," he said
According to Rodger Whitney, director of
housing and assistant dean of students: "Student
housing at one time was much more glamorous
compared to today. It doesn't have the same kind
of appeal now (for donors)."
Since the Governor s Corner housing was con

structed, a higher percentage of undergraduates
have wanted to live on campus, Whitney said.
Local sky-rocketing rents have been another fac
tor in the increased demand for student housing,
Bennett said. 'As off-campus rates go up, the
desirability of living on campus increases.''
Currently, 87 percent of undergraduates are
housed on-campus, he said.
Construction of the new housing will not begin
until sometime in 1988-89, after a new graduate
student complex is completed, Whitney said.
While plans for the new residences have not
been completed, Whitney said the new develop
ment will probably be some combination of indi
vidual houses and Sterling- or Lagunita-style com
plexes.
