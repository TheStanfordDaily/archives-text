Congress agrees on arms budget
WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators agreed yesterday to a
fiscal 198 T defense budget of about $290 billion that reflects earlier arms
control agreements with the White House and removes a major hurdle
standing in the way of passage of a long-delayed omnibus spending bill for
the government.
The defense compromise, which provides the smallest military spending
increase since President Reagan took office, would cut his defense request
for this year by roughly $30 billion. But it comes close to Senate-proposed
levels that the administration had indicated earlier it could accept, and
Republicans indicated it was the best they could muster. .•„. ( 1 '
However, several obstacles remained as Congress tried to wrap up the
half-trillion-dollar catchall spending bill for fiscal year 1987 and adjourn by
the weekend for a final spate of campaigning before the Nov. 4 elections.
Adjournment could be delayed until next week if necessary for considera
tion of a threatened veto of Superfund legislation by Reagan.
Details of the arms accord remained under discussion, including non
binding language urging Reagan to continue adhering to weapons limits in
the unratified SALT II treaty. Final agreement on non-defense provisions of
the omnibus spending bill also remained to be reached.
S. Africa charged with torture
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A leading South African human rights
group yesterday accused the police and army of imprisoning, torturing and
killing black children in their attempts to quell continuing civil unrest in
the country.
The Black Sash, whose members are mostly liberal white women firmly
opposed to apartheid, said it had found in a national survey that hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of black children, have become victims of
"indiscriminate brutality" by the security forces and that this contributed
substantially to further violence.
"In most countries, children are protected and nurtured," the 33-page
Black Sash report concluded. "Here, they are attacked."
Statements reproduced in the report, some from children as young as
12, recounted torture by policemen and soldiers, detentions without
charge and often in solitary confinement for weeks, and apparently un
provoked shootings by the security forces.
A 15-year-old boy, arrested while visiting his grandmother after the
home of a policeman neighbor was stoned, reported that he was whipped
by police until his skin cracked open and then put into solitary confine
ment without medical treatment.
A 17-year-old youth said that police repeatedly thrust his head into a
bucket of water mixed with tear gas, subjected him to electrical shocks and
then beat him before placing him in solitary confinement
Nearly 40 cases claimed to be typical are reported in detail, and those
represent less than a 10th of the documented files that the Black Sash says it
has collected during the past year.
Court to hear abortion case
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court re-entered the abortion fight yes
terday, agreeing to decide whether a state can require girls under age 18
who are seeking an abortion to wait 24 hours after their parents have been
notified.
Attorneys on both sides said that this latest case posed a narrow ques
tion, but one that might signal whether the court, under the new leader
ship of William Rehnquist, will put some limits on a woman's right to abor
tion.
Since the court first decreed in 1973 that women have such a right, the
justices have regularly struck down state laws placing restrictions on abor
tions — but by increasingly narrow margins.
The court issued its original abortion ruling on a 7-2 vote. In 1983, the
court by a 6-3 margin struck down an Akron, Ohio, city ordinance that,
among other things, required women and girls seeking an abortion to wait
24 hours. In June, by a 5-4 margin, the court nullified a Pennsylvania law re
quiring that women be given information on the risks of an abortion.
By most analyses, the voting line-up on abortion has not changed since
then. The vacancy left by retired Chief Justice Warren Burger, who was
among the four voting in favor of the Pennsylvania law, has been filled by
another presumed opponent of an unlimited right to abortion, Associate
Justice Antonin Scalia. And Rehnquist has voted against the right to an abor
tion in every case.
Israeli leadership switch delayed
JERUSALEM — A scheduled exchange of posts between Prime Minister
Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir was delayed for at least
24 hours yesterday because of differences over appointments.
"There is no change," Shamir, leader of the rightist Likud Bloc in the
governing coalition of national unity, told reporters as he emerged from a
35-minute meeting with Peres, head of the centrist Labor Alignment.
Peres resigned last Friday to clear the way for the rotation of posts that
the two parties agreed on when they formed the coalition 25 months ago.
Shamir was to have been confirmed yesterday by the Knesset, or parlia
ment, to serve as prime minister for the next 25 months.
Labor and Likud representatives accused each other of bad faith in
negotiating the final details of the change over, leaving Peres in charge in a
caretaker capacity until a compromise is found
The government press office announced yesterday morning that the
Knesset session at which the change had been expected to be rubber
stamped was postponed until today. Lsrael television reported last night
that there would be a further delay.
Poindexter defends Libya policy
WASHINGTON — White* House national security adviser John Poindex
ter, author of a controversy.' memo outlining a disinformation campaign
against Libyan leader Moammar Khadafi, said yesterday that the govern
ment has an inherent right to use deception to protect the national secur
ity.
"The whole question comes down to: 'Is deception going to be a tool
that the government can use in combatting a very significant national secur
ity problem,' and I think that the aaswer ... has to be yes," Poindexter told
a group of reporters.
He insisted that the campaign launched as a result of his August memo
was not intended to deceive the public or the press either in the United
States or the rest of the world But he conceded that some people who
were not targets of the campaign might have been deceived inadvertently.
"We had no intent and did not plan or conspire to mislead the American
press in any way," Poindexter said. "The objective of the program with
Khadafi was to deceive Khadafi."
Wiesel wins Peace Prize
OSLO, Norway — Elie Wiesel, who survived the Nazi Holocaust to
become the voice of its victims and a champion of dignity for all people,
was chosen yesterday to receive the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised the naturalized American au
thor as a spiritual leader in an age of violence and hatred.
"Wiesel's commitment, which originated in the sufferings of the Jewish
people, has been widened to embrace all repressed peoples and races," its
citation said.
Wiesel, 58, lost his parents and younger sister in Nazi death camps
during World War 11. He has chronicled the suffering of the Jews under Hit
ler and their problems in the Soviet Union today.
I have devoted my life to a certain cause, the cause of memory, the
cause of remembrance, and now I feel that maybe I will have a better op
portunity to say the same words — I'm not going to change now — for
more people," Wiesel said in New York, where he lives.
