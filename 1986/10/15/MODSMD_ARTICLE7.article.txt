# Reagan calls summit historic
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, leading an ad
ministration effort to put the best face on the break
down of the weekend summit in Reykjavik, asserted
yesterday that "historic gains" achieved in Iceland
would form a sound basis for arms control negotia
tions in Geneva.
At the same time, however, Reagan reiterated his
determination to stand firm on developing and test
ing his "Star Wars" program of space-based missile
defense — the issue over which the Reykjavik sum
mit broke up.
"They (the Soviets) may think they can come back
and talk me out of it, but they can't," he said.
And the Soviets appear just as determined to con
tinue insisting that the United States restrict all work
on "Star Wars" to laboratory research. Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, in a televised address to his na
tion yesterday, said that he could not let the United
States proceed with its Strategic Defense Initiative, as
"Star Wars" is formally known.
"After Reykjavik, it is clearer than ever for every
one that SDI is the symbol of obstruction to the cause
of peace, the epitome of military schemes, of the un
willingness to remove the nuclear menace looming
over mankind," Gorbachev said. "There can be no
other interpretation."
During an hour-long session at the White House
yesterday with a group of Washington journalists,

Reagan, Secretary of State George Shultz and White
House chief of staff Donald Regan spoke glowingly of
"progress" at Reykjavik.
The session was part of a media blitz launched by
the White House to portray the summit as a success
despite its collapse at the end and early expressions
of "deep disappointment" by administrauon officials.
Shultz, who gave reporters a grim assessment of
the outcome at Reykjavik immediately after the sum
mit ended Sunday, said that he was tired then and did
not fully recognize that the meeting represented a
"watershed" in arms negotiations.
"We labored hard and long over a very exhausting
day and we didn't quite get all of the things that we
wanted, and so you're always a little down as a result
of that," he explained.
Despite the impasse over "Star Wars," U.S. officials
contended yesterday that the preliminary agree
ments on arms reductions, including the eventual
elimination of most or all offensive nuclear weapons,
will be on the agenda for future arms negotiations.
Reagan, accentuating the positive, said that the
notes of the talks between himself and Gorbachev at
Reykjavik had already been taken by U.S. negotiators
to Geneva, where arms talks with the Soviets are con
tinuing. He added that he was convinced the Soviets
"will return to the table and talk" as they review

those records and "see that there was only one major
point of disagreement."
The president said, "I'm going to continue to be
optimistic." He was told a few years ago, he said, that
radical arms reduction was "an impossible dream,"
but now "it's on the agenda for both sides."
"We were just a sentence or two away from agree
ing to new talks on nuclear testing. And maybe most
important, we were in sight of an historic agreement
on completely eliminating the threat of offensive bal
listic missiles by 1996."
But when arms talks resume in Geneva, the super
powers will have to resolve their leaders' seemingly
intractable differences over "Star Wars" before an
arms reduction agreement would be possible.
Reagan, asked if he considered taking Gorbachev's
"Star Wars" proposal under consideration instead of
rejecting it outright, said: "There wasn't any need of
that. There wasn't any way that we were going to back
away from SDI."
Also, in the aftermath of Reykjavik, there appears to
be little chance of another summit soon, even though
Reagan said his invitation for Gorbachev to come to
Washington this year still stood. Regan and Shultz
said that they did not expect another meeting be
tween the two leaders any time soon.
