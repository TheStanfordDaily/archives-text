# Committee passes immigration bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — House and Senate
conferees agreed yesterday on a major
revision of the nation's immigration
laws, providing amnesty for illegal
aliens who came to the United States
before 1982 and instituting civil and
criminal penalties for employers who
hire illegal aliens in the future.
The measure was sent back to the
House and Senate for final considera
tion this week. While the compromise
is expected to be accepted by the
House, possibly today, Senate Majority
Whip Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) warned
that "one or two" senators could stall
it. Simpson, who has worked since
1981 on revising the immigration
statutes, saw similar legislation die in
the final days of the last two con
gresses.
Rep. Leon Panetta (D-Calif.) said that
any backlash against the amnesty pro
gram could kill future attempts at revi
sion.
Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice Commissioner Alan Nelson said
he believed the Reagan administration,
which has pushed for action, will sup

port the bill. "We obviously have to
take a look at this. But overall, we think
the conferees came up with an accep
table package. My advice to the presi
dent and the attorney general will be
to accept it," Nelson said.
The measure includes civil rights
guarantees for Hispanic legal resi
dents, $4 billion over four years to
defray state costs, increased funding
for INS enforcement, and a program to
provide a steady supply of farm
workers to American growers.
The conferees dropped a controver
sial House provision to temporarily
stop deportations of illegal immigrants
from Nicaragua and El Salvador until a
federal study could be made of the
conditions they face at home.
The panel accepted House language
that would provide amnesty to illegal
aliens who have lived continuously in
the United States since Jan. 1, 1982,
rather than the Senate's Jan. 1, 1980,
eligibility date, and dropped a Senate
plan to delay amnesty for three years to
give the INS time to improve enforce
ment along the borders.
