# Soviet diplomats visit NATO allies

### 
LONDON — Soviet envoys, dis
patched at the behest of Mikhail
Gorbachev, fanned out across West
em Europe in a diplomatic offen
sive yesterday, to give Moscow's in
terpretation of what happened
during the failed summit in Reyk
javik.
In London and Paris, senior So
viet diplomats met with govern
ment leaders and held press confer
ences in a program that seemed a
mirror image of American efforts
the day before. Today, the Soviets
will take their presentation to other
NATO leaders in West Germany,
Italy and Belgium.
But so far, the Europeans say,
they are unsure of what exacdy the
Soviet Union wants to tell them.
Specifically, the Europeans say
they want to know whether the pro
posal Gorbachev put on the table in
Reykjavik calling for a complete
elimination of all intermediate
range nuclear forces (INF) in
Europe — and some in Asia — will

still be the Soviet position when
regular arms control negotiations
resume today in Geneva.
West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl suggested that Gorbachev had
changed positions on his personal
pledge not to link an early arms ac
cord on medium-range missiles in
Europe with the deadlock over
President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative.
At each stop so far, the Soviet en
voys have insisted that their goal is
not to look for, or exploit, possible
areas of disagreement between the
Reagan administration and its West
ern European allies. Moscow is
aware, chief Soviet arms negotiator
Viktor Karpov said here last night,
that "there is a notion of solidarity
within NATO.''
Both Karpov and Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh
were described by European offi
cials as "upbeat" and positive.
