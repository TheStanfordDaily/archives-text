It took millions of years
to put a fish where
itk never been before.
A simple fish can be a rarity or even a nonexistent food
source for many people in the world.
Today, Peace Corps volunteers with biology
degrees and fishery experience are being trained to suc
cessfully raise freshwater fish in areas of the world where
there have never been fish before. And for the first
time, people undernourished from a diet of starches
have an adequate source of protein.
It's only one of many Peace Corps projects where
volunteers are sharing their skills with others to make
life better. A unique opportunity to discover the world,
and broaden your own capabilities with some real
experience. At a professional level.
