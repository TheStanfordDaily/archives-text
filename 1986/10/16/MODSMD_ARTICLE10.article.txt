# Negotiators resume arms talks
## First meeting since failed superpower summit looks hopeful 
### 
GENEVA — U.S. and Soviet nuclear arms
negotiators met here yesterday for the first time since
last weekend's superpower summit and indicated
they would seek arms control agreements built upon
partial understandings reached by President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Both sides entered the talks today willing to pick
up where Reagan and Gorbachev left off in their
Reykjavik meetings, U.S. and Soviet officials said. The
two delegations have expressed the desire to con
sider new treaty language that would reflect the
tentative accords achieved on some, but not all,
major issues regarding nuclear weapons.
U.S. chief negotiator Max Kampelman acknowl
edged before yesterday's round opened that the two
sides remain far apart on the crucial issue of research
on space-based defense systems. A dispute over that
subject led to the collapse of the talks between

Reagan and Gorbachev.
Kampelman told reporters that he had received no
new instructions because he did not need them. "I
have talked to the president in Reykjavik. I know ex
actly what he wants, and we will proceed to do that,"
Kampelman said. But, in a response to a question
about the Soviets' position, Kampelman suggested
that it was too soon to tell whether the Soviets would
be offering any new proposals.
"As you know, (Soviet negotiator Victor) Karpov
will not be here until next week, and so I'll have to
wait until I have a chance to talk to him," Kampelman
said.
Karpov did not attend yesterday's talks because he
was in Bonn to explain the current Soviet disarma
ment position to the West German government. He
planned to fly next to Moscow, where he has indi
cated that he will join further discussions on the

Soviets' next bargaining move.
Yesterday's session served primarily to show that
the U.S.-Soviet dialogue was continuing despite the
failure to agree on a package of arms control agree
ments at Reykjavik.
"We're ready to sit down now, take the agreements
that were made, communicate them into practical
language and try to proceed to formalize as much of
this as we can," Kampelman said. He noted that
"nothing was put down on paper" in Reykjavik, so
that task now fell to the Geneva negotiators.
One group of negotiators discussed long-range
missiles and other strategic forces here yesterday,
while another group considered space-based
defense weapons. Both sessions lasted more than
two hours. The two sides are scheduled to discuss
intermediate-range weapons today.
