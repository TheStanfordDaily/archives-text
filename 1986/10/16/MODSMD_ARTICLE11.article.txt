# English initiative debated

Proposition 63, which would make
English the official language of Califor
nia, was both hailed as a unifying mea
sure and attacked as a divisive one in
the first "California Week" event Tues
day.
Former U.S. Senator Dr. S.I.
Hayakawa, co-chairman of the Califor
nia English Campaign and one of the
proposition s authors, and Dr. Geof
frey Nunberg, linguist and former Stan
ford professor, locked horns over the
proposition in a debate at Stanford.
Hayakawa said in his opening
remarks that the proposition, if passed,
will not change anything meaningful.
He said its purpose is to guard against
the possibility of another language be
coming the state language, arguing that
English is the common bond tying to
gether people of varied backgrounds.
Hayakawa said Proposition 63,
which gives citizens the right to sue the
government if they feel the English lan
guage is not being preserved, would
enable immigrants to learn English
quickly. He discounted the opposition

of various ethnic groups to the
proposition, dismissing their objec
tions as part of a typically defensive at
titude.
Hayakawa, who is Canadian-born
and of Japanese descent, said lack of a
common language is the cause of racial
prejudices, citing Canada and Sri Lanka
as examples. Several audience mem
bers later disagreed with this view,
pointing out that in Sri Langka one of
the causes of the present turmoil is the
passage of an official-language law.
Nunberg said the proposition is an
affront both to immigrants and to the
American language and culture. He
asserted that there is no need to com
pel the loyalty of immigrants by forcing
them to learn English. The demand for
English classes is consistently greater
than the facilities available, he said.
Pointing out that Proposition 63
does not seek to put any money into
English education, he said it will only
create divisiveness without solving any
problems.
"Our language needs a special ad
vantage about as much as the Boston
Celtics need elevator shoes," Nunberg

said. He mentioned that there have
been several periods in U.S. history
when the United States has been
flooded with people whose first lan
guage was not English, and they have
all learned English without endanger
ing national unity.
The panelists spoke for 45 minutes,
and then audience members com
mented and asked questions for a half
hour. Most of those who spoke were
against Proposition 63- Several people
said that Monterey Park, where a
similar piece of legislation was passed,
was thrown into turmoil after English
became its official language.
Hayakawa said that example was an
embarrassing one, but he did not ex
pect similar problems in the future.
Nunberg, on the other hand, said the
Monterey Park experience highlights
the proposition's harmful potential.
"You can't write everything into a
constitutional amendment, for God's
sake," Hayakawa snapped in response
to questions about the "vagueness" of
the proposition and the absence of
provisions dealing with health and
safety.
