## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Bennett's bad ideas 
### 
Education Secretary William Bennett brought the
Reagan Revolution to the gates of the ivory tower Friday
when he blasted American higher education for failing to
"improve not just the intellectual, but also the individual
moral sense of its students."
Likening today's typical undergraduate curriculum to a
"Chinese menu" from which students merely "pick at
leisure," Bennett told an audience of Harvard under
graduates that "students would benefit from ... a [set] of
fundamental courses, ordered, purposive, coherent," de
signed to build their "moral education."
The secretary's notion that universities should tailor
the education they offer students to conform to some
conception of "morality" is a dangerous one. Indeed, it
strikes at the very essence of higher education, namely
the free interplay of thought.
Granted, Bennett is probably right that curriculums at
many American universities do, to some extent,
resemble the variety and confusion of a "Chinese menu."
Here at Stanford, for example, his metaphor is certainly
appropriate. Other than requiring one course in each of
eight loosely defined distribution areas, Stanford leaves
it to the individual student to chart his own road to
graduation.
Dealing with the vast array of ideas and options one
encounters as an undergraduate can indeed be a difficult

and bewildering experience. However, it is precisely this
exposure to a free exchange of ideas that makes a higher
education worth having.
A university that attempts to guard a student's "moral
well-being" runs the risk of limiting the scope of his
thought. Higher education should Open a student's eyes
to different ways of thinking, not feed him or her a
prescribed conception of "morality."
If Bennett gets his way, and "improving the individual
moral sense" of students becomes a goal of American
higher education, the question must be posed: Whose
version of "morality" does he propose to use?
Later in his speech, Bennett complains that "leading
universities ... have a tendency in our time to show a
liberal bias." He warns that "left of center" professors
"may tend to tilt students in the direction of their own
beliefs."
Can we construe from this that the Reagan Administra
tion hopes a good dose of "morality" will help stem the
tide of liberal thinking on America's college campuses?
Let's hope not. Neither politics cloaked as "morality"
nor prescribed thinking of any kind should be allowed
to dictate die composition of university curriculums. The
job of higher education is, after all, to educate, not in
doctrinate.
