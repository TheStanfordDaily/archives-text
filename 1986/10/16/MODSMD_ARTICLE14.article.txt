# Suggestions for a better education

I'm probably one of the least qualified people to
criticize the Western Culture program at Stanford. In
the fall quarter of my freshman year, I didn't even
buy the course reader; of the 12 books assigned for
History 1, I finished only one — "The Prince" by
Machiavelli. In the next two quarters, I did a little bet
ter, completing 18 out of 30 reading assignments.
Still, that comes out to about a 45 percent comple
tion rate overall. So, what gives me the right to
criticize the most extensive distribution requirement
at Stanford? Frankly, I don't know, but I think I have
something to say.
In the first place, what is the Western Culture pro
gram? Is it supposed to be an introductory course in
the history of the Western world? Is it an elite West
ern intellectual history? Or is it some kind of
"cafeteria course" that surveys the Western civiliza
tion? Even after two years, I still can't figure out what
the Western Culture program is all about.

Not only does the purpose of the course seem un
clear, but the selection of the readings seems to be
highly biased. To mc, the word "culture" doesn't
merely mean a march of ideas. Ideas can certainly
move people, but in the end, it is the people who
make history. Unfortunately, the Western Culture
program at Stanford seems to concentrate too much
on elites, overlooking the experience of the common
people. Probably, an intellectual history is easier to
teach, learn and test, but it needs an experiential di
mension if it is to present a proper persepctive. On
this point, I'll quote a 19th-century Russian literary
critic named Viassarion Belinsky, who made a break
from Hegel with the following words:
"What is it to me that something universal lives, so
long as the individual suffers, that solitary genius
should live in heaven, while the common herd rolls
in the mud? ... I cannot bear the sight of barefoot
boys playing,... poor men in tatters.... When I give
a penny to a soldier or a beggar, I almost cry. I run
from him as if I had done something terrible. Has a
man the right to forget himself in art or science,
while this goes on?"
In fact, by paying too much attention to the
abstract, the Western Culture program at Stanford
seems to overlook the historical forces of a more
concrete and sinister nature. For example, in
"People's History of America," Howard Zinn
describes how minorities are often pitted against
each other. A black soldier who had helped to put
down the Filipino independence movement led by
Emilio Aguinaldo in 1899 later confessed: "I was
struck by a question a little Filipino boy asked me,

which ran about this way: 'Why does the American
Negro come ... to fight us where we are much a
friend to him and have not done anything to him ... ?
Why don't you fight those people in America who
burn Negroes, that make a beast of you... ?' "
Divide and Conquer — isn't that a product of a cul
ture, too? But this kind of topic was never brought up
in any of the 27 two-hour discussion sessions I
(ideally) attended in my freshman year. The section
leader usually did the most talking. And we, the stu
dents, were busy writing down whatever she said,
hoping it would help us in the final. I remember sit
ting in the session bored, often getting disgusted by
the "intellectual" remarks of some students. Of
course, I'm not saying my personal experience with
the history track applies to everyone, but I do feel
that it is essential to reassess the role of the discus
sion session.
Another source of my disappointment with the
Western Culture program was its failure to examine
the Imperialist era more thoroughly. After the mid
19th century, it becomes almost impossible to
treat Europe as a separate continent; the interaction
with other cultures is just too great to be ignored. It
would be instructive to examine how the penetration
by the West changed values and societies of the tradi
tional cultures. This way, students will probably learn
Europe was never the cultural norm, that there is no
such thing as the cultural norm of the world — un
less people are taught so and encouraged to imitate
"the norm."
Although I believe the Western Culture program at
present paints a somewhat misleading, Eurocentric
picture of history, I don't agree with those who adv
ocate the World Culture program. It is a nice idea,
but I feel it should remain only as an idea. The West
ern Culture program is already extensive. Are we
going to turn freshmen into some kinds of geeks
who will never come out of libraries before mid
night? It is essential to point out the differences be
tween various cultures, but we shouldn't be bogged
down in details. A case in point was the History 21
course I took last year, "The World Outside the West
Before the Age of Imperialism." The course ex
amined the Aztec, Chinese and Nigerian cultures and
attempted to point out the changes brought about by
Western imperialism. Although it was taught by three
excellent professors and seemed very promising at
first, I was disappointed by the sixth week of the
quarter. "Hey, I might as well take three separate his
tory classes," I said to myself.
Probably, it would be better to concentrate on one
period of history. We don't have to trace the develop
ment of ideas in Asia and Africa from the age before
Christ. For instance, by comparing the traditional
Chinese philosophy and the changes precipitated by
the Western penetration, we could gain some in
sights about the interaction of cultures.
As for the complaints regarding the predominance
of white, male, European authors in the readings, I
am ambivalent. I think it is going too far to claim that
the Western Culture program manufactures

"intellectual Rambos" who have no sympathy for
minorities. The works by Marx and J.S. Mill actually
defend workers, minorities and women. Also, even
anti-feminist arguments presented in such works as
"The Political Testament" by Richelieu pose no
serious problem, as long as students and the section
leader get to criticize his outdated ideas in the dis
cussion.
But I think people at the other end of the spectrum
are no more right than those who advocate the com
plete overhaul of the Western Culture program. For
those who argue that the works by white male auth
ors were more influential throughout history, I sug
gest they try to look at history from the victims' point
of view just once. There are excellent Asian and
African literatures that describe the cultural disloca
tions caused by the Western imperialism — the ex
perience which is at the very heart of the Third
World problems today and which cannot be con
veyed through philosophical works by white, male,
European authors.
Although a separate track concentrating on the
minorities has been suggested, such a plan seems to
fall short of a fundamental change. To me, that kind
of track seems like a Western Culture equivalent of a
theme house. It is as if, "Hey, minorities are com
plaining. Let's give them a track." I believe all the
Western Culture tracks should point out the ambiva
lent nature of progress to underdogs.
Finally, I'd like to mention the main reason why I
finished so few readings, for it seems to coincide
with the most fundamental problem of the Western
Culture program. It wasn't that the readings were too
elitist or too Eurocentric. The works just weren't
provocative enough — Abelard? Castiglione? (Do I
really care about a guidebook for the Renaissance
yuppies?) The course doesn't have to be entirely
utilitarian, but I do feel it would be better to select
the works that are more relevant to today's problems.
The works I liked most (those by Dante, Machiavelli,
More, Bacon, Rousseau, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and
Conrad) had relevance to today's world. Adding an
experiential dimension to the program, with a spe
cial emphasis on the imperialist era, would be a good
first step. If the conflict between faith and reason is
an interesting topic, so is the clash between an im
perialist force and a traditional culture. It would also
help to bring in experts as often as possible. For a
lecture on Nietzsche, for instance, I'd like to have a
post-doctoral student who has just completed a dis
sertation on Nietzsche's works, rather than a regular
professor who specializes in some other field. The
VTSS track seems to be having a lot of success with
special lectures and seems to be keeping students
more interested.
I admit it would be a huge task to revise the pro
gram, but I also know it must be done soon — I want
the future freshmen to enjoy what they're learning
and finish more books than I ever did.
