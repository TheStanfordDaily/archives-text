# Country club attitudes on the Farm
## 
### 
Several weeks ago, I was asked how
I would like returning to the "Palo Alto
Country Club." My first reaction was to
ask how anyone could say such a thing
about a place when I had worked so
hard to achieve "average." I tried
denying any resemblance the Farm
had to a country club — after all, this
place used to be inhabited by cows
(some of which have remained). But
then I got to thinking; what is it about
this place and the people in it that

would give an outsider such an im
pression?
First there is the actual grounds, or
the club "property." Lots of grass areas
and old buildings .signifying the es
tablishment. There are winding roads
and an impressive entry gate. The
image of the two pillars on Palm Drive
comes to mind, as does the broad,
grassy expanse of the Oval. This club is
also equipped with the essentials: a
golf course and many tennis courts to
accommodate the best "club players
that are attracted here (who else has
had both McEnroes as their club
pros?). The nearby shopping center is
a haven for those who were "born to
shop Most clubs don t have a stadium

that can seat a small city, but ours does.
The club management has really
outdone itself here. We even have a
medical center to take care of any in
juries incurred on the links or the
courts. And of course, who can forget
the club's own band, a fine example of
where talent, organization and
diligence will get you.
The location for a country club is
very important, if you want to attract
the right kind of members. Ours is
close enough to San Francisco to be ac
cessible but far enough away to be out
of the atmosphere that surrounds a
place bustling with the business of the
"real world." One can't deny that the
abundance of nearby foreign and
sports car dealerships caters to the
tastes of our members.
Membership is another concern,
and it is clear that ours is very elite We
are so well known that we even have
people applying for membership from
Third World countries like Brazil (you
know, Rio, the place that has all of
those beaches; they even named a
movie after it). Of course, the Duchess
of Fetterland is in charge of member
ship, a position that was given her
simply because of her title. With much
pomp and circumstance, the entire
membership staff scrutinizes every ap
plicant to see if he or she has what it

takes to join "our club." They look to
see what each prospective member
can give — besides his or her life's
savings — to the community.
Yes, life at the club is pleasant, if you
don't mind the management being a
little overprotective. This could in
clude the occasional roughing up of
members who refuse to leave build
ings, but it is in the best interest of the
community as a whole to enforce these
rules. After all, who should make deci
sions about members' behavior: the
members or the club management?
We must be fair, though, by saying that
we are given more responsibility than
the members of other clubs are. Our
club, like most, is a sheltered place, but
there are reminders of the real world.
We are not without crime and injustice
or human misjudgment. You can get a
parking ticket here but only if you
blatantly ignore the rules And you
don t have to pay it if you're from out
of state.
Although there are many things that
make this place seem like a country
club or a resort, it has an inescapable
awakening power that shows itself as a
will, desire or necessity to achieve
Some people call it study or scholar
ship; many call it learning, but my fa
vorite term is simply "work (I think
this makes some people think they re

grownups and in the real world). All
over campus, people are figuring,
writing, calculating, drawing, hypoth
esizing and playing for a purpose.
You see, even though we are members
of an exclusive club, we want to — or
have to — retain our membership
rights through performance at "work"
(kind of like the real people outside
the pillars). There is another aspect of
this place that sets it apart from a club;
we take all kinds here. Sure, just about
evevone has to pay to be here (C'mon,
you don't think Don lives in that house
for nothing, do you?), but other than
that, we take just about everybody,
even bleeding liberals and blue
blooded conservatives. We have writ
ers, runners, scholars and surfers, and
an occasional surfer/scholar.
The next time someone asks you
how things are at the "Palo Alto
Country Club," tell them "fine," and
then refer them to one of the real
country clubs, like, dude, the Univer
sity of California at Santa Barbara. You
can let them think we live the good
life, because, in some respects, we do.
Just keep in mind that membership is
more a state of mind than a name on
the membership roll.

The location for a country club is
very important, if you want to attract
the right kind of members. Ours is
close enough to San Francisco to be ac
cessible but far enough away to be out
of the atmosphere that surrounds a
place bustling with the business of the
"real world." One can't deny that the
abundance of nearby foreign and
sports car dealerships caters to the
tastes of our members.
Membership is another concern,
and it is clear that ours is very elite We
are so well known that we even have
people applying for membership from
Third World countries like Brazil (you
know, Rio, the place that has all of
those beaches; they even named a
movie after it). Of course, the Duchess
of Fetterland is in charge of member
ship, a position that was given her
simply because of her title. With much
pomp and circumstance, the entire
membership staff scrutinizes every ap
plicant to see if he or she has what it

takes to join "our club." They look to
see what each prospective member
can give — besides his or her life's
savings — to the community.
Yes, life at the club is pleasant, if you
don't mind the management being a
little overprotective. This could in
clude the occasional roughing up of
members who refuse to leave build
ings, but it is in the best interest of the
community as a whole to enforce these
rules. After all, who should make deci
sions about members' behavior: the
members or the club management?
We must be fair, though, by saying that
we are given more responsibility than
the members of other clubs are. Our
club, like most, is a sheltered place, but
there are reminders of the real world.
We are not without crime and injustice
or human misjudgment. You can get a
parking ticket here but only if you
blatantly ignore the rules And you
don t have to pay it if you're from out
of state.

make this place seem like a country
club or a resort, it has an inescapable
awakening power that shows itself as a
will, desire or necessity to achieve

this makes some people think they re

over campus, people are figuring,
writing, calculating, drawing, hypoth
esizing and playing for a purpose.
You see, even though we are members
of an exclusive club, we want to — or
have to — retain our membership
rights through performance at "work"

the pillars). There is another aspect of
this place that sets it apart from a club;
we take all kinds here. Sure, just about
evevone has to pay to be here (C'mon,
you don't think Don lives in that house
for nothing, do you?), but other than
that, we take just about everybody,
even bleeding liberals and blue
blooded conservatives. We have writ

an occasional surfer/scholar.
The next time someone asks you
how things are at the "Palo Alto
Country Club," tell them "fine," and

life, because, in some respects, we do.
Just keep in mind that membership is
more a state of mind than a name on
the membership roll.

Several weeks ago, I was asked how
I would like returning to the "Palo Alto
Country Club." My first reaction was to
ask how anyone could say such a thing
about a place when I had worked so
hard to achieve "average." I tried
denying any resemblance the Farm
had to a country club — after all, this
place used to be inhabited by cows
(some of which have remained). But
then I got to thinking; what is it about
this place and the people in it that

would give an outsider such an im
pression?
First there is the actual grounds, or
the club "property." Lots of grass areas
and old buildings .signifying the es
tablishment. There are winding roads
and an impressive entry gate. The
image of the two pillars on Palm Drive
comes to mind, as does the broad,
grassy expanse of the Oval. This club is
also equipped with the essentials: a
golf course and many tennis courts to
accommodate the best "club players
that are attracted here (who else has
had both McEnroes as their club
pros?). The nearby shopping center is
a haven for those who were "born to
shop Most clubs don t have a stadium

that can seat a small city, but ours does.
The club management has really
outdone itself here. We even have a
medical center to take care of any in
juries incurred on the links or the
courts. And of course, who can forget
the club's own band, a fine example of
where talent, organization and
diligence will get you.
