Calendar fosters
bad stereotypes
Excuse me for continuing, for a
moment more, the chic protestable
issue this week, but there are a few
points I would like to emphasize
regarding Scott Shaeffer's column
(Daily, Oct. 9) and subsequent reac
tions.
Perhaps Shaeffer did make some
overgeneralizations. People who feel
strongly about an issue are tempted to
exaggerate to make their point. What
truly angered me were the responses
in The Daily — letters that thoroughly
ignored an issue that is more
problematic than most people would
like to think.
Shaeffer's point was simply that the
calendar propagates a certain particu
larly dangerous stereotype. The dan
ger is twofold: One, as Shaeffer
pointed out, is the mental and physi
cal damage it can inflict on women on
an individual level. This point
should be obvious. To the producer
of the calendar: Don't fool yourself,
you are contributing to a harmful
institution. The problem is not unique
to women. Men must deal with
stereotypical male images, also. To the
women who complained of Shaeffer's
generalization of women as weak:
Scott and all of us well know the
situation works both ways.
The second danger concerns the
pervasive influence of the media on
every man and woman on this earth.
As long as the media perceives a
singular beauty, people everywhere
will be directly affected by it. Women
who dare challenge the stereotype —
"unusual" or unconventionally attrac
tive women — must constantly
grapple with the "Christie Brinkley"
image. Because they don't tiy to look
like just about everyone else, they
must deal with being looked upon as
"different" in a negative sense. We
know the situation applies to men as
well.
What I am questioning, in short, is
why one's personal formation must
always take into account this

stereotype. It is difficult enough to
find one's true self; why make it any
harder? No one needs the "Women of
Stanford" calendar.

Producer dodged
the issues
I was really impressed to see how
far Linda Dodge took her creative
capabilities as a Stanford woman. OK,
maybe the idea for the "Women of
Stanford" calendar was not so
original; we've seen "The Women of
This University," "The Women of That
University," "Girls of the Pac-10," etc.,
before. But putting together a calen
dar with real selling potential — at
least the "3,000" guys she claims to
have gotten "off the hook" — is really
something to be proud of. After all,
what's so bad about putting up a
photo or 12 of seductively posed
swimsuit-clad women you've never
met before? Maybe you'd like to meet
them now.
OK, they weren't all in swimsuits,
some were even wearing sweaters.
Maybe I'm being too harsh on the
guys who buy this stuff — since, after
all, there are certainly calendars dis
playing "The Men of Such and Such
University" that sell to women. And
maybe these calendars have male
producers in order to get female
buyers "off the hook."
Come on, Linda, don't dodge the
issues. Your "cute" production (Did it
make you a profit?) is full of
stereotypes that are harmful to
women and men. Miss January to Miss
December (or Mr. January to Mr.
December) is a pretty one
dimensional presentation of any
group of people.
Why the Stanford Bookstore let you
use the Stanford name for your calen
dar is puzzling to me. But maybe the
person who made the decision is
female and so that gets everybody "off
the hook."
