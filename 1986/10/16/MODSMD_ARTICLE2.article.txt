# Grad housing gets good reviews
## 
### PAULA SIMONS 
When the Stanford Board of Trus
tees approved plans Tuesday for new
single-student graduate housing, they
accomplished the near impossible â€”
they made everybody happy.
Plans for new housing have been in
the works since 1982, according to
Carol Muller of the Student Affairs Of
fice, the project coordinator. Muller
said the project could not go ahead
earlier because Stanford was carrying a
heavy debt from building the Gover
nor's Corner undergraduate
residences. She credited Provost James
Rosse and Dean of Graduate Studies
Elizabeth Traugott for spearheading
the drive to get the project built.
Traugott referred to the new housing
complex as "the most important ac
complishment of my whole deanship."
Traugott said the demand for graduate
student housing has increased dramati
cally in recent years. Previously, she
said, graduate students wanted the in
dependence of living off campus. But
now, not only are off-campus rents ex
tremely high, but many students also
want to live on campus to have access
to Stanford's main-frame computers,
she said.
While Traugott said she is very
pleased that new graduate student
housing is on the way, she added that
the complex is "just a drop in the
bucket." Traugott said she hopes more
graduate housing will be built soon.
She said she wants to accommodate
Stanford students and to use new
housing as a valuable recruiting tool.
According to descriptions provided
by John Lee, the architect from the San
Francisco firm in charge of the project,
Backen, Arrigoni and Ross, the com
plex should attract new students. The
30 two- and three-story apartment
buildings are designed for life in an
earthquake zone. Lee called them "the
safest type of building."
The centerpiece of the complex will
be the Buttery, a brick structure built
around 1875. Lee said he plans to
renovate the Buttery so that it will be
structurally safe and the focal point of

the complex's common area.
The new facilities will lie ideal for
handicapped students, according to
Lee. Ten apartments will Ik* designed
for those in wheelchairs, and Lee said
the landscaping will also be done to ac
commodate the needs of wheelchair

users and the visually impaired.
The project should tx* completed in
the fall of 1988, at a cost of 130 million.
Lee said he expects the project to be
completed on time and on budget.
The finished complex will house "'BO
students in 29,500 square feet ol space.
