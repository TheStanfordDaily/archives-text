## Calendars' cash calls capitalists Two groups vie for the year 
### KELLY FORD 
Two enterprising student groups
have taken the plunge into capitalism
and are now sales competitors market
ing Stanford calendars in the
Bookstore and around the local area.
The Calen Corporation, consisting of
students Rick Dyer, Mike Yang and
Skip Dyer, is the producer ot the
"Spirit of Stanford" calendar. The
calendar spans 15 months and contains
both traditional calendar dates and
dates of important campus events. The
photographs convey some of the per
sonality of Stanford, such as the Band,
studying in the sun or a rainy winter
day.
Rick Dyer said the group was in
spired to create a calendar when it saw
an alumni calendar composed of
scenic still shots taken around campus.
"There's a lot of excitement on campus
â€” the people, the facilities. We don't
think the campus is best portrayed as
12 still shots," Dyer explained.
"We think we've presented a lively
idea of what campus life is all about.
Our main goal is to keep people in
touch with the excitement of Stan
ford.''
Dyer and his colleagues first dis
cussed the feasibility of such a project
in February. By April, they had
tracked down their photographers,
and Dead Week of spring quarter was
"all work on the calendar, to the dis
may of our grades," Dyer recalled with
a chuckle.
The group obtained a license to use
the Stanford name through the Stan
ford Bookstore. The Bookstore

receives a percentage of all calendars
sold, whether on campus or at area
bookstores off campus.
In addition to selling the calendar at
seven local bookstores, the group
placed an ad in the Stanford Alumni
Magazine. Dyer said he is pleased with
the success of the calendar but added,
"It could always do better. We all
looked upon this as a learning experi
ence, whether we made money or lost
money. If we don't break even, then ...
well, it was just an expensive learning
experience."
But Dyer is optimistic about the
future of his corporation. "I think we
will probably make another calendar
next year, whether it's the 'Spirit of
Stanford' or some other format," he
said.
While Dyer and his friends are
banking on the beauty of campus to
sell their product, their competition,
students Linda Dodge and John
Forster, are counting on the beauty of
Stanford's women for the success of the
"Women of Stanford" calendar.
Dodge said she started work on the
calendar during winter quarter, when
she contacted Daily photographer
David Kravetz for help. Kravetz helped
select the women to be photographed
and chose the background settings for
the pictures.
So far, Dodge said she has been
pleased with the success of her calen
dar. It is now marketed in 10
bookstores throughout Palo Alto and
San Francisco, each of which initially
ordered 10 to 20 calendars. Be
cause the calendar begins in January,
Dodge said she looks forward to in
creased sales later in the year. Next
year she hopes to offer a men's calen
dar, too. "We would have made one
this year, hut we just ran out of time,"
she said.
The promotion of such a calendar
has stirred controversy over whether
the Stanford name should be put on a
product that portrays a certain type of
person as typical of Stanford, and as a
result, a lengthy commentary denounc

ing the calendar appeared in The Daily
last Thursday. Since that time, a
barrage of counterattacks against the
author's opinions has also appeared.
According to Dodge, the calendar is
innocent enough. "We just created a
product that we thought would be
popular. It was not our intention to of
fend anybody."
Merielle Flood ot the Stanford
Women's Center disagreed. "We are
basically opposed to any product
which objectifies men or women and
focuses only on physical beauty.
Beauty is more than skin-deep. The en
vironment here [at Stanford] ought to
discourage this type of stereotyping."
Despite the controversy, the calen

dar is selling well. Bookstore buyer
Mark Ouimet dealt with both student
groups last spring when they re
quested licenses for their products. He
said the bookstore initially ordered
200 copies of each calendar. All of the
"Spirit of Stanford" calendars were
sold, and a new order was placed.
About half of the "Women of Stanford"
calendars have been sold
"Spirit of Stanford" is targeted for
the loyal and nostalgic Stanford crowd,
while Gail Mackauf, Ms. March in
"Women of Stanford," jokingly notes
that "a lot of guys may buy the Women
of Stanford' calendar just to see if the
ugly Stanford women' jokes are really
true after all."
