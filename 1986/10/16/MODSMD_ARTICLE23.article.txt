# Twins tout horn hoots

### JAMES R. DICKEY 
Two young women walk discreetly down a San Fran
cisco street carrying large dark cases. Suddenly, a
policeman stops them.
He is not fooled by their innocent garb. The bobby
socks and Swiss costumes are ignored as he insists on ex
amining their baggage.
The cases are five-feet long, one foot in diameter at the
large end and a half foot in diameter at the small end.
They are made of brown canvas and have a zipper down
one side. They clink ominously.
Fortunately, the policeman discovers that these cases
do not conceal weapons or drugs, but Alpenhorns.
The Alpenhorn, also known as the Alphorn, is the an
cestor of the French horn and a much simpler instru
ment, musically speaking. The Alphorn has been used for
centuries to spread the news of weddings, funerals and
festivals from mountaintop to mountaintop in the Swiss
Alps.
In the 20th century it is used by two Stanford seniors
to spread fun and enjoyment. Twins Pam and Pat Tansey,
who are human biology majors, have been playing these
ancient Swiss instruments since the age of 16.
Their interest in the unusual horn was sparked at an
early age by their grandfather. He told them tales of their
Swiss ancestors who played these historical instruments.
According to Pat, "He probably told us the stories in or
der to get us to practice the French horn." Obviously the
stories worked, because the sisters played the French
horn from the third grade on.
The most common Alphorn, the type that Pat and Pam
play, is 12 feet in length and plays in the key of G-flat.
Their instruments were shipped from Switzerland at a
cost of $1,000 each.
During her studies at Stanford-in-Vienna last spring,
Pat was able to visit the factory that made her Alphorn.
She was also fortunate enough to play a duet with the fac
tory's resident musician.
Asked about her performance there, Pat said, "I hadn't
played in a while, but I was still able to keep up."
The nature of the Alphorn makes Pat's performance
particularly outstanding. Its large size and wooden con
struction make it very tough on the lips of the performer.

When Alpenhorns are two of a kind, you will likely find seniors Pat and Pam Tansey holding
aloft these Swiss instruments.
