# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

My angel is a
Playboy photographer, David Chan, visited
the Stanford campus last fall to recruit women
for the magazine's "Women of the Pac-10" pic
torial. Immediately, a hue and cry was raised,
protests were held and, ultimately, two Stan
ford women posed for the photographer.
rhe saga continues. Last spring, the übiqui
tous Mr. Chan showed up at Ivy League col
leges, looking to fill the "Women of the Ivy
League" spread, according to the Sept. 9 Daily
Pennsylvanian, the campus newspaper of the
University of Pennsylvania.
Chan dropped by all the Ivy League colleges

"amid vigorous protests from many women's
groups." The Crimson, Harvard's newspaper,
refused to run his ads, while demonstrators at
Cornell held a "guerrilla theater performance
of the fictional Mis Ogyny being auctioned in
the street for the Playboy modeling fee."
Along more organized lines, representatives
of women's groups from eight Ivy schools met
at Yale University to produce a publication
bearing the "Women of the Ivy League" title.
Unlike its namesake, though, this work con
tains poems, short fiction and other writings in
addition to photographs, and was intended to
show that "women have minds as well as
bodies."

Not all of the protests were concerned with
exploitation — at least on an ideological level.
A senior at Pennsylvania was a professional
model and was offered a chance to pose for the
magazine.
"But they only offered us $500 for a fully
nude picture," she added. "I've been offered
$10,000 for that kind of work."
This ain't no never never land
On a related topic, "the conservative voice of
television," Wally George, showed up to a
crowd of 170 in the San Jose State University

Student Union Ballroom, according to that
campus' Spartan Daily.
George, long a fixture of KDOC Channel 56
in Orange County (up the road from Dis
neyland and down a piece from John Wayne
Memorial Airport), gained prominence with his
talkshow, "Hot Seat," in which he verbally as
saulted various liberals, loonies and other tar
gets, and then usually kicked them off the show
for unruly behavior.
True to form, "Wal-lee" (as he is known to
his fans) spoke for an hour on different topics,
"calling public figures 'freakos' and 'wimps,'
and referring to San Francisco as 'San Fran
sissy,' while the audience cheered."

He called for voters to turn out California Su
preme Court Chief Justice Rose Bird. "She's
overturned every single death sentence ever
since she's been in office, and I say let's toss her
out on her fanny," something which he has a lot
of experience in, judging from his program.
Unfortunately for SJS' Associated Students
Program Board, which sponsored the event,
George's appearance left them $1,000 poorer,
mostly due to low ticket prices and virtually no
advertising campaign.
"These liberals are crying freedom of
speech," he said at one point. "But they only
want that freedom for people who believe the
same way they do."
