In fasionable critico-journalistico lingo, the aesthetics of
Le Sampan, a Vietnamese restaurant on Birch near Califor
nia, will be described as "eclectic." That's a euphemism.
Rather, they're schizophrenic.
There's some modern Asian woodwork decorated in the
ever-popular Napa vineyard motif, a pale-blue sea life mural
and some artwork in the lattice-work booths. It's an exciting
sort of tacky elegance with the emphasis on elegance.
The restaurant is owned by a Vietamese family who lived
in France for a spell and now allow a cross-cultural past to
manifest itself in the decor of Le Sampan. But if they had
wanted aesthetics, they would have opened a gallery. In
stead, they successfuly turn our attention to the food.
A bad first impression is dangerous but not fatal, espe
cially among restaurant critics who grade on improvement.
Cha gio ($3.50) is an Imperial Roll which differs from a
common Spring Roll mainly in its more majestic name. It's
ground pork and vegetables rolled in paper-thin rice pastry,
lightly battered and fried till crunchy, not greasy â€” and

that's important when dealing with rolls. Dipped in a very
light variation on soy sauce, this pleased but did not excite
us.
Mi xao thap cam ($4.75) moved us gingerly and is a fine
combination of seasonings with beef, shrimp, squid,
vegetables and pan-fried rice noodles.
And our longtime favorite, Chao torn ($7.50), is as good as
any we've tasted anywhere. There is a real art to creating sat
isfying shrimp balls. These are served around sugar cane
and over steamed rice noodles. This is especially good
when complemented by the ginger plum sauce with finely
chopped cashews.
Our favorite selection was the Gao xao xa which is
sauteed chicken with lemon grass ($5 25). Lemon and green
pepper combine for an effect you can't expect. The dish also
has a subtle kick that sneaks up on you. You don't know
where it's coming from. But we'll tell you. It's red chili.
A few concluding notes. The service was perfect. They
don't accept credit cards yet, but will soon. They don't serve
any Asian beers, but they do have Heineken and
Moosehead.
Le Sampan is the French name for a particular small Asian
sailing vessel. It's a nice symbol of the variety of influences
on this particular cuisine and the journey that brought it to
Palo Alto.
