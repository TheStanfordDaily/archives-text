Visiting St. Mary's spoiled the Stanford
men's soccer team's Pacific Soccer Confer
ence opener yesterday, knocking off the
Cardinal 1-0 at Maloney Field. Stanford
dropped to 5-6-2 overall.

for the first 20 minutes of the game. We had

convert them.

close them down the entire game. From the
20-minute mark up to the last 10 minutes or

Freshman forward Chris Porch, tied for
the team lead in goals and points, was
subdued after the loss.
"That was one of the games in the league

we were favored to win. It seemed we were
all waiting for someone else to make the
play after we started so well," Porch said.

slightly in the first half, St. Mary's began to
apply more pressure. The Gaels finally con

mark of the first half. Jeff Peters scored on
an assist from Andrew Brumm.
"It was a quick counter (attack)," Koch
said. "The shot was deflected. I talked to
