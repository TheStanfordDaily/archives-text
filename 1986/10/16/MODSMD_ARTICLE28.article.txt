## Gaels shut out Cardinal in conference matchup 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Visiting St. Mary's spoiled the Stanford
men's soccer team's Pacific Soccer Confer
ence opener yesterday, knocking off the
Cardinal 1-0 at Maloney Field. Stanford
dropped to 5-6-2 overall.
Stanford, riding the crest of a victory
wave that included back-to-back non
conference wins over Westmont and UC-
Davis, came out confident and rolled
through the early stages of the first half.
"Our game plan was to shut them down

quickly and put the man with the ball under
pressure," Stanford Coach Sam Koch said.
"We marked them well and dominated play
for the first 20 minutes of the game. We had
two excellent chances to score but didn't
convert them.
"We were not disciplined enough to
close them down the entire game. From the
20-minute mark up to the last 10 minutes or
so, they controlled the ball," Koch added.
Freshman forward Chris Porch, tied for
the team lead in goals and points, was
subdued after the loss.
"That was one of the games in the league

we were favored to win. It seemed we were
all waiting for someone else to make the
play after we started so well," Porch said.
Soon after Stanford's marking fell off
slightly in the first half, St. Mary's began to
apply more pressure. The Gaels finally con
nected for the game's only goal at the 38:57
mark of the first half. Jeff Peters scored on
an assist from Andrew Brumm.
"It was a quick counter (attack)," Koch
said. "The shot was deflected. I talked to

game. He said he had it until it was
deflected."
Austin played another fine game in
allowing just one goal and lowered his
goals-against average to 1.23 per game.
Austin recorded four saves on 12 St.
Mary's shots.
St. Mary's goalie Randall Smith, who
brought a 1.65 goals-against average
into the game, was impressive in
recording four saves to shut out Stan
ford, which ended with 10 shots on
goal.
Stanford fullback Jim Killfoil also
turned in a strong performance, com
ing off the bench to replace David
Thorpe.
The Cardinal was able to mount a
late surge in the second half, which al
most resulted in the tying goal, but
again the team came up short.
"We had some more great chances
in the last 10 minutes," Koch said. "We
were all over them.
"Overall, we tried to attack up the
middle too much. We need to move
the ball out to the wings more often.
There are less defenders out there. It's
simple mathematics. We will learn
from our mistakes."
Despite the loss, Koch is still quite
optimistic about the rest of the season.
"This is a setback, but I feel confi
dent we'll turn it around on Saturday.
We're too good a team to let this game
ruin our season," Koch said.
