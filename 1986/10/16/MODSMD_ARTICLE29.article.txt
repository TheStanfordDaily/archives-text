# Stanford wins fans while losing game
## 
### 
A group of reporters were sitting around Brad
Muster in the locker room following Stanford's
victory over San Diego State that gave the Card
inal a 4-0 record for the first time since 1952. It
had been written in this space two days earlier
that we wouldn't know if the Cardinal was for real
until it beat a top-20 team.
Muster responded to one question by looking
at me and saying, "Why don't you ask John Lis
here if we're for real yet?"
Muster wasn't the only player on that team up
set at the general lack of faith in the Cardinal's tal
ent. They had played four games; they had won all
four. They had done all they were asked, and yet
the doubts persisted.

I promised several players that, should they
beat Washington, a public apology for lack of faith
would appear in this space today. They didn't.
But the biggest irony of this season is that in
losing, the Cardinal won more believers than in
winning four games. They couldn't quite get die
job done, yet few are the Stanford supporters
who doubt the ability of this team.
Let's face it: The Cardinal played Washington
dead solid even for 55 minutes, until that
memorable fourth-down play failed at the Husky
5-yard line. And if either field-goal attempt by
David Sweeney had been successful when the
Cardinal trailed 17-14, a Stanford victory was the
likely outcome.
In losing last Saturday, the Cardinal proved that
it can play at the level of a top-10 team — maybe
even play with any team in the country.
Stanford has now shown that it can beat tffc
teams it is supposed to beat, and stay even with
the teams ranked ahead of it.
The Cardinal is now in a seven-team race for
the Pacific 10 Conference title and is one of five
teams with one loss and no ties. If Stanford can
beat those teams ranked ahead of it — USC, UCLA
and Arizona — and continue beating the teams it
should, what looked like a pipe dream a month
ago could be a reality a month from now.

Not everyone believes
Apparently, not enough sportswriters who vote
in the Associated Press poll watched the Stanford-
Washington game. At the time, Stanford was
ranked No. 18, Washington No. 12.
Common logic says that the game should be
close, hut Washington should win because it is
the better team. That happened. That should con
firm the ratings as being somewhat correct.
What happened? Stanford fell out of the top 20,
coming in at No. 22 this week. Why a ranked team
that loses to a higher-ranked team should fall out
of the top 20 makes no sense.
Another example: When Miami (Fla.) beat
Oklahoma, the Sooners fell from No. 1 to No. 6 in
losing to the No. 2 team. A fall from No. 1 to No. 2,
yes. But No. 6? C'mon, do they really believe that?
One source for optimism: The Huskies
climbed from No. 12 to No. 9 on the strength of
defeating Stanford. You figure it out.
What's next?
Last weekend had to be one of the greatest
sports weekends in memory. Wake up Saturday
morning to watch Len Dykstra's ninth-inning
home run give die Mets a one-run victory. Flip to
the UCLA-Arizona game and watch Gaston Green
break a touchdown run in the last minute to com
plete a come-from-18-points-behind win for the
Bruins.
Head down to Stanford Stadium to watch the
Cardinal come oh-so-close against the Huskies.
Then hurry back to watch Calvin Schiraldi blow a
Red Sox lead with a hit batter with two out and
the bases loaded in the ninth as the Angels take it
in 11 innings.
Then, Sunday morning, start with the greatest
baseball game since Game 6 of the 1975 World
Series and Dave Henderson's two-run, two-out,
two-strike, ninth-inning, put-that-champagne
back homer and the Red Sox win in 12. Then the
49erygif imt? overtime, only to lose to the
Vikings. Then Mike Scott stakes his claim as the
best pitcher in the National League as he pulls the
Astros even.
Thank God for the rainout Monday.
And seriously, who is respoasible for schedul
ing classes during post-season baseball games?
One last thought: Can the World Series even
hope to come close to the two League Champion
ship series?

here if we're for real yet?"
Muster wasn't the only player on that team up
set at the general lack of faith in the Cardinal's tal
ent. They had played four games; they had won all
four. They had done all they were asked, and yet
the doubts persisted.

I promised several players that, should they
beat Washington, a public apology for lack of faith
would appear in this space today. They didn't.
But the biggest irony of this season is that in
losing, the Cardinal won more believers than in
winning four games. They couldn't quite get die
job done, yet few are the Stanford supporters
who doubt the ability of this team.
Let's face it: The Cardinal played Washington
dead solid even for 55 minutes, until that
memorable fourth-down play failed at the Husky
5-yard line. And if either field-goal attempt by
David Sweeney had been successful when the
Cardinal trailed 17-14, a Stanford victory was the
likely outcome.
In losing last Saturday, the Cardinal proved that
it can play at the level of a top-10 team — maybe
even play with any team in the country.
Stanford has now shown that it can beat tffc
teams it is supposed to beat, and stay even with
the teams ranked ahead of it.
The Cardinal is now in a seven-team race for
the Pacific 10 Conference title and is one of five
teams with one loss and no ties. If Stanford can
beat those teams ranked ahead of it — USC, UCLA
and Arizona — and continue beating the teams it
should, what looked like a pipe dream a month
ago could be a reality a month from now.

Not everyone believes
Apparently, not enough sportswriters who vote
in the Associated Press poll watched the Stanford-
Washington game. At the time, Stanford was
ranked No. 18, Washington No. 12.
Common logic says that the game should be
close, hut Washington should win because it is
the better team. That happened. That should con
firm the ratings as being somewhat correct.
What happened? Stanford fell out of the top 20,
coming in at No. 22 this week. Why a ranked team
that loses to a higher-ranked team should fall out
of the top 20 makes no sense.
Another example: When Miami (Fla.) beat
Oklahoma, the Sooners fell from No. 1 to No. 6 in
losing to the No. 2 team. A fall from No. 1 to No. 2,
yes. But No. 6? C'mon, do they really believe that?
One source for optimism: The Huskies
climbed from No. 12 to No. 9 on the strength of
defeating Stanford. You figure it out.
What's next?
Last weekend had to be one of the greatest
sports weekends in memory. Wake up Saturday
morning to watch Len Dykstra's ninth-inning
home run give die Mets a one-run victory. Flip to
the UCLA-Arizona game and watch Gaston Green
break a touchdown run in the last minute to com
plete a come-from-18-points-behind win for the
Bruins.
Head down to Stanford Stadium to watch the
Cardinal come oh-so-close against the Huskies.
Then hurry back to watch Calvin Schiraldi blow a
Red Sox lead with a hit batter with two out and
the bases loaded in the ninth as the Angels take it
in 11 innings.
Then, Sunday morning, start with the greatest
baseball game since Game 6 of the 1975 World
Series and Dave Henderson's two-run, two-out,
two-strike, ninth-inning, put-that-champagne
back homer and the Red Sox win in 12. Then the
49erygif imt? overtime, only to lose to the
Vikings. Then Mike Scott stakes his claim as the
best pitcher in the National League as he pulls the
Astros even.
Thank God for the rainout Monday.
And seriously, who is respoasible for schedul
ing classes during post-season baseball games?
One last thought: Can the World Series even
hope to come close to the two League Champion
ship series?
