# Mets, Red Sox clinch
## 
### 
BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox, with pitching
ace Roger Clemens leading the way, thrashed the
California Angels 8-1 last night to win
Game 7 of the American League playoffs and a
trip to the World Series.
Boston completed its comeback from a last
strike 3-1 deficit in the series in surprisingly easy
fashion and put a crushing end to the season for
the Angels, while also continuing the big-game
jinx that has always plagued Manager Gene
Mauch.
Clemens' four-hit pitching into the seventh in
ning and a towering three-run homer by Jim Rice
helped deny California the first pennant in its 26-

year history and also re-routed Mauch's plans for
his first World Series in 25 years of managing.
The Red Sox, aided by two crucial errors,
knocked out John Candelaria in the fourth in
taking a 7-0 lead. They then cruised into their
World Series showdown with the New York Mets.
Game 1 will be Saturday night in New York.
Mauch, whose team had been within one strike
of the championship on Sunday, had said after
losing Game 6 that the decisive game would show
which team knew how to win when it had to —
and it did, as another one of his teams collapsed
under pressure.
Clemens, after failing to win in his
first two starts in the series, showed the
form that made him baseball's most
dominant pitcher this season. He
settled into a groove early in the 56-
degree night and was never in serious
trouble, striking out three while
walking just one.
Clemens gave up a leadoff single to
Ruppert Jones in the seventh and was
relieved by Calvin Schiraldi. Clemens
walked off the field to a thunderous
ovation and chants of "Roger, Roger."
Schiraldi allowed an RBI double to
Doug DeCinces with two out. But he
struck out the side in the ninth.
Mets 7, Astros 6
HOUSTON — Ray Knight keyed a
three-run 16th inning yesterday and

the New York Mets survived one last
Houston Astros' rally to win their third
National League pennant, 7-6, in the
longest post-season game ever.
The Mets' extra-inning rally was
their second of the game as they
erased a 3-0 deficit in the ninth inning
and took a 4-3 lead in the 14th before
the Astros' Billy Hatcher tied it in the
bottom of the inning with a home run
that hit the screen attached to the left
field foul pole.
Darryl Strawberry, hitless in four
previous at-bats, started the winning
rally with a pop-fly double off losing
pitcher Aurelio Lopez. Strawberry hit
the ball off his fists into center field,
and the ball fell between Hatcher and
second baseman Bill Doran. The ball
hit the artificial turf and bounced over
Hatcher's head as Strawberry went to
second.
Knight, traded from the Astros to
New York in 1984, then singled to right
field. Houston right fielder Kevin Bass'
throw was up the third-base line and
too late to get Strawberry.
