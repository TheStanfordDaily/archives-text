# Mets, Red Sox clinch

### 
BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox, with pitching
ace Roger Clemens leading the way, thrashed the
California Angels 8-1 last night to win
Game 7 of the American League playoffs and a
trip to the World Series.
Boston completed its comeback from a last
strike 3-1 deficit in the series in surprisingly easy
fashion and put a crushing end to the season for
the Angels, while also continuing the big-game
jinx that has always plagued Manager Gene
Mauch.
Clemens' four-hit pitching into the seventh in
ning and a towering three-run homer by Jim Rice
helped deny California the first pennant in its 26-

year history and also re-routed Mauch's plans for
his first World Series in 25 years of managing.
The Red Sox, aided by two crucial errors,
knocked out John Candelaria in the fourth in
taking a 7-0 lead. They then cruised into their
World Series showdown with the New York Mets.
Game 1 will be Saturday night in New York.
Mauch, whose team had been within one strike
of the championship on Sunday, had said after
losing Game 6 that the decisive game would show
which team knew how to win when it had to —
and it did, as another one of his teams collapsed
