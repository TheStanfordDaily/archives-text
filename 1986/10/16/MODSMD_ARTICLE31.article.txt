# Gamble's defense makes Card sure bet
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Every championship team has one: a consistently out
standing player who, because of a star-studded cast of
performers, goes relatively unrecocognized.
Players such as Eric Rosenfeld and Scott Moody from last
year's NCAA champion Stanford men's tennis team come to
mind. After winning the title, senior stars Dan Goldie and
Jim Grabb received much of the accolades. Despite having
great NCAA tournaments, Rosenfeld and Moody just didn't
get the ink.
The defending national champion Stanford men's water
polo team (20-0 this year) is no different.
After crushing No. 2 California four times this season and
winning 29 straight games dating back to last year, the Card
inal is beginning to get some press. The players always men
tioned are three-time All-America David Imbernino and
1985 Pacific 10 Conference Player of the Year Craig Klass.
Klass has scored 49 goals this year, with Imbernino tallying
34.
The team's most consistent performer, however, is prob
ably senior All-America Greg Gamble.
"He is one of the best defensive players in college today,''
Stanford Asst. Coach Marvin Mouchawar said. "He is one of
the most valuable, if not the most valuable, player on the
team."
Despite being picked as a third-team All-America last year
and participating in the U.S. Olympic Festival last summer,
Gamble is often lost amid the attention given to Klass, Im
bernino and emerging superstars Todd Kemp and Erich Fis
cher.
"The lack of credit really doesn't bother me," Gamble
said. "Just so long as we are winning and playing well."
Gamble, a team performer who is the Cardinal's seventh
leading scorer with 16 goals this season, excels in several
areas that don't show up on the scoreboard, including
defense and leadership, and also possesses an uncanny abil
ity to come through when the game is on the line.
"He has been in a group with Imbernino and Klass and
hasn't gotten the credit for the job he has done," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "He sacrifices scoring to do
other things for the team."

For example, Gamble is widely regarded as the top defen
sive player in collegiate water polo.
"He is our top defensive player," Dettamanti said. "He is
the guy you can count on not to make a mistake. I always as
sign him to guard the opposing team's top offensive player."
Gamble is one of the principal reasons that Stanford has
held its opponents to under five goals per game. In the first

quarter this season, when the Cardinal usually jumps out to
an early lead, Stanford opponents have scored only 16 goals
in 20 contests.
Gamble's second major attribute is his role as a leader
and motivator.
"He is a real good team leader," Kemp said. "He is capa
ble of being a coach type of player. He helps with the

defense and the offense as well."
A four-year Cardinal starter, Gamble entered Stanford in
1983 as a first-team high school All-America from Hanford.
During his freshman year at Stanford, the team finished 11-
13-3. u
Since then, Gamble and his teammates have finished
second and first in the NCAA championships. Year by year,
culminating in his senior season this year, Gamble has
gained a reputation as a player to be emulated.
"His leadership out there is what's really important, Im
bernino said.
"He just has a good time out there," Mouchawar said. He
has fun, and that rubs off on everyone else. He is always
keeping the team in line, keeping the team in a positive atti
tude and motivating everyone to play."
For the first time since 1981 on the Farm, the Cardinal has
a chance to beat every team it plays this year. It is this factor,
along with the fact that the current seniors began their
careers with a losing season, that continues to egg the Stan
ford players on.
"Something 1 have drawn upon (for motivation),'
Gamble said, "is that this year, for the first time in my years
here, we have a chance to beat and even humiliate every
team we play."
In addition to his defensive and leadership skills, Gamble
plays at his best in close contests where one play is likely to
tip the balance one way or the other.
"The tough situations, when it's really getting intense,
people can get worried about what's going on," Gamble
said. "I try to keep people calm and under control, to play
like we can play."
Two plays from last year's NCAA title game exemplify
Gamble's effectiveness in tight situations.
With UC-Irvine ahead 10-9 and 13 seconds remaining in
regulation, Gamble drew the foul that stopped the clock and
led to Matt Tingler's tying goal. In overtime, he drew the
ejection of an Irvine player that led to a six-on-five advan
tage for Stanford and Tingler's winning goal.
These plays are examples of the intangible qualities that
Gamble has provided for the Cardinal this year. The plays
go unnoticed except by coaches and teammates.
"No one really notices a Gamble except for someone who
really knows the game," Mouchawar said.

Players such as Eric Rosenfeld and Scott Moody from last
year's NCAA champion Stanford men's tennis team come to
mind. After winning the title, senior stars Dan Goldie and
Jim Grabb received much of the accolades. Despite having
great NCAA tournaments, Rosenfeld and Moody just didn't
get the ink.
The defending national champion Stanford men's water
polo team (20-0 this year) is no different.
After crushing No. 2 California four times this season and
winning 29 straight games dating back to last year, the Card
inal is beginning to get some press. The players always men
tioned are three-time All-America David Imbernino and
1985 Pacific 10 Conference Player of the Year Craig Klass.
Klass has scored 49 goals this year, with Imbernino tallying
34.
The team's most consistent performer, however, is prob
ably senior All-America Greg Gamble.
"He is one of the best defensive players in college today,''
Stanford Asst. Coach Marvin Mouchawar said. "He is one of
the most valuable, if not the most valuable, player on the
team."
Despite being picked as a third-team All-America last year
and participating in the U.S. Olympic Festival last summer,
Gamble is often lost amid the attention given to Klass, Im
bernino and emerging superstars Todd Kemp and Erich Fis
cher.
"The lack of credit really doesn't bother me," Gamble
said. "Just so long as we are winning and playing well."
Gamble, a team performer who is the Cardinal's seventh
leading scorer with 16 goals this season, excels in several
areas that don't show up on the scoreboard, including
defense and leadership, and also possesses an uncanny abil
ity to come through when the game is on the line.
"He has been in a group with Imbernino and Klass and
hasn't gotten the credit for the job he has done," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "He sacrifices scoring to do
other things for the team."

For example, Gamble is widely regarded as the top defen
sive player in collegiate water polo.
"He is our top defensive player," Dettamanti said. "He is
the guy you can count on not to make a mistake. I always as
sign him to guard the opposing team's top offensive player."
Gamble is one of the principal reasons that Stanford has
held its opponents to under five goals per game. In the first

quarter this season, when the Cardinal usually jumps out to
an early lead, Stanford opponents have scored only 16 goals
in 20 contests.
Gamble's second major attribute is his role as a leader
and motivator.
"He is a real good team leader," Kemp said. "He is capa
ble of being a coach type of player. He helps with the

defense and the offense as well."
A four-year Cardinal starter, Gamble entered Stanford in
1983 as a first-team high school All-America from Hanford.
During his freshman year at Stanford, the team finished 11-
13-3. u
Since then, Gamble and his teammates have finished
second and first in the NCAA championships. Year by year,
culminating in his senior season this year, Gamble has
gained a reputation as a player to be emulated.
"His leadership out there is what's really important, Im
bernino said.
"He just has a good time out there," Mouchawar said. He
has fun, and that rubs off on everyone else. He is always
keeping the team in line, keeping the team in a positive atti
tude and motivating everyone to play."
For the first time since 1981 on the Farm, the Cardinal has
a chance to beat every team it plays this year. It is this factor,
along with the fact that the current seniors began their
careers with a losing season, that continues to egg the Stan
ford players on.
"Something 1 have drawn upon (for motivation),'
Gamble said, "is that this year, for the first time in my years
here, we have a chance to beat and even humiliate every
team we play."
In addition to his defensive and leadership skills, Gamble
plays at his best in close contests where one play is likely to
tip the balance one way or the other.
"The tough situations, when it's really getting intense,
people can get worried about what's going on," Gamble
said. "I try to keep people calm and under control, to play
like we can play."
Two plays from last year's NCAA title game exemplify
Gamble's effectiveness in tight situations.
With UC-Irvine ahead 10-9 and 13 seconds remaining in
regulation, Gamble drew the foul that stopped the clock and
led to Matt Tingler's tying goal. In overtime, he drew the
ejection of an Irvine player that led to a six-on-five advan
tage for Stanford and Tingler's winning goal.
These plays are examples of the intangible qualities that
Gamble has provided for the Cardinal this year. The plays
go unnoticed except by coaches and teammates.
"No one really notices a Gamble except for someone who
really knows the game," Mouchawar said.

Though he is seldom accorded the same publicity that surrounds several of his teammates, senior Greg Gamble is
"one of the most valuable, if not the most valuable, player on the team," according to Stanford Asst. Coach Marvin
Mouchawar.
