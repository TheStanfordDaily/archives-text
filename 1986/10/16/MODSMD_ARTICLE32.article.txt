When Hubert Green finished third
in the 1977 British Open, 10 strokes
behind Tom Watson and nine behind
Jack Nicklaus, he felt that he deserved a
trophy of some kind.
"I won the golf tournament," Green
said. "I don't know what game those
two other guys were playing."
The Stanford women's golf team was
the Hubert Green of the Washington
Invitational that concluded yesterday at
the par-72, 5,900-yard Sahalee Golf

Course in Redmond, Wash.
With 944 strokes, the Cardinal edged
out Brigham Young (948) and host
Washington (954) for fourth place, but
Stanford finished a distant 21 strokes
behind third-place San Jose State (923)
and trailed champion USC (912) by 32.
New Mexico was second with a 916
score.
It was a solid showing for Stanford,
as the Cardinal was without probably
its top player, Kathleen McCarthy, who
is competing at the World Amateur
Championships.

Kay Cornelius took McCarthy's place
at the top of the Stanford lineup, and
her performance suggests that she may
be difficult to unseat. Cornelius fired
rounds of 74,77 and 78 to finish in fifth
place among individuals at 229. USC's
Tracy Nakamura won the individual
title with a 222 total for the three
rounds.
Both Adrienne Gilmartin and Trish
McGonigle shot 238 for Stanford, with
Clare Dolan a stroke back at 239. The
Cardinal's last score was a 253 turned
in by walk-on freshman Stephanie
Parel.
