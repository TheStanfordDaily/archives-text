Looking for its third straight win, the Stanford field
hockey team hosts St. Louis University in a non-conference
game today at 5 p.m.
The contest will be a tune-up for this weekend's Califor
nia Invitational at Berkeley, in which both the Cardinal and
St. Louis will participate. The other teams in the three-day
tournament are California, Chico State, the University of the
Pacific, San Jose State and Simon-Fraser.
If that list of teams sounds familiar, it should. It includes
all five teams from the Northern Pacific Conference. UOP
currently leads the ronference with six points (a 3-1-0
record), with Stanford in second with five (2-1-1). Cal (1-1-

2) and San Jose State (2-2-0) are tied for third with four
points, and Chico State is in last with one (0-3-1).
The Cardinal has recently vaulted past the Bears and Spar
tans in the NorPac standings on the strength of back-to-back
wins over UOP and Chico State. Defense has been the key
for Stanford, which won both games 1-0.
"Our defense has been very strong all season," Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "We've been playing good team
defense. We're not scoring as much as I would like, but we
have continued to get better each game."
Stanford was also riding a two-game winning streak enter
ing the Cal Invitational last year. The Cardinal proceeded to
win the title by beating Chico State 3-1, San Jose State 2-1
and Simon Fraser 1-0.
