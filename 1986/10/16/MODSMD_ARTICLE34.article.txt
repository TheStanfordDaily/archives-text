# Speakers: SDI contradictory

"The American people are being told two different
stories that really don't match," an anthropology
graduate student said Tuesday, accusing the Reagan ad
ministration of contradicting itself in its portrayal of the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
Hugh Gusterson, participating in a panel discussion
on SDI at Toyon Hall, said that while President Reagan
consistently speaks of SDI as a defensive shield designed
to protect U.S. civilians, the director of the SDI program,
I.t. General James Abrahamson, has stated that hopes for
such a perfect shield are unrealistic.
Rather than protecting civilians from nuclear attack,
Abrahamson believes SDI to be more useful in protect
ing the U.S. nuclear arsenal from a Soviet first strike,
Gusterson said.
Dr. Kate Forrest, a member of Physicians for Social Re
sponsibility, concurred with Gusterson. "Ronald Reagan

and possibly another small minority want to have faith
that ... winning is possible by being bigger and
stronger," she said.
Prof. David Bernstein, a fellow at the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control here, also agreed.
"SDI says: 'We want to see if we can regain superiority' "
in the arms race, Bernstein said.
The apparent drive for superiority causes "U.S.
motives to become suspect" in the eyes of the Soviet Un
ion, especially in light of "a lot of loose talk in Washing
ton about limited nuclear war" during the early years of
the Reagan administration, he said.
Gusterson, referring to the failed talks at the recent
summit in Iceland, said, "Reagan was offered the most
wide-ranging arms control agreement ever offered to an
American president, and he turned it down."
Bernstein, commenting on SDl's effect on arms con
trol, said that as long as Reagan refuses to compromise
on SDI, the chances of reaching an arms control agree
ment with the Soviet Union are "virtually nil."
