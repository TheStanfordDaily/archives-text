# 1954 grad wins Nobel

### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
A Stanford graduate and two other researchers were yes
terday awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their re
search detailing how chemical reactions occur at a
molecular level.
Dudley Herschbach, now a Harvard professor, along with
Yuan Lee of the University of California-Berkeley and
Canadian professor John Polanyi of the University ot
Toronto, were given the chemistry award for research (in
the dynamics of chemical elementary processes. The
Swedish Academy of Sciences said their research was of
great importance in the development of reaction dynamics,
a branch of chemistry. The Swedish academy annually
chooses the recipients of the Nobel Prizes.
The academy said the scientists' work had opened a new
field of research in chemistry. The three will split the
$290,000 prize equally.
Herschbach could not be reached last night for comment.
Eric Hutchinson, Stanford chemistry professor emeritus,
called Herschbach "quite the most outstanding student I
have ever taught." Herschbach graduated from the Univer
sity in 1954 with an undergraduate degree in mathematics.
He received his master's degree from Stanford in chemistry
a year later.
During his undergraduate years, Herschbach accum
ulated enough credits to receive a degree in chemistry,
mathematics or physics, Hutchinson said, adding that the
University did not then allow students to major in more than
one subject.
According to Herschbach's undergraduate adviser,
Herschbach only received one grade below an A in his years
at Stanford. The adviser, Harold Johnston, who was then a
chemistry instructor at the University,
said Herschbach's one B was given by a
professor who awarded all students in
die class the same grade in order to
avoid grading the final exams.
Johnston is now a chemistry professor
at UC-Berkeley.

Besides his academic achievements,
Herschbach was also an excellent foot
ball player, according to Hutchinson.
Herschbach was "a great wide end"
who, when forced to pick between
football and academics at the end of
his freshman year, chose the chemistry
laboratory over the gridiron.
According to Johnston, Herschbach's
research is pertinent to such various
fields as combustion and atmospheric
science, among others.

As a professor at Harvard,
Herschbach has trained a number of
important researchers, including Rich
ard Zare, a chemistry professor at Stan
ford and a recipient of the National
Medal of Science. There are
"Herschbach professors" teaching in
many of the nation's outstanding uni
versities, Johnston said.
Herschbach's daughter, Lisa, is a
Stanford junior. She is currently a stu
dent at Stanford in-Oxford.
