A Stanford graduate and two other researchers were yes
terday awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their re
search detailing how chemical reactions occur at a
molecular level.
Dudley Herschbach, now a Harvard professor, along with
Yuan Lee of the University of California-Berkeley and
Canadian professor John Polanyi of the University ot
Toronto, were given the chemistry award for research (in
the dynamics of chemical elementary processes. The
Swedish Academy of Sciences said their research was of
great importance in the development of reaction dynamics,
a branch of chemistry. The Swedish academy annually
chooses the recipients of the Nobel Prizes.
The academy said the scientists' work had opened a new
field of research in chemistry. The three will split the
$290,000 prize equally.
Herschbach could not be reached last night for comment.
Eric Hutchinson, Stanford chemistry professor emeritus,
called Herschbach "quite the most outstanding student I
have ever taught." Herschbach graduated from the Univer
sity in 1954 with an undergraduate degree in mathematics.
He received his master's degree from Stanford in chemistry
a year later.
During his undergraduate years, Herschbach accum
ulated enough credits to receive a degree in chemistry,
mathematics or physics, Hutchinson said, adding that the
University did not then allow students to major in more than
one subject.
According to Herschbach's undergraduate adviser,
Herschbach only received one grade below an A in his years
at Stanford. The adviser, Harold Johnston, who was then a
