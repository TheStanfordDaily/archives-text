# Barron residents start program on toxics
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Residents of Palo Alto's Barron Park neighbor
hood, fed up with a series of chemical spills
originating on Stanford property, have begun to
educate themselves on the possible effects of
toxic waste and spills.
The first symposium on the issues, sponsored
by the residents of Barron Park, began Tuesday
night and will continue through tonight at the
Hoover School in Palo Alto. The daytime sessions
will be held at the Palo Alto Community Center.
The symposium is an active response to the 10
toxic spills that have occurred in the Barron Park
area since November 1985, said John Joynt, presi
dent of the Barron Park Association (BPA), a
group representing the Barron Park
homeowners.
"All the right people are coming," Joynt said.
Approximately 70 people turned out for Tuesday

night s speakers, and at least 30 people visited the
symposium yesterday afternoon, he said. Joynt
added that he expects similar figures throughout
the rest of the event.
Barron Park residents partially own two creeks
that run through the community and are adjacent
to the Stanford Industrial Park, a research park
that Stanford rents to various industries.
Over the past year, chemical spills from com
panies in the research park have resulted in the
contamination of Matadero Creek. Residents fear
that private wells owned by residents and one
public well in the area are also at risk.
It is possible that between 30 and 2,000 families
would need to be evacuated in the case of an acci
dent at the research park, BPA literature states.
Chemicals found in various levels in the creek
since last November include trichloroethylene,
trichloroethane and polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs). PCBs, possible carcinogens, were most
recently found in Matadero Creek last summer

and were "the straw that broke the camel's back,"
Joynt said.
Joynt said he wants the symposium to educate
the "laymen" of the area on toxic waste and spills.
The symposium allows "technical people the
opportunity to give their views and expertise
from practical everyday things to technological
advancements" in the field of toxics, he said.
Joynt said a major focus will be on the health
risks involved with living in the Barron Park area.
The more than 600 groups invited to partici
pate in and attend the symposium include the
University, industries in Silicon Valley, the
Regional Water Quality Control Board and
tenants of the industrial park.
Joynt said he is disturlred that Stanford has yet
to take an active role in the problems of Barron
Park.
"One could only guess that Stanford is not too
interested in what goes on" and is taking the

"passive landlord role," he said. Paula Kakimoto,
a representative of Stanford's Real Estate and
Lands Management office, has represented Stan
ford at the symposium since it began.
Speakers include State Assemblyman Byron
Sher, Palo Alto Mayor Michael Cobb and Brent
Ventura, a candidate for the 22nd assembly dis
trict.
Joynt said the response has been very positive.
People are understanding for the first time that
action can be taken by the community for the
community, not just by lobbying groups, he said.
"It takes people by surprise," he said. " 'Gosh,
I've never thought about it that way,' they say."
People are very surprised residents were able
to "pull it off," Joynt said. The BPA had just under
three months to plan the symposium.
"We are following on something we felt was
right to do. It is in nobody's best interest to do
what we are doing except our own," Joynt said.
