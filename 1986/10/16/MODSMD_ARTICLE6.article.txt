# Reporter assails lying plan

### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Does the White House pass on to
the public all the facts of incidents
like the Soviet downing of Korean Air
Lines 007 j n September 1983, the U.S.
bombing of Libya or the recent
Daniloff affair?
Certainly not, said Seymour Hersh,
veteran journalist and Pulitzer Prize
winner, to a more-than-capacity
crowd at Kresge Auditorium List
night.
"We're getting close to im
peachable offenses when the White
House starts running a pocket war,
Hersh said, refei 1 ing to Washington s
"disinformation" campaigns of the
past few years.
Hersh's new book, "The Target is
Destroyed," is the result of a two-year
investigation into the circumstances
surrounding the 1983 incident in
which a Soviet fighter shot down a
Korean Air Lines (KAL) civilian jet
flying off course over die Soviet Un
ion's Sakhalin Island.
After the tragedy, President Reagan
accused the Soviet military of firing
on what it knew was a passenger
plane The Soviets countered his al
legation by insisting that the United

States had sent the plane on some
sort of spy mission.
"The intelligence information of
the situation does not support either
statement," Hersh said, adding that
Americans were not told all the fans
of the matter
KAL Flight 007 took off from
Anchorage, Alaska, bound for Seoul,
Korea. It left American radar range
about 200 miles into the journey It
then flew well off course and into So
viet air space where it was detected

and, after some ado, was shot down.
Just what happened from the time
the plane was picked up by Soviet
radar until it was fired upon is what
concerns Hersh
He contends that the Russian
fighter pilot committed a mammoth
blunder in failing to identify the jet
before hitting the trigger, contrary to
Secretary of State George Schultz
who stated, "The Russians knew the
plane was a passenger plane before
they shot it down, according to Hersh.

Schultz made the announcement
based on preliminary readings from
the National Security Agency despite
advice from NSA officials that initial
findings are often contradicted by
later developments and thus un
reliable, according to Hersh.
"The NSA people were outraged
that Schultz lied to the people," he
said.
Hersh continued on the disin-

formation theme by citing the recent
White House campaign to spread false
rumors of a second attack lx*ing con
sidered against Libyan leader Moam
mar Khadafi.

"It was disturbing that there was
only a very minimal amount of public
outcry over the incident.... What we
expect from our family, integrity and
honesty, we don't begin to expect from
our leaders," Hersh said. "The govern
ment has t;iken the notion of lying one
great step."
Hersh received the Pulitzer Prize for
his free-lance investigation of the My
Lai massacre in Vietnam. He has also

won the Ron Howard Public Service
Award, the George Polk Award for his
coverage of the secret U.S. bombings
in Cambodia and many other pres
tigious journalism prizes.

director of the Knight Fellowship pro
