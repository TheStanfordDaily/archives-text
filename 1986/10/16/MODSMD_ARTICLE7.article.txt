Beginning spring quarter of 1988,
Stanford's Overseas Studies Program
hopes to send students to Japan under
two programs currently being
negotiated with Japanese officials, ac
cording to the director of the overseas
program.
TTie University anticipates opening
the Japanese overseas campus at Kyoto
University.
According to Thomas Heller, profes
sor of law and director of Stanford's
Overseas Studies Program, the Kyoto
campus will offer courses in both tech
nical and non-technical fields.
"Most of the overseas programs
since their founding nearly 30 years
ago have been general studies pro
grams, concentrated in the humanities
and Euro-centered," Heller said. "Now
we will build on these strengths by de
signing programs with curricula that
are integrated with a wide range of
concentrations on the home campus,
including engineering, computer sci
ence, business and technology."
However, he stressed that "nothing
is signed yet." Heller said he hopes
that the universities will "enter into an
open agreement" by the end of No
vember.
"Our proposal has been jointly
prepared in close conjunction with
Kyoto University faculty and adminis
trators." said Heller. He added that the
programs "reflect the goals of Japanese
universities as well as Stanford and
other (American) universites."
Heller noted that the establishment

of these programs would help facilitate
"bilateral research in the technical and
social sciences."
The Stanford Center for Technology
and Innovation, which is to be estab
lished at the Kyoto campus, is geared
for students preparing for technical,
managerial, or government roles and
will be open to undergraduate as well
as graduate students. The center will
offer a six-month-long program focus
ing on technology and innovation and
their impact on advanced industrial
societies.
A second program, the Kyoto Pro
gram in Japanese Studies, is designed
primarily for undergraduates with a
strong background in Japanese lan
guage and culture and who are consid
ering academic careers as specialists
on Japan or whose professional
careers will require in-depth knowl
edge of Japan.
Classes will be organized around
such areas as language, history, art and
architecture. According to the pro
posal, Stanford will administer the
yearlong program for a consortium of
universities including Yale, Princeton
and Brown.
During the first three months of the
technology and innovation program,
students will attend classes taught in
English by Stanford and Kyoto profes
sors at Kyoto University Courses will
cover topics such as contemporary so
cial and economic organizations in
Japan, global political economy and
multinational management.
"It is important that our many stu
dents whose fields are in engineering,

science or business, and whose life
work will be in high-technology
processes and (who will be) involved
with governmental and private institu
tions have an opportunity to study in

Japan," said Heller. "We want to build a
core of technically trained students
able to operate in Japan with the same
ease that technically trained Japanese
students now operate [here]."
