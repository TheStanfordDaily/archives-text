Bombs explode at Wailing Wall
JERUSALEM — Attackers threw a pair of hand grenades yesterday near a
gate to the walled Old City near Judaism's sacred Wailing Wall, killing at
least one person and wounding more than 70 other civilians, soldiers and
tourists.
Both explosions occurred as about 300 recruits of an elite Israeli army
infantry unit were returning from a swearing-in ceremony at the Wailing
Wall.
The attack in predominantly Palestinian east Jerusalem represented the
most serious attack in the city in two years. Mayor Teddy Kollek called it "a
large-scale disaster."
Yehudit Israel, whose husband was wounded in the back by shrapnel,
said: "I saw white smoke. I ran out of the car without my shoes on. I heard
all sorts of noise. It was a terrible mess."
Ruth Meckel, a spokeswoman at Hadassah Hospital, said at least one per
son was killed and identified the victim as the father of a soldier. She said
the wounded included soldiers, civilians and tourists.
Police spokesman Rafi Levi said among the injured were children and
some Palestinians.
Levi said one charge exploded in a parking lot near the Dung Gate and
the other at a stairway nearby.
Yesterday's attack was the worst in Jerusalem since Feb. 28, 1984, when
21 people were wounded in a grenade attack on the main commercial
street.
Hasenfus cites CIA involvement
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — A top Sandinista official said yesterday that an
American captured in Nicaragua identified a man he claims is a CIA em
ployee in El Salvador as being involved in the 1976 bombing of a Cuban
airliner that killed 73 people.
Deputy Interior Minister Luis Carrion Cruz said Ramon Medina, identi
fied last week by the American, Eugene Hasenfus, as one of two Cuban-
American CIA employees working at Ilopango Military Base in San Sal
vador, actually was Luis Posada Carriles. Posada Carriles escaped last year
from a Venezuelan jail and has not been found.
Hasenfus, captured after Nicaraguan troops shot down a rebel supply
flight Oct. 5, said in a news conference last Thursday that Medina and Max
Gomez, both Cuban-Americans, worked for the CIA and coordinated flights
from Ilopango, El Salvador's military airport.
President Reagan and other U.S. officials have denied involvement of the
American government in the contra rebel supply flights, which would vio
late congressional restrictions.
Vietnam reports Chinese attack
BANGKOK, Thailand — Vietnam's official news agency reported yester
day that Chinese forces, backed by the heaviest shelling in months,
repeatedly attacked a Vietnamese village.
The agency said the Chinese were repulsed and that 90 intruders were
"wiped out."
The agency, monitored in Bangkok, said about 35,000 artillery and mor
tar rounds pounded a village in Vi Xuyen district of Ha Tuyen province
Tuesday and that Chinese troops attacked the village three times in the
early afternoon.
The claim could not be independently confirmed. Most Western
diplomats believe that while Vietnam and China occasionally clash along
their common border, both sides exaggerate the scale of the fighting.
The frontier has been tense since early 1979, when China launched a 17-
day, limited invasion of Vietnam because of Hanoi's invasion of Cambodia
and the ouster of the pro-Peking Khmer Rouge regime.
Soviet pullout insignificant
HINDAND, Afghanistan — Communist Party chief Najibullah threw
flower petals at about 1,500 members of a Soviet tank regiment who
clanked away in a dusty column yesterday on their long and well
publicized trip home.
The departure from a parched basin in this region near the Iranian fron
tier began the withdrawal of about 8,000 of the estimated 115,000 Soviet
soldiers who help the communist government fight Moslem guerrillas.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev promised the pullout in July, during a
speech in Vladivostok. Moscow has contended that Afghan government
forces are much stronger now than when it sent the first troops to Kabul in
December 1979.
Western diplomats in Afghanistan say the withdrawal is insignificant, a
gesture timed to ward off criticism during annual U.N. debate on the Af
ghan war later this year.
Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq and U.S. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger say they doubt whether the Soviets are reducing their
force in Afghanistan at all.
Last week in Peking, Weinberger termed the partial Soviet withdrawal "a
ruse" and said Moscow had actually sent new forces into Afghanistan. The
United States and Pakistan are the main supporters of the Moslem guerril
las fighting the Afghan government.
Poll: Americans support Reagan
WASHINGTON — More than 60 percent of Americans approve of Presi
dent Reagan's handling of relations with the Soviet Union, including his
stance at the Reykjavik summit, according to a Washington Post-ABC News
poll. But 49 percent also believe that he could do more to further nuclear
arms control.
The poll, conducted Tuesday, indicates that the failure of Reagan and So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to break the arms-control impasse will not
significantly affect the Nov. 4 congressional elections.
Of those polled, 78 percent said the summit would make no difference
in how they vote, while 10 percent said they were more likely to vote Dem
ocratic and 9 percent said the summit was likely to turn them toward the
Republican column.
Poll results were based on 768 interviews in different parts of the
country, and their accuracy is subject to a variation of 4 percentage points
in either direction.
The poll showed that 64 percent approved of Reagan's handling of the
summit, while 22 percent disapproved. Similarly, 55 percent backed his
decision not to accept limits on the Strategic Defense Initiative, with 16
percent dissenting and 27 percent saying they did not know enough about
the space-based missile defense to have an opinion.
Responses to other questions directly related to the summit showed that
53 percent believe that Gorbachev was more to blame for the failure to
reach an arms accord, while 16 percent said Reagan should be blamed.
The poll gave Reagan an approval rating of 62 percent for his overall
handling of U.S.-Soviet relations, and 74 percent said they believe that the
president seriously seeks progress in arms control. These figures were
relatively consistent with Reagan's ratings on the same questions in other
polls over the last year.
But the question of whether he has done as much as he should to limit
nuclear arms buildups caused a sharp division among respondents, with 49
percent saving he has not and 42 percent endorsing his accomplishments.
Other polls taken periodically since 1982 have reflected a similar division.
Any assessment of the new poll should recognize certain impon
derables.
One is that nationwide polls immediately after international crises or
tensions invariably tend to show solidarity with the president, at least ini
tially.
In addition, arms control involves scientific and technical issues that
many Americans do not understand.
Finally, the poll results may have been influenced by the administration'*
full-scale public-relations campaign, beginning wiui neagan> nationally
televised speech Monday night, aimed at countering impressions that the
summit had collapsed in failure and at blaming Gorbachev for the lack of
agreement.
