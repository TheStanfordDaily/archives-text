# Congress pushes to get home
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Less than three
weeks before Election Day, the House
and Senate rushed yesterday to ad
journ the 99th Congress as legislators
began whittling a stack of major
domestic measures to finance the gov
ernment, overhaul immigration laws
and combat illegal drug trafficking.
Both chambers were in the midst of
what promised to be a series of mara
thon sessions as congressional leaders
searched for compromises on sticky is
sues and pushed to wrap up legislative
business by today or tomorrow, two
weeks after the original adjournment
target of Oct. 3.
The biggest and most pressing item
on the agenda was a nearly $576 bil
lion, omnibus spending bill, the largest
evas considered by Congress, to meet
the funding needs of most government
operations and programs for the fiscal
year which began Oct. 1.

Since the beginning of the fiscal
year, the government has limped along
on a series of stopgap spending
measures, the most recent of which
was to expire at midnight last night.
Congressional negotiators settled on
the final version of the massive spend
ing bill yesterday morning, and action
by the full House was expected late
yesterday.
However, the Senate was not taking
up the measure before today, leaving
the government technically broke un
less another stopgap bill was put into
place.
The way for consideration of the
spending package was cleared Tuesday
night after bargainers settled on $291.8
billion worth of military spending, in
cluding agreements with the Reagan
administration on arms control issues.
During the day, Congress approved
that separate military spending author
ization, sending it to the White House.

The compromise measure falls far
short of the $320 billion the adminis
tration had requested but drops Dem
ocratic proposals that administration
officials said would hamper U.S.-Soviet
arms control efforts.
Although the conferees had finished
their work, battles on foreign aid and
several other provisions of the money
bill were expected in each chamber.
Also awaiting final congressional ac
tion was legislation to revise the na
tion's immigration laws and provide
amnesty for illegal aliens who entered
the country before 1982.
The House approved the compro
mise measure, which also includes
penalties for employers who hire il
legal aliens in the future, on a biparti
san 238-173 vote. But the legislation,
versions of which have died in each of
the previous two congresses, still
could become tied up by opponents in
the Senate.

The Senate, meanwhile, was set to
consider a compromise $1.7 billion
anti-drug measure to shore up federal
law enforcement, rehabilitation and
education efforts as well as provide aid
to local police.
The legislation, which has moved
swiftly through Congress, is a popular
election year issue.
But the measure also provides the
death penalty for drug-related mur
ders, raising objections from oppo
nents of capital punishment.
In an effort to head off a threatened
filibuster, congressional leaders were
discussing removing the death penalty
from the legislation and considering
that matter separately early next year.
Before Congress can adjourn, legis
lators also must consider legislation
that would increase the government's
borrowing authority, which is now
$2,111 trillion.
