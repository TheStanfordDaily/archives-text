TWO IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR
STANFORD STUDENTS IN THE HUMANITIES
For All Freshman, Sophomores, and Juniors
NEH YOUNGER SCHOLARS PROGRAM
The National Endowment for the Humanities invites applications for Younger
Scholars awards, a program for individuals to conduct research and writing projects in
the humanities during the summer of 1986. Award recipients will be expected to work
full-time for nine weeks during the summer, researching and writing a paper under the
close supervision of a humanities scholar. No academic credit should be sought for
these projects.
Applicants must be 21 years of age or under throughout the calendar year in
which the application is submitted; or, if they are over 21, they must be full-time
college students pursuing an undergraduate degree at the time of application.
Applicants must be U.S. citizens or foreign nationals who have lived in the United
States for at least three consecutive years at the time of application. Individuals who
will have received or expect to receive a bachelor's degree by October 1, 1986, are not
eligible to apply.
Projects must fall within one of the following three areas: The interpretation of
cultural works; the study of historical ideas, figures, and events; understanding the
disciplines of the humanities.
DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: NOVEMBER 1, 1985
For further information, write to:
Younger Scholars Guidelines, Room 426-AC. Division of General Programs
National Endowment for the Humanities, 1100 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20506
For All Seniors and Recent Graduates
Every year the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation offers 112 ellowships for graduate
study in the humanities to seniors and recent graduates of outstanding ability.
Mellon Fellowships are highly competitive, and carry an annual stipend of $8,500
plus tuition and fees. They are open to students in the traditional humanities
disciplines, including history, but not the creative and performing arts, or the social
sciences. American studies, other area studies, and interdisciplinary programs are
also eligible if the emphasis in subject and method is substantially humanistic.
The application procedure for Mellon Fellowships is complex and somewhat
time-consuming, since all candidates must first be nominated by a member of the
faculty. All those who think they might be interested in applying should plan to
attend a workshop to be held on Monday, October 7th, from 4 to 5 pm in History
Corner, Room 302 (the Faculty Conference Room).
