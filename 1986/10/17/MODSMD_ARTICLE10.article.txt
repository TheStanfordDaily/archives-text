# Senate passes spending bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday passed a
record $576 billion omnibus spending measure that
funds all government agencies in fiscal 1987 and pro
vides President Reagan with military aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels for the first time in nearly three
years.
The mammoth House-passed measure cleared the
Senate by voice vote, but it did not immediately go to
the president's desk because of a number of linger
ing, minor disputes between the two chambers — in
cluding a bitter, parochial battle over whether the
government should continue buying the T-46 trainer
plane, manufactured in Long Island, N.Y.
It was the biggest single spending measure in the
history of the country, amounting to more than the
U.S. government spent in all the years from 1789
through 1949. The 1,200-page, eight-inch thick bill
weighs more than 18 pounds and is designed to take
the place of all 13 separate funding bills that
Congress normally passes to fund individual
agencies
While it contains many items Reagan opposes, the
president is expected to sign the measure in large

part because it gives him the $100 million he has
long sought for the Nicaraguan rebels, known con
tras. It is the first military aid that Congress has ap
proved for the contras since learning in early 1984
that the CIA had mined a Nicaraguan harbor.
Opponents of contra aid made no effort to block
passage of the bill, even though many of them were
furious about the apparent involvement of Reagan
administration officials — including Vice President
George Bush — in a private effort to supply the con
tras. Instead, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered a
resolution requiring Reagan to report to Congress on
the extent of U.S. involvement in the effort, but it was
defeated by a 50-47 vote.
With the 99th Congress pressing toward adjourn
ment, Democrats said it was simply too late to revive
the battle over contra aid. The issue of U.S. involve
ment did not come to light until last week, when the
Nicaraguans shot down a contra supply plane and
captured an American survivor, Eugene Hasenfus,
who announced that he was working for the CIA.
The spending bill authorizes the CIA to run the
contra-aid program, which also has been prohibited

by Congress since 1984.
Although lawmakers joked about the size and
weight of the omnibus spending bill, many saw it as a
symbol of their failure to control costs and reduce
the federal deficit.
Since fiscal 1987 began Oct. 1, Congress has
passed four stopgap spending bills while trying to
complete work on the long-term measure. The last of
those measures was to expire at 12:01 a.m. today,
leaving the government technically unfunded there
after.
At the same time, the lawmakers claimed to be
making some modest progress in the battle of the
budget. Sen. Pete Domenici, (R-N.M.) chairman of
the Senate Budget Committee, released a study
showing that total federal spending as adjusted for in-,
flation would be cut 2.3 percent between fiscal 1986
and 1987 — the largest drop since 1955 — under the
terms of this bill. But the reduction could be
eliminated if, as expected, Congress passes supple
mental spending measures next year, or if economic
conditions change.
