JERUSALEM — A dozen Israeli
warplanes attacked suspected Palestin
ian guerrilla bases yesterday near
Sidon, Lebanon, and one plane was
shot down with a Soviet-made missile.
Four persons were reported killed and
10 injured in the raid.
The raid appeared to be in retalia
tion for a hand-grenade attack in
Jerusalem Wednesday night in which
one person was killed and 70 others
were wounded.
Western news agencies reporting
from Sidon said that ambulances and
fire engines were sent to the scene
after Israeli jets made repeated bomb
ing and rocketing runs around the
Miye ou Miye Palestinian refugee camp
southeast of Sidon. The camp is
thought to be a stronghold of support
ers of Yasser Arafat, the chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organization,
which early yesterday claimed respon-

sibility for the grenade attack in
Jerusalem.
The Israeli military command con
firmed that its warplanes had struck in
South Lebanon, but a spokesman
refused to comment on reports that
one of its Phantom F-4s was downed by
a Soviet-made SAM-7 missile.
If confirmed, it would be the first Is
raeli fighter shot down over Lebanon
since 1983-
Unofficial sources said the plane's
pilot and co-pilot ejected before the
aircraft exploded and crashed in the
hills southeast of Sidon. The two
reportedly parachuted to the ground
and were captured by Lebanese
militiamen. However, a local com
mander of Amal, the Shia Moslem
militia, in Sidon, reported that one
pilot was killed.
An independent security source said
the Israeli crew members were being
held by the relatively moderate Amal

militia rather than by Palestinians or
members of the more radical Hezbol
lah (Party of God) Shia group.
The source said that Israeli fighters
and helicopters were still active over
the area yesterday evening.
Witnesses said three formations of
four jets each flew in for bomb and
rocket runs starting at 3:50 p.m. They
said the planes conducting the raid had
released balloons to deflect the Soviet
made, heat-seeking missiles, but that
Palestinian fighters firing rockets from
shoulder-held launchers managed to
hit one of the aircraft.
Yesterday's raid was the 13th Israeli
air strike on targets in southern
Lebanon this year, and as one indepen
dent security source noted: "You do
(that many) attacks in a year, and one
day somebody's going to get lucky."
The raid came less than 24 hours
after unidentified assailants tossed at
least two hand grenades into a crowd

of Israeli soldiers and well-wishers
who had just attended an induction
ceremony at Judaism's holiest site.
The father of one recruit was killed,
in the blasts, and 34 other victims
remained hospitalized with their injur-!
ies. One of the wounded was said to be
in critical condition;
The attack occurred as members of
the sth Platoon of the Givati Infantry
Brigade returned to their buses after a;
swearing-in ceremony at the Western •
Wall of the Second Temple, the only!
remnant of the complex destroyed by;
the Romans in A.D. 70. The place, often
called the Wailing Wall, is revered by i
Jews as a place of prayer and ■
pilgrimmage and is often used for Is-!
raeli military ceremonies.
Of the attack's 70 victims, 42 were >
soldiers. Israeli security sources said!
the attackers used Soviet-made frag-'
mentation grenades.
