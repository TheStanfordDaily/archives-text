## Trivia 101 
### 
Let s go on to question three," says one
freshman. Who read Cervantes?"
No response.
0.K., we can t do question three without
Cervantes. Let's skip to question eight. Who
read Machiavelli?"
It's almost 2:30 a.m. The Great Works of
Western Culture final is six hours away. Six
freshmen sit around a Flo Mo lounge cram
ming furiously.
Eight exam questions have been handed out
in advance. Four of the eight questions will ap
pear on the actual in-class exam. Students will
have to answer two of the four.
'I read Machiavelli," boasts one student. "I
even took notes."
"Who read More?"
"I read More."
"Who read Shakespeare?"
"Oh, c'mon, everyone had 'King Lear' in
high school."
"I didn't," says one. "I need stuff on King
Lear.'"
"Here," says another, tossing "Lear" Cliffs
Notes across the room.
"We've done questions one, two, five and
six. Let's just do question eight and we'll be
set."
"No way, we need six questions. Figure it
out."
"I'm sure they're gonna pick the even ques
tions."
"I'm through studying. I don't even care if I
blow it. When we applied to colleges, nobody
cared about our freshman grades from high
school. When we apply to grad school,
nobody's gonna care about our freshman
grades here."

"Does anybody remember what a cenobitic
monk is?"
Five things the task force established to
study the Western Culture program should
know:
First, the program needs revamping regard
less of whether reviewers deem it elitist. In its
current form, the survey course provides little
more than an impressive bookshelf and tidbits
of trivia for cocktail-party conversation.
Second, few students read all the assigned
works of literature and philosophy, and
nobody reads the history texts that accompany
many of the Western Culture tracks, except, of
course, a few of the students in History 1-2-3-
Third, the call to expand the program to
"World Culture" is just plain silly if the core
hopes to cover the entire "Big Bang to Debbie
Does Dallas" time period. Sprinkling the syl
labi with selected readings from Asia, Africa
and Latin America will only dilute the core
even more.
Fourth, supporters of the Western Culture
requirement at Stanford are not by definition
racist. The fund of knowledge that includes
classical and Judeo-Christian heritage, Western
literature and philosophy, European history
and the politics of Western societies is still a
prerequisite to understanding American poli
tical structure and society.
Fifth, the critics and supporters can argue all
they like, but now that the issue has been
relegated to task force study, all arguments are
moot. The last major task force to tackle a
heated student issue — the future of housed
fraternities — still hasn't released its report,
two-and-a-half years after it finished its study.
