## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Honor Yom Kippur 
### 
Monday was Yom Kippur, the highest holy day in the
Jewish religious calendar. At Stanford, however, classes
were held, problem sets were due and office staff re
ported to work as usual. This situation has exposed what
is nothing less than a lack of respect on the part of the
University for the most important day on the Jewish
calendar.
Judaism's day of atonement, Yom Kippur is observed
by every practicing Jew in the world. Like the rest of the
United States, Stanford has a substantial Jewish popula
tion — a population that is required by its religion to
fast, attend temple and pray on its highest holy day.
Unfortunately for Stanford's Jewish students, a serious
conflict arises every year between attending classes and
observing Yom Kippur. The number of students who
have to miss classes on Yom Kippur is unquestionably
high. Not only are the students themselves at a dis
advantage, but professors either must plan make-up sec
tions for Jewish students or cancel class altogether.

Many professors do cancel class, either to observe
Yom Kippur or out of respect for the holy day. It is tacitly
unfair to students whose professors don't happen to be
Jewish to have to attend class while their friends get the
day off by the opposite circumstance.
University officials rationalize that if Stanford were to
declare every major holiday of every major religion a day
off, school would never be in session. This reasoning is
specious at best. The Jewish population on the Farm —
both in the classrooms and the offices — is high enough
to warrant official University recognition of Yom Kippur.
And although the University's official policy allows
people to take time off for Yom Kippur, that time must
be deducted from sick or personal leave allowances.
The University can no longer ignore a policy that af
fects every student and faculty-member on campus.
Making Yom Kippur a holiday would eliminate conflicts
for students and faculty and show the same respect for
the Jewish religion that Christians receive every
Christmas.
