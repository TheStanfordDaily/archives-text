Drug eradication
has policy limits
John McDonnell's viewpoint on
supply-side versus demand-side
responses to the U.S. drug problem
(Daily, Oct. 8) briefly touched on a
few points that have been acknowl
edged all too rarely in this debate.
That an anti-drug strategy concentrat
ing on the production of drugs cannot
work was McDonnell's main point.
Just as true, and perhaps more signifi
cant for policy-makers, is the fact that
such efforts often conflict with impor
tant U.S. foreign policy objectives.
Paramount among these are easing
the debt crisis and supporting friendly
governments in the face of communist
insurgency and/or anti-American
opposition.
In and of themselves, interdiction
and eradication programs are
desirable. But policy-makers should
not lose sight of the severe constraints
— political and economic the
ieaders of producer countries face.
Substantial direct and indirect em
ployment benefits arising from the
drug trade lead to powerful local
constituencies — meaning economic
survival to hundreds of thousands of
peasants.
Politically, of the Western Hemi
sphere's five major producers —
Bolivia, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico
and Peru — all except Mexico have
strong internal oppositions, ready to
challenge their none-too-stable gov
ernments on questions of economic
displacement and the always volatile
sovereignty issue. Some face armed
insurgencies as well (Colombia, Peru,
Bolivia). The link between drugs and
revolution comes not only from the
fabled "narcoterrorism." Revolution
ary groups also capitalize on and gain
strength from U.S.-imposed eradica
tion programs. The most obvious
example to date occurred in Peru in
1984. A U.S.-funded program was
attempting to wipe out coca produc
tion in the Huallaga Valley, under
standably miffing the thousands of
peasants who survived on the trade.
Sendero Luminoso guerrillas moved
into the area, recruited 2,000 peasants
as new rebels and promptly began
attacking police headquarters and

other government entities. When the
Peruvian army moved in, its first
action was to halt the anti-narcotics
effort.
Whether any eradication plan could
work (given the incentives that mil
lions of U.S. citizens place on produc
tion) is an open question. What seems
somewhat more clear is that in such
countries as Bolivia and even Jamaica,
pushing governments to do what we
want might well result in the election
of a leftist government or the fall of a
democracy.

I actually believe all that
commencement-day hot air about the
importance of education. To have
educated citizens and institutions of
higher education is critical to a free
and healthy society. I feel that I have a
responsibility to ensure that such
education continues to be avilable,
and contributions are one way to
meet that responsibility.
With this responsibility in mind,
however, I found a recent message in
the Stanford magazine to be rather
offensive. The message is in the fall
issue, page 120, and is by William
Chace, Vice-Provost for Academic
Planning and Development.
In this letter Mr. Chace discusses
the soon-to-begin Centennial cam
paign. Mr. Chace describes the cam
paign as "the largest private educa
tional fund-raising effort in this
country's history." This grandiose
description sets the tone of academic
machismo and chest-pounding that
permeates the message. The cam
paign, we are told, is "needed to
sustain its (Stanford's) influence and
primacy," to "firmly establish the
University as an indisputable leader in
the nation" and to make Stanford
"more powerful."
The goal of the campaign is, quite
simply, to win. We are encouraged to
contribute to the campaign — but not
because we believe in the importance
of a university as a center of research
and learning. We are to give so that
Stanford may someday become the

wealthiest and most important univer
sity this side of the Mississippi.
So much for my contribution to
Stanford. While this view fits right in
with a corporate announcement of a
new product or acquisition, I couldn't
care less whether Stanford is number
one or number 10 in the endless,
absurd rankings that are attempted.
What I would like to see is a commit
ment to fulfilling a very simple mis
sion: Provide the highest quality edu
cation to as many qualified students as
possible. There is no hint of such a
mission associated with the Centen
nial campaign.
Stanford is already one of the rich
est educational institutions in the
world and seems to be seeking more
contributions in some sort of quest
for glory. I have no interest in this
quest. Personally, I feel my money will
go to much better use at an institution
(probably with a much smaller en
dowment) which talks about provid
ing quality education rather than
achieving a position of power and
dominance.

I am such a precarious believer that
it embarrasses me to call myself a
Christian, but it was with deep
gratification and relief that I heard
Tom Ambrogi preach in the Stanford
Church last Sunday. His sermon
brought to mind the great preaching
of Davie Napier and Robert McAfee
Brown, men who used to stir this
campus to its roots and who felt that
Christianity had something to do with
moral action and was not defined by
gestures of unctuous piety. President
Kennedy is to be commended for
bringing Tom Ambrogi here — if only
for a trial run. The act suggests that
Stanford has gotten over its fear that
the campus church — after roughly a
15-year hibernation — might come to
life and again and make some waves.
If Tom Ambrogi sticks around, I might
become less embarrassed to call
myself a Christian.

Centennial drive
centers on power
I actually believe all that
commencement-day hot air about the
importance of education. To have
educated citizens and institutions of
higher education is critical to a free
and healthy society. I feel that I have a
responsibility to ensure that such
education continues to be avilable,
and contributions are one way to
meet that responsibility.
With this responsibility in mind,
however, I found a recent message in
the Stanford magazine to be rather
offensive. The message is in the fall
issue, page 120, and is by William
Chace, Vice-Provost for Academic
Planning and Development.
In this letter Mr. Chace discusses
the soon-to-begin Centennial cam
paign. Mr. Chace describes the cam
paign as "the largest private educa
tional fund-raising effort in this
country's history." This grandiose
description sets the tone of academic
machismo and chest-pounding that
permeates the message. The cam
paign, we are told, is "needed to
sustain its (Stanford's) influence and
primacy," to "firmly establish the
University as an indisputable leader in
the nation" and to make Stanford
"more powerful."
The goal of the campaign is, quite
simply, to win. We are encouraged to
contribute to the campaign — but not
because we believe in the importance
of a university as a center of research
and learning. We are to give so that
Stanford may someday become the

wealthiest and most important univer
sity this side of the Mississippi.
So much for my contribution to
Stanford. While this view fits right in
with a corporate announcement of a
new product or acquisition, I couldn't
care less whether Stanford is number
one or number 10 in the endless,
absurd rankings that are attempted.
What I would like to see is a commit
ment to fulfilling a very simple mis
sion: Provide the highest quality edu
cation to as many qualified students as
possible. There is no hint of such a
mission associated with the Centen
nial campaign.
Stanford is already one of the rich
est educational institutions in the
world and seems to be seeking more
contributions in some sort of quest
for glory. I have no interest in this
quest. Personally, I feel my money will
go to much better use at an institution
(probably with a much smaller en
dowment) which talks about provid
ing quality education rather than
achieving a position of power and
dominance.

I am such a precarious believer that
it embarrasses me to call myself a
Christian, but it was with deep
gratification and relief that I heard
Tom Ambrogi preach in the Stanford
Church last Sunday. His sermon
brought to mind the great preaching
of Davie Napier and Robert McAfee
Brown, men who used to stir this
campus to its roots and who felt that
Christianity had something to do with
moral action and was not defined by
gestures of unctuous piety. President
Kennedy is to be commended for
bringing Tom Ambrogi here — if only
for a trial run. The act suggests that
Stanford has gotten over its fear that
the campus church — after roughly a
15-year hibernation — might come to
life and again and make some waves.
If Tom Ambrogi sticks around, I might
become less embarrassed to call
myself a Christian.

Drug eradication
has policy limits
John McDonnell's viewpoint on
supply-side versus demand-side
responses to the U.S. drug problem
(Daily, Oct. 8) briefly touched on a
few points that have been acknowl
edged all too rarely in this debate.
That an anti-drug strategy concentrat
ing on the production of drugs cannot
work was McDonnell's main point.
Just as true, and perhaps more signifi
cant for policy-makers, is the fact that
such efforts often conflict with impor
tant U.S. foreign policy objectives.
Paramount among these are easing
the debt crisis and supporting friendly
governments in the face of communist
insurgency and/or anti-American
opposition.
In and of themselves, interdiction
and eradication programs are
desirable. But policy-makers should
not lose sight of the severe constraints
— political and economic the
ieaders of producer countries face.
Substantial direct and indirect em
ployment benefits arising from the
drug trade lead to powerful local
constituencies — meaning economic
survival to hundreds of thousands of
peasants.
Politically, of the Western Hemi
sphere's five major producers —
Bolivia, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico
and Peru — all except Mexico have
strong internal oppositions, ready to
challenge their none-too-stable gov
ernments on questions of economic
displacement and the always volatile
sovereignty issue. Some face armed
insurgencies as well (Colombia, Peru,
Bolivia). The link between drugs and
revolution comes not only from the
fabled "narcoterrorism." Revolution
ary groups also capitalize on and gain
strength from U.S.-imposed eradica
tion programs. The most obvious
example to date occurred in Peru in
1984. A U.S.-funded program was
attempting to wipe out coca produc
tion in the Huallaga Valley, under
standably miffing the thousands of
peasants who survived on the trade.
Sendero Luminoso guerrillas moved
into the area, recruited 2,000 peasants
as new rebels and promptly began
attacking police headquarters and

other government entities. When the
Peruvian army moved in, its first
action was to halt the anti-narcotics
effort.
Whether any eradication plan could
work (given the incentives that mil
lions of U.S. citizens place on produc
tion) is an open question. What seems
somewhat more clear is that in such
countries as Bolivia and even Jamaica,
pushing governments to do what we
want might well result in the election
of a leftist government or the fall of a
democracy.
