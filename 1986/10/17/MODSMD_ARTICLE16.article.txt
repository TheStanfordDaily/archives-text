# Reagan is unable to stop WW III
## 
### 
For months, the newspapers warned us to expect
very little from the Reagan-Gorbachev summit; but
now that the sham is over, we are supposed to be
surprised that Reagan's insistence on deploying
space weapons has destroyed arms control. For some
time, Reagan has insisted that the very weapons sys
tems justified on grounds of being "bargaining
chips'* are under no circumstances to be bargained
away. For years, Reagan has manipulated us with the

line that his "hands would be tied" in negotiations if
any substantive arms control measures were passed
by Congress. Over and over, Congress has
funded major new weapon systems in return for
vague promises of "serious" negotiations from an ad
ministration that does not believe in arms control.
When will we learn?
Let us look at a little strategic history. During
Reagan's election, the Republican platform called for
nuclear "superiority" over the Soviet Union. A few
years later there were massive world-wide
demons*; ations against American ideas of
"winnable" and "limited" nuclear war. Phony
charges of Soviet arms control treaty violations were
advanced, together with the Cold War idea that the
Soviets are the "focus of evil in the modern world."
Now being deployed are American weapons capable
of carrying out a pre-emptive nuclear first strike
against the Soviet Union, the means to make the
Soviets "blink" when the U.S. wants to intervene to
prop up one of its dictators around the world. The
planned "Star Wars" weapon system, in spite of the
rhetoric about its being a defensive program, would
be a backup to American attack threats, mopping up
the ragged Soviet retaliation after an American first

strike. The protective armor on a tank does not make
it a defensive weapon! The doctrines and the weap
ons for waging nuclear war are being put in place.
How many times must our government take on
patently unfair negotiating positions (e.g., agreeing
to talk about missile limitation in "exchange" for not
deploying U.S. space weaponry until it is developed)?
How many times must workable Soviet suggestions
(nuclear testing moratorium) be immediately dis
missed by the government and the press as mere
propaganda? How many first strike nuclear weapon
systems (MX, Pershing, Trident II) must be deployed?
In short, how many times must the government
"dash hopes for arms control," as newspapers are
putting it, before we realize that we cannot rely on
the governments to prevent World War 111, that we
must do it ourselves?

On Monday, there will been opportunity to do just
that: People from around the region will converge
on Lockheed in Sunnyvale, the largest "Star Wars"
contractor in the area and the builder of the Trident
II missile. For a day, the nuclear war preparations at
Lockheed will 1* shut down; traffic entering the plant
will be blocked. Stanford students, concerned with
Stanford's own role in the development of "Star
Wars" weapons, will be participating. Now that it's
become very clear that the government will not take
action to prevent nuclear war, I urge you to take ac
tion on Monday morning.
