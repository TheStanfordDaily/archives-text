# Apartheid requires action
## 
### 
Victor Vescovo argues in his viewpoint (Daily, Oct. 15)
first that moral wrongs of a greater magnitude than those
occurring in South Africa are being committed in other
parts of the world, and that, therefore, obsessive student
concern with South Africa is misplaced (or at least question
able). Second, he argues that, given our concern for the
apartheid issue, the divestment route isn't the most efficient
way to effect change. I want to reply to Vescovo's first argu
ment because it continues to boil up now and then, muddy
ing the waters of the apartheid debate. Of course the second
argument occurs even more often than the first, but unlike
the first, it doesn't admit of a straightforward answer, and so
I will leave that debate to those more versed in the issue.
Vescovo asks two questions, the second being subor
dinate to the first: 1. Why South Africa? and 2. Given South
Africa, why the route of divestment? He argues that the
oppression that takes place in the communist world far sur-

BILL BRISTOW

passes that which we find in South Africa. He thereby
implies that there is no good answer to the first question
above, and that, if we were really morally concerned stu
dents, we would direct our moral indignation against the
worst oppressors — I suppose that means communists —
rather than against the South African regime.
The obvious implicit premise is, I think, simply wrong.
Notice first that this claim is not even remotely true of how
our moral intuitions actually work. If your younger brother
or sister becomes involved in activities that you consider
morally questionable, you will view that situation with ipucn*
greater concern than the situation in which your
cousin — who lives on the opposite coast and whom you
haven't seen since you were three — is involved in bona
fide felonious activity. It is simply a fact that one feels more
responsibility toward those to whom one is closer than
toward those further removed. Moral responsibility, like
charity, begins at home.
Vescovo could grant us this factual claim about how
moral intuitions actually work and still argue that they ought
to be more impartial. Passing over the questionable origin
of this "ought," I think reflection will quickly show that not
only doesn't the world work this way, but we wouldn't want
it to. Consider the man who, obsessed by the moral situa
tion of world hunger, keeps two unknown Ethiopian
children alive by starving one of his own. A paragon of
morality? No, a monster. Other less extreme examples
could be produced, but I think most people will accept the
claim that we are justified in having a more intense moral
concern with the situations nearer to us. It's difficult to con
ceive of morality working in any other way.
The example in the previous paragraph is actually weaker
than it might have been because it ignores the point that, in
the general case, the closer the moral wrong, the more in
fluence one has in correcting it, and so if one abandons con
cern for a closer moral wrong of lesser magnitude for a
more distant moral wrong of greater magnitude, one is
likely to end up accomplishing nothing rather than a iittle
something. This is certainly the case with respect to the
issue at hand. Suppose we dropped the apartheid issue and
all became rabid anti-communists. We could stage a rally in
White Plaza and shout "Down with Gorbachev!" What
earthly good would it do? Of course, people ask the same

question concerning divestment rallies, but at least in that
case there is room for debate. We might have influence in
ending apartheid (which Vescovo implicitly admits by ar
guing that we should invest more, rather than divest),!
whereas students have next to no influence in ending;
atrocities in the Soviet-Afghanistan war.
To this can be added the related point that our govern-!
ment is already in an adversarial relationship with the;
countries committing the atrocities in Afghanistan and Ethi
opia. However, we are in a symbiotic relationship with the!
country responsible for apartheid. Therein lies the urgency
of our moral dilemma.
Of course, my argument assumes that, in some vague, un-;
defined sense, we are "closer" to the moral wrongs of apart-'
heid than to those others which Vescovo mentions. It is an!
assumption of his argument that those moral wrongs are ofj
a greater magnitude. Although I grant him this claim for
purposes of argument, it is not a trivial assumption, since!
there is no clear yardstick for measuring the magnitude of a;
moral wrong. Apartheid is morally repugnant, and I doubt it
takes an "easy" second to any other. My assumption finds"
some support in the preceding paragraph, and I could sup-!
port it further, but I don't think that is necessary for the fol-|
lowing reason. Vescovo accuses anti-apartheid
demonstrators of seeing the world in terms of black and!
white, but it is characteristic of those holding his position

It is characteristic of those
™&&kime4his position that they
see the world according to a
color spectrum, too, only
different colors: red and
non-red.

that they see the world according to a color spectrum too, j
only different colors: red and non-red. Therefore, even if we *
let Vescovo himself draw the family relationships between J
nations, South Africa will belong to our family, and the So-»
viet Union and Ethiopia will not. However, even if we reject *
the red criterion, I take it that any of the more plausible J
criteria that might be adduced will show a closer relation-1
ship between us (as citizens of this country or as students of * t
this university) and South Africa than between us and the 112
other countries he named, even the non-communist ones«
thrown in as an afterthought. There will be individual ex-1
ceptions of course (i.e., an overseas student from Ethiopia), *
but we are concerned here with collective action. 4
I have tried to eliminate Vescovo's doubt on the first J
question: Why South Africa? That leaves untouched half of«
his article, namely the part concerning his second question.'
Given South Africa, why the divestment route? I hope'
debate will be concentrated on this more complex question *
in the future.

only doesn't the world work this way, but we wouldn't want
it to. Consider the man who, obsessed by the moral situa
tion of world hunger, keeps two unknown Ethiopian
children alive by starving one of his own. A paragon of
morality? No, a monster. Other less extreme examples
could be produced, but I think most people will accept the
claim that we are justified in having a more intense moral
concern with the situations nearer to us. It's difficult to con
ceive of morality working in any other way.
The example in the previous paragraph is actually weaker
than it might have been because it ignores the point that, in
the general case, the closer the moral wrong, the more in
fluence one has in correcting it, and so if one abandons con
cern for a closer moral wrong of lesser magnitude for a
more distant moral wrong of greater magnitude, one is
likely to end up accomplishing nothing rather than a iittle
something. This is certainly the case with respect to the
issue at hand. Suppose we dropped the apartheid issue and
all became rabid anti-communists. We could stage a rally in
White Plaza and shout "Down with Gorbachev!" What
earthly good would it do? Of course, people ask the same

question concerning divestment rallies, but at least in that
case there is room for debate. We might have influence in
ending apartheid (which Vescovo implicitly admits by ar
guing that we should invest more, rather than divest),!
whereas students have next to no influence in ending;
atrocities in the Soviet-Afghanistan war.
To this can be added the related point that our govern-!
ment is already in an adversarial relationship with the;
countries committing the atrocities in Afghanistan and Ethi
opia. However, we are in a symbiotic relationship with the!
country responsible for apartheid. Therein lies the urgency
of our moral dilemma.
Of course, my argument assumes that, in some vague, un-;
defined sense, we are "closer" to the moral wrongs of apart-'
heid than to those others which Vescovo mentions. It is an!
assumption of his argument that those moral wrongs are ofj
a greater magnitude. Although I grant him this claim for
purposes of argument, it is not a trivial assumption, since!
there is no clear yardstick for measuring the magnitude of a;
moral wrong. Apartheid is morally repugnant, and I doubt it
takes an "easy" second to any other. My assumption finds"
some support in the preceding paragraph, and I could sup-!
port it further, but I don't think that is necessary for the fol-|
lowing reason. Vescovo accuses anti-apartheid
demonstrators of seeing the world in terms of black and!
white, but it is characteristic of those holding his position

It is characteristic of those
™&&kime4his position that they
see the world according to a
color spectrum, too, only
different colors: red and
non-red.

that they see the world according to a color spectrum too, j
only different colors: red and non-red. Therefore, even if we *
let Vescovo himself draw the family relationships between J
nations, South Africa will belong to our family, and the So-»
viet Union and Ethiopia will not. However, even if we reject *
the red criterion, I take it that any of the more plausible J
criteria that might be adduced will show a closer relation-1
ship between us (as citizens of this country or as students of * t
this university) and South Africa than between us and the 112
other countries he named, even the non-communist ones«
thrown in as an afterthought. There will be individual ex-1
ceptions of course (i.e., an overseas student from Ethiopia), *
but we are concerned here with collective action. 4
I have tried to eliminate Vescovo's doubt on the first J
question: Why South Africa? That leaves untouched half of«
his article, namely the part concerning his second question.'
Given South Africa, why the divestment route? I hope'
debate will be concentrated on this more complex question *
in the future.

Bill Bristow is a senior in philosophy and religious studies. *
Victor Vescovo argues in his viewpoint (Daily, Oct. 15)
first that moral wrongs of a greater magnitude than those
occurring in South Africa are being committed in other
parts of the world, and that, therefore, obsessive student
concern with South Africa is misplaced (or at least question
able). Second, he argues that, given our concern for the
apartheid issue, the divestment route isn't the most efficient
way to effect change. I want to reply to Vescovo's first argu
ment because it continues to boil up now and then, muddy
ing the waters of the apartheid debate. Of course the second
argument occurs even more often than the first, but unlike
the first, it doesn't admit of a straightforward answer, and so
I will leave that debate to those more versed in the issue.
Vescovo asks two questions, the second being subor
dinate to the first: 1. Why South Africa? and 2. Given South
Africa, why the route of divestment? He argues that the
oppression that takes place in the communist world far sur-

BILL BRISTOW

passes that which we find in South Africa. He thereby
implies that there is no good answer to the first question
above, and that, if we were really morally concerned stu
dents, we would direct our moral indignation against the
worst oppressors — I suppose that means communists —
rather than against the South African regime.
The obvious implicit premise is, I think, simply wrong.
Notice first that this claim is not even remotely true of how
our moral intuitions actually work. If your younger brother
or sister becomes involved in activities that you consider
morally questionable, you will view that situation with ipucn*
greater concern than the situation in which your
cousin — who lives on the opposite coast and whom you
haven't seen since you were three — is involved in bona
fide felonious activity. It is simply a fact that one feels more
responsibility toward those to whom one is closer than
toward those further removed. Moral responsibility, like
charity, begins at home.
Vescovo could grant us this factual claim about how
moral intuitions actually work and still argue that they ought
to be more impartial. Passing over the questionable origin
of this "ought," I think reflection will quickly show that not
only doesn't the world work this way, but we wouldn't want
it to. Consider the man who, obsessed by the moral situa
tion of world hunger, keeps two unknown Ethiopian
