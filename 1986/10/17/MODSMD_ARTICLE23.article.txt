"The only requirement is that you have to be will
ing to get wet."
So says senior Ann Leininger, the Delta Gamma
(DG) president, about the upcoming DG Anchor
Splash.
The Anchor Splash is a wet-and-wild excursion
into fun, consisting of a series of relays, synchronized
swimming and a male beauty pageant. The event will
take place at 1 p.m. Sunday in DeGuerre pool.
Junior Sylvia Castro, the organizer of the Anchor
Splash, says the water follies will be judged quite
seriously. "The teams have to have some form, some
style; they have to look like they know what they're
doing even if they don't," she said.
There are seven eight-member teams signed up
for the contest. These teams are coming from houses
as diverse as Kappa Sigma and Hurlburt. Also com
peting will be Delta Kappa Epsilon, Schiff, the French
House, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Grove House.
The judges will be members of the Delta Gamma
sorority. They will supervise the beauty contest, the
synchro swimming event and the sweatshirt, ping

pong and raft relays that will make up the Anchor
Splash.
The entry fee of $25 charged to each team will be
divided between the DG national charity, Sight Con
servation and Aid to the Blind and the Peninsula
Center for the Blind.
Spectators are welcome, as are hecklers and

There is much incentive for success in this watery
competition. Prize packages for the best and worst
teams as well as a prize for the Mr. Anchor Splash
winner will be presented at the end of the contests.
The prize packages will be made up of donations
received from such illustrious donors as the Hard
Rock Cafe in San Francisco, Blatz Ice Cream and the
Dutch Goose.
Any former water polo players deciding to enter as

ringers and take the. prize should be forewarned.
These events are not normal 400- or 800-meter
Olympic-style relays.

For example, the sweatshirt relay requires that
each participant put on a DG sweatshirt, swim across
the pool, remove the shirt and give it to the next
