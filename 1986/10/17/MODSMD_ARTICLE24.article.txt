# Sophs join family at Otero House

### JILL HURLEY 
Residential education at Stanford
is not what it used to be.
Although this may seem obvious,
the trends in housing, particularly
in Wilbur Hall, have changed signif
icantly in the past year.
One sign of this change is the
Wilbur Curriculum Project, which
has brought dorm-based Western
Culture discussion sections to many
of the Wilbur houses, including
Madera, Rinconada and Otero.
Another program, lesser-known,
was the brainchild of Otero House
Resident Fellow Dennis Matthies.
He described it as "the sprinkling of
a few spirited sophomores in a
primarily all-freshman dorm."

So, for the first year in its history,
Otero House, traditionally all
freshman, has sophomores among
its residents.
Matthies explained that the idea
arose in part from suggestions that
a group of Oterans proposed a
couple of years ago. But it was not
until this year that he was actually
able to put the ideas into motion.
At the end of spring quarter last
year, Matthies asked for volunteers
from his current residents to return
to Otero in the fall. Six former
Oterans responded.
Matthies said he hopes the soph
omores will add to the unity in
Otero by encouraging the frosh to
take part in both dorm and campus activities.
"I really think they can be catalysts for the freshman," he
said. "The enthusiasm they've stirred up so far has been
contagious."
Another advantage in having several sophomores
mingled in with freshmen is that the sophomores already
know a lot about the campus and can perhaps help answer
questions when the dorm's resident assistants are un
available, Matthies said.
Otero RA Braden Penhoet, a senior, supports this idea
wholeheartedly.
"It's been great, because they (the sophomores) have
helped us out so much, especially during orientation week.
They sped things up a lot for us so that we had more time to
meet the frosh."
There are only nine sophomores in Otero. Matthies
theorized that having just a few non-freshmen in the dorm,
rather than a more equal percentage, will sustain the fun
and newness of an all-freshman atmosphere.
In turn, the closeness of a freshman dorm gives the soph
omores the chance to feel useful and to feel they are a big
ger part of the residential community, according to Otero
sophomore Jane Swiatek.
"We don't have sophomore slump," she said. "I haven't
felt a letdown from last year."
"I liked the atmosphere of Otero, and the energy level is
much higher here than in other dorms," said Scott Sealey,
another sophomore.

Currently, the "sprinkling of the sophs" is experimental,
with no defined rules.
"We didn't want the sophomores to be leaders," said
Matthies. "Mainly, they were intended to be facilitators for
the frosh."
Swiatek explained further: "We don't have a definite role;
it's just whatever we make of it.
However, each of the nine sophomores initially had a
specific role. The six former Oterans began as either orien
tation volunteers or advising associates. Other than that,
they carry no responsibility; they need only find their niche
in the dorm.
The remaining three sophomores were recruited from
Roble as writing tutors.
On the whole, Otero freshmen are enjoying their sopho
more dormmates, residents said. But Jenny Erickson voiced
an opinion shared by many of her fellow freshmen in the
dorm.
"I think it's great for us; they stir up energy more so than
the RAs," she said, "but I wonder how living pretty much
isolated from other sophomores affects their social life."
According to sophomore Melissa Baker, living in a basi
cally all-frosh dorm has in no way isolated her from the rest
of campus life.
"1 don't feel that I'm missing out on anything," she said.
"I'm still able to see my old friends, and I've made so many
new ones."
Matthies said he intends to continue the program next
year as long as the results remain positive. Of course, he ex
pects to make minor adjustments according to this year's
result.
And, Matthies said, "If things work out well in Otero this
year, then perhaps other freshman dorms will consider be
coming frosh/soph dorms next year."
