## Duck's Breath will perform tonight Comedy group to release new book and first album 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Theatre of the absurd will be going
on tonight at the New Varsity Theatre
in Palo Alto, but don't expect anything
by Samuel Beckett. It's the Duck's
Breath Mystery Theatre, making a local
stop on its current tour of the Bay Area.
There may still be a few poor

benighted souls who haven't yet heard
of the Duck's Breath comedy troupe
but not for long. The group is about to
put out its first album, and a book, "Dr.
Science's Big Book of Science," based
on the group's radio character Dr. Sci
ence, will also be released this fall.
This in addition to the three cas
settes the group has already released,
as well as its recent "Dr. Science"

show on KQED, its regular broadcasts
on American Public Radio and National
Public Radio and troupe member
Merle Kessler's appearances as social
critic lan Shoales on Ted Koppel's
"Nightline."
With all this going on, plus the
group's live shows, just how big will
Duck's Breath become? "We'll stop and
break up when we're bigger than the
Beatles," says the group's manager,
Steve Baker. "Paul McCartney and John
Lennon each weighed about 180
pounds, and none of us are that heavy
yet."
Group member Jim Turner says that
Duck's Breath will become
"monstrousâ€” we're already more
popular than Jesus." Isn't he worried
that he'll get in trouble for saying that,
as John Lennon did in 1966? "Well,
they can only burn one record of
ours," he replies. "And we'll do any
thing for cheap publicity. We can
repent later on. It'll make a good cover
story for People Magazine."
The troupe's origins stretch back to
the dim reaches of 1975, when they
were all graduate students in lowa City.
A year later they moved to San Fran
cisco, where they have pursued their
unique brand of memorably inane
humor ever since. The original line-up
has stayed together for 11 years. In ad
dition to Turner, the group's members
