## Duck's Breath will perform tonight Comedy group to release new book and first album 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Theatre of the absurd will be going
on tonight at the New Varsity Theatre
in Palo Alto, but don't expect anything
by Samuel Beckett. It's the Duck's
Breath Mystery Theatre, making a local
stop on its current tour of the Bay Area.
There may still be a few poor

benighted souls who haven't yet heard
of the Duck's Breath comedy troupe
but not for long. The group is about to
put out its first album, and a book, "Dr.
Science's Big Book of Science," based
on the group's radio character Dr. Sci
ence, will also be released this fall.
This in addition to the three cas
settes the group has already released,
as well as its recent "Dr. Science"

show on KQED, its regular broadcasts
on American Public Radio and National
Public Radio and troupe member
Merle Kessler's appearances as social
critic lan Shoales on Ted Koppel's
"Nightline."
With all this going on, plus the
group's live shows, just how big will
Duck's Breath become? "We'll stop and
break up when we're bigger than the
Beatles," says the group's manager,
Steve Baker. "Paul McCartney and John
Lennon each weighed about 180
pounds, and none of us are that heavy
yet."
Group member Jim Turner says that
Duck's Breath will become
"monstrousâ€” we're already more
popular than Jesus." Isn't he worried
that he'll get in trouble for saying that,
as John Lennon did in 1966? "Well,
they can only burn one record of
ours," he replies. "And we'll do any
thing for cheap publicity. We can
repent later on. It'll make a good cover
story for People Magazine."
The troupe's origins stretch back to
the dim reaches of 1975, when they
were all graduate students in lowa City.
A year later they moved to San Fran
cisco, where they have pursued their
unique brand of memorably inane
humor ever since. The original line-up
has stayed together for 11 years. In ad
dition to Turner, the group's members

include Bill Allard, Dan Coffey, Leon
Marte and Kessler.
Much of the Duck's Breath Mystery
Theatre's comedy evokes memories of
the '50s and early '60s, since its ma
terial often parodies radio and TV
shows from that period. Take for ex
ample Dr. Science, played by Dan Cof
fey. The all-knowing Dr. Science is the
star of the "Ask Dr. Science" show,
heard on more than 100 American
Public Radio stations nationwide. On
the program, the good doctor gives
voice to all manner of colorful scien
tific theories, such as his belief that
Chihuahuas are cats with severe per
sonality disorders.
And then there's Rowdy Rains, a
Gene Autry-style singing cowboy. Rains
is really engaged in buying up large

corporations; during hostile takeovers
he tries to deceive stockholders by
performing to them. Included in the
Rowdy Rains stable of stars is the in
famous Bunny Rabbit from the
"Captain Kangaroo" show. Bunny Rab
bit's tale is a sad one: It transpires that
he was talked into leaving "Captain
Kangaroo'' too early, didn't make it big,
and now the Captain won't let him
come back. Thus Bunny, played by Bill
Allard, is now reduced to searching for
the answer to life, ever hoping for that
big break.
But perhaps the best known of any
Duck's Breath character is the caustic
social critic lan Shoales, created and
brought to life by Kessler. The Shoales
guide to criticism: "Sarcasm doesn't
really change anything, or hurt
anybody for that matter, but it sure
makes me feel better." Last year an
entire volume of Shoales philosophy
was published under the title "I Gotta
Go." Here are the acidic Mr Shoales'
thoughts on college courses:

"Sieer clear of existentialism, a mor
bid philosophy based on unprovable
premises, designed solely so graduate
students can sprout ratty little beards
and come to believe that despair is
sexually appealing. It's not. Even if
despair were sexy, the people you
meet in philosophy classes aren't. If
you wish to appeal to the opposite sex
(the prime reason for higher educa
tion), buy nice clothes and join a frater
nity or sorority
Two lan Shoales songs (creating a
new genre of music called "sneer
rap") will be featured on the soon-to
be released Duck's Breath album,
tentatively titled "Born to Be Tiled."
About 30 minutes of all new comedy
material will also be featured on the al
bum.
Naturally, the group is excited both
about the record and the upcoming
"Dr. Science's Big Book of Science."
Manager Baker says he's going to
demand that the book become part of
the required curriculum for all science

students at Stanford. "It probably won't
be required as a textbook in Texas,
though. There's too much about evolu
tion in it."
Baker said that the group's goal is to
try and find a niche for "non
improvisatory, non-Neil Simon wimpy
type comedy," and that they are often
compared to Monty Python, "because
what we do can be seen as incredibly
stupid and incredibly smart at the same
time. It's silliness and sophisticated
slapstick." Turner gave a more direct
explanation for the group's appeal:
"Audiences like to see grown men act
as stupid as we do." 1
The Duck's Breath Mystery Theatre
will perform tonight at the New Varsity
Theatre, 456 University Avenue in Palo
Alto. TickeLs are $9, and showtime is at
9:30 p.m. Manager Baker guarantees
that your I.Q. will definitely be
changed after seeing the show;
whether it will be a change for better
or worse, he wouldn't say.
