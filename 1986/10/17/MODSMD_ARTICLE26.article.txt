# 'Rose' characters fail
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial Staff 
"The Name of the Rose" could
have been a great movie. Director
Jean-Jacques Annaud ("Black and
White in Color," "Quest for Fire")
deftly creates a mesmerizing, epic
portrait of a 14th century world, hill
of Gothic grandeur and rich in
medieval atmosphere, which sweeps
us into novelist Umberto Eco's spel
lbinding tale of murder, heresy and
forbidden desires at a majestic
Benedectine monastery.
Unfortunately, despite the film's
ability to capture the moody flavor of
a cold, secluded Italian abbey in
1337, its immense production values
are not quite able to compensate for
a preponderance of unconvincing
acting, a lack of character motivation
and a tumultuous ending.
Sean Connery plays Brother
William of Baskerville, a brilliant, En
glish Franciscan monk who, along
with his young novice Adso
(Christian Slater), arrives at a
wealthy Italian abbey for a summit
conference to debate other clerics
on the issue of poverty within the
church. But before William can even
unpack his bags, the abbot (Michael

Londsale) reveals that a young monk
has died under mysterious circum
stances and begs the Englishman's
help.
As William conducts his investiga
tion of the murder, more monks
begin to mysteriously die, and
William's old nemesis, the Inquisitor
Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham),
is called in to root out the evil by
such tried and true methods as
torture and the stake. William must
then race against time to unlock the
secrets of the Abbey's labyrinthine li
brary, which holds the answer to the
mystery, before he, too, becomes
one of the accused.
The film's central and most
frustrating problem is the lack of ten
sion in the rivalry between the

William and Bernardo Gui charac
ters. We are led to believe that they
are old enemies, that sparks fly
whenever they encounter each
other; however, when Gui finally
arrives, what should have been a
tense, potentially explosive relation
ship between the two fizzles out into
barely a few words and exchanged
glances. The biggest letdown of "The
Name of the Rose" is that there is no
dramatic confrontation between the
two.
Speaking of letdown, there's F.
Murray Abraham. Despite the fact
that he gets above-the-title billing
with Sean Connery, Abraham doesn't
make his entrance until midway
