Brazil (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Terry Gilliam's almost unreleased com
edy is a visually astounding, slapstick
monstrosity. Set in an unspecified
totalitarian future, the movie follows Mini
stry of Information toady Sam Lowry
(Jonathon Pryce) in his quasi-revolt
against the behemoth bureaucracy he
works for. The movie is constructed
around over-blown sight gags and concep
tual (okes in the spirit and style of Gil
liam's Monty Python animation, but what
makes it all special is Gilliam's prodigious,
brilliant visual imagination. His future
world is Art Deco decay on a grand scale,
inspired by heavy metal sci-fi, '40s cartoon
surrealism, "Metropolis," "Blade Runner"
and other influences. Ihe comedy is large
scale and dehumanized, much like Spiel
berg's "1941," but a few performers —
notably Robert DeNiro, lan Holm and Kat
herine Helmond — make an impression.
Gilliam co-authored the screenplay, with
Harold Pinter and Charles McKeown.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.

El Norte (1984)
Bechtel 1-Center
Two young Guatemalans, brother and
sister, whose village has been wiped out
by the army, use their godmother's pitiful
savings to travel into Mexico and — il
legally — into California, the land of
promise the Guatemalans call "el norte"
(the north). The story is an authentic
tragedy, and one admires Gregory Nava,
the director, and his wife, Anna Thomas,
the screenwriter (they co-produced the
picture), for their persistence in working
on a project of such questionable com
mercial potential. But devotion and in
tegrity and right-mindedness don't neces
sarily produce good movies, and "El
Norte" is an enervating one, featuring
those noble peasant icons who have been
with us since the intellectuals of the left in
vented them in the 19305. Zaide Silvia
Guitierrez and David Vallalpando play the
immigrants.
Plays Thursday at 7:30 p.m.

Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wildly erratic as it is, this movie con
tains the best five minutes Woody Allen
has ever done: the sketch in which he
plays a sperm being prepared for launch
ing. (Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds are
at the controls.) The other gem in the
picture is the episode in which an in
spired Gene Wilder plays a doctor who
falls in love with a sheep named Daisy.
The first skit, with Allen as an unfunny
jester and Anthony Quayle and Lynn
Redgrave as the king and queen, begins
promisingly but declines quickly when Al
len gets his hand caught in Redgrave's
chastity belt. There are also a parody of
Antonioni (reasonably funny), a sci-fi take
off about a giant breast (silly), a quiz show
called "What's My Perversion?" (pretty
bad), and a quarter of an hour with Lou

Jacobi as a transvestite (hopeless).
Plays tonight with "Sleeper."

Sleeper (1973)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen's mosdy visual futuristic
comedy is consistently funny but never
takes off into the far-out realm of the
craziest sequences in "Bananas" and
"Everything You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex." He plays the owner of a health
food store who is frozen in the 20th cen
tury and wakes up in the 21st; the first
thing he learns is that junk food, scientists
have discovered, is really good for you.
With Diane Keaton, who does a
memorable imitation of Brando in "A
Streetcar Named Desire." Marshall Brick
man co-wrote the screenplay.
Plays tonight with "Everything You Al
ways Wanted to Know About Sex."

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Strand, San Francisco
Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire on
the polarized state he felt Western society
was approaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is "rehabilitated" by
behavioral psychologists, i.e., reduced to a
benign blur. The nasty joke, of course, is
that the two alternatives — social and anti
social conduct — are equally repugnant.
But in Stanley Kubrick's film version, Alex
is made so sympathetic — and all of soci
ety's representatives are such
megalomaniacal halfwits — that we are
manipulated into cheering for his highly
objectionable acts of rebellion. Shrewdly,
Kubrick casts vivacious, winning Malcolm
McDowell — a performer whom no one
could dislike — in the role of Alex. This is
a morally questionable film, directed in
such an impersonal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it seems to
transpire in a vacuum.
Plays tomorrow with "The Man Who
Fell to Earth" and "Blade Runner."
— S.V.
Blade Runner (1982)
Strand, San Francisco
The Los Angeles of this film — set in
2019 — is a neon-dotted landscape with
electric fires flashing out of chimneys and
aircraft soaring overhead like hal
lucinatory bubbles; from below, you see
enormous advertising images projected
on floating screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the production
designer, Lawrence Paull, and the photog
rapher, Jordan Croenenworth, have
created a future with enough visual con
nections to the past and the present to be
particularly eerie, and Douglas Turnbull's
special effects are often astonishing. Yet
it's a cold, repellent movie. The story

(from a wry sci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick
called "Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep") concerns a bounty hunter as
signed to "retire" a deceptively human
seeming model of robot and unable to do
his job without feeling guilt. But Ridley
Scon is not the right director for a movie
that asks for emotional fullness; his chief
concern is how to stage the violence in
freshly shocking, abstractly beautiful ways.
With Harrison Ford (who seems to be on
automatic pilot), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Han
nah and others.
Plays tomorrow with "A Clockwork Or
ange" and"The Man Who Fell to Earth."
— S.V.
Diva (1982)
Red Vic, San Francisco
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot by
Phillipe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a movie.
Beinix's chief virtue, aside from his dex-

terity, is his determination not to take him
self seriously: The witty, freewheeling way
in which he has put the picture together,
making his camera double back on itself
with tantalizing self-consciousness, seems
to be based on the careless assumption
that this little thriller about stolen tapes is
inconsequential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
designs declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre Leaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy An Luu, who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilhelminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Ham me adapted a
novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir Cosma

supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays Sunday and Monday.
— S.V.
Un Chlen Andalou (1928)
Red Vic, San Francisco
Luis Bunuel made his debut in col
laboration with Salvador Dali. (They
teamed again two years later on "L'Age
d'Or ') In it, he managed not only to find a
unique style, but also to achieve one of
key succes scandales of our century, and
moreover to align himself with one of its
most important movements, surrealism.
The use of the medium to effect the odd,
jarring juxtapositions Dali was already
creating on canvas disturbed and dis
oriented audiences as much as the vio
lence and horror of the two most cele
brated images (the slashing of the eyeball
and the maggots eating away at a living
man's hand). But the greatest shock in the
film was how funny it was — filmgoers
didn't know how to respond to the kind of

renegade wit that could first conceive of
an image of almost primal horror and dis
gust and then laugh at it. With Pierre
Catcheff, Simone Mareuil, Jaime
Miravilles, Bunuel as the man wielding the
razor and Dali as the priest.
Plays Thursday with "L'Age d'Or."
— S.V
Carnal Knowledge (1971)
UC Theater, Berkeley
This satirical comedy about the emo
tional hollowness beneath American
men's sexual obsessiveness is offensively
broad and snide, and cruel to its charac
ters; it's like the worst parts of "The
Graduate" (which Mike Nichols also di
rected) blown up and exhibited as proof
of the incisiveness of the director and the

screenwriter (Jules Feiffer, in this case).
But you don't respond by thinking how
clever they are — you find them just as
repellently crass as the characters they're
indicting. This is a classic case of a movie
that practices exactly what it preaches
against. Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel,
Candice Bergen and Ann-Margret star;
with Rita Moreno, Carol Kane and Cynthia
O'Neal
— 5.V.
The Godfather, Parts I & II (1972 ft
1974)
UC Theater, Berkeley
Together, these two movies, directed by
Francis Ford Coppola, are perhaps the
most magnificent epic ever made in (or
about) this country. Coppola, working
from a script that he and Mario Puzo
adapted from Puzo's bestseller, deals in
Part I with inheritance and corruption:
young, idealistic Michael Corleone takes
over his father's underworld regime in the
1940s when the old man is nearly mur
dered by henchmen attached to a rival
family. In Part 11, which takes us back to
the seeds of this violence in early 20th
century Sicily and forward to the
metamorphosis of Michael and the break
down of his family in the '50s, expands on
these same themes. Much praise has justi
fiably been given to Gordon Willis' pho
tography, the music by Nino Rota and
Carmine Coppola, and the really astonish
ing panoply of performances, especially
those of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert
De Niro, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John
Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo
and Talia Shire.
Plays Sunday.
The Verdict (1982)
UC Theater, Berkeley
David Mamet's script sermonizes ear
nestly about the need for the poor and
weak to believe in the possibility of
justice, and the director, Sidney Lumet,
keeps his camera discreedy distant from
the action so that we can admire how care
fully sets have been built and composi
tions arranged This movie about a down
and-out lawyer who sees the chance to
redeem himself and reverse the course of
his professional life with a malpractice
case was targeted directly at the Oscars,
and though Paul Newman gives a very
good performance on and off, Lumet has
directed him to make bis bid for an
Academy Award, which mean , that his big
scenes are slowed down and seem a little
over-rehearsed and dried out. Besides, the
movie makes him as noble as a Frank
Capra hero, and that doesn't give him
much to play. Mamet has provided some
nice roles, however, for James Mason, Jack
Warden and Julie Bovasso.
Plays Monday with "The Young
Philadelphians" as part of a Newman fes
tival. "Rachel, Rachel" and"The Effect of
Gamma Rays on Man in the Moon
Marigolds" play Tuesday; "The Hustler"
and "Somebody Up There Likes Me" play
Wednesday.

Prizzi's Honor (1965)
Parkside, San Francisco
This John Huston black comedy aims to
be a darkly funny parody of the
"Godfather" movies, with the family
squabbles, double crosses and triple
crosses twisted into lyrical comic fina
gling. The screenplay, by Janet Roach and
Richard Condon (from his book), never
quite fulfills the promise of this concep
tion; the movie seems over-plotted, and
the best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who at 75
displays more energetic skill than most
directors half his age, but the tone grows
wobbly toward the end, primarily because
the filmmakers don't give their two main
characters — hitpeople Charley Partanna
(Jack Nicholson) and Irene Walker
(Kathleen Turner) — enough comic per
sonality to grab us. Their relationship isn't
very well-developed and doesn't make a
lot of sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the supporting
cast, which are clearly closer to Huston's
heart. William Hickey as Don Corrado
Prizzi, the wizened and cackling godfather
of the Prizzi mob, is a joy, and Anjelica
Huston (John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat, Maerose
(she's Charley's former fiance, and she's
out to get him). With Robert Loggia and
John Randolph.
Plays today with "Heartburn."

Turtle Diary (1986)
Parkside, San Francisco
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows more
affection for novelist Russell Hoban's
epigrammatic characters than he has for
anyone in his movies in quite some time.
Glenda Jackson and Ben Kingsley are two
painfully recessive types leading lives of
utter loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three large
sea turtles from the London Zoo; it's the
biggest adventure of their lives, and it
transforms them (slightly). The movie is
long on a kind of petrified British charm,
and it unfnlHc at a leisurely, bordering on
torpid, pace; the stars appear to have been
chosen primarily for their resemblance to
the turtles (they aren't required to do
much acting). Pinter and director John Ir
. vin dissect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays tomorrow with "Letter to
Brezhnev."

plays a sperm being prepared for launch
ing. (Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds are
at the controls.) The other gem in the
picture is the episode in which an in
spired Gene Wilder plays a doctor who
falls in love with a sheep named Daisy.
The first skit, with Allen as an unfunny
jester and Anthony Quayle and Lynn
Redgrave as the king and queen, begins
promisingly but declines quickly when Al
len gets his hand caught in Redgrave's
chastity belt. There are also a parody of
Antonioni (reasonably funny), a sci-fi take
off about a giant breast (silly), a quiz show
called "What's My Perversion?" (pretty
bad), and a quarter of an hour with Lou

Jacobi as a transvestite (hopeless).
Plays tonight with "Sleeper."

Sleeper (1973)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen's mosdy visual futuristic
comedy is consistently funny but never
takes off into the far-out realm of the
craziest sequences in "Bananas" and
"Everything You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex." He plays the owner of a health
food store who is frozen in the 20th cen
tury and wakes up in the 21st; the first
thing he learns is that junk food, scientists
have discovered, is really good for you.
With Diane Keaton, who does a
memorable imitation of Brando in "A
Streetcar Named Desire." Marshall Brick
man co-wrote the screenplay.
Plays tonight with "Everything You Al
ways Wanted to Know About Sex."

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Strand, San Francisco
Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire on
the polarized state he felt Western society
was approaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is "rehabilitated" by
behavioral psychologists, i.e., reduced to a
benign blur. The nasty joke, of course, is
that the two alternatives — social and anti
social conduct — are equally repugnant.
But in Stanley Kubrick's film version, Alex
is made so sympathetic — and all of soci
ety's representatives are such
megalomaniacal halfwits — that we are
manipulated into cheering for his highly
objectionable acts of rebellion. Shrewdly,
Kubrick casts vivacious, winning Malcolm
McDowell — a performer whom no one
could dislike — in the role of Alex. This is
a morally questionable film, directed in
such an impersonal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it seems to
transpire in a vacuum.
Plays tomorrow with "The Man Who
Fell to Earth" and "Blade Runner."
— S.V.
Blade Runner (1982)
Strand, San Francisco
The Los Angeles of this film — set in
2019 — is a neon-dotted landscape with
electric fires flashing out of chimneys and
aircraft soaring overhead like hal
lucinatory bubbles; from below, you see
enormous advertising images projected
on floating screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the production
designer, Lawrence Paull, and the photog
rapher, Jordan Croenenworth, have
created a future with enough visual con
nections to the past and the present to be
particularly eerie, and Douglas Turnbull's
special effects are often astonishing. Yet
it's a cold, repellent movie. The story

(from a wry sci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick
called "Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep") concerns a bounty hunter as
signed to "retire" a deceptively human
seeming model of robot and unable to do
his job without feeling guilt. But Ridley
Scon is not the right director for a movie
that asks for emotional fullness; his chief
concern is how to stage the violence in
freshly shocking, abstractly beautiful ways.
With Harrison Ford (who seems to be on
automatic pilot), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Han
nah and others.
Plays tomorrow with "A Clockwork Or
ange" and"The Man Who Fell to Earth."

Diva (1982)
Red Vic, San Francisco
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot by
Phillipe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a movie.
Beinix's chief virtue, aside from his dex-

terity, is his determination not to take him
self seriously: The witty, freewheeling way
in which he has put the picture together,
making his camera double back on itself
with tantalizing self-consciousness, seems
to be based on the careless assumption
that this little thriller about stolen tapes is
inconsequential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
designs declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre Leaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy An Luu, who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilhelminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Ham me adapted a
novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir Cosma

supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays Sunday and Monday.
— S.V.
Un Chlen Andalou (1928)
Red Vic, San Francisco
Luis Bunuel made his debut in col
laboration with Salvador Dali. (They
teamed again two years later on "L'Age
d'Or ') In it, he managed not only to find a
unique style, but also to achieve one of
key succes scandales of our century, and
moreover to align himself with one of its
most important movements, surrealism.
The use of the medium to effect the odd,
jarring juxtapositions Dali was already
creating on canvas disturbed and dis
oriented audiences as much as the vio
lence and horror of the two most cele
brated images (the slashing of the eyeball
and the maggots eating away at a living
man's hand). But the greatest shock in the
film was how funny it was — filmgoers
didn't know how to respond to the kind of

renegade wit that could first conceive of
an image of almost primal horror and dis
gust and then laugh at it. With Pierre
Catcheff, Simone Mareuil, Jaime
Miravilles, Bunuel as the man wielding the
razor and Dali as the priest.
Plays Thursday with "L'Age d'Or."
— S.V
Carnal Knowledge (1971)
UC Theater, Berkeley
This satirical comedy about the emo
tional hollowness beneath American
men's sexual obsessiveness is offensively
broad and snide, and cruel to its charac
ters; it's like the worst parts of "The
Graduate" (which Mike Nichols also di
rected) blown up and exhibited as proof
of the incisiveness of the director and the

screenwriter (Jules Feiffer, in this case).
But you don't respond by thinking how
clever they are — you find them just as
repellently crass as the characters they're
indicting. This is a classic case of a movie
that practices exactly what it preaches
against. Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel,
Candice Bergen and Ann-Margret star;
with Rita Moreno, Carol Kane and Cynthia
O'Neal

The Godfather, Parts I & II (1972 ft
1974)
UC Theater, Berkeley
Together, these two movies, directed by
Francis Ford Coppola, are perhaps the
most magnificent epic ever made in (or
about) this country. Coppola, working
from a script that he and Mario Puzo
adapted from Puzo's bestseller, deals in
Part I with inheritance and corruption:
young, idealistic Michael Corleone takes
over his father's underworld regime in the
1940s when the old man is nearly mur
dered by henchmen attached to a rival
family. In Part 11, which takes us back to
the seeds of this violence in early 20th
century Sicily and forward to the
metamorphosis of Michael and the break
down of his family in the '50s, expands on
these same themes. Much praise has justi
fiably been given to Gordon Willis' pho
tography, the music by Nino Rota and
Carmine Coppola, and the really astonish
ing panoply of performances, especially
those of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert
De Niro, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John
Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo
and Talia Shire.
Plays Sunday.
The Verdict (1982)
UC Theater, Berkeley
David Mamet's script sermonizes ear
nestly about the need for the poor and
weak to believe in the possibility of
justice, and the director, Sidney Lumet,
keeps his camera discreedy distant from
the action so that we can admire how care
fully sets have been built and composi
tions arranged This movie about a down
and-out lawyer who sees the chance to
redeem himself and reverse the course of
his professional life with a malpractice
case was targeted directly at the Oscars,
and though Paul Newman gives a very
good performance on and off, Lumet has
directed him to make bis bid for an
Academy Award, which mean , that his big
scenes are slowed down and seem a little
over-rehearsed and dried out. Besides, the
movie makes him as noble as a Frank
Capra hero, and that doesn't give him
much to play. Mamet has provided some
nice roles, however, for James Mason, Jack
Warden and Julie Bovasso.
Plays Monday with "The Young
Philadelphians" as part of a Newman fes
tival. "Rachel, Rachel" and"The Effect of
Gamma Rays on Man in the Moon

and "Somebody Up There Likes Me" play

Prizzi's Honor (1965)
Parkside, San Francisco
This John Huston black comedy aims to
be a darkly funny parody of the
"Godfather" movies, with the family
squabbles, double crosses and triple
crosses twisted into lyrical comic fina
gling. The screenplay, by Janet Roach and
Richard Condon (from his book), never
quite fulfills the promise of this concep
tion; the movie seems over-plotted, and
the best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who at 75
displays more energetic skill than most
directors half his age, but the tone grows
wobbly toward the end, primarily because
the filmmakers don't give their two main
characters — hitpeople Charley Partanna
(Jack Nicholson) and Irene Walker
(Kathleen Turner) — enough comic per
sonality to grab us. Their relationship isn't
very well-developed and doesn't make a
lot of sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the supporting
cast, which are clearly closer to Huston's
heart. William Hickey as Don Corrado
Prizzi, the wizened and cackling godfather
of the Prizzi mob, is a joy, and Anjelica
Huston (John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat, Maerose
(she's Charley's former fiance, and she's
out to get him). With Robert Loggia and
John Randolph.

Turtle Diary (1986)
Parkside, San Francisco
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows more
affection for novelist Russell Hoban's
epigrammatic characters than he has for
anyone in his movies in quite some time.
Glenda Jackson and Ben Kingsley are two
painfully recessive types leading lives of
utter loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three large
sea turtles from the London Zoo; it's the
biggest adventure of their lives, and it
transforms them (slightly). The movie is
long on a kind of petrified British charm,
and it unfnlHc at a leisurely, bordering on
torpid, pace; the stars appear to have been
chosen primarily for their resemblance to
the turtles (they aren't required to do
much acting). Pinter and director John Ir

enervating precision and care.

Two young Guatemalans, brother and

tragedy, and one admires Gregory Nava,
the director, and his wife, Anna Thomas,
the screenwriter (they co-produced the
picture), for their persistence in working
on a project of such questionable com
mercial potential. But devotion and in
tegrity and right-mindedness don't neces

Blade Runner (1982)
Strand, San Francisco
The Los Angeles of this film — set in
2019 — is a neon-dotted landscape with
electric fires flashing out of chimneys and
aircraft soaring overhead like hal
lucinatory bubbles; from below, you see
enormous advertising images projected
on floating screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the production
designer, Lawrence Paull, and the photog
rapher, Jordan Croenenworth, have
created a future with enough visual con
nections to the past and the present to be
particularly eerie, and Douglas Turnbull's
special effects are often astonishing. Yet
it's a cold, repellent movie. The story

(from a wry sci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick
called "Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep") concerns a bounty hunter as
signed to "retire" a deceptively human
seeming model of robot and unable to do
his job without feeling guilt. But Ridley
Scon is not the right director for a movie
that asks for emotional fullness; his chief
concern is how to stage the violence in
freshly shocking, abstractly beautiful ways.
With Harrison Ford (who seems to be on
automatic pilot), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Han
nah and others.
Plays tomorrow with "A Clockwork Or
ange" and"The Man Who Fell to Earth."

Diva (1982)
Red Vic, San Francisco
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot by
Phillipe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a movie.
Beinix's chief virtue, aside from his dex-

terity, is his determination not to take him
self seriously: The witty, freewheeling way
in which he has put the picture together,
making his camera double back on itself
with tantalizing self-consciousness, seems
to be based on the careless assumption
that this little thriller about stolen tapes is
inconsequential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
designs declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre Leaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy An Luu, who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilhelminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Ham me adapted a
novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir Cosma

supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays Sunday and Monday.

Un Chlen Andalou (1928)
Red Vic, San Francisco
Luis Bunuel made his debut in col
laboration with Salvador Dali. (They
teamed again two years later on "L'Age
d'Or ') In it, he managed not only to find a
unique style, but also to achieve one of
key succes scandales of our century, and
moreover to align himself with one of its
most important movements, surrealism.
The use of the medium to effect the odd,
jarring juxtapositions Dali was already
creating on canvas disturbed and dis
oriented audiences as much as the vio
lence and horror of the two most cele
brated images (the slashing of the eyeball
and the maggots eating away at a living
man's hand). But the greatest shock in the
film was how funny it was — filmgoers
didn't know how to respond to the kind of

renegade wit that could first conceive of
an image of almost primal horror and dis
gust and then laugh at it. With Pierre
Catcheff, Simone Mareuil, Jaime
Miravilles, Bunuel as the man wielding the
razor and Dali as the priest.
Plays Thursday with "L'Age d'Or."
— S.V
Carnal Knowledge (1971)
UC Theater, Berkeley
This satirical comedy about the emo
tional hollowness beneath American
men's sexual obsessiveness is offensively
broad and snide, and cruel to its charac
ters; it's like the worst parts of "The
Graduate" (which Mike Nichols also di
rected) blown up and exhibited as proof
of the incisiveness of the director and the

screenwriter (Jules Feiffer, in this case).
But you don't respond by thinking how
clever they are — you find them just as
repellently crass as the characters they're
indicting. This is a classic case of a movie
that practices exactly what it preaches
against. Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel,
Candice Bergen and Ann-Margret star;
with Rita Moreno, Carol Kane and Cynthia
O'Neal

The Godfather, Parts I & II (1972 ft
1974)
UC Theater, Berkeley
Together, these two movies, directed by
Francis Ford Coppola, are perhaps the
most magnificent epic ever made in (or
about) this country. Coppola, working
from a script that he and Mario Puzo
adapted from Puzo's bestseller, deals in
Part I with inheritance and corruption:
young, idealistic Michael Corleone takes
over his father's underworld regime in the
1940s when the old man is nearly mur
dered by henchmen attached to a rival
family. In Part 11, which takes us back to
the seeds of this violence in early 20th
century Sicily and forward to the
metamorphosis of Michael and the break
down of his family in the '50s, expands on
these same themes. Much praise has justi
fiably been given to Gordon Willis' pho
tography, the music by Nino Rota and
Carmine Coppola, and the really astonish
ing panoply of performances, especially
those of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert
De Niro, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John
Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo
and Talia Shire.
Plays Sunday.
The Verdict (1982)
UC Theater, Berkeley
David Mamet's script sermonizes ear
nestly about the need for the poor and
weak to believe in the possibility of
justice, and the director, Sidney Lumet,
keeps his camera discreedy distant from
the action so that we can admire how care
fully sets have been built and composi
tions arranged This movie about a down
and-out lawyer who sees the chance to
redeem himself and reverse the course of
his professional life with a malpractice
case was targeted directly at the Oscars,
and though Paul Newman gives a very
good performance on and off, Lumet has
directed him to make bis bid for an
Academy Award, which mean , that his big
scenes are slowed down and seem a little
over-rehearsed and dried out. Besides, the
movie makes him as noble as a Frank
Capra hero, and that doesn't give him
much to play. Mamet has provided some
nice roles, however, for James Mason, Jack
Warden and Julie Bovasso.
Plays Monday with "The Young
Philadelphians" as part of a Newman fes
tival. "Rachel, Rachel" and"The Effect of
Gamma Rays on Man in the Moon
Marigolds" play Tuesday; "The Hustler"
and "Somebody Up There Likes Me" play

Prizzi's Honor (1965)
Parkside, San Francisco
This John Huston black comedy aims to
be a darkly funny parody of the
"Godfather" movies, with the family
squabbles, double crosses and triple
crosses twisted into lyrical comic fina
gling. The screenplay, by Janet Roach and
Richard Condon (from his book), never
quite fulfills the promise of this concep
tion; the movie seems over-plotted, and
the best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who at 75
displays more energetic skill than most
directors half his age, but the tone grows
wobbly toward the end, primarily because
the filmmakers don't give their two main
characters — hitpeople Charley Partanna
(Jack Nicholson) and Irene Walker
(Kathleen Turner) — enough comic per
sonality to grab us. Their relationship isn't
very well-developed and doesn't make a
lot of sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the supporting
cast, which are clearly closer to Huston's
heart. William Hickey as Don Corrado
Prizzi, the wizened and cackling godfather
of the Prizzi mob, is a joy, and Anjelica
Huston (John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat, Maerose
(she's Charley's former fiance, and she's
out to get him). With Robert Loggia and
John Randolph.
Plays today with "Heartburn."

Turtle Diary (1986)
Parkside, San Francisco
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows more
affection for novelist Russell Hoban's
epigrammatic characters than he has for
anyone in his movies in quite some time.
Glenda Jackson and Ben Kingsley are two
painfully recessive types leading lives of
utter loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three large
sea turtles from the London Zoo; it's the
biggest adventure of their lives, and it
transforms them (slightly). The movie is
long on a kind of petrified British charm,
and it unfnlHc at a leisurely, bordering on
torpid, pace; the stars appear to have been
chosen primarily for their resemblance to
the turtles (they aren't required to do
much acting). Pinter and director John Ir
. vin dissect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays tomorrow with "Letter to

Terry Gilliam's almost unreleased com

monstrosity. Set in an unspecified
totalitarian future, the movie follows Mini

around over-blown sight gags and concep

El Norte (1984)
Bechtel 1-Center
Two young Guatemalans, brother and
sister, whose village has been wiped out
by the army, use their godmother's pitiful
savings to travel into Mexico and — il
legally — into California, the land of
promise the Guatemalans call "el norte"
(the north). The story is an authentic
tragedy, and one admires Gregory Nava,
the director, and his wife, Anna Thomas,
the screenwriter (they co-produced the
picture), for their persistence in working
on a project of such questionable com
mercial potential. But devotion and in
tegrity and right-mindedness don't neces
sarily produce good movies, and "El
Norte" is an enervating one, featuring
those noble peasant icons who have been
with us since the intellectuals of the left in
vented them in the 19305. Zaide Silvia

Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wildly erratic as it is, this movie con
tains the best five minutes Woody Allen
has ever done: the sketch in which he
plays a sperm being prepared for launch
ing. (Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds are
at the controls.) The other gem in the
picture is the episode in which an in
spired Gene Wilder plays a doctor who
falls in love with a sheep named Daisy.
The first skit, with Allen as an unfunny
jester and Anthony Quayle and Lynn
Redgrave as the king and queen, begins
promisingly but declines quickly when Al
len gets his hand caught in Redgrave's
chastity belt. There are also a parody of
Antonioni (reasonably funny), a sci-fi take
off about a giant breast (silly), a quiz show
called "What's My Perversion?" (pretty
bad), and a quarter of an hour with Lou

Jacobi as a transvestite (hopeless).

Woody Allen's mosdy visual futuristic

"Everything You Always Wanted to Know

thing he learns is that junk food, scientists
have discovered, is really good for you.

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Strand, San Francisco
Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire on
the polarized state he felt Western society
was approaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is "rehabilitated" by
behavioral psychologists, i.e., reduced to a
benign blur. The nasty joke, of course, is
that the two alternatives — social and anti
social conduct — are equally repugnant.
But in Stanley Kubrick's film version, Alex
is made so sympathetic — and all of soci
ety's representatives are such
megalomaniacal halfwits — that we are
manipulated into cheering for his highly
objectionable acts of rebellion. Shrewdly,
Kubrick casts vivacious, winning Malcolm
McDowell — a performer whom no one
could dislike — in the role of Alex. This is
a morally questionable film, directed in
such an impersonal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it seems to
transpire in a vacuum.

Pierre Leaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy An Luu, who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black

Beinix and Jean Van Ham me adapted a

Un Chlen Andalou (1928)
Red Vic, San Francisco
Luis Bunuel made his debut in col
laboration with Salvador Dali. (They
teamed again two years later on "L'Age
d'Or ') In it, he managed not only to find a
unique style, but also to achieve one of
key succes scandales of our century, and
moreover to align himself with one of its
most important movements, surrealism.
The use of the medium to effect the odd,
jarring juxtapositions Dali was already
creating on canvas disturbed and dis
oriented audiences as much as the vio
lence and horror of the two most cele
brated images (the slashing of the eyeball
and the maggots eating away at a living
man's hand). But the greatest shock in the
film was how funny it was — filmgoers
didn't know how to respond to the kind of

renegade wit that could first conceive of
an image of almost primal horror and dis
gust and then laugh at it. With Pierre
Catcheff, Simone Mareuil, Jaime
Miravilles, Bunuel as the man wielding the
razor and Dali as the priest.
Plays Thursday with "L'Age d'Or."

Carnal Knowledge (1971)
UC Theater, Berkeley
This satirical comedy about the emo
tional hollowness beneath American
men's sexual obsessiveness is offensively
broad and snide, and cruel to its charac
ters; it's like the worst parts of "The
Graduate" (which Mike Nichols also di
rected) blown up and exhibited as proof
of the incisiveness of the director and the

screenwriter (Jules Feiffer, in this case).
But you don't respond by thinking how
clever they are — you find them just as
repellently crass as the characters they're
indicting. This is a classic case of a movie
that practices exactly what it preaches
against. Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel,
Candice Bergen and Ann-Margret star;
with Rita Moreno, Carol Kane and Cynthia
O'Neal

The Godfather, Parts I & II (1972 ft
1974)
UC Theater, Berkeley
Together, these two movies, directed by
Francis Ford Coppola, are perhaps the
most magnificent epic ever made in (or
about) this country. Coppola, working
from a script that he and Mario Puzo
adapted from Puzo's bestseller, deals in
Part I with inheritance and corruption:
young, idealistic Michael Corleone takes
over his father's underworld regime in the
1940s when the old man is nearly mur
dered by henchmen attached to a rival
family. In Part 11, which takes us back to
the seeds of this violence in early 20th
century Sicily and forward to the
metamorphosis of Michael and the break
down of his family in the '50s, expands on
these same themes. Much praise has justi
fiably been given to Gordon Willis' pho
tography, the music by Nino Rota and
Carmine Coppola, and the really astonish
ing panoply of performances, especially
those of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert
De Niro, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John
Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo
and Talia Shire.
Plays Sunday.
The Verdict (1982)
UC Theater, Berkeley
David Mamet's script sermonizes ear
nestly about the need for the poor and
weak to believe in the possibility of
justice, and the director, Sidney Lumet,
keeps his camera discreedy distant from
the action so that we can admire how care
fully sets have been built and composi
tions arranged This movie about a down
and-out lawyer who sees the chance to
redeem himself and reverse the course of
his professional life with a malpractice
case was targeted directly at the Oscars,
and though Paul Newman gives a very
good performance on and off, Lumet has
directed him to make bis bid for an
Academy Award, which mean , that his big
scenes are slowed down and seem a little
over-rehearsed and dried out. Besides, the
movie makes him as noble as a Frank
Capra hero, and that doesn't give him
much to play. Mamet has provided some
nice roles, however, for James Mason, Jack
Warden and Julie Bovasso.
Plays Monday with "The Young
Philadelphians" as part of a Newman fes
tival. "Rachel, Rachel" and"The Effect of
Gamma Rays on Man in the Moon
Marigolds" play Tuesday; "The Hustler"
and "Somebody Up There Likes Me" play

Prizzi's Honor (1965)
Parkside, San Francisco
This John Huston black comedy aims to
be a darkly funny parody of the
"Godfather" movies, with the family
squabbles, double crosses and triple
crosses twisted into lyrical comic fina
gling. The screenplay, by Janet Roach and
Richard Condon (from his book), never
quite fulfills the promise of this concep
tion; the movie seems over-plotted, and
the best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who at 75
displays more energetic skill than most
directors half his age, but the tone grows
wobbly toward the end, primarily because
the filmmakers don't give their two main
characters — hitpeople Charley Partanna
(Jack Nicholson) and Irene Walker
(Kathleen Turner) — enough comic per
sonality to grab us. Their relationship isn't
very well-developed and doesn't make a
lot of sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the supporting
cast, which are clearly closer to Huston's
heart. William Hickey as Don Corrado
Prizzi, the wizened and cackling godfather
of the Prizzi mob, is a joy, and Anjelica
Huston (John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat, Maerose
(she's Charley's former fiance, and she's
out to get him). With Robert Loggia and
John Randolph.
Plays today with "Heartburn."

Turtle Diary (1986)
Parkside, San Francisco
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows more
affection for novelist Russell Hoban's
epigrammatic characters than he has for
anyone in his movies in quite some time.
Glenda Jackson and Ben Kingsley are two
painfully recessive types leading lives of
utter loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three large
sea turtles from the London Zoo; it's the
biggest adventure of their lives, and it
transforms them (slightly). The movie is
long on a kind of petrified British charm,
and it unfnlHc at a leisurely, bordering on
torpid, pace; the stars appear to have been
chosen primarily for their resemblance to
the turtles (they aren't required to do
much acting). Pinter and director John Ir
. vin dissect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays tomorrow with "Letter to
Brezhnev."

Terry Gilliam's almost unreleased com
edy is a visually astounding, slapstick
monstrosity. Set in an unspecified
totalitarian future, the movie follows Mini
stry of Information toady Sam Lowry
(Jonathon Pryce) in his quasi-revolt
against the behemoth bureaucracy he
works for. The movie is constructed
around over-blown sight gags and concep
tual (okes in the spirit and style of Gil
liam's Monty Python animation, but what
makes it all special is Gilliam's prodigious,
brilliant visual imagination. His future
world is Art Deco decay on a grand scale,
inspired by heavy metal sci-fi, '40s cartoon
surrealism, "Metropolis," "Blade Runner"
and other influences. Ihe comedy is large
scale and dehumanized, much like Spiel
berg's "1941," but a few performers —
notably Robert DeNiro, lan Holm and Kat
herine Helmond — make an impression.
Gilliam co-authored the screenplay, with
Harold Pinter and Charles McKeown.

El Norte (1984)
Bechtel 1-Center
Two young Guatemalans, brother and
sister, whose village has been wiped out
by the army, use their godmother's pitiful
savings to travel into Mexico and — il
legally — into California, the land of
promise the Guatemalans call "el norte"
(the north). The story is an authentic
tragedy, and one admires Gregory Nava,
the director, and his wife, Anna Thomas,
the screenwriter (they co-produced the
picture), for their persistence in working
on a project of such questionable com
mercial potential. But devotion and in
tegrity and right-mindedness don't neces
sarily produce good movies, and "El
Norte" is an enervating one, featuring
those noble peasant icons who have been
with us since the intellectuals of the left in
vented them in the 19305. Zaide Silvia
Guitierrez and David Vallalpando play the
immigrants.
Plays Thursday at 7:30 p.m.

Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wildly erratic as it is, this movie con
tains the best five minutes Woody Allen
has ever done: the sketch in which he
plays a sperm being prepared for launch
ing. (Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds are
at the controls.) The other gem in the
picture is the episode in which an in
spired Gene Wilder plays a doctor who
falls in love with a sheep named Daisy.
The first skit, with Allen as an unfunny
jester and Anthony Quayle and Lynn
Redgrave as the king and queen, begins
promisingly but declines quickly when Al
len gets his hand caught in Redgrave's
chastity belt. There are also a parody of
Antonioni (reasonably funny), a sci-fi take
off about a giant breast (silly), a quiz show
called "What's My Perversion?" (pretty
bad), and a quarter of an hour with Lou

Jacobi as a transvestite (hopeless).
Plays tonight with "Sleeper."

Sleeper (1973)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen's mosdy visual futuristic
comedy is consistently funny but never
takes off into the far-out realm of the
craziest sequences in "Bananas" and
"Everything You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex." He plays the owner of a health
food store who is frozen in the 20th cen
tury and wakes up in the 21st; the first
thing he learns is that junk food, scientists
have discovered, is really good for you.
With Diane Keaton, who does a
memorable imitation of Brando in "A
Streetcar Named Desire." Marshall Brick
man co-wrote the screenplay.
Plays tonight with "Everything You Al
ways Wanted to Know About Sex."

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Strand, San Francisco
Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire on
the polarized state he felt Western society
was approaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is "rehabilitated" by
behavioral psychologists, i.e., reduced to a
benign blur. The nasty joke, of course, is
that the two alternatives — social and anti
social conduct — are equally repugnant.
But in Stanley Kubrick's film version, Alex
is made so sympathetic — and all of soci
ety's representatives are such
megalomaniacal halfwits — that we are
manipulated into cheering for his highly
objectionable acts of rebellion. Shrewdly,
Kubrick casts vivacious, winning Malcolm
McDowell — a performer whom no one
could dislike — in the role of Alex. This is
a morally questionable film, directed in
such an impersonal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it seems to
transpire in a vacuum.
Plays tomorrow with "The Man Who
Fell to Earth" and "Blade Runner."
— S.V.
Blade Runner (1982)
Strand, San Francisco
The Los Angeles of this film — set in
2019 — is a neon-dotted landscape with
electric fires flashing out of chimneys and
aircraft soaring overhead like hal
lucinatory bubbles; from below, you see
enormous advertising images projected
on floating screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the production
designer, Lawrence Paull, and the photog
rapher, Jordan Croenenworth, have
created a future with enough visual con
nections to the past and the present to be
particularly eerie, and Douglas Turnbull's
special effects are often astonishing. Yet
it's a cold, repellent movie. The story

(from a wry sci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick
called "Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep") concerns a bounty hunter as
signed to "retire" a deceptively human
seeming model of robot and unable to do
his job without feeling guilt. But Ridley
Scon is not the right director for a movie
that asks for emotional fullness; his chief
concern is how to stage the violence in
freshly shocking, abstractly beautiful ways.
With Harrison Ford (who seems to be on
automatic pilot), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Han
nah and others.
Plays tomorrow with "A Clockwork Or
ange" and"The Man Who Fell to Earth."

Diva (1982)
Red Vic, San Francisco
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot by
Phillipe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a movie.
Beinix's chief virtue, aside from his dex-

terity, is his determination not to take him
self seriously: The witty, freewheeling way
in which he has put the picture together,
making his camera double back on itself
with tantalizing self-consciousness, seems
to be based on the careless assumption
that this little thriller about stolen tapes is
inconsequential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
designs declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre Leaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy An Luu, who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilhelminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Ham me adapted a

supplied a terrific jazzy score.
