## Top-rated Card takes on UCLA 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
After crushing No. 2 California 14-5
last Friday for its fourth victory over
the Golden Bears this year, the only
doubt that remains for the No. 1-
ranked and 20-0 Stanford men's water
polo team is whether it can keep its
level of intensity up.
Will the Cardinal players come out
flat against an emotionally charged
team and find themselves in a dogfight
for the first time this year?
"It's becoming a pretty big issue
around here — getting up for each
game," senior Greg Gamble said.
"Trying to win every game is diffi
cult," senior Craig Klass said. "But it's a
goal we think we can accomplish."
In the next two days, the Cardinal
will see if it can maintain its high level
of play as it takes on No. 3 UCLA at 3
p.m. today and eighth-rated UC-Irvine
( „ tomorrow at 11 a.m. Both matches will
£%be held at DeGuerre Pool.
Jv "We still have to prove ourselves,"
Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
■X"The UCLA game is a league game. I
S don't think there will be a letdown."
Stanford has scored a whopping 288
this season, while only giving up
VJ*99. After scoring 59 goals last year,

Klass has put in 49 goals already this
year. Junior Erich Fischer is second on
the team with 47 goals, followed by
senior David Imbernino with 34. Six
Cardinal players have scored at least 20
goals.
In addition, senior Chris Thompson,
a three-year starter who had been out
this year with a collapsed lung, is re
turning to the lineup today. There had
been some question about his return
this year.
"I am going to bring him back
slowly," Dettamanti said. "Even if he
isn't a starter, he will get equal playing
time."
In UCLA (14-4), Stanford faces a
tough opponent which is undefeated
with junior Fernando Carsalade in the
lineup.
The Cardinal defeated UCLA, minus
Carsalade, 12-5 at the UC-Irvine Tourn
ament earlier this year. Since then, the
Bruins have defeated No. 4 USC (8-5),
No. 6 Pepperdine (12-6) and Irvine (8-
4). For the first time this year, the
Bruins are at full strength.
"We feel that right now they could
be the No. 2 team in the country," Klass
said.
Carsalade participated in the 1984

Olympics for Brazil. With him, the
Bruins defeated USC. Without Car
salade in the lineup, UCLA fell to the
same Trojans by four goals.
"He is kind of a one-man team," Det
tamanti said. "He is quick at getting
around the holeman. He disrupts
things."
On Saturday, the Cardinal will face
Irvine (7-6 this year) in a rematch of
last year's NCAA title game, which saw
Stanford prevail 12-11 in overtime.
"Irvine is always a tough team," Det
tamanti said. "They always play good,
consistent water polo. We have had
more problems with Irvine over the
years than Cal."
