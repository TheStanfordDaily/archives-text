# Stanford to face battle-weary Oregon
## Cardinal hopes to stay in Pac-10 race; last-place Ducks barely above water 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
After having faced No. 9 Washington a week ago,
Stanford gets a relative breather when it travels to
Oregon this weekend to face the Ducks. Oregon is 2-
4 this season but has had the scheduling misfortune
of playing four straight games against top-20 teams.
The Ducks lost all those games after opening with
victories over San Jose State and Colorado. But now,
with the Cardinal having dropped from the roll of na
tionally ranked teams, the Ducks might be thinking
they have son of a breather, too.
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks doesn't see it quite that
way. "The Stanford defense is probably the most im
proved in the league, without exception," he said.
"The Stanford offense is always outstanding. John
Paye is a great quarterback, and Brad Muster is a
great back whether he's running or catching the foot
ball."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway was equally wary of his
opponent this week. "Contrary to what you believe,"
he said, "Oregon is not one of those teams we should
beat."
But looking at things on paper, it is. Oregon wasn't
a power to begin with, and injuries, including five
broken thumbs, have taken their toll. Linebacker
John Wolf, defensive end Matt Brock, defensive tackle
Chris Leupold and wide receiver Jan Cespedes are all
out.
On the Cardinal side, the same lineup that played
Washington even for 55 minutes will be available.
That includes wide receiver Jeff James, whose return
to the lineup saw the offense break out of lethargy

and rock a top-flight Washington defense for 433
yards of total offense.
The big matchup will come at quarterback. A year
ago, Ducks signal-caller Chris Miller was named the
top quarterback in the Pacific 10 Conference. Behind
him, on the second team, was a certain John Paye.
This year, Miller has completed 61 percent of his
passes for an average of 236 yards per game, six
touchdowns and seven interceptions in six games. In
five games, Paye has completed 59 percent of his at
tempts, averaged 236 yards per game, with eight
touchdowns and five interceptions. V* *

"They're both great athletes," Brooks said. "They
obviously can run, move around and throw the ball
well. They're more similar than dissimilar."
Oregon is "a much better offensive team than a de
fensive team," Elway said. "We've got to take the run
away from them, but that doesn't solve the problem,
because Miller's a great passer. He's a very poised,
outstanding quarterback."

Brooks ugiced with the assessment of his defense.
Asked to find the problem, he responded, "Other
than we can't stop anyone, I don't think I can think of
one. Let's see, we've got no pass rush, we're inconsis
tent — we're pretty undisciplined on defense."
For Oregon, the incentive tomorrow will be to
break the losing streak and try to salvage a winning
season from the wrath of the schedule-maker. For
the Cardinal it will be two-fold.

Oregon Coach Rich Brooks doesn't see it quite that
way. "The Stanford defense is probably the most im
proved in the league, without exception," he said.
"The Stanford offense is always outstanding. John
Paye is a great quarterback, and Brad Muster is a
great back whether he's running or catching the foot
ball."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway was equally wary of his
opponent this week. "Contrary to what you believe,"
he said, "Oregon is not one of those teams we should
beat."
But looking at things on paper, it is. Oregon wasn't
a power to begin with, and injuries, including five
broken thumbs, have taken their toll. Linebacker
John Wolf, defensive end Matt Brock, defensive tackle
Chris Leupold and wide receiver Jan Cespedes are all
out.
On the Cardinal side, the same lineup that played
Washington even for 55 minutes will be available.
That includes wide receiver Jeff James, whose return
to the lineup saw the offense break out of lethargy

and rock a top-flight Washington defense for 433
yards of total offense.
The big matchup will come at quarterback. A year
ago, Ducks signal-caller Chris Miller was named the
top quarterback in the Pacific 10 Conference. Behind
him, on the second team, was a certain John Paye.
This year, Miller has completed 61 percent of his
passes for an average of 236 yards per game, six
touchdowns and seven interceptions in six games. In
five games, Paye has completed 59 percent of his at
tempts, averaged 236 yards per game, with eight
touchdowns and five interceptions. V* *

"They're both great athletes," Brooks said. "They
obviously can run, move around and throw the ball
well. They're more similar than dissimilar."
Oregon is "a much better offensive team than a de
fensive team," Elway said. "We've got to take the run
away from them, but that doesn't solve the problem,
because Miller's a great passer. He's a very poised,
outstanding quarterback."

Brooks ugiced with the assessment of his defense.
Asked to find the problem, he responded, "Other
than we can't stop anyone, I don't think I can think of
one. Let's see, we've got no pass rush, we're inconsis
tent — we're pretty undisciplined on defense."
For Oregon, the incentive tomorrow will be to
break the losing streak and try to salvage a winning
season from the wrath of the schedule-maker. For
the Cardinal it will be two-fold.
First, despite an excellent performance against
Washington, Stanford lost
* ' Sfecond, last year the Cardinal played an excellent

first quarter against Oregon, then watched departed
tailback Tony Cherry cut loose for 227 yards to lead
the Ducks to a 45-28 triumph. This is payback year for
the Cardinal defense.
The game will not be televised back to the Bay
Area. KCBS (740 AM) and KZSU (90.1 FM) will broad
cast the game back home from Autzen Stadium in
Eugene. Game time is 1 p.m.

| Running back Brad Muster (25) has been hurting opponents both with his
> powerful running game and his ability to catch passes out of the backfield.
J Muster leads the Cardinal this season in rushing yards and receptions and
i will try to add to his statistics tomorrow at Oregon.
