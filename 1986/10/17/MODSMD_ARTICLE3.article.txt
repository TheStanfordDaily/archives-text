# CIR will consider 22 firms

### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The University's Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) will consider divestment
from an unprecedented number of companies
during the 1986-87 school year and will vote on a
record number of stockholder resolutions.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier foresees a de
manding quarter: "I think the first half of this year
is very probably the busiest ... the CIR has ever
had, because we are working so hard on selective
divestment and the disinvestment issue."
Last school year, the CIR made three divest
ment recommendations to the Board of Trustees.
A month into this quarter, the CIR has already
voted for divestment from two companies, al
though Stanford had already sold its stock in
Loctite Corp.
The trustees have followed each of the recom
mendations, agreeing to buy no stock in Loctite
and divesting from four companies —
Schlumberger Ltd., Diamond Shamrock Corp.,
Grey Advertising and Newmont Mining.
The CIR has at least 22 other candidates for di
vestment that are being analyzed to determine

their net effect on South African society, Hillier
said.
That undertaking dwarfs the number
scrutinized last year, Hillier said, and puts the CIR
much closer to its goal of systematically reviewing
all South Africa-related companies in the Univer
sity's portfolio.
Stanford owns approximately $189 million of
stock in 66 companies that do business in South
Africa.
One factor accounting for this rapid growth in
the number of companies under CIR considera
tion is having established criteria for selective di
vestment. Hillier said last year's CIR spent half the
year formulating those criteria.
In addition, the CIR has five returning mem
bers and a substantial information base on com
panies with South Africa operations — compiled
by the the Investment Responsibility Task Force,
the ClR's arm for research and administrative
tasks.
Hillier also predicts that almost every South
Africa-related company in which Stanford owns
stock will face a stockholder-sponsored disinvest-
ment resolution. A company disinvests
when it withdraws from a country.
In years past, the resolutions have
opposed loans to the South African
government or encouraged companies
to adopt the Sullivan Principles, Hillier
said, "but now almost all the resolu
tions will be on withdrawal."
Any stockholder may propose a
resolution, which is then voted on by
all stockholders. Each stockholder is
entitled to one vote for each share of

stock he owns. The company's board
of directors must carry out the dictates
of a resolution that passes.
The CIR will also release four South
Africa discussion papers to the public
between Nov. 5 and Nov. 26. Hillier
said the papers will probably be the
basis for a position paper, to be pre
sented to the trustees in February, on
the effect of U.S. investments in South
Africa.
The CIR will decide by early January
whether to divest from 22 companies
that have not signed the Sullivan Prin
ciples, have only recently signed or
have low ratings.

The companies are being consid
ered in three batches. Later this month,
the commission will decide whether to
sell Stanford's stock in nine companies
— in time for the trustees' December
meeting. In early December, the CIR
will prepare recommendations on 13
companies for the trustees' February
meeting.
Hillier expects the CIR to be gener
ally supportive of withdrawal resolu
tions, but said some resolutions set un
reasonable timetables for withdrawal
and others would affect companies that
Hillier calls "exceptional" and
"aggressive" opponents of apartheid.
