The University's Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) will consider divestment
from an unprecedented number of companies
during the 1986-87 school year and will vote on a
record number of stockholder resolutions.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier foresees a de
manding quarter: "I think the first half of this year
is very probably the busiest ... the CIR has ever
had, because we are working so hard on selective
divestment and the disinvestment issue."
Last school year, the CIR made three divest
ment recommendations to the Board of Trustees.
A month into this quarter, the CIR has already
voted for divestment from two companies, al
though Stanford had already sold its stock in
Loctite Corp.
The trustees have followed each of the recom
mendations, agreeing to buy no stock in Loctite
and divesting from four companies —
Schlumberger Ltd., Diamond Shamrock Corp.,
Grey Advertising and Newmont Mining.
The CIR has at least 22 other candidates for di
vestment that are being analyzed to determine

their net effect on South African society, Hillier
said.
That undertaking dwarfs the number
scrutinized last year, Hillier said, and puts the CIR
much closer to its goal of systematically reviewing
all South Africa-related companies in the Univer
sity's portfolio.
Stanford owns approximately $189 million of
stock in 66 companies that do business in South
Africa.
One factor accounting for this rapid growth in
the number of companies under CIR considera
tion is having established criteria for selective di
vestment. Hillier said last year's CIR spent half the
year formulating those criteria.
In addition, the CIR has five returning mem
bers and a substantial information base on com
panies with South Africa operations — compiled
by the the Investment Responsibility Task Force,
the ClR's arm for research and administrative
tasks.
Hillier also predicts that almost every South
Africa-related company in which Stanford owns
stock will face a stockholder-sponsored disinvest-
