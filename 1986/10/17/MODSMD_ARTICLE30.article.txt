# Spikers fight for conference lead
## Trojans, Bruins at Maples 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
There is some good news and some
bad news concerning Stanford
women's volleyball as the team enters
the second half of its 30-game
schedule. The good news is really
quite good. The bad news isn't really
too bad.
Thus weekend at Maples Pavilion, all
the news could become good, or it
could become bad, as the spikers host
conference foes USC tonight at 7:30
p.m. and UCLA tomorrow at the same
time.
Let's go with the bad news first. The
Cardinal, which lost only eight matches
during the 1984 and 1985 regular
seasons, has already lost six of 15 this
fall. Most programs would be content
with a 9-6 record against verv stiff com
petition and in a year where new team
leaders and strategies have had to be
established. But with three of its losses
going the full five games, it is under
standable that Stanford is a little disap
pointed and frustrated.
Now, the good news, which makes it
easy to ignore the bad news: The Card
inal is 5-1 in Pacific 10 Conference
play, second place in the standings Ac
cording to Stanford Coach Don Shaw, a
first or second place finish in one of
the top two leagues in the nation
would assure the team of a spot in

post-season play. Should the squad
drop down to third or fourth by the
end of the season, it would still have a
chance to make the NCAAs, though the
odds would not be very good.
Stanford is currently ranked No. 13
in the NCAA poll and No. 12 in the Col
lege Volleyball Coaches Association
poll. According to Shaw, the Cardinal's
ranking would come into play only if it
did not finish first or second in the Pac
-10.
Shaw has set progressive goals for

his team. He has the spikers aiming
first for the NCAAs, and then for the
Final Four, at which they would, of
course, be going after the national
championship. The team's record and
rankings, therefore, do not matter un
less they have a bearing on whether or
not Stanford qualifies for the NCAA
regionals.
Last weekend, the Cardinal finished
second in the Josten's Invitational,
losing in four games to No. 3 San Jose
State in the tournament final.

No. 4 UCLA will be bringing with it a
6-0 Pac-10 record, which puts it alone
at the top of the conference standings.
Tonight, the Cardinal will face a USC
team that has not lived up to the
storied past of Trojan volleyball and is
all by itself in the basement of the Pac
10.
The Bruins lost All-America Liz
Masakayan to graduation, but return
hitters Jenny Crocker and Lisa Ettes
