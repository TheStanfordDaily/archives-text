It is the way of sport. The Califor
nia Angels could have used a whole
year to recover from their devastat
ing loss in game 5 of the Ameri
can League playoffs.
They had a day.
The Stanford men's soccer team
faces much the same task. After a
tough 1-0 loss to St. Mary's Wednes
day in its conference opener, the
Cardinal will try to bounce back to
morrow on Maloney Field at 2 p.m.
against nationally ranked Nevada-
Las Vegas.
"Practice today (yesterday) was
very rejuvenating. We put Wednes
day's game out of our minds and
were very intense. Everybody
worked hard," said starting
midfielder Kevin Woodhouse, a
sophomore.
The Cardinal will need to put out
that same kind of effort Saturday if it
intends to turn things around
agianst the Runnin' Rebels.
"UNLV is a great team," sopho
more backup fallback Jim Killfoil
said. "We're excited about playing
them. We seem to play our best
against the better teams. We
prepare ourselves better mentally.
Maybe we even overlooked St.
Mary's a little. When we decide to
play well, we do, like our effort in
the UCLA game."
Killfoil was referring to Stan
ford's opening match in the Pacific
10 Conference Tournament Sept.
26. The Cardinal looked impressive

in a 2-0 loss to national power
UCLA A similar performance could
put Stanford back in the win
column tomorrow, but UNLV will
provide a special challenge.
"They are a really high-powered
team. They'll hit hard and tackle
hard. They will play a lot like what a
German soccer team would play
like in my mind," Woodhouse said.
Lest there be any question about
exactly what Woodhouse meant,
Killfoil was not at a loss for words.
"They play physical," he said.
Period. End of quote.
The Cardinal, however, will not
just be battling UNLV tomorrow;
the team will be battling itself.
"We seem to pick up our play
when we jump ahead early. We've
had trouble when we get a goal
down," Killfoil said.
Indeed Stanford has not been
able to come from behind to win a
single game this season. The Card
inal has the ability to reverse this
trend, but the mental side will have
to surface for it come back, if
necessary.
"We have to decide when we step
on the field Saturday whether or
not we're going to win the game,"
Woodhouse said.
"We feel we didn't play as well as
we could have Wednesday and lost
to a team we should have beaten,"
he added.
The Cardinal takes into the UNLV
game a tough loss that came on a
shot, though a good one, that was
deflected into the net.
