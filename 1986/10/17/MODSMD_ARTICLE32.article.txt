# Stanford, Cal meet in women's soccer
## 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
It will be "Big Game" time for the
Stanford women's soccer team tomor
row as the Cardinal faces the tough
California Golden Bears at 11 a.m. on
Maloney Field.
The game promises to be one of the
most difficult matches of the year for
Stanford. The Bears are currently
ranked No. 2 in the nation.
In addition to being a top-10 team,
the Bears' record is an impressive 11-1-
1. Cal lost its season opener and tied its
second game. Since then, the Bears
have won 11 games in a row.
"They play with skill," said Cardinal
freshman Tonya Antonucci, who is
presently tied with Amy Geisse for the
club leadership in goals. "And they've
got a lot of talented players."
The key to a strong offense will be at
least partly mental for Stanford tomor
row. "We need more than one goal to
win," Antonucci said "We need to play
with our minds in the game for 90
minutes."
The Cardinal offense will have to at
tack from every position in order to

stay ahead of the efficient Cal team.
The Bears' veteran goalkeeper, Mary
Harvey, may make the goal a very
elusive target, however. Harvey's ef
forts have led to five shutouts in a row
for the Bears. She allows an average of
only .46 goals per game and has ac
cumulated 49 saves this season.
If Cal has any weakness at all, it may
be in its defensive line, but the for
midable presence of Harvey balances
the defense well.
The Cardinal defense will be focus
ing some attention on Bear high
scorer, Brandi Chastain. She leads Cali
fornia in two offensive categories, with
12 goals and nine assists this fall.
Chastain will be facing a resolute
Stanford defense in the form of full
backs Hilary Turner, Christine Martin
and Chris Scott and Vija Brookshire,
Stanford's spirited goalkeeper.
Stanford and Cal are both young
teams. The Bears are starting five fresh
men this season. A match between two
such teams will usually be won by the
most determined squad.
"If everybody comes out ready to
play 100 percent, we can play well
against them and even beat them," An
tonucci said. "They're not unbeatable."
