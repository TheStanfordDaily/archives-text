# Field hockey wins third in a row
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
In its previous two games, 1-0 wins over the Uni
versity of the Pacific and Chico State, the Stanford
field hockey team had been carried by its defense.
But yesterday against St. Louis University, the Card
inal offense came to life, scoring two first-half goals
to record a 2-0 home victory.
The non-conference win extended Stanford's win
ning streak to three games and upped its overall
record to 5-4-1. St. Louis fell to 10-3.
The Cardinal's first goal, at the 12:59 mark of the
first half, came on a perfect short-corner play. Ami
Chitwood took the corner, passing to Mary Good
man, who trapped the ball.
Andi Wolpert then faked a slap shot and flipped a
pass to Dana Goodman on the right. Goodman
flicked the ball right back to Wolpert in the middle,
and the Stanford captain rifled a shot past St. Louis
goalkeeper Wendy Sammons for a 1-0 Cardinal lead.
It was Wolpert's third goal of the season.
"That's one of our corner options — to get Andi

open in the middle," Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson
said. "Andi has the hardest shot on the team."
Wolpert also figured in Stanford's other goal. With
less than seven minutes left in the half, Wolpert fired
another powerful shot that beat Sammons but hit the
left post and bounced straight out in front. Kathy
Thomas was able to win the ensuing scramble for the
rebound and score her second goal of the year.
"It was much better today," Johnson said of the
Stanford offense. "It was much more of a team ef
fort."
Meanwhile, the Cardinal defense was turning in
another ho-hum perfect performance. Goalkeeper
Karen Jones and the rest of the defense turned in
their third consecutive shutout.
Stanford has not allowed a goal since Oct. 1, when
the Cardinal suffered a 3-1 loss to San Jose State — a
game Jones would rather forget. "My confidence
really went down after that," she said. "It was a bad
game for all of us. They're not a very strong team, but
they just walked all over us."
No one is walking over the Stanford defense now.
"The defense is really solid," Johnson said. "We're

trying to use the concept of the whole team playing
defense, with the forwards attacking the ball."
Stanford will be back in action today at 1 p.m.
when it travels to Berkeley to meet Chico State in the
first game of the California Invitational. Joining the
Cardinal and the Wildcats will be St. Louis, California,
San Jose State, UOP and Simon-Fraser.
All five of the teams from the Northern Pacific Con
ference will be playing in the tournament this
weekend. It might seem strange to have five teams
from one league in the same tournament, but in this
case it is somewhat necessary. "You have to play Divi
sion I teams for the games to count on your record,"
Johnson said. "And we're pretty much the only ones
out here (on the West Coast)."
Card notes
The Billikens managed only seven shots against
Jones. The only thing that gave them more trouble
than the Cardinal defense was trying to figure out just
what a Billiken is (a "small elf-like thing" was the
final consensus).
