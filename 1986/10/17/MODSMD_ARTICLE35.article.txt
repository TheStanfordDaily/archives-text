# Guest Greek (7-13) looks to Brennan
## 
### 
The Guest Greek continued to
stumble last week as Stanford Baseball
Coach Mark Marquess went 3-7 in his
predictions, dropping the guest to a
cumulative 7-13 for the season.
Leading the Daily's Greek of the
Week competition after two weeks are
sports editor Ken Stevens and field
hockey writer Tom Senf at 12-8.
, Stevens, who received much
criticism, including cries of treason,
when he picked Washington to defeat
Stanford, benefitted from that pick,
though he erroneously chose Oregon
to upset Arizona St.
Senf, who along with Stevens has re
corded consecutive 6-4 weeks to vault
to first place, deserves special mention
once again. Last week he was listed as a
sports writer, but this week he comes
under the heading of "field hockey
writer."
It seems that Senf — a former sports
editor, Card Today editor and baseball
beat writer — was disappointed that
each of the other resident Greeks'
headings were specific, and his was
rather vague. Hence, with hesitation,
he turned his attention momentarily
from his field hockey beat to notify us
of our error. Due to his unusual devo
tion to The Daily, the correction was
immediately made.
Last year's Greek champion, football
writer John Lis, is buried at the bottom
!of the standings this year with a 10-10
record, leading only the Guest Greek.
He vows, however, to doctor the
'schedule in the near future (i.e. pick
games that only he, and certainly no
!normal sports fan, knows anything

about), so soon he will be back on top
of the pack.
This week's Guest Greek is Stanford
Women's Tennis Coach Frank Brennan.
Due to Marquess' subpar performance
last week, The Daily decided to give
the Cardinal coaching corps another
chance, which Brennan was glad to ac
cept.
Of his colleague's effort last week,
Brennan said: "I can't do worse than
Marquess. An ex-quarterback ... no
wonder he went to baseball."
Brennan, however, does not predict
great results for himself. "Stanford
coach makes fool of himself in front of
entire student body," he joked.
Brennan has three upset specials:
Tennessee over Alabama 21-20, Baylor
over Texas A&M 24-21 and North
Carolina State over North Carolina 21-
20.
Greek Notes
Card Today editor Chris Fialko had
no explanation for his 0-0 prediction
for the Cornell-Brown game. Should
his pick be correct, he will automati
cally be awarded a case of Henry Wein
hard's Private Reserve, the same prize
which is given to the overall Greek
winner.
Erik Sten's picks this week are really
the work of Daily feature editor Chris
Myers. Sten, who led after one week
with a 7-3 mark, fell to 11-9 overall last
week. Myers is a former sports writer.
Sports editor Susan Slusser wanted
to pick the Red Sox in every game until
we informed her that Spike Owen
does not play football.

The Guest Greek continued to
stumble last week as Stanford Baseball
Coach Mark Marquess went 3-7 in his
predictions, dropping the guest to a
cumulative 7-13 for the season.
Leading the Daily's Greek of the
Week competition after two weeks are
sports editor Ken Stevens and field
hockey writer Tom Senf at 12-8.
, Stevens, who received much
criticism, including cries of treason,
when he picked Washington to defeat
Stanford, benefitted from that pick,
though he erroneously chose Oregon
to upset Arizona St.
Senf, who along with Stevens has re
corded consecutive 6-4 weeks to vault
to first place, deserves special mention
once again. Last week he was listed as a
sports writer, but this week he comes
under the heading of "field hockey
writer."
It seems that Senf — a former sports
editor, Card Today editor and baseball
beat writer — was disappointed that
each of the other resident Greeks'
headings were specific, and his was
rather vague. Hence, with hesitation,
he turned his attention momentarily
from his field hockey beat to notify us
of our error. Due to his unusual devo
tion to The Daily, the correction was
immediately made.
Last year's Greek champion, football
writer John Lis, is buried at the bottom
!of the standings this year with a 10-10
record, leading only the Guest Greek.
He vows, however, to doctor the
'schedule in the near future (i.e. pick
games that only he, and certainly no
!normal sports fan, knows anything

about), so soon he will be back on top
of the pack.
This week's Guest Greek is Stanford
Women's Tennis Coach Frank Brennan.
Due to Marquess' subpar performance
last week, The Daily decided to give
the Cardinal coaching corps another
chance, which Brennan was glad to ac
cept.
Of his colleague's effort last week,
Brennan said: "I can't do worse than
Marquess. An ex-quarterback ... no
wonder he went to baseball."
Brennan, however, does not predict
great results for himself. "Stanford
coach makes fool of himself in front of
entire student body," he joked.
Brennan has three upset specials:
Tennessee over Alabama 21-20, Baylor
over Texas A&M 24-21 and North
Carolina State over North Carolina 21-
20.
Greek Notes
Card Today editor Chris Fialko had
no explanation for his 0-0 prediction
for the Cornell-Brown game. Should
his pick be correct, he will automati
cally be awarded a case of Henry Wein
hard's Private Reserve, the same prize
which is given to the overall Greek
winner.
Erik Sten's picks this week are really
the work of Daily feature editor Chris
Myers. Sten, who led after one week
with a 7-3 mark, fell to 11-9 overall last
week. Myers is a former sports writer.
Sports editor Susan Slusser wanted
