# McCarthy issues challenge
## 
### MARK LEMLEY 
In a campaign appearance Wednesday at Florence
Moore Hall, Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy went
on the offensive, attacking his opponent, former Republi
can Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, for refusing to debate or appear
at press conferences.
Speaking before a crowd of approximately 100,
McCarthy said, "Mike Curb's refusal to confront me in a
debate and confront the California media in an open ex
change betrays a failure of the unique test of character
imposed by public campaigns in our democracy."
McCarthy is running for re-election to the post which
he has held since 1982. His main opponent, Curb, has
refused to debate or to hold press conferences, utilizing
instead a series of 30-second television ads to advance
his campaign.
Spokesmen for Curb would not comment on the can
didate's refusal to debate.
McCarthy faced questions from a panel of local jour
nalists and student leaders. Questions focused on
McCarthy's support for the reconfirmation of all justices
on the California Supreme Court, including Rose Bird.
Bird and two other justices, Joseph Grodin and Cruz
Reynoso, have come under fire by those hoping to
prevent their reconfirmation. Curb has directed atten
tion to McCarthy's support, claiming that it shows
McCarthy is out of step with the people of California.

McCarthy said that, while he probably would not have
appointed Bird, he feels the issue is "not (the judges')
stand on the death penalty or any other issue but their
competence to serve on the Court." He said he considers
all the justices qualified.
McCarthy also mentioned his support for the death
penalty. Asked whether this was a political move (he
opposed the death penalty in 1982), McCarthy said that it
represents "a gradual evolution of my beliefs." If -he
wanted to change his mind ro advance his political
career, "1982 would have been the logical time" to do
so, McCarthy said.
McCarthy said he has taken a stand on all the statewide
propositions facing California voters, with the exception
of Proposition 65, the toxics initiative. McCarthy an
nounced his intention to release a statement on that
issue today.
Contrasting his record with that of his Republican op
ponent, McCarthy said he "had been able to work well
with (current Gov. George) Deukmejian" in spite of the
fact that he is a Democrat and Deukmejian a Republican.
Curb was criticized during his term of office for attempt
ing to alter Democratic Governor Edmund ("Jerry")
Brown's policies whenever Brown left the state. Lt. Gov.
McCarthy said that the offices of Lt. Governor and Gover 7
nor were distinct, and that electing a Republican to one
was not incompatible with electing a Democrat to the
other.
