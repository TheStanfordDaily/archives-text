The Board of Trustees' charge
to the CIR instructs it to consider
"the opinions expressed within
the Stanford community," and
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier
takes that responsibility
seriously.
Hillier served as CIR chairman
from 1977 to 1979. "That really
sensitized me to the fact that we
are representative of the Stan
ford community."
He encourages community
members to submit written
comments to his mailbox in the
Terman Building, room 407.
They may also be mailed to
Frederick Hillier; Operations
Research; Terman Building;
Stanford.
