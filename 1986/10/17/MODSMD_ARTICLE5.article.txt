# Tax laws affect grad students
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
New tax laws will bring radical changes to
graduate students' financial support, espe
cially for research and teaching assistantships,
the vice provost and dean of graduate studies
reported to the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The tax reform makes "more radical
changes than had been anticipated from prior
House and Senate discussion," Elizabeth
Traugott said.
Tuition, which is awarded for an assis-

tantship appointment, will also be taxable un
der one section of the tax law. But Traugott
said the University expects to be able to ex
empt the first $5,250 under the provisions of
the act.
"The new act will make stipends paid for
'service' taxable, regardless of whether or not
such service is a degree requirement,"
Traugott said.
Scholarships and fellowships were previ
ously exempt from taxation, but the amount
exceeding tuition will now become taxable,
minus "course-related expenses," like books,

fees and supplies, she said.
It is not clear what is exactly meant by
"course-related expenses," nor whether the
individual or school will determine the
amount, she added.
The new federal tax code should not affect
students who received fellowship awards for
the 1986-87 school year, she said. The law
states that all awards for this year made prior
to Aug. 16 are not subject to taxation.
Traugott emphasized that her report is pre-
liminary, and that "a number of issues
are yet to be clarified."
Also, all forms of support for stu
dents who are not pursuing a degree,
who include non-matriculated
graduate students and postdoctoral
scholars, will be taxed after Jan. 1,
1987.
This does not represent a change for
doctoral scholars whose stipend is
already taxable.
In other business at the Faculty Sen

ate meeting, a survey shows MIT and
Berkeley as Stanford's main competi
tion in attracting graduate students, re
ported Arthur Bryson, chairman of the
Committee on Graduate Studies.
The survey, prepared by the
Graduate Administrative Center,
showed MIT and Berkeley are fol
lowed by Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Cal
Tech and Cornell in their popularity
with graduate students.
MIT and Berkeley were the prime
competitors for the School of Engi
neering, he said.
Professional programs in business,
law and medicine at other schools

"seem to provide negligible competi
tion to Stanford," the report said.
At the close of the meeting, English
Prof. John Bender criticized the design
of the Near West Campus Plan as
"narrow" and "cliched" and said a
committee plan has left little room for
architectural freedom.
Ray Bacchetti, vice provost and
director of University budgets, and Phil
Williams, director of University plan
ning, presented the master plan of the
Near West campus, the proposed $250
million redevelopment of Stanford's
41-acre science and engineering
region.
