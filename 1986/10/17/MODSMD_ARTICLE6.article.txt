# Manzanita furnaces require replacement
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Students in nine Manzanita Park trailers were
informed this week about "potentially danger
ous" problems with their furnaces, according to
University officials. Housing and Food Services
staff members have known since August that the
furnaces had cracks that might possibly leak car
bon monoxide gas.
Chris Griffith, assistant director of graduate
residences, said she sent notices to affected resi
dents on Tuesday advising them that "under no
circumstances" should diey turn on their heat.
The students were also offered space heaters to
use until their nautural gas heaters are replaced.
But the warning came weeks after students like
Tracy King, a second-year MBA student, began
using the defective furnaces. King, who has used
the furnace in her trailer since school started, said
it bothered her "a great deal" not to have been in
formed of the problem before this week.

Facilities Manager Bob Mibach said students
were told to contact his office to get their heaters
turned on. Griffith, who handles residential edu
cation for Manzanita Park, said students were not
instructed to contact anyone for heat. She said
that the maintenance staff turns the heat on or off
when the season changes.
The furnace in King's trailer was replaced Tues
day, the same day the other affected residents
were sent notices about the problem. All of the
defective furnaces have cracked fireboxes.
The firebox is part of the furnace normally sur
rounded by the outer metal sides of the furnace.
In the furnace removed from King's trailer, there
was a circular opening, about six inches in
diameter, which allowed access to the inside of
the firebox, where the pilot would be lit.
With a flashlight, a two-inch crack could be
seen in the wall of the firebox from King's
furnace.
The University has only two other replacement heaters on
hand, according to Mibach. He said he hoped to replace the
other six heaters "by the end of next week.''
The defective heaters are all Intertherm units which have
been in the trailers since they were first used as student
housing 16 years ago. The replacement heaters are also In
tertherm models which are only available from one manu
facturer, Mibach said.
The cracks were discovered in preventative maintenance
inspections in August, Mibach said. He contended that "the
cracks are not large enough to create any sort of a prob
lem," but that they were being replaced "to be on the safe
side."
Cracks in a furnace firebox are "very dangerous" accord
ing to Walt Boothe of Climate Service Corp. in San Jose, a
local heater sales and service company. Boothe said firebox
cracks could either leak carbon monoxide or let in oxygen
to the flame in the firebox, potentially causing the unit to
overheat and catch on fire.
Boothe said much of his company's business comes from
people whose natural gas heaters have been shut off by the
utility company because of firebox cracks.
Bill Leonard, a spokesman for Pacific Gas And Electric
Company, confirmed that his company does cut off the gas
to a residential furnace with firebox cracks until the unit is
replaced. He declined to define what size crack would be
considered dangerous enough to warrant disconnection,
saying that judgement would be made by service personnel
at the scene.
Ed Cannon, maintenance supervisor for Manzanita said
that his staff did not light the pilot of any furnace with a
cracked firebox. King said the heater in her trailer had been
working since the beginning of the year and that she and
her roomates had only had to adjust their thermostat to get
heat.
Keith Guy, University director of Housing and Food
Services, said he did not know specifically what had been
said to students about the heaters because he is fairly new to
his position. However, he said that if students had not been
informed of a potential hazard in this situation, that would
not be the case in the future.
