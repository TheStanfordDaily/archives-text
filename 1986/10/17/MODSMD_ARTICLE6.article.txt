# Manzanita furnaces require replacement
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Students in nine Manzanita Park trailers were
informed this week about "potentially danger
ous" problems with their furnaces, according to
University officials. Housing and Food Services
staff members have known since August that the
furnaces had cracks that might possibly leak car
bon monoxide gas.
Chris Griffith, assistant director of graduate
residences, said she sent notices to affected resi
dents on Tuesday advising them that "under no
circumstances" should diey turn on their heat.
The students were also offered space heaters to
use until their nautural gas heaters are replaced.
But the warning came weeks after students like
Tracy King, a second-year MBA student, began
using the defective furnaces. King, who has used
the furnace in her trailer since school started, said
it bothered her "a great deal" not to have been in
formed of the problem before this week.

Facilities Manager Bob Mibach said students
were told to contact his office to get their heaters
turned on. Griffith, who handles residential edu
cation for Manzanita Park, said students were not
instructed to contact anyone for heat. She said
that the maintenance staff turns the heat on or off
when the season changes.
The furnace in King's trailer was replaced Tues
day, the same day the other affected residents
were sent notices about the problem. All of the
defective furnaces have cracked fireboxes.
The firebox is part of the furnace normally sur
rounded by the outer metal sides of the furnace.
In the furnace removed from King's trailer, there
was a circular opening, about six inches in
diameter, which allowed access to the inside of
the firebox, where the pilot would be lit.
With a flashlight, a two-inch crack could be
seen in the wall of the firebox from King's
furnace.
