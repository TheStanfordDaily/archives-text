# Student pub possible in Encina by Nov.
## 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
Plans are on tap for a student-run campus pub
that could open in Encina Station within a month,,
student organizers and University officials said
last night.
According to Graduate Student Association
Vice President Vip Tolat, GSA officials and Tresid
der Union Director Ellie Oppenheim will meet
today and next week to discuss the logistics of the
proposal. "At this point, we're still working out
the details," Tolat said.
Currently, plans call for a pub with "a Corner
Pocket-style management" diat will be open on
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. The pub will
serve alcohol, but Tolat said a system for checking
identification has yet to be worked out.
Larry Lessard, chair of the GSA's Pub Commit
tee, also stressed that the planning of the pub is in
its preliminary stages. "There's no pub yet, and it
still might be that we don't get a pub," he said.
According to Lessard and Tolat, a major prob
lem is finding funds for the venture. Tolat said he
expected the pub to receive financial support
from the University, the GSA and possibly the
ASSU.
"We've worked closely with (COP member)
Carey White since the summer," Lessard said.
"We're all working toward the same goal."
White called the pub "a program very deserv
ing of funding. This is really a tremendous
breakthrough." He said the venture may receive a
loan and publicity assistance from the ASSU, an
aid program similar to the one the student-run
espresso bar received last year.
White also said a popular pub would show Uni
versity administrators that students are capable of
managing their own business successfully.
Oppenheim said she was "very enthusiastic"
about the idea of a campus pub but said more
meetings are necessary. "This is essentially a trial
venture to learn more about what student interest
is and to try and come up with something suc
cessful," she said.
Organizers will also need to decide on the es
tablishment's specific menu, according to Oppen
heim.
Another difficulty in the organization of the
pub is finding a suitable setting. "We have no
sense of ideal location," Oppenheim said.
Lessard agreed. "We need a better place," he
said, noting that the campus is "very short on

space right now."
He said Encina Station could become the per
manent location for the bar. He also mentioned
the Old Firehouse as a possible site, although he
said a possible move there would be far in the
future.
According to Tolat, the desire to organize the
pub grew out of a dissatisfaction with the Coffee
House. The Coffee House "is not a very lively
place," he said. "It wasn't fulfilling a need;
graduate students need some place to gather."
The pub will likely have some form of enter
tainment, although Lessard was unsure as to what
type of music will be played. "We're still figuring
out ways to create liveliness," Tolat said.

Both Tolat and Lessard said student input
would he crucial to the puh's success. "There's
been a lot of student interest," Lessard said. Tolat
said the University administration supports the ef
fort.
White and other members of the COP formed a
task force two weeks ago to look into the
feasibility of establishing a student-run pub on
campus. The idea "met with more instant support
than anything the ASSU's ever proposed," he
wrote in an information sheet for students inter
ested in the task force.
White said last night he and other members of
the COP, along with the student task force, would
work closely with Tolat, Lessard and the rest of
the GSA.
"I'm delighted the GSA has taken the initiative,"
White said. "When everybody works together,
things like this start happening."
