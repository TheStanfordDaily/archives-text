# Forum will consider future of campus fraternities
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy, along
with other University officials and two guest
speakers from the University of Rochester, will
discuss the future of fraternities both
nationwide and at Stanfoid this afternoon in an
open forum intended to respond to the "need
to get people talking," according to Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano.
Stanford officials scheduled to speak are
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Diana Conklin and Pisano.
The purpose of the forum is to improve rela
tions between Stanford fraternities and the
community, according to Pisano. "There's an
estrangement right now, an insidious di
chotomy, a sense of us-them— The idea is to
do something constructive," Pisano said, add
ing that the forum is n<x a reaction to recent

problems with fraternities.
The forum, to be held at 4 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium, is open to all interested students
and members of the community. Time has
been allotted for an open discussion during the
event.
Lyons is scheduled to open the forum, fol
lowed by Pisano, who wili present his six fun
damental principles for fraternities and
sororities. The principles define the proper re
lationship between universities and Greek or
ganizations, according to Pisano.
He said the principles apply to fraternities
and sororities anywhere, but he plans to tailor
his remarks to Stanford
Peter Kountz, the dean of students at
Rochester and David Faris, Theta Delta Chi un
dergraduate president at Rochester, plan to
present a case study of the failure and subse
quent success of a fraternity, based on their ex
periences earlier this year.

Last spring, the Theta Delts at Rochester were
suspended after a "series of anti-social actions"
by members, including a fight involving at least
five actives, according to Kountz.
After losing their housing and recognition in
February, the Theta Delts appealed the decision
and returned to campus this fall.
Pisano, who was a Theta Delt at Rochester
and the national president of Theta Delta Chi,
said he thought of the forum after working with
Kountz and Faris to develop a plan for "the
education of the Theta Delts" at Rochester last
spring.
"People learned a lot about how fraternities
can exist ideally and how they can get in trou
ble — and if they do (get in trouble), how to
return successfully," Pisano said.
Kennedy is scheduled to address the audi
ence because "he is concerned. It's a priority,"
Pisano said.
Stanford fraternity presidents will bring to

the forum differing opinions regarding the
future of fraternities here.
"Very shaky" was how Phi Delta Theta Presi
dent Stephen Modory described the future.
"There is some question as to whether or not
(housed) fraternities will continue to exist at
Stanford."
"My own opinion is that there's no way the
[Delta Upsilon] or the [Zeta Psi] fraternities will
ever get their houses back. I'd love it if they
would, but I don't think they will."
"There will be a time when the University
will have to make an all-or-nothing decision
about whether or not the fraternities can stay in
their houses," said Modory. According to
Modory, more problems have occurred with
housed fraternities because "a lot of freedom"
accompanies ownership of a house.
"A lot of stuff that was being put up with isn't
being put up with anymore," said Theta Delta
Chi president Jim Flanigon. Fraternities and the

University will have to work together, accord
ing to Flanigon. "They're not separate entities,"
he said.
Delta Kappa Epsilon president John Donald
is optimistic. "The future is OK," said Donald.
"I don't see any immediate danger of extinc
tion. If the University wanted to abolish them,
they could pretty quickly. But most fraternities
are a positive force on campus."
"Basically I think the future is bright," Pisano
agreed. "Sometimes some of the behavior
problems erode my optimism I'm initially
astonished at some of the incidents."
"But on the whole, the fraternity members
... make things happen. If they decide to play
an active, positive part in the community they
can, and can do it very quickly,' Pisano said.
The fraternity issue came to a head last
Thursday when Stanford suspended the Phi
Delts.

suspended after a "series of anti-social actions"
by members, including a fight involving at least
five actives, according to Kountz.
After losing their housing and recognition in
February, the Theta Delts appealed the decision
and returned to campus this fall.
Pisano, who was a Theta Delt at Rochester
and the national president of Theta Delta Chi,
said he thought of the forum after working with
Kountz and Faris to develop a plan for "the
education of the Theta Delts" at Rochester last
spring.
"People learned a lot about how fraternities
can exist ideally and how they can get in trou
ble — and if they do (get in trouble), how to
return successfully," Pisano said.
Kennedy is scheduled to address the audi
ence because "he is concerned. It's a priority,"
Pisano said.
Stanford fraternity presidents will bring to

the forum differing opinions regarding the
future of fraternities here.
"Very shaky" was how Phi Delta Theta Presi
dent Stephen Modory described the future.
"There is some question as to whether or not
(housed) fraternities will continue to exist at
Stanford."
"My own opinion is that there's no way the
[Delta Upsilon] or the [Zeta Psi] fraternities will
ever get their houses back. I'd love it if they
would, but I don't think they will."
"There will be a time when the University
will have to make an all-or-nothing decision
about whether or not the fraternities can stay in
their houses," said Modory. According to
Modory, more problems have occurred with
housed fraternities because "a lot of freedom"
accompanies ownership of a house.
"A lot of stuff that was being put up with isn't
being put up with anymore," said Theta Delta
Chi president Jim Flanigon. Fraternities and the

University will have to work together, accord
ing to Flanigon. "They're not separate entities,"
he said.
Delta Kappa Epsilon president John Donald
is optimistic. "The future is OK," said Donald.
"I don't see any immediate danger of extinc
tion. If the University wanted to abolish them,
they could pretty quickly. But most fraternities
are a positive force on campus."
"Basically I think the future is bright," Pisano
agreed. "Sometimes some of the behavior
problems erode my optimism I'm initially
astonished at some of the incidents."
"But on the whole, the fraternity members
... make things happen. If they decide to play
an active, positive part in the community they
can, and can do it very quickly,' Pisano said.
The fraternity issue came to a head last
Thursday when Stanford suspended the Phi
Delts.
