Reagan to sign immigration law
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday pledged to sign sweeping
immigration reform legislation, but a final Senate vote to send it to his desk
hit a snag when a conservative opponent refused to cut short debate on the
measure.
The bill, designed to curb the influx of illegal aliens by outlawing their
hiring, breezed through a test vote by 75 to 21, indicating sponsors not
only had the strength to pass the measure but also to force an end to efforts
to throw procedural roadblocks in its path.
The immigration legislation, which has been debated in various forms
by Congress for 15 years, seeks to discourage aliens from entering the
country illegally by cutting down on the jobs that attract them. Employers
would face hefty fines and even jail terms for hiring someone they knew
was an illegal alien.
Also included is a generous amnesty provision that offers legal residency
to undocumented aliens who have been in the country since Jan. 1, 1982.
Anti-drug bill sent to president
WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators agreed yesterday on
legislative sleight of hand that would allow comprehensive anti-drug legis
lation to be sent to President Reagan for approval without a controversial
House-passed provision imposing the death penalty for some drug-related
crimes.
The complicated arrangement worked out by the conferees would ac
complish that without forcing the House to back down from its insistence
on including capital punishment in the bill. The House would approve the
death penalty provision as separate legislation, and the Senate could then
pass the basic bill and send it to Reagan.
The House and Senate were expected to take final votes as early as last
night.
The deal on capital punishment, which was struck in closed negotiations
between House and Senate leaders of both parties, could end the parrying
that had threatened to kill drug legislation, which is a top political priority
in this election year.
The Senate had earlier removed from the bill provisions that would have
required the military to chase and arrest drug smugglers and allowed
courts to use, under some circumstances, evidence that would otherwise
be considered illegal. It had also voted to substitute mandatory life im
prisonment for those crimes — murders that are ordered or committed by
drug "kingpins" — that would be punishable by death under the
original amendment.
U.S. airfields supplied contras
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Documents recovered from a C-123K cargo
plane shot down Oct. 5 in southern Nicaragua show that a secret air
resupply operation for the Nicaraguan rebels made extensive use of air
fields built for U.S. military exercises in Honduras as well as a commercial
airfield in Costa Rica.
The documents, including flight logs and personal notes and business
cards carried by the three Americans on board, depict an operation involv
ing crew members and airplanes which shifted from private contracts to
U.S. government work, and used facilities in Honduras and Costa Rica as
well as El Salvador described publicly as off-limits to the counterrevolu
tionary rebels, known as contras.
The U.S. government work apparently was legal delivery of humanitarian
aid to the contras authorized by Congress while the contract work involved
clandestine weapoas drops.
In eastern rionduras resupply missions were launched frequently from
Honduran military airfields at Aguacate and Mocoron which were refur
bished through U.S. military exercises. U.S. spokesmen have strongly
denied that the airfields would be available to the contras.
The Nicaraguan Justice Ministry, in a communique released last night,
announced that American Eugene Hasenfus will face trial starting Monday
in the Popular Anti-Somocista Tribunal, a special court for contra col
laborators.
Shultz pledges more quake aid
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said
yesterday that $50 million in emergency aid approved by Congress to help
El Salvador's earthquakes victims was "a down payment" and pledged that
further U.S. assistance would be forthcoming.
At least 976 persons died in the earthquake that registered 5.4 on the
Richter scale, and officials estimate that 31,000 families — most of them
poor — have been left homeless. In addition to the thousands of houses
that collapsed during the quake, scores of hospitals, schools, government
and commercial buildings have been destroyed.
The United States already provides about $500 million annually in mili
tary and economic aid to El Salvador and keeps 55 military advisers sta
tioned here to help run a counterinsurgency campaign against leftist guer
rillas.
On Wednesday, Congress approved $50 million in additional funds to
address the crisis caused by the earthquake.
The country's economic crisis, aggravated by the earthquake, is acute.
During a half-hour meeting with Shultz at the damaged Presidential House,
President Jose Napoleon Duarte said that the Salvadoran government had
only $350,000 cash in the bank.
U.S. and Salvadoran officials say that there is not enough aid to go
around, but many of the homeless say that they believe the aid is coming
and they are not receiving it. They said they hear about generous ship
ments of international aid on the radio, reports that government officials
say are exaggerated and often incorrect.
Clean Water Act passes Senate
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday unanimously passed and sent to
President Reagan an eight-year, $22 billion program to continue cleaning
the nation's rivers and lakes and to help local governments build more
sewage treatment plants.
The bill, known as the Clean Water Act, faces an uncertain fate at the
White House because of its high costs.
At the same time, however, the Reagan administration's opposition to an
other major piece of environmental legislation before him, the Superfund
spending program to clean up toxic waste dumps, appeared to be soften
ing, and a threatened veto seemed to be growing less likely.
Senators voted 96-0 to adopt the same version of the Clean Water Act that
the House had passed unanimously Wednesday. During debate, chief spon
sors of the measure from both parties implored the president to sign it.
The biggest portion of the Clean Water Act provides $18 billion through
1994 for local sewage treatment systems and other projects to curb pollu
tion of the nation's lakes, streams and estuaries.
The legislation also would put federal loan money into state revolving
funds to help finance sewer projects after the federal grant program ends.
France to help U.S. fight terror
WASHINGTON — The conservative French government of Prime Mini
ster Jacques Chirac has agreed to accelerate cooperation with the Reagan
administration in fighting terrorism by improving intelligence exchanges
and law enforcement contacts between Paris and Washington, a leading
French internal security official said yesterday'.
Robert Pandraud, who was appointed special minister last March to lead
the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking, said in an interview that the
measures would bring a "substantial improvement'' in anti-terrorist col
laboration between the two capitals. He said the Chirac government shares
a more common approach with the Reagan administration in both the strat
egy- and tactics of combatting terrorism than its Socialist predecessor.
