STANFORD STUDENTS IN THE HUMANITIES
For All Seniors and Recent Graduates
ANDREW W. MELLON FELLOWSHIPS
Every year the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation offers prestigious fellowships for
graduate study in the humanities to seniors and recent graduates of outstanding <li*y.
Mellon Fellowships are highly competitive and carry an annual stipend of $9,000 plus
tuition and fees. They are open to students in the traditional humanities disciplines,
including history, but not the creative and performing arts, or the social sciences.
American studies, other area studies, and interdisciplinary programs are also eligible if
the emphasis in subject and method is substantially humanistic.
The application procedure for Mellon Fellowships is complex and somewhat
time-consuming, since all candidates must first be nominated by a member of the faculty.
All those who think they might be interested in applying should plan to attend a
brown-bag lunch workshop to be held on Tuesday, October 21st from 12-1 in the
Common Room, First Floor, Sweet Hall.
