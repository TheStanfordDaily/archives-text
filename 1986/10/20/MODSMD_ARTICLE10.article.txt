This piece on the Reach Out Today
is the most recent installment in The
Daily's Public Service series, which
will appear irregularly throughout
the volume.
More than 800 Stanford students
reached out Saturday to the sur
rounding community, taking pan in
the Stanford Volunteer Network's
(SVN) annual Reach Out Today
public service program.
"The goal of Reach Out Today is to
expose as many students as possible
to the challenging and rewarding na
ture of volunteer work so they will
become more sensitized to the
needs of the surrounding commu
nity, said Nina Teicholz, chairper
son of the board of directors for the
SVN.
"We will now work with dorms to
set up long term projects with a com
munity agency," she added.
Turnout for this year's event was
the highest in its three-year history,
Teicholz said.
Among the Reach Out Today proj
ects this years:
• Case Zapata residents did restora
tion work at the East Palo Alto Senior
Center.

• Branner Hall sponsored a carnival
for the Children's Hospital at Stan
ford.
• Naranja and Trancos assisted the
American Red Cross with CPR train
ing.
• Lagunita West walked door to door
in the East Palo Alto community to
inform residents of free legal
services available to them through
the East Palo Alto Community Law
Project.
• Roble held a picnic for kids on the
waiting list for the Big Brother/Big
Sister program.
According to a press release from
the SVN, the event strives to make
Stanford students aware of the
human needs of the surrounding
community and to create service
programs that respond to these
needs.
The group also attempts to edu
cate the Stanford community about
the necessity of public service by
facilitating educational programs
and promoting committed volunteer
service.
Encouraging communication and
ccKjperation between existing public
service groups and introducing
community service to groups not
presently involved is another goal of

the SVN, according to the release.
Several students who participated
in Saturday's event said Reach Out
Today was a beneficial experience.
"Before, when I'd see a problem
in the community, I'd say, 'Okay, this
is wrong but 1 can't really help be
cause I'm only one person,'" said
Kathy Le, a freshman volunteer and
newly-elected community service
representative for Lagunita West.
"Through this project I got in
volved with so many people who are
also doing it that I thought, 'Hey,
maybe we can make a difference,'
Le said.
The project, founded by students
in 1984, developed from an original
idea to create a volunteer opportu
nity clearinghouse for students, ac
cording to an SVN press release.
Throughout the 1984-1985 aca
demic year the SVN expanded by co
ordinating all-campus Reach Out
Todays, establishing a network of
community service representatives
in the dorms, assisting with the im
plementation and continuation of
group service projects — for exam
ple, weekly work at St. Anthony's
Kitchen and tutoring at Brentwood
Oaks — and organizing a holiday
sharing drive, the release said.
