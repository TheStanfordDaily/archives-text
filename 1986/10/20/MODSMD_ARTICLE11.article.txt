# Stanford gets Mellon grant
## 
### JAY FRY 
A new Stanford program funded by
the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
could help influence outstanding un
dergraduate students pursue a career
in the field of teaching.
Using a $500,000 Mellon grant, the
University plans to establish a new
coterminal program in teacher educa
tion for next fall quarter. This program
should "help recruit really outstanding
people in the field of teaching," ac
cording to Education Prof. Nel Nod
dings.
The Mellon Foundation, an organi
zation with an avid, "long-standing" in
terest in bettering education, gave
similar grants to Cornell, Harvard and
Columbia universities, said Noddings,
who will serve as program administra
tor.
Similar coterminal programs already
exist in the education school, but this
will be the first in teacher education,
said Noddings. The program will be
open to 10 students beginning next
September, but exact criteria and
details are still being worked out, she
said.
According to Noddings, undergradu
ates majoring in English, history, math
ematics, biological and physical
sciences and certain foreign languages
will be eligible for the coterminal pro
gram. Accepted students would work
on their undergraduate majors and

their masters degrees in teacher edu
cation concurrently, completing both
in five years.
The fifth year also involves an intern
ship, said Noddings. The coterminal
student would teach two classes in a
public school in the morning while
taking classes in the afternoon.
The grant will allow students to
receive partial financial support for tui
tion during their junior and senior
years, said Noddings. The coterminal
program will provide even more sub
stantial financial support for students
during their fifth year.
The rest of the details are still under
consideration, Noddings said. The edu
cation school will announce die start of
the application procedure during win
ter quarter after the criteria have been
finalized.
Keith Kennedy, provost emeritus of

Cornell, did a large portion of the
work necessary for Stanford and Cor
nell to receive the Mellon Grants, ac
cording to Noddings.
She said she hopes to "stay in com
munication" with Stanford's coter
minal program counterpart at Cornell,
as well as with those of Harvard and
Columbia, through future meetings.
Noddings said Cornell is using its
Mellon Grant for a coterminal program
in teacher education nearly identical to
Stanford's. Stanford's program,
however, will emphasize English and
history, while Cornell's program will
concentrate primarily on math and sci
ence, she said.
The education school is currently
planning a three-year program for 10
students each year, depending on the
financial situation once the program is
underwav.
