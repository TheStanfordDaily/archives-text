## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Trailers an eyesore 
### 
When opened in 1969, Manzanita Park had an ex
pected lifespan of four years. Unfortunately, it has
exceeded all expectations of longevity.
The residences were built in just 120 days as a stopgap
measure to help alleviate an acute housing crunch. While
quality housing for all students remains a much sought
after goal, the tin blunders of Manzanita are no longer a
viable or safe housing option.
The issue of safety is paramount. Last week, the Uni
versity informed Manzanita residents of potentially dan
gerous problems with their furnaces — long after Uni
versity officials had known such problems existed. The
defective heaters could have leaked carbon monoxide or
ignited the trailer, yet the University waited two months
to inform residents of the situation. Such negligence is
inexcusable.
Stanford has pledged to replace the faulty heaters with
new units. This is a move in the right direction. However,
it is ignoring the larger problem: Manzanita Park itself
must be replaced with a larger, more efficient housing
complex.
Manzanita Park stands as the embarrassment of Stan
ford's much-ballyhooed Residential Education program.
Quarters are unbearably cramped. Interaction between
residents, a key component of a healthy residential envi
ronment, is very low and undeniably difficult. Many
trailers are infested with insects. And the unimpressive,
rectangular buildings are not exactly the Farm's most
notable architectural achievement.

Stanford defends the trailers on two grounds: First,
they remain a "popular choice" among students, accord
ing to Stanford's director of housing; second, they help
offset upkeep costs on other newer residences, such as
Governor's Corner, because the trailers cost next to
nothing to maintain.
To say the trailers are a "popular choice" is a gross
overstatement. Manzanita Park has not filled up by the
end of round one of the Draw for the last two years. To
rationalize Manzanita's existence as a cost-cutting
venture is avoiding the real issue. While the trailers may
make money, the University is earning a profit at the ex
pense of students' comfort and safety. Additionally,
building a new complex would be a more efficient use of
the site and allow more students to live in University
housing — and increase revenue.
Stanford needs to put its campaign for quality student
housing in high gear. The recently announced plan for a
new graduate student housing complex along Bowdoin
Street is a step in the right direction, but the University
can do more. After all, it's not as if Stanford is strapped
for funds — the construction of the Center for Integrated
Systems, Governor's Corner, Sweet Hall and the Keck
Science Building within the last six years attest to that.
The University has the resources to guarantee quality
housing for all students who desire it. Manzanita Park is
an eyesore and a hazard. The administration has said it
has no plans for the trailers until at least 1990, but it must
a a sooner than that.
