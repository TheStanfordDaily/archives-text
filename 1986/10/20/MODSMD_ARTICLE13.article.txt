Apartheid is not
a minor problem
Although Victor Vescovo raises an
interesting and important issue in his
viewpoint (Daily, Oct. 15), his quasi
economic assessment of the situation
falls, sadly, quite wide of the mark,
and he misses the point entirely.
Before going anywhere with this, I
must acknowledge my awareness of
the "fad" nature of current social
movements which causes them to
spring before the eyes of America for
a few brief moments, only to be for
gotten when it comes time for the
owners of those eyes to commit them
selves (e.g. "I want to assuage my
guilty conscience while I plan my
career of stepping on people to get to
the top of the corporate ladder").
Naturally there are those who are
truly committed, and, in the end, their
reward is usually only their personal
satisfaction.
This does not mean social causes
should be abandoned, as I am sure
Mr. Vescovo would agree. Nor does it
mean that we should start a national
movement every time an atrocity is
committed somewhere in the world.
Certainly there are gross wrongdoings
being commited in Afghanistan, Ethi
opia and the Soviet Union, but, if we
follow Mr. Vescovo's reasoning to its
logical conclusion, we really shouldn't
work against any of them because it's
always worse somewhere else. The
point Mr. Vescovo is missing is that
you have to start somewhere, because
doing something, however small it
may be, is always better than doing
nothing at all.
As for his contention that Stanford
should buy more stock instead of
divesting (in order to gain control of
the companies and thereby control
their management policies), I do not
think I need remind Mr. Vescovo that

the majority of organizations that buy
stock do so for investment purposes
only. Consequently they have neither
the money nor the time to mount
lengthy takeover bids for multi-billion
dollar corporations. Divestment is not
meant to hurt companies that invest in
South Africa; it is a means of bringing
about a greater awareness of the
problems in South Africa to the public
at large.
I admire Mr. Vescovo's dedication
to correcting the other wrongdoings
in the world, but I hope his dedica
tion does not lead him to the conclu
sion that apartheid is merely a "minor
problem" that should be ignored
while we attend to the others. One
has to start somewhere, and perhaps,
if we can achieve some good in South
Africa, we can move on to the other
pressing problems both in our own
country and abroad.

MIT students are

I read Mr. Middleton's letter (Daily,
Oct. 15) bemoaning the possibility of
Stanford's social life degenerating to
the level of MlT's with some amuse
ment. As a recent MIT graduate, I have
some exposure to both party experi
ences, and I am certainly not con
vinced of Stanford's supremacy in this
crucial collegiate department.
MIT students are smarter partiers.
There may be a dumber way of end
ing a party than waking up the presi
dent of the university at 3 o'clock in
the morning, but at present it escapes
me. The cardinal rule of extended
partying is to avoid the attention of
the administration and the police. MIT
has a strong system of over 30 frater
nities that (generally) exists in har
mony with the Institute by remember

ing this simple principle.
MIT students also excel at random
acts designed to ease tension. Throw
ing a burning couch over a balcony
hardly compares to dropping a grand
piano off a dormitory roof, rolling a
rather inebriated freshman end over
end across the Harvard Bridge or
halting the Harvard-Yale game with a
maverick weather balloon. Audacity
and imagination, combined with
reasonable precautions and a willing
ness to make restitution when things
go awry, cannot help but impress any
university administration.
In all, Mr. Middleton's letter has the
tone of one trying to get into a frater
nity, but unsure of his chances. Come
on, Jay, life can't be that bad — if it
really is, drop by and I'll buy you a
beer. It sounds like you could use
one.

the money nor the time to mount
lengthy takeover bids for multi-billion
dollar corporations. Divestment is not
meant to hurt companies that invest in

about a greater awareness of the
problems in South Africa to the public

I admire Mr. Vescovo's dedication
to correcting the other wrongdoings
in the world, but I hope his dedica
tion does not lead him to the conclu
sion that apartheid is merely a "minor
problem" that should be ignored
while we attend to the others. One
has to start somewhere, and perhaps,
if we can achieve some good in South
Africa, we can move on to the other
pressing problems both in our own
country and abroad.

MIT students are

I read Mr. Middleton's letter (Daily,
Oct. 15) bemoaning the possibility of
Stanford's social life degenerating to
the level of MlT's with some amuse
ment. As a recent MIT graduate, I have
some exposure to both party experi
ences, and I am certainly not con
vinced of Stanford's supremacy in this
crucial collegiate department.
MIT students are smarter partiers.
There may be a dumber way of end
ing a party than waking up the presi
dent of the university at 3 o'clock in
the morning, but at present it escapes
me. The cardinal rule of extended
partying is to avoid the attention of
the administration and the police. MIT
has a strong system of over 30 frater
nities that (generally) exists in har
mony with the Institute by remember

ing this simple principle.
MIT students also excel at random
acts designed to ease tension. Throw
ing a burning couch over a balcony
hardly compares to dropping a grand
piano off a dormitory roof, rolling a
rather inebriated freshman end over
end across the Harvard Bridge or
halting the Harvard-Yale game with a
maverick weather balloon. Audacity
and imagination, combined with
reasonable precautions and a willing
ness to make restitution when things
go awry, cannot help but impress any
university administration.
In all, Mr. Middleton's letter has the
tone of one trying to get into a frater
nity, but unsure of his chances. Come
on, Jay, life can't be that bad — if it
really is, drop by and I'll buy you a
beer. It sounds like you could use
one.

Apartheid is not
a minor problem
Although Victor Vescovo raises an
interesting and important issue in his
viewpoint (Daily, Oct. 15), his quasi
economic assessment of the situation
falls, sadly, quite wide of the mark,
and he misses the point entirely.
Before going anywhere with this, I
must acknowledge my awareness of
the "fad" nature of current social
movements which causes them to
spring before the eyes of America for
a few brief moments, only to be for
gotten when it comes time for the
owners of those eyes to commit them
selves (e.g. "I want to assuage my
guilty conscience while I plan my
career of stepping on people to get to
the top of the corporate ladder").
Naturally there are those who are
truly committed, and, in the end, their
reward is usually only their personal
satisfaction.
This does not mean social causes
should be abandoned, as I am sure
Mr. Vescovo would agree. Nor does it
mean that we should start a national
movement every time an atrocity is
committed somewhere in the world.
Certainly there are gross wrongdoings
being commited in Afghanistan, Ethi
opia and the Soviet Union, but, if we
follow Mr. Vescovo's reasoning to its
logical conclusion, we really shouldn't
work against any of them because it's
always worse somewhere else. The
point Mr. Vescovo is missing is that
you have to start somewhere, because
doing something, however small it
may be, is always better than doing
nothing at all.
As for his contention that Stanford
should buy more stock instead of
divesting (in order to gain control of
the companies and thereby control
their management policies), I do not
think I need remind Mr. Vescovo that

the majority of organizations that buy
stock do so for investment purposes
only. Consequently they have neither
the money nor the time to mount
lengthy takeover bids for multi-billion
dollar corporations. Divestment is not
meant to hurt companies that invest in
South Africa; it is a means of bringing
about a greater awareness of the
problems in South Africa to the public
at large.
I admire Mr. Vescovo's dedication
to correcting the other wrongdoings
