# Stanford should improve housing

The recent article about Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons' talk to the Stanford Mothers Club about
Stanford's housing system ( Daily, Oct. 8) gave an aw
fully glowing presentation of housing at Stanford.
Let's look at the whole picture.
Last spring, 894, or 14 percent, of the matriculated
undergraduate students on the Stanford campus,
lived in non-University housing. Some chose this life
style, but I suggest that most would rather have lived
in University housing and were denied that privilege.
According to Rodger Whitney, director of housing,

DOUG DECKMANN

there are no definite plans to construct more under
graudate housing, though he predicts that by 1991 or
1992 approximately 450 new spaces will be available.
That seems a bit inadequate On the other hand, at
USC this fall, 270 students who could not be ac
commodated in campus housing were dormed in a
fashionable apartment complex, complete with valet
parking, health club and swimming pool (see Sept. 22,
1986 issue of Time magazine). Stanford's effort to aid
unhoused students consists of a listing of available
housing and a free phone line. Thanks for the effort.
This practice of forcing students to live off campus
is hypocritical in light of Stanford's pride in its Resi
dential Education program. "Residential Education is
a Stanford tradition that introduces learning as a day
to-day occurrence, happening outside the classroom
as well as in it,'" one aspect of which "is based on the
premise that education opportunities should be of
fered in your house to complement the learning that
goes on in the Quad'' (See Stanford Universtiy Bulle
tin: Approaching Stanford 1984-85). Off-campus stu
dents are denied this aspect of their Stanford educa

tion. Instead they are instructed in a new set of skills:
dealing with landlords, furnishing, maintaining and
cleaning an apartment, heating rush-hour traffic,
shopping and cooking Maybe living off campus is a
good experience, but gaining that experience com
petes with more academic studies, and that's not fair.
So what can the University do? Build more under
graduuate housing, that's obvious. (The University
plans to break ground soon on a graduate housing
complex that would accomodate 780 students, but
even with that, only 52 percent of the graduate popu
lation could be housed on campus.) In the interim,
the University could play a larger role in securing
housing for students not offered on-campus housing.
Students studying at Stanford campuses abroad have
this done for them, even in their unguaranteed year;
to someone living on the East Coast, Palo Alto is as
foreign and inaccessible as Paris or Oxford. Rents
might be controlled at least, so that off-campus stu
dents can keep their housing costs in line with those

of on-campus students. Alter all, Palo Alto would not
be what it is if it weren't for Stanford; they owe us
something. As for extending the reach of Res Ed, that
seems impractical; I'll just take a partial refund on my
tuition, thank you.
It seems that the University regards this situation
with little priority. Look at all the projects that have
taken precedence over dorm-building: Sweet Hall,
the Center for Integrated Systems, the new mall be
tween Stern and Crothers, stadium refurbishment,
the Rodin sculpture garden and now a proposed
$250 million development for engineering and sci
ence â€” but no undergraduate housing. The Univer
sity is intent on attracting more people and more
money here, but they seem unwilling to house all the
student who are already here
