# A 						vacation Down Under
## 
### 
America is being invaded! They grabbed America's Cup
and now they are stealing our women. Beware, the
Australians are coming. Paul "Put another shrimp on the
barbi" Hogan, posing as a rugged poacher from the out
back, managed to charm New York City and win the heart of
Linda Koslowski in "Crocodile Dundee." He piobably can't
resist her steamy camping outfits. Last week, Jack Thompson,
another Australian hunk best remembered as the defense at
torney from "Breaker Morant," made off with Linda Evans in
the overly dramatic TV miniseries "The Last Frontier." An
ticipating this onslaught, this intrepid reporter dared to visit
the continent during summer break to size up the com
petition.
Ah, the land Down Under — where summer coincides
with Christmas, cars drive on the wrong side of the road and
water spins the other way when you flush the toilet. My
timing was perfect. The Australian dollar has slipped to 60-
cents on the U.S. dollar, making essential commodities —
like beer — dirt cheap. People were trusting and friendly,

cities were safe, and there was plenty to do. The people
even spoke English, sort of. America is still respected and
appreciated there — perhaps because the Aussies owe their
existence to the American Revolution. Yankee indepen
dence forced the British to find a new home for their con
victs.
The Australians have a fierce national pride and relish any
victory, especially over the United States or Great Britain. As
my plane landed in Sydney, the pilot proudly announced,
"Welcome to Australia, home of America's Cup."
Upon reading my first Australian newspaper, I knew this
was a country I could appreciate. The sports section com
prised half the paper, with features on cricket, sailing, ten
nis, rugby, soccer, Australian rules football and, most impor
tant, horse racing. The biggest item was Australia's rugby
victory over the New Zealand All Blacks and the planned se
ries against the South African team.
Australians are known for loving the outdoors, playing
hard and working only when necessary. In the other half of
the newspapers, I found numerous editorials denouncing
the number of people on the "dole" (welfare), the degree
of socialism and the lack of the work ethic. National benefits
include health insurance, guaranteed minimum wage,
holidays, old age pensions, child endowments and mater
nity benefits. Some Australians contend that people are be
coming lazy and complacent. Joke from the pub: Why don't
public servants look out the window in the morning when
they go to work? Because if they did, they wouldn't have
anything to do in the afternoons.
Sydney was my favorite city, despite it being the most
Americanized. As a civil engineer, I found the Sydney Opera
House both fascinating and beautiful with its overlapping
shells and harbor setting. One Aussie commented that it
resembled a group of nuns playing football. Like many con
struction projects, the unique structure was plagued with
design errors, labor disputes and cost overruns. With an
original budget of $7.2 million, its final cost of $102 million
is something even the U.S. Congress could be proud of. A

national lottery was held and the Opera House was paid off
in just two years — a tribute to the Australians' willingness
to gamble. Sydney offers a multitude of museums, art
galleries, theatres, parks and botanical gardens, as well as a
historical district with many buildings remaining from the
convict days.
Kings Cross is a unique area of Sydney consisting of back
lane cafes, sleazy strip joints and every conceivable form of
nightlife. It's one place where the pubs don't close early.
Kings Cross supposedly came alive during the Vietnam War,
when American Gls came on R&R with money in their pock
ets searching for sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Kings Cross
offers them all, along with most of Sydney's budget ac
comodations. You can guess where I stayed.
Although Australia is known for the outback and its vast
desert interior, most of the country's 16 million people are
concentrated in a few cities along the coast. The population
of Melbourne and Sydney alone is 5.5 million. Canberra, the
capital, is situated equidistant between the two rivals and is
an urban planner's dream. The city's design resulted from
an international competition, won by American Walter Bur
ley Griffin. Canberra offers tree-lined boulevards, parks,
beautiful architecture, surrounding hills, fountains and no
traffic congestion. Brisbane is best described as boring, but
is working to improve its image. Brisbane had hoped to host
the 1992 Olympics.
No trip to Australia would be complete without a visit to
an animal sanctuary, or at least the zoo. Aside from wom
bats, kangaroos and koala bears, Australian wildlife also in
cludes dingos, Tasmanian devils, emus, kookaburras,
goanas, buffalo and, believe it or not, camels. Robin Williams
asks, "Do you think God takes drugs? Then how else do you
explain the platypus?" Along with webbed feet, a beaver tail,
mole's fur and a duck bill, the platypus also has a poisonous
claw.
Traveling in Australia was so easy and convenient that the
United States looks backward in comparison. Trains, buses,
ferries and subways are easy to understand and run on time.
Tourist maps and accomodation assistance are readily
available. Furthermore, impoverished students, like myself,
receive substantial discounts all over the country, so bring
your Stanford ID. To get to Australia, fly Qantas. The rates
are the same as U.S. carriers, but both drinks and the movie
are free.
I've always heard that an Australian man's priorities are
sports, beer and women — in that order. Having spent a dis
proportionate amount of my vacation in pubs, I can at least
verify his love for beer. Foster's Lager is the best-known in
ternationally, but every city has its own local favorite.
You can often get the truth about a culture by listening to
jokes told in pubs. Question: How can you tell when an
Australian is feeling better? Answer: He tries to blow the
froth off his medicine. Q: What's the definition of an
Australian "poofter" (slang for homosexual)? A: A man who
prefers women to beer.
My visit to Australia was thoroughly enjoyable, and 1
heartily recommend the trip to anyone. If further induce
ment is still needed, consider that tipping is not expected,
beaches are topless and you have a choice of four national
anthems.
One final note: If offered a bite of a vegamite sandwich,
turn it down. It tastes terrible — even Tresidder wouldn't
serve it. No worries, mate. See ya at the barbi. G'day.
