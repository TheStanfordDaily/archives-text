# Frats' future examined
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy indicated that the future of
housed fraternities as a group is not
in jeopardy, at an open forum Friday
on the future of fraternities at Stan
ford.
Kennedy, one of five panelists at
the forum, said he does not oppose
fraternities, but called for an im
provement in their behavior.
"None of us is anxious to see this
part of Stanford's diversity vanish,"
Kennedy told approximately 125
people at Kresge Auditorium. "The
choice is not ours, but of those
who want the system to continue.
"We have seen a steady and trou
bling increase in incidents of — I
must be candid — delinquent behav
ior," Kennedy said.

Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, speaking at Friday's forum, addressed the future of Stanford fraterni
ties.
Such behavior displays "a lack of
foresight and political intelligence,"
he said, adding that "this is the time
for the fraternity system to convince
the community that it is a positive
force. And many are quite prepared
to be convinced."
Recent disagreements between the
University and fraternities have led to
an "understandable paranoia" on both
sides, Kennedy said. "1 don't want to
debate here who struck John, that is,
who started it. You could argue the
case either way," he said.
Kennedy, who called the police at
3:20 a.m. Tuesday to complain about the
noise from a Phi Delta Theta party,
assured the audience that he is usually
very tolerant of noise. The Phi Delts
were suspended pending investigation
of the incident.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
also speaking at the forum, said the
University' has moved from "a stance of
neutrality toward fraternities to one of
aggressive support."
Fraternities and sororities here have
also changed their position, Lyons said.
They have a more significant presence

at Stanford becau.se membership has
dramatically increased, according to
Lyons.
In recent decades, the number of
unhoused fraternities has increased
from zero to 16, while the number of
sororities has increased from zero in
1977 to eight, according to Lyons. One
out of five Stanford students belongs to
a Greek organization here, he added.
Lyons called fraternity Rush an im
portant issue, noting that "it has gotten
out of hand every spring for the last
two springs. We get reports of drunken
freshmen showing up at the parties."
He added that fraternities may have
to decide for themselves whether or
not to instigate a dry Rush, in which no
alcohol is served, in the future.
Joe Pisano, University fraternal af
fairs adviser, presented his six funda
mental principles for fraternities and
sororities that define the proper rela
tionship between universities and
Greek organizations.
The most important principle, he
said, asks fraternity members to think,
before they act, of the likely outcomes
of their actions.
Other principles Pisano noted in
clude staying in touch with the goals
and ideas of the University, acting with
integrity, being good citizens, main
taining involvement with alumni and
contributing to the community.
