## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy indicated that the future of
housed fraternities as a group is not
in jeopardy, at an open forum Friday
on the future of fraternities at Stan
ford.
Kennedy, one of five panelists at
the forum, said he does not oppose
fraternities, but called for an im
provement in their behavior.
"None of us is anxious to see this
part of Stanford's diversity vanish,"
Kennedy told approximately 125
people at Kresge Auditorium. "The
choice is not ours, but of those
who want the system to continue.
"We have seen a steady and trou
bling increase in incidents of — I
must be candid — delinquent behav
ior," Kennedy said.
