## I-Center: See the world 
### MONIQUE SCHEER 
If you haven't figured it out yet, Stan
ford is not the center of the known uni
verse. In fact, many people would
argue that there are lots of places in
the world besides Stanford worth
living in.
This is not to imply that Stanford is
not a nice place to be. For what other
reason would the University create
mini-Stanfords overseas, so that you
can get away from the Farm without
really leaving?
But the Sun ford Overseas Studies
programs aren't necessarily right or
convenient for everyone. Given the di
versity of the student body and the re
sulting myriad interests, there are
many Stanford students who find that
their international interests lie some
where outside the realm of the Stan
ford overseas campuses.
There may be even more people
who, bound to the Bay Area by pre
med requirements or engineering
majors, can t go overseas, but never
theless want to be exposed to some
thing besides ultraviolet rays.
Right here at Stanford, at the Bechtel
International Center, those students
can get information about a vast array
of overseas study opportunities, as well
as direct contact with intercultural
speakers and presentations. Located in
the ivy-colored building at the corner
of Lomita and Mayfield, the I-Center is
at the heart of much of the interna
tional activity that takes place at Stan
ford.

Not Just a hang-out
The I-Center serves two basic func
tions. The first is to help foreign stu
dents, scholars and their families in
tegrate into the Stanford community.
Most of the extra paperwork
(immigration papers, etc.) facing
foreign students is written in bureau
cratic jargon practically unintelligible
to Americans, much less to newly
arrived foreign students and scholars
with imperfect English. The staff at the
I-Center offers help with that paper
work and with English in general,
while also giving advice, support and
things to do outside of class.
Bechtel's second function is to give
American students an international ex
perience through programs and activi
ties at the center, and through the
Overseas Resource Center and its li
brary of study-abroad opportunities.
"One of our primary goals is to
make the Stanford student body aware
that this is a place for involvement and
enjoyment â€” not just a hang-out place
for foreign students," said Lee Zeigler,
director of the I-Center.
For example, if you want to practice
your favorite foreign language, the I-
Center offers a "language exchange" in
which you can meet with a native
speaker of that language who also
needs help with English. Students can
volunteer to escort some of the 1,500
foreign visitors that come to Stanford
each year via the Office for Interna
tional Visitors. Many of these visitors
are international businessmen and
women who provide a good opportu

nity for students to practice a foreign
language and to make some potentially
useful contacts.
Every Thursday night at 7:30, the I-
Center shows a foreign film (with En
glish subtitles, of course). Speakers
give frequent talks and lectures on in
ternational issues, often co-sponsored
by departments in the University.
Then there's everyone's favorite way
to experience other cultures: food.
Every week the I-Center offers interna
tional cuisine for a reasonable price at
its Sunday Supper.
The I-Center is also home of the
Espresso Bar (open from 8:00 to 11:30
p.m. every Thursday through Satur
day), where homemade cookies, cakes
and breads accompany a variety of cof
fee and espresso drinks. The atmos
phere is informal and cozy, perfect for
study breaks and socializing.
Resources for overseas study,
work
On the second floor of the 1-Center
is the Overseas Resource Center,
which provides hundreds, and perhaps
thousands, of overseas programs and
scholarship opportunities.
"Students should be encouraged to
go overseas the way they want to," said
John Pearson, assistant director for
Overseas Resources.
With the information and advising
available at the Overseas Resource
Center (ORC), any student can find a
way to get just about anywhere he or
she could possibly want to study, work
or travel.

The ORC library has the materials
necessary to get interested students
into an overseas program sponsored
by a U.S. institution other than Stan
ford. Or, for those students who are
more independent (and more fluent in
a foreign language), the ORC can help
with direct enrollment in a foreign uni
versity.
And it can also offer advice and in
formation on how to handle the trans
fer of credit from foreign institutions
to Stanford.
If improving your foreign language

ability or learning a new language is
your main objective, then a summer
overseas in intensive language study
could be ideal for you. The advisors at
the ORC know of several excellent pro
grams.
The ORC also handles some of the
better-known scholarships for study
overseas, including the Rhodes,
Fulbright and German Academic Ex
change programs. And, according to
Pearson, there are really not that many
applicants for these scholarships and
grants; students probably stand a better

chance of landing one than they think.
Pearson and Anna Dethlefsen are in
the ORC to advise students and help
them put together an overseas pro
gram that best suits their particular
goals.
"We're a service office, not an au
thority office," said Pearson. He and
Dethlefsen are well-informed about
the overseas programs available, en
thusiastic about helping students get
into them and unequivocally honest
