# Company thrives as funky shorts' demand expands
## 
### STEVEN LEVITT 
You've probably seen people wearing them
around campus if you don't already own a pair
of the stylish boxers shorts yourself.
"Bottom Drawers," the funky Hoya boxer
shorts that feature repeat-patterns of university
logos, have taken the country by storm since
they were first introduced to Georgetown Uni
versity last spring.
Now, the $8-per-pair "Bottom Drawers" are
being sold all over the United States in a variety
of stores, such as Bloomingdale's, J.C. Penney's,
Sears, Shirtique college bookstores and novelty
shops.
The idea for the shorts originated in the
heads of Michael Dickerson, Stanford Class of
1985, and Charlie Green, Swarthmore Class of
1985. The two, who were prep school buddies
back in their hometown of Washington, D C.,
decided to go into business together. They
came up with the idea of a unique kind of

boxer shorts, ones boasting a repeating-logo
pattern instead of ordinary stripes.
Dickerson and Green spent six months
searching for a company to manufacture their
shorts and turn their idea into reality. Richard
Geist, Stanford Class of 1986, a friend of Dicker
son and a new associate of College Concepts,
said that the men were looking for a company
the would roll the letters on the cotton cloth
panel, rather than the usual method of screen
printing them. This method would imprint the
letters in such a way that no discontinuities
would exist in the logo pattern.
They finally settled on Robinson Manufactur
ing, a Tennessee company with "a reputation
for quality manufacturing," according to Geist.
Dickerson and Green said they felt that a com
pany like Robinson Manufacturing would pro
vide the right complement to their own College
Concepts, as the two companies could develop
and expand alongside one another.
Geist claims that College Concepts has been

extremely satisfied with Robinson Manufactur
ing's work and that the reason for College Con
cepts' phenomenal nationwide success is the
"genuine quality of the shorn." He says that it is
College Concepts' imprinting process that
makes the difference: "Competitors screen
print (and) are out to make a fast-buck" while
"College Concepts is a customer-relations busi
ness, not just an underwear business."
Perhaps a great deal of their business know
how comes as a result of previous business en
deavors on the part of College Concepts'
founders. Dickerson, an international relations
major, was treasurer of the fraternity Theta Xi,
and ran the patio grill next to Tressider Union.
During the summer following his sophomore
year, he worked for the Phoenix Group in
Washington, D.C., where he wrote proposals
for the Coca-Cola marketing campaign.
Geist headed Donut Delivery, a catering ser
vice. He was also the financial manager of his

fraternity, Kappa Alpha, and was in charge of
the Sunday Flicks.
Green was an intern at the United States Sen
ate.
A bright future awaits the ever-expanding
College Concepts and its entrepreneurs. The
company currently supplies its 286 customers
(which distribute the shorts among 700 outlets)
with 42 kinds of shorts, featuring university,
sports team and company logos.
Many new styles are being desgined and
manufactured. Between January and September
1987, College Concepts expects to introduce 12
other types of products, which include shorts
similar to the popular "Jams" and a medical
style scrub shirt.
The company's creative and financial suc
cesses are astonishing for a 15-month-old firm
employing only six workers. Dickerson proj
ects sales of at least $3 million for the coming

fiscal year â€” not a bad return for a
firm that started out on $2,500 loaned
by their parents.
Largely responsible for these suc
cesses is the Dickerson-Green-Geist
working relationship. They are all
good friends, which is important be
cause the job requires that they spend
12 to 15 hours each day in their Man

hattan office.
The men have already received
media coverage through "People"
magazine, "Good Morning America",
The Washington Post and the Cable
News Network. Their shorts are to be
featured in the "Rolling Stone" maga
zine fall fashion issue in November.
But why aren't they available in the
Stanford Bookstore? Geist says that
College Concepts is working on ob
taining a license to print "Stanford"
shorts. Who knows? Maybe they'll
come out with "Stanford" boat shoes.
