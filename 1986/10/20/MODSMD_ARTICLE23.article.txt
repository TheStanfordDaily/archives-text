# Textbook shortfall tough tome to read

Kathy Vitz is frustrated.
She went to the Stanford Bookstore
the first week of the quarter to buy her
Russian 51 textbook when a bright or
ange sign notified her that "This
Textbook is Being Reordered."
Like many freshmen, she was the vic
tim of the Bookstore's recurring book
shortage. Because the Bookstore runs
out of textbooks for dozens of classes,
many Stanford students, not just fresh
men, are bookless at the beginning of
every term.
Lee Wandel, a lecturer in history,
was in charge of ordering the
textbooks for all the required fresh
man Western Culture classes. She re
quested a surplus of books — 25 more
books than students — for each class.
"After I ordered them, I went away
for the summer thinking everything
was fine," she said. "And when I
returned, two-thirds of the books were
already gone, and more than one third
of the students enrolled in the class did
not have books."
Quarter after quarter, these
shortages occur. And being the ones
most affected by this literary drought,
students wonder why the people who
order the textbooks still can't get it
right.
The magnitude of the problem puts
the Bookstore in a difficult position.
James Arnold, textbook manager for
the Bookstore, explained that factors
determining the size of a class, — the

instructor, the time of class and the stu
dents' schedule, as well as Stanford's
lack of preregistration for most classes
— make predicting the number of
books needed for students impossible.
"Even when there are a limited
number of students set by instructors,
prior to registration, students will
come in and buy the books, and then
find they can't get into the class," he
added.
"People who are not enrolled are
buying and the bookstore is reluctant
to order more than are actually en
rolled," noted Stephen Ferruolo, assis
tant professor of history.
Consequently, students who did
make the limited enrollment may find
that there are no books left for their
course in the Bookstore.
In fact, some students who have no
intention of taking a certain class will
still purchase the book. "I love
books," admitted one junior.
"Sometimes I'll find an interesting
book for a class, and buy it, even
though I have no intention of taking
the class."
Logic suggests that one possible so
lution to the shortages would be to
massively over-order texts so that there
would be too many rather than not
enough. Judith Wilson and Mary Jane
Fratis, secretaries in the Textbook Of
fice, explained the complications of
such an action.
Since the Bookstore deals with
nearly 250 publishers, some publish
ers have penalties for returned texts,

and some won't allow texts to be
returned at all.
So the Bookstore's only option is to
reorder the texts as soon as the stock
runs out.
To expedite the process, Arnold
phones in the reorder as soon as he
notes a particular text is sold out. Pub
lishers mail the books air freight to
Stanford as soon as possible. On
average, once the reorder is placed, it
will take five to eight days to arrive.
Sometimes it will take longer depend
ing on how busy the publishers are
and whether or not they are "out of
stock," in which case the books may
take two weeks or more to arrive.
Meanwhile, other resources are
available when the texts are not. The li
brary has at least one copy of every
course book on reserve, and these
copies are available for student use. Fat
Knowblock, head of reserves at Meyer
Library, said that as a general rule the
library will have one book on reserve
for every 25 students in the course,

with a maximum number of five books
per 25 students.
Last winter quarter, Meyer had 1,490
titles on reserve, but extra copies
brought the total number of books to
2,265. These books are primarily for
humanities-type courses. Scientific and
technical books can be found on
reserve at their specific libraries
around campus.
Another resource for students is the
dorm library. These contain books
donated over the years for the use of
future dorm students. As such, there is
no guarantee that a specific book will
be there. However, it might be worth
checking just in case.
Vitz, the frustrated Russian 51 stu
dent, still does not have a book. But
her instructor had yet another solu
tion: He photocopied the first chapter
from the book for future assignments.
For the moment, bookless students
take heart: as of Monday of hist week,
there were 150 reordered books that
had not yet arrived; as of Saturday only
60 were still missing.

2,265. These books are primarily for
humanities-type courses. Scientific and
technical books can be found on
reserve at their specific libraries
around campus.
Another resource for students is the
dorm library. These contain books
donated over the years for the use of
future dorm students. As such, there is
no guarantee that a specific book will
be there. However, it might be worth
checking just in case.
Vitz, the frustrated Russian 51 stu
dent, still does not have a book. But
her instructor had yet another solu
tion: He photocopied the first chapter
from the book for future assignments.
For the moment, bookless students
take heart: as of Monday of hist week,
there were 150 reordered books that
had not yet arrived; as of Saturday only
60 were still missing.
Kathy Vitz is frustrated.
She went to the Stanford Bookstore
the first week of the quarter to buy her
Russian 51 textbook when a bright or
ange sign notified her that "This
Textbook is Being Reordered."
Like many freshmen, she was the vic
tim of the Bookstore's recurring book
shortage. Because the Bookstore runs
out of textbooks for dozens of classes,
many Stanford students, not just fresh
men, are bookless at the beginning of
every term.
Lee Wandel, a lecturer in history,
was in charge of ordering the
textbooks for all the required fresh
man Western Culture classes. She re
quested a surplus of books — 25 more
books than students — for each class.
"After I ordered them, I went away
for the summer thinking everything
was fine," she said. "And when I
returned, two-thirds of the books were
already gone, and more than one third
of the students enrolled in the class did
not have books."
Quarter after quarter, these
shortages occur. And being the ones
most affected by this literary drought,
students wonder why the people who
order the textbooks still can't get it
right.
The magnitude of the problem puts
the Bookstore in a difficult position.
James Arnold, textbook manager for
the Bookstore, explained that factors
determining the size of a class, — the

instructor, the time of class and the stu
dents' schedule, as well as Stanford's
lack of preregistration for most classes
— make predicting the number of
books needed for students impossible.
"Even when there are a limited
number of students set by instructors,
prior to registration, students will
come in and buy the books, and then
find they can't get into the class," he
added.
"People who are not enrolled are
buying and the bookstore is reluctant
to order more than are actually en
rolled," noted Stephen Ferruolo, assis
tant professor of history.
Consequently, students who did
make the limited enrollment may find
that there are no books left for their
course in the Bookstore.
In fact, some students who have no
intention of taking a certain class will
still purchase the book. "I love
books," admitted one junior.
"Sometimes I'll find an interesting
book for a class, and buy it, even
though I have no intention of taking
the class."
Logic suggests that one possible so
lution to the shortages would be to
massively over-order texts so that there
would be too many rather than not
enough. Judith Wilson and Mary Jane
Fratis, secretaries in the Textbook Of
fice, explained the complications of
such an action.
Since the Bookstore deals with
nearly 250 publishers, some publish
ers have penalties for returned texts,

and some won't allow texts to be
returned at all.
So the Bookstore's only option is to
reorder the texts as soon as the stock
runs out.
To expedite the process, Arnold
phones in the reorder as soon as he
notes a particular text is sold out. Pub
lishers mail the books air freight to
Stanford as soon as possible. On
average, once the reorder is placed, it
will take five to eight days to arrive.
Sometimes it will take longer depend
ing on how busy the publishers are
and whether or not they are "out of
stock," in which case the books may
take two weeks or more to arrive.
Meanwhile, other resources are
available when the texts are not. The li
brary has at least one copy of every
course book on reserve, and these
copies are available for student use. Fat
Knowblock, head of reserves at Meyer
Library, said that as a general rule the
library will have one book on reserve
for every 25 students in the course,

with a maximum number of five books
per 25 students.
Last winter quarter, Meyer had 1,490
titles on reserve, but extra copies
brought the total number of books to
2,265. These books are primarily for
humanities-type courses. Scientific and
technical books can be found on
reserve at their specific libraries
around campus.
