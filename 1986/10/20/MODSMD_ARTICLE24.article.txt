"Half the Way Home: A Memoir of
Father and Son"
By Adam Hochschlld
Viking Press, New York
$15.95
"Half the Way Home" is an un
pretentious and subtly moving memoir
written by Adam Hochschild, the San
Francisco-based journalist, political ac
tivist and publisher of Mother Jones. It
is, as the subtitle tells us, a "memoir of
father and son;" and Hochschild
modestly keeps this relationship,
rather than himself, as the focus of the
narrative throughout the book.
Overall, it is not a very ambitious
book, and this accounts, 1 believe, for
much of the pleasure one has in
reading it. The memoir form
Hochschild chooses allows him to
move with a leisurely associative
rhythm through tableaux remembered
from his childhood without the con
straints of the more rigorous in
terpretive scheme one expects, for ex
ample, from autobiography. So we are
allowed to enjoy the sheer pleasure of
a sensuous detail for what it is in itself:
"Afternoon. The glinting of sunlight off
the rippled surface of the lake And,
as I sat on a porch chair or under a
tree, the smell of British books. Books
published in England then smelled dif
ferent; a faintly briny smell as if they
used sea water in making the paper."
There are details like this one
throughout the book, versions of
which are familiar from any reader's
childhood. But there are others, more
fantastic, which are as remote to most
of us as those one finds in an
anthropologist's field notes, for Adam
grew up the son of a wealthy in
dustrialist and his childhood was filled
with die life-size versions of the stuff
we played with only in fantasy: Chris
Craft boats, horses, limousines and
airplanes.
The serious tread of the book takes
us from Adam to the Prospero who
conjures up this fantasy for him,
"Father." It is the quest of the narrative
to understand this relationship. But,
just like the reluctant knight who
lingers one more day at the hearth of
an enchanting hostess, Hochschild

finds frequent occasion to drift away
from the dutiful pursual of his task to
luxuriate in the pleasurable way
stations of memory.
The most engaging of these
memories are attached to the
Hochschild family's summer home in
the Adirondacks, Eagle Nest. Affec
tionately called "the camp,"it was an
enclave of rough cut stone and timber
lodges where the extended family
would gather summer and winter,
ferried in from New York by sea plane
or limousine. What made it slightly
magical was the regular presence there
of Adam's Russian uncle, Boris, an
most fictitiously adventuresome char
acter: World War I fighter ace, Captain
of the Russian Imperial Air Force,
tenor, lover, horseman and holder of
the Cross of St. George. Boris
emigrated to the United States after the
Russian Revolution and made a living
as a test pilot for Sikorsky Aircraft Com
pany. It was he who flew the family up
to Eagle Nest in his 10-passenger
Grumman Mallard that could land
anywhere on land or water. It was he
who found places in the household for
all his displaced emigre companions.
Former aristocrats, officers and ballet
dancers were employed at Eagle Nest
as stable hands and cooks. They filled
the air with the sound of Russian drink
ing songs and the smell of simmering
pelmeni and shashlik, and converted a
lodge in the American north woods
into "a province of old Russia adrift in
time." Here, at this improbable dacha,
Hochschild remembers Alexandra
Tolstoy, the daughter of the great au
thor, gathering mushrooms, and the
visit of a princess of the Imperial family

who signed her name in the guest
book simply "Vera of Russia."
But Eagle Nest was not merely a
Tsarist island; it was a very American
place as well, and Hochschild has
some penetrating observations on how
landowners in our democratic culture
diguise from themselves their own
aristocracy. Boris, when he first visits
Eagle Nest, is puzzled to discover that
nobody dresses for dinner and that
everyone refers to the estate as a
"camp." Adam's participation in this
symbolic erasure of status consists of a
fixed ritual. Every night at dinner when
all the guests are seated, Adam's father
asks him to "Get the Beer." This entails
his drawing dark German beer out of a
barrel into mugs and serving the
guests; a seemingly innocuous task.
But, Hochschild writes, "After I handed
the beer, I felt humiliatedâ€” Looking
back on it now, I think that feeling
came not from having to do a menial
task ... but rather from the fact that
Getting the Beer was a ritual denial
that we were employers of servants.
Getting the Beer was a symbolic repre
sentation of the role of a normal host,
who prepares the food with his own
hands for a more humble table."
Although Boris's presence seems to
saturate Eagle Nest in Hochschild's
memory, he was, after all, only the
guest of the man of the house, Harold
Hochschild, Adam's father. Two men
could not have been more unlike:
Boris, the tall dark tenor with vodka on
his breath off for a naked midnight
plunge with a gaggle of pals, and
Harold, the sturdy balding man with
perfectly grammatical speech, who

swam alone for his health exactly the
same distance every day at precisely
the same time. And it was the latter, a
man as hard on himself as he was on
his son, with whom Adam lived on
uncomfortable terms until he died:
"There was always a stiffness between
us, as if we were both guests at party
and the host had gone off somewhere
before introducing us."
Harold was a domineering father in
the Hebraic mold who took the
prerogative of shaping his son in his
own image. And like the confused anti
heroes of the Hebrew Bible, Adam
lived in daily uncertainty as to what, in
his own behavior, might provoke his
father's ire. Abruptly, with a raised
eyebrow and a solemn "Adam! I think
that's enough for now," Harold's disap
proval would descend, accompanied
by the invitation to see him the next
day in his study. At these sessions,
Harold was always restrained and for
mal, which made him seem all the
more intimidatingly powerful.
While Adam was growing up, his
father remained a mystery to him. In
probing this enigmatic man through
the vehicle of his memoir, Hochschild
mobilizes several interpretive strate
gies. For example, in trying to explain
Harold's nearly obsessive need to be
thanked, Hochschild offers a cogent
Marxist analysis: "No Marxist has yet
written an analysis of the role of thank -
you letters in ruling class hegemony,
but to whomever undertakes that task,
I offer one thought: ritualistic thanking
legitimates the distinction between
haves and have-nots. A gift is thus a gift,
and not a sharing of goods which were

distributed unfairly in the first place."
While this sort of interpretation is
right on the money, so to speak,
Hochschild recognizes that, insofar as
it shifts the focus from a person to a so
cial practice, it is a digression from his
real goal, to achieve an understanding
of his father, an understanding of the
heart as well as of the head. This is not
to say that Hochschild ever divorces
politics from the private realm he is
trying to comprehend. One thing he
learns from visiting the copper mines
that his father's company owns in Zam
bia and South Africa is that the two are
inseparable. The noise, darkness and
heat that black workers endure in a
mine shaft is the foundation on which
the leafy leisure of his own Eagle Nest
summers are built. Everything
becomes revalued in light of this un
derstanding: "Many of the sounds of
Eagle Nest, sounds which can produce
a burst of nostalgia in me, were the
sounds of others laboring to make the
place run for my benefit."
It would be easy for Hochschild to
mollify his conscience and solve the
enigma of his father by recasting his
personal drama as a heroic myth of the
class struggle: oppressive-ruling-class
father vs. rebellious, "friend-of-the
people" son. But it won't work. To
begin with, Harold does not fit the role
of industrialist "pig:" he was a personal
friend of the Socialist Norman Thomas,
became an early critic of the war in
Vietnam, was honored to be included
on Nixon's "enemies list," and, in his
spare time, wrote a history of the
Adirondacks with sensitive profiles of
local working people. But more im
portant, Hochschild does not take
this simplistic route because he
recognizes that he does not want to
dismiss his father, but retrieve him.
In pursuit of this aim, he follows the
thread of his father's personal, family
and ethnic history. It leads him to the
discovery that Harold's domineering
rigidity is a defense for the overwhelm
ing vulnerability he feels being a Jew in
a gentile world. He has lived his entire
life with the anxiety that at any moment
he could be mocked and condemned.
Might people accuse him of being the
miser? He would shower them with
presents. Might they accuse him of
being a loud "Miami Beach type?" He

would be decorously restrained and
train his son to be so too. Might they
accuse him of being clannish? He
would marry an upper-crust Epis
copalian and invite WASPS to Eagle
Nest. Everything, it seems, could be
traced back to this anxiety. Why was
Harold so obsessive about horseback
riding? Because, Adam discovers as he
goes through old letters after his
father's death, in Frankfurt as a boy he
watched with sick envy as the cavalry
trained in front of him. Jews could not
become officers in the cavalry.
By the end of the book, close to the
time of his father's death, Adam is
surprised to realize that he is begin
ning to feel something akin to affection
for this old man he is trying to under
stand. On the threshold of death,
Harold invites his son to move a cot
into his hospital room, and, in a scene
that is classic in its tragic reverberation,
words are spoken that had been
waiting a lifetime to be said: "Suddenly
the nurse hears some subtle change in
the breathing, something I can't hear,
and quickly comes over with a stetho
scope. His eyes fly open wide, staring
up, not at me but through me. I have
not cried since I was a teenager, but
now a sob comes tearing up from an
unknown territory inside me. My lips
form around the essential, difficult 'I
love you.' I think it is true. I think he
can hear. His breath comes in deep
gasps, then subsides. I press my ear to
his chest. Something; yes, definitely
some sound still there. But the nurse
tells me the heartbeat I'm hearing is
my own."
The book, which had so successfully
resisted literary and mythic shaping,
plays out its conclusion in one of the
most satisfying classic structures: this is
Achilles and Priam embracing at the
door of death, it is every tragic hero
who, in accepting human limitation, af
firms his own humanity. It is the ritual
of incorporation rather than exclusion,
the most fulfilling of human achieve
ments. And it is a proper coda to a very
quiet and fine book.
