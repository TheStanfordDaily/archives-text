## Diverse Card attack annihilates Ducks 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — For the Stanford
Cardinal, Saturday s 41-7 victory over
Oregon was a chance to work out the
frustrations of last week's loss to Wash
ington and put the whole package to
gether for this week's showdown with
use.
For the Ducks, it was a lesson that
just because the pollsters don't put a
team in the top 20 doesn't mean they
can't administer a serious butt-kicking.
For the 28,226 on hand at Autzen
Stadium, a rare sunny October after
noon proved the only bright spot.
Oregon had entered the game with
four straight losses to national powers
Arizona, Nebraska, USC and Arizona
State. Saturday's thrashing was the
worst — equalling the margin of the
Nebraska game — and the Cardinal
became the first team to hold All-
Pacific 10 Conference quarterback
Chris Miller and the Oregon offense
under 14 points.
This time, though, the offense wasn't
content to let the defense do the work.
Behind the running of Brad Muster,
who finished with a season-high 151
yards on 25 carries, the Cardinal rolled
for 446 yards and its highest point total
since a 41-7 triumph over San Jose
State 17 games ago.
"We should always have the attitude
that we will take no prisioners," wide
receiver Thomas Henley said. "Once
we have someone down, we've got to
keep them down."
Henley played a large role in putting
the Ducks down. On the last play of the
first quarter, he fielded a Mike Preach
er punt at his own 8-yard line, broke
through the first wave of tacklers,
broke to the left sideline and stopped
92 yards later with the longest punt
return in Stanford history.
It was the first Stanford touchdown
on a punt return since Vincent White
broke one against Washington four
years ago, and it broke the record of 80
yards set by Murray Cuddeback in 1923
against the Olympic Club.
"I just thought, 'I've got to get to the
end zone,' " Henley said. "I knew
when I broke it, no one would catch
me."
The victory raised Stanford's record
to 5-1, 2-1 in the Pac-10. Stanford is in a
four-way tie for second place with

Washington, Arizona and UCLA, a half
game behind first-place Arizona State
(2-0-1).
In games with those teams, Stanford
has lost to Washington, has yet to play
Arizona and UGA and does not face
Arizona State, which defeated USC 29-
20 to remain undefeated. UCLA heat
California, 36-10, Arizona downed
Oregon State, 23-12, and Washington
won a a non-conference game over
Bowling Green.
This week's game against USC
became the topic of conversation as

soon as the slaughter was terminated.
"I don't think anyone was looking past
these guys," James said in the locker
room, "but as soon as I hit the steps up
here, I started thinking about USC. It's
the kind of game you look forward to
all season."
The Trojans are 2-2 in the confer
ence, and any hope of their winning
the league could be left on the field at
Stanford Stadium five days from now.
The Cardinal, though, has not beaten
USC since 1975, and has not defeated
the Trojans at home since 1970.

Against Oregon, the Cardinal
defense bent but didn't break, as it has
all year. The Ducks had third or fourth
down plays inside the Cardinal 30 on
three of its first four possessions, but
came away empty.
"The thing in particular in the first
half," Cardinal Coach Jack Elway said,
"were the many third and fourth down
situations they had. That's where the
defense came through."
The defense was playing without
linebacker Barry McKeever, corner
back Pat Kelly, strong safety Brad

Humphreys and, in the second half,
linebacker David Wyman. All were nur
sing minor injuries, but were not
needed Saturday.
"We knew we might have to make
some changes with some people
banged up," said Walt Harris, who
moved from safety to cornerback to
replace Kelly. "Everyone got a lot of
reps in practice. Every defensive back
is prepared to play and know what
they're doing."
The offensive line, led by center
Andy Sinclair, dominated the line of

scrimmage and enabled the hacks to
pick up 255 yards on 47 carries. "I
knew that I'd get the blocks up front,"
Muster said, "and I just broke into the
secondary."
In the battle of the two best quarter
backs in the Pac-10, Miller won the
statistical confrontation, but John Pave
won the game. Paye only had to throw
20 times, but he completed 14 of those
attempts for 191 yards and two touch
downs — eight of those balls caught by
wide receiver Jeff James. He also was
not sacked.
"We think of John as kind of our
girlfriend," Sinclair said earlier. "If
anyone wants to touch him, they've got
to go through all five of us first."
Miller completed 25 of 40 attempts
for 242 yards, but had no touchdown
passes and was intercepted by safety
Rick Theder and linebacker Kevin
Richardson. "Chris Miller is an out
standing quarterback," Elway said.
"But I think there's one better. His
name's John Paye."
The Cardinal opened fast, as Muster
broke a 42-yard run down to the
Oregon 6 behind a lead block by full
back Brian Morris. Muster then went in
from a yard out to give Stanford an
early 7-0 lead. "The key was getting a
score first," Paye said. "That meant a
lot."
Oregon came back to drive to the
Stanford 20, but on a fake field goal on
fourth-and-two, Tim Parker was
stopped for no gain after catching a
pass from Miller.
Henley's return made it 14-0, then
Stanford went up 21-0 when Muster
ran a fly pattern down the middle and
made an over-the-shoulder catch of
Paye's perfect throw for a 31-yard
scoring play. A 30-yard catch by James
set up the score.
James later scored when he caught a
28-yard pass from Paye in the end zone
without a defender in sight. "They
were in man coverage," James said. "I
saw my man fall, and adjusted my route
to the corner."
In the second half, Paye hit James
again on a flag pattern for a 42-yard
gain that set up a 10-yard run off a draw
play by Morris. But kicker David
Sweeney missed the extra point to
make it 34-0.
Oregon's touchdown came on an


Saturday was a banner game all around for the Stanford football team, and
the most pleasant surprise came in the person of linebacker Kevin Richard-

Mike Topolovac/Daily
son. Starting his first game ever at Stanford, Richardson intercepted one
pass, knocked down another and led the Cardinal defense with 13 tackles.
11 -play, 80-yard drive, capped by
Derek Loville's one-yard dive. The
score was set up by a 28-yard reception
by Bobby Deßisschop. "We bounced,
we didn't tackle,'' outside linebacker

Chris Weber said. "That big play
sparked that drive. It was a little disap
pointing to lose the shutout."
After Ray Huckestein recovered a
fumble at the Oregon 15, Muster went
10 yards for his third touchdown of the
day to complete the scoring.
Next Sunday's nationally televised
home game against the Trojans has
been moved up to 12:40 p.m.
