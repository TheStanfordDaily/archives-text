# Water polo now 22-0
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
The ability to have an off day and
still register a win against a highly
rated opponent is a trademark of a
great team. Bouncing back from that
off day to bury the next opponent is
another indication of a quality team.
Friday ;ind Saturday at DeGuerre
Ptx)l, this precise scenario took place
for the Stanford men's water polo
team.
Friday, the top-rated Cardinal
didn't perform at its accustomed
high level of play, but still defeated
No. 3 UGA 11-8.
"1 don't think we played a real
gixxl game," Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti said. "For the first time
this year, our defense kind of broke
down."
Saturday, however, the Cardinal
came out on fire against No. 8 UC
Irvine*winning by a hefty 10-4 mar
gin.
The victories upped the team's
overall record to 22 0 and extended
the Cardinal s winning streak to 31
games.
Stanford's domination was com
plete against the Anteaters, limiting
Irvine to just one goal in each per
iod.
After the game, Irvine Coach Ted
Newland had nothing but praise for
the Cardinal.
' Stanford is the best team I've ever
seen play in my entire life," he said.

"The\ must be the best team in the
history of water polo. I have never
seen a team with so much talent."
After trouncing UQA 12-5 earlier
in the season, the Cardinal expected
a tough game against the Bruins, but
got a little more than it bargained
for.
"It was without a doubt the tough
est game we've had all year," Detta
manti said.
Every time Stanford went ahead,
UCLA chiped away at the Stanford
lead. It was the first time this season
that the Cardinal defense looked
suspect.
"I think we played quite a deter
mined game today," UCLA Coach
Bob Horn said. "We are quite a gotxl
team if we're healthy."
Stanford jumped ahead 3-1 in the
first quarter, only to see I'CI.A come
right back and tie die score at four in
the second period.
Sophomore Fernando Carsalade,
who hails from Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, kept ICI.A close, scoring four
goals.
"Fernando really kept them in the
game," senior Craig Klass said. "He
is a really good player with a lot of
international experience."
After the Bruins tied the score,
however, the Cardinal regained con
trol.
"Stanford is a very experienced
team," Horn said. "They played with
a lot of confidence."
Junior Erich Fischer scored two of

his team high six goals in the next
two periods to open up a 9-5 Card
inal lead at die end of the third quar
ter.
"They really had our offense
stopped," Dettamanti said. "Thank
God for Fischer. He really took
over."
Stanford withstood a fourth
quarter rally by UCLA to bring the
score to its final 11-8 margin. The
Bruins' record dropped to 15-5.
"UCLA traditionally comes up and
plays well against us," said senior
Chris Thompson, who was playing in
his first game of the season after suf
fering a collapsed lung during die off
season "Our team was in control
most of the time, though. We weren't
top worried."
On Saturday, in a rematch of last
year's NCAA title game, the Cardinal
defense tightened as Stanford was
just too much for Irvine.
Stanford was never in any danger,
leading 6-2 at halftime.
Fischer scored four goals against
Irvine, bringing his team leading
goal output to 57 goals. Klass con
tributed two goals in the contest, up
ping his total to 53 goals on the year.
In addition, sophomore goalie
Todd Kemp stopped two Irvine
breakaways and allowed only four
goals.
"Todd played great today," Detta
manti said. "It was his best game of
die year without a doubt."
Irvine's record fell to 7-7.
