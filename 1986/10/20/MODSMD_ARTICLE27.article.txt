# Spikers grab Pac-10 lead
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
By 7:30 p.m. Saturday, most of a
fairly good-sized crowd had filed into
Maples Pavilion for what it expected
would be five intense games of
women's volleyball.
Most probably, they believed No. 4
UCLA would squeeze out a win over
No. 12 Stanford, which had been giving
the nation's best a good fight all fall,
but somehow always came up on the
short end of the stick.
At 8:45 p.m., this same crowd must
have felt like it had just watched the
most recent episode of "Amazing
Stories," as it quickly shook itself out of
a stunned silence and cheered a Card
inal team that had just routed the
Bruins in three straight games, 15-8,
15-7,15-2.
"How could that last game be over;
didn't it start just 15 minutes ago?"
must have been the question in every
one's mind.
Yes, it did start just 15 minutes ago,
and here are some more numbers that
are hard to believe. For the match,
Stanford's team hitting percentage was
.425; UCLA's was .098. The Cardinal
totaled 27 blocks; the Bruins managed
only six. Stanford's top three hitters
each boasted a success rate better than
500; UCI.A had three players who hit
for negative percentages.
The spikers were victorious Friday
night as well, beating USC in three
games. The weekend's wins put the
Cardinal at 11-6 overall. USC dropped
to 2-16, and UCLA is now 17-7.
All three teams are in the Pacific 10
conference, which Stanford now leads
with a 7-1 record. UCLA is also 7-1, but
the Cardinal is technically the leader
by virtue of its win over the Bruins.
The Trojans are buried at the bottom
of the league at 0-7.

Good passing and setting allowed Brooke Hahner to hit virtually uncon
tested against the UCLA defense Saturday as the Stanford women's volley
ball team pulled off a three-game upset of the No. 4 Bruins.
