# Spikers grab Pac-10 lead
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
By 7:30 p.m. Saturday, most of a
fairly good-sized crowd had filed into
Maples Pavilion for what it expected
would be five intense games of
women's volleyball.
Most probably, they believed No. 4
UCLA would squeeze out a win over
No. 12 Stanford, which had been giving
the nation's best a good fight all fall,
but somehow always came up on the
short end of the stick.
At 8:45 p.m., this same crowd must
have felt like it had just watched the
most recent episode of "Amazing
Stories," as it quickly shook itself out of
a stunned silence and cheered a Card
inal team that had just routed the
Bruins in three straight games, 15-8,
15-7,15-2.
"How could that last game be over;
didn't it start just 15 minutes ago?"
must have been the question in every
one's mind.
Yes, it did start just 15 minutes ago,
and here are some more numbers that
are hard to believe. For the match,
Stanford's team hitting percentage was
.425; UCLA's was .098. The Cardinal
totaled 27 blocks; the Bruins managed
only six. Stanford's top three hitters
each boasted a success rate better than
500; UCI.A had three players who hit
for negative percentages.
The spikers were victorious Friday
night as well, beating USC in three
games. The weekend's wins put the
Cardinal at 11-6 overall. USC dropped
to 2-16, and UCLA is now 17-7.
All three teams are in the Pacific 10
conference, which Stanford now leads
with a 7-1 record. UCLA is also 7-1, but
the Cardinal is technically the leader
by virtue of its win over the Bruins.
The Trojans are buried at the bottom
of the league at 0-7.
The Cardinal started strong against


Benjamin Tong/Daily
Good passing and setting allowed Brooke Hahner to hit virtually uncon
tested against the UCLA defense Saturday as the Stanford women's volley
ball team pulled off a three-game upset of the No. 4 Bruins.
UCLA, jumping out to a 4-0 lead in the
first game. The score went to 9-1 and
then 11-2, before UCLA finally started
putting some points on the board,
coming back to 12-8. Stanford gave no
hints that it might be collapsing,
though, and it was quickly 14-8.
A thrilling final point, which had
everyone in the crowd leaning on the
person in front of him, was highlighted
by floor-scraping saves from Brook
Binley and Wendi Rush, before Barbra
Fontana's kill sealed the first game.
In the second game, Stanford ran up
a 7-3 lead before a very questionable
dill — bringing Cardinal Coach Don
Shaw off the bench and boos from the
fans — stopped a Cardinal streak and
allowed the Bruins back in the game.
The score went to 8-6, at which point
the rather inhospitable host started up
another surge, which led to the 15-7
final.
Anybody who was surprised by the
outcome and margin of victory in the
first two games must have been sure
he was dreaming when the Cardinal
jumped to a 8-0 lead in the third and
did not look back.
Neither Shaw nor senior co-captain
Brooke Hahner could say exactly what
caused the blowout. Both said that the
squad passed especially well, giving
setter Rush as many options as she
needed for the majority of the points
and, therefore, repeatedly leaving the

UCLA blockers clueless as to who
would be hining.
"I would be going up to hit, and
there would be a huge opening in
their defense for me to hit to," Hahner
said, describing a situation she is not
used to, especially against a team
ranked among the country's top five.
Shaw also applauded his team s ser
ving, which he said took UQA out of
its offense. The Bruins never got going;
the Cardinal never stopped going.
"We never really gave them a
chance," Hahner said. "They're a
streaky team, if they get started, they're
impossible to stop. But we never gave
them a chance."
Of course, it wasn't all physical. The
mental strength Stanford showed in
winning the third game was yet an
other positive in the most positive
match the Cardinal has played all
season. The fact that the squad not only
did not let down, but actually got
stronger, was a refreshing sight for
anybody who has been watching Card
inal volleyball over the past few
seasons.
"For at least the last two years, we
have won the first two games and then
lost the third so often," Hahner said.
The Cardinal has a light schedule
over the next couple of weeks. Friday,
the team travels to Berkeley for a con
ference match against California. Oct.
28, Stanford travels to Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo to take on the traditionally
strong Mustangs.
The team returns home Halloween
weekend for conference matches
against Oregon State and Oregon.

Stanford's team hitting percentage was
.425; UCLA's was .098. The Cardinal
totaled 27 blocks; the Bruins managed
only six. Stanford's top three hitters
each boasted a success rate better than
500; UCI.A had three players who hit
for negative percentages.
The spikers were victorious Friday
night as well, beating USC in three
games. The weekend's wins put the
Cardinal at 11-6 overall. USC dropped
to 2-16, and UCLA is now 17-7.
All three teams are in the Pacific 10
conference, which Stanford now leads
with a 7-1 record. UCLA is also 7-1, but
the Cardinal is technically the leader
by virtue of its win over the Bruins.
The Trojans are buried at the bottom
of the league at 0-7.
The Cardinal started strong against


Benjamin Tong/Daily
Good passing and setting allowed Brooke Hahner to hit virtually uncon
tested against the UCLA defense Saturday as the Stanford women's volley
ball team pulled off a three-game upset of the No. 4 Bruins.
UCLA, jumping out to a 4-0 lead in the
first game. The score went to 9-1 and
then 11-2, before UCLA finally started
putting some points on the board,
coming back to 12-8. Stanford gave no
hints that it might be collapsing,
though, and it was quickly 14-8.
A thrilling final point, which had
everyone in the crowd leaning on the
person in front of him, was highlighted
by floor-scraping saves from Brook
Binley and Wendi Rush, before Barbra
Fontana's kill sealed the first game.
In the second game, Stanford ran up
a 7-3 lead before a very questionable
dill — bringing Cardinal Coach Don
Shaw off the bench and boos from the
fans — stopped a Cardinal streak and
allowed the Bruins back in the game.
The score went to 8-6, at which point
the rather inhospitable host started up
another surge, which led to the 15-7
final.
Anybody who was surprised by the
outcome and margin of victory in the
first two games must have been sure
he was dreaming when the Cardinal
jumped to a 8-0 lead in the third and
did not look back.
Neither Shaw nor senior co-captain
Brooke Hahner could say exactly what
caused the blowout. Both said that the
squad passed especially well, giving
setter Rush as many options as she
needed for the majority of the points
and, therefore, repeatedly leaving the

UCLA blockers clueless as to who
would be hining.
"I would be going up to hit, and
there would be a huge opening in
their defense for me to hit to," Hahner
said, describing a situation she is not
used to, especially against a team
ranked among the country's top five.
Shaw also applauded his team s ser
ving, which he said took UQA out of
its offense. The Bruins never got going;
the Cardinal never stopped going.
"We never really gave them a
chance," Hahner said. "They're a
streaky team, if they get started, they're
impossible to stop. But we never gave
them a chance."
Of course, it wasn't all physical. The
mental strength Stanford showed in
winning the third game was yet an
other positive in the most positive
match the Cardinal has played all
season. The fact that the squad not only
did not let down, but actually got
stronger, was a refreshing sight for
anybody who has been watching Card
inal volleyball over the past few
seasons.
"For at least the last two years, we
have won the first two games and then
lost the third so often," Hahner said.
The Cardinal has a light schedule
over the next couple of weeks. Friday,
the team travels to Berkeley for a con
ference match against California. Oct.
28, Stanford travels to Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo to take on the traditionally
strong Mustangs.
The team returns home Halloween
weekend for conference matches
against Oregon State and Oregon.
By 7:30 p.m. Saturday, most of a
fairly good-sized crowd had filed into
Maples Pavilion for what it expected
would be five intense games of
women's volleyball.
Most probably, they believed No. 4
UCLA would squeeze out a win over
No. 12 Stanford, which had been giving
the nation's best a good fight all fall,
but somehow always came up on the
short end of the stick.
At 8:45 p.m., this same crowd must
have felt like it had just watched the
most recent episode of "Amazing
Stories," as it quickly shook itself out of
a stunned silence and cheered a Card
inal team that had just routed the
Bruins in three straight games, 15-8,
15-7,15-2.
"How could that last game be over;
didn't it start just 15 minutes ago?"
must have been the question in every
one's mind.
Yes, it did start just 15 minutes ago,
and here are some more numbers that
are hard to believe. For the match,
Stanford's team hitting percentage was
.425; UCLA's was .098. The Cardinal
totaled 27 blocks; the Bruins managed
