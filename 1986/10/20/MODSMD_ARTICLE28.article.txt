### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Dwight Evans and Dave Henderson
hit home runs in Boston's 18-hit attack that spoiled tine
pitchers' duel that never was, and the Red Sox completed a
sweep of the first two games of the World Series at New
York by beating the Mets 9-3 last night.
It was a matchup of two of the game's best pitchers, 24-
game winner Roger Clemens of Boston and last year's Na
tional league Cy Young winner, Dwight Gooden of New
York. But neither pitcher was around after five innings as
the offenses took over, with Boston outhitting the Mets 18-8
Now, the Red Sox, series underdogs, take a 2-0 lead in
games in the best-of-seven series back to Fenway Park in
Boston, where the next three games are scheduled. Only
Kansas City last year has ever lost the first two games at
home and come back to win the series.
Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd, 16-10 during the season, is sched
uled to face former Red Sox pitcher Bob Ojeda, 18-5, a left
hander, in Game 3 tomorrow night.

Henderson, the hero of Boston's Game 5 playoff victory
with a ninth-inning homer, hit a solo homer in the fourth in
ning off Gcxxlen, and Evans hit a two-run shot in Gooden's
last inning, the fifth, as the Red Sox took a 6-2 lead. The Red
Sox scored two more runs in the seventh on five con
secutive singles off Rick Aguilera to put the game away.
Bostons 18 hits were two hits shy of the World Series
single-game record set by the New York Giants in 1921 and
St. Louis Cardinals in 1946.
Clemens, who failed to go five innings only twice this
season, was knocked out of the game in the fifth after giving
up three runs on five hits in his third straight outing on
three days rest.
The Mets, who hit just .189 in the playoffs, were held to
four hits in losing the first game 10, and Manager Dave
Johnson benched regulars Ray Knight and Mookie Wilson in
favor of Howard Johnson and Danny Heep to try to get more
offense. Johnson and Heep went a combined 0-for-6.
