# Students announce sanctuary plans
## 
### ANDREW PATZMAN Staff writer 
Plans to establish a sister university relationship
with the University of San Salvador and to stage a
benefit concert for Salvadoran earthquake victims
headed the list of topics discussed Thursday at an or
ganizational meeting of Sanctuary at Stanford.
The group, formed last year, is part of a nationwide
movement concerned with providing material assis
tance and shelter to Central American refugees facing
deportation by the U.S. government.
Noting that there are "no plans at the moment" to
house a refugee on campus this year, Sanctuary at
Stanford member Ed Gilliland said the group intends
to mount a "yearlong campaign" to get a sister uni
versity referendum placed on an ASSU election bal
lot.
Creating a relationship with students at the Salva
doran university would help set up "emergency
response networks" that would enable members of
the Stanford community to hear about and protest
the mistreatment of students in El Salvador, he said.
Gilliland, a graduate student in sociology, added
that "student-to-student relations" between Stanford
and the University of El Salvador would facilitate
"raising funds to rebuild the (Salvadoran) univer
sity," which was severely damaged by the earthquake

that shook El Salvador Oct. 9.
James Lyons, dean of Student Altairs, called the pro
posal "a great idea," but added that the University
would remain neutral on the issue. A sister university
relationship would not be "in the name of the Uni
versity," he said.
At Thursday's meeting in the Old Union Club
house, attended by about 25 people, Sanctuary at
Stanford organizers also discussed their immediate
plans to co-sponsor a Nov. 11 benefit concert for Sal
vadoran earthquake victims.
The concert, to be held in Memorial Church, will
feature musical performances by various local and
Central American bands.
According to Gilliland, the sister university effort
and the benefit concert represent "a broadening of
the focus" of the sanctuary movement. He noted,
however, that Sanctuary at Stanford will continue its
efforts to raise bail money for refugees fighting de
portation.
He explained that because Sanctuary at Stanford
does not have a building of its own, it cannot shelter
refugees. "We have to work with dorms and support
them" if they decide to house a refugee, Gilliland
said.
Last spring, residents of Columbae House declared
their co-op a sanctuary and offered refuge to
"German," a Salvadoran refugee. Because of a Uni

versity policy, limiting guest visits to three days in a
particular residence, German also .spent time in Casu
Zapata and at the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) frater
nity house.
Senior Simon Durcan, a Columbae resident and
member of Sanctuary at Stanford, said he can't
predict whether Columbae will decide to take in an
other refugee this year.
Explaining that it "took a lot of time" last year for
house members to agree to take in German, Durcan
said he did not expect the house to "reach a consen
sus" on the issue soon.
Skip Teel, a resident assistant at the DKE house,
said "it's possible" that the fraternity might house a
refugee again this year, but cautioned "it's not really
on our agenda yet,"
Similarily, Casa Zapata resident assitant Mario
Huerta said the issue of sanctuary "hasn't come up
vet" among house residents.
Stressing that the University is not going to change
its position on guest stays to accommodate refugees,
Lyons said the University's guest policy has nothing
to do with politics.
He told The Daily last week that he considered
sanctuary "a powerful and necessary cause," but felt
that "using the University as a sanctuary is a different
issue."
