# Field hockey extends streak

### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Recording its sixth consecutive
shutout, the Stanford field hockey team
completed a perfect weekend at the
California Invitational in Berkeley with
a 2-0 victory yesterday over the Univer
sity of the Pacific.
Shutout numbers four and five came
Friday and Saturday, with the Cardinal
beating Chico State and Simon Fraser
â€” also by 2-0 scores. Stanford's overall
record is now 8-4-1.
Although she was pleased with the
defense, which hasn't allowed a goal
since Oct. 1, Stanford Coach Sheryl
Johnson had more to say about the

team's recently rejuvenated offense.
"Things are finally starting to click
for us," she said. "Right now, we're
playing as well as we have all season.
There seems to be more teamwork,
more give-and-gos, more passing plays
and twice as many shots on goal. We're
getting more opportunities to score."
Stanford scored both of its goals yes
terday in the second half, the first com
ing on a breakaway by Maree Chung
and the second on a shot from Dana
Fleming.
On Saturday, Andi Wolpert put the
Cardinal ahead 1-0 at the seven-minute
mark on a short-corner play. It was her
team-leading fourth tally of the year.
Stanford clung to this slim lead until

the final minute, when Tracy Stieglitz
gave the team some insurance with her
second goal of the season.
Friday's goals were scored by
Stieglitz and Laura Gartland, her third
of the year.
Johnson believes that the artificial
turf at Cal's Kleeberger Field benefit
ted the Stanford offense. "I actually
think this team plays better on turf,"
she said. "There are more passing
plays that can work."
The Cardinal is off until Oct. 29,
when it begins the second half of the
Northern Pacific Conference season by
returning to Kleeberger Field to meet
Cal. Stanford currently leads the Nor-
Pac with a 3-1-0 record, and judging

from this weekend's performance, the
Cardinal would seem to be the team to
beat.
"This team is just starting to jell,"
Johnson said. "We're playing our best
hockey now, and with the second
round of the conference coming up,
it's a good time to do it."
Card notes
Stanford did not actually win the
entire tournament, but it did win its
bracket by beating all of the other
teams in it. The Cardinal was also the
only team in the seven-school tourna
ment to win all three of its games.
