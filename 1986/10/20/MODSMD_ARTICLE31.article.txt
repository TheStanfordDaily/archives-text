Though the final score indicated otherwise, Satur
day's Stanford-California women's soccer game was
hard-fought until the end, with the second-ranked
Golden Bears notching a 4-1 victory over the rival
Cardinal.
The Cardinal knew that the Bears were an excel
lent team and prepared accordingly for the game.
The Bears came into the game with an 11-1-1 record.
They had achieved their No. 2 national ranking by
virtue of winning their last 11 games â€” the last five
being shutouts.
Although the score was 4-1, it was a "closer game
than the score reflects," Stanford Coach Helen
Keohane said. "In some ways, it (the game) was a
confidence booster."

At the beginning of the game, the Cardinal had
cause for optimism. After 26 minutes, the Bears
seemed to be dominating the action, but they were
not in control of the game. Time after time, the Stan
ford defense held off attacks and tried to return the
ball downfield.
Then, on a well-coordinated offensive charge, the
Cardinal stunned the Bears. From the left of the goal,
junior midfielder Manda Dunlop passed the ball
laterally to Stacey Keare on the right. Keare took the
assist and kicked the ball diagonally, high into the left
corner of the net.
The moments following the goal were "the best 17
minutes of my coaching career," Keohane said.
With two minutes left in the half, however, Cal tied
the score on a brave charge through the Cardinal
defense and a delicate shot into the goal.
In the second half, the Bears' offense came back on

the field in full force.
As expected, Cal standout Brandi Chastain proved
to be a key part of the Bear offense. Seven minutes
into the second half, Chastain headed in a perfectly
placed corner kick.
Stanford refused to give up, though, and continued
to withstand offensive pressure from the Bears, while
launching several attacks on the goal itself.
"We had even more chances to score in the second
half," Keohane said. "We just weren't able to to take
advantage of their weak back four."
Within the next 20 minutes, both Keare and Tonya
Antonucci narrowly missed the Cal goal, firing shots
inches above the net.
In the end, two more goals were scored by the
well-balanced Cal offense. The Bears' four goals were
scored by four different players, as the forwards
rotated in and out.
