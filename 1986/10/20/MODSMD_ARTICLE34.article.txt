# UNLV edges Stanford, 1-0
## 
### 
Saturday's men's soccer game was a testimony to the fact
that statistics don't mean a whole lot unless you win.
Stanford matched highly ranked Nevada-Las Vegas shot
for shot and even outplayed the Rebels in the second half,
but when time had expired at Maloney Field, UNLV was tri
umphant, 1-0.
The loss dropped the Cardinal to 5-7-2. The Rebels are 5*
3.
"Personally, 1 didn't think they were that good," Stan
ford's Mike Mossmer said of UNLV. "They weren't as
talented as I thought for a team with their ranking. We had a
lot of chances, but we couldn't put the ball away . "
Stanford's offense, which has been inept at best this
season, once again failed to penetrate the opponent's net.
"We had about three chances to put the ball away easily,"
Mossmer said. "We just never get our attack straight. It's
never a full attack."
The UNLV goal came at the 15:23 mark in the second half
when Gavin Spaulding headed in a shot past Stanford goalie
Tom Austin. "It was just a little, dinky header," Mossmer
said.
Despite giving up a goal, Austin and the Cardinal defense
turned in a "pretty sound" performance, according to Mos
smer. "They (UNLV) didn't have many chances in the second
half."
Both teams had 15 shots on goal for the game.
