# Prof. defends Bird

### BISHAKHA DATTA 
A Univeristy of Santa Clara law pro
fessor Thursday night accused oppo
nents of Rose Bird, the embattled chief
justice of the California Supreme
Court, of emotionally exploiting the
death penalty issue to vote out justices
who have ruled in favor of labor and
underprivileged groups.
Matthew Kumin, speaking at Tresid
der Union, said that filings with the
California secretary of state show that
certain banking, agricultural and real
estate interests donated "over $100
apiece" to the campaign seeking to
defeat Bird and other liberal California
Supreme Court justices.
"For the first time in history, we will
be making history by losing a chief
justice of the (State) Supreme Court
and two others," Kumin said, referring
to the election chances of Justices Bird,
Joseph Grodin and Cruz Reynoso.
He told approximately 30 listeners
that polls showed Grodin and Reynoso
had "excellent chances" of retaining
their seats in the November elections.
"Is the agricultural community upset
about the death penalty?" Kumin
asked.

He said certain groups felt that the
California Supreme Court had "gone
against them too many times," noting
that one influential group was upset at
court rulings that favored tenants.
"Do we believe in constitutional
rights or don't we?" Kumin asked the
members of the audience, some of
whom were wearing badges support
ing Bird.
He said that tne Crime Victims for
Court Reform group, which labels Bird
as "soft on crime," wants the death
penalty to be given in cases in which
the constitutional requirements are
not met.
According to Kumin, Bird is not
against the death penalty, but insists
that all constitutional requirements be
met before the death penalty is given.
California law requires proof of "intent
to kill" and a fair trial for the defendant
before passing the death sentence.
Kumin cited a case in which the
death penalty was reversed because
"counsel refused to put on mitigating
evidence" that would have helped the
defendant's case. The death penalty
was reversed in more than 20 cases be
cause intent to kill could not be
proved, he said.
