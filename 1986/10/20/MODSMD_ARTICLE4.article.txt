A new child care center that
received concept approval at the Oct.
14 meeting of the Board of Trustees
may begin operating by the middle of
1988, according to Margaret Ann Fid
ler, associate dean of Student Affairs.
The new center is designed to meet
the growing needs of the Stanford
community. There are now three nur
sery schools, one full time day-care
program, 60 day-care homes and
various afterschool programs for Stan
ford students, professors and staff with
small children.
or these programs, there
is a two-year waiting list for child care
services at the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community, according to Fid
ler.
The new center will help the Univer
sity address the severe demand for
quality child care.
The proposed facility would provide
100 new spaces for children and could
further expand 60 or 80 spaces with
later funding. Additionally, the center
would provide for the unmet needs of
Stanford Hospital workers who work
odd shifts and of parents of mildly ill
children, Fidler said.
"There's a clear unmet demand,"
she said, noting that the timing for the
proposed center "just seemed right "
Stanford's child care policy since
1972 is to facilitate rather than actually
provide child care services, Fidler said.
The proposed new facility will be
modeled after existing facilities that
are operated by a board primarily

composed of parents, she said.
The centers are non-profit organiza
tions, and parents pay the operating
costs.
Although a location for the new
facility hits yet to he decided, Fidler
noted that a site near the hospital is
likely, so the center will further meet
the demands of hospital employees.
Sources for funding of the center
have yet to be determined, she added.
If all goes well, Fidler said, the cen
ter, staffed with trained child care
professionals, could open in mid-1988.
Fidler said, "We're overjoyed at the
prospect of doing something (for the
Stanford community)."
She noted the fact that securing ade
quate child-care can often be a burden
to parents here.
"It's important for the University to
help with child care in that it helps its
faculty, staff and students do what
they're supposed to be doing," Fidler
said.
Parents "can really study, teach and
work better" when they know that
their children are being taken care of,
she said.
Nancy Etchemendy, wife of Philoso
phy Prof. John Etchemendy and
mother of a two-year-old child agreed
that the new center will provide a
valuable service to the Stanford com
munity.
"It's all sort of a juggling game when
you have kids," she said.
"If anything I would say it (child
care) would improve John's efficiency
as a facultv member," she added.
