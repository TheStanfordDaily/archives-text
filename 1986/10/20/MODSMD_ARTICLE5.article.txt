# Two students are found guilty
## Lawyer: Stanford suspended both 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford students involved in
an altercation last spring that resulted
in the hospitalization of classmate
David Curry have been found guilty on
battery charges in Santa Clara Superior
Court.
Bill McKelvy, who originally pleaded
not guilty to one count of felony bat
tery, was sentenced last Wednesday to
one year of summary probation, a $100
fine and 100 hours of voluntary work.
Randy Von Feldt, who pleaded no
contest, will be sentenced today by Su
perior Court Judge Read Ambler. The
judge could possibly reduce the felony
charge to a misdemeanor.
Curry, who suffered a collapsed lung
and two broken ribs in a fight after fra
ternity Rush parties last year, is suing
McKelvy, Von Feldt, Stanford Univer
sity and the Delta Upsilon and Sigma
Chi fraternities.
Stanford should be responsible for
what happens at campus parties where
alcohol is served, according to John
Crowley, the San Jose attorney
representing Curry in the lawsuit filed
Oct. 10.
Curry was treated in Stanford Hospi
tal's Intensive Care Unit for more than
a week after the fight, which occurred
at 3 a.m. on April 11, after the three
freshmen had attended Rush parties at
the DU and Sigma Chi fraternities.
McKelvy and Von Feldt were
charged with felony battery after the
incident.
"It's going to bring up some pretty
important legal issues," said Crowley.
He said the University should be
viewed legally as a bar or similar drink
ing establishment.
"Stanford should be responsible for
stuff going on where you have alcohol
at parties for students who are un
derage," he said.
"They (the University and fraterni
ties) didn't prpoperly control the situa
tion. ... If you're going to have a bar,
you have to make sure people don't
get killed," he said.
Following the altercation, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons called the
incident a "near-death" situation and
said the three students were "quite

drunk" at the time.
University judicial hearings were
held against all three after the fight, but
those results are confidential, Lyons
said.
None of the three students are en
rolled this quarter, and Crowley said
Curry is suspended for the autumn
quarter.
Von Feldt and McKelvy are both
suspended for autumn quarter, said Ed
Davila, defense attorney for Von Feldt.
Crowley claims the national frater
nity organizations and local chapters
share responsibility in the incident.
"We're seeking an action against the
national (fraternities) as well," he said.
On the night of the altercation, the
DUs reportedly continued to serve al
cohol after the 10 p.m. curfew set by
the Intrafraternity Council. Rush par
ties and social activities for the DUs
were subsequently banned by the Uni
versity.
However, the incident was not cited
by the University three weeks later
when it revoked recognition of the
DUs for two years and terminated the
fraternity's housing privileges.
Curry was driven home by a DU
member and taken to Cowell Health
Center by Joe Henri, resident assistant
at Curry's T wain residence, alter die
freshman complained that he could
not breathe.
He was later moved to Stanford
Hospital's Intensive Care Unit.
Last week, from his home in Fair
mont, Minn., Von Feldt said: "I feel real
bad about the incident. I would do it
real differently if 1 had to do it over
again."
He also said he has been in touch
with McKelvy throughout the last few
months since the incident.
"We've been going through the
whole diing together," he said.
Von Feldt said he, McKelvy and
Curry spent most of the night at the DU
Rush party.
"A nerve has been touched, a lot of
people have been calling," Crowley
said.
McKelvy had a preliminary examina
tion hearing in which the district attor
ney proved that there was probable
cause to prosecute the student on a
felony battery charge, Davila said.
