Soviets may be softening on SDI
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz said yesterday that
the Soviet Union may be softening the adamant resistance to Strategic
Defense Initiative testing that broke up the Reykjavik summit and relaxing
its insistence that agreement on separate disarmament issues must be
linked to a "Star Wars" accord.
In an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press," Shultz rejected criticism
that President Reagan and he "winged it"in offering Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev sweeping arms cuts without preliminary study and allied con
sultation.
"It's the only way to do it," Shultz said, referring to the all-night sessions
in which U.S. negotiators at the summit sought to hammer out agreement
on Gorbachev's proposal for eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weap
ons and a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons in return for confin
ing Star Wars testing to the laboratory.
Shultz s comments on the easing of Soviet opposition to Star Wars test
ing supported a flurry of reports that Moscow was reconsidering its tough
stand against all testing outside the laboratory of elements of the U.S. anti
missile defense project. U.S. allies have reported that Soviet officials indi
cated to them that Moscow could accept testing of ground-based intercep
tor missiles and lasers that would form part of the Star Wars system, al
though the allies said the Kremlin held to its stand against testing in space.
OPEC to increase oil prices
GENEVA — Saudi Arabia's oil minister said yesterday that OPEC may
renew its temporary oil production quota system within 24 hours and
reportedly predicted that this would mean a jump in oil prices.
It was announced that a full OPEC session scheduled for yesterday was
postponed until today. The oil ministers met informally instead in small
groups throughout the day.
Javier Teran, Ecuador's oil minister, said the postponement was needed
to give the ministers more time to work out a compromise on Kuwait's
demand for a larger production quota.
The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
been meeting since Oct. 6 trying to agree on a permanent formula for
limiting oil production as a means of reversing the downward spiral of oil
prices. A world oil glut has driven down prices.
Saudi Arabia cleared the way for a possible compromise Saturday by
saying it no longer opposed a two-month renewal of the temporary system
of production controls, which is due to expire Oct. 31.
Kuwait's al-Watan newspaper yesterday quoted Sheik Ahmed Yamani as
saying the accord would probably boost oil prices from their present levels
of $14 to $16 a barrel.
"We predict an upward movement in oil prices as a result of the agree
ment's renewal," he reportedly said. "But barring such accord, prices will
undoubtedly collapse."
Hasenfus to be tried in Managua
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Eugene Hasenfus, 45, of Marinette, Wis., a crew
member of a munitions-laden plane shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5,
goes on trial here today in a proceeding that promises to be as much an ex
ercise in propaganda as in Sandinista justice.
Hasenfus faces judgment by one of the Sandinistas Popular Anti-
Somocista Tribunals, special courts that hear political and subversion
cases. Charges against him will be announced today, and there is little
doubt among local observers that he will be accused and eventually con
victed of illegally ferrying arms into Nicaragua destined for U.S.-backed
guerrillas fighting the government in the countryside.
Hasenfus parachuted safely from a C-123 transport plane hit with a
surface-to-air missile fired by Sandinista soldiers. Two other Americans,
pilot William Cooper of Reno and co-pilot Wallace Sawyer of Magnolia,
Ark., died in the downed plane, which Hasenfus has said publicly em
barked from El Salvador with a load of weapons and ammunition.
"Justice must be done," President Daniel Ortega said during a weekend
press conference. "The airplane was caught... in the middle of the act."
The prosecutor can be expected to offer evidence not only on Hasenfus'
ill-fated flight but also on U.S. support for the contras, as the anti-Sandinista
guerrillas are called.
Greek Socialist party defeated
ATHENS — Greek voters handed Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
his second rebuke in a week yesterday as the New Democracy party swept
to victory in nationwide municipal elections.
Papandreou's opponents seized control by wide margins in Greece's
three largest cities, Athens, Piraeus and Salonica, and early returns showed
them likely to upset the prime minister's forces in scores of towns and
villages.
His Panhellenic Socialist Movement, which has had contentious relations
with the United States and most of the rest of Western Europe since 1981,
suffered stinging setbacks in more than 200 of the country's 300 sizeable
towns in the first round of municipal elections a week ago, forcing the
runoff elections that were held yesterday.
Greek political analysts said the near-landslide for the conservative New
Democracy reflected a nationwide disillusionment with Papandreou's aus
.crity policies that have frozen wages, slowed imports and curbed public
spending in a desperate effort to curb the country's 24 percent inflation
and $3 billion current accounts deficit.
Peace talks revived in Manila
MANILA, Philippines — Government negotiators met for almost three
hours over the weekend with representatives of the Communist Party and
its military wing, the New People's Army, reviving at least for the moment
the cease-fire talks that collapsed last month.
The secret meeting Saturday at an undisclosed location in Manila was re
ported in yesterday's Manila Bulletin newspaper and later confirmed by a
spokesman for Human Rights Committee Chairman Jose Diokno, who
leads the governmental negotiating panel. The spokesman declined to give
details.
The meeting came three weeks after the unexpected arrest of a top Com
munist leader threatened to scuttle President Corazon Aquino's quest of a
negotiated cease-fire and settlement of the 17-year-old insurgency.
The meeting came one day after Aquino held a separate meeting with
Communist representatives in Iloilo city and agreed to set up a negotiating
panel to discuss a separate regional cease-fire for Panay Island south of
here
Killings by city police decline
WASHINGTON — The nation's big-city police killed 50 percent fewer
citizens in 1984 than they did 14 years earlier, and much of the decline
resulted from fewer police killings of blacks, a study by the Washington
based Crime Control Institute reported yesterday.
Over the same span of years, the number of police killed in the 50 cities
surveyed dropped two-thirds, according to the study, even though overall
violence in the cities was somewhat higher.
At least 353 citizens were killed by police in the 50 cities in 1971,
compared with 172 were killed in 1984, the study found. Police killed by
citizens went from 19 in 1971 to a peak of 38 in 1975 and then dropped to
13 in 1984.
The sharp decrease in the number of blacks killed by police occurred
despite little change in the black arrest rate, the study said. The institute's
data on black deaths was drawn from a National Urban League study of
blacks killed by police from 1970 to 1979 in 54 cities with populations
more than 250,000
The ratio between black and white deaths at police hands dropped from
7 to 1 in 1971 to 2 5 to 1 in 1978 <ind 2.8 to 1 in 1979, the study said.

doubt among local observers that he will be accused and eventually con
victed of illegally ferrying arms into Nicaragua destined for U.S.-backed
guerrillas fighting the government in the countryside.
Hasenfus parachuted safely from a C-123 transport plane hit with a
surface-to-air missile fired by Sandinista soldiers. Two other Americans,
pilot William Cooper of Reno and co-pilot Wallace Sawyer of Magnolia,
Ark., died in the downed plane, which Hasenfus has said publicly em
barked from El Salvador with a load of weapons and ammunition.
"Justice must be done," President Daniel Ortega said during a weekend
press conference. "The airplane was caught... in the middle of the act."
The prosecutor can be expected to offer evidence not only on Hasenfus'
ill-fated flight but also on U.S. support for the contras, as the anti-Sandinista
guerrillas are called.
Greek Socialist party defeated
ATHENS — Greek voters handed Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
his second rebuke in a week yesterday as the New Democracy party swept
to victory in nationwide municipal elections.
Papandreou's opponents seized control by wide margins in Greece's
three largest cities, Athens, Piraeus and Salonica, and early returns showed
them likely to upset the prime minister's forces in scores of towns and
villages.
His Panhellenic Socialist Movement, which has had contentious relations
with the United States and most of the rest of Western Europe since 1981,
suffered stinging setbacks in more than 200 of the country's 300 sizeable
towns in the first round of municipal elections a week ago, forcing the
runoff elections that were held yesterday.
Greek political analysts said the near-landslide for the conservative New
Democracy reflected a nationwide disillusionment with Papandreou's aus
.crity policies that have frozen wages, slowed imports and curbed public
spending in a desperate effort to curb the country's 24 percent inflation
and $3 billion current accounts deficit.
Peace talks revived in Manila
MANILA, Philippines — Government negotiators met for almost three
hours over the weekend with representatives of the Communist Party and
its military wing, the New People's Army, reviving at least for the moment
the cease-fire talks that collapsed last month.
The secret meeting Saturday at an undisclosed location in Manila was re
ported in yesterday's Manila Bulletin newspaper and later confirmed by a
spokesman for Human Rights Committee Chairman Jose Diokno, who
leads the governmental negotiating panel. The spokesman declined to give
details.
The meeting came three weeks after the unexpected arrest of a top Com
munist leader threatened to scuttle President Corazon Aquino's quest of a
negotiated cease-fire and settlement of the 17-year-old insurgency.
The meeting came one day after Aquino held a separate meeting with
Communist representatives in Iloilo city and agreed to set up a negotiating
panel to discuss a separate regional cease-fire for Panay Island south of
here
Killings by city police decline
WASHINGTON — The nation's big-city police killed 50 percent fewer
citizens in 1984 than they did 14 years earlier, and much of the decline
resulted from fewer police killings of blacks, a study by the Washington
based Crime Control Institute reported yesterday.
Over the same span of years, the number of police killed in the 50 cities
surveyed dropped two-thirds, according to the study, even though overall
violence in the cities was somewhat higher.
At least 353 citizens were killed by police in the 50 cities in 1971,
compared with 172 were killed in 1984, the study found. Police killed by
citizens went from 19 in 1971 to a peak of 38 in 1975 and then dropped to
13 in 1984.
The sharp decrease in the number of blacks killed by police occurred
despite little change in the black arrest rate, the study said. The institute's
data on black deaths was drawn from a National Urban League study of
blacks killed by police from 1970 to 1979 in 54 cities with populations
more than 250,000
The ratio between black and white deaths at police hands dropped from
7 to 1 in 1971 to 2 5 to 1 in 1978 <ind 2.8 to 1 in 1979, the study said.

Soviets may be softening on SDI
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz said yesterday that
the Soviet Union may be softening the adamant resistance to Strategic
Defense Initiative testing that broke up the Reykjavik summit and relaxing
its insistence that agreement on separate disarmament issues must be
linked to a "Star Wars" accord.
In an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press," Shultz rejected criticism
that President Reagan and he "winged it"in offering Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev sweeping arms cuts without preliminary study and allied con
sultation.
"It's the only way to do it," Shultz said, referring to the all-night sessions
in which U.S. negotiators at the summit sought to hammer out agreement
on Gorbachev's proposal for eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weap
ons and a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons in return for confin
ing Star Wars testing to the laboratory.
Shultz s comments on the easing of Soviet opposition to Star Wars test
ing supported a flurry of reports that Moscow was reconsidering its tough
stand against all testing outside the laboratory of elements of the U.S. anti
missile defense project. U.S. allies have reported that Soviet officials indi
cated to them that Moscow could accept testing of ground-based intercep
tor missiles and lasers that would form part of the Star Wars system, al
though the allies said the Kremlin held to its stand against testing in space.
OPEC to increase oil prices
GENEVA — Saudi Arabia's oil minister said yesterday that OPEC may
renew its temporary oil production quota system within 24 hours and
reportedly predicted that this would mean a jump in oil prices.
It was announced that a full OPEC session scheduled for yesterday was
postponed until today. The oil ministers met informally instead in small
groups throughout the day.
Javier Teran, Ecuador's oil minister, said the postponement was needed
to give the ministers more time to work out a compromise on Kuwait's
demand for a larger production quota.
The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
been meeting since Oct. 6 trying to agree on a permanent formula for
limiting oil production as a means of reversing the downward spiral of oil
prices. A world oil glut has driven down prices.
Saudi Arabia cleared the way for a possible compromise Saturday by
saying it no longer opposed a two-month renewal of the temporary system
of production controls, which is due to expire Oct. 31.
Kuwait's al-Watan newspaper yesterday quoted Sheik Ahmed Yamani as
saying the accord would probably boost oil prices from their present levels
of $14 to $16 a barrel.
"We predict an upward movement in oil prices as a result of the agree
ment's renewal," he reportedly said. "But barring such accord, prices will
undoubtedly collapse."
Hasenfus to be tried in Managua
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Eugene Hasenfus, 45, of Marinette, Wis., a crew
member of a munitions-laden plane shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5,
goes on trial here today in a proceeding that promises to be as much an ex
ercise in propaganda as in Sandinista justice.
Hasenfus faces judgment by one of the Sandinistas Popular Anti-
Somocista Tribunals, special courts that hear political and subversion
cases. Charges against him will be announced today, and there is little
doubt among local observers that he will be accused and eventually con
victed of illegally ferrying arms into Nicaragua destined for U.S.-backed
guerrillas fighting the government in the countryside.
