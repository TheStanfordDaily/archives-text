# Soviets expel U.S. diplomats

MOSCOW â€” The Soviet Union ex
pelled five American diplomats on
spying charges yesterday, and Secre
tary of State George Shultz immedi
ately said that the United States would
take unspecified action in response.
Records available here showed no
precedent for such a mass expulsion of
Americans from Moscow in the 53-year
history of U.S.-Soviet relations.
The announcement came after the
last five of 25 Soviet diplomats as
signed to the Kremlin's mission at the
United Nations in New York City left
for home after being ordered to leave
by Washington in an unprecedented
move.
But there was no reference to the
expulsions of Soviet staff from New
York in the terse announcement here
about the diplomats officially declared
to be unwelcome.
However, Soviet officials in the past
have branded the expulsions from
their U.N. mission as illegal and have
vowed to take retaliatory measures.
Shultz, appearing on a television in
terview program in the United States,
said ti;at President Reagan would
decide on appropriate action to take in
response to the ouster order.
"We will protest and will take some
action," Shultz said, but he did not

specify what steps the United States
might take now.
The Soviet Foreign Ministry accused
the five Americans of engaging in
"actions which are incompatible with
their official status," the usual
diplomatic jargon for espionage.
A three-paragraph announcement by
TASS, the official Soviet news agency,
provided no details of the diplomats'
alleged activities but concluded: "The
attention of the U.S. Embassy was again
drawn to facts of the continuing use of
American diplomatic missions in the

Soviet Union for illegal activities
against the Soviet Union, and the
demand was made that appropriate
measures be taken to stop them. "
A U.S. Embassy spokesman identi
fied the five diplomats as William Nor
ville, a first secretary; Charles Eh
renfried, a third secretary; David Harris
and Gary Lonnquist, attaches, all from
Moscow; and Jack Roberts, a member
of the consular staff at the U.S. Consu
late in Leningrad.
The spokesman, however, declined
to describe their duties, invoking the
customary embassy practice of refus
ing to comment on accusations of
spying.
There was no indication how much
time they were given to get out of the
country.
The expulsion order came nearly
three weeks after the dramatic
departure of American journalist Nich
olas Daniloff, who was accused of
spying but was not tried.
It was shortly after DanilofFs release
from a KGB prison into the custody of
the U.S. Embassy here that Washington
directed the departure by Oct. 1 of 25
Soviets from Moscow's U.N. mission
under accusations of spying.
Yesterday in the United States, an in
terviewer on NBC's "Meet the Press"

asked Shultz if all 25 of the Soviet
diplomats expelled by Washington
were indeed spies, and Shultz replied:
"They are people that we feel have
some connection with espionage activ
ity, or at least are affiliated with units in
the Soviet Union that engage in that ac
tivity.
Aside from Daniloff, who TASS also
said was expelled, the last American to
be kicked out of Moscow was Erik
Sites, an embassy attache ousted in May
after being accused of spying. In March
another diplomat, Michael Sellers, was
also thrown out on espionage charges.
Both had left the country by the time
the actions against them were made
public.
Their ousters were attributed by
some analysts to disclosures by Ed
ward Lee Howard, a former employee
of the CIA who defected to the Soviet
Union and is now reported to be living
on the outskirts of Moscow.
While he was working for the CIA,
Howard was being groomed for as
signment in Moscow, and he ap
parently provided the KGB with infor
mation about an American espionage
network that resulted in several Soviet
agents being arrested. At least one of
the latter was reportedly executed.
