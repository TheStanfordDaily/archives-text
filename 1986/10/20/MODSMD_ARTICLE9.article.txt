# Deukmejian holds lead in poll

### 
LOS ANGELES — California Gov. George Deuk
mejian is coasting with a 10-point lead in his re
election bid as Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley,
capitalizing on the voters' concern over toxic pollu
tion, struggles to gain ground in the final days of
their bitter race, according to The Los Angeles Times
Poll.
Two big things the Republican governor has going
for him in the voters' view are factors that often help
incumbent officeholders: leadership and experience.
Added to that in Deukmejian's case are the politi
cal advantages he has been able to generate by
strongly opposing unpopular California Chief Justice
Rose Bird and also by becoming known to voters as a
"law and order" governor who holds down state
spending.
Among registered voters regarded by The Times
Poll as likely to cast ballots on Nov. 4, Deukmejian
leads Bradley by 51 percent to 41 percent, with 8 per
cent undecided. This represents a gain of five points
for the Democratic challenger since a similar survey

by The Times Poll in early September, when Deuk
mejian led 51 percent to 36 percent.
Clearly, Bradley's best campaign issue is the one
he has been using aggressively throughout the race,
with heavy emphasis in television commercials: a
charge that Deukmejian has mismanaged the cleanup
of toxic dumps and even sometimes sided with toxic
polluters who have contributed to his campaign. The
governor has adamantly denied the accusations,
which have left him and his advisers deeply embit
tered toward the mayor.
But the effectiveness of the toxics issue for Bradley
was measured several ways by The Times Poll. For
one thing, likely voters placed "toxic pollution" at
the top of the list when asked to identify "the single
most important issue" in the gubernatorial cam
paign. And people who regarded it as the most im
portant issue favored Bradley by a 5-4 ratio.
Additionally, Bradley appears to have enhanced his
political advantage on this issue by strongly support
ing Proposition 65, the popular anti-toxics ballot ini

tiative, which Deukmejian opposes.
The second most important issue in the voters'
eyes, behind toxics, was Chief Justice Bird — a big
advantage for Deukmejian. Bradley has remained
neutral on Bird's uphill reconfirmation effort, while
Deukmejian consistently has attacked her for over
turning death penalty sentences. Among people who
regarded Bird as the campaign's most important
issue, Deukmejian was favored by a whopping ratio
of more than 2 to 1.
The governor, a former state attorney general and
self-described fiscal conservative, also has carved
out niches on law and order and state spending. They
each rank in the mid-priority range of most impor
tant issues. And people mainly concerned about
them favored Deukmejian by overwhelming ratios of
better than 2 to 1.
The drug problem ranked third on the list of im
portant issues. But neither candidate seemed to be
able to capitalize politically on the voters' concern.
