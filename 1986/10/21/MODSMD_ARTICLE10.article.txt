# Superpower relations risked by expulsions

### 
MOSCOW â€” A spokesman for the
Kremlin, which ordered five U.S. en
voys expelled after the State Depart
ment sent 25 Soviet U.N. diplomats
packing, said further tit-for-tat
measures could make superpower re
lations "cool down to zero."
But in Washington, Secretary of State
George Shultz responded to Sunday's
expulsion orders by saying, "We will
protest and we will take some action."
The official Soviet news agency Tass
said four U.S. diplomats in Moscow
and one in Leningrad had been ord
ered to leave after the Foreign Mini
stry determined they had engaged in
"impermissible activities."
The term is a diplomatic catch
phrase for espionage.
The five are Jack Roberts of the U.S.
consulate in Leningrad and four
diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow: William Norville, a first secre
tary, Charles Ehrenfried, a third secre
tary, and attaches Gary Lonnquist and
David Harris.
Tass did not say when the five must
leave.
The Tass announcement did not
mention the U.S. expulsions of the So
viet diplomats from the United Na
tions, but Georgy Arbatov, a chief
Kremlin spokesman, indicated that the
Soviets were retaliating.

Arbatov spoke in a satellite interview
from Moscow on the CBS-TV program
"Face the Nation."
"The Americans will (see that) Mr.
Gorbachev is a very forthcoming man
if he has good partners. But if you be
have in such a way he becomes very
tough," Arbatov said, referring to So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
"It can cool down to zero in both
countries if you go on this way of
retaliation after retaliation," Arbatov
said.
Shultz, appearing on the NBC-TV
program "Meet the Press," said it is up
to President Reagan to determine what
action to take.
In March, the United States ordered
Moscow to reduce its U.N. Mission staff
by 105 people over a two-year period.
The State Department alleged many of
the diplomats were engaged in
espionage.
In September, two days before So
viet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze arrived in the United
States for talks with Reagan and Shultz,
Washington issued a specific list of 25
Soviets it accused of using their U.N.
status as a cover for spying.
The last of the expelled Soviets left
New York on Tuesday.
