# GM pulls out fully
## 
### 
DETROIT â€” General Motors
Corp. announced yesterday that it
was pulling out of South Africa, a
move Chairman Roger Smith attrib
uted to both financial losses and
that nation's reluctance to abolish
apartheid.
General Motors, the second
largest U.S. employer in South
Africa, behind Mobil, according to
the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center in Washington, D.C.,
has annual sales in the $300-million
range and a 2,800-member
workforce that is predominantly
non-white.
GM South Africa is expected to
be sold to a group headed by the
South African management at its
Port Elizabeth car and truck assem
bly plant. The purchase price was
not disclosed.
Smith said GM was "struggling
desperately" in South Africa be
cause of the nation's economy. He
said the company's sales and mar
ket share have dropped substan
tially in the past year and no quick
improvement was foreseen.
Smith said the proposed sale also
was a result of the South African
government's slowness in eliminat
ing apartheid.
"The ongoing economic reces
sion in that country, along with this
lack of progress has made operat

ing in the South African environ
ment increasingly difficult," he said.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker has
been under pressure externally and
internally to divest its South African
interests. In May, in response to a
proposal by an investors' group,
Smith announced that GMSA would
no longer sell vehicles to the South
African police and military.
However, GMSA had only sold 11
vehicles to either branch in 1986
One of GM's board members is
Leon Sullivan, the Philadephia mini
ster who devised the Sullivan prin
ciples, a set of guidelines for the
employment and treatment of
blacks by businesses operating in
South Africa.
GM is suffering from losses not
stemmed by deep-discount sales in
centives it offered from late August
to early October to clear out its in
ventory backlog in the United
States.
It is expected to show a third
quarter operating loss of at least
$100 million when results are
released later this week. Ford
Motor Co., the No. 2 U.S.
automaker, is expected to show a
profit, the industry journal
Automotive News reported in yes
terday's editions.
