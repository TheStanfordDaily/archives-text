## Calling All Feminists 
### 
Most women at Stanford espouse
notions of sexual equality, but few
identify themselves as feminists.
Some might blame apathy.
I would blame fear.
Feminism has acquired a
negative connotation at Stanford,
and elsewhere. It is seen here as a
radical fringe movement, a group of
men-haters bound together by a set
of opinions that are at odds with
femininity.
Visible campus feminists and
feminist groups are usually seen as
having a radical bent, aggravating
the misperception. The newspaper
Aurora, as an example, has main
tained a radical tone in recent years.
I haven't taken any Feminist
Studies courses that teach the social
science jargon needed to expound
the difficulties of feminism in the
80s, but it doesn't take a specialist
to note that there's a problem at
Stanford.
Most Stanford students believe
that women are as bright and as ca
pable as men, that women in
America are often handicapped by
an unjust society, that the nation is
moving in the right direction, but
that the movement toward equality
could go a little faster.
Yet so few of those students
choose to call themselves feminists
or speak out for equality.
What has happened here is that
the radical feminists have alienated

much of the community. Many
feminist women are afraid to be, or
have no desire to be, associated
with Stanford's radical feminists.
Many men feel threatened by the
radicals' views. (An "all men are
evil" viewpoint in The Daily a
couple years ago certainly had me
on the defensive.)
The point, though, is not that the
radicals should soften their tone.
Rather, there is simply a need for
additional voices to expand the
debate.
The absence of a vocal, moderate
group of feminists at Stanford per
petuates the antagonistic relation
ship between the outspoken
feminists and the rest of the com
munity. When people feel alienated
or threatened by feminists, they
seem often to discredit the entire
cause.
The process is cyclical: When
people discredit the cause, many
women choose not to associate
themselves with feminism, ensur
ing that the all-important moderate
voice is not heard enough.
There is of course no prescrip
tion for how to be a feminist. For
some it is speaking at rallies, for
others it is writing magazine articles
and for many it is merely discussing
issues with friends.
It seems a shame, though, that
any woman should remain silent in
fear of the feminist label.
