A Daily article yesterday implied that
Bill McKelvy and Randy Von Feldt were
found guilty on felony battery charges.
McKelvy entered a plea of no contest
on the condition that his charge be
reduced to fighting in public, a mis
demeanor, and Von Feldt pled no con
test to felony battery.
The Daily regrets the error.
