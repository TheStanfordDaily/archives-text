### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
Stanford's fraternity Rush system will
be reviewed by members of this year's
pledge class in a first-of-its-kind
meeting sponsored by the Interfrater
nity Council (IFC) tonight.
The IFC invited pledges, pledge
trainers and fraternity presidents to the
meeting. Four different topics will be
addressed: the Rush system in general;
hazing regulations; guidelines regard
ing party planning and the University's
alcohol policy; and the forging of
friendships between members of dif
ferent fraternities, according to Frater
nal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano, the only
administrator invited to speak at the
meeting. ,
Tonight's meeting is part of a thor
ough examination of the Rush system
by the IFC, according to Pisano. He
described the event as a wonderful op
portunity for the IFC to gather and
share information.
IFC President Steve Singleton said
the meeting was prompted in pan by
Norm Robinson, associate dean of Res
idential Education for Student Affairs,
who has expressed his general dissatis
faction with the Rush system.
Robinson has criticized the Rush sys
tem for its length, overall structure and
focus on alcohol, Singleton said. The
IFC plans to distribute among audi

ence members a survey which ad
dresses these three topics, he added.
While questions regarding the role
alcohol plays in the system has caused
many to consider instituting a dry Hush
in the future, it is "much too early to
predict' whether alcohol will be
eliminated from the system, Singleton
said.
But Pisano, an advocate of dry Rush,
said he believes the change "is prob
ably coming ... in some way it is going
to happen." Such a system could come
voluntarily or as a m;indate from the
University, he said.
It is "hard to justify a wet Rush,"
Pisano said, citing high costs and the
fact freshmen and sophomores make
up most of the pledge classes even
though the drinking age in California is
21.
Pisano pointed to other recent prob
lems related to a wet Rush. "I think the
David Curry incident is directly related
to alcohol being served," he said, re
ferring to a fight that erupted between
three students after a Rush party last
year. The fight left Curry hospitalized
in the intensive care unit.
Curry has filed a suit against the two
students involved, the University and
the Delta Upsilon and Sigma Chi frater
nities.
Tonight's meeting will be held in
Kresge Auditorium at 7 p.m.
