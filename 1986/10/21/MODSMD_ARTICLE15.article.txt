The foreign journalist must put up with a great deal of
inconvenience in his effort to convey the news of a dis
tant land to his home country — bureaucracy, the lan
guage barrier, closed political systems, government
threats and propaganda. Lately, the United States and the
Soviet Union have added new threats to the flow of inter
national communication.
Last week, a Colombian journalist was intercepted at
Kennedy International Airport in New York and, for no
apparent reason, was detained for five days in a maxi
mum security federal prison in Manhattan before she
was deported back to Colombia. A foreign journalist
clearly does not have the same legal rights as a U.S. citi
zen, but the detention of Patricia Lara violates the prin
ciples of a society that prides itself on its openness and
willingness to assume an individual innocent until
proven guilty.
U.S. officials refused to specify why Lara was seized.
The best explanation they could offer was an obscure
reference to three sections of U.S. immigration law
that prohibit entrance to anyone authorities deem
likely to "engage in subversive activities," anyone who
applies for entry with an invalid visa or anyone whose
presence "would be prejudicial to the public interest or
endanger the security of the United States." These are
very strong words, considering that the biggest crime
the 35-year-old reporter from El Tiempo seems to have
committed is writing a book profiling Colombian guer
rilla leaders and a few articles critical of the Reagan ad
ministration's Central American policy.
What makes the case all the more ironic is the fact that
Lara traveled to the United States to accept an award

from Columbia University "for distinguished contribu
tions to the advancement of inter-American understand
ing and freedom of information." Columbia University
President Michael Sovern's assessment that the incident
was "anathema to a free society" is an understated analy
sis. Lara's detention was nothing short of a crime, and, if
the U.S. government wants any sympathy, it could at least
reveal what makes Lara such a menace.
The United States was on the other side of the fence
only two months ago, when the Soviet Union seized the
Moscow correspondent for U.S. News & World Report,
Nicholas Daniloff. Washington, with good reason,
howled about that incident, charging the Soviets with
framing Daniloff and violating the expected rights of
foreign journalists. Many in the United States interpreted
DanilofFs seizure as indicative of a harsh society that
abuses individual rights and obstructs travel and the flow
of information.
The two cases are clearly different — in the Daniloff
case, the Soviet Union was interested in obtaining the
release of a diplomat held in New York on spying
charges — but the heart of the matter is the same in the
two incidents: The governments incarcerated the
reporters on the basis of flimsy or nonexistant evidence.
Never has international reporting been so important.
A moment's reflection causes one to realize that almost
everything one knows about the world comes via a
foreign news bureau. Only with the assistance of an un
obstructed flow of information can the world's leaders
and citizens be truly informed to make the important
decisions. And every country — whether closed or open
— has an interest in information.
