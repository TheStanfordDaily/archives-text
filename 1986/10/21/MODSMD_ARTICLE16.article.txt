# 55 speed limit unnecessary
## 
### 
Last week, in the rush to adjourn, Congress gave little
notice to a resolution that would give individual states more
authority in declaring speed limits on their highways. That's
a pity. In its current state, the 55 miles per hour (mph) na
tional speed limit is not only an embarrassment to the legal
system, it's a counter-productive threat.

It's not like the government doesn't know that people are
against the limit; while 47 percent of Californians polled
said they supported the limit, 74 percent admitted to break
ing it. In feet, it's almosrcertain that more than that number
have broken the speed limit. Call it a matter of "voting with
one's right foot," if you will, but the masses have spoken: We
don't need this law.
Consider when and why the 55 mph limit came around; it
was enacted in 1974 to deal with the Arab oil embargo. It
was hoped that the law would help lessen gasoline con
sumption. It has; fuel consumption is estimated to have
been cut by an underwhelming 1 to 2 percent. Of course,
while there could always be more oil shortages, the cars
driven have mutated into an economy-conscious variety. In
1974, no one got 40 or 50 miles to a gallon, nor did anyone
care. Now, the best selling car is the Ford Escort, which gets
40 miles per gallon. Regardless of the duration of the pres
ent oil glut, fuel consumption can't be used as a justification
of the 55 mph limit.
A byproduct of the 55 mph speed limit was an increase in
highway safety. This is now the only valid argument for
keeping the limit. It's estimated that upping the national
speed limit to 65 mph would result in an additional 500
deaths on the highways per year. That's somewhere around
0.0002 percent of the U.S. population. Even that safety figure
may be inaccurate, since highway fatalities have dropped in
the last six years, while the average speed has increased.
The safety freaks would like to assume that the 55 mph limit
saves lives, while simultaneously ignoring increases in seat
belt use and child-restraint devices, improvements in car
design, the advances of medicine in treating crash victims
and (perhaps most significant of all) the national crackdown
on drunk driving. TTie National Research Council, which
studied the limit's effect on safety, suggested that "prudent

exceptions [to the present limit] could still yield benefits
without a proportional loss of safety."
There are other effects of the law which few have ever
bothered to investigate. For one thing, the federal govern
ment's insistence on enforcing the law and the steps it has
taken in enforcement efforts, show the contempt Washing
ton has for the people as a whole. Essentially, it boils down
to the feds cutting off 10 percent of a state's federal highway
money if a majority of motorists still break the limit. This
forces states to assign more and more police officers to
catching "speeders" than would otherwise be desirable.
Police complain that this shortchanges other efforts, drunk
driving patrols in particular. Even with added enforcement,
some states still fail to meet the fed's guidelines. As punish
ment for this, Arizona and Vermont were slapped with
"fines" of $5.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
Nevada, in fact, recently set a speed limit of 70 mph on one
rural piece of road, to which the Department of Transporta
tion (DOT) responded with the threat of a total funds cutoff.
On the part of the federal government, this basically
amounts to "fiscal terrorism."
On the bright side, some states are rebelling against the
DOT. Driving 65 mph in Montana or Nevada yields a $4
ticket, not necessarily for speeding but for "wasting motor
fuel." Nebraska and both of the Dakotas charge $10 for the
same offense, in all cases without any points towards revoca
tion of one's driving licence. What these states are pushing
for is the right to up the speed limit to 65 mph on less
travelled, wide-open pieces of expressway. The reasons
given are that people are driving this anyway, and it would
be better to have drivers doing a legal 65 mph out in the
country (on roads designed for 75 mph traffic) than to have
them doing the same illegally, in less safe parts of highway
(e.g., urban stretches of the road).
Unfortunately, there are enough people who still believe
in the 55 mph limit to keep lawmakers from wanting to be
involved in dismembering it. As a top Reagan aide put it:
"It's not a battle we want to fight." Instead, senators and rep
resentatives would rather have their names on legislation
like the ill-conceived, recently passed drug bill. Until con
gressmen hear from enough voters who want to get rid of
the 55 mph limit, the speeding, the misappropriation of
police manpower and the fiscal terrorism will continue.
Write your representative; it's a start. You may not convince
your congressman, but he may have made up his mind to
avoid the issue before he even ran for office. That's too bad.
