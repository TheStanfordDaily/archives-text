# Reagan's peaceful policy
## 
### 
Since my return to Stanford, I have
read The Daily in hopes of finding a
column which would so offend my
regard for scholarly discourse and in
tellectual debate that it would force a
response. The pseudo-intellectual
claptrap written by Scott Bohning
(Daily, Oct. 17) is such a column.
Mr. Bohning attempts to sustain a
case that President Reagan's desire to
employ the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) is a sham designed to allow the
United States to carry out a nuclear first
strike against the Soviet Union in order
to consign the "evil empire" to the ash
heap of history. He argues that Reagan
has purposefully manipulated the
American people and Congress to
build significant first-strike weapons in
order to make this vision of holocaust
possible.

In order to substantiate his case,
Bohning outlines his own version of
recent "strategic history." He points
out that the 1984 Republican platform
calls for the achievement of nuclear su
periority. It is clear that he knows little
of the American political process if he
relies on such evidence. The Republi
can platform in question also calls for
the repeal of the 55 miles per hour
speed limit; in the 1980 Republican
platform, there is reference to repeal
of the Panama Canal treaties. In addi
tion, it is routine for state Republican
platforms to call for the abolition of the
Internal Revenue Service.
Typically, these political platforms
are drafted in the "ideological fever"
that accompanies the national
nominating conventions. One could as
easily cite Reagan's oft-repeated prom
ise to give SDI to the Soviet Union to
be deployed in tandem with our own.
Of course, this would not strengthen
the left-wing folderol which Bohning
finds so easy to spout.
Bohning states that "phony charges
of Soviet arms control treaty violations
were advanced" by the Reagan admin
istration. It is clear that Bohning has
done little or no academic study of the
history of arms control. Serious
proponents of arms control (whether
they reside on the left or right of the
ideological spectrum) believe that
evidence exists of Soviet violations of
arms control treaties. Typically, they
differ only in the methods of adjudicat
ing such violations (quiet diplomacy or
public criticism) and the calculation of
the damage which such violations
cause to the arms control process it
self.

But one thing is clear: The Soviets
cheat. For example, a large phased
array radar facility in Krasnoyarsk in
central Siberia is thought to be in viola
tion of the ABM treaty because of its
siting, orientation and capability. Basi
cally, the radar exhibits battle manage
ment capabilities for a Soviet missile
defense system, the very thing which
has gotten Bohning's goat.
Bohning contends the United States
deploys first strike weapons in order to
make the Soviets blink in a U.S. effort
to "prop up one of its dictators around
the world." Where is the evidence?
Was nuclear blackmail attempted to
prop up the Shah of Iran, Somoza of
Nicaragua or Marcos of the
Philippines? No. In fact, the last time
anything remotely close to nuclear
blackmail was attempted was to warn
the Soviets not to •intervene in the 1973
Arab-Israeli war and was, in fact, in
response to similar Soviet threats. I
checked, and the Knesset is a
democratically elected parliamentary
body. Can the same be said for the ag
gressors in the 1973 conflict? I think
not.
Further, had Bohning taken the time
to investigate the deployments of U.S.
nuclear forces and their "operational
mission," he would have found that
they are situated in such a way as to
deter Soviet aggression against West
ern Europe, Japan and North America.
Surely, Bohning will admit that these
are not areas run by dictatorships, but,
instead, by duly constituted democratic
governments. And what of Soviet
dominated Eastern Europe and Af
ghanistan? Are these democratic gov
ernments or Soviet-supported
regimes?
If Bohning had made the effort to
find literature on the so-called
"doctrine of waging nuclear war," he
would have discovered that this
doctrine was put in place not by a
militaristic Reagan administration, but
instead, by President Carter, who did
not believe in the morality of mutual
assured destruction. Carter, a man for
whom moral considerations were a
central concern, knew that if a wider
range of options were developed to
respond to Soviet aggression, nuclear
deterrence would Ix; strengthened.
As for deployment of first strike
weapons by the United States, these
are all found in the last Carter adminis
tration defense budget and were re
quested in response to Soviet develop
ment and deployment of similar first
strike weapons.
That President Reagan could enter
office and conceive of a program (SDI)
which renders such civilization-ending
attacks impotent speaks very highly of

his moral commitment to peace. In ad
dition, his decision not to bargain away
SDI speaks even more highly of his
strength and commitment to vision of a
nuclear-free world — one iri which we
are not constantly threatened by the
fear of mass destruction. It must cause
Bohning great consternation to know
that the latest public opinion polls
show that only 16 to 20 percent of the
electorate believe that Reagan made
the wrong decision in Iceland. That
Bohning and those of his ilk are vocal,
no one will deny; that they are in the
minority is just as clearly irrefutable.
I now wish to examine Bohning's
final point, and the one which exhibits
the most insecure grip on logical
reasoning. Bohning asserts that since
governments have not taken action to
prevent World War 111, we must take
action ourselves. He argues that we
should all join him, converge on the
Lockheed facility in Sunnyvale, block
traffic entering the plant and thus "halt
nuclear war preparation" for a day.
It seems to me that governments
(both the U.S. and Soviet, as well as the
French and British) have done an ex
cellent job preventing World War 111.
As I walk through the Stanford campus,
I note that many are enjoying the sun
shine, not huddled in sub-zero tem
peratures awaiting death by radiation
poisoning that World War 111 would
certainly bring.
Additionally, Bohning makes no
clear case whatsoever that joining In a
human lockout of Lockheed vKtt in
crease our personal or national secur
ity. To say the least, this type of action
against national security facilities is
frowned upon by the authorities. I
would guess that such action can only
guarantee that those involved will be
forcibly (maybe even painfully)
removed from the site and incar
cerated at the local county jail. Since it
is also certain that the civilian authori
ties outside Stanford's jurisdiction are
not likely to grant any special consider
ation to Stanford students involved in
such criminal activities, I advise cau
tion.
There are more suitable means one
may take to alert national policymakers
of one's concerns about SDL Granted,
there are many drawbacks to the dem
ocratic process, but one of its highest
attributes is the ease of communicating
with elected representatives.
Finally, I would hope that this
response to Scott Bohning's illogical
diatribe would provoke careful and
thoughtful responses of its own.

deploys first strike weapons in order to
make the Soviets blink in a U.S. effort
to "prop up one of its dictators around
the world." Where is the evidence?
Was nuclear blackmail attempted to
prop up the Shah of Iran, Somoza of
Nicaragua or Marcos of the
Philippines? No. In fact, the last time
anything remotely close to nuclear
blackmail was attempted was to warn
the Soviets not to •intervene in the 1973
Arab-Israeli war and was, in fact, in
response to similar Soviet threats. I
checked, and the Knesset is a
democratically elected parliamentary
body. Can the same be said for the ag
gressors in the 1973 conflict? I think
not.
Further, had Bohning taken the time
to investigate the deployments of U.S.
nuclear forces and their "operational
mission," he would have found that
they are situated in such a way as to
deter Soviet aggression against West
ern Europe, Japan and North America.
Surely, Bohning will admit that these
are not areas run by dictatorships, but,
instead, by duly constituted democratic
governments. And what of Soviet
dominated Eastern Europe and Af
ghanistan? Are these democratic gov
ernments or Soviet-supported
regimes?
If Bohning had made the effort to
find literature on the so-called
"doctrine of waging nuclear war," he
would have discovered that this
doctrine was put in place not by a
militaristic Reagan administration, but
instead, by President Carter, who did
not believe in the morality of mutual
assured destruction. Carter, a man for
whom moral considerations were a
central concern, knew that if a wider
range of options were developed to
respond to Soviet aggression, nuclear
deterrence would Ix; strengthened.
As for deployment of first strike
weapons by the United States, these
are all found in the last Carter adminis
tration defense budget and were re
quested in response to Soviet develop
ment and deployment of similar first
strike weapons.
That President Reagan could enter
office and conceive of a program (SDI)
which renders such civilization-ending
attacks impotent speaks very highly of

his moral commitment to peace. In ad
dition, his decision not to bargain away
SDI speaks even more highly of his
strength and commitment to vision of a
nuclear-free world — one iri which we
are not constantly threatened by the
fear of mass destruction. It must cause
Bohning great consternation to know
that the latest public opinion polls
show that only 16 to 20 percent of the
electorate believe that Reagan made
the wrong decision in Iceland. That
Bohning and those of his ilk are vocal,
no one will deny; that they are in the
minority is just as clearly irrefutable.
I now wish to examine Bohning's
final point, and the one which exhibits
the most insecure grip on logical
reasoning. Bohning asserts that since
governments have not taken action to
prevent World War 111, we must take
action ourselves. He argues that we
should all join him, converge on the
Lockheed facility in Sunnyvale, block
traffic entering the plant and thus "halt
nuclear war preparation" for a day.
It seems to me that governments
(both the U.S. and Soviet, as well as the
French and British) have done an ex
cellent job preventing World War 111.
As I walk through the Stanford campus,
I note that many are enjoying the sun
shine, not huddled in sub-zero tem
peratures awaiting death by radiation
poisoning that World War 111 would
certainly bring.
Additionally, Bohning makes no
clear case whatsoever that joining In a
human lockout of Lockheed vKtt in
crease our personal or national secur
ity. To say the least, this type of action
against national security facilities is
frowned upon by the authorities. I
would guess that such action can only
guarantee that those involved will be
forcibly (maybe even painfully)
removed from the site and incar
cerated at the local county jail. Since it
is also certain that the civilian authori
ties outside Stanford's jurisdiction are
not likely to grant any special consider
ation to Stanford students involved in
such criminal activities, I advise cau
tion.
There are more suitable means one
may take to alert national policymakers
of one's concerns about SDL Granted,
there are many drawbacks to the dem
ocratic process, but one of its highest
attributes is the ease of communicating
with elected representatives.
Finally, I would hope that this
response to Scott Bohning's illogical
diatribe would provoke careful and
thoughtful responses of its own.

Since my return to Stanford, I have
read The Daily in hopes of finding a
column which would so offend my
regard for scholarly discourse and in
tellectual debate that it would force a
response. The pseudo-intellectual
claptrap written by Scott Bohning
(Daily, Oct. 17) is such a column.
Mr. Bohning attempts to sustain a
case that President Reagan's desire to
employ the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) is a sham designed to allow the
United States to carry out a nuclear first
strike against the Soviet Union in order
to consign the "evil empire" to the ash
heap of history. He argues that Reagan
has purposefully manipulated the
American people and Congress to
build significant first-strike weapons in
order to make this vision of holocaust
possible.

TOM DePAUL

In order to substantiate his case,
Bohning outlines his own version of
recent "strategic history." He points
out that the 1984 Republican platform
calls for the achievement of nuclear su
periority. It is clear that he knows little
of the American political process if he
relies on such evidence. The Republi
can platform in question also calls for
the repeal of the 55 miles per hour
speed limit; in the 1980 Republican
platform, there is reference to repeal
of the Panama Canal treaties. In addi
tion, it is routine for state Republican
platforms to call for the abolition of the
Internal Revenue Service.
Typically, these political platforms
are drafted in the "ideological fever"
that accompanies the national
nominating conventions. One could as
easily cite Reagan's oft-repeated prom
ise to give SDI to the Soviet Union to
be deployed in tandem with our own.
Of course, this would not strengthen
the left-wing folderol which Bohning
finds so easy to spout.
Bohning states that "phony charges
of Soviet arms control treaty violations
were advanced" by the Reagan admin
istration. It is clear that Bohning has
done little or no academic study of the
history of arms control. Serious
proponents of arms control (whether
they reside on the left or right of the
ideological spectrum) believe that
evidence exists of Soviet violations of
arms control treaties. Typically, they
differ only in the methods of adjudicat
ing such violations (quiet diplomacy or
public criticism) and the calculation of
the damage which such violations
cause to the arms control process it
self.

But one thing is clear: The Soviets
cheat. For example, a large phased
array radar facility in Krasnoyarsk in
central Siberia is thought to be in viola
tion of the ABM treaty because of its
siting, orientation and capability. Basi
cally, the radar exhibits battle manage
ment capabilities for a Soviet missile
defense system, the very thing which
has gotten Bohning's goat.
