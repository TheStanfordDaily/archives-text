Calendar fosters
unfair stereotypes
Thank you, Scott Shaeffer, for your
column on the "Women of Stanford"
calendar (Daily, Oct. 9). Having been
made "invisible" by the calendar, I
was very glad to see it so strongly
questioned in a widely read campus
medium. I would hope that readers
who disagree based on their aware
ness of their own Stanford experi
ences will try to see the calendar and
Scott's arguments in their much wider
social context, and then perhaps will
re-examine their own lives.
As a woman, 1 have felt the negative
manifestations of the mentality
promoted by the calendar and by
other similar media portrayals of
women. I am neither anorexic nor
depressed, and only a few times have
I personally had to face the choice
between trying to conform and incur
ring measurable social penalties: loss
of respect for job performance, for
example. Social phenomena such as
the calendar under discussion,
however, voice within me a daily and
unwanted reminder of my refusal to
conform. That voice carries with it a
nagging tone of condemnation. Non
conformity is my own decision, and
yet I am too often aware that I lack the
physical attributes and social orienta
tion made the dominant norm by the
creators of the calendar and bv most

popular media. At the very least, this
reminder is a pain in the neck.
The whole mentality that objectifies
women has made a few, thankfully
few, more recognizably violent incur
sions on my life. These have left las
ting memories and keep me often
fearful. Objectification can and often
does lead to degradation, to abuse, to
belief in the right to control. On a
couple of occasioas I have been made
a victim of physical abuse (being
grabbed/handled by a man on an
empty street). Unpleasant verbal
abuse has also been hurled at me on
the streets.
These experiences are common to
many women and non-conformers. I
realize that I have been spared much
worse. The apparent harmlessness of
the calendar and other media
portrayals of women gives them their
insidious character.

Focus on hardship
in United States
Recently, I watched a film on South
Africa and was horrified by the stacks
of rubble that the black communities
call their townships. I was shocked
that any government could support
such poverty and oppression. Surpris
ingly, the slums did not look so un-

familiar. I was surrounded by liberal,
social-minded students watching this
documentary. We were Americans
appalled with the actioas of a country
thousands of miles away. We were so
caught up in international injustices
that we had forgotten about the prob
lems in our own country.
Almost every major urban center in
the United States has a homeless
population that lives in conditions as
bad as the conditions in which blacks
in South Africa live. Across America,
neighborhoods exist that look like
shantytowns. As many of us call for an
end to apartheid, we blind ourselves
from the slums only minutes away in
America, the land of wealth and
freedom. Most of us don't even know
or believe they exist. It's easy to forget
in the environment in which we live.
What is wrong with our system that
allows people to simply ignore
poverty at their own front step?
"Statistically, people are living better
now." I hear that response without fail
every time this issue is brought up.
How can we say we are economically
well-off when three million people,
mostly children, have no homes to
live in? Far more than three million
have no money for food and clothing
and little hope of starting over. Statis
tics and graphs mean nothing to the
thousands of children who live in the
welfare hotels of San Francisco and
New York and Chicago. Kids play
hide-and-seek in the same corridors
that prostitutes and drug dealers

roam. Families of five and six live in
roach-infested rooms the size of our
dorm rooms. There is no excuse for
anyone to live this way, especially in a
country that preaches civil rights.
Victor Vescovo wrote (Daily,
0ct.15) that we should start "focusing
on who are the worst oppressors and
who are the most impoverished vic
tims." Let's start with America. We
cannot passively accept the rosy
picture of wealth and freedom that
our politicians paint today. We must
look around us and end our own
injustices and oppressions before we
can rightly demand that others end
theirs.
