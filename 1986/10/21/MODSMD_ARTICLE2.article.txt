### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Randy Von Feldt, one of three stu
dents involved in a fight that occurred
last spring, was sentenced yesterday in
Santa Clara Superior Court after his
felony battery charge was reduced to
misdemeanor battery, said Ed Davila,
defense attorney for Von Feldt.
Von Feldt was sentenced to one year
of summary probation, a $100 fine and
100 hours of voluntary work by Super
ior Court Judge Daniel Creed. Von
Feldt's sentence was identical to that
received last Wednesday by Bill
McKelvy, a classmate who was also in
volved in the altercation that occurred
after fraternity Rush parties April 11.
McKelvy originally pleaded not
guilty to one count of felony battery,
but changed his plea to no contest on
the condition his charge be amended
to a misdemeanor of fighting in public.
Von Feldt pleaded no contest to a
felony battery charge.
A person under summary probation
does not have to report to a probation
officer on a regular basis but must
"keep his nose clean" for one year,
Davila said.
David Curry, who suffered a col
lapsed lung and two broken ribs in the
fight, filed a lawsuit on Oct. 10 against
Von Feldt, McKelvy, Stanford Univer
sity and the Delta Upsilon and Sigma
Chi fraternities.
Hollis Elliot, the attorney represent
ing McKelvy in criminal proceedings,
claimed Currv has a history
behavior while under the influence of
alcohol which should be taken into ac
count.
Curry, in a preliminary examination
hearing for McKelvy's case, testified
that he (Curry) had 15 beers the night
of the fight, Elliot said.
"(McKelvy) has never been in a fight
in his life before," Elliot said.
But he added: "I'm not condoning
the injuries that occurred to (Curry)."
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano
said that according to the University in
vestigation following the altercation,
the Sigma Chis were not involved in
the incident.
"According to a statement from the
Sigma Chi president, they (the three
freshmen) were promptly asked to
leave and spent only a few minutes
there," he said.
"I have no idea why they were
named (in the lawsuit)," said Scott
Donahey, attorney for the Sigma Chis.
"(The three freshmen) wandered over

there with some DUs and they were
thrown out of the house because it was
after hours."
All DU social and Rush activities
were banned by the University after
the incident. But the altercation was
not cited by the University three weeks
later when it revoked recognition of
the DUs for two years and housing
privileges for the fraternity.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said all three admitted they
had been drinking the night of the inci
dent.
All three students are suspended for
at least the autumn quarter, according
to Davila, and John Crowlev. Curry's at
torney.
Von Feldt will return to campus next
quarter, Davila said.
