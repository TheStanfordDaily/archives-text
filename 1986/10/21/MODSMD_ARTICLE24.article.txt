## Poet brings riches to Farm 
### CHRIS GELPI 
Entering the room, one senses an al
most regal power emanating from the
small woman sitting quietly at her
desk.
"I would go on teaching even if 1
won the lottery," she says with a mis
chievous grin.
The grinning woman is acclaimed
poet and feminist Adrienne Rich, who
has joined the Stanford faculty this fall
on a pan-time appointment to the En
glish Department and the Feminist
Studies Program.
Diane Middlebrook, the director of
the Feminist Studies Program, spotted
the opportunity to invite Rich last year
and presented a proposal to Norman
Wessells, dean of Humanities and
Sciences. Wessells then contacted Al
bert Gelpi, the chairman of the English
Department, who recommended that
Rich be hired.
"There was incredibly strong sup
port for the appointment," Mid
dlebrook says.
Acquiring Rich was seen as a unique
opportunity because she is among the
top scholars in the country in both
poetry and feminist studies.

"There just isn't anybody that does
both of these things with the kind of in
ternational acclaim that she has," Gelpi
says.
Other members of the faculty agree.
Barbara Gelpi, a member of the En
glish Department and the Feminist
Studies program calls Rich "a unique
combination of a poet, a feminist
theorist, a feminist activist and an ex
cellent teacher."
She adds, "I don't know anyone who
combines these qualities so bril
liantly."
Before coming to Stanford, Rich
held a series of full and part-time
teaching positions. Her first appoint
ment was to City College of New York,
where she spent a couple of years
teaching poetry. She then left for a
one-year visiting professorship at Bran
deis University in Waltham, Mass.,
about 30 minutes from Boston.
After returning to City College for
two years, Rich left once again, this
time headed for Douglass, the
women's college at Rutgers. After three
years at Douglass, she left and did not
have any long-term appoinments until
she began teaching part-time at San
Jose State University two years ago.

Last spring, Rich became the first
recipient of the annual Ruth-Lily award,
presented to her in recognition of the
entire body of her poetry. She says she
hopes this prize will make it possible
for her to take next spring off from any
public engagements such as teaching,
readings and speeches, in order to
write.

Although Rich is an
excellent scholar,
she still loves to
teach.

This year, Rich has three books com
ing out: "Your Native Land, Your Life,"
"Blood, Bread, and Poetry" and "Of
Woman Born: Motherhood as Institu
tion and Experience."
The first, a book of poems, was pub
lished last spring.
"Blood, Bread, and Poetry" is a col
lection of essays and reviews that, as Al
bert Gelpi comments, indicate Rich's

"central position as a poet and a
feminist writer."
Finally, "Of Woman Born: Mother
hood as Institution and Experience"
will be reissued upon the 10th anniver
sary of its original publishing. The re
issue of the book, according to Albert
Gelpi, is "recognition that it has
become a classic of feminist writing
during the decade since its publish
ing,"
Although Rich is an excellent
scholar, she still loves to teach and in
teract with students.
Rich will be teaching one course in
the English Department this fall and
one in the Feminist Studies Program.
She describes her English course,
Poetry and Poetics, as "basic what-is
poetry" and "how can we talk about
poems."
She says that she wants to communi
cate to her students that "poetry is so
much more than words on a page,"
that it is "a deeply human art" and a
way of "communicating with one's
community."
Rich's second course is a seminar in
feminist studies in which she hopes to
study the theory of the women's move
ment by looking at its practice. By
doing this, Rich says, She hopes to illus
trate the ways in which feminist theory
relates directly to feminist action and
experience.
Meanwhile, Stanford faculty and
visiting scholars are currently reading
and discussing Rich's "Your Native
Land, Your Life" in the faculty seminar
on feminist theory this quarter, accord
ing to Middlebrook.
Thus far, at least one student has
found that Rich's lecturing has
matched up to her high expectations.
Karen Fricker, a junior taking the
Poetry and Poetics course, called the
lectures "stimulating and provocative."
"I could go on (listening) for
hours," she says.
"She (Rich) has a charisma that will
make the reading of poetry more
available to undergraduates and
graduates as well," Barbara Gelpi says.
Rich's appointment is part of a pro
gram to build up the humanities at
Stanford, Middlebrook says. She says
she hopes that Rich's presence will
help make Stanford an international
focus for the study of feminist theory
and women's issues.
Rich's teaching and presence on the
Farm "shows Stanford's growing luster
in the humanities," says Albert Gelpi.
Middlebrook sums up the prevalent
feeling among faculty and students
saying, "I have never been so happy
about an appointment in my life."

chievous grin.
The grinning woman is acclaimed
poet and feminist Adrienne Rich, who
has joined the Stanford faculty this fall
on a pan-time appointment to the En
glish Department and the Feminist
Studies Program.
Diane Middlebrook, the director of
the Feminist Studies Program, spotted
the opportunity to invite Rich last year
and presented a proposal to Norman
Wessells, dean of Humanities and
Sciences. Wessells then contacted Al
bert Gelpi, the chairman of the English
Department, who recommended that
Rich be hired.
"There was incredibly strong sup
port for the appointment," Mid
dlebrook says.
Acquiring Rich was seen as a unique
opportunity because she is among the
top scholars in the country in both
poetry and feminist studies.

"There just isn't anybody that does
both of these things with the kind of in
ternational acclaim that she has," Gelpi
says.
Other members of the faculty agree.
Barbara Gelpi, a member of the En
glish Department and the Feminist
Studies program calls Rich "a unique
combination of a poet, a feminist
theorist, a feminist activist and an ex
cellent teacher."
She adds, "I don't know anyone who
combines these qualities so bril
liantly."
Before coming to Stanford, Rich
held a series of full and part-time
teaching positions. Her first appoint
ment was to City College of New York,
where she spent a couple of years
teaching poetry. She then left for a
one-year visiting professorship at Bran
deis University in Waltham, Mass.,
about 30 minutes from Boston.
After returning to City College for
two years, Rich left once again, this
time headed for Douglass, the
women's college at Rutgers. After three
years at Douglass, she left and did not
have any long-term appoinments until
she began teaching part-time at San
Jose State University two years ago.

Last spring, Rich became the first
recipient of the annual Ruth-Lily award,
presented to her in recognition of the
entire body of her poetry. She says she
hopes this prize will make it possible
for her to take next spring off from any
public engagements such as teaching,
readings and speeches, in order to
write.

Although Rich is an
excellent scholar,
she still loves to
teach.

This year, Rich has three books com
ing out: "Your Native Land, Your Life,"
"Blood, Bread, and Poetry" and "Of
Woman Born: Motherhood as Institu
tion and Experience."
The first, a book of poems, was pub
lished last spring.
"Blood, Bread, and Poetry" is a col
lection of essays and reviews that, as Al
bert Gelpi comments, indicate Rich's

"central position as a poet and a
feminist writer."
Finally, "Of Woman Born: Mother
hood as Institution and Experience"
will be reissued upon the 10th anniver
sary of its original publishing. The re
issue of the book, according to Albert
Gelpi, is "recognition that it has
become a classic of feminist writing
during the decade since its publish
ing,"
Although Rich is an excellent
scholar, she still loves to teach and in
teract with students.
Rich will be teaching one course in
the English Department this fall and
one in the Feminist Studies Program.
She describes her English course,
Poetry and Poetics, as "basic what-is
poetry" and "how can we talk about
poems."
She says that she wants to communi
cate to her students that "poetry is so
much more than words on a page,"
that it is "a deeply human art" and a
way of "communicating with one's
community."
Rich's second course is a seminar in
feminist studies in which she hopes to
study the theory of the women's move
ment by looking at its practice. By
doing this, Rich says, She hopes to illus
trate the ways in which feminist theory
relates directly to feminist action and
experience.
Meanwhile, Stanford faculty and
visiting scholars are currently reading
and discussing Rich's "Your Native
Land, Your Life" in the faculty seminar
on feminist theory this quarter, accord
ing to Middlebrook.
Thus far, at least one student has
found that Rich's lecturing has
matched up to her high expectations.
Karen Fricker, a junior taking the
Poetry and Poetics course, called the
lectures "stimulating and provocative."
"I could go on (listening) for
hours," she says.
"She (Rich) has a charisma that will
make the reading of poetry more
available to undergraduates and
graduates as well," Barbara Gelpi says.
Rich's appointment is part of a pro
gram to build up the humanities at
Stanford, Middlebrook says. She says
she hopes that Rich's presence will
help make Stanford an international
focus for the study of feminist theory
and women's issues.
Rich's teaching and presence on the
Farm "shows Stanford's growing luster
in the humanities," says Albert Gelpi.
Middlebrook sums up the prevalent
feeling among faculty and students
saying, "I have never been so happy
about an appointment in my life."
Entering the room, one senses an al
most regal power emanating from the
small woman sitting quietly at her
desk.
"I would go on teaching even if 1
won the lottery," she says with a mis
chievous grin.
