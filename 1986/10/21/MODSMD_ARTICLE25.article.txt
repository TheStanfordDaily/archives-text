# Machine shop hops
## 
### NICHOLAS J.R. ANDERSON 
Most students have seen the Stu
dent Machine Shop across the road
from the back of Tresidder. And
most have probably wondered at
one time or another why there are
about a dozen people working
away in the shop all hours of the
day and night.
They are not workers from
Facilities Operation and Mainte
nance, but students taking Mechani
cal Engineering 103. The class is
something of an anomaly in the En
gineering Department. Unlike most
"techie" courses in which one
grinds out a problem set a week in
preparation for a midterm and final,
ME 103 requires creativity and
originality.
In fact, "students are encouraged
to use imagination," says Professor
David Beach, the course instructor.
"Hopefully, they will captitalize on
their intelligence and creative in
stincts, not simply rely on their
powers of memorization."
The class is structured around a
single assignment. Every student
must design and build a widget
using the knowledge acquired in
class. The fun twist, says Beach, is
that the widgets are "chosen, de
signed and built by each student."
This turns out to be a pretty en
joyable 10-week assignment. Stu
dents usually decide to build some
thing that will be useful or interest
ing to them. Last winter, among
the final projects were a couple of
candy dispensers, a chess board, a
can crusher and a ski rack.
The only enforced limitation is
that of safety — a cannon was
vetoed by Beach early last winter.
The free reign given students adds
to their motivation.
"It's a lot easier and more enjoy
able to build something you want
and like," says junior Matt Howard,
a mechanical engineering major
taking the class this quarter. "That
way, you can forget about the grade
and just do a good job."
As Beach puts it, "Original ideas,
pursued to hardware, give immedi
ate feedback for intense ego in
volvement which are tremendous
sources for energy."
For example, junior Bob Bor
chers is designing and building an
aluminum bicycle frame for the
class. He chose this because he is
the captain of Stanford's cycling
team.

"I like the class because it's use
ful," says Borchers. "We learn
practical, not theoretical aspects of
design — that's unusual in Stanford
engineering."
And for Beach, who seems ex
tremely concerned about the Amer
ican work ethic, quality really is job
one.
"Playing the dual roles of en
gineer and craftsman teaches the
importance of design for manufac
turability (and) the relationship of
manufacturing methods to product
quality," he says.
This sincere motivation and con
cern for quality is reflected in the
atmosphere of the machine shop.
"Dave (as Prof. Beach is known to
members of the class) and the
graduate students who TA. the class
are friendly and helpful," says
junior Mike Cramer whose project
is a frisbee holder. "The staff has a
talent for making students who
have never used lathes and milling
machines feel comfortable and un
threatened, and that's important
since most of us haven't made any
thing like this before.
"Anyway, what other class would
let me build a frisbee holder? It's a
neat course."
Beach says of the creative
freedom: "We are willing to discuss
designing options or machine set
ups but will try to suggest a variety
of alternatives which leave the pos
sibility open that the student will
have the best idea. Ultimately, the
responsibility for design decisions
lies squarely on the stu
dent/designers."
Junior Barb Egan, a mechanical
engineering major, sums up the
feeling of the class best: "It's fun, it's
no mental strain; just take it easy,
and it's a fun time."
But as finals week nears, when
the projects are due, the pace of the
shop quickens.
The students fall "under a great
deal of pressure that comes from
overestimating personal productiv
ity and underestimating the diffi
culty of building and 'debugging'
hardware," says Beach. "This is an
intense, demanding but rewarding
experience."
The reward comes at the end of
the quarter when, instead of taking
a final examination, the class gets
together to examine each other's
projects. The machine shop is then
turned into a sort of trade show
with roughly 70 projects scattered
around for inspection.
