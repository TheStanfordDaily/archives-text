## Medicine advances new kids' hospital

The New Children's Hospital at Stanford is scheduled to
open at the end of the decade, and with its consolidated
facilities and new location immediately adjacent to the main
hospital, it is expected to be one of the foremost pediatric

medical centers in the nation, according to Diarmuid
McGuire, director of community affairs for the Children's
Hospital at Stanford.
The new hospital will be Stanford's third successive
children's health facility. Stanford has a tradition of creating
new centers for pediatric medical care to keep pace with the
latest scientific developments, McGuire said.

According to McGuire, the original Stanford Home for
Convalescent Children was located in the only wing of the
Stanford summer mansion, which survived the 1906
earthquake. It was opened in 1919, mainly as a service for
children from San Francisco with such diseases as polio,
rheumatic fever and tuberculosis. The title reflected the fact
that these diseases were incurable at the time, and the build
ing was designed mostly as a pleasant place for children
with chronic diseases to stay. However, with the discovery
of penicillin and antibiotics after World War 11, the role of
medicine in society changed, and in the '60s the expanded
building which today houses the Children's Hospital was
opened.
Just as the scientific aspect of pediatric care has
progressed, so too has the philosophy of dealing with
chronically ill children. In the '20s the predominant idea
was to seclude these children from others, including their
families. Today it is realized that contact with parents and
peers is an important part of recovery, and family members
are encouraged to stay with the patient around the clock,
McGuire said.
The New Children's Hospital is being designed so that
next to each patient there will be a bed for a parent to spend
the night in the room. Because the need to protect patients
whose immunological systems have been compromised by
their treatments prevents this approach in some cases, a
special sanitized room is being designed where parents can
play with children who are extremely susceptible to infec
tion. Also, the Ronald McDonald House, so named after a
grant from the fast-food chain McDonalds, provides a place
for families to stay at a low price.
According to McGuire, the treatment of children tends to
be more aggressive than that of adults, both because
children tend to be more resilient to such painful treat
ments as radiation and chemotherapy, and because if they

are cured they have longer lifespans ahead of them. Hospi
tals for children also differ from general hospitals because
there is a need for a greater number of staff and special
facilities such as classrooms and recreational therapy areas,
which are needed to keep the patients' development on a
par with their unhospitalized peers.
The New Children's Hospital will have direct access to the
30 surgical suites that are being constructed as part of the
expansion of the main medical center, McGuire continued.
This will eliminate the need for ambulances to transport

patients between the two locations, as is currently done.
Also, services such as the labor and delivery rooms, which
presently are housed at the main center, will be combined
with services for expectant mothers and newborn infants in
a perinatal center and will be part of the New Children's
Hospital.
The fact that major diseases of the past such as polio and
tuberculosis have been conquered gives reason for op
timism about the future at the New Children's Hospital,
McGuire said.

Over the years, the Children's Hospital at Stanford has changed its policy of isolating the patients from family and
friends to allowing parents to sleep next to their children.
