# Plastic surgeons care about more than pretty faces

An ongoing series of Progress in
Medicine lectures sponsored by the
Stanford Medical Center is helping to
teach the public that plastic surgery
consists of more than just face lifts and
nose jobs.
During the first lecture in the series,
entitled "Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgery: Beyond the Body Image, " Dr.
Lars Vistnes, head of the Division of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at
the Stanford Medical Center, stressed

the rehabilitative function of his medi
cal art.
The two final lectures in the series,
"The Future of Microsurgery" by Dr.
Joseph Rosen and"The Interplast
Story" by Dr. Donald Laub, will be held
tonight at 7:30 in the Fairchild
Auditorium of the Medical Center.
The Interplast story seems a particu
larly relevant topic to discuss at the
Stanford Medical Center, since the In
terplast organization was founded here
in the early '70s when Laub, then chief
of the Division of Plastic Surgery,

sought for a means to make much
needed plastic surgery available to
children and other residents of im
poverished nations.
At first, many Third World patients
were brought to Stanford for medical
treatment. This, however, proved to be
an inefficient use of available re
sources. It was decided that a team of
surgeons be put together to perform,
and later teach, modern surgical tech
niques. The group acquired an anti
quated DC-3 airplane and set out to
make medical history. Now, the DC-3 is

replaced by modern commercial
airlines, and Interplast is more success
ful than ever.
Other new techniques of surgery
being pioneered at Stanford include an
exciting new method to reconnect pe
ripheral nerves, which is being
developed by Rosen. He is using mini
ature implantable micro-chips to
reconnect nerves to a degree of preci
sion previously thought impossible.
Vistnes commented that techniques
for reconstructive blind orbit surgery,
hand surgery and much rehabilitative

research have been greatly advanced at
Stanford.
Vistnes stressed that his division
does much more than research,
however.
"We provide both primary care and
secondary coasulting for the commu
nity as well as for people from all over
the world," Vistnes said.
The center also provides a "top pro
gram for teaching of plastic surgery,"
continued Vistnes. Every year, three
graduating medical students are selec
ted from a pool of over 60 applicants

for a six-year training period in plastic
surgery. This has resulted in the train
ing of almost 70 surgeons in the past
18 years.
So, next time you think of the Stan
ford Medical Center Division of Plastic
and Reconstructive Surgery, remem
ber that it's far more than just a high
tech beauty parlor. Its staff is respon
sible for primary and secondary care of
local residents and patients from
foreign countries, training new sur
geons and even organizing teams of
surgeons to aid Third World countries.
