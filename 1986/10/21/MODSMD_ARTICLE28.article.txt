## Card back in top 20; Trojans unranked 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It will he a different scenario Saturday when
USC visits Stanford Stadium in a pivotal Pacific 10
Conference showdown. The second-place Card
inal, ranked No. 18 in this week's Associated Press
poll, has a 2-1 Pac-10 record, 5-1 overall. The
seventh-place Trojans, unranked this week, have a
2-2 Pac-10 record, 4-2 overall.
Faas tuning in on CBS, which is carrying the
game to 80 percent of the nation, will get a
chance to see a Stanford team favored by one
point and with a good chance of beating the
Trojans for the first time since 1975, and the first
time at home since 1970.
"Obviously, it's something good for our whole
program," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said. "I
think we're experienced enough now where it's
just extra incentive. We recruit nationally, so
being on national television is a big plus as far as
recruiting's concerned. It gives us exposure all
over the country."
For the first time in many years, this game is cri
tical for both teams' Rose Bowl hopes. The
Trojans have lost two straight conference games
to Washington State and Arizona State, and a third
loss would eliminate any hope of a league title.
Stanford trails only Arizona State but lost to Wash
ington, which would therefore go to Pasadena
should the teams tie. A second loss would be a
serious blow to the Cardinal's chances.
"I'm taking the same approach (UCLA Coach)
Terry Donahue's taking," Elway said. "This
league's so tough, so balanced, that you can go to
the Rose Bowl with two losses."
But not three. "They've lost two in a row, and
they're red," nose guard Eric Volta said of the
Trojans. "They don't want to lose three in a row."
Stanford is coming off its best outing of the
year, a 41-7 thrashing at Oregon. "That was a
really fun game to watch — the guys who haven't

played a lot got a chance," Volta said. "Being able
to watch all three phases click together like a ma
chine — that was fun."
Pan of the fun came on the offensive side of the
line, where enough large holes were opened to
enable running back Brad Muster to break into
the Oregon secondary on a regular basis and
come away with a 151-yard afternoon that earned
him Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week honors.
Muster rushed for two touchdowns, had a 42-yard
run — the longest of his career — and caught
three passes, including a 31-yard touchdown.
Muster also moved into die No. 2 spot on the
Stanford all-time rushing list with 1,822 yards on
431 carries.
The Oregon game also saw the John Paye to Jeff
James passing combination hitting on all
cylinders again. Paye completed 14-of-20 passes
for 191 yards and two touchdowns, with James
catching eight of those for 130 yards and a touch
down. The Ducks' All-Pac-10 passer, Chris Miller,
was 25-of-40 for 242 yards and two interceptions.
"1 think John Paye has played outstanding in his
last three football games," Elway said. "The thing
is that John goes in to win football games. He
doesn't have a problem with a game plan that
doesn't have as much throwing as a quarterback
would like. There's no doubt in my mind who the
better quarterback was out there.
"They wanted to play a lot of man coverage,
and last year they had success. That's why Jeff
James means so much. On that touchdown, every
one wanted to know why he was so open. The
reason was he screwed that guy into the
Astroturf."

Stanford was one of five Pac-10 teams ranked in the

chance to see a Stanford team favored by one
point and with a good chance of beating the
Trojans for the first time since 1975, and the first
time at home since 1970.
"Obviously, it's something good for our whole
program," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said. "I
think we're experienced enough now where it's
just extra incentive. We recruit nationally, so
being on national television is a big plus as far as
recruiting's concerned. It gives us exposure all
over the country."
For the first time in many years, this game is cri
tical for both teams' Rose Bowl hopes. The
Trojans have lost two straight conference games
to Washington State and Arizona State, and a third
loss would eliminate any hope of a league title.
Stanford trails only Arizona State but lost to Wash
ington, which would therefore go to Pasadena
should the teams tie. A second loss would be a
serious blow to the Cardinal's chances.
"I'm taking the same approach (UCLA Coach)
Terry Donahue's taking," Elway said. "This
league's so tough, so balanced, that you can go to
the Rose Bowl with two losses."
But not three. "They've lost two in a row, and
they're red," nose guard Eric Volta said of the
Trojans. "They don't want to lose three in a row."
Stanford is coming off its best outing of the
year, a 41-7 thrashing at Oregon. "That was a
really fun game to watch — the guys who haven't

played a lot got a chance," Volta said. "Being able
to watch all three phases click together like a ma
chine — that was fun."
Pan of the fun came on the offensive side of the
line, where enough large holes were opened to
enable running back Brad Muster to break into
the Oregon secondary on a regular basis and
come away with a 151-yard afternoon that earned
him Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week honors.
Muster rushed for two touchdowns, had a 42-yard
run — the longest of his career — and caught
three passes, including a 31-yard touchdown.
Muster also moved into die No. 2 spot on the
Stanford all-time rushing list with 1,822 yards on
431 carries.
The Oregon game also saw the John Paye to Jeff
James passing combination hitting on all
cylinders again. Paye completed 14-of-20 passes
for 191 yards and two touchdowns, with James
catching eight of those for 130 yards and a touch
down. The Ducks' All-Pac-10 passer, Chris Miller,
was 25-of-40 for 242 yards and two interceptions.
"1 think John Paye has played outstanding in his
last three football games," Elway said. "The thing
is that John goes in to win football games. He
doesn't have a problem with a game plan that
doesn't have as much throwing as a quarterback
would like. There's no doubt in my mind who the
better quarterback was out there.
"They wanted to play a lot of man coverage,
and last year they had success. That's why Jeff
James means so much. On that touchdown, every
one wanted to know why he was so open. The
reason was he screwed that guy into the
Astroturf."
Card notes
Stanford was one of five Pac-10 teams ranked in the
AP Top 20. Washington was No. 8, Arizona State No. 9,
Arizona No. 15 and UCLA No. 17. The Cardinal was
ranked No. 17 by United Press International, tied with
UQA, No. 18 in the USA Today/CNN poll and No. 20 by
ESPN.


Although Oregon quarterback Chris Miller threw for 242 yards
against Stanford in a losing effort, it was backup Pete Nelson who

defenders Rick Theder (41) and Alan Grant (2).
