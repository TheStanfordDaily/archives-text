# Sailors win third in a row
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
Recording its third victory in as many regattas, the
Stanford sailing team won the Stoneybrook Regatta at
Berkeley this past weekend, defeating opponents gath
ered from across the West Coast.
Combined with previous wins at the Northern Califor
nia and Pacific Coast Sloop Eliminations, this latest vic
tory could help the Cardinal sailors toward regional
domination and a high national ranking this season.
The sailing team will field competitors in five divisions
this year, according to first-year Stanford Coach Blake

Middleton. Team members have already scored victories
in sloop, dinghy and singlehanded events, while the
women's and team racing squads have yet to compete.
In the Northern California Sloop Eliminations, hosted
by UC-Santa Cruz, Stanford's team of sophomore skipper
Bill Shoemaker, junior Dan Buckstaff and sophomore
Brad Swett tied the California team for first place, ad
vancing to the Pacific Coast Sloop Championships.
At that regatta, hosted by UC-Irvine, Stanford trounced
the competition with a low score of 11 points.
As a result of this victory, Stanford qualified for the
North American Sloop Championships in
Detroit, to be held Oct. 31 to Nov. 2 in Flying
Scot-class sailboats.
"The Stanford team has the potential to win
it all," Middleton said of the national cham
pioaships. "They may not be the favorites, but
other coaches recognize the depth of talent
on our team."
The Cardinal sailors' chances were greatly
improved, according to Middleton, when a
Northern California couple donated their
Flying Scot sailboat to Stanford, so the team
could practice in the same type of boat it will
sail in Detroit.
In dinghy competition, two-person teams
compete in smaller boats, racing in the same
format as the sloop team. At Berkeley this past
weekend, the dinghy teams began their
season with several strong performances
against a fleet representing schools from
throughout California.
In the B-division, Bill Shoemaker contin
ued to leave steam rising behind his boat, as
he and crew Lori Dobeus won the the first six
races on their way to a victory in their divi
sion.
Dan Buckstaff and Kathleen Mallery, sailing
the same boat in the A-division, were continu
ally plagued by problems with their equip
ment; difficulties that marred what would
otherwise have been a dominating perfor
mance.
As Buckstaff noted after the first half of
racing, "The boat is flying along. If we can just
keep it from breaking apart, we can win this
series."

Middleton agreed, stressing the importance
of winning against such a large fleet of com
petitors. "Twenty-seven boats is a big number
for a college regatta. I was very impressed that
the team was as consistently strong as it was in
such a large fleet."

The Stanford sailing
team has the potential
to win it all.'

Middleton

While the dinghy teams impressed their
coach, the singlehanded team, made up of in
dividual sailors competing in a format like
that of the dinghy sailors, was also successful.
The Berkeley regatta was the first step in qual
ifying for the North American Singlehanded
Championships, and all three competing Stan
ford sailors performed well enough to
qualify.
Brad Swett and freshman Al Sargeant
finished in the top three at Berkeley and will
go on to the Pacific Coast Singlehanded
Championships this weekend in San Diego.
Stanford's third entrant, junior Drew Gashler,
sacrificed his own qualification in order to
substitute on the dinghy team when
Shoemaker was unable to sail the first races
on Sunday morning.
"It was an easy choice, because even

though I wanted to qualify' for the nationals,
I'm always willing to put the success of the
team first," Gashler said.
Yet to compete are the women's and team
racing squads. Their national qualifiers are
held in the spring, so both teams are in off
season training.
The women's team competes in the same
type of event as the dinghy team, except that
all sailors must he female. Buffy Wendt, who
scored a top-10 performance in the A-division
at Berkeley this past weekend, noted that
sailing with the dinghy fleet all year has been
a help.
"It really gets you prepared for the
women's qualifiers in the springtime. Given
that we did very well at last year's qualifiers
(when the underdog Cardinal women won
the Pacific Championship) we ought to be
able to do big tilings this spring," Wendt said.
"Our women's team could be the best in
the nation this year," Middleton said.
The team racing squad, comprised of three
two-person dinghy teams, races against other
schools on a one-on-one basis. Last year, the
Stanford team finished a strong third at the
national championships. As the team now has
four members with national experience, it
could, according to Middleton, "be the
strongest of our strong teams."
All in all, the coach and members of the
Stanford sailing team believe that the squad
has the talent and the depth to be among the
nation's best this year. "The team is very
young this year," Middleton said, "but it has a
surprising depth considering we have mostly
sophomores and juniors."
As women's captain Kristen Boyles said at
Berkeley, "We're headed for the top. We may
not make it this year, but that's where we're
headed."

the Pacific Championship) we ought to be
able to do big tilings this spring," Wendt said.
"Our women's team could be the best in
the nation this year," Middleton said.
The team racing squad, comprised of three
two-person dinghy teams, races against other
schools on a one-on-one basis. Last year, the
Stanford team finished a strong third at the
national championships. As the team now has
four members with national experience, it
could, according to Middleton, "be the
strongest of our strong teams."
All in all, the coach and members of the
Stanford sailing team believe that the squad
has the talent and the depth to be among the
nation's best this year. "The team is very
young this year," Middleton said, "but it has a
surprising depth considering we have mostly
sophomores and juniors."
As women's captain Kristen Boyles said at
Berkeley, "We're headed for the top. We may
not make it this year, but that's where we're
headed."

The fall season has been treating the Stanford sailing team well. The Cardinal has won its last
three regattas in a row, most recently last weekend at Berkeley. Stanford will soon begin na
tional competition and should have a high ranking.
Recording its third victory in as many regattas, the
Stanford sailing team won the Stoneybrook Regatta at
Berkeley this past weekend, defeating opponents gath
ered from across the West Coast.
Combined with previous wins at the Northern Califor
nia and Pacific Coast Sloop Eliminations, this latest vic
tory could help the Cardinal sailors toward regional
domination and a high national ranking this season.
The sailing team will field competitors in five divisions
this year, according to first-year Stanford Coach Blake

Middleton. Team members have already scored victories
in sloop, dinghy and singlehanded events, while the
women's and team racing squads have yet to compete.
In the Northern California Sloop Eliminations, hosted
by UC-Santa Cruz, Stanford's team of sophomore skipper
Bill Shoemaker, junior Dan Buckstaff and sophomore
Brad Swett tied the California team for first place, ad
vancing to the Pacific Coast Sloop Championships.
At that regatta, hosted by UC-Irvine, Stanford trounced
the competition with a low score of 11 points.
As a result of this victory, Stanford qualified for the
North American Sloop Championships in
Detroit, to be held Oct. 31 to Nov. 2 in Flying
Scot-class sailboats.
"The Stanford team has the potential to win
it all," Middleton said of the national cham
pioaships. "They may not be the favorites, but
other coaches recognize the depth of talent
on our team."
The Cardinal sailors' chances were greatly
improved, according to Middleton, when a
Northern California couple donated their
Flying Scot sailboat to Stanford, so the team
could practice in the same type of boat it will
sail in Detroit.
In dinghy competition, two-person teams
compete in smaller boats, racing in the same
format as the sloop team. At Berkeley this past
weekend, the dinghy teams began their
season with several strong performances
against a fleet representing schools from
throughout California.
In the B-division, Bill Shoemaker contin
ued to leave steam rising behind his boat, as
he and crew Lori Dobeus won the the first six
races on their way to a victory in their divi
sion.
Dan Buckstaff and Kathleen Mallery, sailing
the same boat in the A-division, were continu
ally plagued by problems with their equip
ment; difficulties that marred what would
otherwise have been a dominating perfor
mance.
As Buckstaff noted after the first half of
racing, "The boat is flying along. If we can just
keep it from breaking apart, we can win this
series."

Middleton agreed, stressing the importance
of winning against such a large fleet of com
petitors. "Twenty-seven boats is a big number
for a college regatta. I was very impressed that
the team was as consistently strong as it was in
such a large fleet."

While the dinghy teams impressed their
coach, the singlehanded team, made up of in
dividual sailors competing in a format like
that of the dinghy sailors, was also successful.
The Berkeley regatta was the first step in qual
ifying for the North American Singlehanded
Championships, and all three competing Stan
ford sailors performed well enough to
qualify.
Brad Swett and freshman Al Sargeant
finished in the top three at Berkeley and will
go on to the Pacific Coast Singlehanded
Championships this weekend in San Diego.
Stanford's third entrant, junior Drew Gashler,
sacrificed his own qualification in order to
substitute on the dinghy team when
Shoemaker was unable to sail the first races
on Sunday morning.
"It was an easy choice, because even

though I wanted to qualify' for the nationals,
I'm always willing to put the success of the
team first," Gashler said.
Yet to compete are the women's and team
racing squads. Their national qualifiers are
held in the spring, so both teams are in off
season training.
The women's team competes in the same
type of event as the dinghy team, except that
all sailors must he female. Buffy Wendt, who
scored a top-10 performance in the A-division
at Berkeley this past weekend, noted that
sailing with the dinghy fleet all year has been
a help.
"It really gets you prepared for the
women's qualifiers in the springtime. Given
that we did very well at last year's qualifiers
(when the underdog Cardinal women won
the Pacific Championship) we ought to be
able to do big tilings this spring," Wendt said.
"Our women's team could be the best in
