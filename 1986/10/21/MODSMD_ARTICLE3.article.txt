### DIANE BISGEIER Staff writer 
Six Stanford students and two recent graduates were ar
rested yesterday in a demonstration called "Lockdown
Lockheed," an attempt to disrupt the Sunnyvale plant of
Lockheed Inc., a major government defense contractor.
The Sunnyvale demonstration was part of a national day
of protest that included actions in Atlanta, Washington, D.C.,
and Cleveland. Nationally, police arrested 93 people.
A total of 50 people were arrested in die local demonstra
tion, which attempted to block traffic coming into the
facility. The demonstration was coordinated through the po
litical coalition No Business As Usual (NBAU) in protest of
Lockheed's "490 million dollars in Star Wars research and
development contracts, and an assembly line for Trident II
first strike missiles," protesters said.
Seniors Gailen Hilgard and Mario Huerta and graduate
student Scott Bohning were among those taken to Santa
Clara County Jail along with Caroline Paul and Jennifer G.
Grant, two recent graduates, for obstructing traffic, a mis
demeanor.
According to senior Joel Bellenson, a member of the
NBAU group "Uprising," between 30 and 50 Stanford stu
dents and alumni were present, out of a total of 200 to 300

protesters. "We're trying to arouse consciousness. We do
not see methods such as writing to congressmen as means
for real change," said Bellenson, who attended the demon
stration.
Bellenson cited Lockheed's involvement with the Strate
gic Defense Initiative (SDI), commonly referred to as "Star
Wars," as being a major threat to the start of another world
war. "There is an underlying compulsion in the super
powers to start World War III," said Bellenson. The demon
stration "is an essential step for those who want to stop
World War III," he added.
The students were set free without bail around 7 p.m.
Graduate student Rick Motamedi, who also was present at
the rally, said, "It seemed like the police were arresting
people at random. Anyone who was wearing a mask or a
sign seemed more susceptible."
NBAU had encouraged participants to dress as "mutants,
radioactivists and living dead." According to Motamedi,
many were arrested walking to their cars. "You didn't have
to be blocking traffic" to be arrested, he said.
After the Sunnyvale protest, demonstrators marched at
Palo Alto High School. Then, protesters heard Edward

Hasbrouck, one of the first public draft resisters, speak
against Lockheed s involvement with SDI and its facility on
Stanford land.
Motamedi said: "There's a lot of Star Wars research at
Stanford. It would be nice to see the University take a more
active role in severing ties with government research and to
see students be more active."
With advance warning, Sunnyvale police arrived at 1111
N. Matilda Ave. at 6:55 a.m. in response to the protest, which
lasted from 7 a.m. until approximately 8:30 p.m. All but one
arrest was for obstruction of traffic at the Lockheed en
trance.
"My biggest reaction (to the protest) was the absence of
interest," said senior Stuart Hirschfeld, who witnessed the
demonstration from a nearby booth for El Salvador aid.
"There was no crowd. Fart of the problem was many of the
demonstrators were dressed in marginal, counter
establishment fashion." Hirschfeld said many wore white
skull masks.
Many participants were not directly involved with NBAU
or its subgroups, such as "Uprising," church organizations
and the Revolutionary Communist Party. "I went to educate
myself on how our government and our system work," said
senior Renee Blake.
This year's turnout of 30 to 50 students is a marked in
crease from last year's turnout of one Stanford student at
Lockheed.

The demonstrators blocked the entrance to the building as workers began to arrive. The first arrest occurred at the
main gate as police placed restraints on a woman protester.
