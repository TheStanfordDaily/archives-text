In one of its lowest finishes in recent
years, the Stanford men's golf team
finished 16th among 20 teams at the
Stanford Men's Invitational played this
weekend at the Stanford Golf Course.
The Cardinal got off to a disastrous

start in the tournament, ending the first
18 holes in last place. Stanford was
able to bounce back somewhat over
the final 36 holes, passing Pepperdine,
Missouri, New Mexico and Oregon
State.
Fresno State won the tournament
with a 1,097 team total. Arizona edged
Arizona State for second, 1,113 to

1,116. San Jose State was fourth at
1,124.
Stanford was not the only team to
perform below its usual standards, as
traditional national power USC
finished 15th at 1,156, two strokes
ahead of the Cardinal.
