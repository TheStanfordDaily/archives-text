### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
In one of its lowest finishes in recent
years, the Stanford men's golf team
finished 16th among 20 teams at the
Stanford Men's Invitational played this
weekend at the Stanford Golf Course.
The Cardinal got off to a disastrous

start in the tournament, ending the first
18 holes in last place. Stanford was
able to bounce back somewhat over
the final 36 holes, passing Pepperdine,
Missouri, New Mexico and Oregon
State.
Fresno State won the tournament
with a 1,097 team total. Arizona edged
Arizona State for second, 1,113 to

1,116. San Jose State was fourth at
1,124.
Stanford was not the only team to
perform below its usual standards, as
traditional national power USC
finished 15th at 1,156, two strokes
ahead of the Cardinal.
The lineup that Stanford Coach Tim
Schaaf fielded this weekend was vastly
different from the one that played in
six Cardinal golfers that played this
weekend, only Brad Geer teed it up at
the NCAAs. Missing from last season's
squad were Pacific 10 Conference
champion Don Walsworth, All Pac-10
selection Carl Wagner, Phil Rowley and
Roger Miraglia.
Geer led the Cardinal wirh a 22^

total, good for an llth-place finish in
the individual competition. John
Dickey also turned in a solid perfor
mance, shooting 225.
Cole Thompson and Rich Marik
were next for Stanford at 237. Steve
White was the Cardinal's No. 5 finisher
at 241, with John Mahon a stroke back
at 242.
Bill Mayfair of Arizona State was the
individual champion. Mayfair's victory
was a convincing one, as he beat
Fresno State's David Sutherland by five
shots (207 to 212). Drew Hartt of San
Jose State finished third at 213, and
John Hayes of Texas-El Paso was fourth
at 217.
