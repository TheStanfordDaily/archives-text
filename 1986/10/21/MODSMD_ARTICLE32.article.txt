# Denver falls 22-10

### 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. â€” Ken
O'Brien threw a 23-yard touchdown
pass to Wesley Walker, and an un
yielding New York defense shut
down Denver's high-scoring of
fense as the Jets defeated the previ
ously unbeaten Broncos 22-10 in an
NFL game last night.
O'Brien, who missed New York's
last game against New England with
a knee injury, came on late in the
second period after Pat Ryan was
sacked by Denver's Karl Mecklen
burg. On his second play, O'Brien
found Walker speeding down the
right sideline behind safety Dennis
Smith for the touchdown that made
it 20-0.
By then, the Jet defense had es
tablished its dominance. Ranked
fourth in the NFL against the rush,
the Jets never allowed the Broncos
to get moving.
They pressured quarterback John
Elway, sacking him five times,
allowed only 34 yards on the
ground and controlled Denver's
passing attack, even though the Jets
ranked next-to-last in pass defense

entering the game.
Although it sputtered in the
second half, the Jets offense already
had put the game out of reach. Led
by Ryan, the Jets put together time
consuming marches of 65, 56 and
49 yards in the first half.
Pat Leahy kicked field goals of 27
and 25 yards, giving him 22 con
secutive successful kicks, one short
of the NFL record set by Washing
ton's Mark Moseley.
Johnny Hector ran one yard for a
touchdown to account for New
York's other touchdown. It was
Hector's seventh of the season,
tying him for the NFL lead with New
England receiver Stanley Morgan.
With 30 seconds remaining in the
half, Elway was sacked by corner
back Bobby Humphery in the end
zone for a safety, making it 22-0.
Rich Karlis barely made a 47-yard
field goal early in the third period,
then Elway got the Broncos to the
New York 8. But he was intercepted
by a diving Kyle Clifton at the one to
end that threat, and the Jets had
little trouble the rest of the way.
