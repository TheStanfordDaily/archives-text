# Stanford-in-Paris students adjust to threats

### MARILYN WANN 
PARIS — For the 20 students in the Overseas
Studies Program here, the first few days of the
school year were far removed from the usual
Stanford experience — brittle baguettes for
breakfast instead of Fix)d Service, commuting on
the Metro instead of biking to class, speaking
French, and then, well, you don't get many terror
ists in Palo Alto.
"When I first got here I wanted to go home,"
junior Tracy Banks recalled. "I said, 'Paris sucks,
there's no toilet paper, and they evacuate my
building because of a bomb.' "
Banks and junior Joan Gilchrist, who is study
ing here through another university's program,
were both a-sked to leave Banks' room at the
Fondation des Etats-Unis, one of a complex of

dorms for foreign students.
"You would think I'd be scared, but I wasn't at
all," Banks said. "I just got my shoes, my passport
and my money, but I did forget my airline ticket."
The concierge told Banks later that the police
had noticed a car with fake license plates parked
near the building all day, and they were just
taking precautions.
"It's cool to know that they're really on their
jobs," Banks said of the false alarm, which oc
curred one week after her arrival in Paris. "I
won't tell my parents until the next time I write. 1
know they're worried about it (terrorist bom
bings), but they tell me not to think about it."
Junior John Sommerfield had a similar experi
ence his first weekend in Paris when he visited
the Centre Pompidou, a national art and culture
museum. He had gone outside to watch the

mimes that regularly perform neSf the entrance,
but when he tried to return to the exhibits, he
saw police linking arms, clearing the building. A
museum official told him they had received a
bomb threat.
Junior Sarah Tilton was taking a walk in her
new neighborhood in the 17th arrondissement
the first Monday after her arrival when she heard
a large noise up the street, which she assumed to
be a car crash.
Two blocks later, she found the streets
cordoned off and a crowd gathered around the
remnants of a car.
"The whole thing was undramatic except there
were all these people standing around looking
serioius," said Tilton, who recalled "hundreds of
police with huge guns, fire trucks and am
bulances." There was no damage to nearbv build-

"This nice, pleasant walk to the Pare Monceau
became something depressing," she said.
That evening s news broadcasts explained that
the police had once again become concerned
about a car parked all day long and had destroyed
this one themselves because it was known to
belong to Arabs.
Tilton said she had no worries that would make
her want to leave, even after this incident.
These three examples of police activity in Paris
don't seem so unusual taken in the context of
everyday life here. Purses and backpacks are
searched at the entrance to most large stores and
public places, and it is not uncommon to be
asked to show a passport or some identification
while walking in the city.
None of these precautions have
created a strong reaction among pro
gram participants, however.
"It never crossed my mind that the
program was in danger," said Director
Hans Weiler, who put aside his dual
appointments in the Political Science
and Education departments to run the
Paris campus.
There were no dropouts from the
Paris program, even after September's
series of five bombings, according to
Weiler, not even calls from concerned

parents.
The newly devised summer pro
gram in Poland, in contrast, experi
enced some dropouts after news of th&
Chernobyl accident brought specula
tion that radiation could spread to the
Krakow campus.
A total of 11 bombs were detonated
randomly in Paris by terrorists seeking
the release of jailed Lebanese guerilla
Georges Ibraham Abdallah resulting in
11 dead and more than 250 wounded.
"We have to face the fact that ter
rorism is a part of today's world,"
Weiler admitted.
Weiler argued that the only solution
for terrorism would be to "sort out the
mess of the Middle East."
