# Noise policy considered
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN 
An increase in parties on weeknights
has led to more complaints of ex
cessive campus noise this year, accord
ing to Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington.
The police have received more
noise compaints during the middle of
the week he said. In past years, accord
ing to Herrington, noise problems
were usually caused by small groups of
people. But "now there are hill-blown
parties every night," he said.
John Donald, president of the Delta
Kappa Epsilon (Deke) fraternity, said
he does not think that an increase in
parties constitutes a trend. "The first
week or so is not generally indicative
of the quarter. People are trying to kick
things off."
Stanford's noise policy is outlined in
"University Guidelines on Noise and
Neighborly Relations," a copy of which
all University student residences
receive, according to Norm Robinson,
associate dean of Residential Education
for Student Affairs.
Grant Stanley, president of the
Sigma Chi fraternity, said that he is not

familiar with the noise policy,
however. Ann Porteus, a resident fel
low in Roble Hall, said that she has a
copy of the statement in her RF folder
and must transmit it to the RA's.
The statement is designed to pro
vide guidelines rather than specific
rules, according to Robinson. It in
cludes preventive measures to reduce
noise as well as suggestions for res
ponding to inappropriate noise levels.
According to the statement, part)' or
ganizers should significantly reduce
the noise level after 11 p.m. on week
days and 1 a.m. on weekends. It also
suggests that persons bothered by
noise talk to the offenders in person or
by telephone.
Porteus said the staff at Roble makes
an effort to have hired bands cense
playing music by 1.00 a.m.
Robinson said that Residential Edu
cation does not plan to set more spe
cific or mandatory guidelines regard
ing noise at student parties. "Students
must regulate individually and col
lectively their own behavior," he said.
He added that he thinks there have
been fewer problems than in past
years and pointed to such examples as

Rinconada holding its annual
"Rincadelt" party in Frost Amphithea
ter to diminish the noise. "People are
looking for ways to make those kind of
changes," he said.
Herrington said he believes noise at
Stanford is in part caused by the resi
dential nature of the University. "Most
West Coast colleges do not have so
many dorms on campus. Many don't
have fraternity houses on campus."
Both Robinson and Herrington said
that residents should expect more
noise in a university area.
"Residents around the area do ex
pea more noise and get more noise,
but there is a limit to their patience,"
said Herrington. "Living groups have
to understand that while people are
willing to go along with a certain
amount of noise, there is a point where
it becomes unreasonable. When you
get beyond midnight, people's pa
tience starts to wear thin."
Herrington said that while he could
not think of any specific, memorably
troublesome parties, fall and mid
spring seem to be the seasons when
parties evoke the most complaints.
