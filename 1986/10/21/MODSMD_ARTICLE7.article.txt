# Animal research facility receives trustees' approval
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Staff writer 
A new $17 million research facility is the last
step in the Medical Center s effort to replace
existing animal labs with a modern con
solidated complex.
The Board of Trustees last week approved
the construction of the second phase of the Re
search Animal Facility which will complement
the first phase of the facility, known as RAF I,
completed last year.
The new phase will provide housing for half
of the approximately 45,000 animals used for
research on campus and is being timed to
coincide with the construction of the Center for

Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
"This is Just part of our ongoing efforts to
provide not only optimal research facilities but
premier care for animals as well," explained
Mike Goodkind, spokesman for the Medical
Center
RAF I replaced only 50 percent of the mar
ginal ;inimal housing at Stanford, according to
Spyros Andreopoulos, director of the Medical
Center news service. RAF II will house the
other half of the animal population, which is
about 90 percent rodents. "We're trying to con
solidate our facilities," said Andreopoulos.
The consolidation will ultimately save money
by centralizing operations, according to Dr.
Thomas Hamm, director of Laboratory Animal

Medicine. Animal research facilities are pres
ently divided between 20 sites on campus.
In addition, the construction of RAF will
bring the Medical Center to full compliance
with codes regarding the housing of animals
for research. "We're under a lot of rules and
regulations for inspection," said Hamm. "To
meet all of the regulations you've got to have
lots of air."
RAF 11 will also provide needed space for
new faculty, Hamm said.
RAF I is currently in use and is connected to
the main medical center through an under
ground tunnel. It cost about $12 million, and its
32,000 square feet contain operating rooms and
pre and post-operative rooms that "resemble

hospital rooms, with anasthesia and scrubbing
areas, said Andreopoulos. Features such as
controlled air temperatures, automatic feeding
machines and simulated lighting present in RAF
I will also lie included in the new facility.
Last spring, protests over animal research
took place on the Stanford campus But Larry
Horton, associate vice president for the Office
of Public Affairs, explained that planning for the
RAFs began in 19 7 9 and that the project is not
related to the demonstrations. "Whatever
they're doing now is part of a long range pro
gram that precedes the demonstrations," said
Horton.
RAF II will be approximately 44,000 square

feet and will be a single story, underground
facility immediately south of the Center for
Molecular and Genetic Medicine (CMGM),
which is currently under construction. Con
struction of RAF II will begin in the spring and
completion is expected in 1988, "We're plan
ning to occupy it in September," said Hamm
The animal facility was lauded by both Mor
ton and Andreopoulos as a "state-of-the-art" im
provement. Said Andreopoulos, "It's really first
class. It exceeds standards throughout the
country." According to Hamm, Phase II should
make the facility "one of the nicest and best in
the country. People come from all over the na
tion to observe and model it." Tours of the
facility are open to the public by appointment.
