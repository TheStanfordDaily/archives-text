Mozambique leader dies
KOMATIPOORT, South Africa — President Samora Machel of Mozam
bique, who led his Marxist nation through 11 crisis-ridden years of inde
pendence, was killed when his plane crashed into a rainswept South
African hillside.
Marcelino dos Santos, No. 2 man in Mozambique's ruling Frelimo party,
said in a nationwide radio address that Machel, 53, and other senior offi
cials died in the crash of the presidential plane Sunday night just across the
border in South Africa "in circumstances not yet clarified."
South Africa said all but 10 of the 39 people aboard were killed.
The first official confirmation by Machel's government came more than
12 hours after dos Santos said in his first announcement on the radio that
the president's jet had not returned on schedule from Zambia. The radio
played solemn music throughout the day.
He said last night that a 60-day period of national mourning had been
declared.
The Soviet-built plane crashed 200 yards inside South Africa's frontier
with Mozambique about 30 miles south of this border town, said the South
African foreign minister, RF. Botha.
South Africa's Bureau for Information said the Soviet pilot and nine
other people survived the crash. Among the senior officials killed was
Transport Minister Luis Alcantara Santos, it said.
Machel's death left Mozambique without a leader at a time of worsening
drought, increasing attacks by anti-Marxist rebels and growing conflict with
South Africa.
Prime Minister Mario Machungo and dos Santos, who is the secretary of
Parliament, are expected to share decisions until a successor is chosen
after the funeral, expected sometime next week.
NATO opposes U.S. bargain
GLENEAGLES, Scotland — NATO defense ministers gathered yesterday
at this golf resort to confront the Americans about a near-deal at the Reyk
javik summit that raised concern about a Europe at the mercy of superior
Soviet conventional forces.
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev almost reached
agreement on a plan to remove medium-range missiles from Europe, a
prospect that caused complaints from some NATO generals and more dis
creet grumbles from politicians worried about Western European security.
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger arrived by helicopter at this
Scottish golfing resort on the eve of the two-day meeting that will debate
the strategic ftiture of NATO following the summit at which both sides of
fered huge nuclear arms cuts.
The basic fear is that withdrawal of U.S. cruise and Pershing 2 missiles,
whose deployment provoked protests by the anti-nuclear movements,
would leave Western Europe in an inferior position to the communist War
saw Pact's larger conventional forces.
At a two-day meeting of defense ministers of the 16-nation NATO alliance
starting today, the Europeans were to raise the issue with Weinberger.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, perhaps the most worried of
the Europeans, was in the United States and expected to spell out his con
cerns to President Reagan.
Court rules for power plant
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court rejected an appeal yesterday
aimed at shutting down, at least temporarily, the Diablo Canyon nuclear
power plant due to the possible threat of earthquakes.
The court, without cornmenr, let stand a Nuclear Regulatory Commission
decision dismissing the earthquake threat.
Diablo Canyon, operated by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. on the coast mid
way between San Francisco and Los Angeles, is located three miles from an
offshore earthquake fault.
"PG&E welcomes the decision," spokesman Ron Weinberg said yester
day."It reaffirms what PG&E has said — that the Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission properly issued the license for Diablo Canyon."
Diablo has put together a comprehensive emergency plan that is consid
ered one of the best in the business, Weinberg said.
"We thoroughly drill every year, and we've gotten very high marks,"
Weinberg said. "Every agency that's ever seen our emergency plan in ac
tion has said it's probably one of the best in the business.
"We believe that Diablo Canyon is one of the most carefully studied
plants in the world, and everyone who has come away (from the plant) has
said it could withstand anything that geology could throw at it,"he said.
One of its reactors began operating at full power in May 1985 and the
other last March.
Plane crash investigated
WASHINGTON — An investigation into the crash of a small plane in Cali
fornia led to sharp exchanges between two federal agencies yesterday over
whether investigators were getting prompt access to air traffic controllers
involved in the mishap.
The National Transportation Safety Board had wanted to interview the
controllers involved in last Thursday's crash near Pasadena on Friday but
were prevented from doing so by the Federal Aviation Adminstration,
NTSB officials said.
The controllers have been subpoenaed and will appear before inves
tigators Tuesday, according to NTSB spokesman Ira Furman.
Sources close to the investigation said it appears that controllers at the
Burbank tower directed the Cessna 172 aircraft into a mountainside near
Pasadena.
Circumstances surrounding the controller error have not been pinned
down, but apparently involved a miscue when the aircraft was handed over
from one controller to another controller in the Burbank tower.
Both occupants of the plane, one a veteran flying instructor and another
a pilot undergoing instrument flight tests, were killed in the crash that oc
curred in mountainous terrain near the Mount Wilson Observatory in
Pasadena.
Lockheed strike possible today
SUNNYVALE — The 6,000-member machinists union at Lockheed
Missiles & Space Co. has rejected the aerospace firm's contract offer, union
officials said yesterday.
The union, however, did not give the results of a strike authorization
vote. Company and union officials said it had failed.
The two votes, on the contract and strike authorization, were taken Sun
day by Lodge 508 of the International Association of Machinists. The vote
against the contract was "overwhelmingly against," said Bea Woodard, the
union's district spokeswoman.
No strike deadline was set, and the two sides scheduled a meeting for
today in an effort to avoid a walkout, she said.
Woodard had said a strike could take place as early as today, since the
union served Lockheed with a required five-day strike notice last week. But
she said the letter was withdrawn yesterday after management requested a
new meeting.
The union refused to say whether Sunday's strike vote was at least two
thirds in favor of a walkout, the minimum necessary. But a high union
source in Los Angeles said the vote had fallen short of two-thirds.
Lockheed spokesmen George Mulhern and Bob Burgess said they un
derstood that the Sunnyvale local had failed to get the minimum.
If reports of the failure of the strike vote were correct, it apparently left
the union with a single option, to invite management back to the bargain
ing table to try and agree on a pact.
Machinists union employees at Lockheed, including welders, as
semblers, machine and equipment operators, carpenters and clerical
workers, have been without a contract since Oct 1
The rejected three-year contract proposal offered cash bonuses instead
of pay raises and cut health insurance benefits while improving life insur
ance and pension plans.

Both occupants of the plane, one a veteran flying instructor and another
a pilot undergoing instrument flight tests, were killed in the crash that oc
curred in mountainous terrain near the Mount Wilson Observatory in
Pasadena.
Lockheed strike possible today
SUNNYVALE — The 6,000-member machinists union at Lockheed
Missiles & Space Co. has rejected the aerospace firm's contract offer, union
officials said yesterday.
The union, however, did not give the results of a strike authorization
vote. Company and union officials said it had failed.
The two votes, on the contract and strike authorization, were taken Sun
day by Lodge 508 of the International Association of Machinists. The vote
against the contract was "overwhelmingly against," said Bea Woodard, the
union's district spokeswoman.
No strike deadline was set, and the two sides scheduled a meeting for
today in an effort to avoid a walkout, she said.
Woodard had said a strike could take place as early as today, since the
union served Lockheed with a required five-day strike notice last week. But
she said the letter was withdrawn yesterday after management requested a
new meeting.
The union refused to say whether Sunday's strike vote was at least two
thirds in favor of a walkout, the minimum necessary. But a high union
source in Los Angeles said the vote had fallen short of two-thirds.
Lockheed spokesmen George Mulhern and Bob Burgess said they un
derstood that the Sunnyvale local had failed to get the minimum.
If reports of the failure of the strike vote were correct, it apparently left
the union with a single option, to invite management back to the bargain
ing table to try and agree on a pact.
Machinists union employees at Lockheed, including welders, as
semblers, machine and equipment operators, carpenters and clerical
workers, have been without a contract since Oct 1
The rejected three-year contract proposal offered cash bonuses instead
of pay raises and cut health insurance benefits while improving life insur
ance and pension plans.

Mozambique leader dies
KOMATIPOORT, South Africa — President Samora Machel of Mozam
bique, who led his Marxist nation through 11 crisis-ridden years of inde
pendence, was killed when his plane crashed into a rainswept South
African hillside.
Marcelino dos Santos, No. 2 man in Mozambique's ruling Frelimo party,
said in a nationwide radio address that Machel, 53, and other senior offi
cials died in the crash of the presidential plane Sunday night just across the
border in South Africa "in circumstances not yet clarified."
South Africa said all but 10 of the 39 people aboard were killed.
The first official confirmation by Machel's government came more than
12 hours after dos Santos said in his first announcement on the radio that
the president's jet had not returned on schedule from Zambia. The radio
played solemn music throughout the day.
He said last night that a 60-day period of national mourning had been
declared.
The Soviet-built plane crashed 200 yards inside South Africa's frontier
with Mozambique about 30 miles south of this border town, said the South
African foreign minister, RF. Botha.
South Africa's Bureau for Information said the Soviet pilot and nine
other people survived the crash. Among the senior officials killed was
Transport Minister Luis Alcantara Santos, it said.
Machel's death left Mozambique without a leader at a time of worsening
drought, increasing attacks by anti-Marxist rebels and growing conflict with
South Africa.
Prime Minister Mario Machungo and dos Santos, who is the secretary of
Parliament, are expected to share decisions until a successor is chosen
after the funeral, expected sometime next week.
NATO opposes U.S. bargain
GLENEAGLES, Scotland — NATO defense ministers gathered yesterday
at this golf resort to confront the Americans about a near-deal at the Reyk
javik summit that raised concern about a Europe at the mercy of superior
Soviet conventional forces.
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev almost reached
agreement on a plan to remove medium-range missiles from Europe, a
prospect that caused complaints from some NATO generals and more dis
creet grumbles from politicians worried about Western European security.
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger arrived by helicopter at this
Scottish golfing resort on the eve of the two-day meeting that will debate
the strategic ftiture of NATO following the summit at which both sides of
fered huge nuclear arms cuts.
The basic fear is that withdrawal of U.S. cruise and Pershing 2 missiles,
whose deployment provoked protests by the anti-nuclear movements,
would leave Western Europe in an inferior position to the communist War
saw Pact's larger conventional forces.
At a two-day meeting of defense ministers of the 16-nation NATO alliance
starting today, the Europeans were to raise the issue with Weinberger.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, perhaps the most worried of
the Europeans, was in the United States and expected to spell out his con
cerns to President Reagan.
Court rules for power plant
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court rejected an appeal yesterday
aimed at shutting down, at least temporarily, the Diablo Canyon nuclear
power plant due to the possible threat of earthquakes.
The court, without cornmenr, let stand a Nuclear Regulatory Commission
decision dismissing the earthquake threat.
Diablo Canyon, operated by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. on the coast mid
way between San Francisco and Los Angeles, is located three miles from an
offshore earthquake fault.
"PG&E welcomes the decision," spokesman Ron Weinberg said yester
day."It reaffirms what PG&E has said — that the Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission properly issued the license for Diablo Canyon."
Diablo has put together a comprehensive emergency plan that is consid
ered one of the best in the business, Weinberg said.
"We thoroughly drill every year, and we've gotten very high marks,"
Weinberg said. "Every agency that's ever seen our emergency plan in ac
tion has said it's probably one of the best in the business.
"We believe that Diablo Canyon is one of the most carefully studied
plants in the world, and everyone who has come away (from the plant) has
said it could withstand anything that geology could throw at it,"he said.
One of its reactors began operating at full power in May 1985 and the
other last March.
Plane crash investigated
WASHINGTON — An investigation into the crash of a small plane in Cali
fornia led to sharp exchanges between two federal agencies yesterday over
whether investigators were getting prompt access to air traffic controllers
involved in the mishap.
The National Transportation Safety Board had wanted to interview the
controllers involved in last Thursday's crash near Pasadena on Friday but
were prevented from doing so by the Federal Aviation Adminstration,
NTSB officials said.
The controllers have been subpoenaed and will appear before inves
tigators Tuesday, according to NTSB spokesman Ira Furman.
Sources close to the investigation said it appears that controllers at the
Burbank tower directed the Cessna 172 aircraft into a mountainside near
Pasadena.
Circumstances surrounding the controller error have not been pinned
down, but apparently involved a miscue when the aircraft was handed over
from one controller to another controller in the Burbank tower.
Both occupants of the plane, one a veteran flying instructor and another
a pilot undergoing instrument flight tests, were killed in the crash that oc
curred in mountainous terrain near the Mount Wilson Observatory in
