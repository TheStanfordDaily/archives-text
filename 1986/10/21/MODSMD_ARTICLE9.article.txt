MANAGUA, Nicaragua â€” The leftist Sandinista gov
ernment formally charged Eugene Hasenfus at a
hearing before a tribunal yesterday with terrorism
and violating public order.
If convicted, the 45-year-old American faces up to
30 years in prison.
He was captured Oct. 6 by government troops after
surviving the shooting down of a plane ferrying
supplies to U.S.-backed contra rebels.
The written charges against Hasenfus were pre
sented by Justice Minister Rodrigo Reyes in a small
courtroom packed with journalists.
Reyes said the charges were "violating the public
order and security, criminal association and ter
rorism." The justice minister said government docu
ments turned over to the court included Hasenfus'
confession.
The court's president, Reynaldo Monterrey, then

read the accusations out loud and they were
translated to English by an interpreter.
Although the government's Voice of Nicaragua
radio reported that Hasenfus had arrived, reporters
at the scene saw only a green government truck,
believed to be carrying Hasenfus, pull up to the
courthouse. It drove away, however, without unload
ing anyone.
It was unclear whether he actually appeared in the
courtroom.
Hasenfus' wife, Sally, arrived at the court moments
before the session began, accompanied by U.S. Con
sul Donald Tyson.
Hasenfus' Nicaraguan lawyer, Enrique Sotelo Bor
gen, also attended the session.
The lawyer criticized the government for making it
impossible to see Hasenfus before the trial started.
Hasenfus' wife and his brother, William, arrived in

Managua Sunday night and were met by U.S. Embassy
officials
The People's Tribunal is a judicial body created in
1983 to prosecute people accused of counter
revolutionary activity. Each panel consists of a lawyer
and two lay people.
In Washington, State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said the tribunals were set up for
the purpose of circumventing due process in order
to persecute political opponents.
Redman also said the only visit io Hasenfus by a
U.S. consular officer took place on Oct. 10.
"We don't consider that visit to have been a proper
one," Redman said. "We've demanded that the
Nicaraguan government accede to our repeated re
quests for a consular visit consistent with its treaty
obligations."
