# NATO: Arms cuts must balance
## 
### 
GLEN EAGLES, Scotland â€” European
defense officials served notice yester
day that they would balk at substantial
reductions in nuclear armaments, in
cluding the U.S. intermediate-range
weapons deployed in Europe, unless
such cuts are accompanied by agree
ments balancing Western and Soviet
bloc conventional forces.
Meeting for the first time since the
superpower summit in Iceland, which
foundered on the Soviet Union's insis
tence that cuts in offensive weapons be
linked to limits on the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative, members of NATO
demonstrated "extremely solid and
unbroken support" for President
Reagan's refusal to accept the Soviet
proposal, according to British Defense
Minister George Younger.
But, Younger said, "we would be ex
tremely concerned at a final agreement
to abolish ballistic missiles if there was

not an appropriate, effective reduction
in conventional and chemical weap
ons, and so on."
His statements, made to reporters
after the first day of a two-day meeting
of the defense ministers of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization nations,
echoed points that other officials said
he made in the private conference.
At their summit in Reykjavik,
Iceland, President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev discussed a
50 percent cut in ballistic missiles, the
elimination of intermediate-range
weapons from Western Europe and the
European part of the Soviet Union and
a reduction of such missiles elsewhere
to 100 each for both the United States
and the Soviet Union.
Younger, host to the alliance's Nu
clear Planning Group, reflected the
European concern that removal of the
so-called U.S. "nuclear umbrella"

would leave the Western European na
tions in a difficult position: forced
either to increase spending on conven
tional defenses, which they have been
reluctant to do, or to do without a
deterrent to what are considered the
superior non-nuclear forces of the So
viet Union and its allies.
A senior West German official said
Younger told the meeting that the
allies should not allow the impression
to grow that the defense of Europe was
possible without nuclear weapons.
"The transition to a world without nu
clear weapons will be protracted, diffi
cult and dangerous," he was quoted as
saying.
Younger's presentation did not ap
pear to reflect disagreement with the
United States. Indeed, Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger told
American reporters that he had "heard

no criticism whatever of the presi
dent."
Nevertheless, it amounted to a
reminder that European concerns
must be taken into account in the su
perpowers' efforts to reduce their ar
senals of long-range nuclear weapons
and the medium-range weapons they
have aimed at each other's allies in
Europe.
Seconding Younger's view, Lothar
Ruhle, the West German state secretary
for defense, is said to have voiced con
cern about the "massive military
threat" posed by the Soviet Union's
conventional forces.
Weinberger acknowledged such
concerns, telling reporters that "the
conventional balance, of course, has to
be examined and re-examined" as
changes are made in the deployment
of nuclear weapons.
