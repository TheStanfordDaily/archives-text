## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Dr. Ruth too costly 
### 
It is always disheartening when a usually productive
organization in the University blunders and makes a
costly mistake. The ASSU Speakers Bureau did just that
when it convinced the ASSU to raise its ceiling on
speaker honorariums and meet Dr. Ruth Westheimer's
price of 17,500 to appear here on Nov. 10.
Last year, the bureau performed admirably, but this
recent decision is comical. No one can deny that Dr. Ruth
is amiable and possesses an endearing smile, but so does
the actor who portrays Ronald McDonald in hamburger
commercials. Yet no one has suggested that we raise the
ceiling on speaker honorariums in order to bring him to
Stanford.
Dr. Ruth will probably be more interesting than the fa
mous fast food clown, but the price tag is simply too
high.
Attending Dr. Ruth's speech will in all likelihood be a
fun time, but she is the type of speaker who fills the back
rows of an auditorium first. Many who decide to see the
nationally known sex therapist will go primarily to laugh
at embarrassing questions and anonymously offer a few
of their own queries.
But the decision to pay the honorarium is made worse
by the Speakers Bureau's reasons for bringing Dr. Ruth
here. The bureau has stated that she will provide balance
to a ticket of speakers heavily weighted toward political
experts and writers. Balance is a wonderful thing, but

$7,500 is too much to pay for a reprieve from intellec
tualism.
According to the bureau, a survey lists Dr. Ruth as one
of the most popular speakers on college campuses
throughout the country. One marvels at the moral and
political vision of the students who answered the ques
tionaire.
It should have been the responsibility of the Speakers
Bureau to analyze Dr. Ruth's popularity and determine if
her presentation has enough educational value to merit
the exorbitant honorarium.
The bureau concluded that Dr. Ruth would educate
the Stanford community on "proper reproductive
health." But while she does make sex education ac
cesible and understandable, the ASSU undoubtedly
could have used the $7,500 more efficiently if it had ap
plied the money toward other sex education program
ming. It is unlikely that a one-shot presentation will
seriously improve problems here such as unwanted
pregnancies and transmission of sexual diseases.
Finally, the Speakers Bureau concluded that Dr. Ruth's
popularity would endear more students to the bureau,
encouraging them to donate their time to the organiza
tion. This explanation is logically bankrupt. It is more
likely that students would become involved if they
thought they could be instrumental in bringing speakers
of more heroic proportions.
