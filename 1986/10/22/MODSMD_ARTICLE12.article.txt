Stanford needs
party area
The "mental picture of men dressed
in boxer shorts and women scantily
clad" at the Phi Delt party (Daily, Oct.
15) raises some questions in my mind,
too. For example, "Why wasn't I
invited?" comes immediately to mind,
along with "Why didn't I pledge Phi
Delts?" I also have to wonder what
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano
did for fun when he was a student.
But the real question here is how to
avoid these incidents in the future,
since fraternities don't want to be
suspended and neighbors don't want
to be awakened at three in the morn
ing.
The University's solution is simple:
punish the Phi Delts severely enough
to scare all the fraternities into quiet
ing down. The problem with this is
that, all questions of fairness aside, it
won't work except in the very short
run. College students are going to
drink and have loud parties. Period.
What is needed is a way to let them do

this without bothering others, not a
futile attempt to change human na
ture. One solution would be to invite
the neighbors to the party, but unless
the Phi Delts are surrounded by stu
dents, this is unlikely to work. So
move the party! Make space available
on campus where fraternities (or
anybody) can have loud obnoxious
parties without waking university
presidents. If nothing on campus is
sufficiently sound- and beer-proofed, I
think most students would support
construction of a facility to fill this
need, perhaps with some student
activity funds. This would be a positive
solution to the problem, and the more
attractive it was (bar, sound system,
etc.), the more likely students would
be to use it.
Lastly, in view of his comments on
the Phi Delt party, I have to wonder if
Mr. Pisano is temperamentally suited
to a job that deals with student recrea
tion. Perhaps he should coasider
transferring to another part of Univer
sity administration.

Calendar exposes
the need to think
The number of initial responses to
Scott Schaeffer's challenging column
on the Women of Stanford calendar
(Daily Oct. 9) shows how necessary
indeed the column was. Not only are
the ideas presented in the article not
perceived to be self-evident truths
across this community, but they are
ridiculed.
A few people felt compelled, I
guess, to publicly defend their rights
to produce such calendars, pose for
them and put them on their walls.
Unfortunately, in asserting their rights
they didn't address the points that
were brought up by Shaeffer.
Everyone has a right to do as they
please, but we also have a right and a
responsibility to think about what we
do. One would hope that at this insti
tution, in particular, people would not
feel let "off the hook" to engage in
this intellectual process.
