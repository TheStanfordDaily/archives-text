# Calendar degrades women
## 
### 
I'm writing to address Scott Shaeffer's article (Oct. 9) re
garding the Women of Stanford calendar.
As I see it, Shaeffer's main arguments are that: 1) publica
tions of this type perpetuate stereotypes of the "ideal"
woman's physical attributes; 2) such stereotypes affect
women negatively in all aspects of their lives; and 3) images
of this kind in fact are very much like pornographic images
because they promote the degradation of women by men to
mere sexual objects. I agree with these points.

• In America there is a standard of beauty for women. A
woman, to be considered beautiful, must be thin, tall, light
skinned, and have Western-European features. Most forms
of media emulate this woman. Perhaps it is a coincidence,
but all the women portrayed in the calendar fit this
prototype perfectly.
• It is no revelation that in our culture women are obsessed
with how they look. As a gay male who has learned to be
obsessed with how I look, I can only say this: Those of you
who have not felt the need to worry almost every instant of
your lives about your weight or your appearance cannot
possibly begin to understand the intensity and power of that
self-consciousness and its effect on one's self-esteem. Scott
Shaeffer was not posing the possibility that women's concep
tion of themselves might cause them to behave in ways that
would be considered "unstable"; rather, he was alluding to
a fact substantiated by statistics of a very large number of
women — certainly at Stanford (and if you don't believe this
just ask anyone at Counseling and Psychological Services.)
Regardless, the frustration that comes from not being what
one "should'' be, if it doesn't drive one to the point of be
coming anorexic or consulting a psychologist, remains
deeply and painfully ingrained in what finally dares to
emerge as one's own definition of a "stable" self. No
wonder, then, that most women in the world feel per
petually minimized and humiliated, since a woman's sense
of self, as John Berger has written in "Ways of Seeing," is

nothing but "a sense of being appreciated as herself by an
other" (my emphasis). And this is true — notwithstanding
the fact that women may have quite different and often an
tagonistic interests depending on their class, race, ethnicity,
nationality and sexual orientation — whether women
realize it or not.
• The calendar is pornographic to the extent that it
degrades women to mere sexual objects to be exploited and
manipulated sexually. I am sure that the people who put it
together (men or women, it makes no difference) didn't
mean for it to be pornographic — but that is precisely be
cause any attempt to portray femininity in the context of our
society is inherently pornographic. We exist in a male
dominated society. Men are the administrators, owners,
business executives, trustees, presidents, in short, the rulers
and main benefactors of the status-quo. Women at all levels
are relegated to being men's servants. Thus being a woman,
in an ontological sense, means being sexually attractive and
available to men. As Catherine McKinnon has written, "What
defines a woman as such is what turns men 0n.... Gender
socialization is the process through which women come to
identify themselves as sexual beings, as beings that exist for
men." Therefore, it doesn't have much bearing whether a
woman is portrayed wearing conservative clothing, sporting
a swimsuit or being penetrated by a male.
In my opinion, the issue of the oppression of women, of
which the making of the calendar is a reflection, deserves
very serious consideration. It cannot be wished away. What
needs to be asked is who is benefitting from this oppression
and why. I happen to believe that women's oppression is an
inherent aspect of an economic structure based on classes
and the division of labor. Therefore I do not think that
raising consciousness about women's oppression — though
it is an important process — is sufficient to overcome that
oppression; nor do I believe — not even in my wildest
dreams — that men (as those who constitute the ruling
class) will ever give up their power willingly. What is
needed is a fundamental restructuring of the economy and
of social relations.

and why. I happen to believe that women's oppression is an
inherent aspect of an economic structure based on classes
and the division of labor. Therefore I do not think that
raising consciousness about women's oppression — though
it is an important process — is sufficient to overcome that
oppression; nor do I believe — not even in my wildest
dreams — that men (as those who constitute the ruling
class) will ever give up their power willingly. What is
needed is a fundamental restructuring of the economy and
of social relations.
