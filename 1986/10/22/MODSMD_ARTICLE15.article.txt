# Life and God are pretty bitchin', dude
## 
### 
Life is bitchin'. Some people say that's "life's a
bitch," but I think that life is, in general, a pretty won
derful thing. I assert this fact not because it is a ter
ribly original idea, but rather, because it is my posi
tion on the basic human issue of whether life is
something to be endured or whether it is something
to be enjoyed. No, I'm not going to gush in
Pollyanna-ish delight about how great things really
are, but you see, I want to talk about God, and I
believe that the monotheistic traditions of the West
have their origin in the idea that there is something
worthwhile, meaningful and somehow good con
nected to this world we inhabit.

To me, any discussion of the concept of God fails if
it is not based upon some analysis of the motivation
that people have for worship, because the idea of a
Supreme Being as characterized by the Judeo-
Christian mythos becomes very muddy when consid
ered from a purely philosophical viewpoint. Just look
at the kinds of questions addressed by religious phil
osophy. For instance, there is the question of
whether God could bake a bagel so huge that He
Himself could not eat it all or if God is infallible, om
nipotent and completely good and He created every
thing, why is the world imperfect? (I call this the if-
God-exists-why-does-broccoli question, but you can
substitute your own personal symbol of Absolute
Evil.) The fact is, as has been shown by the great reli
gious philosophers of the past two centuries, the
mere existence of the Judeo-Christian God cannot
be proven philosophically or scientifically. Neverthe
less, people do believe that such a being exists, and
the God worshipped in chapels, churches,
synagogues and temples has a far more concrete
presence than that abstracted by the philosophers.
It is very comfortable to believe in a God and a
Church, to know what is right and wrong and to en
joy the fellowship of people who believe as you do. I
feel, however, that this kind of comfortable religion
can be very dangerous. You see, because the exis
tence of God is not verifiable in any analytical sense,
the foundations of an organized monotheistic reli
gion must rest upon personal revelation of the god to
its prophets and saints, and when the revelations of
what should, after all, be the same god aren't the
same for different religions, the conflicts can escalate
to the point of violence. The problem with having an
absolute conviction that your brand of religion is
right is that then, because other religions differ, you
mast believe that all other religions are wrong. Even
this conviction would not be so horrible if it weren't
for the fact that there are so many busybodies in the
world who, not satisfied with their belief that you are
wrong, must try to convince you that you are wrong. I

hate it when that happens.
Another problem with comfortable mainstream
religions is that they tend to have pat, unswerving
answers to deep theological issues that are by no
means settled by a simple faith in God. Take, for ex
ample, the if-God-exists-why-does-broccoli question.
An all too well-accepted response to this question is
that, just as God is the personification of good, there
must be a nearly as powerful personification of evil,
namely Satan. The very concept of Satan scares the
hell out of me. The moment you accept the idea that
there is something absolutely corrupt influencing the
world and you believe that you can identify the
people responsible for spreading the corruption,
you are then justified for doing anything to impede
that progress. You no longer have to try to under
stand or tolerate anyone who you believe is working
the will of Satan.
And you who are smugly sitting there thinking, "I
don't believe in a Satan, so what's he going on
about?" must understand that the concept of Satan
goes under many different names. For Joe McCarthy
and his ilk, it was communism. For Ronald Reagan,
it's the Soviet Union. (Do you really think he's about
to sign a blood pact with an emissary of the Evil
Empire? Reykjavik was not surprising at all.) For ex
treme liberals, it's the Corporate World. For Stanford
students, it's Cal. It is very easy and human to villify
other people because they are doing something that
you consider to be fundamentally wrong, and quite
often it is not their problem for doing it, but rather,
yours for believing that it's wrong. To conclude,
believing in God in order to have simple answers to
hard questions and have the security of some sense
of righteousness does not seem to me to be a satisfac
tory reason for belief.
Nevertheless, I think that a belief in a monotheistic

Belief in God springs from
a sense of wonder and
marvel about the world.

God is a valid response to the world. Cut the bullshit:
I believe in God. It's simple really. I know that truly
horrible things happen to people. When I think
about how some of the people 1 know have been
hurt by others, how some people use other people
and how the most random tragedies can occur willy
nilly to anyone at any time, I shudder Nevertheless, I
have seen that many times even the most horrible
wounds can heal, that the bitterest hatreds can be
reconciled, that the most abysmal loneliness can
vanish in the time span of one sincere smile, and all
these things are nothing less than miraculous to me.

Maybe a belief in God is no more than a question of
how you look at things, but then again, maybe how
you look at things is fundamental. I think that wor
ship is essentially an appreciation of the good things
we have seen and the good things that can happen,
and a belief in God, to me, is the comforting idea that
there is ultimately a Someone who cares, who is
trying to make some kind of sense out of the confu
sion, chaos and pain that does exist.
Which brings me back to religious groups. I've
ragged on organized religions pretty heavily in this
column, but I do believe that they are important and
that they can be houses of worship in the most won
derful sense of the word. The important thing is to
find the ideas and rituals that resonate with the way
you view the world. Your heritage and culture are
important because the way you were brought up will
determine what kinds of symbols will move you spir
itually, but your spiritual view of the world will only
be richer if you are open to the wisdom of other
cultures and religions. The world is a big place, and
many people before you have had to deal with
precisely the same kinds of problems you are grap
pling with now, and so it only makes sense to get to
know the thoughts of the sages of every culture. I
guess what I'm trying to say is that if one particular
brand of religion works for you, that's great, but a
monotheistic God must ultimately be the God of
everyone, and so what other people have to say
about Him may well be important too.
Finally, let me say that if you can't accept a single,
almighty God, that's OK too. It is, after all, a pretty
strange proposition to cling to and won't, ultimately,
help you get dates. What is important is being happy
and having reasonably sound and harmonious inter
actions with all the people you encounter. Not every
one accepts that these things are important. I have
met some almost militantly unhappy people who
revel, in so far that any such person can be said to
revel about anything, in every bit of misery they wit
ness as confirmation of their conviction that life
sucks, and there are others who don't care at all
about whose toes they step on as long as they get
what they want. Ultimately, however, I believe the
true nourishment for your soul, the things that give
your life some kind of meaning, are feeling good
about who you are and sharing the acceptance and
fellowship of others. And that's true whether or not a
belief in God helps you to achieve these things.
Belief in God springs from a sense of wonder and
marvel about the world. It is not an analytical conclu
sion reached after years of study, nor does a belief in
one particular interpretation of God invalidate all
others. Believing in a God does not necessitate a
belief in Satan, nor will belief in any religion solve all
your problems. Belief in God is, however, one way to
affirm that which is worthy in the world, in the
people around you and in yourself. And that, my
friends, is a very gtxxi thing indeed

Finally, let me say that if you can't accept a single,

strange proposition to cling to and won't, ultimately,
help you get dates. What is important is being happy
and having reasonably sound and harmonious inter
actions with all the people you encounter. Not every
one accepts that these things are important. I have
met some almost militantly unhappy people who
revel, in so far that any such person can be said to
revel about anything, in every bit of misery they wit
ness as confirmation of their conviction that life
sucks, and there are others who don't care at all
about whose toes they step on as long as they get
what they want. Ultimately, however, I believe the

Life is bitchin'. Some people say that's "life's a
bitch," but I think that life is, in general, a pretty won
derful thing. I assert this fact not because it is a ter
ribly original idea, but rather, because it is my posi
tion on the basic human issue of whether life is
something to be endured or whether it is something
to be enjoyed. No, I'm not going to gush in
Pollyanna-ish delight about how great things really
are, but you see, I want to talk about God, and I
believe that the monotheistic traditions of the West
have their origin in the idea that there is something
worthwhile, meaningful and somehow good con
nected to this world we inhabit.

To me, any discussion of the concept of God fails if
it is not based upon some analysis of the motivation
that people have for worship, because the idea of a
Supreme Being as characterized by the Judeo-
Christian mythos becomes very muddy when consid
ered from a purely philosophical viewpoint. Just look
at the kinds of questions addressed by religious phil
osophy. For instance, there is the question of
whether God could bake a bagel so huge that He
Himself could not eat it all or if God is infallible, om
nipotent and completely good and He created every
thing, why is the world imperfect? (I call this the if-
God-exists-why-does-broccoli question, but you can
substitute your own personal symbol of Absolute
Evil.) The fact is, as has been shown by the great reli
gious philosophers of the past two centuries, the
mere existence of the Judeo-Christian God cannot
be proven philosophically or scientifically. Neverthe
less, people do believe that such a being exists, and
the God worshipped in chapels, churches,
synagogues and temples has a far more concrete
presence than that abstracted by the philosophers.
It is very comfortable to believe in a God and a
Church, to know what is right and wrong and to en
joy the fellowship of people who believe as you do. I
feel, however, that this kind of comfortable religion
can be very dangerous. You see, because the exis
tence of God is not verifiable in any analytical sense,
the foundations of an organized monotheistic reli
gion must rest upon personal revelation of the god to
its prophets and saints, and when the revelations of
what should, after all, be the same god aren't the
same for different religions, the conflicts can escalate
to the point of violence. The problem with having an
absolute conviction that your brand of religion is
right is that then, because other religions differ, you
mast believe that all other religions are wrong. Even
this conviction would not be so horrible if it weren't
for the fact that there are so many busybodies in the
world who, not satisfied with their belief that you are
wrong, must try to convince you that you are wrong. I

hate it when that happens.
Another problem with comfortable mainstream
religions is that they tend to have pat, unswerving
answers to deep theological issues that are by no
means settled by a simple faith in God. Take, for ex
ample, the if-God-exists-why-does-broccoli question.
An all too well-accepted response to this question is
that, just as God is the personification of good, there
must be a nearly as powerful personification of evil,
namely Satan. The very concept of Satan scares the
hell out of me. The moment you accept the idea that
there is something absolutely corrupt influencing the
world and you believe that you can identify the
people responsible for spreading the corruption,
you are then justified for doing anything to impede
that progress. You no longer have to try to under
stand or tolerate anyone who you believe is working
the will of Satan.
And you who are smugly sitting there thinking, "I
don't believe in a Satan, so what's he going on
about?" must understand that the concept of Satan
goes under many different names. For Joe McCarthy
and his ilk, it was communism. For Ronald Reagan,
it's the Soviet Union. (Do you really think he's about
to sign a blood pact with an emissary of the Evil
Empire? Reykjavik was not surprising at all.) For ex
treme liberals, it's the Corporate World. For Stanford
students, it's Cal. It is very easy and human to villify
other people because they are doing something that
you consider to be fundamentally wrong, and quite
often it is not their problem for doing it, but rather,
yours for believing that it's wrong. To conclude,
believing in God in order to have simple answers to
hard questions and have the security of some sense
of righteousness does not seem to me to be a satisfac
tory reason for belief.
Nevertheless, I think that a belief in a monotheistic

Belief in God springs from
a sense of wonder and
marvel about the world.

God is a valid response to the world. Cut the bullshit:
I believe in God. It's simple really. I know that truly
horrible things happen to people. When I think
about how some of the people 1 know have been
hurt by others, how some people use other people
and how the most random tragedies can occur willy
nilly to anyone at any time, I shudder Nevertheless, I
have seen that many times even the most horrible
wounds can heal, that the bitterest hatreds can be
reconciled, that the most abysmal loneliness can
vanish in the time span of one sincere smile, and all
these things are nothing less than miraculous to me.

Maybe a belief in God is no more than a question of
how you look at things, but then again, maybe how
you look at things is fundamental. I think that wor
ship is essentially an appreciation of the good things
we have seen and the good things that can happen,
and a belief in God, to me, is the comforting idea that
there is ultimately a Someone who cares, who is
trying to make some kind of sense out of the confu
sion, chaos and pain that does exist.
Which brings me back to religious groups. I've
ragged on organized religions pretty heavily in this
column, but I do believe that they are important and
that they can be houses of worship in the most won
derful sense of the word. The important thing is to
find the ideas and rituals that resonate with the way
you view the world. Your heritage and culture are
important because the way you were brought up will
determine what kinds of symbols will move you spir
itually, but your spiritual view of the world will only
be richer if you are open to the wisdom of other
cultures and religions. The world is a big place, and
many people before you have had to deal with
precisely the same kinds of problems you are grap
pling with now, and so it only makes sense to get to
know the thoughts of the sages of every culture. I
guess what I'm trying to say is that if one particular
brand of religion works for you, that's great, but a
monotheistic God must ultimately be the God of
everyone, and so what other people have to say
about Him may well be important too.
Finally, let me say that if you can't accept a single,
almighty God, that's OK too. It is, after all, a pretty

vanish in the time span of one sincere smile, and all
these things are nothing less than miraculous to me.

Maybe a belief in God is no more than a question of
how you look at things, but then again, maybe how
you look at things is fundamental. I think that wor
ship is essentially an appreciation of the good things
we have seen and the good things that can happen,
and a belief in God, to me, is the comforting idea that
there is ultimately a Someone who cares, who is
trying to make some kind of sense out of the confu
sion, chaos and pain that does exist.
Which brings me back to religious groups. I've
ragged on organized religions pretty heavily in this
column, but I do believe that they are important and
that they can be houses of worship in the most won
derful sense of the word. The important thing is to
find the ideas and rituals that resonate with the way
you view the world. Your heritage and culture are
important because the way you were brought up will
determine what kinds of symbols will move you spir
itually, but your spiritual view of the world will only
be richer if you are open to the wisdom of other
cultures and religions. The world is a big place, and
many people before you have had to deal with
precisely the same kinds of problems you are grap
pling with now, and so it only makes sense to get to
know the thoughts of the sages of every culture. I
guess what I'm trying to say is that if one particular
brand of religion works for you, that's great, but a
monotheistic God must ultimately be the God of
everyone, and so what other people have to say
about Him may well be important too.
Finally, let me say that if you can't accept a single,
almighty God, that's OK too. It is, after all, a pretty
strange proposition to cling to and won't, ultimately,
help you get dates. What is important is being happy
and having reasonably sound and harmonious inter
actions with all the people you encounter. Not every
one accepts that these things are important. I have
met some almost militantly unhappy people who
revel, in so far that any such person can be said to
revel about anything, in every bit of misery they wit
ness as confirmation of their conviction that life
sucks, and there are others who don't care at all
about whose toes they step on as long as they get
what they want. Ultimately, however, I believe the
true nourishment for your soul, the things that give
your life some kind of meaning, are feeling good
about who you are and sharing the acceptance and
fellowship of others. And that's true whether or not a
belief in God helps you to achieve these things.
Belief in God springs from a sense of wonder and
marvel about the world. It is not an analytical conclu
sion reached after years of study, nor does a belief in
one particular interpretation of God invalidate all
others. Believing in a God does not necessitate a
belief in Satan, nor will belief in any religion solve all
your problems. Belief in God is, however, one way to
affirm that which is worthy in the world, in the
people around you and in yourself. And that, my
friends, is a very gtxxi thing indeed
