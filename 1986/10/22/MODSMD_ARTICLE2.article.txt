# Pisano suspends Phi Delta Theta
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
The Phi Delta Theta fraternity will be
suspended until Nov. 3 and remain on
social probation until the end of the
quarter as punishment for an Oct. 7
party that violated the University Noise
Policy.
The decision resulted from recom
mendations made by the All Greek
Council (AGC), charged with inves
tigating the incident, to Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Joe PLsano, who approved
the proposal with some minor addi
tions.
Besides the noise complaints, the
AGC addressed police reports of
"heavily intoxicated" partygoers, dan
gerous conditions created by food and
beer on the floor and possible hazing
activities.
Phi Delta Theta President Stephen
Modory was unavailable for comment
last night but did clam in the AGC
report to be unaware of the Inter
fraternity Council guidelines barring
the serving of alcohol past 1:30 a.m.
The report went on to refute claims of
dangers created by a sloppy party area.
A series of IFC party guidelines were
adapted last year after being proposed
by Phi Delta Theta, after the fraternity
was disciplined for allegedly forcing
pledges to consume alcohol.
Regarding tne nature of the party,
the AGC did not fre' «-hat it was within
ate the merits

on this point Pisano's approach dif
fers from die AGC's recommendations.
Pisano expects Modory to meet with

him before Oct. 29 to make certain that
none of the party's activities were
aimed at humiliating the pledges.
"That sort of thing really pushes my
buttons," Pisano said, "But I've been
assured by the Phi Delts that it (the
party) wasn't a hazing incident.''
The final item the AGC dealt with in
volved the belligerence of a fraternity
member toward Stanford police when
they were shutting down the party. The
individual responsible was quickly
taken to his room before the situation
got out of control, according to the
AGC.'
The individual responsible for being
abrasive toward the police should
apologize personally to the officers in
volved, Pisano's letter to Modory said.
Furthermore, the rest of the police
force should be invited to the house
"to eliminate any residual animosity
and to take the first step to improve
future relations."
The fraternity has already
apologized to University President
Donald Kennedy who was awakened
after 3 a.m. by noise from the party.
Kennedy complained to the police.
Pisano said the Phi Delts should also
distribute a letter of apology to nearby
student residences.
The AGC ended its correspondence
with hopes that by explaining the
rationale backing its recommen
dations, it can deflate rumors about the
University pursuing an arbitrary "get
rid of fraternities" policy.
On a similarly optimistic note,
Pisano was "hopeful that both Phi
Delta Theta and the rest of the Stanford
community will benefit" from his and
the AGC's recommendations.
