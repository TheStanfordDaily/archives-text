## Vacationing guitar and disrobing chocolate

Dear Bug Me,
What's Jimmy Page doing these
days?
— Vera
If you're into tawdry gossip about
the rock world, keep reading. If you
want to know just exactly what firm
Jimmy Page works for, skip this ques
tion entirely.
To those who are clueless (a cate
gory to which I belonged), Jimmy Page
is a member of the rock group The
Firm. I had some trouble determining
his whereabouts because he doesn't
seem to be working on any projects at
the present time. Or at least that's what
the official word was.
"What is Jimmy Page's current proj
ect?" I asked the publicity department
of Atlantic Records in New York.
"He's with The Firm."
"Yes, I know he's with The Firm, but
what is he working on now?"

"He's on holiday and we're not
usually in contact with him when he's
on holiday."
I wanted to ask how Page knew to go
back to work if his record company
wasn't in touch with him, but I thought
that impertinent.
Undaunted, I called the music de
partment of Rolling Stone which said
that they had heard nothing about the
elusive Page and that he was probably
on holiday.
I was unable to find out whether it
was Page's rock stardom or English
background which enabled him to take
"holidays" while I take "vacations."
Still unsatisfied, I spoke with a
talkative disc jockey (I know that's
redundant) at KOME who asked that I
not use his name. According to him,
after Page finished his last album, he
got together with John Paul Jones and
Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin and Tony
Thompson of Power Station.
Thompson rocked with this group only
once, but it seems that Page, Jones and

Plant liked the sound and have been
playing together in the interim. Page
was previously, you may or may not
recall, a member of Led Zeppelin.
My source emphasized that The
Firm was still a "viable concept," but
that some change might be possible.
Unless I hear differently, Vera, you
can keep on rockin'.
Dear Bug Me,
How do they get the chocolate on the
ouside of candy bars like Snickers? In
the commercials they pour chocolate
on top hut I can't believe they do it like
that because that would waste too
much chocolate. Some of my friends
hat e suggested that maybe they dip the
candy in chocolate, but if they did that
there would be marks with no choco
late from whatever they used to hold
the candy and none of the candy I've
examined has any such marks.
Every time I eat a candy bar this
question bothers me and it's almost
enough to make me give up candy.

Please save me from this dreadful fate
— Confused in Candylatid
No, tnere is no man with a ladle that
pours chocolate over each candy bar.
This comes straight from Hans Fiuc
zynski, the director of External Rela
tions for M & M/Mars (the maker of
Snickers) in Hackettstown, New Jersey.
Fiuczynski says that the manufacture
of candy bars depends on the filling of
the bar. In the case of Snickers, the fill
ing of peanut butter nougat and
peanuts is cooked and then placed on
a conveyor in long sheets. A sheet of
caramel and peanuts are placed on top
of the filling and then a cutting ma
chine makes the sheet of potential
Snickers bars a uniform height and
shape.
At this point, the Snickers bars have
the chocolate poured over them. This
process is done in a machine called an
enrober. Be forewarned that
"enrobing" is a technical term and you
should not say as you devour your Hal
loween candy that you are "disrobing"

a Snickers.
The process in the enrober is like a
"waterfall of chocolate" that covers the
bars passing through on a screen. A cir
culating wave of chocolate coming
from under the screen coats the bot
tom of the bar. All unused chocolate is,
of course, recirculated through the en
rober. M & M/Mars is not accepting
volunteers to lick the enrober.
If the Snickers bars are on a screen,
why are there no marks on the un
derside of the bar? This question has
occurred to Fiuczynski also. The an
swer seems to be that there are some
marks on the underside, but a shaking
machine which insures a correct
percentage of chocolate on the bar
coats it with some uniformity. It is
"somewhat miraculous," says Fiuc
zynski, that through the continuous
movement the candy is completely
coated.
Or maybe they've hired Jimmy Page
to play at the Snickers factory and the
vibration coats the bars.
