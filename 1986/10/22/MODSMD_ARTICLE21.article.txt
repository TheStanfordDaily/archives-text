# Is the University robbing humanities to pay sciences?
## 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM 
Stanford and Cal, the Red Sox and Mets,
Reagan and Gorabchev, Oski and the Tree:
these opposing forces always seem to be in
conflict. But should we add to this list the
respect and support that Stanford places upon
its humanities department versus the respect
and support given to the sciences and engi
neering?
"General support for the humanities is more
token support than real support," said English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz.
What triggered Rebholz's remark was the
great difficulty he had encountered in finding a
seminar room for his Shakespeare sections.
There were simply no rooms of the right shape
available at the right time, Rebholz said.
"The University administration pretends it is
interested in first class undergraduate educa
tion, and I don't believe first class undergradu
ate eduaction can be achieved in lectures," he
explained. "If we really are committed to first
class undergraduate education in the
humanities, we need a lot more small rooms
for discussion."
But Rebholz is angry about more than just a
lack of adequate space.
"(Stanford) has always from the beginning

been an engineering school," he said, it still
has the image of being a university devoted to
engineering and natural sciences."
Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, explained that the
balance of attention between the humanities
and the sciences at Stanford is a very deep issue
that dates to the founding of the University.
"Leland Stanford wanted this place to be dif
ferent from the places on the East Coast he
thought were giving a 'useless education,' "
Lougee said. Thus, she added, Stanford's em
phasis was on the highly practical and therefore
scientific and technological fields.
Wallace Sterling began the trend to upgrade
the humanities during his tenure as president
of the University in the 1950'5, said Lougee. But
the imbalance in support for the humanities
and for the sciences "is still very deeply rooted
in the institution's very identity," she said.
"I think the Stanford humanities departments
are remarkably good given the lack of support
they've had from the administration," said Reb
holz.
"Students in the humanities suffer a kind of
parallel sense of second class citizenship," said
Lougee. She explained that a number of
humanities majors have mentioned to her that
they feel it is very difficult to declare and justify

a humanities major at a place like Stanford
where science and engineering are so high
lighted.
"I don't know if people perceive a lack of
support for the humanities outside the Univer
sity," commented senior Dave Hoffman, a phil
osophy and logic of formal systems major.
"Economically speaking, a humanities-based
career is not as profitable as an engineering
based career."
Hoffman added that he, too, felt the need to
internally justify declaring a humanities major.
"I think the University has a real commitment
to the humanities," said Robert Eustis, the asso
ciate dean of Academic Affairs for the School of
Engineering. He explained that he did not view
the humanities and engineering as an either/or
situation. Rather, he said, he hopes both could
be strong at Stanford.
The engineering school is by no means
trying to improve itself at the expense of the
humanities, he said.
"The school of engineering supports the ef
forts to strengthen the humanities," said Eustis.
"One of the greatest strengths of the school of
engineering is that it is part of a total university
rather than being a technical institute by itself."
"All of us are trying to work for the same goal
and that is a good education for our students,"

he said. "And we want that to be true in the
humanities as well as in engineering.''
To redress the imbalance and to improve the
humanities, a goal of the Centennial Campaign
is to put more funding into the humanities in
order to "build up the sense that Stanford is a
good place to study the humanities and the fine
arts," said Lougee.
William Chace, vice provost for the Centen
nial and an English professor, explained that
the bulk of the planned allocation for Centen
nial gift funds — $180 million — would be
spent on a new engineering facility. He added
that although there are no such specific
humanities funding plans, the humanities
would not lag behind the sciences in quality
improvement.
"What we have now at Stanford," Chace said,
"is a kind of engineering slum. We have to do
better if we want to maintain our position."
Chace explained further that although there
were no such specific funds for the humanities
as there were for the sciences, there was
indeed funding for the humanities. For exam
ple, Chace said, $5 million will go toward a
humanities center endowment, $19 million will
be earmarked for the fine arts program and the
construction of a theater building and $10 mil
lion will be allocated for a library endowment.

Funding for 100 humanities professors,
Chace explained, is also a goal of Centennial al
locations. He added that part of this money
could be used to endow humanities faculty
already at Stanford while part might be alloca
ted to bring new junior faculty to the University.
"Stanford is in this funny position of saying,
'We want both to be a fine undergraduate insti
tution and a fine research facility,'" com
mented Chace.
Chace explained that although it may seem
that engineering and the sciences get a dis
proportionate amount of funding, the sciences
actually put some of that money back into the
humanities as a part of every government grant
toward the sciences is given to humanities
(which does not receive government funding).
But while plans for the Near West Campus
are completed, said Lougee, plans for
humanities improvements are still very
tentative.
"Humanities (faculty) are getting impatient
again," she explained. "They see a disparity.
Again it looks like the sciences and engineering
are out ahead of the humanities."
"As yet, the (Centennial) Campaign isn't help
ing very much to make the humanities (faculty)
feel more secure," concluded Lougee. "1 cer
tainly hope it will."

"Economically speaking, a humanities-based
career is not as profitable as an engineering
based career."
Hoffman added that he, too, felt the need to
internally justify declaring a humanities major.
"I think the University has a real commitment
to the humanities," said Robert Eustis, the asso
ciate dean of Academic Affairs for the School of
Engineering. He explained that he did not view
the humanities and engineering as an either/or
situation. Rather, he said, he hopes both could
be strong at Stanford.
The engineering school is by no means
trying to improve itself at the expense of the
humanities, he said.
"The school of engineering supports the ef
forts to strengthen the humanities," said Eustis.
"One of the greatest strengths of the school of
engineering is that it is part of a total university
rather than being a technical institute by itself."
"All of us are trying to work for the same goal
and that is a good education for our students,"

he said. "And we want that to be true in the
humanities as well as in engineering.''
To redress the imbalance and to improve the
humanities, a goal of the Centennial Campaign
is to put more funding into the humanities in
order to "build up the sense that Stanford is a
good place to study the humanities and the fine
arts," said Lougee.
William Chace, vice provost for the Centen
nial and an English professor, explained that
the bulk of the planned allocation for Centen
nial gift funds — $180 million — would be
spent on a new engineering facility. He added
that although there are no such specific
humanities funding plans, the humanities
would not lag behind the sciences in quality
improvement.
"What we have now at Stanford," Chace said,
"is a kind of engineering slum. We have to do
better if we want to maintain our position."
Chace explained further that although there
were no such specific funds for the humanities
as there were for the sciences, there was
indeed funding for the humanities. For exam
ple, Chace said, $5 million will go toward a
humanities center endowment, $19 million will
be earmarked for the fine arts program and the
construction of a theater building and $10 mil
lion will be allocated for a library endowment.

Funding for 100 humanities professors,
Chace explained, is also a goal of Centennial al
locations. He added that part of this money
could be used to endow humanities faculty
already at Stanford while part might be alloca
ted to bring new junior faculty to the University.
"Stanford is in this funny position of saying,
'We want both to be a fine undergraduate insti
tution and a fine research facility,'" com
mented Chace.
Chace explained that although it may seem
that engineering and the sciences get a dis
proportionate amount of funding, the sciences
actually put some of that money back into the
humanities as a part of every government grant
toward the sciences is given to humanities
(which does not receive government funding).
But while plans for the Near West Campus
are completed, said Lougee, plans for
humanities improvements are still very
tentative.
"Humanities (faculty) are getting impatient
again," she explained. "They see a disparity.
Again it looks like the sciences and engineering
are out ahead of the humanities."
"As yet, the (Centennial) Campaign isn't help
ing very much to make the humanities (faculty)
feel more secure," concluded Lougee. "1 cer
tainly hope it will."
Stanford and Cal, the Red Sox and Mets,
Reagan and Gorabchev, Oski and the Tree:
these opposing forces always seem to be in
conflict. But should we add to this list the
respect and support that Stanford places upon
its humanities department versus the respect
and support given to the sciences and engi
neering?
"General support for the humanities is more
token support than real support," said English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz.
What triggered Rebholz's remark was the
great difficulty he had encountered in finding a
seminar room for his Shakespeare sections.
There were simply no rooms of the right shape
available at the right time, Rebholz said.
"The University administration pretends it is
interested in first class undergraduate educa
tion, and I don't believe first class undergradu
ate eduaction can be achieved in lectures," he
explained. "If we really are committed to first
class undergraduate education in the
humanities, we need a lot more small rooms
for discussion."
But Rebholz is angry about more than just a
lack of adequate space.
"(Stanford) has always from the beginning

been an engineering school," he said, it still
has the image of being a university devoted to
engineering and natural sciences."
Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, explained that the
balance of attention between the humanities
and the sciences at Stanford is a very deep issue
that dates to the founding of the University.
"Leland Stanford wanted this place to be dif
ferent from the places on the East Coast he
thought were giving a 'useless education,' "
Lougee said. Thus, she added, Stanford's em
phasis was on the highly practical and therefore
scientific and technological fields.
Wallace Sterling began the trend to upgrade
the humanities during his tenure as president
of the University in the 1950'5, said Lougee. But
the imbalance in support for the humanities
and for the sciences "is still very deeply rooted
in the institution's very identity," she said.
"I think the Stanford humanities departments
are remarkably good given the lack of support
they've had from the administration," said Reb
holz.
"Students in the humanities suffer a kind of
parallel sense of second class citizenship," said
Lougee. She explained that a number of
humanities majors have mentioned to her that
they feel it is very difficult to declare and justify

a humanities major at a place like Stanford
where science and engineering are so high
lighted.
"I don't know if people perceive a lack of
support for the humanities outside the Univer
sity," commented senior Dave Hoffman, a phil
osophy and logic of formal systems major.
"Economically speaking, a humanities-based
career is not as profitable as an engineering
based career."
