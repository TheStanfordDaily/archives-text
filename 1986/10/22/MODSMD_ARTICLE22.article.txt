## ACT is right on the dot with 'Sunday in the Park' 
### PETER MORGAN 
Let me dispense with the only real
formality of any theater review: thumbs
up or thumbs down. The show in ques
tion is "Sunday in the Park with
George," the American Conservatory
Theater's season-opening musical. In
my opinion, this is a visually stunning
production. It's worth the price of ad
mission, particularly if it's a 50 percent
discount student ticket you're buying.
The American Conservatory Theater
had a dismal season last year. When it
was over, there was a great house
cleaning in which the company hired a
new artistic director and made many
promises about a "new ACT" which
would achieve the glory of old. A huge
marketing campaign followed, and ex
pectations have been running high for
some time now. Of course, the big
question everyone has been asking is
whether the new ACT is for real or if
it's just another PR game.
Happily, the new ACT is for real.
"Sunday in the Park with George" is
not a perfect show, but it is better than
anything ACT produced last season.
This Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine
musical is an enjoyable one that looks
at the role of artists in society, both
past and present.

The first act is set in late 19th
century Paris and focuses on the life of
painter George Seurat, the impres
sionist and Pointillist painter who died
ignominiously but later became
revered by 20th-century artists. The
plot revolves around the love triangle
of George, his model and lover Dot,
and George's work. The first act shows
George, ever in pursuit of his artistic
visions, rejected by both society and
Dot.
The second act leaps to modern-day
America and follows George's great
grandson as he attempts to continue an
already successful artistic career. This
George creates "chromolumes," avant
garde art pieces that combine
sculpture, music, lasers and other art
forms. George's problem now is not
achieving recognition, but the pres
sure to create something new and
avoid going stale.
There are two big feelings this play
stirs in the theatergoer. One is a warm
peacefulness that comes from the
play's affirmation of the artist's life and
its worth; the risk of poverty and fail
ure is worth the beauty produced for
the rest of society. "Give us more to
see" is society's plea to the artist, and
certainly in the case of a Seurat it's an
understandable plea.

The other feeling is a numb depres
sion about having to watch yet another
drama about persecuted artists. It's not
that an about art is particularly bad, it's
just that there seems to be a dispropor
tionate amount of it lately. Most people
like to talk about themselves, so artists
must like to talk about artists.
On one hand, this is a warm play
about the life of visionaries who in
spire us with the beauty of their crea
tions, and, on the other, this is a trite
play that portrays artists as the center
of the universe. Since people have two
hands, I feel equally strongly about
both aspects of "Sunday in the Park
with George." It's one of those odd
things that happens to theater
reviewers.
What is not odd in any way,
however, is the beauty of the music
and images in ACT's production. Step
hen Sondheim's music isn't as easy to
hum as Gilbert and Sullivan or Lloyd-
Webber, but it is undisputably more
haunting than those composers' works:
It keeps returning in certain strains,
chords and rhythms. Experts in the
musical field call this music "richly
textured;" I just call it wonderful.
Along with the beautiful Sondheim
score is a visual feast in Richard Seger's
sets and Hope Hanafin's costumes. The

look of the stage throughout the even
ing is so rich in color and light (a
recurring motif of the play), so appeal
ing in composition of figures and
landscape and so stunning in its magi
cal scene shifts that one wonders how
ACT could change so much in a mere
four months. Part of the change is due
to Seurat's paintings, which are the
basis of the scenery, and pan of it is
due to a much larger budget.
The actors, unfortunately, play
second fiddle to the music and design.
Jeff Keller, who plays both Georges, is
quite charismatic and moving at points.
Melanie Chartoff, however, best known
for her work on the old ABC comedy
show "Fridays," is stiff and exaggerated
in her acting, as if she were worried
that the audience won't believe her
frustration with George.
"Sunday in the Park with George" is
a welcome first show in ACT's season.
The show's visual beauty and
Sondheim's music more than make up
for the humdrumness of yet another
drama about tormented artists. If the
musical's key messages are that "art
and children are all that is worth
leaving behind," that "order, design,
balance and harmony are the
stimulators of life," then the play is its
own best argument.

marketing campaign followed, and ex
pectations have been running high for
some time now. Of course, the big
question everyone has been asking is
whether the new ACT is for real or if
it's just another PR game.
Happily, the new ACT is for real.
"Sunday in the Park with George" is
not a perfect show, but it is better than
anything ACT produced last season.
This Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine
musical is an enjoyable one that looks
at the role of artists in society, both
past and present.

The first act is set in late 19th
century Paris and focuses on the life of
painter George Seurat, the impres
sionist and Pointillist painter who died
ignominiously but later became
revered by 20th-century artists. The
plot revolves around the love triangle
of George, his model and lover Dot,
and George's work. The first act shows
George, ever in pursuit of his artistic
visions, rejected by both society and
Dot.
The second act leaps to modern-day
America and follows George's great
grandson as he attempts to continue an
already successful artistic career. This
George creates "chromolumes," avant
garde art pieces that combine
sculpture, music, lasers and other art
forms. George's problem now is not
achieving recognition, but the pres
sure to create something new and
avoid going stale.
There are two big feelings this play
stirs in the theatergoer. One is a warm
peacefulness that comes from the
play's affirmation of the artist's life and
its worth; the risk of poverty and fail
ure is worth the beauty produced for
the rest of society. "Give us more to
see" is society's plea to the artist, and
certainly in the case of a Seurat it's an
understandable plea.

The other feeling is a numb depres
sion about having to watch yet another
drama about persecuted artists. It's not
that an about art is particularly bad, it's
just that there seems to be a dispropor
tionate amount of it lately. Most people
like to talk about themselves, so artists
must like to talk about artists.
On one hand, this is a warm play
about the life of visionaries who in
spire us with the beauty of their crea
tions, and, on the other, this is a trite
play that portrays artists as the center
of the universe. Since people have two
hands, I feel equally strongly about
both aspects of "Sunday in the Park
with George." It's one of those odd
things that happens to theater
reviewers.
What is not odd in any way,
however, is the beauty of the music
and images in ACT's production. Step
hen Sondheim's music isn't as easy to
hum as Gilbert and Sullivan or Lloyd-
Webber, but it is undisputably more
haunting than those composers' works:
It keeps returning in certain strains,
chords and rhythms. Experts in the
musical field call this music "richly
textured;" I just call it wonderful.
Along with the beautiful Sondheim
score is a visual feast in Richard Seger's
sets and Hope Hanafin's costumes. The

look of the stage throughout the even
ing is so rich in color and light (a
recurring motif of the play), so appeal
ing in composition of figures and
landscape and so stunning in its magi
cal scene shifts that one wonders how
ACT could change so much in a mere
four months. Part of the change is due
to Seurat's paintings, which are the
basis of the scenery, and pan of it is
due to a much larger budget.
The actors, unfortunately, play
second fiddle to the music and design.
Jeff Keller, who plays both Georges, is
quite charismatic and moving at points.
Melanie Chartoff, however, best known
for her work on the old ABC comedy
show "Fridays," is stiff and exaggerated
in her acting, as if she were worried
that the audience won't believe her
frustration with George.
"Sunday in the Park with George" is
a welcome first show in ACT's season.
The show's visual beauty and
Sondheim's music more than make up
for the humdrumness of yet another
drama about tormented artists. If the
musical's key messages are that "art
and children are all that is worth
leaving behind," that "order, design,
balance and harmony are the
stimulators of life," then the play is its
own best argument.

Let me dispense with the only real
formality of any theater review: thumbs
up or thumbs down. The show in ques
tion is "Sunday in the Park with
George," the American Conservatory
Theater's season-opening musical. In
my opinion, this is a visually stunning
production. It's worth the price of ad
mission, particularly if it's a 50 percent
discount student ticket you're buying.
The American Conservatory Theater
had a dismal season last year. When it
was over, there was a great house
cleaning in which the company hired a
new artistic director and made many
promises about a "new ACT" which
would achieve the glory of old. A huge
marketing campaign followed, and ex
pectations have been running high for
some time now. Of course, the big
question everyone has been asking is
whether the new ACT is for real or if
it's just another PR game.
