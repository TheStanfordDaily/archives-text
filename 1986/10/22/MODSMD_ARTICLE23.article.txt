# Newman scores in 'Color of Money'
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial Staff 
Remember 1961? You probably don't (Most of the
Stanford population wasn't even born yet), but it was
25 years ago that a small-time pool hustler named
Fast Eddie Felson defeated the legendary Minnesota
Fats in Robert Rossen's moody film classic, "The
Hustler."
A quarter of a century later, Paul Newman is back,
reprising one of his best roles in one of the best
movies of the year: "The Color of Money." Martin
Scorsese's latest film is more than just a sequel to
"The Hustler." It's a compelling second look at the
life of a man we came to know in a movie 25 years
ago; it's fascinating to see how Fast Eddie has grown
as a person, and to see how Paul Newman has grown
as an actor.
If you haven't seen "The Hustler," don't worry. Al
though Newman's character makes references to a
few of the situations of the earlier film, director Scor
sese has given "The Color of Money" its own plot,
themes and even its own visual style, all of which
enable the film to stand on its own as a worthy sepa
rate entity.
The plot of "The Color of Money" is relatively
simple. It's 1986 'and Eddie Felson has long since
given up pool hustling. He's now older and wiser, a
liquor dealer who occasionally fences small-time

pool hustlers. One night, one of Eddie's best hustlers
finds himself repeatedly beaten by a brash, flaky hot
shot, Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise). Eddie, seeing
both the kid's untapped potential and his lucrative
prospects, decides to take Vince under his wing. He
offers Vince and his street-smart girlfriend Carmen
(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) a trip to Atlanta for a
championship pool tournament.

One of the year's best.

Before they get to Atlanta, Eddie must undertake
the difficult task of educating Vince in the art of pool
hustling so that they can clean house when they
arrive at the tournament. Vince, naive to the eco
nomic advantages of hustling, doesn't like laying
down his ability so that a lesser player can win. He'd
much rather flaunt his talents for everyone to see and
get swept up in the exhilaration of victory and his
love for pool.
Paul Newman culminates a lifetime of work in his
portrayal of Eddie Felson, a role that might, at long
last, earn him the elusive Oscar. Newman has never
been better. His Eddie Felson is a complex combina
tion of savvy, sleaze and the hardened common
sense of a man who has grown wise through his ex

periences and mistakes. When Eddie first sees Vince
play, we can sense his excitement as Eddie sees a
chance to recapture lost glory through Vince's un
tapped talent. Eddie ultimately discovers that the
only way to recapture the triumphs of the past is to
do it himself. Newman's great achievement here is
how well he lets us feel Eddie's various conflicting
emotions.
Tom Cruise is nowhere near Newman's class, but
he nevertheless turns in an impressive performance
that shows he can act after all. Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio is equally good as Vince's intelligent,
beautiful girlfriend, who is as intent as Eddie on
making Vince realize the benefits of hustling.
Despite the great performances and characteriza
tions, the film is not without its flaws, the biggest of
which is the thin plot. In addition, Scorsese gets a bit
too pretentiously artsy with his frenetic camera
movements. The picture also slows down during the
middle, when the movie shifts to a montage of pool
playing scenes. But the biggest problem is the end
ing, which seems contrived and self-consciously up
beat.
But enough about these nitpicky details. This isn't
a movie about plot; it's a movie about people, their
strengths, weaknesses, struggles and dreams. How
the characters in"The Color of Money" deal with
their very real emotions is what makes this movie
stand above the crowd as one of the year's best.
