## The 						Co Ho: It's not just for coffee anymore 
### BOBBY LANDON 
The Coffee House used to be student run.
When a five-year agreement between Tresidder
Union and the ASSU's Coffee House Inc. expired,
the Tresidder Union board accepted bids for the
lease.
Saga Corp. was selected over several other
competitors, including the ASSU company, and
when Saga took over last year, students organized
a boycott.
It worked. "It was super slow at the beginning
of last year," said Jeff Lougee, who has run the
Coffee House since it re-opened a year ago under
Saga's management.
Today, however, the boycott has been all but
forgotten. A visit will reveal that much has
changed. For example, the ceiling has been
revamped and new lighting has been added.
Something more intangible than physical
features also has changed. There seems to be a
new feel to the Coffee House. "We've come a long
way," said Lougee. "The place is really upbeat.
Now students realize that it's not plastic-like in
here and that the Coffee House is a cool place to
hang out."
Despite the change in mangagement, the stu
dent element of the Coffee House has not disap
peared. Students are actively involved as clients,
workers, and managers. Five student managers
are responsible for the payroll, marketing, enter
tainment/menu design, hiring and the Patio Grill.
Sarah Record, in charge of scheduling and
hiring for the Coffee House, said that she has
"more responsibility now than when the ASSU
ran the Coffee House. Also, it now has a better
image than last fall and there is a big demand for
jobs."

Martha Jordan, a new employee, said she has
found the Coffee House a "really pleasant place to
work."
A perusal of the entertainment and the current
menu will reveal that die Coffee House, paradoxi
cally, is not just a coffee house anymore. Lunch in
cludes specialties such as garden pita and curried
chicken salad. Dinner offers entrees such as
fondue, bagel dogs and piroshki.
Tuesday nights mean happy hours, and jazz is
featured on Thursday nights. The bimonthly
Comedy Nights are usually packed. Students also
have the opportunity to be stars during open
mike comedy night on Oct. 29.
And the image of the Coffee House as a
graduate student hangout, the place where TAs
grade problem sets, doesn't appear justified by
the clientele.
Junior Stacey Estralla finds the atmosphere
"relaxing and intellectual," while Rick Forras, also
a junior, thinks it is a "great place to talk and lis
ten to the live music. But, ah, I don't know about
it being intellectual." Both agree that it is "like no
other place on campus."
In light of the apparent resurgence of the Cof
fee House, one may ask whether the boycott was
a failure. According to Lougee: "The boycott
really opened our eyes to the students' enthusi
asm about getting involved. We and Tresidder
realized the students care." Lougee said he en
courages student input and suggestions and that
his office door is open.
"The last time I felt any animosity was last
March," he said. "Students came in and set up
their own coffee pots. I sat down with them and
talked about the changes we have made and they
reacted positively. In fact, these days I see a lot of
them coming in here."


The Coffee House — no longer under a boycott protesting last
year's change of management — attracts undergraduates and

graduate students alike. Although it's no longer student run, it
employs more than 80 students, including five as managers.
