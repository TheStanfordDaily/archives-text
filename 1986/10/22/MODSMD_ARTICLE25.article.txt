## New nickname for Stanford 
### 
Somewhere in college nickname heaven or
other celestial pastures, a person or thing smiles
and gazes upon the campus of Santa Cruz.
Hardly a sports juggernaut, Santa Cruz excels in
another area where many universities and col
leges fail — the school nickname.

The Cruz decided against the myriad lions,
tigers and bears (oh my) and opted for something
more subtly ferocious. They call themselves the
Banana Slugs — a lettuce-eating, cabbage-patch
behemoth. It is neither cute nor pretty: a horticul
tural horror.
At this Farm, rather than following Santa Cruz's
creative lead, we chose to name ourselves after a
color. It's not tangible; it's certainly not funny.
We're nothing but an abstraction, a mere wisp of

a concept.
The Stanford Cardinal. It's OK. Things could
have been worse, I suppose. We could have been
called the Stanford Mauve, Taupe or Rust. "C'mon
Kelly Green, let's score here," we might have
been heard to holler.
It's been said, but I might as well say it again,
especially since our nickname will be plastered
on national television this weekend: We need a
new university nickname. Only three days remain
before prime time, so we've got to think fast.
Many have petitioned for Robber Barons, a
salutory gesture in honor of ole Leland Stanford
himself, who did a bit dabbling in the railroad
business. Others have cried for the resurgence of
the Indians.
We are up a tree, no doubt. Hey, that's good
transition to the Stanford Sequoias. Why not, after
all we already do possess a gyrating fir. Hell, if
we're desperate, we'll be the Stanford Blue Cards.
In this time of title trepidation, we need to stay
level-headed, analyze the sundry nickname
genres, and then after brief deliberation, call CBS
to announce our name change.
We could, like countless other universities, go

the untamed, wild beast route. There's the Michi
gan Wolverines, the Arkansas Razorbacks, the
Penn State Nittany Lions or the Texas Longhorns.
Even smaller schools have gone mean. Witness
the Lafayette College Leopards (Pa.), the Augusta
College Jaguars (Ga.), or the Bowdoin College
Polar Bears. It's the jungle book re-visited.
Fierce is nice, but I'm not sure it's Stanford.
Large animals tend to smell and squat a lot.
They're so damn ... animalistic. Let's move on.
Nobleness and gamely spirit seem to grab the
eye — a perpetual need to be a scrapper, a fighter
(not a lover). Schools like the Illinois Fighting ll
lini, the USC Trojans and the Portland State
Vikings adhere to this mold.
Of course, big barbaric marauders are not the
only people who hustle and bustle.
Look no further than the North Carolina
Weleyan Battling Bishops. If I want a non
conference football win, I don't, and I repeat, I
don't put the Earlham College Hustlin' Quakers
(Ind.) on my schedule.

tians (N.C.), the Hope College Flying
Dutchman (Mich.) and the Nyack College
Fighting Parsons (N.Y.) should also be ac
knowledged.
Indeed, we could become the Stanford
Fighting Abelards — a courageous, castrating
lot of troubadors. Ouch.
Rodents are hip in some areas. Students at
Nazareth College (N.Y.) are not adverse to
being titled the Moles. Minnesota people live
with the tag Golden Gophers. How about the
UC-Irvine Anteaters? Admittedly, it's a big ro
dent.

Put shrew or skeet with Stanford, and you
got something that resembles an alliteration if
nothing else. Remember, we're just
brainstorming.
Finally, there are those academic institu
tional callings that fall under no category,
names that have a certain, special zing or
twist.
For starters, I give you my personal favorite,
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice
Bloodhounds (N.Y.). Other grabbers include:
the Jamestown College Jimmies (N.D.), the
Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens, the Amherst
Lord Jeffs, the Heidelberg College Student
Princes (Ohio), University of Alaska Nanooks,
and once more for an encore, the Earlham
College Hustlin' Quakers.

We are up a tree, no doubt. Hey, that's good
transition to the Stanford Sequoias. Why not, after
all we already do possess a gyrating fir. Hell, if
we're desperate, we'll be the Stanford Blue Cards.
In this time of title trepidation, we need to stay
level-headed, analyze the sundry nickname
genres, and then after brief deliberation, call CBS
to announce our name change.
We could, like countless other universities, go

the untamed, wild beast route. There's the Michi
gan Wolverines, the Arkansas Razorbacks, the
Penn State Nittany Lions or the Texas Longhorns.
Even smaller schools have gone mean. Witness
the Lafayette College Leopards (Pa.), the Augusta
College Jaguars (Ga.), or the Bowdoin College
Polar Bears. It's the jungle book re-visited.
Fierce is nice, but I'm not sure it's Stanford.
Large animals tend to smell and squat a lot.
They're so damn ... animalistic. Let's move on.
Nobleness and gamely spirit seem to grab the
eye — a perpetual need to be a scrapper, a fighter
(not a lover). Schools like the Illinois Fighting ll
lini, the USC Trojans and the Portland State
Vikings adhere to this mold.
Of course, big barbaric marauders are not the
only people who hustle and bustle.
Look no further than the North Carolina
Weleyan Battling Bishops. If I want a non
conference football win, I don't, and I repeat, I
don't put the Earlham College Hustlin' Quakers
(Ind.) on my schedule.
Lest I forget, the Elon College Fightin' Chris

tians (N.C.), the Hope College Flying
Dutchman (Mich.) and the Nyack College
Fighting Parsons (N.Y.) should also be ac
knowledged.
Indeed, we could become the Stanford
Fighting Abelards — a courageous, castrating
lot of troubadors. Ouch.
Rodents are hip in some areas. Students at
Nazareth College (N.Y.) are not adverse to
being titled the Moles. Minnesota people live
with the tag Golden Gophers. How about the
UC-Irvine Anteaters? Admittedly, it's a big ro
dent.

Put shrew or skeet with Stanford, and you
got something that resembles an alliteration if
nothing else. Remember, we're just
brainstorming.
Finally, there are those academic institu
tional callings that fall under no category,
names that have a certain, special zing or
twist.
For starters, I give you my personal favorite,
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice
Bloodhounds (N.Y.). Other grabbers include:
the Jamestown College Jimmies (N.D.), the
Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens, the Amherst
Lord Jeffs, the Heidelberg College Student
Princes (Ohio), University of Alaska Nanooks,
and once more for an encore, the Earlham
College Hustlin' Quakers.
