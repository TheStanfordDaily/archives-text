# Women's soccer faces Cal State-Hayward
## 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
The competition is not getting any
easier for the Stanford women's soccer
team as it faces the Cal State-Hayward
Pioneers this afternoon.
The Cardinal will be in for a difficult
game, as the Pioneers are currently in
first place in the Northern California Ath
letic Conference. Their season record
stands at 11-1, while their conference
record is 4-0.
The Pioneers have also won their last
eight games in a row, five of those vic
tories being shutouts. For the last two
years Hayward has won its conference,
and at present the team is ranked 15th in
the nation.

Can the Cardinal come out on top
against a formidable team like Hayward?
Head Coach Helen Keohane thinks it is
possible. "Hayward is beatable. Their
one loss was a glaring loss against the
University of San Francisco," she said. "If
we play well, it will be an even game."
Much like Stanford, Hayward plays an
evenly distributed, well-balanced of
fense. The Pioneers have scored a total of
30 goals this season. Forward Denise
Regas has lead the Hayward attack,
scoring six goals this fall and recording
one assist.
Stanford will be led by its three high
scorers, midfielders Amy Geisse, Tonya
Antonucci and Stacey Keare, who have
each accounted for three goals this
year. They and the forwards should
combine to make a strong Cardinal of
fense.
Forwards like Blair Eliot, Jenny
Howick and Carolyn Denney will be
playing without teammate and forward
Jennifer Hill, however. Hill reinjured
her back in the match against Northern
Colorado and continues to recover on
a day-to-day basis.
Breaking the Hayward defense in
this game will be a challenge for the
Cardinal. The goalkeeper for the
Pioneers, sophomore Lisa Austin,
started for Hayward in its fourth game,
and she has continued to appear in the
starting lineup since then. She has
allowed an average of only .25 goals
per game this season.
The strategy for the Cardinal defense
will be to "keep them (the Hayward
midfielders) upfield and stay tight with
their forwards," said Stanford's fresh
man sweeper, Christine "Thunderfoot"
Martin.
According to Martin, Pioneer players
like Denise Regas have a goal-making
range of 40 to 50 yards, and they must
be defended against carefully and con
servatively.
And as a last resort, Cardinal
goalkeeper Vija Brookshire is no
slouch. Brookshire has contributed to
two Stanford shutouts this season, and
she has allowed an average of only 1.6
goals per game.
Since Stanford is effectively out of
playoff contention, the team takes on a
"spoiler" role in the Northern Califor
nia Athletic Conference. In other
words, the Cardinal has nothing to lose
in today's game.

Stanford goalkeeper Vija Brookshire, a sophomore from Minneapolis, has done an excellent job
for the 3-7-1 Cardinal this season, with a mere 1.6 goals against average. The women's soccer
team takes on Cal State-Hayward at home today.
