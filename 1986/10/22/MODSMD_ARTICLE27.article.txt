# Card takes on Fresno St.
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff Writer 
The Cardinal has not scored in two games —180 minutes
of ineptitude. It's not that Stanford isn't getting the opportu
nities to score; chances seem to fall out of trees. It's follow
ing through on them that has the Cardinal tied in knots.
The Stanford men's soccer team resumes conference play
this evening at Fresno State in its attempt to get back on the
scoreboard, and then back in the win column. Two con
secutive 1-0 losses, to St. Mary's and Nevada-Las Vegas, have
left a damper on the spirits of a club that was quietly confi
dent just a week and a half ago. The Cardinal is 5-7-1 and 0-1
in the Pacific Soccer Conference.
"People (on the team) feel like we deserve a better
record than what we have. We were down on each other a
little bit (in practice Monday), and it seemed like we were
kind of going through the motions. Coach (Stanford Coach
Sam Koch) has been taping the games. There really isn't
anything major we're doing wrong. It's little specific things,"
senior goalkeeper Tom Austin said.
"Things" may be an overstatement. One thing is definitely
the most glaring problem: shooting. The Cardinal is not put
ting the ball in the net, and they seem tentative when they
do get the shots.
"We worked specifically on shooting (Monday). We get to
the 18-yard stripe and then we stall. We're not shooting
enough. We played so well and so hard on Saturday (vs.
UNLV) and came up empty. Coach Koch is beside himself
wondering why we can't find the net. Goals just aren't com
ing," said Austin.
One of the few bright spots on the team right now is Aus

tin himself. He faced tremendous pressure this season com
ing off a remarkable year in which he recorded a .56 goals
against average and was second team All-Conference. He
also recorded a team record of 12 shutouts and was named
Pacific Soccer Conference Player of the Week following an
Eastern road trip that included sterling performances
against Brown and Connecticut.
This season has not lived up to those standards, but Austin
by no means is having a poor season. He enters every game
knowing anything less than a shutout may mean a loss.
"Compared to last season it's been rough. I know every
one expects a lot out of me. I compare the two seasons, and
it's disappointing when I don't get a shutout," Austin said.
Assistant Coach Hunter Stearn has played an integral role
in Austin's development.
"He's been really great to work with. He's been helping
me since sophomore year. We'll stay after practice or go out
on off days for goalkeeping work. His support was one of
the reasons I was able to get so much recognition last year,"
Austin said.
Fresno State will make Stanford's job of turning the
season around doubly tough. They are the defending con
ference champions and handed the Cardinal its only confer
ence loss last season, 1-0. Fresno State is a breakaway team
that plays excellent defense and will test Stanford's uncer
tainty up front, where no one seems willing to take chances.
Coach Koch is considering a tactic presendy employed by
Indiana University in which halfbacks are rotated in and out
of four halfback positions every 15 minutes. The theory is
that the players, knowing they will only have 15 minutes to
get the job done, will take chances both in creating and con
verting scoring opportunities.
