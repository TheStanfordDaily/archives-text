# Young men's golf team finishes 14th at UOP
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Imagine a football team with no seniors and
a majority of freshmen having to play in the
Pacific 10 Conference. Imagine a similar bas
ketball team having to play in the Atlantic
Coast Conference.
It's not a pretty thought.
But that's basically the situation faced by the
Stanford men's golf team this season. The
Cardinal roster includes no seniors and nine
freshmen among its 17 players. And to make
matters worse, the West Coast district is ex
pected to be extremely strong.
In the UOP Fall Invitational concluded yes
terday at the par-71 Woodbridge Country Club
in Lodi, the young Stanford squad continued
to struggle, finishing 14th in the 16-team
tournament with a 54-hole total of 1,132
strokes, 64 shots behind first-place Arizona.
Last weekend at the Stanford Invitational on
its own course, the Cardinal finished 16th out
of 20 teams.
Still, Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf saw some
cause for optimism. "We're gradually making
some progress," he said "Some freshmen are
making an impact. We're a very young team.
Even our older guys don't have that much ex
perience."
According to Schaaf, the team does not lack
ability; it just has not shown it. "This is the best
talent we've ever had," he said. "Our trouble is
partly due to inexperience, but it's also due to
not playing well."
Unfortunately, Stanford doesn't have the
luxury of growing up slowly this season. "This

year looks to be exceptional West Coast-wise,''
Schaaf said. "Last year was just not a real strong
year. This year it's quite the contrary."
Schaaf called Arizona "an absolutely domi
nant team" and said that Fresno State, Oregon,
Arizona State and UCLA were "not too far be
hind."
The leader-board at UOP would seem to
support Schaaf, as Oregon (1,086 strokes),
Fresno State (1,090) and Arizona State (1,091)
finished second, third and fourth, respectively.
UCLA did not play. At Stanford last weekend,
Fresno State was the winner, with Arizona
second and Arizona State third.
"There are five teams (Arizona, ASU, FSU,
Oregon and UCLA) that are very well
established out here, and they're not going to
play any worse," Schaaf said. "Our challenge is
to bring our level of play up. It's a high level,
and it's quite a challenge."
It is even more of a challenge considering
that Brigham Young, currently the No. 1 team
in the nation, could not beat the four West
Coast teams at UOP. The top-ranked Cougars
shot 1,097 to finish fifth.
Freshman Don Christensen, playing in his
second tournament for Stanford, lead the
Cardinal with a 223 total. Another freshman,
Steve White, tied with sophomore Brad Geer
at 225. John Dickey and Rich Marik both shot
230, while Cole Thompson finished at 237.
Arizona State's Bill Mayfair, who won the
Stanford Invitational, tied Mike Springer of
Arizona for the individual title at 208. The
results of their playoff were unavailable.
The Cardinal will be off for three weeks
before playing in the USF Invitational at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco.
