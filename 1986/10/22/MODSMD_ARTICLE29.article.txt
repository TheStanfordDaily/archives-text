BOSTON (AP) â€” Bob Ojeda pitched New York
to victory over his former teammates and Len
Dykstra ignited the Mets offense as they averted
almost certain elimination by beating the Boston
Red Sox 7-1 in Game 3 of the World Series.
Down 2-0 after losing the first two games at
New York 1-0 and 9-3, the Mets scored four runs
in the first inning off Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd.
Dykstra led off the game with a homer, and the
Red Sox botched a crucial rundown play as the
Mets had their biggest inning of the Series.
Dykstra had four hits, and Gary Carter had
three RBIs with two hits as the Mets unloaded 13
hits, one more than their total for the first two
games. Every starter except Mookie Wilson had at

least one hit.
The victory sent the Mets into Game 4 Wednes
day night with Ron Darling, 15-6, pitching on
three days' rest against Al Nipper, 10-12, who has
yet to throw a pitch in post season. Darling
allowed three hits and one run over seven in
nings to lose Game 1.
Ojeda, who won 18 games after he was traded
to the Mets from Boston last December, allowed
five hits in the seven innings he pitched. He
allowed only a third-inning run in becoming the
first left-hander to beat Boston at Fenway Park in a
World Series game since Hippo Vaughn of the
Chicago Cubs in 1918. The Red Sox also were in
the World Series in 1946, '67 and '75.

Ojeda, 20-17 lifetime in Fenway Park, walked
three and struck out six. In the second and sixth
innings, Ojeda got former batterymate Rich Ged
man on called third strikes for the third out with
runners at second base.
Roger McDowell blanked the Red Sox in the
last two innings.
After the first inning, the emotional Boyd got
his delicate act back together, retiring 11 in a row
at one point, but the bulk of the damage already
had been done. Boyd, who won 16 games this
season, allowed six runs on nine hits over seven
innings before he was relieved by Joe Sambito.
Sambito gave up a run-scoring double by Ray
Knight in the eighth.
