# Zoning change paves way for Reagan Library
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
The Palo Alto City Council Monday
night unanimously approved criteria
allowing "low intensity" land use of
University property designated Aca
demic Reserve and Open Space, thus
facilitating the development of the con
troversial Reagan Presidential Library
on a site ofFJunipero Serra Blvd.
According to a report by the Palo
Alto Planning Commission, "low inten
sity" land use should "permit
reasonable use of open space land,
while at the same time preserving and
protecting its inherent open space
characteristics for the following: as
agricultural land, scenic land, recrea
tion land, conservation of natural
resource land; for the containment of
urban sprawl and the structuring of ur
ban development."
Despite the council's unanimous ap
proval of the criteria, questions were
raised as to whether or not the library
would actually constitute "low inten
sity" use.
According to Anthony Siegman, pro
fessor of electrical engineering and
member of the executive committee of
the Stanford Foothill Residents Group,
the Reagan Library will not be used
solely as an archival library housing
presidential papers, but also as a major
conference center. Should the library
be used as such, significant noise and
traffic problems would result, Seigman
contended.

In a letter read before the council
Monday night, Siegman told council
members: "You should be aware that
what will be built in the Stanford foot
hills, if you approve the plans before
you, will not be just a 'Ronald Reagan
Library' but a 'Ronald Reagan Library
and Conference Center.'"
Central to Siegman s concern is the
library's proposed 350-seat
auditorium, which he said is "not usual
or essential" in an archival library.
However, Charles Palm, Hoover In
stitution archivist and Stanford repre
sentative of the Reagan Presidential
Foundation, disagreed with Siegman's
contentions. Palm said today that,
"Every other presidential library has an
auditorium," and noted that some,
such as the John F. Kennedy Library,
have more than one.
The auditorium would be used
primarily for talks by the president,
cabinet members and other govern
ment officials when they visit Stanford,
Palm said. "We do see the library as
being a part of the Stanford academic
program, integrated with activity on
campus."
Now that the "low intensity" land
use criteria have been approved by the
City Council, the library project can go
forward with the process of approval
by Santa Clara County. Included in the
process of gaining final approval for
the library is the review of an environ
mental impact report. If there are no
delays, ground breaking could take
place as early as next summer.
