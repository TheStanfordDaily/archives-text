# Heated debate over AIDS prop.
## 
### KENT EATON 
People who test positive for exposure to the
AIDS virus should be prohibited from both attend
ing and working at any institution of learning, ac
cording to Brian Lantz, co-author of the controver
sial Proposition 64, which will appear on Novem
ber ballots.
As pan of the California Week forum held here,
Lantz and U.S. Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-
Orange County) argued for the "Laßouche Initia
tive" in a heated debate on Monday with David
Kirp, professor of Public Policy at UC-Berkeley, and
San Francisco Attorney Mathew Coles.
Lantz, a candidate for the California Senate in
Laßouche's National Democratic Party, called for
"the placement of AIDS on the list of com
municable diseases so that its carriers will be sub
ject to existing health statutes. There shall be
reporting of the names of these carriers and they
shall work neither in the food services industry nor
at any school."
Coles, however, strongly disagreed.
"Proposition 64 is the antithesis of classical health
measures in that it would treat AIDS like an airborn
disease." AIDS is only transmitted "by sexual inter
course without a condom or by the sharing of IV
needles," Coles said.
Not so, said Lantz. "The Pasteur Institute has
found that insects could be reservoirs for the virus,
so AIDS may well be spread by casual contact."
Lantz said that the initiative calls for AIDS to be

classified as a communicable disease and would
fund a $2 billion research project.
'The very infinitesimal risk of contracting AIDS
through casual contact in no way merits the label
ing of hundreds of thousands of people lepers,"
Coles said.
Dannemeyer argued that "those with AIDS
should not be entitled to anonymity." He ques
tioned the fact that "it is a criminal offense to
engage in sexual intercourse if one has a venereal
disease, but not if one has the non-curable, fatal
disease AIDS."
Kirp called this stance, "homophobia in drag,"
and warned of "the second AIDS epidemic
represented by the supporters of Proposition 64
who have induced hysteria, ostracism and the talk
of quarantine. The Prevent AIDS Now Initiative
Committee (PANIC) is the real spreader of this
disease."
Dannemeyer, however, said the initiative "does
not mandate that anyone be quarantined," and that
"it makes nothing mandatory or optional."
After debating the proposition's validity as a
health concern, the forum then turned to eco
nomic issues. According to Dannemeyer, the AIDS
epidemic will cost $15 billion in five years. He said
this cost represents a "tragic loss of health care dol
lars which comes out of our pockets."
But, said Coles, "The proposition itself will cost
the state over $2 billion in terms of its implementa
tion and in the lost output of the 95,000 who will
lose their jobs. That's too damn much money to

throw at something that won't save one life."
The opponents of the initiative also questioned
its support base. Kirp said. "It is hard to think of
anyone who supports this initiative. Tonight you
are seeing about half of them. "
Lantz explained this disparity by saying, "We
went outside of the medical institution, whose
response to this epidemic has been criminally
negligent, to gain support from individuals."
Added Dannemeyer: "The male homosexual
community, which comprises 73 percent of all
AIDS cases, has intimidated health officials into op
posing Proposition 64. It is appalling that the
leaders of the medical profession have allowed
smoke to be blown in their faces."
Kirp also questioned Dannemeyer's backing,
stating that "all five of the estimable congressman's
proposed bills, one of which bars children
exposed to the virus from school, have been
opposed by every single health establishment."
The debate often grew heated as Kirp cited
Lantz's ties to Laßouche and questioned
Laßouche's ability as a political leader. When Lantz
said, "I think you misrepresent Mr. Laßouche,"
Kirp responded, "Only kindly."
Dannemeyer completed his argument by saying
that "The AIDS crisis says each of us has a personal
duty to lead monogamous, heterosexual lifestyles."
Replied Kirp: "Proposition 64 enshrines bigotry
at a time when we should be joining together to
look for a cure."

"it makes nothing mandatory or optional."
After debating the proposition's validity as a
health concern, the forum then turned to eco
nomic issues. According to Dannemeyer, the AIDS
epidemic will cost $15 billion in five years. He said
this cost represents a "tragic loss of health care dol
lars which comes out of our pockets."
But, said Coles, "The proposition itself will cost
the state over $2 billion in terms of its implementa
tion and in the lost output of the 95,000 who will
lose their jobs. That's too damn much money to

throw at something that won't save one life."
The opponents of the initiative also questioned
its support base. Kirp said. "It is hard to think of
anyone who supports this initiative. Tonight you
are seeing about half of them. "
Lantz explained this disparity by saying, "We
went outside of the medical institution, whose
response to this epidemic has been criminally
negligent, to gain support from individuals."
Added Dannemeyer: "The male homosexual
community, which comprises 73 percent of all
AIDS cases, has intimidated health officials into op
posing Proposition 64. It is appalling that the
leaders of the medical profession have allowed
smoke to be blown in their faces."
Kirp also questioned Dannemeyer's backing,
stating that "all five of the estimable congressman's
proposed bills, one of which bars children
exposed to the virus from school, have been
opposed by every single health establishment."
The debate often grew heated as Kirp cited
Lantz's ties to Laßouche and questioned
Laßouche's ability as a political leader. When Lantz
said, "I think you misrepresent Mr. Laßouche,"
Kirp responded, "Only kindly."
Dannemeyer completed his argument by saying
that "The AIDS crisis says each of us has a personal
duty to lead monogamous, heterosexual lifestyles."
Replied Kirp: "Proposition 64 enshrines bigotry
at a time when we should be joining together to
look for a cure."
