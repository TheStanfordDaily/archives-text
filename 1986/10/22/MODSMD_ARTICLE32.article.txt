# The 						Bear? Stanford? No comment

### CHRIS SAIGAL 
"People from Berkeley's band have
called and asked us. People from Stan
ford's band have asked us. Numerous
Berkeley students have asked us. The
Stanford administration has asked us,"
said senior Mike Tuchin, chair of the
Axe Committee.
The question everyone seems to be

asking the Axe Committee is "Do you
have the Bear?''
The whereabouts of Berkeley's mas
cot has been a cause of concern for
Berkeley police and many Berkeley
students since the 7-foot-tall stuffed
brown bear was stolen in July.
According to Tuchin, because the
bear weighs more than 250 pounds, it
was probably stolen by a group. Since

its theft, the Bear has been sighted
twice in the back of an old blue Toyota
pick-up truck, once near Berkeley and
once on Highway 101 near Moffet field.
Police searching the areas after the
sightings have found no trace of the
Bear or the truck, he added.
The Axe Committee's official
response to the question of whether it
has the Bear is "no comment," said
Tuchin. In order to publicize its posi
tion, the Axe Committee yesterday ran
an ad in the Daily Californian,
Berkeley's student paper.
The ad reads: "The Bear? The Stan
ford Axe Committee? No Comment."
with a picture beneath showing mem
bers of the Axe Committee shrugging
their shoulders.
"We don't know how they (the
Berkeley community) will react," Tuc
hin said. The Axe Committee intends
for the ad to put a stop to phone calls
to the committee regarding the Bear.
"It's naive of them to call and ask if we
have it."he said.
Tina Hoppe, chairperson of the UC
Rally Committee, seemed surprised
when she learned of the ad. "I think
they know where it is and they don't
want to tell," she said.
Hoppe doesn't believe the Axe Com
mittee has the Bear, however. "I don't
think they are that stupid," she said.. "If
they have it and they get caught, they
would be in a lot of trouble." Hoppe
said that Tuchin had told her that the

Bear was in the hands of a Stanford
alumnus.
Tuchin is not worried that the police
may become more suspicious of the
Axe Committee's role in the theft. "The
police are suspicious already. If they
have any proof, let them produce it
and find the Bear," he said. Tuchin said
he found it "humorous that Berkeley
police are chasing all over looking for
the Bear."
Tuchin said he is aware of the
criticism from some in the Berkeley
community that the whole controversy
surrounding the location of the Bear is
juvenile and a waste of police re
sources.
"Where do you draw the line be
tween what is rational and irrational?
You can t really be rational about
something dear to your heart," he said.
Responding to the accusation —
published in a recent Daily Californian
article — that police time spent
looking for the Bear takes away time
that could be spent protecting citizens
(the article cited an on-campus rape as
a crime that might have been
prevented), Tuchin said: "I do em
pathize with the police. Obviously, if
given a choice you would rather
prevent a rape, but if the police had
not been looking for the Bear, they still
might not have stopped the rape. It
isn't clear."
Asked if the Axe Committee has any
future plans to reveal the whereabouts
of the Bear, Tuchin responded: "No
comment."
