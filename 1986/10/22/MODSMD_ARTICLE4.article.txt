### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer With wire reports 
IBM Corp., Stanford's second-largest
South Africa-related investment, an
nounced yesterday that it will
withdraw from South Africa by March
1,1987.
Stanford's IBM stock is valued at
about $23 million. The University owns
more stock in only one South Africa
related company, Hewlett-Packard, in
which Stanford's investment is approx
imately $25 million. General Motors, in
which Stanford owns $7 million of
stock, announced Monday that it would
withdraw from South Africa.
Hewlett-Packard said yesterday that
it would not reconsider its South
African involvement as a result of the
announcements. "Our plans now are
to remain there indefinitely," said
spokesman Gene Endicott.
As world leaders in their industries,
GM and IBM were formidable obsta
cles to those who sought to have U.S.
corporations divest themselves of
operations in South Africa. In addition,
GM has operated in the country for
about 50 years, IBM for 34 years, and
the companies are among the 10 big
gest U.S. employers in South Africa.
"It's a terribly important combina
tion of withdrawals I fully expect
the trickle of about 60 companies who
have left in the past couple of years to
become a flood," said Timothy Smith,
executive director of the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility, u
coalition of church groups active in
seeking divestment of business inter
ests in South Africa.

Like General Motors, IBM had long
resisted calls by anti-apartheid lob
byists and some stockholder activists
for its withdrawal from South Africa,
saying that it preferred to remain in the
country and work for positive social
change from within as long as business
conditions permitted.
GM and IBM stood at the vanguard
of those attempting to work from
within the South African system to en
courage reform. They were two of the
three original companies to adopt the
Sullivan Principles and pressured
other American firms to follow suit, ac
cording to Kirk Hanson, 1983-84 chair
man of Stanford's Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR).
In 1985, both IBM and GM received
the highest rating possible on the Sul
livan Principles, a set of racial
guidelines for American companies in
South Africa.
The two are members of the Ameri
can Chamber of Commerce, an organi
zation that works for social reform in
South Africa, and GM Chairman Roger
Smith is also co-chairman of the U.S.
Corporate Council on South Africa.
The council, composed of executives
from companies with South Africa
operations, has sought to influence the
government's social policies.
But in a Monday statement, Smith
said frustration with the pace of change
in South Africa was one reason for
GM's withdrawal: "We have been dis
appointed in the pace of change in
ending apartheid."
IBM Chairman John Akers said: "We
consistently have said that IBM would
