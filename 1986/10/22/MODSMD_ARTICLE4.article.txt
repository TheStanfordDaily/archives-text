# IBM withdraws from S. Africa
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer With wire reports 
IBM Corp., Stanford's second-largest
South Africa-related investment, an
nounced yesterday that it will
withdraw from South Africa by March
1,1987.
Stanford's IBM stock is valued at
about $23 million. The University owns
more stock in only one South Africa
related company, Hewlett-Packard, in
which Stanford's investment is approx
imately $25 million. General Motors, in
which Stanford owns $7 million of
stock, announced Monday that it would
withdraw from South Africa.
Hewlett-Packard said yesterday that
it would not reconsider its South
African involvement as a result of the
announcements. "Our plans now are
to remain there indefinitely," said
spokesman Gene Endicott.
As world leaders in their industries,
GM and IBM were formidable obsta
cles to those who sought to have U.S.
corporations divest themselves of
operations in South Africa. In addition,
GM has operated in the country for
about 50 years, IBM for 34 years, and
the companies are among the 10 big
gest U.S. employers in South Africa.
"It's a terribly important combina
tion of withdrawals I fully expect
the trickle of about 60 companies who
have left in the past couple of years to
become a flood," said Timothy Smith,
executive director of the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility, u
coalition of church groups active in
seeking divestment of business inter
ests in South Africa.

Like General Motors, IBM had long
resisted calls by anti-apartheid lob
byists and some stockholder activists
for its withdrawal from South Africa,
saying that it preferred to remain in the
country and work for positive social
change from within as long as business
conditions permitted.
GM and IBM stood at the vanguard
of those attempting to work from
within the South African system to en
courage reform. They were two of the
three original companies to adopt the
Sullivan Principles and pressured
other American firms to follow suit, ac
cording to Kirk Hanson, 1983-84 chair
man of Stanford's Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR).
In 1985, both IBM and GM received
the highest rating possible on the Sul
livan Principles, a set of racial
guidelines for American companies in
South Africa.
The two are members of the Ameri
can Chamber of Commerce, an organi
zation that works for social reform in
South Africa, and GM Chairman Roger
Smith is also co-chairman of the U.S.
Corporate Council on South Africa.
The council, composed of executives
from companies with South Africa
operations, has sought to influence the
government's social policies.
But in a Monday statement, Smith
said frustration with the pace of change
in South Africa was one reason for
GM's withdrawal: "We have been dis
appointed in the pace of change in
ending apartheid."
IBM Chairman John Akers said: "We
consistently have said that IBM would
remain in South Africa as long as we
could maintain an economically sound
business and contribute to peaceful
change. Unfortunately, the deteriorat
ing political and economic situation in
South Africa, and between South Africa
and its trading partners, makes our ac
tion necessary."
IBM officials said that the decision
was based on business considerations,
even though it continues to make a
profit there.
One of GM's primary concerns was
profit, according to Smith's statement.
GM executives told The New York
Times that GM's operation in South
Africa has not made a profit since 1981,
and Smith said, "We could not see our
operations turning around in the near
future."
Current CIR Chairman Frederick
Hillier said the statements indicate
recognition "that (IBM and GM) were
unable to be a significant positive
force."
Hillier said campus protests, letters
to companies from trustees and stock
holder resolutions have "played a

major role in bringing these compan
ies to really address the role they're
playing in South Africa and not playing
by withdrawing from South Africa."
Former CIR Chairman Hanson said
"virtually every company operating in
South Africa is examining the evidence
on both the economic and ethical
viability of their operations."
The depressed South African eco
nomy will not recover until the apart
heid issue is resolved, said Hanson,
who lectures on business ethics and
business/government relations at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Business.
Ethically, Hanson said, companies
have based their continued presence
on two factors: that progress was being
made toward the abolition of apartheid
and that the companies were contribu
ting to the well-being of black South
Africans through the adoption of equal
employment opportunity standards
and other measures.
"Stanford faces exactly the same
problem corporations do. If it con
cludes that those two principles no
longer hold, then it ought to pressure
companies still in South Africa to get
out," Hanson said.
During the last two years "the moral
underpinnings have been shaken if not
destroyed," said Hanson.

"I think (IBM and GM's withdrawals)
put tremendous pressure on other
companies in South Africa," Hanson
said. Remaining in South Africa "is bad
public relations, and it is getting more
difficult to make the moral argument
that continued involvement is leading
to more liberalization and the end of
apartheid"
IBM's subsidiary in South Africa
employs somewhat fewer than 1,500
people, of which 23 percent are non
white. IBM in South Africa is not a
manufacturing operation, but handles
sales, service and support to IBM cus
tomers. It owns no buildings in South
Africa, and a company spokeswoman
said assets were minimal.
The subsidiary will be sold to a new
company headed by Jack Clarke, cur
rent general manager of the subsidiary.
While it will not use "IBM" in its name,
it will sell and service IBM machines.
IBM will be a major creditor of the new
company.
IBM said that its sales in South Africa
and its market share had been declin
ing in recent years, in part because of
increasingly restrictive conditions
faced there by U.S. computer makers.
The U.S. Department of Commerce
forbids the sale of computers by U.S.-
based companies to the military,

police, prison system or other agencies
that enforce the system of racial dis
crimination.
Officials at the South African Em
bassy in Washington refused to
comment on both the GM and IBM an
nouncements.
In South Africa, however, top busi
ness leaders privately expressed shock
and deep regret at the IBM action. The
back-to-back withdrawals are expected
to be raised at a Nov. 7 meeting that
South African President Pieter Botha
has called with 200 of the country's top
business executives. It is expected that
the business leaders, fearing a cascade
of departures, will press for faster
reform at the meeting.
The IBM pullout, coupled with a
planned withdrawal by General
Motors, will lower Stanford's stake in
South Africa-related companies from
about $184 million to approximately
$155 million.
According to the Investor Responsi
bility Research Center in Washington,
seven U.S. firms withdrew from South
Africa in 1984, 38 in 1985 and 21 in
1986. Stanford owns nearly $5 million
worth of stock in one of the firms
which pulled out of South Africa ear
lier this year, Baxter Travenol.

government's social policies.
But in a Monday statement, Smith
said frustration with the pace of change
in South Africa was one reason for
GM's withdrawal: "We have been dis
appointed in the pace of change in
ending apartheid."
IBM Chairman John Akers said: "We
consistently have said that IBM would
remain in South Africa as long as we
could maintain an economically sound
business and contribute to peaceful
change. Unfortunately, the deteriorat
ing political and economic situation in
South Africa, and between South Africa
and its trading partners, makes our ac
tion necessary."
IBM officials said that the decision
was based on business considerations,
even though it continues to make a
profit there.
One of GM's primary concerns was
profit, according to Smith's statement.
GM executives told The New York
Times that GM's operation in South
Africa has not made a profit since 1981,
and Smith said, "We could not see our
operations turning around in the near
future."
Current CIR Chairman Frederick
Hillier said the statements indicate
recognition "that (IBM and GM) were
unable to be a significant positive
force."
Hillier said campus protests, letters
to companies from trustees and stock
holder resolutions have "played a

major role in bringing these compan
ies to really address the role they're
playing in South Africa and not playing
by withdrawing from South Africa."
Former CIR Chairman Hanson said
"virtually every company operating in
South Africa is examining the evidence
on both the economic and ethical
viability of their operations."
The depressed South African eco
nomy will not recover until the apart
heid issue is resolved, said Hanson,
who lectures on business ethics and
business/government relations at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Business.
Ethically, Hanson said, companies
have based their continued presence
on two factors: that progress was being
made toward the abolition of apartheid
and that the companies were contribu
ting to the well-being of black South
Africans through the adoption of equal
employment opportunity standards
and other measures.
"Stanford faces exactly the same
problem corporations do. If it con
cludes that those two principles no
longer hold, then it ought to pressure
companies still in South Africa to get
out," Hanson said.
During the last two years "the moral
underpinnings have been shaken if not
destroyed," said Hanson.

"I think (IBM and GM's withdrawals)
put tremendous pressure on other
companies in South Africa," Hanson
said. Remaining in South Africa "is bad
public relations, and it is getting more
difficult to make the moral argument
that continued involvement is leading
to more liberalization and the end of
apartheid"
IBM's subsidiary in South Africa
employs somewhat fewer than 1,500
people, of which 23 percent are non
white. IBM in South Africa is not a
manufacturing operation, but handles
sales, service and support to IBM cus
tomers. It owns no buildings in South
Africa, and a company spokeswoman
said assets were minimal.
The subsidiary will be sold to a new
company headed by Jack Clarke, cur
rent general manager of the subsidiary.
While it will not use "IBM" in its name,
it will sell and service IBM machines.
IBM will be a major creditor of the new
company.
IBM said that its sales in South Africa
and its market share had been declin
ing in recent years, in part because of
increasingly restrictive conditions
faced there by U.S. computer makers.
The U.S. Department of Commerce
forbids the sale of computers by U.S.-
based companies to the military,

police, prison system or other agencies
that enforce the system of racial dis
crimination.
Officials at the South African Em
bassy in Washington refused to
comment on both the GM and IBM an
nouncements.
In South Africa, however, top busi
ness leaders privately expressed shock
and deep regret at the IBM action. The
back-to-back withdrawals are expected
to be raised at a Nov. 7 meeting that
South African President Pieter Botha
has called with 200 of the country's top
business executives. It is expected that
the business leaders, fearing a cascade
of departures, will press for faster
reform at the meeting.
The IBM pullout, coupled with a
planned withdrawal by General
Motors, will lower Stanford's stake in
South Africa-related companies from
about $184 million to approximately
$155 million.
According to the Investor Responsi
bility Research Center in Washington,
seven U.S. firms withdrew from South
Africa in 1984, 38 in 1985 and 21 in
1986. Stanford owns nearly $5 million
worth of stock in one of the firms
which pulled out of South Africa ear
lier this year, Baxter Travenol.
IBM Corp., Stanford's second-largest
South Africa-related investment, an
nounced yesterday that it will
withdraw from South Africa by March
1,1987.
Stanford's IBM stock is valued at
about $23 million. The University owns
more stock in only one South Africa
related company, Hewlett-Packard, in
which Stanford's investment is approx
imately $25 million. General Motors, in
which Stanford owns $7 million of
stock, announced Monday that it would
withdraw from South Africa.
Hewlett-Packard said yesterday that
it would not reconsider its South
African involvement as a result of the
announcements. "Our plans now are
to remain there indefinitely," said
spokesman Gene Endicott.
As world leaders in their industries,
GM and IBM were formidable obsta
cles to those who sought to have U.S.
corporations divest themselves of
operations in South Africa. In addition,
GM has operated in the country for
about 50 years, IBM for 34 years, and
the companies are among the 10 big
gest U.S. employers in South Africa.
"It's a terribly important combina
tion of withdrawals I fully expect
the trickle of about 60 companies who
have left in the past couple of years to
become a flood," said Timothy Smith,
executive director of the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility, u
coalition of church groups active in
seeking divestment of business inter
ests in South Africa.

Like General Motors, IBM had long
resisted calls by anti-apartheid lob
byists and some stockholder activists
for its withdrawal from South Africa,
saying that it preferred to remain in the
country and work for positive social
change from within as long as business
conditions permitted.
GM and IBM stood at the vanguard
of those attempting to work from
within the South African system to en
courage reform. They were two of the
three original companies to adopt the
Sullivan Principles and pressured
other American firms to follow suit, ac
cording to Kirk Hanson, 1983-84 chair
man of Stanford's Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR).
In 1985, both IBM and GM received
the highest rating possible on the Sul
livan Principles, a set of racial
guidelines for American companies in
South Africa.
The two are members of the Ameri
can Chamber of Commerce, an organi
zation that works for social reform in
South Africa, and GM Chairman Roger
Smith is also co-chairman of the U.S.
Corporate Council on South Africa.
The council, composed of executives
from companies with South Africa
operations, has sought to influence the
