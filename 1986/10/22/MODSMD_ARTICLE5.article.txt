# Space researchers struggle for NASA money
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
One year ago, Elliot Bennett owned a gov
ernment grant he thought would last until his
research in astronautical communication was
completed and his experiment had flown
aboard the space shuttle.
But in June this year, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration told Ben
nett, a graduate student in astronautics and
aeronautics here, that his funding had been ter
minated and that no more money was likely to
come his way in the near future.
Faced with the prospect of having to aban

don his research and his engineer's degree
only nine months away from their completion,
Bennett appealed to private aerospace firms in
the United States and Europe for sponsorship.
The best he could find was a job offer from a
German aerospace company and a Stanford re
search assistant position that would pay his tui
tion.
"It was a real predicament," Bennett said. "1
had to decide whether to bag the whole degree
or shell out the money personally. I was lucky
the research assistantship came through, but it's
really sad I had to go to the German govern
ment to support my work."
Other space researchers here and across the

country have not been so lucky in the struggle
to keep their work alive despite serious NASA
funding cutbacks in space research. The space
agency that once actively supported scientific
research at institutions like Stanford has come
to a standstill since the explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger last January, and researchers
like Bennett are paying the price.
Stanford still ranks first among the nation's
research institutions with about $270 million in
NASA funds allocated this year, but, since the
shuttle explosion and the resulting confusion at
NASA, little of the money has been distributed.
"And if it's not going to us, it's not going
anywhere," Bennett said.

The problem, though, is much more far
reaching than individual funding, researchers
say. If NASA cannot regain the morale it lost in
the Challenger accident, catch up with its
shuttle launch schedule and restore funding to
U.S. space research projects, there may not be a
next generation of space scientists in the United
States.
NASA's new leadership has yet to indicate
what position it will take on support of basic
scientific research, but scientists hope the fund
ing and opportunities will return.
"We've got to divert a whole lot of money to
support the scientific infrastructure," said Mi
chael Wiskerchen, a senior research associate at

the Stanford Electronics Lab. "Otherwise, when
they fly, they'll find out they don't have a scien
tific community."
From bad to worse
Before the space shuttle explosion, NASA's
Office of Space Science was already years be
hind schedule and increasingly reluctant to
provide grants for new projects. But when the
Challenger exploded 74 seconds after lift-off on
Jan. 30, killing all seven crew members and
destroying the $1.2 billion spacecraft, the prob-
lems multiplied exponentially.
The shuttle program will resume
regular launches in 1988 at the earliest,
after engineers redesign the faulty
rocket-boosters that led to the explo
sion. But while engineers rework the
shuttle, NASA is forcing scientists, who
compete heavily for grants and shuttle
space for their experiments during the
best of times, to play a waiting game.
"It's a big struggle for NASA," said
Wiskerchen, who worked as a NASA
scientist for six-and-a-half years. "NASA
continues to be in the treading-water
mode. Now (since the Challenger acci
dent), it has only gotten worse. Now,
you have definite treading water for at
least three years."
On paper, the money is still there.
NASA has steadily increased its funding
of university research over the last 10
years. The agency gave $177.3 million
to universities in 1980, $255 million in
1985 and an estimated $270 million
this year, according to Frank Owens,
deputy director of NASA's Education
Affairs Division. Stanford ranked first
in NASA funding for fiscal 1985, receiv
ing $17.18 million or 4.7 percent of all
NASA money given to U.S. universities,
Owens said. In reality, however, only a
fraction of the money is getting
through to the researchers.
The funding cutbacks result in part
from NASA's reluctance to spend
money developing yet more projects
that would increase an already over
whelming backlog of experiments de
signed to fly on the shuttle several
years ago, but the cuts have been ag
gravated by the internal struggles and
leadership purges at NASA.
"Because of the internal confusion,
they're very hesitant to make decisions
at NASA," Bennett said. "Nobody there
is willing to put his name on the dotted
line. It's taking incredible effort on our
part to get anything through."
Since the Challenger accident, the
directors of NASA, the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and the
Marshall Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., have retired, along with much of
the middle management at all three
offices.
The first thing NASA must decide
before it resumes launching the shuttle

is exactly what the program's priorities
are, according to Applied Physics I rof.
Arthur Walker, who earlier this year
served on President Reagan's commis
sion that sought to find the cause of the
Challenger accident and make recom
mendations for improvements. NASA is
caught between too many competing
demands, Walker said, citing classified
Department of Defense payloads, com
mercial satellite programs and purely
scientific experiments as the three in
terests asking too much of the shuttle
program.
The pressure on NASA became still
more intense when some U.S. re
searchers began predicting that other
nations, particularly the Soviet Union
and Japan, are overtaking the U.S. pro
gram while NASA devoted all its atten
tion to finding the source of the
Challenger accident and gave lower
priority to basic space research,
"The country really needs a vigorous
space research program, and we are
turning students away," said Wisker
chen, who has recently been forced to
turn down students appealing for grant
money. "They're going to do some
thing else, and it probably won't be as
good for the country."
The graduate student's dilemma
For graduate students, the funding
struggle, combined with the threat that
their experiments may never fly on the
shuttle, presents a particularly difficult
dilemma. In many cases, dissertation
work depends on NASA support and
shuttle space for its very existence.
Those like Bennett say funding is so
hard to come by and dissertation work
so precarious that many space science
graduate students are turning to the
private aerospace industry, other
countries or other fields altogether.
"It's a painful choice," said Vic
Aguerro, an aeronautics and
astronautics graduate student, who
said he will stick with a career in space
science if he can "gut it out" and finish
his research.
"People are having to compromise
their goals," Aguerro said. "What's hap
pening is that people are losing the
chance to get experience at the univer
sity level and are having to get it in in
dustry."
Aguerro, the project manager of a
team of 25 students designing a small
satellite scheduled to fly on the shuttle

in October 1991, has put his project on
half-budget in an effort to stretch his
funding through December. After the
end of that month, Aguerro said,
"everything is on hold. His goal, he
said, is to find funding for at least half
of his team.
"If times were normal, NASA would
have grabbed onto this and let the stu
dents carry' it through," Wiskerchen
said of Aguerro's project.
Instead of funding such programs
now, Wiskerchen said, NASA is asking
scientists to stretch their money until
the space agency is reorganized and
caught up with its scheduled payloads.
But, he added, graduate students not
only become frustrated by having to
wait, they also simply cannot hang on
for very long.
"People signed on to experiments
last year, and then they found out they
had a three-year delay," Wiskerchen
said. "A graduate student has to com
plete a dissertation in four years, so the
question becomes: Can you involve a
graduate student in a program that
takes more than four or five years?"
If NASA cannot at least support some
graduate school space research proj
ects, the agency cannot expect the sci
entists to still be available in the
decades to come, researchers say. "Did
you ever try to mothball a scientist?"
Wiskerchen asked. "If you force them
to stick around, they come at you with
hammers."
Bennett put it more simply: "By the
time we do get the funding, there may
not be anyone here to receive it."
Choices on existing programs
Many remedies have been suggested
for problems in space science.
Some say NASA should abandon
some of the more costly long-term
projects, like the $1.1 billion Hubble
Space Telescope, which was supposed
to have been launched this fall and
soon supplying valuable new data to
scientists. The telescope alone is cos
ting NASA an estimated $3 million per
month to maintain on the ground
during a two-year delay.
Other overdue projects, such as an
ultraviolet telescope designed to ex
amine Hal ley's Comet and probes to
the sun and Jupiter, are costing NASA
billions of dollars to maintain on the
ground and are diverting money from
new research. NASA officials say

postponements of such missions will
average three to five years.
Walker said the information to be
gained from these missions will be just
as interesting in 10 years, but that the
question remains whether NASA
should now divert its scarce resources
to new projects.
One mission, the Galileo planetary'
probe, was originally scheduled for
launch in 1982. It was postponed until
1984, then 1985 and finally, before the
Challenger accident, to August 1986.
Since the accident, however, NASA has
decided Galileo is too dangerous to
carry aboard the shuttle because of the
fuel the probe carries. The space
agency now plans to launch Galileo by
another means sometime in 1992.
To Wiskerchen, part of the answer to
NASA's problem is speed. "Quick is
beautiful," he said, encouraging NASA
to carry out only those projects that can
be designed, built and launched
quickly and on schedule. "If you can't
do it in a three- to four-year time span,
don't do it,"he said. "You lose sight

after a while of why you wanted to do it
in the first place."
Other researchers argue that NASA
should turn its attention to unmanned
missions, but Wiskerchen said the U.S.
space program would not survive in
Congress without the political appeal
of putting people in space.
The problem with manned shuttle
missions is simply "that the shuttle was
done wrong from a space science
point of view," Wiskerchen said. "It
shouldn't have been built on a bare
bones budget. Almost everything was
done with a lowest-cost item."
Along with placing a premium on
speed of new projects and continuing
with the shuttle, Wiskerchen said NASA
should make sure it gets the most for
its money. In past launches, much of
the data collected has been wasted be
cause NASA has not sufficiently funded
data analysis during and after missions
of the space shuttle and other probes.
The $750 million Voyager planetary
probe program included only a $10
million budget for analysis of the

reams of new information that the mis
sion has provided. Calling Voyager
"the most successful planetary mis
sion," Wiskerchen said the program
should have set aside at least $75 mil
lion for data analysis, 10 percent of the
overall cost. After some of Voyager's
work was carried out, NASA unsucess
fully appealed to Congress for more
money for analysis.
"We can't provide in this country
enough money to support grad stu
dents and others just to look at data,"
Wiskerchen said. "We all forget what's
important — where the money should
go. Why not take the millions (spent on
delayed projects) and put it toward the
support of the basic scientific commu
nity, rather than treading water?"
A future in doubt

search by whatever possible —
even if ii meanc »hroT/ing their projects
further behind schedule — and hope
that NASA will reorganize and resume
distributing money soon.
"We're going to gut it out," Aguerro
said, "because we know space science
will continue. The only question is
how long we will have to gut it out."
Those who have already embarked
on a career in space science are likely
to hold on, even if their goals com
promised, but the current funding
problems may turn away from the field
many people now choosing what area
to go into, scientists say.
Some researchers express guarded
optimism that the NASA standstill
could give the space agency a valuable
chance to re-evaluate its agenda and
improve its entire operation. But the
waiting game continues.
"Right now, the attitude in space sci
ence is: "Good luck, buddy. If you've
got a job, you're luck)','" Aguerro said.
"There's not going to be much of a
work force in five to 10 years."

offices.
The first thing NASA must decide
before it resumes launching the shuttle

is exactly what the program's priorities
are, according to Applied Physics I rof.
Arthur Walker, who earlier this year
served on President Reagan's commis
sion that sought to find the cause of the
Challenger accident and make recom
mendations for improvements. NASA is
caught between too many competing
demands, Walker said, citing classified
Department of Defense payloads, com
mercial satellite programs and purely
scientific experiments as the three in
terests asking too much of the shuttle
program.
The pressure on NASA became still
more intense when some U.S. re
searchers began predicting that other
nations, particularly the Soviet Union
and Japan, are overtaking the U.S. pro
gram while NASA devoted all its atten
tion to finding the source of the
Challenger accident and gave lower
priority to basic space research,
"The country really needs a vigorous
space research program, and we are
turning students away," said Wisker
chen, who has recently been forced to
turn down students appealing for grant
money. "They're going to do some
thing else, and it probably won't be as
good for the country."
The graduate student's dilemma
For graduate students, the funding
struggle, combined with the threat that
their experiments may never fly on the
shuttle, presents a particularly difficult
dilemma. In many cases, dissertation
work depends on NASA support and
shuttle space for its very existence.
Those like Bennett say funding is so
hard to come by and dissertation work
so precarious that many space science
graduate students are turning to the
private aerospace industry, other
countries or other fields altogether.
"It's a painful choice," said Vic
Aguerro, an aeronautics and
astronautics graduate student, who
said he will stick with a career in space
science if he can "gut it out" and finish
his research.
"People are having to compromise
their goals," Aguerro said. "What's hap
pening is that people are losing the
chance to get experience at the univer
sity level and are having to get it in in
dustry."
Aguerro, the project manager of a
team of 25 students designing a small
satellite scheduled to fly on the shuttle

in October 1991, has put his project on
half-budget in an effort to stretch his
funding through December. After the
end of that month, Aguerro said,
"everything is on hold. His goal, he
said, is to find funding for at least half
of his team.
"If times were normal, NASA would
have grabbed onto this and let the stu
dents carry' it through," Wiskerchen
said of Aguerro's project.
Instead of funding such programs
now, Wiskerchen said, NASA is asking
scientists to stretch their money until
the space agency is reorganized and
caught up with its scheduled payloads.
But, he added, graduate students not
only become frustrated by having to
wait, they also simply cannot hang on
for very long.
"People signed on to experiments
last year, and then they found out they
had a three-year delay," Wiskerchen
said. "A graduate student has to com
plete a dissertation in four years, so the
question becomes: Can you involve a
graduate student in a program that
takes more than four or five years?"
If NASA cannot at least support some
graduate school space research proj
ects, the agency cannot expect the sci
entists to still be available in the
decades to come, researchers say. "Did
you ever try to mothball a scientist?"
Wiskerchen asked. "If you force them
to stick around, they come at you with
hammers."
Bennett put it more simply: "By the
time we do get the funding, there may
not be anyone here to receive it."
Choices on existing programs
Many remedies have been suggested
for problems in space science.
Some say NASA should abandon
some of the more costly long-term
projects, like the $1.1 billion Hubble
Space Telescope, which was supposed
to have been launched this fall and
soon supplying valuable new data to
scientists. The telescope alone is cos
ting NASA an estimated $3 million per
month to maintain on the ground
during a two-year delay.
Other overdue projects, such as an
ultraviolet telescope designed to ex
amine Hal ley's Comet and probes to
the sun and Jupiter, are costing NASA
billions of dollars to maintain on the
ground and are diverting money from
new research. NASA officials say

postponements of such missions will
average three to five years.
Walker said the information to be
gained from these missions will be just
as interesting in 10 years, but that the
question remains whether NASA
should now divert its scarce resources
to new projects.
One mission, the Galileo planetary'
probe, was originally scheduled for
launch in 1982. It was postponed until
1984, then 1985 and finally, before the
Challenger accident, to August 1986.
Since the accident, however, NASA has
decided Galileo is too dangerous to
carry aboard the shuttle because of the
fuel the probe carries. The space
agency now plans to launch Galileo by
another means sometime in 1992.
To Wiskerchen, part of the answer to
NASA's problem is speed. "Quick is
beautiful," he said, encouraging NASA
to carry out only those projects that can
be designed, built and launched
quickly and on schedule. "If you can't
do it in a three- to four-year time span,
don't do it,"he said. "You lose sight

after a while of why you wanted to do it
in the first place."
Other researchers argue that NASA
should turn its attention to unmanned
missions, but Wiskerchen said the U.S.
space program would not survive in
Congress without the political appeal
of putting people in space.
The problem with manned shuttle
missions is simply "that the shuttle was
done wrong from a space science
point of view," Wiskerchen said. "It
shouldn't have been built on a bare
bones budget. Almost everything was
done with a lowest-cost item."
Along with placing a premium on
speed of new projects and continuing
with the shuttle, Wiskerchen said NASA
should make sure it gets the most for
its money. In past launches, much of
the data collected has been wasted be
cause NASA has not sufficiently funded
data analysis during and after missions
of the space shuttle and other probes.
The $750 million Voyager planetary
probe program included only a $10
million budget for analysis of the

reams of new information that the mis
sion has provided. Calling Voyager
"the most successful planetary mis
sion," Wiskerchen said the program
should have set aside at least $75 mil
lion for data analysis, 10 percent of the
overall cost. After some of Voyager's
work was carried out, NASA unsucess
fully appealed to Congress for more
money for analysis.
"We can't provide in this country
enough money to support grad stu
dents and others just to look at data,"
Wiskerchen said. "We all forget what's
important — where the money should
go. Why not take the millions (spent on
delayed projects) and put it toward the
support of the basic scientific commu
nity, rather than treading water?"
A future in doubt
Bennett and Aguerro will try to out
last the current NASA funding drought.
They say they will continue their re

space communications.
search by whatever possible —
even if ii meanc »hroT/ing their projects
further behind schedule — and hope
that NASA will reorganize and resume
distributing money soon.
"We're going to gut it out," Aguerro
said, "because we know space science
will continue. The only question is
how long we will have to gut it out."
Those who have already embarked
on a career in space science are likely
to hold on, even if their goals com
promised, but the current funding
problems may turn away from the field
many people now choosing what area
to go into, scientists say.
Some researchers express guarded
optimism that the NASA standstill
could give the space agency a valuable
chance to re-evaluate its agenda and
improve its entire operation. But the
waiting game continues.
"Right now, the attitude in space sci
ence is: "Good luck, buddy. If you've
got a job, you're luck)','" Aguerro said.
"There's not going to be much of a
work force in five to 10 years."
One year ago, Elliot Bennett owned a gov
ernment grant he thought would last until his
research in astronautical communication was
completed and his experiment had flown
aboard the space shuttle.
But in June this year, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration told Ben
nett, a graduate student in astronautics and
aeronautics here, that his funding had been ter
minated and that no more money was likely to
come his way in the near future.
Faced with the prospect of having to aban

don his research and his engineer's degree
only nine months away from their completion,
Bennett appealed to private aerospace firms in
the United States and Europe for sponsorship.
The best he could find was a job offer from a
German aerospace company and a Stanford re
search assistant position that would pay his tui
tion.
"It was a real predicament," Bennett said. "1
had to decide whether to bag the whole degree
or shell out the money personally. I was lucky
the research assistantship came through, but it's
really sad I had to go to the German govern
ment to support my work."
Other space researchers here and across the

country have not been so lucky in the struggle
to keep their work alive despite serious NASA
funding cutbacks in space research. The space
agency that once actively supported scientific
research at institutions like Stanford has come
to a standstill since the explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger last January, and researchers
like Bennett are paying the price.
Stanford still ranks first among the nation's
research institutions with about $270 million in
NASA funds allocated this year, but, since the
shuttle explosion and the resulting confusion at
NASA, little of the money has been distributed.
"And if it's not going to us, it's not going
anywhere," Bennett said.

The problem, though, is much more far
reaching than individual funding, researchers
say. If NASA cannot regain the morale it lost in
the Challenger accident, catch up with its
shuttle launch schedule and restore funding to
U.S. space research projects, there may not be a
next generation of space scientists in the United
States.
NASA's new leadership has yet to indicate
what position it will take on support of basic
scientific research, but scientists hope the fund
ing and opportunities will return.
"We've got to divert a whole lot of money to
support the scientific infrastructure," said Mi
chael Wiskerchen, a senior research associate at

the Stanford Electronics Lab. "Otherwise, when
they fly, they'll find out they don't have a scien
tific community."
From bad to worse
Before the space shuttle explosion, NASA's
Office of Space Science was already years be
hind schedule and increasingly reluctant to
provide grants for new projects. But when the
Challenger exploded 74 seconds after lift-off on
Jan. 30, killing all seven crew members and
destroying the $1.2 billion spacecraft, the prob-
lems multiplied exponentially.
The shuttle program will resume
regular launches in 1988 at the earliest,
after engineers redesign the faulty
rocket-boosters that led to the explo
sion. But while engineers rework the
shuttle, NASA is forcing scientists, who
compete heavily for grants and shuttle
space for their experiments during the
best of times, to play a waiting game.
"It's a big struggle for NASA," said
Wiskerchen, who worked as a NASA
scientist for six-and-a-half years. "NASA
continues to be in the treading-water
mode. Now (since the Challenger acci
dent), it has only gotten worse. Now,
you have definite treading water for at
least three years."
On paper, the money is still there.
NASA has steadily increased its funding
of university research over the last 10
years. The agency gave $177.3 million
to universities in 1980, $255 million in
1985 and an estimated $270 million
this year, according to Frank Owens,
deputy director of NASA's Education
Affairs Division. Stanford ranked first
in NASA funding for fiscal 1985, receiv
ing $17.18 million or 4.7 percent of all
NASA money given to U.S. universities,
Owens said. In reality, however, only a
fraction of the money is getting
through to the researchers.
The funding cutbacks result in part
from NASA's reluctance to spend
money developing yet more projects
that would increase an already over
whelming backlog of experiments de
signed to fly on the shuttle several
years ago, but the cuts have been ag
gravated by the internal struggles and
leadership purges at NASA.
"Because of the internal confusion,
they're very hesitant to make decisions
at NASA," Bennett said. "Nobody there
is willing to put his name on the dotted
line. It's taking incredible effort on our
part to get anything through."
Since the Challenger accident, the
directors of NASA, the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and the
Marshall Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., have retired, along with much of
the middle management at all three
offices.
The first thing NASA must decide

Since the accident, however, NASA has
decided Galileo is too dangerous to
carry aboard the shuttle because of the
fuel the probe carries. The space
agency now plans to launch Galileo by
another means sometime in 1992.
To Wiskerchen, part of the answer to
NASA's problem is speed. "Quick is
beautiful," he said, encouraging NASA
to carry out only those projects that can
be designed, built and launched
quickly and on schedule. "If you can't
do it in a three- to four-year time span,
don't do it,"he said. "You lose sight

after a while of why you wanted to do it
in the first place."
Other researchers argue that NASA
should turn its attention to unmanned
missions, but Wiskerchen said the U.S.
space program would not survive in
Congress without the political appeal
of putting people in space.
The problem with manned shuttle
missions is simply "that the shuttle was
done wrong from a space science
point of view," Wiskerchen said. "It
shouldn't have been built on a bare
bones budget. Almost everything was
done with a lowest-cost item."
Along with placing a premium on
speed of new projects and continuing
with the shuttle, Wiskerchen said NASA
should make sure it gets the most for
its money. In past launches, much of
the data collected has been wasted be
cause NASA has not sufficiently funded
data analysis during and after missions
of the space shuttle and other probes.
The $750 million Voyager planetary
probe program included only a $10
million budget for analysis of the

reams of new information that the mis
sion has provided. Calling Voyager
"the most successful planetary mis
sion," Wiskerchen said the program
should have set aside at least $75 mil
lion for data analysis, 10 percent of the
overall cost. After some of Voyager's
work was carried out, NASA unsucess
fully appealed to Congress for more
money for analysis.
"We can't provide in this country
enough money to support grad stu
dents and others just to look at data,"
Wiskerchen said. "We all forget what's
important — where the money should
go. Why not take the millions (spent on
delayed projects) and put it toward the
support of the basic scientific commu
nity, rather than treading water?"
A future in doubt

space communications.
search by whatever possible —
even if ii meanc »hroT/ing their projects
further behind schedule — and hope
that NASA will reorganize and resume
distributing money soon.
"We're going to gut it out," Aguerro
said, "because we know space science
will continue. The only question is
how long we will have to gut it out."
Those who have already embarked
on a career in space science are likely
to hold on, even if their goals com
promised, but the current funding
problems may turn away from the field
many people now choosing what area
to go into, scientists say.
Some researchers express guarded
optimism that the NASA standstill
could give the space agency a valuable
chance to re-evaluate its agenda and
improve its entire operation. But the
waiting game continues.
"Right now, the attitude in space sci
ence is: "Good luck, buddy. If you've
got a job, you're luck)','" Aguerro said.
"There's not going to be much of a
work force in five to 10 years."
One year ago, Elliot Bennett owned a gov
ernment grant he thought would last until his
research in astronautical communication was
completed and his experiment had flown
aboard the space shuttle.
But in June this year, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration told Ben
nett, a graduate student in astronautics and
aeronautics here, that his funding had been ter
minated and that no more money was likely to
come his way in the near future.
Faced with the prospect of having to aban

don his research and his engineer's degree
only nine months away from their completion,
Bennett appealed to private aerospace firms in
the United States and Europe for sponsorship.
The best he could find was a job offer from a
German aerospace company and a Stanford re
search assistant position that would pay his tui
tion.
"It was a real predicament," Bennett said. "1
had to decide whether to bag the whole degree
or shell out the money personally. I was lucky
the research assistantship came through, but it's
really sad I had to go to the German govern
ment to support my work."
Other space researchers here and across the

country have not been so lucky in the struggle
to keep their work alive despite serious NASA
funding cutbacks in space research. The space
agency that once actively supported scientific
research at institutions like Stanford has come
to a standstill since the explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger last January, and researchers
like Bennett are paying the price.
Stanford still ranks first among the nation's
research institutions with about $270 million in
NASA funds allocated this year, but, since the
shuttle explosion and the resulting confusion at
NASA, little of the money has been distributed.
"And if it's not going to us, it's not going
anywhere," Bennett said.

The problem, though, is much more far
reaching than individual funding, researchers
say. If NASA cannot regain the morale it lost in
the Challenger accident, catch up with its
shuttle launch schedule and restore funding to
U.S. space research projects, there may not be a
next generation of space scientists in the United
States.
NASA's new leadership has yet to indicate
what position it will take on support of basic
scientific research, but scientists hope the fund
ing and opportunities will return.
"We've got to divert a whole lot of money to
support the scientific infrastructure," said Mi
chael Wiskerchen, a senior research associate at

the Stanford Electronics Lab. "Otherwise, when
they fly, they'll find out they don't have a scien
tific community."
From bad to worse
Before the space shuttle explosion, NASA's
Office of Space Science was already years be
hind schedule and increasingly reluctant to
provide grants for new projects. But when the
Challenger exploded 74 seconds after lift-off on
Jan. 30, killing all seven crew members and
destroying the $1.2 billion spacecraft, the prob-
lems multiplied exponentially.
The shuttle program will resume
regular launches in 1988 at the earliest,
after engineers redesign the faulty
rocket-boosters that led to the explo
sion. But while engineers rework the
shuttle, NASA is forcing scientists, who
compete heavily for grants and shuttle
space for their experiments during the
best of times, to play a waiting game.
"It's a big struggle for NASA," said
Wiskerchen, who worked as a NASA
scientist for six-and-a-half years. "NASA
continues to be in the treading-water
mode. Now (since the Challenger acci
dent), it has only gotten worse. Now,
you have definite treading water for at
least three years."
On paper, the money is still there.
NASA has steadily increased its funding
of university research over the last 10
years. The agency gave $177.3 million
to universities in 1980, $255 million in
1985 and an estimated $270 million
this year, according to Frank Owens,
deputy director of NASA's Education
Affairs Division. Stanford ranked first
in NASA funding for fiscal 1985, receiv
ing $17.18 million or 4.7 percent of all
NASA money given to U.S. universities,
Owens said. In reality, however, only a
fraction of the money is getting
through to the researchers.
The funding cutbacks result in part
from NASA's reluctance to spend
money developing yet more projects
that would increase an already over
whelming backlog of experiments de
signed to fly on the shuttle several
years ago, but the cuts have been ag
gravated by the internal struggles and
leadership purges at NASA.
"Because of the internal confusion,
they're very hesitant to make decisions
at NASA," Bennett said. "Nobody there
is willing to put his name on the dotted
line. It's taking incredible effort on our
part to get anything through."
Since the Challenger accident, the
directors of NASA, the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and the
Marshall Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., have retired, along with much of
the middle management at all three
offices.
The first thing NASA must decide
before it resumes launching the shuttle

is exactly what the program's priorities
are, according to Applied Physics I rof.
Arthur Walker, who earlier this year
served on President Reagan's commis
sion that sought to find the cause of the
Challenger accident and make recom
mendations for improvements. NASA is
caught between too many competing
demands, Walker said, citing classified
Department of Defense payloads, com
mercial satellite programs and purely
scientific experiments as the three in
terests asking too much of the shuttle
program.
The pressure on NASA became still
more intense when some U.S. re
searchers began predicting that other
nations, particularly the Soviet Union
and Japan, are overtaking the U.S. pro
gram while NASA devoted all its atten
tion to finding the source of the
Challenger accident and gave lower
priority to basic space research,
"The country really needs a vigorous
space research program, and we are
turning students away," said Wisker
chen, who has recently been forced to
turn down students appealing for grant
money. "They're going to do some
thing else, and it probably won't be as
good for the country."
The graduate student's dilemma
For graduate students, the funding
struggle, combined with the threat that
their experiments may never fly on the
shuttle, presents a particularly difficult
dilemma. In many cases, dissertation
work depends on NASA support and
shuttle space for its very existence.
Those like Bennett say funding is so
hard to come by and dissertation work
so precarious that many space science
graduate students are turning to the
private aerospace industry, other
countries or other fields altogether.
"It's a painful choice," said Vic
Aguerro, an aeronautics and
astronautics graduate student, who
said he will stick with a career in space
science if he can "gut it out" and finish
his research.
"People are having to compromise
their goals," Aguerro said. "What's hap
pening is that people are losing the
chance to get experience at the univer
sity level and are having to get it in in
dustry."
Aguerro, the project manager of a
team of 25 students designing a small
satellite scheduled to fly on the shuttle

in October 1991, has put his project on
half-budget in an effort to stretch his
funding through December. After the
end of that month, Aguerro said,
"everything is on hold. His goal, he
said, is to find funding for at least half
of his team.
"If times were normal, NASA would
have grabbed onto this and let the stu
dents carry' it through," Wiskerchen
said of Aguerro's project.
Instead of funding such programs
now, Wiskerchen said, NASA is asking
scientists to stretch their money until
the space agency is reorganized and
caught up with its scheduled payloads.
But, he added, graduate students not
only become frustrated by having to
wait, they also simply cannot hang on
for very long.
"People signed on to experiments
last year, and then they found out they
had a three-year delay," Wiskerchen
said. "A graduate student has to com
plete a dissertation in four years, so the
question becomes: Can you involve a
graduate student in a program that
takes more than four or five years?"
If NASA cannot at least support some
graduate school space research proj
ects, the agency cannot expect the sci
entists to still be available in the
decades to come, researchers say. "Did
you ever try to mothball a scientist?"
Wiskerchen asked. "If you force them
to stick around, they come at you with
hammers."
Bennett put it more simply: "By the
time we do get the funding, there may
not be anyone here to receive it."
Choices on existing programs
Many remedies have been suggested
for problems in space science.
Some say NASA should abandon
some of the more costly long-term
projects, like the $1.1 billion Hubble
Space Telescope, which was supposed
to have been launched this fall and
soon supplying valuable new data to
scientists. The telescope alone is cos
ting NASA an estimated $3 million per
month to maintain on the ground
during a two-year delay.
Other overdue projects, such as an
ultraviolet telescope designed to ex
amine Hal ley's Comet and probes to
the sun and Jupiter, are costing NASA
billions of dollars to maintain on the
ground and are diverting money from
new research. NASA officials say

postponements of such missions will
average three to five years.
Walker said the information to be
gained from these missions will be just
as interesting in 10 years, but that the
question remains whether NASA
should now divert its scarce resources
to new projects.
One mission, the Galileo planetary'
probe, was originally scheduled for
launch in 1982. It was postponed until
1984, then 1985 and finally, before the
Challenger accident, to August 1986.
Since the accident, however, NASA has
decided Galileo is too dangerous to
carry aboard the shuttle because of the
fuel the probe carries. The space
agency now plans to launch Galileo by
another means sometime in 1992.

to a standstill since the explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger last January, and researchers
like Bennett are paying the price.
Stanford still ranks first among the nation's
research institutions with about $270 million in
NASA funds allocated this year, but, since the
shuttle explosion and the resulting confusion at
NASA, little of the money has been distributed.
"And if it's not going to us, it's not going
anywhere," Bennett said.

The problem, though, is much more far
reaching than individual funding, researchers
say. If NASA cannot regain the morale it lost in
the Challenger accident, catch up with its
shuttle launch schedule and restore funding to
U.S. space research projects, there may not be a
next generation of space scientists in the United
States.
NASA's new leadership has yet to indicate
what position it will take on support of basic
scientific research, but scientists hope the fund
ing and opportunities will return.
"We've got to divert a whole lot of money to
support the scientific infrastructure," said Mi
chael Wiskerchen, a senior research associate at

the Stanford Electronics Lab. "Otherwise, when
they fly, they'll find out they don't have a scien
tific community."
From bad to worse
Before the space shuttle explosion, NASA's
Office of Space Science was already years be
hind schedule and increasingly reluctant to
provide grants for new projects. But when the
Challenger exploded 74 seconds after lift-off on
Jan. 30, killing all seven crew members and
destroying the $1.2 billion spacecraft, the prob-
lems multiplied exponentially.
The shuttle program will resume
regular launches in 1988 at the earliest,
after engineers redesign the faulty
rocket-boosters that led to the explo
sion. But while engineers rework the
shuttle, NASA is forcing scientists, who
compete heavily for grants and shuttle
space for their experiments during the
best of times, to play a waiting game.
"It's a big struggle for NASA," said
Wiskerchen, who worked as a NASA
scientist for six-and-a-half years. "NASA
continues to be in the treading-water
mode. Now (since the Challenger acci
dent), it has only gotten worse. Now,
you have definite treading water for at
least three years."
On paper, the money is still there.
NASA has steadily increased its funding
of university research over the last 10
years. The agency gave $177.3 million
to universities in 1980, $255 million in
1985 and an estimated $270 million
this year, according to Frank Owens,
deputy director of NASA's Education
Affairs Division. Stanford ranked first
in NASA funding for fiscal 1985, receiv
ing $17.18 million or 4.7 percent of all
NASA money given to U.S. universities,
Owens said. In reality, however, only a
fraction of the money is getting
through to the researchers.
The funding cutbacks result in part
from NASA's reluctance to spend
money developing yet more projects
that would increase an already over
whelming backlog of experiments de
signed to fly on the shuttle several
years ago, but the cuts have been ag
gravated by the internal struggles and
leadership purges at NASA.
"Because of the internal confusion,
they're very hesitant to make decisions
at NASA," Bennett said. "Nobody there
is willing to put his name on the dotted
line. It's taking incredible effort on our
part to get anything through."
Since the Challenger accident, the
directors of NASA, the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and the
Marshall Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., have retired, along with much of
the middle management at all three
offices.
The first thing NASA must decide
before it resumes launching the shuttle

is exactly what the program's priorities
are, according to Applied Physics I rof.
Arthur Walker, who earlier this year
served on President Reagan's commis
sion that sought to find the cause of the
Challenger accident and make recom
mendations for improvements. NASA is
caught between too many competing
demands, Walker said, citing classified
Department of Defense payloads, com
mercial satellite programs and purely
scientific experiments as the three in
terests asking too much of the shuttle
program.
The pressure on NASA became still
more intense when some U.S. re
searchers began predicting that other
nations, particularly the Soviet Union
and Japan, are overtaking the U.S. pro
gram while NASA devoted all its atten
tion to finding the source of the
Challenger accident and gave lower
priority to basic space research,
"The country really needs a vigorous
space research program, and we are
turning students away," said Wisker
chen, who has recently been forced to
turn down students appealing for grant
money. "They're going to do some
thing else, and it probably won't be as
good for the country."
The graduate student's dilemma
For graduate students, the funding
struggle, combined with the threat that
their experiments may never fly on the
shuttle, presents a particularly difficult
dilemma. In many cases, dissertation
work depends on NASA support and
shuttle space for its very existence.
Those like Bennett say funding is so
hard to come by and dissertation work
so precarious that many space science
graduate students are turning to the
private aerospace industry, other
countries or other fields altogether.
"It's a painful choice," said Vic
Aguerro, an aeronautics and
astronautics graduate student, who
said he will stick with a career in space
science if he can "gut it out" and finish
his research.
"People are having to compromise
their goals," Aguerro said. "What's hap
pening is that people are losing the
chance to get experience at the univer
sity level and are having to get it in in
dustry."
Aguerro, the project manager of a
team of 25 students designing a small
satellite scheduled to fly on the shuttle

in October 1991, has put his project on
half-budget in an effort to stretch his
funding through December. After the
end of that month, Aguerro said,
"everything is on hold. His goal, he
said, is to find funding for at least half
of his team.
"If times were normal, NASA would
have grabbed onto this and let the stu
dents carry' it through," Wiskerchen
said of Aguerro's project.
Instead of funding such programs
now, Wiskerchen said, NASA is asking
scientists to stretch their money until
the space agency is reorganized and
caught up with its scheduled payloads.
But, he added, graduate students not
only become frustrated by having to
wait, they also simply cannot hang on
for very long.
"People signed on to experiments
last year, and then they found out they
had a three-year delay," Wiskerchen
said. "A graduate student has to com
plete a dissertation in four years, so the
question becomes: Can you involve a
graduate student in a program that
takes more than four or five years?"
If NASA cannot at least support some
graduate school space research proj
ects, the agency cannot expect the sci
entists to still be available in the
decades to come, researchers say. "Did
you ever try to mothball a scientist?"
Wiskerchen asked. "If you force them
to stick around, they come at you with
hammers."
Bennett put it more simply: "By the
time we do get the funding, there may
not be anyone here to receive it."
Choices on existing programs
Many remedies have been suggested
for problems in space science.
Some say NASA should abandon
some of the more costly long-term
projects, like the $1.1 billion Hubble
Space Telescope, which was supposed
to have been launched this fall and
soon supplying valuable new data to
scientists. The telescope alone is cos
ting NASA an estimated $3 million per
month to maintain on the ground
during a two-year delay.
Other overdue projects, such as an
ultraviolet telescope designed to ex
amine Hal ley's Comet and probes to
the sun and Jupiter, are costing NASA
billions of dollars to maintain on the
ground and are diverting money from
new research. NASA officials say

postponements of such missions will
average three to five years.
Walker said the information to be
gained from these missions will be just
as interesting in 10 years, but that the
question remains whether NASA
should now divert its scarce resources
to new projects.
One mission, the Galileo planetary'
probe, was originally scheduled for
launch in 1982. It was postponed until
1984, then 1985 and finally, before the
Challenger accident, to August 1986.
Since the accident, however, NASA has
decided Galileo is too dangerous to
carry aboard the shuttle because of the
fuel the probe carries. The space
agency now plans to launch Galileo by
another means sometime in 1992.
To Wiskerchen, part of the answer to
NASA's problem is speed. "Quick is
beautiful," he said, encouraging NASA
to carry out only those projects that can
be designed, built and launched
quickly and on schedule. "If you can't
do it in a three- to four-year time span,
don't do it,"he said. "You lose sight

after a while of why you wanted to do it
in the first place."
Other researchers argue that NASA
should turn its attention to unmanned
missions, but Wiskerchen said the U.S.
space program would not survive in
Congress without the political appeal
of putting people in space.
The problem with manned shuttle
missions is simply "that the shuttle was
done wrong from a space science
point of view," Wiskerchen said. "It
shouldn't have been built on a bare
bones budget. Almost everything was
done with a lowest-cost item."
Along with placing a premium on
speed of new projects and continuing
with the shuttle, Wiskerchen said NASA
should make sure it gets the most for
its money. In past launches, much of
the data collected has been wasted be
cause NASA has not sufficiently funded
data analysis during and after missions
of the space shuttle and other probes.
The $750 million Voyager planetary
probe program included only a $10
million budget for analysis of the

reams of new information that the mis
sion has provided. Calling Voyager
"the most successful planetary mis
sion," Wiskerchen said the program
should have set aside at least $75 mil
lion for data analysis, 10 percent of the
overall cost. After some of Voyager's
work was carried out, NASA unsucess
fully appealed to Congress for more
money for analysis.
"We can't provide in this country
enough money to support grad stu
dents and others just to look at data,"
Wiskerchen said. "We all forget what's
important — where the money should
go. Why not take the millions (spent on
delayed projects) and put it toward the
support of the basic scientific commu
nity, rather than treading water?"
A future in doubt

search by whatever possible —
even if ii meanc »hroT/ing their projects
further behind schedule — and hope
that NASA will reorganize and resume
distributing money soon.
"We're going to gut it out," Aguerro
said, "because we know space science
will continue. The only question is
how long we will have to gut it out."
Those who have already embarked
on a career in space science are likely
to hold on, even if their goals com
promised, but the current funding
problems may turn away from the field
many people now choosing what area
to go into, scientists say.
Some researchers express guarded
optimism that the NASA standstill
could give the space agency a valuable
chance to re-evaluate its agenda and
improve its entire operation. But the
waiting game continues.
"Right now, the attitude in space sci
ence is: "Good luck, buddy. If you've
got a job, you're luck)','" Aguerro said.
"There's not going to be much of a
work force in five to 10 years."
