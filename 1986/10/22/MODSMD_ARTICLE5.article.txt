# Space researchers struggle for NASA money
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
One year ago, Elliot Bennett owned a gov
ernment grant he thought would last until his
research in astronautical communication was
completed and his experiment had flown
aboard the space shuttle.
But in June this year, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration told Ben
nett, a graduate student in astronautics and
aeronautics here, that his funding had been ter
minated and that no more money was likely to
come his way in the near future.
Faced with the prospect of having to aban

don his research and his engineer's degree
only nine months away from their completion,
Bennett appealed to private aerospace firms in
the United States and Europe for sponsorship.
The best he could find was a job offer from a
German aerospace company and a Stanford re
search assistant position that would pay his tui
tion.
"It was a real predicament," Bennett said. "1
had to decide whether to bag the whole degree
or shell out the money personally. I was lucky
the research assistantship came through, but it's
really sad I had to go to the German govern
ment to support my work."
Other space researchers here and across the

country have not been so lucky in the struggle
to keep their work alive despite serious NASA
funding cutbacks in space research. The space
agency that once actively supported scientific
research at institutions like Stanford has come
to a standstill since the explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger last January, and researchers
like Bennett are paying the price.
Stanford still ranks first among the nation's
research institutions with about $270 million in
NASA funds allocated this year, but, since the
shuttle explosion and the resulting confusion at
NASA, little of the money has been distributed.
"And if it's not going to us, it's not going
anywhere," Bennett said.

The problem, though, is much more far
reaching than individual funding, researchers
say. If NASA cannot regain the morale it lost in
the Challenger accident, catch up with its
shuttle launch schedule and restore funding to
U.S. space research projects, there may not be a
next generation of space scientists in the United
States.
NASA's new leadership has yet to indicate
what position it will take on support of basic
scientific research, but scientists hope the fund
ing and opportunities will return.
"We've got to divert a whole lot of money to
support the scientific infrastructure," said Mi
chael Wiskerchen, a senior research associate at

the Stanford Electronics Lab. "Otherwise, when
they fly, they'll find out they don't have a scien
tific community."
From bad to worse
Before the space shuttle explosion, NASA's
Office of Space Science was already years be
hind schedule and increasingly reluctant to
provide grants for new projects. But when the
Challenger exploded 74 seconds after lift-off on
Jan. 30, killing all seven crew members and
destroying the $1.2 billion spacecraft, the prob-
