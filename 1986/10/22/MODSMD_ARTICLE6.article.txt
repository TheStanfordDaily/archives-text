# Pledges review dry Rush
## 
### ANDREA ARNOLD 
Members of this year's fraternity pledge
class reviewed the Rush system in a meeting
called by the Interfraternity Council (IFC)
last night.
The meeting, led by IFC President Steve
Singleton and Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano, primarily addressed the serving of
alcohol during Rush, but also dealt with
hazing regulations and the length of Rush.
In addition, the meeting was meant to be a
step toward establishing stronger commu
nications among the fraternities.
Pisano, who favors a dry Rush, said: "I'm
concerned about the people who go
through Rush and get hurt because of the
consumption of alcohol."
According to Pisano, the current Rush
may erroneously show that "the focal point
of their (Rushees) existence is alcohol and
parties." He said he does not believe this is
really true of Rush candidates, but is con
cerned that this may lead to "more alcohol
consumption later in life
Most of the pledges at the meeting
opposed having a dry Rush. One pledge
said that "alcohol loosens people up," al
lowing easier socializing at Rash functions.
Alcohol also attracts more candidates to
choose from, another pledge added.
Others said that a dry Rush would be mis
leading, since fraternities aren't dry during
the rest of the year One pledge asked, "If

you can't see how much each fraternity par
ties, when will you find out — the next year
after you've already pledged?"
Several pledges suggested a compro
mise. One said Rush should be part dry and
part wet. "True, you can't get a good picture
of people when you only see them when
they're drunk," he said.
"The University should allow alcohol at
Rush — we just need to keep a more
focused eye on distribution," added an
other pledge.
In an informal hand survey conducted by
Pisano, most of the pledges indicated that
they would have gone to Rush functions
even if there had been no alcohol. A few
said that they were prompted to go to Rush
functions because of the alcohol.
A more formal, written survey was given
to the pledges. The topics included their
reactions to the structure, length and alco
hol consumption of Rush activities. It also
asked for input on what the pledges would

change about Rush and fraternities in gen
eral.
The length of Rush was also an issue.
"The University thinks such a long Rush
pulls students away from their dorms and
their studies," Singleton said.
One pledge argued that "the University is
condescending in trying to control fresh
men, saying that Rush interferes with their
studies." Others pointed out that they were
able to plan their studies around Rush par
ties, and one said his grades actually im
proved last spring quarter.
On the topic of hazing, Pisano said he is
"vehemently opposed to hazing in all its
forms. Degrading others has no place in fra
ternities." He pointed out that many people
die in hazing incidents throughout rhe
country.
"We're interested in having no one get
hurt. Fraternities are fun — they shouldn't
be dangerous," he said.
