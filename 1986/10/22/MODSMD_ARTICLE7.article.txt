# Stanford profs high in academic citations

### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
Stanford Prof. Seymour Martin Lipset is the
most frequently cited political scientist
nationwide among fellow scholars, according to a
recent study.
"I'm not dishonored," said Lipset, a professor
of both political science and sociology. He also
serves as a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
Based on citations, the study ranks Stanford's
political science department fourth overall, be
hind Harvard, Yale and the University of Michi
gan.
In the field of comparative politics, Lipset led
the study with 1,713 citations.
Lipset expressed some skepticism regarding
his first place ranking. "It's interesting. But no
one study is the way to go," he said.
In addition, Lipset pointed out that because he
teaches both political science and sociology, he
has a better chance of being cited than professors
who teach exclusively in one field.
"The more fields you cover, the more people
cite you," he said.
According to Lipset, a specialist in ancient
China would probably not be cited often because
of the relative narrowness of the field. "You can't
say that person is less good than the people
working on a number of fields.
"Besides, a number of people, regardless of
what they do, get cited," he said.
The study, released this summer by Hans-
Dieter Klingemann of Berlin's Free University, is
based on the number of citations in the Social
Sciences Citation Index for 1981-85.
Besides Lipset, several other Stanford profes
sors were named in the study. Political Science
Prof. James March is ranked third nationally, be
hind Robert A. Dahl of Yale. March, who could

not be reached yesterday, is also a Hoover senior
research fellow and holds the Fred Merrill profes
sorship in the Graduate School of Business.
John Ferejohn, professor of political science,
who was ranked 10th in the field of positive the
ory and political thought with 360 citations, said
he was very flattered to be named in the study.
However, Political Science Prof. Alexander
George, who ranked eighth in the field of interna
tional relations with 423 citations, criticized the
study.
"That's a terrible study. It's a very unscientific,
spuriously objective way of measuring contribu
tions to the field of political science. That's the
bottom line."
George said the study's data contains too many
ambiguities to be considered valid.
"There's no single explanation for why some
one is cited. For example, you can cite someone
because you agree and approve or because you
disagree and disapprove. That's one ambiguity."
Another question left unanswered by the study
is what kind of impact the cited professor has on
the field, George said.
"Your impact on the field may have been harm
ful rather than beneficial. You won't know that
simply from the fact that someone has cited you,"
George said.
People are also sometimes cited simply be
cause they are prestigious, George added.
"A person writing an article may feel that it's
important to be able to show that he (knows) that
a prestigious person in the profession has written
something related," he said. "Younger people ...
often do this."
The University of California at Berkeley is
ranked fifth in Klingemann's study with 5,203 cita
tions; Stanford has 6,352 citations.
According to Lipset, Stanford might
have fared still better than Berkeley if
the study had taken into account the
relative size of the two departments.
Stanford has 25 professors as regular
faculty in its political science depart
ment. Berkeley has about 50, accord
ing to Lipset.
"The Stanford department is
relatively smaller, so we might come
out even better if you look at the cita
tions per capita rather than as a
whole," Lipset said.
Asked how the Political Science De
partment at Stanford could improve,
Lipset said hiring more top professors
would help, particularly in the areas of
Western Europe and systematic politi
cal theory.
Ferejohn added that he would like
to see an increase in the number of
professors concerned with public
policy.
"We have a good reputation. We've
made some very good hires in the last
year and our reputation will probably
reflect that," Ferejohn said.

because you agree and approve or because you
disagree and disapprove. That's one ambiguity."
Another question left unanswered by the study
is what kind of impact the cited professor has on
the field, George said.
"Your impact on the field may have been harm
ful rather than beneficial. You won't know that
simply from the fact that someone has cited you,"
George said.
People are also sometimes cited simply be
cause they are prestigious, George added.
"A person writing an article may feel that it's
important to be able to show that he (knows) that
a prestigious person in the profession has written
something related," he said. "Younger people ...
often do this."
The University of California at Berkeley is
ranked fifth in Klingemann's study with 5,203 cita
tions; Stanford has 6,352 citations.
According to Lipset, Stanford might
have fared still better than Berkeley if
the study had taken into account the
relative size of the two departments.
Stanford has 25 professors as regular
faculty in its political science depart
ment. Berkeley has about 50, accord
ing to Lipset.
"The Stanford department is
relatively smaller, so we might come
out even better if you look at the cita
tions per capita rather than as a
whole," Lipset said.
Asked how the Political Science De
partment at Stanford could improve,
Lipset said hiring more top professors
would help, particularly in the areas of
Western Europe and systematic politi
cal theory.
Ferejohn added that he would like
to see an increase in the number of
professors concerned with public
policy.
"We have a good reputation. We've
made some very good hires in the last
year and our reputation will probably
reflect that," Ferejohn said.
