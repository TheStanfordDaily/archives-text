Heterosexuals may spread AIDS
NEW YORK — Increasing evidence that acquired immune deficiency
syndrome can spread via heterosexual sexual activity was reported yester
day in a symposium on the growing epidemic of the deadly disease.
Spoasored by the Montefiore Medical Center of the Albert Einstein Col
lege of Medicine here, the symposium brought together more than two
dozen epidemiologists, physicians and other researchers to share their fin
dings.
The main question concerned the chance that the virus was being spread
throughout the general population, among persons who are not in any of
the known high-risk groups, such as male homosexuals and drug addicts.
Dr. Thomas Quinn, from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, con
cluded, "Heterosexual transmission exists" and the disease will continue to
be spread beyond the usual high-risk groups.
These are some of the main points covered:
It is sexual activity — heterosexual and homosexual — that spreads the
disease.
It still is not known how easily the AIDS virus is passed from person to
person. But it seems that heterosexual transmission actually requires
repeated, long-term sexual contacts.
In the United States, the disease has still not spread widely beyond the
known risk groups. Only 2 or 3 percent of the known AIDS cases are found
in people who received the virus through heterosexual contacts. (The fig
ure used to be 1 percent.)
U.S. asylum policy questioned
WASHINGTON — A new General Accounting Office study shows that
Central Americans are far more likely to be refused asylum than immi
grants from other countries, even when their claims are similar.
Supporters of asylum for Central Americans cited the report yesterday as
proof that the Reagan administration uses asylum policy as an unfair politi
cal tool, an assertion that the Immigration and Naturalization Service im
mediately disputed.
The report is "very damning to the administration," said James
McGovern, legislative assistant to Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.), who is spon
soring a bill providing temporary asylum for all Central Americans now in
the country, not only those covered under the massive immigration reform
legislation passed by Congress last week.
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who requested the GAO study, said he was
"very troubled" by the findings and vowed to work in the next congres
sional session "to determine the appropriate response to these disturbing
revelations."
In and out of Congress, an intense battle was waged during the last ses
sion on behalf of Central Americans seeking asylum, about 500,000 of
whom are Salvadorans, by far the largest subgroup. The battle will resume
when Congress returns next year, and leaders in both chambers have
promised Moakley that his legislation would be given high priority.
Hasenfus confession repudiated
MANAGUA Nicaragua — The lawyer for Eugene Hasenfus yesterday dis
missed as legally invalid a series of written and oral confessions by the
captured American flier detailing his work in helping deliver supplies to
U.S.-financed, anti-Sandinista rebels.
Enrique Sotelo, a prominent political opponent of the government who
is defending Hasenfiis before a revolutionary tribunal, said his client is
only a "specialized worker" who made his confessions after "constant in
terrogation" by agents of the Interior Ministry's General Directorate of
State Security.
"This obliged him to sign a confession that from the legal standpoint
does not have any value," he declared at a news conference.
By meeting reporters, Sotelo sought to steer public attention in the
United States toward the legal fate of Hasenfus and the judicial character of
the revolutionary tribunal, which has a conviction rate of more than 90 per
cent and is expected to convict Hasenfus.
In so doing, Sotelo was vying with government efforts to focus publicity
instead on involvement by U.S. citizens and the U.S. government in spon
soring the insurgent forces, or contras, that have been waging a guerrilla
war here for almost five years.
Sotelo, national coordinator of the anti-government branch of
Nicaragua's Conservative Party, said he has not yet decided whether to have
Hasenfus plead guilty or not guilty.
Hasenfus, 45, of Marinette, Wis., was formally accused yesterday of ter
rorism, illegal association and violation of Nicaragua's public security laws.
Justice Minister Rodrigo Reyes asked for the maximum penalty of 30 years
in prison for each of the three crimes.
S. Africa blamed for plane crash
HARARE, Zimbabwe — Mobs of blacks rampaged through Harare yester
day in three hours of riots, fires and assaults prompted by the belief that
South Africa played a role in the death of Mozambique's president.
In the worst violence since Zimbabwe became independent six years
ago, they set fire to two foreign airline offices, overturned cars and stoned
missions of South Africa, Malawi and the United States. Malawi is the only
black-ruled African country that has full diplomatic relatioas with South
Africa.
Rioters assaulted scores of shoppers and office workers, most of them
white.
Several mobs involving a total of about 5,000 people surged through the
city's downtown area in what militants said was a protest of alleged South
African involvement in Samora Machel's death in an air crash Sunday just
across the Mozambique border in South Africa.
Police sources said many people were injured and more than 50 demon
strators arrested. They said none of the injuries were serious.
Before police gained control, mobs ordered frightened white men,
women and teen-agers to chant slogans against South Africa. Many who
refused were beaten.
American kidnapped in Beirut
AMMAN, Jordan — An extremist group in Lebanon said yesterday that it
had kidnapped another American in West Beirut.
A statement delivered to news agencies in the Lebanese capital identified
the hostage as Edward Tracy, 55, of Rutland, Vt. Tracy was described as an
illustrator and salesman of the Koran, the Moslem holy book.
The statement, purporting to come from a group calling itself the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, asserted that Tracy had spied in
Lebanon for the CIA and for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.
In Washington, a White House statement said Tracy had no connection
with the U.S. government or the CIA
"We hold Mr. Tracy's kidnappers responsible for his safety and demand
that he be released, White House spokesman Larry Speakes said. "He is an
other innocent victim of terrorism in Lebanon."
The Revolutionary' Justice group did not say when or where Tracy was
kidnapped.
Strike fails in France
PARIS — The major labor unions of France challenged Premier Jacques
Chirac with a strike by public workers yesterday' but failed to gather
enough support to paral\7.e the cities, as they had threatened, or weaken
his conservative government.
The strike hampered public transportation but not enough to close
down the Metro system. More than two-thirds of the subway trains were
running by midday. Parisians usually judge the strength of a strike by how
much it ties up the Metro.
But the French railways reported that only one of its four trains was run
ning. And Air France said it would probably have to cancel 60 percent of its
flights in Europe and to North Africa for the day.
