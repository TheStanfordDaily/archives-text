# U.S. expels Soviet diplomats
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Reagan administration yes
terday ordered 55 Soviet diplomats to leave the
country within nine days, but said it hoped the action
would not sour the prospects for arms control.
Five of the diplomats were declared "persona non
grata" in retaliation for the recent expulsion of five
U.S. diplomats from Moscow. The additional 50 were
ordered out to bring the Soviet embassy staff in
Washington and the consulate staff in San Francisco
"to parity" with the size of the U.S. contingent in Mos
cow and Leningrad.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman an
nounced the massive retaliation with "regrets," but
said it was forced on the administration by the Soviet
Union.
Redman also sought to assure Moscow that the
United States did not want to lose the momentum
achieved at President Reagan's summit meeting in
Iceland with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
"We remain committed to pursuing the dialogue
stemming from the Reykjavik meeting in all areas of
our relationship," he said. "This problem of
espionage is an important one, but it is a separate
problem, and our plan is to go ahead with the
dialogue."
The administration is preparing new arms control
proposals based on the summit meeting to present to
the Soviets in negotiations in Geneva. Also, Secretary
of State George Shultz is due to meet with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Vienna on
Nov. 6.
Under the new ceiling, required by Congress last

year, the Soviets will be permitted to have no more
than 225 people at their embassy in Washington and
no more than 26 at the consulate in San Francisco.
This amounts to a reduction of 54 positions in
Washington and 15 in San Francisco. But with some
of the posts currently unfilled, 38 people will be re
quired to leave the capital and 12 must quit San Fran
cisco.
The five Soviets declared "persona non grata"
were identified as counselors Vasiliy Fedotov, Oleg
Likhachev and Aleksandr Metelkin and attache
Nikolay Kokovin, all at the embassy in Washington,
and Lev Zaytsev, consul in San Francisco.
This matches the number of U.S. diplomats ex
pelled from Moscow for what the Soviets Sunday
called "impermissible activities."
Redman said the five Soviets were singled out be
cause "they are persons we have reason to believe
have engaged in activities inconsistent with their
diplomatic status."
This appeared to be an allegation that they were
involved in espionage activites, but Redman did not
make the charge directly. However, he stressed their
expulsion was caused by "the unjustified action by
the Soviets in expelling five U.S. diplomats in Mos
cow."
In Moscow, Gennady Gerasimov, a spokesman for
the Soviet Foreign Ministry, said "if the United States
will insist on continuing this game of tit-for-tat, then
this can continue indefinitely. We consider it is time
to stop."
The official Soviet news agency Tass, in a Russian

language dispatch datelined Washington, said yester
day that with the expulsion, "the Reagan administra
tion has undertaken the next step aimed at worsen
ing Soviet-American relations."
Congress last year, in an amendment by Sens.
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and William Cohen (R-Maine)
gave the executive branch three years to bring the
diplomatic staffs in the two countries to equality. The
amendment permitted the administration to deter
mine how and when to meet the deadline.
A second amendment by Leahy and Cohen was
passed and signed earlier this month. It requires that
within three years the U.S. and Soviet U.N. missions
be roughly equal.
Twenty-five Soviets who were working at the U.N.
mission in New York were identified as intelligence
agents last month and ordered to leave. The Soviets
responded Sunday with the expulsion of the five
American diplomats.
Usually, the two sides cool down after a round of
expulsions. But the Reagan administration consid
ered kicking out the Soviets in New York a separate
issue. Another 70 will be ordered to leave in three
steps over the next 18 months.
At the White House, presidential spokesman Larry
Speakes said the steps taken by the United States
should not spill over into other areas.
"We would hope it does not interfere with prog
ress made at Iceland and that we can continue to
seek arms control and other agreements with the So
viet Union," Speakes said.
