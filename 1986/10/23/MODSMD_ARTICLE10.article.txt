# South African professor criticizes press restrictions
## 
### DAPHNE EDMUNDSON 
As nations increase pressure to end
apartheid, South Africa's government
creates stronger restrictions on the
media to maintain good standing in the
world, said Dr. Keyan Tomaselli during
a lecture at the Bechtel International
Center yesterday.
Recently, the South African govern
ment has twice declared a state of
emergency, which has severely
restricted the press in reporting how
the military and police suppress
protests in black townships, said
Tomaselli.
Tomaselli, who was speaking as part
of Africa Table program, is a South
African professor of comtemporary
cultural studies who teaches at the Uni
versity of Natal in Durban, South Africa.
He writes books and produces films on
apartheid and is especially concerned
with the disparity between reality and
the news published about the South
African government.
In order to maintain control, the
military has been escalating its activites
since the 1976 uprising of South

African blacks, Tomaselli said.
This is not the picture the South
African government wants to portray,
he said. Instead, the government tries
to present a picture of moderate situa
tions that will improve with time be
cause of white rule, Tomaselli said.
"The government now talks about
the protection of minorities, that
means protecting Afrikaaner privilege.
It talks about democracy, that means
power sharing but maintaining con
trol. It talks about negotiations, but its
recipients will be compelled to act in
accordance with the wishes of the gov
ernment," Tomaselli said.
The current situation, however, has
only escalated, not reduced, since the
1976 uprising, he said.
Using Rhodesia and Namibia, for
merly Southwest Africa, as precedents,
the South African military built up to
counter potential guerrilla warfare, he
said.
Since 1976, South Africa has had
time to prepare its military for any up
heavals, Tomaselli said. As such, it cur
rently has the resources to produce all
necessary weapons internally, he said.

Ultimately, he said, sanctions lead to
self-sufficiency within a nation. Conse
quently, the South African military has
manipulated the political structure in
such a way as to have taken on a life of

its own, according to Tomaselli.
The current strength of the military
essentially allows it to write its own
rules, he said. Acts passed in 1982
severely restrict the freedom of the
press: The Newspapers Amendment
Act says that any newspaper that
publishes at less than four-week inter
vals must deposit 60,000 rand
{$27,000) with the government. Such
legislation when applied by the gov
ernment would eliminate small pro
gressive papers.
Another act allows the government
to prohibit press access to any area
which it wishes to protect from world
exposure.
South Africa's press restrictions
become stricter as world tensions in
crease, Tomaselli said. It is essential for
South Africa to maintain good standing
in order for it to interest international
business, he said.
In order to portray as favorable a
picture as possible, the government
has created its own language of "buzz
words," a system somewhat akin to Or
well's "doublespeak"' in the book
"1984," he said. Essentially, these

words say one thing but mean another.
"Certain buzz words are uttered
repetitively, though with different em
phases in the different media," he said.
"Those given a positive treatment in
elude 'reform' — and I'm putting all of
these in quotes since they've become
part of the South African discourse,
and I don't particularly want to be asso
ciated with them — Reform, free en
terprise, moderate blacks, the West,
civilized standards, total strategy, our
boys on the border, privatization,
Thatcher and Reagan.'
"Thatcher and Reagan have since

been excommunicated by (South
African leader P.W. Botha) as the
enemies That shows you how hysteri
cal they're getting
"Those given a negative treatment
include 'radicals, socialism, the Eastern
Bloc, the United Nations, onslaught
and terrorists,' he said.
"And through continual repetition of
these words, the media present a
unified image of South Africa as a
reasonable and moderate society
having to defend itself against an evil
and malicious plot orchestrated from
the outside."

Since 1976, South Africa has had
time to prepare its military for any up
heavals, Tomaselli said. As such, it cur
rently has the resources to produce all
necessary weapons internally, he said.

Ultimately, he said, sanctions lead to
self-sufficiency within a nation. Conse
quently, the South African military has
manipulated the political structure in
such a way as to have taken on a life of

its own, according to Tomaselli.
The current strength of the military
essentially allows it to write its own
rules, he said. Acts passed in 1982
severely restrict the freedom of the
press: The Newspapers Amendment
Act says that any newspaper that
publishes at less than four-week inter
vals must deposit 60,000 rand
{$27,000) with the government. Such
legislation when applied by the gov
ernment would eliminate small pro
gressive papers.
Another act allows the government
to prohibit press access to any area
which it wishes to protect from world
exposure.
South Africa's press restrictions
become stricter as world tensions in
crease, Tomaselli said. It is essential for
South Africa to maintain good standing
in order for it to interest international
business, he said.
In order to portray as favorable a
picture as possible, the government
has created its own language of "buzz
words," a system somewhat akin to Or
well's "doublespeak"' in the book
"1984," he said. Essentially, these

words say one thing but mean another.
"Certain buzz words are uttered
repetitively, though with different em
phases in the different media," he said.
"Those given a positive treatment in
elude 'reform' — and I'm putting all of
these in quotes since they've become
part of the South African discourse,
and I don't particularly want to be asso
ciated with them — Reform, free en
terprise, moderate blacks, the West,
civilized standards, total strategy, our
boys on the border, privatization,
Thatcher and Reagan.'
"Thatcher and Reagan have since

been excommunicated by (South
African leader P.W. Botha) as the
enemies That shows you how hysteri
cal they're getting
"Those given a negative treatment
include 'radicals, socialism, the Eastern
Bloc, the United Nations, onslaught
and terrorists,' he said.
"And through continual repetition of
these words, the media present a
unified image of South Africa as a
reasonable and moderate society
having to defend itself against an evil
and malicious plot orchestrated from
the outside."
