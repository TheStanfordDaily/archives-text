## An Independent Newspaper Prop. 64 a travesty 
### 
Just as the first tottering steps are being made toward a
cure for AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome),
a new cloud has appeared on the horizon. This cloud is
in the form of Proposition 64, which would turn the
focus of the battle against AIDS toward the patients and
away from the disease itself.
The proposition is based on the assumption that AIDS
can be spread through casual contact, but the only
known ways to contract the disease are through sexual
intercourse with an infected person, use of infected
needles or transfusions of infected blood. Hardly casual.
Because of this misplaced belief in the danger of
casual contact, the proposition calls for the removal of
carriers or suspected carriers from jobs that involve food
handling. It would also bar infected students and teach
ers from schools. In a worst case scenario, these people
could be arbitrarily placed in isolation by local health of
ficials for an indefinite period of time.
At a time when AIDS patients are most in need of care
and comfort in the face of their debilitating and fatal ill
ness, this proposal urges us to ostracize them even fur
ther. Those carrying the virus would no longer be will
ing to come forward for treatment because of the siege
mentality that has developed among those with an irra

tional fear of the disease. Instead of receiving help, they
could receive a pink slip.
Money that would previously have gone toward the
search for a cure for the disease would instead be di
rected toward administration and enforcement of this
"crackdown" on AIDS.
The group supporting 64 is appropriately called
PANIC (Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee) and is
another branch of political extremist Lyndon Laßouche's
shadow empire.
While many are inclined to dispense of the proposi
tion simply on the basis of its connection with Laßouche,
its danger must be recognized. Those who fail to vote
"no" on 64, thinking "that crackpot Laßouche's idea will
never be accepted," may pay for their apathy by seeing
the proposition approved. The full implications of the
proposition are not spelled out on the ballot, which em
phasizes the "fiscal impact" while failing to mention 64's
human impact. This could lead misinformed voters to
vote "yes" on the move to call AIDS a "contagious condi
tion."
In legal terms, the proposition could well be called
vague and overbroad. In human terms, it is simply a
travesty.
