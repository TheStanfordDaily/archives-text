Feminism column
muddled, pointless
and contradictory
The Daily has found yet another
writer to pontificate on subjects about
which he knows nothing. Who is
Charlie Gofen and why does he writes
such nonsense? His column on
feminism at Stanford (Daily, Oct. 21)
is muddled, contradicts itself and has
no point.
I'm not certain what Gofen wants.
Does he want all feminists to identify
themselves? Well, here is one — must
I pin a yellow star over my heart or
shave my head, Mr. Gofen? I'd hate to
believe we are as invisible as you
think. Of course, your column is
blatantly sexist from the start, since it
ignores the fact that men can be (and
many are) feminists too. Perhaps you
would see a few feminists if you took
a closer look or, God forbid, took a
feminist studies course. Even the
worst jargon would be an improve
ment over that sad, watered-down
slop you pass off as a definition of
your concern: "women in America are
often handicapped by an unjust soci
ety—" There are real, specific issues
involved, not merely flabby, all
encompassing abstractions.
If "visible campus feminists" are
"seen as having a radical bent," I'd

like to know who is doing the seeing?
And how does Gofen know what most
Stanford students think? The problems
we face are not due to "radicals"
expressing their views, nor due to any
"cyclical" process, nor due to women
remaining "silent in fear of the
feminist label" (after all, what good
are simple-minded labels?). The prob
lem is that most of us remain silent in
the face of acquaintance rape, sexual
harassment, the absence of a compre
hensive child care system, the dis
crepancies in salary and promotion
based on gender and so on. Finally,
the silence Gofen notices seems to be
less a product of fear than of an
apathy that crosses gender lines. The
tragedy of Stanford is that it is easier
to wake people up with a mindless
racket at 3:20 a.m. on a weekend than
it is to rouse them to action with
well-reasoned arguments on moral
issues.

Coverage unfair
to fraternities
Although the University may have
moved from "a stance of neutrality
towards fraternities to one of aggres
sive support" (Daily, Oct. 20), it seems
that The Daily is not so supportive.
Almost every day a negative front-page
article runs about fraternities, be it

group X on probation, the disbanding
of group Y or the continual rehash of
the same story about an altercation
last spring.
Yet we seldom see any support for
the Greek system. Yes, The Daily did
run one editorial in favor of the Phi
Delts (but isn't this the same paper
that last year came out in favor of
disbanding all fraternities?). I am also
told that an article about the positive
side of fraternities is forthcoming, but
is one token article all we deserve? In
addition to the oft-stated benefits of
brotherhood and increased social
opportunities, many Greek groups
deserve recognition for their partici
pation in community service.
One such example was last Satur
day. Five Greek organizations partici
pated in the Stanford Volunteer Net
work's Reach Out Today program.
However, none were listed in Mon
day's page three story about the event.
I even called The Daily on Saturday
after my fraternity had finished its
project. I was told by an editor that
there would be no story on the Reach
Out Today program in Monday's
edition. Either there is a very serious
lack of communication among The
Daily staff, or The Daily is dead set
against giving fraternities any positive
press.
For the record, the following Greek
groups were involved in Saturday's
Reach Out Today program:
• Kappa Alpha Psi — Did restoration

work at the Children's Health Couun
cil.
• Kappa Kappa Gamma — Hosted a
brunch at the Sun Porch Group
Home.
• Kappa Sigma — Painted and
waterproofed an adult center and
playground at the Community Associa
tion for the Retarded.
• Phi Delta Theta — Did yard work at
Little House.
• Sigma Alpha Epsilon — Did restora
tion work at the Stanford Children's
Hospital and the Ronald McDonald
House.
Many people may try to write
off Reach Out as a token gesture by
fraternities; however, my house put in
nearly 150 man-hours and used some
70 gallons of paint, stain and water
seal. I'm sure other fraternities put out
a similar amount of work for the
benefit of the community.
One final beef I have with the
editors of The Daily is the use of the
term "frat." Many people don't see
anything wrong with the word, but
most fraternity members find it dis
respectful, if not derogatory. The Daily
almost always uses "frat" rather than
"fraternity" in its headlines, even
when there is space to spell the whole
word. If the editors didn't realize that
we find this term offensive, I'm
surprised, and hope now that they
have been told, they will try to get out
of the habit of using it.

themselves? Well, here is one — must
I pin a yellow star over my heart or
shave my head, Mr. Gofen? I'd hate to
believe we are as invisible as you
think. Of course, your column is
blatantly sexist from the start, since it
ignores the fact that men can be (and
many are) feminists too. Perhaps you
would see a few feminists if you took
a closer look or, God forbid, took a
feminist studies course. Even the
worst jargon would be an improve
ment over that sad, watered-down
slop you pass off as a definition of
your concern: "women in America are
often handicapped by an unjust soci
ety—" There are real, specific issues
involved, not merely flabby, all
encompassing abstractions.
If "visible campus feminists" are
"seen as having a radical bent," I'd

like to know who is doing the seeing?
And how does Gofen know what most
Stanford students think? The problems
we face are not due to "radicals"
expressing their views, nor due to any
"cyclical" process, nor due to women
remaining "silent in fear of the
feminist label" (after all, what good
are simple-minded labels?). The prob
lem is that most of us remain silent in
the face of acquaintance rape, sexual
harassment, the absence of a compre
hensive child care system, the dis
crepancies in salary and promotion
based on gender and so on. Finally,
the silence Gofen notices seems to be
less a product of fear than of an
apathy that crosses gender lines. The
tragedy of Stanford is that it is easier
to wake people up with a mindless
racket at 3:20 a.m. on a weekend than
it is to rouse them to action with
well-reasoned arguments on moral
issues.

Coverage unfair
to fraternities
Although the University may have
moved from "a stance of neutrality
towards fraternities to one of aggres
sive support" (Daily, Oct. 20), it seems
that The Daily is not so supportive.
Almost every day a negative front-page
article runs about fraternities, be it

group X on probation, the disbanding
of group Y or the continual rehash of
the same story about an altercation
last spring.
Yet we seldom see any support for
the Greek system. Yes, The Daily did
run one editorial in favor of the Phi
Delts (but isn't this the same paper
that last year came out in favor of
disbanding all fraternities?). I am also
told that an article about the positive
side of fraternities is forthcoming, but
is one token article all we deserve? In
addition to the oft-stated benefits of
brotherhood and increased social
opportunities, many Greek groups
deserve recognition for their partici
pation in community service.
One such example was last Satur
day. Five Greek organizations partici
pated in the Stanford Volunteer Net
work's Reach Out Today program.
However, none were listed in Mon
day's page three story about the event.
I even called The Daily on Saturday
after my fraternity had finished its
project. I was told by an editor that
there would be no story on the Reach
Out Today program in Monday's
edition. Either there is a very serious
lack of communication among The
Daily staff, or The Daily is dead set
against giving fraternities any positive
press.
For the record, the following Greek
groups were involved in Saturday's
Reach Out Today program:
• Kappa Alpha Psi — Did restoration

work at the Children's Health Couun
cil.
• Kappa Kappa Gamma — Hosted a
brunch at the Sun Porch Group
Home.
• Kappa Sigma — Painted and
waterproofed an adult center and
playground at the Community Associa
tion for the Retarded.
• Phi Delta Theta — Did yard work at
Little House.
• Sigma Alpha Epsilon — Did restora
tion work at the Stanford Children's
Hospital and the Ronald McDonald
House.
Many people may try to write
off Reach Out as a token gesture by
fraternities; however, my house put in
nearly 150 man-hours and used some
70 gallons of paint, stain and water
seal. I'm sure other fraternities put out
a similar amount of work for the
benefit of the community.
One final beef I have with the
editors of The Daily is the use of the
term "frat." Many people don't see
anything wrong with the word, but
most fraternity members find it dis
respectful, if not derogatory. The Daily
almost always uses "frat" rather than
"fraternity" in its headlines, even
when there is space to spell the whole
word. If the editors didn't realize that
we find this term offensive, I'm
surprised, and hope now that they
have been told, they will try to get out
of the habit of using it.

Feminism column
muddled, pointless
and contradictory
The Daily has found yet another
writer to pontificate on subjects about
which he knows nothing. Who is
Charlie Gofen and why does he writes
such nonsense? His column on
feminism at Stanford (Daily, Oct. 21)
is muddled, contradicts itself and has
no point.
I'm not certain what Gofen wants.
Does he want all feminists to identify
themselves? Well, here is one — must
