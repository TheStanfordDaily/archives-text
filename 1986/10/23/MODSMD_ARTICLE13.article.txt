# Sensitivity can erase homophobia
## 
### 
Homophobia is alive and well on the Stanford
campus. This, of course, comes as no surprise to
anyone. Unlike racism or sexism, which still exist but
have become much more internalized because of the
social taboo of saying a racist or sexist remark, preju
dice against homosexuals is still considered socially
acceptable — even hip or cool. It is interesting to
note the different reactions to homosexuality from
heterosexual men and women. As a man, I cannot
claim to fully understand a heterosexual woman's in
ternal response to homosexuality, but I have done
enough research and witnessed enough incidents to
realize that men deal with homosexuality in a much
more violent, verbal and unsympathetic way than
women do.

Heterosexual men clearly feel that they have much
to lose in dealing with homosexuality, while hetero
sexual women perhaps realize that there can be
much to gain. For instance, a woman who accepts
homosexuality is at last able to have a relationship
with a male in which she does not always have to
think about the sexual overtones, which could poten
tially lead to a greater understanding of herself as a
woman. Most men, it seems, have very little desire to
get to know a woman on any terms but sexual — we
have no need to fulfill our more "feminine" side,
perhaps for fear of losing our masculine edge.
Indeed, as products of our society — a society
based on the Puritan notion that homosexuality is
very wrong (in many cultures today, as in the past,
homosexuality is thought of as normal) — we have
all had to deal with our homophobia. It's there, more
or less, in all of us — as are sexism and racism — and
we must look deeply into ourselves, into our hearts
of darkness, to pinpoint why we feel these things.
When I first came to Stanford, I was extremely ho
mophobic. I had never dealt with homosexuals, ex
cept as they were portrayed in the media and by my
friends. To this day I still harbor feelings that might
be labeled homophobic. I am still threatened when I
see men acting in ways that I have been taught were
not masculine What I continually have to ask myself
is why I view what a mart may be doing as not mascu
line Men act so differently in so many different
cultures that our society's definition of masculinity - is
very limiting

But what I would like to get back to is the intense
difference between the way heterosexual men and
women come to terms with homosexuality. When
we, as men, so vocally and violently refuse to deal
with homosexuality, we are acknowledging our main
weaknesses as males. And this does not mean simply
that we are "uncomfortable with our sexuality."
That's bull. The problem is that we are much too
comfortable with our sexuality, or better stated, with
our position of control in sexual relationships.
Think about it: In acknowledging our fear that a
homosexual will put a move on us — even if we have
let him know we are not interested — we are ack
nowledging the fear that we have imposed upon
women throughout history.
We have been dishing it out to women for so long,
trying to use every trick in the book to get them
sexually invovled with us, and now the tables are
turned. Now we can begin to understand how it must
feel to be a woman in our society. No wonder we are
so paranoid about homosexuality. We are no longer
in control. We have become the object and are no
longer the objectifier.
Scary feeling, huh? Perhaps now we can begin to
understand why there are feminists.
To make a bolder statement, a man who is deathly
afraid of being the object of a homosexual's advance
is, in part, unfairly equating his mentality with the
mentality of the homosexual male, and he is thus
forced to come to terms with the part in many of us
that is capable of rape. "Rape" is a strong and offen
sive word to use, but at least two-thirds of all rapes
are acquaintance rapes, and the majority of rapes that
occur on the Stanford campus are "date rapes."
Now, of course, there are many other variables in
volved in discussing the male response to
homosexuality. One worth noting is that of compas
sion, which very few men — at least those that have
never felt oppression — have ever tried to develop.
We have always been told we are in the right — we
have never felt what it is like to feel alienated be
cause of our beliefs or skin color or sexual prefer
ence — and until we do, it will be fairly easy for us to
continue to condemn others who are not like our
selves.
Therefore, in dealing with rape, in dealing with in
tense forms of homophobia, we are dealing with a
"masculine" mindset. The problem, as any feminist
will tell you, is that most men have no desire to
relearn their mindsets because they don't think they
have anything to gain from doing so; very few men
can understand how it feels to be publicly
humiliated, shunned, discriminated against or as
saulted How do you fight against it without playing
those same power games?
My first thought is that if these things disturb you,
make wai<es When you hear someone say "faggot,'

call them on it. Let them know it not only bothers
you, but is seriously damaging someone's self
esteem. Of course, the problem here is that most
guys use terms like "faggot" because they are trying
to damage someone's self-esteem. You would have to
be pretty ignorant not to realize what those terms do
to people, and since I'm sure very few of us are that
ignorant, that instead means we are very a cruel and
heartless bunch. And never, never think that a ran
dom joke (like a random calandar) is harmless. It is
very hard to understand that all exists on a con
tinuum, and things build and build until something
horrible wakes everyone up. For example, there are
many people who will not be affected at all by sexist
jokes, who are able to "handle" it and deal humanely
with society. However, when society gives its OK to
something like that, there are always going to be a
number of people who are going to feel correct in
taking it a step further now that such behavior is
"OK."
Make waves. I have learned, especially since
writing my last column, that there are worse things
than alienating a few. Women, homosexuals, blacks,
any "minority" (strange word to use when women
are actually the majority) that has tried to participate
in this society has been alienated and hurt and lim
ited to a greater degree than anyone offended by
what I have written. As Robin Morgan said last week
on campus, "Stand by your just rage and don't
apologize for it anymore."
This rage is valid because it comes from love (the
cynics in the audience cringe once again as I use
such an overused and underdefined word). I respect
the world enough that I realize it needs change —
profound change. Our concerns as a society would
be much different right now if the people who have
been through the oppresion and forced to develop
their every ounce of compassion were in control.
Unfortunately, the burden of this change is on
men, and it is going to take more than rage and con
frontation to make change. It is perhaps the most
frustrating of human questions: How can we con
vince those who have the power to give up of some
of that power to make the world a better place for all?
So here I sit, silent. As the burden of racism is on
whites, the burden of sexism is on men, the burden
of homophobia is on heterosexuals, so we must un
learn our beliefs. All I can say is that we are missing
out on a lot of potentially different and rewarding
relationships for the sake of the comfort of conform
ity. We are damaging and hurting and killing other
human beings every day by our mindless acceptance
of the way things are; we are potentially killing our
selves. If nothing else, we must save our own lives.

tially lead to a greater understanding of herself as a
woman. Most men, it seems, have very little desire to
get to know a woman on any terms but sexual — we
have no need to fulfill our more "feminine" side,
perhaps for fear of losing our masculine edge.
Indeed, as products of our society — a society
based on the Puritan notion that homosexuality is
very wrong (in many cultures today, as in the past,
homosexuality is thought of as normal) — we have
all had to deal with our homophobia. It's there, more
or less, in all of us — as are sexism and racism — and
we must look deeply into ourselves, into our hearts
of darkness, to pinpoint why we feel these things.
When I first came to Stanford, I was extremely ho
mophobic. I had never dealt with homosexuals, ex
cept as they were portrayed in the media and by my
friends. To this day I still harbor feelings that might
be labeled homophobic. I am still threatened when I
see men acting in ways that I have been taught were
not masculine What I continually have to ask myself
is why I view what a mart may be doing as not mascu
line Men act so differently in so many different
cultures that our society's definition of masculinity - is
very limiting

But what I would like to get back to is the intense
difference between the way heterosexual men and
women come to terms with homosexuality. When
we, as men, so vocally and violently refuse to deal
with homosexuality, we are acknowledging our main
weaknesses as males. And this does not mean simply
that we are "uncomfortable with our sexuality."
That's bull. The problem is that we are much too
comfortable with our sexuality, or better stated, with
our position of control in sexual relationships.
Think about it: In acknowledging our fear that a
homosexual will put a move on us — even if we have
let him know we are not interested — we are ack
nowledging the fear that we have imposed upon
women throughout history.
We have been dishing it out to women for so long,
trying to use every trick in the book to get them
sexually invovled with us, and now the tables are
turned. Now we can begin to understand how it must
feel to be a woman in our society. No wonder we are
so paranoid about homosexuality. We are no longer
in control. We have become the object and are no
longer the objectifier.
Scary feeling, huh? Perhaps now we can begin to
understand why there are feminists.
To make a bolder statement, a man who is deathly
afraid of being the object of a homosexual's advance
is, in part, unfairly equating his mentality with the
mentality of the homosexual male, and he is thus
forced to come to terms with the part in many of us
that is capable of rape. "Rape" is a strong and offen
sive word to use, but at least two-thirds of all rapes
are acquaintance rapes, and the majority of rapes that
occur on the Stanford campus are "date rapes."
Now, of course, there are many other variables in
volved in discussing the male response to
homosexuality. One worth noting is that of compas
sion, which very few men — at least those that have
never felt oppression — have ever tried to develop.
We have always been told we are in the right — we
have never felt what it is like to feel alienated be
cause of our beliefs or skin color or sexual prefer
ence — and until we do, it will be fairly easy for us to
continue to condemn others who are not like our
selves.
Therefore, in dealing with rape, in dealing with in
tense forms of homophobia, we are dealing with a
"masculine" mindset. The problem, as any feminist
will tell you, is that most men have no desire to
relearn their mindsets because they don't think they
have anything to gain from doing so; very few men
can understand how it feels to be publicly
humiliated, shunned, discriminated against or as
saulted How do you fight against it without playing
those same power games?
My first thought is that if these things disturb you,
make wai<es When you hear someone say "faggot,'

call them on it. Let them know it not only bothers
you, but is seriously damaging someone's self
esteem. Of course, the problem here is that most
guys use terms like "faggot" because they are trying
to damage someone's self-esteem. You would have to
be pretty ignorant not to realize what those terms do
to people, and since I'm sure very few of us are that
ignorant, that instead means we are very a cruel and
heartless bunch. And never, never think that a ran
dom joke (like a random calandar) is harmless. It is
very hard to understand that all exists on a con
tinuum, and things build and build until something
horrible wakes everyone up. For example, there are
many people who will not be affected at all by sexist
jokes, who are able to "handle" it and deal humanely
with society. However, when society gives its OK to
something like that, there are always going to be a
number of people who are going to feel correct in
taking it a step further now that such behavior is
"OK."
Make waves. I have learned, especially since
writing my last column, that there are worse things
than alienating a few. Women, homosexuals, blacks,
any "minority" (strange word to use when women
are actually the majority) that has tried to participate
in this society has been alienated and hurt and lim
ited to a greater degree than anyone offended by
what I have written. As Robin Morgan said last week
on campus, "Stand by your just rage and don't
apologize for it anymore."
This rage is valid because it comes from love (the
cynics in the audience cringe once again as I use
such an overused and underdefined word). I respect
the world enough that I realize it needs change —
profound change. Our concerns as a society would
be much different right now if the people who have
been through the oppresion and forced to develop
their every ounce of compassion were in control.
Unfortunately, the burden of this change is on
men, and it is going to take more than rage and con
frontation to make change. It is perhaps the most
frustrating of human questions: How can we con
vince those who have the power to give up of some
of that power to make the world a better place for all?
So here I sit, silent. As the burden of racism is on
whites, the burden of sexism is on men, the burden
of homophobia is on heterosexuals, so we must un
learn our beliefs. All I can say is that we are missing
out on a lot of potentially different and rewarding
relationships for the sake of the comfort of conform
ity. We are damaging and hurting and killing other
human beings every day by our mindless acceptance
of the way things are; we are potentially killing our
selves. If nothing else, we must save our own lives.

Homophobia is alive and well on the Stanford
campus. This, of course, comes as no surprise to
anyone. Unlike racism or sexism, which still exist but
have become much more internalized because of the
social taboo of saying a racist or sexist remark, preju
dice against homosexuals is still considered socially
acceptable — even hip or cool. It is interesting to
note the different reactions to homosexuality from
heterosexual men and women. As a man, I cannot
claim to fully understand a heterosexual woman's in
ternal response to homosexuality, but I have done
enough research and witnessed enough incidents to
realize that men deal with homosexuality in a much
more violent, verbal and unsympathetic way than
women do.

Heterosexual men clearly feel that they have much
to lose in dealing with homosexuality, while hetero
sexual women perhaps realize that there can be
much to gain. For instance, a woman who accepts
homosexuality is at last able to have a relationship
with a male in which she does not always have to
think about the sexual overtones, which could poten
tially lead to a greater understanding of herself as a
woman. Most men, it seems, have very little desire to
get to know a woman on any terms but sexual — we
