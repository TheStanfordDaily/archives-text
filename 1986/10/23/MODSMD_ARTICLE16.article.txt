# Learning about the real Vietnam
## 
### 
My story is one of an 18 year old who, like many of Stanford's new undergradu
ates, suddenly found himself many miles from home in an unfamiliar environ
ment. Like many freshmen he was uncertain, probably a bit afraid. No doubt this
anxiety fostered nervous energy, which enabled him to move at any time when
told to, just as freshmen continuously bounce through the odyssey of orientation.
And just like the freshmen, he too, wore a nametag.
Unfortunately, my list of comparisons ends here. This particular 18 year old's
chief concerns were not scoring above the median on the Calculus 41 midterm.
His major objective was to stay alive. His nametag was not strategically located on
the breast pocket of his shirt, but around his neck. The setting was not a vast col
lege campus in the beautiful Bay Area, but a dense jungle in a country called Viet
nam.
His name was Vincent. I'm told they called him Vinny. He was my cousin. I can't
remember him too well; in fact, I doubt I knew who he was when I did see him.
His life came to an end when I was only two years old. In the autumn of 1968 a
mortar shell exploded in front of him, tearing his chest apart. What I do recall is
his picture on my uncle's bureau with the folded flag next to it. Vinny came home
in a box draped with the flag. As a child, I could never quite comprehend why the
flag never went outside. Now I know..

I never really thought too much about Vinny until my first quarter at Stanford.
Here I was, miles from home and on my own. When things got tough I often felt
overwhelmed. Then I realized how good I had it. I was not dodging bullets and
did not have to worry about booby traps. The sound of a neighbor's stereo late at
night was annoying but not nearly as pernicious as the sound of screeching rock
ets overhead.
With only a modicum of knowledge on Vietnam, I enrolled in Prof. Hubert
Marshall's political science course. People claimed that the course was great. Mar
shall's insights into Vietnam proved to be quite helpful in illustrating just how
complex the nature of the United States' involvement in Southeast Asia was. I left
Poli. Sci. 1 with a Band a plethora of unanswered questions. The grim reality was
that my cousin died never really knowing why he was fighting. He went because
he felt that it was the "honorable" thing to do. But was the United States' involve
ment truly "honorable"? Debate rages on. I doubt that a naive 18 year old could
understand the political intricacies of why the United States was fighting a war the
majority of its citizens did not want. Every theory has its pros and cons, but history
does not change. An 18 year old had lost his life before it had a chance to start.
The erection of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. marked the first
time the government paid official tribute to the men and women who lost their
lives in Southeast Asia. As monuments go, the memorial is quite touching. The
names of over 58,000 servicemen are etched into a black wall that gradually sinks
into the ground. When I visited the memorial I experienced a dramatic epiphany.
Many claim that the monument has a type of soothing effect, but for me it was
quite different. For the first time, I reached out and touched my cousin's name.
The wall was cold. I looked around and saw thousands of names around me. It
was then that I was able to realize the sheer extent of the tragedy. I was upset
over a cousin I never knew. Imagine how horrible the pain is for those who lost
spouses, parents and children. I went home feeling angry and a bit sick.
That's my story. Nothing upbeat and not necessarily gripping. If it has been suc
cessful, it has conveyed two messages. The first relates to President Reagan. Al
though Libya, terrorism and the Soviet Union have dominated foreign policy over
the recent months, I hope he can appreciate the magnitude of the tragedy in Viet
nam. Trouble still boils in Central America. I hope the president has the sense to
understand that this nation does not want another war. The second message
relates to those new Stanford students who may feel down and out. The work may
be tough, the food may not be too great and you may feel like a face in the crowd.
But I'd rather be in Wilbur with loud stereos than in a jungle with screeching
missiles.

understand the political intricacies of why the United States was fighting a war the
majority of its citizens did not want. Every theory has its pros and cons, but history
does not change. An 18 year old had lost his life before it had a chance to start.
The erection of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. marked the first
time the government paid official tribute to the men and women who lost their
lives in Southeast Asia. As monuments go, the memorial is quite touching. The
names of over 58,000 servicemen are etched into a black wall that gradually sinks
into the ground. When I visited the memorial I experienced a dramatic epiphany.
Many claim that the monument has a type of soothing effect, but for me it was
quite different. For the first time, I reached out and touched my cousin's name.
The wall was cold. I looked around and saw thousands of names around me. It
was then that I was able to realize the sheer extent of the tragedy. I was upset
over a cousin I never knew. Imagine how horrible the pain is for those who lost
spouses, parents and children. I went home feeling angry and a bit sick.
That's my story. Nothing upbeat and not necessarily gripping. If it has been suc
cessful, it has conveyed two messages. The first relates to President Reagan. Al
though Libya, terrorism and the Soviet Union have dominated foreign policy over
the recent months, I hope he can appreciate the magnitude of the tragedy in Viet
nam. Trouble still boils in Central America. I hope the president has the sense to
understand that this nation does not want another war. The second message
relates to those new Stanford students who may feel down and out. The work may
be tough, the food may not be too great and you may feel like a face in the crowd.
But I'd rather be in Wilbur with loud stereos than in a jungle with screeching
missiles.
