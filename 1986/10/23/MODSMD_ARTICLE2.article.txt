# Student group works for ethnic studies

ASSU representatives of the People's Platform, a coalition
of minority and progressive student organizations at Stan
ford, have launched a campaign to expand undergraduate
ethnic studies and to establish a community service board
within the ASSU.
According to ASSU senator Ben Garcia, who is setting up a
task force on ethnic studies, the University is offering only
two courses on Chicano studies this quarter and nothing in
Asian American and Native American studies.
Stanford claims to educate its students for their future
roles of leadership, Garcia said. However, the University's
method of education is "antithetical to its idealsâ€” It does
not teach people how to be leaders in our diverse, multi
cultural society."
A Chicano studies department, for example, could offer
courses analyzing the labor struggles of Cesar Chavez and
the United Farm Worker's union, Garcia said.
Carolyn Lougee, dean of Undergraduate Studies, agrees
that the programs in ethnic studies need to expand. "I don't
think we do nearly as good a job as we can in multi-cultural
education. That is what the Western Culture issue is about,"
she said.
Lougee urged, however, that critics of Stanford's course
offerings not overlook the current accomplishments of the
ethnic studies program. While Stanford may not have many
courses in ethnic studies, the classes it does offer are of high
quality, Lougee said.
Stanford has developed one of the strongest African-
Afro/American studies (AAAS) programs in the country, and
SWOPSI courses frequently tackle the subject of ethnic
studies, she said.
The AAAS major, however, is the only current undergrad
uate major within the field of ethnic studies.
Lougee credited the presence of an AAAS major to a nu
cleus of black faculty members interested in the field after
civil rights activism in the 19605. While Stanford does not
have a Chicano studies major, the University's location and
large undergraduate population could allow it to become a
"pioneer" in the field, Lougee said.
According to Lougee, a petition for an undergraduate
major in Chicano studies has never been submitted to the
Department of Undergraduate Studies.
Lougee added that there are three prerequisites neces
sary to establish a major in ethnic studies: academic re
sources, student interest and faculty interest. "I think the
scholarship is there," but the level of student and faculty in
terest is a question mark, she said.
A paucity of minority faculty compounds the problem,
l.ougee said. Because there are only four Chicano profes-
