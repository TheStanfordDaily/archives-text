# Student group works for ethnic studies
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
ASSU representatives of the People's Platform, a coalition
of minority and progressive student organizations at Stan
ford, have launched a campaign to expand undergraduate
ethnic studies and to establish a community service board
within the ASSU.
According to ASSU senator Ben Garcia, who is setting up a
task force on ethnic studies, the University is offering only
two courses on Chicano studies this quarter and nothing in
Asian American and Native American studies.
Stanford claims to educate its students for their future
roles of leadership, Garcia said. However, the University's
method of education is "antithetical to its idealsâ€” It does
not teach people how to be leaders in our diverse, multi
cultural society."
A Chicano studies department, for example, could offer
courses analyzing the labor struggles of Cesar Chavez and
the United Farm Worker's union, Garcia said.
Carolyn Lougee, dean of Undergraduate Studies, agrees
that the programs in ethnic studies need to expand. "I don't
think we do nearly as good a job as we can in multi-cultural
education. That is what the Western Culture issue is about,"
she said.
Lougee urged, however, that critics of Stanford's course
offerings not overlook the current accomplishments of the
ethnic studies program. While Stanford may not have many
courses in ethnic studies, the classes it does offer are of high
quality, Lougee said.
Stanford has developed one of the strongest African-
Afro/American studies (AAAS) programs in the country, and
SWOPSI courses frequently tackle the subject of ethnic
studies, she said.
The AAAS major, however, is the only current undergrad
uate major within the field of ethnic studies.
Lougee credited the presence of an AAAS major to a nu
cleus of black faculty members interested in the field after
civil rights activism in the 19605. While Stanford does not
have a Chicano studies major, the University's location and
large undergraduate population could allow it to become a
"pioneer" in the field, Lougee said.
According to Lougee, a petition for an undergraduate
major in Chicano studies has never been submitted to the
Department of Undergraduate Studies.
Lougee added that there are three prerequisites neces
sary to establish a major in ethnic studies: academic re
sources, student interest and faculty interest. "I think the
scholarship is there," but the level of student and faculty in
terest is a question mark, she said.
A paucity of minority faculty compounds the problem,
l.ougee said. Because there are only four Chicano profes-
sors teaching at the undergraduate
level, it would be hard to support a
major in Chicano studies, she added.
Currently, it would also be hard for
the University to establish an Native
American studies program since it
does not have any professors in the
field on its faculty.
"We really feel the need for an eth
nic studies program," said Debbie Phil
lips, former council co-chair of the
Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion. American Indians study in an edu
cational system that essentially ignores
their historical contributions, and a
program focussing on minorities
would bring attention to these
cultures, she said.
Garcia also suggested a course in
ethnic studies as a future distribution
requirement. It would help produce
"well-rounded" students, he said.
According to Lougee, some univer
sities around the country already em
phasize ethnic studies in their cur
riculums. The University of Minnesota,
for example, requires all its students to
take a course in the subject before

graduation. At Stanford, the biggest ob
stacle is that students currently have all
the requirements that they can handle,
Lougee said.
"I think the University is open to
suggestions at this point," Lougee said.
Another project, a community ser
vice board, is essential to the minority
community and to other service organ
izations, according to ASSU senator
Felix Cuevas.
The constitution of the People's Plat
form states that community service "is
particularly important for students
who come from ethnic backgrounds,
for these disadvantaged communities
are not-so-far removed from our
reality."
The proposed community service
board would operate like the Program
and Publications Boards, Cuevas said.
Students would manage the board, and
it would generate funds through the
general fee election in the spring.
Rudy Fuentes, a member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, said the
Program Board does not satisfy the
funding needs of the University's extra
curricular programs. While the Pro
gram Board funds the cultural, social
and political programs that benefit the
Stanford community, it does not cover
the full financial demands of commu

nity service organizations, he said.
The community service board,
however, would focus solely upon
community service-oriented projects
in which the people directly benefit
ting from the programs are not neces
sarily Stanford students, Fuentes
added.
According to Megan Sweezey, staff
coordinator for the Stanford Volunteer
Network (SVN), there has been in the
past a myth circulating through the
ASSU that student groups located in
Owen House get funding from the
President's Office. These student
groups have to raise their own funds,
she said.
Cuevas used the Program Board's
past funding of the Barrio Assistance
Program to demonstrate the need for a
community service board.
In the Barrio Assistance Program,
students tutor children from East Palo
Alto. On Saturday mornings, they pick
up 50 children in rented vehicles,
drive them to the campus, serve them
breakfast, and then teach them aca
demic subjects and arts and crafts for
two hours, Cuevas said.
Traditionally, the Program Board
would only fund the cost of teaching
supplies, saying that the teaching ex

while the transportation and eating
costs benefit only the children from
East Palo Alto. A community service
board would help defray the costs of
transportation and breakfast as well,
Cuevas said.
The creation of the community ser
vice board would have peripheral
benefits as well, said Lome Needle,
budget director of SVN.
By having a special focus on commu
nity service organizations, these
groups would be able to to pool their
ideas and resources. Currently, com
munity service organizations have only
vague impressions of what their coun
terparts are doing, Needle said. Fur
thermore, the board would make it
easier for these organizations "to sift
through the (ASSU) budgeting
process," he said.
According to Sweezey, the board
will "bring together all the needs from
student organizations on campus." It
will increase the community's aware
ness of the organization's activities, she
added.
Currently, there are 36 community
service oganizations registered with
Student Organization Services, Fuentes
said.
