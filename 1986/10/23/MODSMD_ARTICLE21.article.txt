## Engineering prof. branches into Farm trees 
### ANDREA ARNOLD 
"I saw the seedling poking through
some ground cover, and I wanted to let
it grow there," Electrical Engineering
Prof. Ron Bracewell says about one of
his favorite trees, just outside his office
window. "So 1 bought an official
looking stake, tied a red ribbon around
it and pounded it into the ground by
the tree. The maintenance man didn't
know what it meant, so he left the tree
alone "
Now it stands taller than the building
where he works.
Bracewell is not your ordinary en
gineer. In accordance with his belief in
having a well-rounded education,
Bracewell has written a book entitled
"Trees on the Stanford Campus."
An ambitious work, this book

depicts more than 50 plant families,
more than 120 genera and more than
300 species. All of these may be found
in the Arboretum or elsewhere on the
Stanford campus. Bracewell notes that
"our campus has one of the widest col
lections of trees you would ever hope
to find in the United States."
In addition to outlining the species
of trees on campus, Bracewell has also
included maps, or "tree walks," of Wil
bur and Serra. "This is a great place to
spend a year or two because you get to
know a lot of different trees — some
day you might recognize one or two
on your travels and will be able to say,
'Hey, there's an old friend!' " he says.
Bracewell's book has not been for
mally published, but he keeps a manu
script on hand to copy upon request.
Copies are also available on loan in

Green and Falconer Biology libraries.
The book is constantly updated
Bracewell says."I add a few pages
every year when I discover a new tree,
or when someone shows me one."
Bracewell's interest in tetany began
one year while he was working for a
beekeeper. The beekeeper had to
keep track of all the blossoming trees,
and in the process, Bracewell
developed an eye for different species.
This interest became a passion for the
trees of Stanford, which have been im
ported from all over the Americas,
Africa, Europe, Australia and Asia.
Except for some oak trees and a few
other sparse species, the Stanford
campus would be barren of landscap
ing without all the care and attention
maintenance personnel have given it.
"Plant services here are very good —

they understand their job well," says
Bracewell.
He says he doesn't think that any of
the new architecture will hurt the
campus. He notes that, although the
Near West Campus proposal will take
out a lot of trees, "planning of the
building goes hand in hand with
landscape architecture."
If anything, people have tended to
plant trees where there are none on
campus, in accordance with I.eland
Stanford's wish to "plant in the Arbore
tum every species of tree that would
grow here," Bracewell says.
In addition to writing "Trees on the
Stanford Campus," he has also written
and contributed to many other books.
These include works on such topics as
radioastronomy, geophysics, life in
outer space — and even an entry in the
Encyclopedia Britannica. His books

have been translated into several lan
guages, including Japanese, Russian,
Dutch and Italian.
Truly a "Renaissance man,"
Bracewell was born and educated in
Australia. He received a bachelor's and
master's in engineering with first-class
honors from the University of Sydney.
His list of achievements is long and
diverse, including the construction of
the first radio telescope to give output
automatically in printed form, which
received acknowledgment from NASA
for support of the first manned landing
on the moon.
Bracewell has held many govern
ment advisory positions, including
membership on the advisory panels of
the National Science Foundation, the
Naval Research Laboratory and the Na
tional Academy of Sciences.

In addition, Bracewell has been ac
tive within the University. In 1974, he
was appointed the first Lewis M. Ter
man Professor and Fellow in Electrical
Engineering. He has also served on the
Inkeles committee study of overseas
programs as well as on the Western
Culture Program Committee — to
name just a small portion of his activi
ties.
Practicing what he preaches,
Bracewell is fighting against scientific
illiteracy and narrow education, espe
cially their effects on public decision
making. He says he believes in a liberal
arts-based undergraduate education
and dislikes the fact that college re
quirements, such as learning a foreign
language, are being eased rather than
strengthened. Bracewell himself is an
individual who still takes time to look
at the trees.

"Plant services here are very good —

they understand their job well," says
Bracewell.
He says he doesn't think that any of
the new architecture will hurt the
campus. He notes that, although the
Near West Campus proposal will take
out a lot of trees, "planning of the
building goes hand in hand with
landscape architecture."
If anything, people have tended to
plant trees where there are none on
campus, in accordance with I.eland
Stanford's wish to "plant in the Arbore
tum every species of tree that would
grow here," Bracewell says.
In addition to writing "Trees on the
Stanford Campus," he has also written
and contributed to many other books.
These include works on such topics as
radioastronomy, geophysics, life in
outer space — and even an entry in the
Encyclopedia Britannica. His books

have been translated into several lan
guages, including Japanese, Russian,
Dutch and Italian.
Truly a "Renaissance man,"
Bracewell was born and educated in
Australia. He received a bachelor's and
master's in engineering with first-class
honors from the University of Sydney.
His list of achievements is long and
diverse, including the construction of
the first radio telescope to give output
automatically in printed form, which
received acknowledgment from NASA
for support of the first manned landing
on the moon.
Bracewell has held many govern
ment advisory positions, including
membership on the advisory panels of
the National Science Foundation, the
Naval Research Laboratory and the Na
tional Academy of Sciences.

In addition, Bracewell has been ac
tive within the University. In 1974, he
was appointed the first Lewis M. Ter
man Professor and Fellow in Electrical
Engineering. He has also served on the
Inkeles committee study of overseas
programs as well as on the Western
Culture Program Committee — to
name just a small portion of his activi
ties.
Practicing what he preaches,
Bracewell is fighting against scientific
illiteracy and narrow education, espe
cially their effects on public decision
making. He says he believes in a liberal
arts-based undergraduate education
and dislikes the fact that college re
quirements, such as learning a foreign
language, are being eased rather than
strengthened. Bracewell himself is an
individual who still takes time to look
at the trees.

Engineering Prof. Ron Bracewell is shown here next to an illustration of a branch of Cypress
Pine from his book "Trees on the Stanford Campus." The pine, a native of New South Wales, is
one of the many different international varieties of trees on the Stanford campus, and three can
be found "thriving on Stanford Avenue opposite Peter Coutts Road."

"I saw the seedling poking through
some ground cover, and I wanted to let
it grow there," Electrical Engineering
Prof. Ron Bracewell says about one of
his favorite trees, just outside his office
window. "So 1 bought an official
looking stake, tied a red ribbon around
it and pounded it into the ground by
the tree. The maintenance man didn't
know what it meant, so he left the tree
alone "
Now it stands taller than the building
where he works.
Bracewell is not your ordinary en
gineer. In accordance with his belief in
having a well-rounded education,
Bracewell has written a book entitled
"Trees on the Stanford Campus."
An ambitious work, this book

depicts more than 50 plant families,
more than 120 genera and more than
300 species. All of these may be found
in the Arboretum or elsewhere on the
Stanford campus. Bracewell notes that
"our campus has one of the widest col
lections of trees you would ever hope
to find in the United States."
In addition to outlining the species
of trees on campus, Bracewell has also
included maps, or "tree walks," of Wil
bur and Serra. "This is a great place to
spend a year or two because you get to
know a lot of different trees — some
day you might recognize one or two
on your travels and will be able to say,
'Hey, there's an old friend!' " he says.
Bracewell's book has not been for
mally published, but he keeps a manu
script on hand to copy upon request.
Copies are also available on loan in

Green and Falconer Biology libraries.
The book is constantly updated
Bracewell says."I add a few pages
every year when I discover a new tree,
or when someone shows me one."
Bracewell's interest in tetany began
one year while he was working for a
beekeeper. The beekeeper had to
keep track of all the blossoming trees,
and in the process, Bracewell
developed an eye for different species.
This interest became a passion for the
trees of Stanford, which have been im
ported from all over the Americas,
Africa, Europe, Australia and Asia.
Except for some oak trees and a few
other sparse species, the Stanford
campus would be barren of landscap
ing without all the care and attention
maintenance personnel have given it.
