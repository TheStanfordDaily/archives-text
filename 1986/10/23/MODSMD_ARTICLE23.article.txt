## Trojans are ripe for the picking 
### 
Stanford 41, Oregon 7.
Look at that for a minute. A lot to a
little. Looks familiar. You know, with
the first team named something like
Oklahoma or Alabama or Nebraska.
But Stanford? Yes, Stanford.
Not that Stanford Coach Jack Elway
was trying to run up the score in that
41-7 thrashing at Oregon. "Hell, no,"
Elway said emphatically. "Winning's
the only thing I give a damn about."

But against Oregon State and San
Diego State, there was always the
doubt that perhaps the Cardinal was
only good enough to barely beat teams
of that caliber.
That's bull. The loss to Washington
proved Stanford is a serious contender
for the Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship this season.
But still, there's something fun about
teams whose games are always in
doubt in the final two minutes. They
get cute names like "Cardiac Card,"
their quarterback gets on the cover of
Sports Illustrated, and they lose most
of those games and go 5-6. "Yeah, but it
was exciting," the fans say.
Exciting and a $20 ticket will get you
into the Rose Bowl. If you want to earn
your way in, you've got to be merciless.
Heartless. Mean. Hungry. "We should
always have the attitude that we will
take no prisoners," Thomas Henley
said Saturday.
To the lifeboats, Ducks. Abandon
ship. Women and children first.
With the exception of the only

Oregon scoring drive, the Cardinal
took no prisoners. And unexciting?
Half the crowd had adjourned to the
more pleasant task of enjoying a
tailgate party by the fourth quarter.
In the last two weeks the Cardinal
has shown it can play with the best the
conference has to offer and can
destroy the worst. But to earn that Rose
Bowl bid, one more question must be
answered affirmatively: Can Stanford
beat the other teams also contending
for the league title, i.e., USC and com
pany?
It seems a universal truth that the
most recently converted to a belief are
its most ardent proponents. As one
who doubted whether the Cardinal
was a true contender and now has seen
the error of that doubt, my urge is to
write a big, inch-high headline
proclaiming: "Card will win!" Yeah!
Stanford's real good this year and no
one can beat em.
Return to Spaceship Earth. There are
six teams in this conference who could
win the championship. Stanford is one
of those. USC is one of those.
Reality time. Stanford has not beaten
USC since 1975. Has not beaten USC in
Stanford Stadium since 1970.
But, somehow, this year, things
seem different. There's confidence.
Lots of it. And there's trouble in La-La
Land.
USC is one of those places where
you go to the Rose Bowl every couple
of years, win it most of the time and
tack on another national championship
every decade or so. You get five guys
the size of Chryslers, one guy with
more moves than U-Haul and run Stu
dent Body Right about 40 times a
game. Run Student Body Left the other
30 for variety.
Welcome to parity in the toughest
conference in the country. And parity
doesn't do much for your job when
you're USC Coach Ted Tollner.

Tollner is the winningest coach in
the Pac-10 over the last four years. He
won the Rose Bowl two years ago. He
even shocked Trojan fans by showing a
football can be thrown. Where has that
left him? Fearing for his job. If you
have Joe Kapp's record, you should ex
pea to be packing your bags. But Toll
ner?

Look at this week's Sports Il
lustrated, page 26. Four pages on the
wonderful state of the USC athletic de
partment. And the Trojans were 4-1 at
the time. At half the schools in the
country, that gets you an immediate
contract extension.
Since then, the Trojans have added a
loss to Arizona State to the earlier up

set at Washington State. The Rose Bowl
hopes have fallen to slim. Saturday
night, diey could be none.
One of two things could happen to
the USC team. One, they realize their
backs are to the wall, get mad, play the
games of their lives and have the Card
inal putting its Rose Bowl hopes on
hold for yet another year. Or two,

losing feeds on losing, and they're ripe
for the picking.
Irrespective of that, look at the Stan
ford team. They're good. They're confi
dent. They're healthy.
And hungry. Saturday is their chance
to show the nation just how good.
Don't look for that chance to go
unused.

ship. Women and children first.
With the exception of the only

Oregon scoring drive, the Cardinal
took no prisoners. And unexciting?
Half the crowd had adjourned to the
more pleasant task of enjoying a
tailgate party by the fourth quarter.
In the last two weeks the Cardinal
has shown it can play with the best the
conference has to offer and can
destroy the worst. But to earn that Rose
Bowl bid, one more question must be
answered affirmatively: Can Stanford
beat the other teams also contending
for the league title, i.e., USC and com
pany?
It seems a universal truth that the
most recently converted to a belief are
its most ardent proponents. As one
who doubted whether the Cardinal
was a true contender and now has seen
the error of that doubt, my urge is to
write a big, inch-high headline
proclaiming: "Card will win!" Yeah!
Stanford's real good this year and no
one can beat em.
Return to Spaceship Earth. There are
six teams in this conference who could
win the championship. Stanford is one
of those. USC is one of those.
Reality time. Stanford has not beaten
USC since 1975. Has not beaten USC in
Stanford Stadium since 1970.
But, somehow, this year, things
seem different. There's confidence.
Lots of it. And there's trouble in La-La
Land.
USC is one of those places where
you go to the Rose Bowl every couple
of years, win it most of the time and
tack on another national championship
every decade or so. You get five guys
the size of Chryslers, one guy with
more moves than U-Haul and run Stu
dent Body Right about 40 times a
game. Run Student Body Left the other
30 for variety.
Welcome to parity in the toughest
conference in the country. And parity
doesn't do much for your job when
you're USC Coach Ted Tollner.

Tollner is the winningest coach in
the Pac-10 over the last four years. He
won the Rose Bowl two years ago. He
even shocked Trojan fans by showing a
football can be thrown. Where has that
left him? Fearing for his job. If you
have Joe Kapp's record, you should ex
pea to be packing your bags. But Toll
ner?

Look at this week's Sports Il
lustrated, page 26. Four pages on the
wonderful state of the USC athletic de
partment. And the Trojans were 4-1 at
the time. At half the schools in the
country, that gets you an immediate
contract extension.
Since then, the Trojans have added a
loss to Arizona State to the earlier up

set at Washington State. The Rose Bowl
hopes have fallen to slim. Saturday
night, diey could be none.
One of two things could happen to
the USC team. One, they realize their
backs are to the wall, get mad, play the
games of their lives and have the Card
inal putting its Rose Bowl hopes on
hold for yet another year. Or two,

losing feeds on losing, and they're ripe
for the picking.
Irrespective of that, look at the Stan
ford team. They're good. They're confi
dent. They're healthy.
And hungry. Saturday is their chance
to show the nation just how good.
Don't look for that chance to go
unused.

Stanford quarterback John Paye has had a celebrated college career, but he
has never led the Cardinal past USC. Paye has a lot of company, though;

Stanford has not defeated the Trojans since 1975 and has not been victorious
at home since 1970.
Stanford 41, Oregon 7.
Look at that for a minute. A lot to a
little. Looks familiar. You know, with
the first team named something like
Oklahoma or Alabama or Nebraska.
But Stanford? Yes, Stanford.
Not that Stanford Coach Jack Elway
was trying to run up the score in that
41-7 thrashing at Oregon. "Hell, no,"
Elway said emphatically. "Winning's
the only thing I give a damn about."

But against Oregon State and San
Diego State, there was always the
doubt that perhaps the Cardinal was
only good enough to barely beat teams
of that caliber.
That's bull. The loss to Washington
proved Stanford is a serious contender
for the Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship this season.
But still, there's something fun about
teams whose games are always in
doubt in the final two minutes. They
get cute names like "Cardiac Card,"
their quarterback gets on the cover of
Sports Illustrated, and they lose most
of those games and go 5-6. "Yeah, but it
was exciting," the fans say.
Exciting and a $20 ticket will get you
into the Rose Bowl. If you want to earn
your way in, you've got to be merciless.
Heartless. Mean. Hungry. "We should
always have the attitude that we will
take no prisoners," Thomas Henley
said Saturday.
To the lifeboats, Ducks. Abandon
ship. Women and children first.
