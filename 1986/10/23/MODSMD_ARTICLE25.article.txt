## 
### 
BOSTON â€” Gary Carter homered twice and Len Dykstra
added another behind Ron Darling's pitching, and the New
York Mets held off the Boston Red Sox 6-2 last night to
square the World Series at two games each.
Carter's first homer, with a man on, opened the scoring as
the Mets took a 3-0 lead in the fourth inning against Red Sox
starter Al Nipper, who hadn't pitched in 1" days. The Mets
catcher closed New York's scoring with a solo homer over
the screen above the left-field wall in the eighth off reliever
Steve Crawford. It was Carter's seventh RBI in the Series.
Dykstra's two-run homer in the seventh off Crawford
made it 5-0 as the Mets continued their offensive resur
gence. The Mets won Game 3, 7-1, after scoring only three
runs in losing the fi.st two games at home.
Dykstra's second homer of the Series, a two-out shot,
tipped off the glove of Red Sox right fielder Dwight Evans
and fell into the Mets bullpen.
Darling, working on three days' rest, blanked the Red Sox
on four hits before leaving after seven innings He lost the
first game of the Series 1-0, giving up one unearned run in
seven innings
Roger McDowell, who pitched two perfect innings to
close the Mets' victory in Game 3, gave up two runs in the
eighth and needed relief from Jesse Orosco, who got the
last out of the eighth with two runners on. and then closed
out the Red Sox in the ninth.

The victory ensured at least a Game 6, giving the Mets the
opportunity to bring the Series back to Shea Stadium. It was
news that could have been greeted with mixed emotions.
The Mets lost the first two games at home, then won two at
Fenway Park.
It is the first time since 1923 that visiting teams have won
the first four games. The only other time was in 1906.
Dwight Gtxxlen, 17-6, who lost Game 2, is scheduled to
start for the Mets in Game 5 tonight against Bruce Hurst, 13-
8, who worked eight scoreless innings as the winner in
Game 1.
Darling was not perfect, coming back for the first time
this season on such short notice He walked six and struck
out four, and he was just good enough as the Red Sox
stranded 11 runners, nine in Darling s seven innings.
Nipper, who allowed seven hits in six innings, came into
the game with a 10-12 record and an ERA of 5.38 during the
season, the highest of any World Series starter since 194".
That's when Hal Gregg of Brooklyn brought a S B- ERA into
Game 7 against the New York Yankees and got knocked out
in the fourth inning.
Nipper, left out of the Red Sox's postseason pitching rota
tion until it became clear that both Hurst and Roger
Clemens needed more rest, hadn't started a game since Oct
4, the next-to-last day of the season Calling himself the
"Unknown Pitcher," he was glad for this chance. So, it
seemed, were the Mets.
