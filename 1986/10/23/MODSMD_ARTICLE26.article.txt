# Women's soccer loses in final minutes, 2-1
## Card falls to 3-8-1 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
Victory was well within reach of the
Stanford women's soccer team all
throughout its game yesterday against
Cal State-Hayward. It all ended in a
heartbreaking loss, however, as the
Cardinal was defeated 2-1 on a goal
scored in the last two minutes.
It was not so much a suprise that
Stanford lost as it was that the Cardinal
played so well against a top-notch team
like the Pioneers. Hayward, ranked No.
15 in the nation, is now 12-1. The
Pioneers have won nine games in a
row, but Stanford avoided being one of
their five shutout victims this year.
At the beginning of the game, it ap
peared that Stanford was capable of
neither scoring nor playing defense.
The Cardinal offense almost never
gained possession of the ball in the
first half and certainly never threat
ened to score.
The Pioneers were relentless in
their attacks on the Stanford goal in the
first half. Close shot followed close
shot, but somehow the Cardinal
defense held out and continued to
dodge bullets.
"We played terrible the first half...
as bad as we've played all year," Stan
ford Coach Helen Keohane said. Still,
the Pioneers could not score, and the
teams entered the halftime break in a
scoreless tie.
Keohane and the team had a serious
talk during halftime. The message that
the coach sent to her players was:
"Anybody who is not ready to play can
go home now."
Everyone came back to play in the
second half, and the change in their
play was astounding.
"We needed to spark a little offense,
and we did it in the second half," de
fensive specialist Hilary Turner said.
In the first moments of the second
half, the Cardinal offense established
control. At die 4"'-minute mark, just
two minutes into the second period,
Stanford scored the first goal.
Stacev Keare passed the ball to fel
low midfielder Tonya Antonucci just
outside and to the right of the goalie's
box. Antonucci kicked the ball across
to the left where it hit the left goalpost
and rebounded across the goal and
into the net. Antonucci now leads the
team with four goals this season.
The momentum Stanford gained
with that goal was soon broken by the
experienced Hayward squad At the 52-
minute mark, a long, high, looping
Pioneer shot found the Stanford goal,
tying the game at 1-1.
At this point, it seemed that the Card
inal would continue to control the

Pioneers and hold the game to at least
a tie. Goalkeeper Vija Brookshire ac
cumulated 12 saves during the game,
including two brilliant corner kick
saves.
With two minutes remaining in the
game, many people were prepared for
overtime play, but on a deflected Stan
ford goal kick, a Pioneer forward
found the ball at her feet and kicked it
into the middle of the net, bringing the
score to 2-1.
Though the loss was a tough one to
take, Stanford was proud of its play in
the second half. "We came out to prove
a point, and we scored first,' Keohane
said "Still, we didn't play as well as we
could have
Stanford's loss brings its record
down to 3-8-1, but the record does not
reveal the tenacitv with which the

Cardinal has played tough, nationally
ranked teams like Hayward and Cali
fornia.
The rest of the season will be a
chance for Stanford to gain experience
and knowledge of other regional
teams. Three of the Cardinal's four
remaining games are on the road, and
all of the matches will be against com
petitive California teams.
This weekend, Stanford travels south
for two games Saturday, the Cardinal
will be in Long Beach for an 11 a.m.
contest against Long Beach State Sun
day, the team moves on to Cal State
rx>minguez Hills for a 1 p.m. game
Stanford's lone remaining home
outing is Nov. 1 against Santa Clara.
That game, scheduled for a n<xjn start
ing time, also marks the Cardinal's final
action of the season.

Defense has been the name of the game for the Stanford women's soccer
team this season. In yesterday's game against Cal State-Hayward, however,
senior Hilary Turner and her cohorts gave up a goal in the final two minutes
and lost 2-1.
