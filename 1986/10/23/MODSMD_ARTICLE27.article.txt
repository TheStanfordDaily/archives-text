How many times have you been to
Blatz without ever having noticed Casa
Isabel right across the street? Take it
easy, now. We're not making any accu
sations or insinuations except maybe
toward Isabel who camouflaged her
little oasis behind an exaggeratedly
drab exterior.
We would never have noticed Casa
Isabel if it hadn't come unusually en
thusiastically recommended. And if by
chance we had noticed it, we never
would have gone in. It looks rather dis
mal, but maybe that's authenticity. Or
maybe Isabel strives to maintain that
neighborhood, word-of-mouth, family
business feeling.
In either case, it's working. She's not
hard-up for business. We went early on
a weeknight, and the Casa was bustling.
Like a snail withdrawn into its shell, all
the vitality here is protected behind
ugly walls.
The inside is really quite nice. The
dominant decorative factor is the plant
life. The greenery is very comforting
and inviting, and they have all three
kinds of flowers (real, paper and plas
tic).
The decor is really too nice to in
spire any psychological resemblances
j with romantic trips to Mexico. But the

decorations are all thoroughly
Mexican. The prints are beautiful, and
the enameled ceramic animals add a
touch of life. There are linternas,
pinatas and tapices.
The food gives a startled smile to
those of us who grew up accustomed
to good Mexican food who gag at
the mere mention of Compadres,
Pedro's, El Torito and ack Casa
Real. Even the drinks are better at Casa
Isabel.
To celebrate the arrival of a warm
basket of chips, we ordered margaritas.
They were smooth and tangy, tasting
not of chopped ice and yellow drink
mix as is the norm around here, but of
mmmmmargarita.
The Espanada is a variation on
Sangria. It differs mostly by the addi
tion of brandy and fruit liqueurs. At
first it tastes like raspberry Jell-O, but
the flavor (and the liquor) grows on
you till you are at least partially aware
of its subtlety. By that time, you are
ready to eat.
As every serious diner knows, when
visiting a distinctive restaurant, one
should always order a specialty of the
house. One of the Isabel
Especialidades is the Burrito Picado:
diced New York steak, sauteed, then
cooked with tomatoes, onions and bell
peppers, seasoned to a proper
"picado" rolled in a flour tortilla and
crowned with a lovely dollop of
guacamole. This burrito bueno sits be
tween a steaming mound of Spanish
rice and a lettuce 'n' salsa salad. At

$8.25, this is without a doubt Isabel's
best.
The Chili Verde ($7.95) consists of
chunks of pork loin, sliced green pep
pers and a dabble of green sauce. Al
though the taste could have been
stronger had it been more verde , and
the tortillas more substantial had they
not wilted quietly on the side, the com
bination with rice and beans made this
a hearty and pleasant meal.
We then turned our minds and
hearts toward the dessert specialties
which were described in tortuous
detail on cards at the head of the table.
The Budin ala Isabel ($1.80!) is a
Mexican bread pudding soaked in a
mysterious mixture of French brandy,
golden rum and Kahlua, then blended
with sweet ripe bananas and plump
juicy raisins. Isabel, you sweetheart,
you have outdone yourself.
Barely recovering, we sat up bravely
and ordered Bunuelos ($1.75), sweet
fried tortillas with ice cream and honey
syrup. We indulged with our hands,
breaking off slivers of sugared tortilla
dripping with sweet luscious goop,
and stabbing it into melting ice cream.
These glorious finales created the
fiesta in our evening.
