# Computer areas grow in dorms
## 
### JAY FRY 
Bit by hit, computers are becoming
firmly entrenched in Stanford dorm
life. The latest step in that direction in
cludes nine new computer clusters set
up this summer in dorms scattered
throughout campus.
The new dorm computer areas
house either Apple Macintoshes or
IBM Personal Computers, according to
Jeff Merriman, coordinator of Residen
tial Education's electronic classroom
project. Branner, East Lagunita, Roble
and Soto house one IBM PC cluster
each, while Florence Moore Hall has
two.
The new Macintosh clusters are lo
cated in West Lagunita, Otero and
Zapata, said Merriman. He added that
each cluster has between five and 12
computers available for student use.
Merriman said each dorm with a
computer center has a system adminis
trator paid by Res Ed to help organize
the cluster and decide policies, such as
who has access to the computers. In
general, the clusters are open to dorm
residents 2<t hours a day, he said.
"The ultimate goal (of Res Ed's Resi
dential Electronic Classroom project)
is to get every dorm with a computer
cluster," said Merriman.
"The real key is getting students in
volved," said Tom Maliska, an aca
demic computing specialist for Instruc
tion and Research Information Systems
(IKiS). The success of the dorm com
puter clusters depends on die system
administrators and other peer tutors,
he said. "It will depend on their energy
and their ability to get students in
volved."
Students can use their own software
or software on reserve in the individ
ual centers, said Merriman. Available
programs include Mac Write, MacPaint,
PC Write and Lotus 1-2-3- A laser
printer is also set up in each cluster for
student use, he said.
In addition, Merriman said that
within the quarter, all of the dorm
computer clusters should be con
nected to SUNet, the Stanford comput
ing network. Using this connection,
students will be able to access the Low
Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) system

and folio files like Socrates, the
electronic card catalog for Stanford's li
braries, he said.
The IBM clusters will also have a
local network, said Merriman. All of
the IBM PCs in one room will be
hooked up to an IBM AT equipped
with a hard disk. Students will be able
to retrieve software stored in the main
computer's memory from any one of
the IBM PCs in the room, he said.
Six dorms already had similar com
puting centers in place before this
summer's work was done. Donner,
Larkin, Roble, Rinconada, Toyon and
Twain have slightly older DEC Rain
bow 100 PCs hooked up, said Mer
riman. These dorms are also equipped
with either daisy-wheel or dot-matrix
printers.
The new IBM clusters are funded
through Res Ed's Residential Electronic
Classroom project, which in turn is
funded using part of a $10 million grant
from IBM. according to Maliska. Res Ed
was one of several Stanford depart
ments that put forward proposals con
sidered by a committee under Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee to receive a slice of the IBM
grant.
In turn, Res Ed asked for proposals
from resident fellows outlining their
dorm's planned usage of a computer
cluster, if one were installed. Using
these proposals, Res Ed decided how
to allocate its nearly $1 million portion
of tiie II3M gram, said Mali.ska.
One such accepted proposal was put
forward by Otero RF Dennis Matthies.
Otero is using its Macintosh computer
center to create a dorm database. The
database, which is currently being
updated, will eventually include infor
mation about the interests of everyone
in the dorm, and Matthies said he
hopes ultimately to have not only in
formation about political, social, religi
ous and travel interests, but also about
campus organizations, public service,
special skills and research interests of
each student.
According to Matthies, the database
can then be used in several ways. RFs
and residence assistants can plan
events, programs and dorm trips based
on interests of students as noted in the
database. They are also able to locate
those who would most likely be inter
ested in on-campus speakers and eve
ning programs on a certain subject.
Matthies also said the database could

be used by someone in the dorm in or
der to find others interested in or
ganizing an activity in which he or she
also has an interest. Advisers and RFs
could also use the database to circulate
interesting or provocative newspaper
articles among students who have
listed an interest on the computer in
that area, he said.
"The larger the dorm, the more use
ful the database is, especially if house

meetings are poorly attended," said
Matthies. "It has tremendous possibili
ties to reform what RAs and RFs do. It
gives them a new tool."
Matthies said he hopes that RAs can
become networkers, helping to match
the research interests of students in the
dorm with those of faculty members.
By linking the dorm computer clusters
to SUNet, the students will also be able
to find faculty research interests cor

responding to theirs by using Stan
ford's Odyssey database.
Several dorm-based introductory
computer science classes are also
utilizing both the newer and the older
computer clusters, according to Mer
riman. For the past two years, Com
puter Science IE — an introduction to
the DEC Rainbow — has been offered
perience benefits Stanford students,
in the dorms that house these com
puters. This quarter-long, dorm-based
CS 1C (for the Macintosh) and CS ID
(for the IBM PC) classes are being
given in the new computer centers,
said Merriman.
The classes, taught by undergradu
ates for the most part, attempt to give
students a working knowledge not
only of the specific hardware and
software located in the dorm clusters,
but also of computers in general, he
said.
"It's kind of exciting allowing stu
dents to get involved in the teaching of
computing," said Merriman.
Martin Spicer, a freshman teaching
assistant for Flo Mo's CS ID class,
agrees. "It's good because students are
being taught by their peers — people
they live with day in and day out. It
makes a better classroom atmosphere
because everyone knows each other,"
Spicer said.
Both Maliska and Matthies said they
believe the clusters will be very useful
for residence-based classes not in the
Computer Science Department, like

freshman English and the Structured
Liberal Education program. Matthies
said that he is very optimistic about
using text editor software — programs
that help the user with spelling, gram
mar, diction and many other aspects of
language — especially in freshman En
glish classes.
This fall, Res Ed will read and evalu
ate a whole new set of proposals from
RFs for additional dorm computer

clusters elsewhere on campus, accord
ing to Maliska. Merriman said prefer
ence will be given to Stern and Wilbur
Halls to help those dorms become
more academically "desirable." Addi
tional IBM clusters from these
proposals should be on-line sometime
in the middle of winter quarter, he
said.

from IBM. according to Maliska. Res Ed
was one of several Stanford depart
ments that put forward proposals con
sidered by a committee under Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee to receive a slice of the IBM
grant.
In turn, Res Ed asked for proposals
from resident fellows outlining their
dorm's planned usage of a computer
cluster, if one were installed. Using
these proposals, Res Ed decided how
to allocate its nearly $1 million portion
of tiie II3M gram, said Mali.ska.
One such accepted proposal was put
forward by Otero RF Dennis Matthies.
Otero is using its Macintosh computer
center to create a dorm database. The
database, which is currently being
updated, will eventually include infor
mation about the interests of everyone
in the dorm, and Matthies said he
hopes ultimately to have not only in
formation about political, social, religi
ous and travel interests, but also about
campus organizations, public service,
special skills and research interests of
each student.
According to Matthies, the database
can then be used in several ways. RFs
and residence assistants can plan
events, programs and dorm trips based
on interests of students as noted in the
database. They are also able to locate
those who would most likely be inter
ested in on-campus speakers and eve
ning programs on a certain subject.
Matthies also said the database could

be used by someone in the dorm in or
der to find others interested in or
ganizing an activity in which he or she
also has an interest. Advisers and RFs
could also use the database to circulate
interesting or provocative newspaper
articles among students who have
listed an interest on the computer in
that area, he said.
"The larger the dorm, the more use
ful the database is, especially if house

meetings are poorly attended," said
Matthies. "It has tremendous possibili
ties to reform what RAs and RFs do. It
gives them a new tool."
Matthies said he hopes that RAs can
become networkers, helping to match
the research interests of students in the
dorm with those of faculty members.
By linking the dorm computer clusters
to SUNet, the students will also be able
to find faculty research interests cor

responding to theirs by using Stan
ford's Odyssey database.
Several dorm-based introductory
computer science classes are also
utilizing both the newer and the older
computer clusters, according to Mer
riman. For the past two years, Com
puter Science IE — an introduction to
the DEC Rainbow — has been offered
perience benefits Stanford students,
in the dorms that house these com
puters. This quarter-long, dorm-based
CS 1C (for the Macintosh) and CS ID
(for the IBM PC) classes are being
given in the new computer centers,
said Merriman.
The classes, taught by undergradu
ates for the most part, attempt to give
students a working knowledge not
only of the specific hardware and
software located in the dorm clusters,
but also of computers in general, he
said.
"It's kind of exciting allowing stu
dents to get involved in the teaching of
computing," said Merriman.
Martin Spicer, a freshman teaching
assistant for Flo Mo's CS ID class,
agrees. "It's good because students are
being taught by their peers — people
they live with day in and day out. It
makes a better classroom atmosphere
because everyone knows each other,"
Spicer said.
Both Maliska and Matthies said they
believe the clusters will be very useful
for residence-based classes not in the
Computer Science Department, like

freshman English and the Structured
Liberal Education program. Matthies
said that he is very optimistic about
using text editor software — programs
that help the user with spelling, gram
mar, diction and many other aspects of
language — especially in freshman En
glish classes.
This fall, Res Ed will read and evalu
ate a whole new set of proposals from
RFs for additional dorm computer

clusters elsewhere on campus, accord
ing to Maliska. Merriman said prefer
ence will be given to Stern and Wilbur
Halls to help those dorms become
more academically "desirable." Addi
tional IBM clusters from these
proposals should be on-line sometime
in the middle of winter quarter, he
said.

'It's exciting allow
ing students to get
involved in the
teaching.'
Bit by hit, computers are becoming
firmly entrenched in Stanford dorm
life. The latest step in that direction in
cludes nine new computer clusters set
up this summer in dorms scattered
throughout campus.
The new dorm computer areas
house either Apple Macintoshes or
IBM Personal Computers, according to
Jeff Merriman, coordinator of Residen
tial Education's electronic classroom
project. Branner, East Lagunita, Roble
and Soto house one IBM PC cluster
each, while Florence Moore Hall has
two.
The new Macintosh clusters are lo
cated in West Lagunita, Otero and
Zapata, said Merriman. He added that
each cluster has between five and 12
computers available for student use.
Merriman said each dorm with a
computer center has a system adminis
trator paid by Res Ed to help organize
the cluster and decide policies, such as
who has access to the computers. In
general, the clusters are open to dorm
residents 2<t hours a day, he said.
"The ultimate goal (of Res Ed's Resi
dential Electronic Classroom project)
is to get every dorm with a computer
cluster," said Merriman.
"The real key is getting students in
volved," said Tom Maliska, an aca
demic computing specialist for Instruc
tion and Research Information Systems
(IKiS). The success of the dorm com
puter clusters depends on die system
administrators and other peer tutors,
he said. "It will depend on their energy
and their ability to get students in
volved."
Students can use their own software
or software on reserve in the individ
ual centers, said Merriman. Available
programs include Mac Write, MacPaint,
PC Write and Lotus 1-2-3- A laser
printer is also set up in each cluster for
student use, he said.
In addition, Merriman said that
within the quarter, all of the dorm
computer clusters should be con
nected to SUNet, the Stanford comput
ing network. Using this connection,
students will be able to access the Low
Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) system

and folio files like Socrates, the
electronic card catalog for Stanford's li
braries, he said.
The IBM clusters will also have a
local network, said Merriman. All of
the IBM PCs in one room will be
hooked up to an IBM AT equipped
with a hard disk. Students will be able
to retrieve software stored in the main
computer's memory from any one of
the IBM PCs in the room, he said.
Six dorms already had similar com
puting centers in place before this
summer's work was done. Donner,
Larkin, Roble, Rinconada, Toyon and
Twain have slightly older DEC Rain
bow 100 PCs hooked up, said Mer
riman. These dorms are also equipped
with either daisy-wheel or dot-matrix
printers.
The new IBM clusters are funded
through Res Ed's Residential Electronic
Classroom project, which in turn is
funded using part of a $10 million grant
from IBM. according to Maliska. Res Ed
