# Prostitute makes campaign pitch
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
It is a simple career change from the world's
oldest profession to the second oldest — prostitution
to politics — and if Norma Jean Almodovar, the Lib
ertarian candidate for lieutenant governor, pulls it
off, it will be her biggest trick of all time.
"All politicians do is screw the public, and I know
how to screw the public better than anybody," said
Almodovar, a 34-year-old former call girl, to a group
of 50 students last night in Serra lounge.
Among those in attendance was President of Stan
ford Libertarians Tim Groseclose, who said, "She has
shock value, but she doesn't have a chance of win
ning."
Nevertheless, Almodovar has continued campaign
ing and selling posters of herself naked for $10. She
has netted to $8,000 from sales, but her cam
paign remains $10,000 in debt.
As lieutenant governor, Almodovar said she would
"wait for the governor to die. What else does the

lieutenant governor do? When is the only time you
hear from Leo McCarthy (present lieutenant gover
nor)? Every four years when it's time to run again.
"It's a P.R. job — just like my last one," she added.
Almodovar also said that if the governor were to
leave town for as much as a day, she would issue her
self a pardon. She is presently on probation after
having been jailed two years ago for pandering.
If her probation were lifted, she said she would
probably return to prostitution. "I miss them (her
clients), and I miss the money," she said, adding that
she made $200-$5OO per hour as a call girl.
Her platform centers on the libertarian ideal of
eliminating laws and placing more of the responsibil
ity to run society in the hands of private groups.
Calling for the decriminalization of all "victimless
crimes" such as prostitution, gambling and drug use,
she said, "All laws are enforced at the point of a gun.
Nobody has die right to point a gun at my head and
dictate my private consensual behavior."
As expected, she supported a "pro-choice stand
on abortion.

If unsuccessful in her hid for lieutenant governor,
Almodovar said she will finish writing a book about
her work with the Los Angeles Police Department,
write screenplays and perhaps open a prostitution
museum.
Almodovar was a traffic officer in Los Angeles
before she left the force, disgusted with the corrup
tion and injustice, and turned to prostitution. Her
book, called "Cop to Call Girl," tells of her experi
ences as a police officer and a prostitute.
She finally decided to leave the force after she had
been injured by a drunk driver who was not pun
ished because of his influence in the community, she
said. Almodovar presently has a $3 million lawsuit
pending against the Los Angeles Police Department
for the treatment she received.
"After the injury, eight hours of work was too
much. I needed something I could do lying on my
back — like prostitution," she said, "And now since
they won't let me engage in illegal prostitution, I'll
engage in legal prostitution — politics."
