# Staar: Soviets look to W. Europe
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Editorial staff 
A Soviet expert from the Hoover Institution
warned last night that the Politburo is stalling
on arms control talks in hopes of scoring poli
tical victories in upcoming elections in West
Germany and Great Britain.
In both countries, minority parties may
pose a threat to the leadership, jeopardizing
NATO unity and Western European support
for U.S. nuclear arms policy, Htxwer Senior
Eel low Richard Staar said.
Staar said Helmut Kohl's Christian Demo
cratic Union may be ousted from leadership
in West Germany if Johannes Rau's Social
Democratic Party teams up with the Green
Party. »
In Great Britain, an alliance of Neil Kin
nock's Labor Party and the Social Democratic-
Liberal coalition could steal the House of
Commons leadership from Margaret
Thatcher s Conservative Partv, Staar said.

Staar said the Soviets sought at the recent
Reykjavik "pre-summit" meeting to create an
excuse for postponing a summit meeting in
Washington, largely because they are waiting
on the two Western European elections.
The two leaders had agreed at their Novem
ber 1985 summit that they would meet this
year in the United States, but they have not yet
set a date.
President Reagan walked into an ambush at
Reykjavik, Staar said. "The Soviets surprised
the hell out of the United States to m;ike them
Ux)k bad."
Staar said Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
laid out a detailed arms reduction proposal
that he knew Reagan would not accept, with
the intention of winning a public relations vic
tory The Soviet proposal — like their previ
ous offers — tied nuclear arms reduction to
limitatioas on the U.S. Strategic Defense Ini
tiative, a program that has become the chief
sticking point in superpower arms control
talks.

Staar predicted that the Soviet Union will
continue to seek limits on SDI, wait on the
results of the elections in West Germany and
Great Britain, and, if it cannot negotiate an
arms agreement on favorable terms, hold out
until Reagan leaves office. "Moscow has no
timetable," he said.
Staar offered his analysis and predictions in
an informal Crothers Memorial talk to about
25 graduate students. The students sounded
skeptical of his statements.
"Your tone,' said one student, sounds as if
you're presenting them as the bad guys and us
as the good guys."
"That's right," he replied "They're the bad
guys."
Another student asked Staar, who served as
U.S. ambassador to the Mutual and Balanced
Force Reduction Talks from 19H1 to 1983,
how he could negotiate in good faith with the
Soviet Union if he felt they were so "bad."
"I went there open-minded," Staar said. "I
came back with a little experience."
