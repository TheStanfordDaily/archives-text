Gorbachev pleased with summit
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev told the Soviet public last
night the Iceland summit brought the United States and the Soviet Union
closer to agreement while clearly defining the many obstacles to arms con
trol.
Speaking on national television for the second time since the summit
with President Reagan, Gorbachev said the Oct. 11-12 meetings in Reyk
javik encouraged the Soviet leadership on the possibility of reducing nu
clear arms.
"It was perhaps the first time in many decades that such a big stride was
made in the quest for nuclear disarmament," the Communist Party general
secretary said, according to a Radio Moscow translation of his address.
"I still consider that, as a result of the meeting, we achieved a higher
stage not only in analyzing the situation, but in defining the aims and
framework of possible agreements, agreements on nuclear disarmament,"
he said.
However, Gorbachev said the summit "also threw into bold relief the
difficulties on the way to a nuclear-free world" adding that "circles associ
ated with militarism" were frightened by the progress made in Reykjavik.
In Iceland, the superpowers reached tentative agreement on making
huge cutbacks in their nuclear arsenals. But the agreement floundered
over Reagan's space-based missile defense program known as "Star Wars."
Gorbachev's speech on the evening news program "Vremya" came
hours after the Soviet Union announced it was ordering five more Ameri
can diplomats out of the country. Five U.S. diplomats were ordered ex
pelled Sunday.
The United States on Tuesday ordered the expulsion of 55 Soviet
diplomats.
Church denounces apartheid
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The influential Dutch Reformed
Church, whose religious teachings helped form the ideological basis of
apartheid, declared yesterday that South Africa's system of racial separation
and minority white rule is morally wrong and has done the country' and its
people grievous harm.
Although the church synod stopped short of condemning apartheid as
heresy and a sin, as liberal clerics demanded, its declaration leaves the Na
tional Party government without any moral justification for maintaining a
system in which the white minority continues to exclude three-quarters of
the country's population from political power.
"The church is convinced that forced separation of people cannot be
seen as a prescription from the Bible," synod delegates said in a resolution
adopted in Cape Town. "Such an attempt to justify it from the Bible must be
recognized as an error and rejected.
"The church is convinced that the use of apartheid as a socio-political
system which causes injustice to people and incorrecdy gives one group
preference over the other cannot be accepted on Christian ethical grounds
because it militates against brotherly love and justice, and it inevitably af
fects the human dignity of those involved."
Few aliens will win amnesty
LOS ANGELES — Due to complex requirements under the recently
passed immigration reform bill, only about 500,000 out of as many as 12
million undocumented aliens in the United States will be granted amnesty,
an expert says.
"It's not just a matter of walking into an office and saying, I've been here
illegally since 1982,' " said Mario Moreno of the Mexican-American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund.
"Many people haven't made a point of keeping documentation they
would need to prove they have been in the country that long."
Mareno, MALDEF's associate counsel in Washington, D.C., predicted only
about 500,000 illegals in the entire country would qualify under the immi
gration reform act, passed Friday by Congress.
Federal immigration officials estimate there are 6 million to 12 million
illegal aliens in the United States, and Ernest Gustafson, district director of
the Los Angeles office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said
there are as many as 1.5 million undocumented aliens in Los Angeles and
Orange counties alone.
The reform bill, which is expected to win President Reagan's signature,
calls for penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens and pro
vides temporary legal residency for those who can prove they have been in
the United States continuously since Jan. 1,1982.
Meese organizes porn task force
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin Meese yesterday launched a
nationwide campaign against hard-core pornography, creating a task force
of prosecutors in the Justice Department so that the $8 billion "smut indus
try" can be "pursued with a vengeance and prosecuted to the hilt."
Meese declared there has been an "explosion of obscenity" in the past
15 years in the United States, and he told a news conference he will imple
ment most of the 92 recommendations made in July by the Attorney Gen
eral's Commission on Pornography.
The announcement delighted anti-porn activists and angered civil liber
tarians.
An anti-smut unit of at least a half-dozen federal attorneys will begin
work within 30 days in the Justice Department's criminal division,
prosecuting what Meese said are "organized criminal enterprises that have
taken over the large-scale production and distribution of obscenity."
The targets of the campaign will be child pornography and movies,
magazines or other pornographic depictions of sado-masochism and viol
ent or degrading sexually explicit conduct.
"We are very impressed with the attorney general's response," said the
Rev. Jerry Kirk, president of the National Coalition Against Pornography, a
group of religious leaders. "The focus ... on child pornography and viol
ent, degrading pornography is where ... it needs to be."
But Barry Lynn, legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union,
said at a separate news conference that the "hoopla" surrounding the task
force and the center will frighten people into stopping distribution of
sexual material.
And Lynn argued that establishing anti-porn units within the Justice De
partment could have a "chilling effect" on constitutional rights.
Meese also endorsed a legislative package that would allow prosecutors
to go after the illegal proceeds of obscenity crimes and make it a felony for
porn producers to use performers who are under age 21.
In response, Lynn said those old enough to vote and serve in the military
at 18 would be prohibited "from choosing to be a centerfold at the age of
20."
OPEC truce will prop up prices
BONN, West Germany — The OPEC accord announced yesterday, which
continues restraints on production, shows that the oil cartel's two principal
rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iran, have reached a truce that is likely to prop up
prices at least until December and possibly into next year, oil analysts said.
For coasumers, the new unity in the Organization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries means that there is virtually no hope of a new plunge in
prices for gasoline and heating oil similar to the one experienced earlier
this year. Instead, prices may rise by a few cents a gallon in coming weeks
because of OPEC's agreement to extend production ceilings until Dec. 31
Moreover, OPEC could gradually begin to recover its grip on the world
oil market if the Saudis and Iranians continue to work together, private
analysts said.
"Time is now working in OPEC's favor," Mehdi Varzi, an oil analyst at the
London stockbrokers' firm of Kleinwort Grieveson, said in a telephone in
terview.
OPEC will be able to raise its production, and thus its revenues, by sub
stantial quantities in the spring if it maintains its unity in coming months,
Varzi said.

of prosecutors in the Justice Department so that the $8 billion "smut indus
try" can be "pursued with a vengeance and prosecuted to the hilt."
Meese declared there has been an "explosion of obscenity" in the past
15 years in the United States, and he told a news conference he will imple
ment most of the 92 recommendations made in July by the Attorney Gen
eral's Commission on Pornography.
The announcement delighted anti-porn activists and angered civil liber
tarians.
An anti-smut unit of at least a half-dozen federal attorneys will begin
work within 30 days in the Justice Department's criminal division,
prosecuting what Meese said are "organized criminal enterprises that have
taken over the large-scale production and distribution of obscenity."
The targets of the campaign will be child pornography and movies,
magazines or other pornographic depictions of sado-masochism and viol
ent or degrading sexually explicit conduct.
"We are very impressed with the attorney general's response," said the
Rev. Jerry Kirk, president of the National Coalition Against Pornography, a
group of religious leaders. "The focus ... on child pornography and viol
ent, degrading pornography is where ... it needs to be."
But Barry Lynn, legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union,
said at a separate news conference that the "hoopla" surrounding the task
force and the center will frighten people into stopping distribution of
sexual material.
And Lynn argued that establishing anti-porn units within the Justice De
partment could have a "chilling effect" on constitutional rights.
Meese also endorsed a legislative package that would allow prosecutors
to go after the illegal proceeds of obscenity crimes and make it a felony for
porn producers to use performers who are under age 21.
In response, Lynn said those old enough to vote and serve in the military
at 18 would be prohibited "from choosing to be a centerfold at the age of
20."
OPEC truce will prop up prices
BONN, West Germany — The OPEC accord announced yesterday, which
continues restraints on production, shows that the oil cartel's two principal
rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iran, have reached a truce that is likely to prop up
prices at least until December and possibly into next year, oil analysts said.
For coasumers, the new unity in the Organization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries means that there is virtually no hope of a new plunge in
prices for gasoline and heating oil similar to the one experienced earlier
this year. Instead, prices may rise by a few cents a gallon in coming weeks
because of OPEC's agreement to extend production ceilings until Dec. 31
Moreover, OPEC could gradually begin to recover its grip on the world
oil market if the Saudis and Iranians continue to work together, private
analysts said.
"Time is now working in OPEC's favor," Mehdi Varzi, an oil analyst at the
London stockbrokers' firm of Kleinwort Grieveson, said in a telephone in
terview.
OPEC will be able to raise its production, and thus its revenues, by sub
stantial quantities in the spring if it maintains its unity in coming months,
Varzi said.

Gorbachev pleased with summit
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev told the Soviet public last
night the Iceland summit brought the United States and the Soviet Union
closer to agreement while clearly defining the many obstacles to arms con
trol.
Speaking on national television for the second time since the summit
with President Reagan, Gorbachev said the Oct. 11-12 meetings in Reyk
javik encouraged the Soviet leadership on the possibility of reducing nu
clear arms.
"It was perhaps the first time in many decades that such a big stride was
made in the quest for nuclear disarmament," the Communist Party general
secretary said, according to a Radio Moscow translation of his address.
"I still consider that, as a result of the meeting, we achieved a higher
stage not only in analyzing the situation, but in defining the aims and
framework of possible agreements, agreements on nuclear disarmament,"
he said.
However, Gorbachev said the summit "also threw into bold relief the
difficulties on the way to a nuclear-free world" adding that "circles associ
ated with militarism" were frightened by the progress made in Reykjavik.
In Iceland, the superpowers reached tentative agreement on making
huge cutbacks in their nuclear arsenals. But the agreement floundered
over Reagan's space-based missile defense program known as "Star Wars."
Gorbachev's speech on the evening news program "Vremya" came
hours after the Soviet Union announced it was ordering five more Ameri
can diplomats out of the country. Five U.S. diplomats were ordered ex
pelled Sunday.
The United States on Tuesday ordered the expulsion of 55 Soviet
diplomats.
Church denounces apartheid
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The influential Dutch Reformed
Church, whose religious teachings helped form the ideological basis of
apartheid, declared yesterday that South Africa's system of racial separation
and minority white rule is morally wrong and has done the country' and its
people grievous harm.
Although the church synod stopped short of condemning apartheid as
heresy and a sin, as liberal clerics demanded, its declaration leaves the Na
tional Party government without any moral justification for maintaining a
system in which the white minority continues to exclude three-quarters of
the country's population from political power.
"The church is convinced that forced separation of people cannot be
seen as a prescription from the Bible," synod delegates said in a resolution
adopted in Cape Town. "Such an attempt to justify it from the Bible must be
recognized as an error and rejected.
"The church is convinced that the use of apartheid as a socio-political
system which causes injustice to people and incorrecdy gives one group
preference over the other cannot be accepted on Christian ethical grounds
because it militates against brotherly love and justice, and it inevitably af
fects the human dignity of those involved."
Few aliens will win amnesty
LOS ANGELES — Due to complex requirements under the recently
passed immigration reform bill, only about 500,000 out of as many as 12
million undocumented aliens in the United States will be granted amnesty,
an expert says.
"It's not just a matter of walking into an office and saying, I've been here
illegally since 1982,' " said Mario Moreno of the Mexican-American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund.
"Many people haven't made a point of keeping documentation they
would need to prove they have been in the country that long."
Mareno, MALDEF's associate counsel in Washington, D.C., predicted only
about 500,000 illegals in the entire country would qualify under the immi
gration reform act, passed Friday by Congress.
Federal immigration officials estimate there are 6 million to 12 million
illegal aliens in the United States, and Ernest Gustafson, district director of
the Los Angeles office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said
there are as many as 1.5 million undocumented aliens in Los Angeles and
Orange counties alone.
The reform bill, which is expected to win President Reagan's signature,
calls for penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens and pro
vides temporary legal residency for those who can prove they have been in
the United States continuously since Jan. 1,1982.
