# Reagan signs vast tax overhaul

WASHINGTON â€” With the stroke of several pens
and a renewed vow to oppose tax increases, Presi
dent Reagan signed into law yesterday a far-reaching
tax overhaul that he termed a victory for fairness and
nothing short of a revolution.
"I feel like we've just played the World Series of
tax reform. And the American people won," Reagan
said after using a fistful of pens to put his name to the
879-page bill printed on artificial parchment.
"This is a tax code designed to take us into a future
of technological invention and economic achieve
ment, one that will keep America competitive and
growing into the 21st century," Reagan told an ap
plauding crowd of aides, a dozen members of
Congress and scores of corporate officials invited to
the ceremonies on the White House lawn.
He praised members of Congress and of his ad
ministration who led the fight for the bill, which he
termed "the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code
in our nation's history." He mentioned the two chief
authors of the measure, Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.)
who did not attend, and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski CD-
Ill.) who did.
The new tax plan, which Reagan put at the top of
his second-term agenda, is patterned after the one he

sent to Congress on May 19,1985: significantly lower
tax rates and a tax base broadened by elimination or
reduction of several deductions and exclusions.
Most provisions take effect next Jan. 1, although
many will be phased in gradually. The new law will
cut taxes by an average of 6.1 percent for three
quarters of Americans and raise taxes on corpora
tions by $120 billion over the next five years. By 1988
the top individual tax rate will be cut to 33 percent
from the present 50 percent; the 46 percent maxi
mum corporate rate will drop to 34 percent.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will affect every per
son who pays a federal income tax and sweep onto
the tax rolls many wealthy investors and profitable
corporations that have been able to legally avoid the
Internal Revenue Service through judicious use of
deductions.
More than 20 million couples and individuals, in
cluding several middle-income families whose rate
cuts will not make up for loss of deductions, will face
tax increases in 1987 and beyond.
Some of the deductions that are being curtailed
are the same ones favored by middle-income
families: Individual Retirement Accounts, sales taxes,
consumer interest, medical expenses, union dues

and, for those who do not itemize, charitable contri
butions.
On the other hand, the law gradually raises the
$1,080 personal exemption to $2,000 and substan
tially boosts the standard deduction. One major
result will be to wipe out the income taxes of more
than 6 million working poor.
Analysts are uncertain how the new law will affect
the economy, although there is general agreement it
will slow growth for the near future before promot
ing at least a mild upturn.
Other efforts to revise the tax code have been at
tempted in the past, and significant overhauls were
approved in 1954 and 1969.
Reagan, however, was able to ride an unusual bi
partisan wave that began when Sen. Bill Bradley (D-
N.J.) and Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) each offered a tax
revision proposal in 1982. Reagan's own package
went to Congress in May 1984.
Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, told reporters as he left the White
House that Reagan must now turn his attention to the
deficit.
