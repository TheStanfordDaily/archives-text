# Moscow expels more Americans
## Ousted diplomat total raised to 90, US promises retaliation 
### 
MOSCOW — The Kremlin said yes
terday that five more American
diplomats must leave the country and
withdrew the 260 maids, drivers and
other Soviet workers who handle the
U.S. Embassy's daily non-diplomatic
operations.
Soviet employees may be replaced
by Americans but an overall personnel
limit placed on the embassy and the
U.S. consulate in Leningrad may mean,
for instance, that a choice must be
made between having a cook or a
diplomat.
The Soviet Union seldom uses local
employees in foreign missions. Its
Washington embassy and San Fran
cisco consulate operate almost entirely
with Soviet staff.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gen
nady Gerasimov announced the expul
sions and restrictions the day after 55
Soviet diplomats were ordered out of
the United States.
Gerasimov's announcement brought

to 10 the number of American
diplomats ordered to leave in the cur
rent exchange of expulsions, including
the army and naval attaches.
About an hour after Gerasimov's an
nouncements, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev told the nation in a
televised speech that Tuesday's U.S. ex
pulsion order against 55 Soviet
diplomats was "simply wild."
"Of course we will take reply
measures," he said. "Very tough
measures, so to say, on an equal
footing. We are not going to put up
with such outrageous practices."
Gerasimov said the United States
could replace the 260 translators,
drivers, secretaries, mechanics, maids
and cooks employed in the Moscow
and Leningrad missions only with
Americans.
He said the total number of staff
members must not exceed 225 at the
embassy and 26 at the Leningrad con
sulate, the limits imposed on the Soviet

Embassy and cdhsulate in the United
States.
State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said in making the ex
pulsion announcement Tuesday in
Washington that five Soviets were
being kicked out in retaliation and the
other 50 in order to reduce the Soviet
staffing level to that of the United States
in Moscow and Leningrad.
U.S. Embassy spokesman Jaroslav
Verner said yesterday that 225 Ameri
can diplomats were accredited in Mos
cow and 26 in Leningrad, which means
the diplomatic staff would have to be
reduced to replace Soviet employees.
He would not comment on the ex
pulsions and restrictions.
He identified them as naval attache
Capt. Thomas Holme, army attache
Col. Richard Naab, second secretary
Michael Morgan, third secretary Mi
chael Matera, the human rights officer,
and Leningrad vice consul Daniel

Grossman, who also monitors human
rights.
They were accused of
"impermissible activities," Gerasimov
said, but added that their expulsion
was a response to "anti-Soviet actions"
by the United States.
The spokesman then announced
these restrictions on U.S. diplomatic
activity in the Soviet Union:
Limits on Americans assigned to
temporary duty at the embassy and
consulate to the same number of So
viet assignments permitted in the
United States.
Limitation on staffs of the embassy
and consulate to correspond with the
225 and 26 allowed the Soviets in the
United States.
American diplomats may have only
as many guests in the Soviet Union as
Soviet diplomats have in the United
States.
