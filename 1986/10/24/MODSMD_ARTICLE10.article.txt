# September prices increase .3 percent

WASHINGTON — Consumer prices
rose a moderate 0.3 percent in Sep
tember, thereby triggering a Social Se
curity benefit increase of 1.3 percent
next year, the smallest such increase
since benefits first were linked to the
cost of living in 1975, the government
said yesterday.
Inflation so far this year has been
only 0.6 percent, thanks to the collapse
in oil prices that stabilized this sum
mer, the Department of Labor said. But
even with energy prices flat instead of
falling, economists see inflation at a
modest 3 percent to 3 5 percent annual
rate for the next year or so.
When Social Security benefits first
were linked to a version of the Con
sumer Price Index in the inflationary
19705, Congress decreed that the na
tion's 3.7 million Social Security
beneficiaries would get no increase if
inflation fell below the then unheard
of rate of 3 percent a year — and for
most of that period the annual in
creases averaged more than 6 percent,
with a high of 14.3 percent in 1980.
But this year, faced with abnormally
low inflation in a year of a 22.6 percent
deflation in oil prices and declining
prices for other commodities,
Congress abolished the 3 percent floor

in one of its last actions before ad
journing. President Reagan signed that
repeal into law Tuesday when he
signed the massive omnibus spending
bill.
Before seasonal adjustment, the
Consumer Price Index, from which the
Deparment of Labor computes
monthly price changes, rose by 1.6 to
330.2 in September. The index is
developed from a base of 100 in 1967,
meaning that a selected cross-section
of consumer goods costing $100 in
1967 now costs $330.20.
Meanwhile, in other favorable eco
nomic reports yesterday, the Depart
ment of Commerce said that orders for
durable goods, often a benchmark of
future industrial activity, rebounded by
an unexpectedly strong 4.9 percent in
September. The department also re
ported that the personal income of
Americans advanced a modest 0.3 per
cent for the month, even while spend
ing on consumer goods, boosted by
concessionary auto finance offers,
surged by 1.6 percent.
President Reagan hailed the report
on durable goods orders as proof that
the economy was at last shaking off the
sluggishness of the past few months.
