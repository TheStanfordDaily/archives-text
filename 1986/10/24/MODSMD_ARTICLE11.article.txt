# Minorities are at greater AIDS risk

WASHINGTON â€” Blacks and
Hispanics account for four out of 10
AIDS cases in the United States and
are far more likely to get the deadly
disease than white Americans, ac
cording to a report released yester
day by the federal Centers for
Disease Control.
"Blacks and Hispanics are being
disproportionately affected by the
epidemic," said Dr. Harold Jaffe,
chief of the CDC's AIDS epidemiol
ogy program. "In minority popula
tions, AIDS is a disease particularly
affecting male and female in
travenous drug users, their sexual
partners and their children."
"This issue has been largely un
appreciated. The stereotype of AIDS
is that it's a disease of middle-class
white men. That has prevented
people from seeing it as also a
minority health problem," said Dr.
Harold Jaffe, chief of the CDC's
AIDS epidemiology program.
The CDC report noted that of the
more than 24,500 cases of AIDS re
ported in the U.S. in the last five
years, about 6,200, or 25 percent,
were black and about 3,500, or 14

percent, were Hispanic. Yet blacks
comprise only 12 and Hispanics 6
percent of the overall U.S. popula
tion.
Some communities were hardest
hit, with about two-thirds of all
black and Hispanic AIDS cases in
New York, New Jersey or Florida.
Once they get AIDS, blacks and
Hispanics may also die of the
disease more quickly than whites,
said Dr. Beny Primm, a black
physician who heads the Addiction
Research and Treatment Corpora
tion in Brooklyn. He said that
minority AIDS victims are often
"debilitated when they come in, so
bothered by so many health prob
lems, wait so late to get help, and
cannot get proper health care."
The new CDC statistics show that
among adult AIDS patients, the
majority of cases are still among
white homosexual and bisexual
males. But looking at rates per mil
lion people affected, blacks and
Hispanics are more than three
times as likely as whites nationwide
to get the disease.
