## Messenger For Peace

An endless road. Letting oneself
be pushed by the mob; letting
oneself be dragged along by a blind
destiny When the SS became tired,
they were changed But no one
changed us. Our limbs numb with
cold despite the running, our
throats parched, famished, breath
less, on we went.
We were masters of nature,
masters of the world. We had forgot
ten everything — death, fatigue, our
natural needs. Stronger than cold
or hunger, stronger than the shots
and the desire, condemned and
wandering, mere numbers, we were
the only men on earth
I first read Elie Wiesel's "Night"
for a fifth grade Sunday school
class. As Wiesel would wish, I have
never forgotten the terrifying ac
count of his ordeal in Nazi concen
tration camps.
Wiesel has used his experiences
to serve as a witness against forget -
fulness, to fight violence and hatred
and to affirm hope and love. In ad
dition to keeping his memories of
the Holocaust alive, he has become
a champion of those who suffer
today — victims of oppression in
Cambodia, South Africa, the Soviet
Union.
Last week, Wiesel was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Elie Wiesel has emerged as one

of the most important spiritual
leaders and guides in an age where
violence, repression and racism
continue to characterize the
world," the Nobel committee's
statement said.
"Wiesel is a messenger to
mankind. His message is one of
peace, atonement and human dig
nity. His belief that the forces fight
ing evil in the world can be victori
ous is a hard-won belief.
"Wiesel's commitment, which
originated in the sufferings of the
Jewish people, has been widened to
embrace all oppressed peoples and
races."
Wiesel, 58, has written 25 books
since "Night" and continues to
lecture (beautifully) and to write
editorial articles on various sub
jects.
After learning that he had won
the Nobel prize last week, he left
for the Soviet Union to campaign
for improved human rights.
Finally, Wiesel dedicated his
Nobel prize to the survivors of the
Nazis for teaching "humankind how
not to succumb to despair."
I would like to offer Elie Wiesel
as my choice for Stanford's 1987
commencement speaker. I ask the
senior class presidents to consider
forwarding the recommendation to
University President Donald Ken
nedy.
