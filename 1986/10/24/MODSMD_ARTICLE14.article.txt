# Research seeks to end crib death
## 
### 
Stanford University Medical Center researcher Dr.
Ronald Ariagno is trying a new tack in solving the
mystery of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
While most SIDS research has centered around the
cardiovascular and respiratory systems, Ariagno
thinks the real answer lies in a largely overlooked
area, the development of infants' nervous systems.
SIDS is commonly known as "crib death'' because
in classic SIDS cases, parents will tuck an apparently
healthy baby into bed at night only to find their child
dead in the crib in the morning. The deaths are both
sudden and unexpected, and their causes aren't de
tected by autopsies.
Between 7,000 and 10,000 deaths are attributed to
SIDS each year, making it the primary cause of death
in U.S. children between one month and one year of
age.
Ariagno, associate professor of pediatrics, will col
laborate with Steve Glotzbach, a sleep researcher
and physiologist, to research various functions con
trolled by the nervous system and their possible role
in SIDS. Ariagno plans to study approximately 50
babies a year for a five-year period.
The subject infants will include both premature
and full-term babies. However, Ariagno plans to
focus on premature infants because their nervous
systems are less mature and may reveal more about
how the systems develop. Also, premature infants are
at a significantly greater risk for SIDS.
The study itself should pose no threat to the infants
because Ariagno plans only to monitor their vital
signs and then relate those signs to sleep patterns

and the development of the nervous systems.
"From looking at what happens to the nervous sys
tem from 28 weeks to term, we hope to learn what
developmental achievements are present, when
those achievements aren't there, what significance
they have to the baby's ability to respond, and their
importance in understanding the lethal vulnerability
of that infant," Ariagno explain.
An analysis of risk for SIDS among premature in
fants born at Stanford over the past 20 years found
that early-born infants weighing less than 1,500
grams (3 3 pounds) at birth were in the highest risk
category. The incidence of SIDS in that group was 1
to 2 percent, about 10 times as high as the one to two
deaths per 1,000 in the general population.
Ariagno suggested why premature infants are at
greater risk. "In a nervous system from a baby of 28
weeks' gestation (three months premature), environ
mental cues from the mother are withdrawn; they're
not there," he said.
"The baby is essentially in an artificial environ
ment which may be non-optimal for the developing
nervous system."
Pending handing sources for Ariagno's research in
clude the National Center for the Prevention of SIDS
and the National Institutes of Health. Until the money
is available,' Ariagno will launch pilot projects to
begin his research with funds from a SIDS benefit
being planned to support his studies. The benefit is
being organized by Gretchen Cebrian, a San Fran
cisco public relations executive who lost her six
month-old son to SIDS last March.

Cebrian expects 300 to 400 people to attend the
$200-a-person, black tie dinner-dance at San Fran
cisco's Fairmont Hotel on Nov. 6. Besides providing
initial funding for Ariagno's project, the benefit is in
tended to increase public awareness about the prob
lem of SIDS.
Dr. Ariagno said there is a general belief among re
searchers that a large percentage of SIDS cases result
from apnea, "the interuption of the normal breathing
rhythm long enough to cause changes in oxygen and
slowing of the heart."
Ariagno said he does not dispute this hypothesis.
However, he does plan to shift his focus from tradi
tional SIDS research on the cardiovascular and res
piratory sytems to the nervous system.
"The primary causes of apnea and the factors
which modulate respiratory control in the newly
born infant are what really need to be examined in
greater detail," he said. He added that his research
will attempt to discover if "the mechanisms for SIDS
are in the nervous system, and especially the brain
stem ... as it relates to the control of breathing, tem
perature regulation, circadian rhythmicity and
arousal state control.
"We know there's some problem with breathing,
some problem with perhaps regulation of tempera
ture, that it occurs during sleep, and primarily at
night or early morning. What we'd like to do is to
consider all of these factors and to examine the im
portance of the day-night (circadian) organization of
the nervous system."
