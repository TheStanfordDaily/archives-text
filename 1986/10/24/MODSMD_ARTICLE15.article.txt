## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Dry Rush needed 
### 
For two years, Stanford has been trying to persuade
fraternities to ban alcohol from Rush activities. So far, the
University has failed.
That's too bad. Alcohol need not be a part of Rush, and
Rush would be better off without it.
The purpose of Rush is selection: The process is sub
jective and revolves around value judgments. Alcohol
has no place in it.
Fraternity members should not choose future
housemates and friends while under the influence of a
drug that impairs judgment and distorts behavior. It's
easy to get drunk and have fun with almost anyone. How
deep is that friendship when the drinking is over?
And for most, if not all, rushees, the drinking is illegal.
Serving alcohol to those under 21 is prohibited, and fra
ternities are breaking state law when they serve alcohol
to the underage rushees.
Sure, alcohol is served at other parties throughout the
year, but those parties are not exclusively aimed at the
underage. Rush parties are, and whether or not that's in
tentional is irrelevant.
Alcohol is also expensive, not only in dollars, but in

the amount of trouble it causes as well. Rush brings
more than its share of drunkenness, difficult-to-control
parties and, too often, violence. Guidelines have been
laid down in efforts to control parties and partygoers' be
havior. But they don't appear to be working. Witness last
spring when three freshman — all of whom had been
drinking at Rush parties — became involved in a fight
that resulted in multiple injuries, suspensions from
school, a criminal case and a lawsuit.
While not all fraternities should be blamed for such
incidents, the University is justified in feeling that all
must take further preventive actions.
During last Friday's forum, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons told the fraternities: "Gentlemen, I think it's
a significant question as to whether you're going to enjoy
the self-esteem that comes with deciding for yourselves
to have a 100 percent dry Rush or whether you're going
to see here what has happened at virtually every other
major university where someone else has had to make
that decision."
Fraternities should make Rush dry. And if they don't,
the University should.
