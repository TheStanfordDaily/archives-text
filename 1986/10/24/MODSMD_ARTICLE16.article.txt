Feminists pay
for taking stand
Good start, Mr. Gofen. You're right:
very few Stanford students choose to
call themselves feminists or speak out
for equality, however supportive they
may be of those issues behind closed
doors. But have you noticed how few
Stanford students choose to call them
selves anything? Or to speak out for
anything? Your article on the fate of
feminists only touches upon a much
larger issue: the wages of adopting
any kind of definite position on this
campus. I call your attention to the
article on Lockdown Lockheed that
appeared with your piece in the Oct.
21 Daily: "My biggest reaction (to the
protest)," an observer was quoted as
saying, "was the absence of interest."
There is a classic double bind
facing any political group here that
you skip over. You're on the right
track when you cite the radical stance
of feminist groups on campus as a
major factor in their alienation from
the population as a whole. But take a
step back. I would cite their alienation
as the biggest factor in their evolution
toward a radical stance. You're not
likely to be heard anywhere if you
whisper; I think it is just about time to
ask why one need stand nude in front
of Green Library, juggling live water
buffaloes and whistling Beethoven's
Fifth to be heard here.
Might one ask if feminism's preva
lence or absence is solely the respon
sibility of the women at Stanford? I
know a few men who might feel
otherwise.

The Daily's "house ad" exhorting
the Boston Red Sox (Daily, Oct. 22)
seems to indicate the need to discuss
so-Gilled "arrogance" in professional
sports.
While visiting friends at various

points around campus during the
League Championship Series and the
World Series, I have encountered a
disproportionate amount of disdain
directed towards the New York Mets,
another so-called "arrogant New York
team." This perception of the Mets as
an arrogant team is both unfounded
and irrelevant and is used by baseball
fans to disguise the anger and jealousy
they feel toward the Mets' dominating
1986 season.
There is a difference between
enthusiastic intensity and arrogance;
players like Gary Carter and Len
Dykstra merely play with a much
higher degree of intensity than many
other baseball players. This enthusi
asm is seen as arrogance by many
who disliked watching Len Dykstra
make his customary, enthusiastic Shea
curtain call after his game-winning
homer in the NLCS, or Gary Carter
gesticulate enthusiastically following a
particularly excellent pitch from Jesse
Orosco.
It is also interesting to note that
many so-called "Red Sox fans"
emerged after the California Angels
lost the ALCS, leaving no choice but to
cheer on the Sox to beat "those arro
gant New Yorkers," of whom many,
incidentally, hail from California
(Carter, Hernandez, Dykstra, Straw
berry, Mitchell, Ojeda).
When all is said and done, it seems
that the disproportionate amount of
support that the 1986 Red Sox enjoy
on the Stanford campus is a direct
result of jealousy directed towards the
Mets, the truly dominant team of the
1986 season.

Sophomore, history
Reality warrants
striving for best
Warning to squeamish students:
harsh reality follows. Society is, by its
very nature, discriminatory. Young
boys who are too frail to make the
football team suffer. Students who are
not bright and who have not obtained
good grades do not get admitted to
Stanford, and they suffer. Why are

these sufferings so different than the
suffering of ugly persons who will
never be placed on calendars?
Few of us are great, or achieve
greatness, fortuitously. While these
few float through life, the rest of us
must work at being great. We go to
gyms because society values fitness.
We study for tests because society
values the "honor roll." Further, we
buy cosmetics and soap and tooth
paste because society values beauty.
Is it wrong? Are women harmed by
emphasis on looks? Are men harmed
by emphasis on strength? Are the
stupid sent on a negative spiral be
cause society values intelligence? If we
stop these, where do we go from
here? King Solomon said that every art
arose as competition between a man
and his fellow, and that all was vanity;
but let's be realistic, we live in society.
Thus, we must strive to do our best
with what we have.
As for beauty, flaws due to lack of a
natural physical endowment are much
easier cured or hidden than a lack of
intellect, as there is no product which
will make one smart.
So, all of you who are not perfect in
every way, keep striving, or "punt" it
all and live on a mountain (or maybe
at Berkeley?) but don't whine that "all
pictures of women are pornographic,"
and that society values only beauty.

World Series, I have encountered a
disproportionate amount of disdain
directed towards the New York Mets,
another so-called "arrogant New York
team." This perception of the Mets as
an arrogant team is both unfounded
and irrelevant and is used by baseball
fans to disguise the anger and jealousy
they feel toward the Mets' dominating
1986 season.
There is a difference between
enthusiastic intensity and arrogance;
players like Gary Carter and Len
Dykstra merely play with a much
higher degree of intensity than many
other baseball players. This enthusi
asm is seen as arrogance by many
who disliked watching Len Dykstra
make his customary, enthusiastic Shea
curtain call after his game-winning
homer in the NLCS, or Gary Carter
gesticulate enthusiastically following a
particularly excellent pitch from Jesse
Orosco.
It is also interesting to note that
many so-called "Red Sox fans"
emerged after the California Angels
lost the ALCS, leaving no choice but to
cheer on the Sox to beat "those arro
gant New Yorkers," of whom many,
incidentally, hail from California
(Carter, Hernandez, Dykstra, Straw
berry, Mitchell, Ojeda).
When all is said and done, it seems
that the disproportionate amount of
support that the 1986 Red Sox enjoy
on the Stanford campus is a direct
result of jealousy directed towards the
Mets, the truly dominant team of the
1986 season.

Reality warrants
striving for best
Warning to squeamish students:
harsh reality follows. Society is, by its
very nature, discriminatory. Young
boys who are too frail to make the
football team suffer. Students who are
not bright and who have not obtained
good grades do not get admitted to
Stanford, and they suffer. Why are

these sufferings so different than the
suffering of ugly persons who will
never be placed on calendars?
Few of us are great, or achieve
greatness, fortuitously. While these
few float through life, the rest of us
must work at being great. We go to
gyms because society values fitness.
We study for tests because society
values the "honor roll." Further, we
buy cosmetics and soap and tooth
paste because society values beauty.
Is it wrong? Are women harmed by
emphasis on looks? Are men harmed
by emphasis on strength? Are the
stupid sent on a negative spiral be
cause society values intelligence? If we
stop these, where do we go from
here? King Solomon said that every art
arose as competition between a man
and his fellow, and that all was vanity;
but let's be realistic, we live in society.
Thus, we must strive to do our best
with what we have.
As for beauty, flaws due to lack of a
natural physical endowment are much
easier cured or hidden than a lack of
intellect, as there is no product which
will make one smart.
So, all of you who are not perfect in
every way, keep striving, or "punt" it
all and live on a mountain (or maybe
at Berkeley?) but don't whine that "all
pictures of women are pornographic,"
and that society values only beauty.

Feminists pay
for taking stand
Good start, Mr. Gofen. You're right:
very few Stanford students choose to
call themselves feminists or speak out
for equality, however supportive they
may be of those issues behind closed
doors. But have you noticed how few
Stanford students choose to call them
selves anything? Or to speak out for
anything? Your article on the fate of
feminists only touches upon a much
larger issue: the wages of adopting
any kind of definite position on this
campus. I call your attention to the
article on Lockdown Lockheed that
appeared with your piece in the Oct.
21 Daily: "My biggest reaction (to the
protest)," an observer was quoted as
saying, "was the absence of interest."
There is a classic double bind
facing any political group here that
you skip over. You're on the right
track when you cite the radical stance
of feminist groups on campus as a
major factor in their alienation from
the population as a whole. But take a
step back. I would cite their alienation
as the biggest factor in their evolution
toward a radical stance. You're not
likely to be heard anywhere if you
whisper; I think it is just about time to
ask why one need stand nude in front
of Green Library, juggling live water
buffaloes and whistling Beethoven's
Fifth to be heard here.
Might one ask if feminism's preva
lence or absence is solely the respon
sibility of the women at Stanford? I
know a few men who might feel
otherwise.

Red Sox fans
jealous of Mets
The Daily's "house ad" exhorting
the Boston Red Sox (Daily, Oct. 22)
seems to indicate the need to discuss
so-Gilled "arrogance" in professional
sports.

points around campus during the
League Championship Series and the
World Series, I have encountered a
