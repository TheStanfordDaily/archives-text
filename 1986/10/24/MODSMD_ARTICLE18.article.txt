# Peace can't happen overnight
## 
### 
The Daniloff case had just been settled, after a long public
stand by the Reagan administration on the issue, and the
ground was set for the summit meeting with the Soviet Un
ion in Iceland. Recall that the previous Geneva summit was
preceded by a long controversy over the spy dust case and
an equally tough stand then. In each case, then and now, the
summit was preceded by strong posturing on the part of the
United States vis-a-vis the Soviet Union in an exaggerated
conflict. It is possible that some in the Reagan administra
tion felt it necessary to build up to the summit by heighten
ing tensions for greater overall political impact of the sum
mit. The summit would then be a climax to the build-up of
tensions and a characteristic relief would follow.

For his part, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also played
his cards well in this political game. He brought to Iceland
an arms control proposal that would place SDI at the center
of the table. In fact, he made sure his proposals dominated
the meeting. Either way, Gorbachev couldn't lose: If Reagan
accepted the offer, this would retire SDI for a while at least;
if Reagan didn't — and possibly Gorbachev calculated that
the offer was such that Reagan would have to refuse — then
Gorbachev could get great political mileage out of the sum
mit. "Star Wars" would be an obstacle to arms control and
everyone would blame the United States.
It is difficult to speculate on the intentions of the two par
ties coming into the meeting. These are just some of the
possibilities, since we don't really know what went on be
hind the scenes. The question does come up, though: Are
the summits good for anything beyond politics? One would
like to believe that there is value in a summit meeting and
that the two men negotiated "in good faith" in Iceland.
However, we have yet to be convinced of that. The public
can only respond to what the two parties are saying, and his
tory will judge Reagan and Gorbachev according to their ac
tions.
As expected, each side has blamed the other for the
"failure" of the summit — assuming, of course, that either
side expected something from it. This time, however, there
seems to be a consensus in all reports from Iceland that the
10 year limit on SDI testing and deployment was a stum
bling block. So it appears that a grand agreement to rid the
world of nuclear weapons was passed up because of mutual
stubborness over SDI. Neither side was willing to compro
mise on this issue.
Suffice it to say at this point that each side has its fair share
of proponents and opponents. The conclusion of some is
that Reagan blew it: From a position of advantage in negotia
tion, he was unwilling to give up anything, and that made an
agreement impossible. What many thought was the
"quintessential bargaining chip" was not up for bargain.
Others are sighing with relief that Reagan didn't give away
SDI. In fact, the rhetoric coming from the post-Iceland
Reagan administration is that it was SDI that brought Gorba
chev to the negotiating table and made him give up so much
there. The zero-option on missies in Europe without the
French and British nuclear forces, the counting of strategic
bombers, banning of nuclear tests and reduction of missiles

in Asia were all issues on which Gorbachev was now willing
to compromise and even accept the U.S. position. No one
would have expected this Soviets' new position a year ago,
and it was here now thanks to SDI. And so, this logic contin
ues, if one could squeeze this much out of the Soviets, why
not even more? Why accept the first offer when they'll come
begging for disarmament again? Such reasoning is little
more than betting on the Soviet Union's inability to keep up
with the arms race. This position assumes that the Soviet Un
ion can be pushed out of competition for economic
reasons, and therefore will ultimately accept a position of
inferiority. Recent history of negotiations does not support
this. In fact, conventional negotiating logic would say that no
agreement can be made until the Soviets reach a position of
parity — i.e. build up their own SDI effort of equal respect.
Only then could negotiation be possible and then the vi
cious cycle of arms build-up would continue.
However, a greater danger from the Iceland summit is the
notion that the world was at "the brink of peace." We have
been told that "breathtaking" proposals were put forth and
that the two sides were close — closer than ever before —
to reaching a grandiose agreement. The promise is held out
that "it can still happen," and "no doors are closed." In
short, we have been told that a miracle could have hap
pened and could still happen: Peace is around the corner.
Common sense tells us, on the other hand, that peace
does not break out like war; it will not come overnight. We
need to build peace slowly and preserve it over time. To ex
pea a miraculous agreement from two men in a marathon
meeting is to be misled. Even if Reagan or Gorbachev were
willing to compromise on SDI, they could not have agreed
to disarmament immediately. How can one side disarm and
at the same time expel the other side's diplomats, speak of
"cheating" in the same breath as "sharing of technologies
for mutual defense?" Peace cannot be brought about in an
atmosphere of mistrust and hostility. The Soviet Union and
the U.S. must reach a position of mutual understanding. This
work cannot be done by two men. The foundations for
peace must be built by all of us; and that peace is peace
through dialogue, not military strength. We need to think in
terms of long-term objectives and build political, economic
and cultural connections to facilitate a dialogue and an ex
change. And then we need to convert the military
economies to peaceful uses.
We shouldn't be lulled by media presentations that there
were any missed opportunities in Iceland. The only positive
effect that could have come from Iceland is to bring the two
leaders closer together. Early indications are that it didn't
happen. Everyone hopes, of course, that Reagan and Gorba
chev can agree on as much as is possible, but it is a danger
ous illusion to believe that they can reach peace through
arms control negotiation alone. Similarly, one cannot
achieve peace through technological breakthroughs.
The two men met in Iceland perhaps equally prescient
that they wouldn't reach a grand agreement immediately:
Their countries have strained and pulled too far apart for
Reagan and Gorbachev to bridge the gap instantly. The con
tradictions are too real and apparent: In the words of
Einstein, "You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare
for war."

For his part, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also played
his cards well in this political game. He brought to Iceland
an arms control proposal that would place SDI at the center
of the table. In fact, he made sure his proposals dominated
the meeting. Either way, Gorbachev couldn't lose: If Reagan
accepted the offer, this would retire SDI for a while at least;
if Reagan didn't — and possibly Gorbachev calculated that
the offer was such that Reagan would have to refuse — then
Gorbachev could get great political mileage out of the sum
mit. "Star Wars" would be an obstacle to arms control and
everyone would blame the United States.
It is difficult to speculate on the intentions of the two par
ties coming into the meeting. These are just some of the
possibilities, since we don't really know what went on be
hind the scenes. The question does come up, though: Are
the summits good for anything beyond politics? One would
like to believe that there is value in a summit meeting and
that the two men negotiated "in good faith" in Iceland.
However, we have yet to be convinced of that. The public
can only respond to what the two parties are saying, and his
tory will judge Reagan and Gorbachev according to their ac
tions.
As expected, each side has blamed the other for the
"failure" of the summit — assuming, of course, that either
side expected something from it. This time, however, there
seems to be a consensus in all reports from Iceland that the
10 year limit on SDI testing and deployment was a stum
bling block. So it appears that a grand agreement to rid the
world of nuclear weapons was passed up because of mutual
stubborness over SDI. Neither side was willing to compro
mise on this issue.
Suffice it to say at this point that each side has its fair share
of proponents and opponents. The conclusion of some is
that Reagan blew it: From a position of advantage in negotia
tion, he was unwilling to give up anything, and that made an
agreement impossible. What many thought was the
"quintessential bargaining chip" was not up for bargain.
Others are sighing with relief that Reagan didn't give away
SDI. In fact, the rhetoric coming from the post-Iceland
Reagan administration is that it was SDI that brought Gorba
chev to the negotiating table and made him give up so much
there. The zero-option on missies in Europe without the
French and British nuclear forces, the counting of strategic
bombers, banning of nuclear tests and reduction of missiles

in Asia were all issues on which Gorbachev was now willing
to compromise and even accept the U.S. position. No one
would have expected this Soviets' new position a year ago,
and it was here now thanks to SDI. And so, this logic contin
ues, if one could squeeze this much out of the Soviets, why
not even more? Why accept the first offer when they'll come
begging for disarmament again? Such reasoning is little
more than betting on the Soviet Union's inability to keep up
with the arms race. This position assumes that the Soviet Un
ion can be pushed out of competition for economic
reasons, and therefore will ultimately accept a position of
inferiority. Recent history of negotiations does not support
this. In fact, conventional negotiating logic would say that no
agreement can be made until the Soviets reach a position of
parity — i.e. build up their own SDI effort of equal respect.
Only then could negotiation be possible and then the vi
cious cycle of arms build-up would continue.
However, a greater danger from the Iceland summit is the
notion that the world was at "the brink of peace." We have
been told that "breathtaking" proposals were put forth and
that the two sides were close — closer than ever before —
to reaching a grandiose agreement. The promise is held out
that "it can still happen," and "no doors are closed." In
short, we have been told that a miracle could have hap
pened and could still happen: Peace is around the corner.
Common sense tells us, on the other hand, that peace
does not break out like war; it will not come overnight. We
need to build peace slowly and preserve it over time. To ex
pea a miraculous agreement from two men in a marathon
meeting is to be misled. Even if Reagan or Gorbachev were
willing to compromise on SDI, they could not have agreed
to disarmament immediately. How can one side disarm and
at the same time expel the other side's diplomats, speak of
"cheating" in the same breath as "sharing of technologies
for mutual defense?" Peace cannot be brought about in an
atmosphere of mistrust and hostility. The Soviet Union and
the U.S. must reach a position of mutual understanding. This
work cannot be done by two men. The foundations for
peace must be built by all of us; and that peace is peace
through dialogue, not military strength. We need to think in
terms of long-term objectives and build political, economic
and cultural connections to facilitate a dialogue and an ex
change. And then we need to convert the military
economies to peaceful uses.
We shouldn't be lulled by media presentations that there
were any missed opportunities in Iceland. The only positive
effect that could have come from Iceland is to bring the two
leaders closer together. Early indications are that it didn't
happen. Everyone hopes, of course, that Reagan and Gorba
chev can agree on as much as is possible, but it is a danger
ous illusion to believe that they can reach peace through
arms control negotiation alone. Similarly, one cannot
achieve peace through technological breakthroughs.
The two men met in Iceland perhaps equally prescient
that they wouldn't reach a grand agreement immediately:
Their countries have strained and pulled too far apart for
Reagan and Gorbachev to bridge the gap instantly. The con
tradictions are too real and apparent: In the words of
Einstein, "You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare
for war."

The Daniloff case had just been settled, after a long public
stand by the Reagan administration on the issue, and the
ground was set for the summit meeting with the Soviet Un
ion in Iceland. Recall that the previous Geneva summit was
preceded by a long controversy over the spy dust case and
an equally tough stand then. In each case, then and now, the
summit was preceded by strong posturing on the part of the
United States vis-a-vis the Soviet Union in an exaggerated
conflict. It is possible that some in the Reagan administra
tion felt it necessary to build up to the summit by heighten
ing tensions for greater overall political impact of the sum
