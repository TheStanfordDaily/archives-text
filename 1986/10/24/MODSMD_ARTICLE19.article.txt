# Students will not ignore apartheid
## 
### 
I'd like to address Victor Vescovo's viewpoint
regarding apartheid (Daily, Oct. 15) and try to answer
to some of his purported concern about the divest
ment issue.
First, the anti-apartheid student movement is not a
"student obsession" which developed "over the last
two years.' Over 20 years ago, the Black Student Un
ion at Stanford began its continuous call for total di
vestment from the trustees. In 1977, nine years ago,
294 Stanford students were arrested for a sit-in in
Old Union in their call for divestment, an action
more extreme than any which has since happened
on the Stanford campus. The South African issue, Mr.
Vescovo, is hardly a new phenomenon, but rather a
long tradition of struggle by students to demonstrate
to the Board of Trustees that divestment is a moral
imperative.

A.s for the next question: "Why South Africa?" My
answer for you is that there is little that students at
this University can personally do, besides writing let
ters for the release of political prisoners through Am
nesty International or contributing to funds that
sponsor humanitarian aid, which will change the sit
uation in countries like Afghanistan or the Soviet Un
ion South Africa is a unique case in which institu
tions like Stanford University can take action which
will directly put pressure on the government of
South Africa to change the system of apartheid In no
way do I or the other students who protest apartheid
in South Africa mean to belittle the problems of
other countries. I am just as concerned about human
rights violations and discrimination in Afghanistan,

the Soviet Union, Ethiopia, Chile and Cm
am about apartheid in South Africa, and I heartily
urge Mr. Vescovo to inform me — or better yet, or
ganize and mobilize the student body — to take ad
vantage of any opportunities we have to better the sit
uation in those parts of the world as well.
As to the question "Why divestment?" there' are
many reasons. To begin with, if Stanford really did
use its position as a stockholder to actively lobby

companies involved in South Africa, I might be in
clined to consider his argument that we should in
crease, not reduce, our holdings in corporations that
do business in South Africa. And if I saw evidence of
these corporations lobbying the South African gov
ernment to change the apartheid system, or spending
anything near to half the amount they pay in taxes to

the South African government to provide educational
opportunities and humanitarian aid to black, colored
and Indian South Africans, or demonstrating that the
Sullivan Principles do have a positive effect on the
lives of South African blacks, I would consider listen
ing to his stance that "the presence of American cor
porations has a positive effect in the country." But
none of these things are happening. The fact of the
matter is that Stanford does not actively lobby the
companies in which it invests, and corporations in
South Africa play a net negative role by supporting
the current racist regime with taxes, products and
tacit acceptance of the apartheid system.
What divestment will do is make a statement —
both to the companies we currently invest in and to
the South .African government — that we will not
tolerate apartheid. As Bishop Tutu, members of the
African National Congress and black South African
students have repeatedly said to the Stanford com
munity, divestment and sanctions will speed up the
process of dismantling apartheid. It will put pressure
on the Botha government and give an incentive from
the world community for change. By itself, Stanford
divestment will not rid South Africa of apartheid, but
when combined with the added divestment of other
universities, states and municipalities across the
country, it can help South Africa in its struggle for
freedom.
"Is South Africa still the most important issue?" I
don't think it matters whether it is the most impor
tant issue facing students today or not. However,
whenever people are being systematically oppressed
for any reason in the world, it is an important issue,
and I would hope that Vescovo would rejoice that
students are trying to make a difference by fighting
apartheid than apathetically ignoring it.
