# Two companies disinvest from South Africa

### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Warner Communications Group and Honeywell Inc., cor
porations in which Stanford owns $12.7 million of stock, say
they are selling their South Africa operations.
The announcements came days after IBM and General
Motors announced plans earlier this week to withdraw from
South Africa. When finalized, the four pullouts will reduce
the value of Stanford's South Africa-related portfolio from
$184 million to about $142 million.
Warner Communications, which is Stanford's fifth-most
valuable investment related to South Africa, announced its
plans Wednesday. The University owns $12.4 million of
stock in Warner Communications, which, in its South Africa
operation, sells records, sheet music and home videos.
Spokesman Geoffrey Holmes said Warner Communica
tions will probably continue to distribute records in South
Africa. The subsidiary has about 30 percent of the South
African record market, Holmes said.
The company also owns 50 percent of a film distribution
firm. "We are talking with our partners about what to do
about that position," Holmes told The New York Times.
Of Warner Communications' 112 South African
employees, 57 are black or colored. In 1985, the Johannes
burg subsidiary earned the highest rating possible on the
Sullivan Principles, a code that rates American companies'
racial practices in South Africa.
Honeywell is "considering various options for the sale of
its South Africa affiliate," according to a statement released
yesterday by Markos Tambkeras, managing director of
Honeywell South Africa.
Honeywell could not be reached for comment on its
future sales policies in South Africa.
Stanford has $363,375 invested in Honeywell, the fourth
largest computer company in the United States.
Honeywell South Africa employs 176 people in South
Africa, 41 of them black or colored, and earned the top Sul
livan rating in 1985. It is also a member of the American
Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Corporate Council on
South Africa, organizations that lobby the South African gov
ernment for changes in its racial policies.
The Honeywell subsidiary, headquartered in Johannes
burg, sells and services controls for commercial buildings
and industrial plants. It was established in 1969.
