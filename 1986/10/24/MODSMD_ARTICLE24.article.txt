Creativity.
It's sought after. It's envied. And few
people think they have enough of it.
But take heart, all ye weary
creativity-seekers, for creativity may he
inherent in all of us.
Yes, each and every last person on
this earth may possess an "inner crea
tive resource" or "essence."
So says Graduate School of Business
Prof. Michael Ray in his recently
released book, "Creativity in Busi
ness."
The product of a three-year col
laboration with co-author Rochelle
Myers, founder of the Myers Institute
for Creative Studies in San Francisco
and a former GSB professor,
"Creativity in Business" is based on a
popular GSB course of the same name,
originally taught jointly by Ray and
Myers.
One of the reasons for writing the
book, says Ray, was to make the ideas
taught in the Creativity in Business

course at Stanford available to the gen
eral public.
The class is exclusively for students
enrolled in the GSB, and because of its
seminar set-up, only 40 students are
allowed per class. Generally, three or
four times that number of students
want to take the class.
Ray offers a simple explanation of
the course s aims.
"We try to develop people's
creativity so they'll be consistently cre
ative," he says.
Ray and Myers have their students
live with certain credos each week to
help them break out of traditional
methods of approaching their lives.
One such credo is "Destroy judg
ment, create curiosity."
According to Ray, every person has
inside him a voice of judgment which
"condemns, criticizes, attaches blame,
makes fun of, puts down, assigns guilt,
passes sentence on, punishes and
buries anything that's the least bit
unlike a mythical norm."
In order to unleash the full power of

one's creative essence, he says, a per
son must silence that voice of judg
ment and let himself do what he
really wants to do regardless of the fears
lurking in his mind â€” these inhibi
tions are only stumbling blocks thrown
up by the voice of judgment.

'Creativity is essen
tial for health and
happiness, as well
as success in busi
ness.'

Other credos include "Do only what
is easy, effortless, and enjoyable,"
"Don't think about it," "Be in the
world, but not of it"and "Ask dumb
questions."

The course and the book provide
"questions, concepts and techniques
that penetrate to the heart of the in
hibitions that repress creative abili
ties," says Ray.
Students in the class are required to
write two short papers per week.
"We want to keep in constant contact
with them and find out what their ex
periences are," explains Ray.
In addition, students are exposed to
a wide range of guest speakers in the
class. Along with talks by corporate
chief executive officers and successful
businessmen, there are presentations
by psychics, creativity experts, intuition
specialists and hypnotics.
"Creativity is essential for health and
happiness, as well as success in busi
ness," conludes Ray. "All we have to do
is unlock the fountain of creativity
within us to begin leading more fulfill
ing lives."
Ray will be appearing at the
Bookstore today to sign and talk about
his book.
