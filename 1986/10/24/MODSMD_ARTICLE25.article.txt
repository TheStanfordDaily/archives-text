## Stanford's super theater weekend An Oriental fairy tale delights the eye 
### GINA POE 
The American Repertory Theatre's
performance of Carlo Gozzi's "King
Stag" last Friday was a delight for the
eye and ear. Ancient Oriental Noh
theater, with its highly stylized gestures
and elaborate masks, was here given
Shakespearean-flavor character and
costuming. This quality, combined
with whimsical displays of puppetry, a
well-designed set and an appropriate
blend of music, gave the production a
magical quality pleasing to adults and
children alike.
Reality has no place in Count Carlo
Gozzi's improvised comedy, an exam
ple oicommedia dell arte. The heart of

this theater lies in its universal appeal.
The masks and the puppets make the
characters larger than life, thereby put
ting their natures at a laughable dis
tance from our own. Writing in the
18th century, Gozzi's light, improvised
comedies were deliberate acts against
the literary and intellectual pieces of
his day. He sought to create theater "to
which people flock to find fodder for
the eyes and ears alone, not for the in
tellect and the heart." With "The King
Stag," Gozzi succeeded in his aim.
The story is a simple Oriental fable
set in the forest of Miracoli (miracles).
King Deramo (Thomas Derrah) has
been persuaded by his prime minister,
the evil Tartaglia (Richard Grusin), into

choosing a queen. Tartaglia hopes the
King will decide on his daughter
Clarice (Pamela Gien), thereby putting
Tartaglia in a prime position to over
throw the throne. King Deramo,
however, employs a magic statue to
discern which of the maidens he inter
views really loves him. He chooses the
innocent Angela (Diane D'Aquila),
thereby enraging Tartaglia.
The conniving prime minister uses a
magic trick of his own, transferring
Deramo's soul into the body of a felled
stag and claims the king's body for
himself. Good wins out, though, when
Deramo manages to transfer his soul
into an old man's body and convinces
Angela of his true identity.

Due to its improvisatory style,
Gozzi's play is susceptible to inter
pretations that don't match his inten
tions. Friday night's production was
unfortunately tainted with modern
asides so out-of-place that this
reviewer cringed in her seat. Such sup
posedly witty remarks as, "I'm gonna
need the Gestalt treatment after this,"
and, after a character keeled over
onstage, "I wonder if he had tenure?"
brought only a snort of laughter from
the audience.
But besides these mercifully infre
quent annoyances, the show was a joy
to watch. The voices of the actors and
actresses rang clear to the most remote
corners of Memorial Auditorium. Their
wild gesticulations and zany costumes
likewise couldn't have been missed
from miles away.
Let me mention one of the most fas
cinating aspects of this production, the
puppets. These life-size creatures may
well have stolen the show. The grace
ful swirls of the dying stags took one's
breath away, and it was easy to forget
that the old man on-stage was made of
wood and cloth rather than flesh and
blood. The talented puppeteers,
dressed in humble white behind their
fantastic creations, deserved much
more credit than their humble bows
allowed.
All in all, "The King Stag" was a fine
performance. Its offbeat style may have
surprised many traditionalists, just as it
did in Gozzi's day, but that was prob
ably what Gozzi intended. I was
pleasantly surprised to see the Lively
Arts at Stanford bringing us such
"lively art."
