# Comedy is no joke

Jake Johannsen Ls a funny guy. He
mast be: He recently won the San
Francisco International Stand-Up
Comedy Competition, appeared on
Alex Bennett's KITS radio show just
yesterday and will be appearing on
an HBO special next month. And,
oh yes, most importantly, hell be
appearing at Stanford's Memorial
Auditorium tomorrow night with
Rick Overton and Ellen DeGeneres.
But even with all this going on,
Johannsen is quite modest in per
son. Many stand-up comedians
sound like FM radio at its most ob
noxious, but not Johannsen. He
talks about himself in a very low
key manner, never once resorting
to hype or any kind of self
promotion. He even prefers not to
repeat his comedy routines off
stage, fearing he'll lose his spon
taneity — which makes sense, con
sidering that his comedy is rooted
in stories and anecdotes about him
self, delivered in a nervous but con
versational style.
Much of his humor is told in a
deadpan, folksy manner, as when
he talks about using ordinary tools
to hunt animals. Cows, he says, are
very unsuspecting, even when you
approach them with a hammer.
They say, "What's the hammer for,
Jake?" But Johannsen can also be
cutting in his humor: "I don't think
they'll stop sodomy by sending guys
to prison; that's pretty much
headquarters."
Johannsen started on his merry
way in comedy in 1982, when he
dropped out of lowa State College

and moved to San Francisco, per
forming open mike at clubs like
Holy City Zoo. There were times of
discouragement, when a dead
silence would greet Johannsens
routines, but he persevered. "When
the alternative is going to a techni
cal institute, you've got to find some
way to keep going." He found that
the key to being a good comedian is
"to find your own voice and be dif
ferent from others."
Johannsen s efforts paid off when
he, along with hundreds of other
young comics, auditioned for the
San Francisco International Stand
up Comedy Competition. Forty
were actually selected, and eventu
ally a 'top' comedian was chosen; it
was Johannsen. Although winning
has brought him a lot of attention,
don't expect him to bow down in
gratitude. He admits winning the
competition was good exposure,
but he's not thrilled with the idea of
comedy contests in the first place.
"If you see comedy as an art form,
as I do and as I think most com
edians do, then it seems kind of
demeaning. How can you compare
brands of humor?"
Johannsen himself isn't thinking
about big movie and TV ap
pearances right now. "I'll just see
what happens," he says. Clearly, this
man is not fixated on stardom. For
him, comedy is "a way of avoiding
having to do a real job," and who
would want to argue with that?
Johannsen promises assorted
high jinks, spoofs and toomfoolery
for tomorrow night's show in
Memorial Auditorium. Tickets are
$8 and $10, $2 off for students;
showtime is 8:30 p.m.
