# DeLillo's 'Day Room' overflows with great ideas
## 
### LEE CLINE 
Writers love to play with meta
physics, and Don DeLillo's "The Day
Room," a virtual field day for all aspir
ing philosophers, is no exception. It
has something to say about identity,
language, sanity and reality — all that
good serious stuff. DeLillo's ideas were
brought to Memorial Auditorium last
Saturday night by the American Reper
tory Theatre, in a performance beauti
fully directed by a recent Stanford
graduate, Michael Bloom.
The play opens with two patients in
a hospital room, Wyatt (Thomas Der
rah) sanely sitting in bed, Budge
(Jeremy Geidt) in an almost surreal
pose, apparently doing his calisthenics
in midair. The play's entire mood is
thus introduced in the first few

seconds, sanity contrasted with absur
dity. But, we discover, what we per
ceive as absurd may well be doctor's
orders to tne next person.
"The Day Room" contains plenty of
intellectually stimulating dialogue
meant to be clear to everyone; the text
never runs the risk of being too subtle.
This could be a strength or a weakness,
depending on your perspective. The
play's virtue lies primarily in its unex
pected twists and its self-referential na
ture. DeLillo's work is intended to be
torn apart, to be actively used; unlike
some of the better-known absurdist
works, this play isn't meant to be wor
shipped, to be set on a pedestal apart
from the audience.
The characters' lines apply to the
play as a whole as well as the context in
which they are stated. Thus, references

to "language that we can trust" and
statements like "You want to believe in
... appearances" demand that we
question the production before us. On
the whole, DeLillo offers more ques
tions than he answers.
The room suggested by the title is
actually a room for the crazies in the
hospital, a room "painted pure white,
coat after coat after coat." We immedi
ately assume that this is a play about in
sapity. One of the central implications
of "The Day Room" is that the line be
tween sanity and insanity is a fine one
— hardly a novel idea. And yet, DeLillo
makes this point effective and original
halfway through the play. The confu
sion created in the second act (are the
characters in a motel room or the in
famous Day Room?) is capitalized on.
DeLillo knows we're in the palm of his

hand. He confuses the audience as to
the direction of the play, effectively
making the viewer question his own
subjective interpretation, his sanity, as
it were.
The overall question here concerns
the governing forces of reality; as
stated by one of the characters: "Reality
is constantly being assembled and dis
assembled according to ... percep
tion." Communication is the key to
overcoming illusions in"The Day
Room," as each person sees the world
through different eyes, and the only
way to achieve a definitive reality is to
understand a multiplicity of
perspectives. Thus, conversation is a
central theme. The twisting, absurd
humor of the entire play can be ex
emplified in one priceless line: "I
could stop this whole thing cold with a

well-constructed sentence."
There is some amusing dialogue re
garding actors: "Actors love doing mad
scenes" (implying that insanity is
something they understand well),
which introduces another level of
awareness to the experience. The state
ment that "The actor is horribly open
to the true state of being" is double
edged; the context in which it's said
mocks the seriousness of actors —
these characters aren't afraid to laugh
at themselves, thank God — but it's
also a statement about role-playing. All
of DeLillo's rather abstract questioning

comes to down to earth when the audi
ence is led to regard the men and
women on stage as real people, not ac
tors and actresses. Thus "The Day
Room" refuses to sustain the illusion
other plays strive to achieve.
What truly makes "The Day Room" a
memorable play is that it's an attempt
at the communication which
DeLillo finds so vital to a better under
standing of truth. In a cultural environ
ment where one has come to expect
campy intellectualism, it's startling to
find a playwright who seems to
practice the notions he preaches.

sapity. One of the central implications
of "The Day Room" is that the line be
tween sanity and insanity is a fine one
— hardly a novel idea. And yet, DeLillo
makes this point effective and original
halfway through the play. The confu
sion created in the second act (are the
characters in a motel room or the in
famous Day Room?) is capitalized on.
DeLillo knows we're in the palm of his

hand. He confuses the audience as to
the direction of the play, effectively
making the viewer question his own
subjective interpretation, his sanity, as
it were.
The overall question here concerns
the governing forces of reality; as
stated by one of the characters: "Reality
is constantly being assembled and dis
assembled according to ... percep
tion." Communication is the key to
overcoming illusions in"The Day
Room," as each person sees the world
through different eyes, and the only
way to achieve a definitive reality is to
understand a multiplicity of
perspectives. Thus, conversation is a
central theme. The twisting, absurd
humor of the entire play can be ex
emplified in one priceless line: "I
could stop this whole thing cold with a

well-constructed sentence."
There is some amusing dialogue re
garding actors: "Actors love doing mad
scenes" (implying that insanity is
something they understand well),
which introduces another level of
awareness to the experience. The state
ment that "The actor is horribly open
to the true state of being" is double
edged; the context in which it's said
mocks the seriousness of actors —
these characters aren't afraid to laugh
at themselves, thank God — but it's
also a statement about role-playing. All
of DeLillo's rather abstract questioning

comes to down to earth when the audi
ence is led to regard the men and
women on stage as real people, not ac
tors and actresses. Thus "The Day
Room" refuses to sustain the illusion
other plays strive to achieve.
What truly makes "The Day Room" a
memorable play is that it's an attempt
at the communication which
DeLillo finds so vital to a better under
standing of truth. In a cultural environ
ment where one has come to expect
campy intellectualism, it's startling to
find a playwright who seems to
practice the notions he preaches.
