The 39 Steps (1935)
Noe Valley Ministry, San Francisco
Alfred Hitchcock filmed the John Buc
han novel (as adapted by Charles Bennett
and Alma Reville), and though there have
been two versions since, no one has taken
much notice of them. Robert Donat, the
most debonair and best spoken hero of
Hitchcock's British period, plays the inno
cent who gets involved in a spy plot —
and is handcuffed to gorgeous, blonde
Madeleine Carroll. This movie contains
one of the few poignant scenes in any
Hitchcock picture: a brief study of an un
happy marriage. (Peggy Ashcroft and John
Laurie play the couple) With Godfrey
Tearle, Lucie Mannheim, Wylie Watson,
Helen Haye and Frank Collier. "The
Thirty-Nine Steps" contains the blueprint
for many of the thrillers Hitchcock was to
make over the next 25 years (notably
"Foreign Correspondent" and "North by
Northwest").
Plays tonight. The Noe Valley Ministry,
which shows movies every Friday, is lo
cated at 1021 Sanchez St., one block north
of 24th Street in the heart of yuppified
Noe Valley.

Out of Africa (1989)
Memorial Auditorium
Director Sidney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's adaptation of
Isak Dineson's memoir suffers from an
excess of tastefulness and respect for its
subject, and the two stars — Meryl Streep
as Dineson and Robert Redford as her
lover, Denys Finch Hatton — don't display
a single romantic impulse; they never con
nect with each other (or the audience)
emotionally. The movie begins as Dineson
marries the Baron Bror von Blixen-
Finecke (a marvelous Klaus Marie Bran
dauer) — she seemingly for the title, he
expressedly for the money — and to
gether they start a coffee plantation in
British East Africa in 1914. She soon drops
this adulterous playboy husband and
becomes involved with hunter and guide
Finch Hatton. Dineson was a skilled
enough writer to engage one emotionally
at the same time she was turning her ex
periences into an unabashed romantic
idyll. Pollack doesn't display a comparable
skill, and he adamantly refuses to whip up
any excitement or tension. Meryl Streep
gives another perfectly polished, techni
cally accomplished performance that fails
to suggest any inner life to her character,
but the film's biggest problems lie with
Robert Redford. He has taken to playing
ideals, and here he is meant to be the
wild, unconquerable spirit of Africa. In
this film (as in"The Natural") Redford
floats above the other actors, swathed in a
gauzy aura that lets no human emotions
through. With Michael Kitchen in a more
energetic supporting performance.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.

My Beautiful Laundrette (1986)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This bright new comedy from England
spins together an entire socio-political
milieu; it's about Pakistanis in modern
South London, who work in a variety of
tawdry businesses — some legitimate,
some not. The world we see is divided
into the enterprising, entrepreneurial
Pakistanis and the white, racist street
punks, aimless casualties of Thatcher's
economic policies. All of the characters

spend much time discussing their politics,
but they're never just pushing around a se
ries of position papers — they grab onto
their beliefs and turn them into designs
for living. Director Stephen Frears and
writer Hanif Kureishi do their characters
full justice; they create the sense of a
whole community living and thriving off
the South London decay, and each aspect
they reveal is a surprising discovery.
Larger issues grow out of the characters'
sexual, financial and political motivations,
but Frears and Kureishi keep the mixture
light and frothy, and they don't pass harsh
judgments. It's a wonderfully exuberant
movie, with a terrific group of performers:
Gordon Warnecke, Daniel Day Lewis,
Saeed Jaffrey, Roshan Seth, Rita Wolf, Shir
ley Anne Field and Derrick Branche.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Another Country."

Another Country (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Marek Kanievska's film version of the
Julian Mitchell play about how Guy
Burgess (here named Guy Bennett and
played by Rupert Everett) came to be a fa
mous Soviet agent. It's an intelligent piece
of dramatic writing, plausibly built on a
well-made-play structure, with reasonably
rounded characters for the most part;
Mitchell has translated the work to the
screen gracefully, and Kanievska has di
rected a skilled cast (particularly Everett)
in a clear, steady, unhysterical fashion. But
it's an awfully sedate movie — fairly ab
sorbing but unmoving, and bewilderingly
coy in its depiction of the sexual practices
of the Eton boys among whom it is set.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with "My
Beautiful Laundrette."

Time Bandits (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Terry Gilliam's notion of a
children's fantasy includes lots of visceral
nastiness, rude satire and a manic tone. He
may not be far off; a lot of those elements
go into classic fairy tales, and they abound
in this entertaining, wildly inconsistent
movie. A team of thieving dwarves kidnap
a little boy and whisk him through time,
where they meet up with very unromanitc
legendary figures and openly hostile fan
tasy figures. Like Gilliam's "Brazil," "Time
Bandits" is full to bursting of interesting
ideas, but unlike the later movie they
aren't contained within any kind of
coherent structure. It's a very enjoyable
mess, though. Some of the actors who
turn up include Sean Connery, Shelley
Duvall, John Cleese, David Warner, Mi
chael Palin and Katherine Helmond.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
"Brazil."

F/X (1986)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This who-is-doing-what-to-whom?
suspease thriller is modestly stylish, but
very light-weight. It has a nifty central idea:
A special effects man is hired by some
shifty government agents to fake an as
sasination to protect an endangered gov
ernment witness against the mob. He
stages the killing, but then finds that a
whole bunch of people are out to get him.
The rest of the plot doesn't live up to the
expectations created in the first half-hour;
the storyline is obviously padded to fill

two hours, and the movie resolves itself
into one rather mundane double cross.
The performers — a surprisingly skillful
group — include Bryan Brown, Diane
Venora, Brian Dennehy and Cliff De
Young. Efficiently directed by Robert Man
del and written by Robert T. Megginson
and Gregory Fleeman.
Plays tonight with "Legal Eagles."

Taxi Driver (1976)
UC Theater, Berkeley
In this unforgettable movie, Martin
Scorsese ("The Color of Money") gets
closer to Dostoevsky than any other Amer
ican director ever has. Robert De Niro, in
a classic performance, is Travis Bickle, the

Underground Man as cabbie, and New
York is his private hell — New York,
where steam rises from the subway
gratings like smoke off brimstone, and
where the rain-drenched pavement hits a
glittering, slimy surface. Scorsese and his
cameraman, Michael Chapman, manage to
make this urban nightmare city seductive
and repellent at the same time. Paul
Schrader wrote the script, which includes
terrific parts for Cybill Shepherd (as the
object of Bickle's adoration), Jodie Foster
(as a 12-year-old hooker), Peter Boyle (as
another cab driver) and Harvey Keitel (as
a pimp). On a smaller scale, Keitel's per
formance is almost as effective as De
Niro's — his flickering, nervous energy
plays against the time-bomb tension of the
movie.
Plays Tuesday with Scorsese's "Mean
Streets."

Throne of Blood (1957)
Red Victorian, San Francisco
Both Orson Welles and Roman Polanski
have had a fling at filming "Macbeth," but
Akira Kurosawa's samurai version is much
closer to the spirit of the play. Toshiro
Mifune and the amazing Machiko Kyo star;

her hand washing scene is so terrifyingly
obsessive that it transcends the barriers of
language, period and style. It Ls unlikely
that any director in any medium has ever
caused Birnam Wood to come so magi
cally to Dunsinane.
Plays Sunday and Monday.

Utu (1984)
Strand, San Francisco
An exhilarating movie about the Maori
uprisings in the 1870s by the New Zealand
director Geoff Murphy, filmed with as
much grandeur as wit. Murphy, who co
authored the script with Keith Aberdein,
has a bristling intelligence; as he intro
duces more and more characters, intrigu
ing parallels appear and new layers of
meaning gather. Anzac Wallace plays Te
Wheke, a Maori who, returning from a
stint with the British Army, finds his village
razed to the ground and his family

slaughtered by British officers. He
declares a private war on the "pakeha"
(the Maori term for the English ruling
class) and, an immensely charismatic fig
ure, he orchestrates it into a political
movement. Murphy can be lyrical and
humorous at the same time; his gifts for
imagery and irony complement each
other. He and his photographer, Graeme
Cowley, film scenes of riding and shooting
that are the best of their kind since "The
Long Riders," but Murphy doesn't think in
epic terms — he centers the picture on his
actors, employing them as dramatic (and
visual) anchors. And he has a terrific cast,
all of them rich camera subjects: Wallace,
Bruno Lawrence, Tania Bristowe, Wi Kuki
Kaa.
Plays Wednesday with "El Topo."

The Freshman (1925)
Parkside, San Francisco
Harold Lloyd, whom Richard Schickel

has dubbed "comedian to the Age of
Prosperity," plays Harold "Speedy Lamb,
the hayseed who becomes a football hero
at Tate College when he subs for an
injured player in the big game. This is the
first and best of the college sports
comedies; it is utterly charming and
deeply satisfying as well, because there is
a strong emotional subtext, though Lloyd
and the directors (Sam Taylor and Fred
Newmeyer) and the writers (Taylor, John
Grey, Ted Wilde and Tim Whelan) touch
very lightly on it — the anguish of the boy
who wants desperately to belong. Lloyd al
ways played the four-square hero whose
perseverance and ingenuity led him un
failingly to his goal, and since his off
screen life paralleled that of his characters
— he made a killing in Hollywood and
lived in luxury until the age of 77 — his
belief in the Horatio Alger myth can
hardly be disputed. "The Freshman" con
tains some of his funniest bits, like a scene

in which the girl he loves, played by
Jobyna Ralston (his frequent co-star) sews
a button on his shirt while he contentedly
snips buttoas off his cardigan. (Scenes like
this one are reminiscent of Chaplin — but
without the sentimentality.) For collectors
of movie and sports trivia: Taylor and
Newman shot the climactic football se
quence between the first and second
quarters of the East-West Game in the win
ter of 1924-25.
Plays tomorrow on a program of
comedies including "Steamboat Bill Jr."
and"The Ladykillers."

Eraserhead (1976)
Strand, San Francisco
David Lynch's film starts out as a
demonically funny vision of American

family life and turns into a nightmare
about things that squish and spurt and
float; it might be called "The Liquefaction
of America " Watching this movie — and
listening to it (the aural genius Alan Splet
devised the soundtrack, in which normally
incompatible noises, like ringing and siz
zling, melt into each other — is such a dis
orienting experience that you may walk
around for the rest of the evening with
your head cocked to the side and one eye
half-dosed. The best images in the picture
(which Lynch wrote, designed, produced
and directed) are worthy of Dali. Jack
Nance plays Henry, a young man with a
permanently pained expression and hair
cut like a badly trimmed swath of carpet
whose wife gives birth to a monster with a
shrivelled cobra's head.
Plays tonight on an all-Lynch program
including "The Elephant Man and
"Dune."

Stardust Memories (1980)
UC Theater, Berkeley
Woody Allen at his most contemptuous
— of his critics, his fans and all the other
insects that pick at him wherever he goes.
He plays Sandy, a filmmaker clearly in
tended to be Woody Allen; set off in a no
man's land, beyond the reach of other
men, he is also Christ on the cross. Char
lotte Rampling, Jessica Harper and Marie-
Christine Barrault play the women in
Sandy's life, but their roles are so un
developed that they are cut loose from the
mainstream of the movie. Gordon Willis
has photographed this self-righteous, self
serving blather admirably, in bleak black
and white.
Plays tonight with "Love and Death."
— S.V.
Prizzi's Honor (1985)
York, San Francisco
This John Huston black comedy aims to
be a darkly funny parody of the
"Godfather" movies, with the family
squabbles, double crosses and triple
crosses twisted into lyrical comic fina
gling. The screenplay, by Janet Roach and
Richard Condon (from his book), never
quite fulfills the promise of this concep
tion; the movie seems over-plotted, and
the best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who at 75
displays more energetic skill than most
directors half his age, but the tone grows
wobbly toward the end, primarily because
the filmmakers don't give their two main
characters — hitpeople Charley Partanna
(Jack Nicholson) and Irene Walker
(Kathleen Turner) — enough comic per
sonality to grab us. Their relationship isn't
very well-developed and doesn't make a
lot of sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the supporting
cast, which are clearly closer to Huston's
heart. William Hickey as Don Corrado
Prizzi, the wizened and cackling godfather
of the Prizzi mob, is a joy.
Plays tonight with "Heartburn."
