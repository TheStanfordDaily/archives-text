## Stanford 1-point pick to drop Trojans out of race 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
USC Coach Ted Tollner remembers
growing up on Stanford Avenue in the 19505.
"I used to sell papers outside the stadium," he
recalled. "Then I got inside the stadium to sell
those orange things."
That was back in the days when Stanford-
USC was a true rivalry. Two good football
teams battling it out every year. USC held a
slim 5-4-1 advantage in that decade.
Then there is the last decade. USC holds a
wide 10-0 advantage.
Stanford hasn't won against the Trojans
since 1975. It hasn't won against the Trojans
here since 1970.
But if you're looking at last-time statistics,
another one stands out: Stanford hasn't been
5-1 since 1971. And another: Stanford hasn't
been to the Rose Bowl since 1971. And a third:
Stanford beat USC in 1971.
The times have changed in the Pacific 10
Conference. No. 19-ranked Stanford is 2-1 in
conference games, good for second place.
USC is 4-2 overall, 2-2 in the Pac-10, in seventh
place and a game away from elimination in
the conference race. And the Cardinal is a
one-point favorite in tomorrow's game, which
will be televised by CBS to 90 percent of the
nation. Nearly 72,000 are expected to fill Stan
ford Stadium for the 12:40 p.m. kickoff.
"I think Stanford's record is indicative of
how they've played," Tollner said, putting
aside the memories for the moment. "They've
got the most balanced and physical team in
the five years I've played them."
Meanwhile, the usually physical Trojans
have seen a group of inexperienced linemen
taking over in the trenches. The USC defen
sive line starts a sophomore, a redshirt fresh

man and a first-year freshman. And that group
is surrendering 387 yards per game.
"We've given up more yards on defense
since I've been here," Tollner said. "I really
believe our total defense is better than the
numbers."
That unit is also lacking All-Pac-10
linebacker Sam Anno, who was injured
against Arizona State, and has been replaced
by Rex Moore, the brother of former Cardinal
fullback Rob Moore.
The Trojan defense will face a Cardinal of
fense that did everything right in last week's
41-7 win at Oregon. Running back Brad
Muster picked up 151 yards rushing and
scored three touchdowns, quarterback John
Paye completed 14-of-20 passes for 191 yards
and two touchdowns, wide receiver Jeff James
caught eight passes for 130 yards and a touch
down, and the offensive line did not allow a
sack.
"John Paye is an incredible quarterback,"
Tollner said. "He always makes the tough
throw with a guy in his face."
The difference in the offense seems to be
James. The Cardinal has averaged 17 points in
games he hasn't played in, 29 in those he has.
James has 32 receptions in those four games,
behind only Muster's team-leading 37.
The Cardinal may be missing tight end Eric
Snelson tomorrow. Snelson sprained an ankle
in practice Tuesday and is listed as question
able. Jim Price would move into the starting
spot, leaving only Alan Summers as a backup.
Defensively, tomorrow may see the return
of cornerback Toi Cook. Having sustained a
fractured wrist three weeks ago against San
Diego State, Cook was originally feared to
have been lost for the season. He will dress
tomorrow and is listed as questionable.
"I'll be ready to play if the coaches need

me," Cook said. "It's up to the coaches if I can
play. I've had two good practices this week. As
far as pass defense goes, I haven't lost a step.
I'll still be playing with one hand, though."
Cook will have a new cast put on today which
will be padded for the game.
As far as the Trojan offense goes, the domi
nant tailback of years gone by is nowhere to
be found. Sophomore Aaron Emanuel is the
closest thing to be found at USC, and he has
412 yards through six games. The offensive
line, though, is large as usual, averaging 265
pounds across, and anchored by All-America
guard Jeff Bregel, a 280-pounder being touted
as the top lineman in the country.
"Bregel," nose guard Eric Volta said, "he's
their stud. Bregel's probably the most aggres
sive offensive lineman I've faced. He'll talk to
you, tell you what he's going to do."
Throwing for the Trojans will be quarter
back Rodney Peete, a scrambler who has
rushed for 125 yards and completed 55 per
cent of his passes for 204 yards per game.
"Peete's a great athlete," Stanford Coach
Jack Elway said. "And they utilize him well by
rolling him out. If he gets outside, he's very
dangerous at that position."
Stanford's kicking game has been a source
of concern this season, but USC's isn't much
better. David Sweeney hasn't hit on a field
goal attempt over 30 yards this season and last
week missed an extra-point attempt. USC's
Don Shafer is 6-of-l 1 on field goals, but 4-of-9
outside of 30 yards and l-of-4 outside of 40.
"We haven't beaten 'SC in a long time,"
Volta said. "This year we have a chance to."
Any hopes of a Stanford Rose Bowl trip may
depend on it.

Bruce Richardson (23), here stopping an attempted fake punt by Oregon last Saturday, has been
a key member of Stanford's solid special teams unit this season. The Cardinal will need another
strong performance across the board — offense, defense and special teams — to defeat USC to
morrow at Stanford Stadium.
