# Final home games for unbeaten Card
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
For the Stanford men's water polo team, this
weekend's games are a chance to sort out last
weekend's difficulties and bring it all together for
the team's final homestand of the season.
Coming off of a disappointing performance
against No. 2 UCIA last Friday (a 12-8 Stanford
win), the top-rated and 22-0 Cardinal (2-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) will face No. 6 Long
Beach State today at 3 p.m., No. 4 USC tomorrow
at 11 a.m. and No. 11 Brown Sunday at noon. All
games will be held at DeGuerre Pool.
"Last weekend we were kind of flat," junior
Bob Abbott said. "It would be nice to really take it
to these guys this weekend."
The games will mark the final home appear
ances for Cardinal seniors David Imbernino,
Craig Klass, Chris Thompson, Greg Ocasek, Pablo
Morales and Greg Gamble.
"Since these are the last home games of our
Stanford careers," Gamble said, "they'll be pretty
important to us."
Despite defeating the Bruins last Friday, for the
first time this season the Cardinal defense looked
spotty.
In addition, the Stanford trademark of opening
up a lead in the first quarter did not materialize.
On the season, the Cardinal has outscored its op
ponents 90-18 in the first quarter. Against UCLA,
Stanford managed only three goals in the first

quarter and was tied up at four in the second
quarter.
"We expect to play better," Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "When you are having this
kind of season, just winning the game is not
enough."
"If we win the game and don't play well in the
game," he said, "I'm not satisfied and neither are
my players. We think we should beat every team
15-5."
The Cardinal currently sports the longest win
ning streak in the nation â€” 31 consecutive wins
dating back to last year. The longest winning
streak in NCAA history (39) is held by Stanford
(1980-82).
"It (UCLA) was our first tough game in a while
last weekend," junior Grant Stanley said. "And we
didn't play as well as we know we can. We are
looking to blow the teams out this weekend."
In 10-6 Long Beach, Stanford will be taking on a
team that could extend the Cardinal. The Card
inal's last loss was to the 49ers, 6-5 in overtime
last October.
With only five teams from California receiving
invitations to the NCAAs in November, the 49ers
are currently the sixth-rated California team and
in second place in the Pacific Coast Athletic Asso
ciation behind Pepperdine. A victory over Stan
ford could move them up a notch in the rankings
and into the NCAAs.


The undefeated, top-ranked Stanford water polo team is full of
stars, and none has been more productive this season than junior

Erich Fischer, who leads the team with 57 goals. Fischer scored 46
goals in his first two seasons combined.
"I think Long Beach State will be our
toughest game this weekend," Gamble
said. "I think there is a little bit of ven
geance there."
Saturday, the Cardinal will take on
arch-rival and Pac-10 member USC.
Stanford defeated the Trojans 13-7 in
the UC-Irvine Tournament earlier this

season. USC, which comes in with a 13-
3 record, defeated UCLA 8-5 this
season and has an excellent scorer in
sophomore Robert Lynn, a Junior Na
tional Team member.
"It is the most important game this
weekend," Dettamanti said. "They have
better talent than Long Beach State.
USC is the highest-ranked team, and it
is a league game."
Stanford will host an outmatched
Brown squad on Sunday. The Cardinal
defeated the Bears 12-6 earlier this

season.
Obi Greenman, one of the two Card
inal goalies, will most likely not be in
action Friday or Saturday but may
return for Sunday's game. Greenman
has been sick for a week, missing both
of last weekend's games and all of this
week's practices until yesterday.
Junior Erich Fischer took over the
team lead in scoring last weekend with
his six-goal performance against UCLA
and his four-goal game against Irvine.
