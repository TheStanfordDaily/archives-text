# Cardinal soccer shooting blanks
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
The frustration continues. The
streak is now 270 minutes without a
goal. The Stanford men's soccer
team continues to play well and has
nothing to show for it.
The Cardinal is riding a three
game losing streak. The first was the
Pacific Soccer Conference opener
against St. Mary's. Then came na
tionally ranked Nevada-Las Vegas.
Finally, the team traveled to Fresno
State Wednesday and suffered its
second conference loss. All of the
defeats were by 1-0 scores.
Stanford will try to end the streak
Sunday at 2 p.m. at Maloney Field
against the University of San Fran
cisco.
The pressure on the Cardinal
continues to mount. "We won't be
able to let down at all in our up
coming games. It makes the rest of
the league games must-wins," fresh
man forward Chris Porch said after
the loss to St. Mary's.
Now, with the second conference
loss to the Bulldogs, the Cardinal
realistically must win the remainder
of its conference games to have a
shot at the league title.
And the competition in the well
balanced conference is not going to
get any easier. Case in point: USF.
The Dons are ranked in the top 10
nationally and handed Fresno State

its only conference loss of the
season.
"We got back from Fresno State
at 2 a.m. Thursday morning," Card
inal midfielder Kevin Woodhouse
said. "Today's (yesterday's) practice
was kind of a warm-down from that
game. Friday will be a very intense
practice, a warm-up for Sunday's
game. Saturday we'll take it easy
again.
"We have four league games left,
and we're looking toward those,"
Woodhouse added. "There's
nobody in the league that's pulling
away. USF is tough. It's a big game,
and we'll be ready.
"We're tired of losing 1-0. It's a
common problem (not scoring
goals) with a lot of teams. We're
holding the ball a lot close to the
goal. (Also) Chris Porch didn't play
Wednesday."
The Cardinal missed Porch, who
was ill Wednesday. He practiced
yesterday and will be ready for USF.
He still is Stanford's co-leader in
scoring at five points with forwards
Juan Garcia, Ross Torres and Jim
Cole. Cole leads the team in assists
with three, and Garcia, Porch,
Torres and midfielder Mike Mos
smer lead in goals with two.
Goalkeeper Tom Austin contin
ues to shine along with Stanford's
defense as his goals-against average
has fallen from 1.26 to 1.20 over the
last three games
