# 'Big Game' mismatch at Maples
## Pac-10-leading Stanford takes on sixth-place Bears 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
It is the Big Game — volleyball style
— but it's not really a big game.
Coming off of a dominating win over
No. 4 UCLA, Stanford women's volley
ball welcomes California into Maples
Pavilion tonight at 7:30 p.m. It will
most likely be a welcome that the
Bears would rather not have accepted.
Coasidering it won its last game by
the score of 15-2 over one of the na
tion's top five teams, the 12th-ranked
Cardinal should be able to handle un
ranked Cal. Stanford, 11-6 overall, is
atop the Pacific 10 Conference with a 7-
1 league record. The Bears are in sixth
place at 4-4, 13-11 overall.
As is always the case when they take
on lesser teams, the spikers' major
concern is that they not take their op
ponent too lightly. Three weeks ago, a
highly touted Arizona State team came
into its match versus Stanford a little
too confidently, and paid for it, losing
in three straight. The Cardinal does not
want to take a dose of its own
medicine.
"This team has developed pride as
far as how we play each match,'' junior
Theresa Smith said. "Even if we're not
playing the No. 2 or 3 team, we want to
play our best."
The Bears are led by freshman Tif
fany Rochelle, who holds the school
record for most kills in a match with
25, and Kelly Moomaw, whose .269 hit

ting percentage leads the squad. Last
weekend, Cal lost to UCLA in three
games but came back to sweep USC
the next evening.
"They're known as a scrappy team;
they've always had a good defense in
the past," Smith said. "I know they'll be
ready."
Smith, Stanford's leading hitter and
most dangerous server, knows that she
is ready once she has taken care of her
pre-game superstition. "I have to have
a Mountain Dew before we go onto the
court," she said.
"One time last year, we were down
at Arizona State, and I could not find a
Mountain Dew," Smith said, relating
her worst nightmare. "I looked all over
for one frantically but could not find
one. We lost that game."
Mountain Dew or not, it's statistics
like Smith's 222 kills with a 342 hitting
percentage that put her well out in
front of the Cardinal offense. Of
course, with senior co-captains Brooke
Hahner and Barbra Fontana and junior
Nancy Reno also providing power at
the net, opponents cannot afford to
concentrate on just one Stanford hitter.
The new force up front for the
spikers this year is sophomore Laura
Olesen, who redshirted last fall.
Olesen has been hitting at a 351 suc
cess rate to lead the squad and has
teamed with Reno at the middle
blocker position to shut down oppos


Benjamin file
Wendi Rush (8), Stanford's top setter, and Laura Olesen (13), the Cardinal's
leading percentage hitter, have helped lead the spikers back to the top of the
Pacific 10 Conference.
