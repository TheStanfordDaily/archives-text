# Boston takes 3-2 lead

BOSTON (AP) â€” Bruce Hurst
extended his mastery of the
Mets, and the Boston Red Sox
took advantage of some New
York miseries in the field to
move within one victory of their
first World Series title in 68
years, beating the Mets 4-2 last
night.
The victory enabled the Red
Sox to avert a sweep by the Mets
of the three games in Boston
and gave them a 3-2 lead in the
best-of-seven Series.
Hurst, who pitched eight
scoreless innings to win the first
game 1-0, shut down the Mets
this time on 10 hits. The Mets
runs came in the eighth when
Tim Teufel homered and in the
ninth when Rafael Santana had
an RBI single.
Hurst turned back another
New York threat in the fifth in
ning with the help of a key
strikeout of Lenny Dykstra, a hero in Games 3 and 4
whom the Red Sox accused of bat doctoring.
The Mets' only error of the game, by shortstop San
tana, led to one run. Dykstra and Darryl Strawberry col
laborated on a misplay that led to another run, and,
when things went wrong for the Mets, even the wind
played a pan in Boston scoring.
Dave Henderson had a double and triple for Boston,
drove in a run and scored once.
Pitching on three days rest, Mets ace Dwight Gooden
turned to his offspeed stuff, but his fielders were so off, it
didn't help much. He pitched into the fifth inning and
left with none out and two runs home as the Red Sox
took a 4-0 lead. In two World Series losses, Gooden has
an ERA of 8.00. He also was the loser of Game 2.
Hurst, who allowed only four hits in the first game,
was working on his regular four days rest because of a
gamble that Red Sox Manager John McNamara made in
Game 4, using Al Nipper to start.
After losing the first two games at home, the Mets had
won 7-1 in 3, then beat Nipper 6-2 in Game 4 to
even the Series.
But Hurst was fresh, and the Series now goes to Game
6 tomorrow night in New York, with Boston's 24-game
winner Roger Clemens working on five days rest. Mets
left-hander Bob Ojeda, winner of Game 3, will be pitch
ing with three days off.

On 31 other occasions, the World Series has been tied
at 2-2 The team that won Game 5 went on to win the
championship 23 times.
Hurst's victory was the first by a Red Sox left-hander
in the World Series at Fenway Park since Babe Ruth won
Game 4 of the 1918 classic. That also was the last year the
Red Sox won a World Series. They also appeared in the
Series in 1946,1967 and 1975, and lost them all in seven
games.
As they did in Game 4, the Red Sox loaded the bases in
the first inning with the help of a misplay by second
baseman Teufel, who let a grounder get through him
after it bounced off the mound. But the Red Sox came up
empty. Last time, Dwight Evans grounded into a forceout
for the third out. This time, he flew out to left field.
Unlike Game 4, however, the Red Sox came right back
with a run in the second inning, provided by the Seattle
connection of former Mariners Henderson and Spike
Owen and giving the home team it's first lead in this Se
ries.
With one out, Henderson sent a low line drive into the
gap in right-center. Mets right fielder Darryl Strawberry
and center fielder Dykstra converged on the ball, but it
skipped under Strawberry's glove, and Dykstra fell down
on the wet warning track as he took the ball off the wall.
Henderson raced all the way to third with a triple.
Owen, the next batter, hit a fly ball to medium-depth
left field, where Mookie Wilson caught it for the out. Tag
ging up at third, Henderson beat Wilson's throw home
easily, and the Red Sox led 1-0.
Both Henderson and Owen came over in a trade from
the Mariners on Aug. 19.
