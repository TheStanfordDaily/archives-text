# SI reporter returns as Guest Greek
## 
### 
The Greek is coming back. Thanks
to an 8-2 performance by Women's
Tennis Coach Frank Brennan, the
Guest Greek has finally pulled even at
15-15 on the year.
And the Daily's resident Greeks have
also gotten their act together. Sports
Editor Susan Slusser registered the
first perfect 10-0 record of the season
last week. Slusser had quite a good
weekend, all things considered. She
went 10-0, her beloved Red Sox took
the first two games of the Series, and
Spike Owen did not turn her down for
a date. Then again, she never asked
him.
But on to this week. Proving that it is
possible to get a job after working at
the Peninsula's largest morning news
paper, Sports Illustrated staff writer Jill
Lieber is this week's Guest Greek.
Lieber, a 1978 graduate of this fine
university, writes the Extra Points
column for SI, and this week has a
feature piece on Seattle's Steve Lar
gent. She was unable to get Susan a
date with Largent, however.
A communication major, Lieber took
a class called Theory and Technique of
Football while on the Farm from Prof.
Bill Walsh. "He still calls me his most
famous student," she related. "It was
an 8 a.m. class â€” the idea was to get all
the athletes up on time so they
wouldn't be out partying all night."

Lieber started her career as the
editor of Cardinal Today, then moved
up to sports editor before going back
home to Wisconsin to work for three
years at the Milwaukee Sentinel.
"I haven't had much contact with
Stanford football since I left," she said.
"The closest I've come recently was
during training camp in 1985 in
Greeley, Colo. John Elway was there,

and so was his father, so I met Jack El
way."
She said the last Stanford game she
anended was the infamous 1982 Big
Game. "We were sitting two rows be
hind Paul Wiggin s wife and yelling to
fire Wiggin the whole game," she said.
She chose from our menu of 10
games this week on the condition that
we replagiarized David Letterman's

line: "Please, no wagering." As usual,
no point spreads are included. Lieber
voiced a concern with sportswriters
who bet on games, something that we
would never do nor condone.
Lieber chose Stanford to defeat USC
tomorrow. Other featured selections
were Alabama over Penn State ("Kind
of a blowout.") and UCLA over Wash
ington State. ("Terry Donahue is one of

my favorite coaches. ") Lieber also
picked a tie in the SMU-Texas game.
Should that happen, she would auto
matically receive a case of Henry Wein
hard's Private Reserve.
Slusser and sports editor Ken
Stevens are tied in that race at 21-9,
with field hockey writer Tom Senf and
Cardinal Today editor Erik Sten a game
back.
