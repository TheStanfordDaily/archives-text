# Women's soccer travels south for pair of games
## 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
There will be no rest in store for the
Stanford women's soccer team this
weekend, as the Cardinal lakes to the
road for a pair of games. Saturday, the
Cardinal will play Long Beach State
and Sunday will travel to Cal State-
Dominguez Hills.
The Cardinal comes into this
weekend at 3-8-1, after losing three dis
appointing games in a row to excellent
California teams. Saturday, Stanford's
schedule will ease up some, though, as
the team faces the shaky 49ers.
Long Beach's season has included
some bright wins as well as a couple of
devastating losses. The 49ers' record
stands at 6-6-2, and they have defeated
moderately good teams such as San
Diego State and Cal Poly-Pomona. They
have recorded three shutouts this season.
Two of the 49er losses, however,

cause one to wonder about the team's
predictablility. One of its losses was a
6-1 defeat at the hands of California, a
team Stanford held to four goals. The
other glaring loss was an 8-0 blowout
by UC-Santa Barbara.
Injuries plagued the 49ers at the
beginning of the season; and this may
have contributed to several of their
poor performances.
In any case, Long Beach does have
some outstanding offensive players:
Midfielder Janet Fettig leads the team
with seven goals and one assist, fol
lowed by Annette Fernandez with four
goals and two assists.
Sunday, the Cardinal will play
against nationally ranked Dominguez
Hills. The Toros, in only their third
year of existence, are undefeated and
ranked 10th in the country.
The Toros are 8-0-2 this year, and
the only teams that were able to tie

them were Santa Barbara and Cal, a
top-10 team.
Dominguez Hills may be the tough
est team the Cardinal faces all year.
"Their style is long ball, fast and hard,"
Stanford Coach Helen Keohane said.
They play "a fast and physical, aggres
sive game."
The Toros are led by two masterful
veteran players, Jill Draper and Robyn
Queen. Draper, a senior, has scored 11
goals and three assists this season,
while Queen has scored 10 goals and
an impressive nine assists.
Dominguez Hills' defense is just as
formidable as its offense. Goalkeeper
Sandra Powers allows an average of
only 0.95 goals per game and has led
the Toros to five shutouts.
Stanford will attempt to absorb the
Toros' offensive attacks and then
"quickly counterattack and throw them
off balance," Keohane said.
