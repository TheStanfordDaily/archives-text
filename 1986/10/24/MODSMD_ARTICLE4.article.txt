# Georgetown cuts think tank ties
## Decision spurs Hoover questions 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Georgetown University split last
Thursday with its conservative political
think tank, citing the two institutions'
different missions and conflicting
fundraising goals.
The decision to establish the Center
for Strategic and International Studies
as a separate entity has prompted new
questions about Stanford's relationship
with the Hoover Institution, which
some say compromises Stanford's
commitment to academic freedom.
Both CSIS and Hoover have a
reputation for conservative thinking,
due to the large number of Reagan ap
pointees in their ranks. Former U.N.
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and As
sistant Secretary of State for African Af
fairs Chester Crocker have both
worked with CSIS.
In addition, CSIS operated, like
Hoover, as a semi-autonomous organi
zation within the university and at
tracts well-known diplomats, politicians
and economists. Faculty at the two uni
versities have attacked the existence of
partisan think tanks on the campus.
Georgetown officials said the uni
versity and the think tank had conflict
ing goals.
"CSIS is a think tank, a bridge to
reality to deal with the press ...
Georgetown has an academic mis
sion," said Gary Kroll, director of
public relations for Georgetown.
The Georgetown board of directors
acted at the recommendation of a five
member committee formed to exam
ine the tensions between the university
and CSIS. The committee found that
the center focused more on the media
than on research.
'They provide a quick fix for indus
try and the media, and they do it

responsibly, but it is not something a
university ought to be doing,' Prince
ton legal historian and committee
member Stanley Katz told the Associ
ated Press.
In addition, Georgetown saw confu
sion and overlap between the fundrais
ing objectives of the university and the
center. Krull said there was a danger of
losing contributions because donors
did not know the difference between
the university and CSIS.
CSIS President Amos Jordan as
sessed the damage to the Center as
limited. Jordan said CSIS might miss
the university's "academic umbrella"
but also predicted a loss in prestige for
Georgetown.
"There are few universities in the
land that can boast the historians,
economists and political scientists of
the quality we have here," he told the
Associated Press.
Stanford administrators and faculty
differed on whether Stanford should
take a similar action to resolve long
standing friction between the Univer
sity and Hoover.
"It sounds like Georgetown's
moving in the right direction," said
Stanford Political Science Prof.
John Manley, a longtime critic of the
presence of Hoover on campus. "I
wish I could take some heart in this,
but the University and Hoover are
moving closer and closer," he added.
Supporters of Stanford involvement
with Hoover point to differences be
tween Hoover and CSIS. John Cogan, a
senior resident fellow at Hoover,
defined its outlook as more oriented
toward the future and "much more
divorced from daily political events in
Washington."
"(The Washington think tanks) are
less focused on long-term research
and place more emphasis on the pres
ent— Out here we're much further
from the pulse of Washington," Cogan
said. He rejected any idea of competi
tion for funds between Stanford and
Hoover.
Supporters of maintaining the cur
rent relationship between Stanford
and Hoover also cite as advantages of
close ties the tremendous research of
the Hoover Library, its attraction of
scholars to the University, the forward
looking philosophy of Hoover and the
lack of serious competition for funds
between the University and Hoover.
