# Sociologist: tactics prevent women from playing sports

### YVONNE LEE 
A variety of attitudes, including ho
mophobia, are used by our society to
keep women from participating in
sports, asserted Gail Whitaker, a sports
socologist at San Francisco State Uni
versity, in a speech at the Women's
Center last night.
Whitaker, 38, said that coercion,
patronizing humor, argument, silence,
ritualizing of sport activities and
slander are methods used to keep
women from athletics.
Whitaker agreed that women's posi
tion in sports has improved during the
past 10 years, but said: "Women will
not achieve equality in sports because
males and male activity are given more
value in our society than females and
exclusively female activities."
Whitaker cited the division of labor

as being responsible for sex stereotyp
ing in society. Tasks in society are
divided into "instrumental" and
"expressive" activities, according to
Whitaker. Instrumental activities, those
activities which are rational and re
quire using tools are assigned to men,
whereas, those which are expressive
or intuitive are assigned to women, she
said.
Whitaker said sports are designed to
teach boys instrumental skills and that,
because our society values male activ
ity over female activity, it has
developed social controls to keep
women out of sports.
Whitaker cited the locker room and
sports bars as methods of ritualistically
keeping sports male-oriented. In addi
tion, the lack of media coverage of
women's events is a way of keeping
women from sports, she said.

Female athletes' sexual preference is
often brought into question, according
to Whitaker. This is designed to inspire
guilt, she said, and is a particularly ef
fective method of keeping girls from
participating in sports.
"If you are a female athlete, then you
are (assumed to be) a lesbian," she
said.
Whitaker said society's real fear is
female athleticism, not homosexuality,
and that exclusively female activities
are trivialized in society. On the other
hand, she said she believes there is a
disproportionately high percentage of
homosexual women in sports.
The speech, sponsored by the Stan
ford Women's Center, was part of a
lecture series entitled, "Women in Mo
tion: Competition, Expression, Fit
ness."
