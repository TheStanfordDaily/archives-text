## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Lawyers for both sides in the
$600,000 lawsuit filed by 1986 graduate
Robby Perkins against the University
and Santa Clara County will meet next
month to review the progress of the
pre-trial preparations and to sound out
the possibility of an out-of-court settle
ment, according to Perkins' attorney.
Attorneys are scheduled to meet on
Nov. 21 with federal Judge Spencer
Williams, according to James Mellen.
Mellen added that the Unversity has
not indicated whether a settlement is
possible.
Attorney Jennifer Westerlind, Stan
ford's assistant staff counsel, said dis
cussing settlement of the suit "really
depends on how discovery (pre-trial
preparation) proceeds."
Perkins, who graduated last year
with degrees in economics and inter
national relations, filed the suit charg

ing assault and battery and racial dis
crimination in connection with his ar
rest a year ago during a divestment sit
in at Old Union.
Defendants named in the suit in
clude University President Donald
Kennedy, Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington and six Stanford police of
ficers. Perkins is seeking damages plus
medical expenses and legal fees.
Stanford filed its response to the suit
on Sept. 30 in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco. No court date has been set.
The lawsuit recounts the events of
Oct. 11,1985, when, as part of a protest
against University policy on divestment
from South Africa, Perkins and eight
other Stanford students refused to
leave Old Union. The students were ar
rested by campus police about a half
hour after the building's 5 p.m. closing
time.
Perkins alleges that Stanford's offi
cers used "excessive, unreasonable,
unneccessary and unlawful force"

when they used a "compliance-pain
hold" to move him. Perkins refused to
stand and walk with the officers as a
symbol of his protest.
Westerlind said die University plans
to get a sworn statement from Perkins.
Perkins will have to return to the
country temporarily from his Peace
Corps assignment in Costa Rica for the
deposition.
Ann Ravel, attorney for Santa Clara
County and the county sheriffs also
named as defendants, discounted talk
of a settlement. "I don't think that there
is any liability," said Ravel.
Mellen says he is optimistic about
