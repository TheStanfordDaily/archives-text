# Perkins' lawsuit awaits court date
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Lawyers for both sides in the
$600,000 lawsuit filed by 1986 graduate
Robby Perkins against the University
and Santa Clara County will meet next
month to review the progress of the
pre-trial preparations and to sound out
the possibility of an out-of-court settle
ment, according to Perkins' attorney.
Attorneys are scheduled to meet on
Nov. 21 with federal Judge Spencer
Williams, according to James Mellen.
Mellen added that the Unversity has
not indicated whether a settlement is
possible.
Attorney Jennifer Westerlind, Stan
ford's assistant staff counsel, said dis
cussing settlement of the suit "really
depends on how discovery (pre-trial
preparation) proceeds."
Perkins, who graduated last year
with degrees in economics and inter
national relations, filed the suit charg

ing assault and battery and racial dis
crimination in connection with his ar
rest a year ago during a divestment sit
in at Old Union.
Defendants named in the suit in
clude University President Donald
Kennedy, Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington and six Stanford police of
ficers. Perkins is seeking damages plus
medical expenses and legal fees.
Stanford filed its response to the suit
on Sept. 30 in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco. No court date has been set.
The lawsuit recounts the events of
Oct. 11,1985, when, as part of a protest
against University policy on divestment
from South Africa, Perkins and eight
other Stanford students refused to
leave Old Union. The students were ar
rested by campus police about a half
hour after the building's 5 p.m. closing
time.
Perkins alleges that Stanford's offi
cers used "excessive, unreasonable,
unneccessary and unlawful force"

when they used a "compliance-pain
hold" to move him. Perkins refused to
stand and walk with the officers as a
symbol of his protest.
Westerlind said die University plans
to get a sworn statement from Perkins.
Perkins will have to return to the
country temporarily from his Peace
Corps assignment in Costa Rica for the
deposition.
Ann Ravel, attorney for Santa Clara
County and the county sheriffs also
named as defendants, discounted talk
of a settlement. "I don't think that there
is any liability," said Ravel.
Mellen says he is optimistic about


Robby Perkins
Suit still pending
winning the suit. Perkins hired the
Richmond attorney after the American
Civil Liberties Union was unable to
find him a lawyer who would handle
the case for free.
In its responding brief, the Univer
sity says that Perkins resisted arrest by
"going limp" and was told that a pain
ful "control hold" would be used to
carry him. Stanford contends that
Perkins' conduct amounted to his
"assumption of the risk that... injuries
... would proximately result."
About a month after the incident,
Kennedy said Herrington recognized
that the holds were inappropriate and
had changed the procedure for remov
ing protesters from civil disobedience
scenes.
Perkins' lawsuit also charges that he
was singled out for especially harsh
treatment because he was the only
black student arrested.
Santa Clara County sheriffs are the
primary targets of Perkin's allegations
of assault and battery. He said he was
strip-searched and beaten by officers at
North County Jail in Palo Alto, where
he was taken after his arrest. He sus
tained bruises and other injuries, and
was not released until 3 a.m., accord
ing to suit documents.
