# Cocaine kills, report says

Cocaine users have reason to fear irregular heartbeat and
sudden death due to irreparable damage that the drug can
do to heart muscle cells, according to a soon-to-be
published report by researchers at the Stanford University
School of Medicine and the San Francisco Medical Ex
aminer's Office.
Dr. Henry Tazelaar, the Stanford surgical pathologist who
coordinated the study, noted that, in the past year or so,
there have been reports of 15 or more documented serious
cardiac events in people who have used cocaine.
"The evidence is mounting up that cocaine is not the
benign drug it was once thought to be," said Tazelaar in a
recent interview.
Over the past year, medical researchers have discovered
increasing evidence that cocaine can have direct, destructive
effects on heart tissue, said Tazelaar.
Tazelaar said the findings may help explain the recent
cocaine-related deaths of University of Maryland basketball
star Len Bias and Cleveland Browns football player Don
Rogers. "I think these findings may provide insight into the
deaths of the seemingly fit young athletes we've all heard
about, although we haven't examined any of their heart
tissue," he said.
Cocaine, which has been known for thousands of years in
South America for its euphoric and stimulatory effects, has
become an increasingly popular drug in the United States,

perhaps because it is often perceived as a relatively safe
drug.
Although they have no proof yet, the researchers suspect
that people who don't have any problems initially may be
damaging their hearts over time.
Some noted effects of cocaine include angina, heart at
tacks, coronary artery spasm, irregular heart rhythms and
sudden death. He added that cocaine users are also prone to
seizures similar to epileptic seizures.
Upon microscopic examination of hearts from "relatively
disease-free" people with a mean age of 33 years who died
of cocaine toxicity, researchers found that, in 28 out of the
30 users, heart tissues contained myocardial contraction
bands, which appear as abnormal red streaks.
Only nine out of the 20 control hearts examined dis
played similar lesions, which were also fewer in number,
said the report.
"Once it's happened, the cells are essentially useless," he
said. "It's an irreversible process. And because you get these
useless, or dead, cells sitting in the way, the normal conduc
tion pathways of the heart don't work like they should."
Users of cocaine "may or may not know" whether they
are developing myocardial infraction bands. Tazelaar noted
that the damage could occur gradually; in the short term,
the bands may have little or no noticable effect.
"We are particularly concerned about this in young
people, because later in life when they
