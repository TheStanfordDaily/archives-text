# Fetter: Essays are key factor in admissions process
## 
### LISA WOLF 
Margie Morse stared blankly at the scattered
pages of her half-written English assignment.
Beneath the morass of paper, her unopened
history textbook lay near the illegible scratch
ings of her calculus problem set, each compet
ing for her undivided attention and effort. Un
der the burden of academic pressure, spurred
by the onset of mid term season, Margie forgot
about her workload and liegan wondering how
she got into Stanford.
"Why did they accept me over all those
thousands of other applicants who didn't get
in?"
Competition is fierce to get accepted to Stan
ford. This years freshman class of 1,575 students
was selected from a pool of 16,138 applicants.
Only 16 percent of those who applied were of
fered admission.
What happens when there are too many
qualified applicants? "It is this type of situation
where the admission essay is given the most

weight, - ' commented Jean Fetter, dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions.
"There are a lot of qualified prospective stu
dents out there who would just exist as statistics
in our (the admission officers') minds without
personalities attached. The essay is the perfect
opportunity for a student to add another di
mension to their application."
Fetter's comments are capitalized on in a
lxx>k written by two Yale graduates entitled
"Essays that Work." The book, which features a
collection of 50 "successful" essays along with
comments from admission officers from top
colleges, recognizes the importance of the col
lege essay.
"The book provides a pretty accurate picture
on what we look for in an essay because it just
recommends that the writer be his or herself,
said Fener.
"Some of the essays we receive are very
funny — they make me laugh out loud,' she
said The class of 1990 had to suggest a holiday
that thev would like to establish, and, according

to Fetter, "Most of the respondents were very
creative.
"We received essays in favor of a Charlie
Brown Day, a National Relaxation Day, a day in
honor of the Stanford trombone player who
was crushed in the fateful Big Game of 1982
and even a few who argued that the question
was stupid," she said.
Stanford does not accept a certain ratio of
funny essays as compared to serious essays.
Most applications are read by three admission
officers who comment individually on the style,
imagination and content of the essay.
"What may appeal to one officer may not ap
peal to another. There is no right answer to
how you see an essay, "added Fetter.
"We also get a lot of students who are
sensitive to social issues including nuclear war,
feminist issues and Third World development,
but we can tell when someone is trying too
hard to give us what he thinks we want," she
said. "There is no way to try and second guess
what an admission officer is looking for be

cause we usually don't even know specifically
what we want."
Fetter does remember certain exceptional
essays. "One artistic women used the word
'prismatic' to describe herself. She wrote her
essay in the shape of a three dimensional
prism," Fetter said.
"Another student used the word reflexive'
and wrote his essay backward and gave us a
mirror to help us read it." Other memorable
essays include a football player who was
sensitive about his stuttering and a student who
advocated the initiation of a holiday to reflect
on the possibility of nuclear war.
Originality, although important in some in
stances, is not always a criteria, Fetter said. "In
response to the question, 'Who would you like
to spend a day with, and what would you like to
do?' The three most popular answers were
grandparents', Jesus Christ' and 'myself.' To
show that there are no absolutes in the admis
sions procedure not everyone who used one of

these three responses was accepted.
"There is no concise formula for getting into
Stanford," said Fetter. "We regard two criteria
in admitting students. The first is academic ex
cellence, and the second is achievement
outside the classroom."
The admissions office looks carefully at high
school grade point average and SAT scores to
determine the first criterion and then considers
the list of extra-curricular activities that a
prospective freshman participates in to fulfill
the second criterion, Fetter said.
"We want to give individuals a fair hearing.
There is no way a 'kntxk-your-socks-ofF essay
can make up for a mediocre academic record,
hut it can highlight you as a stronger candidate
if you fulfill the rest of the critia."
What does all of this mean to the rest of us
sining in our rooms overloaded with work and
weary from lack of sleep? It means that for
whatever reason — the admission staff feels
that we belong here
