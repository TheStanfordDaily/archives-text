Reagan fights for candidates
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. — President Reagan, attempting to capitalize on his
personal popularity, embarked yesterday on a 13-state barnstorming tour
in a "go for broke" effort to preserve the narrow Republican majority in the
U.S. Senate.
Speaking to supporters at a send-off rally at the White House, Reagan
said the midterm congressional elections pose a clear choice between
Republicans and Democrats on such issues as defense spending, tax policy
and criminal justice.
He described a possible Democratic takeover of the Senate as a "threat
to all we have accomplished and all we hope to do together," calling a vote
for Republicans "a vote for tough laws and tough judges."
With polls showing the GOP in danger of losing its slender Senate
majority of 53-47, White House tacticians decided it was time to
"nationalize" the Nov. 4 elections and gamble that they could be turned
into a successful referendum on Reagan's leadership.
Reagan has taken to the hustings with gusto. His tour includes stops in
Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Colorado,
Nevada, South Dakota, Washington, Idaho and California before conclud
ing next week.
"It's good to be here today in Missouri — away from Washington and out
in the real America," he said at an exuberant rally at Southwest Missouri
State University.
Reagan appeared here on behalf of former governor Kit Bond, who has a
comfortable, but not unassailable, lead over Lt. Gov. Harriet Woods in their
campaign for the seat of retiring Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.).
U.S. report upsets South Africa
PRETORIA South Africa — An official U.S. report concluding that South
Africa is "closer to becoming just another African country" and not a good
place for American companies to do business set off a major diplomatic
row yesterday between Pretoria and Washington.
Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik" Botha summoned the American charge
d'affaires, Richard Barkley, and told him angrily that South Africa took "the
strongest exception to the insulting and hostile language" of the U.S. De
partment of Commerce report on political and economic developments
here.
South Africa is part of Africa," Botha said, "and therefore takes excep
tion to the arrogant and insensitive comment that South Africa is 'closer to
becoming another African state.' "
The report had been prepared for internal U.S. government use but was
made available to reporters after portions of it were quoted in yesterday's
editions of the Business Day newspaper and in a dispatch of the Reuters
news agency.
Botha's anger stemmed clearly not only from the publication of the
report, but also from the congressional imposition of economic sanctions
on South Africa earlier this month and the abrupt withdrawal of three
major American companies from the country this week.
Budget deficit reaches new high
WASHINGTON — The U.S. budget deficit for 1986 soared to a record
$220 billion, easily topping last year's $212 billion shortfall but $10 billion
short of what the Reagan Administration had projected, Budget Director
James Miller III disclosed yesterday.
Miller said through a spokesman that higher-than-anticipated revenues
near the end of the year and lower spending by federal agenices accounted
for the unexpected savings.
The spokesman, Ed Dale, also said that projections by the White House's
Office of Management and Budget suggest that the deficit will fall by $50
billion in 1987, to the vicinity of $170 billion — even if Congress enacts no
further spending cuts.
The White House budget office as recently as last August had estimated
that the 1986 deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 would amount to
$230.2 billion.
"The $10 billion improvement is a whole series of small changes, includ
ing some increase in receipts and a wide variety of decreases in outlays,"
Dale quoted Miller as saying.
Defense spending was not among those decreases, Dale said.
Bias charged in State Dept.
WASHINGTON — Black Foreign Service officers, accusing the State De
partment of racial discrimination in a suit filed in U.S. District Court, said
yesterday that they have been insulted, passed over for promotion and sub
jected to pervasive racism that continues from administration to adminis
tration.
Bernard Johns, an 18-year veteran of the Foreign Service and one of the
plaintiffs in the suit filed in U.S. District Court, said, "When we speak of sys
temic discrimination, we're not talking about something that started yester
day. It is institutional, and it transcends administrations."
Only 6.3 percent of the 4,014 persons who have served as Foreign Ser
vice officers since January 1984 are black, according to court papers. The
suit also charges that promotions come more slowly for black officers and
that blacks are regularly required to retire before reaching the highest
ranks.
Secretary of State George Shultz was named defendant in the suit.
Shultz sent a cable last month to all U.S. diplomatic missions in which he
said that the numbers of women and minorities in the Foreign Service was
"unacceptably low." He outlined a program to combat the sort of discrimi
nation claimed in the suit.
But black Foreign Service officers, holding a press conference in the of
fice of their attorneys, shrugged off Shultz's program.
"Secretaries of state have made such statements since 1946, when an at
tempt was made to integrate the Foreign Service," Johns said.
Meese's statements under attack
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin Meese III came under fire
yesterday for his declaration earlier in the week that the Constitution —
and not necessarily the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution
— determines the law of the land.
In the speech, delivered Tuesday night at Tulane University, Meese ac
knowledged that each Supreme Court decision binds "the parties in a case
and also the executive branch for whatever enforcement is necessary. But
such a decision does not establish a 'supreme law of the land' that is bin
ding on all persons and parts of government, henceforth and
forevermore."
Some constitutional experts judged that position yesterday as a defen
sible one. But the American Civil Liberties Union said Meese's statement
shows that he is "the most radical and dangerous attorney general in this
century."
And in much softer criticism, Eugene Thomas, president of the American
Bar Association, said in a statement that it is important for the public to un
derstand, Meese's comments notwithstanding, that "Supreme Court deci
sions are the law of the land, just as acts of Congress are the law of the
land."
In the speech, Meese underscored constitutional historian Charles War
ren's observation that, "however the court may interpret the provisions of
the Constitution, it is still the Constitution which is the law, not the deci
sions of the cc?urt."
Meese, who has been far more willing to publicly challenge Supreme
Court rulings than his predecessors for the last 20 years, said:
"Constitutional interpretation is not the business of the court only, but also,
and properly, the business of all branches of government."
Ira Glasser, the ACLU's executive director, denounced Meese's com
ments as "an invitation to lawlessness and a breach of constitutional duty to
uphold the law."
