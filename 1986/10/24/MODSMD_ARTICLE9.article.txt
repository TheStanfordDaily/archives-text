# Truce called in expulsion war
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration
sought a cease-fire yesterday in the war of diplomatic
reprisals with the Soviet Union by imposing only a
few relatively mild restrictions on Soviet Embassy
operations in response to Moscow's latest expulsion
of U.S. diplomats.
"We hope that this set of issues can now be put be
hind us," State Department spokesman Charles Red
man said. "We need to get on with resolution of the
larger issues affecting U.S.-Soviet relations and build
on the progress made in the discussions at (the sum
mit conference in) Reykjavik."
The measured retaliation marked an abrupt
change in tactics for the administration, which earlier
this week expelled Soviet diplomats on an 11-1 ratio.
Only the day before, U.S officials were insisting that
Washington would not be the first to ask for quarter.
Redman attacked as "wholly unwarranted," the So
viet action Wednesday to expel five U.S. diplomats,
prohibit Soviet citizens from working at U.S.
diplomatic missions, place new limits on the number
of Americans who can be temporarily assigned to
duty in Moscow and Leningrad and restrict the num
ber of visitors from abroad who may be entertained

by U.S. diplomats in the Soviet Union.
But the administration held its latest retaliation to a
minimum, hoping to wind down the cycle of tit-for
tat reprisals. No additional Soviet diplomats were ex
pelled, but the United States imposed mirror-image
restrictions on other operations of the Soviet Em
bassy in Washington and consulate in San Francisco.
Americans were banned from working for the Soviet
missions, new limits were fixed on temporary assign
ment of Soviets to the United States and restrictions
were placed on diplomatic entertainment by Soviet
diplomats.
As a result of a month of diplomatic skirmishing,
the United States and the Soviet Union were left with
mathematical equality. Each nation is allowed 225
personnel in its embassy and 26 in its coasulate. Nei
ther can fill in with locally hired workers. And nei
ther can bring in unlimited numbers of personnel on
temporary assignments.
At first glance, the United States would seem to
have gotten the better of it. A total of 80 Soviet
diplomats — 42 from the embassy in Washington, 13
from the consulate in San Francisco and 25 from the

U.N. mission in New York — have been ordered
home.
The Soviets have expelled 10 Americans, eight
from the embassy in Moscow and two from the con
sulate in Leningrad. The United States will be permit
ted to replace all 10 of its diplomats, while the
Soviets will be allowed to send substitutes only for
five. The other 75 diplomats represent required per
manent reductions in the size of the three missions.
Washington has long accused Moscow of using its
diplomatic missions as centers for espionage, and the
U.S. government said all 80 of those expelled were
intelligence officers. Exuberant administration offi
cials said the expulsions "decapitated" the KGB and
GRU intelligence organizations in the United States.
But there are important differences between the
two countries that ultimately may make the Soviet
diplomatic presence in the United States more effec
tive than the U.S. presence in the Soviet Union.
Viewed purely in terms of the potential for giving
spies diplomatic cover, the Soviets clearly will have
more positions, counting the U.N. mission, than the
United States will have in the Soviet Union.
