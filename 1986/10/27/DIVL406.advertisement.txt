"When Antolini decides to do it again.. .1 will be the first in line."
—Marilyn Tucker. SF CHRONICLE
"Lost Rachmaninoff masterpiece proves inspirational.. .The sold out crowd rose
to its feet in a prolonged ovation at the end of the hourlong performance."
-Karen Smith, PENINSULA TIMES-TRIBUNE
"Composer's obscure liturgy sung masterfully by choir.. .highlights include.. .a
rising "Alleluia" sequence that almost lifted the audience out of its seat at the end
of the Cherubic Hymn." -Judith Green, sj mercury news
"Conductor (Antolini).. .honed his choir to remarkable sonority, accuracy and
expression.. .the chorus breathed as one, phrasing with confidence..."
