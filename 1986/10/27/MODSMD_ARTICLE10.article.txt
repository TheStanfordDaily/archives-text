# Kaiser strike on
## 
### 
OAKLAND â€” Kaiser Permanente
workers have voted heavily to reject
the company's latest contract offer
and were set to begin to strike 27
Northern California hospitals and
clinics this morning at 6 a.m., the
union announced yesterday.
The results from Saturday's vote
were announced by union spokes
man Ray Abernathy for Local 250 of
the Hospital and Institutional
Workers Union.
The union said although 8,700
affected workers were eligible to
vote, only about 6,000 did cast bal
lots. Over 80 percent of them voted
to reject the latest Kaiser contract
offer, Abernathy said.
"The decision was powerful and
overwhelming," he said. "The strike
will begin at 6 a.m. tomorrow
(Monday) morning."
Kaiser, the largest health mainte
nance organization in the world,
has announced that in the event of a
strike all elective surgery and
routine appointments would be
canceled.
All necessary medical care will
continue at Kaiser facilities from the
Oregon border to Gilroy, said
Kaiser spokeswoman Jennifer
Cross.
Workers affected include clerical
and housekeeping employees,
licensed vocational nurses, ward

clerks and X-ray technicians, nur
sing assistants, EKG technicians and
licensed respiratory specialists.
The company's latest contract of
fer was flatly rejected Thursday by
union negotiators. It included
freezing wages for three years, set
ting up a two-tier wage system for
new hires outside the San Francisco
Bay area and cash bonuses for cur
rent employees.
The key issue was Kaiser's insis
tence on a two-tier wage structure
in any new contract. It would mean
wages about 30 percent lower for
new employees at Kaiser facilities
in seven cities: Santa Rosa, Vallejo,
Napa, Fairfield, Sacramento,
Roseville and Stockton.
"We're paying as much as 35 per
cent over pay scales and other
hospitals in those communities,"
said Kaiser spokesman Robert
Hughes.
The two-tier pay proposal, "only
leads to disagreements and
disputes among employees, and it's
basically unfair," said local 250
spokeswoman Maureen Anderson.
Kaiser officials claim new com
petitors in the health care field have
discounted contracts with hospitals
and have severely undercut a price
advantage the non-profit organiza
tion once held.
