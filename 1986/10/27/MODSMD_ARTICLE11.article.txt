### LAURA CORSER 
In order to augment Dartmouth
College s residentially based aca
demic programming, an official of
the college's Residence Life Office
visited Stanford earlier this month
to examine Stanford's Residential
Education system.
David Sloane, assistant dean of
Residence Life at Dartmouth looked
at Stanford s system because
Stanford does it (maintains a Res
Ed system) better than anyone in
the country. It is a private school,
like ourselves, that sets itself high
academic standards. The skills used
at both schools are very similar," he
said. Sloane visited campus on Oct.
17.
According to Sloane, his primary
interest was to analyze Stanford's
academic theme house program. In
order to gather information regard
ing the program, Sloane met with
Assistant History Prof. Stephen Fer
ruolo, resident fellow of Potter
House, and German Studies Prof.
Orrin Robinson, RF of Lagunita
West, as well as Madera RF Charlie
Junkerman, assistant to the dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
In the meetings, Res Ed officials
explained to Sloane the roles of RF,
resident assistants and the types of
programs pursued in the dorms,

such as debates, films and discus
sions. The meetings also provided
specific examples of the system,
participants said.
In particular, Sloane said he
wanted to know what components
need consideration in creating a
successful academic theme house.
According to Sloane, Dartmouth
has "affinity" houses, which are
roughly equivalent to Stanford aca
demic theme houses, but which
lack some of the components of
theme houses.
Sloane said he was especially im
pressed by the diversity of the aca
demic theme houses and the ability
of Res Ed to create a unified theme
house from such a diverse group.
Sloane said he would like to im
prove the system already in place at
Dartmouth by furthering the notion
that "education doesn't stop at the
classroom door." Discussions do
already start spontaneously in
Dartmouth residences, Sloane said,
but he added that he would like to
see this encouraged more.
Sloane said he felt intellectual
debate would be facilitated by
creating stronger ties between
various faculty members and
residence halls. He said he wanted
to observe the Stanford system in
