# Dartmouth dean samples Res Ed

### LAURA CORSER 
In order to augment Dartmouth
College s residentially based aca
demic programming, an official of
the college's Residence Life Office
visited Stanford earlier this month
to examine Stanford's Residential
Education system.
David Sloane, assistant dean of
Residence Life at Dartmouth looked
at Stanford s system because
Stanford does it (maintains a Res
Ed system) better than anyone in
the country. It is a private school,
like ourselves, that sets itself high
academic standards. The skills used
at both schools are very similar," he
said. Sloane visited campus on Oct.
17.
According to Sloane, his primary
interest was to analyze Stanford's
academic theme house program. In
order to gather information regard
ing the program, Sloane met with
Assistant History Prof. Stephen Fer
ruolo, resident fellow of Potter
House, and German Studies Prof.
Orrin Robinson, RF of Lagunita
West, as well as Madera RF Charlie
Junkerman, assistant to the dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
In the meetings, Res Ed officials
explained to Sloane the roles of RF,
resident assistants and the types of
programs pursued in the dorms,

such as debates, films and discus
sions. The meetings also provided
specific examples of the system,
participants said.
In particular, Sloane said he
wanted to know what components
need consideration in creating a
successful academic theme house.
According to Sloane, Dartmouth
has "affinity" houses, which are
roughly equivalent to Stanford aca
demic theme houses, but which
lack some of the components of
theme houses.
Sloane said he was especially im
pressed by the diversity of the aca
demic theme houses and the ability
of Res Ed to create a unified theme
house from such a diverse group.
Sloane said he would like to im
prove the system already in place at
Dartmouth by furthering the notion
that "education doesn't stop at the
classroom door." Discussions do
already start spontaneously in
Dartmouth residences, Sloane said,
but he added that he would like to
see this encouraged more.
Sloane said he felt intellectual
debate would be facilitated by
creating stronger ties between
various faculty members and
residence halls. He said he wanted
to observe the Stanford system in
order to see how the University attempted to bring the two
groups together.
As incentive for faculty involvement, Sloane aims to
"work with faculty members to expand those theme houses
already at Dartmouth, and to then initiate academic pro
grams throughout all the halls."
Until recently, Dartmouth has had non-paid advisory staff
at each residence. Now, Dartmouth is looking to link
departmental faculty members more permanently with stu
dent accomodations, Sloane said. Theme houses seem the
best place to start, he said.
The impetus for Sloane's visit came several weeks ago
when Sloane met Robin Hensley, assistant director of Stan
ford's Residential Education, at a conference on alcohol
awareness for college campuses held at UGA. At the confer
ence, Sioane mentioned his desire to conduct a "fact
finding" search of various university residential education
programs.
After the conference, Assistant Dean of Residential Educa
tion Alice Supton prepared a packet for Sloane, which con
tained outlines for the general set-up of Stanford's system.
Included in the packet were proposals for the Wilbur-based

Western Culture Track, an overview of the computer
facilities installed in freshman dorms, freshman dorm tutor
ing and the dorm-based advising system.
Following this correspondence, the formal visit was ar
ranged.
According to East House RF Michael Chang, who met with
Sloane during his visit to Stanford, "Students are at different
places with regard to the theme ... it is a matter of organiz
ing theme associates to recognize this fact and to provide ac
tivities that will allow people to develop an active interest in
the them." Chang attributed part of Stanford's theme house
success to the "self-op" arrangement.
Chang said having house members partipate in the gen
eral maintenance of the residence encourages unity and
creates a "mutually beneficial relationship."
According to at least three of the individuals with whom
Sloane met, die success of the University's residentially
based academic program is due in great part to Stanford's
size. Dartmouth has few graduate schools and has a small
undergraduate population of about 4,000. In contrast, Stan
ford officials said, Stanford is a populous campus. Thus the
needs of their Res Ed system are very different, they added.
Sloane said he formed a very favorable impression of
Stanford during his visit. He said, "I had a lot of fun. I was
given a varied tour (from Lagunita to La Maison Francais),
and I learned all sorts of stuff."
