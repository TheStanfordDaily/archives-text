# Davies vows to press on with suit

### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
Former Visiting Prof. Norman Davies
says he will continue his $3.1 million
lawsuit filed against 31 professors in
the Stanford History Department
regardless of whether he is able to take
the deposition of Associate History
Prof. Harold Kahn, the only one of the
professors actually named in the suit.
In September, the Supreme Court of
Santa Clara County gave Davies
permission to take Harold Kahn's
deposition and to amend his original
suit, which the court has ruled out.
Kahn petitioned the state Court of
Appeals for a writ of mandate to
prevent Davies' attorney, former Re
publican Congressman Pete McClos
key, from doing so. Last week, the
Court of Appeals issued a stay, which
means that it wants more time to
decide whether or not McCloskey can
take Kahn's deposition.
"I don't think Kahn's deposition is
key," Davies said this weekend. He em
phasized that he had the option to
amend his suit, by "naming up to 29
other people, for example."
Davies, a tenured professor of East
European History at the University of
London, filed suit against 31 members
of the History Department last May.
Davies charged that tenured members
of the department voted to deny him a
tenured position in January because
some of them perceived a political bias
in Davies' treatment of Polish-Jewish
relations in his recent book, "God's
Playground: A History of Poland."
Davies, whose appointment expired at
the end of the last academic year, is

living in Palo Alto.
Only Kahn was named in Davies'
suit. The 30 anonymous defendants
were "slots into which (Davies) can af
terwards fit names if (he) develops in
formation," according to University
Staff Counsel Iris Brest.
According to Davies, he and McClos
key, "tried to minimize the names of
people who were mentioned," when
the suit was filed. Davies said he filed
the lawsuit to obtain information about
what was said at the Jan. 15 meeting,
when the department voted not to of
fer him a tenured position.
Davies said he wanted to use the in
formation in an internal hearing,
which University Provost James Rosse
had told a student delegation the Uni

versity would hold to consider Davies'
case.
Davies said he has since realized that
"the strategy of Stanford is to prevent
any information from being given....
The Provost has never allowed the in
ternal hearing to take place. Now the
whole thing Ls going to change In
the absence of an internal hearing, a
lawsuit is the only way to obtain infor
mation."
Brest noted that important questions
were raised by Davies' suit. "Does the
fact that someone had been weighed

and found wanting constitute defama
tion," she said.
In Da vies' amended suit, McCloskey
will have to prove that because his
client has a right to know what was said
about him at the January' meeting, the
participants in the meeting are not
protected by the Filth Amendment.
The state Supreme Court has already
ruled that Davies had no cause of ac
tion in his original case, because the
subjects of discussion at the meeting
were constitutionally protected, ac
cording to Brest.
