## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Reconfirm Bird 
### 
Rose Bird, the Chief Justice of California, is not a
politician. This is as it should be — the California Su
preme Court is a judicial body, not a political group.
The campaign to oust her, however, has been charac
terized by the kind of lowly political mudslinging not
seen since the days of Tammany Hall. And in the last few
weeks, it has become especially difficult to separate fact
from fiction.
The fiction is criminals in California get off with light
sentences. The fact is the state's prison population has in
creased 80 percent between 1980 and 1984. The fiction is
Rose Bird overturns death penalty sentences as a matter
of habit. The fact is she is only one justice, and it takes a
majority to overturn a sentence. The fiction is the Su
preme Court lets hardened criminals roam free because
of minor technicalities. The fact is of the 991 appeals that
reached the court in 1983-84, only 20 convictions were
reversed — and the court ordered retrials in every case.
The fact is that Rose Bird is a competent chief justice,
and her opponents are engaged in a campaign of lies.
Indeed, a strategist for the anti-Bird campaign has said he
ought to have the "right to lie" to voters if he thinks it
will help his cause. Such blatant abuse of the public trust
is disturbing.

More disturbing, though, is the concept of turning the
California Supreme Court into a political battleground.
The attack on the judges threatens the long and valid
American tradition of the independent judiciary as a
safeguard against abuse of power.
Additionally, Bird's opponents do not understand the
proper role of the court. The Supreme Court does not
make the laws; the California Assembly does. Once the
laws are on the books, it is the court's responsibilty to
ensure they are applied fairly and effectively. When a
badly written law — such as the death penalty initiative
of 1978 — comes under the court's scrutiny, the justices
cannot simply ignore its flaws. They must interpret the
law as it is written. Judges follow the intent of the law,
not the will of the people.
Through all of this politicking, Chief Justice Bird has
been a model of restraint. She recognizes that the
judiciary, "as a collegial body that speaks through the
written word and complexities," is at an inherent disad
vantage when faced with the savage political tactics being
employed in this campaign, and she has steadfastly
refused to bring herself down to the level of her oppo
nents.
Unlike those who oppose her, Bird is fair and honest.
She deserves reconfirmation.
