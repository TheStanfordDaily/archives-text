# Getting the entire story
## 
### 
I am writing this letter for several
reasons. The first is to clarify several
glaring errors that appeared in a recent
front-page article ("Two students
found guilty," Daily, Oct. 20).

W. McKELVY

In that article, the reporter wrote
that I had been found guilty on battery
charges. This error particularly disap
pointed me, considering the time and
expense I invested in clearing my
name of these very charges. It also dis
appointed me that the reporter took
the investigatory time necessary to find
out the particulars of my sentence, but
obviously did not take the necessary
time to confirm the charges, nor the
manner in which I pleaded to those
charges. While I am sure the reporter's
error was not intentional, it showed a
lack of professionalism and journalistic
responsibility on his part to print such
a grave accusation only to be
wrong. While I have felt that The
Daily's coverage of the whole incident
has been poor — my injuries and
medical treatment were never noted,
for example — this error verged on
the slanderous. I must remind the
reporter that not only is The Daily dis
tributed in the Stanford community,
but that it is also received by several
members in my hometown community
of Memphis, Tenn.
As to the actual charges of the case, I
pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor
Section 415 of the California Code.
This offense, found under "Fighting;
Noise; Offensive Words" in the Code,
is levied against:
• Anyone who unlawfully fights in a
public place or challenges another
person in a public place to fight;
• Any person who maliciously and
willfully disturbs another person by
loud or unreasonable noise; or
• Any person who uses offensive
words in public which are inherently
likely to provoke an immediate violent
reaction.

Essentially, I was charged with
"disturbing the peace," as it is referred
to in the legal profession. I feel that
this outcome of the criminal aspects of
the case fully exonerates me, in that I
was convicted of "fighting," which is
significantly different from the
"battery" for which I was originally
charged and subsequently cleared.
I also learned two valuable lessons.
First, it is now clear to me that violent
drunks are a problem to be dealt with
by trained professionals such as the
police, not concerned but ill-prepared
members of the public like myself.
Secondly, I learned the potentially
deadly results of physical conflict,
something of which I was relatively ig
norant because I had never been in a
fight my entire life until this incident.
As an individual philosophically
opposed to physical violence, I always
have and still do regret the injuries that
David Curry sustained, just as I experi
ence regret upon hearing of injury to
any other person.
An additional error in the article was
a quote by Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons saying all three students
involved in the incident were "quite
drunk." While this statement was made
by Dean Lyons immediately following
the incident, it was based on supposi
tion and hearsay and subsequently was
disproved and retracted. In fact, in
Dean Lyons' official letter to University
President Donald Kennedy summariz
ing the event, written on June 4, Lyons
wrote, "most of the participants were
drunk. Mr. McKelvy was the excep
tion."
I also want to address what I con
sider to be two cases of bias in the arti
cle. Plainly put, a statement by Public
Defender Davila in the article told only
half the story. Davila said that in a pre
liminary hearing "probable cause to
prosecute the student" (meaning me)
"on a felony battery charge" was
proven. This probable cause arose
from the undeniable nature of Curry's
injuries and my voluntary statements to
the police admitting my involvement
in the incident; I had withheld no in
formation nor tried to hide anything.

What was not brought out was that the
preliminary hearing elicited critical
testimony from Curry that eventually
led to the reduction of my charges. It
was during this hearing that Curry said
(I am quoting from the reporter's tran
script of the preliminary hearing taken
on June 13 in Palo Alto Municipal
Court), "I'd say peple in my dorm
would say I'm out of control." It was
also recalled in this hearing that Curry
had told Stanford police officers Love
and McMullen that he "had a reputa
tion in the dorm as being violent and
out of control when drinking."
Then there was the disappointing
secondary headline which read
"Lawyer: Stanford suspended both."
While my and Randy Von Feldt's
suspensions were deemed headline
material, it was only mentioned in
passing that Curry had been
suspended as well. It seems to me that
the "real" story should read something
like, "All three found guilty after exten
sive University investigation: Only two
prosecuted?"
As far as the civil suit that Curry is
now waging, I found a comment by his
lawyer in the same article very telling.
His attorney, John Crowley, said "the
University should be viewed legally as
a bar or similar drinking establish
ment." Is it not clear to Curry that now
the University is much more than a
"drinking establishment?" Apparently
not. I have been held accountable for
my actions by both the University and
the public. So has Randy. I suggest it is
now time for Curry to accept the same
accountability for his actions.
Finally, at this point, my biggest
regrets go to the University. I am truly
sorry that Stanford has become the bat
tleground for the type of litigation
profiteering that has made "deep pock
ets" a dirty word. Yes indeed, Stanford
is not a "drinking establishment," Mr.
Crowley, nor is it here to enrich
lawyers with no connection to the de
velopment and education of young
people.
