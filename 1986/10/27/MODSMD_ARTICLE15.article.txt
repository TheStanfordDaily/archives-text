# Effects of tax reform on students
## 
### 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 makes radical changes
in the taxation of graduate students' support, indeed
in many cases more radical changes than had been
anticipated from prior House and Senate discussion.
The following is a preliminary announcement of our
understanding of how the new law affects graduate
student support, particularly with respect to the
remainder of this acadmic year (up to June 30,1987).
A number of issues are yet to be clarified, and we will
share details with you as soon as we receive more in
formation.

• Scholarships or fellowships: These were previously
entirely exempt from taxation. As of Jan. 1, 1987, the
stipend portion, less "course-related expenses" (e.g.
fees, books, supplies), becomes taxable. We do not
know at this time whether "course-related expenses"
will be exempted by approved institutional (or
departmental) fixed amounts, or whether exemp
tions will be made on an individual basis.
The law states further that all awards made prior to
Aug 16,1986 are not subject to this new taxation We
belive that virtually all Stanford graduate fellowship
awards for 1986-87 were made prior to this date
Therefore the winter and spring quarter fellowship
stipends are probably not subject to tax.
Withholding is not mandated on fellowship
awards. The Controller's Office will issue a 1099 In
formation Return to the IRS at the end of 1987. This
leaves the student with the responsibility of making
quarterly tax payments if tax will be owed
• Assistantships — research and teaching: The new
law makes all stipends paid for "service" taxable,
regardless of whether or not such service is a degree
requirement. Therefore all stipends received after
Jan. 1, 1987 will be subject to withholding. The Con

trailer's Office will advise students on possible ad
justments in withholding amounts depending on
total expected income, size of family, etc.
One section of the law further makes tuition,
which is awarded by virtue of such an assistantship
appointment, taxable. However, we expect that we
will be able to exempt the first $5,250 under other
provisions of Section 127 of the act. It appears
therefore, that assistantship tuition for winter and
spring quarters will probably not be taxed, as it will
be below $5,250 (except for medical students who
will receive $294 more than $5,250 due to the higher
tuition rates).
Taxable stipends and tuition, and taxes withheld
thereon, will be reported to the IRS annually on
Form W-2. The Controller's Office will be developing
some projected tax tables, so that individual students
can anticipate the loss of income from withholding.
Students in this category should file a current Form
W-4 Employees Withholding Allowance Certificate
(SU-32) with the Payroll Office.
• Nondegree students: The law states that all forms of
support, whether fellowship or assistantship, stipend
or tuition, will be subject to taxation after Jan. 1,1987,
if awarded to a student who is not pursuing a degree.
This means that any support for non-matriculated
graduate students or post-doctoral scholars will be
subject to taxation. For post-doctoral individuals at
Stanford in this category, there is little change, since
the stipend Is already taxed. Under one section of the
new law, the tuition will be subject to taxation as well
after Jan. 1,1987. However, it is probably exempt un
der Section 127 provisions mentioned in the previ
ous section (post-doctoral tuition for four quarters is
at present only $445 a quarter). Students in this cate
gory who have not done so should file a current
Form W-4 Employees Withholding Allowance Certifi
cate (SU-32) with the Payroll Office.

new law in the next few weeks and will be making
every effort to make the transition to the new tax re
quirements as easy as possible. We are very aware
that students are living on limited resources and will
often find it difficult to have reduced income. We are,
of course, pursuing information to clarify all these
revisioas and will let you know as soon as possible
when the situation becomes clearer. In the meantime
students who will be subject to withholding
(teaching assistants, research assistants, post-doctoral
affiliates and non-matriculated students holding as
sistantships or fellowships) should file the Form W-4
mentioned above.

quirements as easy as possible. We are very aware
that students are living on limited resources and will
often find it difficult to have reduced income. We are,
of course, pursuing information to clarify all these
revisioas and will let you know as soon as possible

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 makes radical changes
in the taxation of graduate students' support, indeed
in many cases more radical changes than had been
anticipated from prior House and Senate discussion.
The following is a preliminary announcement of our
understanding of how the new law affects graduate
student support, particularly with respect to the
remainder of this acadmic year (up to June 30,1987).
A number of issues are yet to be clarified, and we will
share details with you as soon as we receive more in
formation.

E. TRAUGOTT

• Scholarships or fellowships: These were previously
entirely exempt from taxation. As of Jan. 1, 1987, the
stipend portion, less "course-related expenses" (e.g.
fees, books, supplies), becomes taxable. We do not
know at this time whether "course-related expenses"
will be exempted by approved institutional (or
departmental) fixed amounts, or whether exemp
tions will be made on an individual basis.
The law states further that all awards made prior to
Aug 16,1986 are not subject to this new taxation We
belive that virtually all Stanford graduate fellowship
awards for 1986-87 were made prior to this date
Therefore the winter and spring quarter fellowship
stipends are probably not subject to tax.
Withholding is not mandated on fellowship
awards. The Controller's Office will issue a 1099 In
formation Return to the IRS at the end of 1987. This
leaves the student with the responsibility of making
quarterly tax payments if tax will be owed
• Assistantships — research and teaching: The new
law makes all stipends paid for "service" taxable,
regardless of whether or not such service is a degree
requirement. Therefore all stipends received after
Jan. 1, 1987 will be subject to withholding. The Con

trailer's Office will advise students on possible ad
justments in withholding amounts depending on
total expected income, size of family, etc.
One section of the law further makes tuition,
which is awarded by virtue of such an assistantship
appointment, taxable. However, we expect that we
will be able to exempt the first $5,250 under other
provisions of Section 127 of the act. It appears
therefore, that assistantship tuition for winter and
spring quarters will probably not be taxed, as it will
be below $5,250 (except for medical students who
will receive $294 more than $5,250 due to the higher
tuition rates).
Taxable stipends and tuition, and taxes withheld
thereon, will be reported to the IRS annually on
Form W-2. The Controller's Office will be developing
some projected tax tables, so that individual students
can anticipate the loss of income from withholding.
Students in this category should file a current Form
W-4 Employees Withholding Allowance Certificate
(SU-32) with the Payroll Office.
• Nondegree students: The law states that all forms of
support, whether fellowship or assistantship, stipend
or tuition, will be subject to taxation after Jan. 1,1987,
if awarded to a student who is not pursuing a degree.
This means that any support for non-matriculated
graduate students or post-doctoral scholars will be
subject to taxation. For post-doctoral individuals at
Stanford in this category, there is little change, since
the stipend Is already taxed. Under one section of the
new law, the tuition will be subject to taxation as well
after Jan. 1,1987. However, it is probably exempt un
der Section 127 provisions mentioned in the previ
ous section (post-doctoral tuition for four quarters is
at present only $445 a quarter). Students in this cate
gory who have not done so should file a current
Form W-4 Employees Withholding Allowance Certifi
cate (SU-32) with the Payroll Office.
