# Educational expectations
## 
### 
Fall quarter is not yet four weeks old, and already I've
heard freshmen complain that their classes aren't meeting
their expectations of Stanford.
No doubt many of us had similar feelings when we were
freshmen. When I discovered that my Western Culture in
structors were not professors, that my language teachers
were graduate students and that some of my TAs didn't yet
have a bachelor's degree, I too wondered if $16,000 might
be a bit much to pay for that expertise.
I'd wager that at some point or other most Stanford stu
dents have questioned whether the education they are re
ceiving here lives up to Stanford's image as a great institu
tion of higher learning.
Why is this the case?

One obvious answer is that Stanford simply doesn't care
all that much about undergraduate education. Despite the
official propaganda and the occasional cash prize to an out
standing teacher, Stanford does not give undergraduate
education a very high priority when it comes to allocating
resources.
Stanford spends a lot of money building the infrastruc
ture that enables it to stay in the forefront of academic re
search — particularly in the technical fields. Stanford
spends a lot less money developing undergraduate depart
ments, encouraging excellence in the classroom or improv
ing student living conditions.
The most highly prized — and highly paid — faculty
members are those with tenure. To get tenure, faculty must
demonstrate that their research has had a significant impact
on the scholarship of their fields — not that they have done
a good job of educating their students. A bias permeates
Stanford — as it does most "research universities" — that
good teaching and good scholarship are somehow incom
patible:
The Western Culture program provides a good chance to
examine Stanford's commitment to undergraduate educa
tion. In all the controversy about the content of Western
Culture courses, no one has suggested that the most serious
problem may lie not with the reading list but with an under
lying lack of commitment to the program as a whole.
Western Culture differs from any other freshman level
classes. For instance, I can see that Stanford would have dif
ficulty persuading its top professors to teach introductory
language and math classes. Essentially, these courses
amount to training students in relatively simple skills
But a good Western Culture program aims to do more
than just impart basic skills. It serves as an introduction to
the intellectual life of the University. In Western Culture
classes, students encounter for the first time ways of think
ing that will be part of their subsequent study no matter
what their concentration. Nurturing the intellectual devel
opment of its newest students should be a high priority of
any university committed to undergraduate education.
At Stanford, however, this responsibility is left to the

lowest people on the academic totem pole: low paid, non
tenured lecturers whose very status indicates that the Uni
versity doesn't value them very much. And if a freshman is
fortunate enough to see a tenured professor in his Western
Culture class — that is, someone the University considers
very valuable — it will most likely be a distant sighting
across a crowded lecture hall.
But if Stanford is very interested in undergraduate educa
tion, why is this the case?
When I was a freshman, a cynical upperclassman ex
plained to me that it was all a scam. Stanford stressed re
search to enhance the reputation of its faculty, whose name
in turn bolstered the reputation of Stanford, which could
then attract even more reputable scholars, and so on. In this
scheme, the students participate equally in fooling everyone
— as Stanford's reputation grows, admission becomes more
competitive, and being a Stanford student becomes even
more prestigious, even if the students aren't learning much
while they're here.
All in all, that's a pretty disillusioning description. But
whether you think Stanford is a grand con really depends
on die way you think about this type of university.
There is a natural tendency — especially among fresh
men — to analogize Stanford with high school or a small
liberal arts college. High schools exist for the sole purpose
of educating their students, and, for the most pan, high
school students are passive learners — sitting in class
waiting for the system to dish up an education for them to
consume.
No such paternalistic sense of purpose can be found at
Stanford. Here, the education you can get by merely attend
ing lecture and passively absorbing stuff probab/y will not
come close to being commensurate with the academic
reputation of the school.
Seeing this place as a son of super high school — only
bigger and better with a world-class faculty — is the wrong
way to think about Stanford. A better analogy for Stanford
might be a medieval university.
The first universities, which appeared in northern Europe
around 1200, were actually guilds of thinkers and scholars
who gathered to discuss, debate and improve their knowl
edge. Students at these universities sought to extract the
best education possible from their privileged circumstance.
University education was more like an intellectual appren
ticeship than an intellectual cafeteria.
The medieval university analogy offers a better way of
thinking about education at Stanford. Here, the top scholars
in various disciplines come together in an effort to advance
the knowledge in their fields. For their endeavors, the Uni
versity provides them with vast resources. The implications
for students are twofold.
In the first place, such a university offers (contains might
be a better word) a tremendously rich opportunity for edu
cation. My freshman adviser once told me that the great
thing about a university like Stanford is that the extent of its
resources and the talent of its faculty allow you to push
yourself to the outer limits of your ability.
But by its very nature, that kind of opportunity won't
come to you. To take advantage of it requires that you put
forth the effort to make the system work for you.
Stanford isn't going to give anyone a great education. But
that doesn't mean you can't get one here.

men — to analogize Stanford with high school or a small
liberal arts college. High schools exist for the sole purpose
of educating their students, and, for the most pan, high
school students are passive learners — sitting in class
waiting for the system to dish up an education for them to
consume.
No such paternalistic sense of purpose can be found at
Stanford. Here, the education you can get by merely attend
ing lecture and passively absorbing stuff probab/y will not
come close to being commensurate with the academic
reputation of the school.
Seeing this place as a son of super high school — only
bigger and better with a world-class faculty — is the wrong
way to think about Stanford. A better analogy for Stanford
might be a medieval university.
The first universities, which appeared in northern Europe
around 1200, were actually guilds of thinkers and scholars
who gathered to discuss, debate and improve their knowl
edge. Students at these universities sought to extract the
best education possible from their privileged circumstance.
University education was more like an intellectual appren
ticeship than an intellectual cafeteria.
The medieval university analogy offers a better way of
thinking about education at Stanford. Here, the top scholars
in various disciplines come together in an effort to advance
the knowledge in their fields. For their endeavors, the Uni
versity provides them with vast resources. The implications
for students are twofold.
In the first place, such a university offers (contains might
be a better word) a tremendously rich opportunity for edu
cation. My freshman adviser once told me that the great
thing about a university like Stanford is that the extent of its
resources and the talent of its faculty allow you to push
yourself to the outer limits of your ability.
But by its very nature, that kind of opportunity won't
come to you. To take advantage of it requires that you put
forth the effort to make the system work for you.
Stanford isn't going to give anyone a great education. But
that doesn't mean you can't get one here.

Fall quarter is not yet four weeks old, and already I've
heard freshmen complain that their classes aren't meeting
their expectations of Stanford.
No doubt many of us had similar feelings when we were
freshmen. When I discovered that my Western Culture in
structors were not professors, that my language teachers
were graduate students and that some of my TAs didn't yet
have a bachelor's degree, I too wondered if $16,000 might
be a bit much to pay for that expertise.
I'd wager that at some point or other most Stanford stu
dents have questioned whether the education they are re
ceiving here lives up to Stanford's image as a great institu
tion of higher learning.
Why is this the case?

One obvious answer is that Stanford simply doesn't care
all that much about undergraduate education. Despite the
official propaganda and the occasional cash prize to an out
standing teacher, Stanford does not give undergraduate
education a very high priority when it comes to allocating
resources.
Stanford spends a lot of money building the infrastruc
ture that enables it to stay in the forefront of academic re
search — particularly in the technical fields. Stanford
spends a lot less money developing undergraduate depart
ments, encouraging excellence in the classroom or improv
ing student living conditions.
The most highly prized — and highly paid — faculty
members are those with tenure. To get tenure, faculty must
demonstrate that their research has had a significant impact
on the scholarship of their fields — not that they have done
a good job of educating their students. A bias permeates
Stanford — as it does most "research universities" — that
good teaching and good scholarship are somehow incom
patible:
The Western Culture program provides a good chance to
examine Stanford's commitment to undergraduate educa
tion. In all the controversy about the content of Western
Culture courses, no one has suggested that the most serious
problem may lie not with the reading list but with an under
lying lack of commitment to the program as a whole.
Western Culture differs from any other freshman level
classes. For instance, I can see that Stanford would have dif
ficulty persuading its top professors to teach introductory
language and math classes. Essentially, these courses
amount to training students in relatively simple skills
But a good Western Culture program aims to do more
than just impart basic skills. It serves as an introduction to
the intellectual life of the University. In Western Culture
classes, students encounter for the first time ways of think
ing that will be part of their subsequent study no matter
what their concentration. Nurturing the intellectual devel
opment of its newest students should be a high priority of
any university committed to undergraduate education.
At Stanford, however, this responsibility is left to the

lowest people on the academic totem pole: low paid, non
tenured lecturers whose very status indicates that the Uni
versity doesn't value them very much. And if a freshman is
fortunate enough to see a tenured professor in his Western
Culture class — that is, someone the University considers
very valuable — it will most likely be a distant sighting
across a crowded lecture hall.
But if Stanford is very interested in undergraduate educa
tion, why is this the case?
When I was a freshman, a cynical upperclassman ex
plained to me that it was all a scam. Stanford stressed re
search to enhance the reputation of its faculty, whose name
in turn bolstered the reputation of Stanford, which could
then attract even more reputable scholars, and so on. In this
scheme, the students participate equally in fooling everyone
— as Stanford's reputation grows, admission becomes more
competitive, and being a Stanford student becomes even
more prestigious, even if the students aren't learning much
while they're here.
All in all, that's a pretty disillusioning description. But
whether you think Stanford is a grand con really depends
on die way you think about this type of university.
