## Theta Breakers challenges runners for charity 
### JAMES R. DICKEY 
"A lot of these people have never done anything like this
before. Some of them are serious runners, but quite a few
are just looking for something fun and unusual to do," ac
cording to junior Liz Marks.
The fun and unusual thing people are signing up for is
the Second Annual Thetaßreaker 10 kilometer run, sched
uled for next Sunday.
The race course will consist of two loops, each five
kilometers long, around the campus. The run will begin at
Gate 11 of Stanford Stadium at 8:30 a.m. sharp.
The Thetas are ecstatic about the race.
"Last year, we had about 150 runners," said Marks. "This
year, we already have 100 preregistered, and we have room
for 500."
"It's definitely one of the biggest service projects a
sorority does at Stanford," said Marks' co-organizer Liz
Balas. "We're all working very hard."
Not all of those efforts have been fruitful, though.
"We put flyers up all over campus last Wednesday in an
effort to get more participants," Balas said. "The next day it
rained. Almost all the flyers fell down."
"We also had some trouble with organizational details
and getting permission," she added. "We had some troubles
with the ASSU — nothing important — just a pain in the
ass."
But the hassle is all worthwhile for the cause, organizers
say.
The Thetaßreaker is sponsored by the Kappa Alpha Theta
sorority to raise funds for the Community Association for
the Retarded (CAR). The money will be raised by charging a
registration fee of $8 for preregistered runners.
Last year, the funds were donated to the Peninsula Oral
School for the Deaf.

The decision to change charities was made, according to
Marks, "to help a charity that is closer to the area and that
more people are involved in. Several of our members are
personally involved in CAR."
The Thetaßreaker was organized for the first time last
year by Susan Ross, then-president of the Thetas, Nina
Kazazian and Dana Shelby, who were all running en
thusiasts.
"It seemed like a really good idea," said Marks. "There are
so many runners on campus, and it's an unusual type of
fundraiser for a sorority to do."
The race turned out to be fun as well as a successful way
to raise money.
In spite of the difficulties of putting on an event as com
plicated as a 10K for the first time, the First Annual
Thetaßreaker raised $700.
"We hope to have more participants this year," Balas ex
plained, "But a lot of our costs have gone up. The am
bulance (supplied in case of injured runners) costs twice as
much this year. So we are hoping to raise 1750 or $800."
The Thetas have only one complaint about the race.
"Several of our members wanted to enter," Marks said,
"But we need all of them to make sure everything is cov
ered."
Aside from that, the Thetas are prepared for a successful
race.
"We have all the different parts of the race set up, from
registration to judges and monitors. All we need now are
the contestants," Marks said.
The runners, whether serious or not, who enter the 10K
will be treated to refreshments, first aid stations, and if they
are among the first 200 signed up, a T-shirt. If you wish to
walk, or even to gawk, spectators are welcome.
The top two male and female finishers will receive prizes.
