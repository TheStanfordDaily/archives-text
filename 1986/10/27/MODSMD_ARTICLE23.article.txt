Yoga: a system of exercises for attaining bodily or mental
control and well-being.
"The purpose of yoga isn't to be like Jane Fonda and tie
yourself into a pretzel," said Joseph Baugh, special events
coordinator of the Stanford Yoga Society.
"Immense benefits of peace, harmony and health have
come to me since beginning to do yoga several years ago,"
explained Anil Gupta, president and founder of the society.
Gupta, a native of New Delhi, attended the Indian Institute
of Technology and is currently a graduate student in com
puter science. He and four other Stanford graduate students
created the society this summer "to share with others the
peace and balance which comes with the practice of yoga."
"Yoga is a way of finding out what you truly are. It is an
experimental science, in which parts and movements of the
body are explored which most people don't even know ex
ist," said David Hall, special consultant to the society. He
learned yoga in India and currently teaches yoga and
practices deep tissue massage in the Palo Alto area.
"What is most important about this society is that each in
dividual member is important and crucial," explained
graduate student Perwez Shanabuddin, public relations co
ordinator for the society. "Each person is a universe of

resource, creativity and potential. The society honors each
one's presence and welcomes everyone's contribution. No
one is more important than the individual member."
The society will be hosting guest lecturers and sponsor
ing field trips and retreats. Future lecturers will include
John Enright, former chairman of the psychology depart
ment at John F. Kennedy University in Orinda, and Michael
Deranja, founder of a Northern California residential
meditative community.
A retreat is planned for this Saturday afternoon. Students
will journey to some as yet undisclosed "place in nature (in
order to) really experience yoga in a more natural setting,"
said Baugh. "Being in communion with nature is often a
very powerful route to being in communication with
oneself.
"There are at least seven different approaches to what we
are calling 'yoga' or 'self-awareness,' " he said. "Every two
weeks I would like to have a guest present something to us
from one of those points of view. We are fortunate in this
area to have exceptional representatives of several of these
main schools or approaches."
Students will be introduced to yoga through gentle
stretches and slow massages, according to instructor Elayne
