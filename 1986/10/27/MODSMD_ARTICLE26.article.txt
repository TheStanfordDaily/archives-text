# Round Room films challenge intellect
## Monday evening Memorial church movies focus on Redford and Newman 
### LAURA REED 
Back in the 19605, a young radical
named Richard Thayer was over
whelmed by the power of a film called
"Wild in the Streets,'' a musical about
the takeover of society by young rebels
who poisoned the nation's water
supply with LSD.
Today, Thayer, assistant dean at
Memorial Church, still believes in the
impact movies can make. He coordi
nates the Round Room video series,
which screens a film every Monday
evening at 9.
Though the connection between his
job as director of campus ministries
and his role as the founder of the
movie series seems to be nonexistent,
Thayer has a purpose in showing the
films.
"1 initiated the Round Room series a
year-and-a-half ago to make the
Memorial Church programs felt in a
different way among the students, as
more than just Sunday religious
services," he said.
The films, however, are not selected
for their religious content. They reflect
Thayer's wide-ranging tastes — past se
ries include movies of directors
Woody Allen and Alfred Hitchcock and
a series entitled "Hollywood Classics.
This quarter's series focuses on Paul
Newman and Robert Redford, and last
week's feature was "Cool Hand Luke,"
a movie memorable for Luke's bet that
he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in an
hour.

In the* future, he intends to show a
quarter ol Meryl Streep and Diane
Keaton films, a series on Vietnam and
some of the work of Italian director
Fellini.

Thayer's taste in movies runs
counter to current popular trends in
film. "Most films today pander to
public tastes in order to earn the most
money possible. Movies have

deteriorated to the level of TV," he
said.
He prefers movies with a message
above the escapist films that constitute
the majority of those available in

theatres. "1 want to try to get people to
think about the films I show, to grapple
with the questions raised by films like
Cool Hand I.uke
That movie, despite the hilarious
egg wager scene, is a sobering study of
a rebellious anti-hero victimized by
shockingly cruel and inflexible prison
guards.
At a time when thought-provoking
movies are rare on the commercial
market, Round Room videos present
another option for the viewer who
prefers films that challenge rather than
sedate the mind.
However, some students still feel
any movie provides relief from the
harsh realities of studying. Rex Wright,
a graduate student, said: "They're a
go<xl study break when you're burned
out on Monday nights."
"Sometimes there's 75 people there,
and there are chairs all the way to the
back of the room — it depends on the
film," he added. "The Woody Allen se
ries was really popular."
Thayer said, "There hasn't been as
much viewer interest in Redford and
Newman."
The homey, comfortable setting of
the Round Room is in itself a reason to
attend one of the films. The room is, as
its name suggests, round, with a high
domed ceiling and tall windows all the
way around it. It has the homey, com
fortable atmosphere of a grandfather's
den, with a fireplace and lots of
armchairs and couches.
