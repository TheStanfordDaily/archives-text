The fact that Thomas McGuane has
published, for the first time, a book of
short stories can mean two things:
Either he is attempting, after seven
novels, to gain a sharper, more con
centrated perspective on his lifelong
thematic concerns, or his desk at
McLeod, Mont., (pop. 5) was cluttered.
Make no mistake about it. "To Skin a
Cat" is no desk-cleaning volume.
McGuane must be taken seriously
when he says, "When you finally get
the idea that, in the best hands —
Chekhov's or Cheever's for example —
short stories can do more work than an
entire novel, the level of literary re
sponsibility involved in writing them
gets ratcheted way up."
Joyce Carol Oates has called
McGuane, by way of compliment, a
"para-novelist." Reviewing his first
novel, "The Sporting Club," published
in 1969, she wrote that it gave "the su
perficial appearance of belonging to
the old reliable genre of the 'novel' but
is, in reality, in savage rebellion against
it." This effect of making the reader
cozy and comfortable, usually through
lyric descriptions of animals or the out
doors, and then bursting the din of
anarchy upon them, is a trademark of
McGuane's best work. Fans of this
emotionally manipulative technique
will be delighted with "To Skin a Cat."
Whereas his novels provide this effect
once, perhaps twice, before the reader
becomes wary, each of the 13 stories in
"To Skin a Cat" is a fresh opportunity

to be taken in and overwhelmed.
"Like a Leaf," which, along with the
volume's title story, is among the
gloomiest work McGuane has written,
nevertheless contains a moment of this
quintessential McGuanean vertigo. The
protagonist is introduced, innocently
enough, as he is placing rat poison un
derneath his house. He accidently
overhears an argument between two of
his neighbors who are having an affair.
When he gets back to his kitchen, there
are flies on the window screen, and
this triggers a mental roller coaster
paragraph of the kind for which
McGuane is justifiably infamous: "We
never had flies like this on the ranch.
We had songbirds, apple blossoms,
and no flies. My wife was alive then and
saw to that. We didn't impact, we loved
each other. She had an aneurism let go
while carding wool. She just nodded
her pretty face and headed out. I sat
there like a stupe. They came for her,
and I just knocked around the place
trying to get it. I headed for town and
started seeing the doctor. Things came
together: I was able to locate a place to
live in, catch the Series, and set up
housekeeping. Plus, the Gulch, every
one agrees, is Deadrock's nicest neigh
borhood. A traffic violator is taken
right aside and lined out quick. It's a
neighborhood where folks teach the
dog to bring the paper to the porch, so
a guy can sit back in his rocker and find
out who's making hamburger of the
world. I was one of this area's better
cattlemen, and town life doesn't come
easy. Where I once had coyotes and
bears, I now have rats. Where I once
had the oldtime marriages of my
neighboors, I now have Impact Man
poking a real sweet gal who never gets
taken someplace nice."
"To Skin a Cat" also contains a con

centration of another of McGuane's
trademarks: self-destructive characters.
This is the freedom by which
McGuane's most important characters,
both primary and secondary, can be
identified. He claims to be interested
in writing about "fatal attractions," and
often in these stories this force appears
in the conventional sense of old Holly
wood parlance. In "Partners," Dean
Robinson is finally made a partner at
his law firm. One of his first missions,
arranged by an older member of the
firm, is dinner with their biggest client.
Dean discovers that the client's wife is
an old girlfriend, Georgeanne, and
promptly tries to seduce her despite
his older colleague's threatening ad
vice. The result is a brawl with the
client, who is a former football player.
Although Dean is humiliated, it is a tri
umphant humiliation. He "went head
first into the metal frame of the daybed
and this time he was out. He was out
for such a short time, his first thought
on waking was to admire his own
vigor. He had reached Georgeanne's
house at 2:19, been knocked out and
now almost fully recovered by —
checking his watch — 2:35. It had been
years since he felt this good."
There is another kind of fatal attrac
tion among McGuane's characters. Of
ten his protagonists are drawn by the
gravitation of an idea or scheme. And
quite often these schemes are solidly
connected to a subterranean level of
anarchy that exists in all of McGuane's
work. In "A Man in Louisiana," Btfrry
Seitz is a special assistant to Mike
Royce, "the tough, relatively young
president of Ohio Exploration." Barry,
at 30, feels he is on the transitional
cusp of his future, and one "backward
move could be a menace to his whole
life." Appropriately, he is sent with

$2,000 cash to Mississippi to fetch a
dog his boss wants to give to a crooked
oil dealer in Louisiana. When he meets
the dog Bandit and his owner, Jimmy F.
Tipppett, Tippett tells him, "I was sixty
six in August. I'll never have another
dog like that." After driving away with
Bandit, Barry decides he would like to
see this remarkable dog run — he then
spends most of the afternoon and night
vainly chasing after him. At dawn, Barry
finds himself in an abandoned Con-

federate cemetery, having lost the dog
and his boss' money. Only then does
he grasp fully his epiphany, that he
meant to turn Bandit loose all along.
"It occurred to him that some of the
doomed soldiers around him had
gone to their deaths with less hysteria
and terror than he had brought to the
chase for this dog."
McGuane gives characters other
than his protagonists the same free
rein to figuratively destroy themselves.
Often his secondary characters reveal
themselves through a kind of Midwes
tern honesty and unselfconsciousness.
Frequently, the resulting dialogue is
absurd, and the effect is self-parodying.
This is, perhaps, the most serious
criticism of McGuane's work: that he
has an aristocratic non-sympathy for
the common folk who make up the
scene-painting before which his pri
mary characters act. The critic Jonathan
Yardley has gone so far as to suggest

that this defect, this lack of generous
and naive love for all his characters, is
what separates McGuane's talent from
the magnitude of, say, William
Faulkner's. Certainly such criticism is
accurate in McGuane's early work.
"The Sporting Club"and "Ninety-Two
in the Shade" contain some of the most
scathing, if humorous, self-parody by
flat characters ever written. This
criticism is less apt with his later work.
And in "To Skin a Cat," although he
still invites his characters to put their
feet in their mouths, by and large they
do it with a gentler motion. In"The
Road Atlas," Bill, the protagonist, has
come back from college in a lethargy
and is arguing business with his broth
ers, John and Walter. Bill sees himself
as Thomas Jefferson and his brothers
as the twin halves of Alexander Hamil
ton's brain, but McGuane allows them
to speak for themselves. "What we
have long understood," says Walter, "is
that you feel a mandate for greater
meaning, and we don't oppose that.
John and me are just two little old
MBAs. We want more of what we got,
and we're too old to change. When we
get this thing right, we — or one of us
— might run for office. That's where
significance as we see it kicks in."
Self-destruction is perhaps a mis
leading term when applied to
McGuane's characters. In most of his
stories, people do themselves in on
one level, whether consciously or not,
in order to reach a higher one. This
kind of destruction is not the result of
nihilistic frustration, but rather a ne
cessary step in a journey toward an
elevated state of being. Quite often, as
in the title story, "To Skin a Cat," this
higher plane is death. But in "A Skir
mish" and "Dogs," it is life with a dif
ferent awareness. McGuane is elusive

about defining this awareness, but fre
quently it is reached through close
contact with well-trained bird dogs or
working horses or the Civil War or un
adulterated wilderness or fishing.
These are the topics he treats with the
most charity and the most lyric beauty
of language. They seem to represent a
time before what he has called the
"declining snivelization" of the Ameri
can land and people.
"Flight" is a short anthem to this per
iod in time. The story concerns a ter
minally ill hunter who gives his two
perfectly trained dogs to a friend and
then shoots himself. Most of the story
is descriptive narration: "The
stagecoach road came in around from
the east again, and we stopped: two
modest ruts heading into the hills. We
released the dogs and followed the
road around for half an hour. It took us
past an old buffalo wallow filled with
water. Some teal got up into the wind
and wheeled off over die prairie."
If this sounds like Hemingway terri
tory, it is. McGuane uses the same
straightforward tone whenever he
deals with his sacred topics. But
"Flight" is only one story of 13- In the
others of this collection, when
McGuane's characters speak, the fan
tastic, vertiginous and surreal invade
this sacred territory, and the resulting
tone sounds more like Saul Bellow in
"Henderson the Rain-King." This is
Thomas McGuane's special combina
tion of talent and interest: the sacred
and the fantastic. In "To Skin a Cat," he
seems to be attempting to separate and
hone these two forces. Fans will appre
ciate the volume for this laboratory
like view of McGuane's talent. An uni
nitiated reader would do better to start
with one of his novels, where the
broad effect is magical and breathless.
