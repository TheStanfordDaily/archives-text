With its 10-0 loss to USC Saturday,
Stanford has now lost two games this
season — both at home, both by 10
points, both against traditional national
powers and both seen by national tele
vision audiences.
The similarities stop here.
The Cardinal's 24-14 loss Oct. 11 to
the Washington Huskies seemed to be
a cruel pill for an up-and-coming team
to have to swallow. Stanford's offense
dominated the Husky defense, piling
up 433 total yards, and the Cardinal,
though trailing most of the second half,
was in control of the game and ap
peared destined to upset Washington.
The loss was a result of Stanford's self
destruction; it was surely not the
Huskies' doing.
Saturday's game was an entirely dif
ferent story. Though the Cardinal was
never out of the game on the
scoreboard, at no point did the offense
give the impression that it would
score. In fact, Stanford's farthest
penetration was to the USC 38-yard
line on two occasions.
The "ifs," "should'ves" and
"could'ves" that had accompanied die
Washington loss were nowhere to be
found in the Cardinal locker room fol
lowing the USC game. There were no
blown opportunities. The USC defense
never gave the Stanford offense any
chances.
"It's a tribute to USC," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said. "They did a
great job of coaching and playing
defense. We had good field position at
times today, but USC's defense took us
off it again and again."
The shutout — the first time the
Cardinal had been blanked at home
since 1964 — was even more surpris
ing considering Stanford had piled up
41 points the previous week at
Oregon, and USC had given up 63
points in its past two outings.
Both proved to be motivating factors
for the Trojan defense.
"They (the USC defensive players)
said, 'We're going to play the defense
we're capable of playing,' " USC Coach
Ted Tollner said.
"We knew if he (Stanford quarter
back John Paye) got off, he's got a can
non," USC linebacker Marcus Cotton
said. "He's got to be able to throw it 90
yards in the air. We've watched him
pick our defense apart."
On Saturday, however, Paye threw
for little more than 90 yards the entire
game. The Cardinal, which had
averaged 347.3 total yards for the first
six games this season, gained just 172
yards (only 122 through the air)
against the Trojan defense.
If the Stanford offense was to move
the ball against USC, it was going to be
in small chunks. The Trojans employed
extra defensive backs from the outset
of the game and effectively silenced
the Cardinal's downfield passing game.
"We didn't want to give up any big
plays,"' USC strong safety Tim
McDonald said. "We knew they might
want to test us downfield. We were in a
two-deep zone. We couldn't really get
hurt by a long ball."
As a result, Stanford was forced to
throw short passes underneath the de

fensive coverage, which was illustrated
by the fact that the Cardinal averaged
just over five yards on its 23 comple
tions.
"They were doing what good of
fense dictates — trying to throw under
neath the zone," Tollner said. "You've
got to take what they give you. We just
didn't miss tackles."
The USC defense was not only fun
damentally flawless, but it also came
up with the big plays. Two of Stanford's
best chances to mount drives were
ended by Trojan interceptions.
The Cardinal had the first threat of
the game following a 30-yard USC
penalty for unnecessary roughness and
unsportsmanlike conduct on the final
play of the first quarter. With a second
and-nine from the Trojan 38, Paye at
tempted to hit wide receiver Jeff James
on an out pattern, but USC cornerback
Louis Brock stepped in front of James,
intercepted the ball and raced 40 yards
down to the Stanford 32, setting up the
Trojans' only touchdown of the after
noon.
"On that play, my responsibility was
to cover deep," Brock said. "I figured
my speed was a little better than his
(James). When he broke, I got a good
break."
Though James had been used solely
as a decoy up until that play, Brock had
not been lulled to sleep. "I figured
they'd try to throw to him," said Brock,

whose father is the Hall of Fame
baseball player of the same name. "He
was their primary receiver."
USC's other critical interception
came with 4:55 remaining in the third
quarter and the score still 7-0. The
Cardinal had the ball at the Trojan 42
when Pave fired a pass intended for
tight end Jim Price. USC linebacker
Keith Davis deflected the ball, and
McDonald grabbed it out of the air to
halt the Stanford drive.
"We had tipped two or three balls,"
McDonald said. "1 knew we were going
to get one."
As much as any other single factor,
pass deflections hurt Paye and the
Cardinal. The Trojans broke up seven
passes on the day, and many of the USC
defenders attributed their success in
part to Paye's habit of staring down his
receivers.
"That's something we noticed about
him," McDonald said, explaining that
Paye rarely looks off other receivers
before throwing to his intended target.
"It's something that maybe he has to
work on."
If Saturday's game is any indication,
the USC defense has little that it needs
to work on.
"This was the big test," McDonald
said. "They're capable of putting up a
lot of points on the board."
But Saturday, they never came close.
