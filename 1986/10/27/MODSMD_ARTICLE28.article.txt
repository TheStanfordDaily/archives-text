With its 10-0 loss to USC Saturday,
Stanford has now lost two games this
season — both at home, both by 10
points, both against traditional national
powers and both seen by national tele
vision audiences.
The similarities stop here.
The Cardinal's 24-14 loss Oct. 11 to
the Washington Huskies seemed to be
a cruel pill for an up-and-coming team
to have to swallow. Stanford's offense
dominated the Husky defense, piling
up 433 total yards, and the Cardinal,
though trailing most of the second half,
was in control of the game and ap
peared destined to upset Washington.
The loss was a result of Stanford's self
destruction; it was surely not the
Huskies' doing.
Saturday's game was an entirely dif
ferent story. Though the Cardinal was
never out of the game on the
scoreboard, at no point did the offense
give the impression that it would
score. In fact, Stanford's farthest
penetration was to the USC 38-yard
line on two occasions.
The "ifs," "should'ves" and
"could'ves" that had accompanied die
Washington loss were nowhere to be
found in the Cardinal locker room fol
lowing the USC game. There were no
blown opportunities. The USC defense
never gave the Stanford offense any
chances.
"It's a tribute to USC," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said. "They did a
great job of coaching and playing
defense. We had good field position at
times today, but USC's defense took us
off it again and again."
The shutout — the first time the
Cardinal had been blanked at home
since 1964 — was even more surpris
ing considering Stanford had piled up
41 points the previous week at
Oregon, and USC had given up 63
points in its past two outings.
Both proved to be motivating factors
for the Trojan defense.
