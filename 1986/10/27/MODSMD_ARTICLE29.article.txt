# Water polo wins 3 more, winning streak now at 34

### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
In its final homestand of the season, the No. 1-ranked
Stanford men's water polo team overwhelmed three top-20
opponents and served notice to all other would-be chal
lengers that it won't he beaten this year.
The Cardinal, which ran its unblemished record to 25-0
(3-0 in Pacific-10 Conference play), began a dominating
weekend of play on Friday, defeating No. 6 Long Beach State
14-6.
Stanford went on to beat fourth-rated USC 9-4 Saturday
and an outgunned No. 11 Brown squad yesterday 13-2.
"We just wanted to make up for last weekend," said Stan
ford Coach Dante Dettamanti, referring to last Friday's 12-8
win against UCLA. "We emphasize defense. I issued a chal
lenge to the guys — no team should score more than five
goals against us."
The Cardinal almost achieved Dettamanti's challenge,
spoiled only by a second quarter scoring spree by the Long
Beach State 49ers and senior Doug Bolicek.
Spearheaded by goalie Todd Kemp and senior Greg
Gamble, the Cardinal defense was particularly effective this
weekend, limiting the Trojans and Bruins to one goal each
in the first half.
"Our goal is shutting teams out," Kemp said. "We judge a
game by how well our defense plays."
The Cardinal offense also was in high gear this weekend,
scoring 36 goals in three games.
Craig Klass led the Cardinal scoring barrage, scoring eight

goals on the weekend. Junior Erich Fischer chipped in
seven goals, including three against the 49ers. Fischer and
Klass continue to lead Stanford in scoring this season, with
Fischer totaling 64 goals and Klass 61.
With seven regular season games left before the NCAAs
Nov. 28-30, both players have a shot at breaking James Ber
geson's ('B2) single season scoring record of 82 goals, set in
1981.
Including this weekend's victories, the Cardinal extended
its winning streak to 34 straight games dating back to last
year. Stanford can break the NCAA record (39) of con
secutive wins also held by the Cardinal (1980-1982) if it can
remain unbeaten this year.
Friday, the Cardinal opened up a 4-0 lead against Long
Beach State in the first quarter only to see the 49ers, behind
Bolicek's three goals, surge back to tie the score at six at the
start of the third period.
"We went up 4-0 and quit attacking," senior Chris
Thompson said. "Once they get their confidence up by get
ting a few goals, it makes our job a lot harder. We were mis
sing Imbo (senior David Imbernino) in the first half. Get
Imbo the ball, and he'll score."
After the score was deadlocked at six, Imbernino scored
one of his game-high four goals and began a second-half
Cardinal scoring streak of eight goals. The worn-out 49ers
did not score for the rest of the contest.
"Teams have been double-teaming him and shutting him
down this year," Dettamanti said. "He just took it upon him-

Senior Greg Ocasek, a field player from Honolulu, Hawaii, scored a goal in Stanford's 14-6 victory over nationally
ranked Long Beach State. The Cardinal also beat two other top-20 teams this weekend, scoring wins over USC and
Brown. Stanford is now 25-0 on the season.
