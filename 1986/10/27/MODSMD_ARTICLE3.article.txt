# USC shuts down Card offense
## SPORTS 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The word frustration took on a
new meaning Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
The Stanford defense played its
finest game in the last four years,
holding the usually explosive USC of
fense to just 10 points. The Stanford
offense, though, played its worst
game of the season, accumulating
only 172 yards and failing to drive to
the Trojan 35-yard line.
The result: An outstanding defen
sive performance was wasted, as the

Trojans scraped out a 10-0 victory at
Stanford Stadium before 73,500 fans
— the largest crowd in the Pacific 10
Conference this season — and a CBS
national television audience.
"It's frustrating," Stanford defen
sive tackle Tony Leiker said, "because
I thought our team was better. I hate
it when we don't live up to our po
tential. We've got a hell of team. It
hurts."
The loss drops Stanford to 2-2 in
the Pac-10, 5-2 overall, one-and-a-half
games behind conference-leader
Arizona State. The Cardinal was
ranked No. 19 in the nation by The

Associated Press last week. Unranked
USC upped its record to 3-2, 5-2 over
all.
Trojan cornerback Louis Brock —
the son of St. Louis Cardinal baseball
Hall-of-Famer Lou Brock — stepped
in front of Jeff James on the second
play of the second quarter, inter
cepted John Paye's pass, and returned
it 40 yards to the Stanford 32-yard
line.
Four plays later, on third-and
seven from the Stanford 18, USC
quarterback Rodney Peete rolled to
his left and spotted backup wide
receiver Erik Affholter open in the

end zone. Peete's pass was high, but
Affholter went up to grab it, took a hit
from cornerback Pat Kelly and came
down with the game's only touch
down.
The Cardinal had 42 minutes to
return the favor, but could get no
closer than the USC 38.
"They played an exceptional game
on defense," Paye said, "and we
didn't respond on offense."
Led by linebacker David Wyman's
22 tackles and one pass interception,
the Stanford defense held USC to
only the 32-yard touchdown drive and
a 22-yard field goal by Don Shafer with
2:29 to play.
The defense also made a classic
goal-line stand to keep the Cardinal in
the ballgame on the drive following
the touchdown. Peete had hit wide
receiver Randy Tanner on the left
sideline, and cornerback Alan Grant
had knocked Tanner out of bounds at
the Stanford 1.
On first-and-goal, Walt Harris and
Bruce Richardson stopped fullback
Leroy Holt off tackle. On second down,
Barry McKeever stuck tailback Aaron
Emanuel running at the same hole. On
third down, Peete tried a keeper, but
was forced back by the heart of the
Stanford line.
On fourth-and-goal, with only a foot
between them and a 14-0 lead, the
Trojans chose to go for the touchdown.
Peete handed to Emanuel, who never
got the ball, and Kurt Colehower
recovered for Stanford at the 3.
'You've just got to keep going and
force them to execute,'' Leiker said.
"The closer you are to the goal line,
the easier it is for the defense, because
you've got less area to cover."
In the fourth quarter, the defense
turned in another series that would
maybe, it seemed, turn the game
around. On three consecutive downs,
Peete was sacked, first by Chris Weber
and Sean Scheller, then twice by
Leiker, turning a first-and-10 at the
Stanford 37 into a fourth-and-32.
Thomas Henley, who had broken a
punt return for a 92-yard touchdown
the week before at Oregon, returned
the ensuing punt 18 yards to the Stan
ford 41. The offense, however, went
backward four yards before Doug
Robison punted 63 yards into the
Trojan end zone.
USC, which controlled the ball for
38 minutes and ran 81 offensive plays
to 52 for Stanford, took the ball with
8:45 to play and marched for over six
minutes to set up Shafer's clinching
field goal. Unheralded third-string tail
back Steve Webster, in his first action
of the season, ground out most of that
yardage and finished with 60 yards in
the second half.
The Cardinal defense hadn't given
up, though, despite the frustration of
watching an ineffective offense fail to
score. "Even on the last drive," Leiker
said, "we thought we were in it. With
our offense, any play can be a touch
down. It just didn't happen today."
The whitewashing was the first time
the Cardinal had been blanked at Stan
ford Stadium since 1964 and the first

USC shutout here since 1932. The last
time the Cardinal had been held score
less was last year against Washington in
Seattle.
The Trojan defense had come into
Saturday's game surrendering 387
yards per game, including 192 yards
rushing. The Cardinal only ran the ball
15 times for 50 yards. Brad Muster was
the top Stanford ground gainer, with
35 yards in eight carries.
"We had to have a better day run
ning," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said,
"and I'm not sure I gave them the
chance to have a better game running.
When you come out of a game like this,
you look at all kinds of things. I think
I'd be a fool if I said I coached a terrific
game. If I'd have done a goddamn
good job of coaching, we'd have gotten

14 points and won 14-10. We didn't get
any goddamn rhythm."
"I thought we could control the run
a little more," Muster said. "They prob
ably saw something upstairs and
thought we could pass better. For our
passing game to work, we've got to
throw them off with the run. It didn't
seem to mix too well out there today."
USC used five defensive backs on
first-down situations, going to six in
passing situations, trying to take away
Stanford's wide receiver combination
of James and Henley. It was successful.
Each caught only two passes — James
for 19 yards, Henley for 15. An 18-yard
reception by James was the Cardinal's
longest offensive play of the game.
"Our offense never got untracked,"
Paye said. "We never had any big plays.

That might have been a problem — the
fact we were continually looking to
make the big play. Coach Elway says it's
like a hitter going up trying to hit a
home run every time — you've just got
to do what you normally do and it will
come."
"I can't say I was open all day,"
James said, "but I can't say 1 was cov
ered all day, either. We knew their
defense would give us problems."
"Our defense kept us in the game,"
USC Coach Ted Tollner said. "We kept
Paye from making the big pass. We
changed up the ratio of rushes, tried to
keep him off balance, and our
coverage was outstanding. We didn't
want to give them a cheap score."
Against the nickel and dime
defenses, Paye was forced to dump off

to his backs most of the afternoon. He
completed 23-of-37 passes, but for only
122 yards, and he was intercepted
three times. His average per comple
tion was 5.3 yards.
Fullback Brian Morris was the Card
inal's leading receiver, catching nine
passes for 42 yards. Muster caught six
balls for 29 yards.
"They mixed up their defenses real
well," James said. "Sometimes we'd
have to go with a secondary receiver or
dumpoffs."
It could almost be said that the rea
son Stanford lost was that its defense
failed to score. "In the past, we've got
ten turnovers," Leiker said. "We didn't
today. We had the big plays like


USC defenders like linebacker Marcus Cotten (58), a junior from Oakland,
gave Stanford quarterback John Paye problems all day Saturday, despite the

Lisa Romerein/Daily
efforts of offensive lineman Kurt Josephson (71). The Trojan defense was
credited with seven passes broken up, to go along with three interceptions.
the goal-line stand and the sacks, but
no turnover to turn the game around."
Elway has always divided the game
into offensive, defensive and special
teams play, and maintained that win

ning two will win the whole game. "We
certainly played well enough
defensively to win," he said. "The spe
cial teams were fine. The extreme was
the offense."
Then he added an exception to his
rule: "When you get shut out, you're
not going to win."

Card notes
Cornerback Toi Cook returned to action
in the third quarter Saturday after having
suffered a fractured wrist three weeks ago
that doctors said would keep him out for
the season. "I feel like I played all right,"
Cook said. "I was hoping to get into the
game a little sooner." Cook finished with
two tackles.

Leiker, turning a first-and-10 at the
Stanford 37 into a fourth-and-32.
Thomas Henley, who had broken a
punt return for a 92-yard touchdown
the week before at Oregon, returned
the ensuing punt 18 yards to the Stan
ford 41. The offense, however, went
backward four yards before Doug
Robison punted 63 yards into the
Trojan end zone.
USC, which controlled the ball for
38 minutes and ran 81 offensive plays
to 52 for Stanford, took the ball with
8:45 to play and marched for over six
minutes to set up Shafer's clinching
field goal. Unheralded third-string tail
back Steve Webster, in his first action
of the season, ground out most of that
yardage and finished with 60 yards in
the second half.
The Cardinal defense hadn't given
up, though, despite the frustration of
watching an ineffective offense fail to
score. "Even on the last drive," Leiker
said, "we thought we were in it. With
our offense, any play can be a touch
down. It just didn't happen today."
The whitewashing was the first time
the Cardinal had been blanked at Stan
ford Stadium since 1964 and the first

USC shutout here since 1932. The last
time the Cardinal had been held score
less was last year against Washington in
Seattle.
The Trojan defense had come into
Saturday's game surrendering 387
yards per game, including 192 yards
rushing. The Cardinal only ran the ball
15 times for 50 yards. Brad Muster was
the top Stanford ground gainer, with
35 yards in eight carries.
"We had to have a better day run
ning," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said,
"and I'm not sure I gave them the
chance to have a better game running.
When you come out of a game like this,
you look at all kinds of things. I think
I'd be a fool if I said I coached a terrific
game. If I'd have done a goddamn
good job of coaching, we'd have gotten

14 points and won 14-10. We didn't get
any goddamn rhythm."
"I thought we could control the run
a little more," Muster said. "They prob
ably saw something upstairs and
thought we could pass better. For our
passing game to work, we've got to
throw them off with the run. It didn't
seem to mix too well out there today."
USC used five defensive backs on
first-down situations, going to six in
passing situations, trying to take away
Stanford's wide receiver combination
of James and Henley. It was successful.
Each caught only two passes — James
for 19 yards, Henley for 15. An 18-yard
reception by James was the Cardinal's
longest offensive play of the game.
"Our offense never got untracked,"
Paye said. "We never had any big plays.

That might have been a problem — the
fact we were continually looking to
make the big play. Coach Elway says it's
like a hitter going up trying to hit a
home run every time — you've just got
to do what you normally do and it will
come."
"I can't say I was open all day,"
James said, "but I can't say 1 was cov
ered all day, either. We knew their
defense would give us problems."
"Our defense kept us in the game,"
USC Coach Ted Tollner said. "We kept
Paye from making the big pass. We
changed up the ratio of rushes, tried to
keep him off balance, and our
coverage was outstanding. We didn't
want to give them a cheap score."
Against the nickel and dime
defenses, Paye was forced to dump off

to his backs most of the afternoon. He
completed 23-of-37 passes, but for only
122 yards, and he was intercepted
three times. His average per comple
tion was 5.3 yards.
Fullback Brian Morris was the Card
inal's leading receiver, catching nine
passes for 42 yards. Muster caught six
balls for 29 yards.
"They mixed up their defenses real
well," James said. "Sometimes we'd
have to go with a secondary receiver or
dumpoffs."
It could almost be said that the rea
son Stanford lost was that its defense
failed to score. "In the past, we've got
ten turnovers," Leiker said. "We didn't
today. We had the big plays like


USC defenders like linebacker Marcus Cotten (58), a junior from Oakland,
gave Stanford quarterback John Paye problems all day Saturday, despite the

Lisa Romerein/Daily
efforts of offensive lineman Kurt Josephson (71). The Trojan defense was
credited with seven passes broken up, to go along with three interceptions.
the goal-line stand and the sacks, but
no turnover to turn the game around."
Elway has always divided the game
into offensive, defensive and special
teams play, and maintained that win

ning two will win the whole game. "We
certainly played well enough
defensively to win," he said. "The spe
cial teams were fine. The extreme was
the offense."
Then he added an exception to his
rule: "When you get shut out, you're
not going to win."

Card notes
Cornerback Toi Cook returned to action
in the third quarter Saturday after having
suffered a fractured wrist three weeks ago
that doctors said would keep him out for
the season. "I feel like I played all right,"
Cook said. "I was hoping to get into the
game a little sooner." Cook finished with
two tackles.
The word frustration took on a
new meaning Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
The Stanford defense played its
finest game in the last four years,
holding the usually explosive USC of
fense to just 10 points. The Stanford
offense, though, played its worst
game of the season, accumulating
only 172 yards and failing to drive to
the Trojan 35-yard line.
The result: An outstanding defen
sive performance was wasted, as the

Trojans scraped out a 10-0 victory at
Stanford Stadium before 73,500 fans
— the largest crowd in the Pacific 10
Conference this season — and a CBS
national television audience.
"It's frustrating," Stanford defen
sive tackle Tony Leiker said, "because
I thought our team was better. I hate
it when we don't live up to our po
tential. We've got a hell of team. It
hurts."
The loss drops Stanford to 2-2 in
the Pac-10, 5-2 overall, one-and-a-half
games behind conference-leader
Arizona State. The Cardinal was
ranked No. 19 in the nation by The

Associated Press last week. Unranked
USC upped its record to 3-2, 5-2 over
all.
Trojan cornerback Louis Brock —
the son of St. Louis Cardinal baseball
Hall-of-Famer Lou Brock — stepped
in front of Jeff James on the second
play of the second quarter, inter
cepted John Paye's pass, and returned
it 40 yards to the Stanford 32-yard
line.
Four plays later, on third-and
seven from the Stanford 18, USC
quarterback Rodney Peete rolled to
his left and spotted backup wide
receiver Erik Affholter open in the

end zone. Peete's pass was high, but
Affholter went up to grab it, took a hit
from cornerback Pat Kelly and came
down with the game's only touch
down.
The Cardinal had 42 minutes to
return the favor, but could get no
closer than the USC 38.
"They played an exceptional game
on defense," Paye said, "and we
didn't respond on offense."
Led by linebacker David Wyman's
22 tackles and one pass interception,
the Stanford defense held USC to
only the 32-yard touchdown drive and
a 22-yard field goal by Don Shafer with
2:29 to play.
The defense also made a classic
goal-line stand to keep the Cardinal in
the ballgame on the drive following
the touchdown. Peete had hit wide
receiver Randy Tanner on the left
sideline, and cornerback Alan Grant
had knocked Tanner out of bounds at
the Stanford 1.
On first-and-goal, Walt Harris and
Bruce Richardson stopped fullback
Leroy Holt off tackle. On second down,
Barry McKeever stuck tailback Aaron
Emanuel running at the same hole. On
third down, Peete tried a keeper, but
was forced back by the heart of the
Stanford line.
On fourth-and-goal, with only a foot
between them and a 14-0 lead, the
Trojans chose to go for the touchdown.
Peete handed to Emanuel, who never
got the ball, and Kurt Colehower
recovered for Stanford at the 3.
'You've just got to keep going and
force them to execute,'' Leiker said.
"The closer you are to the goal line,
the easier it is for the defense, because
you've got less area to cover."
In the fourth quarter, the defense
turned in another series that would
maybe, it seemed, turn the game
around. On three consecutive downs,
Peete was sacked, first by Chris Weber
and Sean Scheller, then twice by
Leiker, turning a first-and-10 at the
Stanford 37 into a fourth-and-32.
Thomas Henley, who had broken a
punt return for a 92-yard touchdown
the week before at Oregon, returned
the ensuing punt 18 yards to the Stan
ford 41. The offense, however, went
backward four yards before Doug
Robison punted 63 yards into the
Trojan end zone.

want to give them a cheap score."
Against the nickel and dime
defenses, Paye was forced to dump off

to his backs most of the afternoon. He
completed 23-of-37 passes, but for only
122 yards, and he was intercepted
three times. His average per comple
tion was 5.3 yards.
Fullback Brian Morris was the Card
inal's leading receiver, catching nine
passes for 42 yards. Muster caught six
balls for 29 yards.
"They mixed up their defenses real
well," James said. "Sometimes we'd
have to go with a secondary receiver or
dumpoffs."
It could almost be said that the rea
son Stanford lost was that its defense
failed to score. "In the past, we've got
ten turnovers," Leiker said. "We didn't
today. We had the big plays like


USC defenders like linebacker Marcus Cotten (58), a junior from Oakland,
gave Stanford quarterback John Paye problems all day Saturday, despite the

efforts of offensive lineman Kurt Josephson (71). The Trojan defense was

the goal-line stand and the sacks, but
no turnover to turn the game around."
Elway has always divided the game
into offensive, defensive and special
teams play, and maintained that win

ning two will win the whole game. "We
certainly played well enough
defensively to win," he said. "The spe
cial teams were fine. The extreme was
the offense."
Then he added an exception to his
rule: "When you get shut out, you're
not going to win."

Card notes
Cornerback Toi Cook returned to action
in the third quarter Saturday after having
suffered a fractured wrist three weeks ago
that doctors said would keep him out for
the season. "I feel like I played all right,"
Cook said. "I was hoping to get into the
game a little sooner." Cook finished with
two tackles.
The word frustration took on a
new meaning Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
The Stanford defense played its
finest game in the last four years,
holding the usually explosive USC of
fense to just 10 points. The Stanford
offense, though, played its worst
game of the season, accumulating
only 172 yards and failing to drive to
the Trojan 35-yard line.
The result: An outstanding defen
sive performance was wasted, as the

Trojans scraped out a 10-0 victory at
Stanford Stadium before 73,500 fans
— the largest crowd in the Pacific 10
Conference this season — and a CBS
national television audience.
"It's frustrating," Stanford defen
sive tackle Tony Leiker said, "because
I thought our team was better. I hate
it when we don't live up to our po
tential. We've got a hell of team. It
hurts."
The loss drops Stanford to 2-2 in
the Pac-10, 5-2 overall, one-and-a-half
games behind conference-leader
Arizona State. The Cardinal was
ranked No. 19 in the nation by The

Associated Press last week. Unranked
USC upped its record to 3-2, 5-2 over
all.
Trojan cornerback Louis Brock —
the son of St. Louis Cardinal baseball
Hall-of-Famer Lou Brock — stepped
in front of Jeff James on the second
play of the second quarter, inter
cepted John Paye's pass, and returned
it 40 yards to the Stanford 32-yard
line.
Four plays later, on third-and
seven from the Stanford 18, USC
quarterback Rodney Peete rolled to
his left and spotted backup wide
receiver Erik Affholter open in the

end zone. Peete's pass was high, but
Affholter went up to grab it, took a hit
from cornerback Pat Kelly and came
down with the game's only touch
down.
The Cardinal had 42 minutes to
return the favor, but could get no
closer than the USC 38.
"They played an exceptional game
on defense," Paye said, "and we
didn't respond on offense."
Led by linebacker David Wyman's
22 tackles and one pass interception,
the Stanford defense held USC to
only the 32-yard touchdown drive and
a 22-yard field goal by Don Shafer with
2:29 to play.
The defense also made a classic
goal-line stand to keep the Cardinal in
the ballgame on the drive following
the touchdown. Peete had hit wide
receiver Randy Tanner on the left
sideline, and cornerback Alan Grant
had knocked Tanner out of bounds at
the Stanford 1.
On first-and-goal, Walt Harris and
Bruce Richardson stopped fullback
Leroy Holt off tackle. On second down,
Barry McKeever stuck tailback Aaron
Emanuel running at the same hole. On
third down, Peete tried a keeper, but
was forced back by the heart of the
Stanford line.
On fourth-and-goal, with only a foot
between them and a 14-0 lead, the
Trojans chose to go for the touchdown.
Peete handed to Emanuel, who never
got the ball, and Kurt Colehower
recovered for Stanford at the 3.
'You've just got to keep going and
force them to execute,'' Leiker said.
"The closer you are to the goal line,
the easier it is for the defense, because
you've got less area to cover."
In the fourth quarter, the defense
turned in another series that would
maybe, it seemed, turn the game
around. On three consecutive downs,
Peete was sacked, first by Chris Weber
and Sean Scheller, then twice by
Leiker, turning a first-and-10 at the
Stanford 37 into a fourth-and-32.
Thomas Henley, who had broken a
punt return for a 92-yard touchdown
the week before at Oregon, returned
the ensuing punt 18 yards to the Stan
ford 41. The offense, however, went
backward four yards before Doug
Robison punted 63 yards into the
Trojan end zone.
USC, which controlled the ball for
38 minutes and ran 81 offensive plays
to 52 for Stanford, took the ball with
8:45 to play and marched for over six
minutes to set up Shafer's clinching
field goal. Unheralded third-string tail
back Steve Webster, in his first action
of the season, ground out most of that
yardage and finished with 60 yards in
the second half.
The Cardinal defense hadn't given
up, though, despite the frustration of
watching an ineffective offense fail to
score. "Even on the last drive," Leiker
said, "we thought we were in it. With
our offense, any play can be a touch
down. It just didn't happen today."
The whitewashing was the first time
the Cardinal had been blanked at Stan
ford Stadium since 1964 and the first

USC shutout here since 1932. The last
time the Cardinal had been held score
less was last year against Washington in
Seattle.
The Trojan defense had come into
Saturday's game surrendering 387
yards per game, including 192 yards
rushing. The Cardinal only ran the ball
15 times for 50 yards. Brad Muster was
the top Stanford ground gainer, with
35 yards in eight carries.
"We had to have a better day run
ning," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said,
"and I'm not sure I gave them the
chance to have a better game running.
When you come out of a game like this,
you look at all kinds of things. I think
I'd be a fool if I said I coached a terrific
game. If I'd have done a goddamn
good job of coaching, we'd have gotten

14 points and won 14-10. We didn't get
any goddamn rhythm."
"I thought we could control the run
a little more," Muster said. "They prob
ably saw something upstairs and
thought we could pass better. For our
passing game to work, we've got to
throw them off with the run. It didn't
seem to mix too well out there today."
USC used five defensive backs on
first-down situations, going to six in
passing situations, trying to take away
Stanford's wide receiver combination
of James and Henley. It was successful.
Each caught only two passes — James
for 19 yards, Henley for 15. An 18-yard
reception by James was the Cardinal's
longest offensive play of the game.
"Our offense never got untracked,"
Paye said. "We never had any big plays.

That might have been a problem — the
fact we were continually looking to
make the big play. Coach Elway says it's
like a hitter going up trying to hit a
home run every time — you've just got
to do what you normally do and it will
come."
"I can't say I was open all day,"
James said, "but I can't say 1 was cov
ered all day, either. We knew their
defense would give us problems."
"Our defense kept us in the game,"
USC Coach Ted Tollner said. "We kept
Paye from making the big pass. We
changed up the ratio of rushes, tried to
keep him off balance, and our
coverage was outstanding. We didn't
want to give them a cheap score."
Against the nickel and dime
defenses, Paye was forced to dump off

to his backs most of the afternoon. He
completed 23-of-37 passes, but for only
122 yards, and he was intercepted
three times. His average per comple
tion was 5.3 yards.
Fullback Brian Morris was the Card
inal's leading receiver, catching nine
passes for 42 yards. Muster caught six
balls for 29 yards.
"They mixed up their defenses real
well," James said. "Sometimes we'd
have to go with a secondary receiver or
dumpoffs."
