# USC shuts down Card offense

The word frustration took on a
new meaning Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
The Stanford defense played its
finest game in the last four years,
holding the usually explosive USC of
fense to just 10 points. The Stanford
offense, though, played its worst
game of the season, accumulating
only 172 yards and failing to drive to
the Trojan 35-yard line.
The result: An outstanding defen
sive performance was wasted, as the

Trojans scraped out a 10-0 victory at
Stanford Stadium before 73,500 fans
— the largest crowd in the Pacific 10
Conference this season — and a CBS
national television audience.
"It's frustrating," Stanford defen
sive tackle Tony Leiker said, "because
I thought our team was better. I hate
it when we don't live up to our po
tential. We've got a hell of team. It
hurts."
The loss drops Stanford to 2-2 in
the Pac-10, 5-2 overall, one-and-a-half
games behind conference-leader
Arizona State. The Cardinal was
ranked No. 19 in the nation by The

Associated Press last week. Unranked
USC upped its record to 3-2, 5-2 over
all.
Trojan cornerback Louis Brock —
the son of St. Louis Cardinal baseball
Hall-of-Famer Lou Brock — stepped
in front of Jeff James on the second
play of the second quarter, inter
cepted John Paye's pass, and returned
it 40 yards to the Stanford 32-yard
line.
Four plays later, on third-and
seven from the Stanford 18, USC
quarterback Rodney Peete rolled to
his left and spotted backup wide
receiver Erik Affholter open in the

end zone. Peete's pass was high, but
Affholter went up to grab it, took a hit
from cornerback Pat Kelly and came
down with the game's only touch
down.
The Cardinal had 42 minutes to
return the favor, but could get no
closer than the USC 38.
"They played an exceptional game
on defense," Paye said, "and we
didn't respond on offense."
Led by linebacker David Wyman's
22 tackles and one pass interception,
the Stanford defense held USC to
