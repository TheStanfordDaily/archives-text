# Men's soccer finally scores a goal, but loses to league-leading Dons
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
The Cardinal is over the hump. It
ended a scoreless streak that lasted
three games — all 1-0 losses. Even
more impressive, the Stanford men's
soccer team played the University of
San Francisco dead-even for 75
minutes before falling 3-1
The Dons came into yesterday's
game ranked sixth in the nation and
holding a 13-1-2 record. Unbeaten in
conference play, USF now has a 13-
game winning streak. Their only loss
came to national power St. Louis.
Stanford has now lost four in a row
and is 5-9-2 overall, 0-3 in the Pacific
Soccer Conference.
Stanford, despite playing well in the

early going, fell behind 1-0 as the Dons
struck first at the 17:11 mark of the first
half. Sophomore forward Kit Halver
son made an uncontested run through
the penalty area to one-touch a free
kick from the right side past Stanford
goalie Tom Austin.
The Cardinal has had problems
coming from behind all season. It
has yet to come from behind to win a
game this year. But on this day, the at
tack would not be denied a goal. Stan
ford outplayed USF the remainder of
the half and created many excellent
scoring opportunities.
The first came on a corner kick just a
few minutes after the USF goal The
ball sailed over the USF keeper's head
and fell untouched, but a Stanford shot
in goalmouth traffic was blocked by

USF defenders and cleared before the
rebound could be converted.
Next came an impressive run by
freshman forward Chris Porch that cul
minated in a beautiful pass to junior
forward/midfielder Brian Mahaffey for
a potential breakaway. Mahaffey s first
touch skipped ahead of him, however,
and was gobbled up by the USF
keeper.
The Cardinal, still applying relent
less pressure up front, finally con
nected on the goal that ended its score
less streak and, more important,
brought it even in a hard-fought
first half. It came on a free kick that was
headed into the center by junior for
ward Ross Torres and converted by
freshman Jeff Rona at the 42:23 mark. It
was Rona's first goal of the season.

' It was exciting. The hall skipped off
a defender and was sitting there. I hit
the ball with pretty good pace and it
surprised the defender standing in
front of me. It deflected off the
defender's toe and went in," Rona said.
"I'm in a position to get into games
when I'm needed. I usually play about
30-35 minutes a game, and I've been
very happy with that for my freshman
season. In such a big game, the
adrenaline gets going and people run
hard a lot They get tired more quickly.
I've been playing a lot better than I did
at the beginning of the season," he
said.
Stanford Coach Sam Koch echoed
his sentiments.
"It was a good goal. Jeffs playing better.
He's going to do well for us the next three
years," Koch said.
The second half was a different story al
together. First a cross-field goal kick almost
cost Stanford a score, as a Don player was able
to cut it off. The chance fell by the wayside.
Tom Austin then made an excellent save of a
shot created by a questionable USF free kick
from the left corner.
The Stanford coaches tried to counter some

of USF's constant pressure by having Austin,
for a short time, punt the ball rather than
throw it whenever he got possession. The full
back line also tried to create some space for
Austin by pulling up outside the penalty area
in an attempt to force the USF forwards into an
offside position
It worked for about 10 minutes, but the
Dons ultimately struck for the go-ahead goal at
78:42 on Halverson's second tally of the game,
with an assist from senior defender Ken
Boardman.
The Dons put the game out of reach on a
breakaway goal by Don Murphy at the 85:33
mark. Stanford was on the far side of the field
looking for the tying goal.

coming from behind all season. It
has yet to come from behind to win a
game this year. But on this day, the at
tack would not be denied a goal. Stan
ford outplayed USF the remainder of
the half and created many excellent
scoring opportunities.
The first came on a corner kick just a
few minutes after the USF goal The
ball sailed over the USF keeper's head
and fell untouched, but a Stanford shot
in goalmouth traffic was blocked by

USF defenders and cleared before the
rebound could be converted.
Next came an impressive run by
freshman forward Chris Porch that cul
minated in a beautiful pass to junior
forward/midfielder Brian Mahaffey for
a potential breakaway. Mahaffey s first
touch skipped ahead of him, however,
and was gobbled up by the USF
keeper.
The Cardinal, still applying relent
less pressure up front, finally con
nected on the goal that ended its score
less streak and, more important,
brought it even in a hard-fought
first half. It came on a free kick that was
headed into the center by junior for
ward Ross Torres and converted by
freshman Jeff Rona at the 42:23 mark. It
was Rona's first goal of the season.

' It was exciting. The hall skipped off
a defender and was sitting there. I hit
the ball with pretty good pace and it
surprised the defender standing in
front of me. It deflected off the
defender's toe and went in," Rona said.
"I'm in a position to get into games
when I'm needed. I usually play about
30-35 minutes a game, and I've been
very happy with that for my freshman
season. In such a big game, the
adrenaline gets going and people run
hard a lot They get tired more quickly.
I've been playing a lot better than I did
at the beginning of the season," he
said.
Stanford Coach Sam Koch echoed
his sentiments.
"It was a good goal. Jeffs playing better.
He's going to do well for us the next three
years," Koch said.
The second half was a different story al
together. First a cross-field goal kick almost
cost Stanford a score, as a Don player was able
to cut it off. The chance fell by the wayside.
Tom Austin then made an excellent save of a
shot created by a questionable USF free kick
from the left corner.
The Stanford coaches tried to counter some

of USF's constant pressure by having Austin,
for a short time, punt the ball rather than
throw it whenever he got possession. The full
back line also tried to create some space for
Austin by pulling up outside the penalty area
in an attempt to force the USF forwards into an
offside position
It worked for about 10 minutes, but the
Dons ultimately struck for the go-ahead goal at
78:42 on Halverson's second tally of the game,
with an assist from senior defender Ken
Boardman.
The Dons put the game out of reach on a
breakaway goal by Don Murphy at the 85:33
mark. Stanford was on the far side of the field
looking for the tying goal.

had Stanford's first shot on goal in the second half of a losing effort against nationally
ranked USF. The Saskatchewan, Canada, native has one goal on the season for the Card
inal.
