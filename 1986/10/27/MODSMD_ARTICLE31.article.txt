# Volleyball beats Cal, tied at top in league
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
No matter what the sport, when
California and Stanford face off, nei
ther team can ever afford to expect
anything hut the best from the
other, even when one is ranked
10th in the country and the other
isn't ranked at all. Friday night's
women's volleyball match was a
case in point.
A good-sized Maples Pavilion
crowd, with fans from both sides of
the Bay, saw unranked Cal come
out strong to win the first game 15-
13. You must win three games to
take a volleyball match, though â€”
which Stanford then did by scores
of 15-9,15-7, and 15-5 The Cardinal
is now 12-6, the Bears 13-12.

Both schools are in the Pacific 10
Conference but are far apart in the
standings. Stanford, with an 8-1
record in league play, is tied for
first with UQA Cal is sixth at 4-5.
"We Just weren't quite ready to
play," Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said. "Maybe we took them a little
too lightly."
Despite being "not quite ready,"
Stanford jumped out in front in the
first game 11-7 a. l freshman Lara
Asper's serving provided the im
petus for four straight Cardinal
points Everything looked fine for
the Cardinal until a streak of errors
brought Cal back into the game.
"We went up 11-7 in the first
game," Shaw said, "then we just missed
four hits in a row."
As the game scores show, after the
first game, Stanford became
progressively stronger, and Cal became
progressively weaker. Bear blocking
broke down and the Cardinal defense,
realizing exactly who its enemy was,
keyed on Rochelle and shut her down.
Rochelle would get only four more
kills through the entire match and
finished with a .024 hitting percentage.
Cardinal junior Theresa Smith led
the offensive attack with 24 kills and a
percentage of .489. Cal was not able to
mirror the defensive tactics of Stan
ford, though, which had co-captains
Brooke Hahner and Barbra Fontana
and junior Nancy Reno hitting well.
Reno was the runner-up to Smith in
kills with 15 and finished with a suc
cess rate of .312; Fontana had 14. The
Cardinal domination of the nets gave it
a .325 team hitting percentage to Cal's
.128.
The most amazing number from
Friday's match is Fontana's dig total.
After leading Stanford with a respec
table 14 digs against UCLA last
weekend, Fontana totaled 29 versus
the Bears, giving her a team-leading
season total of 230.
Shaw said Cal's obvious dependence
on Rochelle for offense was not diffi
cult to exploit. "She's the one player
they have who's got good size," he
said. "In between the second and third
games, we took a look at where she
had been hitting and then tried to
cover those spots in the final games."
After winning the third game on an
ace by Smith, Stanford gave a little
ground, losing the first four points of
what would be the match's last game.
Then, with Fontana serving, the Card
inal ran off 10 straight points before
the Bears finally won the service back.
Cal would get only one more point
though, and Stanford easily sealed the
match, with Smith again serving the
game-winning point.

ious in a four-game match. Top hitters for the Cardinal include sophomore Laura Oleson, who
redshirted last season and still has three more years of eligibility.
