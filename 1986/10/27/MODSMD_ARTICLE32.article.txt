# Game 7 tonight; Hurst will start

NEW YORK (AP) — Boston Manager
John McNamara, gambling with an ex
tra off day after last night's rainout, will
start left-hander Bruce Hurst on three
days' rest against the New York Mets'
Ron Darling in tonight's decisive
seventh game of the World Series.
McNamara said Hurst, winner in
Games 1 and 5, will start instead of
right-hander Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd,
but he would not discuss the decision.
Darling, who has not allowed an
earned run in 14 innings over two Se
ries starts, will be pitching with his
standard four days' rest. He lost the
first game, 1-0, on an unearned run
and won the fourth, 6-2, leaving after
seven shutout innings.
"I'll just go as hard as 1 can for as
long as I can," Darling said. "It's an
other night without sleep, but I guess
it'll help to get another day's rest."

Hurst, 13-8 during the season and 5-
0 in September, had a streak of 15
scoreless innings before the Mets
reached him for two runs in Game 5.
McNamara had been trying to avoid
using him on three days' rest, using
right-hander Al Nipper in Game 4 and
naming Boyd to start the final game.
Boyd, who gave up six runs in seven
innings of the Mets' 7-1 victory in
Game 3, told USA Today: "It hurts so
bad, but what can I do? Bruce is on a
re!!, ar>H Mac thinks the Mets have a
better left-handed lineup.
"It's just that it was my turn, and after
all I've been through.... I'm sorry, but
my sensitivities are going to show
through every time."
Boyd, who threw a tantrum in the
Red Sox clubhouse after not being
named to the All-Star team and was
suspended by the team, turned to Nip

per, his closest friend on the team.
"Nip cooled me down — talked
sense to me," Boyd said.
"This hurts more (than not going to
the All-Star Game) because I was so
psyched to pitch the one game that
means everything. Mac said I'd be the
first out of the bullpen, but I really
don't know if the intensity will be
there. How'd they expect me to feel
after this?"
Boyd, however, said there would be
no emotional outburst as there was in
July.
"I'll fool them this time," Boyd said.
"I'm not going to do nothing. I'm
going to take this like a man. What else
can I do?"
The Series' last game now will be
played at 5:10 p.m. PST, placing it in
direct competition with the NFL's Mon
day night football game this week, the
New York Giants vs. the Washington
Redskins.
McNamara said that while he wasn't
sure the day off would be good for his
team, it was for him since he missed a
few winks over Game 6, which the Red
Sox lost 6-5.
"I had a sleepless night last night
after that ballgame. Coming that close
to the championship it was a very diffi
cult morning," McNamara said.
One reporter started to ask
McNamara a question saying, "When
you woke up this morning ..
McNamara interrupted and said, "I
didn't go to sleep."
A spokesman for Commissioner
Peter Ueberroth said baseball adminis
trator Bill Murray and umpires John
Kibler and Jim Evans spent most of the
day at Shea Stadium inspecting the
ground and reviewing the weather
forecast. The forecast called for contin
ued rain much of last night.
The spokesman said the forecast for
tonight calls for variable cloudiness
with a possible passing shower and
temperatures in the mid 50s.
