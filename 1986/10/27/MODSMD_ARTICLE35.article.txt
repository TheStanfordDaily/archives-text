# Representative advocates careers in public service

California Representative John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose)
Friday encouraged students to get involved involved in
public service during a speech at Terman Auditorium.
Get involved, he said. "Find out somebody who's in it.
Volunteer and make yourself known," Vasconcellos told a
crowd of about 15.
Calling a career in public service "a very full way to live,"
he said: It's utterly challenging and very satisfying — and
sometimes extremely frustrating."
The representative explained that California provides the
perfect atmosphere for those who wish to become involved
in public service. He said the state's economic resources in
computers and technology in the Silicon Valley and its array
of human and physical resources provide "the opponunity
and invitation to engage ourselves in this 'human labora
tory and really put it together like no one has ever done it."
Public service is an undertaking in which all one's abili
ties are challenged, Vasconcellos said. "It will have its diffi
cult times. It can be lonely and painful, difficult and ex
asperating. But if you can endure that and pay your dues,
and you're willing to stand there and make yourself
credible, I would encourage you to develop it fully. Society
needs those who are willing to carry themselves with a
sense of integrity and dignity."
Vasconcellos has represented the 23rd district, which in
cludes Santa Clara and San Jose counties, for 20 years. He is
running for his 11th term this November.
Vasconcellos said he became involved in public service

after receiving both undergraduate and law degrees from
Santa Clara University and practicing law for five years, with
one year in between of working in the governors office.
He attributes his longevity in the political arena partly to
his background. "I've been lucky. You have to be real
shrewd to establish yourself as credible. I grew up in the
right schools, attended the right church and was pan of a
prominent law firm. I've always been very careful to service
my constituents. People who trust you will go a long way
with you, even if they disagree with you. I've also been a
careful negotiator on the Ways and Means Committee."
Vasconcellos wished to leave the students with three
thoughts on politics: Politics is "neither abstract nor
esoteric. It's us," he said. He added that he feels Republicans
and Democrats share the same goals, "but it'§ about the
means and not the ends." Finally, the 54 year-old Democrat
added that politics are the "function of the sense of the self."
In other words, he said, the individual is really the essence
of politics.
He explained the task force, to be comprised of individ
uals from "all walks of life," was preferred over university
research because it is a public group. "For the feeling of
ownership, it will be a good mix to give credibility and di
versity of input." The long-term goal of the task force would
be to initiate self-esteem workshops throughout the state,
he said.
The Vasconcellos' speech was the first of six seminars
sponsored by the Public Service Center, held at Terman.
The aim of the series, according to the PSC, is "to expose the
students to distinguished individuals who are working in
the public service arena."
