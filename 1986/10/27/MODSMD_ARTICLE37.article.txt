The Kappa Alpha fraternity defused a
potentially explosive situation at their
bar night Thursday, dispersing 200 par
tiers without incident after Stanford
police officers asked them to lower the
noise level at the party.
In response to a neighbor's com
plaint of excessive noise from the KA
house, two Stanford police officers en
tered the front door of the fraternity to
find 200 people packed closely to
gether in the foyer, in the party room
and at the bar, according to Stanford
Department of Public Safety Sergeant
Richard Tipton. The KA fraternity is on
Lomita Drive on the Stanford campus.
"The concern we had was that the

house was over-crowded and that it
would be unsafe because of the crowd
ing," said Tipton, the night sergeant for
the police department Thursday. "Our
officers found 200 people at the party,
and a crowd of that size might have the
fire marshal worried." The two officers
that attended the party did not contact
the fire marshall because the guests
were able to be dispersed quickly and
orderly, he added.
"The police asked us to quiet down
and observed that we had a lot of
people in the house," said Eric Jacob
sen, president of the KAs. "We decided
to shut the party down, and I asked if
they would hang around and help
move people out so there wouldn't be
any problems. They were very friendly
and the whole thing shut down a little
after 12 o'clock." The party was run
strictly on the Interfraternity council's
guidelines for fraternity parties, Jacob
sen added.
