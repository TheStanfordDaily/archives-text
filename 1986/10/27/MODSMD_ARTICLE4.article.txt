# Stanford reaches out to Japan

### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
Officials of Standford's Center for In
tegrated Systems and a conference of
Silicon Valley professionals were con
nected by photophone with the Tama
River Netweaver's Forum in Japan Sat
urday night, marking the first time
groups from two different countries
were connected in such a manner.
The purpose of this conference, ac
cording to David Wick, an organizer of
the event, was to demonstrate the abil
ity of new technology — slow scan
television combined with on-line com
puters — to join together two groups
of people. Once joined, said Wick,
their purpose was to compare lifestyles
of the people in the Tama Valley in
Japan — the Japanese equivalent of the
Silicon Valley — and the people in the
Silicon Valley.
The technology involved was all
classified as "desktop communica
tions', according to Wick The prin
cipal transmitter was a photophone
that transmits still black and white
images over a regular telephone line
every five to 20 seconds. The
photophone is also augmented with
audio capabilities.
"It (the technology) is a way of
bridging this great distance and bring
ing people together to support under
standing between these two great

cultures," said Wick.
The teleconference, which lasted ap
proximately thre< hours, was organ
ized by Izumi Ai/u of the Institute for
Networking I)e i>i in Japan. Aizu held
responsible foi m.iking the connec
tion in the Tama ki\ \ area, where an
annual regional conference was being
held.
The conference its' II consisted of an
exchange of diaries documenting daily
life in both Japan and the United States.
People began to keep the diaries on
Oct. 1, and some were read over the
photophone while others were
compiled in a computer networking
svstem.

"By exchanging ordinary people's
lives we can certainly see the potential
of the technology, which could serve
to increase understanding," Aizu said.
In addition to the diary readings,
there was also a panel discussion
which served to guide later discussions
of the event, to answer questions, and
to promote intercultural understand
ing.
"It (the teleconference) is a way of
bringing people together in a way they
couldn't before, and that's part of the
exciting thing,'' said Wick
It's going to give us a better per
spective on the people with whom we
need to work in Japan," said panel dis

cussion leader Roger Bunting. "It's
going to make for better human con
nections."
The event was important because of
the amount of data that was exchanged
with Japan over a regular telephone
line. Hopefully, said Wick, this technol
ogy will find corporate support, and
similar conferences might occur more
regularly.
"(We) wanted to increase the num
ber of people who were introduced to
this technology and who could partici
pate. said Margaret Chambers, co
organizer of the event.

Organizer David Wick, along with a number of other engineers gathered in Skilling Auditorium, reached out and
touched someone Saturday night. They collectively placed a call to engineers in the Tama Valley, Japan's equivalent
to Silicon Valley, to demonstrate new photophone technology.
