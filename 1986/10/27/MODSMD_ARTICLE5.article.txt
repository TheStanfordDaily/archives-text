# SAEs plan dry Rush for 1987
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity will
hold an alcohol-free Rush this spring
quarter, becoming the first housed fra
ternity to follow a dry Rush policy at
Stanford, the SAE president announced
last week.
According to senior Neil Angelillo,
president of the SAEs, "There is some
concern that alcohol at other Rush
functions will attract prospective rus
hees, but we want the people who are
interested in the house, not the ones
who just want alcohol," Angelillo said.
The impetus for the decision, made
during a house retreat in Yosemite
before the opening of the quarter,
came from the national chapter, An
gelillo said.
"The National Chapter this year had
asked us to implement a dry Rush into
our policy," Angelillo said. A dry Rush
was written into the house by-laws, he
added.
"There's a negative image for frater
nities, and a lot of it stems from the
Rush process," he said. "I hope it en
courages some other houses at Stan
ford to join us," he said, adding that "It
seems like the sensible thing to do."
"People only see fraternities during
parties, and they don't get to meet
members of a house in a natural envi
ronment," Angelillo said. "(Parties are)
not an accurate picture of our house,
there's been a lot of misunderstanding
because of that," he said.
Joe Pisano, fraternal affairs adviser,
called the SAE's decision "one of the
most encouraging and most interesting
things that any fraternity has done this
year."
With their decision, the SAEs
became the second fraternity on
campus to inititate a dry Rush. The un
housed Sigma Phi Epsilon held a dry
Rush last spring.
"The Sig Eps proved last year they
can have a dry Rush and still have a
successful Rush," said Diana Conklin,
director of the Row and assistant dean
of student affairs.
According to Conklin, Stanford is
one of the few Universities left in the
country that does not mandate a dry
Rush.
"The attitude (of the University) con
tinues to be that students will be re

sponsible for their own decisions ...
but countervailing pressures are
growing for the regulation of alcohol,"
she said.
She called the SAE's decision
"forward-looking and realistic."
Pisano has often advocated a dry
Rush in the past. "This will speak
louder to other fraternity members
than anything I've said," Pisano said.
"Some people say, 'this is so radical,'
but we're behind the rest of the
country. It's a concept whose time has
arrived.
"They deserve a lot of credit for
coming to the decision on their own,"
he said.
According to Angelillo, a committee
has been elected to plan for an
alcohol-free Rush at the SAEs, "to look
at creativity during Rush."
With Rush two quarters away, most
other fraternities haven't gotten a
chance to examine their Rush policy
yet. But several houses said they will
be discussing the possiblity of a dry
Rush.
"It shows great initiative on their
part," said senior Steve Modory, presi
dent of Phi Delta Theta. He added that
the dry Rush is "the direction the Uni
versity has been moving anyway.
"Now that one house has decided to
do it, we'll all be looking at it," Modory
said.
"We haven't developed a policy yet,"
Sigma Chi President Grant Stanley, a
senior, said. "We're definitely consid
ering-it.*'-'-"-- ■ '
According to junior John Donald,
president of Delta Kappa Epsilon,
"There are quite a few people in the
fraternity system who favor a dry
Rush."
"We certainly haven't ruled out a dry
Rush. We will be discussing it. It will be
a possibility," Donald said.
Most members of the Phi Delt frater
nity would probably oppose a dry
Rush, according to Modory. But he said
he favors controls over how much al
cohol is served at Rush parties.
He cited San Diego State's system
where fraternities only receive a cer
tain amount of alcohol from a dis
tributor for the entire Rush period.
"My belief is that there are ways to
control the amount of alcohol
consumed at parties. It's been done at
other schools," he said.
In the wake of a lawsuit filed against
two fraternities over a Rush-related in
cident last spring, the insurance risk of
providing alcohol during Rush is a
prime condideration for fraternities,
said Sig Ep vice-president Michael
Burke, a senior.

providing alcohol during Rush is a
prime condideration for fraternities,
said Sig Ep vice-president Michael
Burke, a senior.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity will
hold an alcohol-free Rush this spring
quarter, becoming the first housed fra
ternity to follow a dry Rush policy at
Stanford, the SAE president announced
last week.
According to senior Neil Angelillo,
president of the SAEs, "There is some
concern that alcohol at other Rush
functions will attract prospective rus
hees, but we want the people who are
interested in the house, not the ones
who just want alcohol," Angelillo said.
The impetus for the decision, made
during a house retreat in Yosemite
before the opening of the quarter,
came from the national chapter, An
gelillo said.
"The National Chapter this year had
asked us to implement a dry Rush into
our policy," Angelillo said. A dry Rush
was written into the house by-laws, he
added.
"There's a negative image for frater
nities, and a lot of it stems from the
Rush process," he said. "I hope it en
courages some other houses at Stan
ford to join us," he said, adding that "It
seems like the sensible thing to do."
"People only see fraternities during
parties, and they don't get to meet
members of a house in a natural envi
ronment," Angelillo said. "(Parties are)
not an accurate picture of our house,
there's been a lot of misunderstanding
because of that," he said.
Joe Pisano, fraternal affairs adviser,
called the SAE's decision "one of the
most encouraging and most interesting
things that any fraternity has done this
year."
With their decision, the SAEs
became the second fraternity on
campus to inititate a dry Rush. The un
housed Sigma Phi Epsilon held a dry
Rush last spring.
"The Sig Eps proved last year they
can have a dry Rush and still have a
successful Rush," said Diana Conklin,
director of the Row and assistant dean
of student affairs.
According to Conklin, Stanford is
one of the few Universities left in the
country that does not mandate a dry
Rush.
"The attitude (of the University) con
tinues to be that students will be re

sponsible for their own decisions ...
but countervailing pressures are
growing for the regulation of alcohol,"
she said.
She called the SAE's decision
"forward-looking and realistic."
Pisano has often advocated a dry
Rush in the past. "This will speak
louder to other fraternity members
than anything I've said," Pisano said.
"Some people say, 'this is so radical,'
but we're behind the rest of the
country. It's a concept whose time has
arrived.
"They deserve a lot of credit for
coming to the decision on their own,"
he said.
According to Angelillo, a committee
has been elected to plan for an
alcohol-free Rush at the SAEs, "to look
at creativity during Rush."
With Rush two quarters away, most
other fraternities haven't gotten a
chance to examine their Rush policy
yet. But several houses said they will
be discussing the possiblity of a dry
Rush.
"It shows great initiative on their
part," said senior Steve Modory, presi
dent of Phi Delta Theta. He added that
the dry Rush is "the direction the Uni
versity has been moving anyway.
"Now that one house has decided to
do it, we'll all be looking at it," Modory
said.
"We haven't developed a policy yet,"
Sigma Chi President Grant Stanley, a
senior, said. "We're definitely consid
ering-it.*'-'-"-- ■ '
According to junior John Donald,
president of Delta Kappa Epsilon,
"There are quite a few people in the
fraternity system who favor a dry
Rush."
"We certainly haven't ruled out a dry
Rush. We will be discussing it. It will be
a possibility," Donald said.
Most members of the Phi Delt frater
nity would probably oppose a dry
Rush, according to Modory. But he said
he favors controls over how much al
cohol is served at Rush parties.
He cited San Diego State's system
where fraternities only receive a cer
tain amount of alcohol from a dis
tributor for the entire Rush period.
"My belief is that there are ways to
control the amount of alcohol
consumed at parties. It's been done at
other schools," he said.
In the wake of a lawsuit filed against
two fraternities over a Rush-related in
cident last spring, the insurance risk of
providing alcohol during Rush is a
prime condideration for fraternities,
said Sig Ep vice-president Michael
Burke, a senior.
