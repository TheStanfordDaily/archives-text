# Grads' taxes up under new plan

The Tax Reform Act of 1986, recently
passed in Congress, will adversely af
fect students' efforts to earn graduate
degrees, according to graduate stu
dents.
Starting Jan. 1, 1987, the Internal
Revenue Service will tax the stipends
of graduate students with fellowships
"less course related expenses" and the
stipends of research and teaching assis
tants. The reform act will also tax tui
tion reductions after a projected base
level of $5,250.
Elizabeth Traugott, dean of Graduate
Studies, said the act will make graduate
students pay taxes just like any other
service provider in this country. "The
more money you earn, the higher
you're taxed,'' she said.
The tax reform will most deeply af
fect science and engineering graduate
students, since the majority of financial
aid in those schools is based on re
search assistantships and teaching as
sistantships, Traugott said.
Graduate students expressed frustra
tion over the new tax laws, citing its
regressive nature.
According to Jason Daida, a graduate
in electrical engineering, "It's not as if
we have gobs of money ... everything
covers expenses." He added that stu
dents supporting small families would
probably suffer the most from the new
taxes.
"It's almost like drawing blood from
a turnip ... the taxes will seriously cut
into housing and food," said Kevin
Holland, an industrial engineering stu
dent and a Resident Assistant at Croth

ers Memorial Hall. "Many graduate stu
dents can't even afford to blow $25 on
a Saturday night," he added.
Amy Phillips, a humanities and
sciences graduate and a resident assis
tant at Crothers, fears that the tax in
crease will lead to a "brain drain" away
from the University. Students already
can't afford the costs of graduate edu
cation and now they may decide to go
somewhere else, she said.
Phillips added that doctoral candi
dates who attend the University with
out fellowships for an indeterminate
number of years, would suffer more
from the taxes than masters candidates
who need only one or two years to
complete their programs.
University Provost James Rosse,
however, said the new tax reform law
will "have an effect, but it won't change
the fundamental character of graduate
education."
Noting that Stanford pays stipends of
at least comparable worth to other in
stitutions, Traugott said "I really doubt
very seriously that the amount of finan
cial aid for teaching assistants and re
search assistants will make them
(graduate candidates) change institu
tions." Traugott noted that the Univer
sity sets up new tuition and stipend
rates each September for the academic
year.
Commenting on the new laws, Rosse
said "we probably won't be able to al
leviate the entire burden, but we'll do
the best we can." He added that it was
premature to talk about the Univer
sity's response, since he estimated that
the tax won't significantly affect stu
dents until the 1987-88 academic year.
Traugott also said the University will
not undertake immediate action. " We
don't want to make any changes until
the IRS has firmly set down its regula
tions," she said.
Virtually all the Stanford graduate
fellowship awards for 1986-87 were
made before the Aug. 16, 1986
deadline and therefore the stipends for
the Winter and Spring Quarter will
probably not be subject to tax, Traugott
said in a statement to the Stanford
community. The tax on tuition reduc
tions will probably not hit any students
except those in the medical school,
and they will be only marginally af
fected, she added.

To students interviewed, the bottom
line was clear â€” they will need more
aid.
"If students have to pay taxes, they
will need more support," said David
Spangler, an aeronautical and
astronautical engineering student
In giving advice to graduate stu
dents, Traugott offered three sugges
tions. First, students should try to un
derstand why they are being taxed. Tax
reform is so popular these days be
cause everybody has to share the bur
den, she said.
Second, students should go to the
Controllers Office and find out about
their own particular situation, and fi
nally they can lobby at the federal
level.
The American Association of Univer
sities, the Association of Graduate
Schools and the Council of Graduate
Schools are among the many organiza

tions trying to change the attitude of
congressman toward student
stipends, Traugott said. The univer
sities and graduate schools consider
teaching a part of the graduate's train
ing. Stanford students are not perform
ing a taxable service, she said.
If students want to get involved, they
can approach the issue at the state level
as well, Traugott said. At the moment,
state law doesn't require these new
taxes, but it can conform to the exam
ple of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 at
any time.
The taxation of foreign students is
one issue that is still up in the air,
Traugott said. Foreign TAs and RAs fol
low the tax treaties of their own
countries. Since some tax treaties do
not permit U.S. taxes to be levied on
visiting students, many foreign stu
dents still might not have to pay any
taxes, she said.
