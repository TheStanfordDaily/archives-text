# Grads' taxes up under new plan

The Tax Reform Act of 1986, recently
passed in Congress, will adversely af
fect students' efforts to earn graduate
degrees, according to graduate stu
dents.
Starting Jan. 1, 1987, the Internal
Revenue Service will tax the stipends
of graduate students with fellowships
"less course related expenses" and the
stipends of research and teaching assis
tants. The reform act will also tax tui
tion reductions after a projected base
level of $5,250.
Elizabeth Traugott, dean of Graduate
Studies, said the act will make graduate
students pay taxes just like any other
service provider in this country. "The
more money you earn, the higher
you're taxed,'' she said.
The tax reform will most deeply af
fect science and engineering graduate
students, since the majority of financial
aid in those schools is based on re
search assistantships and teaching as
sistantships, Traugott said.
Graduate students expressed frustra
tion over the new tax laws, citing its
regressive nature.
According to Jason Daida, a graduate
in electrical engineering, "It's not as if
we have gobs of money ... everything
covers expenses." He added that stu
dents supporting small families would
probably suffer the most from the new
taxes.
"It's almost like drawing blood from
a turnip ... the taxes will seriously cut
into housing and food," said Kevin
Holland, an industrial engineering stu
dent and a Resident Assistant at Croth

ers Memorial Hall. "Many graduate stu
dents can't even afford to blow $25 on
a Saturday night," he added.
Amy Phillips, a humanities and
sciences graduate and a resident assis
tant at Crothers, fears that the tax in
crease will lead to a "brain drain" away
from the University. Students already
can't afford the costs of graduate edu
cation and now they may decide to go
somewhere else, she said.
Phillips added that doctoral candi
dates who attend the University with
out fellowships for an indeterminate
number of years, would suffer more
from the taxes than masters candidates
who need only one or two years to
complete their programs.
University Provost James Rosse,
however, said the new tax reform law
will "have an effect, but it won't change
the fundamental character of graduate
education."
Noting that Stanford pays stipends of
at least comparable worth to other in
stitutions, Traugott said "I really doubt
very seriously that the amount of finan
cial aid for teaching assistants and re
search assistants will make them
(graduate candidates) change institu
tions." Traugott noted that the Univer
sity sets up new tuition and stipend
rates each September for the academic
year.
Commenting on the new laws, Rosse
said "we probably won't be able to al
leviate the entire burden, but we'll do
the best we can." He added that it was
premature to talk about the Univer
sity's response, since he estimated that
the tax won't significantly affect stu
