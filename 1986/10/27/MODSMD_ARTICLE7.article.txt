Britain: Syrians planted bomb
LONDON — A newspaper reported yesterday that an undercover Syrian
agent worked as a clerk for 20 years in the British Embassy in Damascus
and tricked a diplomat there into signing a visa for Nezar Hindawi.
Hindawi was convicted Friday of planting a bomb in luggage his
girlfriend tried to bring aboard an Israeli airliner April 17 at Heathrow air
port. Britain accused Syria's government of aiding him and broke
diplomatic relatioas.
Police armed with machine guns remained on alert at Heathrow yester
day for possible terrorist reprisals.
There were these other developments yesterday:
• Syria's state minister for foreign affairs, Isam Al-Naeb, briefed Western
European ambassadors in Damascus about Syria's relationship with Britain.
Diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were
given "official answers to all the points raised Friday before the House Of
, Gammons" by British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe.
• In Tel Aviv, an Israeli expert on Syria said Hindawi was under orders
from Syrian air force intelligence chief Gen. Mohammed el-Khouli to blow
up the Israeli El Al plane. El-Khouli reports to Syrian President Hafez Assad.
• Algeria's official APS news agency expressed "complete solidarity" with
Syria, and a Kuwaiti Cabinet minister said his government regretted Brit
ain's break in relations with Syria. Neither country announced measures
against Britain.
The United States, Canada and Israel have applauded Britain's break with
Syria.
Conference excludes S. Africa
GENEVA — Third World and Soviet bloc countries joined Saturday in
ousting the South African government delegation from an International
Red Cross conference, outpolling Western representatives who said the
move threatened the organization's neutrality.
After the vote, 18 Western delegations proposed the conference adjourn
indefinitely. Australian Red Cross President Grahame Taylor, presenting
the motion, said emotions were too high for serious consideration of regu
lar conference business.
But the motion failed. The vote, by secret ballot, was 178-52 with five
abstentions.
In Johannesburg, the South African Broadcasting Corp. said late Saturday
the government had told all International Red Cross personnel to leave the
country as soon as possible. It cited the ouster of the South African
delegates in Geneva and quoted Foreign Minister R.F. Botha as saying that
action was illegal.
The radio said the government had suspended Red Cross representation
in South Africa until it is again allowed to participate in the Geneva confer
ence. The International Red Cross has 15 Swiss nationals in Pretoria and in
Windhoek, South-West Africa, which South Africa administers.
Researchers to redefine AIDS
LOS ANGELES — Researchers say the current definition of AIDS misses
many people with the disease, so they are studying changes in reporting
criteria that may boost the total 14 percent.
Dr. Timothy Dondero of the federal Centers for Disease Control in At
lanta says the proposed changes would add "patients who almost certainly
have AIDS but do not meet the fairly rigorous case definition now re
quired."
As of Oct. 20, there had been 26,566 official cases of acquired immune
defiency syndrome in the United States, and 14,977 of them, or 56 percent,
were fatal. The additional 14 percent, a figure suggested by two New York
doctors, would bring the total to nearly 30,000.
The problem with defining AIDS is that different patients come down
with different illnesses once their immune system is attacked by the virus,
Dr. Sheldon Landesman, head of the AIDS team at State University of New
York-Brooklyn Downstate Medical Center, said in an interview published
yesterday by the Los Angeles Herald Examiner.
Blood tests may show a person has AIDS antibodies, but the victim may
come down with any of hundreds of various ills.
Landesman and Brooklyn colleague Dr. Eugene Straus estimated new
reporting criteria would boost the total number of cases 14 percent.
Current criteria don't include such important AIDS-related symptoms as
irreversible dementia, central nervous system diseases that only recently
were found to be early manifestations of the disease, or other conditions
lumped into the category of ARC (AIDS-related complex), which some doc
tors say lead to AIDS.
Gas prices continue downward
LOS ANGELES — Gasoline prices continued their seasonal downward
crawl, dipping nearly a cent per gallon in the past two weeks, an industry
analyst said yesterday.
But the traditional price drop after the peak summer driving season
could be foiled as dealers struggle with a discrepancy between their retail
and wholesale prices, Trilby Lundberg said.
"Retail drops may slow, and consumers could find prices stabilizing na
tionally throughout the winter holidays," she said.
The average retail price for all grades of gasoline on Oct. 24 was 8473
cents per gallon, including tax. That was down 0.86 of a cent per gallon
from two weeks earlier, according to the Lundberg Survey of 15,000 outlets
nationwide.
Mexican bank aid underway
SAN FRANCISCO — International banking officials said yesterday they ex
pected Mexico's creditor banks to commit to $6 billion in new loans within
days of the Oct. 31 deadline set by the International Monetary Fund.
Officials from regulatory and lending agencies held a closed meeting
with about 150 U.S. bankers to discuss their participation in the new financ
ing, which is part of a $12 billion rescue package assembled by the IMF for
the Mexican economy.
The bankers were among the more than 10,000 attending the American
Bankers Association annual convention.
The bank loans would complement $6 billion in new aid from the IMF,
the World Bank and other international agencies and industrialized na
tions.
Since an agreement in principle over the bank loans was reached Sept.
30 with a committee representing Mexico's roughly 450 creditor banks,
Mexican and international finance officials and bank committee members
have been meeting with creditor banks around the world to secure ap
proval of the package.
Thai plane plunges 25,000 feet
TOKYO — A Thai Airways A-300 Airbus with 247 people aboard plunged
almost 25,000 feet last night after suddenly losing cabin pressure over
southwestern Japan, and 62 people were injured before the aircraft landed
safely at Osaka Airport, authorities said.
Of the wounded, 14 people were hospitalized with serious injuries and
one was in critical condition, Osaka police said this morning. Police earlier
reported that 63 people had been injured during the 40-minute ordeal.
Japanese news reports said Flight 620, en route to Osaka from Bangkok,
made the emergency' dive following what passengers described as a "big
bang." Passengers said a white mist poured into the cabin throughout the
descent.
A preliminary- investigation revealed half the rear pressure wall, which
separates the pressurized cabin from the non-pressurized tail section, was
severely damaged, Osaka Prefectural Police spokesman Masayuki
Mivaguchi said.
Investigators also found a hole one yard in diameter on the rear bottom
outside the jetliner.

Thai plane plunges 25,000 feet
TOKYO — A Thai Airways A-300 Airbus with 247 people aboard plunged
almost 25,000 feet last night after suddenly losing cabin pressure over
southwestern Japan, and 62 people were injured before the aircraft landed
safely at Osaka Airport, authorities said.
Of the wounded, 14 people were hospitalized with serious injuries and
one was in critical condition, Osaka police said this morning. Police earlier
reported that 63 people had been injured during the 40-minute ordeal.
Japanese news reports said Flight 620, en route to Osaka from Bangkok,
made the emergency' dive following what passengers described as a "big
bang." Passengers said a white mist poured into the cabin throughout the
descent.
A preliminary- investigation revealed half the rear pressure wall, which
separates the pressurized cabin from the non-pressurized tail section, was
severely damaged, Osaka Prefectural Police spokesman Masayuki
Mivaguchi said.
Investigators also found a hole one yard in diameter on the rear bottom
outside the jetliner.

Britain: Syrians planted bomb
LONDON — A newspaper reported yesterday that an undercover Syrian
agent worked as a clerk for 20 years in the British Embassy in Damascus
and tricked a diplomat there into signing a visa for Nezar Hindawi.
Hindawi was convicted Friday of planting a bomb in luggage his
girlfriend tried to bring aboard an Israeli airliner April 17 at Heathrow air
port. Britain accused Syria's government of aiding him and broke
diplomatic relatioas.
Police armed with machine guns remained on alert at Heathrow yester
day for possible terrorist reprisals.
There were these other developments yesterday:
• Syria's state minister for foreign affairs, Isam Al-Naeb, briefed Western
European ambassadors in Damascus about Syria's relationship with Britain.
Diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were
given "official answers to all the points raised Friday before the House Of
, Gammons" by British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe.
• In Tel Aviv, an Israeli expert on Syria said Hindawi was under orders
from Syrian air force intelligence chief Gen. Mohammed el-Khouli to blow
up the Israeli El Al plane. El-Khouli reports to Syrian President Hafez Assad.
• Algeria's official APS news agency expressed "complete solidarity" with
Syria, and a Kuwaiti Cabinet minister said his government regretted Brit
ain's break in relations with Syria. Neither country announced measures
against Britain.
The United States, Canada and Israel have applauded Britain's break with
Syria.
Conference excludes S. Africa
GENEVA — Third World and Soviet bloc countries joined Saturday in
ousting the South African government delegation from an International
Red Cross conference, outpolling Western representatives who said the
move threatened the organization's neutrality.
After the vote, 18 Western delegations proposed the conference adjourn
indefinitely. Australian Red Cross President Grahame Taylor, presenting
the motion, said emotions were too high for serious consideration of regu
lar conference business.
But the motion failed. The vote, by secret ballot, was 178-52 with five
abstentions.
In Johannesburg, the South African Broadcasting Corp. said late Saturday
the government had told all International Red Cross personnel to leave the
country as soon as possible. It cited the ouster of the South African
delegates in Geneva and quoted Foreign Minister R.F. Botha as saying that
action was illegal.
The radio said the government had suspended Red Cross representation
in South Africa until it is again allowed to participate in the Geneva confer
ence. The International Red Cross has 15 Swiss nationals in Pretoria and in
Windhoek, South-West Africa, which South Africa administers.
Researchers to redefine AIDS
LOS ANGELES — Researchers say the current definition of AIDS misses
many people with the disease, so they are studying changes in reporting
criteria that may boost the total 14 percent.
Dr. Timothy Dondero of the federal Centers for Disease Control in At
lanta says the proposed changes would add "patients who almost certainly
have AIDS but do not meet the fairly rigorous case definition now re
quired."
As of Oct. 20, there had been 26,566 official cases of acquired immune
defiency syndrome in the United States, and 14,977 of them, or 56 percent,
were fatal. The additional 14 percent, a figure suggested by two New York
doctors, would bring the total to nearly 30,000.
The problem with defining AIDS is that different patients come down
with different illnesses once their immune system is attacked by the virus,
Dr. Sheldon Landesman, head of the AIDS team at State University of New
York-Brooklyn Downstate Medical Center, said in an interview published
yesterday by the Los Angeles Herald Examiner.
Blood tests may show a person has AIDS antibodies, but the victim may
come down with any of hundreds of various ills.
Landesman and Brooklyn colleague Dr. Eugene Straus estimated new
reporting criteria would boost the total number of cases 14 percent.
Current criteria don't include such important AIDS-related symptoms as
irreversible dementia, central nervous system diseases that only recently
were found to be early manifestations of the disease, or other conditions
lumped into the category of ARC (AIDS-related complex), which some doc
tors say lead to AIDS.
Gas prices continue downward
LOS ANGELES — Gasoline prices continued their seasonal downward
crawl, dipping nearly a cent per gallon in the past two weeks, an industry
analyst said yesterday.
But the traditional price drop after the peak summer driving season
could be foiled as dealers struggle with a discrepancy between their retail
and wholesale prices, Trilby Lundberg said.
"Retail drops may slow, and consumers could find prices stabilizing na
tionally throughout the winter holidays," she said.
The average retail price for all grades of gasoline on Oct. 24 was 8473
cents per gallon, including tax. That was down 0.86 of a cent per gallon
from two weeks earlier, according to the Lundberg Survey of 15,000 outlets
nationwide.
Mexican bank aid underway
SAN FRANCISCO — International banking officials said yesterday they ex
pected Mexico's creditor banks to commit to $6 billion in new loans within
days of the Oct. 31 deadline set by the International Monetary Fund.
Officials from regulatory and lending agencies held a closed meeting
with about 150 U.S. bankers to discuss their participation in the new financ
ing, which is part of a $12 billion rescue package assembled by the IMF for
the Mexican economy.
The bankers were among the more than 10,000 attending the American
Bankers Association annual convention.
The bank loans would complement $6 billion in new aid from the IMF,
the World Bank and other international agencies and industrialized na
tions.
