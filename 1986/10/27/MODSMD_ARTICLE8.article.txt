# Hasenfus talks to U.S. press
## Details the downing of American plane and his role 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Americans took over
supply drops to contra rebels in Nicaragua because
rebel planes and pilots weren't doing the job prop
erly, Eugene Hasenfus said Saturday.
"Let's just say our flights hit the target," said
Hasenfus, the former Marine from Marinette, Wis.
He is currently facing terrorism charges in
Nicaragua for his role in an Oct. 5 flight of a cargo
plane shot down by Sandinista troops while carrying
weapons to the U.S.-backed rebels.
The plane crash in southern Nicaragua killed two
American pilots and a still unidentified man.
In an interview with The Associated Press,
Hasenfus said about 14 Americans worked on the
contra support flights out of El Salvador's llopango
military airport.
The interview, one of a series Hasenfus has had
with American reporters, was held in a small office in
a prison outside Managua. Three Sandinista officials
was present, and one of them taped the interview.
Hasenfus, who appeared somewhat relaxed, said

the cargo plane was flying at 3,000 feet and was
within three minutes of the drop zone when it was
hit. Sandinista officials said the plane was struck by a
shoulder held surface-to-air missile.
"It was like someone hit the outside of the aircraft
with a baseball bat," said Hasenfus.
"The explosion must have hit on the outboard ex
haust port to the engine ... (It) blew most of the
wing 0ff.... I heard someone say, 'What?' That's all I
ever heard over the intercom. I looked and saw noth
ing but flames coming up out of the right side. The
whole thing was engulfed.
"I barely had time to get out myself.... I was fall
ing at the same speed as the aircraft. When I was clear
of everything, I popped my parachute and let the
aircraft go away from me."
Hasenfus, who was responsible for dropping the
supplies from the plane, parachuted to safety, but
was captured a day later by Nicaraguan soldiers. He
said then that he believed he had been working on a
coven CIA operation.

The Reagan administration denied any role in the
ill-fated flight although it now has resumed $100 mil
lion in military aid to the contras in their war against
the leftist Nicaraguan government.
Such coven administration aid would have been il
legal.
Congressional investigations into the Hasenfus in
cident and alleged U.S. government involvement are
expected to begin when the 100 th Congress con
venes after elections.
Hasenfus said the American-manned air fleet con
sisted of five planes: two DCH4 "Caribou" cargo
planes, two Cl23s and one light passenger plane. He
said the planes used Ilopango to load supplies and
then flew missions to contra base camps in Honduras
and to rebel units operating inside Nicaragua.
Some Caribou flights over Nicaragua required lan
dings in Costa Rica for refueling, he said.
He did not comment on his trial or on his chances
to be released from Nicaragua soon.
