### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan,
offering to "keep the good times roll
ing" for the American economy,
warned voters Saturday In advance of
the mid-term elections that Democrats
could bring back "the economic mess"
of the Carter administration.
A former Carter official, however,
accused Reagan of leaving behind
America's working men and women as
some sectors of the economy moved
ahead. Robert Strauss, former chair
man of the Democratic National Com
mittee, said the nation needs a tough,
new trade policy to pull its manufac
turers out of a slump.
The president, in his Saturday radio
address from the Oval Office, contin
ued his attack against former President
Jimmy Carter as he attempted to court
voters for the GOP.
Citing the annual 2.4 percent growth
rate for the third quarter, Reagan
boasted that the economy "is solid and
accelerating again" and that the cur
rent economic expansion "will be re
corded as one of the most remarkable
peacetime expansions in the 20th Cen
tury."
The president promised even better
times if his supporters remain in Wash
ington.
"We're going to keep the good times
rolling until they extend to every cor
ner of the economy," the president
said.
Private economists have expressed

fears that unless consumer spending
strengtheas and the nation's massive
trade deficit improves, the economy
could weaken and head for a recession
next year.
Reagan, while acknowledging some
problems, rejected criticism.
"Sure, there are ups and downs, and
some sectors of the economy are not
yet sharing in the expansion," he said.
"The indications are that the economy
is gathering momentum for even more
growth, more job creation, a narrow
ing trade deficit and continued low in
flation in the months ahead."
In the Democratic response, Strauss
accused the Reagan administration of
failing to allow free and open trade,
hurting farmers and workers in the
textile, auto and steel industries.
"Ronald Reagan has made us feel
good about ourselves and America, but
he hasn't stood up for America's
working men and women, our farmers
and our industries, as they try to export
our products around the world,"
Strauss said in broadcast remarks.
With Election Day only two weeks
away, the bipartisan unity that charac
terized such recent congressional is
sues as the war on drugs, sanctions
against South Africa and support for
Reagan at the Iceland Summit, has al
most disappeared as Republicans and
Democrats alike retreat to their
respective camps.
