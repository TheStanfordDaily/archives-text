## A 						Modest Proposal 
### 
Now is the lime for Stanford University to net out of
the Pac-10.
The need for the Big Flight, as the move will someday
be called, does not arise from the recent performance of
Stanford s football team. On the contrary, the team has
gotten better and better over the last few years and has
proven this season that it is one of the Pac-10's finest.
Rather, the Big Flight is mandated by what Stanford
sociology professors have already termed the Big At
titudinal Shift.
To understand the Big Attitudinal Shift, one need only
study the writings of Stanford's head football coach, Jack
Elway. The following excerpt is taken from a column by
Elway that appeared in the Times Tribune a couple
weeks ago.
"(Our) team has a chip on its shoulder. As Stanford
students, they do not fit into the stereotype. They have
reached Stanford's high standard of academic excellence
while competing at the highest level. As I have told them,
they are special because they haven't taken any short cuts
to get where they are.
Not many players in the Pac-10 can say that. A lot of
athletes were not recruited by us for obvious reasons.
There are others who were recruited, but were not ac
cepted. Young athletes do not easily forget and, conse
quendy, that is why teams always look forward to playing
us."
The Stanford Band echoed Elway's Stanford jingoism
at halftime Saturday with a show that made fun of USC
students for having "no brains."
Clearly, we are too bright for the rest of the league. We
know it, they know it. This is the essence of the Big At
titudinal Shift.
My fear is that Stanford will continue to play up its in
tellectual superiority, eventually forcing all Pac-10 Sports
Information directors to release SAT scores and aca
demic files with team rosters. Stanford could print
players' comparative grade-point averages, even an
nounce starters' academic statistics before each game.

After a big loss we might say, "Well, Don, at least three of
our boys are going to Yale Law School." The list of
dangers is endless.
Fortunately, I have a solution.
The time has come for Stanford to join the Ivy League.
Granted, the team bus rides to Providence and New
Haven will be a pain.
Granted, students here will have to buy Duckies and
pea coats and lose their tans to fit in.
Granted, Stanford students will probably get bad ideas
about creating secret societies.
Consider, though, the positive aspects of joining the
Ivy League.
First, students at the eight Ivies are said to be much
brighter than most Pac-10 students. Thus, Stanford would
no longer have any great academic mismatches in the
conference.
Second, the move would dissolve the Ivy envy that
pervades our campus. We would be an official Ivy League
school.
Third, the Stanford football team would dominate the
conference.
Fourth, if we ever fell behind another team, our fans
would have no basis to chant, "That's all right, that's OK,
you're gonna work for us someday."
Fifth, the Stanford Band would be right at home with
the wacky, no-holds-barred, drop-trou-on-national-TV
bands of the Ivies.
Furthermore, the Band would have little difficulty fin
ding new targets to replace the trite Tommy Trojan. I can
already see Band shows on Brown's prostitution ring,
Benno Schmidt's illustrious acting career, Nadav Safran's
secret sources of funding and Dartmouth students' per
manent state of inebriation.
We should bring Cal with us to the Ivy League, too. By
doing this we would still have a traditional conference
rival, and we would still have Big Game.
And who knows, Cal's addition to the league might be
Columbia's only hope of ending its record losing streak.
