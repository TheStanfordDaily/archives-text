At its first competition of the year,
Stanford's fledging debate team took
first place in two categories at last
weekend's Berkeley Invitational
Tournament.
Junior Mark Lemley and sophomore
Steve Jurvetson, competing in the
senior division of debate, faced Van
derbilt in the final round and won by a
2-1 decision from the three judges.
Freshman John Lin took first place in
extemporaneous speaking, winning
over five competitors in the final
round.
In extemporaneous speaking, the
competitor is allowed to choose one of
three topics and is given 30 minutes to
prepare a seven-minute oral presenta
tion. No written notes may be used.
There are four rounds of competition,
with a different set of topics for each
round. Lin's final topic was the role of
organized crime in the recent crack
epidemic.
In debate competition, two pairs
debate opposite sides of a pre selected
issue, or resolution. There is a differ
ent resolution each semester, and this
semester's resolution, according to
Lemley, is "Resolve that improved rela
tions with the Soviet Union are a more
important objective for the United
States than improved military
preparedness."
Teams must debate both sides of the
resolution.
