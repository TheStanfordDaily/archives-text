All diplomacy involves some degree of pettiness, and
relations between the United States and the Soviet Union
are certainly no exception. Last week, however, this tit
for-tat diplomacy reached a new low.
Figuring out who was ousted when is harder than
tracking down free agents the morning after the Major
League baseball trading deadline. Indeed, perhaps
newspapers should start a "Diplomatic Relations" page
and include a United States/Soviet Union transaction
update as a daily feature.
But international diplomacy is serious business, and it
can lead to real progress — as the meeting in Reykjavik
two weeks ago showed. It is always discouraging when
two world leaders come so close to making a historic
agreement and then proceed to engage in a game of silly
diplomatic intrigue.
The whole affair really began last March when
Congress set a limit on the number of Soviet diplomats
allowed in the United States. More than 100 representa
tives of Moscow were to return to the Soviet Union
during a two-year period to bring the number of Soviet

diplomats more in line with that of their Americans
counterparts in the Soviet Union. However, both sides
are guilty of escalating this relatively routine reduction in
the diplomatic corps into the dangerous diplomatic one
upmaaship of the past few weeks.
The most obnoxious episode of this international
melodrama ocurred late last week. The Kremlin
withdrew all 260 Soviet employees of the U.S. Embassy
in Moscow, severely damaging many important and use
ful Soviet contacts. According to members of the U.S.
foreign service who have served in Moscow, the Soviet
workers in the embassy there were important in main
taining contacts with a wide range of Soviets, from pro
fessors to Jews who want to emigrate. This Soviet action
may well have implications into the next decade.
Especially today, the potential exists for a sweeping
arms agreement — if the United States and the Soviet
Union will bargain in good faith. It's time the two
countries stopped acting like irrational adolescents. Too
much is at stake for the two nations to engage in such
foolishness.
