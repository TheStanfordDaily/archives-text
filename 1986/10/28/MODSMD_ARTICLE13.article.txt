# Spooking it up at the Gates of Hell
## 
### 
There was a note on my door from my Irish-Chinese
housemate when I returned from a long dinner and
gossip at Chili's with Twin. It said, "Bee says, mid
night at the Gates of Hell. Dress in black." In paren
theses the Irish-Chinese housemate had added, "(the
Rodin sculpture garden)." It was lucky he had done
so or I might have thought Bee was talking about a
new club or party. Bee talks about those things a lot.
For those of you who still don't understand the refer
ence, the Gates of Hell is the title (I know that sounds
grammatically incorrect but trust me; I'm an English
major) of a major sculpture by Auguste Rodin, a copy
of which sits in an outdoor sculpture garden near the
Stanford museum. Twin and I were both suffering
from the combined effect of too much of margaritas
and of gossip — guilt plus gluttony — but we
decided to go anyway. Dressing in black at midnight
at the Gates of Hell was too great an opportunity to
let slip by. We went.

We did know better than to expect anything ter
ribly exciting. It was early in the quarter so we were
looking forward to seeing people for the first time
after the summer and to feeling cool en masse. Get to
the point, you say, and when does the Invisible Girl
show up? The Invisible Girl doesn't show up, we
resist the temptation to write that she never does.
(I.G. was out with Armand I think. He is so touchingly
devoted, and so tangible about it.) I am merely trying
to emphasize that this was but a modest little gather
ing, in conception at least. Six or seven people were
having a little picnic, a little non-alcoholic sherry
hour at the sculpture garden after Meyer closed.
True, we were all dressed in black, and Catrine had
put Factrix in a portable tape player for atmosphere,
and Bee had spread a Conga over one of the little
stone tables, as a tablecloth and again for atmos
phere, and we did have candles burning in odd
places — but I'm getting ahead of myself.
Twin and I got out of the car. Two figures dressed
in graveyard black approached us, carrying votive
candles and glasses of a very red liquid. Welcome,
they said. It seemed fairly important to refrain from
smiling. We followed Bee and Catrine to the Gates of
Hell sculpture and the table holding the veggies,
around which lurked Joyce and Aurora. On the way I
tasted the red liquid. It's sweet, I whispered to Twin,
who was eyeing it a little doubtfully. Hawaiian Punch,
said Bee. I admired Joyce's veil, she adored my black

hat, and black lipstick really suited Aurora. After these
preliminaries, Bee told us that we were being
watched. I could clearly see three figures huddling
together, about a hundred yards away. Three fresh
men, said Bee. They are keeping journals for Fresh
man English. They asked us, "What are you? Doing?"
So, in fact, it turned out that "what we were doing"
was giving the freshmen something to write about.
With an audience present, the six of us became very
creative. We chanted nonsense responsively, with
Bee intoning "Jambo Sana" at odd intervals. (Bee had
spent his summer in Kenya.) We made obeisances at
the Gates of Hell. We led a procession around the
sculpture garden, making signs in the air with fingers
dipped in Hawaiian Punch. But mostly, we laughed a
lot. It seemed very amusing how gullible the fresh
men were and how easy to freak out. Catrine said,
"Shall we go up to them and ask them, 'are you a vir
gin?
'Has your blood ever been polluted? Have you
ever had malaria?'"
"We should make a form for potential sacrificial
victims," said Aurora.
"I could make one on my Mac and we could leave
them around at odd places on campus," said Joyce.
"How Stanford is that. Form an underground cult
and whip up the papers on the Mac," said Aurora.
We could tell them we are the Stanford Satanic So
ciety. Tri Sig. Sss. This concept of the underground
fraternity party pleased me because of the absolute
innocuousness of what we were really doing —
eating fresh vegetables and drinking Hawaiian
Punch. As Catrine shrilly chanted Latin at the Gates of
Hell, Bee and I walked slowly up to one of the fresh
men, keeping our expressions blank. "Hawaiian
Punch?" said Bee, holding out the glass. The fresh
man shook his head. Not long after this our audience
disappeared. "I guess they have enough to write
about," said Aurora.
At about that point the police arrived. They said they
had had a report of suspicious persons.
They took our ID ("What are you, house mother?"

he asked me, on noticing my age) and asked us what
we were doing. We explained about the freshmen,
and to be fair to the police, they laughed. But they
still put on our Factrix tape and asked us what it was.
"It's a band," said Catrine. They tested all our food
and took a picture of our little table. Finally they told
us we needed a permit to hold a function. "Six
people is a function?" we said. Apparently. And since
it was 1 a.m. we were happy to leave when they told
us to. Aurora went running up to one of the
policemen saying, "Can we have a copy of the
picture, or the report?" He said not to worry. "We just
want a souvenir," said Joyce. "We're not worried."
The policeman shook his head. "I expected to see a
goat being slaughtered any minute," he said.
People are awfully easy to freak out, aren't they?
Especially when they have to deal with something
unfamiliar. What are those people dressed in black?
What is this weird noise they've got on their tape
player? Why do they look like that? Why don't they
look like us? Why do they like doing weird things?
There must be something wrong wiih them. This is
not the American Way. Very suspicious. Let's call the
police.
Fortunately, it's not yet a law in this country' to be
different or even merely to appear so. Halloween is
coming up. It's cool to be different on Halloween.
GLAS has a party that a lot of people suddenly find
cool to attend. The Castro becomes the coolest area
in town. On Halloween you can't make any assump
tions about people because of the way they look, it's
impossible. Aren't easy assumptions always so? Mini
stry has a song called "Every Day is Halloween"
which says, "Why can't they see they're just like me,
it's the same, it's die same in the whole wide world/'
Jf those freshman hadn't been so scared they might
have been enjoying the joke with us.
Happy Halloween from all of us at Tri Sig. Ssssssss.
Don't freak out.
