# The
						cost of U.S. war in Nicaragua

Since the downing of an American
cargo plane in Nicaragua on Oct. 5,
revelations have poured out concern
ing the secret network that has acted as
a U.S. government surrogate in provid
ing aid to Nicaraguan rebels. When
Congress voted in 1984 to bar all U.S.
funding for military operations in

R. MARSHALL

Nicaragua, Reagan administration offi
cials simply turned elsewhere for help.
The result was the creation of a com
plex weh of groups and individuals
that includes retired generals, Texas
millionaires, Maryland arms dealers,
right-wing Cubans, CIA Director
William Casey, Vice President George
Bush, the Salvadoran military and even
the government of Saudi Arabia.
The terrorist nature of the undertak
ing is indicated by the fact that one of
its major operatives, Ramon Medina,
escaped from a Venezuelan prison in
198*> after being charged with bomb
ing a Cuban airliner that went down
with 73 passengers. The clandestine
financing arrangements are typified by
the Reagan administration's agreement
with Saudi Arabia that the Saudis
would contribute to U.S.-backed rebels
in Nicaragua if the United States agreed
to sell the Saudis AWACs intelligence
planes. According to the New York
Times (Oct. 22), this deal "made it pos
sible to circumvent Congressional re

strictions on covert aid to Central
America and also to provide an almost
impenetrable method of providing
funds, enhancing the administration's
ability to plausibly deny any involve
ment."
Since taking office, President Reagan
has been determined to overthrow the
Sandinista government in Nicaragua,
calling it "a mortal threat to the entire
world." Bush refers to Nicaragua as "a
totalitarian dungeon," and Secretary of
State George Shultz has accused the
Nicaraguans of carrying out subversion
in Colombia and Brazil — a claim
angrily denied by the governments of
both these countries.
A small, desperately poor country of
3 million people seems hardly enough
of a threat to warrant so much atten
tion from a major power. Nicaragua's
crime was to declare its independence
from the United States in defiance of
an American president who sees the
entire world as an ideological bat
tleground.
In 1979 the Nicaraguans overthrew
the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza
and determined to free themselves
from the U.S. domination that had
imposed military occupation and a se
ries of brutal dictatorships on their
country since 1912. The new Sandi
nista government also undertook to
relieve the poverty and inequality that
are endemic throughout Central
America. For the first time. Nicaraguan
peasants had access to health clinics,

schools and land. In 1984, Nicaraguans
voted in the first democratic elections
ever to be held in that country — elec
tions that were judged by international
observers to be remarkably fair.
When Reagan became president, the
Nicaraguan experiment was marked
for destruction. Almost immediately
the CIA began organizing former
Somoza national guard officers into a
rebel force and providing them with
equipment, training and logistical sup
port. Since then the U.S.-backed con
tras have terrorized the Nicaraguan
contryside, assassinating agricultural
advisers, health workers, teachers and
peasants. Human rights organizations
have documented hundreds of cases of
rape, torture and mutilation by contra
forces. Thousands of Nicaraguans have
been killed, many have disappeared.
On Oct. 21 a special U.N. commission
reported that the contras are currently
moving through Honduran refugee
camps, using physical force to enlist
new recruits.
Now that Congress has voted $100
million in U.S. aid to the contras, the
war is bound to increase in intensity
and brutality. The contras are not likely
to win a military victory, but that isn't
necessary, since the purpose of the war
is to steadily bleed the Nicaraguans
and keep their experiment in indepen
dence from succeeding. Former Na
tional Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane told U.S. News & World
Report last April that Nicaragua is a

"bellweather case" for preventing
other small countries from breaking
away from U.S. control. "It is central to
the East/West geostrategic balance that
we win one," he said. "We must define
the problem and focus on one area we
can most easily define as an important
U.S. interest — which ought to be in
this hemisphere. By dint of making it
work in Nicaragua (we] will stand a bet
ter chance of garnering support in
other geostrategic locations."
For Americans this war has so far
been cheap in terms of money and
bloodshed. But there are other costs to
consider. We might ask ourselves, for
instance, how much damage is done to
democratic institutions when a presi
dent takes the country into a secret war
in defiance of Congress and public
opinion. What dangers are involved
when a government comes to rely on
right-wing extremists and professional
terrorists to carry out its policies? What
are the consequences for civilized
world order when a powerful country
defies the ruling of the International
Court of Justice and wages an illegal
war? Finally, where is our country
heading when tormenting a helpless,
backward nation becomes the basis of
its foreign policy? As these questions
suggest, the eventual price of the war
in Nicaragua may be the weakening of
our own democracy.
