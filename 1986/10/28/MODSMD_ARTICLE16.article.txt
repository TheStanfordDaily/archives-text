Include females
in Jewish Studies
With the arrival of the Salo-Baron
library and two new professors,
Jewish Studies is slowly emerging as a
discipline at Stanford. Throughout
history, many Jews have devoted their
lives to the studies of the Talmud and
this history of their people; now, at
Stanford University, this intellectual
pursuit will become available to stu
dents in a modern setting.
The Jewish Studies Celebration,
held yesterday and today,
reflects the excitement and energy of
those who plan to help build the
future program. As a Jewish and Is
raeli Studies major (independently
designed) at Stanford, I would like a
strong and directed program to
emerge but hope that it would offer a
more modern and interdisciplinary
approach to Jewish studies than usual.
It is essential that we create a pro
gram which can be embraced by
anyone in this modern academic
environment. Traditional Jewish
studies has never included women, as
scholars or subjects, even though they
have been influential in many aspects
of Jewish life. Emma Goldman, En
rietta Szold and Golda Meir are just a
few of the many Jewish women who
have helped to shape Jewish life and
values into their present form. Must
we accept Jewish Studies in the tradi
tional form? At this particular point in
Stanford's history when we are re
evaluating traditional programs such
as Western Culture to include
minority and women's voices, die
Jewish Studies curriculum should not
be left behind.
Tomorrow at 4 p.m., there will be a
panel of women who feel a concern
over women's roles in Judaism and
the future of Jewish Studies at Stan
ford. Among the panelists and respon
dents will be Adrienne Rich, Marilyn
Yalom, Suzanne Greenberg, Mary
Lowenthal Feltstiner and students
interested in Jewish Studies at Stan
ford. We will evaluate the present
state of the discipline, discussing and
examining alternative approaches. All
those interested should attend.

Mets, their fans
overly arrogant
Little can be found in Brendan Ross'
argument (Daily, Oct. 24) to support
his claim that campus support for the
Boston Red Sox is based upon
jealousy directed towards the New
York Mets. Regardless of the ar
rogance, or as Ross sees it, the enthus
iasm the Mets displayed throughout
the 1986 season, the Mets do need to
be respected as the dominant team of
the 1986 season. But as a non-Mets fan
who has lived in the New York area
for the past eight years, I feel I can
offer a solution as to why the Mets are
looked on with such disfavor by so
many people.
The solution does not rely on the
arrogance of New York Mets players,
but rather on the arrogance of New
York Mets fans. The anger felt towards
the Mets is based upon the simple fact
that the Mets are another (albeit rare)
winning team for which the arrogant
New York fans can cheer. Until two
years ago, I had almost never heard of
a New York Mets fan, and I live within
90 minutes of Shea Stadium. Sud
denly, with success, I was drowned
with Mets fans, seemingly appearing
out of nowhere. Over 15 years of
secretly keeping an eye on a losing
team can be a difficult thing to keep
bottled up inside, and today's Mets
fans are clearly "letting it all out" with
as much arrogance as possible.
Thus, this bitterness directed
against the Mets is really best ex
plained as resentment for having to
watch New York's "fair-weather" fans
arrogantly cheer on their rare winning
team. Ross displays this arrogance
himself by not even taking into con
sideration the fact that much of the
support around campus for the Red
Sox is just that — support by New
Englanders and other Sox fans from
around the country, regardless of who
they are playing. His basic argument is
correct — the Red Sox are enjoying a
disproportionate amount of support
on campus. This is not as a result of
jealousy, however, as much as it is a
result of having to see a good team
wasted on bad fans.

years ago, I had almost never heard of
a New York Mets fan, and I live within
90 minutes of Shea Stadium. Sud
denly, with success, I was drowned
with Mets fans, seemingly appearing
out of nowhere. Over 15 years of
secretly keeping an eye on a losing
team can be a difficult thing to keep
bottled up inside, and today's Mets
fans are clearly "letting it all out" with
as much arrogance as possible.
Thus, this bitterness directed
against the Mets is really best ex
plained as resentment for having to
watch New York's "fair-weather" fans
arrogantly cheer on their rare winning
team. Ross displays this arrogance
himself by not even taking into con
sideration the fact that much of the
support around campus for the Red
Sox is just that — support by New
Englanders and other Sox fans from
around the country, regardless of who
they are playing. His basic argument is
correct — the Red Sox are enjoying a
disproportionate amount of support
on campus. This is not as a result of
jealousy, however, as much as it is a
result of having to see a good team
wasted on bad fans.
