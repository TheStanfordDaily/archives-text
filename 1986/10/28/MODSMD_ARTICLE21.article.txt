## Producing Pulitzers no problem for Knights 
### JAMES R. DICKEY 
They're here. All over campus. They're in poetry, business
and arms control courses. They're watching rallies,
demonstrations and football games. They range in age from
25 to 59.
They're Knight Fellows.
John S. Knight Journalism Fellows, that is. They've been
here for years, creating a recipe for success that is hard to
equal.
Start with successful mid-career journalists. Then add
seminars, the opportunity to pursue any course of study
available at Stanford and an outstanding and supportive
staff.
Communication Prof. James Risser, a two-time Pulitzer
Prize winner, has been the director of the program for two
years.
"I think programs like this one can make a big impact on
a journalist's career," Risser, a former fellow himself, ex
plained the secret of the program's success. "It gives you a
chance to reflect on the work you do as a journalist and
maybe see how to change or improve (the work)."
This year, 18 journalists are getting that chance.
Originally funded by a $1 million, three-year grant from
the Ford Foundation, the program started in 1966 as "The
Professional Journalism Fellowships at Stanford." It was so
successful that the Ford Foundation renewed the grant, and
Stanford began a matching grant. In 1973, the National En
dowment for the Humanities began sponsoring the Fellow
ships.
The program finally found permanent funding, thanks to
a $4 million grant from the Knight Foundation.
The income from that endowment provides 12 U.S.
journalists with one-year grants covering all tuition and fees,
a nine-month stipend of $20,000 and a book allowance.
Some of the fellow's employers will make up the difference
between the stipend and the fellow's normal salary, Risser
said.
In addition to the domestic journalists, there are six Inter
national Fellows, who are not funded through the Founda
tion but receive a similar stipend from a variety of sources
including Rotary International and the German Marshall
Fund.
While at Stanford, the fellows are not allowed to take
courses for credit. They sign up as auditors in whatever
classes they want to take. The only requirement of the pro

gram is that they attend weekly seminars held specifically
for fellows.
The seminars are organized in order to familiarize fel
lows with experts and distinguished scholars from Stanford
and around the world.
This quarter's speakers include a Pulitzer Prize winner, a
Nobel laureate, a world class photographer and some well
known authors, professors and lawyers.
One of the seminars, an all-day field trip to study Califor
nia's agriculture industry, was especially helpful, according
to Michael Smith, an International Fellow from Australia.
"The trip was very well organized. It showed us a good slice
of California's agriculture," Smith, a reporter for The Age in
Melbourne, said.
The trip included lunch with a labor union representa
tive, tours of a winery and a farm, and informal interviews
with workers and owners along the way.
"The interesting thing to me was that some of the Ameri
can journalists were just as ignorant as I was about Califor
nia's vast agriculture," Smith said.
Although the seminars are the only required activity, the
Fellows tend to be quite busy during their time at Stanford
— some fellows have even taught courses in the Communi
cations Department.
"What you get out of the program is directly proportional
to what you put into it," Smith said. "So none of us are was
ting our time. We're diving right in."
Risser agreed heartily that the program is well worth the
effort.
"The Stanford program has sponsored almost 400 jour
nalists over the course of its history," he explained. "There
are also similar programs at Harvard and Michigan. When
you take that many people and give them a chance to learn
and expand their horizons and then put them back into the
profession, the result is that journalism as a whole is vastly
improved."
Smith put the program on a more personal level.
"I can see it doing two things for me. It gives me a year to
reflect on my attitudes about the world around me.
Secondly, it exposes me to areas of study that I haven't had
the chance to experience," he said.
Reporters are not the only journalists to benefit from the
program.
Michael Greenberg, the senior critic for the San Antonio
Express-News, said he is also studying new ideas. "I'm
taking two courses in Latin American history just so that I

can understand that great (land) mass below us," he said.
Although the program is incredibly helpful, getting in is
anything but easy.
Last year, there were approximately 90 applications for
the 12 U.S. positions. The interested journalists must have
already completed seven years of full-time work in the field,
whether in print or broadcast.
The applicants must submit an autobiographical essay as
well as an essay detailing what they would like to study
while at Stanford and why it is relevant to their careers.
In addition, the prospective fellows are required to send
two recommendations, one from their immediate super
visor, and the names of three references — two of whom

are not in the applicant's own organization.
The long, tough process of reviewing the applications
then begins.
All of the applications are read independently by three
judges: Risser; Harry Press, the managing director (also
long-time editor) of the Stanford Observer and a former fel
low at Harvard's journalism program; and a non-Stanford
journalist with extensive media experience — a different
one each year.
The applicant pool is narrowed down to about 30 out
standing entries. Those lucky enough to pass the first test
