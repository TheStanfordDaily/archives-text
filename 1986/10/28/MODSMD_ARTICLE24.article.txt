## Card afforded less attention 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
There's a difference between being
ranked in the top 20 nationally and
preparing for a nationally televised
game with perennial power USC and
being unranked and preparing for
Washington State.
"It'll be a hell of a lot more peace
ful," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"Frankly, I'd prefer more of last week."
But things will return to quiet
around Stanford this week in the wake
of Saturday's 10-0 loss to the Trojans
which knocked the Cardinal from the
rankings and all but entirely out of the
Rose Bowl picture. The loss was the
first time the Cardinal has been shut
out at home in 22 years.
The Cardinal only ran for 50 yards
against the Trojans, who spent most of
the game using five or six defensive
backs in a 4-2-5 look to neutralize wide
receivers Jeff James and Thomas Hen
ley and the deep passing game.
"Pan of it was maintaining the run
ning game against the 4-2," Elway said,
"and we didn't do that enough. But the
other part of it was our execution on
third down. There were three situa
tions where it was our execution on

the football field."
Stanford was 4-of-13 in third-down
situations. All three times the Cardinal
crossed into USC territory, it failed to
pick up another first down.
After the game, USC defenders said
that quarterback John Paye, who was
held to 122 yards passing, did not look
off the defense, which made coverage
an easier task. "We'll work this week
on throwing back," Elway said. "That's
a natural situation where you roll to
one side and come back to the other.
He (Paye) does have a tendency to lock
on to one receiver."
Stanford also used a no-huddle of
fense on the first series of the game,
when it marched 41 yards in nine plays
to the USC 47-yard line. It was the
longest Stanford drive of the game.
"The reason for that," Elway said, "was
that they had done a lot of substitutions
with their down linemen, a lot of sub
stitutions with five or six defensive
backs. They couldn't do that."
The Stanford defense, on the other
hand, played what could have been its
finest game since Elway arrived here in
1984. "I'd have to reflect on that," he
said. "It was certainly equal to the best.

Brad Muster, shown here being stopped by Trojan linebacker Marcus Cotton, gained just 35 yards on eight carries against USC.
That's a fair assessment of that effort.
"They gave the offense every oppor
tunity to take charge of the momen
tum. In terms of the goal-line stand,
they did a tremendous job there. They
sustained more than we did on the of
fensive side of the ball, like they have
all year."
"I think that was the first time in the
last few years we weren't out
physicaled," linebacker Kevin Richard
son said. "We have no control over the
offense. You hope your big plays in
spire the offense. I know on special
teams all day we were trying to inspire
the offense and put us in a position
where we can score."
This week's opponent features a
slightly less stringent defense than
USC. Washington State is allowing 406
yards per game and lost last week to

UCLA, 54-16.
"I don't think Washington State is as
good a defensive football team as
USC," Elway said.
"I looked at USC," Washington State
Coach Jim Walden said, "and they've
got guys named Brock and McDonald
and Cotton playing like it's lights-out
time. I looked on my depth chart, and
theie are no guys named Brock or
McDonald or Cotton."
Nonetheless, Washington State beat
USC, 34-14, three weeks ago. "We
threw and caught the ball as well as we
have all season against USC," Walden
said. "We threw and caught the ball as
badly as we have all season Saturday."
Card notes
Linebacker David Wyman was credited
with a career-high 27 tackles in the USC
game. Wyman was nominated for Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Week, an award
which went to USC cornerback Louis
Brock, whose 40-yard interception return
set up the game's only touchdown.
