# Frustrating road trip for Stanford women's soccer
## 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
It was a disappointing and difficult
weekend for the Stanford women's
soccer team as it lost a pair of games
on the road in Southern California.
Saturday, the Cardinal was matched
up against unpredictable, explosive
Long Beach State. As had been ex
pected, the 6-6-2 49ers were a very
even match for Stanford.
Playing with many of their previ
ously injured players back on the

roster, Long Beach took the Cardinal to
the limit in a grueling 120-minute mar
athon game — including two
overtimes — and eventually oudasted
Stanford 3-2.
Sunday, the Cardinal was over
whelmed 5-1 by lOth-ranked Cal State -
Dominguez Hills.
Stanford scored first against Long
Beach on a goal by midfielder Stacey
Keare 17 minutes into the game. About
11 minutes later, the 49ers answered
the challenge with a goal of their own.
At halftime, the teams were tied at 1-

1, and when the Cardinal returned to
the field, it was determined to improve
on its first-half performance. "We
played OK the first half," Stanford
Coach Helen Keohane said. "The
second half we came out much bet
ter. ... We attacked more freely."
Following an early goal by Long
Beach at the 55-minute mark that put
the 49ers ahead 2-1, Stanford attacked
tenaciously. While the Cardinal took
only five shots at the 49er goal in the
first period, it took the ball to the goal
14 times in the second half.
During the next 30 minutes, no
goals were scored. Both goalkeepers
were effective, and Stanford bounced
several shots off the 49er goal posts.
With seven minutes to go in regula
tion time, Cardinal sophomore Christy
McDevitt slammed home her second
goal of the year. "She created the goal
herself," Keohane said. "It was second
effort."
The game then went into its first 15-
minute overtime, during which Stan
ford took seven shots on the 49er goal,
while Long Beach recorded no at
tempts.
One of the Cardinal's shots ricoc
heted off of the goalkeeper and then
bounced off the goal post. Following
the near miss, frustration began to set
in for the Cardinal. "Emotionally, we
didn't get the breaks," Keohane said.
Five minutes into the second
overtime, the 49ers scored a goal off of
a corner kick, bringing the game to its
final score.
Sunday, there was no rest for the
Cardinal. The team moved on to Cal
State-Dominguez Hills to face the
Toros. Knowing that Dominguez Hills
had a near spotless record of 8-0-2, the
Cardinal could only hope to keep the
score respectable.
During the first half, it seemed that
Stanford might be able to keep up with
the fast-paced Toros. The Cardinal
defense handled the Toro attack well,
but Dominguez Hills' forwards were
"quick with short movements,"
Keohane said. "They were faster than
our backs."
At the half, Dominguez Hills led only
1-0. In the second half, however, the
Stanford players were hot, tired and
feeling the effects of the Los Angeles
area smog. The Toros attacked swiftly
and relentlessly, scoring four more
goals in a short period of time.
"We didn't have enough fight,"
Keohane said. "It all began to snow-

Saturday, the Cardinal was matched
up against unpredictable, explosive
Long Beach State. As had been ex
pected, the 6-6-2 49ers were a very
even match for Stanford.
Playing with many of their previ
ously injured players back on the

roster, Long Beach took the Cardinal to
the limit in a grueling 120-minute mar
athon game — including two
overtimes — and eventually oudasted
Stanford 3-2.
Sunday, the Cardinal was over
whelmed 5-1 by lOth-ranked Cal State -
Dominguez Hills.
Stanford scored first against Long
Beach on a goal by midfielder Stacey
Keare 17 minutes into the game. About
11 minutes later, the 49ers answered
the challenge with a goal of their own.
At halftime, the teams were tied at 1-

1, and when the Cardinal returned to
the field, it was determined to improve
on its first-half performance. "We
played OK the first half," Stanford
Coach Helen Keohane said. "The
second half we came out much bet
ter. ... We attacked more freely."
Following an early goal by Long
Beach at the 55-minute mark that put
the 49ers ahead 2-1, Stanford attacked
tenaciously. While the Cardinal took
only five shots at the 49er goal in the
first period, it took the ball to the goal
14 times in the second half.
During the next 30 minutes, no
goals were scored. Both goalkeepers
were effective, and Stanford bounced
several shots off the 49er goal posts.
With seven minutes to go in regula
tion time, Cardinal sophomore Christy
McDevitt slammed home her second
goal of the year. "She created the goal
herself," Keohane said. "It was second
effort."
The game then went into its first 15-
minute overtime, during which Stan
ford took seven shots on the 49er goal,
while Long Beach recorded no at
tempts.
One of the Cardinal's shots ricoc
heted off of the goalkeeper and then
bounced off the goal post. Following
the near miss, frustration began to set
in for the Cardinal. "Emotionally, we
didn't get the breaks," Keohane said.
Five minutes into the second
overtime, the 49ers scored a goal off of
a corner kick, bringing the game to its
final score.
Sunday, there was no rest for the
Cardinal. The team moved on to Cal
State-Dominguez Hills to face the
Toros. Knowing that Dominguez Hills
had a near spotless record of 8-0-2, the
Cardinal could only hope to keep the
score respectable.
During the first half, it seemed that
Stanford might be able to keep up with
the fast-paced Toros. The Cardinal
defense handled the Toro attack well,
but Dominguez Hills' forwards were
"quick with short movements,"
Keohane said. "They were faster than
our backs."
At the half, Dominguez Hills led only
1-0. In the second half, however, the
Stanford players were hot, tired and
feeling the effects of the Los Angeles
area smog. The Toros attacked swiftly
and relentlessly, scoring four more
goals in a short period of time.
"We didn't have enough fight,"
Keohane said. "It all began to snow-

defending to attacking. There was too
much of a lapse between getting the
ball and going forward."
Stanford did have the pleasure of
scoring the final goal of the game,
saving the Cardinal from a shutout.
Amy Geisse scored the goal, nailing a
