# Mets rally to take Series
## 
### 
NEW YORK — Ray Knight ignited a
three-run rally in the seventh inning
with a home run, climaxing another
New York comeback and sending the
Mets to their second World Series
championship with an 8-5 victory last
night over the Boston Red Sox.
The Mets scored three runs in the
sixth inning, two on a single by Keith
Hernandez, to chase two game Series
winner Bruce Hurst and tie the score
3-3. Then Knight led off the seventh
with a homer to left-center that started
the Mets to their first World Series title
since 1969
Hernandez capped the inning with a
sacrifice fly for a 6-3 lead.
The Mets still had one last obstacle
to overcome as the Red Sox rallied for
two runs in the eighth and had the
tying run on second base with no one
out.
But Jesse Orosco came out of the
bullpen and got Rich Gedman on a line

drive to second, struck out Dave Hen
derson and got pinch-hitter Don
Baylor to ground out to short.
Darrvl Strawberry led off the eighth
with a homer off Boston reliever Al
Nipper Orosco, batting for only the
fourth time this season, singled in
Knight with the eighth New York run.
Winners of a Major League-leading
total of 108 games during the season,
the big question about the Mets was
how they would hold up under pres
sure. They had never been tested.
But they won their third National
League pennant in a tense six-game
playoff with Houston, culminating in
the longest postseason game in history,
a 6-5, 16-inning victory in the
Astrodome
Then, after losing die first two games
of the World Series at home, they
became only the second team in World
Series history to come back to win. The
onlv other team to do it was last vear's

Kansas City Royals.
The Red Sox came back with Hurst
on three days rest, taking advantage of
a rainout of Game 7 on Sunday night. It
was a gamble because Red Sox
Manager John McNamara had said
Hurst didn't pitch well on three days
rest. In his only other appearance this
season on three days rest, he worked
six innings and gave up three runs on
seven hits in Game 5 of the American
League playoffs.
The Red Sox won that game 7-6 in 11
innings to begin a comeback from a 3-
1 deficit against California. This time,
the Red Sox couldn't quite make it all
the way back.
And thus continued the sad saga of
the Red Sox, losers of four straight
seven game World Series — 1946,
1967, 1975 and 1986. In fact, the Red
Sox have not won a Series since 1918,
