# Mets rally to take Series
## 
### 
NEW YORK — Ray Knight ignited a
three-run rally in the seventh inning
with a home run, climaxing another
New York comeback and sending the
Mets to their second World Series
championship with an 8-5 victory last
night over the Boston Red Sox.
The Mets scored three runs in the
sixth inning, two on a single by Keith
Hernandez, to chase two game Series
winner Bruce Hurst and tie the score
3-3. Then Knight led off the seventh
with a homer to left-center that started
the Mets to their first World Series title
since 1969
Hernandez capped the inning with a
sacrifice fly for a 6-3 lead.
The Mets still had one last obstacle
to overcome as the Red Sox rallied for
two runs in the eighth and had the
tying run on second base with no one
out.
But Jesse Orosco came out of the
bullpen and got Rich Gedman on a line

drive to second, struck out Dave Hen
derson and got pinch-hitter Don
Baylor to ground out to short.
Darrvl Strawberry led off the eighth
with a homer off Boston reliever Al
Nipper Orosco, batting for only the
fourth time this season, singled in
Knight with the eighth New York run.
Winners of a Major League-leading
total of 108 games during the season,
the big question about the Mets was
how they would hold up under pres
sure. They had never been tested.
But they won their third National
League pennant in a tense six-game
playoff with Houston, culminating in
the longest postseason game in history,
a 6-5, 16-inning victory in the
Astrodome
Then, after losing die first two games
of the World Series at home, they
became only the second team in World
Series history to come back to win. The
onlv other team to do it was last vear's

Kansas City Royals.
The Red Sox came back with Hurst
on three days rest, taking advantage of
a rainout of Game 7 on Sunday night. It
was a gamble because Red Sox
Manager John McNamara had said
Hurst didn't pitch well on three days
rest. In his only other appearance this
season on three days rest, he worked
six innings and gave up three runs on
seven hits in Game 5 of the American
League playoffs.
The Red Sox won that game 7-6 in 11
innings to begin a comeback from a 3-
1 deficit against California. This time,
the Red Sox couldn't quite make it all
the way back.
And thus continued the sad saga of
the Red Sox, losers of four straight
seven game World Series — 1946,
1967, 1975 and 1986. In fact, the Red
Sox have not won a Series since 1918,
when Babe Ruth was still with the club.
In Game 6, they were one out away from winning it all,
leading 5-3 with two outs in the 10th inning. But the Mets
came back to score three runs on three straight hits, a
wild pitch and an error by first baseman Bill Buckner.
Knight's homer came off Calvin Schiraldi, the loser in
Game 6 who had come in to start the seventh for Hurst.
After Knight's homer, the 11th of the World Series but
the first by a home-team player, Lenny Dykstra came in to
hit for Kevin Mitchell and singled to right. Dykstra went
to second on a wild pitch on a pitchout, and Rafael San
tana singled down the first-base line for another run.
Pitcher Roger McDowell sacrificed Santana to second,
and Joe Sambito came in to pitch for Boston. He walked
Mookie Wilson intentionally, then walked Wally Back
man to load the bases. Hernandez followed with a
sacrifice fly to center that chased Sambito, and Bob Stan
ley got Gary Carter to ground out.
The Mets led 6-3, and they were on their way.

The Mets started poorly in the seventh game as Dwight
Evans and Gedman hit consecutive homers in the second
inning and Boston jumped to a 3-0 lead off Ron Darling.
The Mets finally got to Hurst in the sixth inning and
tied the score 3-3 with three runs, two on Hernandez'
bases-loaded single.
Hurst had retired 11 in a row and had allowed one hit
when the Mets sent up pinch-hitter Lee Mazzilli, who sin
gled and scored the tying run in the eighth inning of
Game 6. Mazzilli singled with one out, and Wilson fol
lowed with a single that sent Mazzilli to second.
Hurst then walked Tim Teufel on five pitches to load
the bases, bringing up Hernandez, who had only one RBI
in the previous six games. Hernandez took one strike,
then hit a slicing line drive into left-center, easily scoring
two runs and sending Teufel to tnird.
Backman then came in to run for Teufel, and Carter hit
a little looper into right field. Right fielder Evans made a
dive for the ball, but couldn't come up with it cleanly.
Backman scored easily, but when Evans rolled over the
ball, Hernandez couldn't clearly tell whether it had been
caught. That gave Evans time to throw Hernandez out at
second for the second out of the inning, and Strawberry
lined out to shallow left for the third out of the inning.

drive to second, struck out Dave Hen
derson and got pinch-hitter Don
Baylor to ground out to short.
Darrvl Strawberry led off the eighth
with a homer off Boston reliever Al
Nipper Orosco, batting for only the
fourth time this season, singled in
Knight with the eighth New York run.
Winners of a Major League-leading
total of 108 games during the season,
the big question about the Mets was
how they would hold up under pres
sure. They had never been tested.
But they won their third National
League pennant in a tense six-game
playoff with Houston, culminating in
the longest postseason game in history,
a 6-5, 16-inning victory in the
Astrodome
Then, after losing die first two games
of the World Series at home, they
became only the second team in World
Series history to come back to win. The
onlv other team to do it was last vear's

Kansas City Royals.
The Red Sox came back with Hurst
on three days rest, taking advantage of
a rainout of Game 7 on Sunday night. It
was a gamble because Red Sox
Manager John McNamara had said
Hurst didn't pitch well on three days
rest. In his only other appearance this
season on three days rest, he worked
six innings and gave up three runs on
seven hits in Game 5 of the American
League playoffs.
The Red Sox won that game 7-6 in 11
innings to begin a comeback from a 3-
1 deficit against California. This time,
the Red Sox couldn't quite make it all
the way back.
And thus continued the sad saga of
the Red Sox, losers of four straight
seven game World Series — 1946,
1967, 1975 and 1986. In fact, the Red
Sox have not won a Series since 1918,
when Babe Ruth was still with the club.
In Game 6, they were one out away from winning it all,
leading 5-3 with two outs in the 10th inning. But the Mets
came back to score three runs on three straight hits, a
wild pitch and an error by first baseman Bill Buckner.
Knight's homer came off Calvin Schiraldi, the loser in
Game 6 who had come in to start the seventh for Hurst.
After Knight's homer, the 11th of the World Series but
the first by a home-team player, Lenny Dykstra came in to
hit for Kevin Mitchell and singled to right. Dykstra went
to second on a wild pitch on a pitchout, and Rafael San
tana singled down the first-base line for another run.
Pitcher Roger McDowell sacrificed Santana to second,
and Joe Sambito came in to pitch for Boston. He walked
Mookie Wilson intentionally, then walked Wally Back
man to load the bases. Hernandez followed with a
sacrifice fly to center that chased Sambito, and Bob Stan
ley got Gary Carter to ground out.
The Mets led 6-3, and they were on their way.

The Mets started poorly in the seventh game as Dwight
Evans and Gedman hit consecutive homers in the second
inning and Boston jumped to a 3-0 lead off Ron Darling.
The Mets finally got to Hurst in the sixth inning and
tied the score 3-3 with three runs, two on Hernandez'
bases-loaded single.
Hurst had retired 11 in a row and had allowed one hit
when the Mets sent up pinch-hitter Lee Mazzilli, who sin
gled and scored the tying run in the eighth inning of
Game 6. Mazzilli singled with one out, and Wilson fol
lowed with a single that sent Mazzilli to second.
Hurst then walked Tim Teufel on five pitches to load
the bases, bringing up Hernandez, who had only one RBI
in the previous six games. Hernandez took one strike,
then hit a slicing line drive into left-center, easily scoring
two runs and sending Teufel to tnird.
Backman then came in to run for Teufel, and Carter hit
a little looper into right field. Right fielder Evans made a
dive for the ball, but couldn't come up with it cleanly.
Backman scored easily, but when Evans rolled over the
ball, Hernandez couldn't clearly tell whether it had been
caught. That gave Evans time to throw Hernandez out at
second for the second out of the inning, and Strawberry
lined out to shallow left for the third out of the inning.
NEW YORK — Ray Knight ignited a
three-run rally in the seventh inning
with a home run, climaxing another
New York comeback and sending the
Mets to their second World Series
championship with an 8-5 victory last
night over the Boston Red Sox.
The Mets scored three runs in the
sixth inning, two on a single by Keith
Hernandez, to chase two game Series
winner Bruce Hurst and tie the score
3-3. Then Knight led off the seventh
with a homer to left-center that started
the Mets to their first World Series title
since 1969
Hernandez capped the inning with a
sacrifice fly for a 6-3 lead.
The Mets still had one last obstacle
to overcome as the Red Sox rallied for
two runs in the eighth and had the
tying run on second base with no one
out.
But Jesse Orosco came out of the
bullpen and got Rich Gedman on a line

drive to second, struck out Dave Hen
derson and got pinch-hitter Don
Baylor to ground out to short.
Darrvl Strawberry led off the eighth
with a homer off Boston reliever Al
