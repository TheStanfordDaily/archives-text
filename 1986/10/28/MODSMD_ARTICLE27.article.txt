# Cardinal spikers face challenge at Cal Poly UCLA takes over Pac-10 lead
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
On a usual Tuesday, Stanford's women's volleyball
players can look forward to a relatively easy, pressure
free day. They'll have practice at 6 p.m., and by 8:30 p.m.
they'll probably be back at home, with their next match
not until the weekend.
This is an unusual Tuesday, however, because at 6
p.m., the spikers will be traveling to Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, not Maples Pavilion, and by 8:30 they'll be in the
middle of a contest with the No. 11 team in the nation.
The Cardinal is No. 10 in the country with a 12-6
record overall. The squad is 8-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence but dropped to second place in the standings this
weekend despite a win over California in its only game.
UCLA played and won twice to go to 9-1 and capture sole
possession of the league lead. Stanford beat the Bruins
Oct. 18 in three straight games.
The Mustangs compete in the Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation along with such powerhouses as San Jose State,
San Diego State and Hawaii. They are 8-5 in conference
play, 17-9 overall. The match will be the teams' only
meeting during the regular season.
For its second match in a row, Stanford will be facing a
team which wins with its defense. The words Stanford
Coach Don Shaw used to describe Cal Poly were almost
exactly the same as those Theresa Smith used to charac
terize Cal before Friday night's match.
"They re a real good team; they are very scrappy,'

Shaw said. "Their defense is excellent; they never let the
ball hit the ground. You have to be ready for the ball to
keep coming back over the net."
Shaw said his team will have to be prepared to play
long rallies throughout the evening. "We won't be able
to just pass, set and hit once and then expect the point to
be over," he said. "Against Cal Poly, we're going to have
to pass, set and hit over and over again."
Middle blocker Carol Tschasar is out in front of the
Mustang offense this season with a .291 hitting
percentage, having recorded 291 kills. Tschasar leads in
blocks as well with 124.
The senior is most frequently set by Claudia Hem
mersbach, who is averaging !0.1 assists per game Hem
mersbach follows Tschasar in hitting percentage at 226.
On the Stanford side, Smith leads the hitters with 271
kills and is tops in hitting percentage as well at .363.
Nancy Reno tops the blocks category and Barbra Fontana
is first in digs. Wendi Rush has an average of 11.3 assists
per game
The Cardinal's most important game of the week
comes Saturday night when it hosts No. 17 Oregon, the
only team in the Pac-10 to defeat Stanford so far this
season.
The Ducks boast the talents of Terri Kramer and Mi
chelle Krebsbach, who are second and third,
respectively, in the nation in kills per game. They have a
mind-boggling combined kills total of 974.
Stephanie Snyder sets up the duo and leads the nation
in assists with 1,238.
