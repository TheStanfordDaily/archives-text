Stanford senior Roberto Mata is in
stable condition at the University
Hospital after sustaining critical injur
ies in a motorcycle accident on campus
early Friday.
Mata was riding a motorcycle when
he ran into a tree alongside Stanford
Avenue near the intersection with
Peter Coutts Road at approximately
1:40 a.m. Friday, according to Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
The Stanford police arrived on the

scene shortly afterwards and found
Mata conscious but not moving. The
police called in a paramedic unit,
which took Mata to the hospital.
Mata remained in critical condition
throughout the weekend in the hospi
tal's intensive care unit. He was moved
to the neurosurgical unit yesterday,
according to Nurse Jean Toombs.
"He's doing pretty well," Toombs
said yesterday. "He's alert and talking
and receiving visitors."
Mata's neck was injured in the acci
dent, causing a loss of motor move
ment.

"He will need rehabilitation. We
don't know exactly how much (motor)
functioning is going to come back,"
Toombs said.
Toombs said she could not provide
further details on the injuries because
of the patient's right to privacy of infor
mation.
Mata is expected to be released from
the hospital later this week and to en
ter a rehabilitation center, where he
will live "probably for a few months,"
according to Toombs.
The accident has been turned over
to the California Highway Patrol.
