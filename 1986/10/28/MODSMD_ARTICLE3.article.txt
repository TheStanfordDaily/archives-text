# Japan trip for seniors raffled
## 
### KACEY FITZPARTICK 
One lucky senior and the friend of
his or her choice will enjoy a luxurious
Thanksgiving holiday in Tokyo, Japan,
and get to root for the Cardinal in its
tory in its Nov. 30 football game against
the University of Arizona.
The Stanford Alumni Association is
sponsoring the raffle of two tickets to
the Coca-Cola Bowl (formerly the
Mirage Bowl). Raffle tickets cost $1
each and are being sold every day until
Nov. 6 from noon to 1 p.m. in White
Plaza. Seniors may purchase as many
raffle tickets as they wish after showing

their senior class ID card.
The net worth of the two packages is
$2,690. In the words of Senior Class
President B.G. Porter: "This is such a
fantastic opportunity. The winner will
have the most amazing Thanksgiving
possible during four years at Stanford
and definitely the least expensive."
Among perks included in the pack
age are round-trip flight tickets with
Japan Air, five-night accomodations at
the 5-Star Imperial Hotel in Tokyo,
pre-game champagne brunch, $100
Gold Seat game ticket with buffet and
beverages, Japanese-style Thanksgiving
dinner, American breakfast daily, a

lecture by Stanford faculty on Japan
and Korea, and a half-day sightseeing
tour of Tokyo.
According to Steve Hargadon of the
Alumni Association: "A lot of seniors
leave Stanford without ever knowing
anything about the Alumni Associa
tion." The raffle hopefully will give it
some visibility and promote more in
teraction, he said.
The raffle also fulfills one of the
campaign promises made by the four
senior class presidents when they were
running for office last spring. Porter,
Mary Obana, Monica Lytle and Novian
Whitsitt promised a "senior suitcase
party." This trip certainly fits the bill.
Senior year is also the first time that
class identity is formed and acknowl
edged at Stanford, according to Porter.
"This is a first step in trying to build up
class spirit and develop a real sense of
unity."
Yesterday, the first day of ticket sales,
"seniors thought it was a gimmick" and
rode past on their bikes, refusing to
stop, according to Porter. The trip to
Japan is not a mirage, it's for real.
The Coca-Cola Bowl is the only
NCAA-authorized game held outside
the United States. This is the 11th an
nual game to involve American football
teams facing each other in Tokyo. It is
the first football game, in nearly 100
years of athletics, that Stanford will

play outside the country.
In addition to the raffle, the Alumni
Association is selling travel packages
for the game weekend in Tokyo. Ac
cording to Hargadon, approximately
250 packages have been purchased so
far, mostly by alumni.
The official Stanford traveling group
consists of 215 people: the team,
coaches, administrators and 95 Stan
ford Band members. The trip extends
from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, who will join the trip to Japan,
has been invited to draw the winning
raffle ticket. The drawing will take
place at noon on Friday, Nov. 7, at the
Bowman Alumni Center. One need not
be present to win.
There will be a party with a live
band, food and beverages at the
drawing.
Seniors, who cannot make it to
White Plaza at noon in order to buy
tickets, are invited to call the Senior
Class Hotline (723-6332).
