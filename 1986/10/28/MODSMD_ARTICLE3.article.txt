# Japan trip for seniors raffled
## 
### KACEY FITZPARTICK 
One lucky senior and the friend of
his or her choice will enjoy a luxurious
Thanksgiving holiday in Tokyo, Japan,
and get to root for the Cardinal in its
tory in its Nov. 30 football game against
the University of Arizona.
The Stanford Alumni Association is
sponsoring the raffle of two tickets to
the Coca-Cola Bowl (formerly the
Mirage Bowl). Raffle tickets cost $1
each and are being sold every day until
Nov. 6 from noon to 1 p.m. in White
Plaza. Seniors may purchase as many
raffle tickets as they wish after showing

their senior class ID card.
The net worth of the two packages is
$2,690. In the words of Senior Class
President B.G. Porter: "This is such a
fantastic opportunity. The winner will
have the most amazing Thanksgiving
possible during four years at Stanford
and definitely the least expensive."
Among perks included in the pack
age are round-trip flight tickets with
Japan Air, five-night accomodations at
the 5-Star Imperial Hotel in Tokyo,
pre-game champagne brunch, $100
Gold Seat game ticket with buffet and
beverages, Japanese-style Thanksgiving
dinner, American breakfast daily, a

lecture by Stanford faculty on Japan
and Korea, and a half-day sightseeing
tour of Tokyo.
According to Steve Hargadon of the
Alumni Association: "A lot of seniors
leave Stanford without ever knowing
anything about the Alumni Associa
tion." The raffle hopefully will give it
some visibility and promote more in
teraction, he said.
The raffle also fulfills one of the
campaign promises made by the four
senior class presidents when they were
running for office last spring. Porter,
