Kennedy: Stanford gains in competition
Stanford continues to gain in the national competition
for top freshman talent, University President Donald
Kennedy told several hundred alumni attending an infor
mal breakfast on the Inner Quadrangle last week.
Preliminary inquiries currently are running 16 percent
ahead of last year, when more than 16,000 high school
seniors applied for admission to the class of 1990, he
said.
In 1980 Stanford "lost heavily to Harvard" and "was on
par or a little behind" Yale and Princeton in attracting
students admitted to two or more of these institutions,
he said.
Now Stanford has a margin of about 2-1 among those
also admitted to Yale and Princeton, but "we still lose to
Harvard," Kennedy said.
Our friendly rivals from Cambridge are an extraordi
nary draw" for undergraduates and "it's going to take a
lot to match them, said Kennedy, who holds three
degrees from Harvard.
Computer science professor named
Jean-Claude Latombe, one of the world's leading auth
orities on reasoning as applied to robotics, has been ap
pointed a tenured professor of computer science, effec
tive Jan. 1,1987.

Latombe, currently a professor of computer science at
the National Polytechnic Institute Of Grenoble,
developed the important programming language LM,
which enables a human programmer to direct the ac
tions of a robot by representing the workspace in which
it functions and the materials with which it must work.
The language has been adapted for use in more than 100
French industrial installations.
Latombe's longterm goal is to be able to specify to a
robot system what needs to be done and then let the sys
tem automatically figure out how to do it, thus eliminat
ing the need for detailed human programming.
Institute for International Studies seeks director
Stanford has launched a major search for the director
for its new Institute for International Studies.
The institute, organized to strengthen international re
search and teaching, will control the allocation of four
faculty appointments. Its director will report to Civil En
gineering Prof. Robert Street, vice provost and dean of
research, a on administrative and research matters and
advise relevant school deans on issues related to teach
ing.
In cooperation with the deans, the director will have
an opportunity to design and develop innovative inter
disciplinary curricula at the undergraduate and master's
degree levels.
