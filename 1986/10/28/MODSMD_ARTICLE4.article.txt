# Pub opens on trial basis
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
A student-run pub will open at En
cina Station on a trial basis next month,
student and administrative organizers
said yesterday.
The pub, temporarily called
'Junior's" in honor of Leland Stanford
Jr., will be open Nov. 13,14 and 15, and
again Nov. 20, 21 and 22, from 8 p.m. to
2 a.m., said Vip Tolat, vice president of
the Graduate Students Association.
Even if the trial run is a success, a
permanent location for the pub prob
ably will still be unknown, Tolat said.
One possible location is the Old
Firehouse, but that would not be a
reality, if approved, for at least two
years, according to GSA President Mi
chael Green.
The pub is supposed to be "an al
ternative to the Coffee House," Green
said. "It's not a place for people to
come and study."
A formal statement will be issued
this afternoon or tomorrow.
The objective of the pub is to find a
focal point for social events for
graduate students, Tolat said.
Although the motivation behind the
GSA's efforts is to design a pub for the
benefit of graduate students, "this pub
is certainly something for the whole
student body," Green said.
"This is a first step for achieving a
student union," Tolat said.
All students will be allowed to enter
the pub, but some type of stamping
process will occur to distinguish the el
igible drinkers from those who are un
derage, Tolat said.

GSA received approximately $600 as
start-up capital from Tresidder Union
Food Service, said Ellie Oppenheim,
Tresidder Union director. Saga also
contributed some money to help the
pub, Oppenheim said.
The two groups are also offering
their advice and expertise, she added.
If it works well, it is feasible that
Tresidder could help the pub on a
more permanent basis, Oppenheim
said.
Saga is also involved to help ex
pedite the pub process, because Saga
holds the liquor license on campus,
Tolat said. Saga's and Tresidder's in
volvement now may not continue in
the future, he added.
Green said the people at Tresidder
and Saga have been "very pleasant
They have the concerns of the students
in mind."
They are not talking as corporations
looking to maximize their profit, he
added.
"They want to make students' lives a
little brighter.... They seem to be
giving us a very free hand," Green said.
Oppenheim said that some type of
gathering place for students to
"congregate and meet" is something
both she and the University are in favor
of. Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
has been kept abreast of the develop
ments and will be meeting with the
GSA on Friday, she said.
"It is a good first step," she said.
The pub will be managed "Corner
Pocket style," meaning Saga will pro
vide the food and students will set the
prices and determine the menu, ac
cording to Tolat.

He said the pub will be offering beer
at prices comparable to those at the
Coffee House, but with better quality
and selection. Heineken and Bass Ale
may be served on tap. Other alcoholic
beverages will include wine and wine
coolers.
Junior's will also offer a "decent se
lection of food to de-emphasize alco
hol" and comply with University
policy, Tolat said. The menu and prices
have yet to be set by Tolat and GSA
Public Director Larry Lessard. Tolat
and Lessard will be responsible for
running the pub.
"We are trying to run the project as
low-cost as possible," Tolat said
Bartenders are currently being hired,
and the pub will offer "affordable,
fairly cheap" munchies, such as soft
pretzels, peanuts and possibly pizza.
The point of the pub is not to turn a
profit, he said.
During the trial period, the pub will
feature the band The Distractions, a
dance night and continuous music. A
suggestion sheet will also be available
for student input.
Tolat said he is predicting this to be
"a helluva operation," but would not
estimate how many people he expects
to walk through Junior's doors.
"It's a trial. We would really like to
be able to do well," Green said. He
also explained that Junior's will pro
vide a reasonably priced place for stu
dents to go, especially if they do not
have transportation.
Green said the University does have
the last say as to whether the pub will
exist on a permanent basis.
