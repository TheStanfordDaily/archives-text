# Berkeley and MIT lure grad students away from Stanford

UC-Berkeley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy are the primary competitors for Stanford graduate stu
dents, according to a report prepared by the Graduate Ad
ministrative Center.
Of the 288 students who were offered full financial aid
but declined admission to Stanford, Berkeley enrolled 127
and MIT captured 98. Harvard, the California Institute of
Technology and Princeton rounded out the top five.
The Chemistry Department was hit hardest, with 39 stu
dents choosing rival schools. Engineering and the other
sciences lost a considerable number of students as well.
The University sent questionnaires to the 288 students
who declined admission to Stanford. Seventy-eight percent
(225 students) responded.
Many graduates cited fellowship offers as a reason for
going elsewhere. Chemistry, math and most engineering
department offers were reported to be substantially lower
than those offered by other schools. The average chemistry
offer was said to be $11,416, as compared to Stanford's offer
of $10,000.
This year's tuition at Stanford is $11,208 for three quarters
of graduate study at most departments.
Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies Elizabeth
Traugott said: "All (schools) have been told that their
chemistry fellowships are lower than someplace else, and
we're puzzled about that Chemistry and Economics are
always cited as departments that have the lowest stipends."
Stanford often offers nine-month stipends instead of the
12-month stipends awarded elsewhere, so this may account
for some of the discrepancy reported by the students, ac
cording to Traugott.
Contacts with faculty and students were also mentioned
by graduates who completed Stanford's questionnaire.
Several referred to the "unavailability of professors" and
negative experiences with administrative offices.
While there is a disparity in the way individual depart

merits handle visits by prospective students, "There is a
great deal of effort to let people know what's going on,"
Traugott said. But there is "no University-wide procedure,
and in some cases, people expect this."
Because there are fewer prestigious universities in the
West, visitors "may look at only one or two schools and not
get as much out of it as in the East, where there are four or
five," she said.
Traugott added that she suspects these students come
away from a trip to the West with less information than they
might have expected and so think less of the universities in
volved.
Other reasons given by the students were overall pro
gram and research opportunities, environment of school,
geographic location and personal reasons. Housing costs
and availability were also factors, while loan indebted
ness and child care arrangements had little effect on deci
sions.
Traugott said that, although some graduates have strong
reasons for declining Stanford's offer of admission, "These
decisions aren't always terminal." Some students who
decline this year will eventually transfer if they become dis
appointed by their first choice.
"We do the decline study every year, and these are fairly
standard responses. We are doing extremely we 11.... The
study shows extraordinary respect for the faculty," Traugott
said.
She stressed that because the decline study is optional,
"the people that do it are those with very strong feelings,
positive or negative." She said she believes that if all of the
declining students had responded and if questionnaires had
been gathered from students who did enroll, the results
might have been more meaningful. "We shouldn't take
every word literally," she said.
The ultimate goal of the study is to compare and continu
ally improve Stanford's reputation with regard to other uni
versities. "We always have competition, and it's good to
have. It's important that we have this study," Traugott said.
