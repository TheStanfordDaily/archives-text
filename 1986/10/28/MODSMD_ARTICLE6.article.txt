"Rambo and counter-Rambo kinds of solutions"
won't end terrorism in the Middle East, according to
Najib Abboud, a Lebanese graduate student in civil
engineering here who spoke yesterday at the Bechtel
International Center.
At a forum entitled "Terrorism: The Middle East'
— pan of the continuing "International Perspectives
on Peace" lecture series — Abboud and a panel of
three respondents discussed the origins and charac
ter of terrorism in the Middle East and compared it to
other terrorist movements around the world.
According to Abboud, what the West today consid
ers terrorism in the Middle East arose out of the land
conflicts between Arabs and Israelis in the early 20th
century and took its modern form after the creation
of Israel in 1948.
Since then, and especially since the defeat of the
Arabs in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. Palestinian
groups, frustrated with the inability of conventional
warfare to establish a Palestinian state, have increas
ingly resorted to "terrorist" violence in an effort to
advance their goals, according to Abboud.

In recent years, he said, this violence has become
international in scope and is often directed toward
Americans for two reasons: first, to overcome inter
national indifference toward the "Palestinian prob
lem," and second because, by giving aid and arms to
Israel, the United States has become part of this prob
lem. "For lots of people, the distinction between Is
rael and America is not so great," he said.
Abboud then addressed the question of interna
tional efforts to control Middle East terrorism. The
"forceful" tactics that have allowed the German and
Italian governments to keep under control such
groups as the Baader-Meinhof gang and the Red
Brigades won't work on the Palestinians, he said, be
cause of the "difference here between small ideolog
ical groups and a popular movement "
Recent American and Israeli uses of force against
Palestinians, or "Rambo-type solutions," only in
crease the frustration of the Palestinians and ac
celerate the spiral of violence in the area, he added
Conventional warfare is also out of the question,
said Abboud A "war of liberation" for Palestine is a
romantic but unrealistic notion in the face of over
whelming Israeli military superiority, he explained

Only an international conference, with Israel on
one side of the table and the Palestinian Liberation
Organization on the other and with the United States
and the Soviet Union present to enforce any agree
ment, will lead to a solution of the Palestinian prob
lem and thus end Palestinian terrorism in the Middle
East, concluded Abboud.
In response to Abboud, Sarah Lancman, a graduate
student in political science here from Israel, denied
the legitimacy of terrorism as an instrument of politi
cal policy and questioned the PLO's willingness to
permit any sort of "solution" that allows the state of
Israel to exist. The PLO, she said, wants to establish a
"Palestinian democratic state instead of Israel ...
which means Israel must disappear." Israel cannot
accept this, she added. "How can you negotiate with
someone who wants for you the peace of the grave?"
The Palestinian problem should be resolved,
Lancman said, but explained that the PLO "isn't really
ready to negotiate" and accept the legitimacy of the
state of Israel. When the PLO is ready, she said, Israel
will be willing to accept a Palestinian state alongside
it.
