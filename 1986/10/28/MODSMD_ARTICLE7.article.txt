Soviet spy arrested in Palo Alto
SAN FRANCISCO — A disgruntled former Air Force sergeant was ar
rested yesterday and charged with trying to deliver secrets about an Air
Force reconnaissance program to the Soviet Union, authorities said.
Allen John Davies of S;in Jose, a naturalized American citizen who works
for lord Aerospace & Communications Corp., was arrested by FBI agents
in Palo Alto, said U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello.
The charge is punishable by up to life in prison.
Davies, 33, was arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Frederick Woelflen and
held pending a hearing Thursday on a government request to keep him in
custody without bail until trial.
Davies showed no emotion during the brief hearing in a packed court
room.
On Sept. 22, Davies met in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park with an un
dercover FBI agent who posed as a representative of the Soviet consulate
in San Francisco and offered information about the Air Force program, ac
cording to a sworn statement by an FBI agent filed in federal court.
Russioniello told reporters that Davies did not ask for any money when
he offered classified information to the agent. "His apparent motive was
Spite," Russoniello said.
Fie said Davies had been discharged in 1984 for "inadequate job perfor
mance ' and apparently felt it was unjustified.
Davies provided "detailed verbal information" about the program as
well as a "hand drawing depicting various aspects" of the program, accord
ing to the statement by Agent Roger Edstrom.
1 le said that much of the information Davies provided at the meeting was
classified as secret, according to .Air Force Maj. Boyd Lease, director of the
reconnaissance program.
1 Ie said Davies stated he had worked on the reconnaissance program
while in the Air Force in 1983 and 1984, and had been told not to discuss
his work or disclose the existence of his unit.
Davies said he was providing the information "out of revenge because of
the unfair way he was treated while in the Air Force," the agent said. "Fie
also stated that he wanted to do something to embarrass the U.S. and to in
terfere with the effectiveness of its reconnaissance activities."
A former British subject, Davies served in the Air Force for 10 years and
left the military in June 1984, said the sources.

Bell works for Hasenfus' release
MANAGUA, Nicaragua —Former attorney general Griffin Bell gave the
Sandinista government a list of 19 Nicaraguans in U.S. prisons yesterday in
hopes of generating interest in an exchange for the captured American
airplane crewman, Eugene Hasenfus.
Bell, who is acting as adviser to Hasenfus' Nicaraguan attorney, acknowl
edged he had little expectation that the Sandinista leadership would agree
to such an exchange. In addition, Bell told a news conference, he has no
authority from the U.S. government to offer the Nicaraguans' freedom in
exchange for Hasenfus.
According to Bell's description, therefore, the move seemed to repre
sent little more than a gesture designed to show activity on behalf of
Hasenfus. Bell so far has been refused permission to see Hasenfus and, ac
cording to Nicaraguan law, is not entitled formally to represent him before
the Popular Anti-Somicista Tribunal where the downed cargo handler is on
trial.
Although he did not say so, Bell's comments fit into the general impres
sion here that Hasenfus is nearly certain to be convicted and sentenced,
and that the real question facing him and his defenseJs the.possibility of a
pardon. President Daniel Ortega has said several times a pardon or am
nesty is under consideration. Bell has sought unsuccessfully to meet with
Ortega.
FAA approves aviation package
WASHINGTON — In the wake of the tragic midair collision over Cer
ritos, the Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday that it planned to
make the size of the controlled air space more uniform around the nation's
23 busiest airports and to require private planes to carry equipment that
would alert air traffic controllers to the aircraft's altitude.
The proposals are part of a package of 40 recommendations approved by
FAA Administrator Donald Engen after a special FAA task force con
ducted a monthlong examination of the areas of restricted airspace, called
"terminal control" areas, around major U.S. airports.
Terminal control areas were established in the 1970s as a result of a
dozen midair collisions involving airlines that occurred during the previ
ous decade. These spaces encircle 23 major U.S. airports, which handle 18
percent of the nation's air traffic.
After the most recent midair collision over the Los Angeles suburb of
Cerritos, Aug. 31, in which an Aeromexico DC-9 collided with a small
private plane, killing 82 persons, Engen created the task force to review all
23 terminal control areas.
Archer resigns after sex scandal
LONDON Margaret Thatcher appeared in no hurry Monday to replace
Jeffrev Archer, who resigned as a Conservative Party deputy chairman in a
sex scandal one Tory lawmaker called "some tittle tattle over some tart."
Archer was appointed to the job a year ago by Prime Minister Thatcher,
who held top-level talks yesterday in an attempt to minimize the political
damage.
The best selling novelist resigned Sunday after admitting he had offered
2,000 pounds ( $2,800) to a prostitute who told him newspapers were after
her story because one of her clients said she had a relationship with Ar
cher, 16. He insisted he never met her but offered the money so she could
leave the country.
Archer quit after the weekly News of the World reported that he tried to
pa\ the prostitute, Monica Coghlan, through a middleman last Friday.
Religious leaders call for peace
ASSISI, Italv — Bearing olive branches and offering prayers, Pope John
Paul II and other leaders of great world religions, from Moslems and Jews
to fire-worshipping Zoroastrians, solemnly pledged Monday to work for
peace.
The pope, summing up the resolve of his religious colleagues, urged
world leaders to fashion "strategies of peace with courage and vision."
And the efforts had an immediate, if temporary, impact in far corners of a
war torn globe.
Warring parties in a dozen countries, including Nicaragua, El Salvador
and Cambodia, acceded to the pope s appeal that combatants lay down
their arms for 2-4 hours yesterday. The cease-fire broke down in Lebanon,
however, and minor violations were reported elsewhere.
In his final adress, the pope warned that the choice facing humanity is
"true peace or catastrophic war."
Soviet munitions on U.S. beaches
WASHINGTON — Soviet munitions are continuing to wash up on
Florida beaches from an unknown source, confronting state and federal
agencies with a new mysteiy of the sea. Douglas Phipps, spokesman for the
Palm Beach Count) sheriffs office, and Coast Guard officials agreed that
the detonators and other munitions had been dumped by a plane or ship
in the Gulf Stream, which flows north along the Florida coast at speeds of
a> much as S mph. and were driven ashore b\ currents, tides and winds.
rhough there are some theories as to where the munitions came from,
the sheriff s office has declined to pinpoint an actual theory.
Phipps s.iid authorities have rejected the possibility that a Bahamian
freighter that sank off Florida early this month could Ix* the source. He said

ritos, the Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday that it planned to
make the size of the controlled air space more uniform around the nation's
23 busiest airports and to require private planes to carry equipment that
would alert air traffic controllers to the aircraft's altitude.
The proposals are part of a package of 40 recommendations approved by
FAA Administrator Donald Engen after a special FAA task force con
ducted a monthlong examination of the areas of restricted airspace, called
"terminal control" areas, around major U.S. airports.
Terminal control areas were established in the 1970s as a result of a
dozen midair collisions involving airlines that occurred during the previ
ous decade. These spaces encircle 23 major U.S. airports, which handle 18
percent of the nation's air traffic.
After the most recent midair collision over the Los Angeles suburb of
Cerritos, Aug. 31, in which an Aeromexico DC-9 collided with a small
private plane, killing 82 persons, Engen created the task force to review all
23 terminal control areas.
Archer resigns after sex scandal
LONDON Margaret Thatcher appeared in no hurry Monday to replace
Jeffrev Archer, who resigned as a Conservative Party deputy chairman in a
sex scandal one Tory lawmaker called "some tittle tattle over some tart."
Archer was appointed to the job a year ago by Prime Minister Thatcher,
who held top-level talks yesterday in an attempt to minimize the political
damage.
The best selling novelist resigned Sunday after admitting he had offered
2,000 pounds ( $2,800) to a prostitute who told him newspapers were after
her story because one of her clients said she had a relationship with Ar
cher, 16. He insisted he never met her but offered the money so she could
leave the country.
Archer quit after the weekly News of the World reported that he tried to
pa\ the prostitute, Monica Coghlan, through a middleman last Friday.
Religious leaders call for peace
ASSISI, Italv — Bearing olive branches and offering prayers, Pope John
Paul II and other leaders of great world religions, from Moslems and Jews
to fire-worshipping Zoroastrians, solemnly pledged Monday to work for
peace.
The pope, summing up the resolve of his religious colleagues, urged
world leaders to fashion "strategies of peace with courage and vision."
And the efforts had an immediate, if temporary, impact in far corners of a
war torn globe.
Warring parties in a dozen countries, including Nicaragua, El Salvador
and Cambodia, acceded to the pope s appeal that combatants lay down
their arms for 2-4 hours yesterday. The cease-fire broke down in Lebanon,
however, and minor violations were reported elsewhere.
In his final adress, the pope warned that the choice facing humanity is
"true peace or catastrophic war."
Soviet munitions on U.S. beaches
WASHINGTON — Soviet munitions are continuing to wash up on
Florida beaches from an unknown source, confronting state and federal
agencies with a new mysteiy of the sea. Douglas Phipps, spokesman for the

the detonators and other munitions had been dumped by a plane or ship
in the Gulf Stream, which flows north along the Florida coast at speeds of
a> much as S mph. and were driven ashore b\ currents, tides and winds.
rhough there are some theories as to where the munitions came from,
the sheriff s office has declined to pinpoint an actual theory.

freighter that sank off Florida early this month could Ix* the source. He said

Soviet spy arrested in Palo Alto
SAN FRANCISCO — A disgruntled former Air Force sergeant was ar
rested yesterday and charged with trying to deliver secrets about an Air
Force reconnaissance program to the Soviet Union, authorities said.
Allen John Davies of S;in Jose, a naturalized American citizen who works
for lord Aerospace & Communications Corp., was arrested by FBI agents
in Palo Alto, said U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello.
The charge is punishable by up to life in prison.
Davies, 33, was arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Frederick Woelflen and
held pending a hearing Thursday on a government request to keep him in
custody without bail until trial.
Davies showed no emotion during the brief hearing in a packed court
room.
On Sept. 22, Davies met in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park with an un
dercover FBI agent who posed as a representative of the Soviet consulate
in San Francisco and offered information about the Air Force program, ac
cording to a sworn statement by an FBI agent filed in federal court.
Russioniello told reporters that Davies did not ask for any money when
he offered classified information to the agent. "His apparent motive was
Spite," Russoniello said.
Fie said Davies had been discharged in 1984 for "inadequate job perfor
mance ' and apparently felt it was unjustified.
Davies provided "detailed verbal information" about the program as
well as a "hand drawing depicting various aspects" of the program, accord
ing to the statement by Agent Roger Edstrom.
1 le said that much of the information Davies provided at the meeting was
classified as secret, according to .Air Force Maj. Boyd Lease, director of the
reconnaissance program.
1 Ie said Davies stated he had worked on the reconnaissance program
while in the Air Force in 1983 and 1984, and had been told not to discuss
his work or disclose the existence of his unit.
Davies said he was providing the information "out of revenge because of
the unfair way he was treated while in the Air Force," the agent said. "Fie
also stated that he wanted to do something to embarrass the U.S. and to in
terfere with the effectiveness of its reconnaissance activities."
A former British subject, Davies served in the Air Force for 10 years and
left the military in June 1984, said the sources.

Bell works for Hasenfus' release
MANAGUA, Nicaragua —Former attorney general Griffin Bell gave the
Sandinista government a list of 19 Nicaraguans in U.S. prisons yesterday in
hopes of generating interest in an exchange for the captured American
airplane crewman, Eugene Hasenfus.
Bell, who is acting as adviser to Hasenfus' Nicaraguan attorney, acknowl
edged he had little expectation that the Sandinista leadership would agree
to such an exchange. In addition, Bell told a news conference, he has no
authority from the U.S. government to offer the Nicaraguans' freedom in
exchange for Hasenfus.
According to Bell's description, therefore, the move seemed to repre
sent little more than a gesture designed to show activity on behalf of
Hasenfus. Bell so far has been refused permission to see Hasenfus and, ac
cording to Nicaraguan law, is not entitled formally to represent him before
the Popular Anti-Somicista Tribunal where the downed cargo handler is on
trial.
Although he did not say so, Bell's comments fit into the general impres
sion here that Hasenfus is nearly certain to be convicted and sentenced,
and that the real question facing him and his defenseJs the.possibility of a
pardon. President Daniel Ortega has said several times a pardon or am
nesty is under consideration. Bell has sought unsuccessfully to meet with
Ortega.
