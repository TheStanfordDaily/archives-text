###

crusade five years ago.
Reagan declared the new act a "major victory" in

interlude in his campaign to preserve a Republican
Senate, the president praised "real champions" in
both parties for pushing through the legislation to in
crease funds for drug eradication, interdiction, edu
cation, rehabilitation and treatment.
"We must be intolerant of drug use and drug sel
lers," Reagan said. We mast see that there Is "no sanc
tuary for the drug criminals who are pilfering human
dignity and pandering despair."
The bill, which swept through an election-minded
Congress concerned with public reaction to drug
abuse, increases penalties for drug-related crimes
and authorizes grants to states for drug-law enforce
ment. The final bill cleared the House, 318 to 16, and
the Senate by voice vote.

forts to keep drugs out of the country, including ad
ditional resources for the Coast Guard, the Customs
Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

programs for federal workers.

program in 1987 to assist states and local govern
ments in preventing drug use in schools.
• Allots funds to states for alcohol and drug abuse

for drug abuse professionals and authorizes $42 mil

for additional surveillance aircraft and radar systems.
• Stiffens penalties for manufacturing.
• Establishes fines of up to $4 million for an individ

and $20 million, respectively.
• Makes money laundering subject to a $500,000 fine
and up to 20 years in prison.
• Authorizes nearly $100 million for federal prisons,
and provides new money for federal public
defenders, jurors, commissioners, U.S. attorneys, U.S.
marshals and "secure" voice radios for the Secret
Service and die FBI.
