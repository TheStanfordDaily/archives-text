# U.S. says Soviets distort summit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The White House
lashed out yesterday at continued
claims from Moscow that President
Reagan endorsed a Soviet proposal at
the Reykjavik summit that would have
eliminated all nuclear weapons in 10
years.
"It's a propaganda tactic on their
part," said spokesman Larry Speakes,
accusing the Soviets of trying to whip
up "a side issue" to win points in
Europe. Although Reagan may have
discussed such a far-reaching proposal,
Speakes said, it was never formally
tabled.
In the latest in a series of charges,
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
accused U.S. officials yesterday of
"gross misrepresentation" of what hap
pened two weeks ago at his meeting in
Iceland with Reagan. At the same same,
Gorbachev said there was still hope for
progress on nuclear arms reduction
despite "provocative actions" by the
Reagan administration since the Reyk
javik summit.
The White House maintains that the
U.S. delegation crossed out the word
"strategic" and substituted "ballistic"
in the written proposal presented in
Iceland by the Soviets. Without that
change, which would allow the United

States to keep some cruise missiles on
heavy bombers, the proposed agree
ment would have left Western Europe
virtually defenseless against a massive
buildup of conventional Soviet forces.
Speakes accused the Soviets of
deliberately misinterpreting Reagan's
position "because they read (ballistic)
on the piece of paper that we ex
changed, and that paper is still on the
table with two views." He said that the
United States and the Soviets were in
"a battle for European opinion" and
that the Soviets were trying to foster in
security within the NATO alliance be
cause of the U.S. negotiating stance.
White House Communications
Director Patrick Buchanan called the
Soviet claims an effort to generate dis
content in the United States and in
Europe about Reagan's hard-line posi
tion on "Star Wars" missile defense
program, as the administration's Strate
gic Defense Initiative is popularly
known.
"They thought there would be fire
storms in the U.S. and Europe on SDI,"
Buchanan said. "They're playing catch
up."
A Soviet Foreign Ministry official Sat
urday quoted from the Soviet record of
Reykjavik to contend that Reagan had

agreed at one point to abolish all nu
clear weapons within 10 years. Since
then, the official said, right-wing forces
in the administration have tried to pull
back from such a commitment.
Reporters pressed Speakes to
release the White House notes taken
during Reagan's private session with
Gorbachev to back up the administra
tion's assertion that Reagan would not
embrace an arrangement that banned
all nuclear weapons in 10 years.
Speakes refused to make the notes
public, citing diplomatic confiden
tiality as the administration's chief rea
son for keeping them private. "It's just
not done, and we don't do it,"he said.
The question of exactly what Reagan
did or did not agree to in Reykjavik has
dogged the administration almost from
the moment Reagan returned from
Iceland. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) a
respected authority on arms control is
sues, said he asked Reagan whether he
meant to make strategic weapons part
of the deal in Iceland, and Reagan
replied that he did. White House offi
cials then said Nunn and other con
gressional leaders had
"misunderstood" Reagan's position
and should have questioned him fur
ther.

In the weeks since the Reykjavik
meeting, U.S. and Soviet officials have
waged competing public-relations
campaigns, with each side releasing an
unprecedented amount of information
designed to capitalize on the progress
made and blame any breakdown on
the other side.
Gorbachev said he had proposed a
50 percent cut in strategic weapons,
the elimination of all medium-range
missiles in Europe, the strengthening
of the anti-ballistic missile treaty, and a
nuclear test ban. He said he made
those concessions in the hope that the
Americans would reciprocate.
"If the American side had accepted
this package, a real process of the elim
ination of nuclear weapons would
have got under way," he said in a state
ment made public by the official Soviet
government news agency Tass.
Gorbachev made no mention of the
harsh personal criticism of Reagan that
marked his televised address to the So
viet people Wednesday. On that occa
sion Gorbachev said Reagan either
could not or would not control the
"hawks" in his administration who
want to torpedo any chance of an arms
accord with Moscow.
