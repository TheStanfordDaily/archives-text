### CHRIS SAIGAL Staff writer 
The Undergraduate Admissions of
fice has recently expanded its efforts to
encourage people with talent in the
arts to apply to Stanford.
A special admissions program,
which has been in place for art and
music for several years and was last
year expanded to cover drama and
dance, is designed to keep a balance
between the arts and sciences at Stan
ford.
"People don't think of Stanford for
the humanities as much as they do for
things like engineering," said Sarah
Nelson, associate director of admis
sions.
Through the program, prospective
students can send tapes or
photographs of their work to be
evaluated by faculty members on a
scale of one (best) to six. Applicant in
terested in drama and music also nave
the option of auditioning. Recommen
dations only reach the applicant's file if
the prospective student is given a
rating of between one and three. "That
way, submitting material can only help
a student," said Nelson.
The program also hopes "to get
Stanford students thinking about the
fine arts," according to Nelson, who
said she would like the program to en
courage people to come here and
become involved inartistic endeavors
such as Gaieties.
The program is similar to sports
recruitment programs "in that it will
enrich the campus as a whole," said

Nelson, adding that the fine arts are
like athletics since both have a great
deal of value for non-participants.
The program does not necessarily
discover potential fine arts majors, ac
cording to Music Prof. Arthur Barnes.
"Some of our best performers are non
majors," he said. Faculty recommen
dations come into play when distin
guishing between two applicants who
are equally qualified academically, he
said. "We can't say, 'You play great, so
you can come to Stanford.' Many
people we think are great don't get ac
cepted." he said.
Faculty members evaluate material
on their own time, and the program's
major expense to date has been $8,000
provided by the Provost's Innovation
Fund to print and distribute informa
tional posters about the program, ac
cording to Nelson.
In the music program, 132 students
sent tapes in for evaluation, and 54
were admitted. In dance, 6 students ap
plied in the program, and four were
admitted. Sixty-four art portfolios were
sent in, and 17 students were admitted.
Ten students out of 19 who auditioned
(in New York, Chicago and Los An
geles) for the Drama Department, and
six of those enrolled.
Hope McCarthy, one of the six, said
the audition process got her "psyched"
for drama at Stanford. She said none of
the other schools to which she applied,
including Harvard, Yale, Brown and
UC-Berkeley had similar audition pro
grams which allowed applicants to
demonstrate artistic talent.
