# Survey stops Serra traffic
## 
### 
Motorists coming onto
campus via Serra Street yester
day may have found themselves
answering a few questions from
street-corner pollsters as part of
a University traffic study.
Stanford is conducting an
"origin and destination survey"
as a guide for campus expansion
planning, according to Campus
Planner Bob Segar. Pollsters will
be at various street corners near
main entrances to the campus
this week.
Segar would not say which
street corners will be surveyed
the rest of this week, fearing that
campus commuters might try to
save time by avoiding the poll
sters.
The study by Barton-Aschman
Associates, San Jose-based traffic
engineering consultants, will in
clude questionnaires placed on
car windshields later this quar
ter.
The survey is part of a new
campuswide traffic circulation
plan. The plan was last updated
in 1978.
