# Illegal raffle will reform
## 
### KACEY FITZPATRICK 
What began as a raffle for a package trip to the Coca-Cola
Bowl in Japan has been changed to a give-away of the same
trip, due to the illegality of raffles under California law.
The package trip, donated by the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation to the Class of 1987, features luxury accommodations
in Tokyo from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 and tickets to the Stanford-
Arizona game for a senior and one guest.
On Monday, raffle tickets for the trip went on sale at $1
each, and seniors could purchase as many as they wished.
But yesterday, Michael Ramsey-Perez, director of Student
Organization Services, called to attention the fact that raffles
are illegal under California state law.
Therefore, "We changed it to a give-away," according to
Senior Class President B.G. Porter. "Every senior is entitled
to one free ticket" for the drawing, and "we request a $1

contribution," he said.
"It's definitely going to be a fair drawing" due to the one
ticket limitation, Porter added.
According to Porter, the Alumni Association will incur
large loses on the giveaway. It had originally been hoped
that the raffle would cover most expenses of the trip.
The Senior Class Presidents are contacting all people who
have already bought raffle tickets in order to refund their
money, Porter said. Porter added that he hoped most stu
dents would make the $1 donation anyway on the one ticket
to which seniors are now entitled.
"We're still very excited about it," Porter said. "We just
want to work within the legal boundaries for the benefit of
the senior class and the Alumni Association."
Tickets for the drawing can be obtained daily from noon
to l, p.m. in White Plaza. The drawing will take place on
Friday, Nov. 7 at the Bowman Alumni House.
