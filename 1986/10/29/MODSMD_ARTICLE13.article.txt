Zeigler to retire as I-Center head
Lee Zeigler, director of the Bechtel International Center
at Stanford since 1971, plans to retire next spring.
During his directorship, foreign student enrollment at
Stanford has increased from 1,213 to 2,154. Foreign students
now account for 25 percent of all graduate students at the
University. Traugott, vice provost and dean of graduate
studies, told University News Service that Zeigler "has made
the center a home-away-from-home for international stu
dents and their families, and also a place for American stu
dents to find out about other countries and cultures."
Zeigler was elected president of the National Association
for Foreign Student Affairs in 1971 and president of the Na
tional Council for International Visitors in 1982.
He plans to continue as a consultant with the NAFSA, to
write, travel and do volunteer work following retirement.
Traugott has appointed a search committee for Zeigler's
successor, headed by Education Prof. Henry Levin.
Because the role of the International Center has changed
so substatially during the past 15 years, the search commit
tee has spent considerable time thinking about the respon
sibilities and qualifications for the next director, Traugott
said. Among the qualifications given high priority so far is
the abiltity to build ties to the various academic departments
at Stanford engaged in interantional studies, including the
Overseas Studies program, the Center for Research in Inter
national Studies and the new Institute for International
Studies.

Bay Bridge commutcrs have Hoover jto thank
For 50 years, San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge com
muters have benefited from President Herbert Hoover s
handiwork, according to Robert Hessen, senior research fel
low at the Hoover Institution.
In a newly issued commemorative essay on "Herbert
Hoover and the Bay Bridge," Hessen noted that Hoover
"characteristically stressed the role that others played in the
bridge's creation" when it opened Nov. 12, 1936.
Hoover especially praised the "engineers and workmen
right here who combined ... centuries of knowledge with
courage and imagination" in building the world's largest
bridge.
Hailed as the eight wonder of the world, the Bay Bridge
cost more than any other bridge ever built and had the
longest span over navigable water, and its foundations were
the deepest ever sunk, Hensen noted.
"If Herbert Hoover had not exerted his power as presi
dent on behalf of the bridge, it would not have been built
until many years later."
Leland Stanford, co-founder of the University, raised the
idea of a trans-bay bridge twice: in 1859, two years before he
was elected governor and 10 years after the first recorded
suggestion for the bridge was first made, and again in 1867,
four years after he left office.
Hoover began promoting the construction of the bridge
in 1922, Hensen related. In the years preceding the building
of the Bay Bridge, Hoover was the primary force in the drive
for the bridge.
