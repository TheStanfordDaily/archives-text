## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Prop. 63 not needed 
### 
Supporters of Proposition 63, the initiative that would
make English the official language of California, say it
simply formalizes what is reality.
To survive, to function, in mainstream American soci
ety, one must know English. To be an active citizen, to
exercise one's powers as a citizen, one must know En
glish. Language competency is one of the first prere
quisites for life in the United States.
But these facts are no reason to mandate English as the
official language. Proposition 63 is a would-be law that
does nothing constructive or beneficial for society while
stirring negative feelings and projecting an unfriendly
message: You can't speak English? You're not welcome
here.
The proposition ignores this significant fact: Immi
grants are flocking to English language classes by the
hundreds and finding that there aren't enough teachers
or resources to accommodate them all. According to a
recent article in The San Jose Mercury News, there is a
shortage of classes in the Bay Area for those who want to
learn English as a second language, and no improvement
of this debilitating situation is in sight. The need for En
glish classes is just as great, if not greater, in places such
as the Los Angeles area. The problem is statewide.
It also ignores potential legal problems. If English
becomes the official language, what is the legal status of
ethnic establishments that conduct their business in a

language other than English? Will the Chinese grocery in
San Francisco's Chinatown be shut down because all its
signs are in Chinese and the cashier and the stockboy
speak Chinese? Will public health clinics stop supplying
pamphlets printed in Spanish on nutrition, how to treat a
cold, the need for infant vaccination and other health is
sues? Will the courts stop offering the services of inter
preters to defendants and witnesses? How widely can En
glish as the official language be enforced?
The people who come to the United States, the ones
who speak Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Italian, Por
tuguese and dozens of other languages, want desperately
to learn English. They know that fluency will help them
get better jobs, enable them to work with their children's
teachers and help them gain access to many other
privileges. They do their best to learn the language of
their new home.
But Proposition 63 doesn't help the immigrants — the
newest Americans — learn English. Instead, it tells them
that they are unwelcome.
America is hailed as the melting pot — home of
diverse peoples and cultures and, therefore, diverse lan
guages. Rather than ignoring the American heritage,
Californians should affirm it by recognizing that America
is the land of diversity.
Proposition 63 is unnecessary, unfriendly and benefits
nobody.
