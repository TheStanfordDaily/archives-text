Manzanita offers
enjoyable housing
I would like to put in a qualified
good word for Manzanita Park in
response to The Daily's editorial (Oct.
20). The trailers were my home
during my first year at Stanford two
years ago. Only in Escondido Village
and Manzanita Park can a single
graduate student live something ap
proaching a normal adult life.
Escondido Village gives preference
to married students and those with
children and is quickly filled in the
graduate draw. After that, only in
Manzanita can a student have a
bedroom of his own, a kitchen (most
of us, in our advanced years, have
learned to cook) and a living room
where he can study and socialize
without disturbing his sleeping trailer
mates. This is why the trailers do fill
up every year
If the Daily editors feel that interac
tion between residents is "very low
and undeniably difficult," I can only
conclude they haven't visited the
trailers or ever heard of "Splendor on
the Grass." Socialization is easy, and
the trailers offer a couple of advan
tages: Many residents are graduate
students from other countries, enrich
ing the experience, and with a dining
room and a sizeable living room,
there is space to party. What is differ
ent in the trailers is the absence of the
sort of enforced socializing a student
encounters in the dorms, as he walks
down the hall past many open doors,
and his roommate chooses the night
before his qualifying exams to have
out-of-town visitors sleep over. I think
what the Daily editors call "low resi
dential interaction," I call privacy.
The current problem with the
heaters may reflect an unreasonable
attitude University housing had when
I was there. The administrators did
not want students to turn on their
own furnaces for safety reasons, but
they waited until well after the nights
got cool to do the task themselves.
Again, in March, after only two warm
days, the pilot lights were extin
guished. The trailers quickly reach the
outside temperature at night, and a
cold, sleepy student is sorely tempted
to light the furnace himself. I wonder
if University administrators honestly
did not feel it was necessary to

replace the furnaces until that cold
day in November they finally decided
heat is necessary for life. The Univer
sity, as the editorial states, handled
this problem in an inexcusably poor
manner.
The insects the editorial refers to
are ants. They are many — the an
teater is Manzanita's mascot — and
with a sense of humor, some ordinary
cleanliness and some help from
University maintenance, we dealt with
it.
As for the eyesore "problem," there
is the old saying about beauty being in
the eyes of the beholder. I always
thought some color could go a long
way, but the University seems to like
off-white trailers. Well, OK. (They do
look a lot better on the inside.) But
don't worry, oh editors of The Stan
ford Daily, they won't affect property
values around here.
So, let's hang on to Manzanita Park,
at least until adequate and suitable
permanent on-campus graduate
housing is in place and operating.
With a bit more cooperation from the
University (using some of that reve
nue Manzanita has been generating),
it is a viable and enjoyable place to
live.

Hamerton-Kelly
not hibernating
In his letter to the editor last week,
Emeritus Prof. Wilfred Stone charac
terized the ministry of former Dean of
the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly as
a period of "hibernation."
Some hibernation! It was 14 years
marked by a full slate of social actions
and services that included expanding
the Stanford Hospital chaplaincy and a
rich program in medical ethics; found
ing the Vietnamese Refugee Commit
tee; supporting constructive actions in
regional disputes, including Central
America and South Africa; supporting
hunger programs, both local and
national; organizing care for prisoners
and their families and shut-ins in the
local area; and helping organize
lecture and discussion series on arms
control that addressed ethical issues
of the nuclear age.
And who was not thrilled by the
sounds of the marvelous new Fisk

organ in the chapel without thanking
Bob Hamerton-Kelly for all his hard
work raising the funds to make it a
reality here at Stanford?
This year we enthusiastically
welcome Bob Hamerton-Kelly and his
new project on nuclear ethics at the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Arms Control.

Dr. Ruth has made no declaration of

Whether or not I take her seriously,
whether or not I attend her talk, I will
be surprised if Memorial Auditorium
is not filled on Nov. 10. If, as you say,
she's so popular, then why the beef?
Does it matter why I want to hear her?
Is my interest not enough? If you are
so worried about my education, con
sider it a supplement to my Western

Poor sports 'fix'
the Axe Plaque
I just noticed that Stanford has
re-engraved the Big Game Axe Plaque
so that the 1982 result is "Stanford,
20-19." This may seem humorous to
some, but to most people, it is
evidence of poor sportsmanship. Cal
won that game with "The Play" by the
score of 25-20.1 was there, and Ido
not think there was any doubt. A
thorough examination of the films by
the officials confirmed that Cal won
fair and square.
I spent a lot of time at Stanford
during graduate school, and I enjoyed
the high-quality, open-minded atmos
phere. Fraudulently changing the Big
Game score reflects very poorly on
what is otherwise a great university.

ent in the trailers is the absence of the
sort of enforced socializing a student
encounters in the dorms, as he walks
down the hall past many open doors,
and his roommate chooses the night
before his qualifying exams to have
out-of-town visitors sleep over. I think
what the Daily editors call "low resi
dential interaction," I call privacy.
The current problem with the
heaters may reflect an unreasonable
attitude University housing had when
I was there. The administrators did
not want students to turn on their
own furnaces for safety reasons, but
they waited until well after the nights
got cool to do the task themselves.
Again, in March, after only two warm
days, the pilot lights were extin
guished. The trailers quickly reach the
outside temperature at night, and a
cold, sleepy student is sorely tempted
to light the furnace himself. I wonder
if University administrators honestly
did not feel it was necessary to

replace the furnaces until that cold
day in November they finally decided
heat is necessary for life. The Univer
sity, as the editorial states, handled
this problem in an inexcusably poor
manner.
The insects the editorial refers to
are ants. They are many — the an
teater is Manzanita's mascot — and
with a sense of humor, some ordinary
cleanliness and some help from
University maintenance, we dealt with
it.
As for the eyesore "problem," there
is the old saying about beauty being in
the eyes of the beholder. I always
thought some color could go a long
way, but the University seems to like
off-white trailers. Well, OK. (They do
look a lot better on the inside.) But
don't worry, oh editors of The Stan
ford Daily, they won't affect property
values around here.
So, let's hang on to Manzanita Park,
at least until adequate and suitable
permanent on-campus graduate
housing is in place and operating.
With a bit more cooperation from the
University (using some of that reve
nue Manzanita has been generating),
it is a viable and enjoyable place to
live.

Hamerton-Kelly
not hibernating
In his letter to the editor last week,
Emeritus Prof. Wilfred Stone charac
terized the ministry of former Dean of
the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly as
a period of "hibernation."
Some hibernation! It was 14 years
marked by a full slate of social actions
and services that included expanding
the Stanford Hospital chaplaincy and a
rich program in medical ethics; found
ing the Vietnamese Refugee Commit
tee; supporting constructive actions in
regional disputes, including Central
America and South Africa; supporting
hunger programs, both local and
national; organizing care for prisoners
and their families and shut-ins in the
local area; and helping organize
lecture and discussion series on arms
control that addressed ethical issues
of the nuclear age.
And who was not thrilled by the
sounds of the marvelous new Fisk

organ in the chapel without thanking
Bob Hamerton-Kelly for all his hard
work raising the funds to make it a
reality here at Stanford?
This year we enthusiastically
welcome Bob Hamerton-Kelly and his
new project on nuclear ethics at the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Arms Control.

Dr. Ruth will be
good, clean fun
Dr. Ruth has made no declaration of
intellectualism. She's pop entertain
ment, and like the best Daily
editorials, she does well to amuse us.
Whether or not I take her seriously,
whether or not I attend her talk, I will
be surprised if Memorial Auditorium
is not filled on Nov. 10. If, as you say,
she's so popular, then why the beef?
Does it matter why I want to hear her?
Is my interest not enough? If you are
so worried about my education, con
sider it a supplement to my Western
Culture lecture.

Poor sports 'fix'
the Axe Plaque
I just noticed that Stanford has
re-engraved the Big Game Axe Plaque
so that the 1982 result is "Stanford,
20-19." This may seem humorous to
some, but to most people, it is
evidence of poor sportsmanship. Cal
won that game with "The Play" by the
score of 25-20.1 was there, and Ido
not think there was any doubt. A
thorough examination of the films by
the officials confirmed that Cal won
fair and square.
I spent a lot of time at Stanford
during graduate school, and I enjoyed
the high-quality, open-minded atmos
phere. Fraudulently changing the Big
Game score reflects very poorly on
what is otherwise a great university.

Manzanita offers
enjoyable housing
I would like to put in a qualified
good word for Manzanita Park in
response to The Daily's editorial (Oct.
20). The trailers were my home
during my first year at Stanford two
years ago. Only in Escondido Village
and Manzanita Park can a single
graduate student live something ap
proaching a normal adult life.
Escondido Village gives preference
to married students and those with
children and is quickly filled in the
graduate draw. After that, only in
Manzanita can a student have a
bedroom of his own, a kitchen (most
of us, in our advanced years, have
learned to cook) and a living room
where he can study and socialize
without disturbing his sleeping trailer
mates. This is why the trailers do fill
up every year
If the Daily editors feel that interac
tion between residents is "very low
and undeniably difficult," I can only
conclude they haven't visited the
trailers or ever heard of "Splendor on
the Grass." Socialization is easy, and
the trailers offer a couple of advan
tages: Many residents are graduate
students from other countries, enrich
ing the experience, and with a dining
room and a sizeable living room,
there is space to party. What is differ
ent in the trailers is the absence of the
sort of enforced socializing a student
encounters in the dorms, as he walks
down the hall past many open doors,
and his roommate chooses the night
before his qualifying exams to have
out-of-town visitors sleep over. I think
what the Daily editors call "low resi
dential interaction," I call privacy.
