# A 						tribute to ex-Dean Hamerton-Kelly
## 
### 
We the undersigned have written this letter as a
response to the letter to the editor from Emeritus
Prof. Wilfred Stone (Daily, Oct. 17). Prof. Stone used
a very public forum to vent an attack by innuendo on
the ministry of former Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly. We feel that the statements he made

GIRARD ET AL.

are inaccurate, and we want to salute publicly the
work of Bob Hamerton-Kelly.
Therefore, we want the following, very limited list
to speak for itself.
• The Vietnamese Refugee Committee was founded
and chaired by the former dean in 1975. This com
mittee was responsible for the local and national
resettlement of refugees. It also set up a library at the
refugee center at Camp Pendleton.
• He has been a strong supporter and promoter of
the Holt International Agency, and through Holt, the
Hamerton-Kellys adopted a 4-year-old frightened
child from the war-torn streets of Saigon.
• It was through meetings arranged by Memorial
Church around the visit of Kenneth Carsten, the
director of the Southern African Defence and Aid
Fund, that a viable coalition, including SOSA
(Stanford Out of South Africa), SCAAN (Stanford
Central American Action Network) and the Black Stu
dent Union, was formed.

• He brought in visiting preachers, such as William
Sloan Coffin and Robert MacAfee Brown. The Rev.
Brown led a weekend student retreat two years ago
to look at ways of responding to social issues.
• Baccalaureate speakers invited by the former dean
included Rosemary Ruether, Davie Napier and Arch
bishop Weakland, who represented controversial
points of view.
• Among the many charities, etc., supported by spe
cial collections have been: the Ecumenical Hunger
Project; the Palo Alto Urban Ministries, which serves
the street people; the Gertrude Wilkes Academy in
East Palo Alto; Covenant House in New York City,
which works with teenage runaways; and Friendly
Visiting Service, which brings companionship to
shut-ins.
• The current Stanford Hospital Chaplaincy, and all
that grew out of it, such as the Pastoral Training and
the Medical Ethics Programs, were initiated under
the former dean.
• In the sermon given by Acting Dean Ambrogi
referenced by Prof. Stone, one fact was omitted In
citing examples of public service done by Stanford
students this past summer, no mention was made
that many students used grants provided by the Sum
mer Scholarship Fund established in 1983 by the
Friends of Memorial Church in honor of Hamerton-
Kelly's 10th Anniversary as dean.
Bob Hamerton-Kelly's body of work as dean
represented a true journey of faith, and we feel that

we were pilgrims with him as we explored our own
Biblical beliefs. Never once have we experienced ex
amples of "unctuous piety." His God-centered faith
was never in doubt, no matter how one wanted to
come back to a humanistic secularism. This constant
reminder of our frailty can be very threatening, and
the dean has on occasion made people uncomfort
able with his clarity, brilliance and ever-growing un
derstanding of the human condition.
Social action has not been resurrected at Memorial
Church. All those who have been actively involved
either through steady attendance at services, mem
bership in the Faculty Bible Study group or teaching
collaborations, are delighted to have this chance to
bring before this community what has not been
heralded on banners, but has been accomplished in
a quiet, effective and not self-serving manner.
Last spring quarter, Memorial Church, the United
Campus Ministries and the Center for International
Security and Arms Control sponsored a Sunday
morning series that was attended by more than 150
people each week. The topic was "Who is the
enemy?"
This was the type of ministry Bob Kelly
represented; we hope that the future of Memorial
Church builds on its illustrious past.
