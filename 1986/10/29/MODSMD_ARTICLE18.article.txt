# Don lags in divestment run
## 
### 
"Over here," the bass voice boomed. It was 6:20 a.m. and
I had been knocking on University President Donald Ken
nedy's front door for half an hour. "You were confused," he
continued. "Were you looking for the beginning of the
run?"
Indeed I was. President Kennedy and I share different
views on divestment — I believe in total divestment while
he does not. I had decided to take advantage of his standing
offer to run with students and to discuss this issue during
our run; specifically, why Stanford refuses to divest itself
fully of companies that conduct business in South Africa.

President Kennedy is in good shape and runs well. I had
heard about how quickly he jogs and was worried about
being able to keep up with him. I felt a bit intimidated.
Words stuck in my throat as thoughts raced through my
head. Why am I doing this? How important is it that I ask
him about the issue? What if I run with him this time and
discuss divestment next time?
Luckily for me, the conversation turned to his five-day trip
to South Africa in August. I gathered up my courage,
swallowed hard and asked if he had seen anything to change
his mind about the divestment issue. He answered that he
had not and the discussion was on. We talked about many
aspects of the issue. He mentioned that he had talked to
members of the Progressive Federal Party (PFP), a white op
-1 position group, and that these talks had helped to tighten
his already strong convictions on the issue. The PFP is the le
gal parliamentary opposition, and is therefore bound by law
not to support disinvestment or sanctions. Moreover, the
PFP represents the white business community, which is the
first to suffer from sanctions and which makes it doubly
unlikely for any PFP official to support sanctions.
He brought up the Sullivan Principles as a valid criterion
for continued investment. I said that the Sullivan Principles
only affect 27,437 people while apartheid affects close to 30
million, and thus they would not seem to be efficacious cri
teria in terms of widespread impact on South Africans'
lives. We started to work harder and continued to run.
The further we ran the better I began to feel. I was
keeping up fine with Kennedy, and he was actually breathing
harder than I. Even though he is an intelligent man and
speaks articulately (even at 6:30 in the morning while run
ning the Dish), his reasoning was not impeccable. This was
evidenced by his statements that Stanford's behavior toward
South Africa is reformist, that it belongs to the near left on
the political spectrum and that a request for total divestment
should be categorized as fitting into the far left or radical
part of the spectrum.
He said this despite the fact that Northeastern and Har
vard Universities (hardly bastions of liberalism) have both
significantly divested themselves of business in South Africa
and despite the fact that the State of California — which
voted for Reagan the past two elections, which has a Repub
lican Governor and whose political orientation can hardly
be labeled as "radical" — has voted to divest itself of more
than $3 billion from South Africa. Such facts would seem to
contradict Kennedy's statements.

Kennedy had no solid response for some of the questions
I asked. For example, I asked him what effect the Committee
on Investment Responbility's (ClR's) new report had on his
thinking. In this report the CIR maintains that companies
play a net negative role in South Africa. The importance of
the report increases when one understands that the new po
sition represents a major shift from the committee's posi
tion of 1977-85, during which time it maintained that com
panies could play a net positive role in South Africa. His
response was to say that "some people say just about any
thing."
Up to this point the tone of our debate had been relatively
calm. It heated up as we headed down the back part of the
Dish. When Kennedy said that each institution must come to
its own decision about divestment, I responded by suggest
ing that he was ignoring what the other institutions had
done. His face turned very red, stress lines creased his
forehead, and he started to yell. "No, I'm not ignoring.
There's a difference between ignoring, not listening, and
hearing the same old argument for the 40th time and fin
ding it unconvincing!" He ran faster down the hill.
I suggested that, with all respect, the strength of his con
victions before his trip to South Africa may have influenced
his conclusions, and the fact that the head of Hewlett-
Packard, a company in which Stanford holds $25 million of
stock and that is heavily involved in South Africa, is a mem
ber of the Board of Trustees may have some influence on
how he views the issue. "Let me give you a piece of friendly
advice," he replied. "Insulting people's objectivity is not de
signed to win their hearts and minds."
"I wasn't trying to do that."
He exploded. "Then what were you trying to do? Listen,
sonny, you're pretty young. When you make ad hominem at
tacks on people you leave the realm of rational discourse!"
It was not until later I thought that by hollering, referring
to my age and calling me "sonny," Donald Kennedy had
himself left the realm of rational discourse. At the time I
thought that at that moment he was not simply yelling at me,
he was yelling about all the meetings he had attended, at all
the people he had seen, at all the criticism he had weath
ered. He was yelling and wishing it would all go away and
leave him alone. For that brief period of time he was not the
president of Stanford University but a harried man running
the Dish who wanted to be left alone.
I felt a bit uncomfortable at the situation, yet at the same
time I feel a deeper sense of satisfaction because on some
level the collective pressure got to him, because Donald
Kennedy was receiving the message that he is going to hear
about divestment until Stanford does fully divest, and be
cause, on some level, the protest movement is working.
Kennedy may publicly maintain that student pressure has
nothing to do with whether Stanford divests or not. At the
same time I am skeptical of the proposition that Stanford
would have spontaneously divested itself of Schlumberger
and Grey without pressure from many people and on many
levels.
He regained his composure as we finished our run. We
talked about further aspects of divestment as he stepped
back into his role of president. I could feel him try to
reassert his authority and to re-establish the terms of debate
as he told me: "I do more good when I'm on the edge, and
it's your job to keep me on the edge." I reject that definition
of "my job," rather it is his job on this issue to do all that he
possibly can to convince the trustees to divest totally.
