# Kennedy discusses issues
## Reports to ASSU on divestment and ethnic studies 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
During a meeting with the ASSU Senate last night, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy said that the recent decisions
by several U.S. corporations, including General Motors and
IBM, to disinvest from their South Africa divisions will not
significantly affect the University's policy on divestment.
Kennedy also discussed the viability of an ethnic studies
program and a community service board at the University.
After Kennedy spoke, the senate reconsidered the recom
mendations of the Nominations Commission for positions
on the Western Culture Task Force after the Black Student
Union (BSU) and other minority organizations protested
the absence of minority representation in the selections.
According to Kennedy, the disinvestment actions by Gen
eral Motors and IBM followed extensive discussions be
tween the corporations and large non-profit organizations,
including Stanford, which hold stock in the companies.
Both GM and IBM reached their decisions after recognizing
their responsibilities to their stockholders, employees and
customers, Kennedy said.
It was not the desire to make a moral statement, but a
transition from "equity to debt" that primarily led the com
panies to disinvest, Kennedy said. He added that this recent
barrage of disinvestment action may in the long run damage
the welfare of black South Africans .
IBM and GM were among the best examples of compan
ies showing social responsibility in South Africa, according
to Kennedy. The effect of these withdrawals has only hard
ened the line pursued by the South African government and
the companies filling the market void will have less concern
about constructing a post-apartheid society, he said.
GM and IBM supported such welfare concerns as commu
nity health plans and minority housing "out of all propor
tion" to their business commitments in the region, he

added.
In response to charges that the University is not meeting
the demand of minorities for an ethnic studies program,
Kennedy said that the impetus for new programs comes
from undergraduate departments and not University
directives.
According to Kennedy, the problem with ethnic studies
programs in the past has been a lack of faculty support.
Minority professors qualified to teach in an ethnic studies
program are not interested in the courses, Kennedy said.
"We need to develop a strong cadre of faculty interest,"
he said.
Kennedy noted that there currently is a shortage of
minority students in doctoral programs.
During the next few years, Stanford is preparing for sig
nificant demographic transitions as the professors hired
during the years of expansion in the '50s and '60s are about
to retire, according to Kennedy. The University would like
to increase the representation of minority professors during
this period and is currently promoting doctoral programs
that will increase the number of minorities eligible for
tenure-track positions, he said.
In discussing the proposed community service board,
Kennedy said he strongly "supports any venture which
bears that label." The idea of the board, however, caused
him one significant reservation.
He said he feared an ASSU community service board
might become synonymous with the idea of community ser
vice within the University and discourage unrelated public
service efforts by undergraduates. A monetary grant from
the board should not be equated with community service,
he said.
The proposed board should be one of many channels
through which students can aid those who need their help,

University President Donald Kennedy appeared at the ASSU meeting last night to review his stand on divestment
and a variety of other topics. When questioned about the South Africa situation, Kennedy said that Stanford had
played something of a causal role in the recent disinvestment decisions by IBM and General Motors. Kennedy also
addressed the need for a multi-faceted program of community service in the Stanford area.
Kennedy added.
In other business, the senate closed
its doors to the press and other visitors
in order to respond to a protest by the

BSU that black students should be
represented on the Western Culture
Task Force.
Earlier in the meeting, the Nomina
tions Commission had recommended
two students, both white, to the task
force. The senate confirmed one
nominee, Jay Gilbert, to a representa
tive position and decided to discuss

the other available spot on Friday in a
special closed session. Gilbert, a white
male, helped to arrange a Western Cul
ture forum this fall.

University President Donald Kennedy appeared at the ASSU meeting last night to review his stand on divestment
and a variety of other topics. When questioned about the South Africa situation, Kennedy said that Stanford had
played something of a causal role in the recent disinvestment decisions by IBM and General Motors. Kennedy also
addressed the need for a multi-faceted program of community service in the Stanford area.
Kennedy added.
In other business, the senate closed
its doors to the press and other visitors
in order to respond to a protest by the

BSU that black students should be
represented on the Western Culture
Task Force.
Earlier in the meeting, the Nomina
tions Commission had recommended
two students, both white, to the task
force. The senate confirmed one
nominee, Jay Gilbert, to a representa
tive position and decided to discuss

the other available spot on Friday in a
special closed session. Gilbert, a white
male, helped to arrange a Western Cul
ture forum this fall.
In challenging the recommen
dations of the Nominations Commis
sion, BSU Chair Amanda Kemp said
that the task force idea originated from
the struggles and concerns of the BSU.
