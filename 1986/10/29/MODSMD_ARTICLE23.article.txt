## Editor's retirement finally goes to Press Ends 20-year Observer stint 
### SEAN KINCH 
"I'm 67 years old now — it is time to
slow down and have more time to play
tennis," muses Harry Press.
The founding editor of The Stanford
Observer and its guiding hand for the
last 20 years, Press has decided to
retire and enjoy a change of pace.
He is not retiring from Stanford
completely, however. He will continue
to work as managing director of the
Knight Professional Journalism Fellow
ships program, a position he has held
since 1967. He will also continue to
write sports and feature articles for
The Observer.
It has been hard work to fill the re
sponsibilities of the two positions he
has held, but Press does not view it as
wasted effort.
Rather, he feels that his tasks stim
ulated him to produce quality results.
"When you are challenged, you tend
to do your best work," he says.
Press' journalistic roots at Stanford
go back to his days as an undergradu
ate, when he was managing editor of
The Daily before graduating in 1939.
After working as a newspaperman in
the San Francisco area for 25 years, he
was asked to return to the Farm to start
up The Observer in 1966.
"The initial goal of the paper," he
says, "was to provide the Stanford fam
ily off campus — the ones who keep
the school going — with the full infor
mation of the people, ideas and re
search here."
Press has always enjoyed working at
Stanford.
"This is an exciting place and the
people here are all articulate," he says.
"There are endless stories around
here."
Even though it was created by the
public information department of Stan
ford, The Observer was never in
tended as simply a public relations
tool. From the beginning, Press was
given the freedom to print exactly what
went on at Stanford.
Even during the '60s, when there
was so much turbulence on campus,
The Observer was able to report the
news without any interference from
the University president or the Board
of Trustees, Press says.
The quality of the publication itself
has been positively affected by the
freedom, Press says, explaining that
"because of the independence, the
editor works 10 times as hard to get it

right, because it is his responsibility to
get it right."
The ability to report the whole truth
about Stanford has also helped The
Observer give its readers a positive
feeling about the University.
"I'm writing for the people off
campus and simply by reporting it (the
news of Stanford), they are going to
feel good about it," Press says."I don't
have to gloss it up."
Since its inception The Observer has
grown into the most widely circulated
university newspaper in the country.
Press feels that he was successful in
developing a paper that was factual, in
dependent and enjoyable to read, but

he is quick to add that he could not
have done it without a lot of help. He
gives credit especially to Bob Beyers,
the director of University News Ser
vice, for giving him the support and in
dependence he needed to develop
The Observer into a respectable news
paper.
With his newly acquired leisure
time, Press plans to slow down a little
and savor life.
"I want to achieve a balance be
tween personal enjoyment and
working," he says."I want to continue
to work as long as Stanford wants me
here. I can't think of a nicer place to
live."

Harry PresS, Class of '39 and the founding editor of The Stanford Observer,
is trading his typewriter for a tennis racket and looking to relax a little after
an undergraduate stint with The Daily, 25 years working for San Francisco
area papers and a 20-year stand as the guiding force behind The Observer.
