You've heard of electronic
banking and electronic music. Now
there's electronic Bug Me. As
promised weeks ago, it is now easier
than ever to hug The Bug, thanks to
the helpful folks at LOTS.
I can now receive your questions
via electronic mail on LOTS. All you
need to do is address your questions
to "Bug-Me" — don't forget the hyp
hen in between the words or it won't
work — and I will respond.
As always, unless you give your
name I will provide a suitable pseu
donym.
This is just another of the high-tech
services of the Daily — where the elite
meet the pica.
Dear Bug Me,
I've heardfrom older alums about
the various stunts of the legendary
Doodles Weaver. For instance, there
was the time when the University un
veiled a statue and there was
Doodles sitting on it with a beer in
his hand. Could you please dig up
some of these old tales and print
them? Also, is there any relation to
Sigourney Weaver?
— Curious
Doodles Weaver was one of the
truly great Stanford pranksters.
However, due to his renown many of
the stories about his antics have
been exaggerated.
Let's start with the facts:
Winstead Sheffield Weaver
graduated from Stanford in 1937
with a degree in philosophy. He got
his nickname because, although he
later developed into quite an enter
taining singer, his kindergarten
repertoire consisted of only "Yankee
Doodle" and "Yankee Doodle
Dandy."
After five years at Stanford,
Doodles went on to become quite
successful in the entertainment in
dustry. He was a member of the
Spike Jones Orchestra and appeared
in more than 150 feature films and
countless television episodes.
He also distinguished himself as a
yell leader at football games in the
'60s, donning a coonskin coat.
Frederic Glover, retired executive
assistant to the University president,
is the resident expert on Doodles.
Glover was in charge of fraternity
rush for the Delts when he first en
countered Doodles. Although
Doodles eventually became a Beta,
Glover recalls that "when you
rushed Doodles, he rushed you."

Glover can personally attest to the
veracity of the following stories
about Doodles:
• As a Beta, Doodles leaned out of a
bay window at his fraternity house at
high noon wearing a blond wig, bra
and panties yelling "Help" and "I'm
being attacked."
• One of Doodles' friends who was
to attend Stanford with him died the
summer before he was to enroll.
Doodles was determined that his
friend would make it to Stanford and

introduced the ghost of his friend to
then-University President Wilbur.
• Doodles loved cars. In fact, he had
one with a tank mounted behind the
driver's seat that was filled with beer.
Tubes connected to the tank enabled
the driver and passenger to drink
while riding. Steering was no prob
lem as Doodles had it rigged so that
he could steer with his feet. Then,
Glover said, Doodles would drive
past the old Kappa house and throw
the steering wheel out on the lawn.
• One year, a storm caused a black
out during Big Game Gaieties.
Doodles entertained the audience
until the lights went on by playing
the piano and singing in the dark
ened auditorium.

Many of the traditional stories
about Doodles, including the one
about the unveiling of the statue, are
unsubstantiated but equally interest
ing:
• Doodles was supposed to have dis
mantled a Model A Ford and reas
sembled it at the top of Hoover
Tower. Hoover Tower, however,
wasn't dedicated until 1941, four
years after Doodles graduated.
• Categorically denied by Doodles in
interviews was the story (faindy rem-

iniscent of "Animal House") about
how he purchased a horse from a
glue factory, took it to the second
floor of Encina Hall and shot it.
•At graduation, Doodles was
supposed to have rollerskated across
the platform to receive his diploma.
I've been unable to determine
whether this is true.
• Stories have also been told that
Doodles had an autographed picture
of Jesus Christ. This is also unsub
stantiated.
As for whether or not Sigourney is
related, the answer is yes. I spoke
with her agent, Heidi Shaeffer, who
found out that Doodles was Sigour

ney's uncle.
"And Sigourney says 'Hi!' " Shaeffer
added.
Sigourney, incidentally, was also a
student here. In addition to some in
volvement in drama and the Chap
paral, she was something of an activist,
reputedly appearing in an anti-ROTC
play called "Alice in ROTC-land."
Dear Bug Me,
What is the white foam that has been
collecting on the pools to the north of
the Dumbarton Bridge on our side of
the bay? / started seeing it last spring. /
haven't noticed it much lately, but
wheti it was really heaty, big mounds
of frothy foam would collect on the
water's edge and blow across the
bridge. Does this have anything to do
with tlx.' oil spill there many moons ago
or is it something normal?
— Blinded by the Foam
Prof. James Ingle, chairman of the
Geology Department, says that this is
merely normal "sea foam."
In the spring, an abundance of
phytoplankton (or simply "floating
plants") are in the bay. When large
storms occur, as they did last spring,
this organic matter is agitated and
produces large, frothv balls of foam

Ingle likens this phenomenon to the
agitation of soapy water that, because
the soap is organic, produces bubbles.
An oil spill, on the other hand,
would yield just an oily film on the
water.
Thus, we may conclude, Mr. Hubble
does exist in nature.
Dear Bug Me,
Why won 't the University dean out
all spigots on the Hoop fountain so
that tlx.- water will fall properly ? Is this
an especially expensive or time- con
suming task?
— Thirsty
Thanks to you, the University now
knows about the problem and will
have it fixed.
Ralph Buchanan, the director of
Operations and Maintenance, was un
aware that about one-third of the water
jets on the Shumway Fountain (more
commonly known as "the Hoop")
were clogged. He has a special interest
in that fountain because it was out of
commission much of last spring while
it was being rustproofed. You may
recall that my predecessor delved into
this subject, discovering that several
hundred golf tees were being used to
plug up the jets while the fountain was
out of commission.
A work order has been submitted
and you'll be fountain-hopping again
in no time.
