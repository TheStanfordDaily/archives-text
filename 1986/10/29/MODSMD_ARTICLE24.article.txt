donym.
This is just another of the high-tech

Dear Bug Me,
I've heardfrom older alums about
the various stunts of the legendary
Doodles Weaver. For instance, there
was the time when the University un
veiled a statue and there was
Doodles sitting on it with a beer in
his hand. Could you please dig up
some of these old tales and print
them? Also, is there any relation to
Sigourney Weaver?
— Curious
Doodles Weaver was one of the
truly great Stanford pranksters.
However, due to his renown many of
the stories about his antics have
been exaggerated.
Let's start with the facts:
Winstead Sheffield Weaver
graduated from Stanford in 1937
with a degree in philosophy. He got
his nickname because, although he
later developed into quite an enter
taining singer, his kindergarten
repertoire consisted of only "Yankee
Doodle" and "Yankee Doodle
Dandy."
After five years at Stanford,
Doodles went on to become quite
successful in the entertainment in
dustry. He was a member of the
Spike Jones Orchestra and appeared
in more than 150 feature films and
countless television episodes.
He also distinguished himself as a
yell leader at football games in the
'60s, donning a coonskin coat.
Frederic Glover, retired executive
assistant to the University president,
is the resident expert on Doodles.
Glover was in charge of fraternity
rush for the Delts when he first en
countered Doodles. Although
Doodles eventually became a Beta,
Glover recalls that "when you
rushed Doodles, he rushed you."

Glover can personally attest to the
veracity of the following stories
about Doodles:
• As a Beta, Doodles leaned out of a
bay window at his fraternity house at
high noon wearing a blond wig, bra
and panties yelling "Help" and "I'm
being attacked."
• One of Doodles' friends who was
to attend Stanford with him died the
summer before he was to enroll.
Doodles was determined that his
friend would make it to Stanford and

introduced the ghost of his friend to
then-University President Wilbur.
• Doodles loved cars. In fact, he had
one with a tank mounted behind the
driver's seat that was filled with beer.
Tubes connected to the tank enabled
the driver and passenger to drink
while riding. Steering was no prob
lem as Doodles had it rigged so that
he could steer with his feet. Then,
Glover said, Doodles would drive
past the old Kappa house and throw
the steering wheel out on the lawn.
• One year, a storm caused a black
out during Big Game Gaieties.
Doodles entertained the audience
until the lights went on by playing
the piano and singing in the dark
ened auditorium.

Many of the traditional stories
about Doodles, including the one
about the unveiling of the statue, are
unsubstantiated but equally interest
ing:
• Doodles was supposed to have dis
mantled a Model A Ford and reas
sembled it at the top of Hoover
Tower. Hoover Tower, however,
wasn't dedicated until 1941, four
years after Doodles graduated.
• Categorically denied by Doodles in
interviews was the story (faindy rem-

iniscent of "Animal House") about
how he purchased a horse from a
glue factory, took it to the second
floor of Encina Hall and shot it.
•At graduation, Doodles was
supposed to have rollerskated across
the platform to receive his diploma.
I've been unable to determine
whether this is true.
• Stories have also been told that
Doodles had an autographed picture
of Jesus Christ. This is also unsub
stantiated.
As for whether or not Sigourney is
related, the answer is yes. I spoke
with her agent, Heidi Shaeffer, who
found out that Doodles was Sigour
