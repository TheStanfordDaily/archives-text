The Women's Center.
The what?
The Stanford Women's Center. You
know, the one located in the Toyon
eating clubs.
You mean you don't know all
about it?
Well, the people at the Women's
Center are out to change that.
They are starting with an extensive
speaker series that began last
Thursday.
The series is called "Women in
Motion: Competition, Expression, Fit
ness. Among the speakers will be a
basketball coach, health promotion
specialist, nutritionist, dance instruc
tor, health care center instructor and
two sports sociologists.
They are all women.
The presentations will take place

'No matter how many or how few
women come to the center for aid, it
needs to be there. There needs to be a
place where women can come for an
integrated source of referrals, help or
advice.'

in the Women's Center at 7:30 p.m.
on Thursday nights, said Merielle
Flood, Woman's Center coordinator.
The talks will be followed by
question-and-answer sessions and a
reception with refreshments.
In addition to the speaker series,
the Women's Center is planning a
forum with campus sorority leaders
as well as a concert featuring a band
consisting of minorities and women.
With these activities, Flood said,
the Women's Center is "trying to
draw in people who would not other
wise be interested in the center."
Senior Millicent Bogert, a staffer
for three years, explained the reason
ing behind the center.

"No matter how many or how few
women come to the center for aid, it
needs to be there," Bogert said.
There needs to be a place where
women can come for an integrated
source of referrals, help or advice."
The referral service performed by
the center is an extensive one.
The center interacts heavily with
the Institute for Research on Women
and Gender, the Volunteer Center
and the Graduate Women's Network.
In addition, the center provides
housing or assistance (or both) for
Stanford United for Rape Elimination
(SURE), the Rape Education Project
(REP), SWOPSI self-defense classes
and the Women's Center Collective.
The collective is a core group of
people who maintain the center and
work together to make most of the
decisions affecting the center, ac
cording to Flood.
"I'm the only salaried worker in

the center, but the collective is really
the thing that makes the center
work," she said.
Senior Julie Ann Yuen, a feminist
studies major and member of the col
lective, said that the group manage
ment aspect of the center is part of
what attracted her.
"I like the process of running it
(the center) â€” it's group manage
ment, so there's not really anybody in
charge," she explained.
Although the Women's Center is
primarily for undergraduates, it
welcomes men and women from
graduate schools and the surround
ing community.
"As well as myself and the other

women who help out, we have
several men who are very active in
the center. We also proudly support a
lesbian rap group which consists of
women from Palo Alto and students
who are both undergraduates and
graduates," said Flood.
The hard work and organization of
the Women's Center is all for a pur
pose, according to Yuen.
"There are issues that pertain to
women specifically that aren't usually
covered in discussions or classes,'
she said.

But what about the sexual revolu
tion and the gains for women and so
ciety as a whole over the last 20 or so
years?
"The sexual revolution is a myth,"
Yuen declared. "Society still has a
long way to go."
Bogert agreed. "The issues are the
same as they were in the '60s, they
just have lost some of their popular
appeal. Things are still stacked
against women," she said.
Yuen insisted that the center is ne

cessarv because women need a place
where they can he something oilier
than "just one of the guys."
Women have certain needs and
concerns that are different," she ex
plained.
The similar and strong sentiments
of the other workers at the center are
providing the center with an exciting
nature it has never had before.
Yuen, who has worked at the cen
ter for two years, said, "It (the
Women's Center) has improved since
1 started working here, it also has a

lot of potential growth ahead of it."
The volunteers who work with the
Women's Center are working to
realize that potential.
In addition to the activities
planned for this quarter, the center is
already working to arrange confer
ences, forums and speaker series for
winter and spring quarters.
Hopefully, by the end of the year
significantly fewer people will look
puzzled and confused when the Stan
ford Women's Center is mentioned.
