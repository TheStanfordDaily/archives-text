## Calendar generates experience, controversy 
### STEVEN LURIE Editorial staff 
There are several items that are a
mast for the typical college student: a
phone, a mailbox (that is never full
enough), and posters on the wall. And
a calendar.
"Calendars of all types are pretty big
business at college bookstores around
the country," comments a buyer for
the Stanford Bookstore.
Indeed, walking into the Stanford
Bookstore, one is confronted by a ple
thora of calendars. There are cutesy
kitten calendars on the shelf next to
calendars full of sweaty, half-naked
men. One can also be exposed to a dif
ferent eccentric Far Side cartoon each
month or to spectacular scenes of
Yosemite.
One calendar this year, however, has
emerged from this assortment as a cen
ter of controversy. The "Women of

Stanford" calendar, featuring 12 under
graduates, has aroused comment from
various sectors of the Stanford commu
nity. Feminist groups find the item
degrading and offensive to women.
Other students merely view the calen
dar as an innocuous way to make some
money.
The story of the making of the
"Women of Stanford" calendar has
been buried amidst the controversy.
Last winter quarter, juniors John
Forster and Linda Dodge and several
other students formed Cardinal
Women Enterprises (CWE), the organi

zation that developed the calendar.
The idea was orginally to start a
money making project" said Forster,
the sales manager.
The group examined similar calen
dars from other schools and decided
to go ahead with the project. "The Uni
versity of Southern California (USC)
calendar that we looked at was not so
great but still made a lot of money. We
realized then that we could do a better
job — that is, have classy non-bathing
suit shots — and still be profitable."
Dodge, the executive producer, said
the group was aware of the possibil
ity of controversy, but "we knew we
would make a classy and legitimate
calendar and thus we were not overly
concerned about controversy."
Finances presented the major prob
lem. Said Forster: "Printing costs were
much, much more than we had an
ticipated." Originally, Dodge was to
provide the sole financial support.

However, since actual costs were more
than double anticipated costs, CWE
decided to sell advertisements to make
up this cost difference.
"Response from sponsors was very
positive" said Forster. Indeed, the capi
tal raised from ads comprised more
than 60 percent of the actual costs and
even exceeded what the group had an
ticipated for the entire project. A
glossy, full-page ad for Stanford BMW
in Palo Alto occupies the hack of the
calendar. Space underneath each
monthly calendar is filled by sponsors
ranging from Video Express to Hyatt

Hotels to the Los Altos Athletic Club.
Most people who buy the calendar
will probably remember less about the
advertisements and more about the 12
undergraduate women who are
featured for each month. The selection
of the women was primarily conducted
in private by the producers and not
through public advertisements or con
tests. That is, they asked people around
them for their opinions about who
might look good in the calendar. Fif
teen women were approached and
three declined for personal reasons.
Of the 12 featured women, several
are studying abroad this quarter,
others declined to comment, and some
explained their presence in the cal
endar on condition of anonymity.
"When they first asked me and I
realized that they were serious, I was
son of flattered at the whole thing
said one. "I talked a lot with my par
ents about the decision. Though 1 saw
no enlightening reason to do it, I also
saw no real reasons not to. I viewed it
all as fairly innocent and not blatantly
wrong. I never meant to intentionally
hurt anyone.
"I was told that the pictures would
not only feature us but also scenes of
Stanford," she continued. "I would
have been happier if this had been the
case. They also told me that I would be
able to choose the picture of me that
would be printed and I agreed because
I did not want it to be an exploitative
shot. I did not get to choose my picture
though. Finally, I didn't anticipate or
want the controversy. At other schools,
it's a much bigger deal. Girls compete
to be in it. 1 do not even own one of
the calendars."
Another participant explained: "I
don't know how they picked me. I
thought about it and didn't think that it
was such a big deal. I didn't realize that
it would create such a stir. Some of my
friends were in it so I figured it was
legitimate. I was supposed to see my
proofs but I did not because I was
really busy at the time. A good thing
was that we got to pick what clothes we
wore."
In summary, she said: "I've gotten
some weird reactions to the whole
thing. Its kinda fun when freshman
come up to you and say, 'Hey you're
Miss August.' (That's not my month
incidently.) Overall, I think the calen

dar is fairly tasteful."
The sales stategy is threefold: to mar
ket the product primarily at local
bookstores, to sell at other locations
on campus and to sell at other schools
around the nation. Plans to implement
the final two stages are underway.
The Stanford Bookstore is often the
first place that student entrepreneurs
approach to market their ideas.
Likewise, CWE first negotiated a signed
deal with Mark Ouimet at the
Bookstore. In the deal, the Bookstore
retains 40 percent of the retail price.
Furthermore, the rights to the Stanford
name were obtained not by an abso
lute price but rather from a percentage
fee — 10 percent of the sales revenue
from outside Stanford.
"Bookstore sales have been very
good," said Forster. "Of the 200 copies
originally purchased by the Stanford
Bookstore, almost all have been sold

within the first three weeks. The
bookstore has recently purchased 280
more."
Also, the calendar is currently
carried by more than 10 other
bookstores in the Bay Area. Sales in
these stores have also exceeded CWE s
initial expectations.
Football games have been an addi
tional area for calendar sales. For the
first game, souvenir stands carried the
item. For the remaining games,
however, a more productive idea was
implemented: to sell calendars to
people outside the game. Since then,
many calendars have been sold to
adults at tailgater parties.
The third market approach is to sell
through the bookstores at other
schools. Comments Forster: "We plan
to contact other schools such as USC
and UCLA within the next two weeks.
Also, we feel that there may be a mar

ket at places like Harvard, MIT and the
other Ivy Leagues.
"Stanford's name and the quality of
the calendar are two main reasons why
we hope to be able to sell successfully
our product at other schools," he
added.
In the future, CWE plans to continue
selling on campus and especially to try
to sell at other bookstores at colleges.
At present, Dodge is considering
making a "Men of Stanford" calendar
but the other members have yet to ver
bally commit to a future project.
Was the making of the "Women of
Stanford" calendar a worthwhile ex
perience? "Yes," said Dodge. "It was
a real learning experience and pro
vided excellent business and sales
skills."
"It was a challenge to complete a
project successfully. It also taught us
how to deal with a little controversy."

versity of Southern California (USC)
calendar that we looked at was not so
great but still made a lot of money. We
realized then that we could do a better
job — that is, have classy non-bathing
suit shots — and still be profitable."
Dodge, the executive producer, said
the group was aware of the possibil
ity of controversy, but "we knew we
would make a classy and legitimate
calendar and thus we were not overly
concerned about controversy."
Finances presented the major prob
lem. Said Forster: "Printing costs were
much, much more than we had an
ticipated." Originally, Dodge was to
provide the sole financial support.

However, since actual costs were more
than double anticipated costs, CWE
decided to sell advertisements to make
up this cost difference.
"Response from sponsors was very
positive" said Forster. Indeed, the capi
tal raised from ads comprised more
than 60 percent of the actual costs and
even exceeded what the group had an
ticipated for the entire project. A
glossy, full-page ad for Stanford BMW
in Palo Alto occupies the hack of the
calendar. Space underneath each
monthly calendar is filled by sponsors
ranging from Video Express to Hyatt

Hotels to the Los Altos Athletic Club.
Most people who buy the calendar
will probably remember less about the
advertisements and more about the 12
undergraduate women who are
featured for each month. The selection
of the women was primarily conducted
in private by the producers and not
through public advertisements or con
tests. That is, they asked people around
them for their opinions about who
might look good in the calendar. Fif
teen women were approached and
three declined for personal reasons.
Of the 12 featured women, several
are studying abroad this quarter,
others declined to comment, and some
explained their presence in the cal
endar on condition of anonymity.
"When they first asked me and I
realized that they were serious, I was
son of flattered at the whole thing
said one. "I talked a lot with my par
ents about the decision. Though 1 saw
no enlightening reason to do it, I also
saw no real reasons not to. I viewed it
all as fairly innocent and not blatantly
wrong. I never meant to intentionally
hurt anyone.
"I was told that the pictures would
not only feature us but also scenes of
Stanford," she continued. "I would
have been happier if this had been the
case. They also told me that I would be
able to choose the picture of me that
would be printed and I agreed because
I did not want it to be an exploitative
shot. I did not get to choose my picture
though. Finally, I didn't anticipate or
want the controversy. At other schools,
it's a much bigger deal. Girls compete
to be in it. 1 do not even own one of
the calendars."
Another participant explained: "I
don't know how they picked me. I
thought about it and didn't think that it
was such a big deal. I didn't realize that
it would create such a stir. Some of my
friends were in it so I figured it was
legitimate. I was supposed to see my
proofs but I did not because I was
really busy at the time. A good thing
was that we got to pick what clothes we
wore."
In summary, she said: "I've gotten
some weird reactions to the whole
thing. Its kinda fun when freshman
come up to you and say, 'Hey you're
Miss August.' (That's not my month
incidently.) Overall, I think the calen

dar is fairly tasteful."
The sales stategy is threefold: to mar
ket the product primarily at local
bookstores, to sell at other locations
on campus and to sell at other schools
around the nation. Plans to implement
the final two stages are underway.
The Stanford Bookstore is often the
first place that student entrepreneurs
approach to market their ideas.
Likewise, CWE first negotiated a signed
deal with Mark Ouimet at the
Bookstore. In the deal, the Bookstore
retains 40 percent of the retail price.
Furthermore, the rights to the Stanford
name were obtained not by an abso
lute price but rather from a percentage
fee — 10 percent of the sales revenue
from outside Stanford.
"Bookstore sales have been very
good," said Forster. "Of the 200 copies
originally purchased by the Stanford
Bookstore, almost all have been sold

within the first three weeks. The
bookstore has recently purchased 280
more."
Also, the calendar is currently
carried by more than 10 other
bookstores in the Bay Area. Sales in
these stores have also exceeded CWE s
initial expectations.
Football games have been an addi
tional area for calendar sales. For the
first game, souvenir stands carried the
item. For the remaining games,
however, a more productive idea was
implemented: to sell calendars to
people outside the game. Since then,
many calendars have been sold to
adults at tailgater parties.
The third market approach is to sell
through the bookstores at other
schools. Comments Forster: "We plan
to contact other schools such as USC
and UCLA within the next two weeks.
Also, we feel that there may be a mar

ket at places like Harvard, MIT and the
other Ivy Leagues.
"Stanford's name and the quality of
the calendar are two main reasons why
we hope to be able to sell successfully
our product at other schools," he
added.
In the future, CWE plans to continue
selling on campus and especially to try
to sell at other bookstores at colleges.
At present, Dodge is considering
making a "Men of Stanford" calendar
but the other members have yet to ver
bally commit to a future project.
Was the making of the "Women of
Stanford" calendar a worthwhile ex
perience? "Yes," said Dodge. "It was
a real learning experience and pro
vided excellent business and sales
skills."
"It was a challenge to complete a
project successfully. It also taught us
how to deal with a little controversy."

The twelve undergraduates featured in the "Women of Stanford" calendar are pictured above on the cover. The
calendar has provoked controversy in the Stanford community.
There are several items that are a
mast for the typical college student: a
phone, a mailbox (that is never full
enough), and posters on the wall. And
a calendar.
"Calendars of all types are pretty big
business at college bookstores around
the country," comments a buyer for
the Stanford Bookstore.
Indeed, walking into the Stanford
Bookstore, one is confronted by a ple
thora of calendars. There are cutesy
kitten calendars on the shelf next to
calendars full of sweaty, half-naked
men. One can also be exposed to a dif
ferent eccentric Far Side cartoon each
month or to spectacular scenes of
Yosemite.
One calendar this year, however, has
emerged from this assortment as a cen
ter of controversy. The "Women of

Stanford" calendar, featuring 12 under
graduates, has aroused comment from
various sectors of the Stanford commu
nity. Feminist groups find the item
degrading and offensive to women.
Other students merely view the calen
dar as an innocuous way to make some
money.
The story of the making of the
"Women of Stanford" calendar has
been buried amidst the controversy.
Last winter quarter, juniors John
Forster and Linda Dodge and several
other students formed Cardinal
Women Enterprises (CWE), the organi

zation that developed the calendar.
