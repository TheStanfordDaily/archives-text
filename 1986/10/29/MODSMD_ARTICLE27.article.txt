## Unforgettable 'Lesser God' 
### MARY SUNGAILA 
The typical '80s romance movie
belongs to one of two types: the
mildly entertaining but often banal
romantic comedy, or the steamy,
"let's substitute lust for love" variety
that consists mainly of graphic
bedroom scenes. "Children of a Les
ser God" provides a refreshing
change, for the romance between
James Leeds (William Hurt) and
Sarah Norman (Marlee Matlin)
plumbs deeper, more genuine
depths of human emotion than
either of the aforementioned types.
Hurt plays an idealistic teacher ar
riving at a school for the deaf with
"credentials from all the best
schools." He's a sensitive, sexy and
witty man with whom any '80s
woman would fall in love at the drop
of a hat. Matlin piays a consummately
mysterious, beautiful and angry
woman, a recent graduate of the
school who has her own bitter
reasons for staying on campus, doing

menial work.
The affair between the two charac
ters is one of real chemistry, affinity
and passion. Yet they must weather
the tension inherent in all relation
ships, the struggle to retain in
dividuality yet to connect as one.
Their romance also has a more par
ticular tension, one between them
and imposed by insensitive out
siders, caused by her deafness.
Theirs is a bittersweet triumph, as
they vow to communicate in a lan
guage somewhere between "sound
and silence" — the language of love
itself.
Both individually and as a team,
Hurt and Matlin are explosive. Mat
lin, who is deaf in real life, doesn't
mince words, or signs, for that mat
ter. She has a unique talent for con
centrating her emotions, and those
of the audience, in her signing and
facial expressions. She masterfully
exudes Sarah's aura of ironic intelli
gence as well as her fierce wit. Hurt
provides wonderful verbal inter

pretations of Matlin's signs, relaying
her thoughts in tones of voice that si
multaneously reveal his reactions.
Mark Medorf, screenwriter and au
thor of the play on which the movie
is based, and director Randa Haines
both perform their respective tasks
capably and sensitively, but the
movie wouldn't have the special ef
fect that it does without the splendid
chemistry between the two prin
cipals. Hurt and Matlin make the
movie.
"Children of a Lesser God" is
decidedly intense. The audience
shuffles out dazedly, quietly, as the
credits roll across the screen. Every
one has forgotten they can speak,
that they are not deaf themselves,
and look to their companion's hand
movements for signs of communica
tion. For just a few moments, every
one's world is transformed, until
someone speaks and the spell is bro
ken. But the memory of this unparal
leled experience lingers long after
ward.
