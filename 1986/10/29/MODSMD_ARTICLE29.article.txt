# Genesis shows its live 'Touch'
## 
### LIZ GOODMAN 
Only his gentlemanly air and pleasant sense of humor
could help him pull it off. Encouraging a capacity crowd at
the Oakland Coliseum to pretend they could cause the
entire arena to levitate by making strange, shrieking sounds
and waving their arms is not an easy thing to do.
Sound silly? Well maybe, but a score of monstrously suc
cessful albums and tours are proof enough that Phil Collins,
along with Genesis co-members Tony Banks and Mike Rut
herford, could convince his fans of just about anything.
Though it has been 20 years since the band that would
become Genesis first appeared, devoted fans both old and
new are currently in such plentiful supply around here that
six performances were needed to accommodate everyone, a
new Bay Area record.
Those in attendance on Thursday night were treated to
more than two hours of Genesis material, mostly from their
latest album, "Invisible Touch." But as Collins promised at
the start, "We're going to play a lot of new songs, some old
songs and some really really old songs." True to Collins'
word, a sprinkling of music was played that represented the
full spectrum of their material.
The crowd itself was quite subdued. Most spent the con
cert seated, standing up only occasionally during favorite
songs like "Invisible Touch" and the encore. This wasn't a
sign of dissatisfaction, however, but rather a reflection of the

mellow music and, easygoing stage presence of Gerfeiis. In
keeping with the group's character, band memben|Vere
casually attired and the stage set was very simple.
The focus really was on the music, so much s<*that
Rutherford and Banks seemed almost "silent" members,
merely executing the music while leaving it up to Collins'
charm and refreshingly tactful wit to provide the show with
continuity. • ft
Fortunately, his duties as frontman of Genesis wive not
caused Collins to completely abandon his first rolttin the
group, that of drummer. Though most of the matlmal re
quired the help of tour drummer Chester Thompson, the
highlight of the show came when Collins returned*® his
drum set (there were two drum kits onstage) to playiiVluo
with Thompson. It was a fine display of
timing, with both drummers seemingly tuned into the Same
wavelength. It was also infinitely more interesting to near
and watch than the traditional drum solos at most conceits.
Solo material, however, from Genesis members was not
included in the night's lineup. This band has been a source
of musical inspiration collectively, of course, but it has also
provided a wealth of solo contributions from the Current
trio and also from former members Steve Hackett arlp Peter
Gabriel. In fact, Genesis has survived what has been the :
downfall of countless groups — members leaving and solo
projects. Now finishing their fourth sold-out Americanttour,
the members of Genesis remain a very convincing trio!, •,
