### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy has an
nounced the formation of the Centennial Celebration
Operating Committee (CCOC) to organize the events
commemorating the 100 th year of Stanford educa
tion.
The group will plan the five-year schedule of ob
servances and the week of academic symposia and
parties that will cap off the Centennial Celebration in
October 1991.
"We would like to see faculty, students and staff
partake in the activities that will celebrate Stanford's
Centennial and show off Stanford as a major research
university," said CCOC chairman Gerald Lieberman,
professor of operations research and former vice
provost.
Although specific plans for the celebration are still

being developed, the CCOC has outlined broad
goals. The Centennial would "serve to bring atten
dees — scholars and the public at large — up to date
on the accomplishments and future challenges in
many intellectual fields and would address the prob
lems facing society as it enters the 21st century," ac
cording to a University press release.
"The celebration will mean more than parties. It
will be a celebration of academic purpose and vi
sion," said Stephen Peeps, director of University Re
lations and executive director of the CCOC.
Lieberman also mentioned a more introspective
focus to the Centennial. "(We will) take time to high
light the University: what it has done, what it is doing,
and what it will be doing in the future," he said.
Kennedy's comments echo this emphasis on
looking back and looking ahead. "Stanford's centen
nial happens to occur at a unique point in time. On
the one hand, Stanford's founding objectives remain

familiar, yet on the other, a mature institution has
evolved which must address the needs of a contem
porary society," he told University News Service.
Although the culmination of Centennial events will
be in 1991, the first big event — the 100 th anniver
sary of the cornerstone laying — will occur on May
14,1987. "Two to three days of celebration activities"
will take place that weekend, according to Peeps.
The responsibilities of the CCOC will encompass
all" Centennial-related activities except for fund
raising. Budget appropriations, responsibility for
planning all activities and public relations for the
Centennial will be the principal duties of the com
mittee.
"Part of the charge of the CCOC will be to reach
out and encourage proposals for activities that will
be part of the Centennial Celebration," said Peeps.
He added that the committee will also
review petitions from Stanford organi
zations for funds for activities celebrat
ing the Centennial.
The cost of the celebrations and aca
demic conferences will be consider
able. Lieberman said that the commit

tee has not established a figure but that
the "funds needed for these activities
are not trivial. Think in terms of Har
vard's 350 th anniversary, which cost
several million dollars."
Harvard's anniversary this fall was
more of a "350 th festive party," accord
ing to Peeps. "The Centennial
represents an opportunity for Stanford
that's larger than that: a unique oppor
tunity to take stock in what it has ac
complished," he said.

In addition to Peeps and Lieberfnan,
members of the CCOC are Robert
Freelen, vice president for Public Af
fairs; Lawrence Ryan, professor of En
glish and humanities; William Stone,
director of the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation; and Henry Riggs, vice president
for development.
A fund drive launched by the Devel
opment Office will complement the
Centennial events.
