# Byrne starts making sense in 'True Stories'
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Writers like David Byrne. They
adore the guy. They love to write about
him. When it's time to review some
thing new by Byrne, writers toss their
critical detachment out the window
and wallow in superlatives. The way
they write about Byrne's great intellect,
you'd think he was the first rock star
who knew how to read and write.
Me, I like David Byrne too. I've liked
him ever since I saw him on "Late
Night with David Letterman" three
years ago. It was a memorable occa
sion: Byrne acted as if he'd just beamed
down from another planet, while for
once even Letterman seemed
dumbfounded. What makes me groan,
however, at the sound of David Byrne,
are the critical hosannas that accom
pany his every move. Journalists praise
Byrne's work with Talking Heads be
cause they know they're on safe
ground.
After all, the reasoning goes, Byrne
is involved in New York's avant-garde
art scene, so his music must be art too,
right? This attitude sits not at all well
with me because by implication it
relegates the work of Townsend, Jag
ger/Richards, et al, to the dustbin. Rock
music shouldn't have to be dependent

on other art forms for its artistic
legitimacy.
Fortunately, Byrne doesn't seem to
sit around reading what people write
about him. In "True Stories," he shows
that he is that rarest of creatures, an
avant garde artist with a sense of
humor. "True Stories" is a very intelli
gent movie, but what's surprising is
how disarmingly funny it is. It seduces
the audience with a wink and a grin. By
the time the movie's over, you feel like
offering Byrne a beer from the fridge.
You can't say that about too many other
intellectuals, now can you?
The script of "True Stories" — by
Byrne, Stephen Toblowsky and Beth
Henley — isn't big on plot. In fact, the
movie comes right out and says it's just
"about a bunch of people in Virgil,
Texas." Virgil is a fictional desert town
where almost everybody works for the
same electronics firm. The
townspeople are excited by the up
coming parade and talent show, pan of
Virgil's 150 th anniversary celebrations.
Observing the town's day-to-day
existence is a rather odd character
known as the Narrator, played by
Byrne, who also served as director.
The Narrator drives around Virgil in a
red convertible, decked out in cowboy
duds, dispensing bits of wisdom to the
audience. He seems fascinated by all
the people he meets, and who

wouldn't be? They're a pretty fascinat
ing bunch. There's Miss Rollings, the
laziest woman in the world (Swoosie
Kurtz), who never gets out of bed; a
happily married couple (Spalding Gray
and Annie McEnroe) who haven't
spoken to each other in years; and
Louis Fyne (John Goodman), a good
natured fellow who wants marriage so
badly he places a neon "wife wanted"
sign on his front lawn.
Byrne claims to have gotten the
ideas for these characters from reading
tabloid newspapers, hence the film's
title. If he and his fellow writers were
ever tempted to treat their characters
as a big joke (why else read tabloids?),
they've very successfully resisted.
While we do laugh when Louis Fyne
and the others are on screen, it's never
mocking laughter. The citizens of Vir
gil may be comical eccentrics, but
they're an undeniably likable bunch of
folks.
As for the directing, Byrne
demonstrates that he's got a sharp eye
for visuals. No big surprise: He is a
former art student, after all. Plainness
exists side by side with artifice: Shots
that look like down home postcards al
ternate with more attention-getting, ar
tier compositions.
"Wild Wild Life" sounds mighty in
consequential on the radio, but here
during a rowdy lip-synching contest, it

fires up as various contestants, all of
them decidedly unglamorous, act out
their rock-star fantasies. Later, during a
rousing gospel number sung by the
Preacher (John Inge), a slide show in
the background gives a dizzying,
dadaistic impression of the last 30
years in politics and pop culture. It's
the sort of rapid-fire montage that
hasn't been seen since the heyday of
psychedelia.
"Love for Sale" is performed by

Talking Heads themselves, when one
character happens to see them on tele
vision. It's a weird little clip, admittedly
a rock video within the movie,
showing the Heads being turned into
chocolate candy bars. It ties in with the
rest of "True Stories," though, since
the movie as a whole is concerned
with commercialism and mass produc
tion.
Fortunately, Byrne doesn't try to
drum up any hollow outr ,e over his

themes. Instead he shows that the sales
pitch, the bigger-is-better aesthetic and
extravagant bad taste have all become
an accepted part of the American way
of life. Under these circumstances
you'd expect to find a nation full of
dull conformists, but that's not the
message of "True Stories" at all.
Leaving his Soho cocoon, Byrne finds
that individualism has emerged side
by side with industrialism, that our
heartland is full of lovable weirdos.

them decidedly unglamorous, act out
their rock-star fantasies. Later, during a
rousing gospel number sung by the
Preacher (John Inge), a slide show in
the background gives a dizzying,
dadaistic impression of the last 30
years in politics and pop culture. It's
the sort of rapid-fire montage that
hasn't been seen since the heyday of
psychedelia.
"Love for Sale" is performed by

Talking Heads themselves, when one
character happens to see them on tele
vision. It's a weird little clip, admittedly
a rock video within the movie,
showing the Heads being turned into
chocolate candy bars. It ties in with the
rest of "True Stories," though, since
the movie as a whole is concerned
with commercialism and mass produc
tion.
Fortunately, Byrne doesn't try to
drum up any hollow outr ,e over his

themes. Instead he shows that the sales
pitch, the bigger-is-better aesthetic and
extravagant bad taste have all become
an accepted part of the American way
of life. Under these circumstances
you'd expect to find a nation full of
dull conformists, but that's not the
message of "True Stories" at all.
Leaving his Soho cocoon, Byrne finds
that individualism has emerged side
by side with industrialism, that our
heartland is full of lovable weirdos.

David Byrne has found the perfect vehicle in "True Stories," which he directed, co-wrote and stars in. How can
anyone be so talented?
Writers like David Byrne. They
adore the guy. They love to write about
him. When it's time to review some
thing new by Byrne, writers toss their
critical detachment out the window
and wallow in superlatives. The way
they write about Byrne's great intellect,
you'd think he was the first rock star
who knew how to read and write.
Me, I like David Byrne too. I've liked
him ever since I saw him on "Late
Night with David Letterman" three
years ago. It was a memorable occa
sion: Byrne acted as if he'd just beamed
down from another planet, while for
once even Letterman seemed
dumbfounded. What makes me groan,
however, at the sound of David Byrne,
are the critical hosannas that accom
pany his every move. Journalists praise
Byrne's work with Talking Heads be
cause they know they're on safe
ground.
After all, the reasoning goes, Byrne
is involved in New York's avant-garde
art scene, so his music must be art too,
right? This attitude sits not at all well
with me because by implication it
relegates the work of Townsend, Jag
ger/Richards, et al, to the dustbin. Rock
music shouldn't have to be dependent

on other art forms for its artistic
legitimacy.
Fortunately, Byrne doesn't seem to
sit around reading what people write
about him. In "True Stories," he shows
that he is that rarest of creatures, an
avant garde artist with a sense of
humor. "True Stories" is a very intelli
gent movie, but what's surprising is
how disarmingly funny it is. It seduces
the audience with a wink and a grin. By
the time the movie's over, you feel like
offering Byrne a beer from the fridge.
You can't say that about too many other
intellectuals, now can you?
The script of "True Stories" — by
Byrne, Stephen Toblowsky and Beth
Henley — isn't big on plot. In fact, the
movie comes right out and says it's just
"about a bunch of people in Virgil,
Texas." Virgil is a fictional desert town
where almost everybody works for the
same electronics firm. The
townspeople are excited by the up
coming parade and talent show, pan of
Virgil's 150 th anniversary celebrations.
Observing the town's day-to-day
existence is a rather odd character
known as the Narrator, played by
Byrne, who also served as director.
The Narrator drives around Virgil in a
red convertible, decked out in cowboy
duds, dispensing bits of wisdom to the
audience. He seems fascinated by all
the people he meets, and who

wouldn't be? They're a pretty fascinat
ing bunch. There's Miss Rollings, the
laziest woman in the world (Swoosie
Kurtz), who never gets out of bed; a
happily married couple (Spalding Gray
and Annie McEnroe) who haven't
spoken to each other in years; and
Louis Fyne (John Goodman), a good
natured fellow who wants marriage so
badly he places a neon "wife wanted"
sign on his front lawn.
Byrne claims to have gotten the
ideas for these characters from reading
tabloid newspapers, hence the film's
title. If he and his fellow writers were
ever tempted to treat their characters
as a big joke (why else read tabloids?),
they've very successfully resisted.
While we do laugh when Louis Fyne
and the others are on screen, it's never
mocking laughter. The citizens of Vir
gil may be comical eccentrics, but
they're an undeniably likable bunch of
folks.
As for the directing, Byrne
demonstrates that he's got a sharp eye
for visuals. No big surprise: He is a
former art student, after all. Plainness
exists side by side with artifice: Shots
that look like down home postcards al
ternate with more attention-getting, ar
tier compositions.
"Wild Wild Life" sounds mighty in
consequential on the radio, but here
during a rowdy lip-synching contest, it

fires up as various contestants, all of
them decidedly unglamorous, act out
their rock-star fantasies. Later, during a
rousing gospel number sung by the
