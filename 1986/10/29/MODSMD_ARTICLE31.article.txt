# 'Dike' and 'Medea' are a mixed bill
## 
### JULIET JOHNSON 
Audiences at the Nitery discovered this past week that
tinkering with classic drama can be a hazardous venture.
Stanford's Drama Department kicked off its 1986-87 season
with a double bill of "Dike" and "Medea-Plays" in the Nitery,
and the results were decidedly uneven.
"Dike," directed by Jane Sanborn, was described as "an
experimental theater piece ... based on The Oresteia." It
must have been based extremely loosely on the trilogy, be
cause I recognized few elements of the original within the
play. The performance began with beating drums as the ac
tors slowly made their way to the stage, which at first
created the appropriate sense of drama and suspense. As the
beat went on and on, however, it became simply boring. Un
fortunately this feeling wasn't alleviated during the rest of
the play. Orestes (Drew Barr) and Clytemnestra (Alicia Mil
ler) were more believable than the chorus, but still failed to
interest the audience in their characters.
Much of the responsibility for this, though, should be
placed on the script. The writing was incohesive, lacking the
powerful emotion present in the original "Oresteia." I
caught several references to the original in the play, but if I
hadn't studied it earlier, the few portions I did understand

would have been meaningless.
By contrast, "Medea-Plays" was impressive. This produc
tion was always interesting, even gripping at times. Director
Edward Isse set the stage with four different aspects of
Medea surrounding a statue-like Jason (Jeff Soesbe), with
four speakers in the rear. The various Medeas, representing
rationality, vengeance, lust and madness, struggled for con
trol in a well-written sequence of soliloquies. The Woman
in Black, vengeance Qennifer Arnold), presented her char
acter with an intensity that completely captured the audi
ence's attention. The Woman with a Purple Sash, lust (Joyce
Dorado), was also excellent and took quite a few risks with
her part.
The only major flaw came at the climax, when Medea
murders her children. The scene seemed overdramatized
instead of horrifying, and the music became annoying.
Overall, however, "Medea-Plays" successfully revitalized
and expanded upon the ancient myth. Although "Dike" was
disappointing, "Medea-Plays" was well-worth the ticket
price and boded well for the rest of the Drama Depart
ment's year. With luck, future productions won't have the
same schizophrenic quality that characterized this double
bill.
