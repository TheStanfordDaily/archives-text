# KZSU PICKS

### 
Welcome hack to KZSU Picks. Due to
unfortunate circumstances beyond
our control, this column was pre
empted last week, and the Daily
switchboard was overloaded with
furious callers, demanding to know
where their biweekly record review
column was. Let it nei er be said we
aren't responsive to the public's needs:
We now present KZSU Picks in all its
glory. Next Friday we'll get back on
schedule, so all you avid readers won't
have to go through KZSU withdrawal.
This week's albums are rated in terms
of junk food.
Howard Jones — "One to One"
HoHo HoHo HoHo
It isn't easy being a famous record
critic. You're always being tempted to
take the easy way out. Take the scary
example from our experience with the
latest album from Howard Jones. As
soon as we touched the vinyl,
Vinebergus, the Archdemon of Precon
ception in Entertainment Review, ap

peared before us. "I've got a great idea
for the opening line for your Jones
review," he snarled satanically. "How
about 'Playing the new Howard Jones
album for the first time is like putting
on an old sweatshirt for the millionth.
You know c tctly how it's gonna feel
— warm, comfortable...Well, he
went on and on, but fortunately, we
were wearing our official "But I LIKED
E.T.!" Reese's Pieces Amulets and were
able to ward him off.
So we were able to listen to "One to
One" fairly unbiasedly. But to our hor
ror, all those evil preconceptions were
valid. This, Jones' third album, is just
what you'd expect from the Prince of
Positive Pop. There's the requisite
number of ballads about how this aut
horitarian world of ours is trying to get
us down, but if we just hang on to our
humanity, everything will work out
OK. There's the trendy dance songs
about love and relationships and in
security. And Hojo continues his tradi
tion of exploring new genres to stuff
into his almighty power-pop syn

ihesizers: He bounces along to a reggae
beat, gets into a rap groove and even
does some kind of Art of Noise stuff.
Yep, that's about it.
It's kind of hard to figure out what
Hojo's problem is. He's got melody.
He's got a cool voice. He has a new
haircut every week. He looks like a
nice guy. We figure that Jones must feel
that his mission to make upbeat
synthpop and his niche in grinding out
record clones are one and the same.
Sure, you and we know that they aren't.
Somebody better go tell Howie.

Big Audio Dynamite — "No. 10,
Upping St."
Twinkie Twinkie Twinkie Twinkie
Last year at this time, it looked like
the whole world was teetering on the
brink of another of those apocalyptic
struggles between superpowers. We
write, of course, about the worldwide
panic created by Mick Jones' ouster
from the Clash. Oh, it was awful. Re
member all the nasty things Jones and
Clash leader Joe Strummer said about
each other's mothers? And remember
when we all thought Armageddon was
nigh when Jones' new band and the
Clash released albums AT THE SAME
TIME?
Fortunately for the world as we
know it, this conflict, unlike the ter
rible Lennon-McCartney wars of the
early '70s, fizzled pretty quick. The
Clash's record, "Cut the Crap," was a
bust both critically and economically.
On the other hand, Jones and his new
band, Big Audio Dynamite, were a hit.
It was kind of like a rastafied version of
the harmonious days of the Clash —
the band wasn't as interested in the
self-importance of its members as it
was in trying out new idea for songs,
instrumentation, and having a good
time.
And now, even Strummer has
realized that BAD was good and a
Jones-less Clash was trash. That's right,
sports fans, check your scorecards,
Strummer and Jones have joined
forces to co-produce and even co-write
BAD's second album. This is a good
thing. While the first record was fantas

tic, much of its greatness came from
the fact that it was more or less a
surprise. Pressure was on for the
second release, and a heck of a lot
could've gone wrong.
Well, not much did. In fact, "No. 10,
Upping St." pursues BAD's dogma of
the unity of rock 'n' funk with even
more vigor than before,
kind of injects a bit more Clash-y guitar
sound in the mix, but it's still the same
old BAD dance stuff. The only thing we
miss is the randomness of the first al
bum's fun junk, the weird audio snip
pets and extended beatbox grinds,
which make only token appearances
here. Instead, the accent is on a certain
strong consistency associated with
great bands. Are they making a move
for Big Radio Respect with Strummer
just jumping on the BAD wagon to the
top? Maybe, but with Strummer and
Jones pals again, can global peace be
far behind?

Orchestral Manoevres In the Dark
— "The Pacific Age"
DingDong DingDong DingDong Ding
OMD was originally two guys with
some synthesizer effects, awesome
voices and an ear for pop tunes. The
band was once the King of Industrial
Technopop, their catchy melodies
layered over seemingly discordant
background instruments like
typewriters, Speak 'n' Spells, vocoder
loops and other gizmos that somehow
managed to sound appropriate and
harmonious. Their lyrics and sound il
lustrated alienation in our increasingly
technological society.
The last two albums, "Junk Culture"
and "Crush," however, saw them con
centrating on a more accessible pop
sound. "The Pacific Age," their seventh
album, is along these same lines. OMD
has gradually expanded until today,
when it includes real live band mem
bers. They've got a drummer, two ad
ditional keyboardists and a horn sec
tion. They have an amazing talent for
melody and fortunately haven't lost
their distinctively intelligent brand of
pop sound.
"The Pacific Age" is no daring step

into musical frontiers, and lacks any
kind of meaningful statement, but it's
enjoyable nonetheless. It's much less
saccharine than the commercial strides
made on "Crush," and the high
pitched, soulful voices of Haul
Humphreys and Andy McCluskey are
in top form.
This record will sell, and it's pleasant
enough that it deserves to. It's still dis
appointing, though, that OMD has not
taken any risks or pushed their talents
further.

Guadalcanal Diary — "Jamboree"
Snowballs Snowballs Snowballs
Quick. Guadalcanal Diary is: a) an
old John Wayne flick; b) something
you buy COD from a late-night TV
commercial because you're thrilled
that operators are standing by; c) a
comic book; d) a band from Marietta,
Gee-Ayuh. You took the SAT, you
decide. For the purposes of this
review, we'll go with "d."

Hie past year has been kind to many
small bands, G.D. included, as the
major record labels seem to have
decided that the little guys have com
mercial as well as artistic promise.
Whether this is the break that these
bands need to be successful on both
fronts remains to t>e seen. At least now
G.D. is free to go head-to-head against
Lionel Richie and Iron Maiden in shop
ping malls across the United States.
In any event, "Jamboree" is a solid
second album. Lyrically it's hard to
fault. There is humor ("Cattle Prod," "I

See Moe" and the improbable
"T.R.0.U.8.L.E."), quiet desperation
(the masterful "Please Stop Me" and
the haunting "Michael Rockefeller"),
and God and religion even enter' the
picture. The one minor problem with
the LP is that, on a mimical level,' it
doesn't seem quite as refreshing as' its
predecessor. Maybe next time around,
they'll instill as much variety in the
music as they do now in the lyrics.
