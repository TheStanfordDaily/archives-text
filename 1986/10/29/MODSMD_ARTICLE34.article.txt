## Stanford knocked off by No. 11 Cal Poly Cardinal exhibits flashes of brilliance in loss 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
A mid-week trip for the Stanford
women's volleyball team to Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo proved to be all for
nought as the Mustangs downed the
Cardinal in five games last night, 15-7,
4-15,15-6, 4-15,15-12.
For a recently surging Stanford
team, the loss was particularly disap
pointing, and Stanford Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves said, "We've been
playing real well lately. A lot of people
expected us to win. 1 think we ex
pected to win, but we didn't play like
we have been. We could not put the
ball away against their defense."
The Cardinal squad knew it was in
for a tough battle against the Mustangs
even before the five-hour van ride
down the coast. Cal Poly is currently
ranked just one spot behind Stanford
in the Tachikara Coaches Poll at No. 11.
Still, it was a disappointing outing
for the Cardinal, which is second in the
Pacific 10 Conference with an 8-1
record. Stanford is now 12-7 overall,
while Cal Poly imroved its record to
18-9.
"We were really inconsistent,"
Nieves said. "The scores tell it all."
All the games were quick and
decisive except the fifth and final
game, in which Stanford made a come
back bid but fell short. Cal Poly easily
won the first and third games, but the
Cardinal responded with big wins in
the second and fourth. The entire
match took only two hours and ten
minutes.

The last game was the only portion
of the contest which was not lopsided.
"They almost pulled out the match,"
Nieves said. "They had a good come
back at the end; they rallied. It was the
fact that we were so inconsistent that
did us in."
The squad's inconsistency is evident
in the statistics. Leading hitter Barbra
Fontana totalled 26 kills to go along
with a respectable .250 hitting
percentage, but Nancy Reno made 13
errors on the night with her 17 kills
and finished with a .080 average.
Theresa Smith scored 15 kills, but her

nine errors gave her a .117 hitting
percentage.
The Stanford team as a whole
managed only a .119 percentage,
compared with a .208 mark for the
Mustangs. The Cardinal made 49 er
rors, while Cal Poly had only 25. Stan
ford recorded 18 serving errors; Cal
Poly made eight.
"Cal Poly was the steadier team,"
Nieves said. "They were the team that
made fewer errors.
"They blocked really well, they got
their hands on a lot of balls. They really
play as a team, real cohesively. They
dig like crazy and keep the ball coming
back. Eventually the other team will
make a mistake."
There were some positive aspects to
the match, however. One was the play
of senior hitter Fontana, who is second
overall in kills on the squad with 250.
"Barbra had a pretty decent game,"
Nieves said. "The team didn't pass too
well, which puts the outside hitters in a
situation where they had to hit a lot of
balls against two blockers. All things
considered, Barbra turned in a good
performance."
Setter Wendi Rush also played well.
"She set pretty well," Nieves said.
"When the passing is off, it's tough on
everyone. She had to run around on
the floor a lot and jump set above the
net a lot to save passes."
Most encouraging was the way in
which the Cardinal battled back.
"Despite the loss, there were some
good things," Nieves said. "We had
some good streaks, especially the way
we came back in the fifth game."
