# Series over, basketball next: Eselius makes division picks

### 
Finafly, the damn thing called baseball ends. It's
October, a mere bat's breath away from Halloween,
and we, the collective body of sports enthusiasts,
must endure hearing Mets manager Davey Johnson
rattle off sage expressions like "That's baseball, it's
never really over till it's over" and"I shower naked,
damn it." The last one was fictional.
Perhaps my baseball intolerance stems from my
general repugnance for the Mets, especially the
rooters.
It's the '80s and New York fans enjoy listening and
singing along to Queen. Over and over, like
entranced infants battling a Speak 'n' Spell machine,
the Mets partisans did their best to follow the words

of "We Will Rock You" and its steady, rock-on beat.
USC fight song, anyone?
But all boring, stretched-out, continous and life
long things must come to their ever-climactic end.
Baseball is over, and basketball is here.
NBA-style basketball, baseball's lithe and quicker
nightmare, gives the sports fan a more than worthy
NFL counterpart.

Where people used to feel compelled to cheer a
man walking 90 feet, they can now rise up and root
about athletes elevating over 10 feet.
No more ball fours to balk at: We're doomed to a
bird's-eye view of spectacular basketball magic. Oh
where are you Steve "Bye-Bye" Balboni?
Riding its rising crest of popularity, the NBA will
no doubt continue to thrill and appeal. Cities such as
Miami, Orlando and Minneapolis are begging for a
franchise. Last year's expansion team, Sacramento,
will be sold out every game this season. Ronald
Reagan will probably call and congratulate this year's
champions. The NBA has spectators by the ... seat of
their pants.
As November nears and baseball lies comatose, it's
time now to talk turkey: Who will win the NBA cham
pionship? Who will be rookie of the year? Who does
Larry Bird's hair?
To start, a quick gander at the divisional races
should help separate the whey from the cheese.
Dairy humor.
In the Eastern Conference's Central Division, the
Milwaukee Bucks should and will hold down first
place once again. The Bucks helped themselves con
siderably by removing the infamous "three-headed
center" of Randy Breuer, Alton Lister and the
people's choice, Paul Mokeski.
They went out and traded for a center — Jack
Sikma. Sikma, along with volatile first-round draft
choice Scott "Attorney Aid" Skiles, will lead the
Bucks over the Celtics for the Eastern Conference
crown.
Atlanta and Detroit will grab second and third
while the Indiana Pacers, with "rookie" coach Jack
Ramsey at the helm, will finish an optimistic and

somewhat surprising fourth.
The Atlantic Division offers little change from Cel
tic green dominance. Boston, led by their virtually
unstoppable triumvirate of Bird, Robert Parish and
Kevin McHale, will have some trouble staving off a
resurgent Washington Bullet team.
After acquiring Moses Malone and Terry Catledge
from Philadelphia, the Bullets went from mediocre
to playoff contender. The Sixers, on the other hand,
will falter from their lack of foresight. The New Jersey
Nets deserve better than fourth, but then again, they
do play and live in New Jersey.
Moving to the Western Conference, the Los An
geles Lakers — get this — will finish on top in the
Pacific Division. Firmly entrenched in second, the
Portland Trailblazers will give the Lakers problems
this season, especially with first-round draft choice
Walter "The Truth" Berry laying waste to all pre
season skepticism.
The rest of the division will bite, most notably, the
Seattle Supersonics, who will win only nine games
this season, three of which will be intrasquad games.
Finally, the Midwest Division will see the demise of
the Houston Rockets, who will flounder, falter and
dribble away down to third. The new big cheese will
be the Roy Tarpley-led Dallas Mavericks. Second
goes to Denver.
The play-offs will arrive, people will chuckle over
how the Chicago Bulls and the Phoenix Suns made it,
and out of this jumble of post-season fun, the Mil
waukee Bucks and the Dallas Mavericks will emerge
as the conferences' representatives.
Rookie-of-the-year Tarpley will score the winning
basket in game seven. Dallas wins triumphantly.
That's basketball.
