# New York ecstatic as Boston mourns

NEW YORK (AP) â€” The world
champion Mets basked in sunshine,
confetti and adulation yesterday as
an estimated 2.2 million New
Yorkers hailed their heroes in a
thunderous, chaotic ticker tape
parade.
"The team is in a euphoric state,"
said Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon,
also expressing the mood of the
city. 'We are absolutely thrilled."
Fans knocked over police bar
ricades and flooded the streets of
lower Manhattan in a riot of joy as
open limousines carrying team
members threaded their way slowly
up Broadway. It was impossible to
tell where the crowd ended and the
parade began.
People dangled from trees,
perched on ledges and cheered
from rooftops and windows along
the one-mile route to City Hall.
"What the Mets have done is to
take New York, the international
capital, and turn it into a small town
today," said Mayor Edward Koch,
who rode in the lead car of the
parade with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo
and Mets Manager Davey Johnson.
Their car was preceded by two
Sanitation Department snowplows
that scooped up ankle-deep debris
so the parade could proceed. On a
gloriously sunny, crisp fall day, the
skies rained tons and tons of paper.
"The whole last three days have
been unbelievable," said Mets third
baseman Ray Knight, the most

valuable player of the World Series
in which the Mets beat the Boston
Red Sox by winning Game 7 Mon
day night. "I've got goosebumps."
"This means everything," said
second baseman Wally Backman.
"This is what life is all about in New
York City."
About two dozen people were
treated for minor injuries, most of
them caused by "pushing and
shoving and excitement," Emer
gency Medical Service spokes
woman Donna Osso said.
The Police Department deployed
2,500 officers, many of them on
horseback. Police reported only
one arrest. A police spokesman said
he did not know the charge.
Koch said it was the largest
parade in the city's history, but
police in the past have estimated
that as many as 7.5 million people
lined the streets for a parade in
1951 honoring the return of Gen
eral Douglas Mac Arthur and that 4
million turned out for astronaut
John Glenn in 1962.
City Hall, the site of a victory pro
gram after the parade, was
decorated in blue, orange and
white bunting and displayed a sign
reading, "New York Loves the 1986
Mets World Champions."
Flying overhead was a special flag
made up after the Mets defeated the
Houston Astros to win the National
