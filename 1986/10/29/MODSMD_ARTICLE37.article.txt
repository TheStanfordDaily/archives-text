# Stanford meets Cal away, goes for seventh straight
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
As the second half of the Northern Pacific Conference
field hockey season begins, it would appear that the Univer
sity of the Pacific, with a 4-1-0 record and a three-point lead
in the standings, is in firm control of the league race.
But the team to beat may well be Stanford, currendy at 2-
1-1 (8-4-1 overall). The Cardinal is the hottest team in the
conference, having won its last six games. Two of those six
came against UOP, although the second did not count in the
league standings because it took place in the California Invi
tational on Oct. 19.
Stanford will put its streak on the line today in a NorPac
contest against third-place California (1-1-3) Game time is 3
p.m. at Kleeberger Field in Berkeley.
According to Stanford midfielder Mary Goodman, the
Cardinal is a definite contender for the conference title.
"With the performance we put in at the California Invita
tional and with everybody watching, we have to be in
there," she said. There's no denying it — we played well."
All the NorPac teams played in the tournament.
Defensively, Stanford has done more than play well; it has
played perfectly. The Cardinal has not surrendered a goal in
the last four weeks, spanning six games. Sophomore
goalkeeper Karen Jones, an All-NorPac selection last season,
has a goals-against average of 0.92.
The UOP game had been Stanford's fourth in four days,
but the team showed no signs of wearing down "I think ini
tially after a lot of success, we wanted to get right back out

there and play," Goodman said. "When you're on a roll,
you're on a roll."
The Cardinal roll has been slowed down by a 10-day
break in the schedule, but Goodman doesn't expect the
team to be rusty today. "The best time for it (a layoff) was
right before Cal," she said. "There'll be no problem psych
ing ourselves up for Cal. Cal is Cal."
Cal is also a frustrated team looking to break loose. The
Bears have been statistically dominant this year, outscoring
their opponents 18-8 and outshooting most of them by wide
margins, but have only a 5-3-3 overall record and a .500
mark in the NorPac to show for it.
The Bears' scoring has come mainly from two players,
junior forward Kiki Brown and senior midfielder Gretchen
Scheel. Brown has six goals and six assists, while Scheel has
also scored six times and has added one assist. The job of
marking Brown will likely fall to sophomore Alison Smith,
and one of the Cardinal midfielders will be responsible for
Scheel.
Today's game will be in Berkeley, but Stanford should
feel right at home. The Cardinal has won seven straight
games on the artificial turf of Kleeberger Field. "We're a turf
team that happens to play on grass at home," Goodman said.
"The ball moves more predictably (on artificial turf)," she
added. "It's a more precise game. That often works to our
advantage. We do a lot of tactical stuff that's better on turf
than grass."
Still, Goodman expects the Bears to be tough. "They have
a strong program with a lot of good players," she said.
"We're pretty evenly matched."
