# Women finish in second, men sailers place sixth
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
In the first women's regatta of the fall season, held this
past weekend in San Diego, the Stanford sailing team corn
tinued to impress West Coast opponents with its depth of
talent.
Elsewhere on the Bay, however, Stanford's hopes for a na
tional championship in the singlehanded division were
squelched when it could only finish sixth at the Pacific Coast
Singlehanded Championship.
Sailing for the Cardinal women's team, former captain
Buffy Wendt and her crew Kari Evans placed a close second
in the regatta hosted by UC-San Diego. After a windy Satur
day of racing, Wendt and Evans trailed a team from Orange
Coast College by only two points.
"I thought we'd catch them on Sunday, but on Sunday
there was no wind, and with no wind, we had no hope of
making up the difference," Wendt said.
By the end of the regatta, Orange Coast had beaten Stan
ford by the slightest margin. Far back in third was another
team from Orange Coast, followed by UC-Irvine
Stanford also captured sixth and seventh place in the
regatta, as two Cardinal sophomores made their debuts as
skippers in a women's event. D.J. Bernstein, with Rita Snape
as crew, sailed a fast but mistake-riddled series to take sixth
just behind a second team from UC-Irvine. Karen Holl, with
Kari Skilbred crewing, fininshed just points away from
Bernstein.
"I was really happy with Saturday's races, because I felt
like I could sail as fast as anyone and all I needed to do was

cut down on the number of mistakes I was making. I
learned a lot this weekend," Bernstein said.
"We went into the regatta very confident, maybe too
confident, but I think we learned a lot and we'll be able to
beat these schools the next time we go up against them,"
Holl said.
In general, the women's squad was pleased with its per
formance but surprised by the improvement of the Orange
Coast teams.
"Last year, they had nobody. This year, their teams were
incredible," Wendt said.
"The Orange Coast teams took the regatta very seriously,"
Bernstein said.
In the singlehanded championship, held concurrently
with the women's regatta, Stanford failed to live up to last
week's performance, as freshman Al Sargeant's fifth place
did not qualify him to compete at the national champion
ships.
Sargeant was left as the Cardinal's only entry when Stan
ford's other qualifier, sophomore Brad Swett, chose not to
compete.
Sailing Coach Blake Middleton said he was "a bit disap
pointed" that Sargent didn't qualify for the singlehanded na
tionals.
"Given that Al is only a freshman, it was a good perfor
mance. Last year, Billy Shoemaker didn't qualify in the sloop
eliminations, but in his second try, he won both qualifying
regattas, and he and his crew stand a good chance of win
ning the national championship. Al could win it all next
year," Middleton said.
