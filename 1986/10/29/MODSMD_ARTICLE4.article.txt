# Testimony ends in press pass trial
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
The defense and the prosecution
rested their cases yesterday afternoon
at the Palo Alto Municipal Court after a
week of testimony in the jury trial of
Times Tribune chief photographer
Robert Andres, charged with obstruct
ing a police officer in the discharge of
his duty.
The 12-member jury is expected to
deliberate today on whether or not
Andres, arrested last year at Stanford
Stadium, is guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt.
Andres, who said he suffered a
fractured wrist from a wrist lock ap
plied to him during the arrest, has filed
a civil suit against the Stanford Police
Department. It is not yet known when
or if that suit will come to trial.
The misdemeanor charge against

Andres is connected to confusion over
the validity of press passes for the
Stanford-Texas football game Sept. 28,
1985, at the Stanford Stadium.
Around kick-off time that day, Stan
ford Police Sgt. Philip Love told Andres
that his white press pass was not valid
for the field. Believing that his pass was
indeed valid and impatient to photo
graph the game, Andres tried to walk
onto the field. Love then arrested
Andres for violating California Penal
Code Section 148 — obstructing a
police officer in the discharge of his
duty.
Although the police had repeatedly
contacted the Athletic Department re
garding the white passes and had been
told several times that the passes were
invalid, it turned out that the passes
were in fact valid.
Several other photographers who
also had been detained by the police

were allowed to return to the field
after the validity of the passes was con
firmed sometime after Andres' arrest.
Andres was booked and then
released by the police. He returned to
the field and continued to take
photographs for the remainder of the
game.
Deputy District Attorney Karyn
Sinunu told the jury in the prosecu
tion's final remarks that Andres is not
charged with trespassing or using an
invalid pass, but with preventing a
police officer from doing his duty. She
told the jurors that regardless of the ac
tual validity of the passes, Love
believed they were invalid and was
simply trying to do his job and secure
the Stanford Stadium.
Andres should have cooperated with
Love and put aside his need to do his
own job of photographing the football
game, according to Sinunu. The law

gives a police officer the duty of detain
ing persons in connection with suspici
ous circumstances in order to investi
gate the situation and determine
whether or not a crime had been com
mitted. This is what Love was trying to
do and what Andres obstructed,
Sinunu said.
Andres' attorney, James Blackman of
Palo Alto, told the jury in his final
remarks that Andres had every reason
to be on the football field that day and
that Love did not have reasonable
cause to detain him. If Love had simply
called the director of Stanford Sports
Information as Andres had asked him
to, he would have found that the white
passes were indeed valid, Blackman
said.
While other Athletic Department of
ficials were contacted about the passes,
the director of Sports Information was
not.
