### 
NEW YORK (AP) — At least one
World Series game a year should be
played in daylight, Commissioner
Peter Ueberroth said yesterday, adding
he would try to convince the television
networks to cooperate.
Bleary-eyed baseball fans in the East,
youngsters who went to bed without
knowing the outcome of games and
the players who had to postpone their
postgame meals until nearly dawn all
complained about the late-night en

dings this year.
Two of the seven games between the
New York Mets and Boston Red Sox
ran past midnight, and others ended
close to midnight.
"I'd like to see, at least on the
weekend, one game played during the
day," Ueberroth said.
This was the second year in a row
that all Series games were played at
night.

Baseball's contracts with ABC and
NBC call for all weekday Series games
to be played at night and give the net
works the option of deciding when
weekend games should be piayed.
Ueberroth said in addition to talking
with network executives about
scheduling a weekend day game, he
will attempt to gain day games through
contract negotiations.
The current contracts do not expire
until 1989, but Ueberroth said, "We

may renegotiate. We may get to it a lit
tle earlier than that."
The commissioner also said that the
designated hitter arrangement he im
plemented for this year's World Series
would be continued. The DH was
allowed to hit for the pitcher in Bos
ton, the American League park, since
the DH is used only in the AL.
In previous Series, the DH was used
in alternate years but in both parks.
