PALM SPRINGS (AP) — Two major
league outfielders suffered minor in
juries in a fight with Native Americans
after making a wrong turn during a
road rally, authorities said.
Gary Pettis of the California Angels
and Lloyd Moseby of the Toronto Blue
Jays got into a fight Monday with six to
eight Native Americans, who said they
were trespassing on Agua Caliente
tribal land, said Riverside County
Sheriffs Sgt. Bob Doyle.
The players were in Palm Springs for
the AT&T Baseball Challenge, a hitting,
catching and fielding competition.
The Native Americans confronted
the players, who they said were on
property off-limits under the tribe's
agreement with the rally sponsors.
A fight broke out when Pettis and
Moseby refused to leave, and Moseby

was punched several times while Pettis
got a nick on the hand, possibly from a
knife, Doyle said.
Pettis went to Desert Hospital, but,
according to a nursing spokeswoman,
he was not treated or admitted.
Pettis would not comment on the in
cident when reached at his hotel room,
while Moseby couldn't be reached for
comment.
A short time later, Brett Butler and
Cory Snyder of the Cleveland Indians
arrived at the scene and got a rock
thrown through their car windshield,
Doyle said, adding that all the players
went back to their hotel bar and waited
a while before telephoning police.
By then, Doyle said, the Native
Americans were gone and their side of
the story could not be heard.
No criminal charges are anticipated.
