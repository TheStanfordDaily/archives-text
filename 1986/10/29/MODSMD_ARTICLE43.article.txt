# Carnoy leads Bradley Run from Oval to White Plaza
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
The Bradley Run for California
visited Stanford yesterday, led by
Education Prof. Martin Carney, who
ran the first portion of the run
though campus.
The relay covering the 1,100 miles
from San Diego to Sacramento is
being conducted to increase
statewide support for Democrat Tom
Bradley's gubernatorial campaign.
The run began on Oct. 18 and will
end on Nov. 4, the date of the elec
tion.
Bradley, currently mayor of Los
Angeles, is running against incum
bent George Deukmejian, who is
favored in most recent polls. Bradley
lost to Deukmejian, a Republican, in
the 1982 gubernatorial race.
According to an Oct. 20 Los An

geles Times poll, Deukmejian leads
Bradley by 51 percent to 41 percent,
with 8 percent undecided. This
represents a gain of five points for
Bradley since a September Times
poll, when the governor led Bradley
51 percent to 36 percent.
Participants in the run carried the
California state flag — the "baton"
used in the run — to the Oval, where
it was handed to Carnoy. The profes
sor, who lost to U.S. Rep. Ed Zschau
(R-Los Altos) in the 1984 election for
the 23rd congressional district, then
ran with the flag to White Plaza
where a small crowd watched him
pass it to Amanda Kemp, president of
the Black Student Union (BSU).
Kemp ran by Memorial Church
before returning to the Oval, where
Steve Phillips, former head of the
BSU, carried the flag off campus and
into Palo Alto.

Carnoy called the run a "good way
to draw attention to the (political)
race."
Speeches scheduled before the
run reached White Plaza were cur
tailed as Carnoy arrived 10 minutes
earlier than planned at 12:10.
Bradley's best campaign issue is
his charge that Deukmejian has mis
managed the cleanup of toxic dumps
and has sometimes sided with toxic
polluters who have contributed to
his campaign, the Times reported in
an article that appeared with the Oct.
20 poll.
The two big things going for the
governor are factors that often help
incumbent officeholders: leadership
and experience, the Times reported.
Deumejian has also been able to
translate his strong opposition to
controversial California Chief Justice
Rose Bird into large political gains.
