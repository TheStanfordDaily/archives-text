### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Former National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane last night
predicted that the Reagan adminis
tration's arms control policy of
"realism, strength and dialogue"
will result within six months in an
agreement to cut U.S. and Soviet
nuclear arsenals.
"Just because we've failed in pre
vious efforts at dialogue doesn't
mean we will fail next time," said
McFarlane, a scholar at the Center
for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington.
While most observers have called
the recent U.S.-Soviet summit
meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, a fail
ure because of disagreement on
U.S. space defense research,
McFarlane said the meeting laid the
groundwork for an agreement. For
the first time, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev agreed in principle to
the eventual elimination of all bal
listic missiles, said McFarlane, who
served as Reagan's adviser for two
years before resigning last Decem
ber.
"Iceland represents an opportu
nity that can be translated into con
crete measures that make for a bet
ter world," he told a crowd of about
200 at Terman Auditorium.
McFarlane said Reagan's
"realism, strength and dialogue"
policy, unveiled in a 1984 speech,
represents a watershed in U.S.-
Soviet relations because it success
fully reconciles polarized U.S. arms
control theories that have frustrated

past negotiations by prohibiting a
unified U.S. negotiating philosophy.
"Realism means we accept that
we and the Soviets disagree on
everything and possibly always
will," McFarlane said. "It is an ac
ceptance that we are in for a sus
tained confrontation with the Soviet
Union, and the responsibility of
leaders is to ensure that the compe
tition remains peaceful."
The Reagan administration wants
military strength because the Soviet
Union "respects and is deterred by"
U.S. military power, including the
Strategic Defense Initiative,
McFarlane said. Finally, he said,
continued U.S.-Soviet dialogue can
be a fruitful way for the United
States "to know its enemy" and to
negotiate mutually beneficial agree
ments on arms, human rights, citi
zen exchange programs and
regional conflicts.
Previous administrations have ap
proached arms control either with
Cold War or detente mentality,
McFarlane said. Reajgan's policy
assumes perpetual conflict, pan of
the Cold War viewpoint, but the ad
ministration also recognizes the
need for negotiation, which charac
terizes the detente outlook, he said.
Following this philosophy,
McFarlane said, the United States
should now wary of dramatic So
viet proposals but must proceed
opportunistically and quickly.
"The underlying basis of hope
since Reykjavik is that the Soviets
did indeed commit... to the elimi-
