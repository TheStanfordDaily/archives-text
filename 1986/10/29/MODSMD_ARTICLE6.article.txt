# Community group complains about Farm's plan for its land

### DIANE BISGEIER Staff writer 
A steady stream of reaction to Stanford's ambitious land
development plans has been channeled through an organ
ized group of area residents, producing vocal opposition
and lawsuits.
In a letter to the Times Tribune last week, the president of
Citizens for Sensible Planning (CSP) blasted the University' s
"lack of forthrightness in exposing to the public its long
range plans for development of its lands."
The letter also praised a recent court ruling that reim
burses CSP.for legal fees.the group paid in filing a lawsuit to
prevent the extension of Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real.
CSP is a group of about 500 area residents, most of them
from Menlo Park, whose purpose is to "maintain the quality
of life in the Peninsula and to promote a regional planning
concept," according to group member Robert Ekedahl.
The group formed about four years ago in response to a

University proposal to build Stanford West, a 1,100-unit
housing development that was to be located on a 46-acre
site near the Children's Hospital The project was delayed
due to conditions added to the proposal by the City of Palo
Alto.
About two years ago the group filed a lawsuit protesting
the extension of Sand Hill Road, arguing that the proposal
didn't conform to environmental laws. As a result of the law
suit, the University must file a new Environmental Impact
Report if it wants to continue the quest to lengthen Sand Hill
Road
"We would like Stanford to present a master plan for the
entire Willow Road corridor and get approval for the entire
project before they develop pieces of it," said Ekedahl The
letter, authored by CSP President J Gordon Teter, empha
sized the fact that the reimbursement of legal fees will allow
CSP "to continue to monitor development plans that pose a
threat to the environment and quality of life, as we know it
and enjoy it."

University Vice President of Public Affairs Robert Freelen
found the allegation of lack of forthrightness "interesting,
because we update our land-use plan frequently and we go
to pains to inform people in advance. Every project we do is
subject to lots and lots of public hearings For Palo Alto we
go through a full set of hearings which are actually advisory
for a full set of county hearings. There certainly is no
secrecy in whatever we do."
Freelen noted that in some instances where a project is
not yet formulated and where competition is involved, plans
would not be as exact because "you're only talking specula
tion."
Ekedahl said his group also wishes "to encourage growth
control ordinances including citizens initiatives where local
government is not acting responsibly and to monitor proj
ects that are not compatible with our quality of life."
Ekedahl said that the Environmental Impact Reports
(EIRs) filed by the University at the hearings look only at in
dividual projects, but disregard the impacts of the overall

development. Ekedahl also pointed to the possible political
pressures that might arise under the hearing process.
"We want an EIR for the whole darned thing," he said.
But, he added, that could be "political unacceptable" to
Stanford.
"We would like a master plan approved by all of the poli
tical bodies concerned. It'll show to the public that it will be
accepted," he said.
Among the developments listed in the letter as having
possible "adverse impacts on neighboring communities"
were the toxic waste disposal facility, the Reagan Library and
the "Hometel" at Sand Hill and Pasteur Drive, which was
described as "a suprisingly ugly example of the density and
style Stanford considers appropriate use of land "
CSP is primarily concerned with Stanford development
because, according to Ekedahl, "Stanford is one of the larg
est developers in the area. You couldn't find one as large
and as wealthy as they are.'
