Israeli nuclear expert missing
JERUSALEM — An Australian clergyman on the trail of former Israeli nu
clear technician Mordechai Vanunu said yesterday that his inquiries into
the fate of the missing man have been spurned repeatedly by government
officials and that he will leave Israel today.
The Rev. John McKnight, an Anglican priest who befriended Vanunu and
then converted him to Christianity in Sydney earlier this year, said that he
was still convinced that Vanunu, a former employee of Israel's top-secret
Dimona nuclear reactor complex, was being held in an Israeli prison,
reportedly in Gedera near the coast south of Tel Aviv.
Vanunu, who sold information to the London Sunday Times about Is
rael's nuclear program, disappeared on Sept. 30. There have been uncon
firmed press reports that he was abducted by agents of Mossad, the Israeli
security service, and brought here to face treason charges.
Based on data and more than 60 photographs supplied by Vanunu, the
Sunday Times reported early this month that Israel had been manufactur
ing atomic warheads for 20 years and that, with about 100 nuclear weapons
in a secret stockpile, Israel now ranks as the world's No. 6 nuclear power.
Israeli officials have refused to make any substantive comment on the
Sunday Times article or on the reports of Vanunu's abduction, although
they have confirmed that he is a former employee of the country's Atomic
Energy Commission.
Air Force wants 50 more MXs
WASHINGTON — While U.S. negotiators in Geneva are beginning to dis
cuss President Reagan's plan to eliminate all ballistic missiles over the next
10 years, the Air Force is preparing to ask the next Congress for 50 addi
tional MX intercontinental ballistic missiles and to approve development of
a new, two-warhead mobile ICBM, according to Pentagon and defense in
dustry sources.
Both systems have had problems getting congressional funding in the
past but "the Air Force is convinced that eventually Congress will see the
light," one retired senior Air Force officer said yesterday.
A top Defense Department official added that the Air Force will attempt
to sell its bigger, new mobile missile as an answer to the "threat of a
surprise deployment of a Soviet defensive system as we go down in num
bers of weapons."
Pentagon planners and defense contractors have also begun to study
other weapons that would play more important roles if ballistic missiles
are cut to zero. These include sea- and air-launched cruise missiles, con
ventional bombers and modernized defenses against such systems, sources
said.
Capitol Hill and non-government defense experts said yesterday that the
Air Force's plans for an additional 50 MX missiles and a mobile ICBM larger
than the Midgetman, a mobile missile favored by congressional Democrats,
will face strong opposition.
Sears will close World Trade Inc.
WASHINGTON — Sears, Roebuck & Co., the nation's biggest retailer,
said yesterday it will phase out Sears World Trade Inc., a Washington-based
unit that was created in 1982 to dominate import-export markets but in
stead has lost $60 million and been a constant corporate headache.
The decision entails the immediate dismantling of the trade operations
in the United States and will send the division's 300 U.S. workers scram
bling for new jobs. The unit's overseas operations, at least initially, will be
folded into Sears' merchandise division.
Sears said it will provide "job placement or job placement assistance" for
displaced workers. But company sources said that District of Columbia
workers who want to remain with Sears likely will have to move to its
headquarters in Chicago.
By closing the world trade unit, Sears is publicly admitting what many in
the company and on Wall Street have known for months. The unit, which
has lost $12 million so far this year, was a mistake for the retailing giant.
"In a nutshell, we didn't have the expertise," said a top Sears executive,
who spoke on the condition that he not be named. "This shows that maybe
we weren't as smart as we thought we were about world markets."
U.S. supports Syria sanctions
WASHINGTON — The United States government expressed disappoint
ment yesterday at the European Community's rebuff of Britain's call for
punitive sanctions against Syria, saying it is important for the international
community to send "a clear and unequivocal message" warning Syria
against support for international terrorism.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman, commenting on the 12-
nation EC's failure Monday to take action against Syria for its alleged com
plicity in a plot to smuggle explosives aboard an Israeli jetliner in London,
said:
"We are disappointed at the limited initial response indicated by the
(EC) statement. We believe it important that a clear and unequivocal
message be sent to the Syrian government on the necessity of abandoning
its support for terrorism. We note that the EC foreign ministers will meet
again on Nov. 10, at which time we hope they will consider this issue again.
And we hope for additional action at that time."
After Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's British government broke
diplomatic relations with Syria last Friday, President Reagan withdrew the
U.S. ambassador in Damascus as a sign of support. The State Department's
special ambassador for counterterrorism, L. Paul Bremer, also is in Western
Europe this week consulting with allied governments on possible further
steps, but the officials said that additional U.S. moves, if any, will not be
decided until after his return here this weekend.
The officials said privately that the EC action, while disappointing, was
not surprising since some EC members, notably France and Greece, have
strong reasons for maintaing good relations with Syria and were expected
to use the EC's requirement of decisions by consensus to block action.
Iraq sinks Iranian boats in Gulf
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq said yesterday that its fighter-bombers sank five
Iranian gunboats yesterday in an aerial-naval encounter in the northern
Persian Gulf as the boats tried to infiltrate Iraqi waters.
Iraq said army helicopters and navy units were involved in the action but
gave no other details beyond saying that a sixth Iranian vessel had escaped.
Meanwhile, an Arabic-language commentary broadcast over state-run
Tehran Radio warned Turkey that it may find itself embroiled in a new war
along the Iranian-Turkish-Iraqi borders unless it abandoned what the radio
described as greed in oil-rich northern Iraq.
The radio was referring to Turkish statements that Ankara had vital inter
ests in the oil province of Kirkuk, part of the restive Kurdistan province that
extends along the border territories of Iraq, Iran and Turkey.
"The daydreams in which Turkey's politicians are drowning will crash
on the tired internal Turkish situation when Turkish forces find themselves
in confrontation with the Iraqi people and (with) Iran's commitment to
these people," the commentary said.
Reagan campaigns in the South
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — During a campaign swing into the South that in
cluded a stop on behalf of a Republican freshman senator here whose race
has fallen into a dead heat, President Reagan yesterday predicted the nation
"Is headed for a second boom'' of economic growth.
' Just days ago we learned that the figure that represents the country's
economic growth — the GNP — and some other indicators show our eco
nomy gathering momentum for even more growth, higher take home pay
and more new jobs," Reagan told an airport rally for Sen. James Broyhill (R-
N.C.) that was a last-minute addition to his campaign schedule.
"In short, we're headed for a second boom,' Reagan said. "And I'm de
termined to see that those who are still not sharing fully in our nation's
prosperity will do so."
