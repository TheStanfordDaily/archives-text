# U.S. wants deep missile cuts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
has approved a package of proposals
for sharp reductions in U.S. and Soviet
strategic nuclear weapons and the
withdrawal of intermediate-range nu
clear missiles from Europe, adminis
tration officials said yesterday.
The package puts on die negotiating
table in Geneva the key proposals
Reagan made to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev at their summit in Iceland
earlier this month. It includes a ban on
all U.S. and Soviet ballistic missiles by
1996, said the officials, who were will
ing to discuss the subject only on the
condition they not be named publicly.
So far, Soviet negotiators have
resisted taking up seriously the
proposals Reagan discussed with the
Soviet Communist Party General Sec
retary on Oct. 11-12, said Kenneth
Adelman, director of the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency.
"It seems they have been under in
structions to be unhelpful since the
Reykjavik meeting," Adelman said in an
interview.

Adelman said separate talks would
be held with the Soviets next week in
Geneva on improving the verification
of underground nuclear tests. Reagan
told Gorbachev that better monitoring
procedures could lead to a treaty out
lawing all blasts.
A more modest U.S. arms control
package was sent to chief U.S.
negotiator Max Kampelman last week.
Several key items were held back, in
cluding the proposed ban on U.S. and
Soviet intermediate-range nuclear
missiles in Europe.
The U.S. military chiefs wanted to
consider first the impact that a missile
ban would have on defending Western
Europe from Soviet attack. NATO
ground forces are outmanned by War
saw Pact troops.
The discussion was held at the White
House Monday with Reagan presiding.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Adm. William Crowe, participated
and endorsed the package, the sources
said.
The new instructions were transmit

ted to Kampelman Monday night.
Spokesman Larry Speakes, accompa
nying Reagan on a political campaign
trip to the South yesterday confirmed
the meeting.
Reagan's proposal on strategic weap
ons calls for a 50 percent reduction in
U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers,
intercontinental ballistic missiles and
submarines within five years.
A ceiling of 1,600 would be imposed
on all U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear
delivery vehicles. Intercontinental bal
listic missiles and submarine-launched
missiles would be held to a total of
600. Strategic bombers would be lim
ited to 350 on each side.
The Soviets also have proposed a 50
percent cutback, but their formula and
the kind of nuclear weapons to be cov
ered by the reductions differ from the
U.S. approach. •
Reagan's call for a ban on ballistic
missiles by 1996 carries out the posi
tion U.S. officials said he took in talking
with Gorbachev. The Soviets contend,
however, that Reagan went further and

supported a ban on all strategic nu
clear forces.
A U.S. official, who said records of
the coi rsations between Reagan and
Gorbachev were still incomplete, ac
knowledged that Reagan "may have
said that at one point."
But he and another U.S. official
stressed that the president informed
Gorbachev on several occasions
during their talks that he sought a ban
only on ballistic missiles.
The U.S. proposal on Euromissiles
would require the dismantling of 108
Pershing 2 missiles in West Germany
and 32 cruise launchers, with 128 war
heads, in Britain, Italy and Belgium. All
are aimed at the Soviet Union.
The Soviets, meanwhile, would be
compelled to dismantle 270 SS-20
missiles, with 810 warheads, aimed at
Western Europe. Another 100 war
heads could remain in Asian ter
ritories, while the United States would
retain 100 warheads at home to match
them numerically.
