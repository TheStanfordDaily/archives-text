# FAA releases tapes of plane crash
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — The first description of disaster
was dispassionate, offered by an American Airlines
pilot passing 8,000 feet above the flames:
"OK. I see a, uh, very large, uh, smoke screen off
the left side of the aircraft...the pilot reported. "It
looks like ... something smoked up, ahead, and then
went down in."
Thus it was on Aug. 31 that a 35-year-old air traffic
controller confirmed what his radar screen had
already told him — an Aeromexico DC-9 had just
crashed while approaching Los Angeles International
Airport. Only after the passing pilot offered his
eyewitness account of the scene on the ground did
the controller stop trying to radio a jetliner whose
pilots and passengers were already dead, according
to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Yesterday, the FAA released a 14-minute tape
recording of the unidentified controller's radio com
munications with the pilot of the Aeromexico DC-9
and several other flyers. The terse, emotionless ex
changes occurred just before and after the Mexican
jetliner and a single-engine Piper Archer collided
over suburban Cerritos, killing 66 people in the two
planes and 15 on the ground.
The tape recording confirms the controller's previ
ous statements to investigators that the Piper Archer
apparently never appeared on his radar screen and
that he was unaware of its presence in the "terminal
control area" or TCA that surrounds Los Angeles In
ternational Airport. The tape also showed that there
was no radio contact between the controller and the
Piper Archer's pilot, William Kramer, who died in the
mid-air collision along with his wife and daughter.

For the next two minutes, the controller, who had
five years' experience with the FAA, devoted his time
and attention to two other in-bound commercial air
liners, giving both landing instructions and advising
them of other air traffic in the area.
While providing little new information about what
may have actually caused the tragedy, the recording
did confirm the FAA's contention that the unaut
horized presence of a third plane in the control area
occupied the controller's attention in what may have
been crucial moments before the collision.
FAA officials have announced plans to take action
against the pilot of that third plane, Roland Furman of
Buena Park, for allegedly violating the Los Angeles
control area. The agency intends to suspend his
pilot's license for 180 days.
Agency investigators have alleged that Furman, 55,
entered the control area about five miles north
northeast of where the mid-air collision occured.
Furman has requested an informal meeting with FAA
attorneys to discuss the allegations against him, FAA
spokesman Russ Park said yesterday.
According to the FAA's recording released yester
day, Aeromexico flight 498 first radioed Los Angeles
Approach Control at 11:47 a.m. on Aug. 31 with a
routine salutation.
The jetliner was given instructions to prepare for
landing on Runway 25 Left at Los Angeles Interna
tional. The Aeromexico pilots acknowledged the in
structions, routinely radioing, "Affirmative, two five
left runway."
At 11:50 a.m., the controller instructed Aeromexico
Flight 498 to reduce its airspeed to 210 knots, and the

jetliner complied. He then notified the Aeromexico
pilots of "traffic 10 o'clock, one mile northbound, al
titude unknown." (FAA officials said yesterday that
the advisory was intended to warn of another aircraft
which was not a factor in the mid-air collision.)
A minute later, the controller instructed Flight 498
to cut its speed by 20 knots and drop down from
7,000 feet to 6,000 feet. The Aeromexico pilots ac
knowledged the instructions by repeating them:
"One niner zero and then descend and maintain
6,000."
Eleven seconds after that, Furman radioed Ap
proach Control. He indicated that he had taken off
from Fullerton, was on a flight to Monterey and was
requesting "following" — an FAA air traffic informa
tion service for private pilots.
Before responding to Furman, the controller
radioed Flight 498, advising the Aeromexico pilots to
maintain their airspeed, alerting them that "we have
a change in plans, sir." The controller intended to let
Flight 498 switch its landing to another runway that
would bring it closer to Aeromexico's terminal
facilities, FAA officials said yesterday.
"Alright, we'll maintain one niner zero," the
Aeromexico pilots responded at 11:52 a.m.
It would be Flight 498's last broadcast.
Four seconds later, the controller advised Furman
to "remain clear of the TCA" Within the same min
ute, the controller radioed the Aeromexico pilots to
prepare for landing on another runway, 24 Right.
There was no response from the jetliner, accord
ing to the transcript. In practice, pilots are expected
to acknowledge such critical instructions.

landing on Runway 25 Left at Los Angeles Interna
tional. The Aeromexico pilots acknowledged the in
structions, routinely radioing, "Affirmative, two five
left runway."
At 11:50 a.m., the controller instructed Aeromexico
Flight 498 to reduce its airspeed to 210 knots, and the

jetliner complied. He then notified the Aeromexico
pilots of "traffic 10 o'clock, one mile northbound, al
titude unknown." (FAA officials said yesterday that
the advisory was intended to warn of another aircraft
which was not a factor in the mid-air collision.)
A minute later, the controller instructed Flight 498
to cut its speed by 20 knots and drop down from
7,000 feet to 6,000 feet. The Aeromexico pilots ac
knowledged the instructions by repeating them:
"One niner zero and then descend and maintain
6,000."
Eleven seconds after that, Furman radioed Ap
proach Control. He indicated that he had taken off
from Fullerton, was on a flight to Monterey and was
requesting "following" — an FAA air traffic informa
tion service for private pilots.
Before responding to Furman, the controller
radioed Flight 498, advising the Aeromexico pilots to
maintain their airspeed, alerting them that "we have
a change in plans, sir." The controller intended to let
Flight 498 switch its landing to another runway that
would bring it closer to Aeromexico's terminal
facilities, FAA officials said yesterday.
"Alright, we'll maintain one niner zero," the
Aeromexico pilots responded at 11:52 a.m.
It would be Flight 498's last broadcast.
Four seconds later, the controller advised Furman
to "remain clear of the TCA" Within the same min
ute, the controller radioed the Aeromexico pilots to
prepare for landing on another runway, 24 Right.
There was no response from the jetliner, accord
ing to the transcript. In practice, pilots are expected
to acknowledge such critical instructions.

LOS ANGELES — The first description of disaster
was dispassionate, offered by an American Airlines
pilot passing 8,000 feet above the flames:
"OK. I see a, uh, very large, uh, smoke screen off
the left side of the aircraft...the pilot reported. "It
looks like ... something smoked up, ahead, and then
went down in."
Thus it was on Aug. 31 that a 35-year-old air traffic
controller confirmed what his radar screen had
already told him — an Aeromexico DC-9 had just
crashed while approaching Los Angeles International
Airport. Only after the passing pilot offered his
eyewitness account of the scene on the ground did
the controller stop trying to radio a jetliner whose
pilots and passengers were already dead, according
to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Yesterday, the FAA released a 14-minute tape
recording of the unidentified controller's radio com
munications with the pilot of the Aeromexico DC-9
and several other flyers. The terse, emotionless ex
changes occurred just before and after the Mexican
jetliner and a single-engine Piper Archer collided
over suburban Cerritos, killing 66 people in the two
planes and 15 on the ground.
The tape recording confirms the controller's previ
ous statements to investigators that the Piper Archer
apparently never appeared on his radar screen and
that he was unaware of its presence in the "terminal
control area" or TCA that surrounds Los Angeles In
ternational Airport. The tape also showed that there
was no radio contact between the controller and the
Piper Archer's pilot, William Kramer, who died in the
mid-air collision along with his wife and daughter.

For the next two minutes, the controller, who had
five years' experience with the FAA, devoted his time
and attention to two other in-bound commercial air
liners, giving both landing instructions and advising
them of other air traffic in the area.
While providing little new information about what
may have actually caused the tragedy, the recording
did confirm the FAA's contention that the unaut
horized presence of a third plane in the control area
occupied the controller's attention in what may have
been crucial moments before the collision.
FAA officials have announced plans to take action
against the pilot of that third plane, Roland Furman of
Buena Park, for allegedly violating the Los Angeles
control area. The agency intends to suspend his
pilot's license for 180 days.
Agency investigators have alleged that Furman, 55,
entered the control area about five miles north
northeast of where the mid-air collision occured.
Furman has requested an informal meeting with FAA
attorneys to discuss the allegations against him, FAA
spokesman Russ Park said yesterday.
According to the FAA's recording released yester
day, Aeromexico flight 498 first radioed Los Angeles
Approach Control at 11:47 a.m. on Aug. 31 with a
routine salutation.
The jetliner was given instructions to prepare for
landing on Runway 25 Left at Los Angeles Interna
tional. The Aeromexico pilots acknowledged the in
structions, routinely radioing, "Affirmative, two five
