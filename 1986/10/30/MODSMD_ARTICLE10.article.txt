# Waldheim part of Nazi brutality
## 
### 
After denying for months that he had anything to
do with a 1942 Nazi operation that resulted in the
massacre of Yugoslav civilians in a mountainous area
called Kozara, Kurt Waldheim has acknowledged that
he did take part in the operation, a brutal
"pacification" effort at the height of World War 11.
A spokesman for Waldheim said in the course of
several telephone interviews that the Austrian presi
dent did serve in the Kozara area, in the western part
of Yugoslavia's province of Bosnia, in the spring and
summer of 1942, hut that he was a "supply officer"
not engaged in the fighting.
In a 13-page memo Waldheim's son presented to
The Washington Post last April, Waldheim emphati
cally denied that he was in the Kozara area during the
spring and summer of 1942.
Waldheim's spokesman, Gerold Christian, said that
"additional research" now has revealed that

Waldheim's earlier statement was incorrect.
The formal indictment of Waldheim, obtained by
The Post, was based on charges by other Austrians
who fought with the Nazis, several of whom were
later executed as war criminals themselves.
Waldheim's acknowledged participation in the
Kozara operation raises new questions about his
wartime role. Records show that Lt. Kurt Waldheim
was a member of the command staff of 29 men under
Gen. Friedrich von Stahl, the Nazi commander at
Kozara.
German reports list Waldheim among 34 men in
the German army singled out for meritorious service
in the Kozara campaign.
In his earlier statements, Waldheim had insisted
that the Kozara operation did not involve a massacre
of the local population. "That's nonsense," he was
quoted by the Belgrade newspaper Vecernje Novosti

as saying. "There was no massacre, there were fierce
battles."
Documents exist that might be able to clear up
questions about Waldheim's role in the operation.
Historian Vladimir Dedijer, who is chairman of the
Genocide Commission of the Serbian Academy of
Sciences, said he has 242 documents about the
Kozara operation, some of them implicating
Waldheim.
Dedijer said he had turned over the Kozara docu
ments to the International War Crimes Tribunal. The
Tribunal has formed an Executive Committee on
Kurt Waldheim in London, and has formally asked
the Austrian government for permission to hold a
public tribunal in Vienna. The tribunal declined to
make the documents available to The Washington
Post.
