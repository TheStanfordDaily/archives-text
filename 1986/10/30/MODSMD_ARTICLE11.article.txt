# Prosecution of Hasenfus begins
## 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua â€” A govern
ment prosecutor yesterday opened the
case against U.S. mercenary Eugene
Hasenfus by presenting documents
found after Sandinista troops shot
down his contra supply plane.
The prosecutor handed evidence
one piece at a time to the court secre
tary, including a card Nicaraguan auth
orities say gave Hasenfus access to
restricted areas of Ilopango military
airport in El Salvador.
Neither Hasenfus nor his Nicaraguan
lawyer, Enrique Sotelo Borgen, was in

court. Presentation of evidence by the
prosecution and defense to the special
political tribunal trying the first Ameri
can captured in Nicaragua's four-year
war was to last eight to 12 days.
Hasenfus' lawyer told The Associ
ated Press in a telephone interview that
once the prosecution presents its case,
the tribunal has to notify him in writing
so he can respond in writing. It was not
clear whether he would be allowed to
present defense arguments in person.
Hasenfus, a former Marine from
Marinette, Wis., is charged with ter

rorism, conspiracy and violating public
security. If convicted by the three
member tribunal, he could face up to
30 years in prison.
The card that purportedly gave
the captured mercenary access to
restricted areas of Ilopango was num
bered 4422, was made out to Hasenfus
and bore the Salvadoran air force
emblem.
The card, issued July 28 with an ex
piration date of Jan. 28, 1987, read
"Group: USA" and "Specialty: Adviser."
On the reverse, under "Restricted

areas," was a list of numbers.
In Washington, the State Department
contended that Hasenfus has been
denied due process.
State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said the Sandinistas
are not interested in justice but rather
in a "show trial."
Hasenfus has said he worked for
Corporate Air Services, which has the
same Miami address as a company for
merly owned by the CIA, Southern Air
Transport.
