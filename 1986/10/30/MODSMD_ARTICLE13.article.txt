### ANDREA ARNOLD 
There is an almost exclusive concentration by the
West on the worst aspects of modern Africa despite
the great advances that have been made on that con
tinent, according to a Rutgers University associate
professor who discussed African influences on West
ern culture Tuesday night.
Ivan Van Sertima, associate professor ot African
studies at Rutgers, continued the Western Culture vs.
World Culture debate in a lecture sponsored by the
ASSU, the Black Student Union and the Stanford
African Students Association (SASA).
In his introduction to the speech, SASA President
George Miessi said the Western Culture Program,
which is required of every Stanford undergraduate,
is "doing a disservice to Stanford students" by ex
cluding the contributions of women and minorities
from the curriculum.
He quoted the new film series "Africans" as one of
the worst examples of this, since it shows only
disease and starvation in primitive villages. He said,

"You cannot take studies of little primitive tribes and
have a representation of the capacity and potential of
a civilization."
Sertima said his goal was to present the ac
complishments of African civilization. "We get a dis
torted picture of the African as a man of no science
and no great metaphysics," he said.
Sertima cited historical examples of African ac
complishments and its effects on the Western world.
According to recent archaeological findings, he said,
modern man was born in Africa.
He listed many African discoveries that pre dated
equivalent European findings. Among these were ac
curate astronomical charts and calendars, processes
of mummification, nautical instruments and medical
discoveries, such as vaccination.
Africans were the first to develop an atomic theory,
a heliocentric theory and ideas about gravity, accord
ing to Sertima.
The reason why so little remains of African science
and metaphysics, said Sertima, is because of a fire at
the library of Alexandria and attempts to burn all

lxx)ks in the Arabic language, which the Africans
used. According to Sertima, more than 4,000 texts
were destroyed.
"We have no sense of what happened in Africa,"
said Sertima. However, he presented several exam
ples of how African civilization has influenced West
ern culture.
He noted that Isaac Newton had a "great depth of
knowledge from Egypt," and that Pythagoras spent 20
years there. In addition, he said, "The Greeks
borrowed almost word for word from their
(Egyptian) medical texts."
Sertima said Africans had a great influence on
Europe, especially during the Moor invasions. "The
Moors brought lxx)ks from China, India and Tim
buktu and brought them into Europe," he said. They
also brought new crops and extensive trade, accord
ing to Sertima.
Sertima concluded by saying "we can't get away
with not having courses in African history" because
students interest in non-Western cultures is on the
rise.
