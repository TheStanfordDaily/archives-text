A common criticism of Stanford is that it has an "anti
intellectual" atmosphere. Recent changes in the hours at
Meyer Library' only add substance to this claim.
The University has asked Meyer to cut its expenditures
by 2 percent. Consequently, the library now opens at 11
a.m. on weekends, two hours later than its previous
opening time of 9 a.m. It closes every day at midnight.
According to extensive statistics produced over the
past two years, the eliminated hours between 9 and 11
a.m. are the ones during which the least number of Stan
ford students use the library. There is about a three-to
one ratio of Stanford students to non-Stanford students
in Meyer during these hours.
But that is not the point. Some people prefer to use
the library during this time to avoid the rush that usually
occurs after 1 p.m. Shortening hours merely contributes
to the rush and causes a hassle for the students.
Why promote the "anti-intellectual" spirit by cutting li
brary hours for those people who really are interested in
learning? Many of these people have nowhere else to go
when their neighbor's stereo gets too loud or the
temptation to socialize becomes too ereat. None of the

other campus libraries — including Green — even offer
Meyer's limited hours.
In addition, it is doubtful that these shortened hours
contribute much to the 2 percent budget cut. In fact, it is
doubtful that this 2 percent budget cut in the libaries is
going to save the University a considerable amount of
money.
The intentions of the University were good — after all,
spending beyond one's means can do a lot of harm. Yet
misplaced budget cuts can do just as much, if not more,
damage.
It would benefit Stanford more if library hours were
expanded rather than shortened. Since Meyer is easily
accessible by most Stanford students, it is the logical
choice for longer hours.
Stanford provides a lot of services that are not nor
mally found in other universities. Yet even some of these
universities manage to keep their libraries open until
two and three in the morning. A university that prides it
self on producing top-quality students should provide
the facilities these students need to retain their status.
