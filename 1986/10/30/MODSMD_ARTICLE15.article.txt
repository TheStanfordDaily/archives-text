# Small change at Stanford
## 
### 15,807.00. It blows my mind 
Fifteen thousand eight hundred and seven dollars. What
we need here is a proper perspective, some kind of
framework through which we can deal with this five-digit
figure commonly known as tuition and fees.
First, note that $15,807 doesn't include textbook costs and
living expenses. Those extra costs would amount to roughly
$2,000 a year, but we're not going to worry about them.
Now, let's try dividing $15,807 by the number of school days
in the academic year 1986-87. Excluding Thanksgiving
recess, Christmas vacation and spring break, we have 228
school days in the year. Keep in mind that these 228 days in
clude Saturdays, Sundays, Martin Luther King Day, Presi
dents' Day, Memorial Day, June 3 and finals week. According
to this conservative estimate, a day at Stanford costs about
$69 33. That comes out to roughly 4.8 cents per minute. That
is, whether we're studying, jogging, suntanning, sleeping,
eating a pizza, talking with a friend or biking to the Quad,
we're spending about a nickel a minute on the average.

If a nickel a minute doesn't sound all that bad to you, let
me try a different approach. I'll just take a look at tuition and
try to show how expensive it can get at Stanford. As every
one might have noticed during registration, the tuition for
fall quarter is $3,736. Suppose you're sufficiently motivated
to take 16 units for this quarter. Dividing the tuition by the
number of units yields $233-50. Since a five-unit class
usually meets five times a week for the 10 weeks of the quar
ter, each lecture costs $23 35.
The implications are profound. If you skip a lecture,
you're wasting $23 35. If you doze off for 10 minutes during
a lecture, that sleep will cost you $4.67. If you're reading
The Daily right now, inside your classroom, you might want
to put the paper away and pay attention to your professor.
For those who have the courage to read on, well, read on.
Even taking a three-hour final costs more than $70. And if
you drop a five-unit class, that's $1,167.50 down the drain.
By now, I can hear some people muttering, "Thanks a lot,
Phil. This is exactly what I need after bombing my midterms,
man."
I'm sorry. I just wanted to point out some facts.
Out of these disturbing facts arise several important ques
tions: Why are we here? What's the justification for paying so
much money to attend this school? Are we getting our
money's worth? I tend to get a little philosophical whenever
my checking account balance goes down by more than
$1,000 at a time, and, after paying tuition, some random
thoughts always cross my mind.
It seems so absurd: I pay huge sums of money to get ed
ucated, but I don't really enjoy doing all the tedious work.
My job over the summer was also somewhat tedious, but I
got paid to do the work — other than at school, have you
ever paid to do something you really didn't like? I mean
who enjoys studying for tests, taking exams and finishing up
problem sets late at night? As one of my high school teach
ers once said, perhaps education is something that everyone
is willing to pay for, but no one wants to get. Or, what
people call "education" might be just an expensive means
to attain a diploma and enter the Success Track.
And while real education takes a back seat, madness
abounds. The scene is all too familiar: blue books, report
cards, "encouraging" letters from parents and libraries
packed with people too busy to think about what they are

doing. It's a scene that is vividly described by Darieck
Scott (Class of '86) in his final column (Daily, May 19).
Looking back on his Stanford experience, he recalls: "In my
freshman year... I was not a human being.... I was instead
a studying automaton, in the library at 7 p.m. and out by 11
p.m— I read all my Western Culture books. At one point I
was ahead by a week in my Poli Sci readings." He then ob
serves: "The mistake I made during my non-human years
was not simply that I studied too much, or that I failed to un
derstand that a good portion of any education takes place
outside the confines of the library.... My mistake was that I
studied too much without knowing why." Studying too
much without knowing why — this seems to be a mistake
many students make. Whenever I see panic-stricken pre
meds (somewhat redundant), I wonder whether it's really
worth it to live on caffeine and study for tests that will have
little meaning to anybody in 10 years. (And these are the
people who are going to be treating your ulcers in the
future.)
Now, some people might argue that all those long and
hideous tests are conventional and necessary steps we must
take to get to the promised land; they might add that sacrific
ing the present to prepare for a bright future is a reasonable
strategy. The key word here is "future" — although you're
suffering now, if you persevere and work hard enough, your
future will be bright. This magic word seems to go hand-in
hand with the kind of logic that was preached so effectively
over the history of the Western world: Although your life on
this earth is miserable, if you work hard, obey the authori
ties and believe in God, you'll attain salvation — after your
death.
Don't get fooled by the talks about the bright future. You
might be missing a major part of the invaluable education
that Stanford offers. Call me a dreamer, but I believe Stan
ford is a place for experimentation, self-discovery and per
sonal growth, not the starting point for the rat race. And,
after spending two years here, I feel I have only one piece of
advice to offer: If you have a goal that you believe is worth
all the toil and effort, go for it; otherwise, learn to relax first
and take some time to find out what you really like. Either
way, you'll be paying $15,807 for doing what you want to do,
not what you have to do.
Find out what you really like and do what you want to do
— I know it's a cliche, but I can't see any other justification
for paying so much money to go here. After all, once you
pay the tuition, the money is gone forever whether you have
a great time at Stanford or not. It seems extremely unwise to
turn the four years at Stanford into one of the most grueling
periods in your life and pay more than $60,000 for the pain
ful experience. If you're going to pay that much money, you
might as well enjoy what you're doing here. For instance, if
your 9 a.m. lecture instantly puts you to sleep, stay at home
and do something more productive. Also, although
$1,167.50 is a steep price, ask yourself whether it's worth it
to put yourself under a severe mental strain just to pass the
course. If the answer is yes, work on and do your best; if not,
drop the course. Hopefully, you'll be more careful in choos
ing your courses for the next quarter and learn more about
your real interests and yourself from this experience.
Having finished commenting on the tuition, I guess I
could go on and talk about the room and board fees, but
discussing the food and housing situation at Stanford isn't
going to make anybody's day any brighter. If you really want
to know, the room rates in addition to the 14-meal plan for
the year come out to $4,700. If you have the time and the
desire, you can carry out calculations on your own. As for
me, I'm quitting now.
By the way, I've spent seven hours on this article, doing
calculations, typing in warped ideas and having second
thoughts about the whole thing. For this effort, I'll be paid
$0.00 — but I love this job.

Fifteen thousand eight hundred and seven dollars. What
we need here is a proper perspective, some kind of
framework through which we can deal with this five-digit
figure commonly known as tuition and fees.
First, note that $15,807 doesn't include textbook costs and
living expenses. Those extra costs would amount to roughly
$2,000 a year, but we're not going to worry about them.
Now, let's try dividing $15,807 by the number of school days
in the academic year 1986-87. Excluding Thanksgiving
recess, Christmas vacation and spring break, we have 228
school days in the year. Keep in mind that these 228 days in
clude Saturdays, Sundays, Martin Luther King Day, Presi
dents' Day, Memorial Day, June 3 and finals week. According
to this conservative estimate, a day at Stanford costs about
$69 33. That comes out to roughly 4.8 cents per minute. That
is, whether we're studying, jogging, suntanning, sleeping,
eating a pizza, talking with a friend or biking to the Quad,
we're spending about a nickel a minute on the average.

If a nickel a minute doesn't sound all that bad to you, let
me try a different approach. I'll just take a look at tuition and
try to show how expensive it can get at Stanford. As every
one might have noticed during registration, the tuition for
fall quarter is $3,736. Suppose you're sufficiently motivated
to take 16 units for this quarter. Dividing the tuition by the
number of units yields $233-50. Since a five-unit class
usually meets five times a week for the 10 weeks of the quar
ter, each lecture costs $23 35.
The implications are profound. If you skip a lecture,
you're wasting $23 35. If you doze off for 10 minutes during
a lecture, that sleep will cost you $4.67. If you're reading
The Daily right now, inside your classroom, you might want
to put the paper away and pay attention to your professor.
For those who have the courage to read on, well, read on.
Even taking a three-hour final costs more than $70. And if
you drop a five-unit class, that's $1,167.50 down the drain.
By now, I can hear some people muttering, "Thanks a lot,
Phil. This is exactly what I need after bombing my midterms,
man."
I'm sorry. I just wanted to point out some facts.
Out of these disturbing facts arise several important ques
tions: Why are we here? What's the justification for paying so
much money to attend this school? Are we getting our
money's worth? I tend to get a little philosophical whenever
my checking account balance goes down by more than
$1,000 at a time, and, after paying tuition, some random
thoughts always cross my mind.
It seems so absurd: I pay huge sums of money to get ed
ucated, but I don't really enjoy doing all the tedious work.
My job over the summer was also somewhat tedious, but I
got paid to do the work — other than at school, have you
ever paid to do something you really didn't like? I mean
who enjoys studying for tests, taking exams and finishing up
problem sets late at night? As one of my high school teach
ers once said, perhaps education is something that everyone
is willing to pay for, but no one wants to get. Or, what
people call "education" might be just an expensive means
to attain a diploma and enter the Success Track.
And while real education takes a back seat, madness
abounds. The scene is all too familiar: blue books, report
cards, "encouraging" letters from parents and libraries
packed with people too busy to think about what they are

doing. It's a scene that is vividly described by Darieck
Scott (Class of '86) in his final column (Daily, May 19).
Looking back on his Stanford experience, he recalls: "In my
freshman year... I was not a human being.... I was instead
a studying automaton, in the library at 7 p.m. and out by 11
p.m— I read all my Western Culture books. At one point I
was ahead by a week in my Poli Sci readings." He then ob
serves: "The mistake I made during my non-human years
was not simply that I studied too much, or that I failed to un
derstand that a good portion of any education takes place
outside the confines of the library.... My mistake was that I
studied too much without knowing why." Studying too
much without knowing why — this seems to be a mistake
many students make. Whenever I see panic-stricken pre
meds (somewhat redundant), I wonder whether it's really
worth it to live on caffeine and study for tests that will have
little meaning to anybody in 10 years. (And these are the
people who are going to be treating your ulcers in the
future.)
Now, some people might argue that all those long and
hideous tests are conventional and necessary steps we must
take to get to the promised land; they might add that sacrific
ing the present to prepare for a bright future is a reasonable
strategy. The key word here is "future" — although you're
suffering now, if you persevere and work hard enough, your
future will be bright. This magic word seems to go hand-in
hand with the kind of logic that was preached so effectively
over the history of the Western world: Although your life on
this earth is miserable, if you work hard, obey the authori
ties and believe in God, you'll attain salvation — after your
death.
Don't get fooled by the talks about the bright future. You
might be missing a major part of the invaluable education
that Stanford offers. Call me a dreamer, but I believe Stan
ford is a place for experimentation, self-discovery and per
sonal growth, not the starting point for the rat race. And,
after spending two years here, I feel I have only one piece of
advice to offer: If you have a goal that you believe is worth
all the toil and effort, go for it; otherwise, learn to relax first
and take some time to find out what you really like. Either
way, you'll be paying $15,807 for doing what you want to do,
not what you have to do.
Find out what you really like and do what you want to do
— I know it's a cliche, but I can't see any other justification
for paying so much money to go here. After all, once you
pay the tuition, the money is gone forever whether you have
a great time at Stanford or not. It seems extremely unwise to
turn the four years at Stanford into one of the most grueling
periods in your life and pay more than $60,000 for the pain
ful experience. If you're going to pay that much money, you
might as well enjoy what you're doing here. For instance, if
your 9 a.m. lecture instantly puts you to sleep, stay at home
and do something more productive. Also, although
$1,167.50 is a steep price, ask yourself whether it's worth it
to put yourself under a severe mental strain just to pass the
course. If the answer is yes, work on and do your best; if not,
drop the course. Hopefully, you'll be more careful in choos
ing your courses for the next quarter and learn more about
your real interests and yourself from this experience.
Having finished commenting on the tuition, I guess I
could go on and talk about the room and board fees, but
discussing the food and housing situation at Stanford isn't
going to make anybody's day any brighter. If you really want
to know, the room rates in addition to the 14-meal plan for
the year come out to $4,700. If you have the time and the
desire, you can carry out calculations on your own. As for
me, I'm quitting now.
By the way, I've spent seven hours on this article, doing
calculations, typing in warped ideas and having second
thoughts about the whole thing. For this effort, I'll be paid

to know, the room rates in addition to the 14-meal plan for
the year come out to $4,700. If you have the time and the
desire, you can carry out calculations on your own. As for
me, I'm quitting now.
By the way, I've spent seven hours on this article, doing
calculations, typing in warped ideas and having second
thoughts about the whole thing. For this effort, I'll be paid
$0.00 — but I love this job.
