Kennedy's views
misrepresented
Two accounts of my views about
South Africa and divestment appeared
in yesterday's issue of The Daily, and
both contained a number of inac
curacies
The first was a news story about my
quarterly appearance before the ASSU
Senate Those inaccuracies involved a
statement in the picture caption to the
effect that I thought Stanford had
influenced IBM and GM to disinvest,
and an attribution to me of the view
that the companies had been led to
disinvest because they wished a transi
tion from equity to debt (the latter
may be a result, but certainly is not a
cause).
These errors were easy to detect

and make right, because a lot 01
people were there and heard what I
had to say. On numbers of occasions
of this kind, I am on the record, any
thing I say is properly open to analysis
and contradiction, and the nature of
the forum provides an opportunity to
verify what went on.
Things are a little different on my
morning run to the Dish Anyone is
welcome to show up, and we talk
about everything under the sun —
with a tacit understanding of the
privacy that exists among companions
and friends. Once a few years ago a
reporter did come, but it didn't work
out very well. So there isn't a "record"
of what gets said up there, and it
never ocurred to me that we might
need one.
Until Wednesday morning. Jeff
Lowenstein — who now identifies
himself as a member of SOSA, since
he showed up in that capacity in my

office for a meeting that took place
after our run — writes of a conversa
tion he and i had on our way down
from the Dish. Some of it I recognize.
I did become annoyed after he ques
tioned both the honesty and
credibility of me and some of the
trustees, and 1 did advise him (though
in less dramatic terms than he
reports) that questioning the motives
of others is a poor way to begin per
suading them of your views. He ap
pears completely to have misun
derstood my attempt to divorce
evaluations of divestment pace from
traditional right/left analyses of the
political spectrum, and my statement
that "some people say just about
anything" did not apply, as he sug
gests, to the CIR report. And so on.
Perhaps, as he suggests in another
part of his colorful account, 1 was
difficult to understand because I was
breathing so hard.

,\inj die difficulty of gelling the
record straight, of course, is that there
is no record. Perhaps that suggests
something about the nature of occa
sions and the use we make of them. If
people's statements are to be held up
to public scrutiny and employed for
the purpose of influencing or making
public policy, then we ought to obtain
those views under conditions that
encourage care, give fair warning of
the use to which statements are put
and permit verification. The Dish run,
fine though it is in many ways, meets
none of these criteria.
So by all means come back, Jeff, and
we'll do it again. But next time tell me
who you represent, tell me if you're a
reporter, and tell me if it's an inter
view Then I can decide whether we
should run to the Dish or talk with a
tape recorder.
