# Proposition 63 necessary
## 
### 
Like all political systems, the Ameri
can one has advantages and dis
advantages. One of the latter is that
elections are often decided by
minorities, usually vocal and
sometimes violent. The desperate
office-seeker tries to placate them,
regardless of the merits of the issue.
This is indeed the tyranny of the
minorities.
Thus it is that, while a strong
majority of Californians support
Proposition 63, making English the of
ficial language of the state, some
leading politicians have come out
against it, essentially because they want
the votes of the minorities. Of course,
they give other reasons.

The California referendum system is
now under attack because it puts
decision-making on complex issues in
the power of uninformed people. The
California ballot pamphlet (pp. 46-47)
gives a balanced presentation of the ar
guments for and against Proposition
63. I wonder how many of the
"Hispanics" who oppose it have done
their homework? There have been dis
graceful scenes in which groups of
them have shouted down and insulted
those in favor of the amendment.
Those who have used our campuses
for such activities are trying to lower
our universities to the level of those of
Latin America. This commentary is in
tended as a contribution to the rational
discussion of the subject.
Some years ago my wife and I were
driving through Mexico on the Pan
American Highway. Workmen were
busy tearing down signs in English
saying "Dangerous Curve," "Railroad
Crossing," etc. When I asked why, I was
told that the language of Mexico is
Spanish. I commented that tearing
down the signs could lead to an in
crease in accidents because many of
the motorists were "American." No
matter, came the defiant retort: "Aqui
estamos en Mexico!" (This is Mexico!)
Had a non-Mexican shouted down and
insulted this assertion of linguistic
sovereignty, he would have been ex
pelled under article 33 of the Mexican
constitution.
Senator Sam Hayakawa, the founder
of U.S. English, is a professional lin
guist, and his opinion is significant. He
was born in Vancouver, Canada, and so
had first-hand experience of the
divisiveness resulting from lack of lin
guistic unity. I myself taught French at
the University of British Columbia in
Vancouver and confirm

Hayakawa's assessment. The English
speakers of Western Canada deeply
resent having to operate in two lan
guages. Bilingualism does not create
harmony. It leads to duplication, the
expenditures of money which could
better be spent elsewhere, and confu
sion, since both languages have official
status, with serious legal conse
quences. The Canadian linguistic di
chotomy is a problem Canada was
born with. Why should California im
port a problem it can avoid?
An even more acute problem exists
in Belgium, and, like Canada, Belgium
was born with the problem. The
Flemings tear down road signs in
French, creating a chaos much worse
than that in Canada, since cities often
have two names: Liege and Luik, leper
and Ypres, Mons and Berg. Only one
who has lived through the Belgian ex
perience can realize how bitter
feelings are and how tragically gro
tesque the consequences. A linguistic
line was drawn across Belgium. The
French-speaking University of Lovain
(Leuven) is just north of the line, in the
Flemish-speaking zone. So a parallel
university was set up just across the
line. The new University of Louvain is
French-speaking, the old university
now speaks Flemish. There is duplica
tion of courses that attract few stu
dents. For example, there are two Por
tuguese programs, one for French
speakers, one for Flemish speakers.
The impact of this duplication on the
university budget is severe. Even
worse has been the impact on the li
braries. When the new university was
set up, it was allowed to take half of the
books. So, of a 20-volume encyclope
dia, 10 went south, 10 stayed in the old
university library. The librarians them
selves were appalled, but they said this
solution has been imposed on them by
politicans. The capital, Brussels, has a
special status, and the language an
tagonism is such that it has been pro
posed that English become its official
language.
It is widely and incorrectly assumed
that Switzerland is a country where
people speaking four different lan
guages live in happy linguistic har
mony. In fact, the linguistic resent
ments are serious. In 1978 the French
speaking area of predominantly
German-speaking Bern broke off and
formed a new canton, Jura. The Swiss
are a highly educated people, but few
are fluent in one or more of the lan
guages other than their own. When I
discussed Swiss problems with the
editor of the Gazette de Lausanne, I
was surprised that he said the most
serious is language, and that it is be
coming more acute. The main lan

guage is German, spoken by 65 per
cent of the population. They resent the
hostility to the German language ex
pressed by the 18 percent French
speaking part of the population. The
editor said more and more corres
pondence between German and
French Switzerland is being conducted
in English.
Perhaps the worst case of the
tyranny of a linguistic minority is South
Africa, whose lingua franca is English.
One of the main causes of the unrest
that is wrecking the country was the
imposition of the Afrikaans' language
by Boer politicians representing a
small minority of the population.
South Africa used to be a beautiful
country, as was Lebanon. Nations can
easily fall apart, and some
Sovietologists think the Soviet Union
will fall apart, one cause being linguis
tic antagonisms. Moscow hopes that
ethnic and linguistic divisions will lead
to the breakup of the United States,
and it is doing all it can to exacerbate
those divisions.
The fact is that, whether the French
and the Hispanics like it or not, English
is becoming the world language. It
unites the world: At the 1985 interna
tional meeting of women in Nairobi, a
huge affair, the common language was
English. Only the Latin Americans shut
themselves out. As one report said,
"they kept to their linguistic ghetto."
English unites nations. The 1986 Nobel
Prize in literature was won by a
Nigerian, Wole Soyinka. When he was
asked why he wrote in English, he
replied that English is the language
that holds Nigeria together; without it,
Nigeria and some other countries
could fall apart.
Hayakawa is a linguist of Japanese
ethnicity. I myself am a professor of
languages, and, as editor of the World
Affairs Report, 1 have to operate in a
number of languages. We are both
strong supporters of the study of
foreign languages. However, we are
also both, because of our experiences,
acutely aware of the divisive danger
presented by the present linguistic
confusion in California. Politicians who
oppose Proposition 63 are motivated
by electoral considerations. Unwit
tingly, they are playing into Moscow's
hands. Soviet propaganda uses every
possible device to weaken the glue that
holds the American ethnic mosaic to
gether. A major ingredient in that glue
is the English language. A politician is
one who thinks of the next election, a
statesman one who thinks of the next
generation. Let us be statesmen, not
politicians.
