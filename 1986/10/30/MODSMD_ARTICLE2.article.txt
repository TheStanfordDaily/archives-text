# AIDS protein is identified

A team of researchers led by Dr. Edgar Engleman, an as
sociate professor of pathology at Stanford Medical School,
has identified a protein contained in the AIDS virus which is
responsible for at least some of the virus infection and cell
death in patients suffering from the disease.
The "envelope protein," the component found in
Engleman's research, is one of many proteins in the AIDS
virus.
The discovery "is not too surprising because the en
velope protein covers the outside of the virus, but it had
never been proven before," Engleman said.
The discovery has led to insights and a new dilemma con
cerning the way the AIDS virus operates.
"The good news is that we now know which protein we
have to focus our efforts on to develop a good vaccine,
namely the envelope protein," Engleman said.
Even in the absence of the AIDS virus, injection of the en
velope protein into the body can lead to cell death.
"That's bad news because many investigators have been
looking at the possiblity of using the envelope protein by it
self as a vaccine," Engleman said.
"But we're still hoping that the envelope protein can be
used safely in a vaccine," he said, adding that researchers
plan to test the protein for use in a vaccine in the near
future.
The principle behind a vaccine is to use a substance as
nearly identical as possible to the original, offending an or
ganism in order to activate the immune system and build up
a defense against the original organism.
"In the case of AIDS, clearly the immune system is the tar
get in the first place and is destroyed before it can do any
thing about the infection," Engleman said.
The study was conducted by researchers from the Stan
ford University School of Medicine and four other institu
tions.
The discovery of the envelope protein's role is important
to an understanding of AIDS regardless of whether the
protein can be used as'TvacCTrt<?7Etig!eman said.
The envelope protein attaches itself to a particular
molecule in an immune cell and then interacts with this
molecule, causing infection and possibly a fusion of cells
known as "giant cells" that die.
"We've proposed that this all happens inside the infected
person's body," Engleman said.
One unusual aspect of the AIDS virus is that it takes a
relatively long time to kill the cells, according to Engleman.
"Lots of viruses kill cells immediately. The strange thing
about this virus is that it takes ... days or weeks," he said.
"And until the immune cell dies, it looks fairly happy.
Then all of a sudden in the test tube you see these giant
cells, and they die."
Other institutions participating in the study are the Na
tional Cancer Institute, Gene Labs, Inc., the National In
stitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Chiron
Corporation.
