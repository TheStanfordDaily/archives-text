They get letters:
A graduate student in geology at
Oregon State University in Corvallis,
Oregon, wrote to the Daily Barometer
to make a correction: "Rep. Danny
Smith was quoted as saying: 'The
(Columbia) Gorge isn't going to go
away. It has been there for a thousand
years.' The corrected statement should
read: 'The gorge isn't going to go away.
It has been there for 13 million
years.'"
In case you were wondering.
They have frats:
"On Thursday afternoon, those
princes of Phun, that neato bunch of
guys from the Phi Gamma Delta house,
demonstrated the admirable qualities
of brotherhood, social service and con
cern for society by hurling water and
balloons at Earth Firsters and others
protesting Burger King's policies of
destroying the rain forest," wrote a
rather sarcastic person to the Daily
Texan.
The incident seemed to
strike a responsive chord at the Univer
sity of Texas, Austin. Another reader
was caught in the crossfire of water
balloons and insults.
"Fraternity members, who were
throwing water bombs from the roof
of the house noticed that I was 'one of
them' and decided to 'get the bitch'

and then proceeded to throw glasses
of water in my direction," she wrote.
"When reproached by a finger
waving Earth Firster," the first letter
writer continued the story, "one eter
nally hip Phi guy replied, 'Point your
finger at me again and I'll bust your
head.'"
Unfortunately, none of the letters
mentioned how the Earth Firsters got
out of that conundrum.

The winner of the incensed letter of
the week comes from Caltech, down in
Pasadena. Apparently, the Caltech ad
ministration's idea of remodeling the
undergraduate dorms is not meeting
with unanimous approval, at least with
a member of a remodeled dorm.
He complained that the buildings
were replaced by "institutional beige,
modern wood grain desks (for today's
student), fading lights (for all those
romantic times we all have at Caltech)
and a kitchen that looks like it came
out of a Dire Straits song."
"I don't know what crawled up your
anus and killed your sense of
humanity," concludes the critic. "But
now that your soul is dead, why have
you replaced it with a desire to see us
undergraduates live uniformly in an in
stitutionalized building."
Jeez, maybe all he wanted was a
Pepsi.
