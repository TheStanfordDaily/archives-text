## Water polo world wonders: Is '81 or '86 team the best? 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
It was 1981. The players included four-time
Ail-Americans Jody Campbell, James Bergeson
and Alan Mouchawar. The Stanford team was
the first men's water polo team in NCAA his
tory to win back-to-back NCAA titles and go
undefeated (31-0) during the second season.
With a 17-6 drubbing of Long Beach State in
the NCAA champioaship game, Stanford set
NCAA records for most goals scored in a
championship game and widest margin of vic
tory in a title game. Including parts of the
1980 and 1982 seasons, the Cardinal set the
NCAA record for consecutive wins (39).
Bergeson established the current Stanford
record for single season scoring with 82
goals. In addition to Bergeson, each of the five
other starters scored more than 25 goals, with
Campbell scoring 71, Mouchawar 49, Chris
Kelsy 48, Bill Taylor 35 and John Tanner 27.
Five Cardinal players were selected All-
America: Bergeson, Campbell, Mouchawar,
Taylor and goalie Vince Vanelli. The 1978
recruiting group won three NCAA titles in
four years on the Farm.
After graduation, Campbell, Bergeson and
Mouchawar all went on to participate on the
U.S. National team, with Campbeli taking pan
in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.
The 1981 team is widely regarded as the
best team ever to play collegiate water polo.

"The old team is probably the best team
that was ever put together," Brown Coach Ed
Reed said. "The things Jody did at two meters
were just incredible."
"The 1981 team had three of the best
players ever to play collegiate water polo,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"Campbell is probably the best two-meter
man ever to play collegiate water polo."
Enter the 1986 Stanford water polo team.
Coming off three wins over the weekend,
this year's 25-0 Cardinal has won 34 straight
games dating back to last season and is the
overwhelming favorite to win this year's
NCAA title. With eight regular season games
remaining, it will in all likelihood break the
1981 team's consecutive win streak. The Card
inal squad won the NCAA crown last year.
The statistics are remarkably similar. The
1981 team scored 411 goals in 31 games, al
lowing only 165. After 25 games, the 1986
Cardinal has scored 345 goals while letting in
only 123.
"I think the teams are really very similar,"
Campbell said. "Both teams relied on speed
and size."
This year's team includes four 1985 All-
Americans: seniors David Imbernino, Craig
Klass and Greg Gamble and sophomore
goalie Todd Kemp. Other starters are senior
Greg Ocasek, one of the quickest members of
the team, junior Matt Tingler, last year's hero
of the NCAA title game, and emerging junior

standout Erich Fischer.
Klass, with 61 goals, and Fischer, with 64
thus far, both have a chance to break Ber
geson's season scoring mark.
Some argue that this year's team is superior
to the 1981 team and should be duly
recognized as the best in the history of the
sport.
"Stanford is the team I've ever seen
play in my entire life," UC- Irvine Coach Ted
Newland said after the Cardinal defeated the
Anteaters on Oct. 18. "They must be the best
team in the history of water polo. 1 have never
seen a team with so much talent."
The debate rages on.
"I think we had more talent and more of a
natural meanness on our team," Mouchawar
said. "Teams were afraid to play us. I think we
would have an advantage in the hole (over
this team), with our driving game and with
our defense, and we definitely drank more
beer."
Although both teams exhibited a similar
overall team dominance, the team's
respective strengths lie in different areas.
Whereas the 1981 team relied
predominantly on individual play, this year's
squad depends on a team attack. In addition,
this year's Cardinal has more players that can
contribute off the bench.
"I think this team has a little more depth

NCAA title, Stanford water polo Coach Dante Dettamanti could not put a finger on who would

than the 1981 team," California Coach Pete Cutino said.
"There seems to be about four or five scorers on this team,
whereas the 1981 team only had around three."
With two outstanding two-meter men in Klass and Fis
cher, as opposed to one for the 1981 team (Campbell), this
year's squad has more weapons from the two-meter range.
When the driving of Imbernino and the scoring threats of
substitutes Chris Thompson, Jeff Oeding and Grant Stanley
are added in, this year's Cardinal can be said to employ a
more diverse attack.
"We don't have the individuals that they had on that
team,' Imbernino said. "But we play as a team really well.
We rely on team play rather than individual work."
"Our fifth and sixth players plus our first sub are stronger
than the five, six and seven players from the 1981 team,"
Dettamanti said.
However, unlike this year's squad, the 1981 team was ac
customed to playing the entire game. Its top three players
— Campbell, Bergeson and Mouchawar — were used to
carrying the team. In addition, the 1981 team had three ex

cellent drivers in Bergeson, Mouchawar and Kelsy, while
this year's team only has one (Imbernino).
"If both teams were in great shape, it wouldn't really mat
ter how far the subs dropped off,'' Mouchawar said. We
were used to playing the whole game.'
What would happen if they played each other?
Opinions differ on this point as well, with no conclusive
answer in sight.
"They have pluses, and we had pluses," Mouchawar said.
"I think we would beat them though when you take into ac
count our international and team experience. I think we
would win by about three goals."
"1 think we had a better team," Campbell said. "I find it
kind of hard to believe that they lost the alumni game (13-11
on Oct. 11). There was a lot of our team at the alumni game.
They can go undefeated all season, but we know they lost
one."
The other side is also argued.
"If we matched up against Campbell, Bergeson and
Mouchawar," Thompson said, "I think our team could prob
ably ouLswim them and beat them in the fourth quarter."
"It is a tough situation to predict," Dettamanti said. "The
1981 team would probably get ahead early. But this team
might wear them down, might catch up to them, and, if you
go to the bench, this team might even win."

the team, junior Matt Tingler, last year's hero
of the NCAA title game, and emerging junior

standout Erich Fischer.
Klass, with 61 goals, and Fischer, with 64
thus far, both have a chance to break Ber
geson's season scoring mark.
Some argue that this year's team is superior
to the 1981 team and should be duly
recognized as the best in the history of the
sport.
"Stanford is the team I've ever seen
play in my entire life," UC- Irvine Coach Ted
Newland said after the Cardinal defeated the
Anteaters on Oct. 18. "They must be the best
team in the history of water polo. 1 have never
seen a team with so much talent."
The debate rages on.
"I think we had more talent and more of a
natural meanness on our team," Mouchawar
said. "Teams were afraid to play us. I think we
would have an advantage in the hole (over
this team), with our driving game and with
our defense, and we definitely drank more
beer."
Although both teams exhibited a similar
overall team dominance, the team's
respective strengths lie in different areas.
Whereas the 1981 team relied
predominantly on individual play, this year's
squad depends on a team attack. In addition,
this year's Cardinal has more players that can
contribute off the bench.

NCAA title, Stanford water polo Coach Dante Dettamanti could not put a finger on who would
win if this year's squad was to meet the '81 team.
than the 1981 team," California Coach Pete Cutino said.
"There seems to be about four or five scorers on this team,
whereas the 1981 team only had around three."
With two outstanding two-meter men in Klass and Fis
cher, as opposed to one for the 1981 team (Campbell), this
year's squad has more weapons from the two-meter range.
When the driving of Imbernino and the scoring threats of
substitutes Chris Thompson, Jeff Oeding and Grant Stanley
are added in, this year's Cardinal can be said to employ a
more diverse attack.
"We don't have the individuals that they had on that
team,' Imbernino said. "But we play as a team really well.
We rely on team play rather than individual work."
"Our fifth and sixth players plus our first sub are stronger
than the five, six and seven players from the 1981 team,"
Dettamanti said.
However, unlike this year's squad, the 1981 team was ac
customed to playing the entire game. Its top three players
— Campbell, Bergeson and Mouchawar — were used to
carrying the team. In addition, the 1981 team had three ex

cellent drivers in Bergeson, Mouchawar and Kelsy, while
this year's team only has one (Imbernino).
"If both teams were in great shape, it wouldn't really mat
ter how far the subs dropped off,'' Mouchawar said. We
were used to playing the whole game.'
What would happen if they played each other?
Opinions differ on this point as well, with no conclusive
answer in sight.
"They have pluses, and we had pluses," Mouchawar said.
"I think we would beat them though when you take into ac
count our international and team experience. I think we
would win by about three goals."
"1 think we had a better team," Campbell said. "I find it
kind of hard to believe that they lost the alumni game (13-11
on Oct. 11). There was a lot of our team at the alumni game.
They can go undefeated all season, but we know they lost
one."
The other side is also argued.
"If we matched up against Campbell, Bergeson and
Mouchawar," Thompson said, "I think our team could prob
ably ouLswim them and beat them in the fourth quarter."
"It is a tough situation to predict," Dettamanti said. "The
1981 team would probably get ahead early. But this team
might wear them down, might catch up to them, and, if you
go to the bench, this team might even win."
It was 1981. The players included four-time
Ail-Americans Jody Campbell, James Bergeson
and Alan Mouchawar. The Stanford team was
the first men's water polo team in NCAA his
tory to win back-to-back NCAA titles and go
undefeated (31-0) during the second season.
With a 17-6 drubbing of Long Beach State in
the NCAA champioaship game, Stanford set
NCAA records for most goals scored in a
championship game and widest margin of vic
tory in a title game. Including parts of the
1980 and 1982 seasons, the Cardinal set the
NCAA record for consecutive wins (39).
Bergeson established the current Stanford
record for single season scoring with 82
goals. In addition to Bergeson, each of the five
other starters scored more than 25 goals, with
Campbell scoring 71, Mouchawar 49, Chris
Kelsy 48, Bill Taylor 35 and John Tanner 27.
Five Cardinal players were selected All-
America: Bergeson, Campbell, Mouchawar,
Taylor and goalie Vince Vanelli. The 1978
recruiting group won three NCAA titles in
four years on the Farm.
After graduation, Campbell, Bergeson and
Mouchawar all went on to participate on the
U.S. National team, with Campbeli taking pan
in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.
The 1981 team is widely regarded as the
best team ever to play collegiate water polo.

"The old team is probably the best team
that was ever put together," Brown Coach Ed
Reed said. "The things Jody did at two meters
were just incredible."
"The 1981 team had three of the best
players ever to play collegiate water polo,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"Campbell is probably the best two-meter
man ever to play collegiate water polo."
Enter the 1986 Stanford water polo team.
Coming off three wins over the weekend,
this year's 25-0 Cardinal has won 34 straight
games dating back to last season and is the
overwhelming favorite to win this year's
NCAA title. With eight regular season games
remaining, it will in all likelihood break the
1981 team's consecutive win streak. The Card
inal squad won the NCAA crown last year.
The statistics are remarkably similar. The
1981 team scored 411 goals in 31 games, al
lowing only 165. After 25 games, the 1986
Cardinal has scored 345 goals while letting in
only 123.
"I think the teams are really very similar,"
Campbell said. "Both teams relied on speed
and size."
This year's team includes four 1985 All-
Americans: seniors David Imbernino, Craig
Klass and Greg Gamble and sophomore
goalie Todd Kemp. Other starters are senior
Greg Ocasek, one of the quickest members of
the team, junior Matt Tingler, last year's hero
of the NCAA title game, and emerging junior

standout Erich Fischer.
