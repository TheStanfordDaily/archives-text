# Field hockey silences Cal
## 
### TOM SENT Senior staff writer 
In the last few weeks, the Stanford
field hockey team has had a tendency
not to allow any goals, and California
has had a tendency not to cash in on its
scoring opportunities.
Both trends continued yesterday, as
the Cardinal won its seventh straight
game with a 1-0 victory over the host
Bears. Stanford is now only one point
behind the University of the Pacific in
the Northern Pacific Conference stand
ings with a 3-1-1 record (9-4-1 overall).
Cal fell to 1-2-3 in the NorPac, 5-4-3
overall.

The Bears outshot the Cardinal 23-
13, but Stanford goalkeeper Karen
Jones made 10 saves to record her
seventh consecutive shutout. "They did
have more scoring opportunties by
virtue of more penalty corners (7-1),"
Stanford defender Mary Goodman
said. "They had more success getting
the ball in the circle, but we have a
great keeper."
"I think Cal dominated, but defense
is part of the game," Stanford Asst.
Coach Noelle Mitchell said. Because
Coach Sheryl Johnson is currently
travelling with the U.S. National Team,
Mitchell is temporarily in charge.
"Our defense played extremely

well," Mitchell continued. "Our goalie
and sweeper (Dana Fleming) kept us
in the game. Our offense didn't get
many opportunities, but when they
did, they made it count."
Stanford's opportunity came with
about 15 minutes left in the second
half, and the team did make it count.
After the Cal sweeper was unable to
control the ball, Maree Chung picked it
up and fed Kat Thomas on a
breakaway. Thomas then fired a shot
past Cal goalie Kim Haas at the 20:51
mark to score her team-leading fourth
goal of the year.
Stanford will host San Jose State to
morrow at 3 p.m.
