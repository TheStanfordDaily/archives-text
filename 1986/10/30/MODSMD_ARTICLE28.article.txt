# Stanford hopes to stop skid
## 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
The women's soccer season has wound down to its
final two games, and today Stanford plays its last road
game, traveling north to St. Mary's, where it hopes to end
a five-game losing streak.
Three of Stanford's last five losses have come against
nationally ranked teams, but St. Mary's should provide
the Cardinal with a more even matchup.
That's not to say that the Gaels have had a bad season.
On the contrary, this is one of the best teams St. Mary's
has ever fielded. The Gaels have a winning record at 5-4-
1 and are in the top 10 of the NAIA's Far West Division.
"They (the Gaels) are well coached," Stanford Coach

Helen Keohane said. "They're disciplined.... They don't
give up, and they play well as a team."
Last year, Stanford lost to St. Mary's 3-2 in an overtime
game. This year, the Cardinal will be prepared for the
Gaels' virtual solo offensive attack, which is comple
mented by a well-staffed, resolute defense.
Freshman forward Desi Engle, the heart of the St.
Mary's offensive unit, has already broken the Gaels'
scoring record for one season with 12 goals. She also has
two assists. The next highest scorer on the team, Christy
Baird, trails Engle with only three goals and three assists.
Stanford, by contrast, has a more well-rounded offen
sive attack. Three Cardinal players are tied with four
goals apiece to lead the team in
scoring: midfielders Tonya Antonucci,

Amy Geisse and Stacey Keare.
Both Stanford and St. Mary's have
strong defenses, and the performance
of the defensive players will probably
determine the outcome of the game.
The Cardinal will be relying heavily
on freshman sweeper Christine Martin

to protect the goal and clear the ball
downfield. Goalie Vija Brookshire and
the other fullbacks will be playing
without the help of veteran fullback
Chris Scott, however, who severely
sprained her ankle in Sunday's game at
Cal State-Dominguez Hills.
