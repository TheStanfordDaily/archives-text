# Save American culture
## 
### 
A week off from football to look at
the premier sporting event in America,
which ended just three short days ago.
The suicide rate in New England has
skyrocketed, there is still grass in Shea
Stadium, Steve Raczynski is smiling no
more, and John McNamara is going to
sign the New York Mounted Police, the
only effective thing to come out of the
Red Sox bullpen in Game 7.

And, thanks to television-inspired
greed, millions of kids fell asleep while
watching the finale of our great na
tional game.
You see, the games started at 8:30
p.m. in the Eastern time zone. More
than half of the people in the United
States live in that time zone. Throw in

extended between-inning breaks to
show more commercials and you have
games going past midnight. Imagine it,
David Letterman pre-empted by
baseball.
Think back to the heroes of days
gone by. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe
DiMaggio, Bob Feller, Ted Williams,
Sandy Koufax. When they were
playing, Detroit made the world's best
cars, Miss America was never
photographed wearing less than a swim
suit, and Coke was something vou
drank for five cents a bottle. And World
Series games were played in the
daytime.
Now look at today. Millions of kids
unable to stay awake to see the end of a
World Series game will become dis
enchanted with the national pastime,
start playing soccer, go to the beach in
stead of the ballgame and not know Ty
Cobb's lifetime batting average (.367).
In short, the end of American culture
as we know it.
The first World Series game was
played at night in 1971. Since then,
we've had a drug epidemic, a rise in
terrorism, communist expansionism,

Watergate, Hustler magazine, the
"Women of Stanford" calendar, the 21
drinking age and the 55-mile-per-hour
speed limit. A coincidence? I think not.
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth has
pledged to have one game per series
played during the day. Major sacrifice.
Way to save American youth, Pete.
What is wrong with playing all four
weekend games during the day? Satur
day and Sunday are days off for most
people. On top of it all, people go out
on Saturday night. Day games would
seem to make sense.
Wrong. There's football. Oh, yeah.
Baseball — the national pastime,
America's game, the only reason
anyone would visit the Bronx —
baseball is scared to go head-to-head
with football. Not the Super Bowl —
just some regular-season games.
Come on, Pete. Listen to Reggie and
Nancy and just say no — to Miller beer
and its advertising money. Take on the
NR. Let kids watch the World Series.
Save American youth from a life of sex,
drugs and general secular humanism.
The future of our civilization depends
on it.
