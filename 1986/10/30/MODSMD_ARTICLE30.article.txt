## Class, comfort and charm: Flea Street Cafe 
### CLARA WU BRUCE BROWN 
The Flea Street Cafe
3607 Alameda de las Pulgas
854-1226
Walking into the Flea Street Cafe is
'ike walking into a quilt that hangs in
your grandmother's house. Amid the
colors and patterns of the walls, the
embroidery of the decorative cloth, the
pillows in the booths, there is the
warmth of a family hearth.
Located on Alameda de las Pulgas
('pulgas' is Spanish for 'fleas') in Menlo
Park, the restaurant is just minutes
from campus. Its decor is what we
think the word "vintage'' is all about:
class, charm, comfort and detail.
What strikes you is the way every
thing mixes, the amber of the candles,
the burnt reds of the wallpaper, the
dark woods of the tables, the white
lights that frame the windows. It is very
close to nostalgia, and thus we were
not surprised to discover that when the
restaurant opened five years ago, the
time of year was Christmas.

A total of three dining areas make up
the restaurant, each sized to create an
intimate atmosphere. We were seated
in the front room, from which we
could see the bar area and the serving
room where the dessert tray is kept.
The whipped creams and fruits were
barely discernible ... but we're getting
ahead of ourselves.
Our waiter was friendly and offered
much help in unraveling the menu se
lections. Each entree is available a la
carte, or can be ordered as part of a
complete dinner, which includes a se
lection of appetizers and soup or salad.
There is an extensive wine list, and the
restaurant features several selected
wines, which are alternated regularly.
Clara, after assuring me that she had
decided upon the lemon fettucine with
salmon, carrot noodles, spinach,
tomatoes and topped with a sauce of
tarragon, garlic, creme fraiche and per
nod, ordered fresh baby coho salmon
when the moment of truth came. I
chose the Tandoori chicken with
curried vegetables, basmati rice and
fresh fruit chutney. Other choices
available that night were a smoked
chicken served over warm Maryland

corn relish, several pasta selections
and buttermilk pecan catfish.
The appetizers were served with
fresh biscuits and bread, and were at
tractively arranged on the plate beside
a pink flower. One was a pesto chan
tilly with roasted fennel, the other brie
and crouton with a ginger and garlic
fig conserve. The nod here goes to the
latter — not only were the tastes right
on but they also had a real creativity
about them, mixing food items that
normally one does not picture to
gether, a French cheese (nice at room
temperature) with a spicy
Mediterranean-style sauce.
The soup was a Mulligatawny, thin,
with curried chicken chunks and
vegetables. It was brought to the table
warm, not steaming, for this tempera
ture allowed the flavors of the soup to
come out gently. The salad, a lettuce
vinaigrette, was simple, but pleasant,
and it had a nice mild effect fbllowint?

the spicy fig conserve.
The entrees came promptly and
were, like the introductory courses,
placed on the plate with great attention
to design, flowers not forgotten. Clara's
salmon was broiled and covered with a
cucumber salsa. On the side were
sauteed vegetables — the different
colored peppers brought a nice back
ground of color to the plate — and
white rice. My chicken also came with
rice, and the vegetables were broccoli
and cauliflower. Raisins and spiced ap
ple were in the chutney. The
respective tastes of these two selec
tions appealed to different parts of the
palate: the salmon understated, the
chicken prominent. Both were suc
cessful.
At last, dessert. There were five se
lections that evening, and we choose a
raspberry tone and spiced apple cake
with raisins, both served with a light
whipped creme. Coffee came with

cream and brown sugar. And, in a res
taurant as delightful to look at as Flea
Street Cafe is, cup can lead to cup and
make for a long evening. Espresso is
available as is a choice of after-dinner
drinks. That night, there was a creme
sherry and 1975 Dow's Vintage Port.
The restaurant is open for lunch
Tuesday through Friday, and dinner is
served Tuesday through Saturday.
There is a brunch on Sunday. The
menu turns over every two weeks, en
suring one a fresh dining experience

with each visit, and "light" and
vegetarian meals are available. Most
complete dinners cost between $15
and $20, while the "light" or a la cane
meals are less expensive. The fresh
herbs, flowers (which are edible, we
are told) and garnishes are grown in
their own garden. Reservations are ac
cepted and are suggested for
weekends.
The mono of the Flea Street Cafe is,
"Above all else, enjoy!" It is not a diffi
cult request.

come out gently. The salad, a lettuce
vinaigrette, was simple, but pleasant,
and it had a nice mild effect fbllowint?

the spicy fig conserve.
The entrees came promptly and
were, like the introductory courses,
placed on the plate with great attention
to design, flowers not forgotten. Clara's
salmon was broiled and covered with a
cucumber salsa. On the side were
sauteed vegetables — the different
colored peppers brought a nice back
ground of color to the plate — and
white rice. My chicken also came with
rice, and the vegetables were broccoli
and cauliflower. Raisins and spiced ap
ple were in the chutney. The
respective tastes of these two selec
tions appealed to different parts of the
palate: the salmon understated, the
chicken prominent. Both were suc
cessful.
At last, dessert. There were five se
lections that evening, and we choose a
raspberry tone and spiced apple cake
with raisins, both served with a light
whipped creme. Coffee came with

cream and brown sugar. And, in a res
taurant as delightful to look at as Flea
Street Cafe is, cup can lead to cup and
make for a long evening. Espresso is
available as is a choice of after-dinner
drinks. That night, there was a creme
sherry and 1975 Dow's Vintage Port.
The restaurant is open for lunch
Tuesday through Friday, and dinner is
served Tuesday through Saturday.
There is a brunch on Sunday. The
menu turns over every two weeks, en
suring one a fresh dining experience

with each visit, and "light" and
vegetarian meals are available. Most
complete dinners cost between $15
and $20, while the "light" or a la cane
meals are less expensive. The fresh
herbs, flowers (which are edible, we
are told) and garnishes are grown in
their own garden. Reservations are ac
cepted and are suggested for
weekends.
The mono of the Flea Street Cafe is,
"Above all else, enjoy!" It is not a diffi
cult request.

The Flea Street Cafe
3607 Alameda de las Pulgas
854-1226
Walking into the Flea Street Cafe is
'ike walking into a quilt that hangs in
your grandmother's house. Amid the
colors and patterns of the walls, the
embroidery of the decorative cloth, the
pillows in the booths, there is the
warmth of a family hearth.
Located on Alameda de las Pulgas
('pulgas' is Spanish for 'fleas') in Menlo
Park, the restaurant is just minutes
from campus. Its decor is what we
think the word "vintage'' is all about:
class, charm, comfort and detail.
What strikes you is the way every
thing mixes, the amber of the candles,
the burnt reds of the wallpaper, the
dark woods of the tables, the white
lights that frame the windows. It is very
close to nostalgia, and thus we were
not surprised to discover that when the
restaurant opened five years ago, the
time of year was Christmas.

A total of three dining areas make up
the restaurant, each sized to create an
intimate atmosphere. We were seated
in the front room, from which we
could see the bar area and the serving
room where the dessert tray is kept.
The whipped creams and fruits were
barely discernible ... but we're getting
ahead of ourselves.
Our waiter was friendly and offered
much help in unraveling the menu se
lections. Each entree is available a la
carte, or can be ordered as part of a
complete dinner, which includes a se
lection of appetizers and soup or salad.
There is an extensive wine list, and the
restaurant features several selected
wines, which are alternated regularly.
Clara, after assuring me that she had
decided upon the lemon fettucine with
salmon, carrot noodles, spinach,
tomatoes and topped with a sauce of
tarragon, garlic, creme fraiche and per
nod, ordered fresh baby coho salmon
when the moment of truth came. I
chose the Tandoori chicken with
curried vegetables, basmati rice and
fresh fruit chutney. Other choices
available that night were a smoked
chicken served over warm Maryland

corn relish, several pasta selections
and buttermilk pecan catfish.
The appetizers were served with
fresh biscuits and bread, and were at
tractively arranged on the plate beside
a pink flower. One was a pesto chan
tilly with roasted fennel, the other brie
and crouton with a ginger and garlic
fig conserve. The nod here goes to the
latter — not only were the tastes right
on but they also had a real creativity
about them, mixing food items that
normally one does not picture to
gether, a French cheese (nice at room
temperature) with a spicy
Mediterranean-style sauce.
The soup was a Mulligatawny, thin,
with curried chicken chunks and
vegetables. It was brought to the table
warm, not steaming, for this tempera
ture allowed the flavors of the soup to
come out gently. The salad, a lettuce
vinaigrette, was simple, but pleasant,
and it had a nice mild effect fbllowint?
