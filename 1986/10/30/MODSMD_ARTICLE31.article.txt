The Daily yesterday incorrectly re
ported University President Donald
Kennedy's remarks at Tuesday's ASSU
Senate meeting. The Daily reported
that he said Stanford had played a
somewhat causal role in the recent dis
investment decisions by IBM and Gen
eral Motors. Kennedy said corpora
tions like IBM and General Motors
consider many factors — including the
representations of active institutional
stockholders — in reaching their deci
sions on disinvestment.
The Daily also incorrectly reported
that Kennedy said it was the transition
from equity to debt that primarily led
the companies to disinvest. Kennedy
said the transition was an outcome of
the way disinvestment is proposed to
be conducted in the cases of IBM and
General Motors.
The Daily also incorrectly reported
that Kennedy said minority professors

qualified to teach in an ethnic studies
program are not interested in the
courses. Kennedy said ethnic studies
programs, like other innovative aca
demic programs, come up from the
faculty, not down from the ad
ministraton, and that in the past, the
development of proposed ethnic
studies programs at Stanford has not
had the necessary support from faculty,
including minority faculty.
The Daily regrets these errors.
