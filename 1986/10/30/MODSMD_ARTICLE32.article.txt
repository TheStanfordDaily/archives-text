# Hospice program aids the dying
## 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
Patients in the last stages of terminal illnesses and
their families will soon be able to receive a complete
range of support services from a special hospice pro
gram now in planning by Stanford Hospital's Home
Care Program.
According to Kathy Janz, director of the program,
the new hospice effort will provide emotional and
practical support for terminally ill patients when
acute care is no longer appropriate.
"Most patients who want hospice care are those
who opt to die at home rather than in a hospital," she
explained.
The new program will primarily cater to the needs
of patients with life-threatening illnesses who are ex
pected to live no longer than six months. There
should also be a relative, spouse or close friend who
is already dedicated to providing care and support
during the patient's last stages of illness, Janz said.
The hospice program, which is expected to begin
serving patients in San Mateo, Santa Clara and
Alameda counties Jan. 1, will provide care in the
home environment through its staff of trained
nurses, therapists, counselors, social workers, home
health aids and volunteers.
One main difference between hospice care and
home care, said Janz, is that in hospice care the pa

tient and his or her family comprise the primary care
unit. Family members and friends are involved in
caring for the terminally ill patient, and they too
become clients to the program since they receive
counseling for grief and coming to terms with the
death of someone close to them.
The present home care program provides terminal
and rehabilitative care that requires fairly sophisti
cated long-term treatment. Patients who would
otherwise stay in the hospital can be treated in their
own homes. The program offers a 24-hour nursing
service but lacks the volunteer component and
bereavement counseling.
Janz noted that insurance companies have recendy
realized the economic feasability of home and
hospice care. Since it is usually "a lot cheaper" to
care for a patient at home than in a hospital, most in
surance companies now pay reimbursements for in
home care.
The care provided will be centered around al
leviating the patient's symptoms, rather than treating
the disease itself, and will work toward keeping the
patient's family psychologically and socially intact,
she said. For example, the hospice team will try to
ensure that children continue going to school when
a parent is ill and will provide counseling for family
and friends.
Janz stressed the importance of volunteers for the

success of the program. "Volunteers provide respite
care and social support by establishing rapport with
the family up to one year after bereavement," she
said.
Recruitment of volunteers is the last major task
before the hospice service can be inaugurated. Ac
cording to Sharon Beckham, coordinator for volun
teer services, volunteers will undergo a 20-hour
training program, and during the year they will be
asked to attend monthly support meetings with
nurses to share experiences.
"These people really do personalize the care we
provide," she said. "And they find the experience
personally gratifying; they grow as individuals by
helping others."
Janz said the hospice program adds a "high touch"
facet to the "high tech" services offered by the hospi
tal. If it becomes necessary for the patient to enter
the hospital, hospice care givers will be available to
provide continued support and to work with the
hospital staff.
Care will be provided based on the needs of indi
vidual patients and their families. Some patients will
be referred to the hospice programs in very late
stages of illness and may require several visits in a
single day, Janz explained, while others who live
more normal lives need less frequent care, perhaps
once a week or less.
