# Report finds classrooms deficient
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
A report by the Subcommitee on Evaluation and
Improvement of Teaching shows that 72 percent of
the University's classrooms are deficient in ventila
tion, lighting and teaching aids.
The report, part of an annual report by the Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and Achievement (C
-AAA), will be presented today at a meeting of the Fac
ulty Senate. Included will be results of a survey of
Stanford faculty which found that of the University's
233 teaching rooms, 21 percent have poor lighting,
22 percent lack such basic teaching aids as writing
boards, and 35 percent have inadequate ventilation.
The survey was initiated in 1984 by Pathology Prof.
Luis Fajardo, who chaired the subcommittee. Accord
ing to Sharad Jain, one of the three students who
served on the subcommittee, faculty were sent ques
tionaires, and then subcommittee members ex
amined individual classrooms themselves.

Jain said, however, that the subcommittee did not
discuss specific rooms or problems. Rather, he said,
it examined the general state of the teaching rooms.
There is also a shortage in the number of seminar
rooms (which can hold up to 20 people) and
auditoriums (which can hold more than 200)
available during peak hours of the day, according to
the report.
"It sounds better than it is," said English Prof. Ron
Rebholz, who pointed out that of the 77 seminar
rooms at Stanford, only 28 are under the direct con
trol of the Registrar's Office Individual departments
have priority over the remaining seminar rooms.
Rebholz faults individual departments for "sitting"
on seminar rooms that could be utilized. The admin
istration is also to blame, he said, because it builds
science laboratories but not classrooms.
"We should have the technological wizardry to
build classrooms with flexible walls," Rebholz said.
"God knows we need more classrooms, especially of
seminar size."

Rebholz has proposed in one of his classes that the
University build a building containing classrooms
with walls that can be moved depending on the size
of the class.
Alistair Murray, the classroom coordinator for the
Registrar's Office who is responsible for scheduling
classes in individual teaching rooms, said, "there is a
definite shortage of classrooms and a definite
shortage of seminar rooms."
Murray indicated that the shortage is not a new
problem but one that has existed for some time. He
said often departments request seminar rooms, but
they are simply unavailable. In such cases, a lecture
room must be used instead, he said. The existence of
more classrooms would alleviate this problem.
According to the report, Stanford has 77 seminar
rooms, 31 lecture-seminar rooms (which have fixed
seating for up to 25), 96 lecture halls (which can hold
up to 100), 77 amphitheaters (which can hold up to
200) and 12 auditoriums.
