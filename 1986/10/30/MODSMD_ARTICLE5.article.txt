# Reagan library draws criticism
## 
### CHUCK MEYER 
Although the license between the
Stanford Board of Trustees and the
Reagan Library Foundation calls for
"multi-purpose rooms that can be used
for ordinary auditorium purposes,
conferences, seminars and meetings,"
the size of the proposed auditorium
and height of the structure have come
under criticism by Stanford faculty
members.
The proposed structure would in
clude a 300-400 seat auditorium in a
valley to the right of the jogger's path
up to the Dish from Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
"No academic department has said
they want a classroom or auditorium
there," said Electrical Engineering
Prof. Anthony Siegman, who also is a
member of the Faculty Senate.
This "brings questions whether a
magnificent foothill area should be
sacrificed for it," Siegman said at a Palo
Alto City Council meeting Monday
night.
The visual impacts of the project are
negated by the proposed hillside valley
site, according to Charles Palm, ar
chivist at the Hoover Institution and
University liaison to the Reagan Library
Foundation. He added that a $3 7 mil
lion mitigation fund has been estab
lished by the library foundation for the
University's future efforts at lessening
the project's environmental impacts.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy contends that such a fund has
Utile u.se since the aesthetic
damage is already present in the
design."

"The beauty and proximity of the
foothills is a unique Stanford resource,
and we should be loathe to do anything
that would scar the landscape," said
Abernethy, a member of the Faculty
Senate.
"We have no intention of creating a
major conference center, " said Palm.
He said he anticipates no more than
three or four major conferences each
year, not including any possible schol
arly conferences.
Siegman said even six conferences a
year "might be fine, but why couldn't
they be scheduled into other (already
existing) auditoriums on campus?"
But Palm countered that "we might
expect Reagan to visit from time to
time, and we would need an
auditorium for that purpose." George
Shultz, Margaret Thatcher or even
Mikhail Gorbachev might also visit the
facility and require an auditorium,
Palm speculated.
Though Abernethy said he opposes
the proposed foothill location, he
pointed out that the facilities them
selves would be worthwhile since
Reagan's is "one of the most important
presidencies of the century."
Abernethy said that the two-story
Reagan Library complex should not
have been approved, since the second
story is visible from Lake Lagunita.
Palm conceded its visibility from
across the lake, near the boathouse,
but argued that it has only minimal
visibility from Junipero Serra and the
rest of campus.
It would -be seen from Junipero
Serra between Gerona and Campus
Drive East, Palm said.
