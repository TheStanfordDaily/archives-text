# Parking structure will hold 700 cars

### TRACIE THOMPSON 
Construction on a multi-level
parking structure at Stanford — ex
pected to cost between $7 million and
$10 million — will begin next year.
University officials expect the new
structure to hold between 700 and
1,000 cars at a cost of $10,000 per car
space.
The University Board of Trustees has
already approved a site next to Forsyth
Hall for the garage, which will be lo
cated at the intersection of Panama
Street and Via Ortega, on land that is
currently a parking lot.
Dennis Perkinson, associate director
for transportation programs, said the
garage will have to be a multi-level
structure to fit the desired number of
spaces. He projects that construction
will begin in May or June, 1987.
Alternative parking sites are under
consideration for the approximately
200 cars that will be bumped from the
Forsyth lot when construction begins,
said Perkinson.
The redevelopment of the Near West
Campus calls for other lots to be
turned into building space, making the
parking garage a necessary next step in
the project. But replacing the existing
spaces with a larger structure may not
silence complaints about the parking

situation at Stanford.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the Univer
sity president, said that when people
complain about lack of parking, "they
are really saying that they cannot find a
space where they want to park." He
said there is ample parking on campus,
but expansion of buildings has moved
the parking areas progressively further
away, causing problems and location
complaints.
Hamrdla, a former chairman of a
University committee on parking and
transportation, said, "There is no issue, 1
am convinced, that arouses more emo
tion than parking." He noted that Stan
ford chose long ago to have buildings
surrounded by greenery instead of
convenient parking spaces.
The current parking committee
chairman, Aeronautics Prof. Daniel
Bershader, said he had not heard any
complaints about the planned garage.
He added that word of the decision
might not have gotten around to all of
the faculty yet.
Bershader commented that a well
designed, landscaped parking
structure could be an improvement to
the campus appearance. "I think it can
look just as good as some of these bald
parking lots," Bershader said.
