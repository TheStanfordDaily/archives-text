# Precious few important facts about crosswords
## History...1986

"It should be bigger and it should be on its
side," said Charles Cuny, a doctoral candidate in
the Graduate School of Business. "That way, you
could identify it easier: 'Hey, that thing's sideways;
it must be the crossword.' "
"I'm not a (crossword) fiend, said Junior Bob
Arnsdorf. "Somedays though It's right up there;
when you're in a crossword mood, it's the best.
One out of four Daily readers interviewed in an
informal poll said the crossword puzzle is the
first thing they turn to when they open the Daily.
Quite a tremendous turnabout for a feature
which, at its inception 51 years ago, needed to ask
its readers for approval.
"The Daily Crossword" made its debut on Nov.
1,1935. The response to this novel idea was im
mediate, overwhelming and positive. One letter
from "Puzzle Phan stated that not only (are the
puzzles) entertaining and educational, but they
help to fill in the time between classes, between

meals and any other periods when students have
time on their hands."
Quickly, students found that the crossword was
a good way to fill in the time during class as well.
A later puzzle had the admonishment "What not
to do during an econ lecture."
Unfortunately, the crossword puzzle experi
ment seemed doomed to failure; the feature dis
appeared after a two-month run in early Decem
ber 1935.
However, its fans would not let it, like Star
Trek, die. In fact, The Daily received an epistolary
torpedoing from puzzle fanatics.
"I used to work industriously at them in my
cold, cold 8 o'clocks, but since you've done away
with them I have no incentive to scramble out of

bed and wend my way to class," wrote one
reader. "So I am enclosing one of my own."
Several others wrote simply to inquire about
the status of the puzzle, to which The Daily
editorship replied only with terse statements
about back orders and delays.
The break came on Feb. 15, 1936, when
the first puzzle in three months appeared. "These
puzzles were ordered over a month ago," ex
plained The Daily. "After too long a delay, Little
Swampum (the Daily mascot) got after the
postman and here's the fruit of his labor."
The early puzzles were apparently of the
home-grown variety, no by-line appeared with it.
Perhaps due to this oversight, the unfortunate
who made up the puzzle may have gotten dis

gusted and quit.
This left the space ripe for syndication and,
sure enough, the first nationally syndicated cross
word puzzle appeared in March 1936.
The syndicate was United Features and the au
thor's name was Lars Morris. Together, they lasted
until Nov. 1, 1938, when the space occupied by
the puzzle was annexed, in the spirit of the times,
by a news analysis column, ironically titled
"History... 1938."
What with the upcoming war, only one letter
writer made a query about the dearth of puzzle
— and that was only a postscript to a letter from
"Sally Sorority" who was defending the honor of
the men of Delta Kappa Epsilon.
The puzzle's future was grim as World War II
began. Space in the newspaper was required for
new features such as "Stanford in the Service." A
particular}' grim editorial in 1942 pointed out that
"traditions are dying out at Stanford The war has
killed some of the time-honored practices of stu-
dents."
The puzzle was out for the duration.
The duration turned out to be 40
years long, as readers turned to other
sources for doing their daily cross
word.

Then, Lazarus-like, the puzzle
returned. The Daily issued the state
ment, "In an effort to relieve classroom
boredom and add zest to your univer
sity experience, the Daily will be run
ning the New York Times crossword
puzzle everyday."
"This will have no impact on your
sex life but we hope you will enjoy it,"
it added. So, on Jan. 4, 1978, edited as

always by Eugene T. Maleska, the puz
zle returned and has run continuously
since then.
The puzzle is purchased through a
contract with the New York Times
Syndicate. According to Karen Piatt, the
assistant business manager of The
Daily, the puzzle costs about $65 per
month, or about $3 25 per puzzle.
"If it doesn't run, then it was due to

one of two things," said Piatt. "One is
that there wasn't enough and we
needed tne spacc for articles or ads; or
two, it got lost in the mail."
In either case, she said that she al
ways gets a few calls from people who
demand to know where the crossword
went.
"Considering that we only get a few
calls a day, it's quite a response."
"It should be bigger and it should be on its

gusted and quit.
This left the space ripe for syndication and,
sure enough, the first nationally syndicated cross
word puzzle appeared in March 1936.
The syndicate was United Features and the au
thor's name was Lars Morris. Together, they lasted
until Nov. 1, 1938, when the space occupied by
the puzzle was annexed, in the spirit of the times,
by a news analysis column, ironically titled
"History... 1938."
What with the upcoming war, only one letter
writer made a query about the dearth of puzzle
— and that was only a postscript to a letter from
"Sally Sorority" who was defending the honor of
the men of Delta Kappa Epsilon.
The puzzle's future was grim as World War II
began. Space in the newspaper was required for
new features such as "Stanford in the Service." A
particular}' grim editorial in 1942 pointed out that
"traditions are dying out at Stanford The war has
killed some of the time-honored practices of stu-
dents."
The puzzle was out for the duration.
The duration turned out to be 40
years long, as readers turned to other
sources for doing their daily cross
word.

Then, Lazarus-like, the puzzle
returned. The Daily issued the state
ment, "In an effort to relieve classroom
boredom and add zest to your univer
sity experience, the Daily will be run
ning the New York Times crossword
puzzle everyday."
"This will have no impact on your
sex life but we hope you will enjoy it,"
it added. So, on Jan. 4, 1978, edited as

always by Eugene T. Maleska, the puz
zle returned and has run continuously
since then.
The puzzle is purchased through a
contract with the New York Times
Syndicate. According to Karen Piatt, the
assistant business manager of The
Daily, the puzzle costs about $65 per
month, or about $3 25 per puzzle.
"If it doesn't run, then it was due to

one of two things," said Piatt. "One is
that there wasn't enough and we
needed tne spacc for articles or ads; or
two, it got lost in the mail."
In either case, she said that she al
ways gets a few calls from people who
demand to know where the crossword
went.
"Considering that we only get a few
calls a day, it's quite a response."
"It should be bigger and it should be on its
side," said Charles Cuny, a doctoral candidate in
the Graduate School of Business. "That way, you
could identify it easier: 'Hey, that thing's sideways;
it must be the crossword.' "
"I'm not a (crossword) fiend, said Junior Bob
Arnsdorf. "Somedays though It's right up there;
when you're in a crossword mood, it's the best.
One out of four Daily readers interviewed in an
informal poll said the crossword puzzle is the
first thing they turn to when they open the Daily.
Quite a tremendous turnabout for a feature
which, at its inception 51 years ago, needed to ask
its readers for approval.
"The Daily Crossword" made its debut on Nov.
1,1935. The response to this novel idea was im
mediate, overwhelming and positive. One letter
from "Puzzle Phan stated that not only (are the
puzzles) entertaining and educational, but they
help to fill in the time between classes, between

meals and any other periods when students have
time on their hands."
Quickly, students found that the crossword was
a good way to fill in the time during class as well.
A later puzzle had the admonishment "What not
to do during an econ lecture."
Unfortunately, the crossword puzzle experi
ment seemed doomed to failure; the feature dis
appeared after a two-month run in early Decem
ber 1935.
However, its fans would not let it, like Star
Trek, die. In fact, The Daily received an epistolary
torpedoing from puzzle fanatics.
"I used to work industriously at them in my
cold, cold 8 o'clocks, but since you've done away
with them I have no incentive to scramble out of

bed and wend my way to class," wrote one
reader. "So I am enclosing one of my own."
Several others wrote simply to inquire about
the status of the puzzle, to which The Daily
editorship replied only with terse statements
about back orders and delays.
The break came on Feb. 15, 1936, when
the first puzzle in three months appeared. "These
puzzles were ordered over a month ago," ex
plained The Daily. "After too long a delay, Little
Swampum (the Daily mascot) got after the
postman and here's the fruit of his labor."
The early puzzles were apparently of the
home-grown variety, no by-line appeared with it.
Perhaps due to this oversight, the unfortunate
who made up the puzzle may have gotten dis

gusted and quit.
