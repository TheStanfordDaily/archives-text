More AIDS funding needed
WASHINGTON — The National Academy of Sciences, lamenting
"woefully inadequate" federal programs to cope with America's new health
threat, called yesterday for creation of a National Commission on AIDS.
The prestigious academy, in a major report on the increasing problems
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said the only way to avoid a
health catastrophe in this country is to launch "perhaps the most wide
ranging and intensive efforts ever made against an infectious disease."
A panel of experts convened by the academy said the nation should be
spending about $2 billion annually by 1990, most of it new federal money,
in a multi-pronged effort to thwart the deadly disease.
Research into the nature of the viral disease, treatments and vaccines
should get $1 billion a year by the end of the decade, said Dr. David Bal
timore, a Nobel laureate who was co-chairman of the study.
An additional $1 billion a year — mostly federal money but with substan
tial contributions from state and local governments, industry and private
sources — should be spent on education and public health programs, said
Baltimore, director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in
Cambridge, Mass.
These programs would include sex education in schools, efforts to get
people at high risk of getting AIDS to change their sexual habits, blood
screening to identify those infected with the AIDS virus, rehabilitation for
drug abusers and testing the idea of providing disposable syringes to ad
dicts who refuse treatment, the panel said.
Arms proposals still stand
RAPID CITY, S.D. — President Reagan said yesterday he's directed Secre
tary of State George Shultz to inform the Soviet Union that the arms control
proposals the United States offered in Iceland "remain on the table."
"We are ready to take up where we left off in Reykjavik," Reagan said
during a stopover here on a political campaign trip.
The two sides made substantial progress on nuclear arms reductions at
the Oct. 11-12 summit before the talks collapsed. The insurmountable
issue was Reagan's refusal to accept a demand by the Soviets that research
for his so-called "Star Wars" space-based missile defense shield be
confined to laboratory work.
"We want to confirm and build on the agreements reached there,"
Reagan said in remarks prepared for a campaign rally for Sen. James
Abdnor (R-S.D.)
"I don't know of a specific agenda" for Shultz's expected meeting with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Vienna next week, White
House spokesman Larry Speakes told reporters traveling aboard Air Force
One en route here.
But Speakes did say the United States wants to "see if we can make prog
ress in one area without progress in another."
He was referring to the Soviets' insistence at the Iceland summit that all
tentative agreements on intermediate range missiles, strategic arms and
related issues were contingent on an agreement to restrict research on Star
Wars, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
Asked whether Shultz would formally propose breaking the linkage
during the Vienna talks scheduled to open Nov. 5, Speakes said, "We'll dis
cuss it."
Grenade possibly downed plane
TOKYO — The accidental explosion of a Japanese gangster's grenade
may have caused the violent five-mile plunge of a Thai jetliner that injured
62 people, press reports said yesterday.
Police said they still had reached no conclusions, but investigators have
said they believed an explosion occurred on the A-300 Airbus of Thai Air
ways International before a loss of pressure Sunday night caused the wild
descent and an emergency landing at Osaka in western Japan.
Kyodo News Service said metal fragments collected from the plane and
signs of powder smoke led to the conclusion that a grenade exploded in a
rear toilet of the plane, which was carrying 247 people on a flight from
Bangkok to Osaka via Manila.
Kyodo and three mass circulation newspapers said Osaka police were in
vestigating two Japanese men who boarded in Manila. One was described
as a 43-year-old alleged gang member from Osaka who remained hospi
talized with injuries suffered in the accident.
The newspaper Asahi said without quoting sources that someone ap
parently took a grenade onto the plane in Manila and hid it in the toilet
before the aircraft reached Osaka. It also said the possibility of a suicide at
tempt had not been ruled out.
Controller error questioned
WASHINGTON — Investigators are steering away from suggestions that
a controller's preoccupation with an errant private aircraft played
prominently in the August collision of a Mexican airliner and another
small plane near Los Angeles.
Sources close to the investigation said yesterday there are clear indica
tions that the Aeromexico Airlines jetliner and a single-engine Piper PA-28
collided before the controller became embroiled with the so-called "pop
up" aircraft.
The collision of Aeromexico Flight 498 and the Piper PA-28 on Aug. 31
over Cerritos, Calif., claimed 82 lives and prompted the Federal Aviation
Administration to step up its enforcement campaign against pilots who vio
late restricted areas near major airports.
The National Transportation Safety Board is scheduled to release a series
ot documents today, including a transcript of conversation in the cockpit of
the Mexican jetliner that is expected to indicate the time of the collision.
Journalists sign to free hostages
WASHINGTON — A "Free Terry Anderson" petition drive has attracted
the signatures of more than 1,200 journalists demanding freedom for the
U.S. newsman and the other hostages in Lebanon.
The drive was launched three weeks ago by two Associated Press
reporters who initially set out just to gather support from the Washington
press corps.
But friends and co-workers of Anderson, the AP's chief Middle East cor
respondent, began circulating copies of the petition in New York, on the
West Coast and, more recently, in foreign capitals.
One reporter gathered signatures at the recent superpower summit in
Reykjavik, Iceland, and 135 newspaper editors signed it last week at the As
sociated Press Managing Editors convention in Cincinnati.
Scores of journalists signed the petition in Tokyo, where Anderson was
once an officer of the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan.
The petition asks President Reagan, Secretary of State George Shultz,
their counterparts in the Middle East and others with influence in that
strife-torn region "to work diligently for the speedy release" of Anderson
and the other prisoners.
OPEC leader ousted by Saudis
WASHINGTON — Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's petroleum
minister for more than two decades and a key figure behind the oil em
bargo of 1973, has been fired, the Saudi government reported.
In a terse announcement, the official Saudi Press Agency today reported
the removal of Yamani, 56, the most powerful figure in the 13-country Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The agency, which gave no
reason for the ouster, said the 56-year-old Yamani was being replaced by
Planning Minister Hisham Nazer.
Oil industry sources described Nazer, who was named acting oil mini
ster, as a dramatic departure from Yamani in both style and philosophy.
However, they said it was unclear whether there would be any dramatic
shift in Saudi oil policy', at least in the short term.
The State Department could not confirm Yamani s ouster, but U.S. offi
cials have said that rumors of his removal have persisted for some time.

tions that the Aeromexico Airlines jetliner and a single-engine Piper PA-28
collided before the controller became embroiled with the so-called "pop
up" aircraft.
The collision of Aeromexico Flight 498 and the Piper PA-28 on Aug. 31
over Cerritos, Calif., claimed 82 lives and prompted the Federal Aviation
Administration to step up its enforcement campaign against pilots who vio
late restricted areas near major airports.
The National Transportation Safety Board is scheduled to release a series
ot documents today, including a transcript of conversation in the cockpit of
the Mexican jetliner that is expected to indicate the time of the collision.
Journalists sign to free hostages
WASHINGTON — A "Free Terry Anderson" petition drive has attracted
the signatures of more than 1,200 journalists demanding freedom for the
U.S. newsman and the other hostages in Lebanon.
The drive was launched three weeks ago by two Associated Press
reporters who initially set out just to gather support from the Washington
press corps.
But friends and co-workers of Anderson, the AP's chief Middle East cor
respondent, began circulating copies of the petition in New York, on the
West Coast and, more recently, in foreign capitals.
One reporter gathered signatures at the recent superpower summit in
Reykjavik, Iceland, and 135 newspaper editors signed it last week at the As
sociated Press Managing Editors convention in Cincinnati.
Scores of journalists signed the petition in Tokyo, where Anderson was
once an officer of the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan.
The petition asks President Reagan, Secretary of State George Shultz,
their counterparts in the Middle East and others with influence in that
strife-torn region "to work diligently for the speedy release" of Anderson
and the other prisoners.
OPEC leader ousted by Saudis
WASHINGTON — Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's petroleum
minister for more than two decades and a key figure behind the oil em
bargo of 1973, has been fired, the Saudi government reported.
In a terse announcement, the official Saudi Press Agency today reported
the removal of Yamani, 56, the most powerful figure in the 13-country Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The agency, which gave no
reason for the ouster, said the 56-year-old Yamani was being replaced by
Planning Minister Hisham Nazer.
Oil industry sources described Nazer, who was named acting oil mini
ster, as a dramatic departure from Yamani in both style and philosophy.
However, they said it was unclear whether there would be any dramatic
shift in Saudi oil policy', at least in the short term.
The State Department could not confirm Yamani s ouster, but U.S. offi
cials have said that rumors of his removal have persisted for some time.

More AIDS funding needed
WASHINGTON — The National Academy of Sciences, lamenting
"woefully inadequate" federal programs to cope with America's new health
threat, called yesterday for creation of a National Commission on AIDS.
The prestigious academy, in a major report on the increasing problems
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said the only way to avoid a
health catastrophe in this country is to launch "perhaps the most wide
ranging and intensive efforts ever made against an infectious disease."
A panel of experts convened by the academy said the nation should be
spending about $2 billion annually by 1990, most of it new federal money,
in a multi-pronged effort to thwart the deadly disease.
Research into the nature of the viral disease, treatments and vaccines
should get $1 billion a year by the end of the decade, said Dr. David Bal
timore, a Nobel laureate who was co-chairman of the study.
An additional $1 billion a year — mostly federal money but with substan
tial contributions from state and local governments, industry and private
sources — should be spent on education and public health programs, said
Baltimore, director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in
Cambridge, Mass.
These programs would include sex education in schools, efforts to get
people at high risk of getting AIDS to change their sexual habits, blood
screening to identify those infected with the AIDS virus, rehabilitation for
drug abusers and testing the idea of providing disposable syringes to ad
dicts who refuse treatment, the panel said.
Arms proposals still stand
RAPID CITY, S.D. — President Reagan said yesterday he's directed Secre
tary of State George Shultz to inform the Soviet Union that the arms control
proposals the United States offered in Iceland "remain on the table."
"We are ready to take up where we left off in Reykjavik," Reagan said
during a stopover here on a political campaign trip.
The two sides made substantial progress on nuclear arms reductions at
the Oct. 11-12 summit before the talks collapsed. The insurmountable
issue was Reagan's refusal to accept a demand by the Soviets that research
for his so-called "Star Wars" space-based missile defense shield be
confined to laboratory work.
"We want to confirm and build on the agreements reached there,"
Reagan said in remarks prepared for a campaign rally for Sen. James
Abdnor (R-S.D.)
"I don't know of a specific agenda" for Shultz's expected meeting with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Vienna next week, White
House spokesman Larry Speakes told reporters traveling aboard Air Force
One en route here.
But Speakes did say the United States wants to "see if we can make prog
ress in one area without progress in another."
He was referring to the Soviets' insistence at the Iceland summit that all
tentative agreements on intermediate range missiles, strategic arms and
related issues were contingent on an agreement to restrict research on Star
Wars, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
Asked whether Shultz would formally propose breaking the linkage
during the Vienna talks scheduled to open Nov. 5, Speakes said, "We'll dis
cuss it."
Grenade possibly downed plane
TOKYO — The accidental explosion of a Japanese gangster's grenade
may have caused the violent five-mile plunge of a Thai jetliner that injured
62 people, press reports said yesterday.
Police said they still had reached no conclusions, but investigators have
said they believed an explosion occurred on the A-300 Airbus of Thai Air
ways International before a loss of pressure Sunday night caused the wild
descent and an emergency landing at Osaka in western Japan.
Kyodo News Service said metal fragments collected from the plane and
signs of powder smoke led to the conclusion that a grenade exploded in a
rear toilet of the plane, which was carrying 247 people on a flight from
Bangkok to Osaka via Manila.
Kyodo and three mass circulation newspapers said Osaka police were in
vestigating two Japanese men who boarded in Manila. One was described
as a 43-year-old alleged gang member from Osaka who remained hospi
talized with injuries suffered in the accident.
The newspaper Asahi said without quoting sources that someone ap
parently took a grenade onto the plane in Manila and hid it in the toilet
before the aircraft reached Osaka. It also said the possibility of a suicide at
tempt had not been ruled out.
Controller error questioned
WASHINGTON — Investigators are steering away from suggestions that
a controller's preoccupation with an errant private aircraft played
prominently in the August collision of a Mexican airliner and another
small plane near Los Angeles.
Sources close to the investigation said yesterday there are clear indica
tions that the Aeromexico Airlines jetliner and a single-engine Piper PA-28
collided before the controller became embroiled with the so-called "pop
up" aircraft.
