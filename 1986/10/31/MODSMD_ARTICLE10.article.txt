# Trade deficit narrows in Sept.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The nation's merchandise trade
deficit narrowed for the second month in a row to
$12.6 billion in September, die Commerce Depart
ment reported yesterday.
The decline, from $13 3 billion in August, was
slightly larger than expected, and it was greeted by
economists in and out of government as a decisive
turn for the better for trade.
Only two months ago, a preliminary report that the
gap between exports and imports had ballooned to a
record $18 billion in July panicked commodity and
exchange markets and may have helped provoke the
massive early September sell-off on Wall Street.
But the subsequent report that August's deficit had
shrunk to $13-3 billion led to hopes that the worst
had past. The July deficit was later revised downward
to $16 billion, and August's was nudged upward to
$14 billion.
Yesterday's report was welcome news to
Republicans seeking political ammunition in the final
days of the election campaign who may use it to sug

gest that the economy is on the right track and that
jobs lost to the trade imbalance may be regained.
The report provided several details that
economists saw as encouraging. Chief among these
was the fact that the deficit in manufactured goods,
which peaked at a crippling $16.1 billion in July, fell
to $10.5 billion. Agricultural trade, in unprecedented
deficit from May through July, had a modest surplus
— $138 million — for the second consecutive
month.
In general, imports at $30.1 billion were below the
$32 billion monthly average earlier this year, a clear
sign that the weakening dollar has begun to increase
the price of imports enough to shrink their quantity.
Less encouraging, however, was the fact that U.S. ex
ports, at $17.5 billion, were slightly below the July
and August levels and are still under the monthly
average earlier this year.
In a related report, the Labor Department saio that
the prices of imported goods have risen 0.7 percent
from June to September and that non-petroleum im

port prices have shot up 10.2 percent since Septem
ber 1985, when the administration took action to
bring the dollar's value lower in concert with the
main U.S. trading partners.
Meanwhile, there was added good economic news
in a separate Commerce Department report that new
home sales surged 10.6 percent in September, after
five coasecutive monthly declines. The September
report put the pace of new home sales so far this year
at 10.6 percent above the first nine months of 1985.
The administration seized on these upbeat reports
— the last economic statistics to be published before
Tuesday's vote — as evidence that the trade deficit,
heading for a record $170 billion this year, has at last
begun to fall and that the economy is on the verge of
renewed strong growth.
"We see no end in sight to what will most likely
prove to be the strongest post-World War II expan
sion on record,"' said White House spokesman Larry
Speakes.
