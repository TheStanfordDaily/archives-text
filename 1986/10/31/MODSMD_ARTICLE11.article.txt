## The 						Persuasion Campaign 
### 
Although many fraternity members are predicting that
the University will prohibit alcohol at Rush this spring,
administrators say they have no plans to do so.
'1 dont think anybody wants to mandate anything,"
said Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Student Affairs.
But the administration continues its campaign to per
suade Stanford's 11 housed fraternities to institute a dry
Rush of their own volition.
University President Donald Kennedy, speaking yes
terday at a lunch meeting with Daily reporters and
editors, praised Sigma Alpha Epsilon — the first housed
fraternity to announce it would not serve alcohol at Rush
functioas this spring — and said he hopes other houses
will follow suit.
To date, the SAEs are the only housed fraternity to
jump on the wagon. Several other fraternities, however,
are said to be evaluating the Rush process to determine
whether they, too, will bar alcohol.
The administratipn's language of persuasion has got
ten tough in recent weeks.
"1 reject the assumption that fraternity life is based on
drinking," Conklin said. "The reliance on alcohol to
make any function especially social is just sad."
"No sensible organization would continue a wet
Rush," Dean of Student Affairs James Lyoas said.
Administrators cite many reasons for the dry Rush
campaign.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano asserts that the pri
mary purpose of Rush is serious — for fraternity mem
bers and potential pledges to meet one another.
"Alcohol is not necessary for Rush," he said.

Conklin cites liability as a chief motivating factor.
"There are risks involved when a whole lot of people get
together and drink a whole lot of alcohol," she said.
Lyons said fraternities' alcohol consumption has con
tributed to a "pejorative stereotype." In addition, he said
housed fraternities have had difficulty meeting their
quotas over the last few years and need to change their
formula to widen their appeal.
Lyons also said fraternities' exorbitant bills for wet
Rush are contributing to the University's "socio
economic stratification," meaning that the cost of living
in a fraternity deters many students on financial aid from
pledging. He cited a recent study that showed a lower
percentage of undergraduates on financial aid live in
housed fraternities than live elsewhere at Stanford.
Informal interviews with several fraternity members
indicate that a few houses — though probably not all —
will follow the lead of the SAEs.
There is another possibility, however. Norm Robin
son, associate dean of Student Affairs, asked the Inter
fraternity Council last night to consider formulating
Rush guidelines for all fraternities to follow.
Robinson suggested that alcohol need not be
eliminated from Rush, if it is used "thoughtfully."
Several fraternity members have noted in interviews
that they favor holding non-alcoholic daytime Rush func
tions but nighttime parties with alcohol.
It seems the IFC may be able to work out a compro
mise between fraternities and the administration — Rush
guidelines that allow for some wet functions yet please
the University as well.
