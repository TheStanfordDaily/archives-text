## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper School ruling flawed 
### 
When a federal judge in Greenville, Tenn., last Friday
handed down a ruling that excuses children of fun
damentalist parents from reading certain school books,
he showed a misunderstanding of the foremost principle
of public education — that schools exist to expose stu
dents to various ideas and not to indoctrinate them into a
particular set of beliefs, whether religious or secular.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Hull said in his ruling that
the Hawkins County School Board must provide the fun
damentalist families with free public education without
violating their First Amendment rights to religious
freedom. He ruled that objecting students can substitute
other reading material to be studied under the guidance
of their families.
The ruling said county school officials violated the
constitutional rights of about a dozen elementary and
middle school children in 1983 by suspending them for
refusing to open textbooks by such writers as Margaret
Mead, Isaac Asimov and Hans Christian Anderson —
whose books their parents argued contain witchcraft, ex
otic religions, one-world government and relative ethics.
Lawyers for the school district will appeal.
The court was — and will again be — charged with
answering the question: Where is the proper balance
struck between an individual's right to extraordinary be
havior and society's right to dictate a code by which all its
members must abide — certainly the most difficult issue
facing the courts in a country that values individual

freedom as much as the United States. In the ruling in
question, the court found a balance that is tipping
precariously toward favoring the few at the expense of
the overwhelming majority.
The goal of education is to inform students of various
ways of thinking and to provide a forum for critical analy
sis. It should be left up to the individual to draw the
deeply moral conclusions from the information gleaned
in the classroom. If students are allowed to pick and
choose the books that are acceptable to their preselected
point of view, public education will not be able to carry
out its important function of preparing openminded, in
formed individuals. Additionally, a selective education
means fewer people in the mainstream classroom — a
situation that would only limit the opportunities of those
students truly interested in a broad and complete educa
tion.
Fundamentalists would have a legitimate argument if
the educational system were in the business of in
doctrinating young people into a particular point of
view. But there is a clear distinction between exposure
and indoctrination.
When a portion of the population wants to shut itself
off from important aspects of our intellectual heritage —
and a court upholds that desire — society has the right to
step in. If it does not, children in Tennessee, whether
fundamentalists or not, will be denied their right to an
openminded and complete education.
