# Democrats aid minorities
## 
### 
The elections next week bring to mind the often stated
proposition that black voters should leave the Democratic
Party and join the Republican Party; the argument presented
is that the Democratic Party has taken the black community
for granted. Whereas there are attractive political parties
other than these two, they are beyond practical reality at this
time in history.

HENRY P. ORGAN

Look at some of the major domestic issues that affect and
are of particular interest to black voters. Recall that Ronald
Reagan and the Republican Party have authored and sup
ported substantial cutbacks in social, nutritional, educa
tional, employment and training programs. The Republican
Party and Ronald Reagan are doing their damnedest to
destroy, via the Civil Rights and Equal Employment Oppor
tunity commissions, the Civil Rights Movement and pro
grams designed to improve the lot of racial minorities. The
unpleasant irony is that black Republicans have been called
upon to lead this precious effort, as if the black masses
would follow them like sheep.
Recall that it was Reagan, his administration and the Re
publican Party that supported giving federal tax-exempt
status to an educational institution that discriminated on the
basis of race; the same Reagan et al. resisted extending the
voting rights act; the same are appointing and confirming
judges whose stances cannot be considered in any way sup
portive of racial minorities (and the poor and elderly).
We can begin with the chief justice of the United States,
William Rehnquist. Here is a man cited for legal and consti
tutional brilliance, but — short of invoking the Fifth Amend
ment — couldn't remember violating the constitutional
rights of the blacks in Arizona who were attempting to vote.
No one could ever forget any such episode. Within the last
few weeks, an official of the Republican National Party wrote
a memorandum stating that the Republican Party's proposal
to pare the voting rolls in the name of "ballot integrity could
keep the black vote down considerably" in the Louisiana
elections. This is clearly a program designed by the Republi
can Party many years ago, and Rehnquist was one of the first
practitioners.
Which brings to mind the presidential campaign in which
the Rev. Jesse Jackson was a candidate. The Republican
Party's response to his candidacy was to conduct vigorous
voter registration programs in the white community be
cause more black people were registering. The sadness of
this issue is that some white individuals were — for the first
time — electing to exercise their constitutional right to vote
simply because a black person was running for the
presidency.
Not lurking far behind on the legal/coastitutional front is

Ed Meese, a Reagan Republican, whose position on constitu
tional matters is not only genocide to blacks, but anarchic
to the republic in which he stands. With such colossal ignor
ance, it is frighteneing that he plays such a critical role. Brad
Reynolds, also a Reagan Republican who spearheads per
sonal attacks on Supreme Court justices, can be lumped
with Meese, and the attacks on non-conservative judges here
and elsewhere are anchored in the Republican Party and the
Reagan administration.
It was the Reagan Republican Party and administration
that called for challenging and weakening school
desegregation plans, even when they were desired on the
local level. It was the same party and individuals that
opposed declaring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday a
national holiday. It is the same party that provides a more in
viting environment for religious fundamentalists, the Ku
Klux Klan, etc., whose views on racial minorities are well
known. Internationally, Reagan and the Republican Party are
not interested in destroying apartheid, and their policy of
constructive engagement is absurd and an insult to African-
Americans. This man and this party have not shown such
disrespect to other U.S. citizens whose ancestry extends to
European countries. Reagan and the Republican Party's po
sition on the starving and homeless in North Africa and on
this continent is genocidal and uncivilized.
From an ideological perspective, it is unthinkable that
most black citizens would find themselves at home in the
Republican party. I cannot imagine joining with such indi
viduals as Helms, Laxalt, Thurmond, Dole, Gramm, Hatch —
all Republican senators who voted against overriding
Reagan's veto of a bill imposing economic sanctions on
South Africa and for confirming Rehnquist.
Those few blacks who are Republicans must be viewed
with curiosity and treated with tolerance by other
Republicans. They must gain their popularity not because of
their embracement of the Republican Party, but because it
weakens the political power of black voters in the Dem
ocratic Party.
The Democratic Party is one of the largest in the country,
and it is the party in which black voters have the largest
percentage of participation. Even though it might be reason
ably argued that the Democratic Party has taken the black
community for granted; nevertheless it is the party the black
community has the greatest likelihood of changing. There is
no reason why black voters should dilute their impact in the
Democratic Party to "play both sides of the street," because
it cannot be done, and becuase the Republican Party has no
fundamental interest in racial minorities and the poor.
I would rather be taken for granted by a party I believe I
can change, than taken for a ride by another party in which I
shall always be in the back seat.
