# 'Soul Man' insults black community
## 
### 
On Oct 24, the UCLA Black Student Alliance led
60 people to picket "Soul Man" in Westwood in
protest of its racist content and message. This Friday,
the African/Black Student Statewide Alliance
(A/BSSA ) will coordinate pickets in Los Angeles and
the Bay Area
The movie "Soul Man" is a pathetic and paternalis
tic attempt by white liberals to provide some insights
into what it is like to be black and how racism
manifests itself on college campuses. The film at
tempts to do this through the use of comedy, and in
the process it fails miserably and winds up being
highly offensive to African-American people.

STEVEN C. PHILLIPS

The movie is about a rich, white high school stu
dent who gets accepted to Harvard Law School only
to find that his father is not going to pay his tuition.
Desperate to find money, and having been turned
down by the local bank and Harvard's financial aid
office, he takes "tanning pills" that turn his skin dark
(actually an off-shade of green). Then, he applies for
and gets a scholarship reserved for a black applicant
(who turned it down because "he got a better offer
from Stanford").
The "comedy" comes as he tries to negotiate the
twists and turns of life as a white man in black face on
a predominantly white campus. He survives a year
with a tough black teacher and falls in love with a
black woman, only to find that she was actually next
in line to get the scholarship he received. At this
point, he sees the error of his ways and repents —
wiser for the experience of having been black like us
By trotting out the whole range of black

stereotypes for the world to see, "Soul Man" merely
keeps alive ugly images better left dormant. Nobody
wants to see the spectrum of stereotypes from the
black male rapist to the lewd and leering rock star to
the sexual stud to the hustling pimp to the single
black mother. We are tired of looking at those
images. We see them every day on the 6 o'clock
news.
African-Americans are perfectly capable of telling
their own story. We don't need to rely on the
benevolence of filmmakers like Steve Tisch. In fact,
in the few cases where we obtain the resources to
produce our own works, they are generally in a class
by themselves. It is no accident that "The Cosby
Show" is the most popular television program. And it
is no accident that "The Color Purple" was the Best
Picture of the Year (despite what "the Academy"
says).
By try ing to look from the outside in to what it's
like to be black, the film winds up belittling the black
experience on white college campuses. What is con
veyed is an inaccurate and distorted portrayal of the
reality of our lives. We do not all play basketball, we
do not all listen to funk, and we are not all besieged
by guilty white women wanting to feel "400 years of
oppression with each pelvic thrust."
We are tired of looking at the world through white
eyes — especially in the college curriculum. We are
tired of being the only black person in our classes,
and we are tired of the day-to-day racism we experi
ence in our interactions with peers and professors.
And we are tired of seeing our numbers continue
to shrink on the campuses The percentage of blacks
in college has decreased by IT6 percent in California
since 1980 Our numbers on campus have been
dropping since 1976 — the year of the Bakke deci
sion.
Which brings us to the issue of financial aid. Con
trary- to the film's statements, there is not enough fin

ancial aid to go around. The director of the American
Council on Education's Office of Minority Concerns
concluded that "the federal government's shift away
from awarding scholarships and grants to providing
loans has reduced the level of assistance to black stu
dents and increased the amount to whites." The film
incorrectly suggests that there is a scholarship
available for every black applicant. Nothing could be
further from the truth.
Perhaps most disturbing is the notion that upper
class white males are somehow oppressed by this So
ciety and denied opportunity in this age of affirma
tive action (or what's left of it). As one of the charac
ters sarcastically asked, "Should we blame him for
the color of his skin?"
That was Allen Bakke's question. And the Supreme
Court, in one of its most infamous and shameful deci
sions, said UC-Davis' affirmative action policy con
stituted "reverse discrimination" against whites.
The truth is, upper class white males are not op
pressed. They run this country. Just look at corporate
boards of directors, university trustees, film produc
ers and movie stars.
The film concludes with the "star" giving back the
scholarship and agreeing to contribute a percentage
of his future income to charity. He has "overcome'
his racism and has become "sensitized" to the issue
of race.
That is the fundamental weakness of the movie. Its
making and its message are an expression of white
liberals trying to do something/or blacks. We don't
want youi enarity. We can do for ourselves, thank
you. As James Baldwin wrote: "The only thirty white
people hare that black people need, or should want,
is power — and no one holds power foret cr "
