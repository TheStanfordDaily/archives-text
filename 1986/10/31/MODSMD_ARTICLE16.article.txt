Gates of Hell eve
wasn't very scary
When I read Gwen Orel's column
(Daily, Oct. 28), I had to laugh. You
see, 1 am one of those freaked-out
little freshmen. Every story has two
sides, and one should hear both
before passing judgement.
One of my friends in the dorm
approached me one evening and
asked me if I would like to go with
him to the Rodin Sculpture Garden at
midnight that night. We felt that, at
such a late hour, the atmosphere
would be just right for adding to our
free writing notebooks.
We did not expect to see anything
terribly frightening ... and we didn't.
Sorry, Gwen.
At the garden, we found several
people setting up for a bizarre party.
We were surprised, mostly because
we hadn't anticipated finding anybody
else dumb enough to be out so late
on a Monday night.
I don't recall telling these people
that we were freshmen, but perhaps
we did. Then again, maybe they could
just tell from our dashing good looks.
When the rest of the invitees
arrived, their interesting get-together
commenced. They began to circle
around the table and chant in Latin.
Maybe they thought that their facade
would scare us off, but actually there
is nothing quite so amusing as watch
ing a group of upperclassmen play
"Ring Around the Rosie."
The Tri Sigs (as they have named
themselves) were playing weird music
on their portable tape player. I have a
very open mind about music, and so I
wondered what group it might be.
Since Gwen's column cleared this up
for me, I am relieved to know that I
will not have to go to the nearest devil
record store to pick up a copy of the
album.
For those who were participating in
the party, our freshman gullibility and
the thundering sound of our knocking
knees were very funny. The Tri Sigs
were having a good laugh on my
friends and me. I guess they didn't
realize that we were laughing, too.
Watching them walk around the gar
den and hold candles up to the trees
only made us wonder if they couldn't
hold their Hawaiian Punch. Perhaps
the Tri Sigs better consider the idea of
a dry Rush.

It is interesting to me how scared
they thought we were while at the
same time, they thought we were
judging them. I myself went back to
the dorm and got a peaceful eight
hours of sleep. Neither of my com
panions complained of violent
nightmares the next morning, either. I
am sorry that Gwen and her fiendish
friends felt that we were passing
judgement upon them. However,
because my friends and I did such a
cruel thing, we feel we should make
up for it. We would be more than
happy to hold a pity party for the Tri
Sigs. Midnight at The Gates of Hell.
See you there!
P.S. We didn't call the police. Obvi
ously, someone else thinks you're
weird, too.

action necessary
Though pretending to be a "careful
and thoughtful" response to Scott
Bohning's article in support of the
an ti-Lockheed/Stars Wars demonstra
tion (Daily, Oct. 17), Tom DePaul's
wholesale acceptance (Daily, Oct. 21)
of Reagan's vision of SDI can only be
described as hasty and gullible.
DePaul seems to have a great rever
ence for the opinions of experts. So
he must be aware that even those
scientists who feel that SDI should be
built admit that the system is unlikely
to provide much protection for the
populace of the United States, but
might be able to protect our own
missiles from attack. One might
suspect that it could also be used to
deal with a disorganized and
weakened Soviet response after a U.S.
first strike. Far from creating a
"nuclear-free world,'' SDI would only
force the Soviets to build more
missiles (along with cheap decoys and
other countermeasures) in the hope
of overloading our defensive system
and maintaining the credibility of
their own nuclear deterrent. Although
allegedly a defensive system, SDI can
only be seen by the Soviets as a
provocative pre-emption of the effec
tiveness of their weapons systems, and
they will therefore counter every
move we make. The arms race contin
ues unabated, indeed accelerated, as
each side strives to gain the upper
hand, with no stable and secure state

ever being reached for the people
these weapons allegedly protect.
Given this obvious scenario, a truly
"careful and thoughtful" observer
might be a bit hesitant to speak of
President Reagan's "moral commit
ment to peace." I suppose it is possi
ble that Reagan is dim enough not to
perceive the absurdity of his Star Wars
fantasy, but we might also remember
that the arms race has made a lot of
corporations very, very wealthy, and so
a lot of powerful people have a big
interest in keeping it going full speed
ahead. Our fearless leader has played
the role of corporate spokesman
before — in his GE days — and to me
it looks more and more like his vision
of a nuclear-free world is just another
slick ad campaign to get the American
people to pay billions of dollars for
weapons that will only make worse an
already desperate situation.
If a "careful and thougtful" person
can accept this analysis, then he must
see that the people really pushing Star
Wars are not going to be rationally
dissuaded from their efforts. It is not a
question of reason, but of profit.
Opposition to Star Wars, therefore,
must not only enlighten the people to
the real threat that it poses to their
security, but also directly confront the
power structure that supports corpor
ate interests. Actions like the one at
Lockheed show people that they can
do more than just vote for or write to
politicians who have already been
bought off by massive corporate
campaign contributions. Protests and
disruptions like and beyond those that
have characterized the anti-apartheid
movement will be necessary to con
vince those in power that we are no
longer fooled by their well-packaged
lies and are serious in our determina
tion to live in a peaceful world. These
people will abandon their selfish
quest for personal enrichment at
public expense only if it becomes too
politically expensive for them, only if
they are threatened with the loss of
control over a significant segment of
the population. It is true, the conse
quences of such resistance are not
always pleasant. I myself was arrested
at Lockheed and did discover that
protest "is frowned upon by the auth
orities"; I guess that's why the "careful
and thoughtful" Mr. DePaul decided
to stay quietly at home and "advise
caution."

the role of corporate spokesman
before — in his GE days — and to me
it looks more and more like his vision
of a nuclear-free world is just another
slick ad campaign to get the American
people to pay billions of dollars for
weapons that will only make worse an
already desperate situation.
If a "careful and thougtful" person
can accept this analysis, then he must
see that the people really pushing Star
Wars are not going to be rationally
dissuaded from their efforts. It is not a
question of reason, but of profit.
Opposition to Star Wars, therefore,
must not only enlighten the people to
the real threat that it poses to their
security, but also directly confront the
power structure that supports corpor
ate interests. Actions like the one at
Lockheed show people that they can
do more than just vote for or write to
politicians who have already been
bought off by massive corporate
campaign contributions. Protests and
disruptions like and beyond those that
have characterized the anti-apartheid
movement will be necessary to con
vince those in power that we are no
longer fooled by their well-packaged
lies and are serious in our determina
tion to live in a peaceful world. These
people will abandon their selfish
quest for personal enrichment at
public expense only if it becomes too
politically expensive for them, only if
they are threatened with the loss of
control over a significant segment of
the population. It is true, the conse
quences of such resistance are not
always pleasant. I myself was arrested
at Lockheed and did discover that
protest "is frowned upon by the auth
orities"; I guess that's why the "careful
and thoughtful" Mr. DePaul decided
to stay quietly at home and "advise
caution."

wasn't very scary
When I read Gwen Orel's column
(Daily, Oct. 28), I had to laugh. You
see, 1 am one of those freaked-out
little freshmen. Every story has two
sides, and one should hear both
before passing judgement.
One of my friends in the dorm
approached me one evening and
asked me if I would like to go with
him to the Rodin Sculpture Garden at
midnight that night. We felt that, at
such a late hour, the atmosphere
would be just right for adding to our
free writing notebooks.
We did not expect to see anything
terribly frightening ... and we didn't.
Sorry, Gwen.
At the garden, we found several
people setting up for a bizarre party.
We were surprised, mostly because
we hadn't anticipated finding anybody
else dumb enough to be out so late
on a Monday night.
I don't recall telling these people
that we were freshmen, but perhaps
we did. Then again, maybe they could
just tell from our dashing good looks.
When the rest of the invitees
arrived, their interesting get-together
commenced. They began to circle
around the table and chant in Latin.
Maybe they thought that their facade
would scare us off, but actually there
is nothing quite so amusing as watch
ing a group of upperclassmen play
"Ring Around the Rosie."
The Tri Sigs (as they have named
themselves) were playing weird music
on their portable tape player. I have a
very open mind about music, and so I
wondered what group it might be.
Since Gwen's column cleared this up
for me, I am relieved to know that I
will not have to go to the nearest devil
record store to pick up a copy of the
album.
For those who were participating in
the party, our freshman gullibility and
the thundering sound of our knocking
knees were very funny. The Tri Sigs
were having a good laugh on my
friends and me. I guess they didn't
realize that we were laughing, too.
Watching them walk around the gar
den and hold candles up to the trees
only made us wonder if they couldn't
hold their Hawaiian Punch. Perhaps
the Tri Sigs better consider the idea of
a dry Rush.

It is interesting to me how scared
they thought we were while at the
same time, they thought we were
judging them. I myself went back to
the dorm and got a peaceful eight
hours of sleep. Neither of my com
panions complained of violent
nightmares the next morning, either. I
am sorry that Gwen and her fiendish
friends felt that we were passing
judgement upon them. However,
because my friends and I did such a
cruel thing, we feel we should make
up for it. We would be more than
happy to hold a pity party for the Tri
Sigs. Midnight at The Gates of Hell.
See you there!
P.S. We didn't call the police. Obvi
ously, someone else thinks you're
weird, too.

Though pretending to be a "careful
and thoughtful" response to Scott
Bohning's article in support of the
an ti-Lockheed/Stars Wars demonstra
tion (Daily, Oct. 17), Tom DePaul's
wholesale acceptance (Daily, Oct. 21)
of Reagan's vision of SDI can only be
described as hasty and gullible.
DePaul seems to have a great rever
ence for the opinions of experts. So
he must be aware that even those
scientists who feel that SDI should be
built admit that the system is unlikely
to provide much protection for the
populace of the United States, but
might be able to protect our own
missiles from attack. One might
suspect that it could also be used to
deal with a disorganized and
weakened Soviet response after a U.S.
first strike. Far from creating a
"nuclear-free world,'' SDI would only
force the Soviets to build more
missiles (along with cheap decoys and
other countermeasures) in the hope
of overloading our defensive system
and maintaining the credibility of
their own nuclear deterrent. Although
allegedly a defensive system, SDI can
only be seen by the Soviets as a
provocative pre-emption of the effec
tiveness of their weapons systems, and
they will therefore counter every
move we make. The arms race contin
ues unabated, indeed accelerated, as
each side strives to gain the upper
hand, with no stable and secure state

ever being reached for the people
these weapons allegedly protect.
Given this obvious scenario, a truly
"careful and thoughtful" observer
might be a bit hesitant to speak of
President Reagan's "moral commit
ment to peace." I suppose it is possi
ble that Reagan is dim enough not to
perceive the absurdity of his Star Wars
fantasy, but we might also remember
that the arms race has made a lot of
corporations very, very wealthy, and so
a lot of powerful people have a big
interest in keeping it going full speed
ahead. Our fearless leader has played
the role of corporate spokesman
before — in his GE days — and to me
it looks more and more like his vision
of a nuclear-free world is just another
slick ad campaign to get the American
