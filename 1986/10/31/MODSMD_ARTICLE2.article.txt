# AP test may not exempt
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Starting next fall, the Advanced
Placement test in English probably will
not be used to exempt undergraduates
from the freshman writing require
ment, the dean of undergraduate
studies told the Faculty Senate yester
day.
However, English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz provided the meeting's fireworks,
charging that the Hoover Institution,
like Georgetown University's think
tank, has strong ties to daily political
life in Washington, D.C. Georgetown
decided two weeks ago to separate it
self from its Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).
Faculty complaints about
deficiencies in undergraduate writing
— even among students who received
high scores on the AP test — are com
mon, said Undergraduate Studies Dean
Carolyn Lougee.
"The English faculty has come to
believe this exemption (on the basis of
the AP test) is not justified. It is a
literature test, not a writing test,"
Lougee said.
When the senate originally instituted
freshman English in 1969,10 to 15 per
cent of incoming freshmen were ex
pected to test out of the writing re
quirement, she said. Thirty-nine per
cent of this year's freshman class, she
said, were exempted from the two
quarter writing course.
One-quarter intensive writing
courses would be available for those
students who pass the AP test, if suffici
ent funds are allocated from the Uni
versity budget.
Citing Hoover annual reports from
1982 to 1985, Rebholz said an average
of 50 Hoover Institution scholars
served in the federal government per
year and that 1,265 editorial opinions
were published.
He criticized the comments of John
Cogan, Hoover's principal associate
director, who told The Daily last week
that the institution was "much more
divorced from daily political events in
Washington" than the Georgetown
think tank.
"Don't you find Mr. Cogan's distinc
tion between the Hoover Institution
and CSIS disingenuous?" Rebholz
asked University President Donald
Kennedy.
Kennedy said the two institutions
differ because of Hoover's archives, a
collection considered one of the
world's best on 20th-century history
