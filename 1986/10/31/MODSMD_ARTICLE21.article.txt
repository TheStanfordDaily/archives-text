## 15 years of Black Performing Arts 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Artists realized long ago that political points are
better made not through turgid polemicizing but
through the arts. Using the arts as a vehicle for com
mentary or ideas is a time-honored means of com
munication. Culture, of course, does not always com
ment on specific issues (it seems to do so less and
less nowadays); often it serves a more general but
nonetheless important function. The Black Perform
ing Arts group on the Stanford campus is a good case
in point.
"Black Americans have made tremendous contri
butions to America's cultural life, and we want to see
those contributions validated," says Sandra Richards,
director of the Committee on Black Performing Arts,
explaining the raison d'etre for the committee. Black
Performing Arts has been an official part of Stanford
since 1971, and it existed in a nascent form for three
years before that. In the 1968-69 school year, when
the black studies movement was gaining momentum
on campuses nationwide, black students at Stanford
were also trying to find courses more relevant to
their interests. Out of this impetus came the Black
Performing Arts group, originally an entirely student
run affair that sought to reflect the existence of black
Americans via the arts.
Sandra Richards was a graduate student at the in
ception of BPA; today she is a full professor of drama.
And in 1986 the BPA is a formal organization under
the School of Humanities, as it has been for the past

15 years. The organization is now managed by a com
mittee consisting of faculty and administration mem
bers — Kennell Jackson (history, African and Afro-
American studies), Halifu Osmare (dance), John
Rickford (linguistics), James Cadena (Row Housing)
— and student representative Daniel Coles. BPA has
expanded in other ways as well, broadening its
horizons from defining black American identity to a
more international context.
Naturally, this broader view centers around the
study of African culture. Said committee member
Osmare: "We in the West are just now beginning to
really awaken to African culture," citing as evidence
last month's award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to
Nigerian playwright Wole Soyinka, the first time an
African ever won the prestigious Nobel in Literature.
Any Soyinka production is a long way down the
road, but already scheduled for this February is
"Farewell to a Cannibal Rage" by another Nigerian
writer, Femi Osofisan, who will be visiting the Stan
ford campus next week. Work on the Osofisan play
has drawn the support of the Bay Area's Nigerian
community. The ever-growing popularity of reggae
and African music, in addition to the cultural diver
sity of people in the Bay Area, make this a supportive
environment for the committee.
Which is fortunate, because Richards plans to turn
to off-campus fund raising in the future. Like every
other department on campus, the BPA has to deal
with cutbacks, but Richards and Osmare hope to con
tinue expanding the organization. They have a fairly
sizable goal in mind: "We hope that by the end of the

year every student will know what Black Performing
Arts is," Osmare said Their plans include a confer
ence at the end of this school year in which noted tal
ents in black theater discuss the current state of black
theater, particularly as it exists in California. In the
nearer future, the BPA will present a free showing of
the film "Dance Black America," a well-reviewed pro
duction that was shown last year on PBS's "Great Per
formances." The film features two members of the
Citicentre Dance Theatre (which, not coincedentally,
was brought to Dinkelspiel Auditorium last Saturday
evening), Leon Jackson and Stanford's own Halifu
Osmare.
With all these plans, and the BPA's new interna
tional focus, Richards is making sure the BPA also
sticks to its original purposes of creating courses in
the black performing arts to be taught on campus,
finding qualified black instructors to teach these
courses and giving technical assistance and funding
to students who seek to put on their own black per
forming arts productions. The committee was
originally formed in response to student agitation,
and Richards particularly wants a great deal of stu
dent involvement in the BPA group.
Richards summed up the BPA's future plans: "Our
productions let students explore aspects of the Amer
ican identity, which, especially for white students,
may be different from the perspectives they grew up
in. In the future, we're going to continue our interna
tional exploration, while not losing sight of the chal
lenges at home."
