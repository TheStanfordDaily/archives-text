The General (1926)
Parkside, San Francisco
James Agee wrcxe of Buster Keaton, "He
used this great, sad, motionless face to
suggest various related things: a one-track
mind near the track's end of pure insanity;
mulish imperturbability under the wildest
of circumstances; how dead a human
being can get and still be alive; an awe
inspiring sort of patience and power to
endure, proper to granite but uncanny in
flesh and blood." "The General" is pos
sibly the greatest of all silent comedies.
Keaton plays a trainman during the Civil
War, and Marion Mack, whose marionette
like solemnity is an ideal match for his
poker face, stars opposite him. The gags
are masterfully calculated; they operate
like amazing, intricate clockwork. And the
look of the film is, along with "The Birth
of a Nation," the closest movies have ever
gotten to Remington's paintings.
Plays tonight with "The Great Dictator,"
"The Dentist," "The Music Box" and "Take
the Money and Run."

On the Waterfront (1954)
Bechtel International Center
Terry Malloy, has-been fighter turned
dock worker, represented the smashed
dreams of a generation when this film was
released in the mid-19505, and there is
still much in this portrait of a decent, inex
pressive guy trying to deal with the web of
corruption he is caught in to move
audiences. Crude as parts of Budd Schul
berg's script are, and despite Karl Mai
den s characteristic mugging in the role of
the priest, the movie still packs a hell of a
punch. As Terry, Marlon Brando gives his
most amazing early performance; one can
just imagine how the audiences of the
time responded to those magnetic Nean
derthal looks and the impassioned ear
nestness of his acting. Eva Marie Saint and
Rod Steiger are excellent, but Brando
blows everyone else off the screen. Di
rected by Eliz Kazan, whom every young
actor in America was dying to work with
(having discovered Brando — for "A
Streetcar Named Desire" — he went on to
find James Dean), shot by Boris Kaufman
and with a classic Leonard Bernstein
score.
Plays Sunday at 8 p.m.

Back to School
Memorial Auditorium
If you like Rodney Dangerfield and his
aggressive, cynical, overbearing style of
humor, then you'll probably like this
movie, which has been strung together as
little more than a showcase for its star.
Even Dangerfield fans will get tired of the
sticky, sentimental story, in which Danger
field decides to go back and get his degree
as a way of encouraging his son to stay in
school. But the gags are good enough and
frequent enough to help you ignore the
plot, and Dangerfield cruises through the
whole thing as if he were in another
movie, anyway.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.

Bye Bye Brazil (I960)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed by
Carlos Diegues, is a funny, occasionally
raunchy comedy about trying to survive in
a country that's "progressing" so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind. The movie
begins when a carnival, crammed onto a
beat-up flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town in the Brazilian backlands. The
troupe can offer nothing to anyone:
They're neither cynical enough to com
pete with the new entertainment, televi
sion, nor sincere enough to bring the
miracles that the television-less peasants
expect from them. The only thing left to
the troupe, it seems, is prostitution, and
that is what they must turn to to survive.
Director Diegues does a fine job of high
lighting this clash between dreams and
economics.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Quilombo."

The Color of Money
Century 10, Mountain View
"The Color of Money" is a great sports
movie, which, given the director (Martin
Scorsese) and star (Paul Newman), is aw
fully disappointing. There are terrific ac
tion sequences (if you consider pool ac
tion), lots of dark and seedy interiors
which have been beautifully shot by Mi
chael Ballhaus, and all the hyped-up,
"Rocky"-style dramatics you could want;
but it's an empty movie, concerned with
nothing but its own style. The script,
which exhumes "The Hustler," Fast Eddie
Felsen, 20 years later (he's now a liquor
wholesaler) and pairs him with a flashy
young pool shark (Tom Cruise), doesn't
give Newman much to play, he's great to
look at, a d everything he does seems
right, but he inly gets to cut loose in a
couple of scene- The real emblem of the
movie is Cruise; he can't act (I mean, the
man really cannot act), and therefore
bases his performances on nothing but his
stylish moves and engaging grin. He's all
right there on the surface, just like the
movie.

Blow Up (1966)
Red Vic, San Francisco
The "blow up" of the title is an enlarge
ment of a photograph that may or may not
have captured a murder. The larger the
photograph becomes, the grainier and
more mysterious it gets; in this movie, get
ting closer — to things or to people —
brings only greater confusion about how
things stand. Directed by Michelangelo
Antonioni, "Blow Up," which premiered
in 1966, became one of the most influen
tial films of the '60s in its sense of isolation
amid plenty. David Hemmings plays the
swinging London photographer who
becomes obsessed with his own photo
graph: Vanessa Redgrave plays the woman
who is somehow involved with the mur
der. The great color photography is by
Carlo Di Palma.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday.

Buckaroo Banzai (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Buckaroo Banzai" is a poorly
structured, hard-to-understand mess; it's
also an incredibly funny movie. Director
W.D. Richter and writer Earl Mac Rauch
have put together both a parody of, and
loving tribute to, the American pulp sen
sibility; their movie combines elements of
comic books, pulp action novels, schlocky
science fiction movies and deadpan '80s
humor. With Peter Weller as Buckaroo,
the brain surgeon/rock star/crime fighting
superhero; John Lithgow as Dr. Emilio
Lizardo, the mad scientist to end all mad
scientists; Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin and
Christopher Lloyd.
Plays Thursday and next Friday with
"Repo Man."

Repo Man (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The funniest fairly terrible under
ground comedy since "Death Race 2000."
The movie lacks structure and half of the
plot elements don't pan out, but not be
cause the director, Alex Cox, has no talent
— he just isn't interested in narrative, or in
character either. What keep the movie
going are his new age sense of humor, the
way he replays or builds on gags in the
most surprising new contexts, and the
desolate suburban low-life mood set by
Robby Muller's underlit cinematography.
Emilio Estevez (son of the actor Martin
Sheen) plays Cox's alienated teenage
hero, Otto, and Harry Dean Stanton,
whose elongated, undernourished face
could be the movie's emblem, plays the
automobile repossession man who hires
him on.
Plays Thursday and next Friday with
"Buckaroo Banzai."

Phantom of die Paradise (1974)
UC Theater, Berkeley
Brian De Palma made this wild,
hilarious spoof of horror movies and rock
singers with the freedom he enjoyed in
his underground movie days. The plot is
basically modeled on "The Phantom of the
Opera," with Paul Williams (who wrote
the satirical songs, which are surprisingly,
wickedly clever) as the impresario, Jessica
Harper as the promising young singer,
and William Finley as the brilliant com
poser who is turned into a monster and
resides in the upper reaches of the
theater, where he watches over the girl he
adores. The movie — a marvelous enter
tainment that deserves the reputation
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show"
received — is replete with visual and vo
cal references: there are borrowings from
"The Picture of Dorian Gray," "Psycho,"
"The Godfather," "The Manchurian Candi
date" and even "Bye Bye Birdie." The un
usually winning cast also includes Gerrit
Graham as a pop idol and, as three differ
ent rock trios, Harold Oblong, Jeffrey
Comanor and Archie Hahn.
Plays tonight with "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show."

The Great Dictator (1940)
Parkside, San Francisco
Charles Chaplin's first talkie, and his
first serious mistake. He plays a Hitler-like
dictator and his double, a Jewish barber;
in the course of the movie, the barber is
mistaken for the dictator and gets to orate
at length, in the last scene, on the need for
world peace. This plea, delivered by
Chaplin with his face clenched tight, is so
appallingly overwritten and maudlin that
many people must have been sorry he'd
ever opened his mouth on screen in the
first place. There are, thank heaven, a few

redeeming comic sequences — one in
which Chaplin dances with a balloon
globe, one in which he shaves a customer
to music on the radio, and a one
upmanship contest between the dictator
and a Mussolini send-up played by Jack
Oakie. With Paulette Goddard, Reginald
Gardiner, Henry Daniell, Chester Conklin
and Billy Gilbert.
Plays tonight (see "The General").

The Cabinet of Dr. Callgarl (1919)
Noe Valley Ministry, San Francisco
Robert Wiene's celebrated film is a fas
cinating artifact of the German Expres
sionist epoch, but though it's undeniably a
work of art, dramatically it's not a very sat
isfying one. Static and self-consciously ex
perimental, it didn't point movies in a di
rection other filmmakers cared to follow.
The visual strategy of the film is that the
stylized sets project the workings of a
madman's mind. At the center of this
Freudian fantasy are Werner Kraus as
Caligari and Conrad Veidt as Cesare the
somnambulist.
Plays tonight with "The Telltale Heart"
and "Silent Snow, Secret Snow" at the
ministry, 1021 Sanchez St.

Dersu Uzala (1977)
UC Theater, Berkeley
Akira Kurosawa filmed this picture in
Russia; it is about an amazing old Mongol
who is hired as scout for a cartographical
expedition and his friendship with the
chief of that expedition. Dersu lives in
perfect harmony with nature; he teaches
the Russians how to reap her benefits
without disturbing her balance. This is a
very unusual movie: sweet natured and yet
so grand visually that it takes one's breath
away. Kurosawa and his photographers
make woods, snow and even the embers
of a campfire so vivid that Dersu's insis
tence that each is the embodiment of an
independent spirit actually seems likely.
Among a number of great sequences is
one that might have been conceived by
Hans Christian Anderson: Dersu saves
himself and his new comrade from the
fury of a snowstorm by building a shelter
out of brush, and as the two men set to
work with apparently superhuman speed
and construct something strong and as
tonishingly beautiful out of nothing, the
task takes on a magical aura.
Plays tomorrow with "The Emerald For
est."
— S.V.
Napoleon (1927)
UC Theater, Berkeley
Kevin Brownlow reconstructed Abel
Gance's silent epic in 1981, and Carmine
Coppola furnished a splendid full-length
score; one of the great achievements of
film scholarship, this resurrected four
hour "Napoleon" is a tribute to one of the
world's great directors. One could argue
that Gance's historical perspective lacks
depth and credibility, but "Napoleon" isn't
a psychological study of a conquerer, and
it isn't even a view of history — it's about

the excitement of making movies, about
going farther than anyone ever had before
(and most people have since). Cameras
are attached to horses and carriages and
swing, pendulum-like, in the great con
vention scene; the screen breaks up into
nine frames to represent the chaos of a
children's pillow fight; a storm at sea is in
tercut with the "storm" at the National As
sembly, and the visualization of the meta
phor lends it staggering force. Gance's
tone is joyous and playful; the camera
seems to be grinning.
Plays Sunday.

The Trial (1963)
Red Vic, San Francisco
Franz Kafka's famous novel was an odd
choice for Orson Welles to film, and his
movie has a number of dreadful mistakes
in it (like an inappropriate jazz score). But
it's fascinating, too: shot against a bleak,
post-T.S. Eliot landscape of concrete apart
ment buildings and rows of lamp posts
piercing a foggy, gray sky, it's full of visual
coups and scenes that don't quote work
but are intriguing anyway. Anthony
Perkins gives Joseph K. too many nervous
tics, but by the middle of the film his per
formance begins to make some sense. The
real stars are Welles' camera and Edmond
Richmond's lighting. Welles turns up in
person as the Advocate (it's not one of his
better performances), as do Jeanne
Moreau, Elsa Martinelli, Romy Schneider
and Akim Tamiroff.
Plays Thursday.
— S.V.
Picnic at Hanging Rock (1978)
Red Vic, San Francisco
Peter Weir's jigsaw puzzle picture about
a party of English schoolgirls in 1900 who
fail to return from a nature outing. The
film is based on a true (and unsolved)
mystery, and Weir and the screenwriter,
Cliff Green, don't solve it for us, either;
they leave out all the revealing puzzle
pieces. Some people have found this film
erotic and provocative. It's certainly well
shot, anyway (by Russell Boyd). With Ra
chel Roberts as the headmistress, Mrs. Ap
pleyard.
Plays Sunday and Monday.
