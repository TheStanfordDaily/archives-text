## Men's soccer, SJSU to tangle 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
In the words of Stanford Coach Sam Koch, "Spirits are
up."
Laughing, joking and friendly ribbing pervaded Maloney
Field at Wednesday afternoon's practice. The tension that
existed from three consecutive shutouts has been replaced
by positive thoughts.
The Cardinal men's soccer team successfully broke its
three-game scoreless streak last Sunday in an impressive 3-1
loss to the University of San Francisco, ranked eighth in the
nation. Stanford will tiy to get back in the win column tomor
row at San Jose State University. SJSU is 6-8-3, 1-4 in the
Pacific Soccer Conference.
The Cardinal takes a record of 5-9-2, 0-3 in the confer
ence, into tomorrow's game. The Cardinal fell out of the con
ference race with its third loss of the season. In its three
remaining conference games, Stanford faces SJSU, Santa
Clara and California.

USF had a 12-game winning streak and a 14-1-3 record (6-
0 in conference play) following its victory over Stanford.
The Dons no longer have a lock on the conference title. The
Golden Bears pulled the upset of the season with a 1-0 vic
tory over USF Tuesday to put the league championship up
for grabs.
Stanford is caught in the middle of the scramble. The
Cardinal will play a major role in determining who winds
up on top.
"We're the spoiler," Koch said. " We have a chance to
knock some teams off. Saturday is the opening day of our
November season. We're 0-0. We have a six-game schedule,
and we're ready to play. (Junior midfielder Brian) Mahaffey
and (sophomore midifielder Luke) Garrot are both back
from injuries and playing better."
Stanford will primarily be gunning for Santa Clara and
California. SJSU fell out of contention with a 1-0 loss to Santa
Clara Wednesday. The Pacific Soccer Conference, however,
epitomizes balance. When Pete Rozelle envisioned parity in
the NFL, this is what he had in mind.


Quarterback John Paye will be looking to get the Cardinal offense
back on track against Washington State tomorrow. Last week
