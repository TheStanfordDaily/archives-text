# Water polo travels south for Pepperdine, tourney
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
In perhaps its most challenging weekend of play yet this
season, the Stanford men's water polo team will leave the
friendly confines of DeGuerre Pool and travel to face five of
the nation's top 10 teams within a three-day span.
It will mark the first time since Sept. 28 that the top-rated
Cardinal (25-0, 3-0 in Pacific-10 play) will play away from
home.
Today, Stanford will put its 34-game winning streak on
the line against No. 4 Pepperdine at 3 p.m. in Malibu.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal goes against No. 7 UC-Irvine at
10:20 a.m. and No. 8 Santa Barbara at 5:20 p.m. Saturday and
Sunday, Stanford will participate in the 49er Invitational at
the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. Sunday, Stanford will
most likely play No. 2 California for the fifth time this year
and No. 3 UCLA for the third time this season. The morning
game will begin at 9:10 a.m.
"This is definitely the toughest weekend for us this year,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "It's in a tournament
like this, where we play so many games in one weekend,
that upsets can occur."
The Cardinal enters this weekend's play coming off a
dominating homestand last weekend. Stanford defeated
Long Beach State 14-6, USC 9-4 and Brown 13-2.
With seven goals over the weekend, junior Erich Fischer
upped his team-leading score total to 64 goals, followed by
seniors Craig KJass with 61 and David Imbernino with 40.

In 18-6 Pepperdine, the Cardinal will tackle a team on the
move. Since falling to Stanford 12-10 on Sept. 27, the Waves
have climbed from No. 7 to No. 4 in the national rankings. It
is a team comprised of several foreign players, including
two from Yugoslavia.
"They have an excellent team," Dettamanti said. "They
shoot the ball real well. Because they have a lot of foreign
ers on the team, they are difficult to play against. I expect a
high scoring game."
The Cardinal will wind up the weekend with the 49er In
vitational. It was in this tournament last season that Stanford
suffered its last loss, a 6-5 defeat in overtime against Long
Beach State.
Eight of the nation's top-10 teams will participate in the
tournament, including Pac-10 rivals Cal, UCLA and USC.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal will play against two teams it has
already mastered this year: Irvine and Santa Barbara. Stan
ford has defeated Irvine twice this season, 12-5 at the Irvine
Tournament and 10-4 at DeGuerre. The Cardinal bested the
Gauchos 10-8 in Santa Barbara on Sept. 18.
"We shouldn't have much of a problem against those
teams'," Dettamanti said. "We have beaten both teams pretty
handily."
Sunday, however, Stanford could face the nation's
second- and third-rated teams in one day. In addition, the
schedule calls for the Cardinal to play back-to-back games,
rather than the usual rest between starts.
"I expect Cal to be really improved," Dettamanti said. "All
the rest of our games are big games."
