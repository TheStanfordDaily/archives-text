Jose State field hockey teams.
On Oct. 1, freshman Sheryl
Sorg's hat trick led the Spartans to a
convincing 3-1 victory over the
Cardinal. The win pushed San Jose
State's record in the Northern

NorPac and 2-4-1 overall. The three
goals gave the Spartans seven for
the season â€” each one scored by
Sorg.

six of its last seven games
(including a 1-0 loss Wednesday to
previously winless Chico State), and

goal. Meanwhile, Stanford has won
seven straight games, ail by shutout,
to up its NorPac mark to 3-1-1, one

point behind conference leader
University of the Pacific.
The Cardinal will be looking to
avenge its lone NorPac defeat today
when it hosts the Spartans at 3 p.m.

have a lot of power. We weren't
playing the game the way we're
supposed to."
Lately, however, Stanford has
been playing the way it's supposed
to. In its last seven games, the Card
inal has outscored its opponents 11-
0. And according to Asst. Coach
Noelle Mitchell, who has taken over
