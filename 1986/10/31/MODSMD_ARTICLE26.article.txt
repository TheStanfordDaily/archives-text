# Field hockey to play SJSU
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Things have changed quite a bit
in a month for the Stanford and San
Jose State field hockey teams.
On Oct. 1, freshman Sheryl
Sorg's hat trick led the Spartans to a
convincing 3-1 victory over the
Cardinal. The win pushed San Jose
State's record in the Northern
Pacific Conference to 2-2, 2-2-1
overall. Stanford fell to 0-1-1 in the
NorPac and 2-4-1 overall. The three
goals gave the Spartans seven for
the season â€” each one scored by
Sorg.
Since then, San Jose State has lost
six of its last seven games
(including a 1-0 loss Wednesday to
previously winless Chico State), and
Sorg has scored only one more
goal. Meanwhile, Stanford has won
seven straight games, ail by shutout,
to up its NorPac mark to 3-1-1, one

point behind conference leader
University of the Pacific.
The Cardinal will be looking to
avenge its lone NorPac defeat today
when it hosts the Spartans at 3 p.m.
"That loss we had, 1 don't think
anyone was on that day," said for
ward Kat Thomas, Stanford's
leading scorer with four goals. "We
didn't have any spirit. We're playing
much better now."
Senior defender Mary Goodman
agreed. "I think we just broke down
defensively," she said. "We didn't
have a lot of power. We weren't
playing the game the way we're
supposed to."
Lately, however, Stanford has
been playing the way it's supposed
to. In its last seven games, the Card
inal has outscored its opponents 11-
0. And according to Asst. Coach
Noelle Mitchell, who has taken over
the team while Stanford Coach Sheryl
Johnson is traveling with the United
States National Team, the squad is still
developing.
"It's been a constant learning phase
for them." Mitchell said.
The Stanford defense will not be
specifically keying on Sorg today.

Goodman said, "Whoever is playing
defense on her will have it on her
mind that she did that (a hat trick) to
us."
Mitchell believes the Cardinal is the
stronger team but that the revenge fac
tor should eliminate the possibility of
overconfidence. "We should definitely
dominate, but we're not going to take
San Jose State lightly," she said.
"They're the one team that has spoiled
our record, and our kids aren't going
to forget it. We won't let down."
