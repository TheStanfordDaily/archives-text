# Card faces WSU: final home game
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It is only fitting that Stanford host Washington
State on Halloween weekend. The last time the
teams met, the result was worse than any Cardinal
nightmare.
With four minutes to go in the third quarter
two years ago, Stanford enjoyed a 42-14 lead.
Then disaster struck. And again. Yet again. Five
times in all.
A 28-point lead had vanished, and, when the
Cardinal woke up, it found itself on the losing
end of a 49-42 score. It was the biggest lead
blown in Pacific 10 Conference history, and it
kept Stanford from a winning season in that 5-6
year.
"All I remember," Cougar Coach Jim Walden
said, "is that we were behind a little bit, and we
got lucky. We also had a tailback named Rueben
Mayes and a quarterback named Mark Rypien. We
don't have them this year."
The problem for Walden is that he isn't quite
sure what he does have this year. He has a team
that beat USC for the first time in 30 years. He also
has a team that is the only one to lose to hapless
California this year.
Last week, the Cougars played their first game
after the USC victory at UCLA after a week off.
They lost, 54-16.
"We had 235 yards on offense," Walden said.

"We've had years where we've had that in a quar
ter. We threw and caught the ball as badly as we
have all season."
Washington State started out slowly, losing
games to Cal and San Jose State. Since then, a tie
against league-leader Arizona State and the win
over USC have helped the Cougars to a 3-3-1
record, 2-2-1 in the Pac-10.
"I thought I had a bunch of kids headed for the
tank," Walden said. "We've come too far with this
program for that. I've got to teach them you can't
quit when adversity strikes. For the first time,
after UCLA, they had their heads down. When we
came back from Cal, 1 don't think our players un
derstood what fools they made of themselves."
Things have changed at this end as well in the
last two years. The last time he came down, Wal
den said how happy he was to visit the Farm and
see "that guy dressed up like a tree."
Not this time. "I'm impressed," he said of the
Cardinal. "I'm super-impressed. I'm sorry I'm im
pressed. They've played with intensity every
week. Sometime I'd like to talk to Jack about that.
I can't seem to motivate my guys. They're 5-2. I'm
scared to death, to be honest with you.
"I don't think anyone has linebackers as good
as (David) Wyman and (Barry) McKeever. Other
guys have talent, but they've performed out
there."
