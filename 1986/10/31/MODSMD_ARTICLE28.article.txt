# St. Mary's downs Card 2-1
## 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
Establishing a lead and holding a
lead are two different things, as the
Stanford women's soccer team
found out yesterday. At St. Mary's, the
Cardinal lost once again after leading
the opponents for a good deal of the
match.
The Gaels of St. Mary's came back
in the second half to beat the Card
inal 2-1, bringing the Cardinal losing
streak to six games.
According to Stanford Coach
Helen Keohane, Stanford was
plagued by near misses on offense

and a general lack of defensive
tenacity.
"We weren't able to capitalize on
great chances they (the Gaels) gave
to us," Keohane said. "The tide
began to turn— We weren't able to
control the midfield."
Stanford began the game in its
usual style. At the seven-minute
mark, freshman midfielder Tonya
Antonucci scored her fifth goal of the
season, lofting a high chip-shot over
St. Mary's goalkeeper Beth Litell.
Stacey Keare was responsible for the
assist.
The Cardinal managed to hold this
early lead for more than 50 minutes.

At the 59-minute mark though, the
Gaels evened the score on a shot
from the outer left corner of the
goalie's box. At this point, "the mo
mentum was in their favor,"
Keohane said.
Seven minutes later, the Gaels'
star scorer, Desi Engle, scored her
team's second goal. It was the 13th
goal of the season for Engle, setting a
new Gael record.
The remainder of the game con
sisted of absolute domination by St.
Mary's. The Gaels ended up taking
twice as many shots as the Cardinal,
although most of Stanford's attempts
were dangerously close to goals.
The closeness with which Stanford
has played most of its opponents is ad
mirable, yet it has been a frustrating
season. "We're able to score first, but
we're not able to finish people off,"
Keohane said.
The final game of the season is now
approaching, however. Tomorrow, the
Cardinal will play the Santa Clara
Broncos, a steady, well disciplined
squad.

The Broncos are 8-4-2 this season
Much of their success this year can be
attributed to their junior forward, Jenni
Symons. Symons has accumulated a
formidable 19 goals diis season, as well
as six assists. In the last 35 games she
has played, Symons has scored a total
of 35 points.
»The Bronco defense will be a diffi
cult obstacle for the Cardinal. Goalie
Wendy Johansen has led Santa Clara to
two shutouts this season, as well as al
lowing an average of only 1.23 goals
per game.
Stanford hopes to both improve its
11-3-1 record against Santa Clara, and
to build confidence for next year's
team. The game will be played at
Maloney Field at 12 p.m. tomorrow.
