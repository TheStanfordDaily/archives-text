### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
Establishing a lead and holding a
lead are two different things, as the
Stanford women's soccer team
found out yesterday. At St. Mary's, the
Cardinal lost once again after leading
the opponents for a good deal of the
match.
The Gaels of St. Mary's came back
in the second half to beat the Card
inal 2-1, bringing the Cardinal losing
streak to six games.
According to Stanford Coach
Helen Keohane, Stanford was
plagued by near misses on offense

and a general lack of defensive
tenacity.
"We weren't able to capitalize on
great chances they (the Gaels) gave
to us," Keohane said. "The tide
began to turnâ€” We weren't able to
control the midfield."
Stanford began the game in its
usual style. At the seven-minute
mark, freshman midfielder Tonya
Antonucci scored her fifth goal of the
season, lofting a high chip-shot over
St. Mary's goalkeeper Beth Litell.
Stacey Keare was responsible for the
assist.
The Cardinal managed to hold this
early lead for more than 50 minutes.

At the 59-minute mark though, the
Gaels evened the score on a shot
from the outer left corner of the
goalie's box. At this point, "the mo
mentum was in their favor,"
Keohane said.
Seven minutes later, the Gaels'
star scorer, Desi Engle, scored her
team's second goal. It was the 13th
goal of the season for Engle, setting a
new Gael record.
The remainder of the game con
sisted of absolute domination by St.
Mary's. The Gaels ended up taking
twice as many shots as the Cardinal,
