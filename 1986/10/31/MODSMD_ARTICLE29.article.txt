# Volleyball meets Ducks, Beavers
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Tonight and tomorrow night at
Maples Pavilion the Stanford women's
volleyball team will take on Oregon
State and then Oregon looking to
firmly establish itself as a Pacific 10
Conference leader and looking for
revenge.
Wins for the No. 9 Cardinal this
weekend would not only put them
well out in front with UCLA in the Pac

10, but show the Oregon teams that
this Stanford squad is much stronger
than the one that visited the two
schools in late September.
That weekend, the Cardinal spikers
pulled out a five-game win against
OSU, then lost in five games — after
winning the first two — to the Ducks.
Stanford's loss to Oregon is the only
blemish on its conference record. The
spikers are 12-7 overall.
The more significant of the two con
ference match ups is Saturday night's

with Oregon. Stanford is second in the
standings — UCLA is in first only be
cause it has played more games — and
the Ducks are tied for third. Play will
start earlier than usual, at 5 p.m., about
the time the football game will prob
ably be letting out, which Stanford
Coach Don Shaw said he hopes will
mean a big, noisy crowd.
No. 15 Oregon, 16-8 overall and 8-3
in the conference, is led by two very
heavy hitters, Terri Kramer and Mi
chelle Krebsbach. Kramer has 507 kills

so far this season, producing a kills
average that puts her second in the na
tion. Krebsbach's 467 kills give her
fourth place on the country's leader
board. By comparison, the Cardinal
leader, Theresa Smith, has 286 kills.
Despite the presence of these two
dominating Ducks, Shaw said his
players performed better offensively
than Oregon when the two met earlier
this fall. "Statistically, we outhit them in
the match, our percentage was better,"
Shaw said.
Shaw said that Stanford has a differ
ent lineup now from the one that
played up north and that his team is
now "much better." He pointed to a
few Cardinal errors as the difference
between the team having an unde
feated Pac-10 record and the 8-1
record it actually has. "Hopefully we've
eliminated those errors."
This evening at 7:30, the spikers will
play their third straight defense
oriented team. The Beavers are un
ranked with a 5-17 record overall and
are at the bottom of the conference at
1-10.
Shaw said he is glad the games will
be at home, but that does not always
guarantee home-court advantage.
"That's going to help. It's always nice to
play at home," he said. " Of course,
there's got to be a crowd."
"The OSU match is Halloween night,
but I would hope that people come
anyway," he continued. "They can
wear their costumes to the game, that's
fine with me."
