# Volleyball meets Ducks, Beavers

Tonight and tomorrow night at
Maples Pavilion the Stanford women's
volleyball team will take on Oregon
State and then Oregon looking to
firmly establish itself as a Pacific 10
Conference leader and looking for
revenge.
Wins for the No. 9 Cardinal this
weekend would not only put them
well out in front with UCLA in the Pac

fourth place on the country's leader
board. By comparison, the Cardinal
leader, Theresa Smith, has 286 kills.
Despite the presence of these two
dominating Ducks, Shaw said his
players performed better offensively

this fall. "Statistically, we outhit them in
