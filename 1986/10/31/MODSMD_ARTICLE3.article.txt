# Robinson says revamp Rush

### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
Although fraternities need to "start from
ground zero" in re-evaluating Rush, they need
not eliminate alcohol, the associate dean of
Student Affairs told the Interfraternity Council
last night.
Assoc. Dean Norm Robinson attended the
IFC meeting to discuss what he called the
"number-one issue": fraternity rush.
"All this talk about dry Rush is perhaps
going about it the wrong way," Robinson told
18 fraternity members. "We've been talking
about eliminating alcohol but not about
changing anything else. Really what we want
to do about Rush is to start from ground
zero."
Robinson encouraged fraternities to dis
cuss the information needed by both parties
in the Rush process and to plan various activi
ties that would allow fraternities and rushees
to make informed decisions.
"Alcohol might be included in the program
at some point, but at least it would be done
thoughtfully, rather than as just a three-week
series of parties," Robinson said.
IFC President Steve Singleton said a com
mittee will be formed at the IFC's next

meeting, Nov. 13, to discuss recommending
changes in Rush.
Phi Delta Theta member Vinnie Frost said
he was happy to hear Robinson sound
flexible, but that "that doesn't seem to be
what we've been hearing from the administra
tion."
"The message I seem to be getting from the
administration is that Stanford is behind the
whole world in alcohol policy, that alcohol is
bad, and that it should be totally eliminated
from the Rush process," Frost said.
Robinson admitted that "the climate is
growing a lot less tolerant than it was last
spring," but encouraged the IFC to propose
its own Rush policy.
"(Fraternal Affairs Adviser) Joe Pisano and I
are very eager to help you figure out how it's
supposed to be, but it would be a complete
disaster if we tried to tell you how it should
be," he said.
Robinson said he believes the University
would eagerly support any new approach to
Rush developed by the IFC.
In discussing the support of the University,
Frost said, "It would be nice to feel now and
then like somebody is on our side."
"I guess I'm just not sure what the image of
a fraternity is in the University. Do administra

tors take any of our good qualities into con
sideration?" he asked.
According to Singleton, the planned IFC
committee will look at responses to a pledge
survey distributed at an Oct. 21 meeting be
tween Pisano, pledges and pledge trainers.
"We need to get started as early as possible
looking at Rush," Singleton said.
Approximately 175 pledges responded to
the survey, which has so far been reviewed
only by the IFC executive committee,
Singleton said. Results of the survey showed
that very few pledges favored any changes in
the Rush process and that very few people
used the IFC's Rush book, Singleton said. The
most frequently voiced concern was that Rush
lasted too long, he added.
Robinson said he believes that more Stan
ford students join fraternities as a place to live
than to be part of that particular fraternity.
"I think here it is more often a sort of last
resort choice," Robinson said, "simply be
cause it might be better than living off campus
or wherever they drew into."
Senior John Paff said that if Robinson
believes that, "then that really does tell us
something about the administration's view of

the fraternal system."
Junior Mario Queiroz, a meml">er of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, said
many SAEs have lived in overcrowded
conditions for a year or longer.
"They may have gcxxl Draw num
bers but they choose to live over
crowded for a year or so just to be in
the fraternity," Queiroz said.
Kappa Alpha fraternity member
Bryan Francis also pointed out that
Robiason's statement does not account
for the growing interest in Stanford's
unhoused fraternities.
