# Tennis players go south, McEnroe wins opener

### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
In a tournament that will determine the top-ranked player
going into the 1987 NCAA men's tennis season, Stanford's
Patrick McEnroe defeated Olivier Lorin of Oklahoma, 6-4, 6-
4, and advanced to the second round of the Volvo Tennis/
All-American Championships in Los Angeles.
"I thought Fat played a very good first set," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "The quality of play in the second
set, though it was the same score, was substantially lower.
(But) it was a good solid effort for the first time out."
"It's possible that he'll play two rounds of singles tomor
row (today)," Gould said. "Tomorrow is a really big day in
terms of matches."
It might have been three matches today for the seventh
seeded McEnroe, but he and doubles partner Scott Moody
fell to Ball State's Todd Hershey and Eric Nixon, 6-3, 7-5.
With practice having begun a mere three weeks ago,
Gould decided to send only four players down to represent
Stanford at the tournament, being held at the Los Angeles
Tennis Center at LJCLA.
The other two participants, both freshmen, went south
largely because they are Los Angeles residents. Jonathan

Kahn, who needed to win four matches in order to advance
to the qualifying round, defeated two opponents before
losing to Houston's John Thellmark, 7-5, 6-2. Jeff Tarangle
beat South Carolina's Ken Diller in the qualifying round, 6-
4, 6-2, before bowing out to TCU's Neal Broad, 6-3, 6-4.
Moody lost in the qualifying round to Dan Leaycroft of
Louisiana State, 6-4, 6-3-
Singles top-seed Richie Reneberg of SMU advanced to the
second round yesterday, defeating Weber State's Jonas
Ehrlin, 6-1, 7-6, while second seed Luke Jensen of USC
ousted New Mexico's Jack Griffin, 6-7 (8-10), 6-4, 6-3.
In doubles, top-seeded All-Americans Charles Beckman
and Royce Deppe of Texas defeated Georgia Tech's Brian
Shelton and Rick Gilbert, 7-5,4-6, 6-3.
The tournament runs through Sunday, with 12 returning
All-Americans participating. However, it may not be an accu
rate gauge of how the four Cardinal players will fare this
year, Gould cautioned, because many have been practicing
since August rather than since the beginning of this month.
"You want to do as well as you can," Gould said, "but
we're not near tournament tough. We debated sending
anyone down.... It was a purely optional tournament for
anyone on the team.
