# Kennedy moves up to Greek
## 
### 
We got the big guy. After inviting
various Stanford coaches and alumni
to try their skill at picking our 10
featured games of the week University
President Donald Kennedy is this
week's Greek of the Week.
Kennedy follows Jill Lieber, '78, who
went 7-3 for the Guest Greek's best
outing to date. The guest now stands at
22-18 overall.
Kennedy picked Stanford to pull out
a 31-24 victory over Washington State
tomorrow. "I like the Stanford of
fense," he said in explaining the high
point total. "I think the special teams
will score, either by blocking a kick or
running one back, and I think the
defense will score."
In other games, Kennedy picked Cal
ifornia over Oregon ("An upset possi
bility") and USC over Arizona ("I've
got a lot of doubt about that one").
Kennedy also volunteered a pick on
his old alma mater, a certain small
liberal arts school outside of Boston
that prides itself on being the Stanford
of the East: Brown 17, Harvard 0.
"Harvard can't score," he stated.
