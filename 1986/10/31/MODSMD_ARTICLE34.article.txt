The United States' objectives in the Middle East are
stability, free trade and the limitation of Soviet influence,
according to Mary Ann Casey, a career diplomat who was
recently the U.S. State Department's deputy director for
Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
Casey, a scholar in residence at the Hoover Institution,
spoke yesterday on "The Elusive Quest for Peace in the
Middle East" at the Bechtel International Center.
The United States believes peaceful political negotia
tion by regional leaders is the only way to resolve the
region's many tensions, according to Casey. The U.S. is
doing all it can by encouraging this process, she said.
The Arab-Israeli conflict, the Iran-Iraq war, the
Saharan war, constant bloodshed in Lebanon, terrorism
and many border tensions are among the conflicts in the
region related to U.S. self-interest, she said.
According to Casey, the United States has taken a

neutral stand on the Iran-Iraq war and has supported the
United Nations' calls for a cease-fire. In Lebanon, the
United States has also promoted cease-fires and lent sup
port to the United Nations, she said.
Terrorism is an amorphous but real problem, Casey
said, adding that the U.S. government will continue to
fight against state-sponsored terrorism. She cited Libya as
an example.
Casey spoke for 15 minutes and then took questions
from the audience. Several people said they believed
that U.S. foreign policy is aimed at destabilizing the
Middle East and that the State Department's words do
not match its deeds.
"It's only because most Americans don't know (the
history of U.S. involvement in the Middle East) that you
can get up there and say these things and not have
people laugh in your face," one audience member said
after listing incidents such as the 1958 U.S. invasion of
Lebanon.
