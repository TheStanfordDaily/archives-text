# Scholars meet to celebrate Jewish Studies
## 
### JOYA WESLEY 
New faculty members and visiting scholars from the
United Suites and Europe are eating brown-bag lunches at
Stanford this week.
Die lunches and ensuing discussions about Jewish issues
are in celebration of Stanford's new program in Jewish
studies. The program, the arrival of two new professors and
a newly acquired library collection will make Stanford one
of America's leading centers for Jewish studies.
The University expects to lure more professors with the
help of the Bay Area's Jewish community, according to Uni
versity News Service. The University's intention is to
produce a graduate program in Jewish studies and eventu
ally an undergraduate major, the News Service said.
"I was promised a concerted effort to obtain two chairs in
Jewish studies," Israeli-bom Amos Funkenstein, who was
appointed a professor in the History Department, told the
News Service. Funkenstein is an internationally known
scholar on both Jewish studies and the history of science.
The acquisition of the Taube-Baron library was critical in
the program's establishment. According to Arnold Eisen,
who was appointed an associate professor in religious
studies, it will serve as a basis for scholarly research.
Neither Eisen nor Funkenstein, however, wish to estab
lish a separate Jewish studies department A single depart
ment could not encompass all the disciplines relating to
Jewish studies, the professors said.
Eisen's position as the first Aaron-Roland fellow is the cur
rent evolution of the first funding for the program. In the
early 19705, Miriam Roland, widow of Dr. Samuel Roland,
gave the University unrestricted funds to begin a program in
Jewish studies.
The money was initially used to set up a visiting profes
sorship, but was changed last year with Mrs. Roland's con
sent when the University wanted to hire Eisen as a funded
fellow.
Outside funding also helped found two other programs
that focus on minority issues, the Program on African and
Afro-American Studies (AAAS) and the Institute for Research
on Women and Gender.
AAAS began with an initial grant from the Ford Founda
tion. The Institute for Research on Women and Gender —
formerly the Center for Research on Women (CROW) —
received a pilot grant from the University and later a Ford
Foundation grant with which it hired Deputy Director
Marilyn Yalom, who is also involved with the Jewish Studies
Program.
In response to the current debate over whether Stanford
should demonstrate more of a commitment to the study of

minority issues, Yalom agreed with the administration that
these programs should begin with student and faculty inter
est and move upward.
"It's the faculty and the students that are at the cutting
edge of knowledge," she said. She went on to say that the
University was "lucky to have such a responsive administra
tion."
The gender institute was formed by a group of graduate
students and faculty that got together in an informal setting
to discuss in 1974 "research that was not being adequately
covered in the individual departments," she said.
Yalom also stressed the current convergence of Jewish
and Feminist studies at Stanford. She moderated a panel
on "Women, Judaism and Jewish Studies' last Friday as part
of the inauguration of the Jewish Studies Program. Yalom
cited poet Adrienne Rich, a member of that panel and a visit
ing professor of English with concentrations in feminist and
Jewish studies, as a "symbol of the convergence of these two
issues."
AAAS, which was also formed as a result of faculty and stu
dent interest in 1969, has experienced a different sort of
response from the University administration, according to
Chairman Kennell Jackson.
"African and Afro-American studies has been exposed to
intense scrutiny for longer than one would expect because
of its political origins of the 19605," he said.
