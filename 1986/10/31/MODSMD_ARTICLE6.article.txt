# Zschau denies signing letter
## Gives speech at Branner 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Republican Senate candidate Ed Zschau, speaking at Bran
ner Hall yesterday, denied writing or signing a June 3,1985,
letter that opposes aid to forces seeking to overthrow the
Nicaraguan government.
The letter, typed on Zschau's congressional stationery,
states that he appreciates "knowing of your support for my
votes against military aid to the contras in Nicaragua, and I
assure you that shall remain my position."
"I didn't write that letter. The staff wrote the letter," he
said, suggesting that an intern might have written it.
The letter was addressed to a Saratoga woman and dated
June 3, 1985 â€” nine days before Zschau supported a $27
million aid package to the contras. Prior to that vote, Zschau
had voted against giving aid to the rebel forces.
Zschau said yesterday that he still favors U.S. aid for the
contras. "I believe that pressure ought to be put on the San
dinista regime," he said, citing what he called increasing
repression of the Catholic church and Nicargua's citizens.
With four campaign days remaining, statewide polls indi
cate that Zschau and Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston are run
ning neck and neck. Zschau (R-Los Altos) now represents
California's 12th Congressional District, which includes
Stanford and the Silicon Valley.
His replies to the controversial letter followed a speech to
about 200 people in Branner Hall. Copies of the letter were
distributed to audience members.
In the speech, Zschau stressed his differences with
Cranston on economic and military issues and criticized his
opponent for not agreeing to a series of televised debates.
Zschau labeled the mounting federal deficit "the most cri
tical domestic issue we face" and said he supports an
amendment to balance the federal budget, a move Cranston
opposes.
He also said the budget can be reduced without tax in
creases. "We've got to balance the federal budget through
spending cuts," he said.
Zschau, a second-term congressman, also emphasized his
"strong belief in die free enterprise system," which he said
must stimulate economic growth in the United States. The
government's role is "not to create jobs itself, but rather to
create an environment" conducive to free enterprise, he
said.
Regarding defense, Zschau said he believes in dialogue
and peace through strength.
"You don't achieve a negotiating success with an adver
sary if you give unilaterally what he wants without getting
anything in return," he said. "An appeal to our adversaries
based on dialogue and strength is the way to achieve
peace."
Zschau blasted Cranston for not agreeing to debate what
he called the candidates' "sharply contrasting visions of the
future."
"The League of Women Voters offered to sponsor three
debates,... but he refused," Zschau said.
"When I'm running for re-election to the U.S. Senate, I'll
debate my opponent, I'll have dialogue. That's the way
democracy is supposed to work," he said.
During his speech, Zschau was heckled by several mem
bers of the sign-toting crowd. Among the anti-Zschau signs
were ones stating, "Ed Zschau Supports Contra Terrorism"
and "End U.S. Intervention in Central America." A number
of Zschau supporters held signs stating "Zschau Now."
Cranston was supposed to speak at the University last
week, but he was forced to cancel the engagement when the
Senate adjourned later than expected.
