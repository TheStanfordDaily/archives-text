# Spirit of Stanford in crypt

An aged oak tree spreads its guardian
arms
Above a quiet glade where shadows
play
In strange fantastic figures, on a gray
Unpolished crypt No sound alarms
The shades that softly flit around this
tomb
Of greatness gone in life but near in
death ..
With this poem, Morgan Walters, a
1933 Stanford graduate, evoked the
mystical and ghostly qualities of the
Stanford family mausoleum.
Tonight the senior class will evoke
those same mystical qualities, perhaps
a little more light-heartedly, with its an
nual Mausoleum Halloween Party.
Rut the ritual tombside revelry
might be a little more reverent if par
tygoers only knew of some of the
ghosts and tales surrounding the crypt
of Leland Stanford, his wife, Jane, and
his son, Leland, Jr.
According to records in the University Archives,
the current site of the mausoleum, located off Lomita
Drive near the Stanford Museum, was originally pro
posed as a location for the Stanford family's new Palo
Alto country home.
However, when Leland Jr. died unexpectedly in
1884, consideration of the new home was lost amid
plans for the construction of a new university in the
boy's honor, and it was decided to build a family
mausoleum on the site instead.
Designed by the architectural firm of Caterson and
Clark, the mausoleum cost $164,000 and was com
pleted in 1889, five years after the death of young
Leland. Mrs. Stanford, though, elected to leave the
boy's body in the temporary mausoleum that had
been erected among the trees near the family's
home.
When Leland Sr. died four years later in 1893, his
body was interred in the as-yet empty crypt, and his
son's casket was transferred to the new mausoleum
shortly thereafter.
Mrs. Stanford visited the tomb with a companion
almost every day until her death in 1905.
"There used to be chairs inside the crypt that Mrs.
Stanford made herself for sitting and meditating,''
said a Stanford historian who asked not to be identi
fied. The chairs were later removed to Memorial
Church.
More than 6,000 people attended Jane Stanford's
funeral in 1905. The congregation overflowed from
the church into the Inner Quad and formed a proces

sional four abreast down Palm Drive to the
mausoleum, where Mrs. Stanford was laid to rest
beside her husband and son.
According to a 1905 issue of The Daily Palo Alto
(now The Stanford Daily), the senior class wanted to
honor Mrs. Stanford by starting a tradition of flower
giving at the mausoleum.
"In no way could the affection and esteem of the

UCLA game, the doors to

students for the mother of the University be better
shown than by the simple tribute of placing flowers
daily at her tomb," the newspaper said.
Commenting on the tradition, a 1905 Stanford
alum wrote that "to the tomb of an empress no more
bountiful or beautiful flowers were ever brought."
But along with this lovely tradition, some
gruesome events also took place at the mausoleum.
According to an 1894 issue of The Daily Palo Alto, a
watchman died that year in the guard house that

overlooked the mausoleum site.
"Sentinel house in which watchman died moved
to campus, successor to new guard is superstitious,"
read The Daily in the wake of the event.
There are also persistent rumors about suspicious
persons lurking around the mausoleum. Judy Adams,
a librarian at the University Archives, remembered a
day when she wanted to have a picnic on the lawn in
front of the mausoleum. A friend, however, warned
her that there was talk about "a man who jumped
from the bushes near the mausoleum with a knife,"
Adams said.
More recendy, after the 1979 Stanford-UCLA game,
a padlock and two sets of the mausoleum's door
locks were picked and the doors to the crypt were
found open.
The four sphinxes built to guard the mausoleum at
each of its corners add to the mysterious aura of the
crypt. According to University Archive records, two
Greek sphinxes with women's heads were first
placed in the front of the mausoleum, but the artistic
effect was not pleasing. After Lei and Sr.'s death, Egyp
tian sphinxes with male faces were placed in the
front and the female sculptures were removed to the
back.
Lisa MacLaren, a member of the Senior Class Core
that sponsors the mausoleum party, said she didn't
believe that these spooky statues, strange occur
rences or the death of the mausoleum's watchman
would frighten students away from tonight's party.
"It's gonna be a huge campus party ... and they're
going to be checking student IDs," she said.
