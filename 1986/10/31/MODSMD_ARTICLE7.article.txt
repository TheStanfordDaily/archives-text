# Spirit of Stanford in crypt
## 
### KATHY LACHENAUER 
An aged oak tree spreads its guardian
arms
Above a quiet glade where shadows
play
In strange fantastic figures, on a gray
Unpolished crypt No sound alarms
The shades that softly flit around this
tomb
Of greatness gone in life but near in
death ..
With this poem, Morgan Walters, a
1933 Stanford graduate, evoked the
mystical and ghostly qualities of the
Stanford family mausoleum.
Tonight the senior class will evoke
those same mystical qualities, perhaps
a little more light-heartedly, with its an
nual Mausoleum Halloween Party.
Rut the ritual tombside revelry
might be a little more reverent if par
tygoers only knew of some of the
ghosts and tales surrounding the crypt
of Leland Stanford, his wife, Jane, and
his son, Leland, Jr.
