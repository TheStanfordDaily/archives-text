U.S. will sell jets to Honduras
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration has decided to offer F-5 jet
fighters to Honduras, an action that would introduce the first advanced
warplanes to Central America, U.S. officials said yesterday.
The move, an escalation in Central America's arms race, is designed to
maintain Honduran air superiority in the face of a steady buildup in the
armed forces of leftist-ruled Nicaragua, Honduras' neighbor to the south.
But it is also aimed at outflanking an attempt by Israel to sell its Kfir com
bat fighter to Honduras instead of the U.S. plane, which is manufactured by
Northrop Corp. of Los Angeles.
Honduras has one of the smallest armies in Central America and has
long relied on its air force, generally coasidered the best in the region, for
defense.
But the air force's core, a single squadron of 14 French-made Super-
Mystere fighters, dates from the 19505, and the Hondurans have long been
asking the United States for new planes. Until recently, however, the ad
ministration had delayed such a move, arguing that the Hondurans did not
yet need advanced fighters and, in any event, could not afford them.
U.S. officials said no final decision has been made on how many F-5s
Honduras should buy, but said 18 to 24 were under consideration.
Pope condemns homosexuality
VATICAN CITY — The Vatican issued a new condemnation of
homosexual activity yesterday in a move that many church scholars and
theologians here linked to Pope John Paul ll's continuing campaign to rein
in liberal interpretations of church teachings in the United States and West
ern Europe.
The new Vatican stand on homosexuality was released by its watchdog
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in the form of a letter to the
church's bishops. It lays down rigid new rules for how priests around the
world should deal with homosexuals and those who seek to defend their
rights — often, the Vatican document charged, by espousing "deceitful
propaganda" and by "misleading" well-meaning pastors.
Church scholars here said the document's warnings to bishops and
priests against gay groups attempting to "mislead" pastors or seeking to be
integrated into pastoral programs without acknowledging the wrongness
of homosexuality were aimed at the United States and Western Europe,
since very few such groups have sought acceptance in the church else
where.
The church document, titled "Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic
Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons," said the church's po
sition had not changed since its last pronouncement on homosexuality in
1975. The Vatican, it said, views homosexual practices as a sin and even a
tendency toward homosexuality as an "objective disorder."
Proof of this, the Vatican document argued, was to be found in the
Bible's Book of Genesis, which describes sex as a union of man, woman
and God for the sake of procreation, and in the words of St. Paul, who lists
homosexuals among those who cannot enter the Kingdom of God.
Meese studies Waldheim report
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin Meese said yesterday that he
will study a new report of Kurt Waldheim's involvement in a brutal Nazi
"pacification" program in Yugoslavia in 1942 before deciding whether the
Austrian president should be barred from visiting the United States.
After denying for months that he had anything to do with the Nazi activi
ties that resulted in the massacre of Yugoslav civilians in a mountainous
area called Kozara, Waldheim has acknowledged that he did take part in
the World War II operation, but only as a "supply officer," according to a
report in yesterday's Washington Post. Sources said late yesterday that in
August Waldheim's attorneys gave the U.S. Justice Department the same in
formation in a written submission.
Meese has been considering for more than six months whether to place
Waldheim on a "watch list" of persons to be denied entry to this country
because of his alleged Nazi activities.
Asked yesterday about the Post story, Meese told reporters: "These
would be additional facts that would be taken into consideration in our
review of the whole matter— There's been no hurry and no need for
hurry because there's no prospect of him coming to this country in the
near future, and we felt it's important to look at all the facts."
Near air collision in Los Angeles
LOS ANGELES — A United Airlines jetliner descending toward Los An
geles International Airport with 94 people aboard came within 200 feet of a
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration helicopter in what the United pilot
described as a "near-miss," officials said yesterday.
The Federal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety
Board and DEA have launched their own investigations of the incident,
which occurred at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday, about 50 miles east of the airport.
No one was injured in the incident. The Boeing 727-200 jetliner —
United's Flight 282 out of Monterey, Calif., with 87 passengers and seven
crew members aboard — made a normal landing and arrived at the
airline's terminal area seven minutes later. The pilot then filed a "near
miss" report with the FAA, according to United officials.
DEA Special Agent Dwight McKinney confirmed yesterday that the
helicopter involved in Wednesday's incident was being used by the agency.
He declined further comment, saying that the DEA's air wing in Addison,
Texas, was investigating.
Soviets press for arms accord
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union wants to take advantage of an interna
tional conference in Vienna next week to make progress on an arms
control accord with the United States, a government spokesman said yes
terday.
U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnaze are expected to continue in Vienna the nuclear disarmament
talks that were broken off at the summit conference in Iceland. Gennadi
Gerasimov, a spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, told reporters:
"We don't come to this meeting with empty hands."
The Vienna conference, which is to open Nov. 4, has been called to
review compliance with the 1975 Helsinki accords on security and
cooperation, but Gerasimov said, "I think we should be interested in the
main point — the fate of nuclear disarmament."
The Shevardnaze-Shultz talks will come on the heels of three weeks of
sometimes bitter recrimination over whether President Reagan or Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev is to blame for the failure to reach an accord
Oa. 11-12 in Reykjavik, the Iceland capital.
Minister calls oil price meeting
WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia's new acting oil minister, Hisham Nazer,
called yesterday for an emergency meeting of oil-producing nations to dis
cuss raising the price of oil by $5 a barrel, a move that would tighten world
wide supplies and drive up prices at the gas pump.
The announcement, less than 24 hours after Saudi King Fahd removed
longtime oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani, increased uncertainty in inter
national oil markets and sent prices surging.
Nazer made the request to the secretary general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. The official Saudi Press Agency said he
sought a meeting of the cartel's pricing committee in a matter of days to
began work on a formula among the 13 member countries "to raise the
price to at least $18 a barrel "
In New York, the price of one type of West Texas crude oil jumped $1.31
to $15.04 World oil prices range from $13 to $14 a barrel, compared to $30
a vear ago.
