# Bird issue hurts Democrats
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO — Early in this vital
year for California Democrats, the Rose
Bird problem seemed to he under
control. Although the liberal Democrat
was predicted to lose her bid for
reconfirmation as the state's Supreme
Court chief justice, the polls indicated
that anti-Bird sentiment would not be a
factor for other candidates.
But after several months of political
warfare over Bird — perhaps the first
time that several campaigns in a state
have been forced to reckon with a
single judge — it appears that the
Democrats' early optimism may have
been misplaced.
In almost every race, the chief
justice's anti-death penalty record in a
pro-death penalty state has had an im
pact. Polls show Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian enjoying a healthy
lead over Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley and Republican Senate candi
date Ed Zschau taking some votes away
from front-running Democratic Sen.
Alan Cranston, in part because of the
candidates' views on Bird and her 62
consecutive votes to overturn death
sentences.
Now, two other Democratic appoin
tees to the Supreme Court who once
seemed insulated from the attacks on
Bird have fallen behind for the first
time in an independent statewide poll.

According to a survey of 1,200 voters
by Teichner and Associates Oct. 23-25,
Justice Cruz Reynoso is failing 26 per
cent to 20 percent in his reconfirma
tion bid, and Justice Joseph Grodin is
failing 24 percent to 21 percent. Sep
tember polls by Mervin Field showed
both with a plurality of support.
Reynoso has voted against the death
penalty in 46 of the 47 capital cases he
has considered, Grodin 35 of 42.
Although the Teichner survey shows

most voters undecided or uninformed
on Reynoso and Grodin, the results
raise the possibility that Deukmejian,
leading Bradley by 13 points in the
same poll, could appoint three new
justices if he wins a second term and
give the seven-member court a solid
pro-death penalty majority.
Despite several statewide votes
legalizing capital punishment, resis
tance from Bird and other justices has
left the state gas chamber unused since
1967. The Teichner survey shows senti
ment running almost 2-to-l against
Bird, while three other justices who
have shown more support for capital
punishment have more yes than no
votes.
Sandra Conlan, spokeswoman for
Zschau, said their overnight polling
shows "the figures react" whenever
Zschau runs another television com
mercial emphasizing his support for
the death penalty and his opposition to
Bird. A Los Angeles Times Poll in mid-
October reported that voters favoring
Zschau and those favoring Deukmejian
said the candidates' stand against Bird
was important in their decision.
Now, Conlan said, Zschau's polls
show him leading the race, a conten
tion contradicted by all the public in
dependent polls and one private Re
publican poll for another candidate.

The Times Foil showed Cranston 7
percentage points ahead, The most
recent Teichner poll reported that
Cranston had widened his lead from 7
to 11 percentage points.
Cranston must weather last-minute
campaigning for Zschau by President
Reagan and a well-funded GOP phone
bank and absentee-ballot drive. Each
candidate has spent more than $8 mil
lion, making this the most expensive
1986 race in the country, and, for the
first time in his senate career, Cranston
has less money than his opponent. A
survey by the San Jose Mercury News
showed that defense, electronics and
agriculture companies that once con
tributed to Cranston have left him for
Zschau.
Deukmejian's advisers are confident,
although they do their best to hide it.
A Bradley spokesman, John Stodder,
characterized the latest polls as
"screwy."
Bradley, like Cranston, has declined
to take a stand on Bird. But to the
delight of California Republicans, one
small-town politician has committed
himself.
Actor Clint Eastwood, mayor of
Carmel-by-the-Sea, has donated
130,000 to the anti-Bird Crime Victims
for Court Reform.
