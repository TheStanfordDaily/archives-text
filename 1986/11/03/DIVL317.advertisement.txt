architecture and optics. Among others.
To the Computer Scientist, we deliver op
portunities across the frontier of finite state
machine development. The applications realm:
systems design and programs, applications and
evaluation, and computer security research and
design.
Mathematicians research a variety of mathe
matical concepts including probability theory,
statistics, Galois theory and group theory.
Language Specialists in Slavic, Near Eastern
and Asian languages meet the challenges of
translation, transcription and analysis head
on. Every day.
Whatever your field, you can be certain to
