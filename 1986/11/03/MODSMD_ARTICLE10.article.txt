# U.S. hostage freed in Beirut

BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” American hostage David
Jacobsen was released here yesterday after 17
months in captivity, amid indications that the Islamic
Jihad terrorist organization may be ready to free the
other two Americans it is holding.
In releasing Jacobsen, the Islamic Jihad called on
the United States to take unspecified moves that it
said could lead "to a solution of the hostage prob
lem," and Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, who
met with Jacobsen here today, said he hoped for the
release of more hostages soon.
Jacobsen, who was administrator of the hospital at
the American University of Beirut, was reported to be
in good health at the U.S. Embassy in suburban East
Beirut. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
Jacobsen would be flown to the U.S. military hospital
in Wiesbaden, West Germany, for a medical examina
tion.
The release of Jacobsen, who was abducted from a
street in Moslem West Beirut on May 28,1985, left six
Americans captive or unaccounted for in Lebanon,
two of them known to be in the hands of Islamic
Jihad, which had released two other American
captives earlier.
"I hope with support of our friends we should be
able to see the release of remaining hostages, U.S.
hostages and others, in the next days," said Waite, a
lay representative of Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie. Waite, who has frequently acted as an
intermediary on the issue of the Western hostages,
had surfaced here Friday but gave no details of his ac
tivities.
Last night he told a foreign news agency here by
telephone that he hoped more hostages will be
released in the next days.
"I have been with Jacobsen for several hours,"
Waite said in a brief and hurried conversation. "He is
very much looking forward to (reuniting) with his
family."

Security guards at the site of a vacant, former U.S.
Embassy building in West Beirut said Jacobsen
arrived there on foot about 7 a.m., after wallting from
a seafront hotel where his captors had dropped him
off.
Jacobsen ate an apple and drank two cups of coffee
while awaiting arrival of a heavily armed U.S.
motorcade that took him across the Green Line sepa
rating the Moslem and Christian sections of the capi
tal to the new American diplomatic mission in East
Beirut, one guard said. Embassy officials there
refused to discuss his whereabouts.
The pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or holy war, organi
zation, in a message delivered to an international
news agency yesterday afternoon and addressed to
"world public opinion, the American people and the
families of the hostages," warned:
"We hold the American government fully respon
sible for the consequences of any failure to take ad
vantage of this opportunity and proceed with current
approaches that could lead, if continued, to a solu
tion of the hostages' issue.
"We alert the American government, the families
of the hostages and the American people that we
shall take a totally different attitude in case the Ameri
can government fails to complete these approaches
to arrive at the hoped-for results," Islamic Jihad cau
tioned.
This was the first indication by the clandestine
group that it considers that some kind of bargaining
is underway between it and Washington.
Saturday, Lebanese Justice Minister Nabih Berri,
who also heads the Shiite Moslem Amal movement,
told French television that "contacts related to the
fate of hostages detained in Lebanon" were
"currently underway between the United States and
Kuwait."
Islamic Jihad, believed to be an umbrella cover or
ganization of Middle East intelligence services and

Tehran-linked Shiite fundamentalists, offered last
year and again this summer to swap American and
French captives it holds for Lebanese and Iraqi Shiite
activists jailed in Kuwait after being convicted of
taking part in a series of bombings there in 1983.
The moves that cleared the way for yesterday's
release were not clear, but the sudden breakthrough
after months of stagnation with the arrival of Waite in
Beirut two days ago signaled that negotiators had
adopted a new approach.
Syria's role in the recent developments has
remained ambiguous. Despite heavy hints to Syria by
Western governments that the time was right for it to
use its influence with extremist groups in Lebanon to
secure a hostage release, there has been no evidence
that it has done so.
When the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, the director here
of Catholic Relief Services, was freed last July 27 after
18 months of captivity, he surfaced in a Syrian
controlled area in central Lebanon and was then
taken to Damascus and released. Jacobsen's hushed
up removal to East Beirut left Syria deprived of the
acclaim and press attention it has received at the con
clusion of previous hostage dramas in Lebanon.
Diplomatic sources in Damascus told Reuters that
Syria had no direct role in Jacobsen's release but was
advised of developments. "Washington has used
Waite only to deprive Syria of its reputation as a
peace broker," one Damascus source said.
At least two more Americans are still held by Is
lamic Jihad: Terry Anderson, the bureau chief here
for The Associated Press, who was kidnaped in March
1985, and Thomas Sutherland, dean of the school of
agricultural engineering at the American University
of Beirut, held since June 1985. Islamic Jihad said a
year ago that it had killed U.S. diplomat William
Buckley, but his body has never been found.
