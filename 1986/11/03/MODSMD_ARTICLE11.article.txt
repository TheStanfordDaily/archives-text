# Poor postal service has dorm residents growling

### MONICA SIMMS 
Mail carriers on Stanford's sunny campus can
blame neither snow nor rain nor gloom of night,
but office coordinators in several campus dormi
tories complain that the day's mail is arriving late
and sometimes not at all.
In addition, Maria Meyer, office coordinator of
Crothers and Crothers Memorial halls, said carri
ers have not been putting notices in students'
boxes when large packages arrive, and that at
times bundles of mail are left at her office, leaving
the job of sorting and distributing the mail to her
and the resident advisers.
She said there have been similar delivery prob
lems at other dorms.
"A lot of residential managers get behind on
their work, spending as much as an hour and a
half a day sorting mail," she added.
According to Federal Law 91-275: "It is the re
sponsibility of the Postal Service to maintain an
efficient system of collection, sorting, and
delivery of mail nationwide."
Jean Duffield, supervisor of Stanford Post Of
fice branch operations, said all carriers have been
delivering dormitory mail on a regular basis and
that carriers have been putting package notices in
students' boxes.
Meyer speculated that a carrier shortage may
account for part of the problem. She also said

Stanford carriers are relieved one day out of six
to make a five-day work week and suggested that
the substitutes may be unfamiliar with routes,
causing delays and occasional skipped deliveries.
Duffield denied that a staff shortage exists.
Ray Chung, a Palo Alto Post Office manager,
said substitute carriers sometimes create delivery
problems because of their unfamiliarity with
routes. "It happens," he said, "but I'm not saying
that this is the case here."
Laurie Silver, office coordinator of Florence
Moore Hall, said the mail is usually delivered very
late in the day and, on a few occasions, has not
arrived until the next morning.
"But we have an even more serious problem,"
Silver said. "We were promised post office boxes,
but about 20 to 25 percent of the students here
still don't have them. So the mail comes to my of
fice.
"I get two to three white boxes of mail every
day to sort through. There are seven houses here
at Flo Mo, so I sort through the mail by houses,
and then the students go through the bundles
themselves. I don't know if that's legal."
Duffield said 2,000 new mail boxes will be built
near the Stanford Post Office by January.
"It is my understanding that the University will
rent all of the boxes for use by students.
However, I don't know which of the dorms will
be allocated the boxes," Duffield said.
