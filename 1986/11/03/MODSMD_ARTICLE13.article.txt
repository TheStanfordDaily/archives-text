## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper The 						value in writing

"You may not like it now, but you will thank me later."
This idea has, through overuse and misuse, become a
cliche. If, however, one amends the statement to read,
"You are greatly mistaken if you don't like it now, and
you will still thank me later," then it describes the Faculty
Senate's recent proposal to discontinue AP score-based
exemptions from the freshman writing requirement.
The ability to write clearly and powerfully is crucial to
one's vocation and even one's everyday life. In recent
years, the world has become crowded with people wish
ing they had a firmer grasp on writing fundamentals.
Everything from legal contracts and business memos
to dinner party invitations and personalized license
plates has been made confused or incomprehensible by
poor writing. There is a definite need for students to
leave Stanford confident in their ability to communicate
in writing.
There are several problems inherent in the current
freshman writing exemption process, making it difficult
to achieve this goal. Most important is the very nature of
the Advanced Placement English test. The test primarily
assesses one's knowledge of literature, not writing abil
ity. Thus, it is possible for a student who is well-versed in
literature, but who lacks certain basic writing skills, to
earn an exemption from the writing requirement.
Another fallacy in the current exemption system is the
assumption that a student who already possesses writing
skills cannot benefit from the writing course. In fact,
freshman writing courses offer these students an invalua

ble opportunity to further their ability. And while stu
dents might find a similar opportunity in higher-level
courses, these more advanced courses do not focus spe
cifically on writing. Nor do they offer the advantage of
critiques from one's peers.
Freshman writing courses are not meant to be tedious
exercises in diagramming sentences or vocabulary tests.
Rather, they are often stimulating courses, combining
fundamentals with masterpieces in the English language.
Aside from being interesting, freshman writing
courses are small enough to support in-class discussions.
This class size is valuable and far too rare at Stanford.
Freshmen should not be allowed to squander this op
portunity for discussion merely because they have per
formed well on a standardized test of literature.
Finally, it is valuable to undergo the exercise of put
ting one's ideas into writing. The processes of thinking
and writing are closely linked. Writing helps form ideas
and can force the writer to look beyond generalities and
ill-defined concepts to find specifics. A writing require
ment ensures that students who pursue a narrow curric
ulum that excludes classes requiring papers do not leave
Stanford having given this exercise too little of their at
tention.
This insight into forming ideas, along with small
classes, interesting materials and a forum for criticism by
one's peers, makes the freshman writing program too
good a deal to let freshmen pass it up.
