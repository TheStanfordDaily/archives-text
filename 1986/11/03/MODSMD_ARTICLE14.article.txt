# History opposes Prop. 63
## 
### 
Bill Moyers, columnist and television commentator,
recently chided the government and the news media for
failing to take history into account when making decisions
and reporting events. Such is the case with Proposition 63, a
constitutional amendment that would require the Califor
nia legislature to enact laws to enhance the role of English.
That is, the history and present reality of the Spanish lan
guage in this state has been discredited, bypassed, ignored
and cavalierly discounted.

People forget that Kellyfornya is really California, San
Hosay is really San Jose, IjOss Angelees is really Los Angeles,
Valayho is really Vallejo and Valencha Street is really Valen
cia Street. Whether one likes it or not, the Spanish language
is indelibly etched into the geography, the history and the
reality of life in this state. Los Angeles is the second-largest
Spanish speaking city in the world. Nobody seems to grasp
that fact.
I wonder if Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of
Independence, would find this country so threatened that
the Constitution would need an amendment. Jefferson was
conversant, in six languages: Greek, Latin, French, Italian,
English and, of course, Spanish.
On August 19, 1785, he wrote to his nephew, Peter Carr,
"Our future connection with Spain renders Spanish the
most necessary of the modern languages, after French.
When you become a public man, you may have occasion for
it, and the circumstances of your possessing that language
may give you a preference over other candidates." At that
time, much of Latin America and the Southwest was under
Spanish control.
Sixty years later, on January 1,1845, John Augustus Sutter,
one of the first English-speaking settlers in California, wrote
a similar letter to a Frenchman named Victor Prudon: "A
ship is going to bring us printing material, and I intend to
have a newspaper published, half Spanish, half English.
Such progress is made throughout civilization, and here we
are so much behind."
But the document that is constantly brought up to defend
the rights of Spanish speakers in this country is the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo. Signed on February 2, 1848, this treaty
ended the war the United States waged against Mexico and
ceded half of its land to this country. The treaty was
supposed to guarantee the property, political and cultural
rights of those people that became U.S. citizens overnight.
While the treaty never mentions safeguarding the Spanish
language, it does mention culture. Culture is the pattern of

human behavior that includes thought, speech, action,
beliefs, social forms and material traits of a racial, religious
or social group. Needless to say, the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo was another one of the most violated documents
this government ever signed.
However, there were attempts to carry out the spirit of
the treaty in the beginning. One year later, in 1849, the first
constitution of California was signed. Few people know that
this was a bilingual document, in English and Spanish. Sec
tion 21, Article XI decreed that all future laws be enacted in
both English and Spanish. The first legislature even had an
official state translator.
For 30 years, California was a bilingual state. Then the
capital moved from Monterey to Sacramento, where the
powerful Yankee miners were concentrated. A new consti
tution was signed, in English only.
As the population of Anglo-Americans in California in
creased, the Spanish speakers became the "foreigners." As
early as March 12, 1851, the periodical with a Spanish title,
"Alta California" of San Francisco, was already calling the
Spanish speakers "the foreign population."
The Spanish language has never left. Sixteenth century-
Spanish is still found in many small isolated New Mexico
towns. Yet, it is a myth that Latin Americans do not learn En
glish when they come to this country. This has never been
proved. Many of them even know some English before com
ing here. One has only to recall last year's Mexico City
earthquake to realize how easy it was for U.S. television
reporters to find so many English-speaking Mexicans on the
streets. The same is true in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
Latin American immigrants know they need to learn En
glish for economic, social and political survival if they are to
fulfill their immigrant dreams. At the same time, Spanish has
survived and propagated in this country for many reasons:
historical continuity; proximity to the mother countries;
constant travel to and from this country; and now the in
numerable Spanish language radio and television stations
that cater to an estimated $284.5 million Latino market. The
Spanish language media is being financed by the free enter
prise system of U.S. corporations. Also, we cannot forget that
many new immigrants work in segregation, in field or res
taurant kitchens, then go home to live in isolated farm
camps or barrios. Under those circumstances, what use have
they for English?
Proposition 63 is divisive, unnecessary and dangerous. It
will eliminate many vital public information services for the
health; well-being and security of the non-English speaking
recent arrivals, students and patients. It will further alienate
many U.S. citizens of Latin descent, discourage children
from knowing two languages and harm bilingual education.
