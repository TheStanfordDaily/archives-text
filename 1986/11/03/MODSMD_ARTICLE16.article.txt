# Never try to beat the gods
## 
### 
In ancient Greece, there were a few brave warriors who
felt they could trifle with the gods: sneak a glance at Medusa,
resist the sweet sounds of the Sirens, etc. Occasionally they
won, but, more often than not, they were turned to stone,
ripped apart by the Minotaur or subjected to some other
equally undesirable fate. In modern day America, there are
a few brave consumers who feel they can respond to an ad
vertised promotional offer and still resist the high-pressure
sales tactics that follow. Occasionally they win, but they're
usually coerced, conned or cajoled into buying a year's
supply of Mary Kay cosmetics, subscribing to Soap Opera
Digest or giving their life's savings to Rev. Moon.

Our saga begins at the Half Moon Bay Pumpkin Festival
where my friend and I agreed that our first order of busi
ness was finding a bathroom. Half Moon Bay has neither the
road network nor the facilities to accomodate the crowds
that annually appear. For me, nature's call was a trivial prob
lem, but for her, it represented a 40-minute wait in line.
From a purely engineering standpoint, the male is unques
tionably a more efficient design.
While my friend was waiting in line, I chanced upon a
sign that read, "Win a vacation, enter here." Ordinarily I
would not have stopped, since nobody I know ever wins.
But since I had to stay within eyesight of the women 's latrine
and the entry was free, I decided to play the game. Besides,
they even provided a pencil. I was suspicious when the
entry blank requested my annual income, but I figured I
could resist any promotional gambit.
The following week my phone rang just as Judge Wopner
was giving his verdict. I heard, "Congratulations, Mr. Rstes,
you have been selected as an early winner." I had ap
parendy won one of four prizes and needed only to appear
in Foster City to spin a prize wheel and collect my loot. The
possible prizes were as follows: fourth prize — $75 in cash;
third prize — an AM/FM stereo cassette player; second prize
— $500 in cash and a three-day, two-night vacation in
paradise; and finally first prize — $1,000 in cash and a seven
day trip to the same place.
Sleaze oozed from the receiver. Such gimmicks have
become commonplace. I knew I hadn't won a legitimate
contest. 1 figured third and fourth prize had been reversed
to upgrade the image of a cheap Korean bargain-basement
cassette player. I picture a low-class Wheel of Fortune with
200 third prizes and one slot for each of the remaining.
Still, my curiosity was piqued. Surely, as an educated Stan
ford student, I couldn't fall prey to a sucker's game designed
to lure in the naive, the stupid, the gullible. Maybe I could
beat them at their own game. At the very worst, I would walk
away with a cassette player after listening to a sales pitch. I
agreed to appear and was given a scheduled time — an
other indication that I was being taken for a ride.
On the way to Foster City, I contemplated my strategy. I
could try the abruptly rude approach and demand to spin
the wheel immediately. As a legitimate contest winner, I
should not be obligated to listen to anything. If they

resisted, I could threaten to call the Better Business Bureau,
sue them for false advertising or, worse yet, write a nasty
column about them in The Stanford Daily. I decided on a
more tolerant and civil approach. I would listen and decline
as efficiently, politely and adamantly as possible.
I was intentionally 10 minutes late. Arriving late has never
been a problem for me — ask my instructors. I hoped to be
spared a portion of the presentation but not enough to be
sent away. I was right. I missed the opening remarks and
most of the TV tape glorifying various vacation spots around
the world. I quickly completed their questionnare, which
resembled those used by the Internal Revenue Service.
Next we were escorted to a theater for a slide show
celebrating the wonders of Lake Tahoe. It became apparent
that this was time-sharing propaganda for condos at Lake
Tahoe with the option of trading your time for other loca
tions. The nine synchronized slide projectors flashed skiers,
flowers, riders on horseback, fresh fish, mountain trails,
motor boats and resplendent views of the lake. The stereo
provided soothing background music. The narrator compli
mented the group for working so hard and urged us to take
the vacation we so richly deserved. They appealed at various
times to our sense of adventure, love of family, duty to self,
sense of pride and degree of patriotism. "Fast Eddie" would
have taken notes. It was effective.
When the lights came on, a salesperson appeared for each
couple or single person. While we had watched slides, they
had studied our questionnaires looking for weaknesses and
vulnerabilities. They were hungry and prepared for the kill.
They licked their chops and circled the couples looking for
the weaker member.
My saleswoman tried the low key approach but covered
all the bases. While plying me with coffee, she queried how
much I spend on vacations. What are my vacation plans for
the next 30 years? What about my children (who I Vvope do
not exist)? "These low prices will never be available again,"
she proclaimed. Since she was not a licensed agent,
however, she could not tell me what these low prices were.
She was only the initial assault. A licensed agent loomed in
the background.
Despite the repugnance of this scheme, it was difficult to
be terse or rude to a low level person who was simply doing
her job. I'm sure the designers of this ploy knew this and
were capitalizing on it fully. After 20 minutes, I convinced
her that I just wanted to spin the wheel and go home. She fi
nally relented.
The wheel was even more lopsided than I imagined, and
it actually consisted of both an inner and outer wheel. All
but one block on the inner wheel was a cassette player. If
you hit that one block upon spinning the inner wheel, you
were eligible to spin the outer wheel which had mosdy cas
sette players and the few cash prizes. Needless to say, I won
a cassette player. I was given the option of keeping the cas
sette player or trading it for a cheap AM/FM radio or a non-
AT&T phone. These guys never quit.
I grabbed the cassette player and ran for the door. I did
not look back for fear I would turn to stone. I don't know
who won. They had an hour and a half of my time and some
gasoline, while I had a cassette player and a subject for my
next column. I tempted the Fates and survived — but will
not try again soon. That method of advertising is dangerous.
I was lucky to escape with my credit cards. Anyone want to
buy a cassette player?
