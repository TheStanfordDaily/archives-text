Prop. 63 protects
all U.S. citizens
This is in response to the editorial
(Daily, Oct. 29) regarding Proposition
63. You state that this proposition is
unnecessary and would create much
aggression toward immigrants. Being
a naturalized immigrant from South
America, I disagree with you strongly.
I don't believe this law would make
other languages illegal.
On the contrary, it will require
English to he present also. This law is
in reaction to the increase of foreign
language businesses having no regard
for English speakers. This trend is
discriminatory against the majority.
I would like to cite an example
from personal experience. In New-
York City's Queens County, where I
just moved from, there has been an
influx of immigrants buying up busi
nesses. Increasingly, they put up signs
and notices incomprehensible to the
English speaker. In fact, many times
they will not an end to you because
you do not speak their language. The
English speaker, therefore, feels a
certain amount of frustration and,
possibly, hostility.
This is the kind of situation this law
is try ing to discourage. The law is
trying to protect the majority from
discrimination, and, at the same time,
protect the immigrants from hostility.
I support this law and think if for-

eigners want to open for business,
then they should do so for everyone.
Otherwise, we will have what this law
specifically wants to prevent: the
Tower of Babel.

Prop. 63 oppresses
ethnic minorities
A country like ours that prides itself
in pluralism does not need a law that
further oppresses the ethnic
minorities. Although English is the
"unofficial language' of the United
States, members of a far-right group
are attempting to pass a law that
would breed intolerance and bigotry.
Proposition 63. entitled "English as
the Official Language of California," is
one of the most misleading and
potentially harmful ballot measures
Californians have voted on in years
Proposition 63 is unnecessary, divisive
and dangerous.
Prop. 63 is a constitutional amend
ment that prohibits the California
legislature from taking any action that
"diminishes or ignores the role of
English. It also gives anyone the right
to sue if they think this vague law is
not enforced. In fact, the number of
costly suits that would be brought
aliout because of this law is one of the
strongest reasons why Californians
should vote against it. Prop. 63 is so

vague and far-reaching that it could
result in:
• the elimination of interpreters for
police, fire and emergency services,
including 911 telephone operators.
• the elimination of vital public ser
vice information, such as pamphlets
informing non-English-speaking par
ents how to enroll their children in
public schools.
• the elimination of interpreters at
puhlic hospitals and translated medi
cal admission forms for non-English
speaking patients.
• the elimination of bilingual pro
grams at public schools to help non-
English-speaking students iearn En
glish.
Prop. 63 will result in the filing of
numerous lawsuits to ban the use of
other languages every I where, includ
ing advertising by private businesses.
The California courts will be tied up
for years by people who want to
suppress language variation in our
state.
Although ethnic minorities have
always filled ESL (English as a Second
Language) classes to capacity, with
waiting lists years long, proponents
would have us believe that this law
will unite the various types of
Americans throughout California.
Unfortunately, there aren't even
enough classes for those who want to
learn English Instead of creating
more classes for English instruction,
Prop. 63 would limit or obliterate
bilingual programs that teach English,

which is why State Superintendent of
Public Instruction Bill Honig has
"urged all Californian voters to reject
Proposition 63."
Supporters of Prop. 63, like
Prof. Emeritus Ronald Hilton, who last
year compared Hispanics with Libyan
leader Moammar Khadafi in an article
in the Campus Report, think that Prop.
63 will create a common bond be
tween Californians besides citizen
ship. On the contrary, this ballot
measure breeds misunderstandings
and chaos. We, along with University-
President Donald Kennedy, Governor
Deukmejian, Sen. Alan Cranston,
Mayors Tom Bradley and Diane
Feinstein and many others, urge you
to vote no on Proposition 63. We
don't need our courts clogged with
language lawsuits. We need more ESL
classes.

Prop. 63 protects
all U.S. citizens
This is in response to the editorial
(Daily, Oct. 29) regarding Proposition
63. You state that this proposition is
unnecessary and would create much
aggression toward immigrants. Being
a naturalized immigrant from South
America, I disagree with you strongly.
I don't believe this law would make
other languages illegal.
On the contrary, it will require
English to he present also. This law is
in reaction to the increase of foreign
language businesses having no regard
for English speakers. This trend is
discriminatory against the majority.
I would like to cite an example
from personal experience. In New-
York City's Queens County, where I
just moved from, there has been an
influx of immigrants buying up busi
nesses. Increasingly, they put up signs
and notices incomprehensible to the
English speaker. In fact, many times
they will not an end to you because
you do not speak their language. The
English speaker, therefore, feels a
certain amount of frustration and,
possibly, hostility.
This is the kind of situation this law
is try ing to discourage. The law is
trying to protect the majority from
discrimination, and, at the same time,
protect the immigrants from hostility.
I support this law and think if for-

eigners want to open for business,
then they should do so for everyone.
Otherwise, we will have what this law
specifically wants to prevent: the
Tower of Babel.

Prop. 63 oppresses
ethnic minorities
A country like ours that prides itself
in pluralism does not need a law that
further oppresses the ethnic
minorities. Although English is the
"unofficial language' of the United
States, members of a far-right group
are attempting to pass a law that
would breed intolerance and bigotry.
Proposition 63. entitled "English as
the Official Language of California," is
one of the most misleading and
potentially harmful ballot measures
Californians have voted on in years
Proposition 63 is unnecessary, divisive
and dangerous.
Prop. 63 is a constitutional amend
ment that prohibits the California
legislature from taking any action that
"diminishes or ignores the role of
English. It also gives anyone the right
to sue if they think this vague law is
not enforced. In fact, the number of
costly suits that would be brought
aliout because of this law is one of the
strongest reasons why Californians
should vote against it. Prop. 63 is so

vague and far-reaching that it could
result in:
• the elimination of interpreters for
police, fire and emergency services,
including 911 telephone operators.
• the elimination of vital public ser
vice information, such as pamphlets
informing non-English-speaking par
ents how to enroll their children in
public schools.
• the elimination of interpreters at
puhlic hospitals and translated medi
cal admission forms for non-English
speaking patients.
• the elimination of bilingual pro
grams at public schools to help non-
English-speaking students iearn En
glish.
Prop. 63 will result in the filing of
numerous lawsuits to ban the use of
other languages every I where, includ
ing advertising by private businesses.
The California courts will be tied up
for years by people who want to
suppress language variation in our
state.
Although ethnic minorities have
always filled ESL (English as a Second
Language) classes to capacity, with
waiting lists years long, proponents
would have us believe that this law
will unite the various types of
Americans throughout California.
Unfortunately, there aren't even
enough classes for those who want to
learn English Instead of creating
more classes for English instruction,
Prop. 63 would limit or obliterate
bilingual programs that teach English,

which is why State Superintendent of
Public Instruction Bill Honig has
"urged all Californian voters to reject
Proposition 63."
Supporters of Prop. 63, like
Prof. Emeritus Ronald Hilton, who last
year compared Hispanics with Libyan
leader Moammar Khadafi in an article
in the Campus Report, think that Prop.
63 will create a common bond be
tween Californians besides citizen
ship. On the contrary, this ballot
measure breeds misunderstandings
and chaos. We, along with University-
President Donald Kennedy, Governor
Deukmejian, Sen. Alan Cranston,
Mayors Tom Bradley and Diane
Feinstein and many others, urge you
to vote no on Proposition 63. We
don't need our courts clogged with
language lawsuits. We need more ESL
classes.
