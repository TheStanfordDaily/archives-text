# Task Force attacked

### ANDREA ARNOLD 
The ASSU Senate Friday filled the
second of two student spots on the
Western Culture Task Force, and a
third position may he created.
The developments are part of a con
tinuing battle over the composition of
the task for,. : that began at Tuesday's
ASSU Senate meeting. At Tuesday's
meeting, the senate rejected one of
two nominees to the committee, soph
omore Barb Voss, in response to
protests by the Black Student Union
and other minority organizations that a
minority had not been nominated.
In a special meeting Friday, the sen
ate appointed junior Bill King, a mem
ber of the Black Student Union, to the
task force and passed a resolution
recommending that Provost James
Rosse allow Voss, a Caucasian, to join
the committee. Sophomore Jay Gilbert,
a Caucasian, was appointed to the task
force Tuesday by the ASSU.
Rosse, at a separate meeting Friday,
indicated he would favor adding an
other student member. "I was disap
pointed with the student selection
process," Rosse told members of a
group calling itself Students for Educa
tional Rights (SER). "If it takes three
students, I'll advocate it,':.', lie said.
Two students and five faculty mem
bers comprise the voting members of
the task force. Among the voting mem
bers, one is a woman, four are males of
European origin, and two are black.
The ex-offico members consist of one
Chicano and one woman. â™¦
Members of the SER met with Rosse
to urge him to place more minorities
on the task force.
But Rosse, who also leads the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies, said,
"I didn't design the task force to be
representative. I asked people to be on
it that I knew had some experience in
the issue, have thought deeply on it,
are good scholars and teachers and
would be good on the committee.''
Rosse formed the task force in early
October to study criticism that the
Western Culture Program fails to ad
dress the concerns and contributions
of women, minorities and other
cultures. The task force has been urged
to file a preliminary report by January.
Rosse also said he would remain
firm on the number of faculty mem
bers to the task force, despite SER's
demand that another non-European
faculty member be appointed. "My aim
was to make the committee small
enough to be able to make decisions,"
he said. "Otherwise it would get so
large it would be unmanageable."
According to Rosse, "The committee
has no power but to prepare a recom
mendation for the Faculty Senate, and
die senate has the power to change the
