## The 						power and the glory Student workers put passion back in politics 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Staff writer 
Vhiie mos Stanford students sometimes have 10 pulJ an
aIJ-nighter to finish a merer problem set or to cram lor some
trmal exam, some students work around the clock on cam
paigns of national importance for the upcoming election
Espeaalh no*-, with the election a day away, the cam
paigns demand incredible amounts of effon and time And
some students meet that demand, devoting months to their
candidates campaigns
Thy"' because this is. so much more than a fob ... it's a
passion,' said senior Ban Foster, a research coordinator for
Kep Ed Zschau s CK-Los Altos J campaign for U S Senate
Foster's primary responsibility is to research issues of
greatest interest to specific groups of Califormans to whom
Zschau wil] speak For instance, prior to a speech Zschau
gave to a gathering of reai-estate investors, Foster found
what specific issues would concern the group, so that
Zschau could emphasize them
Dedication to any campaign pb stems from political com
mitment That alone can sometimes be enough to justify all
the time and effort spent by the student on a campaign
"I've always been interested in the political process.' said
senior Matthew- Nosanchuk And I feel my contribution to it
will help the candidates who stand for what I believe in get
elected'
Nosanchuk, co-chairman of Stanford Students for
Cranston, is responsible for publicizing and mobilizing
workers for campaign events Fie started working on the
campaign for Sen Alan Cranston (D-Calif. ) because of his in
volvement with other political groups, particularly Stanford
Democrats and the Student Activism Network Poliucal Ac
tion Committee
For Nosanchuk, the party he belongs to had something to
do with choosing which candidate to work for. "I ve always

supported Cranston.' he said
Maik Lemlev, working on Lance "Weil s campaign for
Congress, had a much simpler reason for choosing who to
support "1 know Lance is a good candidate he said "And
his opponent is a nut"
Lemlev. who also acts as the liaison berween the differem
Democratic campaigns and the University, said he has
known Veil for a year already But for others, campaign jobs
offer the first chance io get to know their candidates
Nosanchuk was impressed -with Cranston "He s a warm,
down-to-earth individual
Foster felt similarly about Zschau 'Ed is nc* a poliuaan
in the negative sense orf the word.' he said. 'Hes very
honest and has a lex of integrity "
Working on a campaign has its high points as well as its
low points, and from these lessons are learned. Students of
ten find thai the political campaign process can be frustrat
ing and that the candidate and his staff have no control over
many of the aggravations For example, a lack of funds or
unflattering press coverage can have a great impact on a
campaign
"The whole role the press plays m politics is rather
frightening, said Foster
Nevertheless, the excitement of a campaign keeps the stu
dents hooked on their jobs. "There's a lot of adrenaline
around here.' said Foster. 'Everything's always done in the
panic mode
But tomorrow, all this excitement will come to an end
and the work these students have put into the campaigns
will just be experiences from -which they will base their
future career decisions. Fias this job made them more inter
ested in a career in politics for themselves'"
Nosanchuk said he's not aiming for a career in politics,
but "I am very interested in a career in public service'
"I think so.' agreed Lemlev
"I doubt it said Foster
