"Mr. Devil, feel some brains
"I think I'll just go on," said Mr
Devil, a second-grader But then he
decided otherwise and bravely
plunged his hand into the cloth

glowing pumpkins and ominously
large fraternity men.
And there was candy to reward his
bravery
There was so much candy that Alana
BametL a down, said she wasn't going
trick-or-treating after her haunted
house tour because. "I don't think my
bucket could hold anymore. And I
think I'll have enough to last me til
Christmas.
Three fraternities started something
new Friday â€” they worked together
on an ambitious Halloween project for
elementary school children
Senior Steve Singleton, president of

the lnterfratemm. Council, said the IFC
wanted to initiate a project around Hal
loween involving several fraternities
The IFC went to Sigma Alpha Ep
silon, Kappa Sigma and Ftu Delta Theta
and rallied them together to make
haunted houses Singleton said
"We asked each house to spend as
much as they'd iike. and the IFC would
reimburse each house $100, for a totaJ
of $390." he said
"A lot of houses were spending
more than that using their own
money," added senior Steve Stanford.

Although each fraternity had its own
style of haunted house. Phi Delta
Theta s was a typical tour. The entrance
offered a table with a plate full of
pumpkin-shaped sugar cookies and a
guess-the-number-of-Froot-Loops-in
the-jar contest with a model Porsche as
first prize
For each group of trick-or-treaters.

there was a costumed fraternity mem
ber to guide them through to the
operating room which had a lrve pa
tient being cut up wah butcher knives.
Rubber body parts, red sauces and a
writhing patient made a all seem ter
ribly realistic especially to one little
angel who cried.
She got a toy boat and a hug from
Gordo the friendly. English-speaking
gornlla. to help dry her tears
Then she went bo the tungle room"
for candy treasure Bill, the safari
guide, led her to the hut of the candy
man who filled her pumpkin bucket
with chocolaes and toys
Seeing that the little angel was
young and impressionable, two beasts
refrained from attacking her along the
way.
The IFC advertised to both elemen
tary and junior high school grades by
distributing fivers to area schools and
by informing local newspapers, Stan
ford explained. The fraternities ex
pected to get a lot of junior high stu
dents, but a majority of visitors were
younger than fifth-grade age.
"The problem is we expected older
kids, but we got a lot of kids who were
three and four. So we just tamed every
thing down," said junior Vinnie Frost, a

Phi Delt guide.
Singleton explained that the location
of the fraternity houses posed a prob
lem. "This is a hard place to find, so
we've put people at the end of the
street to help out," Singleton said.
"One thing we should concentrate on
next year is better directions."
"Some of the masks are scary and we
forgot what it's like being four years
old with all these big people around.
So we're trying to make ourselves as
unintimidating as possible by taking off
our masks if the kids look frightened at

all," Frost said.
After Jim Thomson, a parent,
emerged from the Phi Delt tour,
he said he was scared by a silhouetted
hobgoblin who jumped at him from
the wall of the Jungle Room.
"The haunted house is terrific. It
took a lot of creativity. The fraternity
guys really make it exciting and bring it
to life. A lot of haunted houses like this
are kind of boring. The tour guide and
the way they are acting make it come
alive," Thomson said.
