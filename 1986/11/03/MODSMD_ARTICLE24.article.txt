## Tempered optimism for China's future 
### CLARA WU 
"After the Nightmare"
By Liang Heng and Judith Shapiro
Alfred A. Knopf, New York
$16.95
"After the Nightmare" is a personal
and readable account of China since
the Cultural Revolution. The authors,
Liang Heng and his American wife
Judith Shapiro, see a tentative but dis
cernible trend away from the inflexible
and brutal practices of the Maoist era.
Liang and Shapiro also wrote "Son
of the Revolution," a frank account of
Liangs experiences growing up during
the turbulent Cultural Revolution.
"After the Nightmare" was written in
response to an invitation by Commu
nist government officials to return to
China to observe economic reforms
and growing nation-wide prosperity.
In contrast to what he encountered
as Red Guard and then as a disillu
sioned, bitter intellectual during the
Cultural Revolution, Liang finds the
general mood of the nation to be one
of optimism. However, while ack
nowledging an apparent trend to in

dividualism and limited freedom, he
nevertheless finds many remaining
deficiencies in the Communist system.
Crisscrossing the country, Liang and
Shapiro visit many open areas, forbid
den zones, the historical cities of Xi'an
and Yan'an, Changsha (Liang's
hometown) and even Dazhai, the
commune chosen by Mao as a model
for the nation. Throughout the land,
they visit old friends and encounter
many colorful individuals — each
unique, but ' bound together by their

struggle to understand their conflicting
historical past.
Peng Ming, Liang's former idol in the
Red Guard, has remained loyal to
Communist party ideals, despite his
unwarranted imprisonment for
criticizing the privileged bureaucratic
class. Tao Sen, once a left-wing demo
crat, has now become an aggressive
entrepreneur. And Wu Tianming, one
of China's most reknowned
filmmakers, continues to struggle to
balance creative freedom with

restrictive Communist reforms.
Liang writes: "I could scarcely take
in this sudden switch The changes in
people's lives came too fast, were too
unpredictable. People shot to the
heights and plummeted to the depths
in the space of a moment. Sometimes it
seemed one could never be certain of
anything in China."
Where once there was despair and
gloom, seeds of optimism had been
planted, and the hopes of the people
are shooting upward, bending toward
the sun. Peng Ming grows excited, for
example, when he speaks of "having a
chance to build a party in which once
again every member serves the people
with heart and soul." Tao Sen com
ments on the increased freedom
people have to find their own jobs and
to choose their own hours. Stigmas
from former campaigns no longer ex
ist, he claims. Everywhere people are
cheerful, anxious to tell their stories.
In spite of the dark past, or perhaps
more appropriately, because that past
was so dark, the people find them
selves comparatively happy today.
In the words of one woman: "If you
asked me 15 years ago to predict the
future of a people in China, I would

never have dreamed of the good treat
ment we are getting today." The gener
ation that has grown up since the Cul
tural Revolution is politically naive —
most have never participated in a cam
paign. Their faces adorn the cover of
the book, eagerly peering at the
outside world.
Although the people seem con
vinced that the political and economic
situation is moving in a positive direc
tion, Liang and Shapiro are skeptical.
They admit some things are changing,
but are reluctant to believe that the
party can ever be as democratic as
Peng Ming implies it can be — people
will still have to choose between a life
of political subservience or, if they try
to exert any freedom, a life of danger.
Although the authors acknowledge that
economic reforms have made life less
difficult, they remain convinced that
the fundamental problem — that of a
faulty system — will need to be ad
dressed before the people can have
complete faith in the nation.
In Liang's eyes, China is still a back
ward nation. It is a country where the
people are still poor, where the stan
dard of living is low and where the
supremacy of the party cannot be chai

lenged. Catholic priests, for example,
remain imprisoned in China today for
opposing abortion and birth control.
Liang and Shapiro also describe in
detail the lice-infested hotels, the
outdated highways and the unsafe
transportation vehicles.
What is most disillusioning to Liang
and Shapiro is the emphasis on rank,
hierarchy and connections. Scams and
special privileges for those with con
nections with local party officials lead
to great efforts to curry favor and seek
connections. Liang and Shapiro portray
a modern China still plagued by mid
night raids, suspicion, distrust, stupefy
ing backwardness and corrupt
bureaucrats with inflated egos.
Liang and Shapiro provide a per
sonal and insightfiil account of current
attitudes in China today. Written simply
and clearly, "After the Nightmare" ap
peals to the emotions — the very emo
tions that the Communist system sup
presses. Underneath the surface is a
hypocritical government that thrives
on scandal and has forgotten the inter
ests of the people. As one peasant com
ments: "Deng lives in the sky and I
way down below on Earth. I can hear
him ... but he can't hear me."

response to an invitation by Commu
nist government officials to return to
China to observe economic reforms
and growing nation-wide prosperity.
In contrast to what he encountered
as Red Guard and then as a disillu
sioned, bitter intellectual during the
Cultural Revolution, Liang finds the
general mood of the nation to be one
of optimism. However, while ack
nowledging an apparent trend to in

dividualism and limited freedom, he
nevertheless finds many remaining
deficiencies in the Communist system.
Crisscrossing the country, Liang and
Shapiro visit many open areas, forbid
den zones, the historical cities of Xi'an
and Yan'an, Changsha (Liang's
hometown) and even Dazhai, the
commune chosen by Mao as a model
for the nation. Throughout the land,
they visit old friends and encounter
many colorful individuals — each
unique, but ' bound together by their

struggle to understand their conflicting
historical past.
Peng Ming, Liang's former idol in the
Red Guard, has remained loyal to
Communist party ideals, despite his
unwarranted imprisonment for
criticizing the privileged bureaucratic
class. Tao Sen, once a left-wing demo
crat, has now become an aggressive
entrepreneur. And Wu Tianming, one
of China's most reknowned
filmmakers, continues to struggle to
balance creative freedom with

restrictive Communist reforms.
Liang writes: "I could scarcely take
in this sudden switch The changes in
people's lives came too fast, were too
unpredictable. People shot to the
heights and plummeted to the depths
in the space of a moment. Sometimes it
seemed one could never be certain of
anything in China."
Where once there was despair and
gloom, seeds of optimism had been
planted, and the hopes of the people
are shooting upward, bending toward
the sun. Peng Ming grows excited, for
example, when he speaks of "having a
chance to build a party in which once
again every member serves the people
with heart and soul." Tao Sen com
ments on the increased freedom
people have to find their own jobs and
to choose their own hours. Stigmas
from former campaigns no longer ex
ist, he claims. Everywhere people are
cheerful, anxious to tell their stories.
In spite of the dark past, or perhaps
more appropriately, because that past
was so dark, the people find them
selves comparatively happy today.
In the words of one woman: "If you
asked me 15 years ago to predict the
future of a people in China, I would

never have dreamed of the good treat
ment we are getting today." The gener
ation that has grown up since the Cul
tural Revolution is politically naive —
most have never participated in a cam
paign. Their faces adorn the cover of
the book, eagerly peering at the
outside world.
Although the people seem con
vinced that the political and economic
situation is moving in a positive direc
tion, Liang and Shapiro are skeptical.
They admit some things are changing,
but are reluctant to believe that the
party can ever be as democratic as
Peng Ming implies it can be — people
will still have to choose between a life
of political subservience or, if they try
to exert any freedom, a life of danger.
Although the authors acknowledge that
economic reforms have made life less
difficult, they remain convinced that
the fundamental problem — that of a
faulty system — will need to be ad
dressed before the people can have
complete faith in the nation.
In Liang's eyes, China is still a back
ward nation. It is a country where the
people are still poor, where the stan
dard of living is low and where the
supremacy of the party cannot be chai

lenged. Catholic priests, for example,
remain imprisoned in China today for
opposing abortion and birth control.
Liang and Shapiro also describe in
detail the lice-infested hotels, the
outdated highways and the unsafe
transportation vehicles.
What is most disillusioning to Liang
and Shapiro is the emphasis on rank,
hierarchy and connections. Scams and
special privileges for those with con
nections with local party officials lead
to great efforts to curry favor and seek
connections. Liang and Shapiro portray
a modern China still plagued by mid
night raids, suspicion, distrust, stupefy
ing backwardness and corrupt
bureaucrats with inflated egos.
Liang and Shapiro provide a per
sonal and insightfiil account of current
attitudes in China today. Written simply
and clearly, "After the Nightmare" ap
peals to the emotions — the very emo
tions that the Communist system sup
presses. Underneath the surface is a
hypocritical government that thrives
on scandal and has forgotten the inter
ests of the people. As one peasant com
ments: "Deng lives in the sky and I
way down below on Earth. I can hear
him ... but he can't hear me."

"After the Nightmare"
By Liang Heng and Judith Shapiro

"After the Nightmare" is a personal
and readable account of China since
the Cultural Revolution. The authors,
Liang Heng and his American wife
Judith Shapiro, see a tentative but dis
cernible trend away from the inflexible
and brutal practices of the Maoist era.
Liang and Shapiro also wrote "Son
of the Revolution," a frank account of
Liangs experiences growing up during
the turbulent Cultural Revolution.
