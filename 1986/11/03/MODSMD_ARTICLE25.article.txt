## Card musters 42-12 victory over WSU 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
There's something about losing that
brings out the intensity in the Stanford
Cardinal. It's only happened twice in
this 6-2 season, but there's a feeling
that just seems to sit there all week
long until another Saturday brings with
it the chance for atonement.
And so it was this Saturday. After a
10-0 loss to USC last week, the Cardinal

offense showed it is better than its na
tional television performance, rolling
up 497 yards en route to a 42-12
thrashing of Washington State before a
disappointing gathering of 35,000 in
the final game this season at Stanford
Stadium.
Stanford has scored 14 total points
in its two losses and 83 points in the
two games immediately following
those losses.
"When we came out Monday," cen

ter Andy Sinclair said, "we knew. We
knew we'd been shut out, beaten. We
came out and worked hard all week.
There's a kind of bond between us."
The result was a record-setting day
for running back Brad Muster. Used
sparingly against USC, Muster Saturday
saw the ball more than any back in
Stanford history. His 35 carries broke
the record of 34 set by Ernie Nevers
against Notre Dame and tied by Muster
against California two years ago.

Muster finished with 181 yards and two
touchdowns before he left in the
fourth quarter to a standing ovation.
He also caught six passes for 93 yards,
including a 31 -yard post pattern.
"We had to figure out how not to get
him the ball at the end," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway joked. "We concen
trated all week, had something to
prove today, and we did."
"We wanted to prove last week
wasn't typical of the Stanford offense,"
Muster said. "We went after it in
practice. I think the offensive line was
getting stronger out there as the game
went along. I was sort of getting beat
up. That's why we were successful;
they controlled the game. You don't
know with Coach Elway's offense —
there are so many talented players, any
of them could get the ball. I was just
fortunate it was me."
"Brad had an amazing day," Sinclair
said. "He's by far the best runner I've
seen in the Pac-10. When he runs hard,
it makes you want to hold your blocks
harder. The best part of Brad Muster is
seeing the back of him."
On defense, the Cougars used a
unique look, taking a basic 4-3 — with
four down linemen and two outside
linebackers on the line — and slanting
both tackles in at Sinclair, who was un
covered at center against the even
defense.
"You have to credit Steve Axman,"
Sinclair said of the Stanford offensive
line coach. "He did an incredible job
preparing for this game. Washington
State ran a defense I never saw before,
and he had us ready. We basically just
came off the ball and double-teamed
frontside and pulled someone
backside. I think as a unit we played a
great game. We played solid and did
what we had to do."
With the running game established,
the pressure was off quarterback John
Paye, who came back from a disap
pointing 122-yard, three-interception
day against USC by completing 17-of
-25 passes for 214 yards — with a 17-
yard touchdown pass to wide receiver
Jeff James — and no interceptions.
"If they have respect for the run,"
Paye said, "they can't really tee off on
the quarterback and play the pass. It

makes my job easier."
Pave also ran for 36 yards, including
a one-yard sneak and a seven-yard
bootleg for touchdowns, the first time
he has scored two touchdowas in a
game in his collegiate career.
"When you go back and nobody's
open, you can't force the ball," he said.
"If you can run the ball, it puts added
pressure on the defense. It's very
demoralizing on third-and-eight when
you take away the pass with your
coverage, and we get the first down
running."
On the other side, the Stanford
defense again played an outstanding
game, something that has come to be
taken for granted here for perhaps the
first time since the Thunderchickens of
the Rose Bowl teams of 1970 and 1971.
This year's scheme has been termed
the "Vanilla Defense" by defensive co
ordinator Dick Mannini, "because it's
so simple," according to cornerback
Toi Cook.
"I think we've played the best
defense in the country for eight con
secutive weeks," said Cook, who
started for the first time since fractur
ing his wrist four weeks ago. "We've
played day in and day out. Even in our
losses, we've played good defense.
We've got the best defense in the Pac
-10 — I feel the best defense in the
country."
"We kicked some butt playing our
basic defense like we did," defensive
tackle Tony Leiker said.
The effort was led, as usual, by
linebacker David Wyman. The finalist
for the Butkus Trophy, given to the
best linebacker in the country, led the
Cardinal with 11 tackles. In the fourth
quarter, when Washington State tried a
double-reverse pass, he had a spectac
ular, one-handed interception that he
returned 19 yards to the Washington
State 7-yard line to set up Muster's
second touchdown.
"It was my left hand on the intercep
tion," Wyman said, "and I'm right
handed. I expected to tip it, and it
came down. I was so surprised I had
the ball."
"I just want to say one thing," Leiker
said. "Dave's interception was
awesome. Really awesome."

Wyman's statistics were far Ix'low his
average, but that was largely because
the defense kept Washington State oft"
the field most of the time. The Cougars
netted 296 yards on offense, but only
ran 53 plays to 85 for Stanford, and had
the ball for less than 21 minutes, to
more than 39 for the Cardinal.
The result left Cougar Coach Jim
Walden even more confused about his
team, which fell to 3-4-1, 2-3-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference. So far this
season, the Cougars have lost to San
Jose State and hapless California, have
come back to tie league-leader Arizona
State and beat USC, and they now have
given up 96 points in games at 11CIA
and Stanford the last two weeks.
"A little too much Muster and too
much Stanford," Walden said, "and not
enough Washington State. We're just
right now working ourselves into a not
very good football team. There wasn't
much resistance out there today, and
they had a nice game plan. I'll give all
the credit to Stanford. They came out
and executed us to death.
"I'm not going to pitch another fit. It
has to carry to them. This team just
refuses to believe it has some talent.
No inner confidence."
The only area of concern for the
Cardinal was again the placekicking of
David Sweeney. The junior made all
six of his extra points, but missed field
goal attempts of 40 and 44 yards in the
second quarter and had a 32-yarder
blocked in the third quarter. For the
season, Sweeney has made 3-of-11, but
has missed all eight of his tries over 30
yards.
The Cardinal had a 28-0 lead at
halftime, the same margin it led by two
years ago, when the Cougars scored
five touchdowns in the final 20
minutes to erase a 42-14 Stanford lead
and win 49-42. This year, though, the
Stanford defense was in control.
"I'm thrilled with number six," El
way said. "I'll tell you, that erased some
bad memories. We have real respect
for their program and respect for
Coach Walden. It was a damn good
win."

Opposing offenses have had trouble breaking free from the Stanford defense this season, and Saturday was no excep
tion. Here, Washington State quarterback Ed Blount is hounded by Cardinal noseguard Eric Volta. Blount got the
pass off, but it was intercepted by linebacker David Wyman.
quarter on a two-yard run by fullback
Kerry Porter that was set up by a 60-
yard pass play from Ed Blount to wide
receiver Tim Stallworth. A bad snap
precluded the conversion. The final
Washington State score, a 36-yard pass
from Timm Rosenbach to wide
receiver Kitrick Taylor, came long after
the Cardinal starters had retired to the
sideline.
The victory assured Stanford of its
first winning season since 1980, and
ended a string of Five straight losing
seasons, the only time that had hap
pened since Stanford starting fielding
teams in 1891.
"It's a feeling of satisfaction for the
time-being," Wyman said, "but we're
not going to be satisfied until we finish
9-2."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, now
3-2 in the Pac-io, its Rose Bowl hopes
were virtually extinguished Saturday
night when Arizona State defeated
Washington, 34-21. Since Stanford
does not play the Sun Devils, Arizona
State would have to lose its final two
Pac-10 games to California and Arizona
to finish behind Stanford, should the
Cardinal win its final three. ASU is 4-0-1

in the conference, 7-0-1 overall. Cal is
1-5 in the Pac-10,1-7 overall.
The Cardinal has also all but assured
itself of a postseason bowl bid,
however. A representitive from the
Freedom Bowl in Anaheim was again
in attendence Saturday, and six other
bowls have expressed an interest in
Stanford. "I really want that bowl ring,"
Leiker said. "1 really think that would
be awesome. I think everyone else
thinks that would be awesome, too."
Next week Stanford travels to UCLA,
the third top-20 team the Cardinal will
face. The other two, Washington and
USC, have dealt Stanford its only two
losses. "For the postseason, UCLA is a
big game," Wyman said. "They're one
of four tough teams on our schedule.
Someone said if we win all the games
we should win, we'll finish 7-4. That's
not good enough for us."
