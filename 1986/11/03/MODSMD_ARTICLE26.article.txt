### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
With five road wins over the
weekend, the top-rated Stanford men's
water polo team extended its con
secutive win streak to 39 games, tying
an NCAA record.
After playing its toughest game yet
this season Friday, the Cardinal over
whelmed four Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation foes Saturday and yesterday,
running its record to 30 0 (3-0 in
Pacific 10 Conference play).
Friday, the Cardinal found itself be
hind in a contest for the first time this
year but bounced back to defeat No. 4
Pepperdine in Malibu, 11-8.
Playing in the 49er Invitational at
Long Beach Saturday and yesterday,
Stanford thoroughly dominated each
opponent, with the closest margin of
victory being six goals. Saturday, Stan
ford crushed No. 7 UC-Irvine 14-8 and
No. 8 Santa Barbara 12-5. The Cardinal
wound up the weekend yesterday by
trouncing Long Beach State 10-4 and
UC-San Diego 16-5.
With the five wins, Stanford has now
won 39 straight games dating back to
last year, tying the NCAA record set by

the Cardinal (1980-1982). Stanford's
last loss was to Long Beach State 6-5 in
overtime in the same tournament last
October.
Stanford was led by junior Erich Fis
cher with 11 goals on the weekend and
senior Craig Klass with nine. Senior
David Imbernino and sophomore sup
ersub Jeff Oeding each chipped in
eight goals.
Fischer increased his team-leading
scoring output to 75 goals, followed
closely by Klass with 70.
Against the 18-7 Waves (8-0 in PCAA
play) Friday, the Cardinal found itself
in its most competitive game this year.
"The toughest game by far was Pep
perdine," Stanford Coach Dante Detta
manti said. "They prepared all week
for us. It was our toughest game of the
year. If I had to rank the teams right
now, I'd rank them No. 2 in the na
tion."
The Cardinal fell behind twice in the
first quarter before ending the first half
with a 6-4 lead.

third quarter. At the end of that quar
ter, the Cardinal was only ahead by a
single goal.
"It was the first time this year that
one of our games was close at the end
of the third quarter," Dettamanti said.
In the fourth period, however, the
Cardinal pulled away, scoring four

goals to Pepperdine's two to bring the
score to its final 11-8 margin.
Seniors Greg Ocasek and Greg
Gamble and Fischer each scored two
goals in the contest for the Cardinal.
"It was probably one of our better
team efforts," Dettamanti said.
"Anybody can score on our team. 1
think it shows the character of our
team when eight different guys score."
After facing a tough Wave squad on
Friday, Stanford breezed past four
PCAA opponents Saturday and yester

day in the 49er Invitational.
Saturday, the Cardinal jumped out to
a 7-1 halftime lead against Irvine,
defeating the Anteaters 14-8 for its
third victory over the PCAA school this
year.
Fischer and Klass led Stanford with
three goals each, followed by Ocasek,
Imbernino and Oeding with two.
Yesterday, the Cardinal closed out
the tournament with a 10-4 win over
the 49ers and a 16-5 drubbing of
UCSD.
