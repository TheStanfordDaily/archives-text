# Spikers take two; league record 10-1

### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
If you went into Maples Pavilion Friday or Saturday night
for what you thought would be a full evening of volleyball,
then you left very disappointed. If, however, you went into
the arena to see the Stanford women's volleyball team con
vincingly defeat two quality teams, you left very satisfied.
The Cardinal avenged an early-season defeat by Oregon
and showed Oregon State that this Stanford squad is much
better than the one that edged the Beavers in five games in
the teams' first meeting — defeating both schools handily in
a combined two hours and 45 minutes.
The wins put the Cardinal at 10-1 in Pacific 10 Conference
play, well out in front of all conference rivals, save the UCLA
Bruins, who went into the weekend in first place by a half
game. Stanford, though, trounced UQA in three straight
games a month ago.
Stanford (14-7) is ranked ninth nationally with 10 games
remaining on its schedule before the NCAA playoffs com
mence in December. The No. 15 Ducks are 17 -8, third in
the Pac-10 with a 8-4 record. OSU is 5-18 and 1-11 in league.
The Cardinal was expecting Saturday night's Oregon con
test to be its toughest match of the weekend. Everybody got
home early, though, as Stanford faltered only in the second
game, winning 15-4, 10-15, 15-3 and 15-6 in 90 minutes.
The blasting attack one would predict to come from a
team with two of the nation's top-five hitters was never a fac
tor, and the Ducks' subpar performance was a little con-
tagious in the early going.
"We expected Oregon to come out a
little more ready to play, but they
weren't playing very well," Stanford
sener Wendi Rush said. "Consequently,
I think we slacked off a little toward
their level."
Communication and concentration
were the villians, according to Rush
and middle blocker Nancy Reno, and
resulted in a couple of balls that
simply dropped in front of the Card
inal back row. The squad came back
from the intermission following the

second game to dominate Oregon in a
10-minute third game.
Despite a couple of lapses in game
four and stronger play on Oregon's
pan, the result of the match was never
really in question.
Rush said that while this Stanford
team is far superior to the one that first
played Oregon, she and her teammates
cannot take all of the credit for the big
turnaround from the first Duck-
Cardinal match to the second. "I just
don't think it was one of their better
matches " she said.
Friday's victory over OSU was
lowlighted by Reno's reinjury to her
right ankle, but highlighted by the play
of Laura Olesen, as she compensated
for the loss of her fellow middle

blocker. Olesen hit 10 times, and all 10
hits went for kills, producing a 1.000
hitting percentage. The sophomore
also led the squad in blocks with six.
Of course, she didn't do all the
blocking herself. Freshmen Jenny
Chaffee and Jessica Benton saw a lot of
court time and took advantage of it,
proving the Cardinal's depth on the
front line.
The Beavers suffered a major blow
to their upset chances when, early in
the first game, their captain and setter,
Carol Sears, injured her knee badly
and had to be carried off the court to
the team's locker room. The OSU team
that took the Cardinal to five games in
Corvallis was not the same team that
lost 15-6, 15-9 and 15-2 Fridav.
