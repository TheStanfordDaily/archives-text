# Field hockey extends streak
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
One streak ended, but a more important one continued
on Friday as the Stanford field hockey team defeated a pesky-
San Jose State squad 4-2 at Stanford
The Cardinal had not allowed a goal since losing 3-1 on
Oct. 1 to the Spartans, recording seven consecutive
shutouts. Although its scoreless string is gone, Stanford's
winning streak is still intact at eight The victory upped the
Cardinal's overall record to 10-4-1 and improved its North
ern Pacific Conference mark to 4-1-1.
The loss, the Spartans' seventh in their last eight games,
dropped them to 2-5-0 in the NorPac and 2-9-1 overall
The first half was an explosive one offensively, as each
team scored two goals and had numerous scoring opportu
nities. Maree Chung put the Cardinal on top early with a
rebound shot at the 5:47 mark. It was her third goal of the
season.
But less than eight minutes later, Stanford goalkeeper
Karen Jones saw the ball go by her for the first time in over
500 minutes of field hockey, as San Jose State's Tina Royce
beat her at 13:24 to tie the game at one.
"When it went in, the thought (of losing the scoreless
string) crossed my mind, Stanford sweeper Dana Fleming
said. "But then I knew we had to get back to the task at hand.
A shutout is nice, but we want to come out with the win
The Cardinal struck back quickly to regain the lead. Spar
tan goalkeeper Jill Jacobson was able to knock down a high
shot by Chung, but this time it was Kat Thomas who was
there for the rebound to put Stanford back .ihead 2-1 at the
17:40 mark

"The midfielders' job is to take the long shot and put it on
the goalie's pads, and we (the forwards) put it in," Chung
said.
Stanford dominated the next nine minutes of play, but
San Jose State hung tough and finally mounted a counterat
tack. Fleming blcx-ked a long Spartan shot, but the rebound
went right to Tina Parrott, who poked it into the left side of
the goal to tie it up again at 27 ; 00.
Although it had outshot the Spartans 12-7, the Cardinal
found itself tied at the half. But tilings didn't stay even for
long, as Stanford more or less settled the issue in the first six
minutes of the second half.
The Cardinal took the second-half passback and pounded
its way through the Spartan defense. Once again, it was
Chung who took the initial shot and Thomas who finished
filings off. Jacobson barely stopped Chung's shot near the
right post, then Thomas dashed in from the left, outfought
Jacobson for the rebound and stuffed the ball by her to put
Stanford ahead 3-2 just 30 seconds into the half. It was
Thomas's sixth goal of the year.
Five minutes later, Jacobson was caught in a similar posi
tion, but this time, not wanting to be beaten by a fourth
rebound shot, she trapped the ball with her body. Unlike in
ice hockey, this is illegal in field hockey Stanford was
awarded a stroke (a penalty shot), and Fleming converted to
finish the day's scoring.
The four goals marked the Cardinal's biggest offensive
output of the year.
According to Thomas, the memory of the earlier loss to
the Spartans was on the Stanford players minds "We knew
we lost to them last time," she said "It was ridiculous they
scored that manv goals."
