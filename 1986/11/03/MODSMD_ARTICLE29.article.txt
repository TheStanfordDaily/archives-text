## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Spartan Field proved a lucky spot
for the Stanford men's soccer team
this Halloween weekend. The Card
inal, winless in its last four games,
broke the string and recorded its
first conference victory with a 2-0
win Saturday at San Jose State.
Stanford's goal against the Univer
sity of San Francisco on Oct. 26 was
its first in three games. The goal
came in a 3-1 loss to the highly
ranked Dons.
The Cardinal has now come all the
way hack, producing its first win
since a succesful trip to UC-Davis —
the last time it scored more than one
goal in a game The victory raised
Stanford's record to 6-9-2 and 1-3 in
the Pacific Soccer Conference. The
Spartans fell to 6-9-3 and 1-5 in the
conference.

There had been some concern
this year, as in previous years, about
going into San Jose to play the Spar
tans Spartan Field is both narrower
and shorter than a regulation field
and is enclosed by a wall that
separates the stands and the field.
But it did not seem to bother the
visiting Cardinal
"I liked it (the field)," freshman
forward Chris Porch said. "It's kind
of closed in Play was a little sloppy
because it's so narrow, but we
worked the field well."
Work it well they did. The Card
inal played as if possessed early on
and quickly established a 1-0 lead at
the seven-minute mark of the first
half, when senior midfielder Mike
Mossmer convened an indirect free
kick on a pass from sophomore
midfielder Luke Garrott
The shot found its way between
two defenders' heads before going

into the goal. "Mike hit it through the
wall (of defenders, set up for the free
kick), and it went in the upper left
hand corner of the net. It was a first
time shot off the pass (from Gar
rott)," second string goalkeeper
Chris Helling said.
The Cardinal didn't let up.
Keeping the San Jose defense under
constant pressure, Stanford struck
for the back-breaker at the 39-
minute mark of the first half. Sopho
more forward Juan Garcia put in a
header on a corner kick by Jim Cole.
Sophomore David Thorpe, who
seems to be involved whenever the
ball is airborne, also picked up an as
sist.
"It (the corner kick) went to the
far post, Porch said "It was headed
back to the middle of the goal (by
Thorpe), and Juan headed it in past
the keeper."
