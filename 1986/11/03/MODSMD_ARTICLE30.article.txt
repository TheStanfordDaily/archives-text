# Stanford runners host Pac-10 foes
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Though less than half of fall quarter
has elapsed, conference championship
competition has already begun, as
Stanford hosts the Pacific 10 Confer
ence cross country championships
today at the golf course.
Stanford enters the meet with excel
lent chances of victory in both the
men's and women's races. Both teams
are ranked in the top 10 nationally,
coming off very successful seasons.
The Cardinal, however, is hardly a
cinch for either title. "There are three
or four teams that can get right after
you," Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson
said. "With three teams in the top 10, it
is evident that this is the best cross
country conference in the country."
Johnson makes no hasty predictions
as to the outcome, especially in the
men's race. "Over 10,000 meters, any
thing can happen," he said. "It will be

tough to repeat last year." Stanford is
the returning Pac-10 champion.
One prediction made by many in the
sport concerns Marc Olesen. Olesen,
the returning Pac-10 champ as well as
the top scorer back from last year's
NCAA meet, has a strong chance at
keeping his title for another year.
"Olesen has done a fantastic job of
gening ready," Johnson said.
"There are no excuses," he added.
"We're ready to go, and if we don't get
it done, we'll have to look inside. We
control our own destiny."
There are quite a few teams to
watch. In the men's race, second
ranked Arizona and No. 7 Oregon will
give the Cardinal, No. 9, a good run for
the money.
The women will also face a strong
field of competitors with Oregon,
UCLA and California.
"This is the essense of what competi
tive cross country is about," Johnson
said.
