The Stanford women's golf team could not blast its way into the top 10 at its own tournament this weekend.
Chapman captured first and second
place, respectively, in the individual
competition. Redman fired a 221 over
the three days to take the title.
Chapman finished a stroke behind
her teammate at 222, tying her for
runner-up honors with Southern Meth
odist's Tami Henningsen.
As was the case with the team com
petition, Stanford did not place
anybody in the individual top 10. The
Cardinal's top finisher was Kathleen
McCarthy, who shot 232 for the tourna
ment.
McCarthy shot a promising 75 in
Friday's opening round, but her scores
increased with each day. The senior,
who was the runner-up in the U.S.

79 for the final two rounds.
Junior Kay Cornelius, who has been
playing No. 1 for the Cardinal this fall,
was the team's second finisher at 236.
Both Trish McGonigle and Clare
Dolan carded 242 for Stanford.
Adrienne Gilmartin rounded out the
team's scoring with a 243.
