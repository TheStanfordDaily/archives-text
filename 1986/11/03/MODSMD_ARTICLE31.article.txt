The Stanford women's golf team
paid the price for inviting many of the
nation's top teams to its tournament
this weekend, finishing in 11th place,
34 strokes behind tournament cham
pion Indiana.
The Hoosiers, ranked No. 9 in the
nation, captured the Stanford Women's
Intercollegiate with a three-round total
of 907. San Jose State came in second at
912, followed by Oklahoma State
(916), top-ranked USC (919) and Tulsa
(921).
The Cardinal, ranked No. 8, was not
the only team to put in a subpar perfor
mance this weekend. Second-ranked
Arizona State finished in ninth place at
930, and No. 3 New Mexico came in
seventh place.
