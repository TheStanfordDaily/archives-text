### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team's
season ended with a fizzle Saturday, as
the Cardinal dropped another close
match to a tough visiting team, losing
2-0 at Maloney Field to the Santa Clara
Broncos. The Cardinal finished the
season at 3-12-1.
The Broncos came into the game
with a record of 10-4-2, yet the Card
inal handled Santa Clara in the same
way it had played against better teams
all season â€” keeping it a close match
up until the end.
From the beginning of the game,
Stanford played up to the Broncos'
level. Stanford led off with some force
ful offensive drives, as did the Broncos,
but both defenses were steadfast.
For the first 30 minutes of the game,
the two teams were virtually even in
possession time. At the 30-minute
mark, though, the Broncos scored the
first goal.
Forward Sophia Vicent kicked a long
cross-field pass to Jenni Symons, who
put the ball in the goal from the ex
treme right of the goalie's box.
Symons, star forward and high scorer
for the Broncos, gained her 20th point
of the season on the goal.
During the remainder of the first
half, Stanford gave no ground. The
Cardinal offense began to look even

tougher while the Bronco defense
showed signs of weakening. Cardinal
attackers Amy Geisse, Manda Dunlop
and Stacey Keare threatened to score
repeatedly, but each shot missed nar
rowly.
Stanford Coach Helen Keohane was
happy with the efforts of the team, but
she found it frustrating to see all of the
Cardinal's attempts end in vain. "We
played pretty, but ineffectual,"
Keohane said. "In the first half, we
didn't control the ball well enough in
the attacking one-third of the field."
The game continued in the same
manner during the second half. Stan
ford's defense was put to the test as the
Broncos attacked the goal more ag
gresively.
For 44 out of the 45 minutes in the
second period, the score remained the
same. Tough defense from fullbacks
and midfielders like Beth Egan,
Christine Martin and Christy McDevitt
kept Symons and Vicent at bay.
In the last minute of the game,
however, it was Santa Clara's
twosome combining for another goal.
This time, Symons made the assist, her
seventh of the season, to Vicent, who
slid the ball by goalkeeper Vija Brook
shire.
Though the Cardinal was shut out,
the offensive statistics for Santa Clara
and Stanford were identical: 13 shots
taken on the opposing goal.
