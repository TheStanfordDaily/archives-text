# Big Game Rally will be held
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
Despite insurance difficulties, the Big
Game Rally will roll through the streets of San
Francisco on Nov. 21, according to Axe Com
mittee Chairman Michael Tuchin.
Tuchin said the Axe Committee has secured
a $500,000 liability policy and plans to pur
chase another $500,000 policy this week. San
Francisco requires groups holding marches
to have at least $1 million of coverage.
Other groups have had difficulty obtaining
insurance for similar events, creating
numerous rumors that the Rally would be
cancelled this year, Tuchin said.
Tuchin added that the Stanford Band is re
sponsible for cancellation rumors. "Band
members for some reason have said on
several occasions that there won't be a rally,"
he said.
The parade's route will be about twice as
long as last year, according to Rob Eno, co
director of the Rally. "The biggest complaint
we got was that it was too short last year," he
said."
This year's march will begin at Pier 1 and
go down the wharf to Aquatic Park, Eno said.
Last year the march followed the same path,
but began at Pier 35.
Fireworks will be another new feature of
this year's rally, Tuchin said.

Buses will leave students off at the Ferry
Building at the foot of Market Street near Pier
1, Eno said, and pick them up at Aquatic Park.
Numerous signs at Aquatic Park should
prevent students from missing their buses, he
said.
The San Francisco police refrained from ar
resting Stanford students last year, but accord
ing to Tuchin they will not hesitate to make
arrests this year.
Tuchin warned that Aquatic Park is federal
property. Anyone arrested there will be taken
to a federal jail and have "no possibility" of
being bailed out before Big Game, he said.
Last year there were incidences of people
jumping on police vehicles and fighting, he
said.
Tuchin said the police were especially con
cerned about possible alcohol-related prob
lems. A San Francisco law against the posses
sion of open containers of alcohol in public
effectively bans alcohol from the march.
"One reason we extended the parade route
was so people would spend more time
marching and less time drinking," Tuchin
said. "We're not saying don't drink, we're just
saying drink at the right time," he said, adding
that drinking during the march is dangerous
as well as against the law.
All arrests will be made by the San Fran
cisco police. Stanford takes no responsibility

for the Rally, and Stanford police will not be
involved.
According to Eno, the San Francisco Police
Department has warned the Axe Committee
that the behavior of Stanford students this
year will determine the Rally's future. He said
too many incidents or arrests this year may
cause the city to refuse to grant Stanford a
permit to hold the Rally in the future.
Tuchin estimated that 5,000 to 6,000 people
will attend the Rally. Most will be undergradu
ates, with some graduate students and alumni
mixed in.
The march from Pier 1 will begin at 10 p.m.
and end around midnight, he said.
The Axe Committee has budgeted $3,500
for the Rally, including $1,500 for insurance
and $1,000 for fireworks. The committee's
budget comes from its ASSU fee assesment,
alumni contributions and corporate sponsors,
Tuchin said.
The Axe Committee will also sponsor a
"Big Game Bonfire Rally" in the Lake Lagunita
basin on Thursday night, Nov. 20. Tuchin said
that this year's bonfire rally will be very
similar to last year's, but the bonfire structure
will be "somewhat different."
Following the bonfire, the Axe Committee
and the Graduate Students Association will
co-sponsor a party at Junior's, the soon-to-be
opened student pub in Encina Station.
