# Kennedy discusses initiatives

### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
California's Propositions 61, 63, 64 and 65 have some
thing in common besides the fact that they are all on tomor
row's general election ballot: All of these proposals have
been publicly opposed by University President Donald Ken
nedy.
Kennedy, a registered Democrat, is also listed as part of a
group called "Peninsulans for Chief Justice Rose Bird" in an
advertisement in today's Daily and last week's Palo Alto
Weekly.
Kennedy informed the University Board of Trustees that
he would be taking positions on Propositions 61, 64 and 65
on the November ballot, according to Bob Hamrdla, assis
tant to the president. If passed, proposition 61 would cap
state employee salaries; propostion 64 would make it possi
ble to quarantine AIDS victims; and proposition 65 would
toughen restrictions on toxic discharges into drinking
water.
Local papers have reported that Kennedy is also against
Proposition 63, a measure that would make English the offi
cial state language, but he declined to elaborate on his posi
tion.
Hamrdla said Kennedy's opposition to Proposition 65, the
toxics and drinking water iniative, stemmed from the part of
the proposal that would allow people who turn in polluters
to pocket a share of any fines collected. Hamrdla character
ized this as "a sort of bounty" that would encourage hap
hazard enforcement.
Kennedy, the Chairman of the U.S. Food and Drug Admin
istration under President Carter, also mentioned other
reservations about 65 in a letter to the Palo Alto City Coun
cil.
In the letter, which was read at a council meeting by Uni
versity Director of Community Affairs Andrew Doty, Ken
nedy said a major flaw with the initiative was that it required
dischargers of toxic or cancer-causing chemicals to show
that the material posed "no significant risk" over a lifetime
of exposure and a released toxin would have "no ob
servable effect" at 1,000 times the level in question. "The
findings would be extremely difficult if not impossible to
prove," Kennedy said.
He also told the council that a literal interpretation of
Proposition 65 might cause some difficulties for the Univer
sity, and called the iniative an excellent example of the
hazards of using the initiative process to solve social prob
lems of such complexity and importance. The council voted
to oppose the proposal.
Proposition 61 is the measure that would limit the salaries
of California public employees to 80 percent of the Gover
nor's $80,000 annual pay. Hamrdla said Kennedy was
opposed to the idea because California would then lose its
good public employees to other states.
Hamrdla said Kennedy's opposition to the AIDS initiative,
Proposition 64, really needed no explanation because of its
glaring deficiencies. Kennedy was one of the signatories in a
September anti-64 advertisement sponsored by Scientists
and Citizens Against 64.
The advertisement criticized the initiative as bad public
health policy and also accused backers of Proposition 64 of
misleading the public about how AIDS is spread. Supporters
of Proposition 64 have been linked to political extremist
Lyndon Laßouche.
» Kennedy's stated view on keeping Rose Bird on the bench
is highlighted in an advertisement on that issue in today's
Daily. Kennedy is quoted saying that "the political campaign
against reconfirmation of the Justices is disturbing not only
because of the source and character, but because it sets an
alarming precedent for the electoral
review of decision making in the
courts."
When asked about his support of
Bird, Kennedy said that the position he
had taken was on the issue of "judicial
recall generally, not Rose Bird.
Kennedy admitted that he had been
politically active in other ways this
year, including campaign contribu
tions to "several candidates in several
states." He declined to name the candi
dates he has supported.
