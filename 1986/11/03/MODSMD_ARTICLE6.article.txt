Stanford attorneys have denied
charges by Steven Mosher, former an
thropology doctoral student, that his
professional reputation was damaged
by his 1983 expulsion from Stanford.
The response to Mosher s complaint
was made Wednesday by David
Heilbron of the San Francisco law firm
McCutcheon, Doyle, Brown & Eners.
John Schwartz, vice president and
genentl counsel for the I Jniversity, said
the University was required by law to
respond to Mosher's charges. The case
will now go before the Federal District
Court in San Francisco.
Mosher filed suit against Stanford
University on Sept. 29 seeking dama
ges and reinstatement as a doctoral stu
dent. In 1983, the Anthropology De
partment faculty voted 11-0 to ter
minate Mosher's candidacy for a doc
toral degree in anthropology. The fac
ulty alleged that Mosher engaged in
"illegal and seriously unethical con

duct" while carrying out research in
China in 1979 and 1980.
Among the charges alleged against
him were smuggling, bribing Chinese
officials for government documents
and trespassing.
In his suit, Mosher charged the Uni
versity with slander, breach of contract
and violation of his civil rights. He said
he was expelled for an article he pub
lished in a Taiwanese magazine con
demning Chinese birth-control
policies.
Before filing the lawsuit, Mosher
pursued his case through the Univer
sity appeals process. Following exten
sive internal reviews, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy upheld
Mosher's termination Sept 30, 1985.
Some scholars have blamed Mosher
for a decision by the Chinese to
sharply limit fieldwork by American
social scientists. Mosher was one of the
first American anthropologists permit
ted to do extended field work on a
rural Chinese commune.
