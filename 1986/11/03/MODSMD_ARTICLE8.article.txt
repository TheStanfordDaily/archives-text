# Weil campaigns for Farm votes

### ANDREW PATZMAN Staff writer 
Characterizing his opponent as a
"political dinosaur" who stands
"somewhere to the right of Genghis
Khan," Democratic congressional
candidate Lance Weil urged an audi
ence at Columbae House last night to
"Fight the indifference of the Republi
can Party" on social issues.
Weil, a Cupertino attorney, faces
Republican Assemblyman Ernie Kon
nyu in a race to represent the 12th
Congressional District, which in
cludes Stanford.
Calling preservation of the envi
ronment one of his top concerns,
Weil said he advocates measures to
"keep the seed, soil and water of our
habitat pristine."
Weil called a recent personal en
dorsement of Konnyu by the execu
tive director of the California Wildlife
Federation "a fabrication and a lie."

Referring to the organization as a
"sportsman's lobby," Weil said "the
California Wildlife Federation doesn't
have anything to do with wildlife
other than it likes to kill animals." He
added that the endorsement
represents only the personal opinion
of the director, not the federation it
self.
He accused his opponent of
"doing nothing" to help the environ
ment as a state assemblyman. Weil
said he holds an endorsement from
the Sierra Club, while Konnyu is
backed by several chemical compan
ies. "That gives you an idea where he
stands," Weil said.
Turning to national issues, Weil at
tacked the Strategic Defense Initia
tive, calling President Reagan's space
defense program "technically un
feasable and horrendously expen
sive."
