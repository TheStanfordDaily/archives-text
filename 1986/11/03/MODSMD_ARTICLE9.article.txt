Secret talks won hostage release
WASHINGTON — The release of hostage David Jacobsen and the sud
den hope of freedom for other American captives in Beirut came as the
result of a long series of secret negotiations between the Islamic Jihad kid
nappers and the Reagan administration, which once vowed never to
negotiate with terrorists, U.S. officials said yesterday.
And, despite the administration's insistence that it will never "make a
deal" with the kidnappers, the breakthrough reflected a new willingness
on the part of both Reagan and the terrorists to seek a compromise solu
tion to the two-year-old hostage impasse.
Since July, both sides have sent messages and signals to each other —
some openly, but many through secret channels including Syria, Iran, and
Anglican Church negotiator Terry Waite — suggesting more flexibility than
their public positions implied, officials and terrorism experts said.
At the same time, some sources said, revolutionary Iran appeared to take
an increasing role in pushing for a compromise solution, apparently
hoping to persuade the United States to ease a ban on U.S. weapons sales
for its war with neighboring Iraq.
Although Reagan and his aides once declared flatly that they would never
negotiate with terrorists, that policy has clearly shifted during the past year
— an evolution prompted by the lesson, learned reluctantly in other
hostage crises, that deals are sometimes unavoidable. Today, the adminis
tration says it is willing to negotiate for the release of U.S. hostages if it can
do so without giving in directly to terrorists' demands.
Democrats may retake Senate
WASHINGTON — By targeting regional economic problems and other
local grievances, Democrats have driven to within striking distance of
taking control of the U.S. Senate in tomorrow s midterm election, a vic
tory that would help them regain the political initiative they lost in Presi
dent Reagan's 1980 landslide.
To achieve this long-cherished objective, however, the Democrats must
overcome two bulwarks of Republican defense: a multimillion-dollar ad
vantage in campaign funds and Reagan's last-ditch campaigning.
Reagan has campaigned with even more than his usual energy and par
tisan force, because a Democratic victory in the Senate would almost cer
tainly cost him dearly in the last two years of his presidency.
Democrats claimed to feel relatively confident about gaining
Republican-held seats in three states — Florida, Maryland and Nevada —
while Republicans are just about as sure of picking up one Democratic seat,
in Missouri. That adds up to a net Democrat gain of two.
The implications for the national political future of the struggle for the
Senate are far-reaching. Republican retention of Senate control would help
the president avoid the lame duck label in his last two years in office, and
provide further fuel for the continuing Republican drive to become the na
tion's majority party, particularly when combined with expected GOP gains
in the gubernatorial races.
For the Democrats, winning the Senate would mean control of the Sen
ate's potent committee machinery, allowing them to spend the next two
years challenging Reagan's appointments, certainly including any he might
make to fill Supreme Court vacancies, and also to probe and poke into the
operations of the Reagan administration.
Reagan adds campaign stops
WASHINGTON — In die final days of the 1986 election season, President
Reagan has launched himself into an unprecedented campaign blitz de
signed to turn tommorrow's voting into a referendum on his presidency.
And if that ends up helping Republicans preserve their crucial majority in
the Senate, the GOP may well have the Democrats to thank.
At least the way White House officials tell the tale, it was Democratic
criticism, not Republican strategizing alone that was the catalyst for
Reagan's surge of campaign energy.
Upon his return from the Reykjavik summit meeting with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev three weeks ago, aides say Reagan was stung by the
criticism — even ridicule, as he saw it — being voiced by some Democrats
over his refusal to curtail development of his "Star Wars" space-based
missile defense system in exchange for a U.S.-Soviet agreement on sweep
ing cuts in nuclear weapons.
Opinion polls uniformly showed that most Americans backed Reagan's
handling of the summit and thought it was important to elect members of
Congress who support Star Wars. That convinced White House strategists
that the president should make it an issue. And the potential of Star Wars as
a mobilizing point, coupled with the fact that Democrats were gaining
ground in several close Senate races, persuaded Reagan to beef up his
schedule, which winds up with the president in California on election eve
campaigning for Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos) in his effort to unseat Demo
cratic Sen. Alan Cranston.
The Republican National Committee was so convinced of Star Wars and
the summit as campaign issues that it put out a four-page pamphlet on the
issues. The pamphlet cited several campaign talking points and a poll
showing that Americans approved Reagan's handling of the summit by a 4-1
margin and that 53 percent believed it was important to elect members of
Congress who support Star Wars.
Speakes denies hostage politics
SANTA BARBARA — President Reagan yesterday thanked "the various
parties and intermediaries" who had worked to arrange the release of
hostage David Jacobsen in Lebanon, but he declined to be specific about
who they are, apparently concerned about interfering with the possible
release of five Americans and two Frenchmen still held there.
The White House announcement, coming just two days before critical
congressional elections, prompted speculation that Jacobsen's release was
"the November surprise" Reagan needed to ensure victory for Republican
senatorial candidates tomorrow.
Asked at a briefing here if Reagan would raise the hostage issue in a way
that could benefit Republican candidates, White House spokesman Larry
Speakes responded with a sharp "no."
"You're within one inch of getting your head lopped off with a question
like that," he warned the reporter who asked the question.
When several reporters protested that the question was legitimate given
the timing of Jacobsen's release, Speakes said that Reagan "will certainly
speak with pride" about the happy development as he campaigns today for
GOP Senate candidates Jim Santini in Nevada and Ed Zschau in California.
"But as far as playing politics with it, absolutely not," Speakes declared.
Enrile denies diverting money
MANIIA Philippines — Philippine Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile
"categorically" denied yesterday allegations that he diverted American aid
money and charged that a pending U.S. Department of Justice investigation
into his conduct was "a veiled blackmail scheme" to muzzle him from
criticizing the government of Philippine President Corazon Aquino.
Calling the Department of Justice's allegations "an old story," Enrile
accused the U.S. government of directly interfering in the Philippines' in
ternal affairs, and he declared that he welcomes "any investigation into the
matter in order to clear the name of my family and my office, which have
been clearly slurred by the reports."
Enrile made his comments in a three-page statement issued yesterday in
response to reports that a federal grand jury in San Francisco has begun in
vestigating whether the defense minister and his wife, Cristina, had used
two San Francisco condominiums to launder stolen U.S. aid money.
Enrile served for nearly 20 years in the Cabinet of deposed Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos, whom Mrs. Aquino's government has sued in
Los .Angeles federal court for having allegedly stolen more than $2 billion
in U.S. and Philippine government funds during Marcos two decades in of
fice.
