## Battling Careerism 
### 
Two years ago, a Los Angeles
Times editor came to The Daily for
an informal talk on choosing jour
nalism as a career.
As she began her presentation,
she expressed surprise at the pres
ence of several video-display termi
nals and the absence of
typewriters — in the Daily office.
We didn t have these elaborate
word processors here when I was a
student, she said. "Everything's so
pre-professional now. You write
your articles on computers. You
write your papers for classes on
computers. Don't you guys use
typewriters for anything?"
Sure, replied Daily cartoonist
Mark Wilson. "Cover letters."
A recently released report by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching has noted
the tension between careerism and
liberal arts education on college
campuses.
At Stanford, careerism is winning
out.
It is a problem that has gotten
worse in recent years, the result,
some say, of a dismal economic out
look that has students worried
about finding jobs after graduation.
It is a problem perhaps charac
terized best by a friend who
recently suggested, "Ten years from
now, let's all get together and com
pare incomes."
It is a problem that forces stu
dents to narrow their studies and to
shun activities that they feel will not
help them launch their careers.
Stanford's administration has
fought careerism with a number of
weapons, including wide-ranging
distribution requirements and Resi
dential Education programs. In ad
dition, University President Donald
Kennedy frequently has called on
students to study what interests
them rather than only what they

feel will prepare them for a specific
career.
Despite the University's efforts,
however, Stanford is losing the war
against careerism. The percentage
of students here majoring in the
humanities has remained steady at
about 15 percent over the last five
years.
Following are two ways the Uni
versity could emphasize the ideals
of liberal education over the afflic
tion of pre-professionalism.
First, the University should drop
the freshman English exemption
for students who ace the Advanced
Placement exam — a move the Fac
ulty Senate is considering. It is a
rare student who writes so
smoothly at age 18 that he could not
benefit from at least one quarter of
freshman English. Furthermore, the
course, when taught well, fosters an
appreciation for effective writing
that is at the heart of a liberal educa
tion.
The second suggestion deals with
Western Culture, the freshman core
curriculum that has come under
fire because it focuses exclusively
on European history, literature and
thought.
The administration should ask all
Western Culture section leaders to
assign their students a short essay
on how to reform the program, if
indeed the students determine that
reform Is desirable.
Students in Western Culture
classes have a right to play an active
role in the program's reform.
In addition, bringing more stu
dents into the debate might lead to
attractive alternatives for the Faculty
Senate to consider.
Perhaps students would place a
greater value on education at Stan
ford if they played a part in shaping
it.
