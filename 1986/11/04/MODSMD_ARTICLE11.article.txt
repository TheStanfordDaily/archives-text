Attempted sexual assaults occur near Dish
Two separate attempted sexual assualts, probably
by the same person, occurred around noon last Sat
urday near the radioscience "Dish" in the foothills
west of campus, Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington reported yesterday.
One woman was reading and the other was jog
ging when they were grabbed. Both broke loose and
ran away. One was a Stanford student, the other not.
They described their assailant as a white male in
his late 20s or early 30s, about 5-feet-9 to 6-feet tall, of
medium, thin build. He had light colored, dirty
blond hair, poor facial complexion and possibly a
mustache.
He was wearing a white sleeveless undershirt, blue
jeans and brown shoes. He rode a beat-up green
bicycle with cruiser-type handlebars.
Anyone with further information is encouraged to

Bookstore mails rebates
Some students, faculty and staff can expect to get
checks in the mail this week as the Stanford
Bookstore begins mailing approximately $300,000 in
rebate checks for the 1985-86 school year.

The approximately 8,000 rebate checks are valued
at 15 percent of the total book receipts, including text
and trade books, that were turned into the Bookstore
earlier this year.
Each year people take advantage of the rebate sys
tem in which the Bookstore, a non-profit California
corporation, returns some of its profits to its custom
ers, according to Bookstore Controller Patrick
McDonald.
The Bookstore keeps some profits for normal con
siderations including future improvements and ex
pansion, McDonald said.
Rebates originally were given at the register when
books were purchased. The system was discontinued
for a time, and when it was reinstated, the current
process was adopted.
Students, faculty and staff wishing to get refunds
on books purchased this year must turn their
receipts into the Bookstore spring quarter.
McDonald said other schools throughout the
country have rebate programs using a variety of
means of refunding money.
"The system has been going and has been working
(here at Stanford). I don't foresee any reason why it
would discontinue," McDonald said.

Economists honored at Hoover dinner
James Miller, director of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB), recommended the implementa
tion of "permanent coastitutional solutions ... to
restore the fiscal discipline we had for most of our
history" in order to guarantee a balanced federal
budget and avoid future deficits, during a keynote
speech last Friday at the Hoover Institution.
The growth of government and increased reliance
on deficit financing have led to the current budget
crisis, Miller said. "Our political institutions, as his
torically structured, may not be capable of solving
the problem of need to modify our institutions and
place meaningful constraints on political behavior."
Miller's comments preceded the Domestic Studies
Advisory Board dinner, where special tribute was ac
corded the board's two Nobel laureate economists,
Profs. James Buchanan of George Mason University
and George Stigler of the University of Chicago.
Advisory Board Chairman Stigler was presented
with a first edition copy of a collection of his essays
titled, "The Essence of Stigler," edited by Kurt Leube
and Thomas Moore.
Hoover Senior Fellow Rita Ricardo-Campbell said,
"The volume is a skillful selection of Stigler's prolific
genius.
