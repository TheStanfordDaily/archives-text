## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper The 						Daily endorses: Alan Cranston for U.S. Senate 
### 
This year's U.S. Senate race has unfortunately brought
new meaning to the term "mudslinging" — and both
candidates are dirty. Once the mud is washed off,
however, U.S. Senator Alan Cranston emerges as the bet
ter candidate.
Although both Cranston and his Republican chal
lenger, U.S. Representative Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos), have
proven themselves intelligent, responsive and effective
elected officials, Cranston's three terms of experience in
the Senate give him an edge. His experience could turn
out to be an even bigger asset if the Democrats win con
trol of the Senate and his seniority gains him an impor
tant chairmanship.
His stance on the issues is admirable. He is a staunch
enemy of the current administration's indulgent military
buildup. He believes military aid to the contras in
Nicaragua is bad policy; instead, he proposes more
negotiation with the Sandinistas and trade incentives to
encourage them to adopt a more democratic govern
ment. He led the fight last summer to impose tougher

sanctions against South Africa's apartheid government.
And he is a strong opponent of the death penalty, which
he correctly believes "just doesn't work."
Zschau, on the other hand, has a disturbing habit of
changing his mind on many important issues. Although
flexibilty is often a useful and necessary trait for a U.S.
Senator, Zschau's inconsistency is problematic. His
changes of heart concerning U.S. foreign policy — par
ticularly in the Middle East, South Africa and Central
America — are particularly questionable.
No matter what happens today, however, one loser in
this campaign is already evident: the California voter. It is
not surprising that many voters are becoming disgusted
with the tone of the campaign; at a radio call-in show in
Los Angeles last week, many listeners expressed their
dissatisfaction with the vicious TV commercials Cranston
and Zschau are using against each other.
In fact, one caller said she was planning not to vote as
a protest against the pettiness of the campaign. Certainly,
this is a result neither Cranston nor Zschau intended.
