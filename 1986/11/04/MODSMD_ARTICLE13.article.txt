# Lance Weil for U.S. Congress
## 
### 
In marked contrast to his opponent's disturbingly radi
cal conservatism, Democrat Lance Weil offers voters of
the 12th Congressional District a fresh, progressive
choice.
Weil, a Cupertino attorney, faces Republican As
semblyman Ernie Konnyu in a race to inherit the con
gressional seat being vacated this year by Ed Zschau.
Even for the traditionally Republican 12th District,
Ernie Konnyu stands far to the right of center.
Konnyu, who has characterized Phillipine President
Corazon Aquino as "a dictator," opposes both abortion
and gun control. He has also come out against a compre

hensive nuclear test ban agreement, as well as the SALT
II treaty.
Konnyu has called a balanced budget amendment a
"top priority," yet advocates full funding for SDI and has
said he favors increased aid to the contra rebels.
A solid liberal on most issues, Weil has expressed par
ticular concern for environmental issues and problems
of toxic waste disposal.
He also opposes aid to the contras, favors a test ban
treaty and is pro-choice.
Lance Weil, clearly the more forward-thinking candi
date, deserves to be our next congressman.
