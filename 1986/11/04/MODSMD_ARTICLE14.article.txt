# Tom Bradley for governor
## 
### 
Despite the mudslinging tactics used in California's
gubernatorial race, real issues make Los Angeles Mayor
Tom Bradley a more desirable candidate than incumbent
Gov. George Deukmejian.
Deukmejian's toxic wastes record is abhorrent. Of the
100 cleanups Deukmejian boasts of, many of the sites in
volved were relatively minor and not even half a dozen
were listed among the worst toxic sites in California.
Bradley's administration recently approved a $2.3 billion
budget for toxic cleanup over the next year in Los An
geles.
While Deukmejian has joined in die recent anti-Rose
Bird hysteria, Bradley has refused to get involved in the
effort to inject partisan politics into the judicial system by

ousting Bird from the state Supreme Court. In another
instance of jumping on the hysteria bandwagon, Deuk
mejian vetoed bills that would have prohibited housing
and employment discrimination against people with
AIDS.
If Deukmejian implies that Bradley is insensitive to the
needs of the people, his own duplicity is proven in the
fact that Californians have paid about $2.4 billion more
in taxes and fees since Deukmejian took office. In addi
tion, numerous gubernatorial vetoes have stopped in
itiatives to improve public education by decreasing class
sizes and financing school construction.
Tom Bradley offers hope for a more public-minded
state administration than the current one.
