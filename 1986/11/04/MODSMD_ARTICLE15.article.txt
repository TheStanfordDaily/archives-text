Prop. 63 unfair
Ronald Hilton's viewpoint in favor
of Proposition 63 (Daily, Oct. 30) is
misleading and discriminatory.
First of all, it is a fallacy to identify
those who oppose Proposition 63
solely as Hispanics. In California the
wave of immigrants from non-
Spanish-speaking countries is im
mense. There are large communities
of Chinese, Vietnamese and Laotians,
for example. For that reason, social
services such as 911 and emergency
units provide assistance in those
languages, in addition to Spanish.
Proposition 63 would affect all the
different ethnic groups equally. Thus,
his query — "How many of the
'Hispanics' who oppose it

(Proposition 63) have done their
homework?" — just shows misin
formation and bias.
Second, his assertion that those in
favor of the proposition are "trying to
lower our universities to the level of
those of Latin America," again, only
displays distortion and prejudice. As a
Ph.D. student in education, specializ
ing in higher education in Venezuela,
1 take issue with such a statement.
There are numerous first-class institu
tions of higher education in Latin
America, such as the Simon Bolivar
University, the Technological Institute
of Monterrey and the University of San
Marcos. Universities are centers
of learning and, hence, a high level of
discourse and "rational discussion" of
any subject may be expected.
Third and last, minority groups in

the United States are not puppets
"playing into Moscow's hand," as
Hilton states. On the contrary, they are
self-directed, well-coordinated, politi
cally conscious and hard working
people who value the opportunities
and freedom available to them here.
To conclude, I will say that neither
the language nor Proposition 63 is the
issue that is going to cause divisive
ness in California and ultimately,
according to Hilton, in the United
States. It Is the existence of people
like him, encouraging fanaticism and
intolerance against a specific group,
that will impede coexistence and
harmonious relations among the
different ethnic and cultural groups in
the United States.
