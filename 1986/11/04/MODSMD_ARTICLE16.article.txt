# Anti-nukes still working in Britain

I arrived in Britain this summer to find the conser
vative press gloating that the British peace movement
was withering away. The days of massive protests and
mass arrests for civil disobedience were past, and —
so the conservative press claimed — only "a handful
of tired old lesbians" remained at the famous Green
ham Common Women's Peace Encampment where,
only a few years ago, the women outside the gates
outnumbered the soldiers within. Margaret Thatcher

had brought 96 cruise missiles to Britain in spite of
the 100,000 people who demonstrated against them
in Trafalgar Square, in spite of the 30,000 women
who "embraced" the U.S. Air Force base at Green
ham Common in December 1982 and in spite of the
thousands of arrests for civil disobedience preceding
the missile deployments. Now that the deed was
done and the uselessness of opposition proven, the
swell of resistance was calm.
There is a certain distorted truth to this account in
the press. The British Campaign for Nuclear Disarma
ment (CND) is no longer organizing the heroically
massive demonstrations and arrests which
punctuated the desperate months before the deploy
ment of the cruise missiles, and the women's peace
encampment is now a shadow of its former self —
though the women who remain (all ages and not all
lesbians) are as determined and visionary as ever.
However, the CND is far from withering away. It is
just finding new ways to press its case Its member
ship has barely dipped from its peak in 1983-84. The
mass commitment to the issue and the organization
remain, but energy has shifted from the con
spicuously dramatic protests of the past toward edu
cational consolidation and grass roots educational ac

tivities. Above all, the movement is rehearsing for the
next election, which CND hopes will prove to be the
final showdown with nuclear Thatcherism.
CND's hopes are not unwarranted. Six years of
CND lobbying and campaigning have finally restored
radical vigor to the Labor Party's defense policy, and
the most recent opinion poll in early October
showed the Labor Party and its widely respected
leader Neil Kinnock leading Thatcher's Conservatives
by four percentage points. It is quite likely that the
I,abor Party will soon become the party of govern
ment. What exactly would that mean?
A Labor victory would rupture the fabric of the
global arms race and deal the U.S. policy of neo
colonialism in Europe a rude blow, since the Labor
Party is committed to:

Anti-nuclear activists in
Britain are finding new
ways to press their case.

• Cancel Thatcher's 12-billion-pound order for
several nuclear-capable Trident submarines.
• Phase out Britain's existing nuclear-armed Polaris
submarines.
• Send all cruise missiles back to the United States
(This could influence the Dutch and Belgian govern
ments to reverse their recent fragile and divisive
decisions to accept cruise misiles).
• Halt Britain's nuclear testing program in the
Nevada desert.
• Commence the phasing out of nuclear energy.
In sum, the ascendance of the Labor Party would
make Britain the first country in history to effect a

process of nuclear disarmament in the hope that
such an independent initiative would encourage
other nations to reduce or eliminate their nuclear
weapons.
The British Labor Party now believes that nuclear
weapons, since they are unusable, bring no military
advantage and, because they make Britain a target for
a possible pre-emptive strike, may actually make Brit
ain less secure. It also believes that the deployment
of cruise missiles on British soil but under American
control has stripped Britain of its sovereignty, and
that the arms race is sapping the vitality of the British
economy.
Two years ago, only 25 percent of the British elec
torate agreed. The latest opinion polls now show that
about 40 percent of the British people support
British disarmament as an independent initiative in
de-escalating the global arms race and restoring
humane economic priorities. The proportion of the
British people who support the CND/Labor Party
point of view is continually increasing.
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has, then,
undergone a process of evolution from a movement
of spectacular but, sadly, ineffective grassroots
protest to a movement which — through persistent
questioning of its opponents, serious debate and or
ganizational stamina — has partly shifted the weight
of public opinion on the arms race and has rein
vigorated the part of opposition, giving it a bold and
imaginative position to stand for. This party of oppo
sition may soon become the party of government.
Maybe there is a moral in this tale for Americans as
they contemplate their own elections today and in
1988.
