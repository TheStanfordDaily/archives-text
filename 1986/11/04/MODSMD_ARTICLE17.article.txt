# Commence a controversy
## 
### 
The other night I was in Meyer reading through all last
year's Dailies, trying to trace the development of various
campus issues that were significant to the Stanford commu
nity at the time. In the process 1 discovered two important
facts: First, any fool can start a campus controversy with a
little effort. Second, he should be encouraged to do so.
Now of course, there's a problem with these so-called
"controversies": An issue is only significant when most of
the campus knows about it (i.e., it gets coverage in The Daily
or the Real News or one of the two or three other well-read
campus publications). That's the thing about important is
sues around here — there are so few places from which one
can hear about them. This gives rise to the fact that anyone
with the will to get printed can create an issue.
The most recent example of this is the flap over the
"Women of Stanford" calendar. If you've paged through it at
the Bookstore, you've probably discovered what I found to
be its most interesting aspect: It's not interesting. What the
heck would anyone want a photo gallery of 12 more or less
identical Stanford coeds for anyway? Cheap thrills? No, I
don't think so.
Getting back to the point, however, it seems likely to me
that this calendar could have just sat unloved in the half-

price stack for a few months ... had it not been for a Daily
columnist writing a diatribe over the implications of the
calendar. This brought a week's worth of pro and con mail
to The Daily — all over a piece of merchandise that could
very well have faded into oblivion without anyone noticing.
Not so sure one letter can fire people up? Think about last
year: One letter from a graduate student, containing only
242 words, set off a bitter tirade over the supposed racism of
the COP's new constitution. That's right — four small
paragraphs set off one of the ugliest mudslinging press
battles in recent history. In one week, this resulted in view
points by two members of the COP, a Daily editorial, a letter
by a collection of Third World representatives and several
other letters. While the controversy was short-lived, it must
be noted that one person, possibly with one piece of paper,
started the whole thing.
Admittedly, not all controversies are short-lived, nor are
they exclusively started through an editorial in the newspa
per. Some campus issues, such as Stanford's position in
South Africa or The Daily's occasional attacks on fraternities,
are more or less perpetual. They just rise and subside in
day-to-day prominence on a long-term basis. And individual
action can also start people thinking, with building a
campus shantytown or revoking a fraternity's recognition
being good examples.
It's important to note that the end effect of a campus con
troversy is that it forces people to rethink (or, I fear, to con
sider for the first time) their stand on an issue. Last year,
when several of the shanties were vandalized, students were
forced to re-evaluate die role of racism on campus, and it
eventually led to a forum on the topic. It's not a nice thing to
admit, but students usually don't think too much about non-

prominent issues; there's enough to worry about with
grades, friends, careers, parties, etc. If the only way to get
everyone to consider these issues is for the issues to
become massively inflated, then (and I hope this isn't need
lessly anarchic) we ought to promote this variety of mini
hysteria.
In other words, if you feel strongly about an issue, you
should speak your mind on it and thereby force others to
reconsider their views. In the context of intentionally creat
ing campus controversy, which we have to assume is good
to have, here are some ideas on how to be more effective.
First, speak your mind and don't worry about being
vague. Readers will be more interested if they misperceive
your statements to be of a more radical nature. The more of
a rise you get out of the reader, the more effective your ef
forts will be. Like I said, don't worry about being vague; the
afore-mentioned letter of that graduate student claims: "If
this new constitution had been in effect in the past, there
would never have been a single black graduate student
elected." In fact, this is the third sentence of the letter ..
seemingly early for conclusions or assertions. The statement
isn't supported anywhere else, showing the ability of
evidence-free exposition to bring about campus concern.
Second, don't worry about generating opposing view
points. This is good. If readers see that two parties are
writing diatribes at one another, they'll try to figure out
what's being discussed, and (hopefully) determine their
own positions. This is along the same lines as thesis-an
thesis-synthesis; if someone writes "hate mail" in
response to your opinion, a third party (in fact, many third
parties) will formulate their own thoughts on the matter.
Sure, you shouldn't have to force people to think for them
selves, but that's just the way life is.
Finally, try always to give a damn about issues you come
across. If you think about it, anyone who meets Dean Jean's
criteria can waltz through Stanford in four years and get a
degree without noticing what goes on in the surrounding
campus community. Tha point is that you should care, be
cause if you don't make your voice heard, the "other guys"
are going to screw things up. If you don't fix the world
you're in, maybe no one else will (yes, there's an analogy to
the "real world" to be noticed here).
In summary, keep abreast of what's going on at Stanford,
and if you feel strongly enough to write a letter to a campus
publication about it, try intentionally to start a controversy
by stating your case, being vague and not worrying about
possible responses. Sure, it seems awkward and unsensible,
but it really isn't. Controversy is good.
