# Stanford praises critical study of universities
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
A study blasting die structure and goals of un
dergraduate education at the nation's colleges
and universities drew praise yesterday from
several members of the Stanford administra
tion.
The report, released Saturday by the Car
negie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching, states that "the undergraduate col
lege, the very heart of higher learning, is a
troubled institution. Driven by careerism and
overshadowed by graduate and professional
education, many of the nation's colleges and
universities are more successfull in credential
ing than in providing a quality education for
their students."
The 242-page report, entitled "College: The
Undergraduate Experience in America," goes

on to note "eight points of tension" facing un
dergraduate institutions today, including the
goals and curriculum of education and the
priorities of faculty involved in teaching and re
search.
Among the report's 83 recommendations are
calls for universities to develop an "integrated
core" curriculum that would cut across specific
academic disciplines and for research univer
sities such as Stanford to place an equal empha
sis on teaching and research in tenure and
promotion considerations.
University President Donald Kennedy, who
read excerpts of the study in The New York
Times, said the report "points to some real
problems with respect to undergraduate educa
tion."
"My sense of the criticisms is that we ought to
pay a lot of attention to them," Kennedy said,
adding that universities must seriously examine

the report and their own institutions rather
than taking a defensive approach to the study.
Kennedy said the University has "already
identified" and begun working on several areas
noted in the report, including increasing inde
pendent study opportunities for undergradu
ates and improving residential education.
The report was critical of intellectual life in
university residences, noting "a great separa
tion, sometimes to the point of isolation, be
tween academic and social life on campus....
What is being learned in most residence halls
today has little connection to the classrooms;
indeed, it may undermine the educational
purposes of the college."
Alice Supton, assistant dean of residential
education, was unavailable for comment yester
day.
Kennedy also said the University is making
efforts to insure that a broad curriculum is

available to students, noting Stanford's distribu
tion requirements.
Carolyn Lougee, dean of undergraduate
studies, agreed with Kennedy on the report's
pertinence to universities throughout the
country.
"Everything I've read seems to be right on
target," Lougee said, noting that she read news
paper accounts of the report Sunday.
Lougee said that careerism and over
specialization by students is a fact at Stanford
but said that economic and demographic
forecasts, not students and professors, are re
sponsible for the trend toward careerism.
"It is not clear that the economy is growing
fast enough to accommodate [today's college]
generation," Lougee said, noting that such
predictions put added pressure on students.
They feel "pressured to get something con
crete and focused and useful that they can apply

in their lives," she said.
"Those are characteristics that are brought to
the universities by students and not created by
educational programs at universities," Lougee
said, adding that "you can't fault universities for
creating those issues."
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo agreed
with Lougee's assertion that careerism exists
among Stanford students.
"More and more students come not to be ed
ucated, but to be prepared for particular
courses," he said, noting that students focus
"too early on a very specific career."
University Provost James Rosse, however,
said that overspecialization and careerism exist
at Stanford only to a limited extent.
"There's been a slight movement in that di
rection among students, but (it is) not very
