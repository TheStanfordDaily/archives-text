## Chappie head helps poke fun at USA Today 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
USA Today, that trendy, factoid-filled
tabloid that bills itself as "The Nation's
Newspaper," is facing some serious
competition at newsstands across the
country.
The rival newspaper is shamelessly
imitative and comes complete with
handy graphs, full-color pictures,
stories shorter than Mickey Rooney
and news from all 50 states. It even
calls itself "USA Today."
And Josh Weinstein, the editor of the
Stanford Chaparral, worked for it over
the summer.
Obviously, this rival of USA Today is
different. In fact, it's not really a com
petitor at all — it's the Harvard Lam
poon's parody of "The Nation's News
paper."
Weinstein, who attended high
school with Lampoon Editor Bill Oak
ley, is listed in the parody as the
"Stanford Humor Exchange Editor."
Weinstein's involvement in the proj
ect began last July, when he traveled to
Cambridge to visit Oakley. According
to Oakley, "It was kind of a spontan
eous thing. Josh didn't have a job for
the summer — as usual," so he asked
Weinstein to help with the USA Today
parody.
Normally, only Harvard students can
work for the Lampoon. Allowing
Weinstein to work for the nation's
oldest humor magazine meant a break
from tradition.
"We made an exception for Josh,"
Oakley says."And it turned out that
Josh is such a good writer, we were
happy to have him."
Weinstein and others working on
the parody met daily to work on the
issue. After it was agreed upon that
USA Today would be the target of the
parody — "I think someone's dad
might've suggested it," Oakley says —
editors and writers often worked late
into the night, brainstorming, writing
and rewriting.
Weinstein says he was happy to be
involved in the project. "It was a lot of
fun," he says, noting he is pleased with
the satire's success — both nationally
and locally.
According to Oakley, the parody is
selling "really well. It's on its way to
becoming a collector's item." On Sept.
15, 750,000 copies of the parody were

released, and it has already sold out in
a number of major cities. It also sold
out quickly at the Store, and, at last
check, Kepler's had only a few left.
"Even Ronald Reagan ordered 30
copies," Weinstein notes.
In addition, some of the other dozen
or so students who wrote the parody
have been featured on many national
TV and radio programs, including
NBC's "Today Show" and ABC's "Good

Morning America." The writers have
also been the guests of honor at
several parties thrown by USA Today.
However, Weinstein says the parties
didn't always go exactly as planned.
One was at the USA Today corporate
headquarters near Washington, D.C.
There were a lot of governmental offi
cials at that fete, Weinstein says. "They
said, 'My, you kids are really quite
something else.' They didn't want to
talk to us silly kids," Weinstein recalls.

At another reception in New York
City, Weinstein and his co-editors were
not allowed in the restaurant because
they were underage. According to
Weinstein, the USA Today brass felt so
bad they offered the students an open
tab at a nearby cafe.
"We loved it," Weinstein says. "We
sat around and ordered champagne for
all the other tables."
But Oakley and Weinstein are quick
to mention the initial and ongoing

cooperation their project received
from USA Today.
"They (USA Today executives) were
really helpful," Weinstein says. USA
Today staffers offered advice about
everything from typesetting to page
design, Oakley says.
According to Weinstein, the parody
is on its way to becoming one of the
fastest-selling parodies in humor his

tory.
"This is only a hypothesis," he says
in trying to account for the publica
tion's success, "but we think it has
more jokes per page than any other
parody ever." He estimates the paper
contains about 10,000 jokes.
The parody certainly has its share of
funny moments. One front-page story
reports that Princess Diana and Prince
Charles are filing for divorce — "1 will
not live under the shadow of my ex
husband," Princess Di is quoted as
saying. "Especially not the shadow of
his gigantic nose."
The Sports section has a story reveal
ing the secret of the New Yorks Mets'
success: Manager Davey Johnson
threatens opposing players at gun
point. The USA Today Top 25 college
football teams include such perennial
pigskin powerhouses as the College of
Cardinals, Electoral College and
(surprise!) Harvard.
The Life section of the paper gives
the details of God's proposal to Jessica
Lange, profiles of some Elvis imper
sonator impersonators and a review of
the movie "Star Trek 4: Attack of the
Rattlesnake."

In the Financial section of the paper,
a panel of experts wrestles with the
question of whether the national debt
is higher than a bread box. The report
of the performance of the Dow Jones
industrial average is similarly whimsi
cal. The average is reported to have
"started off with a slight dip,
rebounded and caromed off a metal
girder, then plummeted to the floor."
USA Today, however, might have the
last laugh. The paper's advertisement
in the parody, which occupies the last
page, warns the editors of the Harvard
Lampoon: "When you get your
sheepskin, don't call us — we'll call
you."

parody ever." He estimates the paper
contains about 10,000 jokes.
The parody certainly has its share of
funny moments. One front-page story
reports that Princess Diana and Prince
Charles are filing for divorce — "1 will
not live under the shadow of my ex
husband," Princess Di is quoted as
saying. "Especially not the shadow of
his gigantic nose."
The Sports section has a story reveal
ing the secret of the New Yorks Mets'
success: Manager Davey Johnson
threatens opposing players at gun
point. The USA Today Top 25 college
football teams include such perennial
pigskin powerhouses as the College of
Cardinals, Electoral College and
(surprise!) Harvard.
The Life section of the paper gives
the details of God's proposal to Jessica
Lange, profiles of some Elvis imper
sonator impersonators and a review of
the movie "Star Trek 4: Attack of the
Rattlesnake."

In the Financial section of the paper,
a panel of experts wrestles with the
question of whether the national debt
is higher than a bread box. The report
of the performance of the Dow Jones
industrial average is similarly whimsi
cal. The average is reported to have
"started off with a slight dip,
rebounded and caromed off a metal
girder, then plummeted to the floor."
USA Today, however, might have the
last laugh. The paper's advertisement
in the parody, which occupies the last
page, warns the editors of the Harvard
Lampoon: "When you get your
sheepskin, don't call us — we'll call
you."

Chaparral editor
USA Today, that trendy, factoid-filled
tabloid that bills itself as "The Nation's
Newspaper," is facing some serious
competition at newsstands across the
country.
The rival newspaper is shamelessly
imitative and comes complete with
handy graphs, full-color pictures,
stories shorter than Mickey Rooney
and news from all 50 states. It even
calls itself "USA Today."
And Josh Weinstein, the editor of the
Stanford Chaparral, worked for it over
the summer.
Obviously, this rival of USA Today is
different. In fact, it's not really a com
petitor at all — it's the Harvard Lam
poon's parody of "The Nation's News
paper."
Weinstein, who attended high
school with Lampoon Editor Bill Oak
ley, is listed in the parody as the
"Stanford Humor Exchange Editor."
Weinstein's involvement in the proj
ect began last July, when he traveled to
Cambridge to visit Oakley. According
to Oakley, "It was kind of a spontan
eous thing. Josh didn't have a job for
the summer — as usual," so he asked
Weinstein to help with the USA Today
parody.
Normally, only Harvard students can
work for the Lampoon. Allowing
Weinstein to work for the nation's
oldest humor magazine meant a break
from tradition.
"We made an exception for Josh,"
Oakley says."And it turned out that
Josh is such a good writer, we were
happy to have him."
Weinstein and others working on
the parody met daily to work on the
issue. After it was agreed upon that
USA Today would be the target of the
parody — "I think someone's dad
might've suggested it," Oakley says —
editors and writers often worked late
into the night, brainstorming, writing
and rewriting.
Weinstein says he was happy to be
involved in the project. "It was a lot of
fun," he says, noting he is pleased with
the satire's success — both nationally
and locally.
According to Oakley, the parody is
selling "really well. It's on its way to
becoming a collector's item." On Sept.
15, 750,000 copies of the parody were

released, and it has already sold out in
a number of major cities. It also sold
out quickly at the Store, and, at last
check, Kepler's had only a few left.
"Even Ronald Reagan ordered 30
copies," Weinstein notes.
In addition, some of the other dozen
or so students who wrote the parody
have been featured on many national
TV and radio programs, including
NBC's "Today Show" and ABC's "Good

Morning America." The writers have
also been the guests of honor at
several parties thrown by USA Today.
However, Weinstein says the parties
didn't always go exactly as planned.
One was at the USA Today corporate
headquarters near Washington, D.C.
There were a lot of governmental offi
cials at that fete, Weinstein says. "They
said, 'My, you kids are really quite
something else.' They didn't want to
talk to us silly kids," Weinstein recalls.

At another reception in New York
City, Weinstein and his co-editors were
not allowed in the restaurant because
they were underage. According to
Weinstein, the USA Today brass felt so
bad they offered the students an open
tab at a nearby cafe.
"We loved it," Weinstein says. "We
sat around and ordered champagne for
all the other tables."
But Oakley and Weinstein are quick
to mention the initial and ongoing

cooperation their project received
from USA Today.
"They (USA Today executives) were
really helpful," Weinstein says. USA
Today staffers offered advice about
everything from typesetting to page
design, Oakley says.
According to Weinstein, the parody
is on its way to becoming one of the
fastest-selling parodies in humor his

tory.
"This is only a hypothesis," he says
in trying to account for the publica
tion's success, "but we think it has
more jokes per page than any other
parody ever." He estimates the paper
contains about 10,000 jokes.
