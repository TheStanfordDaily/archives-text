# Chaparral-Lampoon joint effort in works
## 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
Stanford Chaparral Editor
Josh Weinstein's summer job as
a contributor to the Harvard
Lampoon's USA Today parody
may have a delayed benefit for
Weinstein and his Chaparral
comrades. That initial Chaparral-
Lampoon interaction may lead
to a joint project by the two
humor magazines in the near
future, according to Weinstein.
"Right now, we're trying to
put together a joint issue that
would come out sometime next
spring," he says.
Lampoon Editor Bill Oakley
reports that the prospects for
such a project "are looking
good."
The collaboration would be
the first between the two
magazines in about 50 years.
Weinstein says such coopera
tion between collegiate humor
magazines used to be com
monplace, but because many
magazines have folded in the
past decade or so, joint issues
have become rare. According to
Weinstein, there are only a
handful of collegiate humor
magazines left in the United
States.
For many years, he says, the
Lampoon and Chaparral had
little contact.
However, when Oakley
became editor of the Lampoon,
collaboration between the two
magazines became a distinct
possibility. Oakley and
Weinstein were co-founders and
editors of their high school humor
magazine, the "Alban Antic" of St. Al
bans School in Washington, D.C.
And Weinstein's experience this
summer gave him a taste of the Lam
poon's style, which he describes as "a
little more literary" than the Chapar
ral's. On the whole, though, he says the
two magazines share a similar style and
sense of humor.
"A lot of times, the guys (with whom
he worked at the Lampoon) would

look at the Chaparral and say, 'That's
funnier than our stuff,' " Weinstein
says.
In addition, the Chaparral's new
found financial stability makes the "bi
coastal" issue a more realistic possibil
ity.
The Chaparral's last issue was very
successful, according to Weinstein,
who says the magazine "made its first
big profit in years â€” certainly bigger
than I could ever hold in my wallet."
With the increased cash flow, the
Chaparral may even branch out into
other media, Weinstein says. Currently,
Chappie editors are looking into the
possibility of producing a humor show
on SUNet or perhaps a smaller parody.
