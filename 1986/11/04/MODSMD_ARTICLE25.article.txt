# The 						news on Bay Area papers
## 
### ELAINE LISSNER 
Perhaps you've seen fliers around campus ask
ing for El Salvador earthquake aid, and wondered
"What earthquake?" Perhaps Libya could shoot
down a French plane without your ever knowing
about it. Perhaps you've felt at times that the news
paper you read isn't telling both sides of a story. If
so, you're probably ready for some new news.
Most Stanford students may read The Daily and
perhaps glance at the San Francisco Chronicle,
which is fine for keeping up with national
headlines and campus news. However, being so
minimally informed can get frustrating.
Bob Beyers, director of Stanford News Service,
says, "It's important for individuals to have diverse
sources of information — that's one of the great,
great strengths of democracy. (The newspapers)
keep each other honest."
Beyers knows what he's talking about. Not only
does he keep up with fifty magazines, but each day
he reads The New York Times, the San Jose Mer
cury News, the Wall Street Journal, the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times
(roughly in that order), plus The Daily.
For those students who are looking for balanced
news but who don't have time to read six papers,
following is this reporter's guide to news sources
available in the Bay Area.
• The New York Times: A great paper with great
delivery service. Its depth and objectivity are the
standards against which all American papers are
measured, and its opinions and letters section is al
ways provocative. You may need a handcart to get
the hefty Sunday Times home, but it's worth the
strain for the New York Times Magazine, the Arts
and Leisure and Travel sections and the Book
Review.
• The San Jose Mercury News: Traditionally looked
to for Bay Area news, especially coverage of busi
ness, computers and the Silicon Valley, as well as
solid international and national reporting. In addi
tion, the Mercury has two pages of comics, includ
ing all the favorites, every day.
• The San Francisco Chronicle: Easy-to-read and
user-friendly, the Chronicle is known for its inter

esting columnists and editorials as well as for its
popular Sunday edition, while also boasting the
Bay Area's finest (and greenest) sports section.
• The Wall Street Journal: For financial news, in
depth general news and a bit more conservative
viewpoint to balance your other sources, the Jour
nal is the place to go.
• The Palo Alto Times Tribune: Lots of local flavor

and coverage of Stanford happenings
and how they relate to the rest of the world.
• Sunset Magazine: "The Magazine of the West," as
Sunset bills itself, is the place to go for information
on festivals, concerts, bike tours and other events
not to be missed on the West Coast. If you need to
get away for the weekend, you'll find lots of ideas
in Sunset.
• The Palo Alto Weekly: This newspaper will tell
you everything that's going on in Palo Alto, as well
as cluing you in on the best places to shop, eat
and party in Palo Alto. The movie review section of
the Weekly is the most helpful of any area paper's.

The want ad section is worth a look, too.
• Campus Report: An interesting overview of the
week's news on the Stanford campus, with espe
cially good coverage of the Medical Center.
News-hungry students will find these various
periodicals surprisingly easy to obtain. The Store
in Tresidder Union has almost all the papers listed

here. Mac's Smoke Shop (534 Emerson, downtown
Palo Alto) has an eye-opening array of papers and
magazines as well as an atmosphere that's right out
of Norman Rockwell. Printer's Inc. (310 California
Avenue, Palo Alto) has a wide selection of interna
tional papers as well. Kepler's Bookstore (821 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park) carries 29 different
newspapers, 12 book review magazines and over
300 magazines.
Perhaps the best (or at least most affordable)
route to take is to get one's dorm to subscribe to
newspapers and magazines that a lot of people
want to read.
