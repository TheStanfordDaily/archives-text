### EVAN TUCHIN SKY Staff writer 
Garfield couldn't have overcome a
more demanding and discouraging
Monday than the Stanford cross
country teams faced as they battled ob
stacles for third place finishes in the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships
held at the Stanford golf course yester
day.

"We ran tough but we didn't run fast,
as paradoxical as that seems," Stanford
Coach Brooks Johnson said. "I'm very
pleased with the competitive effort."
The men's squad finished surpris
ingly well despite a few major prob
lems, finishing in third place, just two
points behind Oregon. Arizona took
the Pac-10 crown for the third time in
four years, after losing the title to Stan
ford last year.
Individually, the Cardinal recorded
some tough performances. Marc
Olesen, the defending Pac-10 cham
pion, finished the 10,000-meter race
third in 30:42.6. Arizona runners Aaron
Ramirez and Chris Morgan combined
for an effective one-two punch, taking
first and second with times of 30:23.7
and 30:27.1, respectively.

Senior Ryan Stoll once again estab
lished himself as one of the top cross
country runners in the conference by
finishing in 10th place with a time of
30:59 5. Stoll placed fourth in 1985
with a 30:57.8 clocking.
Charles Alexander, another Stanford
senior, finished in 32:00.8 to round out
the top 20. Junior Steve Schadler
crossed the finish line in 23rd place
out of the 64 finishers in 32:10.8
Problems beset two of the other
Stanford runners. The warm morning
worked against the efforts of the run
ners, as sophomore James Alborough
and freshman Eric Mastalir fell prey to
the ravages of heat prostration.
"Eric ran a good race," teammate
Stoll said. "He was 15th until the last
mile, and then he fell apart." Mastalir
had to be taken off the course, but his
brother and teammate Mark finished
the race in 33:43.7.
Alborough managed to finish in
32:04.5 for 22nd place.
"What could go wrong had to go
wrong, just like what had to go right
went right last year," Johnson said.
"However, despite the disasters, we
finished high.
"I'm disappointed, but not dis
couraged or disillusioned," he added.
The Stanford women's team also
competed well, placing third with 84
points. Oregon copped first with 61
points, duplicating its success in the
NorPac conference last year, and UCLA
repeated its Pac-West finish by taking
the silver with 78.
Yesterday marked the first women's
cross country championship including
the entire Pac-10, and the competition
from all of the schools rose for the oc
casion.
Once again, freshman Carol Gray

led the Stanford squad with her third
place finish, giving Stanford a sweep of
the bronze. Gray finished the 5,000-
meter course in 16:58.0, less than
seven seconds behind the leader.
Oregon's Penny Graves took the
gold in 16:51.7, while Laurie Chapman
from IJCLA completed the race in
16:56.0 for second.
Junior Kathy Smith was the Card
inal's other finisher in the top 10 with
her 17:36.0 time. Smith placed 11th in
the Pac-West in 1985.

All three of the remaining runners
finished in the top 30 in a field of 62.
Schubert, junior captain of the
Cardinal, ran the course in 17:51.9 for
16th place. Schubert has returned to
cross country competition after injur
ies forced her to redshirt last year.
Sophomores Kim Stevens and
Christa Curtin rounded out Stanford's
effort with times of 18:13.9 and 18:14.7
for 27th and 28th, respectively. Stevens
was the 12th place finisher in the 1985
Pac-West championships. Curtin, like

Schubert, returned this year after an
injury-ridden '85 season.
Johnson said he was relatively
satisfied with the team's performance.
"The women have reached parity with
the men," he said. "Now we have to
move up.
"The men have a good team, and the
women have a potentially good team. 1
am confident about our ability level
and feel good about our competition,"
Johnson added.
Stoll concurred. "We are in a posi

tion to accomplish our goals for the
season," he said. "Obviously winning
the Pac-lOs was one of them, but we're
in a good position for the NCAAs, and
that's what's more important."
The cross country teams have almost
completed their seasons, with only the
District 8 championships, Nov. 15 in
Fresno, and the NCAA championships,
Nov. 24 in Tuscon, remaining. "One
down and two more to go," remarked
Johnson. "We are poised and definitely
in a position to advance."
