# Bears downed by Rams, 20-17 Lansford makes 50-yard kick with :04 left
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Mike Lansford's
50 yard field goal with four seconds
remaining last night lifted the Los An
geles Rams to a 20-17 National Football
League victory over the Chicago Bears.
It was Lansford's longest field goal of
the season and gave the Rams the vic
tory despite a woeful 6-for-25 perfor
mance by quarterback Steve Dils.
The game was a rematch of last
year's National Football Conference
championship game which the Bears
won 24-0 on the way to the Super Bowl
championship.
The teams erupted for four touch
downs in the third quarter with
seldom used running back Thomas
Sanders bolting for touchdown runs of
10 and 34 yards to give the Bears a 17-
10 lead. The Rams tied it on 65-yard
scoring pass from Dils to Ron Brown
with 128 left in the third period.
Backup quarterbacks Steve Fuller of
the Bears and Dils of the Rams were
unable to get either offense rolling un
til the game broke open in the third
quarter.
Fuller was making his second start of
the season in place of Jim McMahon,
who has an injured right shoulder Dils
got his third starting assignment,
replacing veteran Steve Bartkowski.

The Bears took a 3-0 lead on Kevin
Butler's 30-yard field goal in the first
quarter, and the Rams tied it on
Lansford's 26-yard field goal with 9:45
left in the third quarter.
Midway through the period,
Chicago's Maury Buford, facing a heavy
rush, was unable to get off a punt and
fumbled the ball. I-eßoy Irvin scooped
up the loose ball and returned it 22
yards for a touchdown to give the Rams
a 10-3 lead.
Dennis Gentry returned the ensuing
kickoff 84 yards to the Ram 15-yard
line. After Calvin Thomas' 5-yard run,
Sanders went 10 yards for the tying
score.
Chicago then converted a Los An
geles turnover into a 17-10 lead. Gary
Fencik intercepted a Dils pass and
returned 24 yards to the Rams' 34. On
the first Chicago play, Sanders broke
free along the right sideline for a
touchdown.
Fencik s interception was the 3" T th of
his career, tying the Bear record held
by Richie Petitboiv
Dils, who had completed his first
pass and then failed on his next 13,
hooked up with Brown on a 65-yard
scoring pass play to pull Los Angeles
into a tie with 128 left in the third

quarter.
Fuller, who completed nine of 19
passes for 102 yards but was inter
cepted twice, was yanked in the third
quarter in favor of Mike Tomczak. The
Bears lost Walter Payton in the same

remaining last night lifted the Los An
geles Rams to a 20-17 National Football
League victory over the Chicago Bears.
It was Lansford's longest field goal of
the season and gave the Rams the vic
tory despite a woeful 6-for-25 perfor
mance by quarterback Steve Dils.
The game was a rematch of last
year's National Football Conference
championship game which the Bears
won 24-0 on the way to the Super Bowl
championship.
The teams erupted for four touch
downs in the third quarter with
seldom used running back Thomas
Sanders bolting for touchdown runs of
10 and 34 yards to give the Bears a 17-
10 lead. The Rams tied it on 65-yard
scoring pass from Dils to Ron Brown
with 128 left in the third period.
Backup quarterbacks Steve Fuller of
the Bears and Dils of the Rams were
unable to get either offense rolling un
til the game broke open in the third
quarter.
Fuller was making his second start of
the season in place of Jim McMahon,
who has an injured right shoulder Dils
got his third starting assignment,
replacing veteran Steve Bartkowski.

The Bears took a 3-0 lead on Kevin
Butler's 30-yard field goal in the first
quarter, and the Rams tied it on
Lansford's 26-yard field goal with 9:45
left in the third quarter.
Midway through the period,
Chicago's Maury Buford, facing a heavy
rush, was unable to get off a punt and
fumbled the ball. I-eßoy Irvin scooped
up the loose ball and returned it 22
yards for a touchdown to give the Rams
a 10-3 lead.
Dennis Gentry returned the ensuing
kickoff 84 yards to the Ram 15-yard
line. After Calvin Thomas' 5-yard run,
Sanders went 10 yards for the tying
score.
Chicago then converted a Los An
geles turnover into a 17-10 lead. Gary
Fencik intercepted a Dils pass and
returned 24 yards to the Rams' 34. On
the first Chicago play, Sanders broke
free along the right sideline for a
touchdown.
Fencik s interception was the 3" T th of
his career, tying the Bear record held
by Richie Petitboiv
Dils, who had completed his first
pass and then failed on his next 13,
hooked up with Brown on a 65-yard
scoring pass play to pull Los Angeles
into a tie with 128 left in the third

quarter.
Fuller, who completed nine of 19
passes for 102 yards but was inter
cepted twice, was yanked in the third
quarter in favor of Mike Tomczak. The
Bears lost Walter Payton in the same
