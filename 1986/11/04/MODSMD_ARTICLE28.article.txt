# Card, UCLA look toward game, bids
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Editorial staff 
After coming off wins by scores of
42-12 and 49-0, respectively, you
would think that Stanford Coach Jack
Elway and UCLA Coach Terry Donahue
would have been at least a little ex
uberant at yesterday's press confer
ence.
But in the aftermath of those
lopsided victories, Elway seemed to
quietly savor his Cardinal squad's vic
tory over Washington State, while
Donahue talked down the Bruin's per
formance against Oregon State.
"I don't think we actually under
stood how important that game was
until it was over," Elway said.
The win assured Stanford of its first
winning season since 1980, solidified
hopes for a post-season bowl bid and
earned Elway a standing ovation from
his players in the locker room after the
game.
"That felt just great. I don't think I
can describe that feeling in any words,
but it's maybe the best 1 ever felt," El
way said.
With Stanford's record now standing
at 6-2, a victory either over UCLA this
Saturday at the Rose Bowl or over Cali
fornia on Nov. 22 would almost assure
the Cardinal of a bowl bid. Bids go out
on Big Game day.

A win over UCLA, however, would
probably put Stanford in the hunt for
one of the more prominent bowls.
"We've been disappointed in our
play against the elite of the Pac-10,"
Stanford fullback Brian Morris said.
"This week will be a challenge for our
offense to show that the games after
our two losses are indicative of our
real offense."
Elway made a point yesterday of
praising the workmanlike effort of
Morris.
"Brian is symbolic of the quality and
character on this football team," Elway
said. "Remember that it's Brian who's
leading for Brad (Muster) all day.
There is a total unselfishness on this
football team to a degree that I haven't
seen before."
Oregon State was very unselfish in
Portland on Saturday, giving up eight
interceptions and two fumbles to
UCLA. Donahue was not completely
thrilled with his Bruins perfounance
because the Beavers practically gave
the game away.
"Oregon State moved the ball very
effectively against us — they really ball
controlled us," Donahue said. "But
then they threw the ball right to us.
When the game was over I really wasn't
sure we deserved to win by that
much."
Nevertheless, the Bruins have out
scored their opponents 103-16 in their
last two games and 171-51 during their
current four game winning streak. Tail
back Gaston Green is one main reason
for UCLA's streak. He has rushed for
over 100 yards in his last three games
and has piled up 673 yards on 120
carries for a whopping average of 5.6
yards per carry.
The Bruins have much at stake in
this weekend's contest. Their 4-1
record in the Pac-10 (6-2 overall) gives
them an outside chance of going to the
Rose Bowl on New Year's day.
In all probability, UCLA will have to
win its last three games (Stanford,
Washington and USC) while hoping
that Arizona State, which sits atop the
Pac-10 with a 4-0-1 record (7-0-1 over
all) loses to either Arizona or Califor
nia.

Card notes
Because Saturday's game is going to he a
split national television game on CBS, the
kickoff has heen moved to 11 40 a.m. The
broadcast will start at 1130, and will be
aired in California, Oregon, Washington,
Arizona, Montana, Colorado, Wisconsin,
Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Minnesota, lowa, Michigan,
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
Stanford inside linebacker Barry
McKeever, who suffered a knee sprain
against Washington State, will not play
against UCLA.
Elwav said he thinks that there is a possi
bility that McKeever, who is the second
leading tackier on the team, will be able to
play against California.
UCLA also has its share of injuries. Inside
linebacker Chance Johnson and corner
back Chuckle Miller will be out Saturday,
while free safety James Washington is
doubtful.
The matchup between brothers Darryl
Henley of UCLA and wide receiver
Thomas Henley of Stanford is in jeopardy
because Darryl suffered a whiplash neck in
jury after intercepting a pass against Oregon
State. But Donahue said he believes Darryl
will be able to line up at cornerback against
Thomas on Saturday.

Thomas on Saturday.
After coming off wins by scores of
42-12 and 49-0, respectively, you
would think that Stanford Coach Jack
Elway and UCLA Coach Terry Donahue
would have been at least a little ex
uberant at yesterday's press confer
ence.
But in the aftermath of those
lopsided victories, Elway seemed to
quietly savor his Cardinal squad's vic
tory over Washington State, while
Donahue talked down the Bruin's per
formance against Oregon State.
"I don't think we actually under
stood how important that game was
until it was over," Elway said.
The win assured Stanford of its first
winning season since 1980, solidified
hopes for a post-season bowl bid and
earned Elway a standing ovation from
his players in the locker room after the
game.
"That felt just great. I don't think I
can describe that feeling in any words,
but it's maybe the best 1 ever felt," El
way said.
With Stanford's record now standing
at 6-2, a victory either over UCLA this
Saturday at the Rose Bowl or over Cali
fornia on Nov. 22 would almost assure
the Cardinal of a bowl bid. Bids go out
on Big Game day.

A win over UCLA, however, would
probably put Stanford in the hunt for
one of the more prominent bowls.
"We've been disappointed in our
play against the elite of the Pac-10,"
Stanford fullback Brian Morris said.
"This week will be a challenge for our
offense to show that the games after
our two losses are indicative of our
real offense."
Elway made a point yesterday of
praising the workmanlike effort of
Morris.
"Brian is symbolic of the quality and
character on this football team," Elway
said. "Remember that it's Brian who's
leading for Brad (Muster) all day.
There is a total unselfishness on this
football team to a degree that I haven't
seen before."
Oregon State was very unselfish in
Portland on Saturday, giving up eight
interceptions and two fumbles to
UCLA. Donahue was not completely
thrilled with his Bruins perfounance
because the Beavers practically gave
the game away.
"Oregon State moved the ball very
effectively against us — they really ball
controlled us," Donahue said. "But
then they threw the ball right to us.
When the game was over I really wasn't
sure we deserved to win by that
much."
Nevertheless, the Bruins have out
scored their opponents 103-16 in their
last two games and 171-51 during their
current four game winning streak. Tail
back Gaston Green is one main reason
for UCLA's streak. He has rushed for
over 100 yards in his last three games
and has piled up 673 yards on 120
carries for a whopping average of 5.6
yards per carry.
The Bruins have much at stake in
this weekend's contest. Their 4-1
record in the Pac-10 (6-2 overall) gives
them an outside chance of going to the
Rose Bowl on New Year's day.
In all probability, UCLA will have to
win its last three games (Stanford,
Washington and USC) while hoping
that Arizona State, which sits atop the
Pac-10 with a 4-0-1 record (7-0-1 over
all) loses to either Arizona or Califor
nia.

Card notes
Because Saturday's game is going to he a
split national television game on CBS, the
kickoff has heen moved to 11 40 a.m. The
broadcast will start at 1130, and will be
aired in California, Oregon, Washington,
Arizona, Montana, Colorado, Wisconsin,
Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Minnesota, lowa, Michigan,
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
Stanford inside linebacker Barry
McKeever, who suffered a knee sprain
against Washington State, will not play
against UCLA.
Elwav said he thinks that there is a possi
bility that McKeever, who is the second
leading tackier on the team, will be able to
play against California.
UCLA also has its share of injuries. Inside
linebacker Chance Johnson and corner
back Chuckle Miller will be out Saturday,
while free safety James Washington is
doubtful.
The matchup between brothers Darryl
Henley of UCLA and wide receiver
Thomas Henley of Stanford is in jeopardy
because Darryl suffered a whiplash neck in
jury after intercepting a pass against Oregon
State. But Donahue said he believes Darryl
will be able to line up at cornerback against
Thomas on Saturday.
