# Card, UCLA look toward game, bids
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Editorial staff 
After coming off wins by scores of
42-12 and 49-0, respectively, you
would think that Stanford Coach Jack
Elway and UCLA Coach Terry Donahue
would have been at least a little ex
uberant at yesterday's press confer
ence.
But in the aftermath of those
lopsided victories, Elway seemed to
quietly savor his Cardinal squad's vic
tory over Washington State, while
Donahue talked down the Bruin's per
formance against Oregon State.
"I don't think we actually under
stood how important that game was
until it was over," Elway said.
The win assured Stanford of its first
winning season since 1980, solidified
hopes for a post-season bowl bid and
earned Elway a standing ovation from
his players in the locker room after the
game.
"That felt just great. I don't think I
can describe that feeling in any words,
but it's maybe the best 1 ever felt," El
way said.
With Stanford's record now standing
at 6-2, a victory either over UCLA this
Saturday at the Rose Bowl or over Cali
fornia on Nov. 22 would almost assure
the Cardinal of a bowl bid. Bids go out
on Big Game day.

A win over UCLA, however, would
probably put Stanford in the hunt for
one of the more prominent bowls.
"We've been disappointed in our
play against the elite of the Pac-10,"
Stanford fullback Brian Morris said.
"This week will be a challenge for our
offense to show that the games after
our two losses are indicative of our
real offense."
Elway made a point yesterday of
praising the workmanlike effort of
Morris.
"Brian is symbolic of the quality and
character on this football team," Elway
said. "Remember that it's Brian who's
leading for Brad (Muster) all day.
There is a total unselfishness on this
football team to a degree that I haven't
seen before."
Oregon State was very unselfish in
Portland on Saturday, giving up eight
interceptions and two fumbles to
UCLA. Donahue was not completely
thrilled with his Bruins perfounance
because the Beavers practically gave
the game away.
"Oregon State moved the ball very
effectively against us â€” they really ball
controlled us," Donahue said. "But
then they threw the ball right to us.
When the game was over I really wasn't
sure we deserved to win by that
