In a pair of regattas thousands of
miles apart, the Stanford sailing
team established its West Coast
dominance and its national pres
tige, winning the Long Beach Invita
tional Dinghy Regatta and finishing
fourth at the North American Sloop
Championships.
On the West Coast, co-captain
Drew Gashler led the way as the
Cardinal dinghy squad sailed to an
impressive victory over a fleet of
California's top sailing teams. By
regatta's end, Stanford had reaf
firmed its reputation as the Western
school to beat.
Meanwhile, in Detroit, the Card
inal sloop team finished fourth in
the nation in a hard-fought battle
against traditional Eastern powers.
Though somewhat disappointed by
its finish, the sloop team felt that it
had sailed well enough to earn it
self an improved reputation among
other strong sailing teams.

and variable winds made the five
race series a challenging test for the
teams representing the best sailing

schools on the West Coast. The
Cardinal's first boat, sailed by Gash
ler and senior Kristen Boyles in the
A-division and by juniors Doug
Hagen and Courtney Biggert in the
B-division, scored a convincing vic

firsts and two seconds, while Hagen
and Biggert won the last three races
of the regatta.
Stanford's second boat, sailed in
the A-division by freshman Al Sar
gent and junior Jen Brokaw, and in
the B-division by freshman Robert
Brown and junior Kari Skilbred,
finished in the top 10 in the 15-boat
regatta. For both Sargent and
Brown, this weekend was the first
opportunity to skipper in a col
legiate dinghy regatta.
"We both had bright spots, but I
think we both also suffered from
first regatta syndrome. College
sailing is very competitive, and this
was an encouraging beginning. I
think by the spring we'll be just as
fast as the people who beat us
now," Brown said.
Brown also considered the Long
Beach regatta "a tuneup race for
