# Sailers impressive in two weekend races
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
In a pair of regattas thousands of
miles apart, the Stanford sailing
team established its West Coast
dominance and its national pres
tige, winning the Long Beach Invita
tional Dinghy Regatta and finishing
fourth at the North American Sloop
Championships.
On the West Coast, co-captain
Drew Gashler led the way as the
Cardinal dinghy squad sailed to an
impressive victory over a fleet of
California's top sailing teams. By
regatta's end, Stanford had reaf
firmed its reputation as the Western
school to beat.
Meanwhile, in Detroit, the Card
inal sloop team finished fourth in
the nation in a hard-fought battle
against traditional Eastern powers.
Though somewhat disappointed by
its finish, the sloop team felt that it
had sailed well enough to earn it
self an improved reputation among
other strong sailing teams.
At the Long Beach regatta, light
and variable winds made the five
race series a challenging test for the
teams representing the best sailing

schools on the West Coast. The
Cardinal's first boat, sailed by Gash
ler and senior Kristen Boyles in the
A-division and by juniors Doug
Hagen and Courtney Biggert in the
B-division, scored a convincing vic
tory. Gashler and Boyles tcx)k three
firsts and two seconds, while Hagen
and Biggert won the last three races
of the regatta.
Stanford's second boat, sailed in
the A-division by freshman Al Sar
gent and junior Jen Brokaw, and in
the B-division by freshman Robert
Brown and junior Kari Skilbred,
finished in the top 10 in the 15-boat
regatta. For both Sargent and
Brown, this weekend was the first
opportunity to skipper in a col
legiate dinghy regatta.
"We both had bright spots, but I
think we both also suffered from
first regatta syndrome. College
sailing is very competitive, and this
was an encouraging beginning. I
think by the spring we'll be just as
fast as the people who beat us
now," Brown said.
Brown also considered the Long
Beach regatta "a tuneup race for
next week,'' when the Cardinal com
petes at the North-South Regatta, an
event that will play a part in determin
ing its national ranking.
"This weekend was a casual regatta,
but we saw most of the people we'll
see next weekend at North-South. Even
though the conditions will probably be
different, I think we have a good
chance at winning next weekend too,"'
Gashler said.
"We dominated at Long Beach, and
hopefully we can do the same thing at
the North-South regatta," Stanford
Coach Blake Middleton said.
On the subject of the sloop regatta,
Middleton said the Stanford team was
as good as any other team at the cham
pionships but less in favor with lady
luck. Stanford's team of sophomore
skipper Bill Shoemaker, sophomore
Brad Swett and junior Dan Buckstaff
placed behind the Naval Academy,
Spring Hill College and the College of
Charleston.
"We made some tactical mistakes,
and that hurt us. Mainly, we were
sailing as well as the top three schools,
but we just couldn't beat them consis
tently. In addition, we had a lot of ran
dom, adverse circumstances come into
play against us. We seemed to have
worse luck than the other teams," Mid
dleton said.
The Cardinal started the regatta
strongly, winning the first race, but
then slipped back into second- and
third-place finishes and later could
only average fourth-place scores. Ac
cording to team members, it was a
regatta of inches, in which they were
just slightly outside the winner's circle.
"We were disappointed, because we
didn't have more than an average
regatta, and it seemed like we could
have done better if we had made a few
better decisions and had a little better
luck," co-captain Buckstaff said.
Middleton said he returned from the
regatta feeling that the team deserved
more than its near-miss at the national
championship. According to Mid
dleton, fourth place in the nation is not
a bad finish in any sense.
"It was amazing how many times our
team did what should have been the
right thing, only to have it not work

out. I think the other coaches saw that
we were sailing well and having bad
luck. Our biggest fault may have been
that we were being too conservative,"
Middleton said.

"We certainly could have been more
aggressive, but it's hard to get psyched
when you're sailing in boats that look
more like a basketball court's key than
anything else," Buckstaff said of the

Flying Scots used in the regatta.
In its first large-scale competition,
the entire sailing team will head for Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and the North-
South regatta next weekend.

Hagen and Courtney Biggert in the
B-division, scored a convincing vic
tory. Gashler and Boyles tcx)k three
firsts and two seconds, while Hagen
and Biggert won the last three races
of the regatta.
Stanford's second boat, sailed in
the A-division by freshman Al Sar
gent and junior Jen Brokaw, and in
the B-division by freshman Robert
Brown and junior Kari Skilbred,
finished in the top 10 in the 15-boat
regatta. For both Sargent and
Brown, this weekend was the first
opportunity to skipper in a col
legiate dinghy regatta.
"We both had bright spots, but I
think we both also suffered from
first regatta syndrome. College
sailing is very competitive, and this
was an encouraging beginning. I
think by the spring we'll be just as
fast as the people who beat us
now," Brown said.
Brown also considered the Long
Beach regatta "a tuneup race for
next week,'' when the Cardinal com
petes at the North-South Regatta, an
event that will play a part in determin
ing its national ranking.
"This weekend was a casual regatta,
but we saw most of the people we'll
see next weekend at North-South. Even
though the conditions will probably be
different, I think we have a good
chance at winning next weekend too,"'
Gashler said.
"We dominated at Long Beach, and
hopefully we can do the same thing at
the North-South regatta," Stanford
Coach Blake Middleton said.
On the subject of the sloop regatta,
Middleton said the Stanford team was
as good as any other team at the cham
pionships but less in favor with lady
luck. Stanford's team of sophomore
skipper Bill Shoemaker, sophomore
Brad Swett and junior Dan Buckstaff
placed behind the Naval Academy,
Spring Hill College and the College of
Charleston.
"We made some tactical mistakes,
and that hurt us. Mainly, we were
sailing as well as the top three schools,
but we just couldn't beat them consis
tently. In addition, we had a lot of ran
dom, adverse circumstances come into
play against us. We seemed to have
worse luck than the other teams," Mid
dleton said.
The Cardinal started the regatta
strongly, winning the first race, but
then slipped back into second- and
third-place finishes and later could
only average fourth-place scores. Ac
cording to team members, it was a
regatta of inches, in which they were
just slightly outside the winner's circle.
"We were disappointed, because we
didn't have more than an average
regatta, and it seemed like we could
have done better if we had made a few
better decisions and had a little better
luck," co-captain Buckstaff said.
Middleton said he returned from the
regatta feeling that the team deserved
more than its near-miss at the national
championship. According to Mid
dleton, fourth place in the nation is not
a bad finish in any sense.
"It was amazing how many times our
team did what should have been the
right thing, only to have it not work

out. I think the other coaches saw that
we were sailing well and having bad
luck. Our biggest fault may have been
that we were being too conservative,"
Middleton said.

"We certainly could have been more
aggressive, but it's hard to get psyched
when you're sailing in boats that look
more like a basketball court's key than
anything else," Buckstaff said of the

Flying Scots used in the regatta.
In its first large-scale competition,
the entire sailing team will head for Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and the North-
South regatta next weekend.

The team of (left to right) junior Dan Buckstaff, sophomore Brad Swett and sophomore skipper Bill Shoemaker
finished fourth in the nation in the North American Sloop Championships held last weekend in Detroit. Meanwhile
the remainder of the Stanford sailing team was breezing to victory in the Long Beach Invitational Dinghy Regatta.
In a pair of regattas thousands of
miles apart, the Stanford sailing
team established its West Coast
dominance and its national pres
tige, winning the Long Beach Invita
tional Dinghy Regatta and finishing
fourth at the North American Sloop
Championships.
On the West Coast, co-captain
Drew Gashler led the way as the
Cardinal dinghy squad sailed to an
impressive victory over a fleet of
California's top sailing teams. By
regatta's end, Stanford had reaf
firmed its reputation as the Western
school to beat.
Meanwhile, in Detroit, the Card
inal sloop team finished fourth in
the nation in a hard-fought battle
against traditional Eastern powers.
Though somewhat disappointed by
its finish, the sloop team felt that it
had sailed well enough to earn it
self an improved reputation among
other strong sailing teams.
At the Long Beach regatta, light
and variable winds made the five
race series a challenging test for the
teams representing the best sailing

schools on the West Coast. The
Cardinal's first boat, sailed by Gash
ler and senior Kristen Boyles in the
A-division and by juniors Doug
Hagen and Courtney Biggert in the
B-division, scored a convincing vic
tory. Gashler and Boyles tcx)k three
