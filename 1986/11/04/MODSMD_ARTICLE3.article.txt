# CIR urges sale of Champion stocks
## University now holds $131,250 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Champion Spark Plug has displayed
"minimal commitment to combating
apartheid" in South Africa, and the
Board of Trustees should sell Stan
ford's 12,500 shares of Champion
stock, according to a report released
yesterday by the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR).
The trustees will consider the CIR
recommendation at their next
meeting, Dec. 8 and 9. This is the Clßs
fifth South Africa-related divestment
proposal since May. The trustees have
sold Stanford's stock in the other four
companies, purging more than $4.8
million worth of stock from Stanford's
portfolio of South Africa-related stocks,
which is valued at about $170 million.

Stanford's Champion stock is worth
about $131,250.
Since the ClR's last report on Sept.
29, it has reviewed six companies with
South African operations to determine
compliance with the University's in
vestment criteria. According to CIR
Chairman Frederick Hillier, "Action
was deferred for a short time on four
of them in order to obtain more infor
mation."
Hillier told the trustees that "you can
expect an acceleration soon in our im
plementation of Stanford's policy of
selective divestment.
Hindering the CIR has been the ab
sence of the 1986 report on compan
ies' compliance with the Sullivan Prin
ciples. The report, originally sched
uled to be released this week or next,
will now come out later this month.
The annual Sullivan rating that a com
pany receives is one of the principal
factors the CIR takes into account when
milking proposals on divestment.
The CIR felt it had enough evidence
regarding Champion and the Inter
public Group, a New York City-based
advertising firm in which Stanford
owns stock valued at more than
$"'OO,OOO. Interpublic Group owns
three advertising agencies and
employs 350 people in South Africa.
Hillier said the CIR voted against
divesting from the Interpublic Group
because it has three blacks on its board
of directors, runs pioneering ads
showing the integration ot blacks and
whites and has no accounts with the
South African public sector. The adver
tising agency also told the CIR that its
1986 rating on the Sullivan Principles
will be better than its 1985 rating, Hil
lier said.
According to the CIR report, there

commendation to divest from Cham
pion was sparked by the company's er
ratic record on the Sullivan Principles
and by its spotty membership record
with corporate anti-apartheid groups.
These shortcomings led the CIR to
conclude that "considering all factors,
the company is not taking reasonable
action to counter the inherently dis
criminatory apartheid Jaws and
policies" — a standard established by
the trustees.
The six Sullivan Principles are a set
of racial guidelines for American com
panies in South Africa and aim to en
courage racial equality.
Champion, which employs 94
workers in South Africa, signed the
Sullivan Principles for the first time in
1979 and received a rating of II on a
five-point scale, the report says. A score
of 11, the second highest rating, means
a company is "making good progress"
in implementing the principles.
The company failed to report,
however, in 1980, 1981 and 1982. In
1983, companies had to begin paying
an annual fee to defray monitoring
costs, and Champion refused to pay the
$5,000 fee charged to companies
having total annual sales between $700
million and $1 billion.
According to the CIR report, "This
fee ... represents less than 0.08 per
cent of Champion's total South African
sales for 1984."
Nor is the company following the
spirit of the Sullivan Principles, accord
ing to the report. Sixty-one of the com
pany's 63 black employees work as
laborers. "None are managers, clerks
or administrators, and two are super
visors," the report says.
Sullivan Principle number five calls
on companies to increase "the numl>er
of blacks, coloreds and Asians in man
agement and supervisory positions."
The report quotes a Champion
spokesman's explanation: "Because of
the low turnover and small number of
employees, workers are trained for the
jobs that they have, but there is little or
no opportunity for promotion within
the plant, so further training would be
futile."
In addition, Champion is not a mem
ber of the U.S. Corporate Council on
South Africa, the report says. The coun
cil, composed of executives from U.S.
companies with South Africa opera
tions, has sought to influence the gov
ernment's social policies.
And though Champion belongs to
the American Chamber of Commerce
(Amcham), it did not sign or contrib
ute financially to two Amcham ad
vertisements that appeared in South
Africa newspapers this summer, the
report says.
The advertisements advocate,
among other things, abolishing apart
heid, freeing political prisoners and
negotiating "with acknowledged
leaders about power sharing "
The report also says Champion has
"responded inadequately to a full
year's worth of shareholder inquiries
from Stanford. And when it did finally
respond, it offered no explanation for
its delay and provided only sketchy in
formation as to the extent of its anti
apartheid activities."
Ignoring shareholder inquiries, the
report says, reflects "on the serious
ness with which a company regards
apartheid."

the low turnover and small number of
employees, workers are trained for the
jobs that they have, but there is little or
no opportunity for promotion within
the plant, so further training would be
futile."
In addition, Champion is not a mem
ber of the U.S. Corporate Council on
South Africa, the report says. The coun
cil, composed of executives from U.S.
companies with South Africa opera
tions, has sought to influence the gov
ernment's social policies.
And though Champion belongs to
the American Chamber of Commerce
(Amcham), it did not sign or contrib
ute financially to two Amcham ad
vertisements that appeared in South
Africa newspapers this summer, the
report says.
The advertisements advocate,
among other things, abolishing apart
heid, freeing political prisoners and
negotiating "with acknowledged
leaders about power sharing "
The report also says Champion has
"responded inadequately to a full
year's worth of shareholder inquiries
from Stanford. And when it did finally
respond, it offered no explanation for
its delay and provided only sketchy in
formation as to the extent of its anti
apartheid activities."
Ignoring shareholder inquiries, the
report says, reflects "on the serious
ness with which a company regards
apartheid."

Champion Spark Plug has displayed
"minimal commitment to combating
apartheid" in South Africa, and the
Board of Trustees should sell Stan
ford's 12,500 shares of Champion
stock, according to a report released
yesterday by the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR).
The trustees will consider the CIR
recommendation at their next
meeting, Dec. 8 and 9. This is the Clßs
fifth South Africa-related divestment
proposal since May. The trustees have
sold Stanford's stock in the other four
companies, purging more than $4.8
million worth of stock from Stanford's
portfolio of South Africa-related stocks,
which is valued at about $170 million.

Stanford's Champion stock is worth
about $131,250.
Since the ClR's last report on Sept.
29, it has reviewed six companies with
South African operations to determine
compliance with the University's in
vestment criteria. According to CIR
Chairman Frederick Hillier, "Action
was deferred for a short time on four
of them in order to obtain more infor
mation."
Hillier told the trustees that "you can
expect an acceleration soon in our im
plementation of Stanford's policy of
selective divestment.
Hindering the CIR has been the ab
sence of the 1986 report on compan
ies' compliance with the Sullivan Prin
ciples. The report, originally sched
uled to be released this week or next,
will now come out later this month.
The annual Sullivan rating that a com
pany receives is one of the principal
factors the CIR takes into account when
milking proposals on divestment.
The CIR felt it had enough evidence
regarding Champion and the Inter
public Group, a New York City-based
advertising firm in which Stanford
owns stock valued at more than
$"'OO,OOO. Interpublic Group owns
three advertising agencies and
employs 350 people in South Africa.
Hillier said the CIR voted against
divesting from the Interpublic Group
because it has three blacks on its board
of directors, runs pioneering ads
showing the integration ot blacks and
whites and has no accounts with the
South African public sector. The adver
tising agency also told the CIR that its
1986 rating on the Sullivan Principles
will be better than its 1985 rating, Hil
lier said.
According to the CIR report, there

commendation to divest from Cham
pion was sparked by the company's er
ratic record on the Sullivan Principles
and by its spotty membership record
with corporate anti-apartheid groups.
These shortcomings led the CIR to
conclude that "considering all factors,
the company is not taking reasonable
action to counter the inherently dis
criminatory apartheid Jaws and
policies" — a standard established by
the trustees.
The six Sullivan Principles are a set
of racial guidelines for American com
panies in South Africa and aim to en
courage racial equality.
Champion, which employs 94
workers in South Africa, signed the
Sullivan Principles for the first time in
1979 and received a rating of II on a
five-point scale, the report says. A score
of 11, the second highest rating, means
a company is "making good progress"
in implementing the principles.
The company failed to report,
however, in 1980, 1981 and 1982. In
1983, companies had to begin paying
an annual fee to defray monitoring
costs, and Champion refused to pay the
$5,000 fee charged to companies
having total annual sales between $700
million and $1 billion.
According to the CIR report, "This
fee ... represents less than 0.08 per
cent of Champion's total South African
sales for 1984."
Nor is the company following the
spirit of the Sullivan Principles, accord
ing to the report. Sixty-one of the com
pany's 63 black employees work as
laborers. "None are managers, clerks
or administrators, and two are super
visors," the report says.
Sullivan Principle number five calls
on companies to increase "the numl>er
of blacks, coloreds and Asians in man
agement and supervisory positions."
The report quotes a Champion
spokesman's explanation: "Because of
the low turnover and small number of
employees, workers are trained for the
jobs that they have, but there is little or
no opportunity for promotion within
the plant, so further training would be
