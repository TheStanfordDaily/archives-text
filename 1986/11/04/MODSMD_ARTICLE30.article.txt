ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Hank
Bullough, unable to turn around the
Buffalo Bills despite having the Na
tional Football League's highest-paid
quarterback, was fired as coach yester
day and replaced by Marv Levy.
Levy, former coach of the Kansas
City Chiefs, promised to bring "a sense
of organization" to the Bills. He is the
team's third head coach in the past 13
months.
Levy, who worked as an analyst on
Buffalo's exhibition telecasts for the
past four years, takes over a 2-7 team
that played poorly in the first half of
Sunday's 34-28 loss to the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. The Bills fumbled two
kickoffs, helping the Bucs to a 20-0
halftime lead before Buffalo rallied in
the second half.
Levy, who said he received a multi
year contract, acknowledged the Bills
need much help, particularly on
defense.
"Offensively, you'd look a lot better
if the defense was playing better," Levy
said of the Bills' defense that entered

the game ranked 26th among the 28
NFL teams.
"I think defensively, and statistics
will tear this out, that there needs to
be improvement," he said, "some of it
from current players, some of it from
future drafts."
To begin with, Levy said he would
"direct most attention toward the kick
ing game, which is shoddy now, in my
opinion. Offensively, I see some good
things, but it's very hard to divorce of
fense and defense from kicking."
Referring to the two fumbled kick
offs that led to Tampa Bay touchdowns
in the first half Sunday, Levy said: "You
make the two big kicking game
mistakes that you made yesterday, and
you put yourself ... in a position to
make it very tough for your passing
game to go."
The team's abysmal play in the first
half against the Bucs may have forced
the hand of Buffalo owner Ralph Wil
son Jr., who reportedly was angry in
the owner's box at Tampa Stadium.
