## S. Africa terrorism examined 
### NAMITA KHANNA 
The solution to South Africa's current crisis lies not with
the blacks but with the white regime, according to W.
Maloba, a doctoral candidate in the Stanford History Depart
ment, who labeled the South Africa government as the
source and perpetuator of terrorism in that nation.
Maloba's talk yesterday at the Bechtel International Cen
ter was the second in a three-part series on terrorism. The
series is sponsored by Ecumenical Ministries at Stanford
and Bechtel.
A Kenyan who spent seven years in Lesotho, Maloba
spoke largely out of his personal experience.
He said he foresees an intensification of the black guer
rilla movement it the white minority government continued
to resist substantial negotiations with the black leaders.
Maloba rejected the placatory measures of P.W. Botha's
government, such as the new constitution, as mere gestures.
What the blacks want, Maloba said, is power: not power to
overthrow the whites, but power to share with them.
But what the whites were giving was "too little and too
late," he said.
Terrorism in South Africa is not a recent phenomenon
but only recently has become the subject of international at
tention, according to Maloba, and it is largely the province
of the South African government.
Most cases of black-against black terrorism today are di
rected against black mercenaries employed by the South

African military or against suspected police informers, he
said.
The establishment of a colony — in this case, white set
tlers asserting supremacy and seizing land from the black
natives — is in itself an act of terrorism, Maloba said.
The government's terrorist actions first came to interna
tional attention in 1960 with the Sharpeville massacre, ac
cording to Maloba. In that incident, scores of blacks protest
ing the passbook system — a set of regulations intended to
restrict the movements of non-whites —were killed.
The massacre also marked the first time that the African
National Congress decided to turn to violence, according to
Maloba. Formed in 1912, the ANC was conceived as a non
violent protest movement designed to bring the minority
white rulers to the negotiating table, he said. Maloba added
that attempts at compromise were rebuffed by the Boer
regime.
After nearly SO years of peaceful protest, according to
Maloba, the blacks began to exercise a military option by
forming an armed wing to the ANC in 1961.
Maloba recounted the 19H2 invasion of Lesotho by the
South Africa government — to which he wits a personal wit
ness — as an example of its terrorist activities.
I'he white South Africans dragged ANC members — some
of them still in high school — out of their huts, shot them,
threw them back into the huts and set the huts on fire, ac
cording to Maloba.
All we could do was beat our chests and weep," he said.
