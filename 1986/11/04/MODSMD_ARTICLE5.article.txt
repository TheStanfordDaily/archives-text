# Stanford: Tenure policy is unchanged
## 
### BRUCE BROWN Editorial staff 
Since the implementation last year
of recommendations on tenure review
made by Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells, questions
have been raised as to whether the
new criteria amount to a dramatically
different method of tenure review and
whether they make tenure more diffi
cult to receive.
The new criteria stated in Wessells'
April 1985 memo require that the ten
ure candidate must be placed in a

broader context in his field. The memo
stipulates that "it is not sufficient
merely to be the best of a particular
experience-cohort in a discipline....
The comparison group should not be
limited to persons who obtained the
doctoral degree at about the same
time."
According to Wessells, the appropri
ate question to ask is: "How does the
candidate compare with the field's in
tellectual leaders today and at compa
rable stages at those persons' careers?"
Through the late 1970s and early
1980s, the comparison group appeared

to be limited to those who obtained
doctorates during the same time per
iod as the candidate.
A 1972 statement by then-Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Albert Has
torf — used as a reference for tenure
decisions — says outside letters of re
commendation for tenure candidates
must be a "fair evaluation of the indi
vidual's activities as well as an explicit
comparison of the candidate vis a vis
individuals at the same stage of profes
sional development working in the
same field.'"
In an attempt to clarify the tenure

procedure, Wessells issued an April
1985 memorandum to bring together
in one document a comprehensive set
of guidelines concerning all promo
tions, appointments and reappoint
ments in the school.
Since Wessells' policy statement was
released, questions have been raised
as to whether it simply refines tradi
tional philosophies or introduces a
new master plan concerning tenure.
Kathy Gil lam, the academic affairs
officer for the School of Humanities
and Sciences, feels that the Wessells'
statement, while not having a written
precedent, does not amount to a major
policy shift.
"More than anything," she said, "it
was a clarification of existing practice,
and specifically it gives the deans a bet
ter frame of reference to judge the can
didate, they get a better assessment, a
more detailed placement of the per
son's work."
The Dean's Office does not believe
that the additional comparison will
make tenure more difficult to obtain.
Gilium stated that a majority of the
referees, those who make promotion
recommendations, "did not complain
in making the broader comparision,"
and in most cases it did not result in
more critical assessments of the candi
dates.
Gillam said that of the 13 faculty
members who were up for tenure last
year, nine were granted tenure, two
were denied, and two are still pending.
"In fact," she added, "the trend, over
the past five or six years, is that an in
creasing proportion of assistant profes
sors have received tenure."
Noel Kolak, the vice provost for Fac

ulty Affairs, said (hat Stanford's com
mitment to retaining junior faculty in
tenured positions remains strong.
"We can say in good faith that to
receive an initial appointment at Stan
ford University, an instructor must
have the intellectual and teaching po
tential that we look for in a permanent
faculty member," she said.
Some members of the Stanford aca
demic community — including Steph
en Ferruolo, an assistant professor of
history who was denied tenure last
year, the first year that Wessells' memo
became effective — feel that the state
ment did effect a new and tougher
policy.
The stipulations "were new and they
set standards for promotion to tenure
which are unrealistic for young
scholars, especially for those working
In well-established fields," Ferruolo
said in an interview published in the
Summer 19H6 volume of "In Writing"
magazine.
After he was denied tenure, Fer
ruolo filed a grievance, which was up
held, and his case now is being recon
sidered.
Ferruolo feels that the policy un
fairly contradicted the Faculty Hand
book of May 1984, which does not
demand a comparison to senior
scholars.

ter frame of reference to judge the can
didate, they get a better assessment, a
more detailed placement of the per
son's work."
The Dean's Office does not believe
that the additional comparison will
make tenure more difficult to obtain.
Gilium stated that a majority of the
referees, those who make promotion
recommendations, "did not complain
in making the broader comparision,"
and in most cases it did not result in
more critical assessments of the candi
dates.
Gillam said that of the 13 faculty
members who were up for tenure last
year, nine were granted tenure, two
were denied, and two are still pending.
"In fact," she added, "the trend, over
the past five or six years, is that an in
creasing proportion of assistant profes
sors have received tenure."
Noel Kolak, the vice provost for Fac

ulty Affairs, said (hat Stanford's com
mitment to retaining junior faculty in
tenured positions remains strong.
"We can say in good faith that to
receive an initial appointment at Stan
ford University, an instructor must
have the intellectual and teaching po
tential that we look for in a permanent
faculty member," she said.
Some members of the Stanford aca
demic community — including Steph
en Ferruolo, an assistant professor of
history who was denied tenure last
year, the first year that Wessells' memo
became effective — feel that the state
ment did effect a new and tougher
policy.
The stipulations "were new and they
set standards for promotion to tenure
which are unrealistic for young
scholars, especially for those working
In well-established fields," Ferruolo
said in an interview published in the
Summer 19H6 volume of "In Writing"
magazine.
After he was denied tenure, Fer
ruolo filed a grievance, which was up
held, and his case now is being recon
sidered.
Ferruolo feels that the policy un
fairly contradicted the Faculty Hand
book of May 1984, which does not
demand a comparison to senior
scholars.
