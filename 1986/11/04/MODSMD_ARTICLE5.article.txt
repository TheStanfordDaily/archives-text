# Stanford: Tenure policy is unchanged
## 
### BRUCE BROWN Editorial staff 
Since the implementation last year
of recommendations on tenure review
made by Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells, questions
have been raised as to whether the
new criteria amount to a dramatically
different method of tenure review and
whether they make tenure more diffi
cult to receive.
The new criteria stated in Wessells'
April 1985 memo require that the ten
ure candidate must be placed in a

broader context in his field. The memo
stipulates that "it is not sufficient
merely to be the best of a particular
experience-cohort in a discipline....
The comparison group should not be
limited to persons who obtained the
doctoral degree at about the same
time."
According to Wessells, the appropri
ate question to ask is: "How does the
candidate compare with the field's in
tellectual leaders today and at compa
rable stages at those persons' careers?"
Through the late 1970s and early
1980s, the comparison group appeared

to be limited to those who obtained
doctorates during the same time per
iod as the candidate.
A 1972 statement by then-Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Albert Has
torf — used as a reference for tenure
decisions — says outside letters of re
commendation for tenure candidates
must be a "fair evaluation of the indi
vidual's activities as well as an explicit
comparison of the candidate vis a vis
individuals at the same stage of profes
sional development working in the
same field.'"
In an attempt to clarify the tenure

procedure, Wessells issued an April
1985 memorandum to bring together
in one document a comprehensive set
of guidelines concerning all promo
tions, appointments and reappoint
ments in the school.
Since Wessells' policy statement was
released, questions have been raised
as to whether it simply refines tradi
tional philosophies or introduces a
new master plan concerning tenure.
