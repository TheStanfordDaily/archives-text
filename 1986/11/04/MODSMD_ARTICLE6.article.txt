# University pays speakers more money
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
An informal survey of universities has shown that
Stanford's Speakers Bureau pays more to attract
speakers than other universities.
An example is Dr Ruth Westheimer, scheduled to
speak here Nov. 11, for whom the ASSU raised its
ceiling on honorariums to $7,500. Harvard paid noth
ing more than Westheimer's travel expenses when
she spoke there last year, according to Joe D'Amico,
vice president of promotions for the Harvard Law
Forum, a similar organization to the Speakers
Bureau.
D'Amico said honorariums are never paid to
speakers who are invited through the Law Forum.
However, Pierre Lehu, Westheimer's promotions
manager, said Westheimer was paid a small
honorarium in addition to her travel expenses when
she spoke at Harvard. Lehu refused to disclose the
amount paid.

Lehu did say that Westheimer accepted a much
lower fee at Stanford than she does at other univer
sities. Meg Richman, president of the Speaker's
Bureau, agreed.
"We want to please the students,'' she said, ex
plaining why the Speakers Bureau offered Wes
theimer $7,500 plus travel and hotel expenses Wes
theimer was recently voted the most popular and
sought-out speaker at university campuses, according
to Richman.
Other speakers scheduled to speak here this year
include Nick Daniloff and possibly Berke Breathed,
Richman said. The Speakers Bureau has also lined up
a health policy conference and is planning to reopen
the case of the Lindbergh Baby Trial.
"The problem is that we are in California. We are
at a disadvantage, Richman said. Many of the people
the Speakers Bureau writes to, especially political fig
ures, are centered on the East Coast, she said.
Kennell Jackson, Branner Resident Fellow, agreed
that this is a major problem. Jackson has been active

in attracting prominent speakers, such as Ed Zschau,
for the Branner Presents program since its founding
six years ago. The program does not offer
honorariums.
"We are in pursuit of people all the time, said
Jackson, associate professor of history. He credited
the program's success to persistence and attention to
detail.
"They (the speakers) know that we can put on
major speakers and a serious discussion," he said.
"They will get a major audience, as well— They
won't say 'no' flat out anymore."
The Law Forum is not the only student-run
speakers organization that does not offer
honorarioums. Yale University does not pay an
honorarium either, according to Jay Musoff, vice
president of the Political Union.
Both Harvard and Yale are also able to attract very
prominent and popular speakers from around the
country — some of whom have turned
down Stanford this year.
Harvard's list includes Rev. Jerry Fal
well, Ctrl Sagan, Rev. Jesse Jackson and
Dan Rather, said Jim Feck-Gray, presi
dent of the Law Forum. Fast speakers
include John F. Kennedy, Daniel Or
tega and Sally Ride, Peck-Gray said.
Peck-Gray said approximately 200
people are sent invitations and about
10 percent result in acceptances. He
said they receive a little money from
the Law School, but most ol the
speakers' travel and hotel expenses are
financed by patrons, lienefactors and
sponsors.
Speakers at Yale this semester in
clude T. Boone Pickens, Adm.

Past speakers include Jimmy Carter,
President Ronald Reagan and William
Buckley.
The Speakers Bureau was turned
down by Pickens this year and Carter
h;»s not responded yet, according to
Richman.
Musoff said that some of Yale's
speakers are prominent alumni, such
as Buckley, who like to speak at their
alma mater.
