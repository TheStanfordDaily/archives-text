100 th Congress to be chosen
The candidates submitted their case to the voters yesterday in the tense
struggle for control of the Senate, the shining prize in today's elections to
pick the nation's 100 th Congress and three dozen governors.
President Reagan played his role as Chief Campaigner to the end, stump
ing for GOP candidates in two Western states in a bid to keep the Senate
from falling into hostile Democratic hands in his final two years in office.
Visiting Nevada for GOP Senate candidate Jim Santini, the president said,
"It's time we got the facts out about Jim's opponent. I don't think the
fiercely independent people of Nevada want as their senator a tax-and
spend liberal who is against a balanced budget amendment."
Then it was on to Costa Mesa, where the president holstered his partisan
rhetoric in favor of a sentimental speech marking the end of what he
termed "the last campaign." The real issue, he said, is "that future that all of
us want: a future of prosperity, of freedom for the individual; above all, a
future where America is safe and secure."
Leaders of both parties in the House of Representatives made their final
forays of the nation's costliest mid-term campaign — and one of the nas
tiest. Rep. Guy Vanderjagt of Michigan, who chairs the Republican congres
sional campaign committee, headed for Maryland, Ohio, Michigan, Texas
and North Carolina. His Democratic counterpart, Rep. Tony Coelho of Cali
fornia, had a stop in Annapolis, Md., on his schedule.
Most of the attention nationally was focused on the Senate races.
Republicans hold a 53-47 edge in the current Senate but are defending 22
of the 34 seats on the ballot.
Democrats said they would gain more than enough seats to end six years
of Republican rule. The GOP sounded less confident about predicting the
outcome.
Bail set in Davies spy case
SAN FRANCISCO — Former Air Force Sgt. Allen Davies, charged with
trying to pass military secrets to the Soviet Union, was granted bail of
$200,000 yesterday by a federal magistrate who said the case didn't appear
to involve a "high level of espionage."
Davies, 33, of San Jose, was arrested last Monday at the Palo Alto aero
space firm where he worked. He is accused of giving an undercover FBI
agent details of an Air Force reconnaissance program he had worked on
during his last two years in the service. He was discharged in 1984.
The agent said Davies believed he was talking to an employee of the So
viet consulate in San Francisco during meetings in San Francisco on Sept.
22 and Oct. 5 and never requested money in exchange for the secrets.
The prosecution asked that Davies be held without bail until trial. Assis
tant U.S. Attorney Eb Luckel noted the espionage charge carries a potential
life sentence and said Davies, a British-born naturalized U.S. citizen, might
flee the country.
Davies will remain in jail until his family can raise the bond money
needed to free him. Woelflen said he must live at his parents' Cupertino
home, report in person to a probation officer each day, submit to psychia
tric counseling and possibly to drug and alcohol counseling.
Court ends Virginia busing
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, in a move that may spur efforts to
dismantle school busing programs, yesterday allowed Norfolk, Va. to
become the first school district in the country to end court-ordered busing
of elementary pupils. <
The justices issued no ruling but simply let stand a decision last February
by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond that permitted Nor
folk to end its 15-year-old busing program.
At the same time, the justices, also without explanation, let stand a some
what contradictory ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Den
ver last June that had blocked Oklahoma City's plan to end busing.
The mixed signals left both sides guessing as to the high court's thinking
on the basic issues. But lawyers on both sides agreed that, at a minimum, a
number of school districts now would be tempted to try to emulate Nor
folk's example and return to court to end busing plans. The 4th Circuit's
jurisdiction technically extends only to Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia
and the Carolinas.
James Nabrit 111, an lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educa
tional Fund, Inc., anticipates further litigation as a result of the court's ac
tions. In Riddick v. School Board of Norfolk, the Richmond appeals court
said its decision to permit the board to impose the neighborhood plan was
limited, "applicable only to those school systems which have succeeded in
eradicating all vestiges" of segregated schools. In those systems, the school
boards and not the federal courts, will run the schools," the court said.
Hasenfus to plead court mercy
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Eugene Hasenfus, the captured American
accused of supplying arms to the U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua, will
"throw himself on the mercy of the court" when his lawyer calls him to tes
tify today, according to former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell.
At a press conference here yesterday, Bell urged the prosecution not to
introduce as evidence a CBS "60 Minutes" interview with Hasenfus, and he
charged that U.S. journalists were unethical for interviewing Hasenfus in
the presence of Sandinista police and without an attorney present.
Bell did not make clear what objections he has to the "60 Minutes" inter
view, which was conducted by correspondent Mike Wallace, but he said
that the prosecution has enough evidence to convict Hasenfus without it.
Bell, who is advising Hasenfus' Nicaraguan lawyer, said the defense
would emphasize the "mitigating circumstances" surrounding Hasenfus'
role in the supply mission.
Conferees may blast Soviets
VIENNA, AUSTRIA — In compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Accords, 35
countries convened at the Third World Conference today, in which the So
viet Union is expected to face a torrent of criticism from the West over its
human-rights record.
The Vienna meeting, due to last at least through next summer, will exam
ine progress in all three areas covered by the Helsinki agreement — secur
ity, human rights and economic collaboration. The participants include all
the nations of Europe, except Albania, plus the United States and Canada.
Like two previous reviews, in Belgrade in 1977-78, and 1980-83 in
Madrid, the Vienna session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe (CSCE) is expected to be marked by Western allegations that the
Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies have violated Helsinki's
"humanitarian" agreements on emigration and persecution of political
dissidents. Although some progress was made in the 19705, political arrests
in the Soviet Union have increased in the 1980s, and fewer than 1,000 Jews
left the country last year, compared to a high of 51,000 in 1979.
U.S. citizen reunited with family
LOS ANGELES— A man who left the Soviet Union a decade ago has been
reunited with his sister and her family more than seven years after he
began fighting to win them permission to follow him.
"All my life I fought with the Soviets to come here," said George Avakian,
an ethnic Armenian. "Then when my sister decided to come, I started fight
ing for her."
Avakian, of Los Angeles, met his sister, Janet Pogosian, her husband,
Sarkis and their three children Sunday at Los Angeles International Airport.
Also at the tearful reunion were Avakian's mother, Wadia, and another
sister, Roza Durfalian, who also live in the Los Angeles area.
"Now my children can have freedom," Sarkis Pogosian said in Russian.
"The separation for my wife and her family has been too long."
Avakian said he began to writing Soviet officials seven years ago, seeking
permission for his sister to emigrate

Bail set in Davies spy case
SAN FRANCISCO — Former Air Force Sgt. Allen Davies, charged with
trying to pass military secrets to the Soviet Union, was granted bail of
$200,000 yesterday by a federal magistrate who said the case didn't appear
to involve a "high level of espionage."
Davies, 33, of San Jose, was arrested last Monday at the Palo Alto aero
space firm where he worked. He is accused of giving an undercover FBI
agent details of an Air Force reconnaissance program he had worked on
during his last two years in the service. He was discharged in 1984.
The agent said Davies believed he was talking to an employee of the So
viet consulate in San Francisco during meetings in San Francisco on Sept.
22 and Oct. 5 and never requested money in exchange for the secrets.
The prosecution asked that Davies be held without bail until trial. Assis
tant U.S. Attorney Eb Luckel noted the espionage charge carries a potential
life sentence and said Davies, a British-born naturalized U.S. citizen, might
flee the country.
Davies will remain in jail until his family can raise the bond money
needed to free him. Woelflen said he must live at his parents' Cupertino
home, report in person to a probation officer each day, submit to psychia
tric counseling and possibly to drug and alcohol counseling.
Court ends Virginia busing
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, in a move that may spur efforts to
dismantle school busing programs, yesterday allowed Norfolk, Va. to
become the first school district in the country to end court-ordered busing
of elementary pupils. <
The justices issued no ruling but simply let stand a decision last February
by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond that permitted Nor
folk to end its 15-year-old busing program.
At the same time, the justices, also without explanation, let stand a some
what contradictory ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Den
ver last June that had blocked Oklahoma City's plan to end busing.
The mixed signals left both sides guessing as to the high court's thinking
on the basic issues. But lawyers on both sides agreed that, at a minimum, a
number of school districts now would be tempted to try to emulate Nor
folk's example and return to court to end busing plans. The 4th Circuit's
jurisdiction technically extends only to Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia
and the Carolinas.
James Nabrit 111, an lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educa
tional Fund, Inc., anticipates further litigation as a result of the court's ac
tions. In Riddick v. School Board of Norfolk, the Richmond appeals court
said its decision to permit the board to impose the neighborhood plan was
limited, "applicable only to those school systems which have succeeded in
eradicating all vestiges" of segregated schools. In those systems, the school
boards and not the federal courts, will run the schools," the court said.
Hasenfus to plead court mercy
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Eugene Hasenfus, the captured American
accused of supplying arms to the U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua, will
"throw himself on the mercy of the court" when his lawyer calls him to tes
tify today, according to former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell.
At a press conference here yesterday, Bell urged the prosecution not to
introduce as evidence a CBS "60 Minutes" interview with Hasenfus, and he
charged that U.S. journalists were unethical for interviewing Hasenfus in
the presence of Sandinista police and without an attorney present.
Bell did not make clear what objections he has to the "60 Minutes" inter
view, which was conducted by correspondent Mike Wallace, but he said
that the prosecution has enough evidence to convict Hasenfus without it.
Bell, who is advising Hasenfus' Nicaraguan lawyer, said the defense
would emphasize the "mitigating circumstances" surrounding Hasenfus'
role in the supply mission.
Conferees may blast Soviets
VIENNA, AUSTRIA — In compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Accords, 35
countries convened at the Third World Conference today, in which the So
viet Union is expected to face a torrent of criticism from the West over its
human-rights record.
The Vienna meeting, due to last at least through next summer, will exam
ine progress in all three areas covered by the Helsinki agreement — secur
ity, human rights and economic collaboration. The participants include all
the nations of Europe, except Albania, plus the United States and Canada.
Like two previous reviews, in Belgrade in 1977-78, and 1980-83 in
Madrid, the Vienna session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe (CSCE) is expected to be marked by Western allegations that the
Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies have violated Helsinki's
"humanitarian" agreements on emigration and persecution of political
dissidents. Although some progress was made in the 19705, political arrests
in the Soviet Union have increased in the 1980s, and fewer than 1,000 Jews
left the country last year, compared to a high of 51,000 in 1979.
U.S. citizen reunited with family
LOS ANGELES— A man who left the Soviet Union a decade ago has been
reunited with his sister and her family more than seven years after he
began fighting to win them permission to follow him.
"All my life I fought with the Soviets to come here," said George Avakian,
an ethnic Armenian. "Then when my sister decided to come, I started fight
ing for her."
Avakian, of Los Angeles, met his sister, Janet Pogosian, her husband,
Sarkis and their three children Sunday at Los Angeles International Airport.
Also at the tearful reunion were Avakian's mother, Wadia, and another
sister, Roza Durfalian, who also live in the Los Angeles area.
"Now my children can have freedom," Sarkis Pogosian said in Russian.
"The separation for my wife and her family has been too long."
Avakian said he began to writing Soviet officials seven years ago, seeking
permission for his sister to emigrate

100 th Congress to be chosen
The candidates submitted their case to the voters yesterday in the tense
struggle for control of the Senate, the shining prize in today's elections to
pick the nation's 100 th Congress and three dozen governors.
President Reagan played his role as Chief Campaigner to the end, stump
ing for GOP candidates in two Western states in a bid to keep the Senate
from falling into hostile Democratic hands in his final two years in office.
Visiting Nevada for GOP Senate candidate Jim Santini, the president said,
"It's time we got the facts out about Jim's opponent. I don't think the
fiercely independent people of Nevada want as their senator a tax-and
spend liberal who is against a balanced budget amendment."
Then it was on to Costa Mesa, where the president holstered his partisan
rhetoric in favor of a sentimental speech marking the end of what he
termed "the last campaign." The real issue, he said, is "that future that all of
us want: a future of prosperity, of freedom for the individual; above all, a
future where America is safe and secure."
Leaders of both parties in the House of Representatives made their final
forays of the nation's costliest mid-term campaign — and one of the nas
tiest. Rep. Guy Vanderjagt of Michigan, who chairs the Republican congres
sional campaign committee, headed for Maryland, Ohio, Michigan, Texas
