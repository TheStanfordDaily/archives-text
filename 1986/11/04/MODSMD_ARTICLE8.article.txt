# UPDATE
## Former hostage pleas for others 
### 
WIESBADEN, West Germany — David Jacobsen
told yesterday of his great joy in being released from
more than 17 months of captivity but said other
Americans still held by Lebanese kidnappers "are in
hell" and must be set free.
Jacobsen, 55, arrived at the U.S. military air base in
Wiesbaden one day after being freed by his Shiite
Moslem captors. Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite
accompanied Jacobsen, who was serving as adminis
trator of the American University hospital in Beirut
when he was abducted on May 28, 1985.
Waite, who has negotiated to free the hostages
since last year, said he would keep on seeking the
release of five other Americans who are among 19
foreigners still missing in Lebanon.
They include Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, and Thomas
Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the univer
sity, who also have been held since early 1985.
Jacobsen, from Huntington Beach, was examined
at the Air Force hospital. Col. Charles Maffet, hospital
director, told a news conference that, "although he is
tired, our initial impression is that he is physically in
very good condition. It also seems that he has dealt
with the stresses of his captivity remarkably well."
Maffet said the medical evaluation would be com
pleted in a few days.

"Initial evaluation did not reveal any evidence of
physical abuse," he said, adding that Jacobsen was
eating normal foods and even had some wine.
"It appears he has lost very little weight. Again, he
is fit." the colonel said. "He has had no medication
since he's been here."
Jacobsen's family is to arrive today.
In an emotional statement soon after arrival, he
said his happiness was greatly diminished by the con
tinued captivity of the others.
"I can't tell you how very, very happy I am here
today. But it's with really mixed feelings to be a free
man again," he said. His voice shook and he ap
peared on the verge of tears. "Those guys are in hell,
and we've gotta get them home.
"The best things in life are free," he said, "and, by
God, they are."
Jacobsen was in the hands of the pro-Iranian Shiite
group Islamic Jihad, as are Anderson, 39, and Suther
land, 55.
He smiled occasionally and said he felt well but
gave no details of his treatment during captivity.
Waite, 47, refused comment on his attempts to free
the others. "We're being very careful about what we
say for the moment because we're just at a very criti
cal stage," he said. "I'll be here probably for a couple
of days, and then I may be going back."
In praise of the Anglican envoy, Jacobsen said:

"Thank God for a man like Terry Waite... Terry was
a man of hope in our darkest hour. "
Although he criticized the U.S. government's hand
ling of the Beirut hostage situation when he was a
captive, Jacobsen thanked the Reagan administration
and said he was "darned proud to be an American."
Air Force spokesmen said they did not know when
Jacobsen would return to the United States.
Several dozen U.S. military personnel and
hundreds of reporters met the plane at Wiesbaden.
Hanging from the flight control tower was a banner
that read: "Welcome home, Mr. Jacobsen."
"The joy of this (returning) is only greatly lessened
by the fact that Tom Sutherland, Terry Anderson and,
to my deep grief, the three other Americans that have
been kidnapped in the last month(s are still
hostages)," he said.
Anderson was kidnapped on March 16, 1985, and
Sutherland was abducted June 9 of that year.
Jacobsen said Anderson was "fine," and he had
seen the journalist frequently in the past 18 months
but did not elaborate.
Jacobsen said one of the three latest Americans
kidnapped, acting university controller Joe Cicippio,
is one of his closest personal friends, and"I pray to
God that he will be out quickly."
