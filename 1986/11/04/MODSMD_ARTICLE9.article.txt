# Top security leak feared at ACDA
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Administration of
ficials are seeking to permanently lift
the security clearances of an employee
of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency who allegedly mis
handled about 500 top-secret docu
ments, including some of the U.S. gov
ernment's most sensitive intelligence
about Pakistan's efforts to build a nu
clear bomb.
The employee, Kathleen Strang, im
properly removed the documents
from a storage vault at the State Depart
ment, repeatedly left them overnight in
an open safe accessible to dozens of
people without security clearances and
then ignored several warnings from
supervisors for a period of months, ac
cording to portions of an internal in
vestigative report filed in a related suit
in U.S. District Court here.
Strang said she had committed only
a technical infraction of regulations
and no harm had resulted, according
to sources familiar with the case.
U.S. security officials have no
evidence that anyone saw or took any
documents from Strang's safe. But the
internal investigative file alleges that
she gave portions of some sensitive
documents to officials of the South
Korean government in September
1984, apparently hoping to prove that
Pakistan was developing a nuclear

bomb and thus discourage the South
Koreans from providing any technical
assistance that might aid the Pakistanis.
Strang said she gave only unclassified
material to the South Koreans, sources
said.
In July 1985, U.S. officials removed
Strang's safe from her fourth-floor of
fice at the State Department and then
spent months conducting a damage
assessment. Inside the safe, sources
said, the officials found documents
bearing the codewords 'UMBRA' and
'MORAY' — terms used for highly
sensitive communications intercepts
gathered by the National Security
Agency. They also found computer
floppy disks with other documents
stored on them. The investigative file
alleges that Strang used a secretary
without a proper security clearance to
transcribe classified information onto
the disks.
When Lt. Gen. William Odom, direc
tor of the National Security Agency,
heard about the matter, he sent a hand
written letter to ACDA's director, Ken
neth Adelman, calling what the inves
tigators found one of the worst security
violations he had ever seen, according
to sources. Odom threatened to cut off
;-ACDA's access to sensitive intelligence
unless immediate and severe steps
were taken, die sources said.

The case has caused particular con
cern among U.S. intelligence officials,
who said someone with access to the
documents could draw a full portrait of
the methods and techniques used by
U.S. intelligence agencies to monitor
nuclear tests and weapons develop
ments in other countries, including the
Soviet Union.
"Other than early warning intelli
gence on a surprise attack, it's the most
vital function we perform," said a
senior Reagan administration intelli
gence official.
At the time Strang's safe was seized,
her security clearances were
suspended, and she was placed on
leave, with pay, from her job in charge
of monitoring the Pakistani nuclear
program.
An internal ACDA panel recom
mended that her clearances be
revoked permanently. She has ap
pealed that decision to Adelman, and
he held a closed-door five-hour
hearing on her appeal yesterday.
Strang also filed a lawsuit under the
Freedom of Information and Privacy
acts, seeking monetary damages and
demanding deletions from her person
nel file; this lawsuit resulted in the
placement of portions of the inves
tigative file in court records.

Strang declined to comment on the
case.
But ACDA security chief Berne Ir
dahl, who conducted an internal inves
tigation, said in a memorandum that
"all the material in her safe, marked or
unmarked, was considered by State's
(intelligence division) to be com
promised. Classified material was
taken home, to meetings and overseas.
Classified material was provided to
foreign governments without proper
authorization." Indahl's memo is con
tained in the court papers.
In response to questions, the ACDA
released a brief statement confirming
that a safe was "sequestered" on July 1,
1985, as part of a security investigation
of an unnamed employee.
As the agency that is responsible for
all arms control issues, the ACDA
receives sensitive information from all
over the government: policy papers
from the White House, intelligence
reports from NSA and the CIA, techni
cal data on nuclear technology from
the Department of Energy.
According to sources, Strang and her
attorney have said that some of her fel
low workers have a personal grudge
against her, and this accounts, in part,
for the allegations.
