Southern Africa: Visions of Freedom
SPEAKER: MRS. KHETHIWE MHLANGA
Zimbabwe Program Director, Oxfam America
Khethiwe is a Zimbabwean with 20 years
experience in grassroots development projects in
Africa, with special focus on women's issues.
Drawing from her extensive field work, Mrs.
Mhlanga will explore some crucial issues, including
the changes in Zimbabwe since its independence
in 1980, the efforts of poor farmers and
farmworkers to improve their lives, the influence of
South Africa on development programs in
Zimbabwe and other "frontline States," and the
likely effects of sanctions against South Africa on
Zimbabwean farmers and farmworkers.
