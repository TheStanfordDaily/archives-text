# Profs. react to Democratic gains

### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Democrats took control of the U.S. Senate
yesterday, gaining at least eight seats and cap
turing much of the early election coverage.
But according to professors and specialists
here, the Democrats' gain will not lead
toward any major changes in policy.
Those commenting on the election dis
agree on whether the election signaled any
sort of referendum on Reagan's policies, but
almost all agree that a Democrat-controlled
Senate did not result from a change in public
opinion regarding national policy issues.
"The notion that there is a massive realign
ment toward the Democratic Party underway
seems a bit excessive," Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody said.
Terry Moe, professor of political science,
agreed, asserting that the idealogical make-up
of the Senate will not change.
"In fact, a lot of moderate Republicans have
been replaced by more conservative Demo
crats," he said.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
predicted "simply a moderate change in Sen
ate behavior."
There will "probably be more questioning
of aid to the Nicaraguan contras and just a
moderate increase in social spending," Mar
shall said. "But it's not a revolution."
Marshall said the election confirmed the
theory that an incumbent president in an off
year election has "much, much less influ
ence" than one might expect.
"This election has provided a particularly
good test of that theory because Reagan has
been such a popular president," he said.
With the Democrats now in control of the
Senate, committee chairmanships will change
from Republican to Democratic hands.
Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) will
replace Senator Strom Thurmond of South

Carolina as head of the Judiciary Committee,
and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia will take
over as head of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, replacing current Republican
Chair Barry Goldwater of Arizona. These two
shifts have received particular attention since
the Judiciary Committee is responsible for ap
proving presidential Supreme Court nomina
tions and the Armed Services Committee is a
key committee in formulating defense policy.
According to Marshall, the chairman
change in the Judiciary Committee means that
the president will have to nominate a more
moderate person for a seat on the Supreme
Court if a vacancy should occur in the next
few years.
"If the president sends up someone that's
another (Chief Justice William) Rehnquist,
he's just going to get turned down," Marshall
said.
However, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow
Martin Anderson said the most interesting
part of yesterday's election was that "you're
seeing a continuation of the conservative
trend.
"The Democrats are very versatile and have
modified their position," Anderson said. "And
in doing so, they have gained more political
support."
Anderson cited the elections of Democrats
Ed Garvey in Wyoming and Bob Graham in
Florida as examples of conservative Demo
crats winning support.
Anderson, who served as domestic and eco
nomic policy adviser to the President in 1980
and 1981, said the change in committee chair

manships should not significantly alter policy
directions.
"If Kennedy takes over on the Judiciary
Committee, that would of course be a major
change," he said. "But 1 don't think Nunn and
the other chairmanships will constitute a
major change."
Though many political analysts contend
that an absence of major national themes
marked this year's elections, Anderson said
this was only true on the surface.
Very few Democrats spoke out in opposi
tion to the new tax package, to the Strategic
Defense Initiative or to Reagan's economic
policy, Anderson said.
"The lack of opposition doesn't mean a lack
of national themes," he said. "It simply means
there is general agreement on most big issues
â€” which is in itself a theme."
However, Political Science Prof. John Man
ley said that the election served more as a
"correction" of current administration think
ing than as a sign of agreement.
"What has happened is a correction which
should act to make further policy innovations
to the right more difficult," he said.
Manley said the election brought out
Reagan's effort to "translate his personal ap
peal into political sucessess at the state and
local level.
"That was an abysmal failure," he said.
Seymour Martin Lipset said the election
supported the "six-year itch" theory. The the
ory holds that in an off-year election, the pres
ident's party will "almost invariably take a bad
licking," said Lipset, a professor of political
science and sociology.
