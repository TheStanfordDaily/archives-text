Stanford's Centennial promises to be
"richer in opportunity than any milestone in
the past,'' according to a statement issued by
University President Donald Kennedy and the
Centennial Celebration Operating Committee
(CCOC).
The five-year-long Centennial Celebration
"is a chance for the Stanford community, par
ticularly the faculty, to show off its assets," said
CCOC Chair Gerald Lieberman, professor of
statistics and operations research.
"I hope the activities of the Centennial will
benefit students by allowing them to take ad
vantage of special programs," such as confer
ences, speeches and symposia, he said, adding
that events with direct student participation
are possible.
The Centennial Celebration will culminate
in 1991 — 100 years after Stanford first
opened its doors to students.
But for now the CCOC is concentrating its
efforts on the first event of the Centennial,
scheduled for May 14-16,1987 — the 100 th an
niversary of the laying of the cornerstone.
The Cornerstone Ceremony will feature
speakers of international prominence. Al
though Lieberman would not comment on
possible speakers, he said the event will stress
Stanford's past as well as its future possibili
ties.
In looking toward the future, Stanford is
strategically placed between the two worlds —

East and West — and "at the frontier of two
disciplinary domains — technological and
humanistic,'' Kennedy and Lieberman said in
their statement.
"If Stanford can bridge both, it can make a
special contribution to the solution of
mankind's most vexing problems," the state
ment said.
The formal declaration of the purposes and
oppotunities of the Centennial put forth seven
objectives for the celebration, including:
• "To commemorate the vision of the
founders, the events of history and the West
ern American heritage that together have
shaped Stanford's special character.
• "To celebrate both the pace and scale of
Stanford's accomplishments over the first cen
tury and to acknowledge those whose support
and dedication have made those accomplish
ments possible.
• "To use Stanford's strategic location and its
eminence as a catalyst for a fresh examination
of mankind's most vexing problems — and
from that examination, to develop analyses
and strategies for solution.
• "To re-explore the University's founding ob
jectives in the joint context of society's future
needs and Stanford's international status —
and then use that strategic vision to establish
priorities for teaching and research programs
that will accomplish those reaffirmed
purposes.
• "To rededicate this great private institution
to serving society and to heighten public un
derstanding of that mission.
