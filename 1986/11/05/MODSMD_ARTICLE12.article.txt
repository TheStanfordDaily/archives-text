## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Jet sale unnecessary

In a speech to the World Affairs Council on Friday,
Secretary of State George Shultz said the United States
would not tolerate Soviet shipment of high-performance
jet aircraft to Nicaragua.
Yet on that same day U.S. government officials an
nounced plans to offer F-5 jets for sale to Honduras, con
tradicting the United States' oft-stated position of not
starting an arms race in Central America.
Shultz denied this, saying that Honduras already has
jet fighters. Honduras currently possesses 14 French
made Super Mystere aircraft, which were purchased in
the 19505.
These may be obsolete, but Honduras still maintains
air superiority over all of Central America. The only
other jet fighters in the area are eight aging and little
used French Ouragans in El Salvador.
Honduras has long been asking the United States for
new planes, but every request has been declined with
the argument that Honduras didn't need new planes and
certainly couldn't afford them.

But now the United States sees a threat to Honduras
from the growing leftist army in Nicaragua and is con
vinced that Honduras needs new planes after all.
However, if the United States would merely be
"replacing one set of jet fighters with another," as Shultz
said, Honduras would gain little advantage, because it
can already boast of air superiority.
In addition, Honduras still does not have the means to
pay for the new jets, which carry an estimated price tag of
$350 million. Since Honduras would be at pains to find
the funding for the jets, this could bring economic prob
lems to the country.
Nicaragua and other surrounding countries may then
feel compelled to build up their air forces, contributing
to instability in the area. They would probably turn to the
Soviet Union or Israel, both of which the United States
already warned not to sell jets to Central America.
By selling jets to Honduras, the United States not only
would be straining the economic situation in Honduras,
but would be creating an unstable climate in Central
America as well.
