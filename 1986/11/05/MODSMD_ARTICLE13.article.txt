# Schools must protect religion

### 
I mast disagree with the belief of your editors that reli
gion should not stand in the way of children getting their
educations. According to the editorial in question, "School
Ruling Flawed" (Daily, Oct. 30), a federal court in Tennes
see decided that a school board "must provide the fun
damentalist families with free public education without
violating their First Amendment rights to religious
freedom." The editors said that "schools exist to expose stu
dents to various ideas and not to indoctrinate them into a
particular set of beliefs, whether religious or secular," but I
believe that schools cannot interfere with people's religious
freedom.

If a parent is really opposed to having his child read a
book because of religious reasons, he should be able to tell
his child not to read the book and then not have to stand
back and watch him fail the class because of it. That child
deserves an education, and the school must find a way to
give it to him without offending him or his parents. Of
course, this does not mean that a school should be forced to

stop teaching something just because a few people object to
it being taught, only that it should offer alternatives.
People might think that I also feel that a child should not
have to read about evolution because of his religion, but
evolution is an idea. The things these parents objected to
were ideas presented in works of literature. The teachers
were not trying to teach that all religions might be equal as
Anne Frank thought of in writing her diary (one of the ob
jections of the parents); they were using the book as an ex
ample of a type of literature. Surely there are other exam
ples of diaries or of books about people in isolation during
World War II that those teachers could have used for these
particular students.
Religion is something some people can feel very strongly
about, and when a person's religious freedom is violated in
this country, a great injustice is done. Just like Jehovah's Wit
nesses who were forced to salute the flag in their classes
earlier this century against their parents' wills, children in
Tennessee were being forced to read things their parents
did not want them to for religious reasons. Those Jehovah's
Witnesses were finally forced to send their children to
private schools in order not to break the law. Religious
freedom prevailed, however, and the law was overturned.
