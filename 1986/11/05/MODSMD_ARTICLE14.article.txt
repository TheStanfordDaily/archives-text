# Tiring of Kennedy's patience
## 
### 
We, the Black Student Union and the Stanford African Stu
dent Association, wish to express our concern at University
President Donald Kennedy's seemingly infinite patience
with the racist apartheid regime in South Africa. We feel this
to be especially inappropriate given the recent withdrawals
of General Motors and International Business Machines, two
of the first three Sullivan signatories. GM, upon whose
board sits the author of the Sullivan Principles, said it was
"disappointed in the pace of change in ending apartheid."
IBM cited "the deteriorating political and economic situa
tion in South Africa ... and its trading partners" among its
reasons for leaving. Apparently two leading American com
panies in South Africa have decided they cannot effect sig
nificant positive changes through continued operations.
Surely this must spur the Stanford Board of Trustees to

BSU & SASA

reconsider its always difficult-to-defend argument that com
panies can and do play a significant role in helping the
people to dismantle apartheid. The "freedom fighter corpo
ration" concept has lost considerable credibility and validity
now that the oft-lauded GM and IBM have withdrawn. Of
course, there are some notable exceptions to this disinvest
ment trend, including Hewlett Packard, which starkly an
nounced its plans to remain in South Africa "indefinitely,"
but the Board of Trustees should follow the example set by
IBM and GM and threaten to divest of all companies that

persist in such anti-social activities. While this is no easy task
given the membership of such companies' leading execu
tives on our board, it is our hope that the overall best inter
ests of this institution and its mission to facilitate the growth
of socially responsible human beings will take precedence.
Furthermore, difficult questions must be raised about the
board and Kennedy's commitment to respect the right of
black South Africans to determine their future and whether
they want foreign companies to disinvest. There is an ugly
kind of ambiguity that arises whenever the University is
asked to respond to the fact that most of apartheid's leading
opposition forces advocate disinvestment as one of the few
remaining peaceful ways to end apartheid. Reluctance to
heed the directives of black South Africans gives us consid
erable cause to wonder at the University's commitment to
addressing concerns voiced by black students, such as
Eurocentrism in the Western Culture requirement, the
sharp decrease in black enrollment, the tiny percentage of
black tenured professors, scant resources devoted to the
African and Afro-American Studies Program and police har
assment of black students. Finally, we request a response
from Kennedy to the concerns discussed herein and invite
the entire Stanford community to commit itself to the crea
tion of a truly multicultural university in every aspect, from
curricula options to investment policy, from faculty compo
sition to student admissions.
