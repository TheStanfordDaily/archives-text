# Zen and the art of midterms
## 
### 
It's that wonderful time of the quarter again when the li
braries are humming and full of people desperately trying
to find additional room in overcrowded skulls for oddly
shaped bits of knowledge as they come down to the prover
bial wire. In short, it's midterm time. I think that there are a
lot of people on this campus who try very hard to learn the
material for their classes, who try so hard, in fact, that it's a
wonder that they learn anything at all. Knowledge is a
strange commodity: the more you grasp at it, the harder it is
to catch. Zen Buddhism has some important things to say
about the problem of grasping at intangibles.

I am fascinated by Zen philosophy. Discussing Zen,
however, presents several problems for me. It is a Buddhist
sea, and not being a Buddhist or even having been raised in
a culture where Buddhism is practiced, I cannot feel Bud
dhist ideas with my bones. My understanding of Buddhism
is entirely intellectual, and that is dangerous since ap
parently one of the primary tenets of the religion is that fun
damental Buddhism cannot be understood intellectually,
but must be experienced. Nevertheless, it would be a shame
to avoid the topic because Buddhism, and Zen Buddhism in
particular, has some really nifty things to say about life, and
so I will proceed even though I am a blind man fumbling
about in a total void.
Things change. This fact seems so fundamental to Bud
dhism, and its ramifications as sounded out by the religion
are far-reaching. You see, because everything is in such a
constant state of flux, to try to tie anything down with an un
yielding concept of, say, a road, a sexual relationship or a
lemon meringue pie is to miss the essence of this road, this
lover or this delicious piece of pie. In short, all conventional
knowledge based on classification and logic falls far short of
capturing what this whole living business is about.
Taking this idea to its logical extreme, life at Stanford or
any university is completely absurd and pointless because
the entire focus of these institutions is the transmission of
such conventional and intellectual knowledge. Well, I've got
a degree in physics, and one thing an education in that field
taught me is that everything is an approximation, but that's
OK because approximations are still useful. The danger is
not in trying to fit models to the universe, but in trying to
make the universe fit into our models.
Another important facet of Buddhism is its idea of non
dualism. The basic idea is that things can't be chopped up
the way we like them to be when we classify them. A tree, if
divorced from everything else around it, is no longer a tree.
Everything is interconnected, and important connections
are obscured when we label things. The most common and
pervasive mistake we all make along these lines is thinking
that we are somehow separate from the rest of the world. I
was trying to figure out some way to communicate this idea
of being one with the world as I went to lunch this after
noon, and there, in front of the Daily office as 1 left Terman,
was this woman on a short lawn chair with one of the
campus' black squirrels on her lap. She was just sitting there
with the critter eating its lunch on her lap as if this were the
most natural thing in the world — which, after all, it was. I
can't put it any better than that: We are one with the world
even if we don't feel like it most of the time.
Zen Buddhism has a lot to say about being natural, being
one with the world and getting at those truths that are not

accessible by logical, conventional thought. Zen simply
means meditation, and the usual form that this meditation
takes in the Japanese branches of Zen is za-zen or sitting
meditation. It is important to understand that the sitting
around that a zen practitioner does is, I believe, an active,
disciplined reflecting of the world rather than a quest for an
unconscious, altered state of mind. There are no numbing
mantras advocated in this practice of meditation. Zen medi
tation is doing nothing in the very sense that a child is doing
nothing when he goes out to play, and that kind of purpose
less activity is important. Believe me, an hour of wandering
around the hills looking at flowers and trees can often help
you learn more than six hours of "intease" studying.
Zen is a quest for personal enlightenment, nirvana or
satori. Buddhists believe that there are truths that can be
derived intellectually which are, nevertheless, important.
The student of Zen is seeking to discover those truths in
himself. We all have had moments of sudden insight, and
what is sought in Zen is a similar moment of complete in
sight. It is a very personal quest, and the paradox of trying to
teach others to reach those kind of insights is a central prob
lem of Zen. This kind of truth is dependent on the individ
ual and the instant. I think that one point where Western
religions fail is they generally assume that there is some
kind of absolute truth that is true for everyone all of the
time. Satori is instantaneous and individual, and hence
more relevant to the quirks and kinks that an individual life
comprises.
Another important part of Zen philosophy is the idea of
not being attached to anything, which is not the same as
being detached from everything. It is, rather, more like the
idea of being free from expectations. This concept, unlike
other parts of Zen, is very easy to speak about and under
stand but it is nearly impossible to practice. We tend to clasp
onto the things that we feel are important, and so we hurt
when we lose them. Zen takes the attitude that it is possible
to value and cherish parts of the world without possessing
those parts; indeed, it rebukes the idea that anything can be
possessed in any sense at all.
Finally, Zen advocates a wholehearted approach to life. If
you are going to study, study. If you are going to eat, eat. It is
said in Zen philosophy that everyday life is nirvana, that the
ultimate truth is that we are living here and now. Thus, we
should throw ourselves completely into our endeavors, not
to be completely absorbed by them, but to be completely
released by them. Discipline, concentration and awareness
are, therefore, essential for living full, centered, peaceful
lives, and it is this truth that goes beyond one particular reli
gion and strikes at the heart of what life is all about. This
moment, this very instant, is the most important thing in the
universe right now. Wake up! Experience it! Put down the
newspaper for a moment and check out those legs. Or that
tree, or that squirrel or whatever it is that is happening
around you. It's a pretty neat place, and, best of all, you are
an inextricable part of it.
Zen is about life, and about freeing ourselves from the
shackles we place on ourselves. There is probably more to it
than that, but you and I are each going to have to find our
own way as usual. I'm not advocating that we all up and join
a monastery — I know that I certainly don't plan to — but
there is genuine wisdom in Buddhism and in Zen in particu
lar to which we, sadly, are not generally exposed in
America. So, have a good sit before studying this week and
try to make some room in that mind of yours before you
start trying to force things in. It will do you a world of good,
believe me.
And, yeah, check out those legs. Yowza!
