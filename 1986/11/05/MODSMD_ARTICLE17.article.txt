Letter intended
to hail advent
Clearly a church is not quite the
same as its pulpit, and had I been
aware of the many outreach programs
of the Stanford Memorial Church, I
would have modified my remarks in
my previous letter (Daily, Oct. 17),
possibly scrapped them and certainly
dropped the word "hibernation." But
having judged its character from
occasional attendance at Sunday ser
vice over many years (I regularly
attend elsewhere), my reactions were
as I expressed them in that letter.
Maybe I hit the wrong Sundays. But
taste in sermons, as in anything else,
cannot be legislated, and this is not an
argument I want to win. My motive in
writing that letter was to celebrate
something, not to damn. I heard the
voice of Tom Ambrogi in that pulpit as
an advent, and I wanted to tell people
about it. Obviously, it is impossible to
celebrate an advent without at the
same time implying that it is an im
provement on something, and for me
the voice of Ambrogi was good news
— a welcome, refreshing and long
absent note in that pulpit. But, that
said, I want to call this on, to add fuel
to this fire would serve no good
purpose, and I'm sorry for any hurt
feelings I caused or any misjudgments
I made But it's hard to keep quiet
about what one feels is an advent. Go

see for yourself.

Halloween story
no fun for frats
An article that appeared in The
Daily on Monday, Nov. 3 entitled,
"Frats Scare Kids for Fun" left me a bit
confused. Interpreted literally, the
headline seemed to me to hold very
negative implications. Were you trying
to praise the fraternities with this line,
or were you trying to twist the truth
into a pun with negative implications?
Granted, it was just Halloween, and
thus the clever headline should be
taken as a joke. However, 1 think that
The Daily has an incredible responsi
bility to the public. What you choose
to publish and how you word that
material dictates the message you
deliver. Catchy headlines are great,
but when used in this fashion, they
echo the National Enquirer.
In this case, an article that praises
the IFC, Kappa Sigma and Phi Delta
Theta for their service to the children
of Palo Alto is headed by a line that
could have very negative implications.
Furthermore, a sentence in the first
paragraph describes the fraternity
brothers as "ominously large frater
nity men." The dictionary defines
ominous, and I quote, "fortelling evil:
threatening." Did you mean to imply

that the fraternity men are evil?
All of this is to say that I feel The
Daily has not lived up to its responsi
bilities. As a newspaper, you should
he concerned to the utmost with such
unclear, and in this case, downright
slanderous verbiage. As a fraternity
brother myself, 1 urge The Daily to be
more precise and avoid this type of
misunderstanding in the future.

Rebholz biased
against Hoover
I take exception to some remarks
made by English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
(Daily, Oct. 31) regarding the Hoover
Institution. Apparently, he feels that
this institution should be divorced
from our University, much as the
Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) was separated from
Georgetown. I, however, fail to see
why this should occur.
The Hoover Institution is a tremen
dous resource to the Stanford com
munity with its archives, repeatedly
shown to be among the best in 20th
century history. The loss of this collec
tion to the University would greatly
hinder study by faculty and students
alike. Prof Rebholz, however, dis
misses this from his argument, imply-

ing that political connections are
worse than the value of this collection.
From what I can see, though, Prof.
Rebholz may be letting his political
views interfere with the situation.
Perhaps (as I see it) he feels threat
ened by Hoover and its conservative
tilt. In response, I would like to point
out that there are more than enough
liberal organizations on campus to
offset this tilt and that to threaten the
loss of the resources of Hoover be
cause of this is a bit absurd. And, if
this were a liberal institution under a
liberal administration, and Hoover
then had "daily political ties" to Wash
ington, would Prof. Rebholz then be
opposed? I find that highly unlikely. In
short, then, I feel that Prof. Rebholz'
stand is unwarranted — the loss of the
Hoover Institution's resources would
be too detrimental to Stanford Univer
sity.

tion to the University would greatly
hinder study by faculty and students
alike. Prof Rebholz, however, dis
misses this from his argument, imply-

ing that political connections are
worse than the value of this collection.
From what I can see, though, Prof.
Rebholz may be letting his political
views interfere with the situation.
Perhaps (as I see it) he feels threat
ened by Hoover and its conservative
tilt. In response, I would like to point
out that there are more than enough
liberal organizations on campus to
offset this tilt and that to threaten the
loss of the resources of Hoover be
cause of this is a bit absurd. And, if
this were a liberal institution under a
liberal administration, and Hoover
then had "daily political ties" to Wash
ington, would Prof. Rebholz then be
opposed? I find that highly unlikely. In
short, then, I feel that Prof. Rebholz'
stand is unwarranted — the loss of the
Hoover Institution's resources would
be too detrimental to Stanford Univer
sity.

Letter intended
to hail advent
Clearly a church is not quite the
same as its pulpit, and had I been
aware of the many outreach programs
of the Stanford Memorial Church, I
would have modified my remarks in
my previous letter (Daily, Oct. 17),
possibly scrapped them and certainly
dropped the word "hibernation." But
having judged its character from
occasional attendance at Sunday ser
vice over many years (I regularly
attend elsewhere), my reactions were
as I expressed them in that letter.
Maybe I hit the wrong Sundays. But
taste in sermons, as in anything else,
cannot be legislated, and this is not an
argument I want to win. My motive in
writing that letter was to celebrate
something, not to damn. I heard the
voice of Tom Ambrogi in that pulpit as
an advent, and I wanted to tell people
about it. Obviously, it is impossible to
celebrate an advent without at the
same time implying that it is an im
provement on something, and for me
the voice of Ambrogi was good news
— a welcome, refreshing and long
absent note in that pulpit. But, that
said, I want to call this on, to add fuel
to this fire would serve no good
purpose, and I'm sorry for any hurt
feelings I caused or any misjudgments
I made But it's hard to keep quiet
about what one feels is an advent. Go

see for yourself.

Halloween story
no fun for frats
An article that appeared in The
Daily on Monday, Nov. 3 entitled,
"Frats Scare Kids for Fun" left me a bit
confused. Interpreted literally, the
headline seemed to me to hold very
negative implications. Were you trying
to praise the fraternities with this line,
or were you trying to twist the truth
into a pun with negative implications?
Granted, it was just Halloween, and
thus the clever headline should be
taken as a joke. However, 1 think that
The Daily has an incredible responsi
bility to the public. What you choose
to publish and how you word that
material dictates the message you
deliver. Catchy headlines are great,
but when used in this fashion, they
echo the National Enquirer.
In this case, an article that praises
the IFC, Kappa Sigma and Phi Delta
Theta for their service to the children
of Palo Alto is headed by a line that
could have very negative implications.
Furthermore, a sentence in the first
paragraph describes the fraternity
brothers as "ominously large frater
nity men." The dictionary defines
ominous, and I quote, "fortelling evil:
threatening." Did you mean to imply

that the fraternity men are evil?
All of this is to say that I feel The
Daily has not lived up to its responsi
bilities. As a newspaper, you should
he concerned to the utmost with such
unclear, and in this case, downright
slanderous verbiage. As a fraternity
brother myself, 1 urge The Daily to be
more precise and avoid this type of
misunderstanding in the future.

Rebholz biased
against Hoover
I take exception to some remarks
made by English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
(Daily, Oct. 31) regarding the Hoover
Institution. Apparently, he feels that
this institution should be divorced
from our University, much as the
Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) was separated from
Georgetown. I, however, fail to see
why this should occur.
The Hoover Institution is a tremen
dous resource to the Stanford com
munity with its archives, repeatedly
shown to be among the best in 20th
century history. The loss of this collec
tion to the University would greatly
hinder study by faculty and students
alike. Prof Rebholz, however, dis
misses this from his argument, imply-

ing that political connections are
worse than the value of this collection.
From what I can see, though, Prof.
Rebholz may be letting his political
views interfere with the situation.
Perhaps (as I see it) he feels threat
ened by Hoover and its conservative
tilt. In response, I would like to point
out that there are more than enough
liberal organizations on campus to
offset this tilt and that to threaten the
loss of the resources of Hoover be
cause of this is a bit absurd. And, if
this were a liberal institution under a
liberal administration, and Hoover
then had "daily political ties" to Wash
ington, would Prof. Rebholz then be
