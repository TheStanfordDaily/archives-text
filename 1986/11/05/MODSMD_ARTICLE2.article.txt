# Democrats capture Senate; 'Duke' wins
## 
### MARK LEMLEY With wire reports 
In a major victory at the polls yesterday,
Democrats won a strong majority in the U.S.
Senate. Democrats won several upsets and
managed to avert important losses, including
the California seat of incumbent Sen. Alan
Cranston (D), who was appeared re-elected in a
close race against Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos).

In other areas, however, Democrats did not
fare so well. California Gov. George Deuk
mejian defeated Democratic challenger Tom
Bradley by a margin of nearly 2-to-l. Bradley,
the mayor of Los Angeles, lost in a rematch of
his 1982 race against Deukmejian. In that race,

however, Bradley lost by only 20,000 votes.
Across the nation, Republicans held their po
sition in the House of Representatives. Demo
crats were predicted to pick up six congres
sional seats, adding to the 253-180 majority they
held before the election. While the Republicans
remain the minority party in the House by a
substantial margin, Democrat gains were
nowhere near the average gain of 48 by opposi
tion parties in the sixth year of a presidential
term.
Perhaps the biggest loser in this year's Senate
elections was President Ronald Reagan. Reagan
had campaigned extensively for Republican
candidates, hoping to use his popularity to
retain Republican control of that body. With
Democrats in the majority, some say Reagan's
political agenda for the next two years may be
handicapped.

Republican National Committee Chairman
Frank Fahrenkopf chose to look at the bright
side for his party. "We did well in the House,
we did very well in the governors' races, and
we did well in the state legislatures," he said. "If
we lose the .Senate, well, that's three out of
four," a situation he described as "not bad."
Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
of Kansas conceded the loss of the Republican
majority last night, although he successfully
retained his own seat in the Senate. "It's a ques
tion of 53 or 55 Democrats," he noted.
Democrats lost only one seat yesterday. Re
publican Kit Bond defeated Democrat Harriett
Woods for the Missouri seat vacated by retiring
Sen. Tom Eagleton (D).
Democrats apparently picked up at least
eight seats formerly held by Republicans. New
Democratic victors were Bob Graham in

Florida, Tom Daschle in South Dakota, Terry
Sanford in North Carolina, Barbara Mikulski in
Maryland, Brock Adams in Washington, Wyche
Fowler in Georgia, Harry Reid in Nevada and
Kent Conrad in North Dakota. Early reports
showed Gov. John Evans leading Sen. Steve
Symms in Idaho, but the race was too close to
call early this morning.
Even it the Republicans retained the Idaho
seat, however, Democrats would hold a 54-46
majority in the Senate. Speculation before the
election had placed the Democrats with either
50 or 51 seats.
Other than Cranston's victory, Republicans
fared well in California. Besides Deukmejian's
re-election as governor, conservatives success
fully targeted Chief Justice Rose Bird and Asso
ciate Justices Joseph Grodin and Cruz Reynoso

for defeat. All three lost by substantial margins.
The other justices were retained.
Democrats won all other statewide offices in
California. Incumbent Leo McCarthy defeated
former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb for the post of
lieutenant governor, and Assemblyman Gray
Davis defeated Bill Campbell for the post of
controller. Attorney General John Van de
Kamp, Secretary of State March Fong Eu and
Treasurer Jess Unruh all won re-election by
large margins.
In local races, Republicans retained open As
sembly seats in the 20th District (where Bill
Dupplissea narrowly defeated Ed Bacciocco)
and 22nd District (where Chuck Quackenbush
defeated Democrat Brent Ventura). In the 21st
District, Assembleyman Byron Sher, a Demo
crat, was easily re-elected.
