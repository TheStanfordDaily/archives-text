## Have you hugged your three-armed mutant today? 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
Does the football team like having the Band play at its
games?
— A Fan
Just what exactly is the state of relations between our
potentially bowl-bound football team and the incomparable
LSJUMB? I did some asking around and the reaction of most
band members I spoke to was that team hatred of the band
was a foregone conclusion.
In a recent article in the Times Tribune, several members
of the football team were quoted as saying that Stanford's
fans and its band are not giving the team adequate support.
"We generally don't communicate with the football
team," I was told by Phil Cline, a four-year veteran of the
Band.
Cline said he felt that the Band was supporting the team
more than usual this year. He said that 40 Band members
paid their own way to make the trip to the Texas game more
than two weeks before the start of classes on the Farm.
And going into the Texas game the team had no record at
all.
While not indicating whether or not he liked the Band,
Stanford Coach Jack Elway told me that he was concerned
with the Band's behavior when it is on the road.
Specifically, Elway is still upset about a letter that the
Band wrote to the Oklahoma Daily before the Stanford-
Oklahoma game two years ago. The letter was a request that
the "psychotic, foaming-at-the-mouth University of Okla
homa fans" not throw things at the Band. It stated that "on
the road, we're not out there to cheer our team on to victory
(we'd all have long gray beards, even the women, before we
could succeed at that)."
"They're an end in themselves," Elway told me, saying
that the team and the Band have two different standards of
behavior.

"A football team could never get by with what the Band
does," Elway said.
Senior John Paye, who could be designated team
diplomat as well as quarterback, said that he likes the Band
and the music that it plays.
"I like the Band, I think they give us a lot of support," Paye
said.
Paye characterized the Band as "humorous, but
sometimes it gets out of hand." As an example, Paye specifi
cally cited the Band's letter to Oklahoma fans.
Both Elway and Paye said that the team.is unaware of the
Band's activities during the game. And as for the notion that
many students go to the games and leave after the Band's
halftime show, neither Elway nor Paye believe this ever to
be the case at a Stanford football game. (Although I will ad
mit, if no one else will, that during the team's leaner days I
have done this).
So the story is this:
As expected, the team doesn't pay any attention to the
Band during its games. Relations between the two have
been less tense now that the team is coming into its own.
During the Band's post-game show at the final home game
of the season Saturday, the team came out and piled on top
of the drum major. Cline said that they did not fall on top of
him full force.
Perhaps that characterizes the relationship.
Now for a less partisan issue.
Dear Bug Me,
On all the advertising posters for "La Ronde," an upcom
ing theater presentation by the Drama Department, there's
this picture that appears to be a naked man embracing a
naked female. It seems the woman, however, has three arms:
one right and two left. If you look closely, she has a right
and left arm around the man's neck and shoulders, but also
has a left arm, fully flexed, at her side. Is this a mistake, or
should the poster read "10 glittering scenes of seduction
with multi-armed mutants"?
— Three Confused Terrans

In a 1921 performance in Berlin, "La Ronde" was deemed
"terribly shocking" and any further performances in the
German language were forbidden, said Lee Fisher, the ad
ministrator of the Stanford Drama Department.
The play is apparently a series of 10 scenes ("glittering
scenes of seduction," that is) in which one character from
the previous scene appears in the following scene, with an
interesting combination ending up in the 10th scene.
Assistant Drama Prof. John Wilson is responsible for
the poster. Many of his colleagues have been asking him

BUG
ME

about the mutant issue. In explanation, he advanced for me
four theories, of which you can take your pick:
• There are actually two women in the picture.
• Wilson actually combined two drawings of Gustav Klimt,
an artist of the time at which the play was written. From
Klimt's original drawing to his final one, the arms were
moved.

• It was a mistake made at 3 a.m., when Wilson was trying to
get the posters done before the deadline.
• The play is really about three-armed mutants.
"La Ronde" runs tonight through Friday and next Wed
nesday through next Friday at 8 p.m. in the Little Theatre.
Tickets are available at the Tresidder Ticket Office.
Bring your own mutant.
Dear Bug Me,
What Bach piece did William Hurt play in "Children of a
Lesser God"?
— Dave C.
Paramount Pictures' press kit for the movie lists the piece
as Bach's Double Concerto in D Minor for Violins, Second
Movement, marked "Largo Ma Non Tanto."
Minutes after last week's report about legendary alum
Doodles Weaver hit campus, Chaparral Editor in Chief Josh
Weinstein wrote that his organization was the "real resident
expert" on Doodles and that Doodles was the patron saint
of the Chappie.
Weinstein pointed out to me that Doodles was also a chief
writer and editor, as well as editor in chief, of the Chaparral.
Doodles returned to the Chappie frequently over a period of
40 years after graduating from Stanford, giving many a
Chappie a start in the entertainment industry and providing
financial support to the magazine.
According to "Spike Jones and his City Slickers: An Il
lustrated Biography," Doodles did indeed turn up in the
arms of a campus statue being unveiled in the presence of
former U.S. President and Stanford alum and trustee Her
bert Hoover. Doodles emerged from the cover "barking like
a seal."
Doodles' film career included such movies as "Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes," Hitchcock's "The Birds," and Jerry Lewis'
"The Errand Boy." Although Doodles died in 1983 at the
age of 70, his memory is revered by the current generation
of Chappies, Weinstein said.

was a foregone conclusion.
In a recent article in the Times Tribune, several members
of the football team were quoted as saying that Stanford's
fans and its band are not giving the team adequate support.
"We generally don't communicate with the football
team," I was told by Phil Cline, a four-year veteran of the
Band.
Cline said he felt that the Band was supporting the team
more than usual this year. He said that 40 Band members
paid their own way to make the trip to the Texas game more
than two weeks before the start of classes on the Farm.
And going into the Texas game the team had no record at
all.
While not indicating whether or not he liked the Band,
Stanford Coach Jack Elway told me that he was concerned
with the Band's behavior when it is on the road.
Specifically, Elway is still upset about a letter that the
Band wrote to the Oklahoma Daily before the Stanford-
Oklahoma game two years ago. The letter was a request that
the "psychotic, foaming-at-the-mouth University of Okla
homa fans" not throw things at the Band. It stated that "on
the road, we're not out there to cheer our team on to victory
(we'd all have long gray beards, even the women, before we
could succeed at that)."
"They're an end in themselves," Elway told me, saying
that the team and the Band have two different standards of
behavior.

"A football team could never get by with what the Band
does," Elway said.
Senior John Paye, who could be designated team
diplomat as well as quarterback, said that he likes the Band
and the music that it plays.
"I like the Band, I think they give us a lot of support," Paye
said.
Paye characterized the Band as "humorous, but
sometimes it gets out of hand." As an example, Paye specifi
cally cited the Band's letter to Oklahoma fans.
Both Elway and Paye said that the team.is unaware of the
Band's activities during the game. And as for the notion that
many students go to the games and leave after the Band's
halftime show, neither Elway nor Paye believe this ever to
be the case at a Stanford football game. (Although I will ad
mit, if no one else will, that during the team's leaner days I
have done this).
So the story is this:
As expected, the team doesn't pay any attention to the
Band during its games. Relations between the two have
been less tense now that the team is coming into its own.
During the Band's post-game show at the final home game
of the season Saturday, the team came out and piled on top
of the drum major. Cline said that they did not fall on top of
him full force.
Perhaps that characterizes the relationship.
Now for a less partisan issue.
Dear Bug Me,
On all the advertising posters for "La Ronde," an upcom
ing theater presentation by the Drama Department, there's
this picture that appears to be a naked man embracing a
naked female. It seems the woman, however, has three arms:
one right and two left. If you look closely, she has a right
and left arm around the man's neck and shoulders, but also
has a left arm, fully flexed, at her side. Is this a mistake, or
should the poster read "10 glittering scenes of seduction
with multi-armed mutants"?
— Three Confused Terrans

In a 1921 performance in Berlin, "La Ronde" was deemed
"terribly shocking" and any further performances in the
German language were forbidden, said Lee Fisher, the ad
ministrator of the Stanford Drama Department.
The play is apparently a series of 10 scenes ("glittering
scenes of seduction," that is) in which one character from
the previous scene appears in the following scene, with an
interesting combination ending up in the 10th scene.
Assistant Drama Prof. John Wilson is responsible for
the poster. Many of his colleagues have been asking him

BUG
ME

about the mutant issue. In explanation, he advanced for me
four theories, of which you can take your pick:
• There are actually two women in the picture.
• Wilson actually combined two drawings of Gustav Klimt,
an artist of the time at which the play was written. From
Klimt's original drawing to his final one, the arms were
moved.

• It was a mistake made at 3 a.m., when Wilson was trying to
get the posters done before the deadline.
• The play is really about three-armed mutants.
"La Ronde" runs tonight through Friday and next Wed
nesday through next Friday at 8 p.m. in the Little Theatre.
Tickets are available at the Tresidder Ticket Office.
Bring your own mutant.
Dear Bug Me,
What Bach piece did William Hurt play in "Children of a
Lesser God"?
— Dave C.
Paramount Pictures' press kit for the movie lists the piece
as Bach's Double Concerto in D Minor for Violins, Second
Movement, marked "Largo Ma Non Tanto."
Minutes after last week's report about legendary alum
Doodles Weaver hit campus, Chaparral Editor in Chief Josh
Weinstein wrote that his organization was the "real resident
expert" on Doodles and that Doodles was the patron saint
of the Chappie.
Weinstein pointed out to me that Doodles was also a chief
writer and editor, as well as editor in chief, of the Chaparral.
Doodles returned to the Chappie frequently over a period of
40 years after graduating from Stanford, giving many a
Chappie a start in the entertainment industry and providing
financial support to the magazine.
According to "Spike Jones and his City Slickers: An Il
lustrated Biography," Doodles did indeed turn up in the
arms of a campus statue being unveiled in the presence of
former U.S. President and Stanford alum and trustee Her
bert Hoover. Doodles emerged from the cover "barking like
a seal."
Doodles' film career included such movies as "Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes," Hitchcock's "The Birds," and Jerry Lewis'
"The Errand Boy." Although Doodles died in 1983 at the
age of 70, his memory is revered by the current generation
of Chappies, Weinstein said.
