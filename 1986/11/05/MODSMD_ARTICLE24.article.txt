# Conference looks at Soviet Bloc status

### KACEY FITZPATRICK 
The Stanford Center for Russian and
East European Studies (CREES) last
weekend hosted a conference marking
the 30th anniversary of the Hungarian
revolution. Called "Hungary 1956-
1986: Thirty Years of Eastern Europe,"
the conference featured prominent
scholars from the United States and
abroad speaking in four sessions on
Friday and Saturday.
CREES Director Alexander Dallin,
professor of history and political sci
ence, organized the conference this
year.
"This occasion marked the 30th an
niversary of the Hungarian revolt of
1956," he said. "The conference pro
vided us with an opportunity for some
reminiscence on the events and the
people who had been there and partic
ipated. It set the stage for a review of
what has gone on in Eastern Europe
since 1956, and it included discussions
on American foreign policies."
One session of the conference was
titled "Eastern Europe, 1967-1986."
Kenneth Jowitt of UC-Berkeley

opened the platform with a discussion
of Soviet factors and influences within
the Eastern European countries, possi
bilities and potential for reform of the
political systems and changes that have
taken place since the 20th Communist
Party Congress in 1956.
"Kruschev did make a significant po
litical reform by replacing Stalin's
castle-like party system with Lenin's
court-like system," Jowitt said, explain
ing that a casde-like regime is charac
terized by elite rule, with the elite
"distinctly set apart from the rest of so
ciety by a large moat— Castles also
assault their surrounding society."
The only country now functioning
under such a casde-like regime is Al
bania, according to Jowitt. All other
Eastern European countries run, to
some extent, under a court-like
regime, he said. Hungary, which had
its revolution 30 years ago and is the
only Eastern European country to un
dergo some economic reform, is the
more benign case in this spectrum of
casde-like characteristics. Romania is the
most malignant example, Jowitt said.
"Court-like characteristics involve

regimes which are political mo
nopolies. ... The Party rules. There
is no 'citizenship,'" he said, there is
only party membership.
Kruschev's regime, Jowitt said, dif
fered from the Stalinist regime in one
major way: It "rejects the tenet of class
war as the intensifying basis of political
action." In so doing a Kruschev regime
disarms itself of the ability to attack its
own people. The one question which
then remains without a rational an
swer, Jowitt said, is "Why is it that (such
a regime) doesn't govern instead of
dominate?"
The second speaker at the session,
Peter Hardi of the Institute for East-
West Studies, discussed the relation
ship between economic progress and
democracy, addressing in particular
the question of whether democracy is
a prerequisite for economic progress
or vice-versa.
According to Hardi: "Change in the
economic and social structure (of a
country) is necessary for reform in the
political framework." Economic
prosperity may then in turn follow po
litical reform. These changes do not

just happen on their own, however,
but first require that there be real
trauma and revolution, he said.
Sarah Terry of Tufts University then
continued the session with a lecture on
the current economic status of the
countries. She pointed out that eco
nomic indicators in Eastern Bloc
countries are way down and have been
falling markedly and consistently for
the past 30 years.
"Consumption takes precedence
over production," she said. "Instead of
increasing exports, they decrease im
ports. ... Eastern European countries
are no longer competetive in world
markets."
Although the next generation of
leaders in the Eastern European
countries will challenge Gorbachev
and be more nationalistically oriented,
conditions for change still aren't favor
able, Terry said. "It's difficult to be op
timistic about the possibilities for eco
nomic reform."
The last speaker in the session was
Charles Gati of Columbia University,
who discussed the existing political
system in the Soviet Union. Surpris

ingly enough, it is a two-party system.
According to Gati, one party (CPSU
No. 1) stresses ideological rigidity,
cohesion and uniformity within the
block, economic centralization and a
high-tension policy toward the United
States, and it is prepared to make vast
military expenditures.
The other party (CPSU No. 2)
recognizes the necessity for some
change, stresses economic streamlin
ing, tolerance for differences and a
low-tension policy toward the West. It
is interested in arms control measures
and is willing to accept deconcentra
tion of the Soviet Bloc.
In contrasting the two parties, Gati
said that "both parties are led by Mik
hail Gorbachev." He then proposed
that "perhaps on Mondays, Wednes
days and Fridays he (Gorbachev)
heads the first party, and on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Saturdays he runs the
other. I have no idea what he does on
Sundays, but certainly that must deter
mine the balance."
Gati discussed the ambiguity of So
viet politics, citing several occasions on

which the two parties have con
tradicted themselves and each other in
addressing the same issues. How does
this Soviet division and ambiguity af
fect the Eastern Bloc countries?
"Newspapers in the GDR, Hungary,
Poland and Romania print lines from
CPSU No. 2, and those in Bulgaria and
Czechoslovakia publicize what CPSU
No. 1 has to say. They hear what they
want to hear," Gati said. "Eastern
European leaders have learned that
when the cat's away, the mice can play.
They haven't yet learned that there's a
Gorbachev."
The Eastern European countries
now have much more leeway in deter
mining their own direction than they
once had.
"Although they cannot leave the
Warsaw Pact or establish a free society
any more than they could in 1956, they
do have a lot more elbow room," Gati
said. "Eastern European leaders have
learned that they are not there just to
implement Soviet policies. They also
represent the interests of their own
people."

ipated. It set the stage for a review of
what has gone on in Eastern Europe
since 1956, and it included discussions
on American foreign policies."
One session of the conference was
titled "Eastern Europe, 1967-1986."
Kenneth Jowitt of UC-Berkeley

opened the platform with a discussion
of Soviet factors and influences within
the Eastern European countries, possi
bilities and potential for reform of the
political systems and changes that have
taken place since the 20th Communist
Party Congress in 1956.
"Kruschev did make a significant po
litical reform by replacing Stalin's
castle-like party system with Lenin's
court-like system," Jowitt said, explain
ing that a casde-like regime is charac
terized by elite rule, with the elite
"distinctly set apart from the rest of so
ciety by a large moat— Castles also
assault their surrounding society."
The only country now functioning
under such a casde-like regime is Al
bania, according to Jowitt. All other
Eastern European countries run, to
some extent, under a court-like
regime, he said. Hungary, which had
its revolution 30 years ago and is the
only Eastern European country to un
dergo some economic reform, is the
more benign case in this spectrum of
casde-like characteristics. Romania is the
most malignant example, Jowitt said.
"Court-like characteristics involve

regimes which are political mo
nopolies. ... The Party rules. There
is no 'citizenship,'" he said, there is
only party membership.
Kruschev's regime, Jowitt said, dif
fered from the Stalinist regime in one
major way: It "rejects the tenet of class
war as the intensifying basis of political
action." In so doing a Kruschev regime
disarms itself of the ability to attack its
own people. The one question which
then remains without a rational an
swer, Jowitt said, is "Why is it that (such
a regime) doesn't govern instead of
dominate?"
The second speaker at the session,
Peter Hardi of the Institute for East-
West Studies, discussed the relation
ship between economic progress and
democracy, addressing in particular
the question of whether democracy is
a prerequisite for economic progress
or vice-versa.
According to Hardi: "Change in the
economic and social structure (of a
country) is necessary for reform in the
political framework." Economic
prosperity may then in turn follow po
litical reform. These changes do not

just happen on their own, however,
but first require that there be real
trauma and revolution, he said.
Sarah Terry of Tufts University then
continued the session with a lecture on
the current economic status of the
countries. She pointed out that eco
nomic indicators in Eastern Bloc
countries are way down and have been
falling markedly and consistently for
the past 30 years.
"Consumption takes precedence
over production," she said. "Instead of
increasing exports, they decrease im
ports. ... Eastern European countries
are no longer competetive in world
markets."
Although the next generation of
leaders in the Eastern European
countries will challenge Gorbachev
and be more nationalistically oriented,
conditions for change still aren't favor
able, Terry said. "It's difficult to be op
timistic about the possibilities for eco
nomic reform."
The last speaker in the session was
Charles Gati of Columbia University,
who discussed the existing political
system in the Soviet Union. Surpris

ingly enough, it is a two-party system.
According to Gati, one party (CPSU
No. 1) stresses ideological rigidity,
cohesion and uniformity within the
block, economic centralization and a
high-tension policy toward the United
States, and it is prepared to make vast
military expenditures.
The other party (CPSU No. 2)
recognizes the necessity for some
change, stresses economic streamlin
ing, tolerance for differences and a
low-tension policy toward the West. It
is interested in arms control measures
and is willing to accept deconcentra
tion of the Soviet Bloc.
In contrasting the two parties, Gati
said that "both parties are led by Mik
hail Gorbachev." He then proposed
that "perhaps on Mondays, Wednes
days and Fridays he (Gorbachev)
heads the first party, and on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Saturdays he runs the
other. I have no idea what he does on
Sundays, but certainly that must deter
mine the balance."
Gati discussed the ambiguity of So
viet politics, citing several occasions on

which the two parties have con
tradicted themselves and each other in
addressing the same issues. How does
this Soviet division and ambiguity af
fect the Eastern Bloc countries?
"Newspapers in the GDR, Hungary,
Poland and Romania print lines from
CPSU No. 2, and those in Bulgaria and
Czechoslovakia publicize what CPSU
No. 1 has to say. They hear what they
want to hear," Gati said. "Eastern
European leaders have learned that
when the cat's away, the mice can play.
They haven't yet learned that there's a
Gorbachev."
The Eastern European countries
now have much more leeway in deter
mining their own direction than they
once had.
"Although they cannot leave the
Warsaw Pact or establish a free society
any more than they could in 1956, they
do have a lot more elbow room," Gati
said. "Eastern European leaders have
learned that they are not there just to
implement Soviet policies. They also
represent the interests of their own
people."
The Stanford Center for Russian and
East European Studies (CREES) last
weekend hosted a conference marking
the 30th anniversary of the Hungarian
revolution. Called "Hungary 1956-
1986: Thirty Years of Eastern Europe,"
the conference featured prominent
scholars from the United States and
abroad speaking in four sessions on
Friday and Saturday.
CREES Director Alexander Dallin,
professor of history and political sci
ence, organized the conference this
year.
"This occasion marked the 30th an
niversary of the Hungarian revolt of
1956," he said. "The conference pro
vided us with an opportunity for some
reminiscence on the events and the
people who had been there and partic
ipated. It set the stage for a review of
what has gone on in Eastern Europe
