## Hagar makes it in Van Halen 
### LIZ GOODMAN Staff writer 
The setting was the Cow Palace, the
theme was a rock concert and Act One
was Van Halen, making four appear
ances this past weekend with Sammy
Hagar playing his new leading role.
On his own, Hagar had already been
an excellent performer, quietly achiev
ing platinum success and always wildly
energetic in concert. But with the Van
Halen crew he seemed as if he had fi
nally found his niche. Performing with
his new group for the first time in his
hometown, Hagar couldn't have been
more pleased with the audience's tre
mendous respoase.
Those fans who went expecting
something like past Van Halen tours
might have been suprised though, be
cause Hagar adds a completely differ
ent flavor to the show.
Gone are the creative dialogues and
skillful acrobatics of David Lee Roth.
Instead, Hagar displays a more street
level humor, running around the stage
like a hyperactive child, and occas
sionally slipping into the role of a
head-banging rock 'n' roller. This
doesn't give the show the color and

fluidity that Roth provided, but Hagar
makes up for this with his raw enthusi
asm.
In terms of format, however, this
"5150" tour was almost exactly like
past shows. The trademarks of a Van
Halen concert are the extended solo
performances interspersed throughout
the songs. Alex Van Halen went first
with his drum solo, followed by bassist
Michael Anthony, who played his Jack-
Daniels-bottle-shaped bass while
stomping up and down the stage like a
barbarian.
Though neither of their efforts
showed incredible amounts of ingenu
ity, they were at least mildly entertain
ing. The true reason the Van Halen
show includes such long solo in
terludes, however, is to show off the
renowned virtuosity of guitarist Eddie
Van Halen. Undisputably "gymnas
tically" talented, Van Halen plays with a
speed and clarity most guitarists only
dream of. In his solos, though, he tried
to balance his technical superiority
with feeling and soul.
The group did manage to play some
songs between their solos. While a few
older Van Halen tunes such as
"Panama" and "Ain't Talking About

Luvc were included, most of the ma
terial performed was from this year's
"5150" album or from Hagar's most
recent LP, "VOA."
The only disagreeable portions of
the show were Hagar's occasional tact
less remarks about his predecessor,
ex-lead singer (and now solo act)
Roth. But Hagar was also responsible
for the concert's best moments, as
during "When Love Comes Walking
In," when he slowed the pace and
strapped on his own guitar. Here
Hagar showed the emotional sensitiv
ity that the song's lyrics call for. And
later, he created a dramatic scene
when he climbed up the ramps strung
near the ceiling of the arena. He hung
off the edge with no net beneath him,
holding onto wires for support; it was a
breathtaking stunt, showing that Hagar
has absolutely no fear of heights.
The show closed with Led Zep
pelin's classic "Rock and Roll, and
both the audience and the new Van
Halen seemed more than pleased with
their new lineup. But the true test of
Van Halen's replacement of Roth with
Hagar will come during Act Two, when
Roth and his new band pull into town
in mid-December.
