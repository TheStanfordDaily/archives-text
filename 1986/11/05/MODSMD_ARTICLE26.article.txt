# Drama asks disturbing questions
## 
### PETER MORGAN 
Is there any way of looking at the Holocaust as an admira
ble event in the history of mankind? Most of us would say
"no." And most of us would say this without even thinking
twice about it. Our condemnation of such mass murder is so
widespread, so agreed upon, that we never really think
about it. But while we may be right in our unhesitating "no,"
do we know why? For example, doesn't the same "no" apply
to Vietnam, Cambodia and the Middle East? Here many still
say "no," but not as many as with the Nazis. Another exam
ple: Doesn't the same "no" apply to the Native Americans of
Colonial days and the prisoners in San Quentin? Now the
issue is much less clear, and the few people who think
about such things disagree quite a bit. Finally: What about
iiuman persecution of cockroaches? At this point the discus
sion becomes as ludicrous as it was serious before.
The point is that in most societies the government
handles all the distasteful tasks of human existence, espe
cially violence to other humans. How often do you think
about your tax dollars being used to build weapons, weap
ons that are in turn used to kill human beings just like your
self? Not very often, if you're like me. I let the president, sec
retary of state and Pentagon make the critical decisions
about which people in which countries we'll tolerate and
which we won't.

Which is to say that I, like most Americans, am very lazy in
my morality. 1 support all the accepted moral standards and
pay lip service to them in public, but 1 don't know much
about them because I never have to face difficult moral situ
ations in my insulated culture. What do I really know about
killing? About death? How does it affect me personally, both
emotionally and rationally? I simply don't know.
What I do know is that I'm thinking a lot more about these
issues since seeing Wallace Shawn's play "Aunt Dan and
Lemon" at the Magic Theater. This extremely powerful
drama confuses the lazy mind so thoroughly by blurring the
serious with the ludicrous that one is forced to either re
learn one's fundamental beliefs in a much more profound
way, or to give up these beliefs altogether. And since the
main belief in question is the respect for life, "Aunt Dan and
Lemon" is a very disturbing evening at the theater.
The play opens with a pretty, young girl (Maud
Winchester) with a very sweet voice excitedly welcoming
the audience to the theater. She tells us her nickname is
Lemon and that she drinks brighdy colored drinks because
she has a terminal illness. We learn that she lives alone in a
London apartment and has had no real life, only what her
family related to her as a child. While her parents had some
influence, it was her Aunt Dan (a nickname for a family

friend named Danielle) who shaped her character by regal
ing her with wild stories of politics, sex, money and murder.
The bulk of the play consists of flashbacks of Lemon lis
tening to Aunt Dan (Carla Spindt) recount her adventures
and beliefs, so we hear lurid descriptions of orgiastic parties
in sleazy bars as well as heated defenses of Kissinger's
bombing policy in Vietnam. At the end of the play we
return to the present, where Lemon sums up what Aunt Dan
meant to her. This leads her to talk about her attraction to
the Holocaust and the Nazis. She expands her thoughts to

tell how everyone would kill any social minority if that
minority became irritating enough, and that we should
thank the officials who take responsibility for eliminating
these undesirables, since they let the public lead a happy,
non-violent life.
It's in this last half-hour alone onstage with Lemon that
the audience becomes trapped in its lazy reasoning. Shawn
has allowed his characters to be laughed at early on for their
silliness and illogical thinking. Consequently, the audience
doesn't agree with Dan's strange rationale but believes she
is emotionally sincere. The same holds true for Lemon and
the rest of the characters: All are very honest and sincere. As
these characters become less silly and more logical,
however, the audience finds itself no longer looking down
on them with knowing smiles, but staring them straight in

the eye with ignorant vacancy. What seemed a clear-cut
issue of good and evil becomes a very blurred double stan
dard. It's an engrossing, unsettling feeling to find that one
doesn't know anything about something as basic as the
taking of life.
Unfortunately, the show is very boring and irritating
before it gets engrossing and unsettling. It's two hours long,
without an intermission, and the first 90 minutes rarely hold
interest. A 20-minute sequence involving a seduction and a
murder nearly put me to sleep. The last 30 minutes with
Lemon, however, make the time spent worthwhile. Maud
Winchester finally seems to become the excited young girl
intent on telling us all her thoughts, and, between her per
formance and Wallace Shawn's writing, it's one of the most
mesmerizing moments I've experienced in or out of a

theater.
This show is not for everyone. If you want to turn off your
mind and relax, stay well away from the Magic Theatre until
this play closes. You'll walk in lazy and walk out confused.
It's not that Wallace Shawn wants us to go out and get some
"hands-on" experience in murder. I believe he wants us to
think more about our moral self-delusions and how we
maintain them by letting our governments handle the dirty
work of disposing of "undesirables" in prisons, coffins and
ditches. The play Isn't about the Holocaust anymore than it's
about Vietnam or cockroaches. It's just that the Holocaust is
such a sensitive issue that it allows Shawn a quick way into
our heart. Once inside, he very deftly and painfully shows
how much moral decay has occured through our laziness. I
suggest you see for yourself.
