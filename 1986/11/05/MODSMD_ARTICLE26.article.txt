# Drama asks disturbing questions

### PETER MORGAN 
Is there any way of looking at the Holocaust as an admira
ble event in the history of mankind? Most of us would say
"no." And most of us would say this without even thinking
twice about it. Our condemnation of such mass murder is so
widespread, so agreed upon, that we never really think
about it. But while we may be right in our unhesitating "no,"
do we know why? For example, doesn't the same "no" apply
to Vietnam, Cambodia and the Middle East? Here many still
say "no," but not as many as with the Nazis. Another exam
ple: Doesn't the same "no" apply to the Native Americans of
Colonial days and the prisoners in San Quentin? Now the
issue is much less clear, and the few people who think
about such things disagree quite a bit. Finally: What about
iiuman persecution of cockroaches? At this point the discus
sion becomes as ludicrous as it was serious before.
The point is that in most societies the government
handles all the distasteful tasks of human existence, espe
cially violence to other humans. How often do you think
about your tax dollars being used to build weapons, weap
ons that are in turn used to kill human beings just like your
self? Not very often, if you're like me. I let the president, sec
retary of state and Pentagon make the critical decisions
about which people in which countries we'll tolerate and
which we won't.

Which is to say that I, like most Americans, am very lazy in
my morality. 1 support all the accepted moral standards and
pay lip service to them in public, but 1 don't know much
about them because I never have to face difficult moral situ
ations in my insulated culture. What do I really know about
killing? About death? How does it affect me personally, both
emotionally and rationally? I simply don't know.
What I do know is that I'm thinking a lot more about these
issues since seeing Wallace Shawn's play "Aunt Dan and
Lemon" at the Magic Theater. This extremely powerful
drama confuses the lazy mind so thoroughly by blurring the
serious with the ludicrous that one is forced to either re
learn one's fundamental beliefs in a much more profound
way, or to give up these beliefs altogether. And since the
main belief in question is the respect for life, "Aunt Dan and
Lemon" is a very disturbing evening at the theater.
The play opens with a pretty, young girl (Maud
Winchester) with a very sweet voice excitedly welcoming
the audience to the theater. She tells us her nickname is
Lemon and that she drinks brighdy colored drinks because
she has a terminal illness. We learn that she lives alone in a
London apartment and has had no real life, only what her
family related to her as a child. While her parents had some
influence, it was her Aunt Dan (a nickname for a family
