## Card to play UOP; NorPac title on line 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
In its month-long run at the Northern Pacific
Conference title, the Stanford field hockey team
has won eight consecutive games. However, if the
No. 16 Cardinal cannot win number nine today
against 20th-ranked University of the Pacific in
Stockton, the previous eight may have been for
nought.

Because the major field hockey powers are
generally Eastern schools and only 12 teams
make the NCAA playoffs, the sole West Coast rep
resentative is usually the NorPac champion. And
because UOP is 5-1 in the NorPac and Stanford is
4-1-1 with only one game to go after today, it is
not hard to figure the magnitude of today's con
test.
"For both teams it's a must game," UOP Coach
Carla Konet said. "There's a lot at stake: the con
ference championship and a berth in (NCAA)
regionals."
A Tiger win would clinch the NorPac title. A
Cardinal victory coupled with a win or tie against
last-place Chico State on Friday would give Stan
ford the championship.
If the two teams finish the season even, Stan
ford would have the edge due to two wins over
UOP (one in league play and one in the California
Invitational Tournament) and a better overall
record (10-4-1 to 7-5-0).
UOP began the year with an 0-3 Eastern road
trip, losing to No. 1 North Carolina, No. 8
Westchester and No. 13 Temple. The Tigers have

lost only two games since â€” both to Stanford.
"We've had a real strange year," Konet said.
"We started the season minus three starters we
thought we would have, so we started by kind of
rebuilding. We went out East and really didn't
know what we had."
The Tigers' adversity didn't end with their trip
back East, however. Injuries have limited UOF to
only 11 healthy players in the last five games. That
means no substitutes, although Konet expects to
have some reserves available today.
Stanford had its problems on the Atlantic Coast
as well, going 1-3 on a late-September swing
against four nationally ranked teams. The Card
inal has gone 8-1 since, relying on a defense that
recorded seven straight shutouts and a recently
potent offense.
"We're playing as more of a team, more attack
oriented. We've had more chances at goal," Stan
ford Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "They're getting
better with each game. Hopefully we can pull out
these last two games and hit our peak at nation
als."
Both teanjs boast premier sophomore
goalkeepers. UOP's Shari Megginson has made
163 saves and has a 1.83 goals-against average,
while Stanford's Karen Jones has a .933 average
and eight shutouts.
"I think very definitely it will be a low-scoring
game," Johnson said. "The two teams' defenses
are playing well now, especially the goalkeepers."
"The teams are close," Konet said. "The goalies
are the best in the conference, and the statistics
prove that. I don't think you can get two more
evenly matched teams."
Kat Thomas is Stanford's leading scorer with
six goals. After that, the Cardinal attack is
balanced among Andi Wolpert, Dana Fleming,
Maree Chung and Laura Gartland, all with three
goals.
Donna Bonino paces the UOP offense with six
goals, but the player Johnson is most worried
about is center-halfback Leigh McNiff, an All-
NorPac selection last year.
