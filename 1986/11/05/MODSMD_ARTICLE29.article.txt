# IM football creates rivalries; dorms, frats, grads all play

Junior John Pacheco wears his sunglasses at night.
Sometimes, he can't stop the music. Renegade, scholar â€”
John Pacheco plays intramural football.
Pacheco, a sturdy, soft-spoken lad with an uncanny
resemblance to Robert Blake of "Baretta" fame, plays for a
B-league football team called the Atomic Dogs.
The Dogs, as they affectionately call themselves, are with
out question an enthusiastic group. Shrieks of "Those dogs
will bite you" and "Chain that dog" often echo from the
sidelines.
It's "Nuclear Winter'" on defense, and the "Aftershock" on
offense. When one member noticed an actual canine care
package upon the field, cries of "the sign of the dog, the sign
of the dog" rang forth.

It's a sordid lot, but they seem to have a good time which,
ultimately, is the theme of the Stanford IM football leagues
"It's a way to release some anxiety, break the monotony
of studying," Pacheco said. "No one tikes it too seriously."
"I just like being one of the Dogs," added senior Erik
Giske Giske, an industrial engineering major and IM quar
terback, also admitted a certain fondness for "the post-game
celebrations."
Well, there you have it. A bunch of guys who like to exer
cise on Fridays while enjoying the fellowship of mankind.
Do they listen to Burl Ives after the game? Mr. Rogers will
take a walk around the neighborhood on occasion.
What I mean to say is this: Is this just an amorphous blob
of yapping Chihuahuas, or is there some bite to accompany
their sideline bark?
"It's great to beat fraternities," senior Dog Marcos Ochoa
said. "They come out all gung-ho and fired up. You go out
there and put them in their place."
Thanks Marcos.

Yes, it's true, IM football can he competitive as well.
Indeed, all the Atomic Dogs interviewed acknowledged that
beating a fraternity is the most rewarding and coveted ac
complishment on the IM pastures. The Theta Delts,
however, were not mentioned.
IM football for the Kappa Sigs means "getting the house
together and seeing the team come together," according to
junior Ted Morris. Morris said that the Kappa Sig team
practices once or twice a week and "eats together on game
days."
With such an organized and serious approach to the
game, it's no small wonder that the Kappa Sigs themselves
enjoy destroying a particular team or two. "Grad schools,"
Morris allowed.
Sophomore Sigma Alpha Epsilon pledge Ken Hosac was
more specific: "Grad schools, especially the business
school.
"They, by nature, are highstrung, cocky and picky in gen
eral," Hosac continued. "They don't make the game fun;
therefore, when you beat them, that's the fun."
Hey, this is getting fun. A trend of sorts. Perhaps, the busi
ness school may want to dismantle a fraternity or six in
return. Or even still, maybe Hewlett-Packard plays a little
ball.
"I don't think the people here care whether it's a frat or a
freshman team, as long as a team is out there, the biz school
will want to whomp' them," junior Steven Bakalar said.
All vendettas and fun aside, it's playoff time in the world
of intramurals. It's an occasion when the X's and O's collide
mightily. No longer will innocent bystanders watch an at
tempted stiff-arm (remember, it's touch football).
Nary a statue of liberty nor a dive up the middle will be
witnessed. No, it's the playoffs, and that translates to skill,
the death to IM creativity. Oh, well.
Currently, SAE I, Gomads and the Phi Delts, who have
outscored opponents 152-14, are considered as favorites for
the championship.
Led by all-world guard J.C Howell, the Texans are a
dark horse favorite along with Johnson's Revenge, who im
proved their record to 5-0 last week
Other strong contenders include: Biz 11, Dosa Betas, Butt
Hun, Dirk's Jerks, Atomic Dogs, Whitman, SAE II and Kappa
Sigs 11.
IM football, catch the fever.
