Deukmejian rolls to second term
California Gov. George Deukmejian, whose tough-on-crime image
mirrored voter concerns, left Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in the dust
yesterday, sweeping to a second term as leader of the nation's most
populous state.
With 26 percent of the vote counted, Deukmejian held a steady lead of 64
percent to Bradley's 36 percent.
By mid-evening, the figures were Deukmejian 1,081,769, Bradley
604,266.
Deukmejian called his wide margin of victory "a mandate for us to hold
steady on our course.
"We have built a very solid foundation, and now we are in a position to
truly reach for the .stars," the governor told his supporters.

"The people Of this state have spoken. I respect the will of the people.
"Tonight the message is clear," Bradley said. "We've lost an election. I
want you to know the indomitable spirit of this old warrior will never say
die."
Deukmejian, speaking at his headquarters across town, said he had
received a congratulatory telegram from Bradley.
"He wished me well and he has said he wants to be helpful because we
both share in our agreement to make California the best place it can be and
I appreciate that," the governor told a cheering crowd.
Rose Bird voted out of office
Chief Justice Rose Bird, the first woman on the state Supreme Court, and
two other Jerry Brown appointees Tuesday became the first justices voted
out of office in California's 50 years of judicial retention elections, buried
by a conservative, pro-death penalty landslide.
The other two defeated justices were Cruz Reynoso, the court's first
Hispanic, and Joseph Grodin. All three had been targeted by conservative
groups.
Their defeat allows Gov. George Deukmejian to appoint a majority of the
seven-member court and shift control to conservatives for the first time in
three decades.
With 59 percent of the precincts reporting, Bird was being rejected by
more than 66 percent of the vote, Reynoso by 60 percent and Grodin by 57
percent.
"The voters of California have spoken, and I accept their verdict," Bird
said in a concession statement at the court's chambers in Los Angeles
around 9:30 p.m. "I accept it with a conscience at peace."
Debbie Goff, spokeswoman for Crime Victims for Court Reform, a group
opposing the three justices, said, "We think the voters are fed up with the
criminal justice system, and they want a change, and that is reflected by
what you see this evening."
Deukmejian s two appointees on the current court, Malcolm Lucas and
Edward Panelli, were retained in office by comfortable margins along with
Stanley Mosk, an appointee of former Gov. Edmund "Pat" Brown.
In her concession speech, Bird joked that she was taking her defeat "like
a man." She also spoke about the death penalty, the prime issue of oppo
nents who attacked the court's frequent reversals of death sentences.
"I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient
to see executions," Bird said, but she added: "I don't think anybody in this
state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that insures nothing but ex
ecutions to appease the overweening and insatiable appetite of ambitious
politicians."
If there are to be executions, Bird said, "it should be because the Consti
tution has been followed and the rule of law has been followed."
McCarthy pulls ahead of Curb
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy pulled ahead of Republican chal
lenger Mike Curb in the race for lieutenant governor yesterday, as GOP
hopeful William Campbell clung to an initial lead for controller and Demo
cratic incumbents won re-election as attorney general, secretary of state
and treasurer.
McCarthy edged ahead of Curb, 50 percent to 47 percent, with 13 per
cent of the precincts reporting in the mud-slinging race for lieutenant
governor.
State Sen. Campbell, with 49 percent, held a 2-point advantage over.

Bruce Gleason, a Panorama City attorney, who had 36 percent.

Treasurer Jesse Unruh, who no Republican candidate dared face, se
cured 81 percent compared to 10 percent for his closest minor party oppo
sition, Ray Cullen of the Libertarian Party.
"I am very pleased," Van de Kamp told supporters at a downtown hotel.
"I pledge to the people of California that the attorney general will be dedi

"I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient
to see executions," Bird said, but she added: "I don't think anybody in this
state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that insures nothing but ex
ecutions to appease the overweening and insatiable appetite of ambitious
politicians."
If there are to be executions, Bird said, "it should be because the Consti

Deukmejian rolls to second term
California Gov. George Deukmejian, whose tough-on-crime image
mirrored voter concerns, left Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in the dust
yesterday, sweeping to a second term as leader of the nation's most
populous state.
With 26 percent of the vote counted, Deukmejian held a steady lead of 64
percent to Bradley's 36 percent.
By mid-evening, the figures were Deukmejian 1,081,769, Bradley
604,266.
Deukmejian called his wide margin of victory "a mandate for us to hold
steady on our course.
"We have built a very solid foundation, and now we are in a position to
truly reach for the .stars," the governor told his supporters.

"The people Of this state have spoken. I respect the will of the people.
"Tonight the message is clear," Bradley said. "We've lost an election. I
want you to know the indomitable spirit of this old warrior will never say
die."
Deukmejian, speaking at his headquarters across town, said he had
received a congratulatory telegram from Bradley.
"He wished me well and he has said he wants to be helpful because we
both share in our agreement to make California the best place it can be and
I appreciate that," the governor told a cheering crowd.
Rose Bird voted out of office
Chief Justice Rose Bird, the first woman on the state Supreme Court, and
two other Jerry Brown appointees Tuesday became the first justices voted
out of office in California's 50 years of judicial retention elections, buried
by a conservative, pro-death penalty landslide.
The other two defeated justices were Cruz Reynoso, the court's first
Hispanic, and Joseph Grodin. All three had been targeted by conservative
groups.
Their defeat allows Gov. George Deukmejian to appoint a majority of the
seven-member court and shift control to conservatives for the first time in
three decades.
With 59 percent of the precincts reporting, Bird was being rejected by
more than 66 percent of the vote, Reynoso by 60 percent and Grodin by 57
percent.
"The voters of California have spoken, and I accept their verdict," Bird
said in a concession statement at the court's chambers in Los Angeles
around 9:30 p.m. "I accept it with a conscience at peace."
Debbie Goff, spokeswoman for Crime Victims for Court Reform, a group
opposing the three justices, said, "We think the voters are fed up with the
criminal justice system, and they want a change, and that is reflected by
what you see this evening."
