# Soccer faces Broncos; chance to play spoiler
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff Writer 
What a difference a win makes. The
"Stanford men's soccer team is finally
relaxed and can concentrate on the
remainder of the season. The stigma of
the scoreless streak is dead and buried.
The squad is coming off a 2-0 win in
which the defense completely smoth
ered San Jose State and the offense
amassed 18 shots on goal. Stanford is
now 6-9-2 and 1-3 in the Pacific Soccer
Conference.
The Cardinal carries this impressive
win into today's match against confer
ence opponent Santa Clara. Last
season, Stanford defeated the Broncos
4-0. This season's contest should not
be so one-sided.
Santa Clara still has an outside shot
at the conference title. The much
improved Broncos boast a 6-6-4
record, 1-1-3 in the conference. With
so many conference ties, they must win
the rest of their conference games and
hope other teams falter. Santa Clara

comes off a victory over SJSU and a loss
to the University of San Francisco. In
the role of the spoiler, the Cardinal
could end any such hopes.
"Santa Clara is a fairly strong team.
They're really good defensively. They
don't have any stand-out individuals to
look out for. They're just a very steady
team," senior midfielder Mike Moss
mer said.
"They're probably going to be a lot
like San Jose State. They're usually one
of the lower teams, but they're playing
well lately. It's definitely up to us,
though. If we play well, we can take it
to them," added sophomore defender
David Thorpe.
Mossmer and Thorpe were two key
pieces to the winning puzzle on Satur
day. Mossmer scored his third goal of
the season, and Thorpe picked up his
first assist of the season. Mossmer is
just starting to feel comfortable this
season after being hobbled with an un
ending string of injuries.
"I've been injured so I haven't been
able to get up to my scoring potential. I

have to stay back on defense a lot be
cause I can't get up to the front. I'm
used to attacking," Mossmer said.
It's no wonder. Mossmer's suffered
from a pulled stomach muscle, a bone
bruise on his shin, a deep knee bruise
and a pulled groin. "It took a while to
get used to playing injured. I'm finally
getting back into the swing of things,"
he said.
Thorpe is a major player in all of
Stanford's set plays on corner kicks
and free kicks. One of them worked to
perfection on the second goal Satur
day.
"(Senior forward Jim) Cole called
the number to put the ball to the far
post, and I'm supposed to head it back
in front. We worked at it pretty hard (in
practice) and it finally paid off,"
Thorpe said.
The total domination over SJSU Sat
urday has given the Cardinal a new
outlook on the remainder of the
season. Stanford Coach Sam Koch said
last week that the team is now playing
for next season.
