## ASSU offers business innovation, experience 
### DAVID LIPPEATT 
It's a strange place — they write the
ASSU News there. It's where a lot of
senators spend a lot of time arguing
about divestment and Western Culture
and how necessary their own jobs are.
It's the place to which your fee assess
ments, collected every year, vanish,
hut what else is it?
Besides its highly visible political
functions, the Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU) has an en
tirely different side to it, one that most
students have never heard of or know
only a little about — the financial side.
According to senior Mariah Dickson,
ASSU financial manager, the organiza
tion's business side "is a very positive
aspect of the ASSU and one we don't
get much credit for." The various jobs
involved offer "the best business ex
perience you (undergraduates) can get
at Stanford."
The business positions at the ASSU

fall into two categories, according to
Council of Presidents member Mary
Thurber. One area includes the five as
sistant financial managers, who have
specific tasks such as dealing with
banking or overseeing student organi
zation budgets. On the other hand are
the managers of the six ASSU business
projects: the Ad Agency, Flicks, Lecture
Notes, Special Projects, T-shirts, and
Typesetting.
The top position is the financial
manager who is responsible for over
seeing all ASSU financial operations.
Dickson explained that her job has five
basic functions. As controller of the
Student Organizations Fund, she is a
banker servicing more than 1,000 ac
counts belonging to every student or
ganization at Stanford, many Stanford
residences and the ASSU itself. As gen
eral manager of the business projects,
she consults with project managers to
make sure that things are running
smoothly. She also prepares and

implements the $300,000 operating
budget of the ASSU, half of which
comes from ASSU investments and the
business projects and the other half
from the University.
The financial manager's fourth func
tion, said Dickson, is to work with a
professional staff to collect student fees
in the spring, distribute them to stu
dent organizations and give out fee
refunds in the fall.
Dickson's final task is to manage the
investments made with student organi
zation money — all $800,000 of it. The
University used to invest this money
for the ASSU. Last spring, however,
Stanford students voted to divest ASSU
money from the University's fund. This
act was a protest against the University
investments in some companies that
do business in South Africa.
Suddenly, the ASSU had to invest its
own money. Dickson and her staff un
derwent a crash course in investing. "It
was real hard finding South Africa-free

investment opportunities," she said.
Before the vote, the University was
getting a 10 percent annual rate of
return on its investments. This year,
the ASSU is getting just under a 6 per
cent return. The difference amounts to
a yearly loss of about $21,000.
"When the students and senators
voted to divest, it was clearly a moral
and not a financial decision," said
Dickson.
Innovation is encouraged at the
ASSU, and a prime example is the Spe
cial Projects Agency. Currently, it offers
linen service for freshmen and special
classes such as bartending and traffic
school. The agency also promotes new
business ventures.
"We are receptive to new ideas, but
we're also very picky. Someone who
comes to us must have a detailed and
well-thought-out proposal before we
supply the financial backing," Dickson
said.
Many agencies, such as Lecture

Notes, started as student initiatives. The
ASSU retains the profits of the venture,
but the entrepreneur can become proj
ect manager. Project managers are paid
monthly salaries as well as bonuses
tied to profits. Bonuses can be quite
substantial considering that some
agencies, such as Flicks, made more
than $25,000 last year.
Assistant Financial Manager Fred
Wang, who oversees funding for stu
dent organizations and projects, cau
tioned that some business experience
would help students applying for ASSU
financial jobs. "It's good to know the
terminology," he said. He added that
"it would be a good idea for people to
come in and work a little during the
fall and winter before starting a major
job here in the spring."
As far as the other financial jobs go,
business project managers have "the
greatest time," according to Donna
Regenbaum, who is in charge of ASSU
Lecture Notes. Her job involves choos

ing which classes to cover, hiring
notetakers and a staff, paying bills and
generally "making the day-to-day deci
sions," she said. "It's basically like
being thrown into a business with the
capital already there. I'm pretty much
autonomous — as long as Lecture
Notes is making a profit, everything's
fine."
To Vivianne Huang, business
manager of the Ad Agency, the ques
tion of goals within ASSU jobs is im
portant. "The real reason we're here is
to learn the nitty-gritty of running a
business," and not to focus on
profitability, she said. "To me,
creativity, allowing the people who run
this business to do what they want, and
productivity, providing better service
to the community, are more important
than profitability."
Ad Agency Project Manager Karla
Kiely summed up: "This is what the
ASSU is for — to get people involved."

Lecture Notes. Her job involves choos

ing which classes to cover, hiring
notetakers and a staff, paying bills and
generally "making the day-to-day deci
sions," she said. "It's basically like
being thrown into a business with the
capital already there. I'm pretty much
autonomous — as long as Lecture
Notes is making a profit, everything's
fine."
To Vivianne Huang, business
manager of the Ad Agency, the ques
tion of goals within ASSU jobs is im
portant. "The real reason we're here is
to learn the nitty-gritty of running a
business," and not to focus on
profitability, she said. "To me,
creativity, allowing the people who run
this business to do what they want, and
productivity, providing better service
to the community, are more important
than profitability."
Ad Agency Project Manager Karla
Kiely summed up: "This is what the
ASSU is for — to get people involved."
It's a strange place — they write the
ASSU News there. It's where a lot of
senators spend a lot of time arguing
about divestment and Western Culture
and how necessary their own jobs are.
It's the place to which your fee assess
ments, collected every year, vanish,
hut what else is it?
Besides its highly visible political
functions, the Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU) has an en
tirely different side to it, one that most
students have never heard of or know
only a little about — the financial side.
According to senior Mariah Dickson,
ASSU financial manager, the organiza
tion's business side "is a very positive
aspect of the ASSU and one we don't
get much credit for." The various jobs
involved offer "the best business ex
perience you (undergraduates) can get
at Stanford."
The business positions at the ASSU

fall into two categories, according to
Council of Presidents member Mary
Thurber. One area includes the five as
sistant financial managers, who have
specific tasks such as dealing with
banking or overseeing student organi
zation budgets. On the other hand are
the managers of the six ASSU business
projects: the Ad Agency, Flicks, Lecture
Notes, Special Projects, T-shirts, and
Typesetting.
The top position is the financial
manager who is responsible for over
seeing all ASSU financial operations.
Dickson explained that her job has five
basic functions. As controller of the
Student Organizations Fund, she is a
banker servicing more than 1,000 ac
counts belonging to every student or
ganization at Stanford, many Stanford
residences and the ASSU itself. As gen
eral manager of the business projects,
she consults with project managers to
make sure that things are running
smoothly. She also prepares and

implements the $300,000 operating
budget of the ASSU, half of which
comes from ASSU investments and the
business projects and the other half
from the University.
The financial manager's fourth func
tion, said Dickson, is to work with a
professional staff to collect student fees
in the spring, distribute them to stu
dent organizations and give out fee
refunds in the fall.
Dickson's final task is to manage the
investments made with student organi
zation money — all $800,000 of it. The
University used to invest this money
for the ASSU. Last spring, however,
Stanford students voted to divest ASSU
money from the University's fund. This
act was a protest against the University
investments in some companies that
do business in South Africa.
Suddenly, the ASSU had to invest its
own money. Dickson and her staff un
derwent a crash course in investing. "It
was real hard finding South Africa-free

investment opportunities," she said.
Before the vote, the University was
getting a 10 percent annual rate of
return on its investments. This year,
the ASSU is getting just under a 6 per
cent return. The difference amounts to
a yearly loss of about $21,000.
"When the students and senators
voted to divest, it was clearly a moral
and not a financial decision," said
Dickson.
Innovation is encouraged at the
ASSU, and a prime example is the Spe
cial Projects Agency. Currently, it offers
linen service for freshmen and special
classes such as bartending and traffic
school. The agency also promotes new
business ventures.
"We are receptive to new ideas, but
we're also very picky. Someone who
comes to us must have a detailed and
well-thought-out proposal before we
supply the financial backing," Dickson
said.
Many agencies, such as Lecture

Notes, started as student initiatives. The
ASSU retains the profits of the venture,
but the entrepreneur can become proj
ect manager. Project managers are paid
monthly salaries as well as bonuses
tied to profits. Bonuses can be quite
substantial considering that some
agencies, such as Flicks, made more
than $25,000 last year.
Assistant Financial Manager Fred
Wang, who oversees funding for stu
dent organizations and projects, cau
tioned that some business experience
would help students applying for ASSU
financial jobs. "It's good to know the
terminology," he said. He added that
"it would be a good idea for people to
come in and work a little during the
fall and winter before starting a major
job here in the spring."
As far as the other financial jobs go,
business project managers have "the
greatest time," according to Donna
Regenbaum, who is in charge of ASSU
Lecture Notes. Her job involves choos

ing which classes to cover, hiring
notetakers and a staff, paying bills and
generally "making the day-to-day deci
