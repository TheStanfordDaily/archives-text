# Minority profs. hard to find

University officials report difficulty attract
ing enough minority faculty because of the
shrinking graduate student pool and the level
ing of the number of minorities seeking doc
torates.
"We haven't met the goals that we would
like to (get) more minorities on the faculty,"
said Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the University
president. "We haven't made enough prog
ress."
Furthermore, the future for minority faculty
recruitment does not look very promising, ac
cording to University officials. For one thing,
the lower number of minorities in the current
crop of college seniors applying to graduate
school will impede efforts to hire more
minority faculty. But University officials say
they will increase their efforts to attract
minority faculty despite the difficulties.

According to Carolyn Lougee, dean of Un
dergraduate Studies, the University is taking a
more active tack in attracting minority faculty.
"We don't wait for an opening but rather scan
faculty across the country and bring them
here whether or not there is an opening," she
said.
Lougee outlined programs designed to in
terest high-achieving minority students in
graduate school including a program that
matches individual black undergraduate stu
dents with black professors. Such programs
serve to let students "know what's involved in
an academic career," she said.
"We have to look at the Ph.D. rates of
minorities. We're going to have to work
harder in order to keep our rate (of minority
faculty) increasing," said Noelle Kolak, assis
tant provost for Faculty Affairs.
The overall number of doctorate recipients
in the United States has declined by 3,000 in

seven years, from 27,416 in 1977 to 24,536 in
1984.
In order to ensure that Stanford's affirma
tive action policies succeed, the Office of the
Provost established the Faculty Affirmative Ac
tion Fund in 1971. "The premise behind the
fund is that relatively few affirmative action
candidates might turn up in certain specializa
tions," said Provost James Rosse.
The fund helps departments pay for adding
qualified minority faculty by giving the de
partment half the recruitment budget and al
lowing the department to hire regardless of
budgeted new faculty space. In this way aca
demic departments can support additional
professors and improve their minority repre
sentation. The fund has funneled more than
$1 million into departments since its incep
tion.
In 1977, the percentage of minority faculty
at Stanford was 6.8. By September 1986 the
number increased to 7.3 percent.
