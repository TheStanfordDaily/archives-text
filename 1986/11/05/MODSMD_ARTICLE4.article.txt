# Cranston leads over Zschau

### MARK LAWRENCE ANDREW PATZMAN 
With wire reports
Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston early this morning
appeared to have withstood a late campaign surge by
Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos) and retained the Senate
seat he has held since 1968, winning about 49 per
cent of yesterday's vote.
Cranston hesitantly predicted victory, saying, "I'm
looking forward to being the majority whip."
Zschau, however, refused to concede the race and
was still holding out early this morning, hoping that
returns from Orange County and Los Angeles would
give him the edge over Cranston.
Tn a m appfearance at the Sar>L» -Clara Mar
riott in Santa Clara, Zschau said he was optimistic but
that he was going to ted. Zschau campaign officials
said they had expected a close race ;ind returns were
going as expected.
"We have concluded that we will not know any
thing more in the next hour," Zschau said at 1:45. "I
suggest everybody get some sleep. I'm looking for
ward to waking up to real good news."
CBS and ABC news programs predicted early in
the evening that Cranston would win, however, and a
succession of returns indicated that Zschau was not
narrowing the 1-point gap that still separated the two
candidates with about 55 percent of precincts report
ing. The two were separated by about 50,000 votes
out of 3 5 million cast.
Cranston led Zschau in Santa Clara County —
home to both candidates — and in Los Angeles
County, where one-third of California's voters live.
Cranston, a Stanford graduate, also led in
Sacramento, Fresno and San Francisco counties, but
trailed decisively in the more conservative Riverside
and Orange counties. Zschau was also a student at
Stanford, receiving an M.8.A., M.S. and doctorate
here.
Californians questioned in exit polls cited
Cranston's experience and trustworthiness in making
the choice.
Stanford political experts characterized Cranston
as a dependable, experienced senator who could
assume a leadership role when the Democrat
controlled 100 th Congress convenes in January.

"He's an old-fashioned, left, liberal Democrat,"
said former Reagan administration adviser Martin An
derson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
"Cranston's been very consistent, and he feels very
strongly about certain issues."
Cranston has strongly opposed the death penalty,
U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan contra rebels and the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction measure,
and has been a strong supporter of sanctions against
South Africa. He supports research on the Strategic
Defense Initiative but called Reagan's refusal to ban
the program at the recent U.S.-Soviet summit a
"failure." He has been a leading Senate voice in favor
of continued U.S. compliance with the expired Stra
tegic Arms Limitation Agreement.

Political Science Prof. John Manley said victories by
Cranston and other liberal Democratic Senate candi
dates reveal underlying liberal sentiment in the
United States. "The election shows that there is a sig
nificant base of liberal support in the state and that
that is simply overshadowed by the personal
popularity of the president," Manley said.
Cranston's victory also shows that Reagan's recent
trip campaigning for Republican candidates was a
failure and that die president's influence is waning,
Manley said.
"What the election shows is not the political reach
of Ronald Reagan, but his limitations," said Manley,

"embarrassment" to the Reagan ad

narrow margin of victory indicates a
weakening of the Democratic Party in
California. "Here, an old, experienced
Senator is being challlenged by youth,"
Anderson said. "It illustrates a weaken
