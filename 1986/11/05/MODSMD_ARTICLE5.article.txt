California Propositions 63, the "English Language"
initiative, and 65, the "safe drinking water" act, were
approved by wide margins in yesterday's general
election. Proposition 61, which would have set limits
on officials' salaries and Proposition 64, the contro
versial AIDS initiative, were strongly defeated.
Richard Brody, professor of political science, said
the results showed that a "fair amount of credit'' can
be given to the political influence of individuals. Nei
ther 61 nor 64 had a credible figure in the state sup
porting it, Brody said.
Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Martin Anderson
said these election results "seem very reasonable"

and show that California citizens have "general con
cerns" for the state in which they live.
Proposition 63 requires that English become the
official state common language. With 16 percent of
the vote in, the issue was approved by a comfortable
11 to 23 percent margin.
Brody said approval (if this proposition was "a gut
level response." He added that that California
citizens are upset that "people are winning the lot
tery who don't speak English.
"It's a narrow-minded reponse," Brody said.
Proposition 65 prohibits the discharge of toxic
chemicals into the drinking water and requires warn
ings to the public of toxic chemical exposure. Resi
dents are allowed to sue polluters if the government
fails to act against them. It was passed by a 64 to 36

percent margin with 16 percent of the votes tallied.
Hubert Marshall, professor of political science,
said that "the public is sending a message to the
legislature that they are concerned" about toxic
waste.
Stanford has a "vested interest" in Proposition 65,
according to Marshall. The University, which owns
the land at Stanford Industrial Park, could now be
sued if any toxic waste pollutes the creeks in the area,
Marshall said.
In a letter to the Palo Alto City Council, University
President Donald Kennedy said that charges of dan
gerous toxic exposure "would be extremely difficult
if not impossible to prove."
Kennedy was also against Proposotion 61, which was
voted down 57 to 43 percent with 16 percent of the votes
tabulated. Proposition 61 would have capped the salaries of
state and local officials at $64,000.
Proposition 64, strongly supported by Lyndon Laßouche,
was also substantially voted down 68 to 32 percent with 16
percent of the votes tallied. This proposition called for the
identification of AIDS victims and their being subject to pos
sible quarantine measures. It would have barred AIDS vic
tims from educational institutions and restaurant
employment.
