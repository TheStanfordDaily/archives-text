## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial Staff 
Republican Ernest Konnyu easily
defeated Democrat I.ance Weil in the
race for the 12th Congressional Dis
trict, which includes Stanford.
Konnyu, a state assemblyman from
the 22nd District (Los Altos) captured
more than 55 percent of the vote in the
traditionally Republican district that
encompasses most of Santa Clara
County and pans of San Mateo County.
Konnyu will take the place in
Congress of Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos),
who gave up the seat to seek election
to the U.S. Senate

A four-term state assemblyman, Kon
nyu gained notoriety for sponsoring a
"work-fare" bill in the assembly that
was subsequently passed into law.
Weil, in contrast, is a Cupertino at
torney who had never before run for
public office
Weil conceded defeat around mid
night but was in good spirits, accord
ing to his campaign manager Greg Set
lers. "You're never happy if you don't
win," Sellers said, "but we ve done bet
ter than any Democrat has ever done
in this district."
"We've acheived quite a bit, he said,
noting that not only was Weil a political
unknown before the election, but that

he was outspent by Konnyu by a mar
gin of nearly 4-to-l. The Weil campaign
spent 160,000, while Konnyu spent
over $200,000, Sellers said.
According to Sellers, Weil's primary
campaign strategy was to convince
voters that the 12th district is an inde
pendent thinking area and that a Dem
ocrat could run a successful congres
sional campaign here.
Speaking at Columbae House last
Sunday, Weil concentrated on his com
mitment to the preservation of the en
vironment and attacked Konnyu's
record on environmental issues.
In a speach in White Plaza last
spring, Konnyu focused his attention

on economic issues and promised to
be a strong supporter of President
Reagan if elected to congress.
The federal deficit will "destroy the
value of the dollar," Konnyu told Stan
ford students. If the problem isn't
solved, "you will not have the kind of
jobs you're working for and hoping
for," he warned.
According to Sellers, Weil attempted
to bring out Konnyu's "strong conser
vatism." Weil told members of the
Stanford community last spring that
while a vote for Konnyu was a vote for
Reagan's policies, a vote for him would
"send a message to Washington" pro
testing the administration's policies.
