Iran offers to help hostages
NICOSIA, Cyprus — A senior Iranian official yesterday offered Iran's
help in freeing the remaining American and French hostages in Lebanon,
provided the United States and France agree to settle financial claims and
unblock the shipments of arms bought by Iran before the Islamic revolu
tion.
The official, Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, also said
that a U.S. delegation headed by Robert McFarlane, President Reagan's
former national security adviser, secretly visited Tehran last month in a bid
to enlist the country's help in securing the release of the hostages.
McFarlane and four other Americans arrived on a flight carrying military
equipment and carrying a message from Reagan seeking improved rela
tions, Rafsanjani said, but they were put under house arrest in their hotel
for five days and then expelled from Iran.
His remarks were interpreted to be an effort to discredit reports pub
lished in the Arab world Monday that Iran had already worked out a secret
deal with Washington to trade arms Iran needs for its Persian Gulf War with
Iraq for Iran's assistance in persuading Moslem extremists in Lebanon to
release the hostages. The hostages include at least five Americans, nine
French nationals and several other foreigners.
In Washington, U.S. officials initially refused to comment on Rafsanjani's
remarks, which were reported by Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency and monitored in Cyprus. That fueled speculation in Washington
and throughout the Middle East that the United States had lifted its arms
embargo of Iran in order to win the hostages' freedom.
But, late in the day, the White House announced that the seven-year-old
U.S. arms embargo remained in place. "As long as Iran advocates the use of
terrorism, the U.S. arms embargo will continue," White House spokesman
Larry Speakes told reporters aboard Air Force One as it returned President
Reagan from California to Washington.
Botha replaces cabinet members
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President Pieter Botha replaced his
two most controversial Cabinet members yesterday in a broad reorganiza
tion of his government.
Louis le Grange, the minister of law and order for the past seven years
and the architect of the government's tough measures to deal with the con
tinuing civil unrest, will be succeeded by his deputy, Adriaan Vlok. Vlok is
widely regarded as a moderate and as much more sensitive to human
rights issues.
. D.J. Louis Nel, the blunt, tough-talking deputy minister of information
who has enforced press censorship under the state of emergency, will be
replaced by Christoffel van der Merwe, a political scientist and former
diplomat. As a leading member of the National Party's liberal wing, van der
Merwe has helped draft and sell its program of step-by-step reforms.
Three other senior ministers are retiring, Botha said, and a dozen
younger National Party members of Parliament will be brought into the
government Dec. 1 as deputy ministers, rejuvenating the Cabinet and
giving it a more liberal image.
To Botha, the changes were a further commitment to gradual but far
reaching political, economic and social reforms and a step toward national
e lea ions that he hopes will give him a broader mandate for change.
Shultz, Soviet to meet in Vienna
VIENNA, Austria — Amid renewed hopes for progress in arms control,
Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze will meet here today in an effort to salvage as much as possi
ble from the Iceland summit talks.
Expectations are that the Kremlin will outline its new arms position here
in private meetings of the two officials and will formally present it next
# week at the Geneva arms negotiations.
There was also some hope that the two sides will move toward creating a
new forum on nuclear testing and perhaps return to discus
sions about a date for a new U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Washington.
Both sides have insisted that real progress was made at the meeting in
Reykjavik, Iceland between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev on Oct. 11-12 before that meeting collapsed without agree
ment, primarily because of disagreement on the U.S. Strategic Defense Ini
tiative.
The United States introduced new proposals two weeks ago at the
Geneva arms-control talks on offensive and defensive strategic weapons.
Essentially these were a reiteration of earlier U.S. positions, with some
modifications to reflect the Iceland talks.
The Soviets have not yet presented their new proposals. Their chief
negotiator, Ambassador Viktor Karpov, has been back in Moscow since the
Reykjavik meeting, presumably formulating the new Kremlin stand.
In his absence, Soviet diplomats at Geneva have basically marked time.
Partly because of this, and partly in anticipation of new Soviet proposals,
the Geneva talks, which were to have ended yesterday, have been extended
for at least a week.
Hostage is reunited with family
WIESBADEN, West Germany — Former American hostage David Jacob
sen was reunited with members of his California family yesterday for the
first time since he was kidnaped 17 months ago in Beirut, and the Anglican
Church envoy who helped engineer his release said that two more
Americans might be freed soon.
Jacobsen tearfully embraced his three children on a balcony adorned
with fluttering American flags at the U.S. Air Force Medical Center in Wies
baden.
The former administrator of the hospital of the American University in
Beirut, Jacobsen was released Sunday by his Shia Moslem captors in Beirut
and flown to West Germany on Monday.
He met his two sons, Eric and Paul, and a daughter, Diane Duggan, along
with their spouses, at the medical center here, held a private reunion and
then talked with reporters.
Jacobsen appeared to be in good physical condition, though he tended
to ramble and admitted that he was "on a high."
Terry Waite, the emissary of the archbishop of Canterbury, told a news
conference here that prospects are "reasonably strong" that the two U.S.
hostages still held in Lebanon by Islamic Jihad, the pro-Iranian organiza
tion that kidnaped Jacobsen, would be released soon.
Waite, saying that the hostage situation was "very sensitive," declined to
discuss details of Jacobsen's release or of the negotiations over remaining
hostages. But he was unusually open in expressing cautious optimism
about the two U.S. hostages still held by Islamic Jihad.
"At the moment, the two people specifically in my sights are Terry An
derson and Tom Sutherland," Waite said. "Insofar as I have, and have had
for quite a long time, contacts with captors of the two men, that is where
our best chances lie at the moment."
Hasenfus says he'll seek mercy
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Eugene Hasenfus, the cargo handler from a
downed rebel supply plane, said yesterday he will seek mercy from the
Sandinista government if, as expected, he is convicted by the popular
tribunal trying him for terrorism.
Hasenfus, from Marinette, Wis., acknowledged in his first detailed tes
timony before the Popular Anti-Somicista Tribunal that he was running
guns to the U.S.-sponsored insurgents when his C-123K cargo plane was
shot down Oct. 5 over Nicaragua. The government has charged him with
terrorism, violation of security laws and illegal association, with all three
crimes carrying a sentence of up to 30 years.
Hasenfus, 45, has freely admitted his role in flying supplies to the rebels
in a written confession and several news interviews. But yesterday's tes
timony, given at Hasenfus' request, marked the first time the ex-marine has
formally outlined to the tribunal what he did as cargo handler aboard the
supply flights from Ilopango Airport in San Salvador and an airstrip in
central Honduras.
