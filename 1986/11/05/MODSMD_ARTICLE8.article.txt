# GOP loses control of Senate
## 
### 
Propelled by a string of victories
from East to West Coast, Democrats
seized control of the Senate yesterday,
confronting President Reagan with a
Congress in which both chambers are
controlled by the opposition for his
final two years in office.
Democratic candidates knocked off
GOP freshmen in Florida, Georgia,
North Carolina and South Dakota,
picked up GOP-held seats in Maryland
and Nevada, and were close to gaining
several others. The only seat the Dem
ocrats had lost by early today was an
open-seat contest in Missouri, where
former Republican Gov. Christopher
Bond was the winner over Democratic
Lt. Gov. Harriett Woods.
The Senate was die big prize of a
midterm election in which 36 gover
norships and all 435 House seats were
also at stake, but no issues of apparent
overriding national importance and
few visions for the future were served
up by either party.
In the House, Democrats made
modest gains in early returns, and it
appeared that the new House will look
much like the old, as most incumbents
seemed headed for re-election.
In the Senate races, Republicans en
tered yesterday's balloting with a 53-to
-47 majority in a chamber they took
over in President Reagan's first
landslide in 1980, but they had to
defend 22 of the 34 seats being con
tested this year.
A Democratic challenger was press
ing hard in in Alabama, but it looked as
if GOP freshman Sen. Steve Symms
would hold onto his seat in Idaho.
Rep. John Breaux (D-La.) won a

Democratic open seat in Louisiana, a
race in which Republican Rep. W. Hen
son Moore had piled up 45 percent of
the vote to lead the field in a 14-
candidate primary in September, but
fell fatally short of the 50 percent
threshold he needed to avoid yester
day's runoff election.
In Colorado, Democratic Rep.
Timothy Wirth defeated Republican
Rep. Ken Kramer in the race for the
seat that Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) is
leaving to pursue a second try for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
This was one of the few races in the
country in which the proposed Strate
gic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a
major issue, with Kramer calling for a
full funding and Wirth urging a go
slow approach.
Winning Senate control enables the
Democrats to organize that chamber in
the 100 th Congress next January,
choosing committee chairmen and
challenging Reagan's initiatives in the
final two years of his second term.
The night's tally was a sweet reversal
for the Democrats from the outcome
in 1980, when virtually all of the close
Senate races went to the Republicans.
This time, the close races almost all
swung Democratic — despite the ar
duous campaigning efforts of Reagan,
who visited 22 states, and despite an
unprecedented $15 million voter turn
out operation carried out by the na
tional Republican committees.
The so-called "six year itch" — the
historic tendency of voters to turn out
incumbents of the party that took con
trol of the presidency six years earlier
— apparently took hold in yesterday's

balloting in the Senate. Of the 22 seats
the GOP had to defend, 16 were held
by freshmen elected in 1980, 11 of
them won that year by 53 percent of
the vote or less.
In this century, presidential parties
have suffered an average loss of 48
seats in their second midterm, but yes
terday's setbacks for the GOP figured
to be nowhere near that large. Demo
crats were expecting gains of roughly
10 seats to add to the 253-to-180
majority they currently enjoy in the
House.
The results in the South reflected a
criss-cross pattern — Democrats
gaining Senate seats but losing gover
norships — that was repeated through
out the nation. In a year with no strong
national currents, the results appeared
dictated as much by which party had
more seats at risk as by any other fac
tor.
Thus, Democrats picked up GOP
Senate seats in North Carolina, Geor
gia, Florida, while Republicans won
southern governorships in Texas,
Florida, and South Carolina.
Not all Senate freshmen elected in
1980 fell prey to yesterday's Demo
cratic sweep. Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen
Specter and Oklahoma Sen. Don
Nickles, two senators who figured to
be vulnerable because of economic
problems and a large Democratic base
vote, were easy winners. Sens. Robert
Kasten Jr. (R-Wis.) and Steve Symms (R-
Idaho) two other narrow winners in
1980, were both projected as narrow
winners.
Yesterday's results scrambled the
prospects of some of the early con

tenders for the 1988 presidential race.
In New York, Democratic Gov. Mario
Cuomo won big, as expected, but his
heavy-handed treatment of GOP chal
lenger Andrew O'Rourke may haunt
him if he tries to reach for national of
fice.
In Kansas, Republican Sen. Bob Dole
won re-election easily, but his likely
loss of the Senate majority leader past
would deprive him of a forum that has
given him visibility and the chance to
demonstate leadership. Dole hinted
late last night that, with a Republican
taking over the governorship in
Kansas, he might feel free to give up
his Senate seat to concentrate full-time
on running for president.
In Nevada, retiring Republican Sen.
Paul Laxalt was not on the ballot, but
the failure of his hand-picked succes
sor, former representative James San
tini, to win his seat may dampen
Laxalt's chances for the GOP presiden
tial nomination.
According to NBC-TV exits polls
nationwide, 36 percent of those who
voted yesterday were self-described
Democrats, 31 percent were
Republicans, and the remainder were
independents or not sure. Twenty-six
percent of the electorate said it
thought the economy was getting bet
ter, and that group voted Republican
for House by nearly 2 to 1. Twenty-one
percent of the electorate said they
thought the economy was getting
worse, and that group voted Demo
cratic for House candidates by a more
than 3 to 1 margin.

also at stake, but no issues of apparent
overriding national importance and
few visions for the future were served
up by either party.
In the House, Democrats made
modest gains in early returns, and it
appeared that the new House will look
much like the old, as most incumbents
seemed headed for re-election.
In the Senate races, Republicans en
tered yesterday's balloting with a 53-to
-47 majority in a chamber they took
over in President Reagan's first
landslide in 1980, but they had to
defend 22 of the 34 seats being con
tested this year.
A Democratic challenger was press
ing hard in in Alabama, but it looked as
if GOP freshman Sen. Steve Symms
would hold onto his seat in Idaho.
Rep. John Breaux (D-La.) won a

Democratic open seat in Louisiana, a
race in which Republican Rep. W. Hen
son Moore had piled up 45 percent of
the vote to lead the field in a 14-
candidate primary in September, but
fell fatally short of the 50 percent
threshold he needed to avoid yester
day's runoff election.
In Colorado, Democratic Rep.
Timothy Wirth defeated Republican
Rep. Ken Kramer in the race for the
seat that Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) is
leaving to pursue a second try for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
This was one of the few races in the
country in which the proposed Strate
gic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a
major issue, with Kramer calling for a
full funding and Wirth urging a go
slow approach.
Winning Senate control enables the
Democrats to organize that chamber in
the 100 th Congress next January,
choosing committee chairmen and
challenging Reagan's initiatives in the
final two years of his second term.
The night's tally was a sweet reversal
for the Democrats from the outcome
in 1980, when virtually all of the close
Senate races went to the Republicans.
This time, the close races almost all
swung Democratic — despite the ar
duous campaigning efforts of Reagan,
who visited 22 states, and despite an
unprecedented $15 million voter turn
out operation carried out by the na
tional Republican committees.
The so-called "six year itch" — the
historic tendency of voters to turn out
incumbents of the party that took con
trol of the presidency six years earlier
— apparently took hold in yesterday's

balloting in the Senate. Of the 22 seats
the GOP had to defend, 16 were held
by freshmen elected in 1980, 11 of
them won that year by 53 percent of
the vote or less.
In this century, presidential parties
have suffered an average loss of 48
seats in their second midterm, but yes
terday's setbacks for the GOP figured
to be nowhere near that large. Demo
crats were expecting gains of roughly
10 seats to add to the 253-to-180
majority they currently enjoy in the
House.
The results in the South reflected a
criss-cross pattern — Democrats
gaining Senate seats but losing gover
norships — that was repeated through
out the nation. In a year with no strong
national currents, the results appeared
dictated as much by which party had
more seats at risk as by any other fac
tor.
Thus, Democrats picked up GOP
Senate seats in North Carolina, Geor
gia, Florida, while Republicans won
southern governorships in Texas,
Florida, and South Carolina.
Not all Senate freshmen elected in
1980 fell prey to yesterday's Demo
cratic sweep. Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen
Specter and Oklahoma Sen. Don
Nickles, two senators who figured to
be vulnerable because of economic
problems and a large Democratic base
vote, were easy winners. Sens. Robert
Kasten Jr. (R-Wis.) and Steve Symms (R-
Idaho) two other narrow winners in
1980, were both projected as narrow
winners.
Yesterday's results scrambled the
prospects of some of the early con

tenders for the 1988 presidential race.
In New York, Democratic Gov. Mario
Cuomo won big, as expected, but his
heavy-handed treatment of GOP chal
lenger Andrew O'Rourke may haunt
him if he tries to reach for national of
fice.
In Kansas, Republican Sen. Bob Dole
won re-election easily, but his likely
loss of the Senate majority leader past
would deprive him of a forum that has
given him visibility and the chance to
demonstate leadership. Dole hinted
late last night that, with a Republican
taking over the governorship in
Kansas, he might feel free to give up
his Senate seat to concentrate full-time
on running for president.
In Nevada, retiring Republican Sen.
Paul Laxalt was not on the ballot, but
the failure of his hand-picked succes
sor, former representative James San
tini, to win his seat may dampen
Laxalt's chances for the GOP presiden
tial nomination.
According to NBC-TV exits polls
nationwide, 36 percent of those who
voted yesterday were self-described
Democrats, 31 percent were
Republicans, and the remainder were
independents or not sure. Twenty-six
percent of the electorate said it
thought the economy was getting bet
ter, and that group voted Republican
for House by nearly 2 to 1. Twenty-one
percent of the electorate said they
thought the economy was getting
worse, and that group voted Demo
cratic for House candidates by a more
than 3 to 1 margin.

Propelled by a string of victories
from East to West Coast, Democrats
seized control of the Senate yesterday,
confronting President Reagan with a
Congress in which both chambers are
controlled by the opposition for his
final two years in office.
Democratic candidates knocked off
GOP freshmen in Florida, Georgia,
North Carolina and South Dakota,
picked up GOP-held seats in Maryland
and Nevada, and were close to gaining
several others. The only seat the Dem

open-seat contest in Missouri, where

Bond was the winner over Democratic
Lt. Gov. Harriett Woods.
