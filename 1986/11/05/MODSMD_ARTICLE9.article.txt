# Republicans win governorships
## 
### 
The Republican Party shattered the Democrats'
long-time grip on statehouses yesterday, taking Ala
bama for the first time since Reconstruction and
moving the GOP toward a pickup of at least eight
more executive mansions.
In the process, the Republicans also rewrote the
electoral history book in Florida, electing former
Tampa Mayor Bob Martinez, a Democrat-turned-
Republican, as the state's first Hispanic chief execu
tive.
They got a measure of revenge, too, reclaiming
Texas from the Democrats, as former GOP Gov. Bill
Clements beat incumbent Democratic Gov. Mark

White, the man who unseated Clements four years
ago.
In Nebraska, longtime Republican Party activist Kay
Orr defeated a woman opponent to take the state
away from the Democrats.
Altogether, Republican candidates for governor
won in eight states and were leading in three others
now held by Democrats. Democrats won two states
now held by the GOP, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
If that trend held up, it would produce a net gain
of nine seats, just shy of the 10 the GOP needed to
capture a majority of the executive mansions. The

Republicans have not held the balance of power in
the statehouses since 1969, and Democrats had a 34-
16 advantage going into yesterday's elections.
But for the Republicans, more opportunities were
available in contests in late-reporting western states.
On a night diat Republicans conceded they were
losing control of the Senate, the gubernatorial vic
tories gave them a consolation prize.
President Reagan's spokesman Larry Speakes said
the gubernatorial outcome "speaks well for the per
manent realignment of the Republican Party."
