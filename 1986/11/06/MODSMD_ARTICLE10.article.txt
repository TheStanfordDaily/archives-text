# Smokestacks to start on Monday

Four sheet-metal smokestacks 80
feet high, part of a $600,000 project
to improve health safety at the Jack
McCullough building, will begin
diffusing acid waste into the atmos
phere by Monday, according to
project manager Ulf Teigen.
The 30-foot additions to the exist
ing stacks were built "as a measure
of safety, in case an accident hap
pens in an experiment," according
to Jim Harris, faculty coordinator
for the construction.
Commenting on the aesthetic
virtues of the stacks, Harris said the
project "doesn't look as bad as I
thought it might when 1 saw the
original plans. Our choices were to
stop doing research or to maintain
health standards."
Researchers use the McCullough
building, located near the Terman
engineering cluster, to test semi
conductors and integrated circuits.
Their experiments involve danger
ous chemicals that must be released
quickly into the atmosphere at great
pressure. When the nearby Durand
building was built, larger stacks
became necessary to discharge
hazardous waste particles above a
higher "boundary level."
In some of the experiments, hy
drochloric acid or sulfuric acid is

sent through tubes at high speeds.
During the last three weeks of
construction, the central building
ventilation at the McCullough
Building was shut down, resulting
in a reduced oxygen level. The
change in oxygen level was
"comparable to being in Denver
rather than Palo Alto," according to
Harris, an electrical enginneering
professor. All experiments ceased,
and classes usually held in the
building were relocated.
Experiments will resume when
all workmen leave the area, the ven
tilation system is back on and re
searchers receive an "all clear''
memo from Harris. No major health
problems related to the project
were reported. A spokesman from
the Stanford Health and Safety of
fice could not be reached for com
ment.
The stacks, however, are only a
temporary solution to the problem.
A new electrical engineering build
ing with improved facilities is slated
for construction in 1991, according
to Teigen, a facilities engineer in
Stanford's project management of
fice. The building will be part of the
Near West Campus, a collection of
new buildings planned to replace
older structures in the northwest
end of campus, behind the Physics
Tank.
