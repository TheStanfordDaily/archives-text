## Zimbabwe seeks independence 
### USA WOLF 
Poor financial support from the gov
ernment and a long history of depen
dence on South Africa have resulted in
an unsatisfactory rate of progress in
Zimbabwe since that country's war for
independence in 1980, the Zimbabwe
program director of Oxfam America
said in a speech yesterday at Florence
Moore Hall.
"When Zimbabwe won its war, the
real battle began," said Khethiwe
Mhlanga. Oxfam is a non-profit, inter
national development organization
that sponsors projects in Third World
countries.
Following the 1980 war, redistribu
tion of land and independence from
South Africa became the new govern
ment's primary goals. "We had a lot of
enthusiasm from every corner of the
country, but we lacked many of the re
sources to make our desires into
reality," Mhlanga said.
It is not only lack of resources that is
hindering the establishment of the
new Zimbabwe government, she said.
"We still need to continue our war of
independence. Our win is by no
means an end. We, and the other black
ruled African nations, need to break
our dependence on South Africa," she
said.
"There is an interrelatedness be
tween southern African countries
which stems from pre-colonial days,"
Mhlanga said.
To break this connection, the front
line states (including Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozam

bique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe) have formed the
Southern African Development Coor
dination Conference. The aim of
SADCC is to gain independence from
South Africa and to remove other
countries' dependence on that
country, according to Mhlanga.
Apartheid existed in Zimbabwe. It
may not have had the name, but it was
there. It is what we were — and are —
fighting against," Mhlanga said.
For 15 years prior to the 1980 war,
Zimbabwe was totally dependent on
South Africa for army hardware, indus
trial implements, food and transporta
tion. "Cutting the link will take time. It
unfortunately can't be done overnight.
Ninety percent of our import and ex
port must pass through South Africa,
and diverting our goods through An
gola, Tanzania or Mozambique will
take several years and money that we
just don't have," Mhlanga said.
Zimbabwe is also financially tied to
South Africa through multi-national
corporations that invest in both
countries. "The government would
like to buy out those corporations, but
we just can't. The best we can hope to
do is to buy 61 percent of the shares
and become controlling investors,"
said Mhlanga.
The establishment of cooperative
farms inhabited by ex-soldiers,
refugees and those hardest hit by the
three-year drought which began in
1981 was the government's first initia
tive following the war for indepen
dence. Abandoned and destroyed
farms were used by the new govern

ment to carry out the redistribution of
fertile land.
Mhlanga pledged her support for
the ideology behind the organization
of the cooperative farms but com
plained that the " government did not
provide the farms with enough sup
port.
"The farms, occupied by 30-40

families each, are manned primarily by
ex-soldiers who didn't know how to
farm, who didn't own any farm imple
ments or seeds and who didn't have
any food to eat. They were given noth
ing but land with potential," she said.
Though progress is slow, it is also
steady, Mhlanga said.
