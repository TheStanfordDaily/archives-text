## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Reform vote system

As predicted, voter turnout Tuesday was dismal.
According to ABC News exit polls, less than 40 percent
of eligible citizens exercised their democratic right to
vote. More than six Americans in 10 simply stayed home.
Although factors such as negative advertising and voter
apathy play a role in low voter turnout, the biggest obsta
cle to greater voter participation is this country's compli
cated and intimidating voter registration system.
Voter registration in this country desperately needs a
thorough overhaul. A simplification of the registration
process, coupled with a law making voter registration
mandatory, would go a long way toward ending
America's disgraceful tradition of low election turnouts.
According to a University of Michigan study, of the
Americans who made it onto the registration rolls in
1984, about 85 percent voted — hardly a bad rate.
The trouble is, many millions of eligible Americans
never become registered voters. And millions more reg
ister only to be bumped from the rolls because they have
moved, or have simply failed to re-register.
In California, registered voters who want to stay on the
rolls must re-register every time they move, even if their
change of address occurs within the same county. Addi
tionally, under current California law, a person has to
register at least one month before an election to be able
to vote in that election. Needless to say, hassles like these

discourage and drive away large numbers of potential
voters.
A bill currently pending in Congress proposes to mini
mize such problems by linking voter registration to Pos
tal Service change-of-address notices. Under the terms of
this promising bill, a copy of the change-of-address form
a person fills out for the post office when he moves
would be forwarded to election officials, who would
then automatically adjust his registration.
To promote greater citizen participation in the elec
toral process, voter registration should be made manda
tory. This is not the same as requiring a person to vote.
Mandatory registration would simply get the bureau
cratic requisites of voting out of the way early, thus en
abling everyone of the proper age to vote on election
day without having to bother with formalities. If registra
tion becomes law, the last excuse for not voting — "I
didn't register" — will be removed.
Considering that the very essence of the democratic
process hinges on participation in the electoral process,
a law requiring voter registration can hardly be con
strued as an excessive infringement of personal
freedom.
If our society can require that young men register for a
draft that doesn't even exist, it can certainly require that
its citizens register to vote in the elections that shape the
nation's future.
