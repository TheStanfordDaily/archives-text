# Suffering: a revelation for Ishmael
## 
### 
There once was a man called Ishmael. Ishmael was
a white Protestant with a wholesome face and an un
assuming nature. The age of social justice had
reduced him to a nonentity, since he was born equal.
Not that he didn't fight it. During his respectable col
lege career, he tried working for every organization
that asked him to join: the Homosexual Alliance, the
Feminist Center, New Jews for Jesus. He even wrote
editorials for the campus paper.

And he hated it. Everyday, Ishmael witnessed and
wrote about the suffering of others. When he could
stand it no longer, he packed up his scotch-plaid gar
ment bag and hopped on a bus to Crystal City, an old
mining town high in the Rockies that had been con
verted into a tourist attraction. Sublime snow-capped
peaks surrounded him, and the people lived in the
easy atmosphere of perpetual vacation. Ishmael was
given a job as a desk clerk in a hotel, with lots of food
and money. He made friends among the quaint
townfolk and decided that at last he had found a
place where people didn't suffer.
One of his new friends was Wally, the ex-Golden
Gloves champion of Atlantic City and town marshall
of Crystal City, who ambled around town in a big
cowboy hat. He shook hands with the tourists, held
up their kids for pictures and made everybody feel at
home in his big-hearted way.
There also was Bell, a rotund little woman who ran
a charming antique shop. She was always smiling and
occasionally dropped off to sleep in the middle of a
sentence.
There was the Kid, a teenager who had been to
Hollywood and who could sing a real snappy version
of "Misty." He went around town with his long black
hair slicked down and wore scarlet cowboy boots.
And there was Alberto, a little waiter from a bar
called the " '59er" that everybody liked. He didn't
seem to mind that he had a slight stammer and was
the only Puerto Rican in town.
Well, needless to say, it didn't take Ishmael long to
learn the truth. He had dropped into a nest of suffer
ing.
Wally actually hated tourists and had hostile im
pulses and then guilt feelings. At night, he caught the

same tourists he had catered to by day, beat them up
and then cut a little notch in their ears with a special
Chinese knife he had brought all die way from Atlan
tic City.
Bell hated antiques and only sold them to buy
morphine. What she really wanted was for someone
to burn down her shop so she could collect the in
surance money and get out of town.
The Kid was very bitter because his partner in their
singing and comedy routine deserted him in Holly
wood and was once seen on "The Love Boat," while
the Kid never got past working at Teeny's Tacos.
What the Kid really wanted was to make it big and
denounce his partner to the gossip columnists.
And Alberto was worst of all. To Ishmael he had al
most everything going for him. Not only was he
Puerto Rican with a stammer, a Catholic and practi
cally a midget, but "I'm q-q-queer, if you know what I
mean," he told Ishmael, moving closer. "I guess I
belong to almost all the minorities."
Ishmael couldn't stand it. Sometimes he would go
to Bell's house for dinner, and the whole gang would
just look at him sadly. Clean-shaven, prosperous,
well-adjusted, Ishmael could only sit and eat,
overcome with embarrassment.
Then Ishmael had an idea. He would personally
oblige each of his friends, carrying out their secret
desires and assuaging their suffering. They would be
happy at last.
"G-g-great," said Alberto. "Let me go first, Ishm-m
-mael. I mean, what's wrong with a f-f-few minutes in
the sack?"
"Not much, ah, I guess," Ishmael said nervously.
"Oh, f-f-forget it," Alberto said. "It ain't no fun if
you ain't enthusiastic. You're so s-s-straight you make
me sick." Alberto became so depressed he smoked
too much pot, and they had to lock him in the closet.
"I'm next," Wally said, taking Ishmael by the collar
and shoving him up against the wall. "I think I'm
gonna mash your face in,"he growled.
Ishmael closed his eyes and didn't struggle. "Go
ahead, Wally," he said.
But Wally let him go and started wringing his
hands. "It ain 't no fun if you don't fight back," he said,
grabbing one of Bell's kittens and cutting a notch in
its ear. "It's a thing with me, and I feel terrible about
it."
The Kid told Ishamel to interview him like a gossip
columnist and ask him about his ex-partner, which
Ishmael did.
"My ex-partner never did a thing for me," the Kid
said. "I don't owe that guy a thing. I want you to print
that. That guy is really terrible. I mean he really
messed me up leaving me with all those tacos."
Ishmael was going to ask him to sing his snappy

version of "Misty," but the kid jumped up and ran out
into the night, tears streaming from his eyes.
That night Ishmael burned down Bell's antique
shop. Flames shot high into the air. Bell danced
around, cackling and brandishing her insurance
policy, only to discover the next day that the policy
had expired years before. "I've never been so desti
tute," she announced.
There was no hope. Ishmael locked himself in his
little room in the hotel and wouldn't eat. He cursed
his inadequacy, ranted in an unobtrusive way against
the powers that destined him to pass a life of abun
dance and ease. At night, he would look down at the
street from his high window, aware that his friends
were there in the dark pursuing their hideous com
pulsions, made more rapacious by his efforts to
rehabilitate them.
On the third night there was a knock at Ishmael's
door. Alberto entered.
"S-s-soriy things didn't work out," he said.
"That's OK."
"Hey, Ishmael, you look p-p-pretty bad."
Ishmael sat heavily on the bed. "I'm never going to
make it,"he said.
"J-j-jesus, man, you're so hung up you're straight,
you've been making it up all along."
"What do you mean?"
"It's truth, baby. You been so hung up on not
being able to s-s-suffer that you've been s-s-suffering
all along. You're a wag that belongs to the original,
numero uno minority. I mean, you ain't got n-n
-nuthin' but yourself."
Ishmael couldn't believe it. He stood,
dumbfounded, groping for this eternal truth so
simple that it had always eluded him. The realization
was so forceful that he fell over backwards into his
bed.
"That's the idea," Alberto said, advancing. "I mean,
what's a f-f-few minutes in the sack with me?"
"No, no, you don't understand." Ishmael jumped
up. "Don't you see, Alberto, you've saved me. I
belong, I suffer, I am."
He danced around the room, throwing his hands
into the air and giving thanks.
"That's gratitude for you," Alberto said. "You're so
s-s-straight and alone and miserable, I can't stand the
sight of y-y-you."
He stomped out of the room.
Ishmael hurried over to the window and called
down to him in the street, thanking him again. Al
berto paused outside the '59er only long enough to
make an obscene gesture. Ishmael, happy at last,
returned it.

And he hated it. Everyday, Ishmael witnessed and
wrote about the suffering of others. When he could
stand it no longer, he packed up his scotch-plaid gar
ment bag and hopped on a bus to Crystal City, an old
mining town high in the Rockies that had been con
verted into a tourist attraction. Sublime snow-capped
peaks surrounded him, and the people lived in the
easy atmosphere of perpetual vacation. Ishmael was
given a job as a desk clerk in a hotel, with lots of food
and money. He made friends among the quaint
townfolk and decided that at last he had found a
place where people didn't suffer.
One of his new friends was Wally, the ex-Golden
Gloves champion of Atlantic City and town marshall
of Crystal City, who ambled around town in a big
cowboy hat. He shook hands with the tourists, held
up their kids for pictures and made everybody feel at
home in his big-hearted way.
There also was Bell, a rotund little woman who ran
a charming antique shop. She was always smiling and
occasionally dropped off to sleep in the middle of a
sentence.
There was the Kid, a teenager who had been to
Hollywood and who could sing a real snappy version
of "Misty." He went around town with his long black
hair slicked down and wore scarlet cowboy boots.
And there was Alberto, a little waiter from a bar
called the " '59er" that everybody liked. He didn't
seem to mind that he had a slight stammer and was
the only Puerto Rican in town.
Well, needless to say, it didn't take Ishmael long to
learn the truth. He had dropped into a nest of suffer
ing.
Wally actually hated tourists and had hostile im
pulses and then guilt feelings. At night, he caught the

same tourists he had catered to by day, beat them up
and then cut a little notch in their ears with a special
Chinese knife he had brought all die way from Atlan
tic City.
Bell hated antiques and only sold them to buy
morphine. What she really wanted was for someone
to burn down her shop so she could collect the in
surance money and get out of town.
The Kid was very bitter because his partner in their
singing and comedy routine deserted him in Holly
wood and was once seen on "The Love Boat," while
the Kid never got past working at Teeny's Tacos.
What the Kid really wanted was to make it big and
denounce his partner to the gossip columnists.
And Alberto was worst of all. To Ishmael he had al
most everything going for him. Not only was he
Puerto Rican with a stammer, a Catholic and practi
cally a midget, but "I'm q-q-queer, if you know what I
mean," he told Ishmael, moving closer. "I guess I
belong to almost all the minorities."
Ishmael couldn't stand it. Sometimes he would go
to Bell's house for dinner, and the whole gang would
just look at him sadly. Clean-shaven, prosperous,
well-adjusted, Ishmael could only sit and eat,
overcome with embarrassment.
Then Ishmael had an idea. He would personally
oblige each of his friends, carrying out their secret
desires and assuaging their suffering. They would be
happy at last.
"G-g-great," said Alberto. "Let me go first, Ishm-m
-mael. I mean, what's wrong with a f-f-few minutes in
the sack?"
"Not much, ah, I guess," Ishmael said nervously.
"Oh, f-f-forget it," Alberto said. "It ain't no fun if
you ain't enthusiastic. You're so s-s-straight you make
me sick." Alberto became so depressed he smoked
too much pot, and they had to lock him in the closet.
"I'm next," Wally said, taking Ishmael by the collar
and shoving him up against the wall. "I think I'm
gonna mash your face in,"he growled.
Ishmael closed his eyes and didn't struggle. "Go
ahead, Wally," he said.
But Wally let him go and started wringing his
hands. "It ain 't no fun if you don't fight back," he said,
grabbing one of Bell's kittens and cutting a notch in
its ear. "It's a thing with me, and I feel terrible about
it."
The Kid told Ishamel to interview him like a gossip
columnist and ask him about his ex-partner, which
Ishmael did.
"My ex-partner never did a thing for me," the Kid
said. "I don't owe that guy a thing. I want you to print
that. That guy is really terrible. I mean he really
messed me up leaving me with all those tacos."
Ishmael was going to ask him to sing his snappy

version of "Misty," but the kid jumped up and ran out
into the night, tears streaming from his eyes.
That night Ishmael burned down Bell's antique
shop. Flames shot high into the air. Bell danced
around, cackling and brandishing her insurance
policy, only to discover the next day that the policy
had expired years before. "I've never been so desti
tute," she announced.
There was no hope. Ishmael locked himself in his
little room in the hotel and wouldn't eat. He cursed
his inadequacy, ranted in an unobtrusive way against
the powers that destined him to pass a life of abun
dance and ease. At night, he would look down at the
street from his high window, aware that his friends
were there in the dark pursuing their hideous com
pulsions, made more rapacious by his efforts to
rehabilitate them.
On the third night there was a knock at Ishmael's
door. Alberto entered.
"S-s-soriy things didn't work out," he said.
"That's OK."
"Hey, Ishmael, you look p-p-pretty bad."
Ishmael sat heavily on the bed. "I'm never going to
make it,"he said.
"J-j-jesus, man, you're so hung up you're straight,
you've been making it up all along."
"What do you mean?"
"It's truth, baby. You been so hung up on not
being able to s-s-suffer that you've been s-s-suffering
all along. You're a wag that belongs to the original,
numero uno minority. I mean, you ain't got n-n
-nuthin' but yourself."
Ishmael couldn't believe it. He stood,
dumbfounded, groping for this eternal truth so
simple that it had always eluded him. The realization
was so forceful that he fell over backwards into his
bed.
"That's the idea," Alberto said, advancing. "I mean,
what's a f-f-few minutes in the sack with me?"
"No, no, you don't understand." Ishmael jumped
up. "Don't you see, Alberto, you've saved me. I
belong, I suffer, I am."
He danced around the room, throwing his hands
into the air and giving thanks.
"That's gratitude for you," Alberto said. "You're so
s-s-straight and alone and miserable, I can't stand the
sight of y-y-you."
He stomped out of the room.
Ishmael hurried over to the window and called
down to him in the street, thanking him again. Al
berto paused outside the '59er only long enough to
make an obscene gesture. Ishmael, happy at last,
returned it.

There once was a man called Ishmael. Ishmael was
a white Protestant with a wholesome face and an un
assuming nature. The age of social justice had
reduced him to a nonentity, since he was born equal.

that asked him to join: the Homosexual Alliance, the
