Letter evidence of
Cal's frustration
Well, what do you expect from a
Weenie? The answer, of course, is
nothing, and that's exactly what we
found in Terry Zaccone's letter (Daily,
Oct. 29).
The letter was nothing more than
another example of Berkeley frustra
tion; frustration over having lost Big
Game two years in a row, frustration
over having a 1-7 football team,
frustration over having Joe Kapp as a
head coach, frustration over having
"misplaced the Bear and frustration
over having attended Berkeley. It is
therefore no surprise that Zaccone
wrote a lener containing more inac
curacies than accuracies.
First, the entire premise of the
lener, that the Stanford Axe Commit
tee "re-engraved the Big Game Axe
Plaque so that die 1982 result is
'Stanford 20-19 " is wrong. The metal
plaque contains the original engrav
ing, and this engraving has never been
changed Vi e would also like to point
out the fact that this plaque flew on
the space shuttle and was certified by
NASA, correct score and all.
Furthermore, the Axe Committee
has documentation that shows the
final score of the game was indeed
Stanford 20, Cal 19. This includes a

photograph of the scoreboard with
0:00 on the clock showing the Stan
ford win, a picture of the referee
signalling the hall dead and a photo of
the Cal player holding the hall with
his knee on the ground.
Now that we have dealt with the
letter's inaccuracies, let us comment
on its one accuracy. Zaccone is correct
in saying that Stanford has a "high
quality, open-minded atmosphere."
That's probably why The Stanford
Daily printed his letter. Beat Cal!

Reagan Library
deserves scrutiny
The Reagan Library was approved
by the Stanford Board of Trustees in
1984 amid considerable campus
controversy After long negotiations
with the Reagan administration, two
critical issues appeared to be resolved
to Stanford's satisfaction prior to
acceptance of the library. These were
well publicized and quenched much
of the anti-library sentiment. The first
issue concerned the site of the build
ing. The probable location was
publicized to be distinct from the
main campus, in back of the Stanford
foothills near Interstate 280. The
second issue concerned the nature (if
the institution. The library would be

an academic resource, not part of a
larger complex including a public
policy conference center, exhibition
hall and museum run by the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation.
More than a year later we find that
Stanford has quietly made major
concessions to the Reagan administra
tion on both of these issues, with very
little opportunity for public input
(Campus Report, Oct. 8, 22). "Hie
approved site for the library is now in
the foothills overlooking Lagunita,
open space that is treasured by the
community. The site is immediately
adjacent to a footpath frequented by
joggers and families on weekend
strolls. The impact of an access road, a
large two-story building, a parking lot
for 300 cars, probably security
measures such as fences and lights
and 364,000 predicted visitors per
year will be devastating to this scenic
place. In addition, the architectural
plans contain a 350-seat auditorium
and a 10,500 square-foot exhibit area.
The grand concession on the part of
the Reagan administration to separate
the library from a public policy center
and exhibition hall was a sham. In
fact, Charles Palm, Hoover Institution
librarian and member of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation
Board, says that the Reagan Library
will hold about six public affairs
conferences a year, sponsored jointly
by the library and the Hoover ( San
Jose Mercurv News, Oct. 19).

We ask the Stanford Trustees and
President Donald Kennedy why Stan
ford (apparently) stood up to strong
Reagan administration pressure in
1984 only to give in completely in
1986. Could it be because opposition
from the Stanford community had
been placated? Since this is a distinct
possibility, we urge everyone who
opposes the presence of an externally
controlled public policy center on the
Stanford campus, and/or opposes
development of the Stanford foothills
(for any reason) to once again voice
their protest to the trustees and
Donald Kennedy.

More than a year later we find that
Stanford has quietly made major
concessions to the Reagan administra
tion on both of these issues, with very
little opportunity for public input
(Campus Report, Oct. 8, 22). "Hie
approved site for the library is now in
the foothills overlooking Lagunita,
open space that is treasured by the
community. The site is immediately
adjacent to a footpath frequented by
joggers and families on weekend
strolls. The impact of an access road, a
large two-story building, a parking lot
for 300 cars, probably security
measures such as fences and lights
and 364,000 predicted visitors per
year will be devastating to this scenic
place. In addition, the architectural
plans contain a 350-seat auditorium
and a 10,500 square-foot exhibit area.
The grand concession on the part of
the Reagan administration to separate
the library from a public policy center
and exhibition hall was a sham. In
fact, Charles Palm, Hoover Institution
librarian and member of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation
Board, says that the Reagan Library
will hold about six public affairs
conferences a year, sponsored jointly
by the library and the Hoover ( San
Jose Mercurv News, Oct. 19).

We ask the Stanford Trustees and
President Donald Kennedy why Stan
ford (apparently) stood up to strong
Reagan administration pressure in
1984 only to give in completely in
1986. Could it be because opposition
from the Stanford community had
been placated? Since this is a distinct
possibility, we urge everyone who
opposes the presence of an externally
controlled public policy center on the
Stanford campus, and/or opposes
development of the Stanford foothills
(for any reason) to once again voice
their protest to the trustees and
Donald Kennedy.

Letter evidence of
Cal's frustration
Well, what do you expect from a
Weenie? The answer, of course, is
nothing, and that's exactly what we
found in Terry Zaccone's letter (Daily,
Oct. 29).
The letter was nothing more than
another example of Berkeley frustra
tion; frustration over having lost Big
Game two years in a row, frustration
over having a 1-7 football team,
frustration over having Joe Kapp as a
head coach, frustration over having
"misplaced the Bear and frustration
over having attended Berkeley. It is
therefore no surprise that Zaccone
wrote a lener containing more inac
curacies than accuracies.
First, the entire premise of the
lener, that the Stanford Axe Commit
tee "re-engraved the Big Game Axe
Plaque so that die 1982 result is
'Stanford 20-19 " is wrong. The metal
plaque contains the original engrav
ing, and this engraving has never been
changed Vi e would also like to point
out the fact that this plaque flew on
the space shuttle and was certified by
NASA, correct score and all.
Furthermore, the Axe Committee
has documentation that shows the
final score of the game was indeed
Stanford 20, Cal 19. This includes a

photograph of the scoreboard with
0:00 on the clock showing the Stan
ford win, a picture of the referee
signalling the hall dead and a photo of
the Cal player holding the hall with
his knee on the ground.
Now that we have dealt with the
letter's inaccuracies, let us comment
on its one accuracy. Zaccone is correct
in saying that Stanford has a "high
quality, open-minded atmosphere."
That's probably why The Stanford
Daily printed his letter. Beat Cal!

Reagan Library
deserves scrutiny
The Reagan Library was approved
by the Stanford Board of Trustees in
1984 amid considerable campus
controversy After long negotiations
with the Reagan administration, two
critical issues appeared to be resolved
to Stanford's satisfaction prior to
acceptance of the library. These were
well publicized and quenched much
of the anti-library sentiment. The first
issue concerned the site of the build
ing. The probable location was
publicized to be distinct from the
main campus, in back of the Stanford
foothills near Interstate 280. The
second issue concerned the nature (if
the institution. The library would be

an academic resource, not part of a
larger complex including a public
policy conference center, exhibition
hall and museum run by the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation.
More than a year later we find that
Stanford has quietly made major
concessions to the Reagan administra
tion on both of these issues, with very
