# A 						sorority story
## 
### 
I just finished reading Gwen Orel's column (Daily, Oct. 30), and I must admit
that I was disappointed with her seance. Black clothes and Hawaiian Punch?
Conga drums and fresh vegetables? I wasn't "freaked out"; if anything, I felt only
anti-freak.
Has she forsaken her own generation, the children of the early '70s? Has she
emptied her mind of Linda Blair in "Born Innocent,' moon landings, Nixon's res
ignation and margarita songs heard by the swimming pool? Has she forgotten
how it once felt to take pride in being dirty? Or to be ridiculed by her peers for
reciting the pledge of allegiance incorrectly? I don't understand why in that
candlelight she missed the impact of her generation.
What Gwen (and everyone else) should do is watch a certain TV movie that was
aired in 1976, the bicentennial year. A girl with special powers named Beth starts

college. In spite of her powers, she is an oddball and not very pretty, so the cool
sorority drops her from its rush list immediately. Enraged by this callous rejec
tion, she meets by chance the house mother of an old sorority that, much like the
DUs, lost its universtiy recognition after some mysterious incident. Somehow the
house mother finds out that Beth has supernatural powers and entreats her to
help her rebuild the sorority. She tells Beth, "Girls once killed to join this
sorority. Please help me rebuild it to its former glory." She then implies that the
sorority wrongly lost its recognition due to campus politics, which entices Beth
even more.
Wishing revenge on the sorority that rejected her, Beth magically renovates the
creaky, wooden sorority house into a wonder of campus architecture. She even
paints it yellow. Then she and the house mother hold rush, but, in spite of the
beautiful house and good refreshments, all they can attract are overly mousy girls
and misfits. Still, the house mother is very pleased, and consequently, Beth is too.
But one day on the way to class, Beth runs into the head of her rival sorority, a
beautiful, blond campus queen. She ridicules Beth's sorority, adding that it's a
waste of a nice house. Furious, Beth uses her telepathic powers to throw the
queen into a fountain. Then Beth finds the house mother in the kitchen and
relates the incident.
On hearing it, the eyes of the house mother gleam. "Well, you must take
revenge, of course. Intersorority incidents like that cannot go unpunished." Beth
follows the house mother's command and finishes off the sorority queen by
magically locking her in the shower and burning her with scalding hot water until
the skin of her face falls off.
Beth returns from killing the sorority queen in time for the pledge ceremony.
She goes to the backyard of the house and comes across a peculiar procession.
The mousiest girl is being led by two other members, and she is wearing a ratty,
satin-fringed robe. Beth follows this procesion, which ends at a crude wooden al
tar that resembles hangman's gallows. On seeing Beth, the house mother smiles.
"You're just in time for the sacrifice," she says. Unable to believe what she's
seeing, Beth points out, "You can't just sacrifice a college student. The university
prohibits hazing." The house mother says, "Yes, but this isn't any sorority. You've
destroyed the enemy; all that is needed to recover our past glory is this." With
that, she brandishes a cleaver and raises it above her head so that it reflects the
light of the harvest moon. The two pledge attendants grab the mousy girl by the
hair and pull it back to expose her neck.
Beth, horrified at what she has helped to create, knows that only she can stop
this butchery. As the house mother drops the knife to the mousy girl's neck, Beth
screams, "No!" and telepathically forces the cleaver from the neck. The house
mother, holding the quivering knife, hisses, "You cannot stop this sacrifice. It is
written into the ceremony!" So Beth, having no choice, forces the cleaver into the
house mother's heart.
I don't remember what happened after that. Either Beth renounced her
powers, or she disintegrated into a pile of dust. But the point of this tale is not to
avoid the Gates of Hell or to prevent the DU's from gaining back their recogni
tion. It's just that nothing is ever too freaky in a vacuum.
