# Band gets the axe
## LSJUMB suspended from UCLA, Berkeley 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
Athletic Department Director Andy Geiger yes
terday suspended the University's marching hand
from playing at the UCIA game on Nov. 8 and
from marching on the football field at Big Game
in Berkeley on Nov. 22.
Geiger said the suspension is a reaction to "an
accumulation of problems."
The I.eland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band will be able to play from the stands at
Big Game, and 95 Band members will still accom
pany die football team to the Coca-Cola Bowl in
Tokyo, Japan, on Nov. 30 under conditions to be
set by the Athletic Department, Geiger said.
Geiger's decision, with which University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy concurred, followed a se
ries of incidents in which the Band members:
formed a four-letter word on the field at the San
Diego State game, dropped their pants and
urinated on the field following the University of
Washington game, refused to change a half-time
script for the USC game that Geiger termed
"insulting and lewd," and formed four-letter
word scrambles in the Washington State game.

"They're four-for-four," Geiger said. Kennedy
was unavailable for comment.
"I can't trust them. They don't seem to be able
to have a level of taste and values that represent
this place. As long as it's that way, they're not
going to perform on the same field as the football
team," said Geiger.
Band Manager Jeff Stevens said he understands
the decision, but added that he hopes the Band
can maintain its unique qualities.
"Andy (Geiger) was put in a position where he
had no other choice but to do something,"
Stevens said. "I don't blame him for what he's
done. I just hope that we can work something out
so that the Band can continue to maintain its iden
tity without putting him in a precarious position."
The suspension was in no way related to the
fact that the UCIA game is scheduled to Ix? broad
cast by CBS-TV in selected areas around the
country, said Geiger. He added that the
numerous complaints he has received from
alumni about the Band did not affect his decision
either. "That's a nuisance, but we get complaints
about a lot of things," he said.

der suspension, the Band cannot perform at UCLA this weekend
and must play from the stands during Big Game.
"I did it because I think there's a dif
ference between right and wrong, and
I just wasn't getting anyplace with it,"
Geiger explained. "The standards need
to be higher."
There have been numerous com
plaints about the Band in the past, but
Geiger said, "We haven't had quite the
four-letter words and urinating on the
field."
In response to Geiger's complaints
about the four-letter words, Stevens
said, "That wasn't the Band's intention.

The show wasn't charted out to spell
cuss words."
Stevens explained that individual
band members decided on the field to
change certain letters in order to form
different words. For example, Stevens
said, the five people forming the
middle-bar for the letter "E" might
change their position to form the letter
"C".
"We're not blaming this on any one
person," Stevens said, explaining that
individuals in the Band often try to
outdo one another.
The Athletic Department, which nor
mally funds trips for the Band, has can
celled the UCLA trip. Neither UCLA nor
Cal plaved any role in the decision to

suspend the Band, Geiger added.
Suspending the Band from march
ing on the field during Big Game
"sounds pretty ridiculous," said Cal
senior Band Manager Mike Nersesian.
"They haven't done anything violent or
harmful to warrant something like
this."
"The Band has a deep-rooted atti
tude problem," Stevens said. "We have
to change. If we don't change, we're
not going to exist. It's in our best inter
est and the interest of everybody in
volved to compromise â€” and they've
compromised more than us in the
past."
The Band has no specific course of
action planned yet, said Stevens.
