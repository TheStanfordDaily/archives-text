# Band gets the axe
## LSJUMB suspended from UCLA, Berkeley 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
Athletic Department Director Andy Geiger yes
terday suspended the University's marching hand
from playing at the UCIA game on Nov. 8 and
from marching on the football field at Big Game
in Berkeley on Nov. 22.
Geiger said the suspension is a reaction to "an
accumulation of problems."
The I.eland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band will be able to play from the stands at
Big Game, and 95 Band members will still accom
pany die football team to the Coca-Cola Bowl in
Tokyo, Japan, on Nov. 30 under conditions to be
set by the Athletic Department, Geiger said.
Geiger's decision, with which University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy concurred, followed a se
ries of incidents in which the Band members:
formed a four-letter word on the field at the San
Diego State game, dropped their pants and
urinated on the field following the University of
Washington game, refused to change a half-time
script for the USC game that Geiger termed
"insulting and lewd," and formed four-letter
word scrambles in the Washington State game.

"They're four-for-four," Geiger said. Kennedy
was unavailable for comment.
"I can't trust them. They don't seem to be able
to have a level of taste and values that represent
this place. As long as it's that way, they're not
going to perform on the same field as the football
team," said Geiger.
Band Manager Jeff Stevens said he understands
the decision, but added that he hopes the Band
can maintain its unique qualities.
"Andy (Geiger) was put in a position where he
had no other choice but to do something,"
Stevens said. "I don't blame him for what he's
done. I just hope that we can work something out
so that the Band can continue to maintain its iden
tity without putting him in a precarious position."
The suspension was in no way related to the
fact that the UCIA game is scheduled to Ix? broad
cast by CBS-TV in selected areas around the
country, said Geiger. He added that the
numerous complaints he has received from
alumni about the Band did not affect his decision
either. "That's a nuisance, but we get complaints
about a lot of things," he said.

der suspension, the Band cannot perform at UCLA this weekend
