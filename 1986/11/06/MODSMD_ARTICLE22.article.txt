## Parents ensure kids' insurance 
### FIONA ADAMSON 
When Steve Churchill, a resident as
sistant in Eucalypto, said "insurance
really sucks," he was voicing the senti
ments of many students who own cars.
Churchill owns an '83 Toyota
Corolla, which he has been driving for
six years with a perfect record. Most es
timates he received from local insur
ance agencies were for approximately
$1,000 per year. Ultimately, he ended
up insuring through his parents with
GUYCO. With his good student dis
count, they pay $850 per year to insure
his car.
"The high rates make me angry be
cause poor people can't afford it,"he
added.
The pleasure of owning a car at Stan
ford may become a nightmare when a
student is faced with the prospect of
buying auto insurance.
Churchill is only one of many stu
dents who have solved the insurance
problem by having their parents pay.
For most, it seems to be the only solu
tion. â€”
Local insurance agents, however,
report that many Stanford students are
listed among their clients.
Dave Moore of Allstate Insurance in
Palo Alto said, "We advertise heavily in
the Stanford community by putting ads
in The Stanford Daily and the campus
directory." According to Moore, All
state offers no good student discounts.
"They are kind of a gimmick," he said.
"A company which offers discounts
may have rates which are substantially
higher than ours."
State Farm insurance agent Jan Pum
pelly stressed the importance of age.
"Twenty-one is the magic year," she

said. "Rates drop way down once you
reach that age." The American Automo
bile Association, in fact, refuses to
insure anyone under the age of 21.
Insurance rates are largely based on
the owner's age, sex and driving
record and the car s make and model.
The person's area of residence is also
considered. "In general, the more pop
ulated an area is, the higher the rates
tend to be. Palo Alto tends to be more
expensive than Los Altos, yet less ex
pensive than San Jose," Moore ex
plained.
To get some idea of comparative
rates: A hypothetical 21-year-old
female, with a good driving record,
living on campus, driving a 1977 AMC
Hornet, went to local agents to find out
how much she would have to pay to
get her car insured for the year at the
minimum liability insurance coverage
required by California law: $15,000
bodily injury, $30,000 death and
$10,000 property.
Her rates would naturally tend to be
lower than average because of her sex
and the age of her car.
State Farm Insurance does offer a
good student discount of 25 percent
for males and 5 percent for females.
They recommended that the hypotheti
cal student insure for $25,000/
$50,000/$25,000. As a 20-year-old, her
rates would be $402 for a year.
However, supposing she was 21, the
figure would drop to $328 for a year.
The same plan at Allstate would cost
$560 per year; at 21, $356. The AAA of
course, would not insure a 20-year-old.
However, for the minimum coverage
plan at age 21, the cost would be $259
for a year.
All three companies had similar
policies on dropping people from in
surance. State Farm drops a new client
if he or she is cited for drunk or reck
less driving or if he/she has more than
two accidents. Pumpelly added that the
rules on accidents become more

lenient the longer the client remains
with the company.
The AAA drops clients if they have
had two accidents within a three year
period in which they were at fault.
Notwithstanding insurance prices,
Stanford students will undoubtedly
continue to own automobiles, and as
long as California law requires car
owners to hold insurance, parents will
continue to pay for it.
