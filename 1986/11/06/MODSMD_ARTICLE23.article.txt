# The 						politics of Daily limning

### TRACY FURUTANI Editorial staff 
Belying the exterior of a
relatively unassuming junior, Nalu
Won is one of the most widely read
people on campus.
Won draws "The Farm Side"
which, together with the syndicated
strip "Bloom County," is second
only to the crossword in feature
popularity.
"Last year, if you told me that I'd
be sharing a page with Berke
Breathed, I wouldn't have believed
you," said Won, a product design
major, joining a century-old line of
newspaper cartoonists.
With the publication of "Yellow
Kid" by the circulation-hungry New
York Journal in 1896, the modern

History
. . .1986

era of the newspaper comic strip
dawned. But, like crosswords, the
Daily Palo Alto (The Stanford
Daily's progenitor) would not have
truck with such an innovation.
So not until 1925 did The Daily
Palo Alto pick up what could be
labelled a "comic strip," but it really
wasn't.
Rather, "Sports of 1925" by Feg
ray, concentrated on the popular
sports of the era, using a popular
comic strip format of the era. Debuting
on Jan. 19, 1925, the one-panel strip
was drawn in the style of "Ripley's
Believe It Or Not," full of anecdotes
concerning, as you might guess, sports.
The strip also came with a paragraph
explaining the subject of the cartoon.
Murray's strip was syndicated by the
United Press and achieved nationwide
circulation. But it appears the Depres
sion caught up with either Murray or
The Daily; the feature disappeared in
June 1933 — an impressive run of
eight-and-a-half years, a record to
which no Daily strip has even come
close to holding a candle.
The longevity of Murray's strip might
be explained by its lack of risibility; it
couldn't offend anyone. Though
modern comics, as a whole, have come
increasingly under fire for their con
tent, the older comics have also had
their share of detractors — albeit for
the more basic reason of insulting the
reader's intelligence.
A particularly targeted strip was
"Mopsy," a one-framer by Gladys
Parker, the first female cartoon artist to
appear in The Daily. Her depiction of
the zany antics of a collegiate woman
were not widely appreciated by all.
"While reading my copy of The Daily
this morning I came upon a cartoon
entitled Mopsy. Subject of the limning
is a blackish mass which can roughly
be identified as a female human
being,' wrote one livid reader in 1939.
"The'balloon informs us of the charac
ter's cogent observations, i.e. 'Now
isn't that silly! I've taken a bath with my
clothes 0n.... The person or persons
responsible for the insertion of these
monstrosities owes the student body
an apology."
The Daily responded promptly by
dropping the cartoon.
Later, Charles Schulz's Peanuts ran
in 1978, but the San Francisco
Chronicle, which owned the exclusive
rights to the strip in the Bay Area,
figured that there was too much com
petition and arm-twisted United
Features Syndicate into cancelling the
strip in The Daily.
"We are very sorry for this unfortun
ate turn of events and even more sorry
that this kind of atmosphere exists be
tween newspapers trying to serve the
public," wrote The Daily in the space
usually reserved for the strip. In addi
tion, The Daily wrote an editorial on
the topic, soliciting cartoons and set
ting it up for letters on cartoons.

They were not disappointed on
either count. The strips that came out
of this period were along the Doones
bury/Bloom County line. One of the
four-framers was the popular (and
later syndicated) "Dupie" by Gil
Morales.
Even Dupie was not free of contro
versy; The Daily cancelled it for two
days in 1979 due to its content.
Another major strip to come out of
this period was "Gradepoint" and
later, "The Farm Report," both by Mark
Wilson. Eventually, Wilson's strips
made it into book form, appropriately
entitled "The Farm Report."

The present-day strips are mere
youngsters compared with some from
a half century past. Bloom County
made its first appearance in The Daily
on Feb. 1, 1984, while The Farm Side
began in March, 1985.
Bloom County is distributed
through the Washington Post Writers'
Group Syndicate. "We take (the strip),
we edit it, we print it, then we mail it,"
explained Al Leeds, the sales manager
of the syndicate.
"In the editing, we correct grammar
and punctuation, and, in the case of a
topical comic like Bloom County,
there's the question of libel and taste,"

Leeds said.
The Daily receives Bloom County on
a bi-weekly basis at a cost of $13 50 per
week, including delivery charges —
which translates to a $2.70 tab per
strip.
On the other hand, The Farm Side is
hand-delivered to The Daily.
The creative process for both strips
is, however, quite similar. Breathed
likes to come up with his own ideas,
said Leeds. However, Leeds did admit
he tries to influence what direction
Bloom County will take.
"I wanted him (Breathed) to do
something about personal ads," he

said. "So I waited until I saw one that
made reference to 'Bloom County' and
mailed it to him under the guise of
'isn't this funny?'"
A few weeks later, Opus, the per
sonals editor, appeared.
Locally, the process is not much dif
ferent.
Last year, Won collaborated with
junior Sam Dickerman on the cartoon.
"Sam was the idea man. I did all the art
work," said Won.
This year, though, Won discovered
that Dickerman had stopped out. In
stead of dropping the strip, he decided
to go it alone. "I get the ideas day-by

day," said Won, adding that he occa
sionally receives ideas from other
people, whom he credits by hiding
their names in the strip.
Won has had few problems with
censorship. The major instance he
cites is the "Diana Conklin, DU Little
Sister" cartoon which was cancelled
twice by Daily news editors last year.
"Finally, it ran towards the end of
(spring) quarter," recalled Won. "It
probably would have had more impact
if it had run (the originally scheduled)
day, but people still appreciated it."
Which is still the point after half a
century.

likes to come up with his own ideas,
said Leeds. However, Leeds did admit
he tries to influence what direction
Bloom County will take.
"I wanted him (Breathed) to do
something about personal ads," he

said. "So I waited until I saw one that
made reference to 'Bloom County' and
mailed it to him under the guise of
'isn't this funny?'"
A few weeks later, Opus, the per
sonals editor, appeared.
Locally, the process is not much dif
ferent.
Last year, Won collaborated with
junior Sam Dickerman on the cartoon.
"Sam was the idea man. I did all the art
work," said Won.
This year, though, Won discovered
that Dickerman had stopped out. In
stead of dropping the strip, he decided
to go it alone. "I get the ideas day-by

day," said Won, adding that he occa
sionally receives ideas from other
people, whom he credits by hiding
their names in the strip.
Won has had few problems with
censorship. The major instance he
cites is the "Diana Conklin, DU Little
Sister" cartoon which was cancelled
twice by Daily news editors last year.
"Finally, it ran towards the end of
(spring) quarter," recalled Won. "It
probably would have had more impact
if it had run (the originally scheduled)
day, but people still appreciated it."
Which is still the point after half a
century.
Belying the exterior of a
relatively unassuming junior, Nalu
Won is one of the most widely read
people on campus.
Won draws "The Farm Side"
which, together with the syndicated
strip "Bloom County," is second
only to the crossword in feature
popularity.
"Last year, if you told me that I'd
be sharing a page with Berke
Breathed, I wouldn't have believed
you," said Won, a product design
major, joining a century-old line of
newspaper cartoonists.
With the publication of "Yellow
Kid" by the circulation-hungry New
York Journal in 1896, the modern

History
. . .1986

era of the newspaper comic strip
dawned. But, like crosswords, the
Daily Palo Alto (The Stanford
Daily's progenitor) would not have
truck with such an innovation.
So not until 1925 did The Daily
Palo Alto pick up what could be
labelled a "comic strip," but it really
wasn't.
Rather, "Sports of 1925" by Feg
ray, concentrated on the popular
sports of the era, using a popular
comic strip format of the era. Debuting
on Jan. 19, 1925, the one-panel strip
was drawn in the style of "Ripley's
Believe It Or Not," full of anecdotes
concerning, as you might guess, sports.
The strip also came with a paragraph
explaining the subject of the cartoon.
Murray's strip was syndicated by the
United Press and achieved nationwide
circulation. But it appears the Depres
sion caught up with either Murray or
The Daily; the feature disappeared in
June 1933 — an impressive run of
eight-and-a-half years, a record to
which no Daily strip has even come
close to holding a candle.
The longevity of Murray's strip might
be explained by its lack of risibility; it
couldn't offend anyone. Though
modern comics, as a whole, have come
increasingly under fire for their con
tent, the older comics have also had
their share of detractors — albeit for
the more basic reason of insulting the
reader's intelligence.
A particularly targeted strip was
"Mopsy," a one-framer by Gladys
Parker, the first female cartoon artist to
appear in The Daily. Her depiction of
the zany antics of a collegiate woman
were not widely appreciated by all.
"While reading my copy of The Daily
this morning I came upon a cartoon
entitled Mopsy. Subject of the limning
is a blackish mass which can roughly
be identified as a female human
being,' wrote one livid reader in 1939.
"The'balloon informs us of the charac
ter's cogent observations, i.e. 'Now
isn't that silly! I've taken a bath with my
clothes 0n.... The person or persons
responsible for the insertion of these
monstrosities owes the student body
an apology."
The Daily responded promptly by
dropping the cartoon.
Later, Charles Schulz's Peanuts ran
in 1978, but the San Francisco
Chronicle, which owned the exclusive
rights to the strip in the Bay Area,
figured that there was too much com
petition and arm-twisted United
Features Syndicate into cancelling the
strip in The Daily.
"We are very sorry for this unfortun
ate turn of events and even more sorry
that this kind of atmosphere exists be
tween newspapers trying to serve the
public," wrote The Daily in the space
usually reserved for the strip. In addi
tion, The Daily wrote an editorial on
the topic, soliciting cartoons and set
ting it up for letters on cartoons.

They were not disappointed on
either count. The strips that came out
of this period were along the Doones
bury/Bloom County line. One of the
four-framers was the popular (and
later syndicated) "Dupie" by Gil
Morales.
Even Dupie was not free of contro
versy; The Daily cancelled it for two
days in 1979 due to its content.
Another major strip to come out of
this period was "Gradepoint" and
later, "The Farm Report," both by Mark
Wilson. Eventually, Wilson's strips
made it into book form, appropriately
entitled "The Farm Report."

The present-day strips are mere
youngsters compared with some from
a half century past. Bloom County
made its first appearance in The Daily
on Feb. 1, 1984, while The Farm Side
began in March, 1985.
Bloom County is distributed
through the Washington Post Writers'
Group Syndicate. "We take (the strip),
we edit it, we print it, then we mail it,"
explained Al Leeds, the sales manager
of the syndicate.
"In the editing, we correct grammar
and punctuation, and, in the case of a
topical comic like Bloom County,
there's the question of libel and taste,"

Leeds said.
The Daily receives Bloom County on
a bi-weekly basis at a cost of $13 50 per
week, including delivery charges —
which translates to a $2.70 tab per
strip.
On the other hand, The Farm Side is
hand-delivered to The Daily.
