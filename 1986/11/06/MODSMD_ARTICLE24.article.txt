# Independence for this first lady
## 
### AIMEE BERG 
Many Stanford students know Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy is
an avid runner. Most people, however,
aren't aware that his wife, Jeanne,
also keeps a vicious pace.
"I don't run, but I do run around a
lot," the Farm's first lady said.
The former mathematics major
from Smith College "has several parts
to her life," and plays many roles,
noted Audrey Bernfield, the director
of undergraduate advising and a
friend of Kennedy's for 19 years.
Two positions, though, make
Kennedy especially visible. At the
Stanford Hospital, she is the Director
of Community and Patient Relations,
but to most students, she is the presi
dent's wife.
Kennedy admits that her two jobs
often overlap, but Elizabeth Marin
cola, a former assistant to Jeanne
Kennedy, pointed out that "whatever
Jeanne does, she gives it all she can at
the moment."
She spends most of her moments
at the hospital. "Being first lady takes
much less of my time," Kennedy said.
"Jeanne works late at night, comes
in Saturdays sometimes and really
puts in long hours," said Amanda
Spielman, an administrative assistant
at the hospital.
Perseverance and dedication have
paid off, for Kennedy's responsibili
ties have grown since she started
community relations in 1979, "when
it was just me and a secretary."
She is now part of the senior man
agement and a part of the executive
committee that affects hospital policy
issues.
She developed the hospital's
volunteer program, and is currently

in charge of Community Outreach,
advocacy for patients' rights, Lifeline
(a medical panic button for the el
derly), internal publications and the
chaplaincy. She is also instigating a
major art program within the hospi
tal.
If that weren't enough, she has also
been vital to the development of the
Welsh Road apartments, which are
designed to accommodate patients'
relatives affordably.
In essence, Kennedy works to
match people and resources, accord
ing to Bernfield. When the resources
are absent or inadequate, she
develops them.
"She really believes in what she is
doing and the concept of the pro
grams she's developed. It gives her a
real sense of purpose to see the staff
doing what she set in motion," added
Nancy Manela, an assistant to the
director of Patient and Community
Relations.
"Mostly, she cares. She wants to
make a difference. She also wants to
be a person in her own right," Spiel
man said.
That means defying stereotypes.
Kennedy admitted, "Most people
have a real set picture of what a
(university) president's wife is like."
"The president's wife thing ... en
tertaining, dressing well ... comes
naturally for her," Marincola said.
However, Lisa Benton, manager of
Hoover House, the Kennedys' home,
said. Kennedy sees herself as "more
of a career woman."
"It's nice to see a president's wife
who has her own ideas. It shows you
don't always have to be in someone's
shadow," Bernfield said.
