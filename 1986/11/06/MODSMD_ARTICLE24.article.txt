# Independence for this first lady
## 
### AIMEE BERG 
Many Stanford students know Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy is
an avid runner. Most people, however,
aren't aware that his wife, Jeanne,
also keeps a vicious pace.
"I don't run, but I do run around a
lot," the Farm's first lady said.
The former mathematics major
from Smith College "has several parts
to her life," and plays many roles,
noted Audrey Bernfield, the director
of undergraduate advising and a
friend of Kennedy's for 19 years.
Two positions, though, make
Kennedy especially visible. At the
Stanford Hospital, she is the Director
of Community and Patient Relations,
but to most students, she is the presi
dent's wife.
Kennedy admits that her two jobs
often overlap, but Elizabeth Marin
cola, a former assistant to Jeanne
Kennedy, pointed out that "whatever
Jeanne does, she gives it all she can at
the moment."
She spends most of her moments
at the hospital. "Being first lady takes
much less of my time," Kennedy said.
"Jeanne works late at night, comes
in Saturdays sometimes and really
puts in long hours," said Amanda
Spielman, an administrative assistant
at the hospital.
Perseverance and dedication have
paid off, for Kennedy's responsibili
ties have grown since she started
community relations in 1979, "when
it was just me and a secretary."
She is now part of the senior man
agement and a part of the executive
committee that affects hospital policy
issues.
She developed the hospital's
volunteer program, and is currently

in charge of Community Outreach,
advocacy for patients' rights, Lifeline
(a medical panic button for the el
derly), internal publications and the
chaplaincy. She is also instigating a
major art program within the hospi
tal.
If that weren't enough, she has also
been vital to the development of the
Welsh Road apartments, which are
designed to accommodate patients'
relatives affordably.
In essence, Kennedy works to
match people and resources, accord
ing to Bernfield. When the resources
are absent or inadequate, she
develops them.
"She really believes in what she is
doing and the concept of the pro
grams she's developed. It gives her a
real sense of purpose to see the staff
doing what she set in motion," added
Nancy Manela, an assistant to the
director of Patient and Community
Relations.
"Mostly, she cares. She wants to
make a difference. She also wants to
be a person in her own right," Spiel
man said.
That means defying stereotypes.
Kennedy admitted, "Most people
have a real set picture of what a
(university) president's wife is like."
"The president's wife thing ... en
tertaining, dressing well ... comes
naturally for her," Marincola said.
However, Lisa Benton, manager of
Hoover House, the Kennedys' home,
said. Kennedy sees herself as "more
of a career woman."
"It's nice to see a president's wife
who has her own ideas. It shows you
don't always have to be in someone's
shadow," Bernfield said.

Kennedy shines on her own.
She attributes this partly to luck.
"I'm one of the few (president's) wives
who can work in the same institution
as my husband," Kennedy said.
Others attribute it to her incredible
motivation.
"She has a tremendous amount of
inner drive and energy," Manela
added. "(Part of it stems) from her
being surrounded by a lot of really
stimulating people in her professional
and private life. Her husband also sup
ports her career. It's a very positive
thing."
Kennedy is so driven and so busy,
that pressure is inevitable. Her minute
by-minute calendar is already booked
with meetings, luncheons and recep
tions through December 1987. Marin
cola believes Kennedy "thrives on it to

a degree, though she may not admit it."
"She lets it build, then she works
like a tiger until her desk is clean,'' ob
served Spielman. "She attacks her
work and really gets productive."
Though Kennedy takes her work
very seriously, "she is not afraid, given
an appropriate time and a place, to be
silly," Manela said.
Bernfield recalled the time Ken
nedy came to dinner and brought a
box of candies. "She and the children
poked a hole in each one to find out
what was in them and what they liked,"
she said.
Candy is not her only offbeat pas
sion.
"She is willing to sing at the drop of
a hat, even if she has no voice at all and
knows it," Spielman said. "I'll say
something, and it'll be a song cue flash
ing to her mind â€” she'll know all the
words. If not, she will make words up.
People will join in. I'm always amazed
at what comes out of her mouth."
In contrast, what comes out of Ken

nedy's heart is praised. Manela des
cribed her her as "a warm, gentle per
son with a real deep level of compas
sion and empathy ... for her patients
and her colleagues.

person with a deep

sion'

"She takes a real interest in her staff.
She makes sure things are going well
for you in your personal life as
opposed to just how you are doing
with your job," Manela said.
As a boss, she is unique. "She's a
mentor in a way no one else really can
be. When it's time for you to move on
in your professional career, she never

holds anybody back. She really encour
ages you to spread your wings and pro
vides opportunities to do so," Manela
said.
Since she works full-time at the
hospital, she "had to give up, though
not totally, larger contact with the stu
dents," Kennedy explained. "When
Don travels or does things with stu
dents, it's his job. When I do it, it's vaca
tion time."
To combine her love for both stu
dents and the hospital, Kennedy in
itiated the Human Biology internship
program many years ago. She wrote to
all the department heads at the hospi
tal, describing the Human Biology pro
gram and asked if there were any op
portunities for students there. The
response has been positive ever since.
Her work with interns enables her
to have close relationships with a few
undergraduates.
"It is clear that she coasiders stu
dents a high priority," Manela said.
"She goes over details with each

(intern), a task she could have easily
delegated to someone else."
Kennedy also increases her interac
tion with students by being the Direc
tor of the Lou Henry Hoover House,
where she organizes and hosts events
such as annual receptions for fresh
men, transfers, graduate students and
parents.
"When guests come over, they see
(the Kennedys) as a team," Benton
said. "They make people feel so
welcome and at home. It's an aura they
create together, and I think that's why
people have such a good time when
they come up here."
The first lady met Donald Kennedy
when she was 15. They went out after
graduating from high school, and they
married in 1960. At the time, she was a
junior at Smith, and he was a graduate
student. Later, of course, he would
become a professor, then provost, then
president of a university.
"I never thought being married to a
professor would be what it was. My

biggest revelation was realizing how
much I loved life at a university. There
are incredible opportunities to see and
know people of all different levels of
the world," Kennedy said.
When she's not busy escorting
Prince Phillip, as she did when the
Queen of England visited the Stanford
campus in the spring of 1983, she is
either reading, spending time out
doors, studying contemporary art or
dancing with Donald.
In fact, at one of their regular ap
pearances at the Viennese Ball, stu
dents were awed at the Kennedys'
wonderful waltzing. "Don was dipping
me and got my head to touch the floor,
which was a really big deal in our day.
Students gathered, watched this, and
asked, 'Will you teach us?' It's not easy
to do, and Don has never dropped me
yet," Kennedy said.
But if he ever did, she would
rebound immediately because Jeanne
Kennedy is, in the words of one friend,
"unstoppable."

not totally, larger contact with the stu
dents," Kennedy explained. "When
Don travels or does things with stu
dents, it's his job. When I do it, it's vaca
tion time."
To combine her love for both stu
dents and the hospital, Kennedy in
itiated the Human Biology internship
program many years ago. She wrote to
all the department heads at the hospi
tal, describing the Human Biology pro
gram and asked if there were any op
portunities for students there. The
response has been positive ever since.
Her work with interns enables her
to have close relationships with a few
undergraduates.
"It is clear that she coasiders stu
dents a high priority," Manela said.
"She goes over details with each

delegated to someone else."
Kennedy also increases her interac

where she organizes and hosts events
such as annual receptions for fresh

parents.
"When guests come over, they see
(the Kennedys) as a team," Benton
said. "They make people feel so
welcome and at home. It's an aura they
create together, and I think that's why
people have such a good time when
they come up here."
The first lady met Donald Kennedy
when she was 15. They went out after
graduating from high school, and they
married in 1960. At the time, she was a
junior at Smith, and he was a graduate
student. Later, of course, he would
become a professor, then provost, then
president of a university.
"I never thought being married to a
professor would be what it was. My

biggest revelation was realizing how
much I loved life at a university. There
are incredible opportunities to see and
know people of all different levels of
the world," Kennedy said.
When she's not busy escorting
Prince Phillip, as she did when the
Queen of England visited the Stanford
campus in the spring of 1983, she is
either reading, spending time out
doors, studying contemporary art or
dancing with Donald.
In fact, at one of their regular ap
pearances at the Viennese Ball, stu
dents were awed at the Kennedys'
wonderful waltzing. "Don was dipping
me and got my head to touch the floor,
which was a really big deal in our day.
Students gathered, watched this, and
asked, 'Will you teach us?' It's not easy
to do, and Don has never dropped me
yet," Kennedy said.
But if he ever did, she would
rebound immediately because Jeanne
Kennedy is, in the words of one friend,
"unstoppable."
Many Stanford students know Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy is
an avid runner. Most people, however,
aren't aware that his wife, Jeanne,
also keeps a vicious pace.
"I don't run, but I do run around a
lot," the Farm's first lady said.
The former mathematics major
from Smith College "has several parts
to her life," and plays many roles,
noted Audrey Bernfield, the director
of undergraduate advising and a
friend of Kennedy's for 19 years.
Two positions, though, make
Kennedy especially visible. At the
Stanford Hospital, she is the Director
of Community and Patient Relations,
but to most students, she is the presi
dent's wife.
Kennedy admits that her two jobs
often overlap, but Elizabeth Marin
cola, a former assistant to Jeanne
Kennedy, pointed out that "whatever
Jeanne does, she gives it all she can at
the moment."
She spends most of her moments
at the hospital. "Being first lady takes
much less of my time," Kennedy said.
"Jeanne works late at night, comes
in Saturdays sometimes and really
puts in long hours," said Amanda
Spielman, an administrative assistant
at the hospital.
Perseverance and dedication have
paid off, for Kennedy's responsibili
ties have grown since she started
community relations in 1979, "when
it was just me and a secretary."
She is now part of the senior man
agement and a part of the executive
committee that affects hospital policy
issues.
She developed the hospital's
volunteer program, and is currently

in charge of Community Outreach,
advocacy for patients' rights, Lifeline
(a medical panic button for the el
derly), internal publications and the
chaplaincy. She is also instigating a
major art program within the hospi
tal.
If that weren't enough, she has also
been vital to the development of the
Welsh Road apartments, which are
designed to accommodate patients'
relatives affordably.
In essence, Kennedy works to
match people and resources, accord
ing to Bernfield. When the resources
are absent or inadequate, she
develops them.
"She really believes in what she is
doing and the concept of the pro
grams she's developed. It gives her a
real sense of purpose to see the staff
doing what she set in motion," added
Nancy Manela, an assistant to the
director of Patient and Community
Relations.
"Mostly, she cares. She wants to
make a difference. She also wants to
be a person in her own right," Spiel
man said.
That means defying stereotypes.
Kennedy admitted, "Most people
have a real set picture of what a
(university) president's wife is like."
"The president's wife thing ... en
tertaining, dressing well ... comes
naturally for her," Marincola said.
However, Lisa Benton, manager of
Hoover House, the Kennedys' home,
said. Kennedy sees herself as "more
of a career woman."
"It's nice to see a president's wife
who has her own ideas. It shows you
don't always have to be in someone's
shadow," Bernfield said.

Kennedy shines on her own.
She attributes this partly to luck.
"I'm one of the few (president's) wives
who can work in the same institution
as my husband," Kennedy said.
Others attribute it to her incredible
motivation.
"She has a tremendous amount of
inner drive and energy," Manela
added. "(Part of it stems) from her
being surrounded by a lot of really
stimulating people in her professional
and private life. Her husband also sup
ports her career. It's a very positive
thing."
Kennedy is so driven and so busy,
that pressure is inevitable. Her minute
by-minute calendar is already booked
with meetings, luncheons and recep
tions through December 1987. Marin
cola believes Kennedy "thrives on it to

a degree, though she may not admit it."
"She lets it build, then she works
like a tiger until her desk is clean,'' ob
served Spielman. "She attacks her
work and really gets productive."
Though Kennedy takes her work
very seriously, "she is not afraid, given
an appropriate time and a place, to be
silly," Manela said.
Bernfield recalled the time Ken
nedy came to dinner and brought a
box of candies. "She and the children
poked a hole in each one to find out
what was in them and what they liked,"
she said.
Candy is not her only offbeat pas
sion.
"She is willing to sing at the drop of
a hat, even if she has no voice at all and
knows it," Spielman said. "I'll say
something, and it'll be a song cue flash
ing to her mind â€” she'll know all the
words. If not, she will make words up.
People will join in. I'm always amazed
at what comes out of her mouth."
In contrast, what comes out of Ken

nedy's heart is praised. Manela des
cribed her her as "a warm, gentle per
son with a real deep level of compas
sion and empathy ... for her patients
and her colleagues.

"She takes a real interest in her staff.
She makes sure things are going well
for you in your personal life as
opposed to just how you are doing
with your job," Manela said.
As a boss, she is unique. "She's a
mentor in a way no one else really can
be. When it's time for you to move on
in your professional career, she never

holds anybody back. She really encour
ages you to spread your wings and pro
vides opportunities to do so," Manela
said.
Since she works full-time at the
hospital, she "had to give up, though
not totally, larger contact with the stu
dents," Kennedy explained. "When

She attributes this partly to luck.
"I'm one of the few (president's) wives
who can work in the same institution
as my husband," Kennedy said.
Others attribute it to her incredible
motivation.
"She has a tremendous amount of
inner drive and energy," Manela
added. "(Part of it stems) from her
being surrounded by a lot of really
stimulating people in her professional
and private life. Her husband also sup
ports her career. It's a very positive
thing."
Kennedy is so driven and so busy,
that pressure is inevitable. Her minute
by-minute calendar is already booked
with meetings, luncheons and recep
tions through December 1987. Marin
cola believes Kennedy "thrives on it to

a degree, though she may not admit it."
"She lets it build, then she works
like a tiger until her desk is clean,'' ob
served Spielman. "She attacks her
work and really gets productive."
Though Kennedy takes her work
very seriously, "she is not afraid, given
an appropriate time and a place, to be
silly," Manela said.
Bernfield recalled the time Ken
nedy came to dinner and brought a
box of candies. "She and the children
poked a hole in each one to find out
what was in them and what they liked,"
she said.
Candy is not her only offbeat pas
sion.
"She is willing to sing at the drop of
a hat, even if she has no voice at all and
knows it," Spielman said. "I'll say
something, and it'll be a song cue flash
ing to her mind â€” she'll know all the
words. If not, she will make words up.
People will join in. I'm always amazed
at what comes out of her mouth."
In contrast, what comes out of Ken

nedy's heart is praised. Manela des
cribed her her as "a warm, gentle per
son with a real deep level of compas
sion and empathy ... for her patients
and her colleagues.

sion'

"She takes a real interest in her staff.
She makes sure things are going well
for you in your personal life as
opposed to just how you are doing
with your job," Manela said.
As a boss, she is unique. "She's a
mentor in a way no one else really can
be. When it's time for you to move on
in your professional career, she never

holds anybody back. She really encour
ages you to spread your wings and pro
vides opportunities to do so," Manela
said.
Since she works full-time at the
hospital, she "had to give up, though
not totally, larger contact with the stu
dents," Kennedy explained. "When
Don travels or does things with stu
dents, it's his job. When I do it, it's vaca
tion time."
To combine her love for both stu
dents and the hospital, Kennedy in
itiated the Human Biology internship
program many years ago. She wrote to
all the department heads at the hospi
tal, describing the Human Biology pro
gram and asked if there were any op
portunities for students there. The
response has been positive ever since.
Her work with interns enables her
to have close relationships with a few
undergraduates.
"It is clear that she coasiders stu
dents a high priority," Manela said.
"She goes over details with each

(intern), a task she could have easily
delegated to someone else."
Kennedy also increases her interac
tion with students by being the Direc
tor of the Lou Henry Hoover House,
where she organizes and hosts events
such as annual receptions for fresh
men, transfers, graduate students and
parents.
"When guests come over, they see
(the Kennedys) as a team," Benton
said. "They make people feel so
welcome and at home. It's an aura they
create together, and I think that's why
people have such a good time when
they come up here."
The first lady met Donald Kennedy
when she was 15. They went out after
graduating from high school, and they
married in 1960. At the time, she was a
junior at Smith, and he was a graduate
student. Later, of course, he would
become a professor, then provost, then
president of a university.
"I never thought being married to a
professor would be what it was. My

biggest revelation was realizing how
much I loved life at a university. There
are incredible opportunities to see and
know people of all different levels of
the world," Kennedy said.
When she's not busy escorting
Prince Phillip, as she did when the
Queen of England visited the Stanford
campus in the spring of 1983, she is
either reading, spending time out
doors, studying contemporary art or
dancing with Donald.
In fact, at one of their regular ap
pearances at the Viennese Ball, stu
dents were awed at the Kennedys'
wonderful waltzing. "Don was dipping
me and got my head to touch the floor,
which was a really big deal in our day.
Students gathered, watched this, and
asked, 'Will you teach us?' It's not easy
to do, and Don has never dropped me
yet," Kennedy said.
But if he ever did, she would
rebound immediately because Jeanne
Kennedy is, in the words of one friend,
"unstoppable."
