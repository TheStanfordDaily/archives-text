# It always pours when she's Rains

Mrs. Liliore Green Rains.
Stanford faculty, students and
alumni will learn this name, for they
will hear it and read it over and over
for a great many years to come. The ad
ministration already knows it well.
The reason: The late Mrs. Rains be
queathed $40 million to the University,
the largest bequest since the original
one by Leland Stanford himself.
The gift was part of a massive disper
sion of $240 million from the Rains
estate, a fortune estimated at over $250
million. Along with Stanford, three
other schools and two hospitals are re
ceiving $40 million donations.
The other schools receiveing gifts
are Pomona College, Loyola
Marymount University and Caltech.
The hospitals named in the will are the
Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los
Angeles and the Menninger Founda
tion in Topeka, Kansas.
Unlike the other institutions, Stan
ford had not previously received a do
nation from Rains, but the gift did not
come as a complete surprise.

Sandy Wilcox of the Development
Office said his department talked with
Rains a couple of years ago about a
possible gift, but that nothing came of
it at the time.
The money is being distributed in
two installments. The University has
already received the first installment of
$18.4 million, and the remainder
should come some time next year.
Stanford wasted no time in allocat
ing the enormous gift. Provost James
Rosse said that the money has been set
aside as matching funds for the Univer
sity's Centennial drive to be used for
student aid and for new professor
ships.
Rosse added that there might be
some money left over for other pro
grams, such as the building of a new
dormitory, but that will not be decided
until much later.
Rains' father was Burton Green, a
wealthy developer in Beverly Hills and
co-founder of Belridge Oil Co. When
he died in 1965 at age 96, he left his
fortune to be split between his three
daughters, Dolly Green, Burton Bettin
gen and Rains.
The Rains estate was dramatically in
creased in 1979 when Beldridge Oil
was sold to Shell Oil Co. for $3 6 bil
lion. From that time, Mrs. Rains
made substantial donations to some of
the institutions she ultimately named
in her will.

In 1980, she donated $1 million to
Loyola Law School to have a library
built in her husband's name, William
Rains. He was a 1926 graduate of the
school and had been a notable lawyer
before his death in 1947, only one
month after his marriage to Rains, ac
cording to the Los Angeles Times. She
later gave an additional $250,000 to
build a classroom buiding for the law
school.
In the 1950s and '60s, Rains was ac
tive in civic groups. She headed the Los
Angeles Girl Scout Council, the Califor
nia Association for Health and Welfare
and the Big Sister's League, according
to the Times.
A long-time resident of Beverly Hills,
she lived for many years in an enor
mous Georgian-colonial mansion that
she had built on four acres given to her
by her father. The property was sold to
talk-show host Merv Griffin this year
for $5 million.
Though she gave extensively to
many charities, she did not want to
receive any publicity for her
philanthropy.
"Her charitable requests were enor
mous, and that's all we would do — go
through them and decide how much to
give," a Green family employee said to
the Times. "She never wanted to be
identified, and she didn't even want to
have her picture taken, not even a
snapshot."

In her later years, Rains became ex
tremely ill and went into reclusion
from active social life. When she died
last November, there was no funeral
held for her, according to the Times.
Her reasons for choosing the institu
tions to which she gave gifts are un
clear because she made no official
statement, but her lawyer and the rep
resentatives of the schools involved
have their own theories.
"I'm sure she felt they were out
standing institutions, and I think she
took great interest in intellectual pur
suits," said James Doggett, one of
Rains' lawyers, according to the Times.
The gift will have a great impact on
Loyola Marymount. Its endowment
fund tripled from $20 million to $60
million with the Rains donation, which
was by far the largest in that school's
history.
The chancellor and former presi
dent of Loyola Marymount, Father
Donald Merrifield, was a friend of
Rains and offered possible explana
tions for two of the gifts.
"I understand that she had a nephew
graduated from Pomona College a few
years ago, and for Lily that would be
reason to leave them $40 million,"
Merrifield said, according to the Times.
He also remembered that Rains was
treated for a minor injury at Good
Samaritan Hospital: "I guess that was
enough for $40 million."

student aid and for new professor
ships.
Rosse added that there might be
some money left over for other pro
grams, such as the building of a new
dormitory, but that will not be decided
until much later.
Rains' father was Burton Green, a
wealthy developer in Beverly Hills and
co-founder of Belridge Oil Co. When
he died in 1965 at age 96, he left his
fortune to be split between his three
daughters, Dolly Green, Burton Bettin
gen and Rains.
The Rains estate was dramatically in
creased in 1979 when Beldridge Oil
was sold to Shell Oil Co. for $3 6 bil
lion. From that time, Mrs. Rains
made substantial donations to some of
the institutions she ultimately named
in her will.

In 1980, she donated $1 million to
Loyola Law School to have a library
built in her husband's name, William
Rains. He was a 1926 graduate of the
school and had been a notable lawyer
before his death in 1947, only one
month after his marriage to Rains, ac
cording to the Los Angeles Times. She
later gave an additional $250,000 to
build a classroom buiding for the law
school.
In the 1950s and '60s, Rains was ac
tive in civic groups. She headed the Los
Angeles Girl Scout Council, the Califor
nia Association for Health and Welfare
and the Big Sister's League, according
to the Times.
A long-time resident of Beverly Hills,
she lived for many years in an enor
mous Georgian-colonial mansion that
she had built on four acres given to her
by her father. The property was sold to
talk-show host Merv Griffin this year
for $5 million.
Though she gave extensively to
many charities, she did not want to
receive any publicity for her
philanthropy.
"Her charitable requests were enor
mous, and that's all we would do — go
through them and decide how much to
give," a Green family employee said to
the Times. "She never wanted to be
identified, and she didn't even want to
have her picture taken, not even a
snapshot."

In her later years, Rains became ex
tremely ill and went into reclusion
from active social life. When she died
last November, there was no funeral
held for her, according to the Times.
Her reasons for choosing the institu
tions to which she gave gifts are un
clear because she made no official
statement, but her lawyer and the rep
resentatives of the schools involved
have their own theories.
"I'm sure she felt they were out
standing institutions, and I think she
took great interest in intellectual pur
suits," said James Doggett, one of
Rains' lawyers, according to the Times.
The gift will have a great impact on
Loyola Marymount. Its endowment
fund tripled from $20 million to $60
million with the Rains donation, which
was by far the largest in that school's
history.
The chancellor and former presi
dent of Loyola Marymount, Father
Donald Merrifield, was a friend of
Rains and offered possible explana
tions for two of the gifts.
"I understand that she had a nephew
graduated from Pomona College a few
years ago, and for Lily that would be
reason to leave them $40 million,"
Merrifield said, according to the Times.
He also remembered that Rains was
treated for a minor injury at Good
Samaritan Hospital: "I guess that was
enough for $40 million."
Mrs. Liliore Green Rains.
Stanford faculty, students and
alumni will learn this name, for they
will hear it and read it over and over
for a great many years to come. The ad
ministration already knows it well.
The reason: The late Mrs. Rains be
queathed $40 million to the University,
the largest bequest since the original
one by Leland Stanford himself.
The gift was part of a massive disper
sion of $240 million from the Rains
estate, a fortune estimated at over $250
million. Along with Stanford, three
other schools and two hospitals are re
ceiving $40 million donations.
The other schools receiveing gifts
are Pomona College, Loyola
Marymount University and Caltech.
The hospitals named in the will are the
Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los
Angeles and the Menninger Founda
tion in Topeka, Kansas.
Unlike the other institutions, Stan
ford had not previously received a do
nation from Rains, but the gift did not
come as a complete surprise.

Sandy Wilcox of the Development
Office said his department talked with
Rains a couple of years ago about a
possible gift, but that nothing came of
it at the time.
The money is being distributed in
two installments. The University has
already received the first installment of
$18.4 million, and the remainder
should come some time next year.
Stanford wasted no time in allocat
ing the enormous gift. Provost James
Rosse said that the money has been set
aside as matching funds for the Univer
sity's Centennial drive to be used for
student aid and for new professor
ships.
Rosse added that there might be
some money left over for other pro
grams, such as the building of a new
dormitory, but that will not be decided
