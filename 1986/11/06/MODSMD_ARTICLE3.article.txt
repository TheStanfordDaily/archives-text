# Stanford: Role in S. Africa broad
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Staff writer 
Although Stanford's policy on divest
ment has dominated much of the
campus debate on South Africa, Uni
versity officials are quick to point out
that the University also plays a role in
South Africa beyond investment issues.
Because Stanford is an educational
institution, "it is a shortcoming that we
have been expending so much energy
on investment issues," said Steven
Peeps, director of University Relations
Though Peeps, a former member of
the Committee on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR), said investment responsi
bility is very important, he said other
issues are brought up by the South
Africa crisis.
In order to address the social needs
of black South Africans, the University
currently offers educational programs
at Stanford for black South Africans.
"Stanford is deeply committed to
furthering educational opportunities

here for non-whites in South Africa."

Stanford has established two one
year fellowships for non-white South
Africans who wish to pursue graduate
studies in any area, according to
Elizabeth Traugott, dean of Graduate
Studies. One fellowship was awarded
last year to a law student, and although
two were offered this year, only one
was accepted by a student in the
Graduate School of Education.
The fellowships are made available
through the South African Education
Program (SAEP), sponsored by the
Education Opportunity Council (EOC)
in South Africa and the Institution for
International Education in Washington,
D.C. The program each year brings 300
non-white South African graduate stu
dents to the United States, where they
are offered admission by numerous
universities.
Stanford has only offered a few of
these students admission to its
graduate programs in the past, but
Traugott said the University will offer
the fellowships again next year and
hopes to expand the program.
According to Peeps, Stanford is also
indirectly involved in MESAB (Medical
Education for South African Blacks,
Inc.), a group founded in 1985 with the
purpose of providing medical training
to South African blacks who wish to en
ter the health care profession.
MESAB is a national organization
founded by Herbert and Joy Kaiser,
former political counselors at the U.S.
Embassy in Pretoria, out of concern
over the lack of adequate health care

for blacks in South Africa. Although
Stanford is not directly involved, Peeps
noted that University President Donald
Kennedy's position as chairman of
MESAB's board of directors "is not in
significant."
In addition to the programs already
in place, Stanford has a few programs
"in the talking stage," Traugott said.
A mid-career program for South
African non-white professionals is now
under consideration. The program
would not grant degrees, but would
provide managerial and professional
training.
Mojalefa Ralekhetho, research
director of the EOC, visited Stanford
in August, during his tour of several
University of California campuses. He
was accompanied by John Markam,
head of a UC committee dedicated to

exploring education possibilities in the
United States for South African non
whites.
Ralekheto and Markam met with
representatives from Stanford to dis
cuss the possibility of implementing
the program as a joint Stanford-UC ef
fort, promoted by the EOC.
Stanford is presently waiting for a
proposal from Ralekhetho and the
EOC, and it is in the meantime explor
ing ways in which to develop the pro
gram.
The proposal for a program arises
out of a concern for the plight of blacks
in a black-dominated post-apartheid
regime, Peeps said. Very few blacks
have training in fields such as fiscal
management, civil management, urban
planning, journalism, law and other
professions.
"The mid-career level is probably
the most important for us to focus on,"
said Peeps. "Non-whites who hold
bachelor's degrees — and there are
enough (to fill a program here) — may
gain experience through programs in
the School of Education, the GSB,
maybe (the School of) Engineering."
Exchanges at other levels are
problematic, Peeps and Traugott
pointed out. At the undergraduate
level, there is difficulty due to the inad
equacy of South African black second
ary education, as well as problems with
assimilating the students once they
arrive.
