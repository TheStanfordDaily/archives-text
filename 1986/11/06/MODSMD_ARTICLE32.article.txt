## Delectable eating on the canals of Verona

Do you want to get away at midday for a dose
of delectable civilization? And catch a mouthful,
earful and eyeful of Western European delight?
Caffe Verona, located on Hamilton Avenue, sits
across from the Cardenal Hotel but is atmos
pherically light years away.

True to its name, the Caffe has an informal
set-up of small tables and high-backed wood
chairs both inside and outside, almost spilling
onto the sidewalk. Each table has a small bunch
of simple, fresh flowers vased in tall shot
glasses. High off-white warehouse ceilings give
a light spacious feeling, an airy aura. Low
hanging tempered glass lamps add a soft light
and a special charm.
As you enter the Caffe, you are greeted
audio-visually by remnants of old Europe stand
ing side by side with clean modern designs of
today. French opera and old jazz play back
ground to a gallery of enlarged, brightly

reproduced posters advertising Martini ver
mouth, French cigarettes, grands vins and boot
creme.
Lining one wall is a tall wood rack housing
750 bottles of wine, mostly white, mostly Napa.
Along the opposite wall is a shiny brass and
glass bar serving a multitude of foreign li
queurs, international beer, Italian sodas of
every color under the sun and caffe, from
espresso to latte to mocha to "con vov." The
coffee here is a great success judging by the lin
gering customers with trembling hands lifting
yet another caffeinated cup.
The menu chalked up on a board behind a

richly laden glass deli case offers various light
lunch plates. We recommend the combination
salad plate.
You choose between three or four salads dis
played in huge glazed bowls: pasta salad with
chicken doused in olive oil, seasoned with
capers, thyme, red and green peppers and
slivers of zuchinni; cranberry bean salad with
thin strips of Italian salami, small chunks of
tomato and a little piece of yellow egg; and
traditional greek salad with plenty of feta
cheese, fresh and sharp.
The essential flavor underlying each of these
dishes is the olive oil, slightly green and

definitely Southern. Each was served with a
fresh warm baguette.
For dessert, once again we let ourselves go.
Intrigued by the mysterious "caffe con vov,' we
ordered one with sweet brittle biscotti. "Vov is
liqueur Zabaione, with a pleasant vanilla taste
that mellows a cappuccino into melting
warmth. Our great downfall was "Opulence, a
thick wedge of chocolate corruption: moussey,
fudgy, frosting, shavings, chocolate, chocolate,
chocolate. To finish, each of us had a hot,
slightly bitter shot of espresso, a good dosage
of digestive caffeine to rise us from the depths
of indulgence.
