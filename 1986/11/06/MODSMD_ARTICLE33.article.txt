# Southern Cal: the land we love to hate
## 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN 
Despite the large number of South
ern Californians at Stanford, we seem
to have an extreme repulsion for our
sister cities to the south. Perhaps, it is
because UCLA goes to the Rose Bowl
too often. Maybe we're jealous be
cause Los Angelites drink our fresh
water and pollute our air. Then again,
it could be because the USC band
makes us sick.
Despite all its faults, however, South
ern California has numerous attrac
tions well worth making the weekend
trip to see.
The Queen Mary
Just over 50 years ago, the R.M.S.
Queen Mary left its drydock at John
Brown's shipyard in Scotland to begin
a glorious career. After 1,001 trans-At
lantic crossings it was retired to
become a living museum and hotel in
Long Beach.
The ship is the last surviving mem
ber of what was once a large family of
grand ocean liners. Most of its sisters
were the victims of German U-boats
during World War 11.
Walking the Queen Mary's decks,
one gets the feeling of a grand era long
since passed. Most of the ship is open
to visitors. The upper decks are open
for guests to roam freely. Signs
throughout the ship identify various
rooms and exhibits.
The long promenade deck is lined

with numerous photographs of the
rich and famous who once were
among the Queen's distinguished pas
sengers. The rear sun deck is adorned
with guns similar to the ones that
protected the Queen Mary during her
wartime service.
The parts of the ship not open to the
general public are open during daily
"Captain's Tours." The tour goes
throughout the ship's restricted areas,
including the original indoor swim
ming pool (used in the filming of the
movie "Goliath Awaits"), the engine
and boiler rooms (used in the filming
of "The Poseidon Adventure") and
many of the original suites and
staterooms.
As with all ships after the Titanic dis
aster, the Queen Mary is equipped
with enough lifeboats for all 3,131
people aboard. Its lifeboats are still in
tact, and four times each day the ship's
officers simulate a lifeboat drill.
The lounges are still alive, both day
and night. During the day, the ship's
entertainers present a 35-minute
Broadway style review. At night, the
lounges are open for drinking and
dancing.
The Spruce Goose
The Spruce Goose is the biggest
aircraft the world has ever seen. The
Goose is on display under a huge
dome adjacent to the Queen Mary at
Long Beach Harbor.
The Spruce Goose was Howard

Hughes' dreamchild and the pride of
Hughes Aircraft engineers during the
1930s and '40s. The aircraft is so large
that a 747 jet can fit ui.d~r each wing.
The Goose display includes an elabo
rate multimedia museum depicting the
life and times Howard Hughes.
Disneyland
Gone are the old A, B, C, D and E
tickets to get on the rides. But that's all
that has changed. Mickey Mouse,
Dopey, Snow White and the rest of the
Disney clan still roam the park enter
taining the kiddies. Disneyland, the
original "Theme Park," is still a place
of wonder and magic.
The park is divided into six lands:
Frontierland, Tomorrowland, Adven
tureland, Fantasyland, New Orleans
Square and Bear Country. The lines are
always longest around the ever
popular Space Mountain and Matter
horn roller coaster.
The Haunted House would make
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas en
vious. For those with a nautical inclina
tion, Pirates of the Carribean is a won
derful boat ride through a series of un
derground caverns inhabited by a ran
corous band of merry pirates.
If you stay into the evening, there is
a nightly "Electric Parade" and
fireworks display. Both are beautiful,
but not necessarily worth the wait. If
you want to spend an hour riding the
attractions without waiting in lines,
skip the parade and head straight for

the roller coasters.
Universal Studios
At Universal Studios, your guide
is more likely to be a local high school

student or an unemployed actress than
a famous star. But, the huge studio tour
is nonetheless the requisite stop on
any Southern California trip.
During your tour, you will ride in
open-air trams to various non-working
sets. The tour shows several examples

of how Hollywood mixes its magic to
create its effects.
The newest feature is a huge King
Kong that attacks the tour trams. Other
highlights include being attacked by
"Jaws" and being swept away in a flash
flood.

The Haunted House would make
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas en
vious. For those with a nautical inclina
tion, Pirates of the Carribean is a won
derful boat ride through a series of un
derground caverns inhabited by a ran
corous band of merry pirates.
If you stay into the evening, there is
a nightly "Electric Parade" and
fireworks display. Both are beautiful,
but not necessarily worth the wait. If
you want to spend an hour riding the

skip the parade and head straight for

the roller coasters.
Universal Studios
At Universal Studios, your guide
is more likely to be a local high school

student or an unemployed actress than
a famous star. But, the huge studio tour
is nonetheless the requisite stop on
any Southern California trip.
During your tour, you will ride in
open-air trams to various non-working
sets. The tour shows several examples

of how Hollywood mixes its magic to
create its effects.
The newest feature is a huge King
Kong that attacks the tour trams. Other
highlights include being attacked by
"Jaws" and being swept away in a flash
flood.

The R.M.S. Queen Mary, docked at Long Beach Harbor, is one of many attractions in Southern California.
Despite the large number of South
ern Californians at Stanford, we seem
to have an extreme repulsion for our
sister cities to the south. Perhaps, it is
because UCLA goes to the Rose Bowl
too often. Maybe we're jealous be
cause Los Angelites drink our fresh
water and pollute our air. Then again,
it could be because the USC band
makes us sick.
Despite all its faults, however, South
ern California has numerous attrac
tions well worth making the weekend
trip to see.
The Queen Mary
Just over 50 years ago, the R.M.S.
Queen Mary left its drydock at John
Brown's shipyard in Scotland to begin
a glorious career. After 1,001 trans-At
lantic crossings it was retired to
become a living museum and hotel in
Long Beach.
The ship is the last surviving mem
ber of what was once a large family of
grand ocean liners. Most of its sisters
were the victims of German U-boats
during World War 11.
Walking the Queen Mary's decks,
one gets the feeling of a grand era long
since passed. Most of the ship is open
to visitors. The upper decks are open
for guests to roam freely. Signs
throughout the ship identify various
rooms and exhibits.
The long promenade deck is lined

with numerous photographs of the
rich and famous who once were
among the Queen's distinguished pas
sengers. The rear sun deck is adorned
with guns similar to the ones that
protected the Queen Mary during her
wartime service.
The parts of the ship not open to the
general public are open during daily
"Captain's Tours." The tour goes
throughout the ship's restricted areas,
including the original indoor swim
ming pool (used in the filming of the
movie "Goliath Awaits"), the engine
and boiler rooms (used in the filming
of "The Poseidon Adventure") and
many of the original suites and
staterooms.
As with all ships after the Titanic dis
aster, the Queen Mary is equipped
with enough lifeboats for all 3,131
people aboard. Its lifeboats are still in
tact, and four times each day the ship's
officers simulate a lifeboat drill.
The lounges are still alive, both day
and night. During the day, the ship's
entertainers present a 35-minute
Broadway style review. At night, the
lounges are open for drinking and
dancing.
The Spruce Goose
The Spruce Goose is the biggest
aircraft the world has ever seen. The
Goose is on display under a huge
dome adjacent to the Queen Mary at
Long Beach Harbor.
The Spruce Goose was Howard

Hughes' dreamchild and the pride of
Hughes Aircraft engineers during the
1930s and '40s. The aircraft is so large
that a 747 jet can fit ui.d~r each wing.
The Goose display includes an elabo
rate multimedia museum depicting the
life and times Howard Hughes.
Disneyland
Gone are the old A, B, C, D and E
tickets to get on the rides. But that's all
that has changed. Mickey Mouse,
Dopey, Snow White and the rest of the
Disney clan still roam the park enter
taining the kiddies. Disneyland, the
original "Theme Park," is still a place
of wonder and magic.
The park is divided into six lands:
Frontierland, Tomorrowland, Adven
tureland, Fantasyland, New Orleans
Square and Bear Country. The lines are
always longest around the ever
popular Space Mountain and Matter
horn roller coaster.
The Haunted House would make
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas en
vious. For those with a nautical inclina
tion, Pirates of the Carribean is a won
derful boat ride through a series of un
derground caverns inhabited by a ran
corous band of merry pirates.
