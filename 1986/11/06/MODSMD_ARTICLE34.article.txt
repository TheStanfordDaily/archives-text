## Card beats UOP; takes NorPac lead 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
After 65 minutes and 23 seconds of a relentless
Stanford attack, Cardinal junior Ami Chitwood
scored the goal that in all likelihood will put Stan
ford into the NCAA regionals, as the Cardinal field
hockey team defeated the University of the Pacific
1-0 in Stockton to move into first place in the
Northern Pacific Conference with only one game
to play.
The win, Stanford's ninth straight, upped the
Cardinal's league record to 5-1-1, 11-4-1 overall.
UOP trails Stanford by one point in the NorPac
race with a 5-2-0 mark, 7-6-0 overall.
Stanford concludes its regular season schedule
tomorrow at home against last-place Chico State,
while UOP travels to Berkeley Saturday to meet
California. A Cardinal win, a Tiger loss or two ties
would clinch the title for Stanford.
There is no official tiebreaking policy in the
NorPac, but should Stanford and UOP finish even,
the Cardinal would be the overwhelming choice
for the NCAA berth on the strength of its better
overall record and its three wins over the Tigers
this year.
The third of those three wins was undoubtedly
the most impressive, as Stanford was in complete
command from die opening whistle. The Card
inal outshot the Tigers 35-7 and had 17 penalty
corners to IJOP's two.
"(Yesterday) was probably the best I've ever

seen them play," Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson
said. "They really dominated the game.
"Everyone pressured them so much and kept
the ball on attack," Johnson continued. "It was
just down there (in the UOP end) the whole
game."
"We were a team out there," Stanford
goalkeeper Karen Jones said. "We looked good.
We were taking a lot of shots."
A lot of shots? Just ask UOP goalkeeper Shari
Megginson, who must have been wondering why
no one had offered her a cigarette or a blindfold.
Megginson made a phenomenal 25 saves to keep
the Tigers in the game.
"She has had an incredible season," Johnson
said. "It's hard to get a straight shot by her. It
usually has to be a rebound shot."
Jones, on the other hand, should have traded in
her mask and pads for a pair of binoculars. She
had to make only two saves to record her ninth
shutout of the year.
Did the lack of action bother her?
"I didn't mind it at all," she said. "Our defense
played great."
Despite the Cardinal's dominance, however, it
appeared that Megginson would get the Tigers
into overtime. "She had an amazing game," Jones
said. "I didn't know if we would ever get one by
her."

With less than five minutes remaining, Kat Thomas saved
a pass at the right endline and sent it toward Megginson,
who sent it right back. Lena Slachmuijlder then crossed the
ball in front to Chitwood, who fired inside the left post
before Megginson could recover.
It was Chitwood's second goal of the season; the first
came in another 10 Stanford win over UOP Oct. 4.
According to Jones, Stanford was determined to take the
NorPac lead. "People were really up," she said. "1 could
really sense it on the drive over. They (the Tigers) were in
first, and that's where we wanted to be."
