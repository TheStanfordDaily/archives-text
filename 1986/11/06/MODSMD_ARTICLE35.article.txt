# Kapp given the axe
## 
### 
Joe Kapp, the beleaguered head
coach of the 1-7 California football
team, was informed yesterday' that he
will not return next year to coach the
Golden Bears.
Kapp will continue his coaching
duties for the final three games of the
1986 season, according to Cal Athletic
Director Dave Maggard, who made the
announcement at an afternoon press
conference.
The firing had been anticipated for
some time, and rumors were fueled
after Maggard met with Kapp in the Cal
locker room following the Bears 27-9
loss to Oregon last Saturday.
Maggard apparendy asked Kapp for
his resignation, and when the fifth-year
coach refused, Maggard's hand was
forced.
"Joe felt that he could not resign,
and as a consequence, I am indicating
that he will not return next year," Mag
gard said yesterday.
Kapp, who had never coached prior
to being hired by Cal, has a 19-32-1
record in his five years at Berkeley.
