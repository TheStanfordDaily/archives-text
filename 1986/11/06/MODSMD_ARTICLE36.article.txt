# No. 10 spikers host No. 2 UOP
## Teams meet in rematch of last year's championship 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
You're going to need a good excuse to justify miss
ing this one.
Tonight in Maples Pavilion, at 7:30, No. 10
Stanford will take on No. 2 University of the Pacific in
a women's volleyball match that, if it is anything like
the last few meetings of these two teams, will be as
exciting a volleyball match as you're ever likely to
see.
When the Cardinal and Tigers last met at UOP on
Sept. 24, the Tigers won in five games, with neither
team ever being held under 10 points. Stanford was
up 14-11 in the final game, when UOP fought back
with four clutch blocks and rallied to win 17-15.
Last year, the Cardinal first beat the Tigers — again
in five with each team scoring in double fig
ures in each game — and then lost jp them in four
games, 15-17, 15-7, 15-12, 15-13.
That four-game match wasn't just another Cardinal-
Tiger nailbiter; it was the NCAA championship game.
The defending champs have all but one of their big
guns back and will have their top gun back for the
next two years as well. She is Elaina Oden, undis
putably the UOP leader, and arguably the nation's top
collegiate player.
Oden earned a career's worth of honors as a fresh
man last fall, including being named to the All-
America first team and the All-NCAA tournament
team. Stanford Coach Don Shaw said he could not
recall another spiker who has been first-team All-
America as a freshman since a certain Cardinal
named Kim Oden.
It used to be that Elaina was known as Kim's sister,
but with Kim now graduated from college and with

Elaina perhaps the country's best collegian, you may
now hear Kim referred to as Elaina's sister. The elder
Oden, of course, led Stanford to the Final Four each
of the last four years.
Shaw gave the Tigers nothing but rave reviews.
"They're the team to beat for the national champion
ship," he said. "They're easily in first place in the best
conference in volleyball. They're dominating the
PCAA (Pacific Coast Athletic Association), which has
six of the nation's top 11 ranked teams."
And Shaw expects this to be the case beyond this
season. "As long as they have Elaina," he said,
"they're the team to beat."
However, according to Shaw, the Cardinal will
have to do more than stop Oden to stop UOP. With
Terry McGrath, Liz Hert and her twin Dorothy Hert,
UOP would be among the nation's best even without
Oden. Still, the sophomore leads the Tigers in kills
with 249, for a .329 hitting percentage.
The Cardinal is 14-7 overall and, most importantly,
10-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The spikers are in
second place — a half-game behind UCLA — and far
ahead of the rest of the conference's teams, virtually
insuring them a NCAA playoff bid. Pacific is 23-3,12-1
in the PCAA. They are ranked only behind Brigham
Young.
Shaw said UOP is "one of the hottest teams in the
nation right now" and that the Tigers are markedly
better than they were in September. Stanford has
also raised the level of its game and has lost only two
of its last 12 matches.
While they are the defending national champions
and are ranked second in the nation, the Tigers will
take tonight's match very seriously, according to
Shaw. "They respect us," he said. "They know we're a

team to be reckoned with."
Their respect would not be so great if Nancy Reno
had not escaped the reinjury of her right ankle last
Friday night with only minor effects. Late in the first
game versus Oregon State, the middle blocker
became entangled with both the net and an OSU
player who had gone over the court's center line.
Reno came down badly on her ankle, re-straining liga
ments she had pulled at the beginning of the season.
Reno said the ankle was stiff and slightly painful
the next night versus Oregon and that it slowed her
down, but she said that as long as a similar accident
does not occur again, she does not expect it to
bother her.
As a team, Shaw said the Cardinal have just a few
aches and pains, and that he "would hope that
adrenaline will cure any minor injuries" that might
distract the players tonight.
Something that Shaw hopes will distract the team
tonight is a large, rowdy Maples crowd, such as those
that he said have been a major plus for Stanford in
recent years. "It would be sad to see their fans out
number ours at our home court,"he said, adding that
UOP will reportedly have three busloads of students
at tonight's contest.
The difference between a very successful season
and only a successful season for Stanford this year
will not be crowd size, though. As they showed while
defeating No. 15 OSU last Saturday, the spikers are
susceptible to falling behind in communication and
concentration.
"We have occasional lapses in concentration,"
Reno said, "and that has been a problem since the
beginning of the season."

defeating No. 15 OSU last Saturday, the spikers are
susceptible to falling behind in communication and
concentration.
"We have occasional lapses in concentration,"
Reno said, "and that has been a problem since the
beginning of the season."

championship game, which saw UOP rally to defeat the Cardinal in four

Pavilion.
You're going to need a good excuse to justify miss
ing this one.
Tonight in Maples Pavilion, at 7:30, No. 10
Stanford will take on No. 2 University of the Pacific in
a women's volleyball match that, if it is anything like
the last few meetings of these two teams, will be as
exciting a volleyball match as you're ever likely to
see.
When the Cardinal and Tigers last met at UOP on
Sept. 24, the Tigers won in five games, with neither
team ever being held under 10 points. Stanford was
up 14-11 in the final game, when UOP fought back
with four clutch blocks and rallied to win 17-15.
Last year, the Cardinal first beat the Tigers — again
in five with each team scoring in double fig
ures in each game — and then lost jp them in four
games, 15-17, 15-7, 15-12, 15-13.
That four-game match wasn't just another Cardinal-
Tiger nailbiter; it was the NCAA championship game.
The defending champs have all but one of their big
guns back and will have their top gun back for the
next two years as well. She is Elaina Oden, undis
putably the UOP leader, and arguably the nation's top
collegiate player.
Oden earned a career's worth of honors as a fresh
man last fall, including being named to the All-
America first team and the All-NCAA tournament
team. Stanford Coach Don Shaw said he could not
recall another spiker who has been first-team All-
America as a freshman since a certain Cardinal
named Kim Oden.
It used to be that Elaina was known as Kim's sister,
but with Kim now graduated from college and with

Elaina perhaps the country's best collegian, you may
now hear Kim referred to as Elaina's sister. The elder
Oden, of course, led Stanford to the Final Four each
of the last four years.
Shaw gave the Tigers nothing but rave reviews.
"They're the team to beat for the national champion
ship," he said. "They're easily in first place in the best
conference in volleyball. They're dominating the
PCAA (Pacific Coast Athletic Association), which has
six of the nation's top 11 ranked teams."
And Shaw expects this to be the case beyond this
season. "As long as they have Elaina," he said,
"they're the team to beat."
However, according to Shaw, the Cardinal will
have to do more than stop Oden to stop UOP. With
Terry McGrath, Liz Hert and her twin Dorothy Hert,
UOP would be among the nation's best even without
Oden. Still, the sophomore leads the Tigers in kills
with 249, for a .329 hitting percentage.
The Cardinal is 14-7 overall and, most importantly,
10-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The spikers are in
second place — a half-game behind UCLA — and far
ahead of the rest of the conference's teams, virtually
insuring them a NCAA playoff bid. Pacific is 23-3,12-1
in the PCAA. They are ranked only behind Brigham
Young.
Shaw said UOP is "one of the hottest teams in the
nation right now" and that the Tigers are markedly
better than they were in September. Stanford has
also raised the level of its game and has lost only two
of its last 12 matches.
While they are the defending national champions
and are ranked second in the nation, the Tigers will
take tonight's match very seriously, according to
Shaw. "They respect us," he said. "They know we're a

team to be reckoned with."
Their respect would not be so great if Nancy Reno
had not escaped the reinjury of her right ankle last
Friday night with only minor effects. Late in the first
game versus Oregon State, the middle blocker
became entangled with both the net and an OSU
player who had gone over the court's center line.
Reno came down badly on her ankle, re-straining liga
ments she had pulled at the beginning of the season.
Reno said the ankle was stiff and slightly painful
the next night versus Oregon and that it slowed her
down, but she said that as long as a similar accident
does not occur again, she does not expect it to
bother her.
As a team, Shaw said the Cardinal have just a few
aches and pains, and that he "would hope that
adrenaline will cure any minor injuries" that might
distract the players tonight.
Something that Shaw hopes will distract the team
tonight is a large, rowdy Maples crowd, such as those
that he said have been a major plus for Stanford in
recent years. "It would be sad to see their fans out
number ours at our home court,"he said, adding that
UOP will reportedly have three busloads of students
at tonight's contest.
The difference between a very successful season
and only a successful season for Stanford this year
will not be crowd size, though. As they showed while
defeating No. 15 OSU last Saturday, the spikers are
susceptible to falling behind in communication and
concentration.
"We have occasional lapses in concentration,"
