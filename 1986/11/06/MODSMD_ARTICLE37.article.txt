Placing only 10th in the Stanford
Women's Intercollegiate golf tourna
ment after having won the tournament
the past two years has not phased Stan
ford's key woman golfer, Kathleen
McCarthy.
Entering last weekend, McCarthy
held the tournament record of 211 for
54 holes, which she set in 1984, her
freshman year. This weekend,
however, she did not score as well.

'There is a lot of
pressure on Kath
leen. Everybody ex
pects her to do well
every time she
plays.'
— Tim Baldwin

Although Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin was not as pleased with the
team's performance, McCarthy felt that
her individual performance was con
sistent. "My mental concentration was
good I'm just coming out of a slump,
and I'm not used to playing well. 1 was
really happy with my concentration,"
McCarthy said.
A senior majoring in psychology,
McCarthy entered Stanford in 1984 as
the nation's No. 1 junior player and
most sought after recruit. When she
visited Stanford on her recruiting trip,
she knew she wanted to play golf here.
"I knew that Stanford was the place for

me," she said.
Her freshman year, McCarthy's
scoring average of 75.0 was the lowest
in the history of Stanford golf. She
went on to place fifth in the NCAA
championships and earned first-team
All-America honors. She made All-
America her sophmore year, too, al
though her season was not as strong.
Last year, McCarthy hit a slump.
"There is a lot of pressure on Kathleen.
Everybody expects her to do well
every time she plays," said Baldwin,
her coach since her freshman year.
McCarthy said she had developed
some bad techniques in her swing. "1
wasn't having fun. But now I've
changed my approach to the swing,"
McGirthy said.
McCarthy has struggled to balance
academics with golf. She's found that
she has had to choose either one or
the other. "Neither one comes easily
for me. I'm a hard worker at both, but
it's hard for me to put both together.
When my golf isn't good, everything
just gets messed up," she said.
This quarter, McCarthy missed two
weeks of classes to play in the World
Cup Amateur Tournament in
Venezuela. "It was like being in the
Olympics of golf," said McCarthy, who
was chosen to represent the United
States because she is one of the na
tion's three top amateurs.
For Baldwin, McCarthy's perfor
mance in this weekend's tournament
confirmed that "she is returning to her
normal self." McCarthy attributes her
improvement to entering the tourna
ment with a good mental picture.
After graduating from Stanford,
McCarthy plans to turn professional.
"When I came to Stanford, I hadn't
looked that far ahead. But after having
such a good first year, I realized that
golf is what I love to do. It will be a fun
career if I'm good at it," McCarthy said.
Baldwin said he feels McCarthy will

be able to handle the pressure of the
professional tour. "She's played in
several professional tournaments —
three U.S. Opens — and at one time or
another, beaten every top pro on
tour," said Baldwin, who ha.s coached
the Stanford women for the past eight
years.
He also sees McCarthy improving
her game in professional play. "She 11
be able to concentrate 100 percent of

her efforts. We'll see her performance
level rise rapidly."
McCarthy has had the chance to play
in tournaments in Mexico, Canada and
all over the United States. In addition
to being chosen first-team All America
two years in a row and playing in the
World Cup Amateur, she was also cho
sen to play in the Curtis Cup as one of

Kathleen McCarthy has been pleased with her mental approach to the game
and remains optimistic about the upcoming season.
the top eight U.S. amateurs.
"Her accomplishments here have
been outstanding, really rare. She's the
best player we've ever had here at
Stanford," Baldwin said.
McCarthy has found playing amateur
golf has been a le;irning experience for
her. "When I hit my slump 1 had to
learn to be humble and take defeat
with a smile, which isn't always easy,"
she said.
McCarthy feels that her close rela
tionship with her parents has really
helped her game. "1 know my parents
love me whether I play well or not.
They are my friends and my two best
supporters," McCarthy said.
Baldwin sees McCarthy's amateur
experience as a learning one, also.
"College has been a great experience
for her. She's the most popular golfer
Stanford's ever had because she's so
well-liked and because of her outgoing
personality," he said.
Currently, McCarthy is ranked as one
of the top five amateurs in die country,
but she hasn't always admitted to her
self that she is a top player. "1 never
dreamed I'd be in this position. I've
worked very hard to get here, but it
still amazes me. I'm just now starting to
realize that I'm a good player," she
said.
Baldwin is optimistic about the rest
of the season, which continues
through the winter and spring. "The
rest of this year we'll be seeing a lot of
really great performances from Kath
leen," he said.
McCarthy is hopeful, too. "If I have
the patience, sooner or later my time
will come," she said.
