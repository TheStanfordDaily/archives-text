# Stanford miscues give Broncos tie
## Men's soccer suffers lapses 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Stanford's soccer match against
Santa Clara yesterday can be filed
under the "we had them" category.
In a match the Cardinal could have
won, the team came away with a 3-3
tie in a seesaw battle that went into
overtime at Maloney Field.
"It kind of eats at you,'' Stanford
Coach Sam Koch said. "We'll get
over it quick though because we
play again so soon."
The Cardinal fell behind late in
the first half when a costly defensive
lapse led to the Broncos' first goal.
Senior fullback Neal Stephens and
senior goalkeeper Tom Austin were
unable to communicate on a Santa
Clara beakaway. The result was a
goal in which Stephens' touch-back
to an oncoming Austin floated over
his head and into the net.
But no lead would last very long
on this day. Less than eight minutes
later and just six before the end of
the first half, the Cardinal con
nected for the tying goal.
Sophomore midfielder Luke Gar
rott set up the goal beautifully with
a throw-in that carried to the far
post. Junior forward Ross Torres
was there waiting to head it in for
his third goal of the season. The
goal gave Torres eight points on the
season and the team lead in
scoring.
Then Stanford did something it
had not done all season. It took the
lead in a game after trailing first.
Midway through the second half,
freshman forward Chris Porch

produced the first of two assists on
the day, a crossing pass that was
eventually hammered in by junior
forward/midfielder Brian Mahaffey
for his first point of the season.
Also picking up an assist on the goal
with a flick-on header was sopho
more midfielder Chris Dechet. De
chet headed Porch's cross to Mahaf
fey, who volleyed it into the upper
left-hand corner of the net.
To its credit, Santa Clara never
quit. The Broncos kept pressuring
Stanford's defense, now anchored
by backup goalie Chris Helling.
Stanford coaches have been playing
Helling so that he can gain some ex
perience to carry into next season.
He also played the second half of
the San Jose State game last
weekend.
With the second half nearing its
close, sophomore fullback Jim Kill
foil, as he had done all game, dis
engaged his man from the ball in
the Stanford penalty area. He
elected to pass the ball within the
penalty area rather than clear it,
however. Helling came off the line
to receive the pass so he could clear
it.
It never got to him The Broncos
gained possession and quickly cen
tered the ball. In the clutter, it
found the open goal, and the 2-1
lead was gone.
"It takes a while to get used to the
commotion in front of you (as a
goalie)," Stanford Asst. Coach
Hunter Stearn said. "A lot more
things happened in this game than
