# Win puts Card into confusing bowl picture
## 
### 
November in America. The leaves have fal
len, the squirrels gather acorns, the frost is on
the pumpkin, and the local college football
team is talking to bowl representatives trying to
learn where it will be spending late December.

But not in Northern California. The sequoias
are still green, the squirrels are dodging
bicycles, frost is only seen on margarita glasses,
and the college football teams haven't visited a
l*)wl game in this decade.
Check that last statement. That ends this year.
Stanford is 6-2, a victory away from the seven
win season that means bowl game, and still has
a game with hapless, Kapp-less, 1-and-whatever
California.
But where is the Cardinal headed? So far,
nine postseason games have expressed an in
terest in the first winning Stanford team in six
years. Bids are issued Nov. 22, the day of the Cal

game, and while no bowl has said outright it
plans to issue one to Stanford, several seem
strongly to want a team from the Pacific 10 Con
ference.
There are currently six Pac-10 teams that
should be playing a 12-game season: Arizona
State, UCLA, Washington, USC, Arizona and
Stanford. The champion will go to the Rose
Bowl, and that is looking more and more like
Arizona State. Assuming they beat Cal this
week, the Sun Devils need only defeat Arizona
in two weeks, or have UCLA lose one of its next
three against Stanford, Washington or USC, in
order to smell the Roses.
This year, there are six games on New Year's
Day. In addition to the major bowls — Rose,
Orange, Sugar and Cotton — the Fiesta and
Florida Citrus Bowls have moved to Jan. 1. The
irony is that one of the latter two will likely
have the national championship game, since
No. 1 Miami (Fla.) and No. 2 Penn State are both
independents with no commitments like
league champions, and neither the Fiesta or
Citrus has a league commitment as well.
With no other top independents, the other
New Year's Day games will have to look to
league runners-up to complete a matchup. The
Pac-10 runner-up should be one of those. Both

the Fiesta and Citrus have expressed interest in
the Pac-10 second-place team, and it is very pos
sible the one that doesn't get the game for No. 1
will offer a bid out this way.
Perhaps speaking of the runner-up is inac
curate, because officials from the Fiesta and
Citrus Bowls have said they would take the
team ranked highest in the wire-service polls,
regardless of final standings. The assumption is
that the rankings and standings would
resemble each other.
For Stanford to finish second, it would have
to finish 9-2, 6-2 in the conference, and hope
Washington and USC both lose one more game
each. The Cardinal's only hope to go to the
Rose Bowl is if that happens and Arizona State
also loses to Cal and Arizona. Don't hold your
breath on that one.
One thing to note here: There is an informal
agreement between the Big Ten, Pac-10 and the
various bowls that the Rose Bowl is the only
one that will match Big Ten and Pac-10 teams,
which precludes some attractive matchups.
Four Big Ten teams — Michigan, Ohio State,
lowa and Michigan State — will likely receive
bids as well.
So, two Pac-10 teams will likely play on New
Year's Day — one in the Rose Bowl, one very

possibly in the Citrus or Fiesta Bowl.
As for the other four, seven other bowls have
looked at having a Pac-10 team. Of those, six —
the Sun, Holiday, Freedom, Liberty, Bluebonnet
and All-American Bowls — have sent or will
send representatives to watch Stanford. The
Aloha Bowl does not scout any teams in person.
Of these, the Sun, Freedom and Aloha seem the
most interested in a Pac-10 team.
Sam Jenkins of the Sun Bowl in El Paso,
Texas, said, "We would very seriously like to
have one of the teams that doesn't go to the
Rose Bowl. We're interested in all of them." He
said that since Arizona played in the game last
year, they would probably be the only team not
interested.
The Sun Bowl generally pits a regional team
from the Southwest or Southeastern Confer
ence against an intersectional foe, like a Pac-10
team. Stanford posted a 24-14 victory over
Louisiana State in the 1977 game. The game, in
its 53rd year, is the oldest independent bowl
game around, and will pay each team around
$700,000.
The Freedom Bowl has had a representative
at the last several Stanford games, and was the
only bowl with a scout here last week. The
game, played in Anaheim, is looking for one

team from either the Pac-10 or Western Athletic
Conference, according to Tom Starr.
Because the game is in the Los Angeles area,
UCLA or USC would be a top choice, though
Starr said it is likely those teams would want to
eo elsewhere. He snid Stanford, \ri/ona and
Washington are the most likely choices. The
game pays the NCAA minimum of $500,000 per
team.
The Aloha Bowl is in Honolulu, which in it
self tends to attract good teams. In its five-year
existence, the game has invited four Pac-10
teams, and Kevin Mulligan said his committee is
looking at all of the top six teams this year, ex
pressing "a strong interest in the Pac-10.' The
game guarantees the minimum $500,000.
Of the other four games, the Liberty Bowl, in
Memphis, Tenn., is probably the most pres
tigious. Bud Dudley said his first priorty is a
regional team from the Southeastern or per
haps Atlantic Coast Conference, then an inter
sectional opponent. He said the Pac-10 and Big
Ten are the two most likely sources. He also
spoke of a personal connection with Stanford
Athletic Director Andy Geiger going back to
Geiger's Ivy League days at Pennsylvania. The
