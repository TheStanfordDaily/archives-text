# ASSU reaches out Senators will attend house meetings
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
Starting this week, ASSU senators
will go to house meetings and evening
meals at student residences in a pro
gram designed to give students a better
understanding of the ASSU Senate and
its actions.
According to ASSU Senators Lena
Slachmuijlder and Leonard Adler,
sponsors of the program, the senators
will introduce themselves, ask for stu
dent responses on current issues and
entertain questions.
House meetings will also be a good
place to register student response on
such long-term issues as "calendar
control," Adler said. The late start of
school this year and the short winter
break have been items ot concern for
students, he said.
According to Slachmuijlder, dinner
meetings will allow in-depth discus
sions not possible at house meetings.
Last year, many candidates for the
senate said in their platforms that stu
dents were alienated from the ASSI
and did not know what was happening
in its meetings, Adler said. The newly
elected senators want to let students
know that they are making progress in
correcting this deficiency, he added.
Both senators said the program was
established to help the ASSI senators
effectively represent the students.
The senate is so ambitious and ener
getic this year that there is a danger it
will get carried away with its own ideas
and not act upon students primary
concerns. Slachmuijlder said. These
meetings will be a final check on the
senate's actions, she added.
The outreach program will hope

fully generate student interest in task
forces sponsored by the ASSU such as
the task force on ethnic studies,
Slachmuijlder said.
According to the plan, senators will
have to visit a certain number of dorms
by the middle of December. The
senators will come to most dorms
once during this period but do not
plan to visit every residence.
A similar plan was attempted two
years ago, but it eventually failed,
Slachmuijlder said. Under the previous
plan, senators were expected to go to
house meetings once a week, which
was too demanding, according to
Slachmuijlder.
Council of Presidents member Carey
White said the prior attempt to visit
house meetings worked very well for
freshmen dorms but generated little
interest in upper-class residences.
Visiting upperclassmen at dinner
would probably be more effective,
White added.
According to Cedro Residential As
sitants Brett Wolff and Liz Atkinson, the
ASSU is fighting an uphill struggle
against its past Most RAs are impor
tant sources of information for dorm
residents but have no idea what the
ASSU does, according to Wolff and At
kinson.
"I didn't know about it (the ASSU
student government) from my fresh
man through junior years. How could I
know about the ASSU as an RA?" Atkin
son asked
Robin Hensley, program coordina
tor for Residential Education, said R\s
are given information from various
groups during orientation, but that it is
a "hit or miss" situation.
