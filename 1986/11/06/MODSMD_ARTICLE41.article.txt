# Research Assoc. claims Tasadays are authentic

### STEVE STREED Staff writer 
Through the turbulence of per
sonalities, politics and the media from
the Philippines this past year, a Stan
ford anthropologist is holding a firm
course on evidence about a gentle
hunter-gatherer tribe, known as the
Tasaday.
Carol Malony, a visiting scholar in
the Department of Anthropology,
visited the Tasaday, a people cele
brated as a remnant of the world's past,
twice in 1972. She was one of three
Americans invited by Panamin, the
protection agency for minority groups
in the Philippines, on the first non-
Filipino visitation to the Tasaday.
The Tasaday, a hunter-gatherer tribe
from the interior of the island of Min
danao, were touted by the press in
1971 and 1972 as one of the world's
last Stone Age peoples. They lived in

caves, had never had any previous con
tact with the outside world and spoke
in a pure primitive dialect, according
to reports at the time.
But Herr Eton, a Swiss journalist
from the Neue Zuricher Zeitung,
brought the Tasaday findings into
question in February, claiming Manuel
Eliazalde, the director of Panamin, had
foisted a hoax on investigators in the
interests of good publicity. In his visit
to the Tasaday after the collapse of the
Marcos regime, Eton said he found the
so-called primitives living in modern
housing, wearing Western clothing and
raising chickens.
Eton claimed Eliazalde had locals
from the Mindanaoan mountains put
on orchid leaves, take-up residence in
caves and speak a language developed
by Panamito to convince foreign
visitors that the Tasaday were real.
Although Eton's claim is currently in

dispute among anthropological circles,
linguistic study shows that only a
legitimate tribe of primitives could
have spoken Tasaday, Malony said.
"The linguistic evidence is the most
important to look at in the question of
whether or not the Tasadays are a
hoax," she said. "You can't expect that
people will have a language that never
changes over the course of several
months, a language that is consistent
within itself and consistent between
members of the tribe, that means the
same tiling every time it is used in the
same way, and say that people learned
or adopted this langauage."
Malony tape-recorded hours of
Tasaday conversations, gathered a vo
cabulary of 800 words and worked
closly with an interpreter from a neigh
boring T'Boli village to learn the lan
guage during her 17 days with the
tribe. Tasaday is almost unique in its
pureness, she said.
