# Flu threatens high risk people

### VIVIAN FU 
Officials at Cowell Student Health Center are urging
"high risk" people with heart, lung or kidney disease to be
vaccinated against a new flu strain that affects people under
the age of 30.
Because this new flu strain, Taivan A Flu, is "just an incon
venience to young healthy people," Cowell is not planning
to conduct any major publicity campaigns to get all students
immunized, according to Jan Lahr, immunization nurse at
Cowell.
But people who fall into the high-risk category, which in
cludes persons of all ages with a weak heart, lungs or kid
neys or anemia, as well as healthy persons over the age of
65, could suffer serious complications from becoming infec
ted.
"High-risk people should definitely be vaccinated," Lahr

said. "Anywhere from 20,000-40,000 high-risk people will
die this year because they haven't been vaccinated, she
added.
The new unexpected flu strain is similar to strains of flu
prevalent in the 1950s and 19605.
"This virus tends to hit people under 30 because they are
more susceptible to it. Older people have developed im
munities from exposure to the flus of the '50s and '605," said
Lahr.
Lahr did, however, say students should take other precau
tions to prevent catching the flu.
"Many students lower their resistance to the flu by not
eating well and not getting enough sleep,"' said Lahr. "The
best way to avoid the flu is to take care of yourself and fol
low basic hygiene."
Any student can be vaccinated free of charge at Cowell on
Tuesdays and Fridays from 1:30 to 4 p.m.
