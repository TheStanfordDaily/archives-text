# No big rock bands will play Farm

### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
No major rock bands are scheduled to play at Stan
ford this year, primarily because there are no appro
priate halls on campus, according to Patrick O'Hara,
director of the student-run Concert Network.
A possible appearance by The Grateful Dead in
Frost Amphitheatre this spring remains highly
tentative.
One factor complicating the network's task is the
fact that most halls on campus have permanent
seating, which reduces floor space for d.mcing. ac
cording to O'Hara
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers played in
Memorial Auditorium last year, there were problems
because there was not enough room for students to
dance. "A lot of energy was created by that band, and
the music is very dancable ... but there were per
manent seats,'" O'Hara said. Dinkelspiel Auditorium
also has permanent seats.
This leaves the outdoor Frost Amphitheatre, an
ideal place for concerts in good weather, but too
risky from mid-October through the end of April, ac
cording to O'Hara
"We would not do a show during those periods
because of the threat of rain,' he said
I'C Berkeley's SUPERB Productions generally does
not book its outdoor Greek Theater during those
months either
"We don't want to take out rain insurance, which
would be quite expensive. And also it's cold at night,'
said Mark Culherison. program adviser for the Con
cert Network
"I view halls with fixed seats as troublesome as far
as selling tickets,' said Matt Burrows, chairman of the
Berkeley group The Stanford Concert Network lost
about J'vOOO last vear when onlv 454 tickets were

sold to the Red Hot Chili Peppers conceit Included
in the loss was an estimated $1,700 in damage to
Memorial Auditorium.
SUPERB Productions has access to Pauley Ball
room, a 1,200-seat hall without fixed seats, along with
several other halls that have fixed seats but are
suitable for dancing, according to Burrows.
The Concert Network has investigated the pos
siblity of holding concerts in Maples Pavilion or Stan
ford Stadium, but plans must be postponed because
of the Athletic Department's concern about damages,
O'Hara said.
Stanford's main drawback to holding large rock
concerts stands, but other obstacles are close behind.
"On a regular basis for big shows, Bill Graham
really has a hold on the music in the Bay Area scene,
O'Hara said, referring to the local music promoter.
But Burrows said that for smaller shows, student
run operations have a more equal chance to book
groups, some of which are high quality and popular
with students.
"It really gets down to who makes the initial call,"
he said
"We had the group X' on Friday, and Bill Graham
had them on Thursday. We had the better date be
cause we approached the band first."
"If it's something like Lionel Richie, you'll prob
ably get out-bidded. But for a smaller act, even some
thing like REM,' it's more a matter of who calls first,"
Burrows said.
O'Hara noted that the two networks have different
financial situations. SI'PERB Productions has a
budget of approximately $60,000 this year. Stanford's
Concert Network has a $30,000 budget this year.
"It's difficult for us to make a move when we don't
have the money and backing," he said
There are different situations at different
sch(X)ls," concluded O'Hara. adding that a comedv

series and jazz concerts will highlight the program
ming of the Conceit Network this year.
Each concert promoter has his own secret to suc
cess.
The key to establishing a good reputation is fulfill
ing the terms in the band's "rider," according to
Larry- Richter, concert director for the Associated Stu
dents' Program Board at UC-Santa Barbara.
The rider is a piece of paper that accompanies the
contract, specifying the band's requirements for a
sound system, lighting and food for the crews and
band
"It gets down to peanut versus plain M&M s, or
Moosehead opposed to Molson beer. It gets
ridiculous and it gets expensive," Richter said.
"But it's part of a contract. If they want Cornish
game hen, and you don't have it, they'll Ix.* mad. And
they'll get the word out . . it spreads like wildfire,"
Richter said.
"The whole rock-and-roll business is really a small
circle nationwide of people Once you screw some
one over, word gets around and you'll have a tough
time in the future," Richter said
O'Hara agreed that fulfilling the rider is crucial to
maintaining good relations with the bands.
"And anything you can do beyond that hospitality
wise is important. Artists remember that," O'Hara
said.
Every requirement on the rider is not of equal im
portance to all promoters.
"Our key to success is staying within the budget
constraints," Burrows said.
"Just because something's on the rider doesn't
mean the band necessarily needs it Those details can
be negotiated with the agent."
But the Berkeley promoters do fulfill their agree
ments, Burrows said.
