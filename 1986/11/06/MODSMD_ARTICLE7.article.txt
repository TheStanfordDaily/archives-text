Election suggests '88 candidates
WASHINGTON — For the herd of 1988 presidential contenders already
edging away from the starting gate, Tuesday's congressional and guber
natorial election results seem to have helped some winners, most notably
New York's Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo. His whopping 65 percent re
election margin broke a 104-year old state record set by Grover Cleveland
in 1882; that will help him command attention — and raise millions of dol
lars in campaign contributions.
The vote may also have helped at least one loser — Republican Sen. Bob
Dole. While re-elected handily in Kansas, Dole lost his job as Senate
majority leader as a result of the Democratic takeover and will now be
relegated to minority status — a fate that should leave Dole freer to roam
the country pursuing support for his presidential candidacy.
More fundamentally, the widespread Democratic victories in the mid
term election signaled the start of a transition period in national politics, a
sort of interregnum between the Reagan Revolution and the post-Reagan
era. Al! the White House hopefuls in both parties must now adjust to this
new reality.
Thus in Alabama, hard-line conservative Republican Sen. Jeremiah Den
ton was ousted by Democratic Rep. Richard Shelby, maybe not hard-line
but certainly conservative, while in Maryland retiring liberal Republican
Sen. Charles Mathias was replaced by staunchly liberal Democratic Rep.
Barbara Mikulski.
Such results served as a reminder for 1988 candidates that voters are of
ten more concerned with concrete — often local — problems and per
sonalities than with abstract ideological doctrines of the right or left.
U.S., Soviets confer in Vienna
VIENNA, Austria — The United States and the Soviet Union traded
charges of human rights violations yesterday and then held extended talks
on how to carry out their Iceland summit pledges for sharp reductions in
nuclear weapons.
Secretary of State George Shultz, speaking at a 35-nation conference
aimed at improving relations between East and West, said "a tragic human
rights situation" existed in the Soviet Union and among its Eastern allies.
He warned that arms control would falter unless the perceived abuses
were corrected.
"Arms control cannot exist as a process in isolation from other sources
of tension in East-West relations," Shultz said in a stern speech.
He addressed foreign ministers reviewing the 1975 Helsinki agreement's
promise of a freer exchange of people and ideas across the East-West
divide.
The United States, the Soviet Union, Canada and all European nations ex
cept Albania signed the Helsinki accords and are attending the conference.
Shultz cited the confinement of Andrei Sakharov, a physicist who won
the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, to the closed city of Gorky, and the imprison
ment of members of a Soviet activist group monitoring the Helsinki ac
cords.
After the speech, in which he offered no new Western initiatives, Shultz
took up the unfinished business of the Iceland superpower summit with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at the U.S. Embassy in
Vienna.
Iran may still help get hostages
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Two Iranian officials said yesterday that Tehran is
willing to work for the release of American and French hostages in
Lebanon in return for weapons, unfreezing of Iranian assets in the United
States and freedom for political prisoners.
A third official, Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, said in a report broadcast
by Tehran radio that there was no possibility of negotiating with the United
States.
But although Musavi seemed to rule out direct talks, his comments did
not appear to contradict declaratioas by the other Iranian officials that a
deal could be made. The difference in emphasis was seen as part of a
growing internal struggle within the Iranian leadership.
Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani ridiculed what he said was a mis
sion to Tehran by former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane and
four other Americaas to try to mend U.S.-Iranian relations. U.S. officials
have not confirmed the mission.
But Rafsanjani signaled that rejection of the purported mission does not
mean Iran won't help.
Israelis meet illegally with PLO
JERUSALEM — A delegation of Israeli leftists flew to Romania yesterday
to meet with Palestine Liberation Organization leaders, defying Israeli law
and angry relatives of terrorist victims who tried to stop them at the airport.
The group, which because of government pressure and internal bicker
ing had diminished from a planned 100 to about 30, is scheduled to meet
today in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, with a delegation of 31 H-O rep
resentatives.
"We are going to make a dialogue for peace," said Latif Dori, head of the
Israeli delegation and a member of the leftist Mapam party, which opposed
the meeting.
The Palestinians at today's talks are to include three members of the 10-
man PLO executive committee.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres have both condemned the meeting as illegal and ill-advised. And At
torney General Harish warned that a police investigation will be under
taken the moment the Israeli group returns. Harish said the Prevention of
Terror Law specifically forbids meetings between Israeli citizens and PLO
officials.
The Israelis planned the trip in part to challenge the controversial law,
which was enacted under extraordinary conditions on the last day of the
parliamentary summer sesson in August.
Inmate escapes from prison
PLKASANTON — A woman inmate made a daring escape yesterday from
a federal prison in a chartered helicopter commandeered by a man
believed to have escaped from the same prison a few days ago.
The helicopter, a five-seat Hughes 500 model believed capable of 150
mph, swooped down on the Federal Correctional Institution between
11:15 a.m. and 11:30 a.m., landed in a recreation yard, picked up the
woman and took off, said Warden Rob Roberts.
FBI agent Ellen Knowlton said the escaped inmate was 37-year-old
Samantha Dorida Lopez, who was serving a 50-year sentence for aiding and
abetting a bank robbery in Florida. Knowlton said the man in the hijacked
helicopter is believed to be escaped federal prisoner Ronald Mcintosh.
Roberts said Mcintosh and Lopez had been friendly in the prison and
had worked together in the prison's business office.
CSU papers case to be settled
LOS ANGELES — A dispute over unauthorized publication of unsigned
political endorsements by at least 11 student newspapers in the California
State University system should be settled within 10 days, an official says.
The settlement probably will involve changing the CSU ban on state
subsidized newspapers taking political stands in unsigned editorials, said
Jeff Stetson, acting director of public affairs for the CSU system.
"The bottom line would certainly be some kind of disclaimer or specific
reference within the editorial that suggests that the views expressed in the
editorial are the views of the editors and not necessarily the views of the
students or the institution, he said.
Student newspapers have defied the ban at at least 11 CSU campuses, in
cluding those in San Diego, the Northridge section of Los Angeles, Long
Beach, Fresno, Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Humboldt, Pomona, San Fran
cisco. San Luis Obispo and Sonoma.
