# Democrats make plans for Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders, ready to
reclaim full control of Congress for the first time
since President Reagan's landslide in 1980, yesterday
hailed their new, 10-seat Senate majority as a death
knell for the "Reagan Revolution" and the beginning
of a new era of realism at the Pentagon.
Both Reagan and the Democrats pledged to seek
compromise in the aftermath of the divisive mid
term election, even though they appeared to be
heading for a series of fractious confrontations on
virtually every issue ranging from Reagan's "Star
Wars" nuclear defense system to his controversial
judicial appointments.
With a 55-45 majority in the Senate, Democrats are
itching to reverse the policies that Reagan initiated
six years ago after he and other Republicans were
swept into office on a conservative tide. The presi
dent had invited such action by framing the election
as a referendum on his arms control and economic
agenda.
"I would hope that the president would read the
message that was sent by the American people,"
declared Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.) "And that message is: 'Look, your economic
policies have not worked in so many instances."
At the White House, however, officials were under
standably unwilling to interpret the election as a
repudiation of Reagan's policies. In a somber post
election staff meeting, the president defiantly vowed

to "complete the revolution that we have so well
begun."
But even before the Democrats' overwhelming vic
tory, the president's policies were challenged fre
quendy by the politically divided 99th Congress. And
now, with the Democrats firmly in charge of both
chambers, there is no doubt that the Congress will
undertake numerous efforts to frustrate the will of
the president.
Not only will the Democrats have a sufficient
majority to pass legislation such as a protectionist
trade bill and a campaign reform act that were previ
ously blocked by the Senate GOP, but the Senate
committee chairmanships also will pass to Demo
crats who can be expected to use the congressional
hearing process to focus public attention on contro
versial aspects of the Reagan regime, including ad
ministration efforts to place more conservatives in
the judiciary.
Among the Democrats who will inherit committee
chairmanships are such well-known liberals as Sens.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), who will head the
Judiciary Committee, and Claiborne Pell (D-R.I ),
who will head Foreign Relations.
Arms control and defense policies are likely to be
the most hard-fought issues between Reagan and the
100 th Congress. The chairmanship of the powerful
Armed Services Committee will pass from retiring
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), to Sen. Sam Nunn (D-
Ga.), who despite his reputation as a cautious

moderate, has recently challenged the president s
bargaining position in arms control talks with the So
viet Union.
Sen. George Mitchell (D-Maine), who heads the
Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, said the
Democrats would continue to fund an SDI research
program, but would refuse to allow the Reagan ad
ministration to violate the existing anti-ballistic
missile treaty with the Soviets, as conservatives
would like.
In foreign policy, the Democratic victory means an
end to the reign of Foreign Relations Chairman Rich
ard Lugar (R-Ind.), who fostered compromise be
tween Reagan and Congress. With Pell at the commit
tee's helm, liberal subcommittee chairmen such as
Sens. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) and John Kerry
(D-Mass ), will have a new platform to attack Reagan's
foreign policy.
Their first target will be aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels, which passed Congress by only a narrow
majority last year. Byrd declared yesterday that under
the Democrats "there won't be any secret war fought
in Central America that is funded by the Central Intel
ligence Agency through the back door, and others
vowed to kill the program entirely.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who will become the
assistant majority leader, told a news conference that
the new Senate will have a 51-49 majority against
contra aid.
