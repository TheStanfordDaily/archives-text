# Reagan: Revolution will go on
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan,
trying to rally grim Republican spirits
in the face of a decisive GOP defeat in
the Senate elections, vowed yesterday
in a pep talk to White House aides "to
complete the revolution that we have
so well begun."
In a speech alternately defiant and
conciliatory, Reagan pledged to push
forward with an agenda of reducing
domestic government spending, main
taining "our military preparedness"
and pursuing new arms-control agree
ments with the Soviets that will allow
deployment of missile-defense sys
tems."
But the president also held out an
olive branch to Democrats who
defeated Republican candidates for
whom he campaigned vigorously in
the weeks before the election. Facing a
Senate now dominated by Democrats,
55 to 45, he congratulated the winners
and said he looked forward to a period

of "hard work and bipartisan coopera
tion" when Congress returns in Janu
ary.
Reagan's speech, designed to cheer
up aides and demonstrate that he has
no intention of becoming a quiescent
"lame duck" during his last two years
in office, contrasted sharply with the
message of his closing campaign
speeches. Speaking for Republican
Senate candidate Ed Zschau at a rally in
Anaheim last Saturday, Reagan said that
"I didn't run for president to be a six
year president" and predicted that
Democratic control of the Senate
would mean "two years of stalemate."
Zschau lost, as did most of the Sen
ate candidates for whom Reagan cam
paigned in an unsuccessful attempt to
nationalize the election and transfer
his popularity to other Republicans.
During the week before the elec
tion, Reagan campaigned for nine GOP
Senate candidates — six of them in

cumbent senators. Eight were
defeated.
Beginning on Oct. 23 on the White
House South Lawn, Reagan used a stan
dard speech that attempted to make
the election a referendum on his
policies.
White House strategists tried to
mitigate the president's lack of effec
tiveness by saying he had boosted the
vote totals for many of the defeated
Senate candidates. White House
spokesman Larry Speakes claimed that
Reagan "had made many of these races
a horse race by his presence."
However, analysts for both parties
said before the election that Republi
can candidates in many of these states
were involved in extremely close races
even before the president campaigned
for them.
Because 22 of the 34 Senate seats
that were decided Tuesday were in Re
publican hands to begin with and be

cause a number of races appeared ex
ceptionally close, White House officials
were not surprised at the loss of Senate
control. What did surprise them, and
what appeared particularly to imperil
the Reagan agenda, was the extent of
the defeat.
A number of the legislative in
itiatives most important to Reagan —
including military aid for the anti-
Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua, or con
tras, and full funding of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, which Reagan
vowed yesterday to continue, were
decided by fewer than 10 votes in the
Senate this year.
While chief of staff Donald Regan
and other White House officials main
tained that the president's agenda will
remain unchanged, they said that the
tactics for accomplishing it will neces
sarily be altered by the Republican loss
of the Senate.
