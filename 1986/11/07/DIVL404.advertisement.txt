There's a new decade coming, sooner than you think. It will be an exciting era,
when on-line international transaction processing is effortless and multi-vendor
compatibility is the norm. And it's developing fastest at Tandem.
With the new technologies comes the new work environment. "Creativity comes
from sharing ideas," we believe, and we promote that philosophy through
worldwide teleconferencing, people-oriented management, and an interactive
approach to product development.
