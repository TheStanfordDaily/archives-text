## LSJUMB 
### 
My love affair with the Stanford Band began before I
even got here.
In September 1983, the Band came to Chicago, my
home, on their way to a Stanford football game at the
University of Illinois.
They arrived just in time to play at a reception for
soon-to-be Stanford freshmen, and, with their antics and
impressive rock music repertoire, quickly won our
hearts.
I went down to the Illinois game that week and
watched the Band again, as they displayed the differ
ences between the Silicon Valley and southern Illinois
with their trademark formation changes — COM CHIPS,
for computer chips, switched to COW CHIPS.
When I got to Stanford, the Band and Dollies were
there to greet me, playing music and dancing throughout
Orientation and at each football game. Through my
freshman roommate, an alto sax player, I met many Band
members, got a tour of their ornate Shak, and learned
about "SMUT," the process by which shows are created.
The Band is a unique mix of undergraduates, graduate
students and alumni who drink a lot, steal road signs, tell
good jokes and put on an entertaining show. Their antics
are usually funny, sometimes incomprehensible, and oc
casionally irreverent. Ask six people from the Stanford
community what they think of the Band and you will
probably get six much different answers, but one fact is
unarguable: The Stanford Band makes all other Pac-10
bands seem as titillating as a conservative bar mitzvah.
The Band's formula may soon undergo a change,

however. Athletic Department Director Andy Geiger s
decision to suspend the Band means not only that Stan
ford students will not see them perform their antics at
UCLA and Berkeley, but possibly that students here will
never see the Stanford Band, as we know it, again.
I have a plea: University administrators should not
seek to radically change the nature of the Band, as many
students fear they will. The Band brings excitement to
the campus with a winning formula. Now that they have
been punished, and they realize once again that they are
at the mercy of the Athletic Department, they will avoid
the lapses of taste seen in this year's shows. In short, self
censorship is in order.
I make the plea because it has been suggested that the
suspension is really an Athletic Department test of stu
dent support for the Band. If the Geiger count of Band
supporters is low, some say, the administration may try
to exile the truly incomparable LSJUMB to the Archives.
Maybe Geiger's intentions have been misinterpreted
and he actually has no desire to banish the Band. If so, he
should announce now that the Band's suspension lasts
two games and no longer and should invite the Band to
attend Stanford's post-season, post-Tokyo bowl game.
Geiger's charges against the Band have merit. The USC
halftime show was truly tasteless, and urinating on the
football field should not be tolerated. Perhaps the two
week suspension was warranted.
So is a move by Geiger to give the Band another
chance. The good-will gesture undoubtedly would be
matched by an upbeat, acceptable Band performance.
