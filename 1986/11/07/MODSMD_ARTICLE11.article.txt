# Prof.: higher taxes likely
## 
### MARK ANDEREGG 
Due to the new tax bill, higher taxes will be one of the
U.S. Congress' priorities by 1989, according to Economics
Prof. Michael Boskin.
While the new tax code, recently signed into law by Presi
dent Reagan, has been promoted as "revenue neutral,"
many economists are skeptical of the bill's ability to main
tain an appropriate federal income. Boskin recently empha
sized the probability of a lower net income for the govern
ment in a report to the Center for Economic Policy Re
search, which he directs.
As a result, the nation's lawmakers will be forced to con
sider raising taxes, he said. President Reagan, however,
should be able to silence any ideas of tax hikes while he
remains in office, Boskin added.
But increases seem inevitable by 1989, as Congress is sure
to be faced with an even higher federal deficit. Excise and
personal taxes were targeted by Boskin as "the most likely
candidates" for new tax rates.
As an institution, Stanford will face "innumerable effects"
of the new tax structure, said Boskin. These will range from
building exemptions being nullified to pension plans being
reformed.
According to Boskin, Stanford's ambitious plans for ex
pansion will apparently slow as a result of the new limit on
the number of exemptions that can be made for building
purposes. This could injure the University's effort to accom
odate all the projects it hopes to build, he said.
Another factor of the law that will hamper Stanford's ef
forts to grow is the treatment of charitable contributions.
"The tax law decreases the reduction in taxes on charitable
gifts, which may threaten Stanford's ability to raise reve
nue," Boskin said.
He said Stanford will also have to face many of the same

prospects that American corporations will. Since the Univer
sity deals with large sums of money, any massive tax over
haul is sure to affect the way in which that money should be,
and is, invested, he said.
Similarly, the indirect effects of the bill on the economy
will affect Stanford as much as most other institutions, not
only in terms of the money Stanford handles, but in terms of
those who can afford to utilize this institution, Boskin said.
Boskin said that in the short run, the new tax law "isn't
very good for the economy," because it discourages busi
ness investment.
But if its basic provisions remain in effect for several
years, if the treatment of capital gains is modified and if the
perceived fairness of the tax system is enhanced, the long
term effect will be a "much better tax law," he said.
One strong stimulus to tax reform was Internal Revenue
Service surveys showing that 25 percent of all taxpayers ad
mined cheating and 80 percent felt others cheated on their
returns. "The perception of fairness was eroding rapidly,'
Boskin said.
While the new law includes a "very large cut'' in personal
taxes, with 80 percent of all families benefiting, this does not
take into account corporate tax increases amounting to
about $120 billion.
Individuals should also see immediate improvement in
their tax situation. However, individual gains will not have a
very great influence on the economy, Boskin said. He added
that, for the most part, business investments, not personal
ones, are what dictate the nature of the American economy.
One especially large concern of Boskin, and many other
economists, is the law's effect on corporations and the tax
exemptions they are able to make. Long-term and short
term capital gains will now both be taxed at 100 percent, for
