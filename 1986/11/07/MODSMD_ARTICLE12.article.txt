According to the recently released Carnegie Founda
tion report on undergraduate education, faculty are
"torn between these competing obligations" of teaching
and research, and are therefore less effective in the class
room.
If the University is taking this report to heart as it has
pledged to do, there are several areas in which it can
make changes to fulfill the report's mandate for higher
quality undergraduate instruction through more efficient
use of faculty resources.
First, teaching ability should be weighed equally with
the quality of an instructor's research in tenure deci
sions. A professor may be on the leading edge of re
search in his field, but without an ability to communicate
this knowledge to students, his expertise is irrelevant in
the classroom. While the University attempts to avoid this
situation by placing a strong emphasis on teaching, re
search is still a more important criterion for tenure.
At the undergraduate level, Stanford must remain a
teaching-oriented institution, but this will only occur if
professors are rewarded equally for their classroom
skills.
The report calls for sabbaticals to be made available at
every institution, but Stanford should carry this recom
mendation one step further. In addition to the sabbati
cals the University provides as opportunities for inten

sive research by professors, Stanford should provide sab
baticals for teaching.
Professors burnt out by the dual demands of instruc
tion and research would be given opportunities to take
"teaching sabbaticals" at the same frequency they have
opportunities for research sabbaticals. They could take a
quarter or more and fully devote time to teaching with
out having to worry about the "publish or perish" pres
sure under which they so often labor.
The faculty's performance could also be improved if
it had better classrooms to teach in. With only 77 sem
inar rooms and 31 lecture-seminar rooms, Stanford is
woefully deficient in facilities devoted solely to teaching
and learning. In addition, many of these existing rooms
have poor lighting, bad ventilation and a lack of such
basic necessities as writing boards.
The University should act on English Prof. Ron Reb
holz's call for a building designed solely for teaching.
This new "super classroom" could have movable walls
which would enable it to be quickly broken down from
lecture areas to small seminar rooms. Not tied to any par
ticular University department, it would instead be
available to any class in need of a place to meet.
Stanford's instructors are a vital resource. Implemen
tation of these recommendations would allow them to
play an even greater role in the intellectual development
of undergraduates.
