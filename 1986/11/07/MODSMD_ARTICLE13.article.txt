Political interest
lacking on Farm
As I made my decision to enroll at
Stanford this May, I had an image of a
student body with a great deal of
political awareness and activity. Not
activism necessarily, but just a group
of knowledgeable, well-informed and
likely opinionated people. Much to
my surprise, upon arrival at the Farm,
I found the very opposite — political
apathy. It was more than students just
not having opinions: They did not
seem to care about what happened
outside the sheltered confines of the
University.
In the majority of talks I have had
with other Stanfordians, I was ap
palled by their lack of knowledge of
even the most basic current events.
Often, attempts to initiate conversa
tions on such subjects were met with
indifference (it seemed most were just
interested in where the party was that
night).
Perhaps I had my hopes too high,
but for a school of such high a
chievers as Stanford surely is, there
should be more diversity of opinion
and political enthusiasm. I place this
in sharp contrast with the obvious
strength of political feeling one feels
in other schools of similar caliber.
Berkeley students, for example,
have elevated South African martyr
Stephen Biko to an almost heroic
stature at their campus. While not
everyone there agrees upon the actual
importance of his role, at least most
students are willing and able to dis
cuss the subject fervently. This con
trasts greatly with the latest such
figure of discussion here at Stanford,
Dr. Ruth Westheimer. If Stanford is
serious about getting rid of its image
of anti-intellectualism, it seems this
would be an ideal place to start.
But more directly, the situation
here is the polar opposite of that in
the 19605. The extreme political
dedication of that decade compares
favorably to the apathy of today.
Granted, the 1960s were a period of
chaos and turbulence, but then at least
the true role of the university was
being fulfilled: People thought for
themselves, made vocal their opinions
and challenged concepts and values of
the establishment by creating a new

set of their own. In today's class
rooms, it appears fewer students are
challenging teachers' opinions and
more are feverishly writing them
down in their notebooks so they will
get their 'A' on the midterm by regur
gitating them. Again there is the key
link of increased political involvement
to increased independent thought;
unfortunately, the lack of activity
inside the classrooms seems to mirror
what is happening outside of them.
Indeed, the saying, "Why rock the
boat if it will cost me?" seems to
summarize the situation.
Clearly, it is not as if there isn't a
plethora of issues to be discussed or
debated in the quickly changing
sphere of politics and current events. I
guess Stanford students don't have the
time (and hence the interest) for
these topics, as they might interfere
with their deep-set career plans.

Many Americans see the system of
government in South Africa as evil.
But setting aside moral concerns,
there exists an important politically
compelling reason for the United
States to shun the system of apartheid.
If one believes that the underlying
distribution of power is the most
important factor in determining politi
cal relationships, then one would see
that the South African government is a
lost cause. The underlying power
capability of the people in South
Africa suffering from racial dis
advantages far outweighs the
underlying power capability of the
group of people in South Africa who
govern and enjoy racial privileges.
This underlying power capability is
found in die sheer numbers of indi
viduals — literally, "power to the
people." The minority government
will surely disintegrate as the latent
power capability of the majority is
slowly realized and used.
From this argument, I would be led
to ask, "Why simply use economic
sanctions to hurt the South African
government? Why not arm the South
African majority and help them to take

over the country by force?" In this
way, the United States can help the
faction in South Africa with the most
underlying power capability to con
trol the government, and thus stabilize
the domestic balance of power.
In conclusion, from a realistic
political standpoint, the United States
would be wise to help the racial
majority in South Africa as much as
possible, to retain South Africa as an'
ally in the long run and thus to enjoy
its militarily strategic importance.

However, should that prohibit us from

No! LET'S BE OUR OWN BAND!
For all who are making that journey

Farm without some sort of sound

vocal chords. If you have a trumpet,
bring it! If you have a trombone, bring
it! Do you have a drum? Bring it! A

Our team needs every effort of sup

in sharp contrast with the obvious
strength of political feeling one feels
in other schools of similar caliber.
Berkeley students, for example,
have elevated South African martyr
Stephen Biko to an almost heroic
stature at their campus. While not
everyone there agrees upon the actual
importance of his role, at least most
students are willing and able to dis
cuss the subject fervently. This con
trasts greatly with the latest such
figure of discussion here at Stanford,
Dr. Ruth Westheimer. If Stanford is
serious about getting rid of its image
of anti-intellectualism, it seems this
would be an ideal place to start.
But more directly, the situation
here is the polar opposite of that in
the 19605. The extreme political
dedication of that decade compares
favorably to the apathy of today.
Granted, the 1960s were a period of
chaos and turbulence, but then at least
the true role of the university was
being fulfilled: People thought for
themselves, made vocal their opinions
and challenged concepts and values of
the establishment by creating a new

set of their own. In today's class
rooms, it appears fewer students are
challenging teachers' opinions and
more are feverishly writing them
down in their notebooks so they will
get their 'A' on the midterm by regur
gitating them. Again there is the key
link of increased political involvement
to increased independent thought;
unfortunately, the lack of activity
inside the classrooms seems to mirror
what is happening outside of them.
Indeed, the saying, "Why rock the
boat if it will cost me?" seems to
summarize the situation.
Clearly, it is not as if there isn't a
plethora of issues to be discussed or
debated in the quickly changing
sphere of politics and current events. I
guess Stanford students don't have the
time (and hence the interest) for
these topics, as they might interfere
with their deep-set career plans.

Many Americans see the system of
government in South Africa as evil.
But setting aside moral concerns,
there exists an important politically
compelling reason for the United
States to shun the system of apartheid.
If one believes that the underlying
distribution of power is the most
important factor in determining politi
cal relationships, then one would see
that the South African government is a
lost cause. The underlying power
capability of the people in South
Africa suffering from racial dis
advantages far outweighs the
underlying power capability of the
group of people in South Africa who
govern and enjoy racial privileges.
This underlying power capability is
found in die sheer numbers of indi
viduals — literally, "power to the
people." The minority government
will surely disintegrate as the latent
power capability of the majority is
slowly realized and used.
From this argument, I would be led
to ask, "Why simply use economic
sanctions to hurt the South African
government? Why not arm the South
African majority and help them to take

over the country by force?" In this
way, the United States can help the
faction in South Africa with the most
underlying power capability to con
trol the government, and thus stabilize
the domestic balance of power.
In conclusion, from a realistic
political standpoint, the United States
would be wise to help the racial
majority in South Africa as much as
possible, to retain South Africa as an'
ally in the long run and thus to enjoy
its militarily strategic importance.

We all hope that the recent cage

remainder of the season and that it
will be able to perform on the syn
thetic turf of Memorial Stadium at
"that other place" reached by crossing
"die other bridge," hut for the time
being, in light of our contest in LA,
we are without LSJLJMB's presence.
However, should that prohibit us from
having a band, from having consonant
melodies, from having euphony, from
having music and from having noise?
No! LET'S BE OUR OWN BAND!
For all who are making that journey
to the South, be it through the air or
via Kettleman City, do not leave the
Farm without some sort of sound
producing device other than your
vocal chords. If you have a trumpet,
bring it! If you have a trombone, bring
it! Do you have a drum? Bring it! A
tambourine? Bring it! A cowbell and
stick? Bring them! A megaphone? Yes!
An airhorn? Sure! Now, everyone has
to have a kazoo. How about a tape
player and tape of LSJUMB music? Yah!
Our team needs every effort of sup
port that we can give them. We need
to squeeze in our thin sliver of seats
in the back corner of the end zone in
Pasadena's Rose Bowl and let the
Cardinal hear our presence. To put it
frankly, "Yell your frickin' butts off!"

Political interest
lacking on Farm
As I made my decision to enroll at
Stanford this May, I had an image of a
student body with a great deal of
political awareness and activity. Not
activism necessarily, but just a group
of knowledgeable, well-informed and
likely opinionated people. Much to
my surprise, upon arrival at the Farm,
I found the very opposite — political
apathy. It was more than students just
not having opinions: They did not
seem to care about what happened
outside the sheltered confines of the
University.
In the majority of talks I have had
with other Stanfordians, I was ap
palled by their lack of knowledge of
even the most basic current events.
Often, attempts to initiate conversa
tions on such subjects were met with
indifference (it seemed most were just
interested in where the party was that
night).
Perhaps I had my hopes too high,
but for a school of such high a
chievers as Stanford surely is, there
should be more diversity of opinion
and political enthusiasm. I place this
in sharp contrast with the obvious
strength of political feeling one feels
in other schools of similar caliber.
