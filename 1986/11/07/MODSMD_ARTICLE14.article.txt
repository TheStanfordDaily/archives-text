# Stopped out in '73, back at the Farm

### 
The last time I appeared in these pages was 1973.1
was a sophomore sociology major with a strong in
terest in social justice and a fascination with the ideas
of one H. Bruce Franklin. If you're a history major
with an interest in '60s politics, a 19th-century sci
ence fiction huff, a Melville scholar or seen a Who's
Who of professors that have been kicked out of major
universities for their political activities, you might

have heard of him He and I had a few feelings in
common back in "3 We were both unhappy with
Stanford University: he with its ties to the military
industrial complex, and I with the general atmos
phere of the place. I didn't belong here and knew it.
So I left after spring quarter. "To change the world
was my answer to anyone who questioned the wis
dom of my decision. I couldn't pass Bernie Cohen's
course in sociology research methods anyway, so
why waste my time? I knew exactly what I wanted to
do, and it had nothing to do with getting into
graduate school or even getting a job. Remember, 1
was 19 years old then and the year was 1973. Nixon
was in the NCTiite House, the Vietnam War was still
tearing the nation apart, no one had yet seen a per
sonal computer, and "Silicon Vallev" was still only a
glint in a few professors' eyes.

But the seed had already been planted. You know,
that mysterious flowering variety that gets carefully
placed in each one of our hearts whosoever passes
through these sacred archways. A part of me never
left Stanford. I know this because it feels so right to
be back here again. The three years of bitter frustra
tion as a shunned writer of poems and short stories,
the three years of losing myself in dope, the four
years struggling to pull myself out of that living hell,
the 11 years of marriage, 10 years of fatherhood and
the eight years with AT&T as a technician couldn't
destroy whatever it is got planted back in 1971.
"An Open Letter To The Asians At Stanford" was
the title of the article that appeared in The Daily back
toward the end of winter quarter in '73- It publicly
challenged the students 1 was living with in the Asian
Theme House to take a closer look at themselves.
Publicly saying what the painful, personal Paul said
every day in the dorm was what I was up to. The let
ter was actually a public confession, in the form of a
short poem included in the article, of my own iden
tity crisis It's remarkable that the humorless young
man who wrote those words Is still alive and well
today. The intervening years have confirmed the fact
that the intensity and intelligence that brought him to
Stanford were on the verge of turning unmercifully
upon him
Today's letter is a celebration of sorts In it I hope
to publicly welcome myself back into the Stanford
community, thank everyone here, past and present,

for being the kind of school that never forgets one of
its own and offer a gift, a token of my appreciation
and an expression of the good feelings I bring back
with me: of course, a poem.
Nobody's Perfect
Nobody's perfect or ever can be.
Some peple die trying though. Like me,
My life, wrapped up in this cocoon of my own
making,
Breathing no one's air but my own, breathing and
rebreathing the same
Stale stuff for seven years.
But nobody's perfect, least of all me. What I
Want to know is how can someone so smart be so
dumb?
What isn't obvious to me is common store for some
one else.
Oops, there I go again, recirculating that same old
stale breath ..
The sueet smell of Spring lures me away from
All of this. Remembrance lingers on as hope.
A lightness overcomes me,
The breeze of new life carries my soul away.
