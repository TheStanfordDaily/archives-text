Is there anybody out there? No, this is not just a line from
one of Pink Floyd's songs, nor am I just wondering who
reads Daily editorials. Further, I should tell you that I sat
down to write this piece initially not really knowing what I
wanted to write. I asked myself, "What significant,
noteworthy news item has bothered me enough to spend
my evening typing on a Macintosh?"
Reagan, Gorbachev and Reykjavik — nah, too much
already on that lately; nobody will care what I think. How
about Nicaragua, the contras and Eugene Hasenfus — better
not, not real sure what is going on down there. Lastly, I con-

sidered Britain, Syria and terrorism, but I decided that I was
pretty content with the U.K.'s reaction to Syria. At die brink
of turning off my Mac, my mind began to wander, and some
how it stumbled on the subject of God. I recalled a long
conversation I had recently had with a small group of at
heists, and I decided that the subject of God is always a
newsworthy topic. By default of having nothing temporal to
discuss, I decided to attempt a brief dissertation on atheism,
monotheism and the existence of God.
Has anyone ever stopped to wonder why the U.S. cur
rency proclaims, "In God we trust"? I never had either until
I posed the question. If our Western civilization is rooted in
the Judeo-Christian ethos — its ideals, morals and ethics,
shouldn't we contemplate, at least once in a while, the
proposition of a Supreme Being? I don't think it's too
presumptuous to suggest that for many Americans, it's not
all that clear there is a God out there. To any of you out
there who may fall into this category, I hope to convey, in
the space remaining, that the prospect of God's existence is
not as far-fetched or implausible as it may sound.
I don't know about the rest of you, but I often still wonder
how the universe was created. Forget for a moment about
the explicits of the Bible, for I do not mean to limit our dis
cussion to any specific religion. To do so would be to limit
the scope and relevance of my thoughts. Even after having
accepted the scientists' theory of the "Big Bang" (a highly
appropriate Freudian conjecture), my curiosity remains un
satisfied as to the true origins of our universe, for one must
then ask, "Who let off the Big Bang?"
Furthermore, when I walk through campus, looking at
the trees, the grass and the sky, I never cease to be amazed
at the beauty, splendor and complexity of it all. I know the
botanist, the biologist, the meteorologist and all the other
"-ists" would have me sit in a library and study applicable
texts. But even after having spent all my life doing that, I
would still feel incomplete without knowing Who en
gineered all that stuff in the first place. Quite contrary to the
reaction of the atheist, I would be even more curious and
overwhelmed after having contemplated all the amazing
components that comprise our world.
But let my thoughts fall, too, on ugliness for a moment. I
would be naive and/or disingenuous to overlook all the evil
that taints the world. Here I attempt not to explain or inter
pret pain and suffering in the world but only to be prudent
in limiting my contemplated awe. Accepting for the moment
the concept of a genesis enacted from an Initially random

and chaotic moment, I am somewhat relieved by the
proposition that contends some disorder still remains in
our perpetually evolving universe. I like to think that God is
the first to grieve when bad things happen to good people.
Not to posit an imperfect God, only to suggest that God is
not better than you or 1 at comprehending irrational chaos.
One cannot expect control over that which is incomprehen
sible by definition.
But the most important of my supports has yet to be put
forth. That is the notion of a soul, a spirit, a consciousness,
whatever might have you. I shudder to think that the most
impressive of the world's components, namely the human
being, is simply an organic, biological machine no better
than my silicon-based computer. Not that it is not that, only
that we are more than that. There is more to flesh and blood
than just flesh and blood. 1 may not be making much sense,
but 1 think I've got something here: Whatever makes me dif
ferent from you is more than DNA. It is DNA, but more im
portantly it is an entity that exists from within, a "within" not
quite fathomable. It is why identical twins are not really
identical. I suspect that is also why true human beauty is
more than "skin deep."
Think,of someone you love. Not just love in the sexual
sense, but love in the eternal sense — love that never dies.
I'll think of someone in my family, perhaps you'll consider a
close friend. While it may be somewhat uncomfortable, im
agine, just for a moment, that person no longer alive. Con
sider the lifeless body of that person. Is the body that per
son? The body is only the complex machine that enabled
that person to take physical form in this world. I don't
suppose the scientists really know what happened to the
person, nor do I suppose they can explain what that person
really was. A life force — an energy perhaps. But can they
really explain it in the same terms used to explain all other
components of the world.?
What I'm proposing is something more powerful than any
"Big Bang." The "Big Bang" is a neat theory, but not, I think,
nearly as special as that which makes us human. Has anyone
yet answered the question "Who let off the "Big Bang?" Who
designed that special part of each of us that is more than
chemical stuff? I hope these questions matter, for if they
don't, then why are we here? Perhaps it is just the atheist
who responds, "There is no purpose for life. I really don't
matter. The whole thing is just a random occurence." I like
to think there is a Reason. My liking to think that is not just
an intellectual crutch either. Quite the opposite, it is the
thoughtful individual who, after trying to answer all the im
portant questions, can admit that temporal, empirical
answers aren't very helpful.
Perhaps before the atheist absolutely concludes there is
no God, he would be better off explaining to me the
answers to my questions. When I spoke with the group of at
heists a short time ago, they told me my questions didn't
matter. They said they couldn't explain the answers to me
because the questions themselves were meaningless. Do
you think they're meaningless? Perhaps the atheists' in
validation of my question is the true intellectual crutch. Not
having to think about such matters makes life pretty easy.
But who said life was supposed to be easy? Is there anybody
out there? Can you prove there isn't?

"Big Bang." The "Big Bang" is a neat theory, but not, I think,
nearly as special as that which makes us human. Has anyone
yet answered the question "Who let off the "Big Bang?" Who
designed that special part of each of us that is more than
chemical stuff? I hope these questions matter, for if they
don't, then why are we here? Perhaps it is just the atheist
who responds, "There is no purpose for life. I really don't
matter. The whole thing is just a random occurence." I like
to think there is a Reason. My liking to think that is not just
an intellectual crutch either. Quite the opposite, it is the
thoughtful individual who, after trying to answer all the im
portant questions, can admit that temporal, empirical
answers aren't very helpful.
Perhaps before the atheist absolutely concludes there is
no God, he would be better off explaining to me the
answers to my questions. When I spoke with the group of at
heists a short time ago, they told me my questions didn't
matter. They said they couldn't explain the answers to me
because the questions themselves were meaningless. Do
you think they're meaningless? Perhaps the atheists' in
validation of my question is the true intellectual crutch. Not
having to think about such matters makes life pretty easy.
But who said life was supposed to be easy? Is there anybody
out there? Can you prove there isn't?

Is there anybody out there? No, this is not just a line from
one of Pink Floyd's songs, nor am I just wondering who
reads Daily editorials. Further, I should tell you that I sat
down to write this piece initially not really knowing what I
wanted to write. I asked myself, "What significant,
noteworthy news item has bothered me enough to spend
my evening typing on a Macintosh?"
Reagan, Gorbachev and Reykjavik — nah, too much
already on that lately; nobody will care what I think. How
about Nicaragua, the contras and Eugene Hasenfus — better
not, not real sure what is going on down there. Lastly, I con-

sidered Britain, Syria and terrorism, but I decided that I was
pretty content with the U.K.'s reaction to Syria. At die brink
of turning off my Mac, my mind began to wander, and some
how it stumbled on the subject of God. I recalled a long
conversation I had recently had with a small group of at
heists, and I decided that the subject of God is always a
newsworthy topic. By default of having nothing temporal to
discuss, I decided to attempt a brief dissertation on atheism,
monotheism and the existence of God.
Has anyone ever stopped to wonder why the U.S. cur
rency proclaims, "In God we trust"? I never had either until
I posed the question. If our Western civilization is rooted in
the Judeo-Christian ethos — its ideals, morals and ethics,
shouldn't we contemplate, at least once in a while, the
proposition of a Supreme Being? I don't think it's too
presumptuous to suggest that for many Americans, it's not
all that clear there is a God out there. To any of you out
there who may fall into this category, I hope to convey, in
the space remaining, that the prospect of God's existence is
not as far-fetched or implausible as it may sound.
I don't know about the rest of you, but I often still wonder
how the universe was created. Forget for a moment about
the explicits of the Bible, for I do not mean to limit our dis
cussion to any specific religion. To do so would be to limit
the scope and relevance of my thoughts. Even after having
accepted the scientists' theory of the "Big Bang" (a highly
appropriate Freudian conjecture), my curiosity remains un
satisfied as to the true origins of our universe, for one must
then ask, "Who let off the Big Bang?"
Furthermore, when I walk through campus, looking at
the trees, the grass and the sky, I never cease to be amazed
at the beauty, splendor and complexity of it all. I know the
botanist, the biologist, the meteorologist and all the other
"-ists" would have me sit in a library and study applicable
texts. But even after having spent all my life doing that, I
would still feel incomplete without knowing Who en
gineered all that stuff in the first place. Quite contrary to the
reaction of the atheist, I would be even more curious and
overwhelmed after having contemplated all the amazing
components that comprise our world.
But let my thoughts fall, too, on ugliness for a moment. I
would be naive and/or disingenuous to overlook all the evil
that taints the world. Here I attempt not to explain or inter
pret pain and suffering in the world but only to be prudent
in limiting my contemplated awe. Accepting for the moment
the concept of a genesis enacted from an Initially random

and chaotic moment, I am somewhat relieved by the
proposition that contends some disorder still remains in
our perpetually evolving universe. I like to think that God is
the first to grieve when bad things happen to good people.
Not to posit an imperfect God, only to suggest that God is
not better than you or 1 at comprehending irrational chaos.
One cannot expect control over that which is incomprehen
sible by definition.
But the most important of my supports has yet to be put
forth. That is the notion of a soul, a spirit, a consciousness,
whatever might have you. I shudder to think that the most
impressive of the world's components, namely the human
being, is simply an organic, biological machine no better
than my silicon-based computer. Not that it is not that, only
that we are more than that. There is more to flesh and blood
than just flesh and blood. 1 may not be making much sense,
but 1 think I've got something here: Whatever makes me dif
ferent from you is more than DNA. It is DNA, but more im
portantly it is an entity that exists from within, a "within" not
quite fathomable. It is why identical twins are not really
identical. I suspect that is also why true human beauty is
more than "skin deep."
Think,of someone you love. Not just love in the sexual
sense, but love in the eternal sense — love that never dies.
I'll think of someone in my family, perhaps you'll consider a
close friend. While it may be somewhat uncomfortable, im
agine, just for a moment, that person no longer alive. Con
sider the lifeless body of that person. Is the body that per
son? The body is only the complex machine that enabled
that person to take physical form in this world. I don't
suppose the scientists really know what happened to the
person, nor do I suppose they can explain what that person
really was. A life force — an energy perhaps. But can they
really explain it in the same terms used to explain all other
components of the world.?
