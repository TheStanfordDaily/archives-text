# Security board is pondered
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
In a sparsely attended community
discussion of the proposed campus se
curity panel last night at El Centro, stu
dents recommended that the panel
have a much more active role in inves
tigating student complaints.
According to the original draft of the
proposal under discussion, the hoard
could make policy recommendations
to the University president, hut it could
not investigate or accept individual
complaints.
The new proposal would enable the
board to register complaints for re
search purposes and to establish sub
committees for investigating extraordi
nary individual complaints, Council of
Presidents (COP) member Carey White
said during the meeting. These new
suggestions are contrary to the Univer
sity's current position on the board,
however, and University President
Donald Kennedy may delete them
from the final charter, White added.
"The board should be able to deter
mine whether it should investigate
complaints," said Mike Schmitz, a
member of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) and the only member of
the community who attended the
meeting. Such board autonomy is ne
cessary to force the University to act on
important issues and to counter the
University's ability to "slide issues un
der the rug," he said.
According to Schmitz, the board
should be able to bring undergraduate
concerns to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Kennedy. The board
should act as an active imformation
gatherer, he said.
Calls for the formation of the board
began after a series of sit-ins held in
Old Union in October 1985. In one of
the sit-ins, then-senior Robbie Perkins
was allegedly abused by Stanford
police officers. Perkins has a $600,000
lawsuit pending against the University.
Citing the large-scale demonstra
tions by black students after the
Perkins incident, COP member Rudy
Fuentes said the president would
never have authorized the Kaplan
Report — prepared by Law Prof. John
Kaplan and commisioned by Kennedy to investigate charges
of police misconduct during the sit-ins — if a representative
of a less populous minority group had been arrested.
During the meeting Fuentes, White and Schmitz agreed
that the name "Campus Security Panel," the title of the pro
posed board, misrepresented the role of the board and sug
gested a name change.
The new proposal for a title is the "Police-Community Re
lations Board, said White. The old name makes the board
"sound like a bicycle committee" and it doesn't reflect its
fundamental role as a link between the police and the com
munity, White said
According to White, it is important to have the board
already in place when any incidents like the Perkins case do
arise.
All the people I've talked to are psyched about the con
cept of the police advisory board," White said.
One role of the board would be to provide information
about the campus police to the University community.
"Most people don t know the role of the [x>lice on campus,"
he said. Stanford has a very unusual security system, accord
ing to White. While most colleges have a private security
force, the county police work in a symbiotic relationship
with the University in policing the campus, he said.
While the board must work within California statutes
governing police procedure in making recommendations,
this will not significantly constrain the type of advice that the
board can give, White said.
