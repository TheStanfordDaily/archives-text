# Security board is pondered

### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
In a sparsely attended community
discussion of the proposed campus se
curity panel last night at El Centro, stu
dents recommended that the panel
have a much more active role in inves
tigating student complaints.
According to the original draft of the
proposal under discussion, the hoard
could make policy recommendations
to the University president, hut it could
not investigate or accept individual
complaints.
The new proposal would enable the
board to register complaints for re
search purposes and to establish sub
committees for investigating extraordi
nary individual complaints, Council of
Presidents (COP) member Carey White
said during the meeting. These new
suggestions are contrary to the Univer
sity's current position on the board,
however, and University President
Donald Kennedy may delete them
from the final charter, White added.
"The board should be able to deter
mine whether it should investigate
complaints," said Mike Schmitz, a
member of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) and the only member of
the community who attended the
meeting. Such board autonomy is ne
cessary to force the University to act on
important issues and to counter the
University's ability to "slide issues un
der the rug," he said.
According to Schmitz, the board
should be able to bring undergraduate
concerns to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Kennedy. The board
should act as an active imformation
gatherer, he said.
Calls for the formation of the board
began after a series of sit-ins held in
Old Union in October 1985. In one of
the sit-ins, then-senior Robbie Perkins
was allegedly abused by Stanford
police officers. Perkins has a $600,000
lawsuit pending against the University.
Citing the large-scale demonstra
tions by black students after the
Perkins incident, COP member Rudy
Fuentes said the president would
never have authorized the Kaplan
Report â€” prepared by Law Prof. John
