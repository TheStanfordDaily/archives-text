## Provost prepares to take reins from Kennedy 
### SEAN KINCH 
When Unversity President Donald
Kennedy goes on sabbatical next quar
ter, he will be replaced by a man who
shares his vision for Stanford â€” a man
who is determined not only to main
tain the University's prominence
among American colleges, but also to
continually expand the school's role as
an innovator and leader in higher edu
cation.
That man is Vice President and
Provost James Rosse, and he is keenly
aware of the importance of Stanford's
position among the nation's educa
tional institutions.
"Stanford is very self-conscious of its
leadership," he said. "If we take a
wrong turn, someone could pass us by,
or, as leaders, we could misdirect
others."
Rosse began his college education at
Princeton University in 1949, but

withdrew before finishing his degree
in order to get married and establish a
family. He later returned to school at
the University of Minnesota, where he
graduated first in the School of Busi
ness with a degree in economics. He
continued at Minnesota, receiving a
master's in economics (with a minor in
statistics) in 1964, and a doctorate in
economics (with a minor in mathema
tics) in 1966. His doctoral dissertation
was honored by the American Eco
nomics Association.
In 1965, while still finishing the
work for his doctorate, Rosse began
teaching at Stanford. He was named an
associate professor in 1971, and a full
professor in 1976. He taught, and
researched, applied microeconomic
theory and its application in industrial
organization and regulated industries.
The material in the courses he taught is
currently covered in Economics 51 and
158, and Rosse still serves as guest lec

turer for many classes.
Rosse has been involved in adminis
tration since his first days on campus.
He worked his way through the admin
istration of the Department of Eco
nomics, becoming its vice chairman in
1971.
His interests then turned campus
wide. He became an associate dean of
Humanities, a post he held until 1982,
when he became the director of the
Center for Economic Policy Research.
He was appointed provost in 1984.
Rosse has also served on many ad
ministrative and curriculum commit
tees.
As provost (essentially the second
in-command in the University's admin
istration), Rosse's duties range widely
and require a close relationship with
the president. Referred to as "the dean
of deans." rhe provost is responsible

for all teaching and research programs,
as well as for overseeing the budget.
Rosse noted that the tasks of the
president and the provost often over
lap, and that ultimately the duties are
divided based on the personal
dynamics of the two people involved.
He feels that he and Kennedy have
reached a comfortable balance in their
working relationship.
"We have an inside/outside relation
ship, where the president deals more
with external relations while the
provost works more internally, with
the faculty and deans," Rosse said.
Since he does work so closely with
the president, the transition to
president-for-one-quarter should not
be difficult for Rosse. He has been
keeping track of Kennedy's schedule
so that there will be no surprises when
he takes over his duties.

Rosse knows already that many of
the tasks that will face him will concern
the University's Centennial Celebra
tion, which began last November and
will culminate in 1991. He has been in
volved in much of the planning for the
scheduled events, and he must now
complete those plans and begin to
implement them.
Rosse is determined to maintain
Stanford's strength, and he realizes the
necessity of long-range planning.
"Stanford doesn't look like it has a care
in the world because we (the adminis
trators) all think of how to keep it
headed in the right direction," he said,
"but it could go sour."
Rather than going sour, though, it's
more likely that Stanford will continue
to sweeten during James Rosse's stay at
the top.
