University Provost James
Rosse will ascend to the
presidency this December, but
his three-month tenure as acting
president during University
President Donald Kennedy's
sabbatical will be the shortest of
any president in school history.
Not by much, however. Four
Stanford presidents have held
the office for three years or less.
The University's second head,
John Casper Branner, took office
in May 1913, only to relinquish
the office in January 1916 to Ray
Lyman Wilbur.
Kenneth Pitzer became presi
dent in Sepember 1968 and
weathered two tumultuous years
in die midst of the Vietnam War
before giving up the office to
Richard Lyman in September
1970.
When President Donald
Tresidder died in his sleep on
Jan. 28, 1948, after a five-year
stint in office, Vice President Al
vin Eurich was named acting
president. He held the post for
just less than a year, until Jan. 1,
1949.
But the newly named presi
dent of the University, J.E.
Wallace Sterling, could not
vacate his spot as director of the
Huntington Library and Gallery
until June 1, 1949.
Clarence H. Faust, dean of the
faculty of Humanities and
Sciences, was appointed interim
president for the six months be
tween Eurich's departure and
Sterling's arrival.
