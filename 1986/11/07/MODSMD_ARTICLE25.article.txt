# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM
## Seeing green 
### 
If Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy sometimes feels beleaguered by
the student forces for divestment rap
tapping peskily on his windowsill, per
haps he should thank his lucky stars
that at least he still has a job.
That's more than can be said for
Dartmouth College President David
McLaughlin. McLaughlin announced
his resignation last month amid
speculation that his exit from an
already stormy tenure had been even
further hastened by his handling of
various apartheid-related events at the
college last year.
For his part, however, McLaughlin
insists that he was not pressured into
resigning and that his resignation }iad
nothing to do with the controversy sur
rounding the anti-apartheid demon
stration and related events.
He says, rather, that the next 10 years
will be important ones for Dartmouth
and that he is "not prepared to commit
irrevocably 10 more years to the task."
As for the anti-apartheid contro
versy, McLaughlin says,"I think that the
events of last winter were obviously
difficult for the entire college as well as
the presidency.... Dartmouth went
through a troublesome episode and
has come through that I think that
that was important to see happen."
The troublesome episode began last
January when a pro-divestment group

built several shanties on the college
green in the center of campus. Al
though the action flew in the face of
college orders, the shanties were
allowed to stand.
And stand they did until a group of
conservative students, most of them as
sociated with the right-wing, off
campus weekly, The Dartmouth
Review, smashed the shanties with
sledgehammers.
The students responsible for the
destruction of the shanties initially
were kicked out of school, but
McLaughlin susequently called for new
hearings and the punishment was
reduced. Eventually , one of the
leaders of the shanty smashers was for
bidden to graduate with his class.
Meanwhile, the apartheid protesters,
who originally had built the shanties,
who took over the president's office to
protest the destruction of the shanties
and some of whom were arrested
when the school decided to officially
remove the structures, went un
punished.
All of this raised the hackles of con
servative students and alumni alike.
Former Treasury Secretary William
Simon, among other alumni, came out
in support of the conservative group
and attacked McLaughlin, saying "He
has made nobody happy because of his
cowardice."
In February some students and fac
ulty members called for McLaughlin's

resignation, accusing him of ignoring
faculty votes in determining the col
lege's divestment policy.
Dartmouth has refused to pull all in
vestments in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa, asserting that
selective divestment and the use of
stockholdings to pressure companies
are more effective methods of ending
apartheid.
His assailants are quite sure that
McLaughlin's resignation is directly
related to the shanty controversy.
Deborah Stone, editor in chief of
The Dartmouth Review and one of the
sledgehammer-wielders, says that
McLaughlin is "completely mis
representing" his reasons for leaving.
"Sure, there may be some personal
reasons," Stone says, "but to say that
the events of the past year had nothing
to do with it strikes me as absurd."
Making music, not money
Stanford isn't the only school losing
its shirt on concerts by pop music
groups.
In fact, the $5,000 to which the Stan
ford Concert Network bid farewell ,
after last year's Red Hot Chili Peppers
concert looks like nothing next to
some of the losses suffered by other
universities.
Last October the University of In
diana Union Board (equivalent to the
ASSU) lost $45,000 on a Supertramp

concert at the school's Assembly Hall.
"It was a fantastic concert," said con
certs director Adele Rafson. "It just
wasn't really geared toward students.
And so we've got a much stronger mar
keting research program now."
Meanwhile, the folks at Ball State
University lost approximately $10,000
on a Pat Metheny concert last year, and
took it on the chin for another $6,000
with a Manhattan Transfer show last
month.
Both Indiana and Ball State have
been forced to curtail their concert
plans and work closely with indepen
dent promoters in scheduling future
programs.
And the current difficulties cause
some at Indiana to yearn for the hap
pier days of old, like the 1975-76
school year, when The Rolling Stones,
The Who, Elvis Presley and Chicago all
played to huge crowds on campus.
Tail wagging the dog
While tenure controversies perc
olate at Stanford, similar issues are get
, ting attention at the University of Penn
sylvania.
According to its Handbook for Fac
ulty and Academic Administrators,
promotion to tenure status requires "a
high degree of excellence ... in both
research and teaching. The relative
weight given to research and teaching

varies from case to case ... but always
with significant achievements in re
search as a prime consideration."
Some weight is also given to
"citizenship" activities in the form of
service to the university.
Clearly, though, research is the pri
mary criterion. Hear Deputy Provost
Richard Clelland:
"Teaching is the second most impor
tant criterion. Since universities are the
places where a main mission is to ad
vance knowledge, (research and teach
ing) cannot keep an equal balance. Ex
cellent teachers cannot compensate for
inadequate research."
And here's English Prof. Robert
Lucid:
"I think a somewhat more realistic
way to look at it is that there are two
kinds of teaching," Lucid said. "One is
local, in the classroom, and the other is

non-local teaching — research and
publication made available to people
who aren't here. There are two teach
ing audiences, and we can't neglect
either."
Finally, here's one University of
Pennsylvania faculty member's assess
ment of the university personnel com
mittee that reviews and gives final ap
proval to all tenure decisions:
"The committee is only looking at
research — where do teaching and
service come in?"
Clean up your mess
This just in from the University of
Texas: Jerry DeCamp, UT physical plant
director, says that each year the univer
sity spends about $294,000 cleaning up
student and faculty messes — littering,
vandalism and "general carelessness."
