# KKGs reach out to elderly
## 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Staff writer 
The Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority at Stanford
has started a long-term relationship with some very
respectable older men and women.
These older men and women are some of the
residents of Lytton Gardens, a convalescent home
in Palo Alto. Their relationship with the Kappas
began last spring.
It started innocently enough. Kappa president
Maria Hart contacted the Lytton Gardens because
of an ad she saw in The Daily concerning the
Adopt-a-Grandparent program.
In an interview with Lynette Bensuhsun, the ac
tivities director for Lytton Gardens, Hart proposed
the idea for a group project, and the Kappa Happy
Hours began at the Gardens.
The Happy Hour was a weekly event in which
the Kappas brought juice, wine and snacks.
"The best part about the Happy Hours was that
the girls spent a lot of time — usually one-on-one
— with the patients, just talking," Bensuhsun said.
Then Kappa Kappa Gamma National Chapter
found out about it.
"They (the Kappa National Board) didn't like the
Kappa name being associated with a happy hour,"

Hart said. "It sounded too much like a bunch of un
derage girls serving alcohol to elderly people."
To appease the national chapter, the name was
changed from the Kappa Happy Hour to the Kappa
Social Hour.
"Other than that, the program is just the same; it
just sounds more innocent," explained Hart.
The relationship between the Kappas and Lytton
Gardens residents has continued to develop.
This year, in planning sessions before the begin
ning of the quarter, Hart and Bensuhsun decided
to do something new in addition to the Social
Hours.
That's where Walk 'n' Roll comes in.
The Social Hours are no longer weekly events.
Now, every other week, they are replaced by Walk
'n' Roll, an excursion with some of the more
healthy patients and the Kappas. On these jaunts
through town, the elderly people are given a
chance to get out of their rooms — something that
doesn't happen often.
"The small trips, whether out to a patio, through
a park or just down the street, allow the patients a
small time where they don't feel cooped-up or im
prisoned. It helps them feel human again," Ben
suhsun said.

The trips are good for the Kappas, too.
"The folks at the home really adore our com
pany," said Hart. "It makes us feel needed.
Working with them helps us, too. It shows us a
whole new world full of truly needy people."
The mutual benefits derived from the program
have both the Kappas and Lytton Gardens inter
ested in continuing and developing even stronger
ties. Toward that end, Walk 'n' Roll was expanded
on Election Day Tuesday.
On that day, the jaunts to the park were ex
changed for a stroll to the polls.
About 20 of the Kappas, dressed in patriotic
colors, went to the Gardens and escorted 18 of the
residents to the voting booth, two blocks away.
Along the way, the girls carried signs, tied balloons
to the wheelchairs of some of the patients and
trailed streamers along behind them.
The event aroused a lot of interest on the part of
observers, enough interest to stop traffic at one
point.
After the trip, everyone involved agreed that it
was worthwhile.
"I didn't expect the turnout to be as good as it
was," said one Kappa member. "Everyone is really
excited about the way it worked out."
