New Order — "Brotherhood"
TRSA TASR RSAT RA
Life's tough when you're a teen. Not
only do you have to endure acne,
school and creepy boy/girlfriends who
never call you so you have to call up
his/her best friend to ask why your
boy/girl friend is such a total jerk and
then end up talking for hours and fall
ing in iove with him/her and then have
to sneak around your boy/girlfriend's
back for a couple days before he/she
finally discovers the awful truth and
you have to tell him/her that it's like
over, but you also have to deal with
parents and other old people who
don't understand that New Order is
just so totally cool and deep! Well,
don't worry. At least we understand
about New Order.
New Order is a band with a doom
gloom past. Once it was known
(ironically, natch) as Joy Division and
made a lot of really depressing songs
about the futility of life, love and
country. Most fans from those days will
insist that the band remains loyal to
that tradition. But let's face it, shall we?
These days, New Order is just a synth
pop band with more talent than
Animotion, more creativity than
Thompson Twins and more depress
ing lyrics than Howard Jones. But is
that so bad?
On "Brotherhood," the band picks
up where it left off on its previous
release, "Low-life," and the intervening
single, "Shell-shock" (this is a band

that digs hyphens). That means the
best in trendy new wave dance pop.
You know, the whole bit: mindless
dancin' to cool synth licks, pretending
to sing along even though most of the
words are incomprehensible, deriving
meaning from goofy sound effects
(like the recorded sound of a needle
scratching obscenely across the vinyl at
the end of side two), getting a weird
hair cut, and cutting down television
and Huey Lewis. It's an attitude. It's a
way of life.
We're not making fun of the guys or
their fans. Really. Far from it. After all,
you can always count on them to come
up with a couple terrific new wave
standards on every release, and this
record is no exception. That doesn't
mean that it's Art or anything, though.
But if you want to make points with
your superhip roommate, tell him or
her that you're going out to pick up
"Brotherhood." And then add that your
parents are retrofascist automaton
stooges. He or she'll be soooo im
pressed.

The Pretenders — "Get Close"
CKHE ECKH KECH HE
Funny thing, this album. Sure, it's
got Chrissie Hynde, no doubt about it,
but the concept of The Pretenders has
come to mean just her. All the group's
old members, except Hynde, are gone,
even founding member and drummer
Martin Chambers (except on one
song). And even Malcom Foster, the
bass player who replaced the original
bassist, has been replaced.
What we get then, after all the

changes, is an album that is distinctly
Chrissie Hynde, with little sense of the
punk-tinged rock n' roll sound of the
entity we once knew as "The
Pretenders." Nothing is particularly
distinctive in the group's new sound,
and that hurts. It's a bit funky, a touch
Motown and a smidgen enjoyable, but
Chrissie, where's that angry, biting
edge to your sound that was on your
first two albums and even on "Learning
to Crawl?" I went back to The
Pretenders and my music was gone.
OK, so it ain't the same as old. That

doesn't mean it's so bad. We still have
that voice that chills your kneecaps,
and she wrote all but two songs here, a
cover of Jimi Hendrix's "Room Full of
Mirrors" and "Hymn to Her" by Meg
Keene. Several of Hynde's new tunes
are driving and memorable, like
"Dance!" and "How Much Did You Get
For Your Soul?" "Don't Get Me Wrong"
and "My Baby" are ringing and
melodic, compared to some of the
lighter songs on the previous album.
In a sense, however, this is a disap
pointment, because we can see what a

whoppingly incredible album this
could have been with the previous,
tougher-sounding musicians. The
Hendrix cover comes closest to carry
ing a strong sense of power. Small
wonder, then, that Chambers is on
drums and Foster on bass for that song.
"Get Closer" is an album that will
get plenty of airplay but it's no pace
setter. Especially not with Chrissie
Hynde trying to be Ann Wilson of
Heart on "Light of the Moon," a song
that, well, just plain sucks.

The Police — "Every Breath You
Take: The Singles"
RADN DANR ARDN
It's time for Zoo Picks' newest
feature, "You Make the Call!" You're a
cigar smoking, high-falutin' executive
at A&M Records. You're in charge of
putting together a "best of' collection
for the Police. You already know
you're gonna make lots of money be
cause:
1) The band's blend of punk, reggae,
funk, adult contemporary pop and just
plain old rock is enjoyed by everyone
to the left of Jerry Falwell.
2) Their prolific eight-year career in
cludes lots of platinum (including
Sting's solo record).
3) Their soulful re-recording of
"Don't Stand So Close to Me" is cur
rently rocketing up the charts and is
slated to be released on the collection
as a teaser to nab old fans who want
everything the guys ever did.
In the steam room one day, one of
your most trusted colleagues suggests
that A&M should release a two-record

set containing not only the band's big
chart hits, but their best songs as well.
Therefore, record buyers will be more
than happy to shell out a couple of ex
tra bucks for a double album and may
even go out and buy the earlier
releases, too.
You nod, thinking this sounds like a
great idea. A few minutes later,
however, a toadying crony approaches
you and says that he thinks the best
strategy is to release only the 12
chartbusting-est Police songs, on only
one record. This will appeal to
economy-minded parents and tape
happy teens, in addition to providing
conservative radio programmers with
a single slice of wax to include in their
ever-shrinking playlists. You grin ner
vously, agreeing that his proposal
merits thought. Upon your return to
the office, the president of A&M
Records comes up to you. He says he
needs a decision right now on the for
mat of the Police collection. You know
that either option will bring in truck
loads of money. You know that if you
choose the single album chartbusting
option, many great, albeit non-Top-10,
songs will be left off, and that record
critics worldwide will skin you alive
for your creative wimpiness.
What did you decide? Sure, you out
there reading this have good taste. You
go with the double album to prove to
the world that there is life after Hot
Hits. Too bad you aren't an A&M
Records executive. Too bad for the
children of the future, who will pick up
this greatest hits package and never
discover all those great, non-Top-10
Police classics.
