# Jazz film hits some highs
## But 'Round Midnight' still has slow moments 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial Staff 
I m a big fan of jazz and I'm also a big fan of
movies, so naturally any effective combination of the
two would really make my day. "Round Midnight" al
most made my day. It fuses elements of what con
stitutes good jazz and good movies, and the result is a
good — but not great — film.
"Round Midnight" is a film — based in part on the
experiences of Francis Paudras and Bud Powell —
. about the black American jazz musicians who went to
Paris in the late '50s for creative freedom. It focuses
on the friendship between Dale Turner (Dexter Gor
don), an old, burned-out, black sax player who has
nothing left to live for except his music, and Francis
< Borier (Francois Cluzet), a young, white, French
graphic artist who reveres and is awed by Turner's
music.
, The film begins in 1959 with Turner leaving New
York to play at the Blue Note in Paris. Turner, al
though a be-bop legend, is an exhausted, broken
; down hulk of a man who walks as if every move is
causing him pain and who speaks slowly, as if every
( word is going to be his last. His only reasons for
going on are to pierce the boundaries of jazz and to
find his next bottle of booze.
Francis, a struggling commercial illustrator, deeply
appreciates Turner's music and worships it as a
• valuable source of inspiration. He loves the music so
. much that, too poor to pay his way into clubs, he sits

outside in the pouring rain to hear Turner play.
When Francis first meets his idol, he's shocked to see
so great an artist on the brink of physical destruction.
He then undertakes the task of managing Turner's
life by searching for him at all hours of the night
when Turner goes on drunken sprees, and eventu
ally gets Turner to swear off booze and start con
centrating more on his music.

Hardcore jazz fanatics
should love this film.

"Round Midnight" is, for the most part, a love story
that shows not only the affection and respect the two
men have for each other, but also the love and pas
sion they share for the music.
The bad news about the movie is that it is painfully
slow at the beginning and it takes a long time for
things to get rolling. Although it picks up a little
around the middle, it still maintains the slow, sad
tempo of one of Turner's sax performances. This is
definitely not a movie for "Rambo" fans.
Another big weakness of the film is the way the re
lationship between Turner and Francis begins. The
scene where they first meet is awkwardly directed
and is a weak foundation for the strong friendship
that is supposed to develop.
The big reason why I couldn't buy the premise of

their relationship is Francois Cluzet's rather inef
fective performance. Although Cluzet (who looks a
lot like a young Dustin Hoffman) is perfectly capable
of saying his lines and coming up with anger and
tears when called for, there is not enough fire behind
his words to add tension to his relationship with
Turner. As a result, the scenes that feature Francis
alone either fall flat or are extremely bland.
The strength of the film rests on Dexter Gordon's
wonderful performance. His Dale Turner is a lum
bering physical wreck who delivers every word in a
tired, raspy Godfather-like voice but who also has a
sense of humor and who is absolutely compelling
when he sits down to play the sax. Dexter Gordon is
like Dr. Haing Ngor of "The Killing Fields": Although
not trained as an actor, he has the advantage of
having lived through his role, and this brings a
quality to the screen that no professional actor could
emulate. The result is an engrossing performance
that is soulfully charged with depth and power.
Hardcore jazz fanatics should love this film for the
way it integrates the music into the story and for the
way we get to see the musicians discuss the music
and rehearse. Regular jazz fans like myself will like
the film for the music and for Gordon's performance,
but will not be too impressed by the rest qf-the story.
People who aren't jazz fans may find a new apprecia
tion for the music but won't find any appreciation for
the film's snail-like pace. Finally, people who don't
like jazz (those poor benighted souls) should avoid
this movie at all costs.

causing him pain and who speaks slowly, as if every
( word is going to be his last. His only reasons for
going on are to pierce the boundaries of jazz and to
find his next bottle of booze.
Francis, a struggling commercial illustrator, deeply
appreciates Turner's music and worships it as a
• valuable source of inspiration. He loves the music so
. much that, too poor to pay his way into clubs, he sits

outside in the pouring rain to hear Turner play.
When Francis first meets his idol, he's shocked to see
so great an artist on the brink of physical destruction.
He then undertakes the task of managing Turner's
life by searching for him at all hours of the night
when Turner goes on drunken sprees, and eventu
ally gets Turner to swear off booze and start con
centrating more on his music.

Hardcore jazz fanatics
should love this film.

"Round Midnight" is, for the most part, a love story
that shows not only the affection and respect the two
men have for each other, but also the love and pas
sion they share for the music.
The bad news about the movie is that it is painfully
slow at the beginning and it takes a long time for
things to get rolling. Although it picks up a little
around the middle, it still maintains the slow, sad
tempo of one of Turner's sax performances. This is
definitely not a movie for "Rambo" fans.
Another big weakness of the film is the way the re
lationship between Turner and Francis begins. The
scene where they first meet is awkwardly directed
and is a weak foundation for the strong friendship
that is supposed to develop.
The big reason why I couldn't buy the premise of

their relationship is Francois Cluzet's rather inef
fective performance. Although Cluzet (who looks a
lot like a young Dustin Hoffman) is perfectly capable
of saying his lines and coming up with anger and
tears when called for, there is not enough fire behind
his words to add tension to his relationship with
Turner. As a result, the scenes that feature Francis
alone either fall flat or are extremely bland.
The strength of the film rests on Dexter Gordon's
wonderful performance. His Dale Turner is a lum
bering physical wreck who delivers every word in a
tired, raspy Godfather-like voice but who also has a
sense of humor and who is absolutely compelling
when he sits down to play the sax. Dexter Gordon is
like Dr. Haing Ngor of "The Killing Fields": Although
not trained as an actor, he has the advantage of
having lived through his role, and this brings a
quality to the screen that no professional actor could
emulate. The result is an engrossing performance
that is soulfully charged with depth and power.
Hardcore jazz fanatics should love this film for the
way it integrates the music into the story and for the
way we get to see the musicians discuss the music
and rehearse. Regular jazz fans like myself will like
the film for the music and for Gordon's performance,
but will not be too impressed by the rest qf-the story.
People who aren't jazz fans may find a new apprecia
tion for the music but won't find any appreciation for
the film's snail-like pace. Finally, people who don't
like jazz (those poor benighted souls) should avoid
this movie at all costs.

All that jazz: Dexter Gordon plays Dale Turner, a black saxophonist strug
gling for success in 1950s Paris, in "Round Midnight."
