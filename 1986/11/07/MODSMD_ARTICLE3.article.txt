### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
"I believe active non-violence can resolve every major
conflict in the world today," Coretta Scott King, widow of
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., told a
standing-room-only crowd at Kresge Auditorium yesterday
afternoon.
"We've proven the success of non-violence," King said,
citing the successful struggle for India's independence in
the 1940s and the American civil rights movement in the
1960s as situations in which active non-violence precipitated
great social change.
She noted that the recent non-violent overthrow of
former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos, "if it
remains in that (non-violent) spirit," could prove to be an
other such case. "The 'People Power' movement (in the
Philippines) has aroused the hopes of freedom-loving
peoples all over the world," King said.
King also spoke on the current situation in South Africa,
saying that, more than ever, "non-violence is relevant to
apartheid."
Voicing strong support for economic sanctions against
South Africa, King said, "We have a moral obligation not to
profit from brutal ... dictatorships. Our credibility as a
freedom-loving people is at stake."
While King acknowledged that many people question the
effectiveness of sanctions, she said that if they are closely

monitored and strialy enforced, sanctions can "force the
government (of South Africa) to enact reform
King quoted from a speech her husband made at a benefit
for the American Committee on .Africa in 1965 in which he
called for a world-wide boycott of South Africa, a tactic that
he described as "a potent non-violent path towards reform.
King also suggested that American universities and col
leges become involved in the struggle against apartheid In
addition to divesting from companies that do business in
South Africa, American universities should also create more
opportunities for black South Africans to study here in the
United States, she said.
This is because "as the new order comes into being (in
South Africa), and it will come into being . we (will) need
a group of leaders who can contribute" to the restructuring
and revitalization of the country. King said
King, who is president of The Martin Luther King J i Ceil
rer tor Nonviolent Social Ch;uige, Inc., stressed the impor
tance of educating the public about non violence "(We
must) teach and expose people to the philosophy of non
violence and ... begin to solve these problems which seem
so monolithic in scope," she said
While King acknowledged the difficult} ol such a t.isk. -.he
said, "We believe in impossible dreams, and we dedicate
ourselves to the fulfillment of those dreams
"I struggle every day to keep the message of Martin l.ut
her King Jr. alive," she said.
Commenting on the declaration of her husband's
birthday as a national holiday, King cautioned against using
the day to "rest on our laurels." She said the day must be
observed in a substantive way, suggesting that the holiday
be "a day of non-violent action .. to fight bigotry, racism,
unemployment and poverty."
King's visit to Stanford came in connection with the Mar
tin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, which is headed by His
tory Prof. Clay Carson. The project, expected to take several
years, will involve scholarly examination and editing of the
papers of Martin Luther King Jr. The papers will eventually
be published in a 12-volume edition.
This project, said King, "is very, very important and I think
significant to the history of our country , not just the history
of the civil rights movement. And I might even go so far as to
sav (it is important) in the history of the world.
