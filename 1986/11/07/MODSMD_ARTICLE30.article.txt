### 
Vertigo (1958)
Parkside, San Francisco
Alfred Hitchcock's film has an eerie,
seductive romanticism; the combination
of a richly suggestive narrative, Kim
Novak's otherworldly beaut)' in the first
half of the film, the heady Bernard Herr
mann music and the hypnotic
camerawork in the most famous se
quences is extremely powerful, on a pop
level. Despite what its many devotees have
said of it, the movie doesn't really address
the topics of necrophilia and death wish
(it's more Freudly than Freudian), but you
watch it with the same fascination and im
patience with which you might read a sexy
murder mystery that keeps you awake half
the night. With James Stewart, who has
one fine scene, as the ex-cop who falls in
love with the haunted woman he was
hired to follow (Novak) and Barbara Bel
Geddes (who gives the best perfor
mance). Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor
adapted the screenplay from a novel
called "D'entre les Morts" by Pierre
Boileau and Thomas Narcejac; Robert
Burks shot it, in Technicolor, in and
around San Francisco; Saul Bass designed
the credits and John Ferren the dream se
quence.
Plays tonight with "The Man Who Knew
Too Much" and"The Birds."

Birdy (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alan Parker's movie, which Sandy
Kroopf and Jack Behr culled from William
Wharton's novel, is good in spite of itself.
Parker focuses on the intimate friendship
of two high school kids — Al Columbato
(Nicholas Cage), an athletic, charismatic
boy, and a strange, intense outsider Al
nicknames "Birdy" (Matthew Modine) be
cause of his passionate interest in birds.
The story, told in a series of flashbacks,
takes the boys to Vietnam, which leaves
both of them shattered, Al physically,
Birdy psychologically. The screenplay is a
bubbling brew of 1950s Freudianizing and
'60s depressive rhapsodizing about the
fate of the square peg in the round hole
and the impossibility of true lyric flight in
modern American society. The material
sounds terrible (and it is), but something
almost miraculous happens in director
Alan Parker's treatment of it that redeems
all the political, psychological and meta
phorical weight loaded on its back. He and
his two leading actors do such a superb
job with the Al-Birdy scenes that the
friendship becomes the essential theme of
the movie rather than just a useful meta
phor for all those other themes. Shot by
Michael Seresin and directed by Parker in
a "Shoot the Moon" mood (they col
laborated on that, too), with attention to
delicate modulations of rhythm and quick
silver tonal shifts.
Plays Sunday afternoon only in a benefit
matinee for Miramonte Mental Health
Services, with writer Sandy Kroopf in per
son.

Buckaroo Banzai (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Buckaroo Banzai" is a poorly
structured, hard-to-understand mess; it's
also an incredibly funny movie. Director
W.D. Richter and writer Earl Mac Rauch
have put together both a parody of, and

loving tribute to, the American pulp sen
sibility, their movie combines elements of
comic books, pulp action novels, schlock) 1
science fiction movies and deadpan '80s
humor. With Peter Weller as Buckaroo,
the brain surgeon/rock star/crime fighting
superhero; John Lithgow as Dr. Emilio
Lizardo, the mad scientist to end all mad
scientists; Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin and
Christopher Lloyd.
Plays tonight with "Repo Man"; late
show of "Rocky Horror Picture Show,"
separate admission.
— Mike Hale
Pink Floyd: The Wall (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The subjects are education, war, love
less sex, anomie and mob psychology, but
this film — a sight and sound orgy for
junior high school mushroom heads —
contains not a single original thought on
any of them. Alan Parker, who directed,
presents an endless parade of rehashed,
fifth-rate '60s imagery while that thick,
derivative music screams at us in Dolby
stereo.
Plays tomorrow.
Broadway Danny Rose (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As Danny Rose, the fourth-rate theatrical
manager who changes his opinions in
mid-sentence to curry favor with those
around him, Woody Allen talks frantically,
peppering his speech with worn show biz
endearments and thrusting his hands for
ward like berserk marionettes for empha
sis. Except for Allen's acting, the best thing
about his movie is the framing device: The
story is told as a series of anecdotes by a
group of comedians gathered in a restau
rant (and the men who exchange them are
legitimate stand-up comics). The main
focus of the narrative is Danny's involve
ment with his most promising client's
girlfriend (Mia Farrow, in a blond wig,
curtain ring earrings, smoked sunglasses
and a strident, brassy Bronx accent), but
their scenes together lack the offbeat
down-played chemistry they had in
"Zelig." It's a very odd, evanescent film; it
becomes emotionally scrambled, and at
the end we're left with less than we started
with.
Plays Sunday with "Stardust Memories."
— S.v.
The Seventh Seal (1956)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
With this medieval puzzle drama, In
gmar Bergman rose to heights that none
of his subsequent "dark" movies, except
for "Shame" a dozen years later, has ever
equalled. The knight's chess game with
Death is surely one of the key images in
world cinema, and the sequence involving
the burning of the young witch suggests
that Bergman may have been inspired by
Dreyer's "Day of Wrath." With Max von
Sydow as the knight, Bengt Ekerot as
Death, Maud Hansson as the witch, Bibi
Andersson, Gunnar Bjornstrand and Nils
Poppe.
Plays Tuesday with "Persona."
— S.V.
Lost Horizon (1937)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
James Hilton's enormously popular
Utopian novel was filmed by Frank Capra,
from a screenplay by Robert Riskin. The

movie's notion of an ideal existence
(Shangri-La) is fairly excruciating: The in
habitants of a Tibetan mountain commu
nity, assured of longevity, dodder about in
smiling lethargy while their leader, the
High Lama (Sam Jaffe), intones lethal
platitudes. But the film has passages of
suspense and fantasy that cling to the
memory for decades; Capra was nothing if
not a master craftsman. Unhappily, it also
has long soporific stretches, and it isn't
very well acted. Ronald Colman, speaking
in that unearthly cultivated voice, stars as
the questing outsider, Robert Conway, and
the crew stranded alongside him includes
a consumptive (Isabel Jewell), a go-getter
(Thomas Mitchell), a fussy paleontologist
(Edward Everett Horton), and Conway's
malcontent brother (John Howard).
Among the residents of Shangri-La are
H.B. Warner, Margo (with her faraway
eyes), and Jane Wyatt, smiling her cloying
little smiles. (She didn't change much be
tween this movie and her "Father Knows
Best" days.) Shot by the amazing Joseph
Walker.
Plays Sunday with "The Bitter Tea of
General Yen" (directed by Capra, starring
Barbara Stanwyck).

The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)
Parkside, San Francisco
With the aid of screenwriters John Mi
chael Hayes and Angus MacPhail, com
poser Bernard Herrmann and photogra
pher Robert Burks, Alfred Hitchcock ex
panded and improved his 1934 thriller.
James Stewart and Doris Day play Ameri
can tourists traveling in Morocco who
become involved in international intrigue.
The good supporting cast includes Ber
nard Miles, Brenda da Banzie and Daniel
Gelin. This is one of Doris Day's few good
pieces of screen acting; she, Stewart and
Hitchcock deserve equal credit for the un
usual scene in which Stewart tells her
their son has been kidnaped. A gripping
(and much underrated) picture.
Plays tonight with "Vertigo" and"The
Birds."

The Birds (1963)
Parkside, San Francisco
Alfred Hitchcock made this movie out a
novel by Daphne Du Maurier; it was his
first picture after "Psycho," and it may be
the first apocalyptic horror tale to be
made in Hollywood. In Bodega Bay, birds
gather by the thousands and terrify the in
habitants. There are some very creepy
shots of birds hovering on telephone
wires and rooftops, and an effectively
edited sequence in which Tippi Hedren is
assaulted by the creatures in an attic, but
the movie is otherwise sloppy and rather
violent, and it contains bits that are hard
for audiences to accept — for instance, the
moment when Hedren emerges from that
attic, sporting merely a few scratches. Rod
Taylor and Suzanne Pleshette co-star; the
one memorable appearance is by Ethel
GrifFies as an ornithologist.
Plays tonight with "The Man Who Knew
Too Much" and "Vertigo."
— S.V.
After Hours (1985)
Roxie, San Francisco
Martin Scorcese's efforts to get back to a
simpler style of moviemaking resulted in

this small, entertaining comedy, written by
film student Joseph Minion. It's a relief to
see real people in a Scorcese film again,
and with this movie he's once again
grounding his movie effects for his audi
ence, after a string of alienating,
"personal" films. "After Hours' starts oft
whizzing, and quickly hooks up Paul
(Griffin Dunne, as a staid computer
programer) and Marci (Rosanna Arquette,
as a flighty Soho denizen); he's invited to
her place and inadvertently becomes in
volved with various Soho crazies and their
night-life. The story is a fevered dream
about his attempts to get home, and it has
a built-in limitation: As Paul becomes
more single-minded in his attempts to
escape, plot development stops and the
movie becomes single-minded in its ef
forts to keep him on the run. With Linda
Fiorentino, Teri Garr and John Heard, as
three of the most engaging and enjoyable
nutsos.
Plays tonight with "Desperately Seeking
Susan."
— Steve Warrick
Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1977)
Red Vic, San Francisco
Werner Herzog's austere epic about the
fate of a Spanish expedition in Peru is very
tough going, because he has absolutely no
sense of pacing — before you first glance
at your watch, you don't know whether
you've lx?en watching for 20 minutes or
90. And Herzog pays grueling attention to
gruesome details (a few of which are actu
ally funny, in a Teutonic sort of way). He's
an amazing image-maker, though, and the
film — unlike "Fitzcarraldo," which came
five years later — is worth the endurance
test. As Aguirre, Klaus Kinski is malevolent
in a surreal way, like Cherkassov in "Ivan
the Terrible."
Plays tonight and tomorrow.
The Return of Martin Guerre (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean de Coras, one of the justices in the
case, originally set down this resonant tale
of the man who left his home in mid 16th
century France to fight in the wars,
returned to general rejoicing eight years
later, and then was accused of being an
impersonator. Daniel Vigne's film version,
with a script by Vigne and Jean Claude
Carriere, concentrates on making the man
claiming to be Martin Guerre as attractive
as possible, and by casting Gerard Depar
dieu, the most appealing (and most sen
suous and instinctual) of French actors, in
the title role, Vigne has ensured that the
narrative mechanism will indeed work.
It's a very ordinary movie, though. With
Nathalie Baye as Martin's wife, Bertninde.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with "The
Mystery of Alexina."
