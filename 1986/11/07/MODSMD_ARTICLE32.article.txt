## Cardinal to meet UCLA at Rose Bowl Bruins second in Pac-10 with 4-1 league record 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The last time Stanford visited the Rose Bowl to
meet UCIA, there wasn't much hope for the Card
inal and White. Quarterback John Pave was out
with a broken finger on his throwing hand. Full
back Brian Morris was also out of action. And the
Bruins were shooting for their third straight con
ference championship.
Enter one second-year fullback named Brad
Muster, who had stood on the sidelines for the
first 15 games of his collegiate career. Listed as
third-string on the depth charts, Muster made it
known he was not scrub material, carrying 24
times for 82 yards and a touchdown as the Card
inal hung on for a 23-21 upset win.
Since then, Muster has gone on to establish
himself as one of the top backs in the Pacific 10
Conference, carrying an officially adjusted 37
times last week for 190 yards, the most carries
and seventh-most yards for any Stanford rusher
ever. And Stanford has this year established itself
as one of the top teams in the Pac-10, with a 6-2
record, 3-2 in the conference.
There is a problem â€” UCLA is also a top team.
And though Stanford is guaranteed of its first win
ning season in six years and closing in on its first
bowl bid in eight years, the Cardinal has yet to
defeat a top-20 team. The Bruins are ranked No.
12 by the Associated Press. Stanford just missed
being ranked by AP, though United Press Interna
tional has the Cardinal tied for No. 19 this week.
"It's obvious our team is suspect against the
better teams in die conference," wide receiver
Jeff James said after the Cardinal lost 10-0 to USC
two weeks ago. Last week's 42-12 win over a 3-4-1
Washington State team didn't change that.
"For the post-season, UCLA is a big game,"
linebacker David Wyman said. "They're one of

four tough teams on our schedule. We know we
can play with good teams."
Tomorrow's game will start at 11:40 a.m. to ac
comodate CBS television, which will carry the
game to 3B percent of the country in the Midwest
and Far West.
The Bruins were the pre season choice among
Pac-10 coaches to win the conference and are cur
rently in second place with a 4-1 record, 6-2 over
all. Their hopes for a second straight champion
ship are slim after losing 16-9 to Arizona State in
their Pac-10 opener. UCLA needs to win its last
three games and hope for a Sun Devil loss to
repeat.
Whether the Bruins would be competitive at all
was in doubt following a 38-3 thrashing at the
hands of then-No. 1 Oklahoma in the first week of
the season, a game in which quarterback Matt
Stevens threw five interceptions. Since then, the
Bruins have won six of their last seven, but close
their season with Stanford, Washington and lISC.
Stevens has recovered from his nightmare in
Norman to complete 54 percent of his passes for
164 yards per game with only two interceptions
in his last seven games. "1 think Matt's become
progressively better as he's gotten more experi
ence," Bruin Coach Terry Donahue said. "The
more a player plays, the more confident he
becomes.''
Tailback Gaston Green is the stalwart of the
UCLA running game, having rushed for 673 yards
in eight games, with seven touchdowns.
"When they throw the football," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said, "it's not percentage passes.
It's the big play. They're going to run the football,
they have great speed. They throw the football
not out of necessity, but as a change. What we
want to do is have them throw the ball out of


Despite pressure from Cougars such as defensive end Marvin
Adams (87), Stanford quarterback John Paye was able to complete
17 of 25 passes for 214 yards and one touchdown last Saturday.
The senior also carried the ball eight times for 36 yards and rushed

for two touchdowns. Against Washington State, Paye did not
throw an interception, but he will have to be cautious again to
morrow as UCLA collected eight interceptions versus Oregon
State last weekend.
