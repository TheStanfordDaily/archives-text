# Water polo seeks 40th straight win

### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
At the start of the season, the
goals of the Stanford men's water
polo team were simple.
"These guys have won the NCAAs
before," Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti said. "The great teams win
back-to-back championships. The
motivation for these guys is to win
the NCAAs and go undefeated in the
process."
After 30 games, the No. 1 Card
inal is 30-0 (3-0 in Pacific 10 Confer
ence play), has held the top na
tional ranking for the entire year
and is in the stretch drive for the na
tional crown and an unbeaten
season.
"We only have six games left to
go undefeated," Dettamantti said,
referring to the three remaining
regular season games and three
NCAA contests.
Today and tomorrow, Stanford
will visit Pac 10 rivals No. 5 USC and
third-rated UCIA in an attempt to
clinch at least a tie for the Pac-10
title and keep its unbeaten streak
alive.
The Trojan game begins at 3 p.m.
with the UCIA contest scheduled
for a 9 a.m. start.
With a victory over USC, the
Cardinal will break the NCAA
record of consecutive wins (39) set
by Stanford (1980-1982).
Stanford is spearheaded by All-
America candidate Erich Fischer.
The junior from Reedley scored 46
goals in his first two years on the
Farm, but has exploded to score 74
goals already this season. With

three regular season games remain
ing, he will in all likelihood break
the single season Cardinal scoring
record of 82 goals, set by James Ber
geson in 1981.
In addition, senior Craig Klass,
with 70 goals, has a chance to break
the record. Senior David Imber
nino follows with 48 goals, with
sophomore Jeff Oeding chipping in
40.
In the 15-7 Trojans, Stanford will
face an opponent it has mastered
twice already this season. On Sept.
19, the Cardinal defeated USC 13-7
in the UC-Irvine Tournament and
on Oct. 25 Stanford was a 9-4 win
ner at DeGuerre Pool.
Although the Cardinal was not
extended in either previous game,
USC has the ability to test Stanford.
Sophomore Robert Lynn, a U.S.
Junior National Team member, pro
vides the Trojans with an excellent
scoring threat and goalie Kevin
Stringer has given Stanford prob
lems in the past.
"USC has a lot of talent," Fischer
said. "They have the potential to
give us a lot of problems."
In addition, with all of the nation's
top-five teams from California and
only five California schools receiv
ing NCAA invitations, USC can
clinch a bid with a win over the
Cardinal.
"They have nothing to lose," Im
bernino said. "Since they are
playing the No. 1 team they will
come out playing hard."
The greatest challenge to the
Cardinal's unbeaten streak, how
