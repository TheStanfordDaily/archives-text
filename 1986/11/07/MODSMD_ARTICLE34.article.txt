# No. 2 UOP beats Card in a thriller
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Two hours of breathtaking, thrill-a-second volleyball last
night resulted in two winners and — as all athletic events,
no matter how well-played, must regrettably have — one
loser.
The winners were the University of Pacific and an occa
sionally obnoxious, always loud, Maples Pavilion crowd of
fans from both schools, many of whom are probably nur
sing a case of laryngitis right now. That leaves Stanford as
the loser, although its play, especially in the first two games,
makes "loser" a label that does not quite fit.
Nationally ranked 10th, Stanford (14-8,10-1 in the Pac-10)
won those first two games 15-10, 15-9. After a 10-minute in
termission, the No. 2 Tigers (24-3, 12-1 in the PCAA) came
back 15-10, 15-3 and 15-9.
"Stanford played extremely well in the first two," UOP
Coach John Dunning said. "They played great, they weren't
making any mistakes. We just played tougher in the last
three games than they did."
Tiger setter Liz Hert pointed to blocking as the key. "At
first, our blocking wasn't there, and they played really well.
Theresa Smith was hitting right through us," she said.
"During the intermission, we just talked about concentrat
ing on our blocking. Once we got that going we shut them
down."
For the Cardinal, the evening's bad word was familiar.
"Our concentration gradually left us," sophomore Laura
Olesen said.
Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves had a more tangible
explanation for the team's letdown. "Our offense was really
dependent on the type of pass we made," he said. "Even in
the second game, when we passed back on four or five
points, and the sets were coming from behind the front row,
they won the points. It was an indication that we might get
into trouble later."
While they certainly don't reflect the wild, heart-stopping
action that never gave either the teams or the fans a chance

cate the contest's stars and its drastic
change in momentum.
