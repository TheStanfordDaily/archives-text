On Oct. 6,1985, the Stanford field hockey team was strug
gling with a 1-3-1 overall record and a 0-1-1 mark in the
Northern Pacific Conference. The Cardinal then rolled to
nine consecutive wins and the NorPac title before losing to
lowa in the first game of the NCAA Midwest Regional.
On Oct. 2, 1986, Stanford was again struggling. An un
inspiring 3-1 loss to San Jose State the previous day had
dropped its overall record to 2-4-1 and its NorPac mark to 0-
1-1. Once again, however, the Cardinal has reeled off nine
straight victories and is now on the verge of its second con
secutive NorPac crown.
A win in today's regular season finale against last-place
Chico State will clinch the title for Stanford. The Cardinal is
currently 5-1-1 in the NorPac, one point ahead of the Univer
sity of the Pacific (5-2-0), which Stanford defeated 1-0 on
Wednesday to take the conference lead. The Wildcats are 1-
4-2 in league play. Game time is 3 p.m. at Stanford.
A nine-game winning streak, an NCAA berth on the line
and playing the last-place team in the conference at home
would all seem to indicate an easy Stanford victory So will

the Cardinal have trouble getting revved up for this appar

"No, because we have trouble with them (the Wildcats)
every year," Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
Stanford did have trouble with Chico State in a NorPac
contest earlier this year. The Cardinal needed a goal from
Maree Chung in the final five minutes to pull out a 1-0 vic
tory in Chico. Stanford had an easier time with the Wildcats
on Oct. 17 in the California Invitational, winning 2-0.
"I don't think we're going to take them for granted,"
goalkeeper Karen Jones said. "They beat us last year (2-1 on
Oct. 5), and they were where they are this year (in the stand
ings)."
According to Johnson, the Wildcats are difficult to play be
cause of their hustle and unpredictability. "They're a
scrappy team," she said. "They just keep coming at you You
never know what to expect.
One thing the Cardinal has come to expect is solid play
from Jones. The sophomore goalkeeper has a goals-against
average of .875 and has recorded nine shutouts on the
season. The easiest of those nine came on Wednesday, as
Jones faced only seven shots against L'OP
Meanwhile, the Stanford offense fired 35 shots at UOP
goalkeeper Shari Megginson. Megginson kept the Cardinal
scoreless until less than five minutes remained, but Ami
Chitwood finally broke through at 65.23
