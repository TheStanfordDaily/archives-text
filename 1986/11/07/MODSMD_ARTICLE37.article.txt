# Women's swimming has intersquad meet
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
A lone spectator, braving a brisk November
late-afternoon at DeGuerre Fool, witnessed
something no Stanford women's swimming fan
saw last year.
He watched as the Cardinal, which went 8-0 last
year, lost a dual meet.
Not to fret, however, because the losing squad
was not actually the Cardinal but instead the Red
team, which fell to the White, 55-49, in the Stan
ford intrasquad meet.
That solitary fan may have seen the last defeat
the Cardinal will suffer this year, though, as Stan
ford Coach George Haines thinks he has a team
with the potential to win the NCAA title that so
nearly eluded it in a third-place finish last March.
"We've got a lot of talent on this team," Haines
said. "We're going to have a great team before the
year is over. We're better than last year. We've
closed down the gap on (last year's NCAA cham
pion) Texas. I think potentially we have the
chance to win, but we just can't talk about it,
we've got to do it."
An outstanding corps of freshmen has been
added to a veteran squad that includes Olympians
Jenna Johnson and Susan Rapp, and these
talented newcomers could push Stanford to the
top.
Michelle Griglione, coming off a second-place
finish in the 400-meter individual medley at this
summer's World Championships, served notice
that she will be a force to be reckoned with by
winning the 200 freestyle by more than two
seconds and the 200 IM by nearly seven.
Haines is impressed by more than his freshman
sensation's talent, though.

"Griglione is one of the hardest workers 1 ve
ever seen," he said
Laura McLean is working her way back into
shape after taking a break from swimming since
she returned home from the Goodwill Games, but
still managed a second behind classmate
Griglione in the 200 IM.
"That's probably the longest period of time she
has been out of the water,' Haines said of his
other top recruit. "(But) she has great talent.
Another freshman, Lisa Gillespie, showed
promise with a 4:58.71 timing and first place
finish in the 500 freestyle.
However, the best race of the day was provided
by a pair of sophomore veterans, Jenna Johnson
and Aimee Berzins. Johnson, who rewrote the
Stanford record book last year and captured a
gold medal in the 400 medley relay at the World
Championships, showed that she is quickly
working into form with a blazing 51-60 in the 100
freestyle. Close in her wake, though, was Berzins
with a 5182 clocking.
Johnson also captured the 50 freestyle and
swam a leg on the victorious freestyle relay.
Rapp gave an encouraging performance as she
continues to work her way back from a knee in
jury that knocked her out of action two years ago.
Rapp stroked her way to victory in the 200 back
stroke, copped second in the 200 freestyle and
swam on the first-place 400 medley relay team.
"She's just now getting back to swimming the
breaststroke without pain in the knee," Haines
said.
While Haines said, "We're not ready to swim
fast yet," he still characterized the meet as "pretty
good." Nonetheless, he had his swimmers back in
the pool for a 6 a.m. workout today as the squad
continues two-a-day workouts and weight train
ing in preparation for the meat of the schedule.
