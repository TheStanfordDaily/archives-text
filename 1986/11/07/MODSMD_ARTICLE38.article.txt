# Soccer home against Brown
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
After a disappointing tie with Santa Clara Wednesday, the
Stanford men's soccer team faces two tough challenges this
weekend. The Cardinal faces Brown University today a*: 2:30
p.m. at Maloney Field and then travels to California on Sun
day for the final conference game of the season.
Brown has special meaning for the Cardinal. Stanford
Coach Sam Koch is a former junior varsity soccer coach at
Brown, and Stanford Asst. Coach Hunter Stern was a star
goalkeeper in the Ivy League at Brown. The two teams met
last season at Brown during Stanford's Eastern road trip.
The game ended in a 0-0 tie.
"We should've beaten them last year," junior midfielder
Brian Mahaffey said. "They're about .500 this season. They'll
be tough. They're a hard-working team with a lot of tough
tackling. They've had trouble beating the teams they should,
and then they play well against the better teams.
"They have a strong alumni following here that has been
promoting the game a lot. They'll have a lot of fans at the
game," he added.
The question of fans is a sore spot for Stanford soccer.
Coach Koch was upset after the Santa Clara game at the lack
of fan support for the Cardinal.

"It's scary how after the game there are more fans for
Santa Clara than Stanford here. And it's our home field,"
Koch said.
The absence of fans is something the Cardinal is growing
accustomed to.
"It's been like this for three years now. We've gotten used
to it. We just expect to see a few scattered people in the
stands. Saturdays are best because we get straggling tail
gaters after the football games," MahafTey said.
Despite the ties with Brown, it will be hard for the Card
inal to keep their minds off Sunday's contest with California.
The Bears are 14-4-2 and 2-2-1 in the conference. They still
have a shot at the Pacific Soccer Conference title. Berkeley
has defeated the University of San Francisco, a highly ranked
conference rival. They also defeated Washington at the
Pacific 10 Conference Tournament earlier this season. And
every meeting with the Bears brings with it an air of the Big
Game.
"Beating Cal will give the young guys something to work
off in the off season. We haven't beaten a really good team
this season. Beating Cal last season was great. There even
used to be something called the Boot (like the Axe). Some
how it got lost in the transition between (former coach) Nel
son Lodge and Coach Koch. Nobody knows where it is now.
And there's always a good crowd at Cal," said Mahaffey.
