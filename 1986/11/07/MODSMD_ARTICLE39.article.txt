# Fetter admitted to Greek ranks
## 
### 
It finally happened. The Greek of the
Week beat all six of The Daily's resi
dent prognosticators. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy went 7-3 on last
week's slate of 10 games, while the res
idents could manage no better than 6-
4. Kennedy also scored with his bonus
pick of Brown over his old alma mater,
Harvard, and found time to call the
Peninsula's largest morning paper to
gloat.
This week we turn to the reason many
of you are here — Dean of Admissions
Jean Fetter. Aided by "a multitude of
talent" in the Admissions Office, in
cluding former Cardinal basketball
great Kent Seymour, Fetter and friends
fearlessly went forth with the picks.
Fetter selected Stanford as a 21-17
winner over UCLA in the game of main
concern, and in our game with schools
that take students she doesn't admit,
she predicted that Dartmouth would
extend Columbia's losing streak to 29
games.
Among the residents, Susan Slusser
suffered through a 5-5 week to drop
into a tie with Ken Stevens for first
place in the race for the case.
