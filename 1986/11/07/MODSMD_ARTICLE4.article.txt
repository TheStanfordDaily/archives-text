# Trend toward careerism is disputed

### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
When Ruth Snyder was advising freshmen in
the late '60s, a student interested in business
would have to close the door and tell her things
"in complete confidence." Things have changed,
said Snyder, now the head of the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC).
"I think we see a lot more of (careerism), but
it's not the driving force," she said. "Education is
still a top priority."
University officials, faculty, and students dis
agree on whether careerism is on the rise at Stan
ford, despite a recent report on undergraduate
education issued by the Carnegie Foundation that
claims students are increasingly preoccupied
with career goals.
"If anyone comes through here (CPPC), we're
also saying, 'don't walk through Stanford with
blinders on, there are too many opportunities to
explore and enjoy,' " Snyder said.
Snyder also said there is a certain amount of
peer pressure now for students to pursue a
career in business. Investment banking is the"in
thing to do. People are almost apologetic if
they're not interested in it," she said.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the University presi

dent and former head of the undergraduate advis
ing center, said he doesn't think there has been a
trend towards careerism
"I think it's perfectly natural that people are
concerned with their future," he said. "I don't at
all condemn students for thinking about their
careers, but the problem is when it occurs to the
detriment of education."
Hamrdla, a Stanford graduate of 1955, said he
doesn't think student attitudes have changed sub
stantially over the years.
"One reason is economic conditions have fluc
tuated,' he said. Students want to secure their
future, he added.
Before the military draft ended in 1973, "many,
many more students were going on to graduate
school (to avoid the dnift)," Hamrdla said.
"Another thing we've been doing, through
advising, is to emphasize that educational and
vocational goals are not necessarily the same
thing," he said.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee said students now are more concerned
about careers than 10 or 15 years ago. "There's a
certain instrumental attitude toward one's
studies, that it be applicable to making one's
living."
1 The number of people majoring in humanities

has dropped considerably, she said, adding that
demographic and economic changes have
a difTererft climate at schools':
Lougee said students are often nervous about
the ott-asked question, "what are you going to do
with it (your major)?" But she added: "Everyone
between the ages of 18 and 21 has the luxury of
studying what makes them grow intellectually.
The long perspective shows people have the
luxury of taking these years and simply growing
with them.
"There are skills, intellectual skills, which do
have real applications. It's just harder to articulate
what they are," she said.
The University does make an effective effort at
countering pre-professional attitudes, Lougee
said. "It's not something that's the fault of the fac
ulty, the university, or the students."
According to Kathy Thoelecke, an advising con
sultant at the Undergraduate Advising Center,
careerism is not on the rise. "I see a lot of ener
getic, academically motivated students."
"Careerists are the exception," she said. "The
students we talk to, in general, are interested in
their major for intellectual and academic
reasoas."
She said pre-med students and pre law stu

dents are "every bit as interested in academics
and humanities."
Thoelecke said: "If you pick something that's
practical, that you're not very good at, your work
will suffer acacemically.
"Whether it's engineering or English, you learn
skills both intellectual and practical," she said.
The advising center tries to help students artic
ulate why they are interested in their major,
Thoelecke said. "We get them to be articulate
about what they want. Parental pressure is an
swered by an articulate person. If you can answer
with confidence about what you're doing, it'll
help."
According to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, the term careerism is an ambiguous term.
"It has a pejorative sense, meaning business." He
added, "We're not a major producer of faculty
members here or at other institutions Is that
careerism?
"I do see a difference over a decade. Perhaps
students are more concerned about what comes
later, but it's not directed to a particular job, nor a
prior commitment to a certain field of engineer
ing if that's what careerism Is," Lyons said.
He added: "Stanford, from its beginning, has
been a blend of the liberal and practical."
