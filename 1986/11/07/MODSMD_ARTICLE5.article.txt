# Band's performance in post-season is uncertain
## 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said last night
that he is adopting a "wait-and-see" attitude con
cerning the Band's participation in a possible
post-season bowl game.
Geiger also said the Band's suspension will not
affect the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB) operations during bas
ketball season.
Although the Band will play in the Coca-Cola
Bowl in Tokyo on Thanksgiving weekend. Geiger
said the Band's involvement in a post-season
game — should the football team win a bid — is
uncertain.
"I just want to think about it" for the time
being, he said.
Geiger denied that the suspension of the Band
was a planned action on the administration's part.
"There's nothing secret or special" about the
move or its timing, he said.
Geiger said he suspended the Band for various
reasons. "It was an accumulation of things. I had
no trust in what would be done on the field or
what would be said over the public address sys
tem."
He also gainsayed the notion that only those in
dividuals who acted crudely at Band perfor
mances should be punished "The Band is an or
ganization, as the ftxMball team is, and its mem
bers have to take some pride in that organiza
tion," he said.
Band Manager Jeff Stevens agreed with Geiger.
"The Band as a whole needs to take the blame,"
he said yesterday.
Stevens said that "changes need to be made" in
the Band. "We can't continue to let (Geiger) take
the heai for us," he said
"The Band has an attitude problem," Stevens
said.
Geiger called Stevens' reaction "encouraging,"

Geiger said he and members ot the band
need to spend a lot of time talking about how
the Band operates in the future — its style, con
duct, discipline .. these tilings need to be talked
about."
According to Stevens, the reaction to the
suspension among Band members was mixed.
When it was announced, he said, "The room was
silent. There were some tears. Most people were
pretty shocked."
Stevens said he has received encouragement
from students as well. "The student support
seems to be there," he said, noting calls he
received from a COP member, a senior class pres
ident and a member of the Axe Committee.
Reaction among other students has been
mostly positive.
Gayle l ong said, "As a senior, the Band not
playing at Big G.une will be a big letdown."
"I think it's terrible," said senior Jan Ellison.
"Football games are boring without the band."
Yannis Papaionnou, a gradute student in indus
trial engineering, called the administration's ac
tion a "silly response. It shows they don't have a
sense of humor.
"I don't think the Band should be penalized for
what one member did, - ' sophomore Jasmine
Pierre Louis said.'"One member maybe should
be suspended — not the entire Band."
Some students were less supportive of the
Band.
Junior William Pate said he feels the Univer
sity's response to the situation is justified.
"Hearing about some of the incidents, I'm not
surprised, he said.
Junior Erie Allen went even further "There's a
time and a place for everything, and halftime in
front of SO,00() alumni and family is neither the
time nor the place to form a phallic symbol."
However, most students echoed the response
of junior Stephanie Valdez.
"Give them a second chance," she said
