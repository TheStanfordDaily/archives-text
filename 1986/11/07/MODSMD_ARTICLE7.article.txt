Walker receives life sentence
BALTIMORE —John Walker Jr., the admitted spy for the Soviets who
masterminded one of the most damaging espionage rings in U.S. history,
was sentenced yesterday to life imprisonment by a federal judge who
vowed "to do everything in my power" to ensure that Walker is not paroled
when he becomes eligible in 10 years.
In the likely closing chapter of the family espionage drama that launched
what came to be known as the year of the spy, U.S. District Judge Alexander
Harvey II said he would "strenuously recommend" that Walker never be
freed.
Imposing the sentences provided for in a plea bargain with the Justice
Department, Harvey told Walker's son, Micliael Walker, that he would also
recommend that the 24-year-old former Navy seaman serve his entire 25-
year prison term. Michael Walker would be eligible for parole after eight
years and four months.
As John Walker, 49, stood impassively before him, Harvey said that the
former Navy chief warrant officer betrayed his country for "pure cold cash"
and still fails "to appreciate the enormity of these grave crimes," which
spanned nearly 18 years.
Although judges' views are not binding on the question of when a pris
oner is paroled, "obviously, federal judges' remarks are always taken
seriously," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert McDonald, the prosecutor in
the case.
Soviet defector Vitaly Yurchenko told U.S. intelligence officers that the
KGB "considered the Walker-Whitworth operation to be the most impor
tant" in its history, and that the information obtained from the ring would
have been "devastating" to the United States in the event of a war,
Studeman said. The Soviets paid Walker about $1 million for the informa
tion, prosecutors said.
ANC seeks Soviet weapons, aid
MOSCOW — Oliver Tambo, head of the African National Congress, said
yesterday after making a request for Soviet weapons that the group would
step up its armed attacks all across South Africa next month.
Tambo told a news conference that the African National Congress looked
to Moscow and other socialist countries for arms as well as food, clothing
and vehicles for its guerrilla units.
"We see in the near future a substantial stepping up of our offensive, not
only near the Mozambique border but throughout the country," he said.
Tambo said he had met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and was
given assurances of support in the African National Congress' struggle to
topple the South African government.
Tambo described the Soviet Union as a "genuine ally" in the battle
against apartheid and said it was not acting out of selfish reasons or trying
to establish a sphere of influence in southern Africa.
Tambo said that other countries, among them Sweden, the Netherlands
and Canada, provided financial assistance but that only the Soviet Union
and its East bloc allies would supply weapons.
While praising the Soviet Union, Tambo had little good to say about the
United States. President Reagan has personally condemned the African Na
tional Congress as a terrorist organization with Communist leanings.
GM will close 11 Midwest plants
DETROIT — General Motors Corp., in the largest wave of permanent
plant closings it has ever announced, said yesterday that it will shut down
11 assembly and component facilities between 1987 and 1989, eliminating
29,000 jobs throughout the Midwest.
The closings are part of GM's corporate-wide drive to drastically reduce
costs and boost sagging profit margins in the face of sluggish sales and in
creasing foreign competition. GM has just reported a $338.5 million oper
ating loss for the third quarter, its largest deficit since the recession.
As a result, the world's largest industrial company has come under heavy
fire from industry observers who say it has allowed its manufacturing costs
to run wild. But GM Chairman Roger Smith stressed yesterday that the
closings will reduce the auto maker's fixed costs by $500 million a year and
added that GM is planning to reduce its salaried work force by 25 percent
by 1990.
The decision to idle so many plants also reflects GM's desire to rid its
manufacturing network of its oldest operations in order to consolidate car
and truck malting at newer facilities employing fewer workers.
The bulk of the closings will come in GM's enormous manufacturing
network in Michigan, hitting the auto-dependent state with a severe body
blow just as it has been slowly recovering from the last recession.
Papers indicate Waldheim's unit
WASHINGTON — Captured Nazi documents indicate that the military
unit of current Austrian President Kurt Waldheim was directly responsible
for the mass deportation of Yugoslav civilians to concentration camps in
1942 following a brutal Nazi purge of the Kozara region of Yugoslavia.
Waldheim, who for months denied any involvement in the Kozara opera
tion, acknowledged last month that he was in the Kozara area in the spring
and summer of 1942, but said that he was a non-combatant "supply offi
cer."
The documents show that the quartermaster's department was assigned
responsibility for the deportations of some 68,000 civilians. Many people
perished in long marches to concentration camps. In the camps, 23,000
children under the age of 14 were separated from their parents and sent to
special children's camps where 11,000 died of starvation and disease.
The documents do not mention Waldheim and there is no evidence that
he was personally involved in the deportations; all other Nazi documents
that have come to light show Waldheim serving as an intelligence officer at
other times during the war.
Soviets expect bumper harvest
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union expects a grain harvest this year of about
210 million metric tons, the largest crop in eight years, Yegor Ligachev, a
member of the Politburo, announced yesterday.
Ligachev said the harvest was 30 million metric tons above the average
figure for the past five years. Even so, the crop was well below the 250 mil
lion metric tons projected in the Kremlin's five-year plan.
The bumper harvest may reduce costly Soviet purchases of wheat, corn
and other grains from the United States, Canada, Argentina and other sup
pliers, but perhaps further depress world grain prices, according to West
ern diplomats.
Ligachev, the No. 2 man in the Kremlin hierarchy, gave the main speech
at a meeting of top government and party leaders on the eve of the 69th an
niversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. An elite audience of party officials,
including Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and nine other members of the
Politburo, applauded the announcement.
Black vote pivotal in deep South
WASHINGTON — Blacks remained overwhelmingly loyal to the Demo
cratic Party in Tuesday's election, voting almost 90 percent for Democratic
Senate candidates across the nation and tipping the balance in at least four
close Senate races in the Deep South, according to ABC News exit polls.
The most striking example, according to the poll figures, was in Ala
bama, where Richard Shelby won only 37 percent of the white vote against
Republican Sen. Jeremiah Denton but more than made up the difference
with 91 percent of the black vote. Shelby 's final margin of victory was just
over 13,000 votes.
Blacks also made a critical difference in the narrow re-election victory of
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) over Republican Ed Zschau. According to the
poll figures, Cranston won a slim majority among white voters but more
than 90 percent of the black vote.

As a result, the world's largest industrial company has come under heavy
fire from industry observers who say it has allowed its manufacturing costs
to run wild. But GM Chairman Roger Smith stressed yesterday that the
closings will reduce the auto maker's fixed costs by $500 million a year and
added that GM is planning to reduce its salaried work force by 25 percent
by 1990.
The decision to idle so many plants also reflects GM's desire to rid its
manufacturing network of its oldest operations in order to consolidate car
and truck malting at newer facilities employing fewer workers.
The bulk of the closings will come in GM's enormous manufacturing
network in Michigan, hitting the auto-dependent state with a severe body
blow just as it has been slowly recovering from the last recession.
Papers indicate Waldheim's unit
WASHINGTON — Captured Nazi documents indicate that the military
unit of current Austrian President Kurt Waldheim was directly responsible
for the mass deportation of Yugoslav civilians to concentration camps in
1942 following a brutal Nazi purge of the Kozara region of Yugoslavia.
Waldheim, who for months denied any involvement in the Kozara opera
tion, acknowledged last month that he was in the Kozara area in the spring
and summer of 1942, but said that he was a non-combatant "supply offi
cer."
The documents show that the quartermaster's department was assigned
responsibility for the deportations of some 68,000 civilians. Many people
perished in long marches to concentration camps. In the camps, 23,000
children under the age of 14 were separated from their parents and sent to
special children's camps where 11,000 died of starvation and disease.
The documents do not mention Waldheim and there is no evidence that
he was personally involved in the deportations; all other Nazi documents
that have come to light show Waldheim serving as an intelligence officer at
other times during the war.
Soviets expect bumper harvest
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union expects a grain harvest this year of about
210 million metric tons, the largest crop in eight years, Yegor Ligachev, a
member of the Politburo, announced yesterday.
Ligachev said the harvest was 30 million metric tons above the average
figure for the past five years. Even so, the crop was well below the 250 mil
lion metric tons projected in the Kremlin's five-year plan.
The bumper harvest may reduce costly Soviet purchases of wheat, corn
and other grains from the United States, Canada, Argentina and other sup
pliers, but perhaps further depress world grain prices, according to West
ern diplomats.
Ligachev, the No. 2 man in the Kremlin hierarchy, gave the main speech
at a meeting of top government and party leaders on the eve of the 69th an
niversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. An elite audience of party officials,
including Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and nine other members of the
Politburo, applauded the announcement.
Black vote pivotal in deep South
WASHINGTON — Blacks remained overwhelmingly loyal to the Demo
cratic Party in Tuesday's election, voting almost 90 percent for Democratic
Senate candidates across the nation and tipping the balance in at least four
close Senate races in the Deep South, according to ABC News exit polls.
The most striking example, according to the poll figures, was in Ala
bama, where Richard Shelby won only 37 percent of the white vote against
Republican Sen. Jeremiah Denton but more than made up the difference
with 91 percent of the black vote. Shelby 's final margin of victory was just
over 13,000 votes.
Blacks also made a critical difference in the narrow re-election victory of
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) over Republican Ed Zschau. According to the
poll figures, Cranston won a slim majority among white voters but more
than 90 percent of the black vote.

Walker receives life sentence
BALTIMORE —John Walker Jr., the admitted spy for the Soviets who
masterminded one of the most damaging espionage rings in U.S. history,
was sentenced yesterday to life imprisonment by a federal judge who
vowed "to do everything in my power" to ensure that Walker is not paroled
when he becomes eligible in 10 years.
In the likely closing chapter of the family espionage drama that launched
what came to be known as the year of the spy, U.S. District Judge Alexander
Harvey II said he would "strenuously recommend" that Walker never be
freed.
Imposing the sentences provided for in a plea bargain with the Justice
Department, Harvey told Walker's son, Micliael Walker, that he would also
recommend that the 24-year-old former Navy seaman serve his entire 25-
year prison term. Michael Walker would be eligible for parole after eight
years and four months.
As John Walker, 49, stood impassively before him, Harvey said that the
former Navy chief warrant officer betrayed his country for "pure cold cash"
and still fails "to appreciate the enormity of these grave crimes," which
spanned nearly 18 years.
Although judges' views are not binding on the question of when a pris
oner is paroled, "obviously, federal judges' remarks are always taken
seriously," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert McDonald, the prosecutor in
the case.
Soviet defector Vitaly Yurchenko told U.S. intelligence officers that the
KGB "considered the Walker-Whitworth operation to be the most impor
tant" in its history, and that the information obtained from the ring would
have been "devastating" to the United States in the event of a war,
Studeman said. The Soviets paid Walker about $1 million for the informa
tion, prosecutors said.
ANC seeks Soviet weapons, aid
MOSCOW — Oliver Tambo, head of the African National Congress, said
yesterday after making a request for Soviet weapons that the group would
step up its armed attacks all across South Africa next month.
Tambo told a news conference that the African National Congress looked
to Moscow and other socialist countries for arms as well as food, clothing
and vehicles for its guerrilla units.
"We see in the near future a substantial stepping up of our offensive, not
only near the Mozambique border but throughout the country," he said.
Tambo said he had met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and was
given assurances of support in the African National Congress' struggle to
topple the South African government.
Tambo described the Soviet Union as a "genuine ally" in the battle
against apartheid and said it was not acting out of selfish reasons or trying
to establish a sphere of influence in southern Africa.
Tambo said that other countries, among them Sweden, the Netherlands
and Canada, provided financial assistance but that only the Soviet Union
and its East bloc allies would supply weapons.
While praising the Soviet Union, Tambo had little good to say about the
United States. President Reagan has personally condemned the African Na
tional Congress as a terrorist organization with Communist leanings.
GM will close 11 Midwest plants
DETROIT — General Motors Corp., in the largest wave of permanent
plant closings it has ever announced, said yesterday that it will shut down
11 assembly and component facilities between 1987 and 1989, eliminating
29,000 jobs throughout the Midwest.
The closings are part of GM's corporate-wide drive to drastically reduce
costs and boost sagging profit margins in the face of sluggish sales and in
creasing foreign competition. GM has just reported a $338.5 million oper
ating loss for the third quarter, its largest deficit since the recession.
As a result, the world's largest industrial company has come under heavy
fire from industry observers who say it has allowed its manufacturing costs
