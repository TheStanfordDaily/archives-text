# Iran dealings draw criticism

### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary' of State George Shultz
protested to President Reagan that a secret White
House plan to obtain the release of U.S. hostages in
Lebanon by permitting shipments of military equip
ment to Iran contradicted U.S. policy against
negotiating with terrorist states, informed sources
said yesterday.
Although the clandestine White House program
proceeded anyway, the sources added, it was halted
briefly after the release of the Rev. Benjamin Weir in
September 1985. At that time, the half-dozen or so
senior State Department officials who knew about it
argued that exchanging military goods for hostages
could lead to more kidnapings of Americans.
But the White House resumed the program —
with at least some of the goods apparently traveling
circuitous routes from Israel to European countries
and finally to Iran in an eventually successful effort to
free two more hostages. In recent months, there was
also hope that the program would promote better
ties with Iranian politicians and military leaders jock
eying to succeed the aging Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the sources said.
Simultaneously, the administration was reassuring
Iran's bitter enemy, Iraq, of American neutrality in
the 6-year-old Persian Gulf war. The Iraqis
responded, two sources said yesterday, by promising
to restrain their support of terrorist groups and by
placing terrorist Mohammed Abu Abbas under house
arrest. In July, Abbas was convicted in abstentia in
Italy of involvement in the hijacking of the Achille

Lauro cruise ship which resulted in the murder of
American Leon Klinghoffer.
Abbas, one of his chief lieutenants and the four
hijackers were in Italian custody briefly in October
1985 when U.S. jets intercepted the plane that was
flying them from Egypt to Tunisia after the hijacking.
Abbas was released, however, and some reports have
said he was living in Baghdad. It is not clear what the
Iraqis plan to do with Abbas.
The secret White House program was originally di
rected by then-national security affairs adviser Robert
McFarlane and later by Lt. Col. Oliver North, a deputy
director of the National Security Council staff,
sources said.
The first public word of the program came Tues
day when the speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said McFarlane and four
others had gone to Tehran in September aboard a
plane carrying weapons spare parts. That disclosure
was apparently the result of political infighting in
Iran which pitted Rafsanjani against Muslim fun
damentalists, who opposed his dealing with the
Americans.
The Iranian disclosure, sources said, may have
ended chances for the quick release of two addi
tional hostages held by the Islamic Jihad, which has
close ties to Iran. The release last Sunday of David
Jacobsen — as well as the freeing of Weir last year
and the Rev. Lawrence Jenco in July — were tied to
shipments of military cargo, sources said.
U.S. sources who confirmed that McFarlane had

traveled to Tehran said he was there to discuss the
hostages, to urge Iran's leaders to end support of ter
rorism and to seek an end to the war with Iraq.
Sources said that there had been earlier trips to
Tehran by North and others. North, who supervises
the White House counterterrorism operation, also
has played a leading role in U.S. aid to the rebel, or
contra, forces fighting the government of Nicaragua.
Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr, president of Iran from
1979 until 1981, when he was forced to flee the
country, said on the ABC News "Nightline" program
Wednesday that he was aware of American and Israeli
arms shipments reaching Iran as recently as August
and September.
Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.V.)
called yesterday for Senate hearings on the matter
and demanded an explanation from the Reagan ad
ministration.
Because Democrats will take control of the Senate
next January as a result of Tuesday's election, Byrd
said, administration officials cannot avoid a hearing
and will be compelled to provide answers to why
they violated President Reagan's own announced
policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists.
"Now, with Democrats in control," declared Byrd,
slamming his fist on a table, "we're going to ha\e
some answers — and they just can't slough it off, and
they can't hold it off, and they can't just refuse to hold
hearings."

close ties to Iran. The release last Sunday of David
Jacobsen — as well as the freeing of Weir last year
and the Rev. Lawrence Jenco in July — were tied to
shipments of military cargo, sources said.
U.S. sources who confirmed that McFarlane had

traveled to Tehran said he was there to discuss the
hostages, to urge Iran's leaders to end support of ter
rorism and to seek an end to the war with Iraq.
Sources said that there had been earlier trips to
Tehran by North and others. North, who supervises
the White House counterterrorism operation, also
has played a leading role in U.S. aid to the rebel, or
contra, forces fighting the government of Nicaragua.
Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr, president of Iran from
1979 until 1981, when he was forced to flee the
country, said on the ABC News "Nightline" program
Wednesday that he was aware of American and Israeli
arms shipments reaching Iran as recently as August
and September.
Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.V.)
called yesterday for Senate hearings on the matter
and demanded an explanation from the Reagan ad
ministration.
Because Democrats will take control of the Senate
next January as a result of Tuesday's election, Byrd
said, administration officials cannot avoid a hearing
and will be compelled to provide answers to why
they violated President Reagan's own announced
policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists.
"Now, with Democrats in control," declared Byrd,
slamming his fist on a table, "we're going to ha\e
some answers — and they just can't slough it off, and
they can't hold it off, and they can't just refuse to hold
hearings."
