# Vienna arms talks end in failure

### 
VIENNA, Austria — U.S. Secretary of
State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze yester
day failed to make headway toward
curbing nuclear weapons and left the
future of arms control and superpower
summits in doubt.
Shultz told reporters after his five
hours of talks with Shevardnadze over
two days: "I can't say that the meetings
have moved arms control matters
along in any significant way, and I
regret this."
Shevardnadze said he was returning
to Moscow "with a bitter taste" after
being confronted with "a mixed bag of
old mothballed views and ap
proaches."

Summing up the meetings, which
took place while Shevardnadze and
Shultz were in Vienna for a conference
on human rights and East-West rela
tions, one senior U.S. official said: "It
was a bust."
Another senior U.S. official, also
speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there would be no further high
level sessions until the Soviets indi
cated a willingness to negotiate con
structively.
Shevardnadze said another super
power summit "will all depend on fur
ther contacts. The dialogue will be
continued." Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev agreed last November to a
meeting with President Reagan in

Washington this year.
Shultz said the subject "never came
up" in his talks with Shevardnadze.
Speaking of efforts to reverse the
arms race, Shultz said: "This is a long
paced negotiation, I'm sure, and it has
its rhythm.... The pace cannot be
forced by either party."
U.S.-Soviet arms control talks in
Geneva are to recess next week until
January. Shultz offered to have U.S. and
Soviet experts meet in the interim, but
Shevardnadze apparently did not ac
cept.
A package of U.S. proposals, reflect
ing the tentative arms reduction ac
cords reached in last month's Iceland
summit, were presented last week to

Soviet negotiators. U.S. officials said
the Soviets have not responded.
Shevardnadze, at an airport news
conference, said "we will put forth our
new proposals" today at Geneva. He
said they would be "guided by the pos
itions reached at Reykjavik."
A senior U.S. official said he ex
pected no change in basic Soviet posi
tions.
The official said the Soviets would
again demand testing of "Star Wars"
technology be limited to laboratories,
abolishing all strategic weapons by
1996, and an end to U.S. development
of short-range nuclear weapons to be
used for Western Europe's defense.
