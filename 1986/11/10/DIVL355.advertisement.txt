Isn't your idea of fun to take the
first idea that comes to your mind,
like how some special interest
group would make an interesting
story or some professor actually
doubles as a nightclub singer or
some secluded spot on campus
where a murder occurred years ago
is haunted by the ghost of the vic
tim, and rush down to the Daily
office and get it printed pronto?
But is it good enough?
You'll never know unless you
bring it in to The Daily. Drop by,
armed with an idea for features,
• •
news, entertainment Or sports.
