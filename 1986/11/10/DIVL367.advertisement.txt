I BET YOU ■
DIDN'T KNOW
By Anderson Chevrolet
■ Do you have any Idea who ■
■ was the biggest man ever to ■
• play pro football? . . . An- ■
a swer is Les Bingaman who ■
. played for the Detroit Lions .
j from 1948 through 1954 . .
| . He set the pro football .
| record in 1954 when he _
J weighed in at 349 pounds. _

J Oddly enough, here's a foot- ■
! ball question that looks easy, ■
J but it's surprising how few fans- .
! -even the real good one-can _
J answer it ... Try it on your _
J friends and see . . . The ques- ■
*tion is this: Everybody knows a I
■ football field is 100 yards long ■
i from goal line to goal line-but, J
I do you know have WIDE a ■
I football field is? ... A football ■
I field is 160 feet, or 53 1%3 '
I yards wide.
I Ever wonder where the ■
I tradition started of having a I
I band at football games . . . ■
I It was at Notre Dame, I
I which was the first college I
I in America to have a band . I
I . . Their band first marched I
I at a football game in 1888 . I
I . . They really started some- I
I thing, didn't they?
