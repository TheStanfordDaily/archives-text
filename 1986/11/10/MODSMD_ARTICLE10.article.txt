Become a professor
Consider the possibility of becoming a pro
fessor, Norman Wessells, dean of Stanford's
School of Humanities and Sciences, told several
hundred gifted students, their teachers and par
ents Thursday.
"The demographics of the American profes
sorship suggest there will be large numbers of
positions in years when you will be finishing
your doctoral or professional training," Wessels
told a Stanford Conference on Gifted and
Talented Education.
According to national studies conducted by
Howard Bowen, professor of economics and
education at Claremont Graduate School, about
500,000 new faculty members will be hired over
the next 25 years. The major surge in recruit
ment will come in about 10 years, when profes
sors hired in the 1960s reach normal retirement
age.
"Professors working in universities are not in
isolated ivory towers. Universities are sites of in
tellectual energy that seed technology and com
merce, criticize and improve government and
society and illuminate human values and sense
of beings," Wessels said.
"Just as superconducters and engineered
crop plants have arisen from discoveries in the
universities of today, so too new technologies,
plans for international utilization of non
renewable resources and design of psychologi
cal modes of coping with the constant presence

of crowds of other people — to name a few —
will most assuredly stem in good measure from
the universities of tomorrow," he said.
"To be a professor in such a research univer
sity is an honor, a responsibility to society and a
pleasure. 1 commend the life to you as you plan
for the future," he said.
Speaking about the condition of the world
when today's students will be able to assume
professorships, Wessels said, "Life will be very
different. But life need not be worse. Its quality
will in good part be dependent on the commit
ment of the very brightest people on this
country and abroad to address the collective
challenge that humanity faces.
He urged students, parents and counselers to
"make a commitment to the life of the mind.
That is indeed a life of action, of accomplish
ment, of incalculable pleasures."
Gifted student education
Gifted and extraordinarily talented students
have as much right to achieving their educa
tional potential as any other group of young
people, the director of the California Gifted and
Talented Education Program said here last
Friday.
Any state that cares about the perception of
being elitist in giving special attention to these
students "is commiting intellectual suicide,"
said Linda Forsyth at a Stanford conference on
education of gifted and talented students.

Forsyth said the California program serves
218,000 gifted and talented students, located in
428 out of the state's 1,029 school districts.
Until 1979, California, like most states, chose
its gifted students solely by IQ tests, according
to Forsyth. Since then, the state has adopted the
concept of "multiple intelligences" and now in
cludes in its definition of the gifted students
who are unusually talented in such areas as an
and music.
She said die goals of a good education should
be to "do right by my child as an individual, so
that the child could control its future, not just to
submit to it, to give children all they need to be
citizens in a participatory democracy; and to
help them to be effective producers in society.
It is in the latter role that special education
for the gifted becomes particularly important,
she said. The gifted will eventually provide soci
ety with the innovation and creativity that
creates jobs; they serve as "the path finders of
tommorrow."
But the idea of providing special education
for the gifted sometimes runs into exploitation
in the schools, she said.
Forsyth said she is frequently asked by teach
ers and administrators not to separate the gifted
from regular classrooms because they serve as
role models for the other children, assist teach
ers in teaching die other children or provide
balance in the class and make teachers look
good.

SVN begins annual Holiday Drive
"Share the Spirit!" is the rallying cry as the
Stanford Volunteer Network begins its annual
Holiday Sharing Drive set tor Nov. 10-26.
In its third year, the drive is designed to
promote an awareness of the needs ot the less
fortunate during the holidays. Three activities
are being higlighted during this year's drive:
• Family boxes: Campus residences and aca
demic departments will prepare holiday gift
boxes for families in East Falo Alto and Moun
tain View. According to the size of their depart
ment or house, participating groups will create
a holiday package of toys, clothes and food and
then deliver the gift box to a pre determined lo
cation in the area by Dec. 1. Interested depart
ment or house representatives .should contact
the Volunteer Network to register their group
for the project.
• Annual Fast: The Stanford International Devel
opment Organization will sponser their annual
fast on Thursday, Nov. 20. By turning in their
meal cards for one day, students help generate
funds for local and international development
projects.
• Christmas Tree Donation: Instead of throwing
away office or house Christmas trees at the
beginning of winter break, groups are asked to
bring their decorated trees to the Owen House
lawn on Thursday, Dec. 18, between 2 and 4
p.m. Donated trees will be distributed by the
Volunteer Network to families in East Falo Alto.
