"Anyway you look at it, you lose." This idea sums up
the student perspective on Athletic Director Andy
Geiger's decision last week to prohibit the Band from
playing on the field during Big Game.
Granted, the Band has in recent weeks come to rely
more on tastelessness than creativity. More and more its
weak attempts at humor have strayed into disgusting acts
of immaturity totally lacking in class. But to restrict Band
members to the stands during Big Game punishes Stan
ford students more than anyone else.
Indeed, Geiger has not prohibited the Band from en
tertaining groups, including wealthy and often generous
alumni. But he has made sure that students, who have
the clearest right to enjoy the performance, will hear but
not see their own marching band at what is arguably the
most important game of the season.
Not only is Geiger's decision unfair to students, it con
tradicts his stated "wait and see" position on the Band's
role in post-season play. Keeping the Band off the field
in Berkeley effectively has turned this idea into a "the
Band waits and Andy Geiger doesn't have to see them"
situation.
How can Geiger decide the Band's bowl game fate if
he doesn't see it perform between now and then? If
Geiger is serious about giving the Band a chance to
prove it can be responsible, then he should let them per
form on the field, not in the bleachers.
Geiger's decision to prohibit the Band from playing
on the field at Saturday's game against UCLA was a far

more just punishment since it affected fewer Stanford
students. The Berkeley decision, however, is a mistake
that must be corrected.
The best manner in which to rectify the situation calls
for Geiger and the Band to stike a compromise over the
content of a Big Game show. Key to the success of this
agreement is that both sides realize that mistakes have
been made in this whole affair. The Band has admitted
that some aspects of its shows were tasteless, and now
Geiger must realize that tradition and the students' right
to see their own marching band require that he rethink
his decision.
Ceitainly, if Geiger and the Band work together
closely, then they can agree on a creative halftime show
that will not offend viewers. This process of working to
gether also would be beneficial since the Band would
have a better sense of how far they should be allowed to
go. Geiger has said he has warned the Band repeatedly,
but to no avail. Perhaps by working together to bring
back the halftime show, the two will establish a means of
communication that proves more effective than these
warnings.
Once the Big Game affair is history, the Band could
use this insight to make reforms and avoid future con
frontations with the University. It is crucial that the Band
clean up its act without the forced intervention of the
University. Mandates from the University regarding
proper halftime shows would worsen an already em
barassing relationship between students here and the ad
ministration.
