Students, others
want the Band
It is time for Andy Geiger to learn a
little history. Twenty-one years ago
last March 3, a man was arrested on
the UC-Berkeley campus for wearing a
sign with the word "fuck" imprinted
on it. Have we learned so little in the
past two decades?
Mr. Geiger, to quote the Daily
article on Nov. 5, thinks "there's a
difference between right and wrong
... the standards need to be higher."
Whose standards? His? Or does he
speak for the entire University admin
istration? If so, how is it that one man
may determine the morals of such a
large, ostensibly informed and intel
lectually liberal university?
There are more insulting aspects of
this university than the men and
women in the Band forming the
letters "ITSH" on the football playing
field. The behavior of the Band is not
a novel idea. In fact, one of my com
plaints of the Band is that it has
become complacent and not as fun as
it used to be. (After reading the com
ments by Band Manager Jeff Stevens
— "The Band has a deep-rooted
attitude problem. We have to change"
— I am astounded that with such
heartless leadership the LSJUMB hasn't
sunk to the depths of the Cal or USC
bands.)
The Band has been the Band for a
long time. I hope it never goes away.
But if a watered-down, penny-ante,
spineless excuse for halftime enter
tainment is the other choice, I'd rather
not have a Band at all.
It's more than the principle of free
speech (for this, unquestionably, is
the issue). It's more than a question of
censorship. And it's more than a
question of tradition. It is a question
of fun. And a question of duty.
The LSJUMB has stood by the foot
ball team through all of its defeats and
humiliations. The Band, and the stu
dent fans, have seen the football team
disgrace the "level of taste and values
that represent this place." For more
than a decade, football players have
matriculated and graduated from
Stanford for free, and the students and
Band have been there to cheer them
on, even when there was little hope of
as much as a winning season. The
Band on many occasions has saved the
day for the football squad. It is now
time for the football team to show
some much deserved support for the
Band.
Furthermore, there are more than a

couple of students on campus that
may never see Big Game again. They
will never get the enjoyment of seeing
the Band, in all its glory, at its best:
Big Game at Berkeley. Mr. Geiger
owes it to them, the graduating
seniors, who have stood by the ath
letic teams at this university for four
years (or more). They want the Band.
I want the Band. The Coca-Cola Bowl
wants the Band. Even Cal wants the
Band.
Give us the Band.

Western Culture
task force seeks
student input
We are writing to dispel certain
misperceptions about our recent
nominations to the Western Culture
Task Force. We are concerned that
recent press coverage of the task force
selection process reflects: 1) an inac
curate polarization of the issue into a
community-wide gender and race
conflict; and 2) a failure to recognize
the unity of purpose of the involved
students — specifically, of the three
student task force representatives.
For example, the Nov. 3 Stanford
Daily headline, "Task Force Attacked,"
implies that antagonism exists be
tween the BSU, the ASSU Nominations
Committee, the task force and other
concerned students. Actually, the
problem seems to have stemmed
from a lack of communication during
the nomination process; in no way
was the BSU attacking individual
members of the Nom Com, the task
force, or the nominated students. We
recognize our diverse backgrounds
and see them not as a source of con
flict, but as a source of collective
strength in our united commitment to
change.
The current Western Culture Pro
gram contains both strengths and
weaknesses; however, its exclusion of
the experiences and contributions of
working-class people, women and
peoples of color Is an inherent flaw
that can and must be immediately
addressed. The task force has already
committed itself to a series of
structured interviews with organized
student groups in the Stanford com
munity. We acknowledge the impor
tant role that these student groups
have played throughout the history of

this debate. In addition, as the three
student representatives on the task
force, we would like to personally
encourage a more complete campus
wide dialogue about the Western
Culture requirement. We wish to
stress that we are accountable to the
entire student body and desire input
and criticism from all sectors of
campus.

Express opposition
to library now —
sign a petition
We would like to alert Stanford
University faculty and staff and Palo
Alto citizens who are concerned about
the site of the Ronald Reagan Library.
Many of us feel that the proposed
library site (in the foothills behind the
Stanford campus near the Dish) and a
probable access road running through
the foothills onto Juniperra Serra
Boulevard will disrupt the beauty of
campus and hazardously increase
traffic along an already overburdened
Junipero Serra. We feel that the library
site and access road has moved for
ward with inadequate solicitation of
the community's views.
Many people feel strongly about
this issue but are not aware that there
is an avenue to express their opinion.
Now is the time to express our views
before irrevocable steps are taken to
build the library. This is not a referen
dum on Ronald Reagan's political
philosophy. We are only concerned
with the effects that the proposed
library would have on a very impor
tant resource of our community, the
foothills, and on the adjoining road,
Junipero Serra.
We urge those who oppose the
library and access road site to sign
petitions that will be circulating over
the next two weeks. Petitions will be
available at the foot path entrance to
the hills across from campus drive
daily from noon until 2 p.m. and all
day Saturday and Sunday. Anybody
who wishes to help circulate petitions
in their community or University area
should contact Sam Brain.

Students, others
want the Band
It is time for Andy Geiger to learn a
little history. Twenty-one years ago
last March 3, a man was arrested on
the UC-Berkeley campus for wearing a
sign with the word "fuck" imprinted
on it. Have we learned so little in the
past two decades?
Mr. Geiger, to quote the Daily
article on Nov. 5, thinks "there's a
difference between right and wrong
... the standards need to be higher."
Whose standards? His? Or does he
speak for the entire University admin
istration? If so, how is it that one man
may determine the morals of such a
large, ostensibly informed and intel
lectually liberal university?
There are more insulting aspects of
this university than the men and
women in the Band forming the
letters "ITSH" on the football playing
field. The behavior of the Band is not
a novel idea. In fact, one of my com
plaints of the Band is that it has
become complacent and not as fun as
it used to be. (After reading the com
ments by Band Manager Jeff Stevens
— "The Band has a deep-rooted
attitude problem. We have to change"
— I am astounded that with such
heartless leadership the LSJUMB hasn't
sunk to the depths of the Cal or USC
bands.)
The Band has been the Band for a
long time. I hope it never goes away.
But if a watered-down, penny-ante,
spineless excuse for halftime enter
tainment is the other choice, I'd rather
not have a Band at all.
It's more than the principle of free
speech (for this, unquestionably, is
the issue). It's more than a question of
censorship. And it's more than a
question of tradition. It is a question
of fun. And a question of duty.
The LSJUMB has stood by the foot
ball team through all of its defeats and
humiliations. The Band, and the stu
dent fans, have seen the football team
disgrace the "level of taste and values
that represent this place." For more
than a decade, football players have
matriculated and graduated from
Stanford for free, and the students and
Band have been there to cheer them
on, even when there was little hope of
as much as a winning season. The
Band on many occasions has saved the
day for the football squad. It is now
time for the football team to show
some much deserved support for the
Band.
Furthermore, there are more than a

couple of students on campus that
may never see Big Game again. They
will never get the enjoyment of seeing
the Band, in all its glory, at its best:
Big Game at Berkeley. Mr. Geiger
owes it to them, the graduating
seniors, who have stood by the ath
letic teams at this university for four
years (or more). They want the Band.
I want the Band. The Coca-Cola Bowl
wants the Band. Even Cal wants the
Band.
Give us the Band.

Western Culture
task force seeks
student input
We are writing to dispel certain
misperceptions about our recent
nominations to the Western Culture
Task Force. We are concerned that
recent press coverage of the task force
selection process reflects: 1) an inac
curate polarization of the issue into a
community-wide gender and race
conflict; and 2) a failure to recognize
the unity of purpose of the involved
students — specifically, of the three
student task force representatives.
For example, the Nov. 3 Stanford
Daily headline, "Task Force Attacked,"
implies that antagonism exists be
tween the BSU, the ASSU Nominations
Committee, the task force and other
concerned students. Actually, the
problem seems to have stemmed
from a lack of communication during
the nomination process; in no way
was the BSU attacking individual
members of the Nom Com, the task
force, or the nominated students. We
recognize our diverse backgrounds
and see them not as a source of con
flict, but as a source of collective
strength in our united commitment to
change.
The current Western Culture Pro
gram contains both strengths and
weaknesses; however, its exclusion of
the experiences and contributions of
working-class people, women and
peoples of color Is an inherent flaw
that can and must be immediately
addressed. The task force has already
committed itself to a series of
structured interviews with organized
student groups in the Stanford com
munity. We acknowledge the impor
tant role that these student groups
have played throughout the history of

this debate. In addition, as the three
student representatives on the task
force, we would like to personally
encourage a more complete campus
wide dialogue about the Western
Culture requirement. We wish to
stress that we are accountable to the
entire student body and desire input
and criticism from all sectors of
campus.

Express opposition
to library now —
sign a petition
We would like to alert Stanford
University faculty and staff and Palo
Alto citizens who are concerned about
the site of the Ronald Reagan Library.
Many of us feel that the proposed
library site (in the foothills behind the
Stanford campus near the Dish) and a
probable access road running through
the foothills onto Juniperra Serra
Boulevard will disrupt the beauty of
campus and hazardously increase
traffic along an already overburdened
Junipero Serra. We feel that the library
site and access road has moved for
ward with inadequate solicitation of
the community's views.
Many people feel strongly about
this issue but are not aware that there
is an avenue to express their opinion.
Now is the time to express our views
before irrevocable steps are taken to
build the library. This is not a referen
dum on Ronald Reagan's political
philosophy. We are only concerned
with the effects that the proposed
library would have on a very impor
tant resource of our community, the
foothills, and on the adjoining road,
Junipero Serra.
We urge those who oppose the
library and access road site to sign
petitions that will be circulating over
the next two weeks. Petitions will be
available at the foot path entrance to
the hills across from campus drive
daily from noon until 2 p.m. and all
day Saturday and Sunday. Anybody
who wishes to help circulate petitions
in their community or University area
should contact Sam Brain.
