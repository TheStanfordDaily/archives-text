# Protest animal abuse at Stanford
## 
### 
On Nov. 17, six of the 19 people arrested at a Jor
dan Hall sit-in last April are coming up for trial in the
Palo Alto Municipal Court. The sit-in was so peaceful
that the arresting police officers thanked the demon
strators for their cooperation. Nevertheless, and

unlike Berkeley where charges have been dropped
for similar protests, Stanford University, not given to
excessive magnanimity toward its protesters, had not
encouraged the local district attorney to follow suit.
Today will see another demonstration reiterating
the demand of the previous one: greater insight into
what goes on behind the doors of the University's
animal labs.
The request is fair on two grounds. One is that al
most all university biomedical research is funded by
public money and should therefore be subject to
some public oversight. Stanford's share from the Na
tional Institutes of Health was 164,240,190 — not
counting an additional 69 percent for indirect cost

recovery — In fiscal 1984, the last year for which NIH
figures are available, and has doubtless risen since
then (even though, interestingly enough, Stanford
has been rated in noncompliance with the NlH's own
guidelines for laboratory animals since 1982).
The other is the awakening consciousness on the
pan of a growing number of people that the previ
ously undisputed hegemony of the biomedical com
plex over the lives and suffering of the approximately
D-SO million animals used annually in this country
alone must be checked.
Today's demonstration will demand that the Uni
versity:
• publicly request federal agencies to increase fund
ing for the use of research technologies that do not
harm or kill animals;
• work out arrangements whereby medically trained
professionals (physicians, nurses, Ph. D.sand
veterinarians) chosen by the animal rights commu
nity can have unscheduled access to research
facilities to monitor and document experimental

procedures and the conditions under which animals
are kept;
• issue a clear statement that each student's right of
conscience not to dissect or vivisect an animal is
wholly protected;
• ban the use of lost and abandoned pets as
"research tools";
• prohibit psychological experiments on animals;
and
• begin meaningful discussions with animal rights
representatives to develop a schedule for ending uni
versity reliance on the experimental use and abuse of
animals.
People who sympathize with these objectives may
wish to join a march beginning at the Stanford Shop
ping Center parking lot by the Emporium, corner of
El Camino and Quarry Road, at 11 a.m. today or meet
at noon at President Kennedy's office, where these
demands will be presented to him.
