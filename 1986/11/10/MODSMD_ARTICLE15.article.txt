# Get ready for conservatism

OK, so Ed Zschau lost and the Democrats took the Senate
and Reagan didn't get what he wanted. But now that we've
gotten over feeling glad or sad about the election results, we
ought to ask if the outcome has anything interesting to tell
us about the future direction of politics in America.
To review briefly, the Democrats wrested control of the
Senate from the Republicans by winning virtually all of the
close races — including those where Reagan actively cam
paigned. Historically, though, candidates for the party in
power don't do very well in mid-term elections, so the Sen
ate results shouldn't give anyone a heart attack.
Of more interest, however, is how the Republicans fared
elsewhere. They lost just 10 seats in the House — far fewer
than one would expect in an off-year election — and made
significant gains in governorships and in the state
legislatures.

The newspapers have said the Democratic wins signal an
"interregnum between the Reagan Revoution and the post-
Reagan era." But what does that mean? It sounds a lot like
saying Tuesday will be a period between Monday and Wed
nesday. It implies a break in continuity that may not really
exist.
There are two basic ways to look at the recent election
outcomes. Either the Democratic victories reveal Reagan's
weakness, or else — Reagan notwithstanding — the election
confirms a conservative realignment in American politics.
One view says Reagan was an aberration in an essentially
liberal America, while the other view claims that the Senate
result is an aberration in the overall trend toward a more
conservative country.
I think the second interpretation — though perhaps less
palatable — is the more probable, especially considering
that the new Democrats in the Senate are by and large a
pretty conservative bunch. America is headed into a funda
mentally more conservative era, if we aren't already there.
This election may show that Reagan is not omnipotent, but
the conservative shift never depended on Reagan in the first
place. If anything, Reagan is much more a symptom than a
cause of conservative realignment.
Ronald Reagan started running for president in 1964. He
nearly got the nomination in 1976, but the Republicans
weren't ready for his brand of conservatism and went with a
moderate, Gerald Ford. By 1980, the GOP — and apparently
America — was ready for a conservative. Broadly speaking,
Reagan didn't tailor his campaign to voter tastes; instead, he
waited for America's tastes to come round to him.
But the evidence for a conservative shift goes beyond
Reagan's landslides. Consider the emergence of the religi
ous right as a national voice. Religious fundamentalism is
much more than Ayatollah Pat and the other tele-evangelists;
it's a social force. In the last 10 years, there has been a
revival of Scopes-style "don't-teach-my-child-secular
humanism" litigation in the South. This summer, for in
stance, a group of Tennessee parents challenged "heathen"
textbooks that teach "witchcraft, idol worship, secular
humanism and feminism."
We can likewise sense a conservative mood in the way
America has embraced the policies of Reagan's "New Pater

nalism." The current drug hysteria is a good example. What
began as media hype struck so responsive a chord with the
American people that not even the most liberal congress
man could afford to speak up against a multi-billion dollar
juggernaut drug bill. When Ron and Nancy talked about a
(counterfactual) drug epidemic with "our children's names
on it"and blamed it on a "culture of license, " America ate it
up.
But if Reagan hasn't caused the conservative shift, what
has? Perhaps it is inevitable. I know "pendulum" explana
tions can run into cliches very quickly, but I believe one
applies here.
Today's conservatism is probably a natural reaction to the
turbulence of the 1960s and the early 19705. That era saw
America fight an unpopular war for unclear reasons in Viet
nam; it saw habitual ways of thinking challenged by the civil
rights movement, the women's movement and a youth
counterculture movement; and in the end it saw a
presidency collapse amid disillusioning scandal.
This reasoning makes sense when you recall that the last
notably conservative era in American history (the 19505) fol
lowed the back-to-back upheavals of the Depression and a
monumental war effort.
Times of national turbulence — like the '60s and '70s —
call into question tacidy accepted values and ways of think
ing. The air is suddenly filled with divergent points of view,
and in that atmosphere being certain of anything is difficult.
And being uncertain is uncomfortable. It makes people
long for something simple to believe in. I think that, in the
present trend toward conservatism, we can see America
groping for easy answers to hard questions.
Cognitive dissonance theory is the social science jargon
for this phenomenon. It posits that people have a limited
ability to absorb confusing or conflicting signals. When con
fronted with uncertainty, we rely on labels and frameworks
to sort the incoming information into neat categories.
In a complex, dynamic world, simple and static notions of
good and bad have great appeal. It's much easier to label
drugs as bad than to sort out the relevant questions about
paternalism, social harm and individual freedom. Similarly,
it is much simpler to call the Soviet Union an "evil empire"
than it is to understand what motivates it to do what it does.
And it's a lot easier to label homosexuality as wrong than to
try to wrap your mind around the idea and see it from a gay
person's perspective.
By now somebody should be asking: If that's what conser
vatism means — i.e., circling the wagons around a com
fortable, non-threatening world view — then isn't there a
danger that intellectual freedom will suffer?
One last example may help answer that:
In September, a Wall Street Journal editorial criticized
Harvard's liberal faculty for being "out of touch with the
politics and culture of the rest of the country." Mainly, the
Journal was upset that Harvard refused to give Reagan an
honorary degree. In the course of the editorial, the paper
reproached Harvard for not embracing the Reagan Revolu
tion and supply side economics and for teaching Marx (of
all people) among the classics of Western thought.
When conservatives — and you can't get much more con
servative than the Journal's editorial page — feel free to
upbraid the country's most learned men and women for not
docilely falling into line with prevailing politics, then I think
we should be very concerned how freedom of thought will
fare in the coming conservative era.
