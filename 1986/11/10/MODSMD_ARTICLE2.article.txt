# Card bowls over UCLA
## SPORTS 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
PASADENA — UCLA ball, fourth-and-one, at the
Stanford 19-yard line. The Bruins trail by five
points with 2:15 to play. A first down keeps the
drive alive and, with it, UCLA's Rose Bowl hopes.
Tailback Gaston Green, who rushed for 142
yards, gets the call on a sweep left that has worked
all day. But not now. Strong safety Brad
Humphreys comes up to make the first hit on
Green in the backfield, and Lester Archambeau,
Darron Bennett and Alan Grant finish off the
quarry.
Then the unforgettable images of Saturday's 28-
23 Stanford victory: players and coaches jumping
into each other's arms, arms raised into the air, un
intelligible shouts laden with emotion.
It wasn't enitrely over yet, but when fullback
Brian Morris took a third-down sucker-pitch play
12 yards for Stanford's final first down, it was time,
to play "All Right Now" — if the Band had been
there.
When the final seconds on the Rose Bowl clock
were counted down and most of the 68,857 here
headed for the exit, the players ran over to the
Stanford section, where a couple of thousand stu
dents and alumni showed their appreciation for
the biggest Stanford win of this decade. And when
they reached the visitor's locker r<x>m, a chant
came from within: "We're going bowling!''
"That was the greatest feeling I've ever had in my
life,'' outside linebacker Chris Weber said of the
Bruins last play. "I was running around the field —
I didn't want to come off. I don't think anyone
guessed sweep. They only needed a yard, so every

one surged up. There were four or five guys ready
to put a hat on him."
"Brad came up and made the best hit of the
game and knocked Green back five yards," corner
back Toi Cook said. "Then our defense swarmed
him. That was a good picture of how we like to
play."
"Dave Wyman took charge out there," defensive
tackle Tony Leiker said. "He said we let them score
against Washington, and we talked about
should've, would've, could've. Let's not have any of
that crap, let's just do it. And we did it."
Morris' third-down run looked like an option,
but really wasn't. "They came down hard, expect
ing the run," quarterback John Paye said. "We
spread the defense with three wide receivers. We
suckered the man with the option look — the end
closed on me, so I pitched it."
There was a moment of doubt, though, as the
Cardinal tried to go through the motions of run
ning the clock out following Morris' first down. As
the stadium waited for Paye to take the snap and
touch a knee, the ball popped skyward and into a
pair of UCIA hands. As the Stanford side held its
collective breath, a flag was picked up, and the ref
eree announced a snap violation against UCLA.
"The nose guard had a hand in there to slap the
ball," center Andy Sinclair said. "He slapped it just
before I snapped it. After the play was blown dead,
I went to the referee to tell him what happened,
but he knew."
As it raised its record to 7-2, the Cardinal also
assured itself that its season won't end Nov. 29
against Arizona. While Arizona State clinched its
first Rose Bowl berth a few hours later with a 49-0
embarrassment of California, the Cardinal put itself

in a serious position to finish second in the Pacific
10 Conference. And a bid to the Fiesta or Citrus
Bowl on New Year's Day remains a definite possi
bility.
With Stanford's next game in two weeks at pitiful
1-8 Cal, it would tike a complete disaster to deny
the Cardinal an 8-2 record when the bowl invita
tions are mailed out. And a win in the regular
season finale against Arizona in Tokyo would give
Stanford a 9-2 record for the first time since the
Rose Bowl year of 1951.
Representatives for eight bowl games were in at
tendance, and it seems certain that one of them
will be soon making an offer the Cardinal cannot
refuse. "The big thing is that the players want to go
to a bowl game," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"There are players who've been here five years
who haven't been to a bowl game." In fact, it has
been eight years since the Cardinal last played in
the postseason.
In just three years, Elway has turned a program
that seemed mired in misery after a 1-10 season
into one that is nationally ranked. "I didn't know
what the timetable was going to be," Elway said.
"We just went out and recruited hard."
The victory was also Stanford's first this year
over a nationally ranked team. The Cardinal lost
earlier games to Washington, 24-14, and USC, 10-0.
"I think we proved ourselves," Sinclair said.
"Against Washington and 'SC, we lost the big game.
This week we were determined not to come out on
the short end."
Once again, it was a man named Brad Muster
who carried the offensive workload Saturday. Re-

day. The defense held UCLA on a fourth-and-one at the Stanford 19-yard
line with 2:15 left in the game to pave the way to victory.
