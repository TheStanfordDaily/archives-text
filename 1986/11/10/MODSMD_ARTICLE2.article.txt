# Card bowls over UCLA
## SPORTS 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
PASADENA — UCLA ball, fourth-and-one, at the
Stanford 19-yard line. The Bruins trail by five
points with 2:15 to play. A first down keeps the
drive alive and, with it, UCLA's Rose Bowl hopes.
Tailback Gaston Green, who rushed for 142
yards, gets the call on a sweep left that has worked
all day. But not now. Strong safety Brad
Humphreys comes up to make the first hit on
Green in the backfield, and Lester Archambeau,
Darron Bennett and Alan Grant finish off the
quarry.
Then the unforgettable images of Saturday's 28-
23 Stanford victory: players and coaches jumping
into each other's arms, arms raised into the air, un
intelligible shouts laden with emotion.
It wasn't enitrely over yet, but when fullback
Brian Morris took a third-down sucker-pitch play
12 yards for Stanford's final first down, it was time,
to play "All Right Now" — if the Band had been
there.
When the final seconds on the Rose Bowl clock
were counted down and most of the 68,857 here
headed for the exit, the players ran over to the
Stanford section, where a couple of thousand stu
dents and alumni showed their appreciation for
the biggest Stanford win of this decade. And when
they reached the visitor's locker r<x>m, a chant
came from within: "We're going bowling!''
"That was the greatest feeling I've ever had in my
life,'' outside linebacker Chris Weber said of the
Bruins last play. "I was running around the field —
I didn't want to come off. I don't think anyone
guessed sweep. They only needed a yard, so every

one surged up. There were four or five guys ready
to put a hat on him."
"Brad came up and made the best hit of the
game and knocked Green back five yards," corner
back Toi Cook said. "Then our defense swarmed
him. That was a good picture of how we like to
play."
"Dave Wyman took charge out there," defensive
tackle Tony Leiker said. "He said we let them score
against Washington, and we talked about
should've, would've, could've. Let's not have any of
that crap, let's just do it. And we did it."
Morris' third-down run looked like an option,
but really wasn't. "They came down hard, expect
ing the run," quarterback John Paye said. "We
spread the defense with three wide receivers. We
suckered the man with the option look — the end
closed on me, so I pitched it."
There was a moment of doubt, though, as the
Cardinal tried to go through the motions of run
ning the clock out following Morris' first down. As
the stadium waited for Paye to take the snap and
touch a knee, the ball popped skyward and into a
pair of UCIA hands. As the Stanford side held its
collective breath, a flag was picked up, and the ref
eree announced a snap violation against UCLA.
"The nose guard had a hand in there to slap the
ball," center Andy Sinclair said. "He slapped it just
before I snapped it. After the play was blown dead,
I went to the referee to tell him what happened,
but he knew."
As it raised its record to 7-2, the Cardinal also
assured itself that its season won't end Nov. 29
against Arizona. While Arizona State clinched its
first Rose Bowl berth a few hours later with a 49-0
embarrassment of California, the Cardinal put itself

in a serious position to finish second in the Pacific
10 Conference. And a bid to the Fiesta or Citrus
Bowl on New Year's Day remains a definite possi
bility.
With Stanford's next game in two weeks at pitiful
1-8 Cal, it would tike a complete disaster to deny
the Cardinal an 8-2 record when the bowl invita
tions are mailed out. And a win in the regular
season finale against Arizona in Tokyo would give
Stanford a 9-2 record for the first time since the
Rose Bowl year of 1951.
Representatives for eight bowl games were in at
tendance, and it seems certain that one of them
will be soon making an offer the Cardinal cannot
refuse. "The big thing is that the players want to go
to a bowl game," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"There are players who've been here five years
who haven't been to a bowl game." In fact, it has
been eight years since the Cardinal last played in
the postseason.
In just three years, Elway has turned a program
that seemed mired in misery after a 1-10 season
into one that is nationally ranked. "I didn't know
what the timetable was going to be," Elway said.
"We just went out and recruited hard."
The victory was also Stanford's first this year
over a nationally ranked team. The Cardinal lost
earlier games to Washington, 24-14, and USC, 10-0.
"I think we proved ourselves," Sinclair said.
"Against Washington and 'SC, we lost the big game.
This week we were determined not to come out on
the short end."
Once again, it was a man named Brad Muster
who carried the offensive workload Saturday. Re-

day. The defense held UCLA on a fourth-and-one at the Stanford 19-yard
line with 2:15 left in the game to pave the way to victory.

turning to the stadium where two years before he had
emerged from obscurity as a third-string fullback to rush for
82 yards in a 23-21 upset victory, the All-American-boy
become-All American-back broke his week-old school record
with 38 carries, piling up 183 yards and two touchdowns.
"It gets a little tiring after a while," said Muster, who last
week carried 37 times for 190 yards against Washington
State, but Ive got a week off to rest." Stanford is idle this
week.
With Brad Muster, it doesn't take much of a block to
spring him, said tackle Kurt Josephson, who led the way for
Muster much of the time. You just get man-on-man, and
block him. You don't even have to blow him off the line —
just control him at the line and Brad's a gcx)d enough run
ner that he can cut off that."
Muster also had the best run of his career in the first quar
ter to set up Stanford's second touchdown, taking a handoff
left, breaking into the secondary and not stopping until 74
yards later at the IJCIA 15. Two plays later, tight end Kric
Snelson grabbed a Paye pass over the middle and the Card
inal led 14-0.

"That was a strong-side left play," Muster said. "I cut it
back inside, and two of the defensive backs didn't wrap up.
(Guard) Tommy Nye had a great block, double-teaming
on the nose."
"We just came off the ball hard and sustained the blocks
up front," Sinclair said. "We knew we had to play a great
game, and we did. We just tried to double-team the
frontside, spread out the linebackers and cut them off."
That score followed one off the opening drive, when Paye
hit wide receiver Jeff James on an in-and-out pattern on the
right side from 15 yards out. That drive was prolonged
when the Bruins were called for defensive holding before a
punt at the Stanford 38.
"That's the personality of our offense to score quick,"
Paye said. "I think the first quarter has lx?en our most suc
cessful all year."
Muster's workhorse effort also took some pressure off
Paye. Having missed two days of practice early in the week

with a sore shoulder, Paye kept his passes short all game. He
finished by completing 17-of-22 passes for 147 yards and
two touchdowns, with a long effort of 16 yards.
Three of those passes were caught by wide receiver
Thomas Henley, playing for the first time against his brother
Darryl, a UCLA cornerback. "It was kind of awkward going
into the game," Thomas Henley said, "but as soon as you get
into the heat of the ballgame, you forget about all that. I feel
bad for him — no Rose Bowl — but he already has his Rose

Bowl and Fiesta Bowl rings. 1 want mine."
While the offense got the Cardinal out to a quick start, it
was the Vanilla Defense that held when needed, and in fact
set up what proved to be the margin of victory.
With 4:27 left in the third quarter and Stanford's lead cut
to 21-16, Weber flushed UCLA quarterback Matt Stevens
from the pocket. Stevens hurried his throw, sending it way

Stanford running back Brad Muster broke his own record with 38 carries in Saturday's 28-23 win over UCLA. The
junior from Novato broke Ernie Nevers* 1925 single-game mark of 34, set in the Rose Bowl against Notre Dame,
carrying the ball 37 times in the Washinton State contest. Muster picked up a total of 183 yard on the ground and
rushed for two touchdowns against UCLA.
over the head of wide receiver Karl
Dorrell and into the arms of corner
back Toi Cook, who returned it 21
yards to the UCLA 9. It was Cook's sixth
interception of the season and the only
turnover of a well-played game.
"I got a hand on him," Weber said.
"He got away, but Lester (Archambeau)
was about to finish him off, and he let it
fly."
Muster got the call three more times
and scored from four yards out.
The Bruins moved within five with
7:03 to play when Green swept left for
two yards and the touchdown, capping
a 12-play, 57-yard drive. They got one
more possession when Stanford was
stopped with 4:52 to play, taking over
at their own 32.
A few plays later, Green broke a 29-
yarder to the outside before being
brought down by Walt Harris at the
Stanford 28. On third-and-three from
the 21, fullback Marcus Greenwood
could only pick up two yards up the
middle, setting up Green's critical
fourth-down carry. And the defense
held, as it has all year.
Roses are red, UCLA is blue. And
Stanford is going bowling.

PASADENA — UCLA ball, fourth-and-one, at the
Stanford 19-yard line. The Bruins trail by five
points with 2:15 to play. A first down keeps the
drive alive and, with it, UCLA's Rose Bowl hopes.
Tailback Gaston Green, who rushed for 142
yards, gets the call on a sweep left that has worked
all day. But not now. Strong safety Brad
Humphreys comes up to make the first hit on
Green in the backfield, and Lester Archambeau,
Darron Bennett and Alan Grant finish off the
quarry.
Then the unforgettable images of Saturday's 28-
23 Stanford victory: players and coaches jumping
into each other's arms, arms raised into the air, un
intelligible shouts laden with emotion.
It wasn't enitrely over yet, but when fullback
Brian Morris took a third-down sucker-pitch play
12 yards for Stanford's final first down, it was time,
to play "All Right Now" — if the Band had been
there.
When the final seconds on the Rose Bowl clock
were counted down and most of the 68,857 here
headed for the exit, the players ran over to the
Stanford section, where a couple of thousand stu
dents and alumni showed their appreciation for
the biggest Stanford win of this decade. And when
they reached the visitor's locker r<x>m, a chant
came from within: "We're going bowling!''
"That was the greatest feeling I've ever had in my
life,'' outside linebacker Chris Weber said of the
Bruins last play. "I was running around the field —
I didn't want to come off. I don't think anyone
guessed sweep. They only needed a yard, so every

one surged up. There were four or five guys ready
to put a hat on him."
"Brad came up and made the best hit of the
game and knocked Green back five yards," corner
back Toi Cook said. "Then our defense swarmed
him. That was a good picture of how we like to
play."
"Dave Wyman took charge out there," defensive
tackle Tony Leiker said. "He said we let them score
against Washington, and we talked about
should've, would've, could've. Let's not have any of
that crap, let's just do it. And we did it."
Morris' third-down run looked like an option,
but really wasn't. "They came down hard, expect
ing the run," quarterback John Paye said. "We
spread the defense with three wide receivers. We
suckered the man with the option look — the end
closed on me, so I pitched it."
There was a moment of doubt, though, as the
Cardinal tried to go through the motions of run
ning the clock out following Morris' first down. As
the stadium waited for Paye to take the snap and
touch a knee, the ball popped skyward and into a
pair of UCIA hands. As the Stanford side held its
collective breath, a flag was picked up, and the ref
eree announced a snap violation against UCLA.
"The nose guard had a hand in there to slap the
ball," center Andy Sinclair said. "He slapped it just
before I snapped it. After the play was blown dead,
I went to the referee to tell him what happened,
but he knew."
As it raised its record to 7-2, the Cardinal also
assured itself that its season won't end Nov. 29
against Arizona. While Arizona State clinched its
first Rose Bowl berth a few hours later with a 49-0
embarrassment of California, the Cardinal put itself

in a serious position to finish second in the Pacific
10 Conference. And a bid to the Fiesta or Citrus
Bowl on New Year's Day remains a definite possi
bility.
With Stanford's next game in two weeks at pitiful
1-8 Cal, it would tike a complete disaster to deny
the Cardinal an 8-2 record when the bowl invita
tions are mailed out. And a win in the regular
season finale against Arizona in Tokyo would give
Stanford a 9-2 record for the first time since the
Rose Bowl year of 1951.
Representatives for eight bowl games were in at
tendance, and it seems certain that one of them
will be soon making an offer the Cardinal cannot
refuse. "The big thing is that the players want to go
to a bowl game," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"There are players who've been here five years
who haven't been to a bowl game." In fact, it has
been eight years since the Cardinal last played in
the postseason.
In just three years, Elway has turned a program
that seemed mired in misery after a 1-10 season
into one that is nationally ranked. "I didn't know
what the timetable was going to be," Elway said.
"We just went out and recruited hard."
The victory was also Stanford's first this year
over a nationally ranked team. The Cardinal lost
earlier games to Washington, 24-14, and USC, 10-0.
"I think we proved ourselves," Sinclair said.
"Against Washington and 'SC, we lost the big game.
This week we were determined not to come out on
the short end."
Once again, it was a man named Brad Muster
who carried the offensive workload Saturday. Re-

day. The defense held UCLA on a fourth-and-one at the Stanford 19-yard
line with 2:15 left in the game to pave the way to victory.

turning to the stadium where two years before he had
emerged from obscurity as a third-string fullback to rush for
82 yards in a 23-21 upset victory, the All-American-boy
become-All American-back broke his week-old school record
with 38 carries, piling up 183 yards and two touchdowns.
"It gets a little tiring after a while," said Muster, who last
week carried 37 times for 190 yards against Washington
State, but Ive got a week off to rest." Stanford is idle this
week.
With Brad Muster, it doesn't take much of a block to
spring him, said tackle Kurt Josephson, who led the way for
Muster much of the time. You just get man-on-man, and
block him. You don't even have to blow him off the line —
just control him at the line and Brad's a gcx)d enough run
ner that he can cut off that."
Muster also had the best run of his career in the first quar
ter to set up Stanford's second touchdown, taking a handoff
left, breaking into the secondary and not stopping until 74
yards later at the IJCIA 15. Two plays later, tight end Kric
Snelson grabbed a Paye pass over the middle and the Card
inal led 14-0.

"That was a strong-side left play," Muster said. "I cut it
back inside, and two of the defensive backs didn't wrap up.
(Guard) Tommy Nye had a great block, double-teaming
on the nose."
"We just came off the ball hard and sustained the blocks
up front," Sinclair said. "We knew we had to play a great
game, and we did. We just tried to double-team the
frontside, spread out the linebackers and cut them off."
That score followed one off the opening drive, when Paye
hit wide receiver Jeff James on an in-and-out pattern on the
right side from 15 yards out. That drive was prolonged
when the Bruins were called for defensive holding before a
punt at the Stanford 38.
"That's the personality of our offense to score quick,"
Paye said. "I think the first quarter has lx?en our most suc
cessful all year."
Muster's workhorse effort also took some pressure off
Paye. Having missed two days of practice early in the week

with a sore shoulder, Paye kept his passes short all game. He
finished by completing 17-of-22 passes for 147 yards and
two touchdowns, with a long effort of 16 yards.
Three of those passes were caught by wide receiver
Thomas Henley, playing for the first time against his brother
Darryl, a UCLA cornerback. "It was kind of awkward going
into the game," Thomas Henley said, "but as soon as you get
into the heat of the ballgame, you forget about all that. I feel
bad for him — no Rose Bowl — but he already has his Rose

Bowl and Fiesta Bowl rings. 1 want mine."
While the offense got the Cardinal out to a quick start, it
was the Vanilla Defense that held when needed, and in fact
set up what proved to be the margin of victory.
With 4:27 left in the third quarter and Stanford's lead cut
to 21-16, Weber flushed UCLA quarterback Matt Stevens
from the pocket. Stevens hurried his throw, sending it way

Stanford running back Brad Muster broke his own record with 38 carries in Saturday's 28-23 win over UCLA. The
junior from Novato broke Ernie Nevers* 1925 single-game mark of 34, set in the Rose Bowl against Notre Dame,
carrying the ball 37 times in the Washinton State contest. Muster picked up a total of 183 yard on the ground and
rushed for two touchdowns against UCLA.
over the head of wide receiver Karl
Dorrell and into the arms of corner
back Toi Cook, who returned it 21
yards to the UCLA 9. It was Cook's sixth
interception of the season and the only
turnover of a well-played game.
"I got a hand on him," Weber said.
"He got away, but Lester (Archambeau)
was about to finish him off, and he let it
fly."
Muster got the call three more times
and scored from four yards out.
The Bruins moved within five with
7:03 to play when Green swept left for
two yards and the touchdown, capping
a 12-play, 57-yard drive. They got one
more possession when Stanford was
stopped with 4:52 to play, taking over
at their own 32.
A few plays later, Green broke a 29-
yarder to the outside before being
brought down by Walt Harris at the
Stanford 28. On third-and-three from
the 21, fullback Marcus Greenwood
could only pick up two yards up the
middle, setting up Green's critical
fourth-down carry. And the defense
held, as it has all year.
Roses are red, UCLA is blue. And
Stanford is going bowling.

PASADENA — UCLA ball, fourth-and-one, at the
Stanford 19-yard line. The Bruins trail by five
points with 2:15 to play. A first down keeps the
drive alive and, with it, UCLA's Rose Bowl hopes.
Tailback Gaston Green, who rushed for 142
yards, gets the call on a sweep left that has worked
all day. But not now. Strong safety Brad
Humphreys comes up to make the first hit on
Green in the backfield, and Lester Archambeau,
Darron Bennett and Alan Grant finish off the
quarry.
Then the unforgettable images of Saturday's 28-
23 Stanford victory: players and coaches jumping
into each other's arms, arms raised into the air, un
intelligible shouts laden with emotion.
It wasn't enitrely over yet, but when fullback
Brian Morris took a third-down sucker-pitch play
12 yards for Stanford's final first down, it was time,
to play "All Right Now" — if the Band had been
there.
When the final seconds on the Rose Bowl clock
were counted down and most of the 68,857 here
headed for the exit, the players ran over to the
Stanford section, where a couple of thousand stu
dents and alumni showed their appreciation for
the biggest Stanford win of this decade. And when
they reached the visitor's locker r<x>m, a chant
came from within: "We're going bowling!''
"That was the greatest feeling I've ever had in my
life,'' outside linebacker Chris Weber said of the
Bruins last play. "I was running around the field —
I didn't want to come off. I don't think anyone
guessed sweep. They only needed a yard, so every

one surged up. There were four or five guys ready
to put a hat on him."
"Brad came up and made the best hit of the
game and knocked Green back five yards," corner
back Toi Cook said. "Then our defense swarmed
him. That was a good picture of how we like to
play."
"Dave Wyman took charge out there," defensive
tackle Tony Leiker said. "He said we let them score
against Washington, and we talked about
should've, would've, could've. Let's not have any of
that crap, let's just do it. And we did it."
Morris' third-down run looked like an option,
but really wasn't. "They came down hard, expect
ing the run," quarterback John Paye said. "We
spread the defense with three wide receivers. We
suckered the man with the option look — the end
closed on me, so I pitched it."
There was a moment of doubt, though, as the
Cardinal tried to go through the motions of run
ning the clock out following Morris' first down. As
the stadium waited for Paye to take the snap and
touch a knee, the ball popped skyward and into a
pair of UCIA hands. As the Stanford side held its
collective breath, a flag was picked up, and the ref
eree announced a snap violation against UCLA.
"The nose guard had a hand in there to slap the
ball," center Andy Sinclair said. "He slapped it just
before I snapped it. After the play was blown dead,
I went to the referee to tell him what happened,
but he knew."
As it raised its record to 7-2, the Cardinal also
assured itself that its season won't end Nov. 29
against Arizona. While Arizona State clinched its
first Rose Bowl berth a few hours later with a 49-0
embarrassment of California, the Cardinal put itself

in a serious position to finish second in the Pacific
10 Conference. And a bid to the Fiesta or Citrus
Bowl on New Year's Day remains a definite possi
bility.
With Stanford's next game in two weeks at pitiful
1-8 Cal, it would tike a complete disaster to deny
the Cardinal an 8-2 record when the bowl invita
tions are mailed out. And a win in the regular
season finale against Arizona in Tokyo would give
Stanford a 9-2 record for the first time since the
Rose Bowl year of 1951.
Representatives for eight bowl games were in at
tendance, and it seems certain that one of them
will be soon making an offer the Cardinal cannot
refuse. "The big thing is that the players want to go
to a bowl game," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"There are players who've been here five years
who haven't been to a bowl game." In fact, it has
been eight years since the Cardinal last played in
the postseason.
In just three years, Elway has turned a program
that seemed mired in misery after a 1-10 season
into one that is nationally ranked. "I didn't know
what the timetable was going to be," Elway said.
"We just went out and recruited hard."
The victory was also Stanford's first this year
over a nationally ranked team. The Cardinal lost
earlier games to Washington, 24-14, and USC, 10-0.
"I think we proved ourselves," Sinclair said.
"Against Washington and 'SC, we lost the big game.
This week we were determined not to come out on
the short end."
Once again, it was a man named Brad Muster
who carried the offensive workload Saturday. Re-

day. The defense held UCLA on a fourth-and-one at the Stanford 19-yard
line with 2:15 left in the game to pave the way to victory.

turning to the stadium where two years before he had
emerged from obscurity as a third-string fullback to rush for
82 yards in a 23-21 upset victory, the All-American-boy
become-All American-back broke his week-old school record
with 38 carries, piling up 183 yards and two touchdowns.
"It gets a little tiring after a while," said Muster, who last
week carried 37 times for 190 yards against Washington
State, but Ive got a week off to rest." Stanford is idle this
week.
With Brad Muster, it doesn't take much of a block to
spring him, said tackle Kurt Josephson, who led the way for
Muster much of the time. You just get man-on-man, and
block him. You don't even have to blow him off the line —
just control him at the line and Brad's a gcx)d enough run
ner that he can cut off that."
Muster also had the best run of his career in the first quar
ter to set up Stanford's second touchdown, taking a handoff
left, breaking into the secondary and not stopping until 74
yards later at the IJCIA 15. Two plays later, tight end Kric
Snelson grabbed a Paye pass over the middle and the Card
inal led 14-0.

"That was a strong-side left play," Muster said. "I cut it
back inside, and two of the defensive backs didn't wrap up.
(Guard) Tommy Nye had a great block, double-teaming
on the nose."
"We just came off the ball hard and sustained the blocks
up front," Sinclair said. "We knew we had to play a great
game, and we did. We just tried to double-team the
frontside, spread out the linebackers and cut them off."
That score followed one off the opening drive, when Paye
hit wide receiver Jeff James on an in-and-out pattern on the
right side from 15 yards out. That drive was prolonged
when the Bruins were called for defensive holding before a
punt at the Stanford 38.
"That's the personality of our offense to score quick,"
Paye said. "I think the first quarter has lx?en our most suc
cessful all year."
Muster's workhorse effort also took some pressure off
Paye. Having missed two days of practice early in the week

with a sore shoulder, Paye kept his passes short all game. He
finished by completing 17-of-22 passes for 147 yards and
two touchdowns, with a long effort of 16 yards.
Three of those passes were caught by wide receiver
Thomas Henley, playing for the first time against his brother
Darryl, a UCLA cornerback. "It was kind of awkward going
into the game," Thomas Henley said, "but as soon as you get
into the heat of the ballgame, you forget about all that. I feel
bad for him — no Rose Bowl — but he already has his Rose

Bowl and Fiesta Bowl rings. 1 want mine."
While the offense got the Cardinal out to a quick start, it
was the Vanilla Defense that held when needed, and in fact
set up what proved to be the margin of victory.
With 4:27 left in the third quarter and Stanford's lead cut
to 21-16, Weber flushed UCLA quarterback Matt Stevens
from the pocket. Stevens hurried his throw, sending it way

Stanford running back Brad Muster broke his own record with 38 carries in Saturday's 28-23 win over UCLA. The
junior from Novato broke Ernie Nevers* 1925 single-game mark of 34, set in the Rose Bowl against Notre Dame,
carrying the ball 37 times in the Washinton State contest. Muster picked up a total of 183 yard on the ground and
rushed for two touchdowns against UCLA.
over the head of wide receiver Karl
Dorrell and into the arms of corner
back Toi Cook, who returned it 21
yards to the UCLA 9. It was Cook's sixth
interception of the season and the only
turnover of a well-played game.
"I got a hand on him," Weber said.
"He got away, but Lester (Archambeau)
was about to finish him off, and he let it
fly."
Muster got the call three more times
and scored from four yards out.
The Bruins moved within five with
7:03 to play when Green swept left for
two yards and the touchdown, capping
a 12-play, 57-yard drive. They got one
more possession when Stanford was
stopped with 4:52 to play, taking over
at their own 32.
A few plays later, Green broke a 29-
yarder to the outside before being
brought down by Walt Harris at the
Stanford 28. On third-and-three from
the 21, fullback Marcus Greenwood
could only pick up two yards up the
middle, setting up Green's critical
fourth-down carry. And the defense
held, as it has all year.
Roses are red, UCLA is blue. And
Stanford is going bowling.

PASADENA — UCLA ball, fourth-and-one, at the
Stanford 19-yard line. The Bruins trail by five
points with 2:15 to play. A first down keeps the
drive alive and, with it, UCLA's Rose Bowl hopes.
Tailback Gaston Green, who rushed for 142
yards, gets the call on a sweep left that has worked
all day. But not now. Strong safety Brad
Humphreys comes up to make the first hit on
Green in the backfield, and Lester Archambeau,
Darron Bennett and Alan Grant finish off the
quarry.
Then the unforgettable images of Saturday's 28-
23 Stanford victory: players and coaches jumping
into each other's arms, arms raised into the air, un
intelligible shouts laden with emotion.
It wasn't enitrely over yet, but when fullback
Brian Morris took a third-down sucker-pitch play
12 yards for Stanford's final first down, it was time,
to play "All Right Now" — if the Band had been
there.
When the final seconds on the Rose Bowl clock
were counted down and most of the 68,857 here
headed for the exit, the players ran over to the
Stanford section, where a couple of thousand stu
dents and alumni showed their appreciation for
the biggest Stanford win of this decade. And when
they reached the visitor's locker r<x>m, a chant
came from within: "We're going bowling!''
"That was the greatest feeling I've ever had in my
life,'' outside linebacker Chris Weber said of the
Bruins last play. "I was running around the field —
I didn't want to come off. I don't think anyone
guessed sweep. They only needed a yard, so every

one surged up. There were four or five guys ready
to put a hat on him."
"Brad came up and made the best hit of the
game and knocked Green back five yards," corner
back Toi Cook said. "Then our defense swarmed
him. That was a good picture of how we like to
play."
"Dave Wyman took charge out there," defensive
tackle Tony Leiker said. "He said we let them score
against Washington, and we talked about
should've, would've, could've. Let's not have any of
that crap, let's just do it. And we did it."
Morris' third-down run looked like an option,
but really wasn't. "They came down hard, expect
ing the run," quarterback John Paye said. "We
spread the defense with three wide receivers. We
suckered the man with the option look — the end
closed on me, so I pitched it."
There was a moment of doubt, though, as the
Cardinal tried to go through the motions of run
ning the clock out following Morris' first down. As
the stadium waited for Paye to take the snap and
touch a knee, the ball popped skyward and into a
pair of UCIA hands. As the Stanford side held its
collective breath, a flag was picked up, and the ref
eree announced a snap violation against UCLA.
"The nose guard had a hand in there to slap the
ball," center Andy Sinclair said. "He slapped it just
before I snapped it. After the play was blown dead,
I went to the referee to tell him what happened,
but he knew."
As it raised its record to 7-2, the Cardinal also
assured itself that its season won't end Nov. 29
against Arizona. While Arizona State clinched its
first Rose Bowl berth a few hours later with a 49-0
embarrassment of California, the Cardinal put itself

in a serious position to finish second in the Pacific
10 Conference. And a bid to the Fiesta or Citrus
Bowl on New Year's Day remains a definite possi
bility.
With Stanford's next game in two weeks at pitiful
1-8 Cal, it would tike a complete disaster to deny
the Cardinal an 8-2 record when the bowl invita
tions are mailed out. And a win in the regular
season finale against Arizona in Tokyo would give
Stanford a 9-2 record for the first time since the
Rose Bowl year of 1951.
Representatives for eight bowl games were in at
tendance, and it seems certain that one of them
will be soon making an offer the Cardinal cannot
refuse. "The big thing is that the players want to go
to a bowl game," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"There are players who've been here five years
who haven't been to a bowl game." In fact, it has
been eight years since the Cardinal last played in
the postseason.
In just three years, Elway has turned a program
that seemed mired in misery after a 1-10 season
into one that is nationally ranked. "I didn't know
what the timetable was going to be," Elway said.
"We just went out and recruited hard."
The victory was also Stanford's first this year
over a nationally ranked team. The Cardinal lost
earlier games to Washington, 24-14, and USC, 10-0.
"I think we proved ourselves," Sinclair said.
"Against Washington and 'SC, we lost the big game.
This week we were determined not to come out on
the short end."
Once again, it was a man named Brad Muster
who carried the offensive workload Saturday. Re-

day. The defense held UCLA on a fourth-and-one at the Stanford 19-yard
line with 2:15 left in the game to pave the way to victory.

Linebacker Kevin Richardson (46) and noseguard Buck Roggeman (66)

turning to the stadium where two years before he had
emerged from obscurity as a third-string fullback to rush for
82 yards in a 23-21 upset victory, the All-American-boy
become-All American-back broke his week-old school record
with 38 carries, piling up 183 yards and two touchdowns.
"It gets a little tiring after a while," said Muster, who last
week carried 37 times for 190 yards against Washington
State, but Ive got a week off to rest." Stanford is idle this
week.
With Brad Muster, it doesn't take much of a block to
spring him, said tackle Kurt Josephson, who led the way for
Muster much of the time. You just get man-on-man, and
block him. You don't even have to blow him off the line —
just control him at the line and Brad's a gcx)d enough run
ner that he can cut off that."
Muster also had the best run of his career in the first quar
ter to set up Stanford's second touchdown, taking a handoff
left, breaking into the secondary and not stopping until 74
yards later at the IJCIA 15. Two plays later, tight end Kric
Snelson grabbed a Paye pass over the middle and the Card
inal led 14-0.

"That was a strong-side left play," Muster said. "I cut it
back inside, and two of the defensive backs didn't wrap up.
(Guard) Tommy Nye had a great block, double-teaming
on the nose."
"We just came off the ball hard and sustained the blocks
up front," Sinclair said. "We knew we had to play a great
game, and we did. We just tried to double-team the
frontside, spread out the linebackers and cut them off."
That score followed one off the opening drive, when Paye
hit wide receiver Jeff James on an in-and-out pattern on the
right side from 15 yards out. That drive was prolonged
when the Bruins were called for defensive holding before a
punt at the Stanford 38.
"That's the personality of our offense to score quick,"
Paye said. "I think the first quarter has lx?en our most suc
cessful all year."
Muster's workhorse effort also took some pressure off
Paye. Having missed two days of practice early in the week

with a sore shoulder, Paye kept his passes short all game. He
finished by completing 17-of-22 passes for 147 yards and
two touchdowns, with a long effort of 16 yards.
Three of those passes were caught by wide receiver
Thomas Henley, playing for the first time against his brother
Darryl, a UCLA cornerback. "It was kind of awkward going
into the game," Thomas Henley said, "but as soon as you get
into the heat of the ballgame, you forget about all that. I feel
bad for him — no Rose Bowl — but he already has his Rose

Bowl and Fiesta Bowl rings. 1 want mine."
While the offense got the Cardinal out to a quick start, it
was the Vanilla Defense that held when needed, and in fact
set up what proved to be the margin of victory.
With 4:27 left in the third quarter and Stanford's lead cut
to 21-16, Weber flushed UCLA quarterback Matt Stevens
from the pocket. Stevens hurried his throw, sending it way

Stanford running back Brad Muster broke his own record with 38 carries in Saturday's 28-23 win over UCLA. The
junior from Novato broke Ernie Nevers* 1925 single-game mark of 34, set in the Rose Bowl against Notre Dame,
carrying the ball 37 times in the Washinton State contest. Muster picked up a total of 183 yard on the ground and
rushed for two touchdowns against UCLA.
over the head of wide receiver Karl
Dorrell and into the arms of corner
back Toi Cook, who returned it 21
yards to the UCLA 9. It was Cook's sixth
interception of the season and the only
turnover of a well-played game.
"I got a hand on him," Weber said.
"He got away, but Lester (Archambeau)
was about to finish him off, and he let it
fly."
Muster got the call three more times
and scored from four yards out.
The Bruins moved within five with
7:03 to play when Green swept left for
two yards and the touchdown, capping
a 12-play, 57-yard drive. They got one
more possession when Stanford was
stopped with 4:52 to play, taking over
at their own 32.
A few plays later, Green broke a 29-
yarder to the outside before being
brought down by Walt Harris at the
Stanford 28. On third-and-three from
the 21, fullback Marcus Greenwood
could only pick up two yards up the
middle, setting up Green's critical
fourth-down carry. And the defense
held, as it has all year.
Roses are red, UCLA is blue. And
Stanford is going bowling.
