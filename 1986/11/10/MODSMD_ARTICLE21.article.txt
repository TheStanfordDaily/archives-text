## In Chinese or in English, dance is mother tongue

"You re a bird ... stretch like you're
flying!" exhorted Jiang Wei-Hao to 20
advanced Stanford ballet students.
"You must float away from the floor,"
he added. "Like you're flying."
Wei-Hao, director of the Central Bal
let of China and his wife Chen Qing
Mei, a principal dancer with the
Central Ballet, guest-taught the Ballet I
and Ballet 111 classes at Stanford last
Thursday. With the help of an inter
preter, a few words of English and
physical demonstration, the couple
gave the classes a taste of the univer
sality of the language of dance.
"It was amazing what Wei-Hao com
municated through physical contact,"
said Lisa Arkin, chairman of the Dance
Department at Stanford. "It just rein
forced for me the fact that dance is in
ternational â€” you don't need to talk."
It was a student -in Arkin's social
dance class who made contact with
Wei-Hao and Qing Mei and asked if
they could teach a day at Stanford. The
two were actually on their way back to
China, returning from Portland, Ore.,
where they were guest teachers and
choreographers at a performing arts

high school.
"This kind of cultural exchange is
not common," said Arkin. "It has only
just begun to happen between the
United States and China."
Arkin, who specializes in teaching

character dance at Stanford, found an
immediate common area of interest
with Wei-Hao who, coincidental ly, is
one of the leading Chinese teachers of
character, a style which includes
Polish, Italian, Flamenco and Gypsy

dance. A lot of character dance is also
influenced by Russian dance, as was
Wei-Hao's character style, according to
Arkin.
While exchanges with communist
and Soviet-bloc countries are not com

mon, the Dance Department lias an on
going series of guest teachers, lectur
ers and performances. The Washington
Ballet will teach to the Modern IV class
today, and Tim Wengard is scheduled
for Monday, Nov. 24.

"A lot of students don't know Stan
ford even offers ballet," said Arkin.
"With continued classes like Wei-Hao's
we hope to increase the campus
awareness of Stanford's unique dance
opportunities."
