# Club sports faced with financial support cuts
## 
### SEAN KINCH 
Club sports at Stanford will receive
less money from the University this
year due to cutbacks made by the Ath
letic Department, according to Shirley
Schoff, the director of club sports.
The decrease in club sports funding
was largely a result of the Athletic De
partment's decision to demote
women's softball from a varsity sport to
a club sport without a corresponding
increase in the club sports' budget,
SchofF said.
Additionally, last year's Club Sports
Council dipped heavily into their long
term reserves, and this year the council
is trying to get back on track.
The council, comprised of one pres
ident and seven representatives from
the various club sports, had to find a
way to organize itself financially and
still give the clubs enough money to
run their programs.
Each club appears before the coun
cil and presents its needs and
prospective income from fund raising

and dues, and then the council decides
how they can fund each club. Invari
ably, the budget for.each sport in
cludes a large percentage of fund rais
ing beyond the amount it originally
projects.

"The whole basis of the club sports
program is self-help," said Schoff.
"Fund raising has always been a part of
the program for a team to pay coaches,
travel and buy equipment."
Schoff said she believes now is the
time to re-evaluate the finances of the
club sports program and to cut the
excess expenditures.
"Many of the club sports did not
need all of the money we gave them
last year," said Schoff, explaining this

year's budget cuts. "So now we are
pulling in the reins and seeing if they
(the individual sports) can work with
that."
If the clubs are unable to survive,
Schoff added, there will be reserve
funds that could be used in emer
gencies.
Another change this year is in the
distribution of the money. In previous
years, the clubs have been given a
lump sum at the beginning of the year,
leaving no money for the Club Sports
Council to use in case of financial
problems in the spring.
To combat this problem, club sports
money will be paid in two installments:
one at the beginning of this month and
one next March. This policy will give
the council the ability to make altera
tions in the budget if the need arises.
"I think this is a good example to the
rest of the Athletic Department," said
Schoff, referring to the Athletic Depart
ment's current deficit problems,
which, she said, are due largely to
over-spending and unexpected ex
penses incurred by the department.
Women's softball was demoted from
a varsity sport because of the Athletic
Department's current financial prob
lems. By cutting softball and not com
pensating club sports for the additional
budget strain, the Athletic Department
saves itself the money it was putting
into the softball program.
The biggest loser as a result of the
decision is the women's softball pro
gram, which saw its $10,000 budget as
a varsity sport dwindle to $3,700 as a
club sport, according to Scott Bommer,
the Club Sports Council president. The
softball program had been offering

scholarships and had a coach on salary.
The softball program has been
dealing with the situation by doing its
own large-scale fund raising. The team
has done so well that it has not had to
ask the Club Sports Council for addi
tional funds.
"Softball has done an amazing job of
their own fund raising. They have not
burdened us at all," said Bommer.
"They have just worked their tails off."
When asked if there was an official
explanation for the Athletic Depart
ment's decision to place the financial
strain of softball on club sports without
adding to its overall budget, Bommer
could offer no answer.
"There was no official statement
(from the Athletic Department). We

are powerless in that regard, just like
Softball was powerless when they were
cut- from varsity sports," Bommer
conceded. "The University did to us
what they did to softball."
He said the effective cut in the club
sports budget could not be a result of
declining interest in those sports.
There are currently about 2,000 people
involved directly in one of Stanford's
29 club sports, and their overall
popularity is on the rise.
"There has been a general trend up
wards in club sports participation over
the last five years," Bommer noted.
"We would like to have increased the
budget to correspond with the in
creased participation, but we had to
compensate for last year's over
allocation."

In addition to the money club sports
receive from the Athletic Department,
they receive money from ASSU and
they do some fund raising as a group.
ASSU has increased its allocation to
club sports by $4,000 this year, and the
council is exploring other alternatives
to counteract its financial problems.
Bommer said the council hopes to
raise $3,000 by selling Christmas trees
with the Menlo Park Kiwanis Club this
winter, but he said they will have to
pursue other avenues as well.
"We need to investigate possibilities
for new funds. We will ask for another
increase from ASSU as well as from the
University," Bommer said. "We are
also looking into our own fund raising,
like printing some club sport T-shirts
and getting corporate sponsors."
