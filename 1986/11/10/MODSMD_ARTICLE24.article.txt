To speak now in this weary language,
language torn from its sleep in the
Bible: blinded,
it lurches from mouth to mouth. In a
language that described
miracles and God, to say now. car,
bomb, God.
Here in America, we've most of us
blessedly little experience of the dis
locations and relocations that mark
most of human history. Invasion, per
secution, emigration, resettlement, a
second landscape to learn, a second
language: These come to us, if at all, as
distant grandparental memories. Or
else we regard expatriation as a literary
fate a la Henry James, T.S. Eliot,
Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, voluntary
migrants who freely carried the
mother tongue along with them to
England, France, Italy.
It comes as a bracing reminder to
encounter someone like Yehuda Amic
hai, a poet saturated with the (old) new
landscape and language he was cast
into, yet ridden by memories, images
from another place and time. Born in
Wurzburg, Germany, in 1924 to an Or
thodox Jewish family, Amichai was
brought by his parents to Palestine in
1936 — early in the Third Reich, but
late enough.
He fought in World War II with the
British army, in the 1948 Israeli War of
Independence, in the Sinai campaign
of 1956 and the Yom Kippur War, all
the while teaching for a living, raising
two families, and writing.

The city where I was born was
destroyed by gunfire.
The ship that brought me here was
later sunk, in the war
The barn in Hamadiya where I made
love was burnt down,
the kiosk in Ein Gedi was blown up by
the enemy,
the bridge in Ismailiya that I crossed
back and forth on the ei>e of all my
loves
was torn to tatters.
My life is being blotted out behind me
according to a precise map
How much longer can those
memories hold out?
They killed the little girl from my
childhood and my father is dead
So don't ever choose me for a lover or
a son,
a tenant, a crosser of bridges, a citi
zen.
And this, from a sequence called
"Songs of Zion the Beautiful."
Amichai's verse cannot go for long
without wryness, irony and even
darker tones, but neither does it go
without a playful or awe-struck
eroticism, a reverence in handling the
grittiness of things, and a resilience
verging sometimes almost on op
. timism. Poetry, he has said, gives us a
kind of immunity to history, con
centrating the disease but also the
cure.
This new "Selected Poetry," ably and
often beautifully translated by Stephen
Mitchell and Chana Bloch, surveys for
the first time in English more than three
decades of writing that has made Amic
hai's the most widely read Hebrew
poetry since the Bible was translated.
Here is how an early poem begins:
God's hand is in the world

like my mother's hand in the guts of
the slaughtered chicken
on Sabbath eve
What does God see through the win
dow
while his hands reach into the world?
What does my mother see?
Throughout his writing, Amichai
feels no choice but to comingle his in
timations of divinity with the intimicies

Poetry gives us a
kind of immunity
to history, con
centrating the
disease but also the
cure.

of his own vulnerable life. Often the
limbs and skin and hair that crop up in
his love poems are written over with
verses from Judges or Job or Ec
clesiastes.
And here is an evocation of the city
sacred to three faiths:
All these stones, all this sorrow, all this
light, rubble of night hours and noon
dust,
all the twisted pipework of sanctity,
Wailing Wall, towers, rusty halos,
all the prophecies that — like old men
— couldn 't hold it in,
all the sweaty angels' wings,
all the stinking candles, all the pros
thetic tourism,
dung of deliverance, bliss-and-balls,

dregs oj nothingness, bomb and time.
All this dust, all these bones
in the process of resurrection and of
the wind,
all this love, all these,
stones, all this sorrow —
Go heap them into the valleys all
round
so Jerusalem will be level
for my sweet airplane
that will come and carry me up.
Here Amichai's language itself
wrestles the earthly city with the spiri
tual, as Ezekiel might have it. Prophecy
comes hard. But somehow those last
two lines in their childishness manage
to alleviate the pain of living in a dis
rupted city, where, another poem puts
it, all the signs are "in three languages:
Hebrew, Arabic, and death."
In every book of Amichai's, we feel
the tug of place and time, the tangled
bonds of a Diaspora people in a
"promised land." What are we doing
here? he asks. How do we belong? In
his rare political utterances a voice for
conciliation rather than domination,
Amichai nonetheless feels committed
ineradicably to the land of Israel:
Spilled blood is not the roots of trees,
but it's the closest to them
humankind can have.
This language, Hebrew, as in the
lines I began with, once "described
miracles and God." For many it still
does, but Amichai hears it saying "car,
bomb, God." He cannot, and really he
will not, quite reconcile the ancient
faith with the modern predicament.
Amichai will read from his works
Thursday at 4:15 in the English Depart
ment lounge, Building 300.
John Felstiner is Professor of English.


Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai, the most widely read Hebrew poet in transla
tion next to the writers of the Bible, will speak at Stanford Thursday. He is
expected to read his verse in both English and Hebrew.
