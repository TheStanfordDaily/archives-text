# Students and fans react to no Band on southern trip

PASADENA â€” After Stanford quarterback John Pave hit
Jeff James with a 15-yard touchdown pass less than five
minutes into the first quarter of the Cardinal's 28-23 win
over I'QA Saturday, the lyrics of "All Right Now drifted
softly from the Stanford student section at the Rose Bowl
But lyrics were all that drifted.
Stanford's unofficial theme song was performed a cap
pella because the Leland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band, which is usually on hand for the Cardinal s annual
Los Angeles road trip, was serving the first of its much
publicized two-game suspension.
If a group of Stanford followers at Saturday's game has its
way, however, the Band will be on the field hurling the ex
pected tasteless-but-enjoyable insults at lame-duck Califor
nia Coach Joe Kapp in Berkeley on Nov. 22.
When the Band's suspension was announced, seniors
Monica Lytle and Mike O'Neal, neither of whom is a Band
member, decided to launch a petition drive to get the
Band's field privileges reinstated for Big Game. By kickoff
on Saturday they had collected approximately 300
signatures, and by the end of the game that number had
grown to about 500.
According to its originators, the aim of the petition was to
show the Athletic Department, specifically Athletic Director
Andy Geiger, that the Band is considered an integral part of
the Stanford football experience.
"We wanted to let them (the Athletic Department) know
how important the Band is to us and how important it is to
the festivities," Lytle said. "Through the good and bad
seasons, we could always count on the Band to make us
laugh.''
Saturday's thrilling Cardinal victory required no comic
relief, however. As junior Kevin Tahan said, "You don't need
the Band to watch football."
Still, other Stanford fans missed having the Band here to
put the finishing touches on a successful day for
the Cardinal. "The game was great, hut not com
plete without the Stanford Band for the victory
celebration," senior Andy Hall said.
"What are we going to do after the game if we
win?" senior Tom Gillespie asked at halftime.
"Just walk out?"
The Band's absence was most conspicuous
when Stanford scored. Senior Andy Huang said,
"It was kind of weird after we scored not to have
the Band here."
The crowd tried to improvise by singing "All
Right Now" after each touchdown, but its efforts
never reached the press box, according to Daily
reporter John Lis. One Cardinal rooter tried to
bring technology to the problem by playing a
Band rendition of the song on a tape recorder,
but there was no problem deciding whether his
version was live or Memorex.
Twice, once in the third quarter and once after
the game, parts of the Stanford crowd began to
chant "We want the Band," but a cynic would

argue that the chant was designed to draw the at
tention of the CBS television cameras, which
were panning the Stanford section on both occa
sions.
And there definitely were a few anti-Band
cynics at Saturday's game.
"I was glad they weren't here,"' senior Dan Cur
ran said. "They think they're so cool jumping
around out there and stuff."
"It made the game not having to listen to that
song ("All Right Now") over and over again,"
sophomore John Elmoro said. "But they were
never as bad as the UCIA halftime show (a Bruin
invasion of the City of Troy)."
"It was sweet not to have to listen to them like
they did something (to have an effect on the
game)," Tahan said.
But with 500 signatures backing him up, O'Neal
would seem to represent the majority view when
he said, "We all want to see the Band play at Big
Game."
Well, maybe not all. There was some indif
ference on the issue of the Band. "The Band isn't
here? I guess that's right," senior Jeff Keller said
with a laugh. "I didn't really notice."
