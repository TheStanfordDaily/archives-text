### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Stanford women's volleyball returned late last night from
a long weekend on the road and in the air with two Pacific 10
Conference wins and with confirmation that the team is
more than six women deep.
Everybody played as the No. 10 Cardinal defeated Wash
ington State yesterday afternoon and Washington Saturday
night to improve its Pac-10 record to 12-1, continuing to put
pressure on UCLA, which is a game ahead at 14-1. The
Bruins defeated No. 15 Oregon Saturday night in four
games and are alone with Stanford in the race for first in the
conference.
The scores indicate that the spikers had a fairly easy time
this weekend, as they won 15-7, 15-11, 15-13 and then 15-4,
15-12, 15-9. Scores can be deceiving though, and while the
1 luskies did put up a good fight Saturday, it was the jet set
ting from San Francisco to Seattle to Spokane to Pullman
that really hampered the Cardinal.
The matches only real scare came in the second game
against Washington when the Cardinal went down 10-3
before fighting back. "We hung tough when we had to,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"It wasn't pretty, and Washington played really well,"
Shaw said. "I think they had won eight straight at home.
Washington State played much better than they had before.
"We struggled at times," Shaw added, "but mainly I think
it was just the travel time."
This was the first pair of matches in which every member
of the squad played. Shaw said that everybody played well
and that the back ups have the mental confidence and spirit
to help the team whenever necessary.

leyball more than in most other sports, where you pretty

much know if you're going to play or not," Shaw
said. "In volleyball, you have to be ready through
out every game. You may not play in three or four
consecutive games, but you can be called on to
step in at any time."
With the kind of schedule which the Cardinal
now faces, the non-starters will have to be more
ready than ever to step in. Next weekend, Stan
ford hosts Arizona and Arizona State. The follow
ing Tuesday the team will be at California, and
then it travels to Southern California for a
weekend of play versus UCIA and USC.
"We don't have a chance to relax," Shaw said.
"From here on out it's going to be one game at a
time right through the playoffs."
As it has been doing all season, Stanford outhit
its opponents by quite a bit this weekend, equal

ing its error totals, but leaving the pack far behind
in kills. Against the Huskies, the Cardinal hit for a
.302 percentage versus Washington's .178. The
difference was even greater at WSU with Stanford
finishing with a .293 percentage and the Cougars
managing only .123.
Saturday night, Theresa Smith led Stanford in
kills with 23 at a .400 success rate, while Erin
Clage led the Huskies with 12. Laura Olesen hit
nine kills with no errors for a .643 percentage.
The most negative statistic of the weekend was
the team's service error total cf 10 in the Wash
ington game.
