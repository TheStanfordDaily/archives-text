# Water polo wins 2 despite struggling
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Although the Stanford men's water
polo team won two Pacific-10 Confer
ence games on the road over the
weekend to clinch its eighth Pac-10
title in 10 years, things weren't getting
any easier for the Cardinal.
After winning all 30 of its games this
season, including 13-7 and 9-4 victories
over No. 5 USC and 12-5 and 11-8 wins
over No. 3 UCLA, top-rated Stanford
figured for a difficult weekend.
It got a little more than it bargained
for.
"Teams are just sitting at their home
pool preparing all week for us," Stan
ford Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "It's
a matter of teams really getting
psyched for us. And after 32 wins, we
are beginning to get a little com
placent."
The 32-0 Cardinal (5-0 in Pac-10
play) extended its NCAA record
breaking winning streak to 41 games
dating back to last season with an 11-9
win over USC and a 10-7 victory over
UCLA. The Trojans fell to 15-8 on the
year while the Bruins dropped to 20-7.
However, for the first time this year,
the Cardinal was shut out in the first
quarter and trailed at halftime against
the Trojans. In addition, the contest
marked the only instance this season
that Stanford was tied going into the
fourth quarter. And this was against the
same team that the Cardinal had
crushed twice earlier this vear.

"We have won so many games that
we have sort of forgotten what it was
like to lose," senior Chris Thompson
said. "We go into the game almost as
suming we are going to win — and that
is a very bad attitude. It is the worst I
have ever seen all of us play"
USC, playing before a large crowd
and a television audience, shot out to a
3-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.
"They were really up for us," senior
David Jmbernino said. "We over
looked them. We were thinking about
our next game against UCI.A."
The Cardinal stormed back to score
five goals in the second quarter but
still trailed the Trojans 6-5 at the half.
"We played the worst half we have
played all season," Dettamanti said.
"We were doing nothing right Our
defense was attrocious. We were doing
very uncharacteristic things. We just
played terrible water polo."
USC, behind sophomore goalie
Kevin Stringer, managed to hold Stan
ford off in the third quarter. The score
was tied at seven.
"We weren't sticking to the fun
damentals of the game," Thompson
said. "We were making sloppy passes
and we weren't countering well.
In the fourth quarter, however, the
Cardinal finally took control. Behind
two goals each by senior Greg Gamble
and junior Erich Fischer, Stanford
scored four goals in the final period to
salvage an 11-9 win.
Fischer scored four goals in the
game, with senior Craig Klass tallying
three. Junior Matt Tingler scored one,
with Imbernino also scoring once.
After a team meeting Friday night,
the Cardinal rebounded from an off
performance against the Trojans to
defeat UCLA 10-7.
"I though we played OK," Detta
inanti said. "It was pretty close the
whole way. We played good water polo
against UCLA but not consistent water
polo."
Stanford shut out sophomore Bruin
Fernando Carsalade, limiting him to
only one shot in the entire game. It was
Carsalade who gave the Cardinal diffi
culties the last time the two teams met.
Stanford, paced by four goals each
by Imbernino and Klass, led 5-4 at
halftime and scored three goals in the
last period to push the score to its final
10-7 margin.
"Two things that have plagued us all
season hurt us again this weekend,"
Dettamanti said. "We are not taking
good shots at critical times — we are
making goalies look good and we are
giving up too many easy goals."
Including this weekend's games, Fis
cher has now scored 78 goals this
season, with Klass scoring 77. Both are
closing in on the Stanford record of 82
goals set by James Bergeson in 1981.
After this weekend's play, the Card
inal only has one regular season con
test remaining before the NCAAs Nov.
28-30 — a Nov. 22 Big Game date at
No. 2 California.
"It might have been a blessing in dis
guise for us," Dettamanti said. "I am
glad we got this weekend out of the
way. It is hard to get up for every single
game and we still won the games. That
is a sign of a good team."
