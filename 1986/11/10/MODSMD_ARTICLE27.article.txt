# Water polo wins 2 despite struggling
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Although the Stanford men's water
polo team won two Pacific-10 Confer
ence games on the road over the
weekend to clinch its eighth Pac-10
title in 10 years, things weren't getting
any easier for the Cardinal.
After winning all 30 of its games this
season, including 13-7 and 9-4 victories
over No. 5 USC and 12-5 and 11-8 wins
over No. 3 UCLA, top-rated Stanford
figured for a difficult weekend.
It got a little more than it bargained
for.
"Teams are just sitting at their home
pool preparing all week for us," Stan
ford Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "It's
a matter of teams really getting
psyched for us. And after 32 wins, we
are beginning to get a little com
placent."
The 32-0 Cardinal (5-0 in Pac-10
play) extended its NCAA record
breaking winning streak to 41 games
dating back to last season with an 11-9
win over USC and a 10-7 victory over
UCLA. The Trojans fell to 15-8 on the
year while the Bruins dropped to 20-7.
However, for the first time this year,
the Cardinal was shut out in the first
quarter and trailed at halftime against
the Trojans. In addition, the contest
marked the only instance this season
that Stanford was tied going into the
fourth quarter. And this was against the
same team that the Cardinal had
crushed twice earlier this vear.

"We have won so many games that
we have sort of forgotten what it was
like to lose," senior Chris Thompson
said. "We go into the game almost as
suming we are going to win â€” and that
is a very bad attitude. It is the worst I
have ever seen all of us play"
USC, playing before a large crowd
and a television audience, shot out to a
3-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.
"They were really up for us," senior
David Jmbernino said. "We over
looked them. We were thinking about
our next game against UCI.A."
The Cardinal stormed back to score
five goals in the second quarter but
still trailed the Trojans 6-5 at the half.
"We played the worst half we have
played all season," Dettamanti said.
"We were doing nothing right Our
defense was attrocious. We were doing
very uncharacteristic things. We just
played terrible water polo."
USC, behind sophomore goalie
Kevin Stringer, managed to hold Stan
ford off in the third quarter. The score
was tied at seven.
"We weren't sticking to the fun
damentals of the game," Thompson
said. "We were making sloppy passes
and we weren't countering well.
In the fourth quarter, however, the
Cardinal finally took control. Behind
two goals each by senior Greg Gamble
and junior Erich Fischer, Stanford
scored four goals in the final period to
salvage an 11-9 win.
