### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Overcoming weather that was more
fitting for ice hockey. the Stanford field
hockey team successfully completed its
quest for the Northern Pacific Confer
ence title Friday with a 1-0 victory over
visiting Chico Suite.
The victory was the 10th straight for
a Cardinal squad that was at one point
Oil in the NorPac. Stanford finished
the regular season at 12-4-1, 6-1-1 in
conference action, and will now wait to
hear where it must travel next
weekend for the NCAA regionals The
Wildcats dropped to 1-5-2 in the Nor
Pac
As the Cardinal had expected, Chico
fielded an upset-minded team Friday.
The Wildcats put pressure on the Stan
ford defense from the outset, keeping
the ball in the Cardinal end of the field
for much of die first half.
That's very typical of that team,
senior defender Mary Goodman said
of Chico s determination. Reputation

isn't something that keeps that team
down."
Stanford goalkeeper Karen Jones
w;is able to keep the Wildcats from
scoring, however. "Obviously, our
goalkeeper has been playing superb
ly," Goodman said of Jones, who
notched her 10th shutout of the
season.
The Cardinal began to mount a
more consistent offensive attack as the
first half neared its conclusion, and,
with just minutes remaining, Kat
Thomas took a perfect pass from
Maree Chung, split two defenders and
fired the ball across her body into the
left corner of the net
Thomas seemed rather unimpressed
by her goal. "It was passed to me be
hind the defense, and I just shot for the
goal," she said
Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson was
more generous with her appraisal of
the games only goal. "The goal that
she scored was great. Johnson said.
The Cardinal looked as though it
would add to its lead at the beginning
of the second half Chunk's masterful

deflection of a Stanford shot was
headed for the upper left corner of the
goal when the Chico goalkeeper
slapped it away at the last second
"We had a lot of chances to score —
a lot of close shots — hut at least we
got one in," Thomas said.
The Cardinal continued to pressure
the Wildcat defense throughout the
second half. "Our determination to
win the game increased as the end got
closer," Goodman said. "(But) it wasn't
th.it they were completely dominated
at the end of the game."
The Wildcats were anything but
timid in the final minutes, threatening
relentlessly as only seconds stood be
tween the Cardinal and the conference
title.
But Stanford survived the wild
scramble and will enter postseason
play as the NorPac champion for the
second consecutive year.
"Game by game, we got better,"
Johnson said of the Cardinal s surge to
the league title "I still don't think
we've peaked, which is gmxl because
we're going to nationals now.
