# Men's soccer ties Brown 1-1, loses 3-1 to California away
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
It was a disappointing weekend for the Stanford
men's soccer team. The Cardinal met Brown at a
freezing Maloney Field Friday and came away with a
1-1 tie.
It was the second consecutive tie between the two
teams, as they played to a 0-0 draw at Brown last year.
Then, with little time to stew over Friday's contest,
Stanford yesterday had to come right back and play a
much-improved California team. The result was a 3-1
defeat at Berkeley in a game that was closer than the
score might indicate. The Cardinal crushed Cal 4-0 in
their meeting last season.
The game with Brown was marred by extremely
cold and windy conditions. And on a day when every
hint of contact was like being hit with a lead weight,
there was plenty of physical play to be found.
Brown's style was something like what the Cardinal
encountered when it met Nevada-Las Vegas earlier
this year â€” but worse.
"The most remarkable tiling about the game was
the rough play. There was a lot of hacking and there
were a lot people kicking each other and grabbing
shirts and arms. Everyone says they play a rougher
style in the East than we do out here," sophomore
fullback Jim Killfoil said.
"(Freshman forward) Chris Porch's shirt was actu
ally torn. He had a hand across his chest. You could

see the marks of each finger from where he was
grabbed and scratched. That pretty much summed
up the entire game," Killfoil said.
The game would've been a scoreless tie if it
weren't for two questionable calls in the penalty area.
The first awarded a first-half penalty kick to Stan
ford. It was converted by senior striker Jim Cole on
low line-drive into the left, corner. The second, near
the end of the half, cafne on a much-disputed call
against sophomore fullback Chris Illick.
"The first call wasn't really severe enough to get a
penalty kick. So we knew if there was anything close
in our box that they'd probable get one, too. The call
against Chris was hardly worthy of a foul. Ours was
called more severe than it was; theirs probably
shouldn't have even been called. They kind of
evened each other out," Killfoil said.
The California loss was a much bigger disappoint
ment. The team viewed it as a way to salvage the
season. And the team again played well enough to
win. As has been the case much of the season, missed
opportnunities and defensive lapses cost the Card
inal.
"I don't like to lose to Cal. We made some mistakes
and had some great chances. When we were down 2-
1, (sophomore midfielder Kevin) Woodhouse had a
great shot saved nicely by the Cal keeper. Lapses gave
up the goals. We moved the ball well and converted
our chances into good shots, but many of them went
right at the keeper," Stanford Coach Sam Koch said.

"We had them under a lot of pressure and just
couldn't capitalize. The third goal they scored was a
breakaway goal when we had pulled so many people
up (looking for the tying goal)."
Juan Garcia recorded the only goal for Stanford to
tie the game in the first half on a first-time shot from
a cross by Porch. Killfoil produced his initial point of
the season, setting up the cross with a throw-in down
the sideline.
The second Cal goal came in very bizarre fashion.
The Bears were awarded an indirect free kick in the
Stanford penalty area. With the Stanford wall stand
ing just five yards from the goal line, a Cal player
pounded a shot at the line of players.
"The shot went through our wall off the leg of one
of the players. It was on top of Tom (senior
goalkeeper Austin) before he knew it and it went
through his legs. He tried to dive back and get it but
couldn't. He couldn't do anything about it. The ball
isn't supposed to get through the wall," Killfoil said.
Unlike the Brown game and the two games previ
ous to that, backup goalkeeper Chris Helling did not
play in the second half at Berkeley. He was suffering
from an injury sustained against Brown. Sophomore
fullback Luke Garrot and junior midfielder Jerry Mal
donado both played sparingly after irritating ankle
sprains early in the game.
Juan Garcia now shares the team lead in points
with Jim Cole at nine apiece. Garcia leads the team in
goals with four, Cole in assists with five.

Depite good efforts such as this one by freshman Mark Semioli (3), Stanford
could not come up with any wins this weekend,
