# Vienna campus to close in June
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
The Stanford Program in Vienna will
be permanently shut down at the end
of the academic year, according to the
dean of Undergraduate Studies.
The dean, Carolyn Lougee, said she
had decided last Thursday to close the
campus. Lougee's action followed a 7-2
vote by the Program Committee of
Overseas Studies recommending
closure of the campus. The two student
members of the committee both cast
votes against the closure recommenda
tion.
According to Lougee, the decision to
close the campus was made because of
a number of problems with the pro
gram, including low student enroll
ment, weak curriculum and poor ad
ministration of the program. She noted
that the only time that Vienna had been
"even close" to full enrollment was last
year when the Stanford Chorale was
based there as part of a tour of Europe.
German Studies Prof. Russell Ber
man, a member of the Program Com
mittee, said the decision was also

based on budgetary constraints caused
by Stanford's expansion of its overseas
program in other parts of the world.
Berman added that the University did
not need two programs in German
speaking countries and that Berlin had
the better program.
The only chance that the decision
will be reversed is if the Faculty Senate
votes against the move, according to
Lougee. For that to happen, the sen
ate's steering committee would have to
determine whether the senate has the
right to vote on the decision.
Lougee said she did not expect the
steering committee to take the issue
before the senate. She added that she
had sent a memorandum to Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, the steering com
mittee chairman, advising him of the
decision on the Vienna program.
The decision was sharply criticized
by Cathy McDonnell, a senior English
major who was in Vienna autumn and
winter quarters last year. According to
McDonnell, the low enrollment was
due to poor promotion of the program
at Stanford.
"It's always one of the less popular
campuses because they present it as
being worthwhile only for students in
terested in music," said McDonnell.
She said that many of the courses of
fered in Vienna were political science
courses, with emphasis on Austria's po
sition in relation to neighboring com
munist countries.
Berman agreed that the German
speaking programs had a public rela
tions problem on campus, but that it
worked to the disadvantage of the Ber
lin program, not the Vienna program.
"There can be no doubt that, as far as
cultural wealth, Berlin is head and
shoulders above Vienna," Berman said.
Students who are particularly inter
ested in Austria will be encouraged to
spend one quarter in Berlin, followed
by an Austrian internship, he said.
Margaret Gillespie, a student mem
ber of the Program Committee of
Overseas Studies, said that in the
meeting she had "disagreed with the
basic premise that Berlin and Vienna
are interchangeable." Gillespie, a
senior history major, said that the ar
gument could also be used to end one
of the programs in either Paris or
Tours, France.
According to Lougee, the program in
Paris "has a lot of problems," but she
said there was no talk of shutting it
down.
