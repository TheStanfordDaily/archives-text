# Men's golf participates in last fall tournament
##

The course will be challenging, but the competition
should be a little easier for the Stanford men's golf team
todav at the University of San Francisco Invitational, the final
tournament on the Cardinal's fall schedule.
Stanford will be playing on one of California's — if not
the nation's — most difficult courses, the Lake Course at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco. However, the Cardinal will
not have to worry about many of the West Coast's strongest
squads, including Arizona and Arizona State.
The first 36 holes of the 54-hole tournament will be
played today, with the final 18 tomorrow. The tournament is
condensed into two days because of an NCAA rule limiting
each team to 30 days of competition.
Because a team's chances of making the NCAA tourna
ment in the spring depend heavily on how it does against
teams in its own district, Stanford will be gunning for USC
and UCLA this week. Both the Trojans and the Bruins have
topped the Cardinal this fall.
"It's important to beat USC and UCLA," Stanford junior
Rich Marik said. "If we beat them, we're back in the ball
game for nationals."
Stanford has not fared well in its five previous fall tourna
ments. The team has no seniors and nine of its 17 members

are freshmen. But Marik refused to use youth as an excuse
for the squad's performance.
"We've played terribly. This team is the best team I've
been a part of since I've been here," he said. "It's easy to say
we're young. But (the players) we have have all won major
junior tournaments. We have not played well."
Stanford's problems have not been due to poor work
habits. "I see the team putting together a real good effort,"
Marik said. "We've played poorly this fall, but no one has
given up. Making nationals will be tough. It will take a great
effort."
After this week's tournament, Stanford will be inactive for
the next two months before starting its winter schedule at
the Anderson Pacific Intercollegiate in Santa Barbara. A
strong performance this week could give the Cardinal some
momentum for next quarter.
"I would like nothing tetter than to go into winter having
played a good tournament," Marik said. "There's no doubt it
would help our winter schedule."
Joining Marik in the Cardinal lineup this week will be
Brad Geer, Don Christensen, John Mahon and Steve White.
Playing 36 holes today may be a little strenuous for the
Stanford five, but at least one of them doesn't mind because
of the course, which will be the site of the 1987 U.S. Open.
"It's going to be a really good experience," Marik said.
"Playing 36 out there will be fun. I would never complain."
