# Faculty favors writing change

Stanford professors say the quality'of
student writing at Stanford is relatively
high and continually improving, but
they still favor requiring all students to
take freshman English and dropping
exemption from the program based on
students' scores on the Advanced
Placement exam.
The bad influences of television,
movies, pre-professional attitudes and
a societal lack of concern about writing
have not taken as great a toll on Stan-

ford student writing as they have else
where, according to freshman instruc
tors here. They say, however, that all
students — regardless of the writing
ability they possess coming into Stan*
ford — could benefit from one or two
quarters of an intensive freshman
writing program.
"The very best writers in our fresh
man classes are — on an ideal scale of
one to 10 — about sevens," said En
glish Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino, who has
taught freshman its well as upperclass
courses.
To combat the current lack of atten
tion to writing, the English Department
last week announced that scores
four or five on the English Literature

AP test may no longer exempt students
from freshman English, a move that the
faculty appears to support overwhelm
ingly.
In an Oct. 30 presentation to the Fac
ulty Senate, Carolyn Lougee, dean of
Undergraduate Studies, said the
literature test does not effectively test
writing ability and that, consequently,
some students who need extra writing
practice are not receiving help.
"Stanford professors' experience
with the writing AP-exempted
students in other Stanford courses
have often revealed serious problems,
further suggesting the ineffectiveness
of the AP score as a device for distin
guishing between those who write ef
fectively and those who do not do so
yet," Lougee said.
In an experiment about 10 years
ago, when students could exempt
either by the AP exam or a special Stan
ford test, AP-exempted students were
given the test, and only 20 percent
passed it, Lougee said.
As more* and more students have
been exempted over the years since
the policy was established in 1969,
concern has grown, according to
Lougee. In 1969, the Faculty Senate an
ticipated 10 to 15 percent of freshmen
would be exempted from freshman
English. In 1980, 19 percent of the
