# Faculty favors writing change

Stanford professors say the quality'of
student writing at Stanford is relatively
high and continually improving, but
they still favor requiring all students to
take freshman English and dropping
exemption from the program based on
students' scores on the Advanced
Placement exam.
The bad influences of television,
movies, pre-professional attitudes and
a societal lack of concern about writing
have not taken as great a toll on Stan-

ford student writing as they have else
where, according to freshman instruc
tors here. They say, however, that all
students — regardless of the writing
ability they possess coming into Stan*
ford — could benefit from one or two
quarters of an intensive freshman
writing program.
"The very best writers in our fresh
man classes are — on an ideal scale of
one to 10 — about sevens," said En
glish Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino, who has
taught freshman its well as upperclass
courses.
To combat the current lack of atten
tion to writing, the English Department
last week announced that scores
four or five on the English Literature

AP test may no longer exempt students
from freshman English, a move that the
faculty appears to support overwhelm
ingly.
In an Oct. 30 presentation to the Fac
ulty Senate, Carolyn Lougee, dean of
Undergraduate Studies, said the
literature test does not effectively test
writing ability and that, consequently,
some students who need extra writing
practice are not receiving help.
"Stanford professors' experience
with the writing AP-exempted
students in other Stanford courses
have often revealed serious problems,
further suggesting the ineffectiveness
of the AP score as a device for distin
guishing between those who write ef
fectively and those who do not do so
yet," Lougee said.
In an experiment about 10 years
ago, when students could exempt
either by the AP exam or a special Stan
ford test, AP-exempted students were
given the test, and only 20 percent
passed it, Lougee said.
As more* and more students have
been exempted over the years since
the policy was established in 1969,
concern has grown, according to
Lougee. In 1969, the Faculty Senate an
ticipated 10 to 15 percent of freshmen
would be exempted from freshman
English. In 1980, 19 percent of the
freshman class placed out of the pro
gram, and this year 39 percent of fresh
men received an exemption, Lougee
said.
Several faculty members said they
were pleased with the English Depart
ment's decision, which now needs
only funding approval from the
Provost's Office in order to become
the policy, beginning with the class of
1991.
Sorrentino, who said the quality of
student writing "is not what it should
be," said he is "all for" abolishing the
exemption.
He said student writing is improving
but that quality is dependent on factors
over which the University faculty has
no control — high school education
and students' reading habits.
"Any writer's ability to write is based
essentially on the range, quality and
depth of his reading," said Sorrentino,

arguing that students are not suffi
ciently encouraged to read and that
high school teachers often reward bad,
flowery writing habits.
English Lecturer Peter Steinhart,
who has taught freshman English
courses on environmental issues since
1977, said student writing is "much
better" than when he first taught here,
but blamed high school education for
major shortcomings that he still finds
in student work.
High school classes, Steinhart said,
don't deal with "questions of values" in
philosophy and history courses. "I
have the sense that people come with
manufactured values," making them
unable to think critically and develop
new ideas, he said.
Lee Wandel, who coordinates His
tory 1-2-3 discussion sections, which
consist mostly of freshmen, said Stan
ford students are better writers than
students at other colleges, but she
added that no one is so good that one
or two quarters of freshman English
would not help.

"From my experience, some people
can test out of English when they really
need those extra hours," Wandel said.
"Intellectual development is bound up
with increasing mastery of the lan
guage. We should be teaching a certain
kind of subtlety."
Wandel said society is to blame for
many of the problems students have
with writing. "In this country over the
last 10 years, there has been a real loss
in terms of the value placed on
writing," she said. "I don't hold the stu
dents responsible, but they don't place
as great an emphasis on writing."
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Robert
Eustis and Engineering Lecturer David
Lougee, who have set up a program to
develop writing-intensive courses in
the engineering curriculum, the Tech
nical Communication Program, said
they are hopeful that the revised fresh
man writing requirement will help im
prove the quality of engineering
writing. They said engineering stu
dents' writing is not as good as it could
be and that writing ability is essential

for a successful engineering career.
Carolyn Lougee said an informal
telephone survey of comparable
schools showed that Harvard, Prince
ton, Yale, the University of Chicago,
Columbia and Pennsylvania give no ex
emption from their freshman writing
requirement on the basis of the AP
exam. Cornell gives exemptions to stu
dents who score five on the AP exam,
get an excellent grade on a special Cor
nell test and pass a case-by-case review.
Dartmouth and the University of
California-Berkeley exempt all stu
dents who score four or five.
While the English Department will
abolish the exemption, its new plan
calls for establishing a more intense,
one-quarter course designed specifi
cally for those who earn high scores on
the AP. The class will be "a highly chal
lenging, rapid-paced course that in
cludes the research paper and other
advanced work," Lougee said. Under
the new plan, students scoring four or
five will still receive 10 units of credit
toward graduation.
