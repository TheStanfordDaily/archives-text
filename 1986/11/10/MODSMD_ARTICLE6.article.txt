the Band's suspension by Althljetic Director Andy Geiger last
Wednesday.
Band manager Jeff Stevens called a meeting Friday to in
form the band of the management's position on their
suspension and to hear the members' reactions.
"Everything has happened so quickly. On Wednesday, it
was a bomb, it was huge. And only now are we finally going
to sit down and say what we're going to do," Stevens said.
Band management has instructed the members to refrain
from commenting to the press, but, according to Stevens,
the Band has "a million different reactions" to the suspen
sion.
"Some people felt that we were being too cordial, too
conciliatory to the Athletic Department. Others agreed with
the fact that we need to let everything calm down for a
while," Stevens said.
According to the terms of the suspension, Band members
cannot perform on the field at this year's Big Game against
