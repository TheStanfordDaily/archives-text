Members of the Leland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band met privately Friday to air their opinions regarding
the Band's suspension by Althljetic Director Andy Geiger last
Wednesday.
Band manager Jeff Stevens called a meeting Friday to in
form the band of the management's position on their
suspension and to hear the members' reactions.
"Everything has happened so quickly. On Wednesday, it
was a bomb, it was huge. And only now are we finally going
to sit down and say what we're going to do," Stevens said.
Band management has instructed the members to refrain
from commenting to the press, but, according to Stevens,
the Band has "a million different reactions" to the suspen
sion.
"Some people felt that we were being too cordial, too
conciliatory to the Athletic Department. Others agreed with
the fact that we need to let everything calm down for a
while," Stevens said.
According to the terms of the suspension, Band members
cannot perform on the field at this year's Big Game against
University of California-Berkeley. Geiger's decision, with

which University President Donald
Kennedy concurred, came in response
to a series of incidents the University
found unacceptable.
"I can't trust them," Geiger said last
Wednesday. "They don't seem able to
have a level of taste and values that rep
resent this place. As long as it's that
way, they're not going to perform on
the same field as the football team."
Geiger plans to meet with Stevens
Wednesday to discuss the Band's
suspension.

"We agreed with the Athletic Depart
ment that something had to be done,
but we were surprised at the magni
tude of what they had done," said
Stevens, speaking for Band manage
ment.
Stevens said he was unsure what ac
tion he felt Geiger should have taken
against the Band.
"I wouldn't want to be in (Geiger's)
shoes," he said.
The Band did not travel indepen
dently to the UCLA game this weekend
to play. Approximately 60 members
watched the game on big-screen televi
sion in the Band Shak Saturday.
Geiger was in Los Angeles yesterday
and was unavailable for comment.
Despite the University actions

against LSJUMB, Band members still
plan to play at Big Game, and band
practice is scheduled to run as usual
tonight.
"We've been told that we can play in
the stands at the Big Game, and I see
no reason why we won't," Stevens said.
Plans to play at the Big Game rally in
San Francisco on Nov. 21 remain un
changed, Stevens said on Friday.
"We don't intend to punish (the stu
dents) because we've been punished,"
he said.
The Band also still plans to play in
the Coca-Cola Bowl in Tokyo, Japan,
Thanksgiving Weekend.
At the Coca-Cola Bowl, the Band will
perform with the University of Arizona
marching band in a pre-planned game

show written by Tele-Planning Interna
tional, the company sponsoring the
event, according to Stevens.
After Friday's meeting, the Band
held a spontaneous rally, marching
past surprised students to White Plaza,
where members played standing in the
Claw fountain.
According to Stevens, LSJUMB has
no plans to initiate a student-led
defense of the Band. "We're not going
to do anything specifically, but we
hope the students will support us," he
said.
The Council of Presidents, The
Senior Class Presidents and the Axe
Committee have volunteered their
support, according to Stevens.
