Seven arrested with guns at SFO
SAN FRANCISCO — Seven people headed for Mexico were arrested yes
terday after security officers found several guns and some ammunition in
their luggage, said airport police.
The officers at San Francisco International Airport became suspicious
when they saw what looked like the outline of a handgun while X-raying a
large radio that was being carried aboard a Mexicana Airlines flight, said
patrolman Alan Wurdinger. He said the radio turned out to contain a par
tially assembled gun and some ammunition.
He said luggage that had already been placed aboard the plane also was
searched.
"We found approximately five more handguns in checked baggage in a
search involving canine units and X-ray equipment," Wurdinger said. He
said the investigation was continuing.
The names of the arrested people were not immediately available.
The flight, which was scheduled to leave San Francisco at 1 a.m., left at
5:44 a.m. for Guadalajara and Mexico City, said a Mexicana reservations su
pervisor in Los Angeles who did not want her name used.
Bell calls for more college aid
WASHINGTON — A national commission headed by former Education
Secretary Terrel Bell called yesterday for a massive effort to nearly double
the number of college-educated adults by the turn of the century.
And the commission took a sharp slap at members of the Reagan admin
istration and other politicians for "unthinkingly abetting an act of national
suicide" by trying to cut aid for college students.
Bell's 22-member panel prepared the report for the American Associa
tion of State Colleges and Universities, which represents 372 four-year
campuses that enroll 2.5 million students and award a third of all bachelor
degrees.
It urged states to keep college tuitions as low as possible, in part to help
recruit more minority students and stop the growth of "an American un
derclass."
"America has far too many people whose abilities are never awakened,"
declared the 22-member National Commission on the Role and Future of
State Colleges and Universities in its 56-page report, "To Secure the Bless
ings of Liberty."
Bell was to address the association today at its annual meeting in
Phoenix.
The commission included Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and former Missis
sippi Gov. William Winter, as well as a half-dozen college presidents, the
heads of both national teacher unions and the chancellor of New York
City's schools.
Bell served in Reagan's Cabinet for four years and went before Congress
to defend the president's requests to cut college aid by a third or more. But
Bell said in a telephone interview that he always battled inside the Adminis
tration with then-budget director David Stockman over those cuts.
Khomeini: Death won't matter
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's ailing, 86-year
old spiritual leader, said yesterday his death would not end the country's
Islamic revolution. He apparently was trying to defuse a power struggle
within the clergy-led regime.
"Our enemies must understand that the Islamic Republic ... has been
stabilized and is not dependent on any person, but on the people and the
armed forces," Khomeini said in a speech to military men at his residence
injamaran, north of Tehran.
The speech was carried by Tehran radio and was monitored in Nicosia.
Widespread reports said Khomeini, who had a heart attack in 1980,
recently suffered one or two more attacks. Rumors that he is in declining
health are common, but this time people in power seem to be taking the
reports seriously.
They come at a time when academic, diplomatic and business sources
say a struggle for syrvival is under way in Iran's leadership, nearly eight
years after uprisings inspired by Khomeini ended the reign of the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
The struggle for power in Iran is not a simple affair between right and
left or moderates and hard-liners. Numerous groups are involved, and
some switch sides frequently.
Iran specialists say at least two hardline groups of clergymen are pitted
against each other, each claiming to speak for Islam and the revolution.
The hard-liners include such uncompromising figures as Seyyed
Mohammad Musavi Khoeiniha, 45, who was in charge of militants who oc
cupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days in 1979-80 and held 52
Americans hostage.
Other hard-liners are Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, head of the Assembly of Ex
perts which rules on appointments to government posts, and Khomeini's
son, Ahmad.
Missing Israeli under arrest
JERUSALEM — Israel revealed yesterday that Mordechai Vanunu, a
former nuclear technician who allegedly leaked state atomic secrets, is in
detention and will be tried. But it denied that secret agents kidnapped
Vanunu in England to bring him to justice.
The brief government commuique ended weeks of speculation about
Vanunu's whereabouts. He disappeared in London nearly six weeks ago,
after the Sunday Times of London published photographs and information
he reportedly supplied about an Israeli nuclear weapons plant.
A senior government official said the 32-year-old Israeli could be tried
for treason, a crime punishable by death. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
The communique, read to reporters by Cabinet secretary Elyakim
Rubinstein, appeared designed to prevent damage to Israel's ties with Brit
ain and ease pressure on the government from the news media and Parlia
ment.
It left many questions unanswered, including how or when Vanunu got
from London to Israel.
"All rumors as if he was kidnapped on British soil are baseless," the
statement said.
In London, the Observer newspaper reported yesterday that then-Prime
Minister Shimon Peres called Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
on Sept. 23 to warn her that Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, planned
to kidnap Vanunu and request that British security agents not interfere.
Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament on Friday that neither she nor any mem
bers of her staff had been in contact with Israeli officials about Vanunu. A
spokesman for her office repeated the denial yesterday when asked about
the Observer report.
World Series sparks racism
AMHERST, Mass. — Ever since the Red Sox lost the World Series, black
and hispanic students say life in this small college town 100 miles from
Boston's Fenway Park has become a nightmare.
A fight in Amherst between white Red Sox fans and black boosters of the
New York Mets injured a bystander after the final game of the series and
unearthed racial tensions at the University of Massachusetts here that
spread to nearby colleges in the Connecticut River Valley.
A racial slur was painted on the steps of Smith College a week after the
World Series. Rumors floated that a white student in a Ku Klux Klan outfit at
a Halloween party won a prize for the costume. Black women complained
of stepped-up harassment.
Mount Holyoke senior Michele Mitchell said a University of Massachu
setts student voiced a racial insult at her and shoved her away from a copier
at a university library the week after the game.
Mitchell and white classmate Erin Fields organized a racism teach-in at
Mount Holyoke that drew 600 students Friday. A few days earlier, similar
discussions at Smith College in Northampton attracted 2,000 students.
The Smith talks were prompted by a slur painted on the steps of Lilly
Hall on Oct. 30.
