# Iranian deal outrages senators
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders accused
the Reagan administration yesterday of keeping them
in the dark about reported White House deals to
send arms to Iran, and some suggested its power to
conduct such operations should be curbed.
The criticism came amid speculation that Secretary
of State George Shultz, who also apparendy knew
little about the contacts that reportedly produced
arms deliveries in return for hostage releases, could
resign over the matter.
Shultz called an unusual meeting of State Depart
ment experts yesterday at his suburban Washington
home, but officials said the session on Syrian
sponsored terrorism was unrelated to questions
about Iran.
A New York Times report quoting Shultz aides
raising the possibility of a Shultz resignation "is pure
speculation, as the story itself says," spokeswoman
Sondra McCarty said. "I am not going to have further
comment."
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), chairman of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee, said he had spoken
to Shultz on Saturday. "In my judgment, he will not
resign," Lugar told interviewers on ABC's "This Week
with David Brinkley."

News reports last week said former National Se
curity Adviser Robert McFarlane traveled to Tehran
earlier this year and arranged to ship arms to Iran in
exchange for the release of U.S. hostages kidnapped
in Beirut.
An embargo on arms shipments to Iran, which is at
war with Iraq, has been in effect since 1979. The offi
cial U.S. position on the war is neutrality.
If the press reports are true, said Senate Demo
cratic Leader Robert Byrd, the arms trade was "a
major blunder" that guarantees hostage-taking will
continue and could tip the balance of power in the
Middle East.
Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan ),
told a conference in Atlanta yesterday that it would
be a "terrible mistake" to cut an arms deal with Iran.
"We all want the hostages home," he said, "but I
don't think we want to deal with (Ayatollah Ruhollah)
Khomeini in an effort to do that."
But other Republicans defended the reported ad
ministration activities, saying it is desirable to im
prove relations with Iran and attempt to moderate its
extremism.
"The wider goal here is to try to bring about a
more moderate group of leadership in Iran....

We've made some strides in that regard," said Sen.
Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a member of the Senate Intelli
gence Committee, appearing on CBS' "Face the Na
tion."
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, appear
ing with Lugar, said improving relations with Iran in
general is desirable. But he added: "When it
degenerated or when it developed into an arms trade
for hostages, I have the gravest doubt."
"To negotiate for hostages makes it more likely
that other hostages are going to be taken. To trade
arms in a war in which a victory of Iran is against our
national interest is unwise," Kissinger said.
Lugar said he had discussed the administration's
activities at length with National Security Adviser
John Poindexter, but in his television appearance he
did not disclose details of those activities.
But Byrd, who is expected to be Senate majority
leader next year, told interviewers on NBC's "Meet
the Press" that he had repeatedly requested a brief
ing without success. And other Democrats, including
Sen. Sam Nunn, Sen. Patrick Leahy and Rep. Richard
Gephardt, said they still had not received any infor
mation.
