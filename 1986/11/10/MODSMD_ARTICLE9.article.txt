SANTA ANA â€” Former hostage
David Jacobsen came home yesterday
to California, embracing his aged
father, other relatives and friends who
haven't seen him since his capture by
terrorists 17 months ago.
Jacobsen's long journey home
ended when a small private jet carrying
the ex-captive, his three children and
their spouses touched down at 1:05
p.m. at John Wayne Orange County Air
port..
Jacobsen, wearing a tiny American
flag on his lapel, warmly embraced his
92-year-old father, Jacob, after stepping

off the jet and onto the tarmac.
"Dreams of this homecoming kept
me going," Jacobsen said. "The
thought of a reunion with family and
friends gave me hope. And now that
day has arrived, and I look forward to
sharing time with my loved ones.
"Faith in God has made this day a
reality."
About 20 family members and
friends, clutching red and white bal
loons, held a long banner that read:
"Welcome Uncle David. We Love You."
About 30 members of the news media
stood a dozen yards away.

Jacobsen read a brief statement to
reporters, saying he recognized their
interest in what has happened to him
but asking for time alone to spend with
his family.
"I know that you have many ques
tions," Jacobsen told reporters. "I want
to answer them, and a press confer
ence will be announced in the next day
or two. But now 1 want to share this
glorious day with the people that I love
so much that I have waited 17 months
to hug and kiss. God bless you all."
Jacobsen and family members then
boarded a hotel van and automobiles

for a private family reunion.
Banners proclaiming "Welcome
Back Dave!" and yellow ribbons graced
trees and lampposts in Jacobsen's
hometown of Huntington Beach as as
his family and friends celebrated his
freedom.
Jacobsen, the director of American
University Hospital in Beirut when he
was abducted May 28, 1985, was freed
Nov. 2 and flown to a U.S. military
hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany.
He arrived in Washington, D.C., Friday
and met with President Reagan.
