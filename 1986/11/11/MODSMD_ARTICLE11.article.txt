## Kennedyisms 
### 
My favorite Kennedyisms, taken
from University President Donald
Kennedy's last three Commence
ment speeches:
What you know matters a whole
lot less than what you can learn.
Believe firmly in your own excel
lence, but keep it strictly to your
self. ... Good performances are ac
tually enhanced when they are ac
complished in an understated way.
Nothing is so corrosive to the
spirit, nothing so discouraging to
the development of human poten
tial as the fear of failure. And con
versely, nothing is so liberating as
the knowledge that failure and its
most feared consequences are not
so very dangerous to your health
after all.
Set your own standard higher
than you can comfortably reach.
Failure is not so bad, but low aspira
tion and easy satisfaction surely are.
At a time when superficiality is al
most endemic to life, we need com
mitments that run deep.
We have to have opponents, but
we need not leave them
enemies.... It helps to grant others
the presumption of equal moral
status.
We should resist the temptation
to globalize our disagreements,

whether over an entire person or
an entire institution.
Fulfillment ought to be available,
without limitation, to all those who
lead productive, considerate, ex
amined lives.
In the end, even the most gifted
and special people are judged by
how well they perform on the
things everyone must do.
Nothing is more thoroughly satis
fying than turning one's own talent
productively to the service of
others.
Remember to touch bottom of
ten. It is difficult to retain one's con
nection with the mainstream of our
national experience when one has
been educated at a great university
(and) stamped by certification into
a leading professionâ€”
This is a great, splendid, diverse
country. Its soul is not centered in
the practice of law or medicine, nor
in the pursuit of urban high culture,
nor in a national spectrum of fads
so broad that it comfortably in
cludes nouvelle cuisine, break
dancing and Monday Night Foot
ball. Its soul resides, rather, in some
clumsily defined set of values that
blends a deep commitment to com
munities of manageable size with
an equally deep respect for the dig
nity of the individual.
If you lose touch with that, you
better go back and find it.
