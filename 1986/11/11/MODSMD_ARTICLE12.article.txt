# El Salvadoran examines terrorism
## 
### SOHAILA ABDULALI 
Terrorism Is a loaded word that is
manipulated by the U.S. government
and the media to suit their own
purposes, said Joaquin Samayoa, an El
Salvadoran graduate student who
spoke at Bechtel International Center
yesterday in the third of a series of pre
sentations on "International
Perspectives on Peace."
The talk was entitled "Terrorism:
Central America,"and Samayoa spoke
at length about the conceptual
framework necessary for any discus
sion of terrorism. Citing research by
Walter Laqueur, Christopher Pyle, Ed
ward Herman and others, he said more
than 100 definitions of terrorism have
been used during the last 50 years.
Terrorists, commandos, insurgents,
urban guerrillas, freedom fighters —
their terms are often used interchan
geably, and Samayoa said this is not be
cause of genuine confusion but be
cause governments use language for
political reasons. Politicians and
scholars refusing to include state
sponsored terrorism in their discus
sions is an example of this, he added.
The media play into the govern
ment's hands when they use terms
carelessly, Samayoa said. He asserted
that semantic manipulation
deliberately clouds reality and allows
Western governments to indulge in
terrorist violence without seeming to
do so.
For example, he said, when rebels in
El Salvador fight the government, it is
called terrorism, but when the United
States gives military aid to Nicaragua
contras, it is called retaliation or
counter-terrorism, making the United
States seem less culpable than it is.
The reason there are so many defini

tions of terrorism is that Western gov
ernments need to manipulate the word
in order to suit different situations and
explain morally inconsistent foreign
policies, according to Samayoa. He
said an example of this is the United
States' calling El Salvadoran President
Jose Napoleon Duarte's government a
dermxTatic one in spite of its use of
death squads.
Samayoa compared the govern
ments of El Salvador and Nicaragua.
Both came into power in 1979 and
were initially de facto governments, he
said, but both soon acquired
legitimacy by holding elections. In El
Salvador, the opposition could not par
ticipate in the elections, he said, and in
Nicaragua the election process was
generally fair.
In terms of external dependence of
the two nations, Nicaragua tried at least
in the beginning to diversify its eco
nomic and military dependence, with
only about a quarter of its aid from the
Soviet bloc, he pointed out. Now, as
the war intensifies, the Sandinista gov
ernment is much more dependent on
the Soviets. El Salvador, however, has
been highly dependent on the United
Suites for aid and currently receives
$1.5 million a day from this country,
Samayoa said.
In El Salvador, 50,000 people have
been killed since 1979 and at least 90
percent of the killings were directly
sanctioned by the government,
Samayoa said, adding that Sandinista
police have no record of killing or tor
turing civilians.
The United States condemns
Nicaragua for restricting its press in
some ways, Samayoa said, but does not
say anything about El Salvador, where
there are no legal restrictions on the
press, but journalists are killed.

There are many contradictions in
U.S. policy toward the two govern
ments, Samayoa said. The El Salva
doran rebel movement is based in that
country, enjoys popular support and
has an impressive human rights
record, he said, and they are consid
ered an international threat by the
West. The contras are based in several
countries, have little popular support
and a dismal human rights record and
yet are called freedom fighters, he said.
Samayoa said the United States has
never defined its strategic interests in
Nicaragua because its real intent in the
region is to make social experiments
fail so that capitalist ideology can
prevail.

He stressed the ethical considera
tions involved in the decision to use
violence. He said he had many friends
who joined the El Salvadoran rebel
movement, and none of them were
violence-loving people. They joined,
he said, because that was the only
moral choice they could make, and it
was a very painful one. We must look
beyond condemnations of those who
take up arms, and look for the reasons
they do so, he said.
Graduate students Felipe Jaramillo
of Colombia, Najib Abboud of Lebanon
and W. Maloba of Kenya responded to
Samavoa's comments.
Abboud spoke about the choices
governments make when seeking aid.

The talk was entitled "Terrorism:
Central America,"and Samayoa spoke
at length about the conceptual
framework necessary for any discus
sion of terrorism. Citing research by
Walter Laqueur, Christopher Pyle, Ed
ward Herman and others, he said more
than 100 definitions of terrorism have
been used during the last 50 years.
Terrorists, commandos, insurgents,
urban guerrillas, freedom fighters —
their terms are often used interchan
geably, and Samayoa said this is not be
cause of genuine confusion but be
cause governments use language for
political reasons. Politicians and
scholars refusing to include state
sponsored terrorism in their discus
sions is an example of this, he added.
The media play into the govern
ment's hands when they use terms
carelessly, Samayoa said. He asserted
that semantic manipulation
deliberately clouds reality and allows
Western governments to indulge in
terrorist violence without seeming to
do so.
For example, he said, when rebels in
El Salvador fight the government, it is
called terrorism, but when the United
States gives military aid to Nicaragua
contras, it is called retaliation or
counter-terrorism, making the United
States seem less culpable than it is.
The reason there are so many defini

tions of terrorism is that Western gov
ernments need to manipulate the word
in order to suit different situations and
explain morally inconsistent foreign
policies, according to Samayoa. He
said an example of this is the United
States' calling El Salvadoran President
Jose Napoleon Duarte's government a
dermxTatic one in spite of its use of
death squads.
Samayoa compared the govern
ments of El Salvador and Nicaragua.
Both came into power in 1979 and
were initially de facto governments, he
said, but both soon acquired
legitimacy by holding elections. In El
Salvador, the opposition could not par
ticipate in the elections, he said, and in
Nicaragua the election process was
generally fair.
In terms of external dependence of
the two nations, Nicaragua tried at least
in the beginning to diversify its eco
nomic and military dependence, with
only about a quarter of its aid from the
Soviet bloc, he pointed out. Now, as
the war intensifies, the Sandinista gov
ernment is much more dependent on
the Soviets. El Salvador, however, has
been highly dependent on the United
Suites for aid and currently receives
$1.5 million a day from this country,
Samayoa said.
In El Salvador, 50,000 people have
been killed since 1979 and at least 90
percent of the killings were directly
sanctioned by the government,
Samayoa said, adding that Sandinista
police have no record of killing or tor
turing civilians.
The United States condemns
Nicaragua for restricting its press in
some ways, Samayoa said, but does not
say anything about El Salvador, where
there are no legal restrictions on the
press, but journalists are killed.

There are many contradictions in
U.S. policy toward the two govern
ments, Samayoa said. The El Salva
doran rebel movement is based in that
country, enjoys popular support and
has an impressive human rights
record, he said, and they are consid
ered an international threat by the
West. The contras are based in several
countries, have little popular support
and a dismal human rights record and
yet are called freedom fighters, he said.
Samayoa said the United States has
never defined its strategic interests in
Nicaragua because its real intent in the
region is to make social experiments
fail so that capitalist ideology can
prevail.

He stressed the ethical considera
tions involved in the decision to use
violence. He said he had many friends
who joined the El Salvadoran rebel
movement, and none of them were
violence-loving people. They joined,
he said, because that was the only
moral choice they could make, and it
was a very painful one. We must look
beyond condemnations of those who
take up arms, and look for the reasons
they do so, he said.
Graduate students Felipe Jaramillo
of Colombia, Najib Abboud of Lebanon
and W. Maloba of Kenya responded to
Samavoa's comments.
Abboud spoke about the choices
governments make when seeking aid.
