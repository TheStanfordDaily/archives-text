In its recent bargain with Iran, the Reagan administra
tion has discovered a fact it has chosen to ignore for the
last few years — that sometimes, under some circum
stances, when the stakes are high, it must negotiate
with terrorists holding U.S. hostages. There is a lot to be
lost by giving the world the impression that the country
can be pushed around by terrorists, but there is more to
be lost by maintaining a policy of never negotiating un
der any circumstances. It is simply reality that terrorism
can bring a small group of armed radicals to a position of
temporary equality with a powerful nation like the
United States.
The administration in recent days has found itself
caught between a popular cry to negotiate to free
hostages held by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad in Beirut
and its own stated policy of never negotiating with ter
rorists. The White House chose to follow the cry for
freedom by selling arms to Iran in exchange for that
country's help in winning the release of the hostages. But
it made the wrong choice, even though the strategy was
successful in freeing Eric Jacobsen, one of six hostages
held in Beirut. Not only did the administration ap
parently not consult Secretary of State George Shultz,
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and congres
sional leader before making such a major shift in U.S.
policy, but it apparently chose not to consider in a
broader picture what providing weapons to a country
such as Iran might do to national security and long-term
U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf.
First, the shipments of weapons — which have been
made since at least last spring, according to a Danish

shipping union — can only help prolong an already
deadly, protracted war between Iran and Iraq. Both
countries have had difficulty finding weapons and man
power to keep their war machines alive.
Second, the sales violate a U.S. commitment to
neutrality in the war. One wonders, though, how the ad
ministration could provide such an important comodity
to a nation that has proven fervently anti-American and
held 44 Americans hostage for more than a year.
In the larger scope, the sale could contribute to the
destabilization of the entire region — an area in which
the United States has vital interests. The Iran-Iraq war has
already intimidated the oil trade for years. Prolonging
the conflict is in no one's interests.
The sale also undercuts U.S. pleas that other countries
not sell arms to either combatant, on the theory that the
two will end the bloody war for sheer lack of resources.
In a recent trip to China, Weinberger urged that county's
government to stop selling weapons to Iran. "I wonder
what the Chinese think now," a Pentagon official said to
the New York Times.
Finally, the sale was wrong because of the way in
which it was carried out. The move has resulted in
rumors of Shultz's resignation, in outrage and demands
for an investigation by members of Congress and in a
loss of confidence among U.S. allies in Europe.
Political reality is that sometimes a nation must lower
itself to negotiate with terrorists if it ever wants to free its
countrymen. But political reality also is that a country
does not sacrifice its vital, long-term interests, the lives of
countless people in other countries and its own political
stability for the sake of a short-term gain.
