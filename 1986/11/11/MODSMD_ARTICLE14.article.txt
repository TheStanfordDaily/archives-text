Reading our campus newspaper can
be quite enlightening. Chris Adam
son's column (Daily, Nov. 4) spells out
how to create a campus controversy.
This brilliant essay insists that one
should not mind "being vague."
Amazing, as one might expect
"Boycott Grapes" to be a more effec
tive position than "Boycott Round
Green Things" or "Boycott Food."
Also, in the interest of sustaining
"reader interest" he suggests writing
which will be "misperceive(d) ... (as)
of a more radical nature." Once more,
be vague, then your statements will be
all the more easily misunderstood,
one supposes.
Then we have Scott Schulz extolling
the virtues of Zen Buddhism as a
study technique (Daily, Nov. 5).
Despite the fact that "fundamental
Buddhism cannot be understood
intellectually" (so why write about it?
— because "it has some nifty things to
say aboui life" even though you
presumably will never understand
what they are, since understanding is
an intellectual excercise) he presents
us with data.
Datum one, "A tree if divorced from
everything around it is no longer a
tree." Fascinating. So a tree floating in
outer space is something other than a
tree? Now I see why Buddhism will
never be understood intellectually.
Datum two, "(A person) was just
sitting there with the critter (a black
squirrel) eating its lunch on her lap as
if this were the most natural thing in
the world — which, after all, it was."
Incredible, the things Buddhism
shows us. I would have thought that a
squirrel tame enough to sit on some
human's lap was quite unnatural, due
to the destruction of its "natural"
predators by man.
He follows this last gem by saying,

"I can't put it better than that," which
leads me to believe he is taking con
troversy lessons from Mr. Adamson.
So, dear readers, it is obvious that
since "everything is an approxima
tion," we should not be very choosy
about what the approximation is. No,
that is not the case. Reason,
intellectual understanding and clear
argument with specific complaints are
the only methods which produce
results consistent with reality.

Voter registration
is not too difficult
'nanviwt..
You are so right. The voter registra
tion process is complicated (Daily,
Nov. 6). Let's see. First you must get a
registration form. That means calling
the county voter registration office
and having one mailed to you. But if
you don't know whom to call, you
have to be able to call the public
library or the League of Women
Voters. So, first one must know that
public libraries exist and how to dial a
phone. Plus, if you can't speak, you
must be able to write for a form.
Whew!
So, now you have the registration
form. Remember, you must return it
one month before Election Day, so
that means knowing the date of the
election and how many days there are
in one month. Gosh, my head is spin
ning already!
Now you have to fill out the form.
To do so, you need to know your
name (high school education neces
sary), birthdate (undergraduate level),
street address (graduate level) and
county of residency (postgraduate
research a must). And if all that isn't
hard enough, you need to mail it
back, and that means knowing where

the nearest mailbox is!
Let's stop for a minute and sum
marize what we need to know to
register to vote:
• Public libraries exist.
• The date of Election Day.
• How many days there are in one
month.
• Your name.
• Your birthdate.
• Your street address and county of
residency.
• The location of the nearest mailbox.
• How to use a phone.
This isn't a voter registration
process, it's an intelligence test that
only 40 percent of all Americans can
pass. Now does this mean there is
something wrong with the registration
profess, or is there .something wrong
with the majority of Americans?

Applauding the
banning of Band
I'm pleased that (Athletic Director)
Andy Geiger had the guts to ban the
Band. LSJUMB's creative anarchy used
to be a real asset to Stanford games.
However, in the past two years,
halftime has degenerated into embar
rassingly sophomoric and pointless
routines with fourth-grade bathroom
humor. This tiresome situation has,
unfortunately, been coupled with
apathetic, self-indulgent musical per
formances. When the Band can't even
get together to blast out a satisfying
"All Right Now," you know we're in
trouble. Come on, "guys," you're out
there for a reason — don't come back
until you've figured out what that is.
