# The 						terrible plight of Soviet Jews
## 
### 
I traveled this summer in Europe for 30 days. My
four days in Russia are etched in my memory forever.
I learned things about life in Russia that tourists
aren't meant to find out. Specifically, I learned about
prejudice and discrimination against Jews in the So
viet Union, facts that I must tell others about — facts
that I've promised to tell others about.

Because I am Jewish, I was sought out by Russian
Jews on the street, in museums and on the bus to be
told the true stories of the treatment of Jews in Rus
sia. I had several secret rendezvous with one Jewish
man, Ivan, and had opportunities to talk with three
others. In Russia, the people are forbidden to talk
with foreigners, so our meetings were done in
hushed voices or in quiet places, always watching for
police.
In the Soviet Union, Jews are considered lesser
people, reminiscent of the attitude toward American
blacks. Jews are not allowed into universities to
study; they can only go to technical schools. Once a
man called Ivan told me that he had lieen denied ad
mission to university and thus had gone to a techni
cal school. Clearly he was very intelligent and ed
ucated beyond the realm of a technical school; he
spoke English and French fluently and had tegun to
study psychology at the graduate level by himself.
Many Jews in Russia are forced to opt for self
education.
I was also told that to appease the Western press
many Jews had been admitted to universities. As soon
as the press lost interest, these Jews were flunked
out. The reason Jews are not allowed a higher educa
tion is that organizations, businesses and commit

tees, to remain respected in society, must not have
any Jews working for them. If a Jew is allowed a
noteworthy position, it detracts from the respec
tability of that business.
But, more generally, Jews are treated with blatant
discrimination by other Russians. Prejudice is pres
ent from childhood through adulthood and is in
grained in society. Ivan recalled being aware of dis
crimination as a young child when he was singled
out in his neighborhood as a Jew unable to play with
most of the other children because their parents
forbade it. The non-Jewish Russians to whom I spoke,
mainly teenagers, could not explain why Jews were
not as gtxxJ as Russians. One 20-year-old student ex
plained the basis for this prejudice: "It's just that
they're Jews." No other explanation seemed neces
sary (Judaism is considered a nationality in Russia
and stamped on one's identification papers at birth).
Jews are not supposed to worship in Russia. There
are synagogues in Russia which really exist for the
Western tourists to see and say, "Jews have freedom
in this country .'' The truth is that although Jews at
tend services in these synagogues, they do so at great
risk. Ivan took me to one such synagogue in
Leningrad and pointed out many of his friends to me.
He explained that if the KGB ever decided to come
and identify- those Jews they would certainly lose
their jobs or worse Most keep their interest in reli
gion quiet. I was told that in Russia the only accepted
religion is communism. The media will never print
information or calendars with dates of the Jewish
holidays; lxx>ks about Judaism are illegally brought
into the country by kind tourists. Yet, hundreds of
Jews fill the synagoges to worship on high holy days.
Information about the holidays is passed from one
Jew to another. Each of the Jews to whom I spoke
reminded me that Rosh Hashanah was soon ap
proaching and confirmed the date with me.

Many of the Jews I met at the synagogue were
"refusniks." These people have applied for
emigration— as many Jews in the country do — and
have been turned down. In fact, none of them is
currently allowed to emigrate. Once they are
branded refusnik, they are no longer able to get a
decent job regardless of their level o^ education. I
was introduced to one man with the equivalent edu
cation of a Ph.D. in theology who was given a job as a
night watchman. In fact, he had just lost that job be
cause he chose to be called by his Hebrew name in
stead of his Russian name. To be a Jew in addition to
being a refusenik is like being double-cursed. These
people are watched and monitored by the KGB. "Big
brother is watching you" is no joke in Russia. I was
asked by several people to mail letters or call loved
ones in the United States just to say hello, since they
couldn't be sure their mail ever left the country.
But the real reason I'm writing this article is to be
sure people know about the true situation that exists
in Russia. I can only hope that reading this "personal
experience'" written by a fellow student will have a
greater impact than an article written by a foreign
correspondent for Newsweek or Time. I was asked
many times to "tell my friends" about this situation
with the hope that we Americans will feel outraged
enough to tell our government that we do not ap
prove of this situation Something must be done to
allow Soviet Jews to emigrate We must not believe
Soviet propaganda that Jews are treated well in the
Soviet Union.
When I said goodbye to Ivan, he thanked me for
listening and then looked me in the eyes, raised his
fist and said, "Remember." A friend sitting next to me
whispered to herself, "How could she forget?"
