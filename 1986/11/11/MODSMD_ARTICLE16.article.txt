# No more biking for I. G.
## 
### 
I unexpectedly received a phone call from the Invisible
Girl a few days ago. Unexpected because it was at 10 a.m.
and the Invisible Girl never rises before noon if she can
help it.
"1.G.!" I exclaimed. "What a pleasant surprise. How was
your Halloween?"
"The same old thing," she said. "I went as an echo and
walked around the Castro. Stopped in at DVB for a little
while."
"How was that?"
"Crowded. Armand didn't like it, said he was afraid he
was going to lose me. I swear once I saw him talking to thin
air, he said he'd heard an echo there. Honestly. I suppose
he'd been drinking too much absinthe again, but it drives
me crazy. I think he just does it to bug me."

Now you know something's really wrong with I.G. when
she starts to complain about Armand. We all know Armand
is the most beautiful, most intelligent, most charming, and
particularly, most extravagant man I.G.'s ever been out with.
Possibly the most perfect specimen of humanity in the
whole of G-d's Bay Area. So I said, "1.G., what's eating you?"
"I can never hide anything from you, Gwen," she said.
"Someone stole my bike."
"Oh no! Not your purple bike! Do you think you'll get it
back again?"
"Not this time, they stole it right out of our garage. I hate
people, don't you? I feel so ... so ... violated."
Now the Invisible Girl's bike was not just any bike, but a
Schwinn Varsity circa 1978, flamingo-colored. Several things
are significant about this, namely: 1. The bike was a shade of
purple, which, because it is the only color I.G. manages to
remain visible in, allowed her to cast a faint outline or
shadow as she rode. This was very important to her as occa
sionally the sight of a seemingly riderless bicycle coasting
down Hamilton had caused minor driving accidents. 2. The
flamingo color, of which the importance is now understood,
was manufactured for but two short years before Schwinn
changed its mind, and 3. I.G. had had the bike since junior
high and had sentimental attachments to it.
Thus, the bike was irreplaceable. It had been stolen
several times before but usually from campus. There didn't
seem much chance of ever seeing it again now that it had
been taken from her garage.
I.G. wailed, "I'm going to take out a full page ad in The
Daily. I'm going to send spies to every used bicycle shop on
the peninsula. I'm going to go on a hunger strike!"
Maybe a hunger strike is going a little too far. But if you're
invisible, objects are the first thing other people will notice
about you. If you're not invisible, objects ... are often the
first thing other people notice about you. Armand's ex

girlfriend Mary Ann is always referred to as "the girl with too
many bracelets"; my friend Cattrine is often referred to as
"the girl with the big black hair." But OK, appearances
aren't quite the same as objects. Objects have a separate
existence ... I.G.'s purple bike could stand quietly outside
the Bookstore while she was inside buying Gummy Bears.
Cattrine's hair can't do that.
"I can't imagine it," said I.G. "My powers of conception
are too limited. Life without my purple bike." We were
making progress. She had gone from hysteria to sulkiness.
"1.G.," I said, "You will still be you without your purple
bike, after all."
"I'm not so sure," she said. Then she said, "I hope they're
treating it we 11... wherever they are."
Of course it's silly to love objects, which cannot love you
back, but we all do it... we see some of our things as exten
sions of ourselves, and when they are taken, it's like, as I.G.
said, a violation. OK, Bee says, reading my column avidly,
hoping to be mentioned by name again. Are you telling me
to be more careful with my things, or not to love them too
much? I can see it now ... the title of my first best-seller...
"Women Who Love Objects Too Much."
I'm too materialistic to tell you not to love objects.
Indeed, there's something kind of fabulous about projecting
yourself into every single object you own ... like the com
mercial where the woman identifies herself by a blank note
with a spray of her perfume... "Your Windsong stays on my
mind." The consistency of taste can be a beautiful thing.
I.G.'s notes in purple ink, her purple sunglasses, and once
upon a time, her purple bike ... Oscar Wilde's great green
overcoat.. Annie Lennox's orange hair ... it's nice to have
a signature piece. .But you say Annie Lennox no longer has
orange hair? Hmmm.
Remember Billy Joel's song, "Just the Way You Are?" It al
ways struck me as a little sinister. I think it would have been
a lot more romantic if he'd said, "Go ahead, shave your hair
off, play punk at our wedding, speak pig Latin to my mother,
get heavily 'into' Richie Rich comic books... I will still love
you, Any Way You Are."
But I.G. is still grieving. "Listen, 1.G.," I said. "All My Kids
is on in five minutes, and I want to watch. Deal. You can af
ford to buy another bike."
"It won't be the same," she said.
"It never is," I said.
"I didn't even ask you, how was your Halloween? Did you
really go as a Druze militiaman?"
"I couldn't find a machine gun," I said.
"Aha."
I saw what she was getting at. "OK, so I suppose it is possi
ble to be a Druze militiaman even without a machine gun,
but nobody would have known what I was."
"So what?" she said. "You could tell them."
Which is annoying, and not always successful, but not,
after all, the worst thing in the world.
I said to 1.G., "Hey, it's not so terrible. Maybe Armand will
buy you a purple scooter."
'Yeah,' she said. "I wish. Can't you just see me on a
purple scooter?"
Well, no. But such are the perils of invisibility.

'Yeah,' she said. "I wish. Can't you just see me on a
purple scooter?"
Well, no. But such are the perils of invisibility.

I unexpectedly received a phone call from the Invisible
Girl a few days ago. Unexpected because it was at 10 a.m.
and the Invisible Girl never rises before noon if she can
help it.
"1.G.!" I exclaimed. "What a pleasant surprise. How was
your Halloween?"
"The same old thing," she said. "I went as an echo and
walked around the Castro. Stopped in at DVB for a little
while."
"How was that?"
"Crowded. Armand didn't like it, said he was afraid he
was going to lose me. I swear once I saw him talking to thin
air, he said he'd heard an echo there. Honestly. I suppose
he'd been drinking too much absinthe again, but it drives
me crazy. I think he just does it to bug me."

Now you know something's really wrong with I.G. when
she starts to complain about Armand. We all know Armand
is the most beautiful, most intelligent, most charming, and
particularly, most extravagant man I.G.'s ever been out with.
Possibly the most perfect specimen of humanity in the
whole of G-d's Bay Area. So I said, "1.G., what's eating you?"
"I can never hide anything from you, Gwen," she said.
"Someone stole my bike."
"Oh no! Not your purple bike! Do you think you'll get it
back again?"
"Not this time, they stole it right out of our garage. I hate
people, don't you? I feel so ... so ... violated."
Now the Invisible Girl's bike was not just any bike, but a
Schwinn Varsity circa 1978, flamingo-colored. Several things
are significant about this, namely: 1. The bike was a shade of
purple, which, because it is the only color I.G. manages to
remain visible in, allowed her to cast a faint outline or
shadow as she rode. This was very important to her as occa
sionally the sight of a seemingly riderless bicycle coasting
down Hamilton had caused minor driving accidents. 2. The
flamingo color, of which the importance is now understood,
was manufactured for but two short years before Schwinn
changed its mind, and 3. I.G. had had the bike since junior
high and had sentimental attachments to it.
Thus, the bike was irreplaceable. It had been stolen
several times before but usually from campus. There didn't
seem much chance of ever seeing it again now that it had
been taken from her garage.
I.G. wailed, "I'm going to take out a full page ad in The
Daily. I'm going to send spies to every used bicycle shop on
the peninsula. I'm going to go on a hunger strike!"
Maybe a hunger strike is going a little too far. But if you're
invisible, objects are the first thing other people will notice
about you. If you're not invisible, objects ... are often the
first thing other people notice about you. Armand's ex

girlfriend Mary Ann is always referred to as "the girl with too
many bracelets"; my friend Cattrine is often referred to as
"the girl with the big black hair." But OK, appearances
aren't quite the same as objects. Objects have a separate
existence ... I.G.'s purple bike could stand quietly outside
the Bookstore while she was inside buying Gummy Bears.
Cattrine's hair can't do that.
"I can't imagine it," said I.G. "My powers of conception
are too limited. Life without my purple bike." We were
making progress. She had gone from hysteria to sulkiness.
"1.G.," I said, "You will still be you without your purple
bike, after all."
"I'm not so sure," she said. Then she said, "I hope they're
treating it we 11... wherever they are."
Of course it's silly to love objects, which cannot love you
back, but we all do it... we see some of our things as exten
sions of ourselves, and when they are taken, it's like, as I.G.
said, a violation. OK, Bee says, reading my column avidly,
hoping to be mentioned by name again. Are you telling me
to be more careful with my things, or not to love them too
much? I can see it now ... the title of my first best-seller...
"Women Who Love Objects Too Much."
I'm too materialistic to tell you not to love objects.
Indeed, there's something kind of fabulous about projecting
yourself into every single object you own ... like the com
mercial where the woman identifies herself by a blank note
with a spray of her perfume... "Your Windsong stays on my
mind." The consistency of taste can be a beautiful thing.
I.G.'s notes in purple ink, her purple sunglasses, and once
upon a time, her purple bike ... Oscar Wilde's great green
overcoat.. Annie Lennox's orange hair ... it's nice to have
a signature piece. .But you say Annie Lennox no longer has
orange hair? Hmmm.
Remember Billy Joel's song, "Just the Way You Are?" It al
ways struck me as a little sinister. I think it would have been
a lot more romantic if he'd said, "Go ahead, shave your hair
off, play punk at our wedding, speak pig Latin to my mother,
get heavily 'into' Richie Rich comic books... I will still love
you, Any Way You Are."
But I.G. is still grieving. "Listen, 1.G.," I said. "All My Kids
is on in five minutes, and I want to watch. Deal. You can af
ford to buy another bike."
"It won't be the same," she said.
"It never is," I said.
"I didn't even ask you, how was your Halloween? Did you
really go as a Druze militiaman?"
"I couldn't find a machine gun," I said.
"Aha."
I saw what she was getting at. "OK, so I suppose it is possi
ble to be a Druze militiaman even without a machine gun,
but nobody would have known what I was."
"So what?" she said. "You could tell them."
Which is annoying, and not always successful, but not,
after all, the worst thing in the world.
I said to 1.G., "Hey, it's not so terrible. Maybe Armand will
buy you a purple scooter."
'Yeah,' she said. "I wish. Can't you just see me on a
purple scooter?"
Well, no. But such are the perils of invisibility.
