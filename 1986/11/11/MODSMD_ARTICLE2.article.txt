# 20 arrested in animal rights protest rally
## 
### KRISTIN BARENDSEN Staff writer 
Twenty people protesting the
"torture" and "vivisection" of animals
in research laboratories were arrested
by Stanford police in a demonstration
in front of President Kennedy's office
yesterday.
The crowd; numbering about 80,
blocked the entrance and exit to Ken
nedy's office and refused to let faculty
members have free access to the build
ing. Protestors sang, chanted
"President Kennedy, what are you
hiding?" and played tapes of the
howling of neglected puppies in a
pound.
On behalf of the University, Bob
Beyers, director of the News Bureau,
spoke to the news media outside Ken
nedy's office. "The bottom line is that
(the protestors) want discontinuation
of all research. Without research, it is
impossible to make any advances in
medicine."
Protest coordinator Elliot Katz
responded, "This is their way of paint
ing the issue black and white. We are
not asking for research to end. We are
asking for frequent inspections by
federal agencies, and for useless ex
perimentation to cease. It's like slavery.
If we don't try to end it, it will never
end."
The protesters, most of whom were
senior citizens and students from the
Bay Area, met at the Stanford Shopping
Center and marched slowly down Palm
Drive to the Psychology Department,
carrying signs reading, "Their pain and
Stiffl&fing" fST our evil" and 'Three Of a
kind: Sexism, Racism Speciesism."
They paused to distribute leaflets in
front of the Psychology Department,
where researchers conduct numerous

experiments on animals before they
reached their target in the Quad.
Arrests included Raymond Giraud,
emeritus professor of French at Stan
ford, and Katz, president of In Defense
of Animals (IDA). No Stanford students
were arrested.
Katz, a veterinary practitioner,
founded IDA in August of 1983 to
"speak on behalf of defenseless
animals." He sued the Federal Govern
ment in 1984 for funding "cruel and
unnecessary" animal research pro
grams at UC-Berkeley in a lawsuit up
wards of $10 million. The federal gov
ernment in turn sued Berkeley. Katz
said he would consider suing the
federal government again, if evidence
uncovered at Stanford research
facilities proved such action necessary.
Katz said that IDA's main question to
Stanford is, "What goes on behind
those locked doors? We have well
documented proof that these animals
are subject to negligence and cruelty.
We want to gain free, unscheduled
access to the laboratories."
IDA organized a similar march to the
Psychology Department on April 24,
when 19 people were arrested for
trespassing. Seven of these 19 will be
brought to trial Monday. They face
either a six-month jail sentence or a
$1,000 bail fine.
Simultaneous protests coordinated
by IDA on Oct. 22 ended in 44 arrests
at UC-Berkeley and 27 arrests at UCLA.
The University responded to the
April 24th incident with a letter from
Dr. Thomas Hamm, on behalf of Presi
dent Kennedy. Hamm, director of the
Division of Laboratory Animal
Medicine, said that the "indisputable
fact is that research with animals has
been absolutely essential in the devel
opment of man's basic knowledge of

biology." Hamm said that he found in
cidences of inhumane treatment of lab
animals when he came to the Univer
sity two-and-a-half years ago, despite
claims made by IDA that he was hired
as a way to shift blame into new hands.
However, he acknowledged that the
"physical facilities were bad" when he
joined the University's staff.
A $12 million state-of-the-art under
ground animal care facility is sched
uled to be completed by late summer
of 1988.
In 1986, Stanford spent millions of
dollars in federal funding on the pur
chase and care of research animals.
Ninety percent of these animals are
mice, most of which are bred in the
laboratories, according to Hamm. Re
searchers use 50,000 mice each year, as
well as approximately 5,000 dogs, cats
and monkeys.
Hamm said that during ex

perimentation, the "animals are always
anesthetized." He denied claims that
the researchers have made cocaine ad
dicts out of monkeys or alcoholics out
of mice.
In response to protestors' cries of
"dialogue now," Hamm replied that
"there is free dialogue if the IDA were
willing to talk. We offer tours of our
laboratories to anyone who schedules
an appointment." In addition, he said
that the USDA makes unannounced in
spections relatively often, and an ethics
panel of 12 members reviews every ex
periment before it is funded.
Hamm said he felt that yesterday's
protest would have "no effect" on
future projects.
Vicki Markham, a protestor who
runs a support group for people upset
by cruelty to animals, claimed that no

sity President Donald Kennedy's office.
inspections are made of the facilities
because of funding cuts by President
Reagan.
She mentioned the case of Snowball,
a dog who was anesthetized and left to
starve at a Palo Alto animal care clinic.
Those responsible for the starvation
and mutilation of Snowball were taken
to trial but released on a technicality.
Demonstrators carried graphic
pictures of Snowball's bleeding limbs.
However, as Hamm poointed out, that
incident was not linked to Stanford in
any way.
Citing the well-publicized psycho
logical experiments on monkeys con
ducted by Stanford research prof. Dr.
Seymour Levine, Katz said that "many
of the experiments are senseless and
frivolous. We need to move toward
technologies that don't slaughter
animals."
According to Hamm, such alterna
tives are being aggressively inves
tigated, chiefly because of the high cost
of animal care. Tissue samples are
sometimes substituted for live subjects,
but their usefulness is limited.
"We would be satisfied if we had a
meaningful look" into the facilities,
Green Librarian Lise Giraud, wife of
Raymond Giraud, said. "Today we will
see Stanford at its best. The public
doesn't know what a big business this
is."
Before his arrest, Giraud said: "We
have very reliable evidence that a 'gag'
order has been issued to medical stu
dents." Hamm denied that such an or
der had been given but noted that
medical students would probably not
speak to protestors. "It would be silly
to argue with them," he said.

President Kennedy remained out of
his office all day. No appointment for
dialogue with IDA members was
scheduled, despite a written request by
IDA sent two weeks ago. Michael Jack
son, assistant to the Provost, spoke to
demonstrators on behalf of the office.
"1 don't handle President Kennedy's
appointments," he said.

The demonstration ended shortly
before 3 p.m., when police made the
arrests and dispersed the rest of the
crowd. Those arrested were booked
and released. Among the arrests was a

at UC-Berkeley and 27 arrests at UCLA.
The University responded to the
April 24th incident with a letter from
Dr. Thomas Hamm, on behalf of Presi
dent Kennedy. Hamm, director of the
Division of Laboratory Animal
Medicine, said that the "indisputable
fact is that research with animals has
been absolutely essential in the devel
opment of man's basic knowledge of

biology." Hamm said that he found in
cidences of inhumane treatment of lab
animals when he came to the Univer
sity two-and-a-half years ago, despite
claims made by IDA that he was hired
as a way to shift blame into new hands.
However, he acknowledged that the
"physical facilities were bad" when he
joined the University's staff.
A $12 million state-of-the-art under
ground animal care facility is sched
uled to be completed by late summer
of 1988.
In 1986, Stanford spent millions of
dollars in federal funding on the pur
chase and care of research animals.
Ninety percent of these animals are
mice, most of which are bred in the
laboratories, according to Hamm. Re
searchers use 50,000 mice each year, as
well as approximately 5,000 dogs, cats
and monkeys.
Hamm said that during ex

perimentation, the "animals are always
anesthetized." He denied claims that
the researchers have made cocaine ad
dicts out of monkeys or alcoholics out
of mice.
In response to protestors' cries of
"dialogue now," Hamm replied that
"there is free dialogue if the IDA were
willing to talk. We offer tours of our
laboratories to anyone who schedules
an appointment." In addition, he said
that the USDA makes unannounced in
spections relatively often, and an ethics
panel of 12 members reviews every ex
periment before it is funded.
Hamm said he felt that yesterday's
protest would have "no effect" on
future projects.
Vicki Markham, a protestor who
runs a support group for people upset
by cruelty to animals, claimed that no

inspections are made of the facilities
because of funding cuts by President
Reagan.
She mentioned the case of Snowball,
a dog who was anesthetized and left to
starve at a Palo Alto animal care clinic.
Those responsible for the starvation
and mutilation of Snowball were taken
to trial but released on a technicality.
Demonstrators carried graphic
pictures of Snowball's bleeding limbs.
However, as Hamm poointed out, that
incident was not linked to Stanford in
any way.
Citing the well-publicized psycho
logical experiments on monkeys con
ducted by Stanford research prof. Dr.
Seymour Levine, Katz said that "many
of the experiments are senseless and
frivolous. We need to move toward
technologies that don't slaughter
animals."
According to Hamm, such alterna
tives are being aggressively inves
tigated, chiefly because of the high cost
of animal care. Tissue samples are
sometimes substituted for live subjects,
but their usefulness is limited.
"We would be satisfied if we had a
meaningful look" into the facilities,
Green Librarian Lise Giraud, wife of
Raymond Giraud, said. "Today we will
see Stanford at its best. The public
doesn't know what a big business this
is."
Before his arrest, Giraud said: "We
have very reliable evidence that a 'gag'
order has been issued to medical stu
dents." Hamm denied that such an or
der had been given but noted that
medical students would probably not
speak to protestors. "It would be silly
to argue with them," he said.

President Kennedy remained out of
his office all day. No appointment for
dialogue with IDA members was
scheduled, despite a written request by
IDA sent two weeks ago. Michael Jack
son, assistant to the Provost, spoke to
demonstrators on behalf of the office.
"1 don't handle President Kennedy's
appointments," he said.

The demonstration ended shortly
before 3 p.m., when police made the
arrests and dispersed the rest of the
crowd. Those arrested were booked
and released. Among the arrests was a
blind woman with her guide dog. The
woman said that she participated be

Twenty people protesting the
"torture" and "vivisection" of animals
in research laboratories were arrested
by Stanford police in a demonstration
in front of President Kennedy's office
yesterday.
The crowd; numbering about 80,
blocked the entrance and exit to Ken
nedy's office and refused to let faculty
members have free access to the build
ing. Protestors sang, chanted
"President Kennedy, what are you
hiding?" and played tapes of the
howling of neglected puppies in a
pound.
On behalf of the University, Bob
Beyers, director of the News Bureau,
spoke to the news media outside Ken
nedy's office. "The bottom line is that
(the protestors) want discontinuation
of all research. Without research, it is
impossible to make any advances in
medicine."
Protest coordinator Elliot Katz
responded, "This is their way of paint
ing the issue black and white. We are
not asking for research to end. We are
asking for frequent inspections by
federal agencies, and for useless ex
perimentation to cease. It's like slavery.
If we don't try to end it, it will never
end."
The protesters, most of whom were
senior citizens and students from the
Bay Area, met at the Stanford Shopping
Center and marched slowly down Palm
Drive to the Psychology Department,
carrying signs reading, "Their pain and
Stiffl&fing" fST our evil" and 'Three Of a
kind: Sexism, Racism Speciesism."
They paused to distribute leaflets in
front of the Psychology Department,
where researchers conduct numerous

experiments on animals before they
reached their target in the Quad.
Arrests included Raymond Giraud,
emeritus professor of French at Stan
ford, and Katz, president of In Defense
of Animals (IDA). No Stanford students
were arrested.
Katz, a veterinary practitioner,
founded IDA in August of 1983 to
"speak on behalf of defenseless
animals." He sued the Federal Govern
ment in 1984 for funding "cruel and
unnecessary" animal research pro
grams at UC-Berkeley in a lawsuit up
wards of $10 million. The federal gov
ernment in turn sued Berkeley. Katz
said he would consider suing the
federal government again, if evidence
uncovered at Stanford research
facilities proved such action necessary.
Katz said that IDA's main question to
Stanford is, "What goes on behind
those locked doors? We have well
documented proof that these animals
are subject to negligence and cruelty.
We want to gain free, unscheduled
access to the laboratories."
IDA organized a similar march to the
Psychology Department on April 24,
when 19 people were arrested for
trespassing. Seven of these 19 will be
brought to trial Monday. They face
either a six-month jail sentence or a
$1,000 bail fine.
