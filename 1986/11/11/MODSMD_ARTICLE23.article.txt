## Ask not for whom the structure's on the Knoll 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
In days long past it stood alone on the hill, a grand
fortress commanding the University. Its grounds ran out
uninterrupted in all directions — down to the shores of
Lagunita on one side and the homes of Mayfield on the
other, back to the foothills behind and away to the Quad in
front.
And the building's purpose justified its grandeur: It was
the home of the University president and a reception center
for various University functions.
These days the Knoll, now home for the Center for Com
puter Research in Music and Acoustics, has lost much of its
splendor, its exterior dulled by the years and its grounds
receding in the face of encroaching dormitory clusters fore
and aft.
But it remains one of the most eye-grabbing structures on
campus, and it has a history to match its appearance.
If the building is faintly reminiscent of a haunted house,
then its ghosts are those of some of the earliest residents of
Palo Alto. Long before Leland Stanford Sr. laid out his Uni
versity on its present grounds, the area was ranch land, and
the hill on which the Knoll now stands was a cemetery for
the families who worked and lived on the ranches.
According to records in the Stanford University Archives,
the first person buried there was the original landowner,
David Adams, who died in 1855 when he was thrown from
his horse in Mayfield, the small town that is now south Palo
Alto.
Eventually, the hill, called Cemetery Hill, became the final
(or so they thought) resting place for at least 15 people who
are now considered to have been among the earliest
Americans to settle in Palo Alto.
When Leland Stanford established his farm and later the
University named for his son on the surrounding land, the
cemetery was largely ignored, although it was known to ex
ist.
In 1908, a student prank catalyzed the University's desire
to move the bodies and put the land to new use. On an April
night that year, three Stanford fraternity men ("slightly un
der the influence," according to a 1952 article in the Palo
Alto Times) came up with the bright idea of removing one
of the skeletons from the graveyard and bringing it back to
the fraternity house. The pranksters were able to dig down
to an iron casket, but discovering that the casket was too
heavy to lift, they fled the scene.
The open grave, discovered the next day, caused quite a
stir, but the events of the night before remained a mystery
for 48 years, until one of the culprits came forth and
confessed the incident to the Palo Alto Times.
In the meantime, the University, wishing to avoid any fur
ther abuse of the abandoned cemetery and wishing to build
on the site, ordered that the bodies be exhumed and
moved. In early May, 1908, the remains were removed and
reburied at Alta Mesa Cemetery in Palo Alto.
The site remained vacant until early 1916, when the
Board of Trustees decided to build a home for the Univer
sity president there. Until that time, there had been no offi
cial home for the school's head. A number of sites were con
sidered for the new home, but Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, for whom the new home was to be built, made it clear
that their preference was for the spot on what was called
Lagunita Hill.
Eminent San Francisco architect Louis Christian Mullgardt
was contracted to design the home. His plan, in Spanish
Gothic style, was slighdy controversial — what one observer

called "a monumental fortress with wings extending at
obtuse angles, embracing the knoll. What it lacked in good
practical considerations was masked by its festive air. A re
quest by the trustees to have the house erected of rein
forced concrete created a resounding tomb."
Ground was broken in late 1916, but wartime delays and
other difficulties stalled its completion until 1918.
Built at a cost of $145,330, the building had 34 rooms and
14 baths. Anticipating its completion, the 1918 edition of the
Stanford Quad had this to say: "Stanford presidents are to
have the sightliest position on campus ... the fine three
storey building, overlooking Lagunita on the one side and
the rest of campus from other points of view, will be more
than the home of the president. It is to be the reception cen
ter for the University. The large hall will be the common
meeting ground of the returning alumni, faculty and the stu
dent body in a social way, and by reason of new facilities in
it Stanford will be able to entertain distinguished visitors
properly."
liie Wilbur family moved in during June, 1918. They did
indeed have one of the sighdiest locales. Perched on the
hill, the presidential mansion was built directly on the line
of Palm Drive, and its sightlines were unsullied by any sur
rounding buildings: Florence Moore Hall, the fraternity

clusters and even Tresidder were all at least 38 years away.
The presidential home became a center for campus social
life as well. In a 1947 Daily article, Anastasia Doyle, former
assistant counselor for women, reminisced about the
numerous social affairs that took place at the home during

the '30s, writing: "Floodlights would always brighten up the
steps leading to the house and the beautiful heather-edged
walk."
In the same article, the home's longtime gardener, John
Weston, remembered that "all the students used to come up
here to visit and dance out on a platform placed in the
courtyard (in the back of the house)."
As it turned out, Wilbur was the only president to occupy
the house. By the time he retired in 1943, the Lou Henry
Hoover House was available for the University president.
Add to that the fact that the old home's dual role as a
residence and also as a reception center had never com
pletely been resolved, and it's little wonder that new presi
dent Donald Tresidder moved into the Hoover House.
The home then entered a transitional period during
which it was put to various and sundry uses. In 1943, it
hosted 40 World War II WACs (members of the Women's
Auxiliary Corps) who lived there while taking physical
therapy training.
In 1944, they were supplanted by a group of Army offi
cers. Several graduate women took over the home in 1945,
living there until the fall of 1946.
The building then entered its second major incarnation,
becoming the new home of the University Music Depart
ment. A Daily article reported that in 1947 the third floor
was still being used as housing — this time for members of
the University housing staff — but the Music Department
soon took over the whole building and stayed for almost 40
years.
In 1984, after years of agitating for a new home, the Music
Department moved to the newly built Braun Music Center.
Exactly when the building became known simply as "the
Knoll" is a matter of conjecture. It seems that until the presi
dent moved out, it was known (appropriately enough) as
the presidential mansion. As late as 1941, The Quad referred
to the building as "the presidential mansion on Lagunita
knoll."
It may be that the name Knoll came into common use as
soon as the building was no longer the president's home.
Given the size and desirable location of the Knoll, it's nat
ural to wonder if there was ever any plan to convert the
building to student housing.
And, indeed, there was, according to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs for Residential Education Norm Robinson.
"We looked at it (the Knoll) many years ago," he said,
"and we found that it would cost so much to bring it up to
(building safety) code and standard that it was just
prohibitively expensive."

versity on its present grounds, the area was ranch land, and
the hill on which the Knoll now stands was a cemetery for
the families who worked and lived on the ranches.
According to records in the Stanford University Archives,
the first person buried there was the original landowner,
David Adams, who died in 1855 when he was thrown from
his horse in Mayfield, the small town that is now south Palo
Alto.
Eventually, the hill, called Cemetery Hill, became the final
(or so they thought) resting place for at least 15 people who
are now considered to have been among the earliest
Americans to settle in Palo Alto.
When Leland Stanford established his farm and later the
University named for his son on the surrounding land, the
cemetery was largely ignored, although it was known to ex
ist.
In 1908, a student prank catalyzed the University's desire
to move the bodies and put the land to new use. On an April
night that year, three Stanford fraternity men ("slightly un
der the influence," according to a 1952 article in the Palo
Alto Times) came up with the bright idea of removing one
of the skeletons from the graveyard and bringing it back to
the fraternity house. The pranksters were able to dig down
to an iron casket, but discovering that the casket was too
heavy to lift, they fled the scene.
The open grave, discovered the next day, caused quite a
stir, but the events of the night before remained a mystery
for 48 years, until one of the culprits came forth and
confessed the incident to the Palo Alto Times.
In the meantime, the University, wishing to avoid any fur
ther abuse of the abandoned cemetery and wishing to build
on the site, ordered that the bodies be exhumed and
moved. In early May, 1908, the remains were removed and
reburied at Alta Mesa Cemetery in Palo Alto.
The site remained vacant until early 1916, when the
Board of Trustees decided to build a home for the Univer
sity president there. Until that time, there had been no offi
cial home for the school's head. A number of sites were con
sidered for the new home, but Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, for whom the new home was to be built, made it clear
that their preference was for the spot on what was called
Lagunita Hill.
Eminent San Francisco architect Louis Christian Mullgardt
was contracted to design the home. His plan, in Spanish
Gothic style, was slighdy controversial — what one observer

called "a monumental fortress with wings extending at
obtuse angles, embracing the knoll. What it lacked in good
practical considerations was masked by its festive air. A re
quest by the trustees to have the house erected of rein
forced concrete created a resounding tomb."
Ground was broken in late 1916, but wartime delays and
other difficulties stalled its completion until 1918.
Built at a cost of $145,330, the building had 34 rooms and
14 baths. Anticipating its completion, the 1918 edition of the
Stanford Quad had this to say: "Stanford presidents are to
have the sightliest position on campus ... the fine three
storey building, overlooking Lagunita on the one side and
the rest of campus from other points of view, will be more
than the home of the president. It is to be the reception cen
ter for the University. The large hall will be the common
meeting ground of the returning alumni, faculty and the stu
dent body in a social way, and by reason of new facilities in
it Stanford will be able to entertain distinguished visitors
properly."
liie Wilbur family moved in during June, 1918. They did
indeed have one of the sighdiest locales. Perched on the
hill, the presidential mansion was built directly on the line
of Palm Drive, and its sightlines were unsullied by any sur
rounding buildings: Florence Moore Hall, the fraternity

clusters and even Tresidder were all at least 38 years away.
The presidential home became a center for campus social
life as well. In a 1947 Daily article, Anastasia Doyle, former
assistant counselor for women, reminisced about the
numerous social affairs that took place at the home during

the '30s, writing: "Floodlights would always brighten up the
steps leading to the house and the beautiful heather-edged
walk."
In the same article, the home's longtime gardener, John
Weston, remembered that "all the students used to come up
here to visit and dance out on a platform placed in the
courtyard (in the back of the house)."
As it turned out, Wilbur was the only president to occupy
the house. By the time he retired in 1943, the Lou Henry
Hoover House was available for the University president.
Add to that the fact that the old home's dual role as a
residence and also as a reception center had never com
pletely been resolved, and it's little wonder that new presi
dent Donald Tresidder moved into the Hoover House.
The home then entered a transitional period during
which it was put to various and sundry uses. In 1943, it
hosted 40 World War II WACs (members of the Women's
Auxiliary Corps) who lived there while taking physical
therapy training.
In 1944, they were supplanted by a group of Army offi
cers. Several graduate women took over the home in 1945,
living there until the fall of 1946.
The building then entered its second major incarnation,
becoming the new home of the University Music Depart
ment. A Daily article reported that in 1947 the third floor
was still being used as housing — this time for members of
the University housing staff — but the Music Department
soon took over the whole building and stayed for almost 40
years.
In 1984, after years of agitating for a new home, the Music
Department moved to the newly built Braun Music Center.
Exactly when the building became known simply as "the
Knoll" is a matter of conjecture. It seems that until the presi
dent moved out, it was known (appropriately enough) as
the presidential mansion. As late as 1941, The Quad referred
to the building as "the presidential mansion on Lagunita
knoll."
It may be that the name Knoll came into common use as
soon as the building was no longer the president's home.
Given the size and desirable location of the Knoll, it's nat
ural to wonder if there was ever any plan to convert the
building to student housing.
And, indeed, there was, according to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs for Residential Education Norm Robinson.
"We looked at it (the Knoll) many years ago," he said,
"and we found that it would cost so much to bring it up to
(building safety) code and standard that it was just
prohibitively expensive."

This is not a grassy knoll. There were no hidden gunmen. Nonetheless, since 1918, the Knoll has guarded Lagunita.
Originally built as the University president's residence, it now is the ex-home of the Music Department.
In days long past it stood alone on the hill, a grand
fortress commanding the University. Its grounds ran out
uninterrupted in all directions — down to the shores of
Lagunita on one side and the homes of Mayfield on the
other, back to the foothills behind and away to the Quad in
front.
And the building's purpose justified its grandeur: It was
the home of the University president and a reception center
for various University functions.
These days the Knoll, now home for the Center for Com
puter Research in Music and Acoustics, has lost much of its
splendor, its exterior dulled by the years and its grounds
receding in the face of encroaching dormitory clusters fore
and aft.
But it remains one of the most eye-grabbing structures on
campus, and it has a history to match its appearance.
If the building is faintly reminiscent of a haunted house,
then its ghosts are those of some of the earliest residents of
Palo Alto. Long before Leland Stanford Sr. laid out his Uni
