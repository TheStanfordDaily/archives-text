# Stanford maps onto itself

### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Over the last several months, aerial
reconnaisance flights have been con
ducted over Stanford for the express
purpose of obtaining intelligence
photographs of the campus.
Are the Russians involved? Is it some
grand design of the Berkeley Band?
The answers to those fanciful ques
tions are negative.
Beginning in July and then again in
October, the University had a
photogrammatic survey done of the
campus to update its maps and to in
corporate that information in a
facilities database. The most visible
part of that survey are the large white
painted X's which remain scattered
around the Farm. Those X's served as
"monuments" which were visible to a
Cessna 310 making multiple flyovers of

Stanford at various altitudes.
The first stage began in July when
survey crews placed the X's and re
corded their coordinates, according to
John McGill of Hammon, Jensen, Wal
len & Associates of Oakland, the firm
that conducted the survey. Then, from

the air, a special camera photographed
the entire campus. The camera takes
very high-resolution shots because it is
mounted on a tracking device which
moves a nine-by-nine inch negative in
proportion to the movement of the
plane. Three of these flyovers were

conducted at different altitudes varying
with the desired scale of the photo.
The lowest flyover was at 1,200 feet.
The photos are put into stereo com
pilers which overlap the photos, cor
rect for distortion and create a stereo
image "like a "view-master,' " McGill
said. Coordinates are filled in from the
white-painted X's and 50-60 different
layers of information are distin
guished.
"Everything we can see" from the
air, McGill said, Is on a layer. That ia-, .
eludes buildings, roads, sanitary
manholes, even trees and shrubbery.
All this information is digitized and
then can be used for its intended pur
pose â€” map-making and facilities
management.
The most important goal of the
survey is to update maps of the
