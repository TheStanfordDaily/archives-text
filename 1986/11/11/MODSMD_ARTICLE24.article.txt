# Stanford maps onto itself
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Over the last several months, aerial
reconnaisance flights have been con
ducted over Stanford for the express
purpose of obtaining intelligence
photographs of the campus.
Are the Russians involved? Is it some
grand design of the Berkeley Band?
The answers to those fanciful ques
tions are negative.
Beginning in July and then again in
October, the University had a
photogrammatic survey done of the
campus to update its maps and to in
corporate that information in a
facilities database. The most visible
part of that survey are the large white
painted X's which remain scattered
around the Farm. Those X's served as
"monuments" which were visible to a
Cessna 310 making multiple flyovers of

Stanford at various altitudes.
The first stage began in July when
survey crews placed the X's and re
corded their coordinates, according to
John McGill of Hammon, Jensen, Wal
len & Associates of Oakland, the firm
that conducted the survey. Then, from

the air, a special camera photographed
the entire campus. The camera takes
very high-resolution shots because it is
mounted on a tracking device which
moves a nine-by-nine inch negative in
proportion to the movement of the
plane. Three of these flyovers were

conducted at different altitudes varying
with the desired scale of the photo.
The lowest flyover was at 1,200 feet.
The photos are put into stereo com
pilers which overlap the photos, cor
rect for distortion and create a stereo
image "like a "view-master,' " McGill
said. Coordinates are filled in from the
white-painted X's and 50-60 different
layers of information are distin
guished.
"Everything we can see" from the
air, McGill said, Is on a layer. That ia-, .
eludes buildings, roads, sanitary
manholes, even trees and shrubbery.
All this information is digitized and
then can be used for its intended pur
pose — map-making and facilities
management.
The most important goal of the
survey is to update maps of the
campus, said Betty Tyson of the
Facilities Project Management office. A
photogrammetric survey was .done
many years ago, but with the advent of
new construction on campus, some of
the information on the maps was
added inaccurately, and those inac
curacies have "multiplied on top of
each other," Tyson said.
A photogrammetric survey is
cheaper than having surveying crews
all over campus. The survey cost
$250,000, which isn't a lot when you
consider that two-man surveying crews
make around $900 a day. And the Uni
versity is getting not only better maps
(which will start coming out in Janu
ary), but digitized data which it will in
clude in a database for facilities man

agement.
The Stanford University Facilities
and Engineering Database (SUFED)
will store all this information, and the
applications are limitless. McGill ex
plained that by having the locations of
all the sanitary manholes in the
database, the University will have a
complete maintenance schedule. Ex
penses for roof repair can be more ac
curately calculated because the
database will have accurate measure
ments of all the roofs on campus. Paint
ing schedules for parking lots can even
be determined because the lines in
parking lots are visible in -the photos.
McGill said that his firm has done
this same type of photogrammetric
mapping for San Francisco, the Port of
Oakland, military bases and freeways.
What will become of all those white
X's? McGill said that they are water
based latex paint and should not last
the rainy season.
