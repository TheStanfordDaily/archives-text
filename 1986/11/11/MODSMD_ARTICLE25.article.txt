The Ultimate Christmas Vacation: San Francisco to Hawaii,
departing Friday, Dec. 19. Five days of swimming in clear
blue waters, getting out only to eat coconuts and macademia
nuts while swinging in your sunny hammock hung between
two palm trees.
Hawaii to New York, departing Tuesday, Dec. 23. Arriving
sunburnt and warm, shop for Christmas gifts amid snow
flakes. Christmas Eve plans include seeing the New York
City Ballet's Nutcracker Suite and ice skating in Rockefeller
Center under the glowing Christmas tree. Christmas Day:
family, carols, presents, eggnog.

Sign class lists.
Estimated air fare costs: more than last year.
Fare wars are over. Cheap airline tickets on competitive
airline routes will no longer be offered.
There is only bad news where discount fares are con
cerned. They are heavily restricted requiring advance pur

chase of either three weeks or 30 days, or are not available
for the flight and date you want. Blockout periods during
which special low fares do not apply are Nov. 21-Dec. 1 and
Dec. 18-Jan. 5.
Even worse, if you should change your schedule, you are
more often than not subject to a stiff penalty. Most major
airlines such as Delta and TWA quote a "50 percent penalty
on fare" for both cancellations and changes. In other words,
they will refund only half of your total fare.
There Ls still more bad news. Two weeks ago, the major
U.S. airlines increased their fares across the board. Those
routes with the biggest discounts will go up $20.
Many airline executives refer to all this as the new "fare
peace," said a Delta airline representative. The peace of
mind low fares previously brought college students was par
tially to blame for a $669 million loss in the airline industry *
in the first quarter of this year.
Now those longing for Mom and Dad and MTV are left
with few choices at a time when airfares traditionally
have dropped.
San Francisco to New York with a stopover in Dallas,
departing Dec. 19 and returning Jan. 4 will cost about $378,
tax included. Tickets should be purchased as far in advance
as possible. After Friday, the fare will increase to $398.
However, if you travel on Dec. 18 and Jan. 5, this same
flight's price will be reduced to $338. And, better still, it is
further reduced to $258 on the dates Dec. 17 and Jan. 6.
Leaving two days earlier and returning two days later can
bring a difference of over $100.
These increases have been attributed to many causes, ac
cording to a travel agent at the American Express Travel
Agency in Tresidder: Oil prices are going up, the medium
size airlines are merging to pick up a bigger share, recent
terrorism has caused a decline in air travel. Perhaps because
they are poorly run, airlines have to make up the losses they

have been reporting, she concluded.
However, during vacations, students will still travel by air.
Most, though, are wise to the ins and outs of shopping
around and calling many airlines. Many have switched carri
ers again and again in favor of cheaper fares, which get
more expensive each year.
Sophomore Carmela Gravante flew home to Norwalk,
Conn., at Christmas last year. "I have noticed an increase in
air fare," she said. "I will still go home at Christmas, though
probably not for spring break. I called a lot of different
airlines to find out the supersaver fares and even so,
United's least expensive has increased almost $75 since last
year."

"Maybe fares went up, but I think it mostly depends on
when you buy your ticket," senior Amy Stern said.
"You have to buy it far enough in advance," continued
Stern, who flies to Hamilton, N.Y. "The price goes up
progressively one month and then again two weeks before
your date of departure. I always go home at Christmas but
not for Thanksgiving because it is too expensive."
Nevertheless, freshman Kelley Puckett will fly across the
country to his home in Westport, Conn., this Thanksgiving.
"Mom just wants me there," he said.
Sometimes the price is no object.
So, of course, you wouldn't object to the cost of the
airfare for the Ultimate Christmas Vacation: $3,375.

Scenes like this one at the American Express Travel Agency in Tresidder will be repeated with alarming frequency as
winter break draws nigh.
