## Card moves up in national rankings Pac-10 award for Muster 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
A football coach once said that media attention
is like perfume: It's great if you just sniff a little
but don't drink it. That being the case, the Stan
ford Cardinal can breathe deeply of the smell of
success this week.
Following Saturday's 28-23 victory over UGj\
that raised its record to 7-2, Stanford moved into
the national rankings again. Associated Press
ranked the Cardinal No. 16, one of six Pacific 10
Conference teams ranked.
Also ranked by AP were conference champion
Arizona State (8-0-1) at No. 5, No. 10 Washington
(7-2), No. 13 USC (7-2), No. 14 Arizona (7-2) and
No. 19 UCLA (6-3).
United Press International and the ESPN poll
ranked the Cardinal No. 14, and the USA
Today/CNN poll had Stanford No. 15.
Junior running back Brad Muster was named
the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week for his
workhorse performance Saturday. Muster carried
a Stanford-record 38 times for 183 yards and r /o

touchdowns against the Bruins, including a 74-
yard run, the longest of his career.
Muster has carried 75 times for 373 yards in his
last two games. This season he has 886 yards and
very possibly could go over the 1,000-yard mark
when Stanford returns to action a week from Sat
urday at California. Muster has already exceeded
his previous career high for a season, and his total
is the sixth-best in school history with two games
to play.
Only one Stanford back, Darrin Nelson, has
ever run for 1,000 yards in a season. Nelson did
that in 1977, 1978 and 1981, setting the season
record of 1,069 yards in 1977. Muster needs to
average 61 yards in his last three games
(including a bowl game) to break that mark.
Muster and his teammates got a couple of days
off to recuperate from nine games worth of
bumps and bruises as Stanford Coach Jack Elway
cancelled practice for yesterday and today.
"We've been on a demanding schedule since Au
gust," Elway said, "so we've got a couple days off.


Barry Saik/Daily file
who has 886 yards rushing this season, should become only the
second Cardinal to gain 1,000 yards on the ground in a season.

Brad Muster's 38-carry, 183-yard outing against UCLA Saturday
earned him Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week honors. Muster,
We'll be back together on Wednesday
and ready to prepare for our next op
ponent."
That opponent is looking like the
worst Cal team in history. The Bears
are 1-8 with games left against USC and
Stanford. In 105 years of football dating
back to 1882, no Cal team has lost 10
games in a season.
Stanford, meanwhile, assured itself
of its first bowl bid since the 1978
Bluebonnet Bowl with its seventh win.
When the bids are announced at 4 p.m.
on Nov. 22, the Cardinal should be 8-2,
barring a complete letdown against
Cal. •
A New Year's Day bowl does not
seem out of the question; both the
Citrus and Fiesta Bowls had represen
tatives in the press box Saturday. While
it is very probable that No. 1 Miami
(Fla.) will want to stay in-state and play
No. 2 Penn State for the national cham
pionship in the Citrus Bowl, Tony Alba
of the Fiesta Bowl said, "We still have a
lot of interest in the Pac-10 runner-up,
and there is a good chance Stanford
will be the runner-up."
To finish second in the conference,
Stanford would need some help. While

tied with USC, Washington, Arizona
and UCLA for that spot, the Cardinal
has lost to Washington and USC. Stan
ford plays Arizona in Tokyo on Nov. 29.
Stanford needs to win its last two
games and have the Huskies and
Trojans lose one of theirs.
Washington closes with UCLA and
Washington State, and USC finishes
with Cal and UCLA, with a non
conference finale against Notre Dame.
Asked about the Jan. 1 possibility, El
way said, "I think if we finish 9-2, we've
got a great chance. It's a nebulous type
of thing. If we keep winning games,
we're going to have some choices. It's
going to be a result of how we per
form."
This morning at 10 a.m., Athletic
Director Andy Geiger, who is par
ticipating on a task force at the Univer
sity of Maryland, will speak via confer
ence call with the athletic directors of
the other five Pac-10 schools with bowl
aspirations to discuss the situation.
Card notes
The last time Stanford had a week off was
in 1980, the week before Big Game. That
year Stanford was 6-4 and Cal was 2-8 going
into the game, but Gil won a 28-23 decision
to deny the Cardinal a Peach Bowl berth.
That was Stanford's last winning season.

success this week.
Following Saturday's 28-23 victory over UGj\
that raised its record to 7-2, Stanford moved into
the national rankings again. Associated Press
ranked the Cardinal No. 16, one of six Pacific 10
Conference teams ranked.
Also ranked by AP were conference champion
Arizona State (8-0-1) at No. 5, No. 10 Washington
(7-2), No. 13 USC (7-2), No. 14 Arizona (7-2) and
No. 19 UCLA (6-3).
United Press International and the ESPN poll
ranked the Cardinal No. 14, and the USA
Today/CNN poll had Stanford No. 15.
Junior running back Brad Muster was named
the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week for his
workhorse performance Saturday. Muster carried
a Stanford-record 38 times for 183 yards and r /o

touchdowns against the Bruins, including a 74-
yard run, the longest of his career.
Muster has carried 75 times for 373 yards in his
last two games. This season he has 886 yards and
very possibly could go over the 1,000-yard mark
when Stanford returns to action a week from Sat
urday at California. Muster has already exceeded
his previous career high for a season, and his total
is the sixth-best in school history with two games
to play.
Only one Stanford back, Darrin Nelson, has
ever run for 1,000 yards in a season. Nelson did
that in 1977, 1978 and 1981, setting the season
record of 1,069 yards in 1977. Muster needs to
average 61 yards in his last three games
(including a bowl game) to break that mark.
Muster and his teammates got a couple of days
off to recuperate from nine games worth of
bumps and bruises as Stanford Coach Jack Elway
cancelled practice for yesterday and today.
"We've been on a demanding schedule since Au
gust," Elway said, "so we've got a couple days off.


Barry Saik/Daily file
who has 886 yards rushing this season, should become only the
second Cardinal to gain 1,000 yards on the ground in a season.

Brad Muster's 38-carry, 183-yard outing against UCLA Saturday
earned him Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week honors. Muster,
We'll be back together on Wednesday
and ready to prepare for our next op
ponent."
That opponent is looking like the
worst Cal team in history. The Bears
are 1-8 with games left against USC and
Stanford. In 105 years of football dating
back to 1882, no Cal team has lost 10
games in a season.
Stanford, meanwhile, assured itself
of its first bowl bid since the 1978
Bluebonnet Bowl with its seventh win.
When the bids are announced at 4 p.m.
on Nov. 22, the Cardinal should be 8-2,
barring a complete letdown against
Cal. •
A New Year's Day bowl does not
seem out of the question; both the
Citrus and Fiesta Bowls had represen
tatives in the press box Saturday. While
it is very probable that No. 1 Miami
(Fla.) will want to stay in-state and play
No. 2 Penn State for the national cham
pionship in the Citrus Bowl, Tony Alba
of the Fiesta Bowl said, "We still have a
lot of interest in the Pac-10 runner-up,
and there is a good chance Stanford
will be the runner-up."
To finish second in the conference,
Stanford would need some help. While

tied with USC, Washington, Arizona
and UCLA for that spot, the Cardinal
has lost to Washington and USC. Stan
ford plays Arizona in Tokyo on Nov. 29.
Stanford needs to win its last two
games and have the Huskies and
Trojans lose one of theirs.
Washington closes with UCLA and
Washington State, and USC finishes
with Cal and UCLA, with a non
conference finale against Notre Dame.
Asked about the Jan. 1 possibility, El
way said, "I think if we finish 9-2, we've
got a great chance. It's a nebulous type
of thing. If we keep winning games,
we're going to have some choices. It's
going to be a result of how we per
form."
This morning at 10 a.m., Athletic
Director Andy Geiger, who is par
ticipating on a task force at the Univer
sity of Maryland, will speak via confer
ence call with the athletic directors of
the other five Pac-10 schools with bowl
aspirations to discuss the situation.
Card notes
The last time Stanford had a week off was
in 1980, the week before Big Game. That
year Stanford was 6-4 and Cal was 2-8 going
into the game, but Gil won a 28-23 decision
to deny the Cardinal a Peach Bowl berth.
That was Stanford's last winning season.
A football coach once said that media attention
is like perfume: It's great if you just sniff a little
but don't drink it. That being the case, the Stan
ford Cardinal can breathe deeply of the smell of
success this week.
