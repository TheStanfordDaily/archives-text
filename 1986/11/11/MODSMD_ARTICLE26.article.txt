## Card moves up in national rankings Pac-10 award for Muster 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
A football coach once said that media attention
is like perfume: It's great if you just sniff a little
but don't drink it. That being the case, the Stan
ford Cardinal can breathe deeply of the smell of
success this week.
Following Saturday's 28-23 victory over UGj\
that raised its record to 7-2, Stanford moved into
the national rankings again. Associated Press
ranked the Cardinal No. 16, one of six Pacific 10
Conference teams ranked.
Also ranked by AP were conference champion
Arizona State (8-0-1) at No. 5, No. 10 Washington
(7-2), No. 13 USC (7-2), No. 14 Arizona (7-2) and
No. 19 UCLA (6-3).
United Press International and the ESPN poll
ranked the Cardinal No. 14, and the USA
Today/CNN poll had Stanford No. 15.
Junior running back Brad Muster was named
the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week for his
workhorse performance Saturday. Muster carried
a Stanford-record 38 times for 183 yards and r /o

touchdowns against the Bruins, including a 74-
yard run, the longest of his career.
Muster has carried 75 times for 373 yards in his
last two games. This season he has 886 yards and
very possibly could go over the 1,000-yard mark
when Stanford returns to action a week from Sat
urday at California. Muster has already exceeded
his previous career high for a season, and his total
is the sixth-best in school history with two games
to play.
Only one Stanford back, Darrin Nelson, has
ever run for 1,000 yards in a season. Nelson did
that in 1977, 1978 and 1981, setting the season
record of 1,069 yards in 1977. Muster needs to
average 61 yards in his last three games
(including a bowl game) to break that mark.
Muster and his teammates got a couple of days
off to recuperate from nine games worth of
bumps and bruises as Stanford Coach Jack Elway
cancelled practice for yesterday and today.
"We've been on a demanding schedule since Au
gust," Elway said, "so we've got a couple days off.

who has 886 yards rushing this season, should become only the
second Cardinal to gain 1,000 yards on the ground in a season.
