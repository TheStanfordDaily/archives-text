# Sailing team wins regatta
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
While the football team must wait another week and a half
for its Big Game, the Stanford sailing team is already
celebrating its own Big Regatta victory.
Last weekend, the sailing team defeated California and 15
other teams at the annual North/South Regatta at San Luis
Obispo. The victory will undoubtedly be the highlight of the
Cardinal's fall season.
The team's latest win featured all of the elements ex
pected of a Big Game, including a dramatic victory, a surge
of team spirit and the plundering of an opponent's mascot.
Hosted on Lake Lopez by the Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
sailing team, the regatta featured exceptional sailing condi
tions, with strong, changing breezes and constant sunshine.
The Stanford team excelled in the shifting lake winds, win
ning the regatta overall by a wide margin over runners-up
USC, Orange Coast College and San Diego State.
Leading the Stanford effort were juniors Dan Buckstaff
and Kathleen Mallery, who captured first place in the A divi
sion. Sophomores Bill Shoemaker and Lori Dobeus sailed
the Cardinal's other varsity scoring boat to sixth place in the
A division.
Junior Drew Gashler and senior Kristen Boyles sailed the
same boat to second place in the B division, while juniors
Buffy Wendt and Kari Evans placed sixth in the same divi
sion.

at Lake Lopez in San Luis Obispo. Leading the way for the Card
inal were juniors Dan Buckstaff and Kathleen Mallery.
In the singlehanded competition,
sophomore Brad Swett, sailing in the A
division, and freshman Al Sargent,
sailing in the B division, combined to
score a Cardinal victory in the event.
Swett placed second in his division,
missing first place only because he
started early in one of the 10 races,

while Sargent tied for first place in his
division.
"I was very impressed by our newer
sailors at this regatta," Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton said. "The freshmen
and women skippers did terrificly."
As a result of its overall victory this
weekend, Stanford will be able to
choose which regattas it would like to
be invited- ta next--*priftgr-~That
privilege will allow the team to avoid
regattas during exam weeks while still
achieving a high national ranking.

According to Middleton, the team
benefitted from the SOAR organization
of Stanford. The SOAR program, which
rents camping equipment to students,
provided the sailing team with tents
and other supplies that allowed the
squad to stay right by the lake.
"Having the SOAR equipment was a
really key advantage to us," Middleton
jnsaid. "Staying by the Jake was an im
portant advantage, because we didn't
have to spend all our time travelling to
a far-away motel."
