# Field hockey set for Iowa

### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
When the NCAA field hockey
regional pairings were an
nounced yesterday, it meant that
Stanford's season of deja vu had
continued, but the Cardinal
hopes that this trend ends
before Saturday.
Stanford will enter the tourna
ment on the strength of a 10-
game winning streak that gave it
die Northern Pacific Conference
championship, just as it entered
last year's NCAAs on a nine-game
victory string that brought it the
1985 NorPac title.
The Cardinal will join North-
western and lowa in the Midwest
regional that opens Saturday in lowa
City. Last year, Stanford met the same
two teams in the same regional, al
though that one was played at North
western. The Cardinal is hoping that
more than the location will be differ
ent, as Stanford lost to lowa 3-0 in the
first round in 1985.
Stanford will meet Northwestern in
the first round this year, with the win
ner taking on lowa for a trip to the
Final Four.

In lowa and Northwestern, Stanford
will be facing the class of the Big Ten
Conference. The Big Ten champion
Hawkeyes finished 9-1 in the confer
ence (their only loss was to Northwest
ern) and 16-2-1 overall. The Wildcats
bring a 14-3-2 record into the tourna
ment, including a 6-2-2 Big Ten mark.
Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson was
mildly surprised at the Cardinal's
placement. "Because of the seedings
(of the 12 tournament teams), I
thought there was a chance we would
go further east, but the NCAA put us in
the Midwest because of money," she
said.
Johnson is not complaining,
however. "That's a good spot for us,"
she said. "lowa and Northwestern are

down further in the rankings this year.
They're closer to us."
Should Stanford meet lowa in Sun
days final, the Hawkeyes should have a
distinct home-field advantage because
of cold weather, but Saturday's game
will be played indoors because of an
lowa football game.
The other three regionals will also
be played this weekend. In die Mid-
Atlantic, host Penn State will meet West
Chester State, with tlie winner taking
on Old Dominion. In the New Eng
land, Massachusetts will play Connec
ticut for the right to face host New
Hampshire. And in the Mideast, it will
be Pennsylvania against host Rutgers,
with the winner meeting top-ranked
North Carolina.
