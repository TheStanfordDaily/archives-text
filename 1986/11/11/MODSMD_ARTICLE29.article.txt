# Men's soccer closes season against USIU
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Coming off two tough games last weekend, the
Stanford men's soccer team plays its final game of
the regular season today at 2:30 p.m. at Maloney
Field against U.S. International University.
The Cardinal will take on the University of Syd
ney in an exhibition in the season finale. The time
and date for that game are not official yet.
Stanford, which is winless in its last three con
tests, has played better soccer than that streak
would indicate. Only one of the three games was
a loss, against California, 3-1, on Sunday. The two
previous games ended in ties â€” 1-1 against
Brown on Friday and 3-3 against Santa Clara Wed
nesday.
The team is spent from an exhausting season
ending schedule that has it playing four games in
six days, including today's game with USIU. Stan
ford Coach Sam Koch gave his players the day off
yesterday to rest them for today's match.
Freshman forward Chris Porch has made the
most of the hectic schedule, producing three as
sists in the last three games. The three points left
him third on the team in scoring with eight on the
year.
Porch and senior forward Jim Cole have
proven to be a potent tandem for the Cardinal.
The two have combined for a total of six points
over the last three games. Cole has produced a
goal and an assist to move into a tie for the team

scoring lead with nine points.
"We play a lot alike," Porch said. "Our
strengths are we both have speed; we use it really
well.
"If I can take two guys with me on a run to call
the defense to me, he (Cole) can be alone on the
wing with his man if we can get him the ball,"
Porch added. "You can defend all you want, but
you can't defend speed. We have two guys who
can run with their best fullback, and we try to
work the give-and-go."
Not only have Porch and Cole been moving the
ball beautifully on the wing, but they have been
producing effective crosses to set up Stanford
shots.
"I've always played wing. When you do it a lot
(make centering passes), it works out at times. I
don't like being in the middle. It's too crowded in
there," Porch said.
Indeed one of the problems for the Cardinal
this season has been a lack of a force in the
middle. The Cardinal has been missing the type
of player who executes well in traffic with his
back to the net. Part of the reason is the absence
of junior defender Tim Westergren, who has
been redshirted this year with a season-ending in
jury.
"We need to get Westergren back in there,"
Porch said "He can take the ball in he middle and
control it with people hanging all over him. He's
got tree trunks for legs and can do that well. We
really don't have anyone to do that this year."
