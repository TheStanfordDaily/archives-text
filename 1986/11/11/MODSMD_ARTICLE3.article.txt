# Psychology profs, blast Dr. Ruth

### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Though Stanford students are enthusiastic about
tonight's sellout speech by Dr. Ruth Westheimer of
"Good Sex" fame, Stanford psychology professors
feel that her appearance will be much less than an in
tellectual one-night stand.
"It's outrageous that (the Stanford community)
would pay $7,500 for a one-hour lecture by Dr.
Ruth," said Philip Zimbardo, professor of psycholgy.
Zimbardo said if Westheimer is being paid as an
entertainer then there is no limit to what she can
receive for an appearance; however, "If she is being
paid as a professional educator, the amount of
money is out of line with her educational contribu
tion."
Other Stanford faculty echoed Zimbardo's
"disappointment" in the choice of Westheimer, who
has been voted the most popular college campus
speaker nationwide.

Prof. George Quattrone of the Psychology Depart
ment attributed Westheimer's popularity to "one of
the oldest tricks in the world."
She is successful because it is atypical to see an el
derly lady who is a renowned sex therapist, he said.
She does not conform to the American public's ex
pectations of how an older lady should behave, ac
cording to Quattrone.
"If someone else — like someone around the
dorm — said the things (Westheimer) says, nobody
would find it particularly interesting, stimulating or
challenging.
"It's the sort of thing you look at on David Letter
man when you're about to go to sleep and turn your
mind off," he added.
Quattrone went on to criticize the selection of
Westheimer as a speaker here. "She doesn't seem to
be somebody Stanford students should go out of
their way in getting" because she does not fulfill the
mission of education — "to challenge students by
challenging their assumptions."

Student insistence on Westheimer as a speaker
points to "some failing in the educational system
somewhere," he said. "I was disappointed to learn
that she was chosen by students."
On a more pro-Ruth note, Doryn Davis-Chervin,
manager of student health services at Cowell Student
Health Center, said that although Westheimer gives
advice that is "not very novel," she focuses the issue
by virtue of her celebrity status.
Westheimer "is very expensive, but if she gets stu
dents to talk and think about their sexuality, then per
haps she's worth it," Davis-Chervin said.
Also in praise of Westheimer, Meg Richman, direc
tor of the ASSU Speakers Bureau, said, "More then
any other speaker (Westheimer) has allowed people
to talk about relationships.
"Using light humor as well as good advice — sort
of avoiding the parental mode — (Westheimer) has
allowed people to ask the questions they want to ask
and express the fears they've kept hidden," Richman
added.
