### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
It was another frustrating day for the Stanford men's golf
team yesterday, as the Cardinal saw a promising morning
round slip away at the USF Invitational being played at the
par-71 Lake Course at San Francisco's Olympic Club, the site
of the 1987 U.S. Open.
With the first 36 of the 54-hole tournament contested yes
terday, it was a long day for the 16 teams entered. However,
it was longer for Stanford than most, as the Cardinal finished
the day in 15th place.
Stanford shot 312 in the morning and 319 in the after
noon for a 631 total, 47 strokes behind tournament leader
Arizona State, which went 296-288 to finish at 584. The Sun
Devils have a comfortable 15-shot lead over second-place
UCLA. The Bruins were within one at lunchtime but fell
back in the afternoon. Nevada-Reno is third at 603.
ASU's performance was even more impressive consider
ing that the Sun Devils were without their top player, Bill
Mayfair. Tom Stankowski took up the slack nicely, firing
rounds of 72 and 70 for a 142 total. Aaron Bengoechea of the
University of the Pacific shot 70-72 to tie Stankowski for the

tournament lead.
Although it is in 15th place, Stanford trails eighth-place
SMU by only 13 strokes. Between the Cardinal and the Mus
tangs are six West Coast teams — California (619), USF
(622), Oregon State (622), USC (624), Hawaii (626) and UC-
Santa Barbara (630).
According to Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf, a better perfor
mance today could move the Cardinal significantly up the
leaderboard. "Those are all reasonable teams to catch if we
play a good round," he said. "And it's about time we played
a good round. If we can shoot 300, we can jump over some
of those teams."
Stanford had a shot at such a round early in the morning
round yesterday but could not sustain its initial momentum.
"In the morning round that (a 300 score) was in our grasp,"
Schaaf said. "Obviously, it didn't stay in our grasp."
Freshman Don Christensen had an especially good round
in his grasp. Christensen was only one over par after 16
holes but finished with a double-bogey and a bogey for a 75.
He then shot an 81 in the afternoon to lead Stanford with a
156 total.
The Cardinal's other,scores were: John Mahon 157 (77-
80), Rich Marik 159 (81-78), Steve White 159 (79-80) and
Brad Geer 162 (81-81).
