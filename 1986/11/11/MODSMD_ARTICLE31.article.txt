### 
Kosar connects on 32 of 50 for 401 yards

CLEVELAND (AP) — Second-year quarterback Bernie
Kosar passed for a career-high 401 yards last night and
overcame three dropped touchdown passes by Cleveland
receivers to direct the Browns to a 26-16 victory over the
Miami Dolphins.
Kosar completed 32 of 50 passes without an interception
— and without a touchdown pass. His pinpoint passing,
however, set up four short Matt Bahr field goals and touch
down runs of 16 yards by Harry Holt and 13 yards by Curtis
Dickey.
The 22-year-old quarterback had never before thrown for
more than 300 yards in a game. His previous best was a 293-
yard performance in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Sep
tember.
The Browns, who improved to 7-3 after their sixth victory
in the last seven games, lead the Cincinnati Bengals by a
game in the AFC Central Division.
Cleveland led only 16-10 at halftime despite dominating
the half statistically, outgaining the Dolphins 351 yards to
176 yards. The Browns finished with 558 yards.
Miami quarterback Dan Marino threw a 24-yard touch
down pass to Mark Duper and Fuad Reveiz kicked a 20-yard
field goal to keep the Dolphins, 4-6, close at the half, par
tially compensating for a Miami defense that was unable to
stop any Cleveland drive until the third quarter.
Dickey scored four plays after Miami's Ron Davenport
fumbled the ball away at his own 29 midway through the
third period, and Bahr added a 21-yard field goal in the

fourth quarter on a drive started by teammate Clay Mat
thews' interception.
Miami scored on the last play of the game when Marino
passed 22 yards to Mark Clayton.
Cleveland pushed the ball inside the Dolphins' 20-yard
line five times in the first half but scored only the 16 points
on Holt's 16-yard end run and Bahr's field goals of 32, 19
and 18 yards.
Brown receivers Webster Slaughter, Ozzie Newsome and
Brian Brennan all missed first-half passes that could have
been caught in the end zone, forcing Cleveland to settle for
the field goals.
Kosar's 401 yards matched Otto Graham's effort in 1952
for the second-best passing production in Cleveland history.
Brian Sipe holds the team record at 444 yards, set against
the Baltimore Colts in 1981.
The Browns' 558 yards ranked as the fourth-highest total
ever allowed by the Dolphins.
Marino, who led the NFL in attempts, completions and
touchdown passes entering the game, finished with 22 com
pletions in 39 attempts for 295 yards and two touchdowns.
He has 23 touchdown passes this season, and he has thrown
at least one TD pass in each of his last 19 games, including
two playoff games.
The Cleveland victory, before a sellout crowd of 77,949,
came in the first meeting between the teams since the
Browas' 24-21 loss to the Dolphins in the AFC playoffs last
January.

Kosar connects on 32 of 50 for 401 yards

CLEVELAND (AP) — Second-year quarterback Bernie
Kosar passed for a career-high 401 yards last night and
overcame three dropped touchdown passes by Cleveland
receivers to direct the Browns to a 26-16 victory over the
Miami Dolphins.
Kosar completed 32 of 50 passes without an interception
— and without a touchdown pass. His pinpoint passing,
however, set up four short Matt Bahr field goals and touch
down runs of 16 yards by Harry Holt and 13 yards by Curtis
Dickey.
The 22-year-old quarterback had never before thrown for
more than 300 yards in a game. His previous best was a 293-
yard performance in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Sep
tember.
The Browns, who improved to 7-3 after their sixth victory
in the last seven games, lead the Cincinnati Bengals by a
game in the AFC Central Division.
Cleveland led only 16-10 at halftime despite dominating
the half statistically, outgaining the Dolphins 351 yards to
176 yards. The Browns finished with 558 yards.
Miami quarterback Dan Marino threw a 24-yard touch
down pass to Mark Duper and Fuad Reveiz kicked a 20-yard
field goal to keep the Dolphins, 4-6, close at the half, par
tially compensating for a Miami defense that was unable to
stop any Cleveland drive until the third quarter.
Dickey scored four plays after Miami's Ron Davenport
fumbled the ball away at his own 29 midway through the
third period, and Bahr added a 21-yard field goal in the

fourth quarter on a drive started by teammate Clay Mat
thews' interception.
Miami scored on the last play of the game when Marino
passed 22 yards to Mark Clayton.
Cleveland pushed the ball inside the Dolphins' 20-yard
line five times in the first half but scored only the 16 points
on Holt's 16-yard end run and Bahr's field goals of 32, 19
and 18 yards.
Brown receivers Webster Slaughter, Ozzie Newsome and
Brian Brennan all missed first-half passes that could have
been caught in the end zone, forcing Cleveland to settle for
the field goals.
Kosar's 401 yards matched Otto Graham's effort in 1952
for the second-best passing production in Cleveland history.
Brian Sipe holds the team record at 444 yards, set against
the Baltimore Colts in 1981.
The Browns' 558 yards ranked as the fourth-highest total
ever allowed by the Dolphins.
Marino, who led the NFL in attempts, completions and
touchdown passes entering the game, finished with 22 com
pletions in 39 attempts for 295 yards and two touchdowns.
He has 23 touchdown passes this season, and he has thrown
at least one TD pass in each of his last 19 games, including
two playoff games.
The Cleveland victory, before a sellout crowd of 77,949,
came in the first meeting between the teams since the
Browas' 24-21 loss to the Dolphins in the AFC playoffs last
January.
