# Concert planned for quake relief
## 
### MICHAEL WOLFE 
Students working with outside
groups will hold two benefit con
certs for El Salvador earthquake
relief today in Memorial Church at
4:30 p.m. and":30 p.m. Tickets are
still available for both shows.
Members of Stanford Sanctuary,
along with co-sponsors South Bay
Sanctuary Covenant and the Com
mittee of Refugees from El Sal
vador, plan to donate the proceeds
to victims of the Oct. 10 El Salvador
earthquake. The earthquake killed
over 1,200 people, left thousands
homeless and destroyed over HO
percent of the buildings in San Sal
vador, the capital city.
According to graduate student Ed
Gilliland, Stanford Sanctuary mem
ber and a concert organizer, all
proceeds will be distributed
through the Share Project of San
Francisco and the Archdiocese of
San Salvador to help the most
needy. "Many of the earthquake
victims haven't received the neces
sary aid through the normal chan
nels, particularly refugees who live
in shantytoWns in the outskirts of
San Salvador. And these are the
people who need it the most," Gil
liland said.
The El Salvador earthquake has
received relatively little publicity in
the United States. Subsequently, El

Salvador hasn't gotten the same
kind of economic support as did
Mexico in last year's earthquake, he
said.
"To make matters worse, what as
sistance there has been has been di
rected toward commercial areas,
and these refugees have been
ignored. This is part of the reason
why church groups are distributing
the money, to get it to the most
needy people first,' Gilliland
added.
Gilliland said the money will be
spent for direct assistance in the
form of food, rebuilding and medi
cal supports. The groups hope to
raise at least $5,000 from today's
events and fill up the 1,100 seat
Stanford Memorial Church.
The concert's main attraction is
the band Mancotal, which is flying
in from Nicaragua. It is a very
popular group which has been
greeted with acclaim by audiences
throughout Europe and Latin
America, Gilliland said.
Other performing bands include:
two U.S. bands, Blazing Redheads
and Tuck & Patti; a Chilean band,
Kamanchaka; and an El Salvadorian
band, Sumpul, all of which are cen
tered in the Bay Area.
Gilliland said he feels that stu
dents will enjoy today's concert and
encourages all to attend.
