# Stanford votes Democratic in election

### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
Stanford, as it did in the 1984 elec
tions, voted overwhelmingly Demo
cratic in last Tuesday's elections, op
posing even Republican candidates
who won by large margins.
Democratic gubernatorial candidate
Tom Bradley, for example, garnered
almost twice as many campus votes as
George Deukmejian. Deukmejian, the
Republican governor, easily won re

election, capturing 61 percent of the
vote to Bradley's 37 percent.
In the tightly contested race for U.S.
senator, Democratic Senator Alan
Cranston beat Republican challanger
Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos) 49 per
cent to 48 percent. However, Cranston
won over two-and-one-half more
campus votes than Zschau.
Although Zschau represents the
Stanford campus in the U.S. House of
Representatives, the Zschau campaign
was not "really counting on Stanford,"

according to a Zschau campaign offi
cial. Stanford has always been "anti-
Zschau," the official said.
Lance Weil received 1,714 campus
votes to Ernie Konnyu's 648 in the race
to represent the 12th congressional
district, which includes Stanford.
Results from the overall balloting
showed Konnyu won 59 percent of the
12th district vote to Weil's 37 percent.
According to statistics released by
the Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters (SCCRV), 45.4 percent of the

5,836 eligible campus voters cast bal
lots in the election, considerably above
the percentage of voter turnout re
corded in other areas of the state and
country.
Members of the campus electorate,
who could cast their ballots in one of
14 polling stations on campus, voted to
retain California Supreme Court Chief
Justice Rose Bird as well as Associate
Justices Joseph Grodin and Cruz
