# ASSU gets refund
## State honors $93,775 request 
### MARCUS MABRY Editorial staff 
The ASSU received more than
$93,775 from the state of California
yesterday as a result of a tax refund
request made in 1985.
The refund represents three
years of state sales taxes paid by the
now defunct, student-run restaurant
Coffee House Inc. revenues. The
restaurant is currently operated by
the Saga Corporation.
The Coffee House had been
paying sales tax to the state for the
five year period that students had
operated it, according to Council of
Presidents member Carey White.
"We discovered in 1985 that the
sales tax did not have to be paid,"
White stated," and that we could lay
claim to the last three years of
taxes."
There is a very obscure section of
the California Tax Code which stip
ulates that student groups selling
food to other students do not have
to pay state sales tax, ASSU Senate
Chair Jeff Soukup said.
The ASSU originally filed for the
refund in 1985, but the State Board
of Equilization rejected it, stating
that Coffee House Inc. did not
satisfy the tax exemption status pro
vided under the tax code.

Upon rejection, the ASSU
decided to take the risk of incurring
law fees without gaining result*- and
sought counseling from the Palo
Alto firm of Blaze, Valentine and
Klein to help it organize its
appeal.
The ASSU approached the firm in
April of this year and sent its appeal
to the Board of Equilization in early
June.
"Carey and the law firm were in
strumental in getting back the
taxes," Soukup added.
The refund went to the ASSU be
cause Coffee House Inc. had been
dissolved in September 1985 after
losing its bid for continued opera
tion of the Coffee House.
"Because the ASSU had assumed
liability for Coffee House Inc., it
was entitled to the refund," Soukup
stated.
White and Soukup said that the
destination of the newly aquired
funds has not yet been determined
and will be decided by the ASSU
Senate.
"It really isn't our money. It's the
money of past students ... and will
probably go to providing some sort
of student service," Soukup said.
He also emphasized that the
refund is proof that student-run or
ganizations can be profitable.
