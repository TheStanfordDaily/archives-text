# Reagan Library site challenged
## Doctors circulate protest petition, 400 sign 
### DIANE BISGEIER Staff writer 
A senior physician and a surgical resident at
the Stanford Hospital are circulating and plan
ning to give the University Board of Trustees a
petition criticizing trustee approval of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library site.
But even if senior physician Sam Brain and
surgical resident Laura Esserman reach their
goal and collect slgnitures in the thousands, it is
unlikely that the trustees will choose another
site, according to administrators.
"The board has approved the site already,"
said Assistant to the President Robert Hamrdla.
"Given the president's response at the last Fac

ulty Senate meeting, reconsideration is
unlikely."
On Oct. 30, Kennedy said changes in the ar
rangement of the building on the site are
"possible" but said changing the site itself is
"not a possibility."
Currently, Brain and Esserman are consider
ing presentation to Kennedy of the petition,
which 400 people signed over the weekend.
The two organizers said in a letter that the
petition seeks to preserve "the beauty of
campus" and to prevent an "increase in traffic
along an already overburdened Juniperra Serra
(Road)"
Brain explained that he is not personally
aginst the library, that its materials are an
"important resource," but that the location is

what the petition is targeted at changing.
The petitioners suggest that builders choose
a site near Interstate 280 and Sand Hill Road,
near the Stanford Linear Accelerator, which has
already been approved for a hotel and conven
tion center site. "We feel that a more appropri
ate site would be there," Brain said.
Kennedy ruled out that site, however, at the
Faculty Senate meeting.
The letter charges that the University has not
been agressive enough in collecting opinions
regarding the site from the surrounding com
munity.
The library site and access road "has moved
forward with inadequate solicitation of the
community's views,'" the letter reads. The
access road will widen the current footpath

seven feet and begin slightly west of the exist
ing road, it continues.
Bob Freelen, vice president for Public Affairs,
defended the library site, noting that an eight
person committee spent a year considering 20
sites.
"It chose one site, and the White House ac
cepted it,"he said.
"The fundamental issue is land use policy.
The people need to try to come to grips with
the fact that the land is an endowment, and
we're prevented to sell our land. It must be
used for academic purposes," Freelen added.
University Planning Director Phil Williams
also defended the site for the access road
criticized by the petition.
The site was chosen over one near the Cen

ter for Behavioral Studies and also over one
near Alpine Road because it will have the "least
environmental damage and is the most accessi
ble from campus," he said.
The Behavioral Center site was lobbied
against by several behavioral scientists, but the
decision to make the road on the current foot
path was made after an analysis done by the
Planning Department showed that "the major
effect was on the environment. (The access
road) is not just a driveway," said Williams.
"We might need it later for other academic
purposes. We studied all three alternatives in
the planning office and determined that the
most direct, although most visible, would have
the least environmental effects."
But Brain said the environmental ef
fects to the area surrounding the site
will be extensive.
"They're going to have to remove a
great amount of earth and there will be
an enormous amount of earth
removing equipment during the two
year construction period. Most people
walk and run on that hill, and having
the traffic come up on the hill for the
library would be a gross intrusion," he
said.
Hamrdla, however, denied that the
running path would be greatly ef
fected.
"It's a little late for reconsideration,"
Hamrdla said.
The project is expected to break
ground in April of 1987, and planners
hope to have it finished before the end
of Reagan's term in 1988.
