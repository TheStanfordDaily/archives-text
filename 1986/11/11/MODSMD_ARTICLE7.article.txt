Bombs explode in Paris
PARIS — Bombs exploded at three Paris office buildings almost simulta
neously early yesterday, wounding one person and damaging the
structures, fire officials said.
Direct Action, an extreme left-wing group, reportedly said it set off the
blasts at the headquarters of the automaker Peugeot and at the multistory
Manhattan Tower and the Total Tower because of their commercial links
with the white-controlled government of South Africa.
Police said the first bomb blast occurred at about 1 a.m. (4 p.m. PST) at
the Peugeot building, just west of the Arc de Triomphe. Firemen reported
one person was slightly wounded and the building was severely.
The explosions at the two towers, both at the suburban office complex
La Defense west of downtown Paris, followed moments later.
Fire officials said damage at the Total Tower was heavy but slight at the
Manhattan Tower, and that there were no injuries. The two structures,
which are each about 40 stories tall, are some distance apart in the huge La
Defense complex.
Further details on the explosions were not immediately available.
Both Total, a petroleum company, and Peugeot have business dealings in
South Africa.
Among the major tenants of the Manhattan Tower is COFACE, a state
owned company that provides insurance for foreign trade deals of French
firms.
The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported that the night
guard at the Total Tower received a warning just before the explosion from
an anonymous caller claiming to represent Direct Action.
Direct Action has claimed responsibility for other bombings as well,
most set off in the middle of the night in uninhabited buildings, sometimes
aiming at firms with ties to South Africa.
In September, a series of bombings in Paris killed 11 people and injured
161. Those attacks were claimed by other groups that demanded freedom
for three Middle East terrorists jailed here.
French hostages may be released
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Two anonymous telephone callers to Beirut
newspapers said last night that two French hostages had been freed by
their Moslem kidnappers, but the reports could not be confirmed.
One of the callers indicated the captives might be taken to Damascus,
Syria, and reliable sources in the Syrian capital said the freed hostages had
arrived there and identified them as Marcel Coudari and Camille Sontag.
One of two communiques distributed earlier yesterday the Revolution
ary Justice Organization said some of the group's French hostages would
be freed within 48 hours as a goodwill gesture made possible by Algerian
and Syrian mediation. The group, believed to be composed of Shiite Mos
lems, claimed that France had made promises on unspecified demands.
Shortly before midnignt an anonymous telephone caller told the inde
pendent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar that two French hostages had been
freed in Moslem west Beirut's Ramlet al-Baida residential district at 7:30
p.m. (9:30 a.m. PST).
The second communique signed by the Revolutionary Justice Organiza
tion said the release would take place at 7:30 p.m. at the Hotel Beaurivage
in Ramlet al-Baida near the headquarters of Syrian army officers, but
reporters at the hotel said no hostages had appeared there.
At 7:55 p.m., French diplomat Guy Letrange arrived at the hotel with
three bodyguards in a bullet-proof green Peugeot embassy car. A
bodyguard stepped out and told reporters French Ambassador Christian
Graeff had instructed them to take delivery of any freed hostages.
"We will wait," said the man, who identified -himself as'jtean-Glaude la
Bourdette, the head of GraefTs bodyguards*- ..,....... .
The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir reported late last that it had
received a telephone call from a person claiming to speak for the Revolu
tionary Justice Organization and it said he asked if the paper had received
the report from An-Nahar.
As-Safir said an editor told the caller, "Yes we did. But can you tell us the
names?" of the hostages.
It said the caller, speaking Arabic, replied, "Not right away. You will
know tomorrow. Go take their pictures in Damascus."
If the hostages were turned over to Syrian officials they could have been
sent overland to Damascus.
The two communiques from the extremist group were sent to the Beirut
office of a Western news agency. They did not say how many hostages were
to be freed.
The Revolutionary Justice Organization, thought to be loyal to Iran, has
claimed responsibility for kidnapping three Frenchmen and two
Americans in Moslem west Beirut.
EEC imposes sanctions on Syria
LONDON — European Common Market nations declared sanctions
against Syria yesterday for alleged support of terrorism and demanded that
it end all backing for terror groups.
Greece dissented, but the 11 other members agreed to ban all arms
sales, suspend high-level official visits and increase surveillance of Syrian
missions and operations of Syrian airlines.
President Hafez Assad's government is the Soviet Union's main Middle
East ally. The effect of the arms embargo is expected to be more symbolic
than practical, since Syria gets most of its weapons from the Soviets.
The United States and Canada recalled their ambassadors from Syria
shortly after Britain broke relations with Damascus on Oct. 24. Belgium
later followed suit, the only Common Market member to do so.
France has had a significant arms trade with Syria in the past, but Foreign
Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond said yesterday that deliveries under con
tracts signed in 1982 and 1984 had been halted.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government requested the Common
Market sanctions after Nezar Hindawi, a Jordanian, was convicted Oct. 24 of
trying to smuggle a bomb onto the Israel airliner in his pregnant
girlfriend's hand luggage.
Aquino receives aid from Japan
TOKYO —Japan pledged a low-interest loan of more than $250 million
to the Philippines yesterday, the first day'of President Corazon Aquino's
visit here, ;ind her spokesman said there were indications of more aid to
come.
The loan of 40.4 billion yen ($252.5 million) will finance construction of
a thermal power plant in the Pacific archipelago.
The Philippine armed forces, commanded by Gen. Fidel Ramos, were
put on alert as they were during Aquino's two previous trips abroad, to Sin
gapore and Indonesia in August and the United States in September.
Japan is second only to the United States in aid to the Philippines. It pro
vided 12.9 billion yen ($BO.B million) in grants and technical cooperation
last year in addition to a 49.5 billion yen (about $309 million) loan package.
Aquino's spokesman said there were discussions of funds for a rural em
ployment program and other agricultural aid, including doubling the num
ber of Filipinos in a Japanese-financed technical training program from 30
to 60 next year.
Bishops seek papal meeting
WASHINGTON — The head of the National Conference of Catholic Bis
hops. warning of rising ill will between American Catholics and the Vatican,
called yesterday for Pope John Paul II to meet with the U.S. hierarchy
before his American visit next year.
Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, president of the organiza
tion, did not say exactly what the bishops would tell the pope, who plans to
visit the South and West for a series of speeches and Masses in outdoor
stadiums next September.
But he spoke soberly of' developing estrangement between the Vatican
and parts of the American church over such questions as dissent from high
church authority.

If the hostages were turned over to Syrian officials they could have been
sent overland to Damascus.
The two communiques from the extremist group were sent to the Beirut
office of a Western news agency. They did not say how many hostages were
to be freed.
The Revolutionary Justice Organization, thought to be loyal to Iran, has
claimed responsibility for kidnapping three Frenchmen and two
Americans in Moslem west Beirut.
EEC imposes sanctions on Syria
LONDON — European Common Market nations declared sanctions
against Syria yesterday for alleged support of terrorism and demanded that
it end all backing for terror groups.
Greece dissented, but the 11 other members agreed to ban all arms
sales, suspend high-level official visits and increase surveillance of Syrian
missions and operations of Syrian airlines.
President Hafez Assad's government is the Soviet Union's main Middle
East ally. The effect of the arms embargo is expected to be more symbolic
than practical, since Syria gets most of its weapons from the Soviets.
The United States and Canada recalled their ambassadors from Syria
shortly after Britain broke relations with Damascus on Oct. 24. Belgium
later followed suit, the only Common Market member to do so.
France has had a significant arms trade with Syria in the past, but Foreign
Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond said yesterday that deliveries under con
tracts signed in 1982 and 1984 had been halted.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government requested the Common
Market sanctions after Nezar Hindawi, a Jordanian, was convicted Oct. 24 of
trying to smuggle a bomb onto the Israel airliner in his pregnant
girlfriend's hand luggage.
Aquino receives aid from Japan
TOKYO —Japan pledged a low-interest loan of more than $250 million
to the Philippines yesterday, the first day'of President Corazon Aquino's
visit here, ;ind her spokesman said there were indications of more aid to
come.
The loan of 40.4 billion yen ($252.5 million) will finance construction of
a thermal power plant in the Pacific archipelago.
The Philippine armed forces, commanded by Gen. Fidel Ramos, were
put on alert as they were during Aquino's two previous trips abroad, to Sin
gapore and Indonesia in August and the United States in September.
Japan is second only to the United States in aid to the Philippines. It pro
vided 12.9 billion yen ($BO.B million) in grants and technical cooperation
last year in addition to a 49.5 billion yen (about $309 million) loan package.
Aquino's spokesman said there were discussions of funds for a rural em
ployment program and other agricultural aid, including doubling the num
ber of Filipinos in a Japanese-financed technical training program from 30
to 60 next year.

hops. warning of rising ill will between American Catholics and the Vatican,
called yesterday for Pope John Paul II to meet with the U.S. hierarchy

tion, did not say exactly what the bishops would tell the pope, who plans to
visit the South and West for a series of speeches and Masses in outdoor
stadiums next September.

and parts of the American church over such questions as dissent from high
church authority.

Bombs explode in Paris
PARIS — Bombs exploded at three Paris office buildings almost simulta
neously early yesterday, wounding one person and damaging the
structures, fire officials said.
Direct Action, an extreme left-wing group, reportedly said it set off the
blasts at the headquarters of the automaker Peugeot and at the multistory
Manhattan Tower and the Total Tower because of their commercial links
with the white-controlled government of South Africa.
Police said the first bomb blast occurred at about 1 a.m. (4 p.m. PST) at
the Peugeot building, just west of the Arc de Triomphe. Firemen reported
one person was slightly wounded and the building was severely.
The explosions at the two towers, both at the suburban office complex
La Defense west of downtown Paris, followed moments later.
Fire officials said damage at the Total Tower was heavy but slight at the
Manhattan Tower, and that there were no injuries. The two structures,
which are each about 40 stories tall, are some distance apart in the huge La
Defense complex.
Further details on the explosions were not immediately available.
Both Total, a petroleum company, and Peugeot have business dealings in
South Africa.
Among the major tenants of the Manhattan Tower is COFACE, a state
owned company that provides insurance for foreign trade deals of French
firms.
The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported that the night
guard at the Total Tower received a warning just before the explosion from
an anonymous caller claiming to represent Direct Action.
Direct Action has claimed responsibility for other bombings as well,
most set off in the middle of the night in uninhabited buildings, sometimes
aiming at firms with ties to South Africa.
In September, a series of bombings in Paris killed 11 people and injured
161. Those attacks were claimed by other groups that demanded freedom
for three Middle East terrorists jailed here.
French hostages may be released
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Two anonymous telephone callers to Beirut
newspapers said last night that two French hostages had been freed by
their Moslem kidnappers, but the reports could not be confirmed.
One of the callers indicated the captives might be taken to Damascus,
Syria, and reliable sources in the Syrian capital said the freed hostages had
arrived there and identified them as Marcel Coudari and Camille Sontag.
One of two communiques distributed earlier yesterday the Revolution
ary Justice Organization said some of the group's French hostages would
be freed within 48 hours as a goodwill gesture made possible by Algerian
and Syrian mediation. The group, believed to be composed of Shiite Mos
lems, claimed that France had made promises on unspecified demands.
Shortly before midnignt an anonymous telephone caller told the inde
pendent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar that two French hostages had been
freed in Moslem west Beirut's Ramlet al-Baida residential district at 7:30
p.m. (9:30 a.m. PST).
The second communique signed by the Revolutionary Justice Organiza
tion said the release would take place at 7:30 p.m. at the Hotel Beaurivage
in Ramlet al-Baida near the headquarters of Syrian army officers, but
reporters at the hotel said no hostages had appeared there.
At 7:55 p.m., French diplomat Guy Letrange arrived at the hotel with
three bodyguards in a bullet-proof green Peugeot embassy car. A
bodyguard stepped out and told reporters French Ambassador Christian
Graeff had instructed them to take delivery of any freed hostages.
"We will wait," said the man, who identified -himself as'jtean-Glaude la
Bourdette, the head of GraefTs bodyguards*- ..,....... .
The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir reported late last that it had
received a telephone call from a person claiming to speak for the Revolu
tionary Justice Organization and it said he asked if the paper had received
the report from An-Nahar.
As-Safir said an editor told the caller, "Yes we did. But can you tell us the
names?" of the hostages.
It said the caller, speaking Arabic, replied, "Not right away. You will
know tomorrow. Go take their pictures in Damascus."
If the hostages were turned over to Syrian officials they could have been
