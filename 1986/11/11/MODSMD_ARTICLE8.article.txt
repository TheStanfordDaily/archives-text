# UPDATE
## U.S. to honor SALT through Dec. 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” White Flouse spokesman Larry
Speakes said yesterday that a Washington Post article
reporting that the United States would exceed the
limits of the SALT II arms treaty this week was
"premature."
"The president has said he will exceed the limits,'
Speakes said. "We've said SALT II is no longer in op
eration."
But he added that the bomber that would push the
United States beyond the limits won't be deployed
until near the end of the year.
The United States will exceed the SALT limits when
it deploys the 131st Air Force bomber with the cap-a
bility to carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. The
deployment would push the United States over a
SALT II treaty limit of 1,320 strategic nuclear delivery
vehicles, including land- and sea-based missiles and
cruise missile-carrying bombers.
The SALT II treatv was never ratified bv the Senate,

but both the United States and the Soviet Union
agreed to abide by it. The administration, however,
has accused the Soviets of a number of treaty viola
tions, and President Reagan said earlier this year the
United States would no longer be bound by the
treaty's limits.
Speakes did not specify when the 131st bomber
would be deployed. "A decision has not been made
as to when this bomber becomes part of its operating
units," Speakes said.
Air Force sources said yesterday that plans now
call for the 131 bomber to be deployed at its opera
tional base in Fort Worth, Texas, on Dec. 22. They
added that this bomber is expected to be rolled out
of a paint hangar in San Antonio within the next
week. It will then be subjected to various tests, in
cluding flight tests, over the next month.
The remarks by Air Force officials yesterday
clarified statements last week in which the 131st

cruise missile carrying bomber was said to be leaving
San Antonio for its operational base this week.
Arms control experts disagree over whether die
SALT II violation will occur when the bomber is
rolled out of the hangar or when it is actually
deployed.
Some arms control officials argue that the SALT II
limit will officially be exceeded as soon as the 131st
cruise missile-carrying bomber can potentially be
observed by Soviet satellite reconnaissance. Others
within the administration believe that the violation
will not occur until December, because final testing
of the bomber will not be completed until then.
Speakes yesterday raised the possibility that even
tually the United States will take other strategic weap
ons systems, such as aging submarines, out of service
to compensate for some of the additional 8525. "That
is a presidential decision," he said.
