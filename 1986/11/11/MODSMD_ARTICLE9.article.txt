# Soviet: U.S. absurd

### 
MOSCOW — Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze accused the
United States yesterday of trying to
"erode the ground reached in Reyk
javik" and demanded anew that a sup
erpower arms accord include a ban
on space weapons.
Shevardnadze characterized his
meetings last week with Secretary of
State George Shultz as a "retreat to the
pre-Reykjavik position" in U.S.-Soviet
relations, adding, "It goes without
saying that this is a step backward."
He spoke in Russian at a one-hour,
50-minute news conference, his first in
Moscow since becoming foreign mini
ster in July 1985.
Shevardnadze said that Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev and President
Reagan agreed during their Oct. 11-12
Iceland summit to steps that would
eliminate medium-range missiles from
Europe within five years and all strate
gic nuclear weapons within a decade.
But he said Shultz outlined a revised
and watered-down version of the
agreements in principle reached by
the two leaders.
"What they offered to us in Vienna
can be compared to a political theater
of the absurd," Shevardnadze said.
"The United States wanted to record
positions that would erode the ground
reached in Reykjavik."
The news conference was the latest
stage of a full-fledged media campaign
by the Kremlin following the summit.
Gorbachev held a news conference in

Reykjavik and gave two nationally
televised addresses after his return to
spell out the Kremlin's view of the
meetings.
The Kremlin also released two pur
ported quotes from Reagan during the
summit that it contended proved he
agreed to scrap all strategic weapons.
Yesterday's news conference
seemed intended to underline the So
viet view following the Vienna talks,
which ended with no further agree
ment on high-level superpower
meetings.
Shevardnadze said he presented
Shultz with a framework agreement
that the two of them could have signed
and passed on to arms negotiators in
Geneva for working into the text of an
arms control treaty.
The package restated the Soviet
side's understanding of the Reykjavik
agreements on strategic and medium
range missiles and called for a commit
ment by both sides to observe for 10
years the provisions of the 1972 anti
ballistic missile treaty.
It was the ABM issue which
prevented an arms agreement at Reyk
javik, since the Soviets claim the treaty
prohibits testing of weaponry in space.
U.S. administration officials have
refused to enter into an accord that
would restrict research and develop
ment into Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative for a space-based defense sys
tem, dubbed "Star Wars."
