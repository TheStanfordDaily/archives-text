New Board Needs Beer!
Students can apply for the new Police-Community Cooperation
Board through the ASSU Nominations Commission. Inere are
positions for five students. Applications are due in the Business
Office by Friday, November 21.
On December 2 the police advisory board sponsored by the University
will will begin. A year after the protests that showed the Board was ne
cessary, a year after students called for the Board, it will be there.
Thank you, sir. May I please have another?
On the second weekend in October, 1985, the ASSU got calls from mem
bers of Stanford Out of South Africa who had been at the protest at Old
Union the day before. We were told that students had been physically
abused by the police in the process of removing them from their non
violent protest and that one of the students, Robbie Perkins, had been
beaten by the county police.
Early reports had it hat he was eaten by police, but a call to Marlin Perkins con
firmed that police are strictly vegetarians.
The University President asked a renowned criminal law professor to
conduct an investigation to determine what had occurred and whether it
was in fact proper. The professor reviewed vital evidence and inter
viewed everyone involved who had legal freedom to speak. He produced
a thirty-page report which he handed to the President, who accepted its
conclusions.
Those who are unable to read the report can catch the movie.
The report concluded that some of the procedures the police has used were im
proper, but in essence it said the situation was a difficult one in which everyone
had done the best they could.
Now stop bothering Mommy and go to bed.
For many people this didn't answer the real quesitions: Why should
peaceful student protesters on their own campus be treated violently?
Why was it a Black student who had been focused on? What did stu
dents have a right to expect from their police?
What do you adato powdered water? If you name your dog ''Stay "can you ever
call it 112
In November the ASSU set up a Special Investigative Committee to look
into the issue. Its job was not to duplicate the University's report but to
answer questions raised or left unresolved by that report.
The grail, you must bring back the grail.
The committee received much cooperation from the University in some
areas but was stonewalled in others: in particular, it was not given access
to the critical videotape, which could have shown what actually hap
pened. In mid-January it issued its report to the Senate, a document
mostly a critique of the University's and the ASSU's report. It was fac
tually flawed in several areas, but contained two important recommen
dations: that the Senate seek a professional investigator from outside the
University, and that it press for a University-sponsored, broad-based
community police review board.
Hearing this good idea, some students decided to make a "Police of Stanford"
calendar, which prompted many letters to the Daily, which prompted them to
make a report. Not to be outdone, theChaparral issued a report which, while not
funny, was the most accurate.
The Senate approved the report, and the Committee went back to work.
They contacted investigators, raised money by passing out radical flyers
to a vast crowd waiting outside Mem Aud to hear Bishop Tutu speak,
and they got the Senate to put a Special Fee on the ballot for a student
run police review board.
The Senate mistakenly thought the board would review the next Police album.
In late March 1985 the Dean of Students and the President agreed to es
tablish a Board, and the ASSU yanked the Special Fee. The new Board
would function like other University committee — students, faculty,
staff; issuing reports on issues to decision-makers — and it would not be
a review board but would be an advisory one. It would look into police
policies and procedures and try to work with the police and students in a
positive way to help both. Most importantly, it would increase commu
nications between both sides.
Three Senators and three other students worked with the Dean of Stu
dents in the Spring and Summer to write a charge to the board to detail
its structure, operations, and limitations. By September they were still
working. In late October the students and the Dean decided to go with
the board, now named hopefully to be named the Police-Community
Cooperation Board, as it stood.
Their next project is toxic waste in America.
What will it do?
• Identify problems through community comment, gather information,
and clarify the complaint system.
• Receive complaints for collecting data.
• Make recommendations about policies and practices to the President.
• Facilitate communication and understanding about police and security
matters.
•Go to the new pub at Encina Station, CARDINAL SIN.
What it won't do?
• Hold legal authority over police.
• Investigate every case.
•Attend 49'ers games.
•Stay home when it can go to the new pub, CARDINAL SIN.
Will it work? We think so. We think that just by getting people together
in a legitimate forum to talk about the issues, it'll start to work. And for
this year, at least, we'll have strong members of the affected communit
ies.They'll make it work.
Dodge. America's truck.
What does this show? Maybe not much; it depends on what the Panel
does once it starts. But maybe this shows that students can change
things.

Well, not really. But if you:
• Are concerned about student health at Stanford (which
you damn well should be).
• Have complaints about Cowell Health Center.
• Want to get involved in a hip ASSU task force.
Then join the Student Health Advisory Review and
Evaluation Task Force (SHARETF). See? Not a thing about

the board, now named hopefully to be named the Police-Community
Cooperation Board, as it stood.
Their next project is toxic waste in America.
What will it do?
• Identify problems through community comment, gather information,
and clarify the complaint system.
• Receive complaints for collecting data.
• Make recommendations about policies and practices to the President.
• Facilitate communication and understanding about police and security
matters.
•Go to the new pub at Encina Station, CARDINAL SIN.
What it won't do?
• Hold legal authority over police.
• Investigate every case.
•Attend 49'ers games.
•Stay home when it can go to the new pub, CARDINAL SIN.
Will it work? We think so. We think that just by getting people together
in a legitimate forum to talk about the issues, it'll start to work. And for
this year, at least, we'll have strong members of the affected communit
ies.They'll make it work.

What does this show? Maybe not much; it depends on what the Panel
does once it starts. But maybe this shows that students can change
things.

Well, not really. But if you:
• Are concerned about student health at Stanford (which
you damn well should be).
• Have complaints about Cowell Health Center.
• Want to get involved in a hip ASSU task force.
Then join the Student Health Advisory Review and
Evaluation Task Force (SHARETF). See? Not a thing about

New Board Needs Beer!
Students can apply for the new Police-Community Cooperation
Board through the ASSU Nominations Commission. Inere are
positions for five students. Applications are due in the Business
Office by Friday, November 21.
On December 2 the police advisory board sponsored by the University
will will begin. A year after the protests that showed the Board was ne
cessary, a year after students called for the Board, it will be there.
Thank you, sir. May I please have another?
On the second weekend in October, 1985, the ASSU got calls from mem
bers of Stanford Out of South Africa who had been at the protest at Old
Union the day before. We were told that students had been physically
abused by the police in the process of removing them from their non
violent protest and that one of the students, Robbie Perkins, had been
beaten by the county police.
Early reports had it hat he was eaten by police, but a call to Marlin Perkins con
firmed that police are strictly vegetarians.
The University President asked a renowned criminal law professor to
conduct an investigation to determine what had occurred and whether it
was in fact proper. The professor reviewed vital evidence and inter
viewed everyone involved who had legal freedom to speak. He produced
a thirty-page report which he handed to the President, who accepted its
conclusions.
Those who are unable to read the report can catch the movie.
The report concluded that some of the procedures the police has used were im
proper, but in essence it said the situation was a difficult one in which everyone
had done the best they could.
Now stop bothering Mommy and go to bed.
For many people this didn't answer the real quesitions: Why should
peaceful student protesters on their own campus be treated violently?
Why was it a Black student who had been focused on? What did stu
dents have a right to expect from their police?
What do you adato powdered water? If you name your dog ''Stay "can you ever
call it 112
In November the ASSU set up a Special Investigative Committee to look
into the issue. Its job was not to duplicate the University's report but to
answer questions raised or left unresolved by that report.
The grail, you must bring back the grail.
The committee received much cooperation from the University in some
areas but was stonewalled in others: in particular, it was not given access
to the critical videotape, which could have shown what actually hap
pened. In mid-January it issued its report to the Senate, a document
mostly a critique of the University's and the ASSU's report. It was fac
tually flawed in several areas, but contained two important recommen
dations: that the Senate seek a professional investigator from outside the
University, and that it press for a University-sponsored, broad-based
community police review board.
Hearing this good idea, some students decided to make a "Police of Stanford"
calendar, which prompted many letters to the Daily, which prompted them to
make a report. Not to be outdone, theChaparral issued a report which, while not
funny, was the most accurate.
The Senate approved the report, and the Committee went back to work.
They contacted investigators, raised money by passing out radical flyers
to a vast crowd waiting outside Mem Aud to hear Bishop Tutu speak,
and they got the Senate to put a Special Fee on the ballot for a student
run police review board.
The Senate mistakenly thought the board would review the next Police album.
In late March 1985 the Dean of Students and the President agreed to es
tablish a Board, and the ASSU yanked the Special Fee. The new Board
would function like other University committee — students, faculty,
staff; issuing reports on issues to decision-makers — and it would not be
a review board but would be an advisory one. It would look into police
policies and procedures and try to work with the police and students in a
positive way to help both. Most importantly, it would increase commu
nications between both sides.
Three Senators and three other students worked with the Dean of Stu
dents in the Spring and Summer to write a charge to the board to detail
its structure, operations, and limitations. By September they were still
working. In late October the students and the Dean decided to go with
the board, now named hopefully to be named the Police-Community
Cooperation Board, as it stood.
