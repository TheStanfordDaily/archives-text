# Two French hostages freed

### 
PARIS — Two Frenchmen freed by Shiite Moslem
kidnappers after months of captivity in Lebanon
came home yesterday and were greeted by Premier
Jacques Chirac, who thanked Syria for helping to ar
range the release.
Camille Sontag, 85, and Marcel Coudari, 54, were
released in West Beirut Monday night and turned
over to French envoys in Damascus, Syria, less than
12 hours later.
When they arrived at Orly Airport outside Paris,
Chirac thanked Syria, Saudia Arabia and Algeria for
helping arrange the release of the captives.
Coudari, when asked if he had news of other
French hostages, replied: "No. But 1 can tell you that
things will happen soon." Asked if he was certain,
Coudari said: "Well, yes, more or less."
He told reporters, citing "a pretty official source,"
that French hostage Michel Seurat apparently had
died of natural causes. The pro-Iranian Shiite Mos
lem group Islamic Jihad announced March 5 that he
had been killed.
Sontag came down the steps of the French jet into
the arms of his 84-year-old wife, and they hugged and
kissed as Chirac beamed. Blanche Sontag then
fumbled in her handbag and handed a small object to
her husband — apparently a replacement for the

hearing aid broken during his abduction.
Earlier in Damascus, both men looked well after
their ordeal, but the white-haired Sontag appeared
frail and nervous. He was supported by two burly
Syrian officials when he walked into a chandeliered
room in the Syrian Foreign Ministry for yesterday's
handover formalities.
Coudari, a businessman, chain-smoked American
cigarettes as he and Sontag, a retired auto dealer,
waited for more than an hour in an anteroom.
He said Sontag was held in an underground prison
in South Beirut with five other Western captives.
Speaking for Sontag, Coudari said one of the
prisoners was an Irishman. Brian Keenan, an Irish
teacher, was kidnapped in West Beirut April 11 and
has not been heard from since. He is is the only Irish
man among 17 foreigners still missing in Lebanon.
No group has claimed Keenan's kidnapping or
made any demands for his release.
The identities and nationalities of the other four
men were not known. Coudari said Sontag saw them
but was not allowed to talk to them.
Sontag conveyed, however, that one prisoner on
Monday slipped him a scrap of paper on which was
written: "I am Irish. Please tell my family."
According to Coudari, Sontag did not know

whether Americans were among the other prisoners.
Six Americans are among the missing.
The group that held Coudari and Sontag, the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, also claimed it
kidnapped Americans Frank Reed and Edward Tracy.
Coudari said he had lived for 12 years in Lebanon
and 13 in Syria. He was kidnapped in West Beirut in
February, but Revolutionary Justice first said it held
him on Sept. 24. Coudari did not explain the time lag.
Sontag, a Beirut resident for more than 40 years,
was abducted May 7.
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa declared
amid the clamor: "The Syrian government has
helped in obtaining the release of the French
hostages. We've done everything we could to get the
release of (all) hostages and will continue to do so."
Syria has helped free five Frenchmen this year.
One American, the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, reached
freedom through Damascus in July.
Al-Sharaa, clearly stung by what Syria says is a cam
paign by the United States, Britain and Israel to is
olate Syria with allegations that it backs terrorists,
stressed at the handover formalities: "Those
countries that show hostility to Syria should expect
the same hostility from Syria."
