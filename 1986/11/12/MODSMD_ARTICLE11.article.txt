# Iranian deals disappointing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The White House
in September 1985 believed it had ar
ranged the release of at least two and
possibly all six American hostages held
by a pro-Iranian terrorist group in
Lebanon after permitting two
planeloads of arms to be shipped from
Israel to Tehran, informed sources said
yesterday.
But the subsequent freeing of only
the Rev. Benjamin Weir on Sept. 14,
1985, was the first of several bitter dis
appointments suffered by President
Reagan and his aides, the sources said.
Although during the next 14 months
the Iranians repeatedly promised
more than they delivered, the White
House was reluctant to believe that
Tehran and the pro-Iranian Islamic
Jihad group in Lebanon were dealing
duplicitously, the sources added.
For four days after Weir's release,
Reagan withheld the news in hopes
that other hostages would be freed, ac
cording to one knowledgeable source.
Before returning to the United States,

Weir was secretly taken to the U.S.
naval base in Norfolk where he was
questioned for up to 12 hours by U.S.
military officers considering possible
contingency plans for a rescue mission
of the other hostages, sources said.
Such planning was eventually
aborted because of concern that the
hostages were being moved too fre
quently for U.S. forces to launch a res
cue attempt, the sources said.
The marathon debriefing session in
Norfolk provoked an argument among
U.S. officials on the scene and subse
quently led to a more routine schedule
for interviewing other hostages after
their release.
Weir and five other hostages were
held by Islamic Jihad, which wanted to
use the Americans to gain freedom for
17 terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait for
two bombings there.
After Weir, two more of those
hostages were released, reportedly
after additional arms shipments were
made. Rev. Lawrence Jenco was freed

last July, followed by David Jacobsen
on Nov. 2.
As in the past, the White House ex
pected at least one more hostage to ap
pear with Jacobsen and was disap
pointed when that did not happen,
sources said. Islamic Jihad may now be
less responsive to Tehran since they
have given up three of their hostages
without getting anyone released from
the Kuwaiti jails, the sources added.
One source familiar with the pro
gram said of the White House, "They
were dealing with Iranians who have
been known as tough bargainers for
thousands of years." Another source
added that during the past year, "only
die White House knew the nature of
the agreement" leading to the three
hostage releases and that the White
House often "speculated it would be
for more than one person."
The program was initially run by
then-National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, who continued to take an
active role even after leaving the gov-

ernment, sources said.
One source said the White House of
ficials were warned by other adminis
tration officials that "once the program
started, the Iranians would stretch it
out for as long as they could." Every
time the president or a White House
spokesman said a hostage release
"slipped through our fingers," they
meant the Iranians had not lived up to
their part of the deal, the source
added.
Although the White House program
has permitted arms to go to Iran, con
trary to the stated U.S. policy of em
bargoing weapons to Tehran, it has
steadfastly refused to ask Kuwait to
release the jailed terrorists.
Islamic Jihad is still believed to hold
hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas
Sutherland. William Buckley, the
former political officer at the U.S. Em
bassy in Beirut, was also held by the
group, although some reports say he
may have been killed.
