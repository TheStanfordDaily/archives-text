# If you really want to know how to improve your grades, your career, and your life, there's an upcoming lecture you shouldn't miss.
## 
### 
Dear Student,
There's something you can
do for a short time each
day that will improve
every aspect of your life—your
grades, your future career, your
relationships, everything—all at
the same time. What's more, it's
easy to do. Over 1,000,000 stu
dents have experienced the bene
fits. And you can too.
You'll learn about it soon at
a special free lecture on the
Transcendental Meditation tech
nique, and regardless of what
you've already heard about TM,
this entertaining talk will surprise
and enlighten you. More than
that, it may well change your life.
My name is Kevin Blair. I'm
president of the student govern
ment at Maharishi International
University, where students, fac
ulty, and staff all practice the TM
technique. I want to tell you three
things about the upcoming lecture:
lAt the lecture, you'll learn
how the simple, natural TM
technique, which is practiced
for 15-20 minutes twice a day,
brings profound benefits to mind
and body, and how these benefits
automatically improve one's social
behavior, school and job per
formance, and much more.

" '■7' xperiencing the unified
Mil field through the TM
technique redly gives me more
support of nature. As soon as 1
began TM, everything became
easier, and my grade-point
average went up a whole point!"

Scientific Research
2 You'll also learn about the
vast amount of scientific
research that's been done on
TM (more than 350 studies
worldwide over the past 15 years).

And you'll learn that a lot of the
research findings are directly rele
vant to your personal and aca
demic development as a student.
Here, for example, is a partial list
of the research results in the field
of education:
■ increased intelligence
■ improved comprehension,
concentration, and memory
■ increased learning ability
■ increased speed in solving
problems
■ increased creativity
■ broader comprehension and
ability to focus attention
■ improved academic
performance
■ reduced stress and anxiety
■ decreased use of drugs,
alcohol, and cigarettes
■ increased happiness
■ improved relationships be
tween students and teachers
■ improved mind-body
coordination
■ improved athletic performance
Now, I'm sure you'd like to
have some of those qualities grow
ing in your life. Well you can.
And the beautiful thing is that
these qualities grow naturally,
simply as a result of practicing the
TM technique.
World Peace
3 Finally, if you are con
cerned not just with your
own future, but also the
future of our nation and the
world, there's even more reason
to attend the lecture.
This is because the TM tech
nique doesn't just help the in
dividual. The coherence generated
when people practice TM extends
to society as a whole. Research has
shown that when as little as the
square root of one percent of a

population practices the TM pro
gram and its advanced aspects, the
entire population becomes more
orderly, peaceful, and progressive.
"TTIV/f the best antidote
M. It JL to stress I know of.
When individuals are free of
stress, they behave more har
moniously. I'm convinced that if
people practiced TM, world
peace would he a reality."
—Kurleigh D. King
Director, Institute for World
Leadership
Former Director-General,
Caribbean Community and
Common Market
This "Super Radiance Effect"
has been demonstrated in commun
ities, cities—even entire nations.
This brings great hope for the
future, because it means that the
age-old problems of world peace
may at last have a solution.
II Works!
If you're wondering how one
simple technique can bring
so many benefits to mind,
body, behavior, and even the world
as a whole, I urge you to attend the
free lecture. The explanation you'll
hear is at once simple, scientific,
and profound.

" 'TXJi ,fu most
JL ITJL important part of
being a peak performer. It
gives you the ability to excel in
an environment of stress, to
make rapid decisions based on
rapid changes, and to do so
functioning very well."
—Christopher Hegarty, President
Hegarty and Associates
San Francisco, CA

You'll hear, for example, about
the unified field of all the laws of
nature as described by modern
physics and by ancient Vedic
science. And about how the TM
technique lets you experience the
unified field within your own con
sciousness. And about how that ex
perience, gained regularly,
brings you the support of all the
laws of nature.

" WW7hen you practice TM,
tt you can experience the
full range of education—not
just gaining classroom know
ledge, but developing the
knower, and that's yourself!"
—Karen Blasdell
Ph.D. candidate

University

The main thing, however, is
that TM works. I know from my
own experience. I've been practic
ing the technique for 6 years, and
its made me more relaxed, yet
more dynamic and productive. As
a result, I'm enjoying greater suc
cess—both in and out of the
classroom!
Of course, whether you start the
TM technique or not is up to you.
But doesn't it make sense to at
least attend the lecture? If even ten
percent of what I've said about
TM proves to be true, think what
it could mean for your achieve
ment and happiness for the rest of
your life.

don't hesitate to bring

doing a great thing for
them as well!

Lecture Thursday November 13: 3:30 pm - oak east; 8 pm - sequoia rm


His Holinevi Maharishi Mahc-sh founder of
the Transcendental Meditation Program
Dear Student,
There's something you can
do for a short time each
day that will improve
every aspect of your life—your
grades, your future career, your
relationships, everything—all at
the same time. What's more, it's
easy to do. Over 1,000,000 stu
dents have experienced the bene
fits. And you can too.
You'll learn about it soon at
a special free lecture on the
Transcendental Meditation tech
nique, and regardless of what
you've already heard about TM,
this entertaining talk will surprise
and enlighten you. More than
that, it may well change your life.
My name is Kevin Blair. I'm
president of the student govern
ment at Maharishi International
University, where students, fac
ulty, and staff all practice the TM
technique. I want to tell you three
things about the upcoming lecture:
lAt the lecture, you'll learn
how the simple, natural TM
technique, which is practiced
for 15-20 minutes twice a day,
brings profound benefits to mind
and body, and how these benefits
automatically improve one's social
behavior, school and job per
formance, and much more.

" '■7' xperiencing the unified
Mil field through the TM
technique redly gives me more
support of nature. As soon as 1
began TM, everything became
easier, and my grade-point
average went up a whole point!"
—Sam ttoothby

Scientific Research
2 You'll also learn about the
vast amount of scientific
research that's been done on
TM (more than 350 studies
worldwide over the past 15 years).

And you'll learn that a lot of the
research findings are directly rele
vant to your personal and aca
demic development as a student.
Here, for example, is a partial list
of the research results in the field
of education:
■ increased intelligence
■ improved comprehension,
concentration, and memory
■ increased learning ability
■ increased speed in solving
problems
■ increased creativity
■ broader comprehension and
ability to focus attention
■ improved academic
performance
■ reduced stress and anxiety
■ decreased use of drugs,
alcohol, and cigarettes
■ increased happiness
■ improved relationships be
tween students and teachers
■ improved mind-body
coordination
■ improved athletic performance
Now, I'm sure you'd like to
have some of those qualities grow
ing in your life. Well you can.
And the beautiful thing is that
these qualities grow naturally,
simply as a result of practicing the
TM technique.
World Peace
3 Finally, if you are con
cerned not just with your
own future, but also the
future of our nation and the
world, there's even more reason
to attend the lecture.
This is because the TM tech
nique doesn't just help the in
dividual. The coherence generated
when people practice TM extends
to society as a whole. Research has
shown that when as little as the
square root of one percent of a

population practices the TM pro
gram and its advanced aspects, the
entire population becomes more
orderly, peaceful, and progressive.
"TTIV/f the best antidote
M. It JL to stress I know of.
When individuals are free of
stress, they behave more har
moniously. I'm convinced that if
people practiced TM, world
peace would he a reality."
—Kurleigh D. King
Director, Institute for World
Leadership
Former Director-General,
Caribbean Community and
Common Market
This "Super Radiance Effect"
has been demonstrated in commun
ities, cities—even entire nations.
This brings great hope for the
future, because it means that the
age-old problems of world peace
may at last have a solution.
II Works!
If you're wondering how one
simple technique can bring
so many benefits to mind,
body, behavior, and even the world
as a whole, I urge you to attend the
free lecture. The explanation you'll
hear is at once simple, scientific,
and profound.

" 'TXJi ,fu most
JL ITJL important part of
being a peak performer. It
gives you the ability to excel in
an environment of stress, to
make rapid decisions based on
rapid changes, and to do so
functioning very well."
—Christopher Hegarty, President
Hegarty and Associates
San Francisco, CA

You'll hear, for example, about
the unified field of all the laws of
nature as described by modern
physics and by ancient Vedic
science. And about how the TM
technique lets you experience the
unified field within your own con
sciousness. And about how that ex
perience, gained regularly,
brings you the support of all the
laws of nature.

" WW7hen you practice TM,
tt you can experience the
full range of education—not
just gaining classroom know
ledge, but developing the
knower, and that's yourself!"
—Karen Blasdell
Ph.D. candidate
Neuroscience
Maharishi International
University

The main thing, however, is
that TM works. I know from my
own experience. I've been practic
ing the technique for 6 years, and
its made me more relaxed, yet
more dynamic and productive. As
a result, I'm enjoying greater suc
cess—both in and out of the
classroom!
Of course, whether you start the
TM technique or not is up to you.
But doesn't it make sense to at
least attend the lecture? If even ten
percent of what I've said about
TM proves to be true, think what
it could mean for your achieve
ment and happiness for the rest of
your life.
