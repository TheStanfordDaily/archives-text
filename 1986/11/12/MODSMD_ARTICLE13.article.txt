# CIR report: 'Apartheid in South Africa: Does it warrant our special focus?'
## 
### 
South Africa unci its systems of apartheid
(separation of racial groups) have received
great attention and condemnation in recent
years. In endeavoring to follow a socially re
sponsible investment policy at Stanford,
South Africa has been given unique atten
tion by Stanford s Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility and Board of Trustees.
This paper addresses the question Does
apartheid in South Africa warrant our spe
cial focus?
Although South Africa is but one of many
countries that engage in insitutional viola
tion of human rights (1), the combined
manner and scale in which it represses are
unique. "South Africa today represents an
especially repugnant form of institutional
ized racial injustice — special because of
the degree to which a small minority
engages in restraints upon human freedom
and violation of basic human rights." (2)
South Africa is further distinguished by the
way that its government, comprised of a ra
cial minority, through official policies and
laws, has systematically institutionalized the
economic, social and political repression of
the racial majority. That official repression
affects every aspect of black life, from health
to freedom of movement to education.
Stanford Political Scientist, David Aber
nethy, has cited additional interrelated fac
tors that reinforce South Africa's status as a
"worst case" (3):
• violation of basic human rights is not only
regularly practiced, but is an explicitly
stated purpose of the minority government;
• unequal political status and rights are
based solely on race,
• the political system deliberately
humiliates its majority population;
• the government intentionally breaks up
normal family life of blacks;
• the apartheid system is designed to
produce the "right" amount of mobile, in
expensive black labor, which benfits the
corporate world.
South Africa expressly represents itself to
be a "Christian" nation, a "bastion of West
ern Christian civilization," and, as such, a
bulwark against "atheistic communism."
The ruling white minority party is officially
named the "Christian Nationalist Party. In
making the claim to be a Christian nation,
South Africa invites criticism and con
demnation from those in the wider world
who have a different understanding of the
Christian message. The Dutch Reformed
Churches in South Africa withdrew from
the World Council of Churches and were

expelled from the World Reformed Alliance
because of this Ideally, Christianity has to
be concerned with the liberation of the op
pressed, with sinrial justice, and with being
an inclusive (rather than an exclusive) com
munity. South Africa expressly, cynically,
and systematically denies these concerns. It
resists the liberation of the oppressed It
denies justice (political, economic, and le
gal) to the majority of its people. And it
regards only those who are white as authen
tic members of the ("mother") community
of God's people, paternalistically relegating
those who are brown or black to second
class, "daughter" status.
Compounding this situation is the
equally unique historical relationship that
South Africa has with American corpora
tions, and through them, American inves
tors. Nowhere are American investors so in
volved with the economy and political sys
tem of a country considered to be such a
large-scale violator of human rights. (South
Africa is highly dependent on the type of
American investment needed to make the
transformation from a mining and agricul
tural economy to a manufacturing and high
technology economy.) This vests in Western
institutions — particularly the United States
— a greater responsibility to exert influ
ence on a South African government which
identifies so integrally with the West. (4)
South Africa's membership in the
capitalistic world economy is not recent.
"Since the end of the Anglo-Boer War,
South Africa has been integrated into the
capitalist world economy by every social,
economic, cultural and geopolitical bond
that history can bestow. The present rulers
never tire of telling the world that they are a
Western outpost on the dark continent." (5)
This relationship was recognized by
Chester Crocker, the architect of President
Reagan's constructive engagement policy,
when he stated diat "South Africa is an inte
gral and important element in the Western
global system. Historically, South Africa is
by its nature a part of us." (6)
Anglo American, South Africa's largest
corporation, is illustrative of the inter
twined nature of the South African and
American economies. When Anglo Ameri
can was formed in 1917, it was capitalized
largely with American funds, primarily from
Morgan Guarantee Bank, then headed by
Herbert Hoover. The very name of the cor
poration was chosen to encourage Ameri
can investors. (7) Today American invest
ment in Anglo American exceeds $100 mil

lion dollars, and the corporation is a
transnational conglomerate with interest in
the financial, mining and industrial sectors.
Its assets exceed <16 billion (H) Anglo
American is now also an integral part of the
American economic system, representing
the United States largest foreign investor,
holding its assets through over 100 separate
companies primarily in the mining, con
struction, chemical, steel and energy fields.
One of its companies, the Mineral and
Resource Corporation, is a significant
owner of Phibro Salomon Inc., the parent
company of Salomon Brothers Inc., which
in turn is the largest investment banking
firm in the United States (9)
The United States has been South Africa s
largest trading partner since 1978. (10) In
19H4, the United States imported $2.5 bil
lion in goods, about 12 percent of all South
African exports South Africa in turn bought
12.27 billion in American goods. Some of
their imports were in areas vital to main
taining South Africa's status quo, such as
aircraft parts and computer equipment.
(11)
In addition to its trading relationship, the
United States is second only to Great Britain
as an investor in South Africa. Again, some
of these investments are in areas most cru
cial to South Africa; American corporations
control 75 percent of the computer indus
try, 50 percent of the oil industry and 23
percent of the automobile industry. (12)
Yet the bulk of U.S. investment in South
Africa has been in manufacturing, which
historically has been the strongest sector of
the economy, and, not coincidentally, also
that part of the economy most dependent
on cheap, unskilled black labor. For exam
ple, 90 percent of the mining work force
and 75 percent of the manufacturing work
force are black.
A brief review of South Africa's use of the
automobile industry further illustrates the
role that U.S. corporations have played in
the development of the country's economy.
In the 19605, the South African government
targeted motor vehicle manufacturing and
assembly as the means for achieving indus
trialization of South Africa. (13) The govern
ment implemented its policy by the use of
tariffs to force automobile manufacturers to
use locally produced South African compo
nents. The automobile industry thrived,
fueling a demand for South African -
produced products such as steel, rubber
and glass. And, of course, it was black labor
that produced the products from which the

white population benfitted most, at a rate of
niore than one vehicle pet two people; in
contrast, the black population owns only
one vehicle per 30 persons.
American car makers also fate well under
the government's plan. In the late 1960s the
big three American companies produced 60
percent of all the cars in South Africa. Ford,
the largest U.S employer in South Africa,
was the number one car producer in the
country. General Motors was fith. Ironically,
although both Ford and General Motors
regularly receive top ratings on the Sullivan
Principles, they remain able to avoid U.S.
export regulations and sell to the South
African military and police because the
components of their products are not of
U.S. origin (14) Recently, General Motors
Corporation's policy has changed. General
Motors will no longer sell to the South
African military and police. They also have
announced that they will be withdrawing
from South Africa.
The fact that the South African economy
was built and still depends on black labor
has not moved the ruling minority govern
ment to accord blacks political rights. This
position was expressed by former Prime
Minister Volster:
"The fact of the matter is this: we need
them because they work for us; after all we
pay them for their work — but the fact that
they work for us can never entitle them to
claim political rights. Not now, nor in the
future — and in no circumstances can we
grant them political rights in our territory,
neither now nor ever." (15)
Although there are other countries in
which American companies invest that
grievously violate human rights, none does
so in the manner and scale of South Africa.
Moreover, in none of these countries are
American citizens and private institutions,
as corporate stockholders, so heavily and
directly involved. Insofar as the purchasing
of stock brings with it the obligation of re
sponsible ownership, American stock
holders — universities included — have
unique reasons to take their responsibility
seriously in South Africa.
