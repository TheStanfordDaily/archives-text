Sexual assaults such as the three that occurred on
campus last week are becoming increasingly common at
Stanford.
Women are no longer safe to go alone to the Dish
even during the day, as two women discovered when an
unidentified man assaulted them there last Saturday. And
even dorm bathrooms — facilities used by every person
on campus — can now be considered a potential source
of danger for women after an unidentified man harassed
a woman taking a shower in a dorm a week ago.
In the past, steps have been taken to prevent sexual as
saults against women. Such programs as SURE, the now
defunct ASSURE, self-defense courses and rape educa
tion projects were initiated to help women protect them
selves in situations when they are most vulnerable, such
as walking alone at night.
But despite these helpful programs, the problem obvi
ously still exists. Women continue to be vulnerable at
Stanford. More effective solutions to the problem of
sexual assaults on campus need to be found, and found
quickly.
The University should take the lead in guaranteeing
better safety for women by improving the lighting on

campus at night. Campus Drive, Santa Teresa, Panama
and roads farther away from the center of campus all cur
rently have inadequate lighting. Many women on campus
consider the Dish taboo at night because the trails are
notorious for being completely dark.
In addition to basic facilities, the University should
help to fund SURE, which offers escort services to
women between 6 p.m. and midnight. SURE itself needs
to become more visible to more women, and it needs to
expand its hours. Many women face walking alone in the
dark at 5:30 p.m. as well as after midnight, simply be
cause of SURE's limited hours. The University, which has
the responsibility to protect its students, should be
facilitating the expansion of programs like SURE .
But the most basic way to solve the problem of
women's safety is education. Residences should hold
meetings discussing what each student on this campus
can do to make Stanford a safer place for women. The
Stanford Police should volunteer for off-duty dorm out
reach to help educate students on the issue.
Men and women on campus need to be aware of the
dangers that exist for women at Stanford and to take the
steps necessary to minimize that danger.
