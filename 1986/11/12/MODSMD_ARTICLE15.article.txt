Column reinforces
fear, prejudices
Whatever its intended meaning,
Scott Shaeffer's recent Daily short
story (Nov. 6) effectively reinforced
harmful stereotypes and fostered a
complacence to overcoming the
hatred, fear and prejudice that plague
our campus and our society.
Unlike the character Alberto in
Shaeffer's story, every person who is
Puerto Rican, gay, Catholic or a mem
ber of any other minority group is a
unique individual who cannot be
defined by his or her minority status
alone. People who happen to be
minorities are also people who have
many important characteristics that
make them real and full human
beings, yet few if any of them possess
the negative stereotypes that society
inaccurately attributes to them. Al
berto, however, has no characteristics
Jbeyond the stereotypes — he is a
cowering, stammering, pot-smoking,
completely sexual being who only
needs "a f-f-few minutes in the sack"
with a non-gay man to make him
happy. By portraying Alberto as a
simple embodiment of these
stereotypes, Shaeffer perpetuates the
age-old misconceptions that have
been used to justify fear and hatred of
the myriad different kinds of people
in our society.
In addition, Shaeffer's portrayal of
is insulting to the role white,
Protestant, heterosexual men can play
in ending oppression. Ishmael is
given only two routes to take in order
to end oppression: He is either the
"missionary" stooping to pick up the
"white man's burden," or he
embraces an identity of oppression in
order to "belong." Hence, the white
man is seen to be condescending or
guilt-ridden because of his privilege.
Neither effects change because the
first denies the value and capacity of
minorities to effect change and the
second prevents him from channeling
his privilege productively; he just feels
sorry for himself.
But in reality, the white, Protestant,
hetereosexual man has other alterna

tives. He can belong to the movement
by needing the freedom of the op
pressed as his own. He can take ad
vantage of his privilege to educate
others, lobby for anti-discrimination
legislation and provide solidarity.
Shaeffer's stereotypical and two
dimensional portrayal of human
beings, both minority and non
minority, promotes farther misun
derstanding in a society that is already
steeped in prejudice, guilt and hope
lessness.

Band suspension
is bizarre logic
I must confess to be somewhat at a
loss in understanding the bizarre form
of logic being practiced at the Stan
ford Athletic Department. Athletic
Director Andy Geiger deems it neces
sary to severely punish the entire
band for forming a symbolic phallus
— not a crime — and for urinating in
public — a misdemeanor. This seems
bizarre to me as he did not suspend
the football team for two games when
team members were caught forging
checks — a felony.
Perhaps he felt that because the
incident involving the football players
took place in the off season, it didn't
really count. Nevertheless, now that
he has set a new precedent in English
Common Law, i.e. punishing the
whole for the actions of a part, I
would expect that he will now go on
the record as supporting two game
suspensions for the football team in
the event of future crimes. I would
understand if he drew the line at
acquaintance rape — because boys
will be boys — but would hope that
he could find it within himself to
make a courageous stand against
felony murder. Manslaughter would
be all right.
Actually, I don't expect Mr. Geiger
to do anything of the kind — anything
courageous that is. The band's actual
crime was not being what Mr. Geiger

considers to be a real marching band
— a band that will march up and
down the field like good little fascists
in Buffalo Lodge helmets. If Mr.
Geiger would like a real marching
band, I would invite him to move to a
real football school. The kind of
school where they fire the athletic
director for continuously producing
losing football teams.

Frosb writing
program obstructs
liberal education
A recent editorial (Daily, Nov. 3)
claims that the freshman writing
program is "too good a deal to let
freshmen pass it up." Really?
Western Culture already dictates
one-third of a freshman's course load.
Anyone who is considering a scientific
major needs to be taking calculus as
well — that makes 10 units a quarter.
Add in three units of English, and a
freshman has time to try one other
class. Is that a varied, liberal educa
tion?
Clearly freshman writing courses
are a valuable resource to have at
Stanford. However, many incoming
freshmen have done a considerable
amount of college-level writing in
high school and are ready to put their
skills to practical use. These students
have a more than sufficient command
of the English language, and they have
the AP, SAT and Achievement scores
to prove it. It is clear that they will
"leave Stanford confident in their
ability to communicate in writing."
Why not, then, give freshmen that
extra time to benefit from the liberal
education Stanford offers?
