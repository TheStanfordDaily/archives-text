# From stereotypes to friendship

I prepare to leave Dan's room. "All right, I'll see you to
morrow."
"Right. Thanks a lot for your help."
"Sure." Dan is in a wheelchair, and we have just hung out.
He and I have been friends for three years, during which
time we and our friendship have both changed. My attitude
toward him has evolved from misperception to an element
of condescension to a true understanding of who he is. He
has gradually emerged from a relatively closed orientation
toward the world to a more relaxed view of himself and his
surroundings. We have helped each other. I close my eyes
and let the memories begin.

We met as freshmen in Rinconada. I had never been close
with anyone in a wheelchair, was intimidated by him and
thus misperceived who he was. The skiing accident that
robbed him of total mobility had happened only a year and
a half before we entered Stanford, and his inner pain
seemed very active. His room seemed like an opium den to
me: Tapestries billowed, it was always dark, strange music
always played. The other guys on our hall and I were never
quite sure what he was thinking — his nickname was "Mind
Games."
It was not until later that I realized that our nickname ex
pressed our discomfort with Dan's situation as mud) if not
more than it reflected how he behaved. At one point during
the year someone stole wheelchairs from the airport, and
people held wheelchair races on the first floor of Rinc. I
asked Dan how he felt about the races. "That's fine for
them," he replied. "They can stand up at any point and leave
the chair. I can't." The contrast between Dan's constant
struggle to get around and what was entertainment and tem
porary fun for the racers helped me to understand how un
believably painful parts of Dan's life were and to overcome
my own barriers. We started to become friends, and I was
happy when I found out that we had drawn into the same
dorm for the next year.
Sophomore year we found ourselves in Sterling Quad. I
again became acquainted with how many details Dan must
deal with every day. While Stanford is remarkably wheel
chair accessible, "accessible" is a tricky word. There are
many details that Dan must confront daily, details with
which Stanford cannot help him. For example, when going
to class, he must constantly navigate which part of the street
is better for him and he mast deal with any bumps in the
sidewalk. More basically, he has to labor to open the door to
his room, to turn on a light and to eat. I point this out not to
disparage Stanford's facilities but to attempt to show the tre
mendous obstacles that Dan must tackle every day of his life.
We shared many experiences. Dan introduced me to the
Grateful Dead, and we went to several shows together. We
always ate dinner together and would sit in his room for
hours, talking and laughing. Dan has a marvelous sense of
humor. He manages to wed his remarkable eye for detail,
his facial expressions, and his body movements with his
profound life sense. These things combine to form an ir
reverent sense of humor that always leaves me with a tired
smile from laughing so much.
We confided in each other, and from his suffering I
learned about things I hadn't experienced (like his accident
and convalescence) and about things that I had (like girls

and friends and school). He lifted weights, grew stronger
and generally seemed more comfortable with being in the
chair. When I found out how much money he had to spend
on self-care, 1 offered to help him with it in an effort to save
him money. Although we were good friends, my offer
sprung more out of self-oriented (I took pride in the favor I
was doing him), intellectual (helping Dan fit in with my con
ception of how I "should" act), and pragmatic (it would save
him money) reasons than it did from reasons of friendship.
I found that part of why I hung out with Dan was to receive a
renewed appreciation of my own physical abilities. These
motivations, while not bad in and of themselves, demon
strated that I was bringing many of my own issues to our in
teraction. In a sense, then, I had progressed beyond our re
lationship freshman year when I was intimidated by him
and misperceived him, and in a sense I hadn't.
Junior year came and 1 continued to help Dan. He contin
ued to lift, wheeled himself all over campus and lived in a
huge room in Storey House, which was a much better loca
tion for him than either Rinc or Adams. We became best
friends and I found myself forgetting that he was in a wheel
chair. My attitude toward Dan shifted; many of the selfish
aspects on my part ceased to operate and were subsumed
by a greater friendship. Helping him was not something that
I did for him, it was something we did together and some
thing to which I looked forward the whole day. If I forgot to
put a telephone next to him when he went to sleep, it was a
collective failure. One day he called me up at 7:50 in the
morning, said that his tire had a flat, that he had a midterm
in 40 minutes and that he needed help. I sped down to
Storey and we worked as a team. He barked out instructions
while I desperately attempted to patch the tire (I am
relatively incompetent in technical matters). We focused all
our energies into getting him to his exam on time. He
arrived at 8:28 and did well on the test. My pleasure in this
stemmed from the fact that our collective effort had helped
him to do well and had let him feel like he had resources to
draw on, not because it saved him money or because it was
something I "should do."
In February my parents were involved in a nearly fatal car
accident. I stopped out from school in the spring to be with
my family. Dan was a great source of support to me during
this tremendously traumatic period in my life. He called me
regularly and asked how things were going. I let him help
me with my pain and he listened to me with a true knowl
edge of a devastating accident and its accompanying emo
tions. Through my own tragic experience I gained a fuller
understanding of his life. By accepting his help during this
period, I understood what tremendous reserves of care and
support he has. I realized how shallow my previous under
standing of him had been, for to look at Dan and to only
come out with an appreciation of one's physical ability is to
totally miss his essence. He teaches and lives much more
profound and important lessons of strength and courage
and struggle each day of his life. Thus our friendship took
on a new dimension, one of shared sorrow and mutual
help.
Dan spent this summer on his own in New York City and
handled all his details beautifully in one of the world's least
accessible cities for anyone. He came through the summer
with a new self-confidence and a new acceptance of his sit
uation. This year he goes anywhere he wants to, sticks up for
himself and does what he wants. We both understand and
deal with each other/or who we are. I no longer forget that
he is in a wheelchair. He helps me appreciate my own good
fortune, reminds me that we are both people, not two differ
ent types, and I help him, too.
I open my eyes, close his door and head for home.

was doing him), intellectual (helping Dan fit in with my con
ception of how I "should" act), and pragmatic (it would save
him money) reasons than it did from reasons of friendship.
I found that part of why I hung out with Dan was to receive a
renewed appreciation of my own physical abilities. These
motivations, while not bad in and of themselves, demon
strated that I was bringing many of my own issues to our in
teraction. In a sense, then, I had progressed beyond our re
lationship freshman year when I was intimidated by him
and misperceived him, and in a sense I hadn't.
Junior year came and 1 continued to help Dan. He contin
ued to lift, wheeled himself all over campus and lived in a
huge room in Storey House, which was a much better loca
tion for him than either Rinc or Adams. We became best
friends and I found myself forgetting that he was in a wheel
chair. My attitude toward Dan shifted; many of the selfish
aspects on my part ceased to operate and were subsumed
by a greater friendship. Helping him was not something that
I did for him, it was something we did together and some
thing to which I looked forward the whole day. If I forgot to
put a telephone next to him when he went to sleep, it was a
collective failure. One day he called me up at 7:50 in the
morning, said that his tire had a flat, that he had a midterm
in 40 minutes and that he needed help. I sped down to
Storey and we worked as a team. He barked out instructions
while I desperately attempted to patch the tire (I am
relatively incompetent in technical matters). We focused all
our energies into getting him to his exam on time. He
arrived at 8:28 and did well on the test. My pleasure in this
stemmed from the fact that our collective effort had helped
him to do well and had let him feel like he had resources to
draw on, not because it saved him money or because it was
something I "should do."
In February my parents were involved in a nearly fatal car
accident. I stopped out from school in the spring to be with
my family. Dan was a great source of support to me during
this tremendously traumatic period in my life. He called me
regularly and asked how things were going. I let him help
me with my pain and he listened to me with a true knowl
edge of a devastating accident and its accompanying emo
tions. Through my own tragic experience I gained a fuller
understanding of his life. By accepting his help during this
period, I understood what tremendous reserves of care and
support he has. I realized how shallow my previous under
standing of him had been, for to look at Dan and to only
come out with an appreciation of one's physical ability is to
totally miss his essence. He teaches and lives much more
profound and important lessons of strength and courage
and struggle each day of his life. Thus our friendship took
on a new dimension, one of shared sorrow and mutual
help.
Dan spent this summer on his own in New York City and
handled all his details beautifully in one of the world's least
accessible cities for anyone. He came through the summer
with a new self-confidence and a new acceptance of his sit
uation. This year he goes anywhere he wants to, sticks up for
himself and does what he wants. We both understand and
deal with each other/or who we are. I no longer forget that
he is in a wheelchair. He helps me appreciate my own good
fortune, reminds me that we are both people, not two differ
ent types, and I help him, too.
I open my eyes, close his door and head for home.

I prepare to leave Dan's room. "All right, I'll see you to
morrow."
"Right. Thanks a lot for your help."
"Sure." Dan is in a wheelchair, and we have just hung out.
He and I have been friends for three years, during which
time we and our friendship have both changed. My attitude
toward him has evolved from misperception to an element
of condescension to a true understanding of who he is. He
has gradually emerged from a relatively closed orientation
toward the world to a more relaxed view of himself and his
surroundings. We have helped each other. I close my eyes
and let the memories begin.

We met as freshmen in Rinconada. I had never been close
with anyone in a wheelchair, was intimidated by him and
thus misperceived who he was. The skiing accident that
robbed him of total mobility had happened only a year and
a half before we entered Stanford, and his inner pain
seemed very active. His room seemed like an opium den to
me: Tapestries billowed, it was always dark, strange music
always played. The other guys on our hall and I were never
quite sure what he was thinking — his nickname was "Mind
Games."
It was not until later that I realized that our nickname ex
pressed our discomfort with Dan's situation as mud) if not
more than it reflected how he behaved. At one point during
the year someone stole wheelchairs from the airport, and
people held wheelchair races on the first floor of Rinc. I
asked Dan how he felt about the races. "That's fine for
them," he replied. "They can stand up at any point and leave
the chair. I can't." The contrast between Dan's constant
struggle to get around and what was entertainment and tem
porary fun for the racers helped me to understand how un
believably painful parts of Dan's life were and to overcome
my own barriers. We started to become friends, and I was
happy when I found out that we had drawn into the same
dorm for the next year.
Sophomore year we found ourselves in Sterling Quad. I
again became acquainted with how many details Dan must
deal with every day. While Stanford is remarkably wheel
chair accessible, "accessible" is a tricky word. There are
many details that Dan must confront daily, details with
which Stanford cannot help him. For example, when going
to class, he must constantly navigate which part of the street
is better for him and he mast deal with any bumps in the
sidewalk. More basically, he has to labor to open the door to
his room, to turn on a light and to eat. I point this out not to
disparage Stanford's facilities but to attempt to show the tre
mendous obstacles that Dan must tackle every day of his life.
We shared many experiences. Dan introduced me to the
Grateful Dead, and we went to several shows together. We
always ate dinner together and would sit in his room for
hours, talking and laughing. Dan has a marvelous sense of
humor. He manages to wed his remarkable eye for detail,
his facial expressions, and his body movements with his
profound life sense. These things combine to form an ir
reverent sense of humor that always leaves me with a tired
smile from laughing so much.
We confided in each other, and from his suffering I
learned about things I hadn't experienced (like his accident
and convalescence) and about things that I had (like girls

and friends and school). He lifted weights, grew stronger
and generally seemed more comfortable with being in the
chair. When I found out how much money he had to spend
on self-care, 1 offered to help him with it in an effort to save
him money. Although we were good friends, my offer
sprung more out of self-oriented (I took pride in the favor I
was doing him), intellectual (helping Dan fit in with my con
