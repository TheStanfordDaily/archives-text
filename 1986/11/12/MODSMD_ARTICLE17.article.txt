# Unilateral disarmament immoral

Hugh Gusterson is certainly correct when he notes
(Daily, Nov. 4) that it is incorrect to infer the demise
of the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
(CND) from the lack of street protests in London. He
is also correct when he reports that the Labor Party's
security policy reflects CND's goal of the last 30 years
to persuade Britain to pursue the folly of unilateral

nuclear disarmament.
But Mr. Gusterson's analysis of why Britain should
engage in unilateral nuclear disarmament is wrong,
and the "moral" that Americans are supposed to
learn should be thoroughly rejected as immoral.
First, Mr. Gusterson believes that the major threat
to Britain is the existence of British and American nu
clear weapons on British soil. Get rid of all such nu
clear weapons, he suggests, and presto, Britain is no
longer threatened.
Britain and Western Europe are threatened by So
viet nuclear weapons not because the West possesses
nuclear weapons, but because the West is demo
cratic. The Soviets conceptualize the East-West
struggle as the class of diametrically opposed social
systems. The greatest threat to the Soviet Union's im
perial ambitions in Europe is the existence of sover
eign, democratic-capitalist states that are an alterna
tive political-economic model to Bolshevik
totalitarianism.
Furthermore, if not having nuclear weapons
makes a country significantly less threatening to the
Russians, how does Mr. Gusterson explain repeated
Soviet violations of Sweden's air- and sea-space?
Sweden is a neutral country without nuclear weap
ons. Yet the Russians continually pressure Sweden to

end its defense of historical territorial rights and to
accommodate Soviet interests. Curiously, Norway,
which is a member of NATO, is not subjected to as
many blatant violations.
Second, Mr. Gusterson and other advocates of uni
lateral nuclear disarmament believe that if the West
were to pursue such a policy this "would encourage
otner nations to reuucc 01 cumulate uieu uuuear
weapons." If the West were to disarm unilaterally, ac
cording to Mr. Gusterson, the Russians would be so
shamed by this altruistic gesture that they too would
disarm. Such a policy is wrong and the consequences
of such a policy are immoral.
NATO has not attempted to maintain conventional
force parity with the Russians since 1952, yet the Rus
sians continue to produce tanks, armored vehicles,
artillery tubes and aircraft in great quantities in order
to achieve overwhelming conventional superiority.
Moreover, the talks to reduce the level of conven
tional forces in Europe have been stalled by Soviet
claims of existing parity for nearly 15 years. In 1975,
NATO proposed to the Russians a ban on deploy
ment of intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The
Russians rejected the offer and in 1977 began to
deploy the SS-20s. NATO was forced to announce in
December 1979 its intention to deploy a mixture of
572 Pershing 2 and Ground Launch Cruise missiles,
which they began to deploy in late 1983 The Soviets
walked out of the negotiations, but later returned.
More importantly, the Soviets have dropped their
demand that British and French nuclear forces be in
cluded in the European balance and endorsed in
principle President Reagan's zero-zero option, a pro
posal CND denounced as not serious and an insult to
the Russians. CND was wrong then and now.
And lastly, in 1977 President Carter proposed to
the Russians deep reductioas in botn countries nu
clear arsenals. The Russians rejected the offer. After

the Reagan defense buildup that saw the deployment
of B-l bombers, MX missiles, Trident submarines,
discussioas of a new midgetman missile and an in
tensified effort to achieve a strategic defense with the
SDI program, the Soviets are now seriously discuss
ing nuclear arms reductions.
It is clear that President Reagan's approach of
realism, strength and dialogue is working. The
Reagan administration has certainly demonstrated
that one can engage the Russians in negotiations re
garding human rights, regional conflicts and nuclear
arms reductioas without prostrating before the Rus
sians and yielding our freedom.
Unilateral nuclear disarmament and appeasement
are immoral precisely because both undermine the
preservation of freedom. Both are wrong because
they cannot induce the Soviets to engage in meaning
ful nuclear arms reductioas.
The real moral for Americans to learn is that peace
through strength is both a moral and pragmatic
policy. Strength allows us to preserve our freedom
and to negotiate matters of mutual interests with the
Russians. If, on the other hand, we take counsel from
those who have no desire to defend freedom against
totalitarianism and who believe that appeasement is
the most moral policy we can hope to pursue, then
we risk losing our freedom, democracy, inalienable
rights and way of life. That would be immoral.
Should the British public choose unilateral nu
clear disarmament, appeasement and, ultimately, sur
render, as Mr. Gusterson advocates, it would mark
the end of a long decline of a once proud and ener
getic people. Mr. Gusterson's argument is, indeed,
built upon a foundation of sand.

Sweden is a neutral country without nuclear weap
ons. Yet the Russians continually pressure Sweden to

end its defense of historical territorial rights and to
accommodate Soviet interests. Curiously, Norway,
which is a member of NATO, is not subjected to as
many blatant violations.
Second, Mr. Gusterson and other advocates of uni
lateral nuclear disarmament believe that if the West
were to pursue such a policy this "would encourage
otner nations to reuucc 01 cumulate uieu uuuear
weapons." If the West were to disarm unilaterally, ac
cording to Mr. Gusterson, the Russians would be so
shamed by this altruistic gesture that they too would
disarm. Such a policy is wrong and the consequences
of such a policy are immoral.
NATO has not attempted to maintain conventional
force parity with the Russians since 1952, yet the Rus
sians continue to produce tanks, armored vehicles,
artillery tubes and aircraft in great quantities in order
to achieve overwhelming conventional superiority.
Moreover, the talks to reduce the level of conven
tional forces in Europe have been stalled by Soviet
claims of existing parity for nearly 15 years. In 1975,
NATO proposed to the Russians a ban on deploy
ment of intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The
Russians rejected the offer and in 1977 began to
deploy the SS-20s. NATO was forced to announce in
December 1979 its intention to deploy a mixture of
572 Pershing 2 and Ground Launch Cruise missiles,
which they began to deploy in late 1983 The Soviets
walked out of the negotiations, but later returned.
More importantly, the Soviets have dropped their
demand that British and French nuclear forces be in
cluded in the European balance and endorsed in
principle President Reagan's zero-zero option, a pro
posal CND denounced as not serious and an insult to
the Russians. CND was wrong then and now.
And lastly, in 1977 President Carter proposed to
the Russians deep reductioas in botn countries nu
clear arsenals. The Russians rejected the offer. After

the Reagan defense buildup that saw the deployment
of B-l bombers, MX missiles, Trident submarines,
discussioas of a new midgetman missile and an in
tensified effort to achieve a strategic defense with the
SDI program, the Soviets are now seriously discuss
ing nuclear arms reductions.
It is clear that President Reagan's approach of
realism, strength and dialogue is working. The
Reagan administration has certainly demonstrated
that one can engage the Russians in negotiations re
garding human rights, regional conflicts and nuclear
arms reductioas without prostrating before the Rus
sians and yielding our freedom.
Unilateral nuclear disarmament and appeasement
are immoral precisely because both undermine the
preservation of freedom. Both are wrong because
they cannot induce the Soviets to engage in meaning
ful nuclear arms reductioas.
The real moral for Americans to learn is that peace
through strength is both a moral and pragmatic
policy. Strength allows us to preserve our freedom
and to negotiate matters of mutual interests with the
Russians. If, on the other hand, we take counsel from
those who have no desire to defend freedom against
totalitarianism and who believe that appeasement is
the most moral policy we can hope to pursue, then
we risk losing our freedom, democracy, inalienable
rights and way of life. That would be immoral.
Should the British public choose unilateral nu
clear disarmament, appeasement and, ultimately, sur
render, as Mr. Gusterson advocates, it would mark
the end of a long decline of a once proud and ener
getic people. Mr. Gusterson's argument is, indeed,
built upon a foundation of sand.

Hugh Gusterson is certainly correct when he notes
(Daily, Nov. 4) that it is incorrect to infer the demise
of the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
(CND) from the lack of street protests in London. He
is also correct when he reports that the Labor Party's
security policy reflects CND's goal of the last 30 years
to persuade Britain to pursue the folly of unilateral

nuclear disarmament.
But Mr. Gusterson's analysis of why Britain should
engage in unilateral nuclear disarmament is wrong,
and the "moral" that Americans are supposed to
learn should be thoroughly rejected as immoral.
First, Mr. Gusterson believes that the major threat
to Britain is the existence of British and American nu
clear weapons on British soil. Get rid of all such nu
clear weapons, he suggests, and presto, Britain is no
longer threatened.
Britain and Western Europe are threatened by So
viet nuclear weapons not because the West possesses
nuclear weapons, but because the West is demo
cratic. The Soviets conceptualize the East-West
struggle as the class of diametrically opposed social
systems. The greatest threat to the Soviet Union's im
perial ambitions in Europe is the existence of sover
eign, democratic-capitalist states that are an alterna
tive political-economic model to Bolshevik
totalitarianism.
Furthermore, if not having nuclear weapons
makes a country significantly less threatening to the
Russians, how does Mr. Gusterson explain repeated
Soviet violations of Sweden's air- and sea-space?
Sweden is a neutral country without nuclear weap
ons. Yet the Russians continually pressure Sweden to
