# Admit process reviewed

### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
In the most extensive review of the
University's undergraduate admissions
policy in recent years, a faculty com
mittee released an official statement
reaffirming Stanford's subjective and
judgmental admissions process and
addressing the issue of minority admis
sions.
According to a report by the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aids (CUAFA), "The pri
mary criterion for admission is aca
demic excellence." Applicants for ad
mission should also exhibit personal
achievement outside the classroom
and character traits consistent with the
principles of the Fundamental Stan
dard, the report said.
It noted that blacks, Mexican-
Americans, and Native Americans
receive "special consideration" if they
meet basic requirements of academic
excellence. Children of Stanford
graduates and children of eligible Stan
ford faculty and staff receive prefer
ence in choices among applicants of
approximately equal qualifications, the
report added.
CUAFA also addressed the possibility
of discrimination toward Asian-
American applicants.
The impetus for the committee's in
vestigation Into Asian-American admis
sions came from Asian-American
groups who wrote and consulted with
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter over
concerns of possible discrimination,
said committee member Robert Eustis,
associate dean of the School of Engi
neering.
From 1982 to 1985, the admission
rate for Asian-Americans at Stanford
ranged from 66 to 70 percent of the ad
mission rate for white applicants.
In 1986, the Asian-American admis
sion rate at Stanford rose to 89 percent
of the white admission rate. Sixteen
percent of this year's freshman class is
Asian-American.
A special CUAFA subcommittee
headed by Psychology Prof. Jeffrey
Wine could find no factor to com
pletely explain the difference in the ad
mission rate, CUAFA reported.
The subcommittee found that the
difference did not arise from an im
plicit quota, from lesser
academic/non-academic ratings for
Asian-Americans, from the influence of
other factors such as gender or geogra
phic origin, from differences in choice
of major or from differences due to
special groups like alumni legacies,
faculty staff children and athletes, ex
