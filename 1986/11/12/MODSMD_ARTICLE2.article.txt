# Admit process reviewed
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
In the most extensive review of the
University's undergraduate admissions
policy in recent years, a faculty com
mittee released an official statement
reaffirming Stanford's subjective and
judgmental admissions process and
addressing the issue of minority admis
sions.
According to a report by the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aids (CUAFA), "The pri
mary criterion for admission is aca
demic excellence." Applicants for ad
mission should also exhibit personal
achievement outside the classroom
and character traits consistent with the
principles of the Fundamental Stan
dard, the report said.
It noted that blacks, Mexican-
Americans, and Native Americans
receive "special consideration" if they
meet basic requirements of academic
excellence. Children of Stanford
graduates and children of eligible Stan
ford faculty and staff receive prefer
ence in choices among applicants of
approximately equal qualifications, the
report added.
CUAFA also addressed the possibility
of discrimination toward Asian-
American applicants.
The impetus for the committee's in
vestigation Into Asian-American admis
sions came from Asian-American
groups who wrote and consulted with
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter over
concerns of possible discrimination,
said committee member Robert Eustis,
associate dean of the School of Engi
neering.
From 1982 to 1985, the admission
rate for Asian-Americans at Stanford
ranged from 66 to 70 percent of the ad
mission rate for white applicants.
In 1986, the Asian-American admis
sion rate at Stanford rose to 89 percent
of the white admission rate. Sixteen
percent of this year's freshman class is
Asian-American.
A special CUAFA subcommittee
headed by Psychology Prof. Jeffrey
Wine could find no factor to com
pletely explain the difference in the ad
mission rate, CUAFA reported.
The subcommittee found that the
difference did not arise from an im
plicit quota, from lesser
academic/non-academic ratings for
Asian-Americans, from the influence of
other factors such as gender or geogra
phic origin, from differences in choice
of major or from differences due to
special groups like alumni legacies,
faculty staff children and athletes, ex
cept in a relatively minor way.
"The remaining alternatives, which
do not yield easily to numerical analy
sis, are that real differences may exist
among Asian-Americans and whites in
the subjective data on which admis
sions decisions are based and/or that
unconscious biases have influenced
admissions decisions," CUAFA stated.
CUAFA reccomended that the Uni
versity "communicate to high school
teachers and college guidance coun
selors Stanford's concern about the
possibility in letters of reccomendation
of stereotyping regarding ethnicity and
gender."

The committee also reccomended
that training for new admissions offi
cers include addressing "the possibil
ity of unconscious stereotyping of indi
vidual applicant groups, including
Asian-Americans."
Fetter asked CUAFA in 1985 to
review admissions policy because
"Stanford had changed considerably
during the years since 1978-79, when
the criteria for admission were last
considered, and ... the existing state
ment left some points largely un
touched."
She specifically asked the committee
to address the question of "character,"
which many other private universities
have addressed, CUAFA reported.
The committee's statement, formu
lated over several meetings last year,
looked back to the original founding

grant and to the Fundamental Standard
as guidelines for what qualities the
University seeks in its applicants.
CUAFA stated that Stanford students
are expected to uphold the principles
of the Fundamental Standard.
"I'm very pleased with it. It's an
honest statement of our policy. People
will know what Stanford really means,"
said Eustis, also a professor of mechan
ical engineering. "We tried to take the
mystery out of the (admissions)
process."
The policy criteria will be presented
tomorrow to the Faculty Senate, which
is expected to approve the statement,
said Bob Beyers, director of the Uni
versity News Service.

considered, and ... the existing state
ment left some points largely un
touched."
She specifically asked the committee
to address the question of "character,"
which many other private universities
have addressed, CUAFA reported.
The committee's statement, formu
lated over several meetings last year,
looked back to the original founding

grant and to the Fundamental Standard
as guidelines for what qualities the
University seeks in its applicants.
CUAFA stated that Stanford students
are expected to uphold the principles
of the Fundamental Standard.
"I'm very pleased with it. It's an
honest statement of our policy. People
will know what Stanford really means,"
said Eustis, also a professor of mechan
ical engineering. "We tried to take the
mystery out of the (admissions)
process."
The policy criteria will be presented
tomorrow to the Faculty Senate, which
is expected to approve the statement,
said Bob Beyers, director of the Uni
versity News Service.
The senate has the final word on ad
missions policy.
