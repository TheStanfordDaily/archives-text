## Student-run Espresso Bar does java jive at 1-Center 
### VIVIAN FU 
It has live music. It has home-baked
goods. It has an international clientele.
And all in a wonderfully informal at
mosphere.
No, it's not Shangri-La. It's the
Espresso Bar, and it's right here on
campus, just a hop, skip and a jump
from your dorm or favorite library.
Located in the Bechtel International
Center and open every Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday from 8 p.m. to 1
a.m., the Espresso Bar offers a variety
of fresh breads, cookies and brownies,
as well as coffee, espresso and a splen
did selection of teas. In addition, a
specialty food item from a different
country is featured each week.
The Espresso Bar was inaugurated
last year in the wake of Saga Corp.'s
takeover of the previously student-run
Coffee House in Tresidder Union. Its
two founders, however, decided not to
continue the bar this year because of
the large amount of work involved,
and management has now fallen to five
dedicated undergraduates: sopho
mores Mousumi Roy and Virginie Per
rette; and juniors Michelle Oshima,
Debbie Gilman and Ingrid Seyer.
"We really want the Espresso Bar to
be student-oriented," said Oshima.
"Our goal is not to compete with the
Coffee House, but to offer an alterna

tive for students."
The Espresso Bar is a non-profit op
eration run and serviced entirely by
Stanford students. Because it seeks
only to cover costs, prices tend to be
lower there than at competitive institu
tions.

"Everyone donates their services —
the bands, the bakers, the people who
work every night," Roy explained. "We
need a lot more help, so if anyone's in
terested, they should just drop by."
Live music is provided Wednesday
and Friday nights.
"We want to provide a place where
amateur musicians can perform, and

also where students groups can have
an audience of their peers," Gilman
said. "We're open to any suggestions
— we're here for the students. Any
thing they want to have happen, be it a
computer music display, a poetry
reading, anything — we want to hear
about it."
Thursday night is a quiet night, for
those who prefer not to have music.
Penette encourages student groups to
conduct informal meetings then.
"It's a great place to sit down and
have discussions," she said.
An informal discussion known as
Global Education takes place Thursday
nights at 10 p.m. for students inter
ested in discussing politics and current
events. Faculty members and teaching
assistants are invited to participate as
well.
Judging from the grand opening last
weekend, most customers seemed to
be responding favorably to the
Espresso Bar. There were a few dis
senters, though.
"The espresso was bad, the music
was too loud and the lights were too
bright," complained freshman Enrique
Anchondo.
But whatever a student's tastes may
be, the Espresso Bar is definitely worth
checking out. If the unique atmos
phere doesn't tempt one, the sweets
probably will.
