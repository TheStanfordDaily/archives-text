Thanks to the many of you who have sent me ques
tions ma electronic mail. I am working on your ques
tions and encourage those of you who hat>e not yet sent
me a question to do so. My electronic mail address is
BUG-MEffIOTHELLO. For those of you who prefer to take
pen to paper, you still can. All lines of communication
are now open. Operators are standing by. Write now.
Dear Bug Me,
I've noticed that many discount coupons say good for
25 cents off my next purchase of a breakfast cereal, and
hai>e fine print on them that says, "cash value 1/20 of
one cent." What gives? If I collect 20 of these and mail
them off to the manufacturer, will he send me a penny?
Will Mr. Wilson at the corner grocery give me a piece of
Bazooka gum if I give him 40 of these?
â€” Penny Pincher
Theoretically, the manufacturer will send you a penny
if you send in 20 "cents off' coupons with a cash value of
1/20 of one cent.
But don't quit your day job just yet.
The people at Proctor & Gamble tell me that the fine
print is required by law and that it is much more worth
the consumer's while to redeem the coupon at its face
value.
While manufacturer's coupons are not regulated by

federal law, they are regulated by state law which, in
most states including California, define trading stamps
and manufacturer's coupons in the same way. Therefore,
coupons must have an intrinsic cash value just as trading
stamps do.
Variation in the law exists from state to state, which is
why some coupons and some offers are unavailable in
some states.
