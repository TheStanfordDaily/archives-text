# Bug makes cents out of vexatious coupons
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Thanks to the many of you who have sent me ques
tions ma electronic mail. I am working on your ques
tions and encourage those of you who hat>e not yet sent
me a question to do so. My electronic mail address is
BUG-MEffIOTHELLO. For those of you who prefer to take
pen to paper, you still can. All lines of communication
are now open. Operators are standing by. Write now.
Dear Bug Me,
I've noticed that many discount coupons say good for
25 cents off my next purchase of a breakfast cereal, and
hai>e fine print on them that says, "cash value 1/20 of
one cent." What gives? If I collect 20 of these and mail
them off to the manufacturer, will he send me a penny?
Will Mr. Wilson at the corner grocery give me a piece of
Bazooka gum if I give him 40 of these?
— Penny Pincher
Theoretically, the manufacturer will send you a penny
if you send in 20 "cents off' coupons with a cash value of
1/20 of one cent.
But don't quit your day job just yet.
The people at Proctor & Gamble tell me that the fine
print is required by law and that it is much more worth
the consumer's while to redeem the coupon at its face
value.
While manufacturer's coupons are not regulated by

federal law, they are regulated by state law which, in
most states including California, define trading stamps
and manufacturer's coupons in the same way. Therefore,
coupons must have an intrinsic cash value just as trading
stamps do.
Variation in the law exists from state to state, which is
why some coupons and some offers are unavailable in
some states.


BUG
ME
I'm not sure if the Founding Fathers,
when they gave the states some
legislative autonomy, considered that
some Americans would be unable to
get a secret spy camera from Bazooka
comics.
As for the store owner who must
redeem manufacturer's coupons or
lose his business, Joe Garcia of theJJ&F
Food Store of Falo Alto says that they
are "a losing deal."
There are myriad different manufac
turers to whom coupons must be
returned in order for them to be
redeemed. This is an extremely time
consuming task that few stores un
dertake. Instead of sorting the coupons
themselves, most stores send all their
coupons en masse to a clearinghouse
that promptly remits the store the face
value of the coupons. The clearing
house can do this because it gets to
keep the handling fee that manufac
turers pay for each coupon sent back
to them. This can be up to eight cents
per coupon.
One store owner I spoke with con
jectured that the clearinghouses send

the coupons to Guatemala, where low
wage laborers do the sorting. I tend to
doubt this.
Dear Bug Me,
Why do University offices close from
noon to 1 o'clock? I cannot usually
visit these offices at other times during
the day
— Busybody
Most residence offices are open for
only four hours a day and these gener
ally include lunchtime. The most
notable exceptioas to this are Flo Mo
and Lagunita.
Someone is around at lunch to an
swer the phone at Res Ed, the Row Of
fice and the President's Office. The
ASSU is also open, as is the Undergrad
uate Admissions Office (which,
granted, is of little use once one gets to
the Farm). Also, as a service to the staff,
the Benefits and Personnel depart
ments in Old Pavilion are open.
Special mention for making them
selves more accessible to students
must go to the CPPC, the Undergradu
ate Advising Center and Overseas
Studies, which remain open at lunch,
albeit with limited staff. Overseas
Studies has made it its policy for a

number of years to be open during
lunch. Scheduling has ranged from re
quiring all staff to have lunch duty
twice a week (just like your high
school teachers) to allowing staff to
work through lunch and leave early.
Presently, the noontime staff of
Overseas Studies consists of a woman
who uses her lunch hour from 1-2 p.m.
to take a class.
But why does the Registrar's Office,
probably the University office that gets
the most student traffic, continue to
slam the information window down at
the stroke of 12?
Registrar Sally Mahoney explains
that "given the size of the staff, we feel
we can provide better service being
open the hours we are open."
The Registrar's Office in Old Union
has many departments, not just the in
formation window. In order to keep
each department open with the limited
staff they have, Mahoney said that they
would need to predict the demand for
each office and responsibilities would
have to be staggered, which would
make them more difficult.
Mahoney said that the information
window could be kept open, but that
most inquirers would need to be
referred to another office in Old Un
ion, and those other offices would

most likely be closed.
Personally, 1 think the registrar
should at least have a telephone
manned (or womanned) and an infor
mation window open at noontime.
Nothing at the University prohibits
offices from being open at lunchtime;
scheduling is done by each office ac
cording to its staff, needs and traffic
patterns. 1 suggest that if you think a
particular office should be open, you
ought to let them know.
Dear Bug Me,
Why are the parking service people
so nosy? Why do they ask for social se
curity numbers? Why do they insist that
people with P.O. boxes also give their
street addresses? If all they want to
know is whether you live on campus or
not, they could just ask "Do you live
on campus?" Why are students and
staff parking permits different?
— Bureaucracy Hater
While the form for student and staff
parking permits asks for the social se
curity number of the applicant, it is
only required of staff members.
Ramona Kelley, manager of adminis
trative services for the Stanford Police,
said that Stanford student identification
numbers are required of student per-

Mit applicants as a means of identifica
tion, particularly for students with the
same or similar names. Permits are
given to students even if they don't
provide their social security number.
For staff members, who do not have
student ID numbers, the social security
number serves that purpose. It is also
needed for those staff members who
wish to have the price of the permit
deducted from their paycheck.
Street addresses are required, Kelley
said, because "you don't live in a box."
If your car had been stolen, its lights
were on or it was in front of a
dumpster, the police might try to con
tact you at home. They can't do that
with just your P.O. box number.
As for why staff and student permits
differ, Kelley has questioned this her
self. The best explanation is demograp
hics. The number of each type of per
mit sold can be recorded, along with
parking trends. If a number of cars
with student permits from one dor
mitory start parking in the lot of an
other, it is a tip-off to the police that
there may be inadequate parking at a
particular dorm.
It also makes it oh-so-easy for the
police to pick your car out as being
parked in the wrong lot for your per
mit.

Dear Bug Me,
Why do University offices close from
noon to 1 o'clock? I cannot usually
visit these offices at other times during
the day
— Busybody
Most residence offices are open for
only four hours a day and these gener
ally include lunchtime. The most
notable exceptioas to this are Flo Mo
and Lagunita.
Someone is around at lunch to an
swer the phone at Res Ed, the Row Of
fice and the President's Office. The
ASSU is also open, as is the Undergrad
uate Admissions Office (which,
granted, is of little use once one gets to
the Farm). Also, as a service to the staff,
the Benefits and Personnel depart
ments in Old Pavilion are open.
Special mention for making them
selves more accessible to students
must go to the CPPC, the Undergradu
ate Advising Center and Overseas
Studies, which remain open at lunch,
albeit with limited staff. Overseas
Studies has made it its policy for a

number of years to be open during
lunch. Scheduling has ranged from re
quiring all staff to have lunch duty
twice a week (just like your high
school teachers) to allowing staff to
work through lunch and leave early.
Presently, the noontime staff of
Overseas Studies consists of a woman
who uses her lunch hour from 1-2 p.m.
to take a class.
But why does the Registrar's Office,
probably the University office that gets
the most student traffic, continue to
slam the information window down at
the stroke of 12?
Registrar Sally Mahoney explains
that "given the size of the staff, we feel
we can provide better service being
open the hours we are open."
The Registrar's Office in Old Union
has many departments, not just the in
formation window. In order to keep
each department open with the limited
staff they have, Mahoney said that they
would need to predict the demand for
each office and responsibilities would
have to be staggered, which would
make them more difficult.
Mahoney said that the information
window could be kept open, but that
most inquirers would need to be
referred to another office in Old Un
ion, and those other offices would

most likely be closed.
Personally, 1 think the registrar
should at least have a telephone
manned (or womanned) and an infor
mation window open at noontime.
Nothing at the University prohibits
offices from being open at lunchtime;
scheduling is done by each office ac
cording to its staff, needs and traffic
patterns. 1 suggest that if you think a
particular office should be open, you
ought to let them know.
Dear Bug Me,
Why are the parking service people
so nosy? Why do they ask for social se
curity numbers? Why do they insist that
people with P.O. boxes also give their
street addresses? If all they want to
know is whether you live on campus or
not, they could just ask "Do you live
on campus?" Why are students and
staff parking permits different?
— Bureaucracy Hater
While the form for student and staff
parking permits asks for the social se
curity number of the applicant, it is
only required of staff members.
Ramona Kelley, manager of adminis
trative services for the Stanford Police,
said that Stanford student identification
numbers are required of student per-

Mit applicants as a means of identifica
tion, particularly for students with the
same or similar names. Permits are
given to students even if they don't
provide their social security number.
For staff members, who do not have
student ID numbers, the social security
number serves that purpose. It is also
needed for those staff members who
wish to have the price of the permit
deducted from their paycheck.
Street addresses are required, Kelley
said, because "you don't live in a box."
If your car had been stolen, its lights
were on or it was in front of a
dumpster, the police might try to con
tact you at home. They can't do that
with just your P.O. box number.
As for why staff and student permits
differ, Kelley has questioned this her
self. The best explanation is demograp
hics. The number of each type of per
mit sold can be recorded, along with
parking trends. If a number of cars
with student permits from one dor
mitory start parking in the lot of an
other, it is a tip-off to the police that
there may be inadequate parking at a
particular dorm.
It also makes it oh-so-easy for the
police to pick your car out as being
parked in the wrong lot for your per
mit.

Dear Bug Me,
I've noticed that many discount coupons say good for
25 cents off my next purchase of a breakfast cereal, and
hai>e fine print on them that says, "cash value 1/20 of
one cent." What gives? If I collect 20 of these and mail
them off to the manufacturer, will he send me a penny?
Will Mr. Wilson at the corner grocery give me a piece of
Bazooka gum if I give him 40 of these?
— Penny Pincher
Theoretically, the manufacturer will send you a penny
if you send in 20 "cents off' coupons with a cash value of
1/20 of one cent.
But don't quit your day job just yet.
The people at Proctor & Gamble tell me that the fine
print is required by law and that it is much more worth
the consumer's while to redeem the coupon at its face
value.
While manufacturer's coupons are not regulated by

federal law, they are regulated by state law which, in
most states including California, define trading stamps
and manufacturer's coupons in the same way. Therefore,
coupons must have an intrinsic cash value just as trading
stamps do.
Variation in the law exists from state to state, which is
why some coupons and some offers are unavailable in
some states.


BUG
ME
I'm not sure if the Founding Fathers,
when they gave the states some
legislative autonomy, considered that
some Americans would be unable to
get a secret spy camera from Bazooka
comics.
As for the store owner who must
redeem manufacturer's coupons or
lose his business, Joe Garcia of theJJ&F
Food Store of Falo Alto says that they
are "a losing deal."
There are myriad different manufac
turers to whom coupons must be
returned in order for them to be
redeemed. This is an extremely time
consuming task that few stores un
dertake. Instead of sorting the coupons
themselves, most stores send all their
coupons en masse to a clearinghouse
that promptly remits the store the face
value of the coupons. The clearing
house can do this because it gets to
keep the handling fee that manufac
turers pay for each coupon sent back
to them. This can be up to eight cents
per coupon.
One store owner I spoke with con
jectured that the clearinghouses send

the coupons to Guatemala, where low
wage laborers do the sorting. I tend to
doubt this.
