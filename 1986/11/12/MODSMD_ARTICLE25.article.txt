## Delightful 'Sorcerer' 
### LISA MARTINEZ 
Hie Stanford Savoyards displayed
their usual enthusiasm in their pro
duction of Gilbert and Sullivan's
"The Sorcerer" this past weekend
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium (The
production continues this
weekend).
The cast, made up of faculty, staff,
students and friends of Stanford,
presented an enjoyable perfor
rnance of one of the comic Gilbert
and Sullivan operas that make up
the Savoyards' repertoire
The strength of the production
lies in the solid performances of the
nine featured soloists As the young
maidens Aline and Constance, Julia
Teste and Cara Toss demonstrate
particularly talented voices, with
l.este acting the debonaire young
woman and Toss hamming it up as
a lovelorn girl. And as the title char
acter of the Sorcerer, Ed Glazier
breathes fire into the plot through
his charisma and creates a generally
delightful atmosphere

l ed by concert master David
Simon, The Symphonius Orchestra
creates an exciting atmosphere for
the production Although slightly
subdued in the beginning, it
becomes much more enthusiastic,
ultimately presenting a polished ac
companiment to the solo voices.
The only people deserving of
criticism in this production are the
authors themselves, Gilbert and
Sullivan "The Sorcerer" is one of
their least known operas, and
deservedly so. The plot takes a
while to get underway; it finally
livens up when the Sorcerer makes
his appearance onstage
All In all, the Savoyards' pnKluc
tion is excellent ITie entire cast has
put a lot of talent into its perfor
mances; with its tremendous en
thusiasm, it adds life to the creaky
script "The Sorcerer" is a worthy
effort and deserves to be seen by
more students than seemed to be In
attendance on opening night last
weekend.
