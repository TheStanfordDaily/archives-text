# 'La Ronde' is cute and little else
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
OK, the Drama Department s production of Arthur
Schnftzler's "La Ronde isn t a bad production. If anything,
rhe acting is good, the costumes are great and the set design
is excellent. I?>e central problem with the whole thing is the
play itself
Arthur Schnitzler (T&62-1931) is noted as one of Austria's
most brilliant dramatists His works form a telling mirror of
fin de siecle Viennese society Most of his plays are charac
terized by an interplay of passionate, fleshly desires and a
disavowal of social values and attitudes "La Ronde is no ex
ception Originally entitled Reiger," the play was written in
1897, but, because of censorship problems, was not pub
lished until 1903 The play probes the basic contradictions
of human nature by illustrating the fact that people aren t al
ways what they seem and don't always do what they say.
The structure of "La Ronde" is essentially comprised of 10
two-character vignettes, with one character from each scene
carrying on to the next scene For instance, the play starts
out with a prostitute and a soldier, the next scene is with the
soldier and a parlormaid, the third scene features the par
lormaid and another character, and so forth You get the
idea. Eventually we come full circle back to the prostitute
As a result, everyone in the play gets equal time on stage,
which is nice if you're an actor, not so nice if you're in the
audience.
"La Ronde ' becomes painfully repetitive, with each scene
saying the same thing. Young wife and husband make love
and promise to be true; next the husband and his sweet

young thing make love and promise to
be true; next, the sweet young thing
and the poet make love and promise to
be true, et cetera. Believe me, 10
scenes is a long way to go to drive
home a single point
My main criticisms are with the play,
not the actual production. The 10 ener
getic cast members all do a good job in
breaking up the inherent monotony of
the scenes, and they're the ones re
sponsible for the funny and entertain
ing moments, not Schnitzler. In addi
tion, the various costumes — uni
forms, long dresses and corsettes — all
succeed in evoking a period flavor. Fi
nally, the innovative stage set-up, with
blue lights filtered through blinds, the
red glare of a roaring fireplace and a
bed rising out of nowhere — all set
against a stark black background — is
first-rate.
When "La Ronde" was first
produced, it must have created quite a
stir with its risque subject matter.
Today, however, the play comes as a
cute, harmless allegory of human na
ture. The Drama Department's produc
tion of "La Ronde" is cute, harmless en
tertainment, and that's all.
