## Cardinal finishes season with 3-2 loss to USIU 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Two games were played at Maloney Field yesterday: the
first half and the second half. The first half was all U.S. Inter
national University. The Cardinal men's soccer team, trailing
3-0, then stormed back in the second half but still fell 3-2 in
the season finale.
Stanford came out very sluggish and flat in the first half.
The first 20 minutes of the game saw USIU dominate play
and score twice in the span of five minutes. The San Diego
based team, composed of all foreign-born players, got goals
from British junior midfielder Jeff Ward and South African
senior midfielder Mike Botha. On both occasions the USIU
scorer made an uncontested run through the 18-yard area to
convert a cross from the wing.
"The thing that really showed in the first 20 minutes was
how tired we were. We were playing our fourth game in six
days and just ran out of gas. USIU was methodical, but they
wouldn't have looked so good with a little pressure on
them," Stanford Asst. Coach Hunter Stern said.
One of the effects of the unruly schedule was Stanford's
inability to keep its marks tight in the first half. The USIU
players seemed always to be a step ahead getting to the ball.
The Cardinal fell behind 3-0 at 27:45 of the first half on an
other similar goal, also by Botha. Unmarked again, he
brought the ball under control with his chest and volleyed it
past diving Stanford goalie Tom Austin.
"Sam (Stanford Coach Koch) was as forceful and direct (at
halftime) as I've seen him all year. In five minutes he told
them what they were doing wrong and what he wanted
them to do," Stern said.
"We just wanted them to identify a guy to mark and do it.
Someone said the key to offense is defense, and once we
shut them down, we created chances of our own. In the first
half they were killing us with give-and-go's. In the second
they had only five or six."

The road back began late in the first half. Many substitu
tions were made to give the tired bodies a rest. Among the
fresh players to make a strong contribution were Chris
Seiple, Dave Kang, Mark Cisneros and Peter Graph.
"Because they haven't had much playing time, the young
guys came off (the bench) really strong and played hard We
shut them down with the new people, especially Killfoil,"
Stern said.
Sophomore fullback Jim Killfoil has been playing more
minutes with every game this season. He started the Card
inal's comeback with his first goal of the season. It came at
48:22 on a low line-drive to the far post from about six yards
out. Luke Garrot picked up an assist on the goal.
The Cardinal played inspired soccer and hustled all over
the field, keeping constant pressure on USIU following the
goal. No less than five excellent chances came and went as
Juan Garcia, Brian Mahaffey, Kevin Woodhouse, and David
Thorpe each had shots on goal.
Finally, at 88:48, the second goal came on an excellent
pass from Mahaffey to a wide-open Chris Porch who slipped
it by the USIU keeper inside the rear post. *
A common paradox of sport, the season-ending game was
both a conclusion and a beginning for the Cardinal.
"It was nice to play soccer for Stanford. There was a big
difference between this year and last year. I played with a lot
of seniors last year and a lot of younger players this season.
It's great to play with the young guys; they work hard,"
senior fullback and co-captain Neal Stephens said.
The play of the younger players yesterday bodes very well
for next season.
"I was happy to get the playing time and glad I did a
decent job and held my own. We played lousy and did
everything opposite of how we've been coached to play.
The new guys got in, played one-touch, and did what we're
supposed to do. We got two goals and almost tied it," Seiple
said.

Freshman Chris Seiple (22) came off the bench in yesterday's 3-2 loss to USIU. "I was happy to get the playing time
and glad I did a decent job and held my own," the fullback said. Many of the younger players on the squad got
playing time in Stanford's final game.
