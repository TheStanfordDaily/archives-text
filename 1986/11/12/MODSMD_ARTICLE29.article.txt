# Men's golf comes in 15th out of 16 at USF tourney
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
When its final player putted out on the 18th
green yesterday at the Olympic Club's par-71
Lake Course, the Stanford men's golf team
wasted no time putting its disappointing fall
season behind it.
"We were out of there as soon as our last
guy got off the last green," Stanford Coach
Tim Schaaf said. "We picked up our box
lunches and took off."
The Cardinal concluded its fall schedule
with a 15th-place finish at the USF Invitational.
Stanford began the day in 15th, and its 312
total yesterday could not bring it up any
higher. The Cardinal shot a three-round score
of 943, and only an atrocious 997 by St. Mary's
saved Stanford from coming in last in the 16-
team tournament.
Arizona State took a 15-shot lead into yes
terday's final round and came out with a 16-
stroke win. The Sun Devils shot 297 yesterday
to finish at 881. UCLA came in second at 897,
while San Jose State shot 295 yesterday to take

third with a 900 total.
"Arizona State and Fresno State (which did
not play this week) have taken turns all fall
being the team to beat," Schaaf said. "They are
the two best (on the West Coast), with UCLA
right behind them and Oregon right behind
UCLA''
Stanford does not play another tournament
for two months, but don't think that the Card
inal will be taking two months off. After a bas
ketball game today against the California golf
team, Stanford will back on the links.
Stanford is talented but also very young.
There are no seniors and nine freshmen on
the 17-man roster. "There is tremendous po
tential on this team," Schaaf said. "But there's
a difference between potential and ability. We
must bring our ability up to our potential."
Potential alone definitely will not make it in
the West Coast district this year. "It's just a
very strong year out here," Schaaf said.
"There are five great teams (ASU, FSU,
Arizona, UCLA and Oregon).
Tremendous improvement is something
Stanford will have to make as well if it hopes

to contend for an NCAA tournament berth
during the winter and spring seasons. "We
certainly have a chance, though we'll have to
play very well," Schaaf said.
"Right now, we're about three shots a man
worse than a really good team," Schaaf added.
"All these guys have been enormously suc
cessful at the level below the collegiate level,
and there's no reason to think they can't be
successful on the collegiate level as well."
The Stanford five this week included junior
Rich Marik, sophomore Brad Geer, sopho
more transfer (from Illinois) John Mahon and
freshmen Don Christensen and Steve White,
but Schaaf indicated that freshman Brad
Benbrook and sophomore Jeff Gilbert nearly
broke into the Cardinal lineup.
Mahon paced the Cardinal this week with a
232 total, including a 75 yesterday. Christen
sen shot 77 to finish at 233, followed by Geer
at 78 (240), White at 82 (241) and Marik at 84
(243).
Tom Stankowski of ASU was the individual
champion. His 215 beat UCLA's Brandt Jobe
by three shots.
