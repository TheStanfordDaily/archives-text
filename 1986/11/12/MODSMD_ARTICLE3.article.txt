# Dr. Ruth: Sex is good
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Warning not to "jump on the bandwagon" of concern
about date rape, premenstrual syndrome and G-spots,
sex educator Dr. Ruth Westheimer last night told a
capacity audience in Dinkelspiel Auditorium that
"anything that two consenting adults do on the privacy of
their bathroom, bedroom or kitchen floor is all right."
Responding to a question about date rape, Wes
theimer, wearing a flourescent orange dress, said she felt
that when a man and woman engage in advanced
foreplay and one of the partners declines to take the next
step and the other continues without consent, it cannot
be considered date rape because foreplay has taken
place.
Westheimer repectfully disagreed with Alice Supton,
assistant dean of Residential Education and staff advisor
to the Stanford Rape Education Project, who believed
that Westheimer was discounting the existence of date
rape by saying that engaging in foreplay committed a
couple to intercourse.
"To play like this ... is not to play fair and is not right,"
Westheimer said, arguing that if one is not willing to go
beyond foreplay, one should not engage in it.
Westheimer stressed that to worry about premenstrual
syndrome and attribute unrelated medical problems to it
harkens back to the Victorian Age when many still
prevalent myths about sexuality began.
"I believe that most women are not affected," Wes
theimer said.
Westheimer also discounted a book published several
years ago that heralded the virtues of G-spots because,

she said, "no institution Of higher learning has validated
it." Some of Westheimer's patients are overly concerned
about finding their G-spots, she said.
"I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but I'm not going on a
bandwagon."
Westheimer noted that there are a million-and-a-half
unwanted pregnancies in America. A small percentage of
those pregnancies occur for psychological reasons â€”
one of the sexual partners wants to have a child. Wes
theimer said, however, that the majority of those preg
nancies were the result of ignorance perpetuated by
myth. One of the sexual partners may believe that fer
tilization cannot occur during the first experience with
intercourse or when one of the partners does not experi
ence orgasm.
Ignoring the suggestions of those who believe that
pregnancy cannot occur when the man withdraws before
ejaculating because he has "tremendous control," Wes
theimer said the pre-ejaculatory fluid that is secreted by
the man contains thousands of sperm.
"How many sperm are needed to get her pregnant?"
Westheimer asked. "One fast one."
A proponent of what she calls "sexual literacy," Wes
theimer believes strongly in the use of contraceptives
and encouraged the audience to shout "contraceptives"
when she spoke of them in her lecture.
Westheimer responded to those who said that using a
condom is "like taking a shower with a raincoat on" by
saying that intercourse with a condom is "not the same"
as intercourse without but that "it is better than an un
wanted pregnancy."

Dr. Ruth Westheimer speaks frankly about sexuality to a capacity crowd at Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night.
"I speak explicitly, but I'm rather old-fashioned and a square," she says.
