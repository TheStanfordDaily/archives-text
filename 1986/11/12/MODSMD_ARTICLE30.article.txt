# Couch potato ponders sports subtleties and more
## 
### 
You're a couch potato. You enjoy napping, collecting
pebbles and scratching in general. To you, a football is
merely an exotic melon past its expiration date. Hitting the
backboard in basketball counts. In short, exercise means
retracing your steps for seconds on chicken chalupa.

And certainly, there's nothing wrong with this inertial
state of body stagnation. This lifestyle is just fine until that
tragic day arises. It's Friday afternoon, and your roommate

bounds in, skipping happily like a frog with a hormone
problem.
"Guess what," he or she shrieks. "I've signed you up for
the U.S Open."
You feel faint, perhaps a bit ill. The news gets exceedingly
worse.
"It's just that you don't get enough exercise," gently
reprimands your roommie. "I've signed you up for other
professional sports too."
At first, you're simply shocked and unbelieving. Later, you
realize it is indeed Stanford, and your endearing pain in the
tush probably "knows the right people."
As these thoughts waltz through your brain, two large
people, obvious fans of lifting heavy things, enter your room
and whisk you away.
Suddenly, you're courtside. John McEnroe smiles wryly
on the other side. A small boy presents a gift — it's a tennis
ball. You're doomed.
Then, without warning — more impetuous than Mac him
self — the Lord of Sports Subtleties appears. Rather than

being blessed with athletic grace or coordination, you have
magically ascertained the finer points of the game.
You begin by picking at the strings on your racket, even
going so far as throwing a little sawdust on the handle.
Next, while the Big Mac positions himself for your rocket
ing underhand serve, you deftly and ever so suavely show
him the ball. After you have lost 6-0, 6-0, the courtside
crowd — remembering your subtle professional nuances
— rationalizes that you either had a bad day or, quite
simply, a lot of drugs.
In the NBA, despite having no jumping or shooting ability,
you can still look professional. Take, for instance, the
pregame layoff. Just catch the pass and saunter slowly to the
basket. Go ahead and miss. The important facet is the slow
approach.
Once in the game, fully cognizant of your athletic inep
titude, trepidation begins to resurface. Missing lay-ups was
easy, game action presents problems.

Fear not, the NBA "look-off' remains. It's truly a subtle
maneuver, easily over-emphasized. What's required is a
slight head-bob to either the left or right before shooting
the ball — that's the look-off. Utter sweetness.
The scene is now in the heart or, at least, the left ventricle
of Texas. Thousands of rabid Houston fans stand singing
"Luv ya' blue" — in unison no less — as you and your pro
fessional football cronies trot onto the field.
You begin cursing your roommate again. Football is viol
ent. You decide no so-called professional look is worth
being laminated by an oncoming, boulder-sized pile of
bone and muscle — not to mention cartilage.
You slink over to the sidelines. Fans start to jeer, recog
nizing you as an imposter. Only one thing can save you from
ignominy — the athletic pat.
Vitalized with renewed vigor, you rush off to the edge of
the field, madly slapping your teammates on the behind.
"Thadda way," you add confidently. Onlookers nod approv
ingly: "He's a ballplayer."
