## Investment banking: big money, long hours 
### NICHOLAS VARDY 
Saloman Brothers, Drexel Burnham
Goldman Sachs: For years, these and
other Wall Street financial institutions
conjured up images of silver-haired
men conducting business while
wearing conservative three-piece suits.
These investment banking firms
recently have experienced enormous
growth in profits, visibility and
popularity.
Indeed, investment banking seems
to be the number one career choice of
college graduates in the 1980s. Last
year more than 400 of Yale's 1,250
graduating seniors applied to a single
investment banking firm — First Bos
ton. Although Stanford does not keep
similar figures for its graduates,
Yolanda Morales of the CPPC sees a
definite increase in the number of ap
plications for investment banking posi
tions over the last three years.
Investment bankers specialize in
raising equity* capital by underwriting
issues of common stock, including the
initial public offerings (IPOs) of
upstart companies. Investment bankers
buy all of the new stock from the com
pany and resell it at a specific price to
individual buyers. For the risk they

assume in underwriting an issuer, in
vestment banks ex pea to make a profit
on each share issued, as a percentage
value of the stock. They also arrange
company mergers and acquisitions.
Recruiting divisions of the top in
vestment banking firms make annual
treks to Stanford to interview inter
ested seniors. Stanford has done well
in placing its graduates with top invest
ment banking firms in both New York
and Los Angeles. Graduating seniors
are usually hired for two-year financial
analyst positions, after which many
continue to business school.
Meredith Shuwell, a recent Stanford
graduate, is now a financial analyst at
the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burn
ham Lambert. When asked why she
chose a career in investment banking,
Shuwell responded: "The challenge.
This was the most challenging job I
could find coming right out of col
lege."
Shuwell stressed that, contrary to
popular belief, getting a job in invest
ment banking does not require an ex
tensive background in finance or eco
nomics. Shuwell got her degree in bi
ology, and said she finds her back
ground an advantage because "it frees
me from any misconceptions or biases

about how financial markets work "
Many prospective applicants are
lured less by the promise of challenge
than by the staggering salaries
guaranteed by a career in investment
banking. The monetary compensation
is tantalizing. Recent graduates hired as
financial analysts start with a base
salary of close to $30,000 per year and

can earn up to $40,000 with bonuses.
Fat profits allow the banks to pay
M.B.A.'s two years out of school up to
$100,000 a year. As one rises through
the ranks to vice-president and
partner, the figures become even
greater: A 1 percent partner at
Goldman Sachs is said to pull in $5
million a year. Mike Melkin of Drexel

Burnham's Beverly Hills office, who
popularized the "junk bond" issue,
makes somewhere between $50 mil
lion and $100 million a year.
Investment banks do not mind
paying these salaries because they
believe they are paying for the bright
est and the best. Top investment banks
demand more than high achievement
demonstrated by superior grade-point
average and previous business experi
ence. They also expect their bankers to
think quickly on their feet. Interviews
for these positions are grueling. Invest
ment bankers want to see how appli
cants perform under pressure. Inter
viewers may ask applicants to do quick
numerical calculations during the in
terview or even pose hostile or per
sonal questions. One incident two
years ago at Stanford made national
news and prompted charges of sexism
when an applicant for a position at
Goldman Sachs was asked whether she
would be willing to have an abortion
to keep her job.
Shuwell, who is interviewing some
candidates for this year, put Drexel
Burnham's requirements in more gen
eral, but no less demanding, terms:
"We look for a positive attitude, persis
tence and the abiltiy to keep working
for a week on only four hours of sleep
a night." She added, "Applicants
should be comfortable with numbers."
Some of this year's applicants for
positions in investment banking are
unabashedly materialistic. Said one
senior: "A career in finance would be
my first choice anyway. But let's face it,
once you get out in the real world,
money is going to be the driving force
of your life."
In addition to the compensation, chal
lenge and prestige a career in invest
ment banking can offer, a position as a
financial analyst at a top investment
banking firm is seen as a ticket into the
top business schools. Shuwell is
unsure whether or not she will go to
business school. But if she does, she is
confident that "it'll be Stanford or Har
vard."
In spite of its impressive perks, a
career in investment banking is not for
everyone. Although it may be challeng
ing and finacially rewarding, it also
demands a grueling lifestyle and a
monomaniacal dedication to the most
tedious aspects of the deal at hand.
"When an easy week means working
only 60 hours a week and a more diffi
cult one up to 120, it does take a toll on
your social life," said Shuwell.
Indeed, there are some students
who have resisted the temptation of
going into investment banking simply
because of its new high profile and

prestige. Samira Kawash, a senior in
economics and politcal science and
director of Stanford-in-Government,
once considered a career in invest
ment banking, but later became dis
enchanted: "I don't care what they pay.
Working 70-80 hours a week doing that
is not a life," she said, adding that many
other seniors also feel that way. In
stead, Kawash intends to continue onto
graduate school and work in the field
of public policy.
Apparently, successful investment
bankers work so hard because they
love the challenge; they thrive on the
pressure. And applicants seduced by
the promise of wealth be warned:
"Don't go into this for the money,
Shuwell said. "When you work 80
hours a week, it doesn't come out to
that much an hour."
Despite its lure, the two-year finacial
analyst program has been described in
less glowing terms. One executive,
now at Harvard Business School, ad
monished a prospective applicant that
investment banks view their two-year
analysts as "cannon fodder."
Elaborated the executive: "Investment
banks recruit the best and the brightest
from the top schools, work them 80
hours a week for two years straight and
spit them back out, playing upon their
hopes of getting into a top business
school."
There is also a sense that investment
banks, as Adam Smith put it in a recent
column in Esquire, "do little more
than rearrange deck chairs on the
good ship United States." Smith is dis
turbed by the fact that bright and
talented people in our society are at
tracted to a profession that shuffles as
sets around instead of engaging in any
kind of productive activity.
Some charge that the high profile of
these firms will wane. Recently, many
American companies have been forced
to streamline their operations because
of the acute challenge from foreign
competition and the vagaries of busi
ness cycles. This may entail merging
with other companies. If the recent
"merger craze" slows, as has been
predicted, so will the activity, profits
and appeal of investment banking. In
vestment bankers will go back to
counting their salaries in thousands
and not millions.
Shuwell vehemently disagrees with
this assessment: "Companies will al
ways need to raise capital. And we'll be
there when they do."
The glamour and wealth of a career
in investment are difficult to resist for
obvious reasons: It is the quickest way
for many Stanford "red hots" to fulfill
aspirations of "work, study, get rich."

Indeed, investment banking seems
to be the number one career choice of
college graduates in the 1980s. Last
year more than 400 of Yale's 1,250
graduating seniors applied to a single
investment banking firm — First Bos
ton. Although Stanford does not keep
similar figures for its graduates,
Yolanda Morales of the CPPC sees a
definite increase in the number of ap
plications for investment banking posi
tions over the last three years.
Investment bankers specialize in
raising equity* capital by underwriting
issues of common stock, including the
initial public offerings (IPOs) of
upstart companies. Investment bankers
buy all of the new stock from the com
pany and resell it at a specific price to
individual buyers. For the risk they

assume in underwriting an issuer, in
vestment banks ex pea to make a profit
on each share issued, as a percentage
value of the stock. They also arrange
company mergers and acquisitions.
Recruiting divisions of the top in
vestment banking firms make annual
treks to Stanford to interview inter
ested seniors. Stanford has done well
in placing its graduates with top invest
ment banking firms in both New York
and Los Angeles. Graduating seniors
are usually hired for two-year financial
analyst positions, after which many
continue to business school.
Meredith Shuwell, a recent Stanford
graduate, is now a financial analyst at
the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burn
ham Lambert. When asked why she
chose a career in investment banking,
Shuwell responded: "The challenge.
This was the most challenging job I
could find coming right out of col
lege."
Shuwell stressed that, contrary to
popular belief, getting a job in invest
ment banking does not require an ex
tensive background in finance or eco
nomics. Shuwell got her degree in bi
ology, and said she finds her back
ground an advantage because "it frees
me from any misconceptions or biases

about how financial markets work "
Many prospective applicants are
lured less by the promise of challenge
than by the staggering salaries
guaranteed by a career in investment
banking. The monetary compensation
is tantalizing. Recent graduates hired as
financial analysts start with a base
salary of close to $30,000 per year and

can earn up to $40,000 with bonuses.
Fat profits allow the banks to pay
M.B.A.'s two years out of school up to
$100,000 a year. As one rises through
the ranks to vice-president and
partner, the figures become even
greater: A 1 percent partner at
Goldman Sachs is said to pull in $5
million a year. Mike Melkin of Drexel

Burnham's Beverly Hills office, who
popularized the "junk bond" issue,
makes somewhere between $50 mil
lion and $100 million a year.
Investment banks do not mind
paying these salaries because they
believe they are paying for the bright
est and the best. Top investment banks
demand more than high achievement
demonstrated by superior grade-point
average and previous business experi
ence. They also expect their bankers to
think quickly on their feet. Interviews
for these positions are grueling. Invest
ment bankers want to see how appli
cants perform under pressure. Inter
viewers may ask applicants to do quick
numerical calculations during the in
terview or even pose hostile or per
sonal questions. One incident two
years ago at Stanford made national
news and prompted charges of sexism
when an applicant for a position at
Goldman Sachs was asked whether she
would be willing to have an abortion
to keep her job.
Shuwell, who is interviewing some
candidates for this year, put Drexel
Burnham's requirements in more gen
eral, but no less demanding, terms:
"We look for a positive attitude, persis
tence and the abiltiy to keep working
for a week on only four hours of sleep
a night." She added, "Applicants
should be comfortable with numbers."
Some of this year's applicants for
positions in investment banking are
unabashedly materialistic. Said one
senior: "A career in finance would be
my first choice anyway. But let's face it,
once you get out in the real world,
money is going to be the driving force
of your life."
In addition to the compensation, chal
lenge and prestige a career in invest
ment banking can offer, a position as a
financial analyst at a top investment
banking firm is seen as a ticket into the
top business schools. Shuwell is
unsure whether or not she will go to
business school. But if she does, she is
confident that "it'll be Stanford or Har
vard."
In spite of its impressive perks, a
career in investment banking is not for
everyone. Although it may be challeng
ing and finacially rewarding, it also
demands a grueling lifestyle and a
monomaniacal dedication to the most
tedious aspects of the deal at hand.
"When an easy week means working
only 60 hours a week and a more diffi
cult one up to 120, it does take a toll on
your social life," said Shuwell.
Indeed, there are some students
who have resisted the temptation of
going into investment banking simply
because of its new high profile and

prestige. Samira Kawash, a senior in
economics and politcal science and
director of Stanford-in-Government,
once considered a career in invest
ment banking, but later became dis
enchanted: "I don't care what they pay.
Working 70-80 hours a week doing that
is not a life," she said, adding that many
other seniors also feel that way. In
stead, Kawash intends to continue onto
graduate school and work in the field
of public policy.
Apparently, successful investment
bankers work so hard because they
love the challenge; they thrive on the
pressure. And applicants seduced by
the promise of wealth be warned:
"Don't go into this for the money,
Shuwell said. "When you work 80
hours a week, it doesn't come out to
that much an hour."
Despite its lure, the two-year finacial
analyst program has been described in
less glowing terms. One executive,
now at Harvard Business School, ad
monished a prospective applicant that
investment banks view their two-year
analysts as "cannon fodder."
Elaborated the executive: "Investment
banks recruit the best and the brightest
from the top schools, work them 80
hours a week for two years straight and
spit them back out, playing upon their
hopes of getting into a top business
school."
There is also a sense that investment
banks, as Adam Smith put it in a recent
column in Esquire, "do little more
than rearrange deck chairs on the
good ship United States." Smith is dis
turbed by the fact that bright and
talented people in our society are at
tracted to a profession that shuffles as
sets around instead of engaging in any
kind of productive activity.
Some charge that the high profile of
these firms will wane. Recently, many
American companies have been forced
to streamline their operations because
of the acute challenge from foreign
competition and the vagaries of busi
ness cycles. This may entail merging
with other companies. If the recent
"merger craze" slows, as has been
predicted, so will the activity, profits
and appeal of investment banking. In
vestment bankers will go back to
counting their salaries in thousands
and not millions.
Shuwell vehemently disagrees with
this assessment: "Companies will al
ways need to raise capital. And we'll be
there when they do."
The glamour and wealth of a career
in investment are difficult to resist for
obvious reasons: It is the quickest way
for many Stanford "red hots" to fulfill
aspirations of "work, study, get rich."
