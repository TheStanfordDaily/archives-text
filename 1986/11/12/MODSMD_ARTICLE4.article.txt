A consortium for Hispanic studies based at Stanford and
the Social Science Research Council in New York have won
a $1.8 million grant from the Ford Foundation to expand re
search on Latino public policy.
"The Ford Foundation has made an important commit
ment to fund Hispanic research. This is the most money any
foundation has given to fund research on Hispanic public
policy. The Ford Foundation has definitely taken a leader
ship position among foundations in initiating research into
Hispanic issues," said Albert Camarillo, the director of the
Interuniversity Program for Latino Research (IlIP) at Stan
ford.

The lUP will use the grant to host a 1987 and a 1989 re
search competition. Acceptable areas for research include
the employment and economic well-being of the Latino
population in the United States, income security for Latinos,
Latinos and criminal justice, and the state of Hispanics in the
U.S. labor market.
"We're emphasizing areas of research about which very
little is known (by decision makers). We're going to fund
some important and creative projects so that they (the
Hispanic academic community) might have a chance to in
fluence public policy," said Rudy de la Graza, the chairman
of the joint lUP/Social Science Research Council (SSRC)
committee that directs the project.
The lUP will publish the findings of
each year's group of researchers and
disseminate them to local, state and na
tional public policy circles.
"Policy makers don't have very good
sources to turn to when they are
making decisions that could affect

Hispanics," Graza said. "We want to
find out the relevant information, tar
get the people who need it to make
decisions about public policy and then
provide them with that information."
By doing these things, the lUP hopes to
benefit Hispanic populations in the
areas of employment, immigration,
education and housing, he said.
The lUP has designed a second set of
programs to help outfit more
Hispanics for careers in academics.

"All of the programs are important,
but they're all different. Each of them
shore up the pipeline for Hispanics in
academic careers ... and help some
obtain assistant professorships and
tenures," said Camarillo, also a profes
sor of history here. Camarillo said the
lUP is concerned that a dispropor
tionately low number of Hispanic un
dergraduates, graduate students and
professors study and work at U.S. col
leges and universities.
