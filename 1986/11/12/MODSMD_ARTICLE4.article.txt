A consortium for Hispanic studies based at Stanford and
the Social Science Research Council in New York have won
a $1.8 million grant from the Ford Foundation to expand re
search on Latino public policy.
"The Ford Foundation has made an important commit
ment to fund Hispanic research. This is the most money any
foundation has given to fund research on Hispanic public
policy. The Ford Foundation has definitely taken a leader
ship position among foundations in initiating research into
Hispanic issues," said Albert Camarillo, the director of the
Interuniversity Program for Latino Research (IlIP) at Stan
ford.

The lUP will use the grant to host a 1987 and a 1989 re
search competition. Acceptable areas for research include
the employment and economic well-being of the Latino
population in the United States, income security for Latinos,
Latinos and criminal justice, and the state of Hispanics in the
U.S. labor market.
"We're emphasizing areas of research about which very
little is known (by decision makers). We're going to fund
some important and creative projects so that they (the
Hispanic academic community) might have a chance to in
fluence public policy," said Rudy de la Graza, the chairman
of the joint lUP/Social Science Research Council (SSRC)
committee that directs the project.
