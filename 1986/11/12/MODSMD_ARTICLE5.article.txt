Two El Salvador Earthquake Relief
concerts held yesterday in Memorial
Church were great successes, accord
ing to promoters of the events.
"Everything went great. We had a
very good turnout," said concert or
ganizer Ed Gilliland of Stanford Sanc
tuary, one of the groups presenting the
concerts. South Bay Covenant and the
Committee of Refugees from El Sal
vador also sponsored the concert.
Gi'ililand estimated that 200 people
were present at the afternoon show

and 400 at the evening show.
The concert lienefitted victims of the
Oct. 10 EI Salvador earthquake, which
killed over 1,200 people, left hundreds
of thousands homeless and destroyed
up to 90 percent of the buildings in the
capital city of San Salvador.
The concert's main attraction was
the group Mancotal, a very popular
Latin American band that has a world
wide following and flew in from
Nicaragua just hours before the con
cert. The band has played in concerts
and music festivals in San Francisco
and New York City and has already

released several albums.
"The concert was really great," said
junior Rachel Harrison. "I enjoyed it so
much that 1 bought Mancotal's tape."
Sophomore Fiona Adamson added:
"I had heard of Mancotal on the radio,
and when I read ... that they were
playing here, I had to go. They were
really hot."
The concert organizers hoped to
raise at least $5,000 through proceeds
and donations. The money will be dis
tributed through the Share Project of
San Francisco to the Archdiocese of
San Salvador, which will distribute aid
throughout El Salvador. The money
will go for direct assistance in the form
of food, shelter and medical supplies
for the people most dramatically af
fected, said Gilliland.
The El Salvador earthquake was
greeted with much less publicity than
last year's Mexico City disaster and,
therefore, El Salvador has received
much less economic aid from neigh
boring countries.
Gilliland also said that the assistance
received so far has been channeled
toward the wealthier commercial com
munities and not to the most needy,
the refugees living in shanty towns
outside of San Salvador. This is the rea
son why the money is being dis
tributed through the church instead of
the regular channels, he said.
The diverse crowd attending the
benefit concert included students,
small children and people of all ages.
The fans all seemed to enjoy the wide
variey of music, which included jazz,
rock, rhythm and blues, salsa and
reggae.
