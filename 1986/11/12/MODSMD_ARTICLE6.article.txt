# ASSU nixes Daniloff talk
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate decided last night
not to fund a $5,715 request by the
Speakers Bureau to bring Nicholas
Daniloff — the Moscow correspondent
for U.S. News and World Report who
was held by the Soviet Union in Sep
tember under charges of espionage —
to Stanford next Thursday. The $5,715
request was part of a $10,000
honorarium designated for Daniloff.
In other business, the senate passed
a resolution urging Athletic Director
Andy Geiger to reconsider his decision
suspending the Band from the field
during Big Game and listened to a spe
cial University presentation on plans
for a 780-bed graduate housing com
plex near Escondido Village.
After a hotly contested discussion,
the senate rejected the funding request
for Daniloff by an 8-8 vote. A majority
vote by the senators was necessary for
approval. Noting that the Speakers
Bureau at Harvard and Yale get their
speakers at far lower costs, some
senators said that $10,000 was too

much money to give to Daniloff.
According to Council of President
(COP) member Rudy Fuentes,
DanilofFs visit would coincide with the
Big Game Bonfire and performances
of Gaieties and, therefore, it would
have intense competition for student
interest.
In support of Daniloffs presence,
senator Danny Berns said that the
honorarium was justified because
Daniloff was the focal point of U.S.-
Soviet relations for two weeks this fall.
Another senator said that DanilofFs
visit would lend credibility to the
Speakers Bureau and the senate after
students protested the $7,500
honorarium for Dr. Ruth Westheimer,
who spoke at Stanford last night.
According to graduate senator
Steven Hellman, the Budget and
Finance Committee can still give the
Speakers Bureau the funds even
though the senate as a whole rejected
the request. If the senate doesn't give
the money, Daniloff may still come to
the University if other sources help
