# ASSU nixes Daniloff talk
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate decided last night
not to fund a $5,715 request by the
Speakers Bureau to bring Nicholas
Daniloff — the Moscow correspondent
for U.S. News and World Report who
was held by the Soviet Union in Sep
tember under charges of espionage —
to Stanford next Thursday. The $5,715
request was part of a $10,000
honorarium designated for Daniloff.
In other business, the senate passed
a resolution urging Athletic Director
Andy Geiger to reconsider his decision
suspending the Band from the field
during Big Game and listened to a spe
cial University presentation on plans
for a 780-bed graduate housing com
plex near Escondido Village.
After a hotly contested discussion,
the senate rejected the funding request
for Daniloff by an 8-8 vote. A majority
vote by the senators was necessary for
approval. Noting that the Speakers
Bureau at Harvard and Yale get their
speakers at far lower costs, some
senators said that $10,000 was too

much money to give to Daniloff.
According to Council of President
(COP) member Rudy Fuentes,
DanilofFs visit would coincide with the
Big Game Bonfire and performances
of Gaieties and, therefore, it would
have intense competition for student
interest.
In support of Daniloffs presence,
senator Danny Berns said that the
honorarium was justified because
Daniloff was the focal point of U.S.-
Soviet relations for two weeks this fall.
Another senator said that DanilofFs
visit would lend credibility to the
Speakers Bureau and the senate after
students protested the $7,500
honorarium for Dr. Ruth Westheimer,
who spoke at Stanford last night.
According to graduate senator
Steven Hellman, the Budget and
Finance Committee can still give the
Speakers Bureau the funds even
though the senate as a whole rejected
the request. If the senate doesn't give
the money, Daniloff may still come to
the University if other sources help
finance the honorarium, Hellman said.
Wilbur Fellows have already offered
$1,000 and the Office of Student Affairs
$2,000 for the honorarium.
In the resolution sent to Geiger, the
senate urged him to let the Band play
at Big Game and protested the manner
in which Geiger made the original
decision.
Senator Fred Cate said, "I think the
issue is the freedom of expression. "
According to Fuentes, the COP was
never approached by Geiger before he
made his decision even though the
senate and the COP were designed to
interact with the University on these
types of problems.
The senate passed the resolution
unanimously with two abstentions.
In a special presentation to the sen
ate, Carol Muller, project coordinator
for new housing, and Norm Robinson,
associate dean of Student Affairs, dis
cussed University plans for graduate
housing.
The Board of Trustees has awarded
concept, site and design approval to a
$30 million graduate housing project
to be located between Escondido Road

and Bowdoin Road on Campus Drive.
The buildings will form an L-shape
around Mirrielees and Escondido Vil
lage.
The construction of the new facility
is slated to begin in the spring and the
University hopes the housing complex
will be available for student use by the
fall of 1988, according to Muller.
When designing this new housing,
the planners addressed the special
needs of single graduates, Muller said.
Since resources for undergraduate
and graduate housing are tied to
gether, the construction of future un
dergraduate residences will be
delayed by this project, according to
Muller. The graduate students helped
to support construction of Sterling
Quad, now the undergraduates must
help finance the new graduate facility,
she said.
