# CIR releases first discussion paper
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility today made public the first
of four discussion papers that the CIR
hopes will elicit opinions from the
Stanford community regarding U.S.
companies operating in South Africa.
"When you put the four (papers) to
gether," said CIR Chairman Frederick
Hillier, "they really do form a cohesive
unit that involves the disinvestment
debate: Should U.S. companies
withdraw from South Africa?"
But if the CIR develops an affirma
tive answer, it will not then recom
mend that the Board of Trustees sell
Stanford's stock in South Africa-related
companies, Hillier said. Rather, the an
swer will determine the ClR's stance
on stockholder-sponsored resolutions
that call for companies to withdraw
from South Africa.
Hillier said each of the 64 compan
ies in the University's $170 million
portfolio of South Africa-related stocks
will face such a resolution at its 1987
annual meeting.
Junior Stacey Leyton, a member of

Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA),
said that if the CIR decides companies
should withdraw, the University
should establish a deadline for them to
pull out of South Africa. Leyton, also an
ASSU senator, said that if a company
misses the deadline, Stanford should
divest from it.
Hillier said Stanford's divestment
policy includes a floor and a ceiling.
If a company does not meet the Uni
versity's minimum standards for social
activism in South Africa, it is not above
the floor, and Stanford should divest
from it. The outstanding actions of
some companies in South Africa place
them above an imaginary ceiling, Hil
lier said, and Stanford should encour
age those firms to remain in South
Africa. As for those companies in the
middle, the University should retain its
stock in them, but pressure them to
withdraw from South Africa, Hillier
said.
"That ceiling hasn't been estab
lished, and feedback would help us es
tablish that," Hillier said.
The topics of the papers are:
