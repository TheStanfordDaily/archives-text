Progress at Geneva arms talks
GENEVA — The chief American negotiator said the round of nuclear
arms talks that will end today have been the most productive so far, partly
because of "phenomenal agreements" reached at the U.S.-Soviet summit in
Iceland.
Max Kampelman said the basis for the Reykjavik agreements between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was laid in previous
sessions of the Geneva talks, which began March 12,1985.
Kampelman said American and Soviet negotiators made progress at the
sixth round in all three fields covered in Geneva: medium-range missiles;
long-range, or strategic, nuclear weapons, and space and defense systems.
In an interview yesterday with The Associated Press, the U.S. delegation
chief said: "The agreements in Reykjavik as translated here have narrowed
the gap between us. We still have a gap to narrow further, and we still have
serious significant differences of opinion and differences of interest.
"But when I look at the round and see all that has been accomplished
here, I have to say this is the most productive round we've had."
The United States feels an arms control agreement could be reached in
the next year if each side makes a serious effort, he said. Both Washington
and Moscow have brought new proposals to Geneva since the Oct. 11-12
summit.
Agreement is nearest on medium-range missiles, Kampelman said,
noting that Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to eliminate them in Europe and
retain 100 warheads each on U.S. and Soviet territory.
Inherent in the Soviet position is a demand that research for the U.S.
space-based defense project commonly called "Star Wars" be confined to
the laboratory for 10 years. The Soviets contend that research beyond that
would violate the ABM treaty of 1972, which the United States denies.
Putting Japan on 'short leash'
SANTA CLARA — If Japan continues unfair and illegal trade practices,
Congress is likely to produce anti-Japanese legislation that "hits them
where it hurts" and sends them into a major depression, Commerce Un
dersecretary Bruce Smart warned yesterday.
Smart said the United States has given Japanese semiconductor makers
"a very short leash" to cut down sharply on chip "dumping" at prices
below fair market value in other countries.
"Certainly by the end of the year, we want to see a significant change in
what's happening in third countries," Smart said in an interview between
meetings with Silicon Valley executives.
Under threat of penalties, Japanese chip makers have virtually ended
dumping practices in the United States. But Smart agreed with industry
leaders who claim that Japan is still dumping chips in other countries,
where they are bought by computer companies to the detriment of U.S.
sales.
If the Japanese government is unable or unwilling to pressure its chip
makers to adhere to the dumping provisions of the recently signed agree
ment, Smart said the United States would consider retaliatory action.
Shultz: OAS against Nicaragua
GUATEMALA CITY — Secretary of State George Shultz said yesterday that
he found a growing level of support among the members of the Organiza
tion of American States for U.S. efforts to overturn the leftist government in
Nicaragua.
"Nobody has a good word to say for Nicaragua any more," Shultz said
following private talks with leaders attending the annual General Assembly
of the OAS.
In contrast to the near unanimity he claimed he found among delegates,
Shultz was barraged with critical questions from Latin American journalists
during a press conference on the lawn of the U.S. ambassador's residence
here.
"I have no doubt at all that there would be a general sigh of relief if we
saw a shift to a pluralistic democracy in Nicaragua and an end to the effort
to subvert its neighbors," Shultz said. He ruled out direct U.S. military in
tervention in Nicaragua, saying flady, "There won't be any."
Shultz did not directly mention U.S. support for the contras, who have
begun to receive $100 million in aid from the United States, but he said,
"We cannot give lip service to democracy when it is convenient and cost
less, but turn our backs on it when there are costs or risks."
In addition to his talks with all OAS representatives, Shultz conferred
with the foreign ministers of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa
Rica during a private lunch that preceded the press conference. Nicaragua
was the only Central American nation excluded from that meeting.
Earlier, in his speech to the OAS assembly, Shultz warned that Central
America would never achieve peace or stability until there is an end to So
viet bloc influence in Nicaragua.
Rhine spill enters North Sea
GENEVA — Pollution that was released into the Rhine River in Switzer
land 10 days ago and left behind a trail of half a million dead fish and eels
in West Germany reached the North Sea yesterday, officials said.
In Basle, Switzerland, journalists accused the Sandoz chemical company,
which originated the chemical spill, of conducting a deliberate campaign
to prevent information on the extent of the accident from reaching the
public.
There have been no reports of dead fish in The Netherlands, which was
hit by the pollution Monday. But Dutch experts said that water fleas
exposed to the contaminated water died within a short period. Water fleas
are an essential food for fish.
West German officials said the poisonous insecticides and mercury that
washed into the Rhine after a fire broke out at Sandoz on Nov. 1 were not
the only toxic substances released.
Gerhard Weiser, environmental minister of the West German state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, told reporters in Stuttgart he had information from
Swiss authorities that 980 pounds of pesticides from the chemical firm of
Ciba-Geigy, located near Sandoz, had also been washed into the river.
European Community environmental ministers are to meet on Nov. 24
to discuss ways to improve precautionary measures to prevent similar inci
dents.
Transport ministers from The Netherlands and France meeting in Brus
sels, Belgium, accused Switzerland of deficiencies in its information policy
and said they would bring up the question of Swiss financial liability at a
conference today in Zurich by all countries concerned.
Cal. secretary of state assaulted
LOS ANGELES — An ax-wielding intruder broke into the home of Cali
fornia Secretary of State March Fong Eu and robbed her after he beat her
and dragged her through the residence by her hair, a spokeswoman said
yesterday.
Eu, 64, suffered facial cuts and bruises during the attack Monday night.
She was in satisfactory condition at Wesiside Hospital, but was deeply
traumatized by the assault and will undergo plastic surgery, an aide said.
"She is sleeping, finally They were able to sedate her," said her press
secretary, Caren Daniels-Meade.
Eu was expected to remain in the hospital for a few days. Two state
police officers were assigned to guard her at the hospital, and another two
kept watch on her home yesterday.
Police said there was no reason to believe the attacker recognized his
victim, or that the assault was politically motivated, Daniels-Meade said.
The attacker beat Eu with "the blunt side of the ax blade, rather than the
handle, and not with the blade" as he dragged her by the hair through her
home, demanding money, Daniels Meade said.
Eu gave the robber "a small sum," and the man fled, the press secretary
said. She refused to disclose how much the robber was given.
Eu and her husband, Henry, a millionaire from Singapore and Hong
Kong, had entertained dinner guests earlier in the evening at their Han
cock Park home in a fenced neighborhood with a 24-hour .security guard,
Daniels-Meade said
