This issue of The Student Body
examines what AIDS is, and what
it means for the Stanford
community. It is an attempt to
help you answer "What can I do to
reduce my risk of getting AIDS?"
We hope you come away with
sufficient information to separate
myth from fact in order to make
informed personal decisions.
Clearly there are sexual behaviors
which are high risk and should be
avoided. However; the
information here is intended to
provide guidance for each of us to
make the best possible personal
decisions.
Some of the language in this
issue is explicit. While this may be
uncomfortable for some, the
dangers now associated with
transmission of disease through
sexual contact make it essential to
understand which sexual practices
are "safer" and which are not.
This has to he understood
explicitly.
Because the evidence is changing
rapidly, we at Cowell offer this not
as the last word on AIDS, but the
latest. We hope to keep the
Stanford community as up to date
on the issues as possible.
