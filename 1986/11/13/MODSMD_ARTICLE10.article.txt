GLOSSARY

AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome)- A serious
condition characterized by a defect
in natural immunity against
disease. With this loss in immune
response, the individual falls prey
to a host of what are called
"opportunistic infections." It is not
highly contagious. AIDS is
specifically transmitted through
sexual contact or by direct infusion
of infected blood or blood products.
ANTIBODY- Protein substance
developed by the body to fight
disease organisms. Not effective
against virus which is inside cells.
ARC (AIDS Related Complex)-
Characterized by fever, wasting
and/or fungus infection of mouth
and throat. It is not known what
percentage of people with ARC or
LAS (below) will go on to develop
full-blown AIDS.
ARV (AIDS related virus) - Same
as HIV
CARRIER - Virus-infected
individuals with no symptoms.
Most of these people are unaware
that they are infected. These
individuals represent a major
potential source of new infection
since they are fully capable of
transmitting the virus to others.
COFACTORS- Other
characteristics of the individual
which may make them more
susceptible to the AIDS virus.
ELISA (Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay) - A test
measuring antibodies in the blood
to the HIV virus. This test tells
only that the individual has been
exposed to the virus. It does not
predict that that individual will
develop AIDS.
FALSE NEGATIVE- A negative
test in someone who in fact has
been infected by the virus but for
some reason has not developed the
antibody.
FALSE POSITIVE- A positive
test for HIV antibody, usually a
result of an artifact of the
laboratory test, in someone who
has not in fact been exposed to the
virus. All persons with positive
results should have test repeated
at least once.
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency
Virus) - The virus that causes
AIDS. Also called HTLV-111/LAV.
HLTV - 111 (Human
T-Lymphotrophic Virus Type III) -
The virus that causes AIDS. Also
called HIV and LAV.

INCUBATION PERIOD - The
time between infection with the
AIDS virus and the onset of
symptoms. Seems to range from 6
months to 7 years or more. Not
everyone exposed to the virus
develops the disease, at least over
a 7 year period.

A B OUT

INVOLVED CELLS - The HIV
virus changes the protein on the
surface of T-4 lymphocytes (helper
cells) in such a way to prevent
them from activating B cells
(antibody producing cells) and
killer T cells. Band T cells are
responsible for fighting the virus,
but will not go into action unless
the T-4 system is intact. HIV
destroys the T-4 cells.
KAPOSI'S SARCOMA (KS) - A
type of cancer usually occuring on
the surface of the skin or in the
mouth. KS may also spread to
other organs of the body.
Normally found as a slowly
progressing cancer in elderly men.
LAS (Lymphadenopathy
Syndrome)- Disease of the lymph
nodes - part of ARC.
LAV (Lymphadenopathy
associated virus) - Same as HIV
OPPORTUNISTIC
INFECTIONS- Illness which
would not be a threat to anyone
whose immune system was
functioning normally.
PNEUMOCYSTIC CARINII
(PCP)- A parasitic infection of
the lungs. One of the two rare
diseases that affect 85% of AIDS
patients. PCP has symptoms
similar to any other form of severe
pneumonia, cough, fever and
difficulty breathing. This
infection rarely if ever affects
individuals with normal
immunity.
POPULATIONS AT HIGHEST
RlSK(descending order of risk)
1. Sexually active homosexual men
with multiple partners

2. Sexually active bisexual men
with multiple partners
3. Present or past abusers of
intravenous drugs
4. Prostitutes
5. Female Partners of bisexual men
6. Heterosexual men and women
with multiple partners.

"SAFE SEX" - Relatively "safer
sex" is condom protected sex with
the use of spermicidal foam.
Sexual practices involving tissue
injury (e.g., anal sex) are extremely
dangerous and should be avoided.
Unprotected oral sex carries the
potential of viral transmission.
VIRUS - Minute, parasitic
organism which depends on
nutrients inside cells for its
metabolic and reproductive needs.
These organisms cause a variety of
infectious diseases and stimulate
host antibodies. Unlike a bacteria,
unable to survive long on its own.
Not affected by antibotics.

TRANSMISSION OF THE AIDS VIRUS

Dr. Edgar Engleman ;
Director of the Blood Bank, Stanford •
•Casual Contact
There is no evidence at this time :
that the AIDS virus can be
transmitted through the use of public •
swimming pools, spas, hot tubs, i
showers, or toilets used previously by •
an infected individual, or by "rubbing
shoulders" with an AIDS patient or :
carrier in a theater, store, or work •
place. The virus does not survive in •
water and no cases have been :
reported involving documented •
transmission through the air. I
Similarly, there is no evidence that I
AIDS can be contracted from dishes, :
food or personal objects touched by a •
patient or carrier. All available i
evidence indicates that the AIDS •
virus can be transmitted only through •
a transfer of body fluids, either :
through intimate contact (e.g. •
through vaginal or anal intercourse) •
or intravenous injection. i

• Infectivity
Despite the overwhelming
symptoms seen in infected
individuals, the AIDS virus appears
not to be highly contagious. The fact
that there have been no reported
cases of AIDS among health care
workers in the U.S. specifically
linked to occupational exposure
supports this. Exposure, refers not
only to the direct care of these
patients or to the handling of their
food, blood, bedpans, etc., but also to
numerous incidents of exposure to
potentially infected body fluids.
In the United States, there have
now been more than 500 "AIDS
needlestick injuries", many followed
for more than two years. At this date
fewer than ten of the victims have
even developed antibodies to the
AIDS virus.
These data, while not definitive,
suggest that not only is exposure to
blood or intimate sexual contact
required for infection but also that the
amount of the virus to which an
individual is exposed is critical.
Repeated exposure to the virus may
also play a role in susceptibility.
•AIDS, ARC, and
the Carrier State
Currently, there are
approximately 28,500 reported cases
of the full-blown AIDS syndrome in
this country. There are at least five
times as many patients with
symptomatic AIDS related
conditions. Beyond these
individuals, however, there are
perhaps one to two million
individuals without symptoms but
infected with the virus - the vast
majority of whom are unaware that
they are infected. These individuals
represent a major potential source of
new infections since, as far as we
know, they are fully capable of
transmitting the virus to others. Of
those individuals who are infected
with the virus, approximately 10 to
30 percent are expected to contract
the full-blown AIDS syndrome over a
five year period, perhaps an
additional 30 to 40 percent will
contract one of the lesser AIDS
related conditions, and perhaps 50
percent will remain as asymptomatic
"carriers". There is reason to believe
that infected individuals remain
infected, and potentially infectious,
for their lifetimes. Even among those
who show symptoms, the time from
initial exposure to the onset of
symptoms is close to three years and
ranges from six months to seven years
or more.
The crucial issue is that at the
present time, most of the individuals
carrying the virus and capable of
transmitting it to others are unaware
of their status and do not feel ill. It
