# TALK ABOUT SEX
## 
### Doryn Davis Chervin, Dr. P. H 
It is clear to most people who have been
following the AIDS crisis that AIDS is primarily a
sexually transmitted disease.Being sexually
transmitted means it is a behavioral disease,
a disease of what we do and don't do.

What does AIDS mean for each of
us practically? It means we have
to evaluate our sexual practices
and decisions. Even
more difficult is the importance
of finding out our partner's sexual
history in order for us to make
more informed decisions.
So, why is it so difficult to
discuss our sexual pasts in order
to make more comfortable decisions
now? It is difficult because most
of us have this firm belief that
talking takes away from doing.
Talking, especially about matters
as sensitive as one's previous
sexual relationships, is felt to
decrease spontaneity and take
away some of the mystery of
a sexual encounter. It can be
experienced as a wall put up in
front of the wave of passion
and sexual excitement. Talking
disrupts the flow.
In addition, talking about sex
or your concerns about sexually
transmitted disease, introduces
negative aspects into an otherwise
romantic moment. All of a sudden
images of disease, lesions, and
risks replace a pounding heart.

Also, you may worry that
your partner may think you have
a reason to ask. You may be
concerned that he or she assumes
there is a problem.
So, what happens if you don't
talk? Denial can be an effective
defense mechanism, but it does
not protect you from a sexually
transmitted disease. The result,
if you don't talk:
- fear for what you didn't
clarify
-uncertainty about what may
happen to you in the future
-concern about what you may
transmit to other partners
-possibility of ignoring
physical symptoms that occur
-WORRY!!!
Additionally, not discussing an
issue as important as your concerns
about sex and your sexual past may
set a pattern in the relationship
of not talking openly and of not
confronting important concerns.
We offer the following
guidelines for talking with your
partner.

How to Talk
Be direct. Be prepared to talk
about your past experience. Persist
even if the other person wants to
brush your concerns aside. Be
prepared to postpone or not have
sexual relations if the other person
isn't responsive to your concerns or
is not taking you seriously.
When to Talk
Timing is always the key.
Admittedly, discussing these
issues is difficult because it may
appear that you are assuming
intimacy and your partner may
not. However, it is much better to
talk before you get physically
intimate. This is the best time to
discuss the kind of intimacy you
are comfortable with. If you don't
talk before the passion becomes the
moment, you can always stop the
process at any point. While this
may be awkward, it still saves you
from worrying and from being
exposed to something you could
have prevented.
If you were sexually intimate, it
is still important to talk. It is
never too late. You can learn that
there was nothing to worry about,
that you want to use condom
protected sex or sexual practices
that do not include an exchange of
body fluids, or that you decide not
to have sex again with this person.
What to Say
Acknowledge the awkwardness
or difficulty in talking. Let your
partner know you care about him or
her. Volunteer information about
your sexual history and health.
Ask for his or her sexual history.
Decide what you both feel
comfortable doing sexually. View
talking together as a process and
not a one time event.
Keep in mind that any attempts
to write down conversations
like these will appear contrived.
They are only meant as a guide for
possible directions in conversation.
You may want to practice what
you are going to say beforehand
even though it may feel awkward.
If you can talk about this,you can
talk about other difficult things in
your relationship.
Jane to John
This is hard to talk about and I
want you to know that I really care
about you. I'd like for us to sleep
together and I think we'd better
talk. I want you to know I've never
had herpes and I don't think I've
been exposed to any other sexually
transmitted diseases. But I can't be
100 percent for sure. I hope you

understand why we need to talk
about this and why I need to know
about you...(John replies)... Since
we have both been sexually
involved with other people and
need to protect each other, I'd like
for us to use condoms if we are going
to have intercourse. I'm planning
to use a diaphram for contra
ception.
Dave to Susan
There is something I need to tell
you. I really like you a lot and
going to bed with you was great. I
feel bad I didn't mention this
before, but I want to tell you now. I
had sex with a male friend of mine
a while ago. After that, I decided
it wasn't for me. With eveiything
in the newspapers about AIDS, I
feel a little worried. We are still
friends and he seem healthy - but
it's still on my mind. I would feel
better if we used condoms and foam
from now on. If you are
uncomfortable with that, we can
still make each other feel good
without having intercourse. How
do you feel about this?
Peter and Robert
Robert: Peter, I need to talk with
you about something. It's not easy
and I hope you don't think I'm
assuming too much. We've been
spending a lot of time together and
before we get more physical, I
think we should talk about AIDS.
Peter: I'm attracted to you too,
Robert, and I'm glad you brought
this up because it has been on my
mind lately. I've been hesitating
to talk about sex and AIDS. I don't
want to take any chances and I
don't want you to take any either.
Robert: I feel the same way. I'd
like us to use condoms and
spermicidal jelly as a lubricant.
(Conversation continues. Peter and
Robert decide not to have oral sex
and to try only dry kissing.) I'm
glad we finally talked about this.
