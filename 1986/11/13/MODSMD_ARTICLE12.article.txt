### John Dorman, M. D 
■ had only seen one
previous patient with
AIDS- generally I
considered it a disease
that was up in San Francisco,
not here at Stanford. Ralph
(not his real name) was an
older graduate student, and he
was homosexual. He was not
particularly promiscuous. He
had a job in a field in which I
had some interest, and he
became my friend as well as
my patient.

Ralph - not his real name - was
an older graduate student, and he
was homosexual. He was not
particularly promiscuous. He had
a job in a field in which I had some
interest, and he became my friend
as well as my patient.
Although he came to Cowell •
several times for sexually-related
complaints over his graduate
school career, he had not seen me
for these. I saw liim twice for
minor problems before he came to
my office early in the fall quarter
several years ago, with a one week
history of abdominal pain. I
wasn't sure what was wrong with
him that day; I did not think he
had appendicitis, but I did think
that a parasite was a possibility,
as sometimes happens with gay
men. Lab tests were suggestive but
not especially helpful.
Over the next couple of days, he
was getting worse, but the test
results didn't hang together at all.
It's hard to remember how I felt
then - doctors write information in
the chart about the patient, not
how they themselves are reacting
to the situation. There are,
however, words like "uncertain",
"possible considerations", and
"will try..."; it's clear from the
chart that I did not really know
what was going on. Often,
confusing combinations of symptoms
and lab results will be found in
rheumatologic diseases, such as
rheumatoid arthritis or lupus;
consequently I referred him to a
rheumatologist.
