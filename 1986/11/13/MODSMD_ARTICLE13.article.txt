# RALPH
## 
### 
It was not cancer. Ralph had a
rare fungal infection that most
people, if they get it at all, get
mildly in their lungs. Ralph's
infection was in his large intestine,
and it was not mild. Knowing that
he was gay and now with a very
unusual infection, the medical staff
at the hospital made a
presumptive diagnosis of AIDS.
The testing that we have now is
not perfect, but it is quite
definitive. However, it was not
available at that time. Since not
much was known about casual
contagion, Ralph was immediately
put in isolation, and everyone going
in to see him had to put on gown,
mask, and gloves. I recall thinking
that of all times, this is not the
time that he needs to be isolated -
he needs to have people around
him. I tried to visit him every
day.
Surprisingly, Ralph got better
from his fungal infection. He had
intravenous treatment three times
a week for about four months. Over
the seven or eight months
following the IV therapy he came
back in to see me about once a
month, usually with a minor
complaint that he wanted checked
out. He would apologize for being
a hypochondriac, but we both felt
that everything needed to be

checked out, however small.
Nothing serious ever showed up. I
think both of us felt like the
mythical sword of Damocles was
hanging by a thread over his head.
I searched the medical literature
for evidence that maybe he didn't
really have AIDS after all. One
report even indicated that the
fungal infection (that he had
recovered from) could mimic AIDS.
Ralph graduated from Stanford,
but we had gone through so much
together that I agreed to keep him
on as a private patient. As news of
his diagnosis leaked out, he lost
his job. He eventually requested
that I refer him up to a physician
in San Francisco who specialized in
AIDS. Using the newly available
ELISA diagnostic test, he
confirmed the diagnosis, to our
sorrow but not to our surprise.
However, he also said that he had
several patients like Ralph, who
though they definitely had the
disease, were doing quite well
months or years after diagnosis.
Eventually Ralph decided to
move back home. It was with a
mixture of relief and sadness that I
sent him off, in apparent good
health, with a letter of referral to
physicians there. This fall I
learned that he had died at home
last spring. He had apparently
gotten worse almost immediately
on his arrival there.
Doctors are supposed to be used to
death; we ultimately fail with all
of our patients. I have had many
patients die, when I was in
training or more recently on
sabbatical in Africa. But one of the
characteristics of student health is
that the patients hardly ever die -
even if they are seriously ill.
Usually they drop out of school
first. Maybe I have gotten out of
the habit of accepting death when
it comes.
I'm not sure what I learned from
Ralph. Since he looked so well
when I last saw him, I'm not sure
that I ever really believed, on an
emotional level, that he had
AIDS until I learned that he was
dead. That perhaps is the most
scary part, that someone so young
and apparently healthy can have
a fatal disease that kills so fast.
Ralph at least knew that he had
AIDS. How many other
apparently healthy infected
people are out there? The
apparent inevitability of his
death certainly underscores the
need for the kind of educational
effort that we have made here.
Like me, many physicians will
lose patients they care about who
have AIDS. The statistics and
predictions make it almost certain.
All of you - be careful out there.
