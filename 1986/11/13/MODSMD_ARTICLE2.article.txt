### Anne Crosby Perkins Stanford '82 
I will tell you a story of the end of one young man's all too
short life, his tragic and painful death. This story is about my big
brother, Bill Crosby, my partner in the world since birth and my
friend forever. Although Bill's story is. basically very sad, it is not
without hope.
Bill died of AIDS on October 19,1985. He was 27 years old.
Bill, an aspiring dancer/choreographer lived with his
roommate, Lori and his cat, Sushi in the East Village of New York
City. He worked two jobs waiting tables, took dance classes and
performed with a company. A graduate of New York University

ONE PERSON'S EXPERIENCE WITH AIDS

School of the Arts, his "breaks'

were starting to open up his dancing career. His life was
epitomized by the words: potential, possibility, hope.
Bill was gay and had been since he could remember. My
brother liked the good life and lived in the fast lane. According
to Lori, his good friend and confidante, Bill had a very active sex
life, too many partners to count including those he hardly knew.
Although he wanted to settle down with one man, he hadn't had
a long-term relationship for the last three or four years of his life.
Our family had a hard time understanding and accepting
Bill's homosexuality; but, to Bill his family's acceptance of his
gay lifestyle was of utmost importance to his own sense of
self-esteem, to his belief that he was a loved human being. We
all learned a lot from Bill's struggle to accept himself and forgive
those who couldn 't accept his sexual orientation.
Bill's life wasn't easy.
