# AIDS
## 
### Anne Crosby Perkins Stanford '82 
I will tell you a story of the end of one young man's all too
short life, his tragic and painful death. This story is about my big
brother, Bill Crosby, my partner in the world since birth and my
friend forever. Although Bill's story is. basically very sad, it is not
without hope.
Bill died of AIDS on October 19,1985. He was 27 years old.
Bill, an aspiring dancer/choreographer lived with his
roommate, Lori and his cat, Sushi in the East Village of New York
City. He worked two jobs waiting tables, took dance classes and
performed with a company. A graduate of New York University

ONE PERSON'S EXPERIENCE WITH AIDS

School of the Arts, his "breaks'

were starting to open up his dancing career. His life was
epitomized by the words: potential, possibility, hope.
Bill was gay and had been since he could remember. My
brother liked the good life and lived in the fast lane. According
to Lori, his good friend and confidante, Bill had a very active sex
life, too many partners to count including those he hardly knew.
Although he wanted to settle down with one man, he hadn't had
a long-term relationship for the last three or four years of his life.
Our family had a hard time understanding and accepting
Bill's homosexuality; but, to Bill his family's acceptance of his
gay lifestyle was of utmost importance to his own sense of
self-esteem, to his belief that he was a loved human being. We
all learned a lot from Bill's struggle to accept himself and forgive
those who couldn 't accept his sexual orientation.
Bill's life wasn't easy.
When AIDS became a public issue,
three or four years ago, Bill went into
a panic, as we all did. He read
everything he could on AIDS, its
causes, social ramifications, political
issues, potential cures, and safe sex
practices. Bill became an informed
man on the issue of AIDS. Whether
his knowledge came too late or
whether it was psychologically
necessary to deny the threat to his
life, we will never know. It seems we
have this conditional response to
tragedy: "This could never happen to
„ _ tf
me.
As though he knew his worst fear
would be confirmed by the results,
Bill never took the AIDS antibody
test. Whether or not I think Bill
should have taken the test is
irrelevant, the choice was not mine to
make. Receiving a positive result
would have changed his life
drastically, in a way he wasn't
prepared for. I'm not sure anyone is
prepared for their life sentence. On
the other hand, I wish Bill knew
how much he was loved and received
the support he needed.
There were many clues to Bill's
infection months before his public
diagnosis. These clues included night
sweats, chronic fatigue, weight loss
and long recovery periods from
illnesses. These clues weren't obvious
to Bill's friends and family—our
mindsets look for normal behavior
and logical explanations. For
example, Bill came down with a
bronchitis infection in August which
kept him in bed for almost a month.
We all nicely rationalized his slow
recovery by remembering when Bill's
roommate, Lori had had a similar
slow recovery from a virus the
summer before. Bill went to see his
doctor, Dr. Goozner, regularly and
Lori has found receipts for different
antibiotic prescriptions given to Bill
on a monthly basis. Still, no one close
to Bill was alarmed, either because
Bill didn't give the complete picture
of his symptoms, or because we didn't
know enough about AIDS.
October 2
Bill went to Dr. Goozner
complaining of a lingering cold and
shortness of breath. The doctor told
Bill to check himself into St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
immediately, without detour, for
some tests. Bill was told that he had
pneumonia and the test was a biopsy
which would tell him if he had
Pneumocystis carinii.
Thursday, October 3
Lori brought in his clothes and
some tapes as she was under the
assumption that Bill had pneumonia
and was in for some tests. She was
told that he would be in the hospital
over the weekend. I spoke with Bill
on the phone. He used an oxygen
mask to breathe but we carried on a
conversation for about 20 minutes. We
spoke about the possibility of an
AIDS diagnosis and how scary that
reality would be. He tried to
describe the happenings of the
previous two days and how it was
that he was in the hospital. Aside
from the fact that his breathing was
labored and his voice was muffled by
the oxygen mask, I would say it was
one of our more typical conversations.
I didn't expect that it would be our
last.
Friday, October 4
Bill had a biopsy, which was
physically very painful. His pain
was increased, however, after being
told by Dr. Goozner that he had
Pneumocystis carinii and full blown
AIDS. When Lori went to see him,
he told her that he had
Pneumocystis, but that he didn't
have AIDS. She believed him, not
knowing that otherwise very
healthy young men rarely come down
with Pneumocystis unless they have
a severely depressed immune
response. That day Bill did tell one
friend that he had AIDS and broke
down crying, unable to finish the
phone conversation.
Saturday, October 5
In the morning, I called Bill at his
hospital room but he was too weak
and in too much physical pain to
talk. I'm sure his emotional pain and
his heavy dose of denial prevented
him from making the effort. The
feeling of not knowing was
frustrating; and yet my own illusions
of hope wanted to believe he was
OK, that he wasn't going to die.
Sometimes the truth is just too
painful to face.
Sunday, October 6
Lori went to visit Bill only to find
his hospital bed empty. Afraid he
had died, she panicked and started
to cry. When she learned that he
was moved to the intensive care unit,
her relief was short-lived. She
couldn't stay long as her own
sympathetic reaction disabled her.
She couldn't breathe and she felt
faint every time she saw him in that
beeping, hissing, buzzing
atmosphere. She still believed what
Bill had told her the day before,
that he didn't have AIDS.
IVlonday, October 7
A tension filled day for my sister
Diana and I here on the west coast.
Having been unsuccessful at getting a
straight answer from Bill, my mother
made an appointment to speak with
Dr. Goozner. When I received the
phone call from Mom that Monday
evening, I became hysterical, my
brother was going to die of AIDS.
What do we do? Tm coming out," I
told her, "This is very serious and I
want to be with him." Mom was a
little more calm because the doctor
was anticipating that Bill would

pull through this bout of pneumonia
if he responded well to the
antibiotics. He has a young, healthy
body and he was diagnosed early,
the doctor told her.
Tuesday, October 8
Bill's prognosis didn't look so
optimistic. He was put on a
respirator and appeared to be in a lot
of pain. Lori didn't find out about
Bill's AIDS diagnosis until early
that Tuesday morning and her daily
visit to Bill was short and
distressing. \
Wednesday, October 9
My mother called us to report
that Bill was doing much better. He
seemed to be responding to the
antibiotics and seemed to be out of
the woods. Because he was still on
the respirator, he communicated on a
pad. He made jokes with Lori, sent
my mother and other brother on
errands for him and generally
appeared to be in higher spirits. The
doctor advised my parents to go away
for the weekend to rest. Bill was in
for the long haul, said Dr. Goozner.
That advice was the beginning of a
long and frustrating weekend for me.
My Mom had been my only connection
to Bill and now she was going to
Vermont. Being so far away, I was
convinced that Bill wasn't getting
the proper hospital care, that he
should be flown out to San Francisco
where the hospital care and the
social services are supposedly the
best.
I think somewhere in the back of
my mind I felt I could cure Bill. I
thought that my love for him could
pull him through this first bout and
nurse him until he came down with
the next illness doled out by his
suppressed immune system. This
false sense of personal healing power
and my critical attitude towards
everyone else's ability stemmed from
my own inability to accept his death.
I sought the counsel of another
Stanford grad, Patty Christen, who
works for the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation. She has a lot of
experience with friends dying of
AIDS and her main message to me
was "what are you waiting for?" Her
line of thinking really threw me for a
loop because I had been lulled into
the illusion of Bill's progress. I told
Patty that I thought Bill would need
me later, when he would try to put
his life back together. Patty knew
all to well that with AIDS victims
you can't depend on a later....
I spent the next two days in an
exasperating search for news on Bill's
progress. I could not get through to
the hospital. I was put on hold,
transferred, and disconnected all over

the place. I kept trying his room,
somehow believing that he would be
there, recovering beautifully.
IVlonday, October 14
I finally got through to intensive
care and talked with a nurse there.
She didn't say much, but the shock of
her information was disturbing.
Having thought that Bill was out of
the woods, I was surprised to find
that Bill was in the intensive care
unit. The nurse said the patient was
agitated, due to the repeated
attempts to take him off the
respirator over the weekend.
What was happening to my
brother? What was I still doing
here?
Tuesday, October 15
I got a call at my office. It was my
sister Diana who had just spoken
with Dad. "It doesn't look good
Annie. The doctor doesn't think he's
going to make it." Six hours and
many tears later Diana and I were on
People's Express to Newark hoping
that our brother hadn't died before
our arrival.
Wednesday, October 16
I was definitely unprepared for my
meeting with Bill. They had
performed a tracheotomy the day
before to make the respirator more
comfortable. He had tubes invading
his body pumping in fluids and air
and disposing of his waste. He was
white and sweating and his eyes
were filled with panic and pain.
Every breath was a struggle and his
convulsive coughs were silent except
for the hiss of the suction tubes as he
tried to work the fluids out of his
heavy lungs.
After 30 long seconds at his
bedside, I grabbed the nearest nurse
and asked her to escort me out of the
intensive care unit as I leaned
heavily on her arm. Little sister
Annie who was going to come save
the day almost passes out at the
sight of the brother she loves.
As I sat in the bathroom with my
head between my knees, the hard
reality struck me. Bill was going to
die. I could not pull him through no
matter how much I love him. We all
wanted to believe that this wasn't
really happening to Bill, that this
was all just a bad nightmare that
would disappear when we woke up.
Thursday and Friday, October 17
and IS
I was learning how to be with Bill
in his new world, his new reality.
Being nurturing and fearless in

critical, life-threatening situations
does not come naturally to most
people and must be learned. Lori
helped me get my courage up to go
back into the intensive care unit and
talk to Bill, to say the things that I
wanted to say. Bill was so heavily
sedated that his moments of clarity
were short-lived. When he was
awake he tried to be attentive. At
this point it was too tiring for him to
write but sometimes he would point
or try to mouth the words. He was
easily frustrated and most of the
time opted to save his energy for the
laborious act of breathing.
Diana, Lori and I spent these last
two days of Bill's life taking turns
sitting with him, getting him ice and
vaseline, moving his bed up and
down, wiping the sweat off his brow
and watching him sleep. Even his
sleep was labored and I felt glad
that he had morphine. When we
weren't in with Bill we were in the
waiting room, crying, talking with
his friends, reading about death and
trying to make sense of it all.
Dr. Goozner was helpful by being
direct and honest. Bill did not have
long to live and we needed to give the
hospital permission to withhold
resuscitation in the event of heart
failure. The doctors and the nurses
really seemed to care for Bill as a
person. They would lean down close
to Bill to speak to him and read his
lips in response. But these
professionals were overworked and
couldn't be with Bill as much as he
seemed to need them.
Diana took the last shift with Bill
before we left him on that Friday
nighf. His distress was constant. She
was running around trying to serve his
every need, getting the nurses'
attention, and asking for more
morphine. He should not be left in
pain. As we left he was sleeping,
Diana and I stood by his bed and said
goodbye as if we knew that this
would be the last time we would see
him.
Saturday, October 19
At 1:00 a.m. we got the call from
Dr. Goozner. Bill had died. The
immediate cause of death was heart
failure. He went peacefully.
For Bill AIDS did not mean the
difficult adjustment to life with
AIDS, the political struggle to
protect the rights of people with
AIDS, the threat of mass quarantine.
For Bill, his family and his friends,
AIDS meant death.

Pneumocystis carinii.
Thursday, October 3
Lori brought in his clothes and
some tapes as she was under the
assumption that Bill had pneumonia
and was in for some tests. She was
told that he would be in the hospital
over the weekend. I spoke with Bill
on the phone. He used an oxygen
mask to breathe but we carried on a
conversation for about 20 minutes. We
spoke about the possibility of an
AIDS diagnosis and how scary that
reality would be. He tried to
describe the happenings of the
previous two days and how it was
that he was in the hospital. Aside
from the fact that his breathing was
labored and his voice was muffled by
the oxygen mask, I would say it was
one of our more typical conversations.
I didn't expect that it would be our
last.
Friday, October 4
Bill had a biopsy, which was
physically very painful. His pain
was increased, however, after being
told by Dr. Goozner that he had
Pneumocystis carinii and full blown
AIDS. When Lori went to see him,
he told her that he had
Pneumocystis, but that he didn't
have AIDS. She believed him, not
knowing that otherwise very
healthy young men rarely come down
with Pneumocystis unless they have
a severely depressed immune
response. That day Bill did tell one
friend that he had AIDS and broke
down crying, unable to finish the
phone conversation.
Saturday, October 5
In the morning, I called Bill at his
hospital room but he was too weak
and in too much physical pain to
talk. I'm sure his emotional pain and
his heavy dose of denial prevented
him from making the effort. The
feeling of not knowing was
frustrating; and yet my own illusions
of hope wanted to believe he was
OK, that he wasn't going to die.
Sometimes the truth is just too
painful to face.
Sunday, October 6
Lori went to visit Bill only to find
his hospital bed empty. Afraid he
had died, she panicked and started
to cry. When she learned that he
was moved to the intensive care unit,
her relief was short-lived. She
couldn't stay long as her own
sympathetic reaction disabled her.
She couldn't breathe and she felt
faint every time she saw him in that
beeping, hissing, buzzing
atmosphere. She still believed what
Bill had told her the day before,
that he didn't have AIDS.
IVlonday, October 7
A tension filled day for my sister
Diana and I here on the west coast.
Having been unsuccessful at getting a
straight answer from Bill, my mother
made an appointment to speak with
Dr. Goozner. When I received the
phone call from Mom that Monday
evening, I became hysterical, my
brother was going to die of AIDS.
What do we do? Tm coming out," I
told her, "This is very serious and I
want to be with him." Mom was a
little more calm because the doctor
was anticipating that Bill would

pull through this bout of pneumonia
if he responded well to the
antibiotics. He has a young, healthy
body and he was diagnosed early,
the doctor told her.
Tuesday, October 8
Bill's prognosis didn't look so
optimistic. He was put on a
respirator and appeared to be in a lot
of pain. Lori didn't find out about
Bill's AIDS diagnosis until early
that Tuesday morning and her daily
visit to Bill was short and
distressing. \
Wednesday, October 9
My mother called us to report
that Bill was doing much better. He
seemed to be responding to the
antibiotics and seemed to be out of
the woods. Because he was still on
the respirator, he communicated on a
pad. He made jokes with Lori, sent
my mother and other brother on
errands for him and generally
appeared to be in higher spirits. The
doctor advised my parents to go away
for the weekend to rest. Bill was in
for the long haul, said Dr. Goozner.
That advice was the beginning of a
long and frustrating weekend for me.
My Mom had been my only connection
to Bill and now she was going to
Vermont. Being so far away, I was
convinced that Bill wasn't getting
the proper hospital care, that he
should be flown out to San Francisco
where the hospital care and the
social services are supposedly the
best.
I think somewhere in the back of
my mind I felt I could cure Bill. I
thought that my love for him could
pull him through this first bout and
nurse him until he came down with
the next illness doled out by his
suppressed immune system. This
false sense of personal healing power
and my critical attitude towards
everyone else's ability stemmed from
my own inability to accept his death.
I sought the counsel of another
Stanford grad, Patty Christen, who
works for the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation. She has a lot of
experience with friends dying of
AIDS and her main message to me
was "what are you waiting for?" Her
line of thinking really threw me for a
loop because I had been lulled into
the illusion of Bill's progress. I told
Patty that I thought Bill would need
me later, when he would try to put
his life back together. Patty knew
all to well that with AIDS victims
you can't depend on a later....
I spent the next two days in an
exasperating search for news on Bill's
progress. I could not get through to
the hospital. I was put on hold,
transferred, and disconnected all over

the place. I kept trying his room,
somehow believing that he would be
there, recovering beautifully.
IVlonday, October 14
I finally got through to intensive
care and talked with a nurse there.
She didn't say much, but the shock of
her information was disturbing.
Having thought that Bill was out of
the woods, I was surprised to find
that Bill was in the intensive care
unit. The nurse said the patient was
agitated, due to the repeated
attempts to take him off the
respirator over the weekend.
What was happening to my
brother? What was I still doing
here?
Tuesday, October 15
I got a call at my office. It was my
sister Diana who had just spoken
with Dad. "It doesn't look good
Annie. The doctor doesn't think he's
going to make it." Six hours and
many tears later Diana and I were on
People's Express to Newark hoping
that our brother hadn't died before
our arrival.
Wednesday, October 16
I was definitely unprepared for my
meeting with Bill. They had
performed a tracheotomy the day
before to make the respirator more
comfortable. He had tubes invading
his body pumping in fluids and air
and disposing of his waste. He was
white and sweating and his eyes
were filled with panic and pain.
Every breath was a struggle and his
convulsive coughs were silent except
for the hiss of the suction tubes as he
tried to work the fluids out of his
heavy lungs.
After 30 long seconds at his
bedside, I grabbed the nearest nurse
and asked her to escort me out of the
intensive care unit as I leaned
heavily on her arm. Little sister
Annie who was going to come save
the day almost passes out at the
sight of the brother she loves.
As I sat in the bathroom with my
head between my knees, the hard
reality struck me. Bill was going to
die. I could not pull him through no
matter how much I love him. We all
wanted to believe that this wasn't
really happening to Bill, that this
was all just a bad nightmare that
would disappear when we woke up.
Thursday and Friday, October 17
and IS
I was learning how to be with Bill
in his new world, his new reality.
Being nurturing and fearless in

critical, life-threatening situations
does not come naturally to most
people and must be learned. Lori
helped me get my courage up to go
back into the intensive care unit and
talk to Bill, to say the things that I
wanted to say. Bill was so heavily
sedated that his moments of clarity
were short-lived. When he was
awake he tried to be attentive. At
this point it was too tiring for him to
write but sometimes he would point
or try to mouth the words. He was
easily frustrated and most of the
time opted to save his energy for the
laborious act of breathing.
Diana, Lori and I spent these last
two days of Bill's life taking turns
sitting with him, getting him ice and
vaseline, moving his bed up and
down, wiping the sweat off his brow
and watching him sleep. Even his
sleep was labored and I felt glad
that he had morphine. When we
weren't in with Bill we were in the
waiting room, crying, talking with
his friends, reading about death and
trying to make sense of it all.
Dr. Goozner was helpful by being
direct and honest. Bill did not have
long to live and we needed to give the
hospital permission to withhold
resuscitation in the event of heart
failure. The doctors and the nurses
really seemed to care for Bill as a
person. They would lean down close
to Bill to speak to him and read his
lips in response. But these
professionals were overworked and
couldn't be with Bill as much as he
seemed to need them.
Diana took the last shift with Bill
before we left him on that Friday
nighf. His distress was constant. She
was running around trying to serve his
every need, getting the nurses'
attention, and asking for more
morphine. He should not be left in
pain. As we left he was sleeping,
Diana and I stood by his bed and said
goodbye as if we knew that this
would be the last time we would see
him.
Saturday, October 19
At 1:00 a.m. we got the call from
Dr. Goozner. Bill had died. The
immediate cause of death was heart
failure. He went peacefully.
For Bill AIDS did not mean the
difficult adjustment to life with
AIDS, the political struggle to
protect the rights of people with
AIDS, the threat of mass quarantine.
For Bill, his family and his friends,
AIDS meant death.
Anne Crosby Perkins graduated
from Stanford in 1982. She now
works at the School of Education.
I will tell you a story of the end of one young man's all too
short life, his tragic and painful death. This story is about my big
brother, Bill Crosby, my partner in the world since birth and my
friend forever. Although Bill's story is. basically very sad, it is not
without hope.
Bill died of AIDS on October 19,1985. He was 27 years old.
Bill, an aspiring dancer/choreographer lived with his
roommate, Lori and his cat, Sushi in the East Village of New York
City. He worked two jobs waiting tables, took dance classes and
performed with a company. A graduate of New York University

ONE PERSON'S EXPERIENCE WITH AIDS

School of the Arts, his "breaks'

were starting to open up his dancing career. His life was
epitomized by the words: potential, possibility, hope.
Bill was gay and had been since he could remember. My
brother liked the good life and lived in the fast lane. According
to Lori, his good friend and confidante, Bill had a very active sex
life, too many partners to count including those he hardly knew.
Although he wanted to settle down with one man, he hadn't had
a long-term relationship for the last three or four years of his life.
Our family had a hard time understanding and accepting
Bill's homosexuality; but, to Bill his family's acceptance of his
gay lifestyle was of utmost importance to his own sense of
self-esteem, to his belief that he was a loved human being. We
all learned a lot from Bill's struggle to accept himself and forgive
those who couldn 't accept his sexual orientation.
Bill's life wasn't easy.
When AIDS became a public issue,
three or four years ago, Bill went into
a panic, as we all did. He read
everything he could on AIDS, its
causes, social ramifications, political
issues, potential cures, and safe sex
practices. Bill became an informed
man on the issue of AIDS. Whether
his knowledge came too late or
whether it was psychologically
necessary to deny the threat to his
life, we will never know. It seems we
have this conditional response to
tragedy: "This could never happen to
„ _ tf
me.
As though he knew his worst fear
would be confirmed by the results,
Bill never took the AIDS antibody
test. Whether or not I think Bill
should have taken the test is
irrelevant, the choice was not mine to
make. Receiving a positive result
would have changed his life
drastically, in a way he wasn't
prepared for. I'm not sure anyone is
prepared for their life sentence. On
the other hand, I wish Bill knew
how much he was loved and received
the support he needed.
There were many clues to Bill's
infection months before his public
diagnosis. These clues included night
sweats, chronic fatigue, weight loss
and long recovery periods from
illnesses. These clues weren't obvious
to Bill's friends and family—our
mindsets look for normal behavior
and logical explanations. For
example, Bill came down with a
bronchitis infection in August which
kept him in bed for almost a month.
We all nicely rationalized his slow
recovery by remembering when Bill's
roommate, Lori had had a similar
slow recovery from a virus the
summer before. Bill went to see his
doctor, Dr. Goozner, regularly and
Lori has found receipts for different
antibiotic prescriptions given to Bill
on a monthly basis. Still, no one close
to Bill was alarmed, either because
Bill didn't give the complete picture
of his symptoms, or because we didn't
know enough about AIDS.
October 2
Bill went to Dr. Goozner
complaining of a lingering cold and
shortness of breath. The doctor told
Bill to check himself into St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
immediately, without detour, for
some tests. Bill was told that he had
pneumonia and the test was a biopsy
which would tell him if he had
Pneumocystis carinii.

doctor advised my parents to go away
for the weekend to rest. Bill was in
for the long haul, said Dr. Goozner.
That advice was the beginning of a
long and frustrating weekend for me.
My Mom had been my only connection
to Bill and now she was going to
Vermont. Being so far away, I was
convinced that Bill wasn't getting
the proper hospital care, that he
should be flown out to San Francisco
where the hospital care and the
social services are supposedly the
best.
I think somewhere in the back of
my mind I felt I could cure Bill. I
thought that my love for him could
pull him through this first bout and
nurse him until he came down with
the next illness doled out by his
suppressed immune system. This
false sense of personal healing power
and my critical attitude towards
everyone else's ability stemmed from
my own inability to accept his death.
I sought the counsel of another
Stanford grad, Patty Christen, who
works for the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation. She has a lot of
experience with friends dying of
AIDS and her main message to me
was "what are you waiting for?" Her
line of thinking really threw me for a
loop because I had been lulled into
the illusion of Bill's progress. I told
Patty that I thought Bill would need
me later, when he would try to put
his life back together. Patty knew
all to well that with AIDS victims
you can't depend on a later....
I spent the next two days in an
exasperating search for news on Bill's
progress. I could not get through to
the hospital. I was put on hold,
transferred, and disconnected all over

the place. I kept trying his room,
somehow believing that he would be
there, recovering beautifully.
IVlonday, October 14
I finally got through to intensive
care and talked with a nurse there.
She didn't say much, but the shock of
her information was disturbing.
Having thought that Bill was out of
the woods, I was surprised to find
that Bill was in the intensive care
unit. The nurse said the patient was
agitated, due to the repeated
attempts to take him off the
respirator over the weekend.
What was happening to my
brother? What was I still doing
here?
Tuesday, October 15
I got a call at my office. It was my
sister Diana who had just spoken
with Dad. "It doesn't look good
Annie. The doctor doesn't think he's
going to make it." Six hours and
many tears later Diana and I were on
People's Express to Newark hoping
that our brother hadn't died before
our arrival.
Wednesday, October 16
I was definitely unprepared for my
meeting with Bill. They had
performed a tracheotomy the day
before to make the respirator more
comfortable. He had tubes invading
his body pumping in fluids and air
and disposing of his waste. He was
white and sweating and his eyes
were filled with panic and pain.
Every breath was a struggle and his
convulsive coughs were silent except
for the hiss of the suction tubes as he
tried to work the fluids out of his
heavy lungs.
After 30 long seconds at his
bedside, I grabbed the nearest nurse
and asked her to escort me out of the
intensive care unit as I leaned
heavily on her arm. Little sister
Annie who was going to come save
the day almost passes out at the
sight of the brother she loves.
As I sat in the bathroom with my
head between my knees, the hard
reality struck me. Bill was going to
die. I could not pull him through no
matter how much I love him. We all
wanted to believe that this wasn't
really happening to Bill, that this
was all just a bad nightmare that
would disappear when we woke up.
Thursday and Friday, October 17
and IS
I was learning how to be with Bill
in his new world, his new reality.
Being nurturing and fearless in

critical, life-threatening situations
does not come naturally to most
people and must be learned. Lori
helped me get my courage up to go
back into the intensive care unit and
talk to Bill, to say the things that I
wanted to say. Bill was so heavily
sedated that his moments of clarity
were short-lived. When he was
awake he tried to be attentive. At
this point it was too tiring for him to
write but sometimes he would point
or try to mouth the words. He was
easily frustrated and most of the
time opted to save his energy for the
laborious act of breathing.
Diana, Lori and I spent these last
two days of Bill's life taking turns
sitting with him, getting him ice and
vaseline, moving his bed up and
down, wiping the sweat off his brow
and watching him sleep. Even his
sleep was labored and I felt glad
that he had morphine. When we
weren't in with Bill we were in the
waiting room, crying, talking with
his friends, reading about death and
trying to make sense of it all.
Dr. Goozner was helpful by being
direct and honest. Bill did not have
long to live and we needed to give the
hospital permission to withhold
resuscitation in the event of heart
failure. The doctors and the nurses
really seemed to care for Bill as a
person. They would lean down close
to Bill to speak to him and read his
lips in response. But these
professionals were overworked and
couldn't be with Bill as much as he
seemed to need them.
Diana took the last shift with Bill
before we left him on that Friday
nighf. His distress was constant. She
was running around trying to serve his
every need, getting the nurses'
attention, and asking for more
morphine. He should not be left in
pain. As we left he was sleeping,
Diana and I stood by his bed and said
goodbye as if we knew that this
would be the last time we would see
him.
Saturday, October 19
At 1:00 a.m. we got the call from
Dr. Goozner. Bill had died. The
immediate cause of death was heart
failure. He went peacefully.
For Bill AIDS did not mean the
difficult adjustment to life with
AIDS, the political struggle to
protect the rights of people with
AIDS, the threat of mass quarantine.
For Bill, his family and his friends,
AIDS meant death.
Anne Crosby Perkins graduated
from Stanford in 1982. She now
works at the School of Education.
I will tell you a story of the end of one young man's all too
short life, his tragic and painful death. This story is about my big
brother, Bill Crosby, my partner in the world since birth and my
friend forever. Although Bill's story is. basically very sad, it is not
without hope.
Bill died of AIDS on October 19,1985. He was 27 years old.
Bill, an aspiring dancer/choreographer lived with his
roommate, Lori and his cat, Sushi in the East Village of New York
City. He worked two jobs waiting tables, took dance classes and
performed with a company. A graduate of New York University

ONE PERSON'S EXPERIENCE WITH AIDS

School of the Arts, his "breaks'

were starting to open up his dancing career. His life was
epitomized by the words: potential, possibility, hope.
Bill was gay and had been since he could remember. My
brother liked the good life and lived in the fast lane. According
to Lori, his good friend and confidante, Bill had a very active sex
life, too many partners to count including those he hardly knew.
Although he wanted to settle down with one man, he hadn't had
a long-term relationship for the last three or four years of his life.
Our family had a hard time understanding and accepting
Bill's homosexuality; but, to Bill his family's acceptance of his
gay lifestyle was of utmost importance to his own sense of
self-esteem, to his belief that he was a loved human being. We
all learned a lot from Bill's struggle to accept himself and forgive
those who couldn 't accept his sexual orientation.
Bill's life wasn't easy.
When AIDS became a public issue,
three or four years ago, Bill went into
a panic, as we all did. He read
everything he could on AIDS, its
causes, social ramifications, political
issues, potential cures, and safe sex
practices. Bill became an informed
man on the issue of AIDS. Whether
his knowledge came too late or
whether it was psychologically
necessary to deny the threat to his
life, we will never know. It seems we
have this conditional response to
tragedy: "This could never happen to
„ _ tf
me.
As though he knew his worst fear
would be confirmed by the results,
Bill never took the AIDS antibody
test. Whether or not I think Bill
should have taken the test is
irrelevant, the choice was not mine to
make. Receiving a positive result
would have changed his life
drastically, in a way he wasn't
prepared for. I'm not sure anyone is
prepared for their life sentence. On
the other hand, I wish Bill knew
how much he was loved and received
the support he needed.
There were many clues to Bill's
infection months before his public
diagnosis. These clues included night
sweats, chronic fatigue, weight loss
and long recovery periods from
illnesses. These clues weren't obvious
to Bill's friends and family—our
mindsets look for normal behavior
and logical explanations. For
example, Bill came down with a
bronchitis infection in August which
kept him in bed for almost a month.
We all nicely rationalized his slow
recovery by remembering when Bill's
roommate, Lori had had a similar
slow recovery from a virus the
summer before. Bill went to see his
doctor, Dr. Goozner, regularly and
Lori has found receipts for different
antibiotic prescriptions given to Bill
on a monthly basis. Still, no one close
to Bill was alarmed, either because
Bill didn't give the complete picture
of his symptoms, or because we didn't
know enough about AIDS.
October 2
Bill went to Dr. Goozner
complaining of a lingering cold and
shortness of breath. The doctor told
Bill to check himself into St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
immediately, without detour, for
some tests. Bill was told that he had
pneumonia and the test was a biopsy
which would tell him if he had
Pneumocystis carinii.
Thursday, October 3
Lori brought in his clothes and
some tapes as she was under the
assumption that Bill had pneumonia
and was in for some tests. She was
told that he would be in the hospital
over the weekend. I spoke with Bill
on the phone. He used an oxygen
mask to breathe but we carried on a
conversation for about 20 minutes. We
spoke about the possibility of an
AIDS diagnosis and how scary that
reality would be. He tried to
describe the happenings of the
previous two days and how it was
that he was in the hospital. Aside
from the fact that his breathing was
labored and his voice was muffled by
the oxygen mask, I would say it was
one of our more typical conversations.
I didn't expect that it would be our
last.
Friday, October 4
Bill had a biopsy, which was
physically very painful. His pain
was increased, however, after being
told by Dr. Goozner that he had
Pneumocystis carinii and full blown
AIDS. When Lori went to see him,
he told her that he had
Pneumocystis, but that he didn't
have AIDS. She believed him, not
knowing that otherwise very
healthy young men rarely come down
with Pneumocystis unless they have
a severely depressed immune
response. That day Bill did tell one
friend that he had AIDS and broke
down crying, unable to finish the
phone conversation.
Saturday, October 5
In the morning, I called Bill at his
hospital room but he was too weak
and in too much physical pain to
talk. I'm sure his emotional pain and
his heavy dose of denial prevented
him from making the effort. The
feeling of not knowing was
frustrating; and yet my own illusions
of hope wanted to believe he was
OK, that he wasn't going to die.
Sometimes the truth is just too
painful to face.
Sunday, October 6
Lori went to visit Bill only to find
his hospital bed empty. Afraid he
had died, she panicked and started
to cry. When she learned that he
was moved to the intensive care unit,
her relief was short-lived. She
couldn't stay long as her own
sympathetic reaction disabled her.
She couldn't breathe and she felt
faint every time she saw him in that
beeping, hissing, buzzing
atmosphere. She still believed what
Bill had told her the day before,
that he didn't have AIDS.
IVlonday, October 7
A tension filled day for my sister
Diana and I here on the west coast.
Having been unsuccessful at getting a
straight answer from Bill, my mother
made an appointment to speak with
Dr. Goozner. When I received the
phone call from Mom that Monday
evening, I became hysterical, my
brother was going to die of AIDS.
What do we do? Tm coming out," I
told her, "This is very serious and I
want to be with him." Mom was a
little more calm because the doctor
was anticipating that Bill would

pull through this bout of pneumonia
if he responded well to the
antibiotics. He has a young, healthy
body and he was diagnosed early,
the doctor told her.
Tuesday, October 8
Bill's prognosis didn't look so
optimistic. He was put on a
respirator and appeared to be in a lot
of pain. Lori didn't find out about
Bill's AIDS diagnosis until early
that Tuesday morning and her daily
visit to Bill was short and
distressing. \
Wednesday, October 9
My mother called us to report
that Bill was doing much better. He
seemed to be responding to the
antibiotics and seemed to be out of
the woods. Because he was still on
the respirator, he communicated on a
pad. He made jokes with Lori, sent
my mother and other brother on
errands for him and generally
appeared to be in higher spirits. The
doctor advised my parents to go away
for the weekend to rest. Bill was in
for the long haul, said Dr. Goozner.
That advice was the beginning of a

I was learning how to be with Bill
in his new world, his new reality.
Being nurturing and fearless in

critical, life-threatening situations
does not come naturally to most
people and must be learned. Lori
helped me get my courage up to go
back into the intensive care unit and
talk to Bill, to say the things that I
wanted to say. Bill was so heavily
sedated that his moments of clarity
were short-lived. When he was
awake he tried to be attentive. At
this point it was too tiring for him to
write but sometimes he would point
or try to mouth the words. He was
easily frustrated and most of the
time opted to save his energy for the
laborious act of breathing.
Diana, Lori and I spent these last
two days of Bill's life taking turns
sitting with him, getting him ice and
vaseline, moving his bed up and
down, wiping the sweat off his brow
and watching him sleep. Even his
sleep was labored and I felt glad
that he had morphine. When we
weren't in with Bill we were in the
waiting room, crying, talking with
his friends, reading about death and
trying to make sense of it all.
Dr. Goozner was helpful by being
direct and honest. Bill did not have
long to live and we needed to give the
hospital permission to withhold
resuscitation in the event of heart
failure. The doctors and the nurses
really seemed to care for Bill as a
person. They would lean down close
to Bill to speak to him and read his
lips in response. But these
professionals were overworked and
couldn't be with Bill as much as he
seemed to need them.
Diana took the last shift with Bill
before we left him on that Friday
nighf. His distress was constant. She
was running around trying to serve his
every need, getting the nurses'
attention, and asking for more
morphine. He should not be left in
pain. As we left he was sleeping,
Diana and I stood by his bed and said
goodbye as if we knew that this
would be the last time we would see
him.
Saturday, October 19
At 1:00 a.m. we got the call from
Dr. Goozner. Bill had died. The
immediate cause of death was heart
failure. He went peacefully.
For Bill AIDS did not mean the
difficult adjustment to life with
AIDS, the political struggle to
protect the rights of people with
AIDS, the threat of mass quarantine.
For Bill, his family and his friends,
AIDS meant death.

I will tell you a story of the end of one young man's all too
short life, his tragic and painful death. This story is about my big
brother, Bill Crosby, my partner in the world since birth and my
friend forever. Although Bill's story is. basically very sad, it is not
without hope.
Bill died of AIDS on October 19,1985. He was 27 years old.
Bill, an aspiring dancer/choreographer lived with his
roommate, Lori and his cat, Sushi in the East Village of New York
City. He worked two jobs waiting tables, took dance classes and
performed with a company. A graduate of New York University

ONE PERSON'S EXPERIENCE WITH AIDS

School of the Arts, his "breaks'

were starting to open up his dancing career. His life was
epitomized by the words: potential, possibility, hope.
Bill was gay and had been since he could remember. My
brother liked the good life and lived in the fast lane. According
to Lori, his good friend and confidante, Bill had a very active sex
life, too many partners to count including those he hardly knew.
Although he wanted to settle down with one man, he hadn't had
a long-term relationship for the last three or four years of his life.
Our family had a hard time understanding and accepting
Bill's homosexuality; but, to Bill his family's acceptance of his
gay lifestyle was of utmost importance to his own sense of
self-esteem, to his belief that he was a loved human being. We
all learned a lot from Bill's struggle to accept himself and forgive
those who couldn 't accept his sexual orientation.
Bill's life wasn't easy.
When AIDS became a public issue,
three or four years ago, Bill went into
a panic, as we all did. He read
everything he could on AIDS, its
causes, social ramifications, political
issues, potential cures, and safe sex
practices. Bill became an informed
man on the issue of AIDS. Whether
his knowledge came too late or
whether it was psychologically
necessary to deny the threat to his
life, we will never know. It seems we
have this conditional response to
tragedy: "This could never happen to
„ _ tf
me.
As though he knew his worst fear
would be confirmed by the results,
Bill never took the AIDS antibody
test. Whether or not I think Bill
should have taken the test is
irrelevant, the choice was not mine to
make. Receiving a positive result
would have changed his life
drastically, in a way he wasn't
prepared for. I'm not sure anyone is
prepared for their life sentence. On
the other hand, I wish Bill knew
how much he was loved and received
the support he needed.
There were many clues to Bill's
infection months before his public
diagnosis. These clues included night
sweats, chronic fatigue, weight loss
and long recovery periods from
illnesses. These clues weren't obvious
to Bill's friends and family—our
mindsets look for normal behavior
and logical explanations. For
example, Bill came down with a
bronchitis infection in August which
kept him in bed for almost a month.
We all nicely rationalized his slow
recovery by remembering when Bill's
roommate, Lori had had a similar
slow recovery from a virus the
summer before. Bill went to see his
doctor, Dr. Goozner, regularly and
Lori has found receipts for different
antibiotic prescriptions given to Bill
on a monthly basis. Still, no one close
to Bill was alarmed, either because
Bill didn't give the complete picture
of his symptoms, or because we didn't
know enough about AIDS.
October 2
Bill went to Dr. Goozner
complaining of a lingering cold and
shortness of breath. The doctor told
Bill to check himself into St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
immediately, without detour, for
some tests. Bill was told that he had
pneumonia and the test was a biopsy
which would tell him if he had
Pneumocystis carinii.
Thursday, October 3
Lori brought in his clothes and
some tapes as she was under the
assumption that Bill had pneumonia
and was in for some tests. She was
told that he would be in the hospital
over the weekend. I spoke with Bill
on the phone. He used an oxygen
mask to breathe but we carried on a
conversation for about 20 minutes. We
spoke about the possibility of an
AIDS diagnosis and how scary that
reality would be. He tried to
describe the happenings of the
previous two days and how it was
that he was in the hospital. Aside
from the fact that his breathing was
labored and his voice was muffled by
the oxygen mask, I would say it was
one of our more typical conversations.
I didn't expect that it would be our
last.
Friday, October 4
Bill had a biopsy, which was
physically very painful. His pain
was increased, however, after being
told by Dr. Goozner that he had
Pneumocystis carinii and full blown
AIDS. When Lori went to see him,
he told her that he had
Pneumocystis, but that he didn't
have AIDS. She believed him, not
knowing that otherwise very
healthy young men rarely come down
with Pneumocystis unless they have
a severely depressed immune
response. That day Bill did tell one
friend that he had AIDS and broke
down crying, unable to finish the
phone conversation.
Saturday, October 5
In the morning, I called Bill at his
hospital room but he was too weak
and in too much physical pain to
talk. I'm sure his emotional pain and
his heavy dose of denial prevented
him from making the effort. The
feeling of not knowing was
frustrating; and yet my own illusions
of hope wanted to believe he was
OK, that he wasn't going to die.
Sometimes the truth is just too
painful to face.
Sunday, October 6
Lori went to visit Bill only to find
his hospital bed empty. Afraid he
had died, she panicked and started
to cry. When she learned that he
was moved to the intensive care unit,
her relief was short-lived. She
couldn't stay long as her own
sympathetic reaction disabled her.
She couldn't breathe and she felt
faint every time she saw him in that
beeping, hissing, buzzing
atmosphere. She still believed what
Bill had told her the day before,
that he didn't have AIDS.
IVlonday, October 7
A tension filled day for my sister
Diana and I here on the west coast.
Having been unsuccessful at getting a
straight answer from Bill, my mother
made an appointment to speak with
Dr. Goozner. When I received the
phone call from Mom that Monday
evening, I became hysterical, my
brother was going to die of AIDS.
What do we do? Tm coming out," I
told her, "This is very serious and I
want to be with him." Mom was a
little more calm because the doctor
was anticipating that Bill would

pull through this bout of pneumonia
if he responded well to the
antibiotics. He has a young, healthy
body and he was diagnosed early,
the doctor told her.
Tuesday, October 8
Bill's prognosis didn't look so
optimistic. He was put on a
respirator and appeared to be in a lot
of pain. Lori didn't find out about
Bill's AIDS diagnosis until early
that Tuesday morning and her daily
visit to Bill was short and
distressing. \
Wednesday, October 9
My mother called us to report
that Bill was doing much better. He
seemed to be responding to the
antibiotics and seemed to be out of
the woods. Because he was still on
the respirator, he communicated on a
pad. He made jokes with Lori, sent
my mother and other brother on
errands for him and generally
appeared to be in higher spirits. The
doctor advised my parents to go away
for the weekend to rest. Bill was in
for the long haul, said Dr. Goozner.
That advice was the beginning of a
long and frustrating weekend for me.
My Mom had been my only connection
to Bill and now she was going to
Vermont. Being so far away, I was
convinced that Bill wasn't getting
the proper hospital care, that he
should be flown out to San Francisco
where the hospital care and the
social services are supposedly the
best.
I think somewhere in the back of
my mind I felt I could cure Bill. I
thought that my love for him could
pull him through this first bout and
nurse him until he came down with
the next illness doled out by his
suppressed immune system. This
false sense of personal healing power
and my critical attitude towards
everyone else's ability stemmed from
my own inability to accept his death.
I sought the counsel of another
Stanford grad, Patty Christen, who
works for the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation. She has a lot of
experience with friends dying of
AIDS and her main message to me
was "what are you waiting for?" Her
line of thinking really threw me for a
loop because I had been lulled into
the illusion of Bill's progress. I told
Patty that I thought Bill would need
me later, when he would try to put
his life back together. Patty knew
all to well that with AIDS victims
you can't depend on a later....
I spent the next two days in an
exasperating search for news on Bill's
progress. I could not get through to
the hospital. I was put on hold,
transferred, and disconnected all over

the place. I kept trying his room,
somehow believing that he would be
there, recovering beautifully.
IVlonday, October 14
I finally got through to intensive
care and talked with a nurse there.
She didn't say much, but the shock of
her information was disturbing.
Having thought that Bill was out of
the woods, I was surprised to find
that Bill was in the intensive care
unit. The nurse said the patient was
agitated, due to the repeated
attempts to take him off the
respirator over the weekend.
What was happening to my
brother? What was I still doing
here?
Tuesday, October 15
I got a call at my office. It was my
sister Diana who had just spoken
with Dad. "It doesn't look good
Annie. The doctor doesn't think he's
going to make it." Six hours and
many tears later Diana and I were on
People's Express to Newark hoping
that our brother hadn't died before
our arrival.
Wednesday, October 16
I was definitely unprepared for my
meeting with Bill. They had
performed a tracheotomy the day
before to make the respirator more
comfortable. He had tubes invading
his body pumping in fluids and air
and disposing of his waste. He was
white and sweating and his eyes
were filled with panic and pain.
Every breath was a struggle and his
convulsive coughs were silent except
for the hiss of the suction tubes as he
tried to work the fluids out of his
heavy lungs.
After 30 long seconds at his
bedside, I grabbed the nearest nurse
and asked her to escort me out of the
intensive care unit as I leaned
heavily on her arm. Little sister
Annie who was going to come save
the day almost passes out at the
sight of the brother she loves.
As I sat in the bathroom with my
head between my knees, the hard
reality struck me. Bill was going to
die. I could not pull him through no
matter how much I love him. We all
wanted to believe that this wasn't
really happening to Bill, that this
was all just a bad nightmare that
would disappear when we woke up.
