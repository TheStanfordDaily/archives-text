# The 						Other Epidemic

AIDS touches each of us... heterosexual, homosexual, man, woman, child.
The virus may not have entered our bodies — but fear has.
AIDS is a disease we are all afraid of, with good cause. It kills. There is
no cure currently. This raises anger and frustration. One irrational way of
dealing with these feelings is to focus on a group to blame, a group we can
distance ourselves from. Tragically, fear and anger become directed at those
primarily victimized by this fatal disease. Equally tragic, pointing the
finger - in fear, in anger, in jest, in self-righteousness - may reinforce the myth
that we do not need to protect ourselves and others we care about.
We can be afraid of disease, or disagree with a particular lifestyle. It is
unethical, however, to deal with people as if they were a disease. AIDS is
an issue in all of our lives. Displacing fear and frustration towards
individuals who are homosexual does not eliminate the disease. AIDS does
not assault us because of who we are. The virus does not discriminate, humans
do.
We ask that each member of the Stanford community examine his or her
emerging attitudes and the way these attitudes are expressed, overtly or
subtly. Our hope is that we all focus on what we have in common, rather
than our differences. This attitude will prevent fear from infecting us.
