# Can a Student With AIDS Continue at Stanford?
## 
### James W. Lyons 
I have been asked, "Can a
student continue at Stanford if he
or she contracts AIDS?" The
answer is, "Yes." Given the current
understanding of AIDS, there is
little likelihood that the
University would say to a student
that he or she cannot be here if the
student were suffering from AIDS.
Having said that, we also know
that students with AIDS often
decide themselves to leave fully or
partially; to not carry on their
studies, or to continue their studies,
but not to live in a campus setting.
There have been examples of
students having continued here
after having contracted a fatal
illness, and examples of students
having been graduated with a
terminal disease. The medical
staff, faculty, and deans have
always worked with the
individual situation — trying to
provide support, comfort, and an
academic load that the student can
handle, and living and other
amenities that make sense for the
student and his or her situation.
We won't change that approach in
the case of students with AIDS. To
the contrary, we will continue to
respond to each individual's

situation on its own terms.
"But AIDS is contagious; doesn't
having someone around with AIDS
put other students at risk?" Indeed
it is contagious — but only through
very specific and intimate sexual
contacts, sharing of needles
(intravenous injection of drugs),
and, less commonly, through
infected blood or its components.
There is simply no evidence that
the AIDS virus is transmitted
casually and through usual
day-to-day student contacts.
Nevertheless, roommates and
friends might have concerns about
their risk of contracting the
disease. These are matters that
the University health and support
staff will help students with AIDS
and others deal with and make
decisions about. The University
clearly does not wish to put other
students at risk. Yet we want to do
all that can reasonably be done to
make it possible for a student with
AIDS to continue his or her studies
for as long as he or she wants and
feels able to do so.
