# Risks for Gay People

-Although the issue of AIDS
concerns all of us, this article
addresses issues particlarly
relevant to the gay individual.
There is no question about the
profound impact that AIDS has
had on gay men and on the gay
community as a whole. This
epidemic has affected gay men in
far greater numbers than any other
single group in society. The reasons
for this relate to the particular
biology of the HIV virus, the
unique epidemiology of the disease
and sociological/behavioral
factors directly related to gay
sexuality.
The multiplicity of sexual
partners among urban gays,
accounts for the rapid spread of
the virus in gay centers across the
country, in Europe and Australia.
This phenomena is responsible for
the shift in gender distribution
from an infection that affects men
and women on a 1:1 ratio in Central
Africa (where it most likely
originated) to the 14:1 ratio in this
country.
The following facts provide an
ideal triad for transmission:
. the HIV virus exists in
semen in the highest
concentration of all body
fluids,
. direct contact with blood
is by far the most effective
mode of transmission, and
. minute capillary injuries
occur in the rectal
mucosa during anal
intercourse.
The vaginal mucosa, although
less fragile than the rectal, also
suffers minute injuries from friction
during intercourse. This explains
transmission among heterosexual
partners.
The clinical consequences of this
infection are extremely serious. At
this point, approximately 10 to
30% of those infected with the

virus will die in the next 8 years
from a profound suppression of
their immunological system.
For a gay man with AIDS facing
the probability of death is
preceded by psychologically
devastating losses: his job,
physical strength, body image,
social roles, independence,
economical resources, mental acuity
and even friends and family.
There is the added social stigma of
being identified as a member of a
group which has been
discriminated against, as well as
the stigma that accompanies both
promiscuity and venereal disease.
In this sense those close to someone
with AIDS are not only afraid of
being contaminated by a biological
agent but also afraid of "moral
contamination."

The paradox for gay
men is that something
which is a pleasurable
act is now associated
with a deadly outcome.

An emerging social concern
resulting from the spread of AIDS
is homophobia at two levels. The
first is the general societal
reinforcement of negative attitudes
about homosexuals. The second is
the incorporation of those
attitudes by gays themselves;
leading to old guilt feelings,
alienation, and self-hate.
As medicine has not yet
developed effective immunologic
prevention (a vaccine) and
effective treatment (a cure) the
only way to combat this epidemic
is with education. This basically
means a change in one's sexual
attitudes and practices. Foremost
are two actions:
. the universal use of
condoms arid
. the drastic reduction in
numbers of sexual
partners.
