# RISKS

### 
While condom use is not absolute
protection against the spread of
the virus, it is one of the safer
sexual practices. Universal use of
condoms means covering the penis
with a condom always, regardless
of the sexual act being performed
(fellatio, anal intercourse, mutual
masturbation, body rubbing, etc.).
Spermicides or contraceptive foam
are known to kill the HIV virus. It
makes sense then to use it for
lubrication purposes. Applying
foam inside the condom before
covering the penis with it would be
helpful in case of an unexpected
break in the condom
Dealing with the logistics of
condoms during the heat of passion,
particularly if you are not familiar
with them, can have the same
effect as a cold shower. Probably
the best thing to do is to become
thoroughly familiar with them:
buy some and test them out on your
own. Begin to eroticize their use so
that they can become part of your
repertoire of foreplay techniques
and behaviors. With the AIDS
epidemic, condoms have to become
an integral part of the sexual act
rather than a bothersome
hindrance. Developing more
sophisticated masturbatory
practices can become quite
important in these days of serious
sexual dangers.

Avoid sexual encounters
with people you do
not know. It is strongly
suggested that you
drastically reduce the
number of sexual partners
you do have and learn as
much as you can about
their health and sexual
history.

Exchange of saliva while kissing
remains controversial, yet most
experts agree that the likelihood
of transmission via this route is
small. However, considering the
stakes, you may want to reserve
intimate kissing for someone very
special, if at all.

Once a friendship is established
and becomes special, the
exploration of sexuality exists in a
context of trust and mutual caring,
undoubtedly a much safer and
enjoyable proposition.
Implementing the above
recommendations is not a simple
matter, but it is crucial. It entails
changing formed habits and this is
always difficult.
The levels of trust, knowledge
and communication with a
prospective sexual partner have to
be much greater than ever before.
For many this represents a loss of
the spontaneity, impulsivity and
mystery that made casual sex so
compelling to begin with.
This health conscious attitude
means taking the risk of talking
about sex before both partners have
expressed mutual desire. The risk
is experienced as vulnerability to
either premature rejection or being
perceived as presumptuous. But, is
it really such a big risk? The
advantage is increased respect
given to the values of conscien
tious ness, reponsibility, maturity
and assertiveness that such an
attitude conveys. This can surely
be a "turn-on" for your partner,
partner.
For those in the process of
"coming-out", AIDS poses a serious
dilemna. The reaffirmation of a
gay identity is not only based on
the individual's perception of his
or her capacity to love members of
one's own sex, but also, in the
actual experience of satisfying
sexual acts. Hopefully, the
eagerness to go through such
experiences will be matched by a
high degree of caution and good
judgement: in other words, the
strict observance of "safe sex"
practices. A homosexual lifestyle
is still a valid way of being in the
world.

It is very important for
gay men as well as for
all of us to maintain a
healthy distinction
between what is an
infectious agent leading
to a lethal illness in
any person and the
homosexual or bisexual
lifestyle.

The blurring of this distinction
leads to unnecessary fallout from a
disease which has enough tragedy
associated with it already.
