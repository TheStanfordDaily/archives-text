# Risks for Heterosexuals

### John Dorman, M. D 
(j iven the current level ot
knowledge about AIDS, what are
the risks to the heterosexual
population? The following is a
summary of important points to
consider for the heterosexual
population at Stanford.
Those whb are not sexually
active at all and do not use IV
drugs do not seem to be at any risk
at present, since the disease is not
transmitted by casual contact, and
blood transfusions are no longer a
risk.
There is no question that AIDS
can be transmitted by heterosexual
intercourse. In Africa there are as
many infected women as men.

Quite obviously, the
more partners you have,
the more you place
yourself at risk.
Multiple partners also
increase the risk of
other infections which can
suppress the immune
system.

Sexually active women may be
more likely to be infected than
heterosexual men, since the women
may be infected by bisexual men.
Heterosexual men would likely
only be infected by prostitutes who
are frequent IV drug abusers (50%
in New York City) and who may
have contact with bisexual men. In
the future, men may be more at risk
as the asymptomatic carrier rate
increases in women.

The Public Health Service
has recommended that
women with clinical,
epidemiologic, or sero
logic evidence of infection
with HTLV / LAV should
postpone or avoid preg
nancy to prevent trans
mission to the fetus or
newborn.

Keep in mind that there is long
(6 months to 7 years or more)
incubation period, so that you
really need to know your potential
partner's sexual practices over
the past seven years.
Condoms and contraceptive foam
seem to provide protection, but it is
probably not 100% certain. Anal
intercourse seems to be the highest
risk practice, perhaps because of
tissue injury. Tissue injury allows
semen to enter tears in the rectal
mucosa.
