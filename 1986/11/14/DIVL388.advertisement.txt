CM AT PREPARATION FOR JAN. EXAM
The Program's 11-meeting course for the Jan. 24 exam starts
November 15 and meets Wed. evenings and some Saturdays,
offering complete preparation in all verbal and quant aspects of
the GMAT. This course differs from the large programs: limited
enrollment, thorough review and homework tracking by the
instructor, and teaching by a former Stanford faculty member
who has trained students for the GMAT since 1979. Median
score in recent years: 680. The course fee is $350.
