IB Our location in the Pacific Northwest, near Seattle, is one of the most diverse in the country—an area H
I where quality of life is high and exciting. Mountains for skiing, hiking, and climbing are close enough H
H for day trips. Three spectacular national parks are within easy reach. The beautiful San Juan Islands H
II are yours to explore by sailboat or ferry, car or bike. Fishing? Only if you like salmon and steelhead. H
| But don't assume that Seattle people spend all their time outdoors. This is a young city, with a wealth H
H of cultural and recreational opportunities, from live theater, ballet, opera, symphony, to football, H
F | basketball and baseball. H
