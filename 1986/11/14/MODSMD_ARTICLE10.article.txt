# Task force: Liberalism hurt family
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — A presidential
task force, charging that the American
family has been harmed by "the
abrasive experiments of two liberal
decades," proposed yesterday that the
president consider major steps to
strengthen it.
The proposals — including a recom
mendation to increase the federal per
sonal tax exemption, currently $1,080,
to as much as $5,000 — were made in a
64-page report that is woven with con
servative rhetoric and blames the ero
sion of the family on liberal policies,
bureaucratic "rule-writers," the courts
and, in some cases, excessive welfare
benefits.
"The family has paid too much," said
Undersecretary of Education Gary
Bauer, who headed the task force. "It
has lost too much of its authority to
courts and rule-writers, too much of its
voice in education and social policy,

too much of its resources to public of
ficials at all levels."
The report contains familiar Reagan
administration themes — both in its
rhetorical stress on the need to
strengthen family structure in the face
of permissive social conditions and in
some of its specific proposals to
restructure public programs.
Many liberals have awaited the
report with skepticism, predicting that
it would urge retreat from program
gains, and some said yesterday that
their concerns had been justified. Sen.
Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said the
report is based on "plain ideology" in
blaming welfare and liberal programs
for the dissolution of the American
family and other problems, and is "less
a policy paper than a tantrum."
The task force proposals will be
reviewed by the White House Domes
tic Policy Council before being for

warded to President Reagan.
The report recommends — as a
means of discouraging "teen-agers
tempted to promiscuity" — that sub
sidized housing and basic cash-welfare
benefits, under the Aid to Families with
Dependent Children program (AFDC),
be denied to single mothers under 21
who leave their parents' home. Bauer
said, however, that some way would be
found to support the babies.
He said that one of his two most im
portant proposals is that a "family fair
ness statement" be written for all new
federal legislative and regulatory
proposals, indicating their impact on
the family.
The Bauer group, which worked on
its report for seven months, lauds the
traditional family: "Intact families are
good. Families who choose to have
children are making a desirable deci-

But Bauer said at a news conference
yesterday that the task force did not in
tend to denigrate working and single'
mothers, who he said "are doing a
heroic job under difficult circum
stances. There was no feeling ... that
was hostile to working women."
In tone, however, the report con- 1
veyed unhappiness with welfare pro
grams on the grounds that they
sometimes make it easier for teen
agers to become unwed mothers and
discourage the unemployed from fin
ding work. "At some point, the rising
welfare amounts actually result in
more poverty," the report said,
"including more child poverty, be
cause dependency becomes more at
tractive than labor and self
sufficiency."
