## Do students really agree with Dr. Ruth? 
### 
When Dr. Ruth Westheimer asserted Tuesday
that engaging in advanced sexual foreplay con
stitutes a commitment to have intercourse, Stan
ford students applauded. When she stated that one
partner could coerce a non-consenting partner to
engage in sex without the event being construed as
rape, students cheered.
The reaction to Dr. Ruch s outlandish statements
raises important questions about the sexual beliefs
and behavior of Stanford students.
Do many students here agree with Dr. Ruth that
somewhere between first and third base lies a
commitment to head for home?
Do students believe that it is OK in certain situa
tions to coerce others into having sex?
Are many students here guilty of forcing sex
through coercion?
I talked with about 20 students this week to de
termine whether the cheering audience is really a
good measure of student opinion.
I think it's not.
• Most students here — I would go so far as to say
90 percent — oppose Dr. Ruth's arguments that
foreplay is a commitment to intercourse and that
after foreplay, sex without consent is not date rape.
• Most students feel that Dr. Ruth's comments are

harmful because she perpetuates the myth that
everyone who engages in foreplay really wants to
have sex. Furthermore, many students feel that Dr.
Ruth is guilty of unfairly portraying women who
say "no" as teases.
• Students do note a positive side to Dr. Ruth's
presentation: Candid and controversial, she gels
people talking about important issues.
Judy David, coordinator of the Rape Education
Project at Stanford, noted the large number of stu
dents who cheered the "sex therapist at Tuesday
night's speech and, in an interview last night, asked
the question of the week: Why all the support for
Dr. Ruth?
David cites the "blame-the-victim" mentality as a
reason students may support Dr. Ruth's statements.
By disregarding the issue of consent, Dr. Ruth con
veniently assuages the guilt of the willing-and
eager partner and faults the non-consenting
partner instead.
I would argue that many of the students who
seemed to back Dr. Ruth actually disagree with
some of her more controversial statements. Stan
ford students seem to give speakers rousing ova
tions even when they do not agree with everything
the speakers preach. "Mindless cheering," one stu

dent called it. An elderly woman who screeches
the word "penis is especially likely to get a rise
out of a Stanford crowd.
That is not to say Dr. Ruth has no. supporters
here. One student 1 interviewed told me she
believes that women are clearly at fault if they try to
stop the sexual process after a certain point.
"Women should not lead men into thinking the\
will go all the way if they do not intend to," the stu
dent said. Plenty of male students at Stanford un
doubtedly share that opinion.
A final question: Is acquaintance rape —
meaning an act of intercourse forced against the
expressed will of one partner — a widespread
problem at Stanford?
The only fair answer is: Nobody knows.
I called Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer to
see whether any date rapes had been reported in
recent years.
Despite one case of sexual battery in a "date sit
uation" in April, there have been no confirmed
reports of acquaintance rape, assault or battery at
Stanford in the last few years, Niemeyer said.
But students here noted that date rapes nearly al
ways go unreported.
