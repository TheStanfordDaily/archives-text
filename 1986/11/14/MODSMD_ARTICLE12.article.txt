The dictum "Go West, young man
should be replaced b> "Look East," ac
cording to an expert on East Asian af
fairs.
Once known as backward, Asian
countries have developed rapidly since
the 19605, and the United States needs
to turn its attention to the Pacific Rim,
said Victor Hao Li, president of the
East-NX est Center in Honolulu and
former director of Stanford's Center
for East Asian Studies.
Focusing on current economic and
social developments, Li discussed the
"Future of the Asia/Pacific Region" to a
crowd of about 100 at Kresge
Auditorium yesterday.
Because Asia will play an increas
ingly significant role in the interna
tional community, the United States
should learn to recognize the prob
lems and the developments in that
region, he said.
While 12,000 to 13,000 Chinese
scholars come to the United States

every year to study the country's cul- '
ture and new developments, only a few *
hundred U.S. scholars go to China for
similar studies, according to Li.
Such cross-cultural study is particu- '
larly important because of the Pacific
Rim's rapid growth and interaction ,
with the United States. Li said. Trade '
between Asian countries and the
United States has increased tremen- '
dously in recent years, he said.
Industrialization accounts for much
of that trade, according to Li.
This rate of industrialization indi
cates that by the year 2000, Asian
countries will easily produce 25 per
cent of the world's goods, Li said.
Industrialization also brings prob-|
lems, he added.
With the rapid population growth
that is characteristic of Asian countries,'
natural resources are not going to last
forever. Obtaining the water and en-,
ergy necessary to accomodate tech-1
nological expansion and population'
increases will become a major issue, Li.
