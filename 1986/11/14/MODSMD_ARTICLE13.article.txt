# OPINIONS
## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Alter library focus 
### 
A regrettable aftereffect of major, controversial deci
sions is the continuation by dissatisfied parties of efforts
that no longer have any hopes of succeeding. The peti
tion drive, currently going on in the foothills, to change
the site of the Reagan Library is a case in point.
The petition criticizes trustee approval of the library
— to be constructed on a 20-acre plot in the foothills
west of Junipero Serra Boulevard and Lake Lagunita. The
petition suggests that the library be relocated at the inter
section of Interstate 280 and Sand Hill Road, near the
Stanford Linear Accelerator. Four-hundred signatures
were collected last weekend.
The two organizers of the petition, Dr. Sam Brain and
surgical resident Laura Esserman, both Stanford Hospital
employees, said in a letter that the petition seeks to
preserve "the beauty of campus."
At the Oct. 30 Faculty Senate meeting, Kennedy ruled
out moving the library. "That's not a possibility," he said.
The time to circulate petitions concerning the location
of the Reagan Library is long past. Certainly, a more ap
propriate time would have been before the trustees ac
cepted the library proposal in February 1985.

While the site of the library should be considered
fixed and unalterable, there still exist several questions
of architecture and purpose — questions on which
energies could be more effectively focused. And the fact
that 400 people signed a petition that has no chance of
effecting any change indicates that resources and efforts
are being wasted.
Kennedy told the senate Oct. 30 that changes in the ar
rangement of the building on the site, parking plans and
access from Junipero Serra still are "possible."
For example, Electrical Engineering Prof. Anthony
Siegman has vigorously criticized the proposed 350-400-
seat auditorium which is included in the design plans for
the library, saying that it would change the Reagan Li
brary into the Reagan Library' and Convention Center. In
addition, Political Science Prof. David Abernathy has ex
pressed concerns that the two-story portions of the
structure would mean the library would be visible on
campus.
Questions regarding the auditorium and architectural
design need to be addressed, and they are therefore
more pertinent and important issues to confront.
