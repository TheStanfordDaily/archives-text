Don't let money
affect Band's fate
I write this letter to express my
great dismay about the Stanford Band
not being scheduled to participate at
either UCLA or the Big Game.
Although I am sure I am not
aware of all (or possibly even most) of
the conflicts that have arisen between
the Band and the Athletic Department
or how offensive major financial
contributors to the Athletic Depart
ment might find some of the childish
antics of the Band, I am aware that the
football program provides a substan
tial share of the financial support for
all athletic programs at Stanford and
that it is important to keep it running
in a manner that produces good
revenues. Accordingly, it is undoubt
edly important to have the Band
activities coordinated with the overall
plans and design of the Athletic De
partment for football programs, as
well as to have these activities gener
ally within the outside limits of
decency.
Nonetheless, the football program,
the whole athletic program and the
Band are all parts of Stanford's pro
grams for the benefit of its students,
not for the benefit of alumni. Keeping
this in mind, I question whether
suspending the Band for both of the
remaining football games was done to
accomplish the legitimate goals of the
Athletic Department or whether they
were to punish those "leaders" (if
anyone can figure out who they are)
of the Band for their attitudes and
nonresponsiveness to the Athletic
Department.
Most of the general Band members
apparently had no belief that there
was any possibility of their incurring
sanctions such as those imposed.
Clearly a suspension from activities at
one game (the UCLA game) would
have gotten the attention of all the
Band members, resulting in their
being strongly motivated to straighten
out their act. Suspension from both
games seems to be without justifica
tion.
I regularly attend two or three
games at Stanford and attended the

Washington, USC and UCLA games this
year. I will be attending Big Game. I,
and all other alumni with whom I
have spoken, are in agreement that it
will be a great loss to attend these
(hopefully) most exciting games
without the presence of the Band. Of
course it would be nice if the Band
would act the way we adults think
they should; however, the athletic
program, like the Band activities, is
primarily for the students — not for
us. I strongly urge that there be a
reconsideration of the action and that
the Band be allowed to participate in
the Big Game, including being on the
field.

Band suspension
was long overdue
1 commend Athletic Director Andy
Geiger and his decision to suspend
the Stanford Band. This action is long
overdue. The Band has become an
embarrassment to Stanford University
and to those who support Stanford
football. Moreover, it has become an
annoyance and an irritant to the foot
ball team. Instead of helping during a
game, they have hindered. A good
example is the USC game. At that
game, the USC band played an impor
tant role in providing support and
encouragement to its team. It took
over the stadium and, together with
the USC rooters, set the emotional
tone as the game progressed. A Stan
ford team that was playing its heart
out at home deserved far more in the
way of support and encouragement
from the Stanford Band. In fact, it even
appeared that the Band by design was
refusing to play or cheer throughout
most of the game.
Thus, what is involved in this matter
is much more than conduct, it is also
attitude, school spirit and the support
of classmates who are representing
Stanford University on the playing
field.

Band needs to
mature musically
Think about it!
What is the real purpose in the
Band being at football games?
Yes, yes, it's to cheer on the team,
to get the students excited, to encour
age the fans. All these things go with
out saying, but the real purpose is to
support the team by playing music.
Anyone who has attended the home
games this year and has ever done so
in the past has been very disap
pointed.
Starting right in with San Jose State,
we knew there was a change. Always
in the past it was the SJSU fans who
tried to ruin Dr. Barnes' superb rendi
tion of the National Anthem. Who was
it this year? The Stanford fans, who
tried to sing along and go "swish" at
the end of every bar. OK, so that
wasn't the Band's fault? Maybe it was.
There should have been some pre
game coordination, especially since
school was not officially in session yet.
The band's performance went steadily
downhill for the next games. But the
final straw was the USC game.
From the moment it marched on
the field until long after the last play,
the USC band supported its team.
Right from the beginning, and even
when Stanford had the ball, the USC
band was in there playing (well), their
cheerleaders and pompon girls
yelling and performing with vim and
vigor every moment.
And what was LSJUMB doing? Apa
thetically sitting in the stands, baring
their chests and anything else possi
ble, catching the rays. Once in a while
they feebly played a bit, but with no
enthusiasm at all.
And to cap it all off, just before the
final gun, the USC band played the
finest rendition of "All Right Now"
that has been heard in Stanford
Stadium this year, complete with the
Big Jump. You would have thought
the two bands had changed places if
you weren't already sadly sure you
were wrong.
So, you say, what is my point?
It is certainly not to pan the Band. I

was among those who supported (in
writing) LSJUMB several years ago
when alumni criticized its antics. But
then, under the able baton of Simon
Streets, the Band played music. All
kinds of music, but strong, clear
music. They fooled around, too, but
no amount of tasteless "fun" could
counteract the fact that they were a
great band.
Now, nobody can tell me that the
current Band does not have just as
much potential as former Bands. I'd
like to challenge it to prove that state
ment. You've fallen down, just like
your pants this year, guys! Pick it all
up and get back to being mature
musically!

Farm tradition of
tolerance offended
I was shocked to read that Athletic
Director Andy Geiger has banned the
LSJUMB from performing at two Stan
ford football games and is
"evaluating" the likelihood of the
Band participating in future games.
Such an action, and the attitude that it
supports, seems arbitrary, unwar
ranted and unwise.
It is unclear why the Band was
banned. If it is because of the actions
of specific individuals, surely Geiger
could address himself to those indi
viduals alone. If what they have done
is illegal, perhaps the extensive police
force present at each game could
serve some useful purpose in either
preventing the specific actions or in
apprehending the people who per
petrate them.
If the action against the Band is
premised upon a personal dislike of
the Band's antics, or a belief that
Stanford needs a "new" Band, then
expressing such personal convictions
in official action is unprincipled and
extremely unwise, particularly in a
University setting. Under the protec
tion of the First Amendment, the Nazis
have been permitted to march in
Skokie. That may be expressive con
duct which we do not like or support,

but neither this University, nor the
City of Skokie, is free to ban it.
The issue, frankly, is not the Univer
sity's legal standing in taking this
action, but rather the principles it
offends and the message it sends to its
students. As an undergraduate here, I
saw Stanford as a place where stu
dents were exposed to, and experi
mented with, various ideas and values
and the ways in which those ideas and
values could be expressed in conduct.
An open environment is necessary for
that experimentation, and Stanford
has historically encouraged such an
environment; as a result many people
engage in activities and forms of
speech that are disagreeable to some,
but that we can all be proud Stanford
had the foresight (as well as perhaps
the legal responsibility) to allow.
Geiger's action in banning the Band
stands in opposition to that tradition
of toleration and suggests that Stan
ford's administration no longer con
siders an open atmosphere important
or necessary.
Yale faced a similar problem when
an undergraduate there posted a
satirical poster parodying
homosexuals on campus. Originally
placed on two year's probation, the
student appealed, and the University
reversed the penalty. Benno Schmidt,
Yale's president, noted that the deci
sion not to punish the student
"reflects the paramount value an
academic community should give to
freedom of expression, even to ex
pression that is distateful or silly." The
Band may be at times both distasteful
and silly, but why should Andy Geiger
decide for everyone who attends
football games what is worth being
seen and heard and what is not.
Where is Stanford's commitment to
the "paramount value" of freedom of
expression?
Even if I agree with the administra
tion's decision, the manner in which it
appears to have been made is very
troubling. Every student and student
organization on this campus has a
right — based on law, as well as
principle — to some form of due
process. What "procedure" was fol
lowed in this recent action? It cer
tainly allowed no opportunity for
public comment or for the Band to

invite public participation.
I encourage Andy Geiger to recon
sider his action banning the LSJUMB.
Even though one game has already
passed, it is important that this Univer
sity make clear that it is committed to
a broad policy of tolerating diverse
expression on campus, a policy which
reaches at least as far as the First
Amendment, but perhaps, given the
nature of the University, even farther.

Stanford Band
is for students
I think the Stanford Band is funny
and at times delightful; it offers
refreshing political and social com
mentary. The friends I know and work
with feel the same way. But even if I
agreed that the Band had gotten out of
line, there is no excuse for the way
this entire situation has been handled
by Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
I have been at every home game,
and I can say that no actions by the
Band offended or even were noticed
by those in the stands. Extremely
offensive, however, is the picture of
Stanford painted by descriptions of
"four letter words" and "urinating" on
the field. "Dumb" is also a four letter
word, and the press release given by
Geiger is certainly dumb.
I imagine that one day the Band will
do something to disappoint me. But
when that happens, I will have no
complaint. The Stanford Band belongs
to students. It is made up of students,
run by students and supported by
students.
I sincerely hope that this embarrass
ing situation will be resolved before
Big Game and that this resolution will
maintain an independent, student-run
band. Anything less will show the
entire nation that Stanford is not
enlightened, does not endorse free
thought and is not a very pleasant
place to attend.
