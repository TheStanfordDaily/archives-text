# Cartoon's 'humor' not so funny
## 
### 
Humor is a tricky thing. Many years back, I read a
column by humorist/newswriter John Keasler in
which he told a story which went something like this:
A tremendously opulent formal-dress ball is in
progress in an exquisite two-storied crystal ballroom
with lots of columns and chandeliers and mirrors
and a fabulous spiraling staircase that leads down to
the main dance floor. Suddenly, at the top of the
staircase, a man appears. He is larger than life: the
epitome of wealth and power and arrogance — the
proverbial fat cat. From his bearing, it is easy to see
that he considers himself to be the center of his own
and everyone else's universe, and his elevated nose
reflects his disdain for the other revellers around
him. He takes a step toward the stairs in order to des
cend to the lower level and grace it with his pres
ence, utterly failing to notice a small puddle of wine
that someone had earlier carelessly spilled on the

flcx>r. His alligator dress shoes hit the slick spot, and
he loses his balance and comes crashing down on his
be-tuxed and pompous ass. biting his tongue and
losing his toupee The crowd snickers. He tries to get
up but loses his balance again and begins to fall
down the staircase The crowd laughs He flails out
for support and grasps and rips the gown off of a
debutante who happened to be walking up the stairs,
but this does nothing to stop his helter-skelter
tumble do*n the steps An alligator shoe goes flying
through the air. The crowd is going wild. His belt
buckle breaks and his trousers slide down/up to his
ankles. He reaches the bottom of the steps and rolls
out on io the highly polished surface of the dance

floor and keeps sliding. He comes to a stop in front
of the band, and the crowd claps with delight. He
doesn't move. The crowd starts murmuring. Some
one notices that his neck is in a strange position.
Blood is trickling out of his mouth and onto the
floor, forming a little pool around his head. He is
quite dead. The question for the reader, then, is this:
At what point, if any, did this story cease to be
amusing and begin to become horrifying?
I repeat this story in response to a recent "The
Farm Side" cartoon (Daily, Nov. 3) It is a three-panel
tale in which, as near as I and all the people 1 have
asked can perceive, a disgruntled student picks up a
rifle and coldbloodedly murders the two noisy par
tiers in the next room and then, with a relieved and
happy expression, returns to his homework which
he can now presumably complete in peace. I find this
nothing short of horrifying and certainly not
humorous.
In all fairness, I am quite a fan of comics and car
toon art, and I fully understand that the essence of
much of the humor in comic strips stems from a re
action to unfortunate circumstances befalling a hap
less individual. Two of my favorite cartoonists, Gahan
Wilson and Gary Larson (writer of The Far Side,'
from which the Daily carnx)n perhaps derives its
name), frequently deal with the themes of violence,
death and sometimes even murder in a way in which
many people might find humorous (humor being a
very personal thing), but this is almost always due to
the total absurdity of the situation at hand (i.e., a per
son is swallowed by a giant guppy or a serial killer is
conking his victims with a Spam loaf, etc.). "The Farm
Side,' on the other hand, presents a perfectly realis
tic situation as a humorous scenario.
As a former resident assistant, I once had to deal

with a student who wanted to keep a rifle in his
room. One of my friends tells of a student at his un
dergraduate school who threw a Molotov cocktail
down his dormitory hallway and then shot and killed
the first two students who ran out. The Daily's
"humorous" cartoon bears an uncomfortable
resemblance to these (and other) very unfunny, real
life situations.
Humor, as I have said, is a very personal thing.
What one person finds hysterically funny, another
person may not understand at all. A cartoonist cer
tainly runs the risk of not having his or her entire
readership appreciate a joke upon which much
thought and effort was expended, and I understand
that. On the other hand, a cartoonist can sometimes
mistakenly cross over the boundaries between what
is weird and/or humorous and what is horrifying
and/or offensive. I feel that this should not go un
noticed. A cartoon with the prominence and expo
sure of "The Farm Side" to some degree or another
has a responsibility to its readers. To casually depict
an event which I and others to whom I have spoken
view as heinous and repulsive and pass it off as trivial
— or hold it up as comical — is a frightening misuse
of journalistic responsibility.
I d like to point out that the Daily's cart<x>nist has a
definite artistic talent and even, at times, a genuine
comedic wit His "The secret swap that ACTUALLY
took place" (Daniloff and the Cal Bear; Daily, Oct. 2),
for instance, is certainly a comic classic. I hope that in
the future, he will concentrate more on what is funny
or odd or silly in our lives on the Farm and not
stumble over the boundary between humor and hor
ror.

At what point, if any, did this story cease to be

I repeat this story in response to a recent "The
Farm Side" cartoon (Daily, Nov. 3) It is a three-panel
tale in which, as near as I and all the people 1 have
asked can perceive, a disgruntled student picks up a
rifle and coldbloodedly murders the two noisy par
tiers in the next room and then, with a relieved and
happy expression, returns to his homework which
he can now presumably complete in peace. I find this
nothing short of horrifying and certainly not
humorous.
In all fairness, I am quite a fan of comics and car
toon art, and I fully understand that the essence of
much of the humor in comic strips stems from a re
action to unfortunate circumstances befalling a hap
less individual. Two of my favorite cartoonists, Gahan
Wilson and Gary Larson (writer of The Far Side,'
from which the Daily carnx)n perhaps derives its
name), frequently deal with the themes of violence,
death and sometimes even murder in a way in which
many people might find humorous (humor being a
very personal thing), but this is almost always due to
the total absurdity of the situation at hand (i.e., a per
son is swallowed by a giant guppy or a serial killer is
conking his victims with a Spam loaf, etc.). "The Farm
Side,' on the other hand, presents a perfectly realis
tic situation as a humorous scenario.
As a former resident assistant, I once had to deal

with a student who wanted to keep a rifle in his
room. One of my friends tells of a student at his un
dergraduate school who threw a Molotov cocktail
down his dormitory hallway and then shot and killed
the first two students who ran out. The Daily's
"humorous" cartoon bears an uncomfortable
resemblance to these (and other) very unfunny, real
life situations.
Humor, as I have said, is a very personal thing.
What one person finds hysterically funny, another
person may not understand at all. A cartoonist cer
tainly runs the risk of not having his or her entire
readership appreciate a joke upon which much
thought and effort was expended, and I understand
that. On the other hand, a cartoonist can sometimes
mistakenly cross over the boundaries between what
is weird and/or humorous and what is horrifying
and/or offensive. I feel that this should not go un
noticed. A cartoon with the prominence and expo
sure of "The Farm Side" to some degree or another
has a responsibility to its readers. To casually depict
an event which I and others to whom I have spoken
view as heinous and repulsive and pass it off as trivial
— or hold it up as comical — is a frightening misuse
of journalistic responsibility.
I d like to point out that the Daily's cart<x>nist has a
definite artistic talent and even, at times, a genuine
comedic wit His "The secret swap that ACTUALLY
took place" (Daniloff and the Cal Bear; Daily, Oct. 2),
for instance, is certainly a comic classic. I hope that in
the future, he will concentrate more on what is funny
or odd or silly in our lives on the Farm and not
stumble over the boundary between humor and hor
ror.

Humor is a tricky thing. Many years back, I read a
column by humorist/newswriter John Keasler in
which he told a story which went something like this:
A tremendously opulent formal-dress ball is in
progress in an exquisite two-storied crystal ballroom
with lots of columns and chandeliers and mirrors
and a fabulous spiraling staircase that leads down to
the main dance floor. Suddenly, at the top of the
staircase, a man appears. He is larger than life: the
epitome of wealth and power and arrogance — the
proverbial fat cat. From his bearing, it is easy to see
that he considers himself to be the center of his own
and everyone else's universe, and his elevated nose
reflects his disdain for the other revellers around
him. He takes a step toward the stairs in order to des
cend to the lower level and grace it with his pres
ence, utterly failing to notice a small puddle of wine
