# Rally still on, march maybe

### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
Although Stanford football fans probably won't be march
ing down Fisherman's Wharf, a Big Game Rally will be held
in Aquatic Park next Friday night, according to Axe Commit
tee Chairman Michael Tuchin.
The committee already has a commitment for the
$500,000 of liability insurance required by Aquatic Park offi
cials for a rally.
There is an approximately 15 percent chance that the Axe
Committee will be able to obtain the additional $500,000
worth of insurance necessary to hold the march down Fish
erman's Wharf to Aquatic Park, according to Tuchin.
The City of San Francisco requires groups holding
marches or parades to carry at least $1 million in liability
coverage. Attempts by Tuchin to convince the city to reduce
the insurance requirement were unsuccessful. The San
Francisco Police Department agreed to lower the require
ment, but the Port Authority refused, Tuchin said.
Aquatic Park is federal property and thus not subject to
the same regulations as the parade route.
Only one insurance company has not yet refused to pro
vide coverage for the march, according to Terri Tanner of
Marsh and McLennan, the Axe Committee's insurance bro
ker. She said she hopes to hear from that company today,
but added she has "no idea" whether or not the company
will agree to insure the march down the wharf.
Her other attempts yesterday to secure the additional
$500,000 of coverage "didn't work," Tanner said.
The Axe Committee will make a final announcement on
the fate of the march by Monday morning, Tuchin said.
If the additional insurance is not obtained, dorms will
have their buses drop them off on Friday at Aquatic Park in
stead of near Pier 1, according to Tuchin. In lieu of the
march, the Stanford Band will play longer at the park, he
added.
The original Rally plan called for the Band to lead stu
ticitw,Â«>.M.-twvcjmW ade from Pier 1 to Aquatic Park.
Tuchin said he doesn't think the Rally will be any less en
joyable if the march can't take place. "The main reasons
people come to the Rally are to get off campus into San
Francisco and to hear the Band play."
A fireworks display will still be staged as planned at
Aquatic Park, Tuchin added. He said the fireworks will be
set off around 11 p.m. The Rally is scheduled to begin at
10:15 p.m. and end shortly after midnight.
In addition to obtaining $500,000 of liability insurance,
the Axe Committee must post a $5,000 bond in order to
hold the Rally in Aquatic Park, Tuchin said. The bond is re
quired to guarantee the cleanliness of the park after the
Rally.
According to Tuchin, there has never been a problem ob
taining permission to hold the Rally in Aquatic Park. "For
the past few years (park officials) have always been ex-
tremely pleasant," he said. "They
tell us what they need, and we are
willing to comply."
Tanner declined to reveal the name
of the insurance company that agreed
to provide coverage for the Aquatic
Park Rally because the policy has not
yet been formally signed. The policy is
secure, and completion is only a mat
ter of finishing the necessary paper
work, she said.
"There is no problem with the insur
ance," Tuchin said.
