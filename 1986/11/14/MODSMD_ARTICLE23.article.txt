## Money in the bank for Stanfordites 
### ALEX ANASTASOPOULOS 
It you were to choose between a
regular savings account that earns in
terest at a rate that is subject to daily
change and one that earns 5 percent
interest for an unknown period of
time, which one would you choose?
Would it help if you were told that in
the first account you would pay $3
every time your quarterly average bal
ance fell below $500 and in the second
$1.50 every time your monthly average
balance fell below $200?
The choice of a bank on the basis of
such information alone can be a diffi
cult one. It's hard to distinguish the
most profitable combination of rates
and service charges.
That's when factors like distance to
the nearest branch come into consid
eration.
On the Stanford campus, the Wells
Fargo people believe they have an
edge in that regard.
"I believe we have more Stanford
student accounts than any other bank,"
said Karen Moore, the supervisor of
the Wells Fargo campus office. "We
have a branch on campus, and we've
been around the longest."
A Bank of America customer repre
sentative at the Stanford Shopping

Center branch said Bank of America
has a fair number of Stanford student
accounts, not necessarily less than
Wells Fargo."
Both Wells Fargo and Bank of
America declined to release any fig
ures about the number of student
acounts they hold.
Most people dealing with Wells
Fargo know that the campus office is a
"limited service branch." The services
offered are opening and closing
deposit accounts, express stop deposit
and withdrawal, applications for loans
and traveler's checks, bookkeeping
information by telephone, teller
services via two walk-up windows and
merchant services.
Requests for any other services (e.g.,
cashier's checks, money orders,
foreign exchange and cash advances)
are referred to the the bank's Old Stan
ford Barn branch.
What many people don't know,
however, is that there were no banking
services available on campus prior to
1972, when Wells Fargo first moved
into Tresidder Union. It was the only
bank that showed an interest in
opening a campus office at that time,
according to Paul Szczesiul, assistant
director of Tresidder Memorial Union.
From then until 1984, Wells Fargo

operated a full-service branch that oc
cupied the whole northern wing of
Tresidder, which includes the location
of the present branch and the Cypress
and Sequoia lounges.
In 1984, the first term of Wells
Fargo's lease at Tresidder ended. It so
happened that 1984 was also the year
of deregulation in the banking busi
ness. Banks, including Wells Fargo,
started trimming their operations in
order to become more competitive,
said Szczesiul.
Szczesiul said Wells Fargo was
skeptical about renewing its lease.
Months of negotiation resulted in a
decision to convert the Tresidder
branch from full- to limited-service
operations. The branch's office space
was cut by nearly two-thirds, but a
third automated teller machine (ATM)
was added.
At the same time, Bank of America
and the Federal Credit Union installed
their own ATMs. During the first term
of Wells Fargo's lease no other bank
was allowed to install an ATM.
"We had been pushing for an ATM a
long time, and we finally got it," said a
Bank of America customer representa
tive.
People have different opinions on
the quality of the services that the
Wells Fargo campus branch offers.
Sophomore Russ Garber said he was
satisfied by the services. Sophomore
Alice Hurley, on the other hand, said:
"The tellers are incompetent; they
make you wait in line."
Szczesiul said the Wells Fargo

managers are very responsive to
remarks made by Tresidder, a depart
ment of the Dean of Student Affairs of
fice. A survey in 1982 showed that the
three banks now at Tresidder are the
ones that "provide the range of finan
cial services which best serves the stu
dent community," Szczesiul said.
Moore said the recent change in
Wells Fargo's campus branch schedule
was not a result of student input. "It
was handed down from the manage
ment," he said.
The bank's new hours are 9 a.m. to 4
p.m., Monday through Friday. Moore
said no special arrangement is made
for days that are expected to be busy,
like paycheck days, or for noontime.
In the future, Szczesiul expects that
people with accounts at different banks
will be able to use the same ATM.
"The hardware is there and is being
used in other states," he said. Wells
Fargo is considering installing a fourth
ATM, and Bank of America may expand
its ATM to 24-hour service like that
already offered with the Wells Fargo
and Credit Union ATMs. Currently, the
Bank of America ATM is closed from
midnight until 6 a.m. daily.
Many people feel the services of
fered on campus would be better if
there were a second bank branch on
campus. Szczesiul, however, said that
space limitations allow for only one
branch at a time to be located in
Tresidder. He added that the student
community business involves high
transactions and low profits and thus
does not attract many banks.

Soon, money may come easier to Stanford students who do their banking on
campus, as both Bank of America and Wells Fargo plan improvements in
their automatic teller machine service.
