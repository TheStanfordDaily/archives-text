## Stanford program's reel story 
### CHIP CATALANO 
You re watching a film, the credits roll, and before the
lights go up, you see on the screen: "Produced in the Depart
ment of Communication, Stanford University." This throws
you for a loop you ve heard rumors about the existence
of the Communication Department, but what's this
produced in stuff? Who produced the movie, and where?
Actually, its probably a documentary, a documentary film
produced by someone enrolled in Stanford's Documentary
Film masters program. Deep within the Communications
Department, master of arts degrees are awarded in the field
of documentary film production.
Its one of Stanford's best-kept secrets," says Nancy
Brink, a third-year student in the program. She has a point.
Stanford's program, which holds only 10 to 12 students a
year, is a distinguished training ground for documentary
filmmakers.
Numerous film awards garnered by Stanford students at
test to the program s quality. In three of the last four years,
Stanford projects have won the Student Award for Best Doc
umentary given by the Academy of Motion Picture Art and
Sciences. Master s projects completed at Stanford have also
appeared nationally on the Public Broadcasting Service and
the Showtime cable network. They have appeared and

received numerous awards at film festivals all over the
country from Palo Alto to Chicago.
New York's Museum of Modern Art selected for screening
in its New Directors Film Series a film by 1985 Stanford
graduate Lauren Lazin. This year, Lazin's "The Flapper
Story," about the high-society girls of the 19205, also won
the prestigious Nissan Focus Award for Best Documentary,
for which she received a new car.
If you've happened to see David Lynch's film Blue Vel
vet," then your ears have experienced tjie handiwork of
three Stanford film program graduates. If you plan to see
the film in the future, check the credits for dialogue editors
John Nutt and Michael Silvers and also sound editor Rob
Fructman, all of whom earned their master's film degrees
here at Stanford.
On public television you may have seen the work of one
of Stanford's most prominent graduates, Jon Else. He
produced and directed the PBS documentary "The Day After
Trinity," about Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, which received an
Academy Award nomination. Early next year, another of
Else's projects will premiere on television, a new series
about civil rights which he both produced and filmed.

Stanford's graduate film students often help out on each other's films. Working on Jay Clements' film "Man, Oh
Man" above are (1-r): Assistant cameraman Rich McKay, cinematographer Kincaid Jones, director Clements and
sound recordist Chris Norte.
Stanford program, has the unusual habit of reading televi
sion credits in the hope of spotting the names of former stu
dents. Recently he had the pleasant surprise of seeing a
tamiliar name, Bonnie Koehler, under the film editing
credit in the premiere episode of the television series "L A.
Law. Breitrose sent Koehler a letter congratulating her on
her impressive work, ending with the words,"Few things
make a professor happier than a successful and talented
alumnae."
Probably no one appreciates the long evolution of Stan
ford's film program more than Breitrose, as he helped
create the program. He said that in 1960 he came here to
teach film in the Department of Speech and Drama. Then, in
1965, he was heavily involved in forming a Department of
Communication which would take over, as part of its re
sponsibilities, the television and film program then undej
the Speech and Drama Department. In addition to Docu
mentary Film Production, the Department of Communica
tion currently has graduate programs in the fields of jour
nalism and applied communication research.
The other two professors now teaching in the film pro
gram arrived after Breitrose. Ron Alexander, who teaches
mostly the technical end of film production, came to Stan
ford in 1970. He is joined by Kris Samelson, a one-time stu
dent of Alexander's who received her master's in communi
cations from Stanford in 1973. In her fourth year of teaching
here, Samelson specializes in screenwriting and directing.
Breitrose, for his part, is not involved with instruction on
the production level but instead teaches complimentary

courses in film aesthetics, history and criticism.
Many film students consider the small number of faculty
members and the resulting reduced size of the program two
of the program's greatest assets. According to Alexander, a
small program allows for "personal relationships and inter
action between faculty and students," giv ing a cohesiveness
that might be lost in a larger program with more faculty.
Alexander says he and Samelson have tried to combine
their teaching efforts into a "seamless" course of instruction
which makes the most of Alexander's technical expertise
and Samelson's unique creative abilities.
Although Alexander modestly claims that "the students
are the film program," one should take note of the qualifica
tions the other faculty members bring to the program. Best
known for his work with the Film Board of Canada, Alexan
der received the Canadian Film Award for Excellence in Re-
Recording (Canada's equivalent of the Oscar) for three con
secutive years prior to coming to Stanford. Samelson, mean
while, has worked as post-production sound coordinator
for "The Black Stallion," and served as co-producer and
writer of "Silver Feet," an award-winning documentary
about three young dancers entering the ballet profession.
Other factors exist, though, besides a talented and dedi
cated faculty to explain the success of the Stanford film pro
gram. Breitrose points out that there is an "enormous
amount of emphasis placed on professionalism and quality"
within the program. The words that will simply not be
tolerated are: "Don't worry, no one will notice." Alexander
adds that the words "That's good enough" shouldn't even
appear in a Stanford film student's vocabulary. The goal isn't
perfection, just an attitude of devotion to the pursuit of ex
cellence, says Alexander.
Sounds like a philosophy that should be common sense
in any endeavor. But it's especially important in the film

program, says Brietrose, because the field in the real world
is highly competitive. "In a field like film, the work that you
do partially defines who you are.' And, he adds, in the film
business "reputation is everything." Samelson concurs,
saying, "It takes a very thick skin and a lot of persistence to
make it in the film business."
The Stanford graduate program consists of a year of for
mal course instruction, in which students make various
short films, followed by up to five vears in which students

'It's one of Stanford's best
kept secrets.'

must complete independent film projects. This is usually a
longer, color and sound film shot in the 16 millimeter for
mat. The focus of Stanford's instruction is on documentary
or non-fiction films, and most projects are of that type.
Samelson points out, though, that good documentary films
and good fiction films share a lot in common. Both have in
teresting characters and a good story to tell â€” one just hap
pens to be true," she says.
The goal of the final project is for students to bring to
gether all of the broad, general skills taught in courses. Stu
dent Wynn Hausser, '86, acted as producer, director and
editor on his film "Sanctuary: A Question of Conscience."
While making the film, Hausser learned the skills that aren't
covered in technical courses, such as dealing with financial
problems. He estimates the final cost of his film to be some
where around $40,000, none of which is covered by Univer
sity funds.
"You've got to be able to get money for your project. It's
the most difficult thing students face," says student Nancy
Brink. Her film titled "No Hunger in America," about starva
tion in the United States and the Ecumenical Hunger Pro
gram in East Palo Alto, is still in the fundraising process. She
hopes to gain financial support by using the small amount of

footage already shot to interest possible contributors.
Faculty and students alike agree that it would be nice nut
to have to worn, about money. But they also agree that it is a
unique pan of the learning process which prepares students
well for when they are off on their own. Still, no one enjoys
being in debt, a common dilemma facing students scram
bling to complete their films. It's not unusual to see a stu
dent's personal savings suddenly evaporate in the face ot
his growing production budget, students say.
The students' options in the search for funds are limited
to their own resourcefulness and to various foundation
grants, private contributions or other donations. Loyal
alumni to the program occasionally provide assistance, as
sound designer Kent Gibson did. A mid-19"0s graduate, he
recently arranged for the donation of $2,000 worth ot sound
post-production work tor the film "Living NX'ith AIDS, by
Tina DiFeliciantonio.
The wide range of subjects covered in Stanford films is
one of the program's most impressive characteristics, top
ics such as DNA, rape, the elderly, the Stanford tennis team,
earthquakes and Amelia Earhart have all been featured in
graduate film projects. But the program suffers when money
restrictions force students to compromise on their choices
of subjects for their final projects. In addition, money prob
lems have also influenced students to shoot in video instead
of film, because video is less expensive.
It might seem as if the filmmaking process is an extremely
frustrating one. Certainly the students might occasionally
wonder about the value of all their efforts. Following the
West Coast premiere of his "Sanctuary' master's film, Haus
ser told the audience, "You just saw the last two years ot my
life whittled down to about 26 minutes."
But the students mange to overcome whatever problems
they run into. A big reason for this is the tight camaraderie
in the program, the cooperation of the students with each
other's projects. Says Samelson, "Its not possible to go
through this program and be detached. You just can't."
Ultimately Stanford film students all face the same final
challenge. As the recently graduated Hausser puts it. The
secret now is to see if I can get someone to pay me to do the
thing I love to do."
