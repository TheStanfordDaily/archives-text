## Stanford program's reel story 
### CHIP CATALANO 
You re watching a film, the credits roll, and before the
lights go up, you see on the screen: "Produced in the Depart
ment of Communication, Stanford University." This throws
you for a loop you ve heard rumors about the existence
of the Communication Department, but what's this
produced in stuff? Who produced the movie, and where?
Actually, its probably a documentary, a documentary film
produced by someone enrolled in Stanford's Documentary
Film masters program. Deep within the Communications
Department, master of arts degrees are awarded in the field
of documentary film production.
Its one of Stanford's best-kept secrets," says Nancy
Brink, a third-year student in the program. She has a point.
Stanford's program, which holds only 10 to 12 students a
year, is a distinguished training ground for documentary
filmmakers.
Numerous film awards garnered by Stanford students at
test to the program s quality. In three of the last four years,
Stanford projects have won the Student Award for Best Doc
umentary given by the Academy of Motion Picture Art and
Sciences. Master s projects completed at Stanford have also
appeared nationally on the Public Broadcasting Service and
the Showtime cable network. They have appeared and

received numerous awards at film festivals all over the
country from Palo Alto to Chicago.
New York's Museum of Modern Art selected for screening
in its New Directors Film Series a film by 1985 Stanford
graduate Lauren Lazin. This year, Lazin's "The Flapper
Story," about the high-society girls of the 19205, also won
the prestigious Nissan Focus Award for Best Documentary,
for which she received a new car.
If you've happened to see David Lynch's film Blue Vel
vet," then your ears have experienced tjie handiwork of
three Stanford film program graduates. If you plan to see
the film in the future, check the credits for dialogue editors
John Nutt and Michael Silvers and also sound editor Rob
Fructman, all of whom earned their master's film degrees
here at Stanford.
On public television you may have seen the work of one
of Stanford's most prominent graduates, Jon Else. He
produced and directed the PBS documentary "The Day After
Trinity," about Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, which received an
Academy Award nomination. Early next year, another of
Else's projects will premiere on television, a new series
about civil rights which he both produced and filmed.
