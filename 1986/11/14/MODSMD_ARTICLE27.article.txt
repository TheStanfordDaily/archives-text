# Festival shows best in animation

### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Most of us can probably remember
the Saturday mornings of our youth,
when we sat spellbound in the glow of
the cathode ray tube, mesmerized by
the antics of our favorite cartoon char
acters. That's probably a hyperbolic
way of describing Saturday morning
cartoons, but, by golly, I miss watching
them.
It was with great disappointment
that I realized my favorite animated
characters weren't going to get any
older: While I engaged in a death-grip
with acne over control of my face, the
Pink Panther continued along with the
same spotless complexion of old. In
short, despite a lingering fascination
with Woody Woodpeckers hairstyle, I
just couldn't identify with cartoon char
acters any more. We came to a sad but
inevitable parting of the ways.
Since then, cartoons seem to have
gotten much dumber. The classics of
old have been supplanted by an idiotic
new breed of animated heroes. Badly
drawn dreck like "Go-Bots" and
"Transformers" litters our screens.
These shoddy new efforts give the

entire field of animation a bad name.
Enter the Festival of Animation
playing at the New Varsity Theatre in
Palo Alto this weekend, out to prove
that animated films (please, let's not
just call them cartoons) can be witty,
imaginative and wonderfully drawn.
And, oh yes, incredibly entertaining.
The 16 shorts being shown in the fes
tival represent more humor and
cleverness than anything else you're
likely to see this year.
"Animation deserves a lot more than
it gets," says Jim Terry, one of the fes
tival's producers and promoters. Along
with the the festival's original produc
ers, Mike Gribble and Spike Decker,
Terry spends each June through Au
gust looking at new animated films
both here and abroad, lining up new
material to run in the festival.
The festival is highly recommended
to everyone. Weird images stick in
your mind after seeing the films: the
way a saber-tooth tiger beams a tcx>thy
grin to the screen, how letters of the al
phabet attack a man and flirt with his
wife. Now that's not something you see
everyday, is it? Check out the Festival of
Animation and see for yourself.
