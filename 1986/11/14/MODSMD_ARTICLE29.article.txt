The Big Chill (1983)
Memorial Auditorium, Bechtel Interna
tional Center
Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan
searched the soul of his generation to find
out how he and his fellow children of the
'60s were getting along in the '80s; it
turned out they were being childish, nar
cissistic, self-righteous jerks. The subtext
of this celebration of friendship is that the
cold, scary world is hardly worth bother
ing with, so find a small group of people
who think like you do and bury yourself in
it. The movie itself emblemizes the small
mindedness and pretension that went into
its making: It sports its good taste in music
and hot young cast as signs of hipness and
distinction. Millions upon millions of
moviegoers bought into this view of them
selves; Kasdan makes it easy for them by
structuring his scenes to those great songs
on the soundtrack and putting one per
sonable young actor after another in the
spotlight, among them Jeff Goldblum,
William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Glenn Close,
Mary Kay Place, Tom Berenger, Jobeth
Williams and Meg Tilly.
Plays in Mem Aud Sunday at 7 and 9:30
p.m. and at the I-Center Sunday at 8 p.m.

Rumblefish (1983)
Cubberley Auditorium
All of Francis Ford Coppola's film ver
sion of an adolescent novel by S.E. Hinton
looks like the dream clouds in"The Ele
phant Man" — we never get to wake up in
this movie. Stephen Burum laid his black
and white photography on with a trowel:

It's so film noir that the Xanadu scenes in
"Citizen Kane" look naturalistic in com
parison. Steam erupts from every corner,
street signs seem to float in space, and the
camera looms so close to faces that they
distort and age. This must be one of the
craziest movies ever made commercially
in this country. You'd never guess that
Coppola was trying to make a picture
about anything as accessible as frustrated
teenagers or restless young nomads; he's
so in love with his own dumb metaphors
and his own amazing technical skills that
they take over the film. The large cast is
full of talent, but Coppola lets them act
and act, never imposing any controls, until
finally they become excessive, narcissistic.
With Mickey Rourke, Matt Dillon, Diane
Lane, Nicolas Cage, Vincent Spano and —
giving the blue ribbon dreadful perfor
mances — Diana Scarwid and Dennis
Hopper.
Plays Tuesday at 8 p.m.

Children of a Lesser God
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Mark MedofFs award-winning play is a
melodramatic love story posing as a social
problem drama; the same is true of the
movie version, except that the movie jerks
tears with even more of a vengeance. And
it's effective as hell; you'll find yourself
genuinely moved, not by the writing or
Randa Haines' barely serviceable direc
tion, but by the intensely emotional, pull
out-all-the-stops performances of William
Hurt and Marlee Matlin. Hurt, as a young,
ambitious teacher at a school for the deaf,

and Matlin, as the emotionally wounded
ex-student he falls in love with, are the
movie; there's nothing else worth watch
ing, or thinking about. Working together,
they transcend the sodden material.

Crocodile Dundee
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
A good-natured but drab and klutzy
comedy, featuring this year's Aussie, Paul
Hogan. Hogan stars as Dundee, a sort of
Natty Bumppo of the outback, who's lured
back to civilization (or at least New York)
by a busybody reporter (Linda Kozlowski,
in her first movie). As you might expect,
the Croc teaches the city slickers a thing or
two, as well as winning the girl, earning
the respect of various cynical urbanites,
and scoring many points for natural cour
tesy and basic human dignity. Hogan cer
tainly has charm, but he spends much of
the movie looking embarrassed by the
tired old jokes and stock comic situations
he has to wade through; he shouldn't be,
since he wrote the script himself.
— M.H.
My American Cousin
Guild, Menlo Park
Another entry in the "Gee, wasn't it
great to be a kid in the '50s" nostalgia
sweepstakes. This one offers Margaret
Langrick's self-assurance as a rebellious
12-year-old Canadian girl enamored of
her visiting American cousin, Butch (John
Wildman as a bargain basement James
Dean), and the beautiful Okanagan Valle>
in British Columbia as background, bui

otherwise suffers from community
theater-level acting, a run-of-the-mill story
and dialogue that's equal parts "Rebel
Without a Cause" and "Where the Boys
Are."
— MH
Stand By Me
Century 10, Mountain View
The sort of coming-of-age movie in
which the kids (in this case, four 11- and
12-year-old boys) are impossibly bright,
resourceful and supportive of each other;
adults don't exist, except as evil
caricatures; and every frame is supposed
to give off a golden glow. Rob Reiner di
rected this adaptation of a Stephen King
novella, in which the four boys (one of
them a born storyteller) take a symbolic
walk through the woods to see the dead
body of another boy their age. King and
Reiner combine to give us a sentimental
idyll of American childhood that doesn't
have any imagination to make up for its
syrup. It's all very tender and charming,
and completely false; only two scenes —
one in which the four flee across a rail
road bridge ahead of a train, and another
in which they walk along singing the
Chordettes' "Lollipop" — have any life to
them.
— MH
Round Midnight
Itjou, Palo Alto
This movie has plenty of jazz, but not
much soul. The great bebop sax man Dex
ter Gordon plays Dale Turner, an Ameri
can jazz man living in Paris in the '60s and

slowly killing himself with booze; he is
befriended by Francis, a young French
commercial artist (Francois Cluzet). who
gets him off the juice and back in the
studio. In addition to Gordon, the cast in
cludes musicians Bobby Hutcherson.
Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Freddie Hub
bard, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hanctxrk
and singer Lonette McKee. Vie see and
hear a lot of jazz played, including a mix of
standards and Hancock sand Gordon s
own compositions. But director and co
writer Bertrand Tavernier doesn't bring
the music, and the passion these men and
women feel for it, to life. Tavernier's rela
tionship to his material resembles that of
Francis to the jazzmen he idolizes: We first
see the character huddled in the rain
outside a Paris club, listening to Turner
through a grate in the wall. Gordon has
tremendous dignity and presence, and the
scenes showing the friendship between
Turner, Francis and Francis's daughter
Berangere (Christine Pascal) are very
touching; this seems to be the only part of
the movie Tavernier had any feel for.
— MH
The Gospel According to Vic
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Another small Scottish comedy. Tom
Conti is Vic, a non-believing Catholic
school teacher in Glasgow; when what
may be miracles start happening around
him, he undergoes crises both spiritual
and practical. Conti exhibits lots of frumpy
charm, and Helen Mirren lends her con
siderable talents as a fellow teacher at the
Blessed Edith Semple School. The movie
doesn't go very deep in its examination of
faith in the media age, settling instead for
quiet humor and a certain threadbare
charm, as with other Scottish films, "Vic"
is understated to the point of nonexis
tence. With Gordon Jackson of "Upstairs,
Downstairs" fame in a cameo.
— AI.H.
Peggy Sue Got Married
Century 10, Mountain View
Kathleen Turner does her best to keep
Francis Ford Coppola's time travel
daydream afloat, but she doesn't get any
help. Coppola doesn't seem concerned
with making any sense out of the story or
giving us a stake in the characters; he gives
us lots of nifty '50s nostalgia, milks easy
laughs out of the '50s/'Bos time disjunc
tion, and leaves it at that. Turner's Peggy
Sue passes out at her 25th high school
reunion and wakes up back in high
school; rather than exploring the possibil
ities for irony and naughty fun inherent in
the situation, the movie goes gooey and
Peggy Sue moons over all the people she
didn't appreciate enough at the time. We
can see Turner, a great natural com
edienne, straining to bring some life to
her milksop character; even worse off is
Nicholas Cage, who is hopelessly lost as
her husband/boyfriend Charlie.
— M.H.
The Color of Money
Century 10, Mountain View
"The Color of Money" is a great sports
movie, which, given the director (Martin
Scorsese) and star (Paul Newman), is aw
fully disappointing. There are terrific ac
tion sequences (if you consider pool
action), lots of dark and seedy interiors
which have been beautifully shot by Mi
chael Ballhaus, and all the hyped-up,
"Rocky"-style dramatics you could want;

hut li s an empty movie, concerned with
nothing but its own style. The script,
which exhumes The Hustler, Fast Eddie
Felsen. 20 years later (he s now a liquor
wholesaler) and pairs him with a flashy
young pool shark (Tom Cruise), doesn't
give Newman much to play; he's great to
look at, and everything he does seems
right, but he only gets to cut loose in a
couple of scenes. The real emblem of the
movie is Cruise; he can't act (1 mean, the
man really cannot act), and therefore
bases his performances on nothing but his
stylish moves and engaging grin. He's all
right there on the surface, just like the
movie.

Heart breakers (1984)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
"Heartbreakers" is a rarity — a male
bonding movie that's sympathetic to
women. It's also got a lot of style, a hip, au
thentic '80s feel, and good performances
by Peter Coyote and Nick Mancuso.
"Heartbreakers" was one of the better
American movies of 1984, but got lost in
the marketing shuffle — it's worth seeking
out now. Coyote and Mancuso play best
friends, an artist and an accountant, who
lead stylish, slightly dissipated and inse
cure L A. lives. Among the women who fall
into and out of those lives are Kathryn
Harrold, Carol Laure and Carol Wayne.
Plays tomorrow with "About Last Night."
— MH
Witness (1985)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
In the men's room of a Philadelphia
train station, Samuel Lapp (Lukas Hass), a
little Amish boy on his first trip away from
home, witnesses a cop's brutal murder;
taken in for questioning along with his
reluctant mother, Rachel, a young widow
(Kelly McGillis), he identifies one of the
killers — another cop. Peter Weir didn't
select the William Kelley-Earl Wallace
script; he replaced the director originally
signed for the project. But you wouldn't
guess that from looking at the results; shot
by John Seale, "Witness" is a beauty.
Weir's awareness that he has caught some
thing new on film in the Lancaster County
scenes is apparent in the rapt, wondrous
tone of especially the early sequences,
and, in part because of the talent of his
two stars, Weir is able to obtain an unex
pected intensity in the romance that
develops between them. With Josef Som
mer, Patti Lupone and Alexander
Godunov.
Plays tonight with "Belizaire the Cajun."

Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Mark MedofFs award-winning play is a
melodramatic love story posing as a social
problem drama; the same is true of the
movie version, except that the movie jerks
tears with even more of a vengeance. And
it's effective as hell; you'll find yourself
genuinely moved, not by the writing or
Randa Haines' barely serviceable direc
tion, but by the intensely emotional, pull
out-all-the-stops performances of William
Hurt and Marlee Matlin. Hurt, as a young,
ambitious teacher at a school for the deaf,

and Matlin, as the emotionally wounded
ex-student he falls in love with, are the
movie; there's nothing else worth watch
ing, or thinking about. Working together,
they transcend the sodden material.

Crocodile Dundee
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
A good-natured but drab and klutzy
comedy, featuring this year's Aussie, Paul
Hogan. Hogan stars as Dundee, a sort of
Natty Bumppo of the outback, who's lured
back to civilization (or at least New York)
by a busybody reporter (Linda Kozlowski,
in her first movie). As you might expect,
the Croc teaches the city slickers a thing or
two, as well as winning the girl, earning
the respect of various cynical urbanites,
and scoring many points for natural cour
tesy and basic human dignity. Hogan cer
tainly has charm, but he spends much of
the movie looking embarrassed by the
tired old jokes and stock comic situations
he has to wade through; he shouldn't be,
since he wrote the script himself.

My American Cousin
Guild, Menlo Park
Another entry in the "Gee, wasn't it
great to be a kid in the '50s" nostalgia
sweepstakes. This one offers Margaret
Langrick's self-assurance as a rebellious
12-year-old Canadian girl enamored of
her visiting American cousin, Butch (John
Wildman as a bargain basement James
Dean), and the beautiful Okanagan Valle>
in British Columbia as background, bui

otherwise suffers from community
theater-level acting, a run-of-the-mill story
and dialogue that's equal parts "Rebel
Without a Cause" and "Where the Boys
Are."
— MH
Stand By Me
Century 10, Mountain View
The sort of coming-of-age movie in
which the kids (in this case, four 11- and
12-year-old boys) are impossibly bright,
resourceful and supportive of each other;
adults don't exist, except as evil
caricatures; and every frame is supposed
to give off a golden glow. Rob Reiner di
rected this adaptation of a Stephen King
novella, in which the four boys (one of
them a born storyteller) take a symbolic
walk through the woods to see the dead
body of another boy their age. King and
Reiner combine to give us a sentimental
idyll of American childhood that doesn't
have any imagination to make up for its
syrup. It's all very tender and charming,
and completely false; only two scenes —
one in which the four flee across a rail
road bridge ahead of a train, and another
in which they walk along singing the
Chordettes' "Lollipop" — have any life to
them.
— MH
Round Midnight
Itjou, Palo Alto
This movie has plenty of jazz, but not
much soul. The great bebop sax man Dex
ter Gordon plays Dale Turner, an Ameri
can jazz man living in Paris in the '60s and

slowly killing himself with booze; he is
befriended by Francis, a young French
commercial artist (Francois Cluzet). who
gets him off the juice and back in the
studio. In addition to Gordon, the cast in
cludes musicians Bobby Hutcherson.
Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Freddie Hub
bard, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hanctxrk
and singer Lonette McKee. Vie see and
hear a lot of jazz played, including a mix of
standards and Hancock sand Gordon s
own compositions. But director and co
writer Bertrand Tavernier doesn't bring
the music, and the passion these men and
women feel for it, to life. Tavernier's rela
tionship to his material resembles that of
Francis to the jazzmen he idolizes: We first
see the character huddled in the rain
outside a Paris club, listening to Turner
through a grate in the wall. Gordon has
tremendous dignity and presence, and the
scenes showing the friendship between
Turner, Francis and Francis's daughter
Berangere (Christine Pascal) are very
touching; this seems to be the only part of
the movie Tavernier had any feel for.

The Gospel According to Vic
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Another small Scottish comedy. Tom
Conti is Vic, a non-believing Catholic
school teacher in Glasgow; when what
may be miracles start happening around
him, he undergoes crises both spiritual
and practical. Conti exhibits lots of frumpy
charm, and Helen Mirren lends her con
siderable talents as a fellow teacher at the
Blessed Edith Semple School. The movie
doesn't go very deep in its examination of
faith in the media age, settling instead for
quiet humor and a certain threadbare
charm, as with other Scottish films, "Vic"
is understated to the point of nonexis
tence. With Gordon Jackson of "Upstairs,
Downstairs" fame in a cameo.

Peggy Sue Got Married
Century 10, Mountain View
Kathleen Turner does her best to keep
Francis Ford Coppola's time travel
daydream afloat, but she doesn't get any
help. Coppola doesn't seem concerned
with making any sense out of the story or
giving us a stake in the characters; he gives
us lots of nifty '50s nostalgia, milks easy
laughs out of the '50s/'Bos time disjunc
tion, and leaves it at that. Turner's Peggy
Sue passes out at her 25th high school
reunion and wakes up back in high
school; rather than exploring the possibil
ities for irony and naughty fun inherent in
the situation, the movie goes gooey and
Peggy Sue moons over all the people she
didn't appreciate enough at the time. We
can see Turner, a great natural com
edienne, straining to bring some life to
her milksop character; even worse off is
Nicholas Cage, who is hopelessly lost as
her husband/boyfriend Charlie.

The Color of Money
Century 10, Mountain View
"The Color of Money" is a great sports
movie, which, given the director (Martin
Scorsese) and star (Paul Newman), is aw
fully disappointing. There are terrific ac
tion sequences (if you consider pool
action), lots of dark and seedy interiors
which have been beautifully shot by Mi
chael Ballhaus, and all the hyped-up,
"Rocky"-style dramatics you could want;

hut li s an empty movie, concerned with
nothing but its own style. The script,
which exhumes The Hustler, Fast Eddie
Felsen. 20 years later (he s now a liquor
wholesaler) and pairs him with a flashy
young pool shark (Tom Cruise), doesn't
give Newman much to play; he's great to
look at, and everything he does seems
right, but he only gets to cut loose in a
couple of scenes. The real emblem of the
movie is Cruise; he can't act (1 mean, the
man really cannot act), and therefore
bases his performances on nothing but his
stylish moves and engaging grin. He's all
right there on the surface, just like the
movie.

Heart breakers (1984)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
"Heartbreakers" is a rarity — a male
bonding movie that's sympathetic to
women. It's also got a lot of style, a hip, au
thentic '80s feel, and good performances
by Peter Coyote and Nick Mancuso.
"Heartbreakers" was one of the better
American movies of 1984, but got lost in
the marketing shuffle — it's worth seeking
out now. Coyote and Mancuso play best
friends, an artist and an accountant, who
lead stylish, slightly dissipated and inse
cure L A. lives. Among the women who fall
into and out of those lives are Kathryn
Harrold, Carol Laure and Carol Wayne.
Plays tomorrow with "About Last Night."

Witness (1985)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
In the men's room of a Philadelphia
train station, Samuel Lapp (Lukas Hass), a
little Amish boy on his first trip away from
home, witnesses a cop's brutal murder;
taken in for questioning along with his
reluctant mother, Rachel, a young widow
(Kelly McGillis), he identifies one of the
killers — another cop. Peter Weir didn't
select the William Kelley-Earl Wallace
script; he replaced the director originally
signed for the project. But you wouldn't
guess that from looking at the results; shot
by John Seale, "Witness" is a beauty.
Weir's awareness that he has caught some
thing new on film in the Lancaster County
scenes is apparent in the rapt, wondrous
tone of especially the early sequences,
and, in part because of the talent of his
two stars, Weir is able to obtain an unex
pected intensity in the romance that
develops between them. With Josef Som
mer, Patti Lupone and Alexander
Godunov.
Plays tonight with "Belizaire the Cajun."

The Big Chill (1983)
Memorial Auditorium, Bechtel Interna

Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan
searched the soul of his generation to find
out how he and his fellow children of the
'60s were getting along in the '80s; it
turned out they were being childish, nar
cissistic, self-righteous jerks. The subtext
of this celebration of friendship is that the
cold, scary world is hardly worth bother
ing with, so find a small group of people
who think like you do and bury yourself in
it. The movie itself emblemizes the small
mindedness and pretension that went into
its making: It sports its good taste in music
and hot young cast as signs of hipness and
distinction. Millions upon millions of
moviegoers bought into this view of them
selves; Kasdan makes it easy for them by
structuring his scenes to those great songs
on the soundtrack and putting one per
sonable young actor after another in the
spotlight, among them Jeff Goldblum,
William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Glenn Close,
Mary Kay Place, Tom Berenger, Jobeth

Rumblefish (1983)
Cubberley Auditorium
All of Francis Ford Coppola's film ver
sion of an adolescent novel by S.E. Hinton
looks like the dream clouds in"The Ele
phant Man" — we never get to wake up in
this movie. Stephen Burum laid his black
and white photography on with a trowel:

It's so film noir that the Xanadu scenes in
"Citizen Kane" look naturalistic in com
parison. Steam erupts from every corner,
street signs seem to float in space, and the
camera looms so close to faces that they
distort and age. This must be one of the
craziest movies ever made commercially
in this country. You'd never guess that
Coppola was trying to make a picture
about anything as accessible as frustrated
teenagers or restless young nomads; he's
so in love with his own dumb metaphors
and his own amazing technical skills that
they take over the film. The large cast is
full of talent, but Coppola lets them act
and act, never imposing any controls, until
finally they become excessive, narcissistic.

hear a lot of jazz played, including a mix of
standards and Hancock sand Gordon s

writer Bertrand Tavernier doesn't bring
the music, and the passion these men and

tionship to his material resembles that of
Francis to the jazzmen he idolizes: We first
see the character huddled in the rain
outside a Paris club, listening to Turner
through a grate in the wall. Gordon has
tremendous dignity and presence, and the
scenes showing the friendship between
Turner, Francis and Francis's daughter
Berangere (Christine Pascal) are very
touching; this seems to be the only part of
the movie Tavernier had any feel for.

The Gospel According to Vic
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Another small Scottish comedy. Tom
Conti is Vic, a non-believing Catholic
school teacher in Glasgow; when what
may be miracles start happening around
him, he undergoes crises both spiritual
and practical. Conti exhibits lots of frumpy
charm, and Helen Mirren lends her con
siderable talents as a fellow teacher at the
Blessed Edith Semple School. The movie
doesn't go very deep in its examination of
faith in the media age, settling instead for
quiet humor and a certain threadbare
charm, as with other Scottish films, "Vic"
is understated to the point of nonexis
tence. With Gordon Jackson of "Upstairs,
Downstairs" fame in a cameo.

Peggy Sue Got Married
Century 10, Mountain View
Kathleen Turner does her best to keep
Francis Ford Coppola's time travel
daydream afloat, but she doesn't get any
help. Coppola doesn't seem concerned
with making any sense out of the story or
giving us a stake in the characters; he gives
us lots of nifty '50s nostalgia, milks easy
laughs out of the '50s/'Bos time disjunc
tion, and leaves it at that. Turner's Peggy
Sue passes out at her 25th high school
reunion and wakes up back in high
school; rather than exploring the possibil
ities for irony and naughty fun inherent in
the situation, the movie goes gooey and
Peggy Sue moons over all the people she
didn't appreciate enough at the time. We
can see Turner, a great natural com
edienne, straining to bring some life to
her milksop character; even worse off is
Nicholas Cage, who is hopelessly lost as
her husband/boyfriend Charlie.

The Color of Money
Century 10, Mountain View
"The Color of Money" is a great sports
movie, which, given the director (Martin
Scorsese) and star (Paul Newman), is aw
fully disappointing. There are terrific ac
tion sequences (if you consider pool
action), lots of dark and seedy interiors
which have been beautifully shot by Mi
chael Ballhaus, and all the hyped-up,
"Rocky"-style dramatics you could want;

hut li s an empty movie, concerned with
nothing but its own style. The script,
which exhumes The Hustler, Fast Eddie
Felsen. 20 years later (he s now a liquor
wholesaler) and pairs him with a flashy
young pool shark (Tom Cruise), doesn't
give Newman much to play; he's great to
look at, and everything he does seems
right, but he only gets to cut loose in a
couple of scenes. The real emblem of the
movie is Cruise; he can't act (1 mean, the
man really cannot act), and therefore
bases his performances on nothing but his
stylish moves and engaging grin. He's all
right there on the surface, just like the
movie.

Heart breakers (1984)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
"Heartbreakers" is a rarity — a male
bonding movie that's sympathetic to
women. It's also got a lot of style, a hip, au
thentic '80s feel, and good performances
by Peter Coyote and Nick Mancuso.
"Heartbreakers" was one of the better
American movies of 1984, but got lost in
the marketing shuffle — it's worth seeking
out now. Coyote and Mancuso play best
friends, an artist and an accountant, who
lead stylish, slightly dissipated and inse
cure L A. lives. Among the women who fall
into and out of those lives are Kathryn
Harrold, Carol Laure and Carol Wayne.
Plays tomorrow with "About Last Night."

Witness (1985)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
In the men's room of a Philadelphia
train station, Samuel Lapp (Lukas Hass), a
little Amish boy on his first trip away from
home, witnesses a cop's brutal murder;
taken in for questioning along with his
reluctant mother, Rachel, a young widow
(Kelly McGillis), he identifies one of the
killers — another cop. Peter Weir didn't
select the William Kelley-Earl Wallace
script; he replaced the director originally
signed for the project. But you wouldn't
guess that from looking at the results; shot
by John Seale, "Witness" is a beauty.
Weir's awareness that he has caught some
thing new on film in the Lancaster County
scenes is apparent in the rapt, wondrous
tone of especially the early sequences,
and, in part because of the talent of his
two stars, Weir is able to obtain an unex
pected intensity in the romance that
develops between them. With Josef Som
mer, Patti Lupone and Alexander
Godunov.

The Big Chill (1983)
Memorial Auditorium, Bechtel Interna
tional Center
Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan
searched the soul of his generation to find
out how he and his fellow children of the
'60s were getting along in the '80s; it
turned out they were being childish, nar
cissistic, self-righteous jerks. The subtext
of this celebration of friendship is that the
cold, scary world is hardly worth bother
ing with, so find a small group of people
who think like you do and bury yourself in
it. The movie itself emblemizes the small
mindedness and pretension that went into
its making: It sports its good taste in music
and hot young cast as signs of hipness and
distinction. Millions upon millions of
moviegoers bought into this view of them
selves; Kasdan makes it easy for them by
structuring his scenes to those great songs
on the soundtrack and putting one per
sonable young actor after another in the
spotlight, among them Jeff Goldblum,
William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Glenn Close,
Mary Kay Place, Tom Berenger, Jobeth
Williams and Meg Tilly.

Rumblefish (1983)
Cubberley Auditorium
All of Francis Ford Coppola's film ver
sion of an adolescent novel by S.E. Hinton
looks like the dream clouds in"The Ele
phant Man" — we never get to wake up in
this movie. Stephen Burum laid his black
and white photography on with a trowel:

It's so film noir that the Xanadu scenes in
"Citizen Kane" look naturalistic in com
parison. Steam erupts from every corner,
street signs seem to float in space, and the
camera looms so close to faces that they
distort and age. This must be one of the
craziest movies ever made commercially
in this country. You'd never guess that
Coppola was trying to make a picture
about anything as accessible as frustrated
teenagers or restless young nomads; he's
so in love with his own dumb metaphors
and his own amazing technical skills that
they take over the film. The large cast is
full of talent, but Coppola lets them act
and act, never imposing any controls, until
finally they become excessive, narcissistic.
With Mickey Rourke, Matt Dillon, Diane
Lane, Nicolas Cage, Vincent Spano and —

Children of a Lesser God
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Mark MedofFs award-winning play is a
melodramatic love story posing as a social
problem drama; the same is true of the
movie version, except that the movie jerks
tears with even more of a vengeance. And
it's effective as hell; you'll find yourself
genuinely moved, not by the writing or
Randa Haines' barely serviceable direc
tion, but by the intensely emotional, pull
out-all-the-stops performances of William
Hurt and Marlee Matlin. Hurt, as a young,
ambitious teacher at a school for the deaf,

and Matlin, as the emotionally wounded
ex-student he falls in love with, are the
movie; there's nothing else worth watch
ing, or thinking about. Working together,
they transcend the sodden material.

Crocodile Dundee
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
A good-natured but drab and klutzy
comedy, featuring this year's Aussie, Paul
Hogan. Hogan stars as Dundee, a sort of
Natty Bumppo of the outback, who's lured
back to civilization (or at least New York)
by a busybody reporter (Linda Kozlowski,
in her first movie). As you might expect,
the Croc teaches the city slickers a thing or
two, as well as winning the girl, earning
the respect of various cynical urbanites,
and scoring many points for natural cour
tesy and basic human dignity. Hogan cer
tainly has charm, but he spends much of
the movie looking embarrassed by the
tired old jokes and stock comic situations
he has to wade through; he shouldn't be,
since he wrote the script himself.

her visiting American cousin, Butch (John

Stand By Me
Century 10, Mountain View
The sort of coming-of-age movie in
which the kids (in this case, four 11- and
12-year-old boys) are impossibly bright,
resourceful and supportive of each other;
adults don't exist, except as evil
caricatures; and every frame is supposed
to give off a golden glow. Rob Reiner di
rected this adaptation of a Stephen King
novella, in which the four boys (one of
them a born storyteller) take a symbolic
walk through the woods to see the dead
body of another boy their age. King and
Reiner combine to give us a sentimental
idyll of American childhood that doesn't
have any imagination to make up for its
syrup. It's all very tender and charming,
and completely false; only two scenes —
one in which the four flee across a rail
road bridge ahead of a train, and another
in which they walk along singing the
Chordettes' "Lollipop" — have any life to
them.

thentic '80s feel, and good performances
by Peter Coyote and Nick Mancuso.
"Heartbreakers" was one of the better
American movies of 1984, but got lost in
the marketing shuffle — it's worth seeking
out now. Coyote and Mancuso play best
friends, an artist and an accountant, who
lead stylish, slightly dissipated and inse
cure L A. lives. Among the women who fall
into and out of those lives are Kathryn
Harrold, Carol Laure and Carol Wayne.
Plays tomorrow with "About Last Night."

Witness (1985)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
In the men's room of a Philadelphia
train station, Samuel Lapp (Lukas Hass), a
little Amish boy on his first trip away from
home, witnesses a cop's brutal murder;
taken in for questioning along with his
reluctant mother, Rachel, a young widow
(Kelly McGillis), he identifies one of the
killers — another cop. Peter Weir didn't
select the William Kelley-Earl Wallace
script; he replaced the director originally
signed for the project. But you wouldn't
guess that from looking at the results; shot
by John Seale, "Witness" is a beauty.
Weir's awareness that he has caught some
thing new on film in the Lancaster County
scenes is apparent in the rapt, wondrous
tone of especially the early sequences,
and, in part because of the talent of his
two stars, Weir is able to obtain an unex
pected intensity in the romance that
develops between them. With Josef Som
mer, Patti Lupone and Alexander
Godunov.
Plays tonight with "Belizaire the Cajun."

'Something
Wild'
Something Wild
Aquarius, Palo Aito; I'A Redwixxl Six, Red
wood City
A wonderful new comedy from director
Jonathan Demme (' Melvin and Howard,"
"Stop Making Sense"). Charlie Driggs.
square young hank vice-president with
deeply submerged anarchic tendencies
(Jeff Daniels), is picked up on a Manhattan
sidewalk by Lulu (Melanie Griffith), a
beautiful, unpredictable and seemingly
unfathomable young woman The movie j&y
is the story of th« trip they take together
out into America (and back again), the lies
they tell each other, the things they do that
they've never done before, and how all
thus nearly kills them; it plumbs yuppie
conformity, mindless violence and the dis
tance (or lack thereof) between them
American filmmakers have been trying to
make a movie like this one for the past few
years — most notably Martin Scorsese
with "After Hours," but also Susan Seidel
man with "Desperately Seeking Susan"
and even, in a tangential way, David Lynch
with "Blue Velvet" — but none has
managed it so truly, so seamlessly and
with such depth of feeling. Daniels and
Griffith give warm, tremendously touch
ing performances; Ray Liotta makes an im
pressive movie debut as a man out of
Lulu's past. Written by E. Max Frye; shot by
the great Tak Fujimoto.

The Big Chill (1983)
Memorial Auditorium, Bechtel Interna
tional Center
Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan
searched the soul of his generation to find
out how he and his fellow children of the
'60s were getting along in the '80s; it
turned out they were being childish, nar
cissistic, self-righteous jerks. The subtext
of this celebration of friendship is that the
cold, scary world is hardly worth bother
ing with, so find a small group of people
who think like you do and bury yourself in
it. The movie itself emblemizes the small
mindedness and pretension that went into
its making: It sports its good taste in music
and hot young cast as signs of hipness and
distinction. Millions upon millions of
moviegoers bought into this view of them
selves; Kasdan makes it easy for them by
structuring his scenes to those great songs
on the soundtrack and putting one per
sonable young actor after another in the
spotlight, among them Jeff Goldblum,
William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Glenn Close,
Mary Kay Place, Tom Berenger, Jobeth
Williams and Meg Tilly.
Plays in Mem Aud Sunday at 7 and 9:30
p.m. and at the I-Center Sunday at 8 p.m.

Rumblefish (1983)
Cubberley Auditorium
All of Francis Ford Coppola's film ver
sion of an adolescent novel by S.E. Hinton
looks like the dream clouds in"The Ele
phant Man" — we never get to wake up in
this movie. Stephen Burum laid his black
and white photography on with a trowel:

It's so film noir that the Xanadu scenes in
"Citizen Kane" look naturalistic in com
parison. Steam erupts from every corner,
street signs seem to float in space, and the
camera looms so close to faces that they
distort and age. This must be one of the
craziest movies ever made commercially
in this country. You'd never guess that
Coppola was trying to make a picture
about anything as accessible as frustrated
teenagers or restless young nomads; he's
so in love with his own dumb metaphors
and his own amazing technical skills that
they take over the film. The large cast is
full of talent, but Coppola lets them act
and act, never imposing any controls, until
finally they become excessive, narcissistic.
With Mickey Rourke, Matt Dillon, Diane
Lane, Nicolas Cage, Vincent Spano and —
giving the blue ribbon dreadful perfor
mances — Diana Scarwid and Dennis
Hopper.
Plays Tuesday at 8 p.m.

Children of a Lesser God
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Mark MedofFs award-winning play is a
melodramatic love story posing as a social
problem drama; the same is true of the
movie version, except that the movie jerks
tears with even more of a vengeance. And
it's effective as hell; you'll find yourself
genuinely moved, not by the writing or
Randa Haines' barely serviceable direc
tion, but by the intensely emotional, pull
out-all-the-stops performances of William
Hurt and Marlee Matlin. Hurt, as a young,
ambitious teacher at a school for the deaf,

and Matlin, as the emotionally wounded
ex-student he falls in love with, are the
movie; there's nothing else worth watch
ing, or thinking about. Working together,
they transcend the sodden material.

Crocodile Dundee
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
A good-natured but drab and klutzy
comedy, featuring this year's Aussie, Paul
Hogan. Hogan stars as Dundee, a sort of
Natty Bumppo of the outback, who's lured
back to civilization (or at least New York)
by a busybody reporter (Linda Kozlowski,
in her first movie). As you might expect,
the Croc teaches the city slickers a thing or
two, as well as winning the girl, earning
the respect of various cynical urbanites,
and scoring many points for natural cour
tesy and basic human dignity. Hogan cer
tainly has charm, but he spends much of
the movie looking embarrassed by the
tired old jokes and stock comic situations
he has to wade through; he shouldn't be,
since he wrote the script himself.
— M.H.
My American Cousin
Guild, Menlo Park
Another entry in the "Gee, wasn't it
great to be a kid in the '50s" nostalgia
sweepstakes. This one offers Margaret
Langrick's self-assurance as a rebellious
12-year-old Canadian girl enamored of
her visiting American cousin, Butch (John
Wildman as a bargain basement James
Dean), and the beautiful Okanagan Valle>
in British Columbia as background, bui

otherwise suffers from community
theater-level acting, a run-of-the-mill story
and dialogue that's equal parts "Rebel
Without a Cause" and "Where the Boys
Are."
— MH
Stand By Me
Century 10, Mountain View
The sort of coming-of-age movie in
which the kids (in this case, four 11- and
12-year-old boys) are impossibly bright,
resourceful and supportive of each other;
adults don't exist, except as evil
caricatures; and every frame is supposed
to give off a golden glow. Rob Reiner di
rected this adaptation of a Stephen King
novella, in which the four boys (one of
them a born storyteller) take a symbolic
walk through the woods to see the dead
body of another boy their age. King and
Reiner combine to give us a sentimental
idyll of American childhood that doesn't
have any imagination to make up for its
syrup. It's all very tender and charming,
and completely false; only two scenes —
one in which the four flee across a rail
road bridge ahead of a train, and another
in which they walk along singing the
Chordettes' "Lollipop" — have any life to
them.
— MH
Round Midnight
Itjou, Palo Alto
This movie has plenty of jazz, but not
much soul. The great bebop sax man Dex
ter Gordon plays Dale Turner, an Ameri
can jazz man living in Paris in the '60s and

slowly killing himself with booze; he is
befriended by Francis, a young French
commercial artist (Francois Cluzet). who
gets him off the juice and back in the
studio. In addition to Gordon, the cast in
cludes musicians Bobby Hutcherson.
Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Freddie Hub
bard, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hanctxrk
and singer Lonette McKee. Vie see and
hear a lot of jazz played, including a mix of
standards and Hancock sand Gordon s
own compositions. But director and co
writer Bertrand Tavernier doesn't bring
the music, and the passion these men and
women feel for it, to life. Tavernier's rela
tionship to his material resembles that of
Francis to the jazzmen he idolizes: We first
see the character huddled in the rain
outside a Paris club, listening to Turner
through a grate in the wall. Gordon has
tremendous dignity and presence, and the
scenes showing the friendship between
Turner, Francis and Francis's daughter
Berangere (Christine Pascal) are very
touching; this seems to be the only part of
the movie Tavernier had any feel for.

The Gospel According to Vic
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Another small Scottish comedy. Tom
Conti is Vic, a non-believing Catholic
school teacher in Glasgow; when what
may be miracles start happening around
him, he undergoes crises both spiritual
and practical. Conti exhibits lots of frumpy
charm, and Helen Mirren lends her con
siderable talents as a fellow teacher at the
Blessed Edith Semple School. The movie
doesn't go very deep in its examination of
faith in the media age, settling instead for
quiet humor and a certain threadbare
charm, as with other Scottish films, "Vic"
is understated to the point of nonexis
tence. With Gordon Jackson of "Upstairs,
Downstairs" fame in a cameo.
— AI.H.
Peggy Sue Got Married
Century 10, Mountain View
Kathleen Turner does her best to keep
Francis Ford Coppola's time travel
daydream afloat, but she doesn't get any
help. Coppola doesn't seem concerned
with making any sense out of the story or
giving us a stake in the characters; he gives
us lots of nifty '50s nostalgia, milks easy
laughs out of the '50s/'Bos time disjunc
tion, and leaves it at that. Turner's Peggy
Sue passes out at her 25th high school
reunion and wakes up back in high
school; rather than exploring the possibil
ities for irony and naughty fun inherent in
the situation, the movie goes gooey and
Peggy Sue moons over all the people she
didn't appreciate enough at the time. We
can see Turner, a great natural com
edienne, straining to bring some life to
her milksop character; even worse off is
Nicholas Cage, who is hopelessly lost as
her husband/boyfriend Charlie.
— M.H.
The Color of Money
Century 10, Mountain View
"The Color of Money" is a great sports
movie, which, given the director (Martin
Scorsese) and star (Paul Newman), is aw
fully disappointing. There are terrific ac
tion sequences (if you consider pool
action), lots of dark and seedy interiors
which have been beautifully shot by Mi
chael Ballhaus, and all the hyped-up,
"Rocky"-style dramatics you could want;

hut li s an empty movie, concerned with
nothing but its own style. The script,
which exhumes The Hustler, Fast Eddie
Felsen. 20 years later (he s now a liquor
wholesaler) and pairs him with a flashy
young pool shark (Tom Cruise), doesn't
give Newman much to play; he's great to
look at, and everything he does seems
right, but he only gets to cut loose in a
couple of scenes. The real emblem of the
movie is Cruise; he can't act (1 mean, the
man really cannot act), and therefore
bases his performances on nothing but his
stylish moves and engaging grin. He's all
right there on the surface, just like the
movie.
