## Card hopes to cool off Wildcats in regional 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
All three of the teams in this weekend's NCAA
Midwest Field Hockey Regional have been hot
lately, but look for them to do a little cooling off
in the next few days.
The temperature in lowa City will probably be
below freezing for Sunday's regional final. Be
cause of tomorrow's lowa-Purdue football game
at Kinnick Stadium, the first-round game between
Stanford and Northwestern has been moved in
doors to the University Indoor Practice Facility.
The winner of tomorrow's contest will meet lowa
at Kinnick Stadium on Sunday.
Not surprisingly, the Cardinal is happy with the
new arrangement. "We're very glad," Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "That's probably the
only difference (between Eastern and Western
teams): We play in the sunshine, and they play in
the cold."
Playing outdoors would seem to give a Midwest
team like the Wildcats an edge against Stanford,
but Northwestern Coach Nancy Stevens didn't
mind giving up this advantage. "We are looking
forward to playing indoors. When it's this cold, it
doesn't help anyone."
The Wildcats have not needed much help from
anyone or anything this year, finishing second in
the Big Ten Conference (behind Iowa) with a 6-2-
2 league mark, 14-3-2 overall. Probably their most
impressive outing of the regular season was their
last â€” a 2-0 win over No. 1 North Carolina on the
road.
"I think we've steadily improved all season,"
Stevens said. "Our record is certainly not un
blemished because we've had a lot of injuries, as
most teams have. (But) now we're at full strength,
and when we're at full strength, we're very good."

The Wildcats' victory over the top-ranked Tar
Heels showed just how good they can be, and, be
cause lowa took the Big Ten title, the win also
ensured Northwestern of an NCAA berth. By
winning against UNC, we felt it would get us into
the tournament," Stevens said. "We might have
gotten in anyway, but we wanted to take it upon
ourselves."
The strength of the Northwestern team is its
defense. Senior goalkeeper Robin Clark has re
corded 13 shutouts in 19 games and has a .864
goals-against average.
I he Wildcats' offense comes mainh from a
foreign source in Holland-born sophomores
Sannie Van Dijck and Lorette Borstman. Van Dijck
leads the team in scoring with 18 goals and eight
assists, while Borstman is second with 14 goals
and 10 assists. Senior Jennifer Averill is the
playmaker for Northwestern, with 18 assists to go
with six goals.
Stanford has also been playing rather well of
late. The Cardinal has strung together 10 straight
wins, nine of them shutouts, to raise its overall
record to 12-4-1. "I think we are just about at our
peak,' Johnson said. "So we're ready."
Sophomore Kat Thomas paces the Cardinal at
tack with 14 goals, followed by senior Maree
Chung with four and Andi Wolpert, Dana Fleming
and Laura Gartland with three each.
Stanford goalkeeper Karen Jones has recorded
10 shutouts on the year and has a .82 goals-against
average.
The Cardinal joined both lowa and Northwest
ern in last year's Midwest regional, losing 3-0 to
lowa in the first round. Because it was the team's
first-ever NCAA appearance, Stanford believes
things may be different this time around.
"I think a lot of people on the team feel like last
year we were just happy that we had made it,"

senior and co-captain Mary Goodman said. "We
didn't play well at all. This year we're going with
winning on our minds. Vie want to play lowa
again."
So does Northwestern. But because the Haw

keyes and Wildcats have met for the Midwest title
each of the past three years, Stevens is worried
that her team may be looking past Stanford.
"That is something we're going to focus on all
week, and that is Stanford," Stevens said.
