# Three seniors set sights on Northwestern
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
It's a little unfair perhaps, but the
fact remains that the career of a college
senior on a successful team usually
ends in defeat. Successful teams very
often participate in some form of
postseason play, but very few win
championships. And in most collegiate
sports, there are no professional
leagues.
Unless the Stanford field hockey
team can upset Big Ten Conference
powers Northwestern and lowa in the
NCAA Midwest regional, this injustice
will befall three Cardinal seniors this
weekend.
Of the three, only forward Maree
Chung had considered the possibility
that the next loss will be the last loss.
"It's exciting that we're going to
playoffs, but it's also sad because we've
won so many games and want it to go
on," she said.
Chung and co-captains Mary Good
man and Andi Wolpert will be missed
by the Stanford program. "They've all
been tremendous helps," second-year
Stanford Coach Shervl Johnson said.
"They head our fund-raising projects,
get the team together for team meals
and keep everyone together."
According to Johnson, all three of
the seniors are leaders, but in different
ways. Andi is a quiet leader. She leads
by example," Johnson said. "Mary and
Maree use more verbal encourage
ment."
Goodman agreed with Johnson's
assessment, but Chung was not so sure.
"I think I lead by example, too," Chung
said. "I don't consider myself a talker."
Chung may not be a talker, but she is
definitely a scorer. A four-year starter,
Chung was named All Northern Pacific
Conference in 1985 and is second on
the Cardinal in scoring this year with
four goals. "She has superb one-on
one skills," Johnson said.
Goodman, a walk-on from Hills
borough, played junior varsity her
freshman year and did not get much
playing time the following season. She
broke into the lineup as a junior and as
been there ever since, having played

almost every position on the field.
"She's a workhorse out there; she al
ways hustling," Johnson said.
An example of Goodman's hard
nosed attitude came when she was
asked about the arctic weather the
Cardinal may face this weekend in
lowa City. "We should be mentally
tough enough for it," she said. "And
they'll be out in the cold, too."
Wolpert, who could not be reached
for comment before the team left for
lowa yesterday, has been one of the
team's mainstays for the past four
years. A two-time All-NorPac selection,
Wolpert has scored three goals this
year and has set up numerous others
with her powerful slapshots. "I've seen
her make tremendous improvement,"
said Johnson, who coached Wolpert
for two years at her Cupertino high
school.
Whether this year's class would even
have a senior season was in doubt for
some time last spring when the Ath
letic Department cut the program's
funding. "Personally, I think a lot of us
felt betrayed by the University," Good
man said. "But I think everyone really
pulled together."
"It was traumatic, but we knew we
could keep our program alive
(through fund-raising)," Chung said.
