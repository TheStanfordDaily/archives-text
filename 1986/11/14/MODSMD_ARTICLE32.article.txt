# Season opener for basketball
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
The Mike Montgomery era
begins Sunday as the Stanford bas
ketball team meets the Norwegian
National Team in a 7:30 p.m. contest
at Maples Pavilion.
After four weeks of practice and
scrimmages, Montgomery is anx
ious to watch his team in a competi
tive situation. "Like anybody else, I
want to see how we react to game
conditions, with referees, the
crowd, etc.," he said. "We've played
against ourselves for four weeks.
We want to see if the things we've
been doing work better than in
practice or worse."
The starters for the Cardinal will
be the five returning players who
saw the most action under former
coach Tom Davis, now at lowa.
Sophomore Terry Taylor will be the
point guard, with senior Novian
Whitsitt at off guard.
The small forward will be sopho
more Todd Lichti, an All-Pacific 10
Conference selection as a freshman
last year. Junior Greg Butler will
man the power forward spot, with
sophomore Howard Wright at cen
ter, although Montgomery said the
two big men "are pretty much inter
changeable."
The season opener usually
means a lot of substitution, but
Montgomery plans to stick basically
with an eight-man rotation, with
junior center Eric Reveno, sopho
more forward Brian McSweeney
and redshirt sophomore guard
Scott Meinert joining the five
starters.
Anyone coming to the game ex
pecting to see Stanford freshmen

Stuart Thomas, Deshon Wingate
and Oliver Cunningham may be
disappointed. "I can't play anybody
who is a redshirt candidate,"
Montgomery said. "I'd hate to waste
a year of eligibility on five or six
minutes of an exhibition game."
Another reason Montgomery will
be going with his top players is the
obvious one: to win. "Normally in
an exhibition game we will play as
many as we can, but Norway is bet
ter than people anticipated," he
said. "It's important for us to win
and gain confidence. We want to
win and see where we are."
Norway is certainly better than
people anticipated. These Scan
dinavians are not a bunch of
pituitary cases pulled off of the ski
slopes and given a pair of high-tops
â€” they can play.
After losing to Seattle-Pacific 103-
101, the Norwegians took Washing
ton to overtime Tuesday before fall
ing 76-73- Then they went to Corval
lis, Ore., the next night and pum
meled Oregon State 96-84. Forward
Arild Beck led Norway with 22
points, 10 assists and seven
rebounds, while Haakon Austefjord
and Chris Fahrbach scored 16 each.
Norway also hit six of nine shots
from college basketball's new
three-point line.
The 1986-87 schedule has not
even begun, but Stanford has
already made progress for next
season. On Wednesday the Cardinal
signed two players to letters-of
intent, the first by Montgomery and
his staff. One is Lang Meyer, a 6-
foot-9 center from The Wood
lands, Texas, and the other is
Andrew Vlahov, a 6-7 forward from
Penh, Australia.

season opener Sunday. Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery has indicated he will go to the bench
sparingly against the Norwegian National Team.
