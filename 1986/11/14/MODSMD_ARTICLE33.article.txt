# SMU, Texas on agenda for swimmers
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
Coming off two consecutive national championships, the
Stanford men's swimming team will defend its title on the
road against top-10 ranked SMU and Texas this weekend.
Despite losing top breaststrokers Dave L.undberg and
John Moffet to graduation, the Cardinal returns one of its
deepest lineups ever, led by world-class standouts Pablo
Morales, Jeff Kostoff, Anthony Mosse and Sean Murphy.
Also back are All-Americans John Hodge, Jay Mortenson,
Matt Nance and Dave Louden, accompanied by a freshman
class that Stanford Coach Skip Kenney called "the best we've
ever had on paper."
Stanford, undefeated in its last 45 dual meets dating back
to 1982, enters the two meets with the objectives of
"evaluating the team and learning how to race," according
to Kenney.
"Anytime we can learn how to race better, that's what we
need to do," Kenney said. "It also gives us the opportunity
to swim our freshmen on a travel situation against two
strong teams.
"Generally freshmen are a little uptight about swimming
their first collegiate meet," Kenney added.
Kenney stressed that swimming at Texas will give Stan
ford an added advantage of familiarity during the NCAAs,
since they will be held at Texas this season.
Much is expected of this year's talented corps of rookies,
which includes Goodwill Games 200-meter freestyle cham
pion John Witchell and 200 breaststroker Sam Schwartz,
who swam in the national championships. Freshmen Byron
Burson, Lunn Lestina and Rick Gould are also being counted
on for big performances this season.
"We have the potential to be a better team; a lot of that
depends on the freshmen," Morales said. "They're tough in
dividuals, hard workers — a potential to shine in the pres
sure situations."
During the meets, Kenney and Asst. Coach Ted Knapp
hope to get a better understanding of the overall makeup
and strengths of the team, "evaluating the guys while taking
into account their swimming programs and workout
schedules during the summer," Knapp
said.
"We see each dual meet as a stepping stone — building
