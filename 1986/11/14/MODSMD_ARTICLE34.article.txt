# Stanford spikers host ASU, Ariz.
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
This weekend, Maples Pavilion will
be the site of two women's volleyball
matches that will provide an excellent
barometer for judging just how good
the Stanford spikers are as the NCAA
playoffs draw within three weeks.
The competition will be Arizona
State, tonight at 7:30 p.m., and Arizona,
tomorrow evening at the same time.
These schools may not have the big
name programs of UCLA or the I 'niver
sify of the Pacific, but they definitely
have the talent to give Stanford at least
as much trouble as it can handle.
ASU, ranked 13th nationally, brings a
19-5 overall record to Maples, superior
to the Cardinal's 16-8 mark. Stanford,
though, is ranked higher at No. 11 and
is far ahead of the Sun Devils in the
Pacific 10 Conference standings. The
leader board has UCLA on top with a
14-1 league record, one game up on
the 12-1 Cardinal Alone in third is ASU
at 9-4. Stanford is undefeated at home
in its seven conference matches.
The Bruins have the weekend off,
giving the Cardinal a chance to draw
even Stanford Coach Don Shaw said
the first-place finisher in the Pac-10
really doesn't matter, though, and that

"all along, we've considered ourselves
to be in first place, because we beat
UCLA."
While the average fan may not put
ASU among the nation's best, Shaw
does, without question. "There are 12
teams that could end up winning the
national championship." he said, " and
Arizona State is one of them.
"They're a great team. They have
outstanding physical ability," Shaw
added, noting that, when Stanford
swept the Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz.,
earlier this fall, "they didn't play that
well, and we played one of our best
matches."
Ail-American Tammy Webb leads
ASU in kills, blocks and digs In the
Pac-10 statistical race, Webb is first in
dig average, second in hitting
percentage, sixth in kills average and
ninth in ace average. Her digs average
puts her ninth in the nation.
Unlike ASU, Arizona does not boast
any one national star but will still be a
gcx)d test for the Cardinal. In fact, the
unranked Wildcats gave Stanford a
tougher time than ASU when the two
teams hosted the Cardinal in early Oc
tober, jumping on Stanford's errors to
win the second game, before losing
the last two by IS-4 scores.
Stanford came into this season with

setter Wendi Rush as its most
renowned player. However, it is the
hitter w ho thanks Rush most often for
her assists who has taken the spotlight.
Teresa Smith's play in volleyball's glorv
position, outside hitter, has won her
two Pac-10 Player of the Week awards,
something nobody else has done in
the history of Pac-10 women's volley
ball Of course, this fact would be
more impressive if this wasn't the con
ference's first vear of women's vollev
ball.

Even if Pac-10 women's volleyball
did have a long and storied past,
smith's work this fall would stand out.
She leads the conference in hitting
percentage, kills average and ace
average. The junior is also ninth in digs
average.
Smith isn't the only Cardinal among
the Pac-10 s statistical leaders. Co
captain Bar bra Fontana is fourth in digs
average. Rush is third in assists average
and Laura Olesen is fourth in bltx'k
averaae.
