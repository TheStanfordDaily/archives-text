# Cross country at District 8 qualifier
## Men, women look for top finishes 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
The city of Fresno will be pushed
into the spotlight this weekend as Stan
ford and a host of other top cross
country teams travel to central Califor
nia for the District 8 championships,
the last point on the journey to Tucson,
Ariz , and the NCAA finals.
"Ideally, both teams should ad
vance, ' Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson said. "We only haven't
defeated Oregon and Arizona for men
and Oregon for the women (this
year)."
Last week, both the Cardinal men's
and women's teams finished third in
the Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships held at the Stanford Golf Course
'If we run well Saturday, we should
be in the top three for men and top
two for women," Johnson said. To ad
vance to NCAAs. the men must place at
least third, and the women will
definitely go if they place in the top
two, possibly if they take third
This is the toughest region,
Johnson added If we get out (to the
NCAAs). we should do well."

Even if neither of the teams gets a
berth at the finals, individual runners
have the opportunity to advance. The
top three individuals not on the win
ning teams get spots at Tucson.
Two Cardinal men, seniors Marc
Olesen and Ryan Stoll, are ready for
this contingency. Olesen won the Dis
trict 8 championship last year and sub
sequently placed fourth at the NCAA
finals, making him the top scoring re
turning runner in the nation.
"The Arizona guys are tough, but
Stoll and Olesen should do well,"
Johnson said.
The women's race will be high
lighted by freshman Carol Gray, the
third-place Pac-10 finisher. Cory
Schubert, Christa Curtin and Kathv
Smith also figure to do well in the
competition.
For the women, it's going to be a
rerun of what we saw in Pac 10s. It's
going to be deja vu for some of these
kids,'' Johnson added.
Following tomorrows meet, those
members of the Cardinal squad who
advance to the NCAA finals will have
more than a week to prepare.
