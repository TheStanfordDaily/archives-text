# Stanford hosts women's tennis

### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Defending NCAA singles champion Patty Fendick will only be playing doubles,
and several other Stanford players will be out with injuries, but the
Rolex/Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Association Northern California Women's
Tennis Tournament beginning today and lasting through Sunday will be an im
portant test for at least three Stanford hopefuls.
Freshmen Lisa Green and Valerie Wilson and transfer Cindy Buchsbaum all
open their Cardinal careers today with opening-round singles matches at the Var
sin' Tennis Courts.
All three are looking to break into the loaded Stanford lineup, but, of the three,
only Green, the team's top recruit, would seem to have a reasonable chance of
doing so this season.
Green, the No. 5 seed in the singles draw, is pitted against Fresno State's Renee
Tathani in a noon match.
The winners of the singles and doubles draws this weekend will automatically
qualify for the Rolex/ITCA National Indoor Championships later in the year.
By virtue of her national ranking, Fendick has already qualified for the cham
pionships and therefore will not play singles this weekend. She will play doubles,
where she and Stephanie Savides are the No. 1 seed.
Stanford's list of casualties includes former All-America Leigh Anne Eldredge
and Fleni Rossides. Eldredge is out with a calf injury, and Rossides is still hobbled
by the stress fractures she suffered last season. "Hopefully over Christmas holiday
she'll get clearance from her doctor," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said
