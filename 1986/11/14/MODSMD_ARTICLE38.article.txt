### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Following successful seasons last
year, both the Stanford men's and
women's fencing teams will begin
the rebuilding process tomorrow as
they travel to UC-Santa Cruz for the
season opener at 1 p.m.
The women's team, which went
13-0, won the regional champion
ship and placed sixth in the NCAA
last season, must overcome the
graduation of Jennifer Yu, "the best
female fencer ever at Stanford,'' ac
cording to Stanford Coach Buzz
Hurst.
"We're not going to have another
undefeated season," Hurst said, in
dicating that the team's outlook will
depend on the development of the
Cardinal's new fencers.
The Cardinal will be led this
season by senior Holly Taylor, who

specializes in the foil. Taylor was
60-9 last year and is, according to
Hurst, "the strongest women's fen
cer in the region."
The Stanford men's team will
also be looking to replace several
fencers, most notably in the foil cat
egory, where the Cardinal
graduated its entire unit.
The Cardinal finished the 1985-
86 season 21-1 and went on to win
the regional before placing a disap
pointing 14th in the NCAA finals.
This year's squad will depend on
an experienced sabre unit, which
captured the regional champion
ship last year and, "without a doubt,
will be the strongest again" this
season, according to Hurst.
The team will rely on the sabre
squad but will also need solid per
formances across the board, Hurst
said.
