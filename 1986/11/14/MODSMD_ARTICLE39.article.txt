# Band manager tries luck as Guest Greek
## 
### 
As if the Stanford Band does not
have enough problems these days,
Manager Jeff Stevens has put the
reputation of LSJUNLMB (Leland Stan
ford Junior University No Longer
Marching Band) on the line once again
by offering to be the Guest Greek in
this week's edition of the Daily Greek
of the Week.
The logic employed in Stevens' se
lections suggest that the Band's future
could be in better hands.
In picking San Diego State to beat
Wyoming 5-4, Stevens said the Aztecs
would go for the win by kicking a field
goal in the final minutes rather than
playing for the tie by punting the ball
to Wyoming's goal line and sacking
Wyoming on the next play for a safety.
Jack Elway would be proud.
Stevens also picked Brigham Young
to beat Oregon State 2-0. The winning
margin, he said, would be a BYU safety
on the first play of the game — not two
extra points.
Finally, Stevens chose Arkansas to
defeat Texas A&M 17-14. The selection
of the Razorbacks was for his old
roommate. What a guy.
