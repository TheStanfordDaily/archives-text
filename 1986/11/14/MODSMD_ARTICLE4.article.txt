# No male contraceptive yet, prof. says

### CALISA COLE 
An acceptable male contraceptive will not be
available before the 21st century, according to the in
ventor of the birth control pill.
But better ovulation predictors and a post-coital
pill will be on the market by then, Dr. Carl Djerassi
told students last night at Adams House.
Djerassi, a professor of chemistry here, said the
delay in developing a male contraceptive is not due
to scientific barriers, but to fear by pharmaceutical
companies of malpractice suits.
He cited the example of DES, a drug given to
thousands of women in the 19505. Because some
children born to these women developed a rare
form of cancer, drug companies have been sued for
$3 billion. "Certain areas of research are not being
done now because of fear of liability," he said.

Ovulation predictors, which measure temperature
changes or test body fluids to determine fertility
during the reproductive cycle, will improve relatively
quickly because ingestion of a drug is not involved,
Djerassi said.
Such "red light-green light" tests, however, are not
entirely satisfactory because they do not take into ac
count the 72-hour lifespan of the sperm, he warned.
The post-coital pill, which induces bleeding,
would be taken by women once a month and will be
available by the mid- or late-19905, said Djerassi. This
pill would not be acceptable to those who believe
that life begins with fertilization of the egg, he added,
because the effect of the pill is like a "mini-abortion."
"There's no such thing as an ideal contraceptive,"
said Djerassi. "It's a contradiction in terms. People
have different needs at different times, depending on
their age, lifestyle, profession, personal objectives

and health.
In a question-and-answer period, Djerassi seemed
surprised that the students' questions centered
around the health effects of the Pill rather than
broader issues.
"Your questions are narrow,' he said. "For exam
ple, don't you wonder about why your options for
birth control are so limited? Your choices are
growing fewer. He pointed out that the lUD, once
widely used, is no longer available in the United
States.
When asked if he felt the Pill should be dispensed
to young teens, Djerassi said he believes the best op
tion for birth control among young people in the
United States is the condom because it gives the male
a chance to share in the responsibility for birth con
trol.
