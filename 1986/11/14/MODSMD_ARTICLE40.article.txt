## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
Medical supplies and equipment
valued at $25,000 were shipped late
Wednesday night to a private hospital
in Nicaragua, according to Mary
Navarro, coordinator of a student
group called the Palo Alto-Stanford
Medical Aid Committee for Central
America (PASMAC).
The shipment, which included an
electrocardiograph machine and car
diac drugs, cost the group $5,000. It
was sent to PASMAC's "sister hospital,"
the Bernardino Diaz Ochoa Hospital in
Granada, Nicaragua.
PASMAC and the Nicaragua Ministry
of Health selected this hospital for aid
by the Amercian group.
Unlike many other medical aid

groups, PASMAC sends its shipments
directly to specific institutions rather
than relying on the Ministry of Health
to distribute supplies.
This is not due to distrust of the min
istry, according to Navarro. The group
of six to eight graduate and medical
students prefers a more direct and per
sonal involvement with the institutions
it helps, she said.
The electrocardiograph machine
had been urgently requested by the
Bernardino Diaz Ochoa Hospital about
three weeks ago. "It was a real coup for
us to get it down there so fast," Navarro
said.
Donations from the Stanford com
munity, including an $1,800 contribu
tion from the Stanford Medical Stu
dents Association, paid for the ship
ment.
