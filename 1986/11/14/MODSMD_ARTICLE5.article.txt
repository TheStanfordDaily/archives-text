# Faculty praises CIR's efforts
## D.C. campus announced 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday unani
mously commended the Commission
on Investment Responsibility for its
selective divestment recommendations
during the past year, and University
President Donald Kennedy defended
the pace at which divestment decisions
are proceeding.
In other business, plans were an
nounced for a Washington, D.C.,
campus, the senate approved an offi
cial statement on undergraduate ad
missions policy, and the proposed site
for the Reagan Library was criticized.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz called tht
motion praising the CIR "weak," bu
added, "I suppose it's better to have i
weak motion passed than a strong mo
tion defeated."
Rebholz also charged that the pact
of divestment was slow and attributec
it to trustees' fear that the University
will lose gifts from some companies.
Kennedy said the Board of Trustee
does not have an "ulterior motive" ii
its current divestment policy but want
to make decisions based on carefu
study.
"We relate to a whole lot of com
munities who respect fairness an<
depth of analyses," he said.
Rebholz, who withheld a stronge
motion because of time constraint;

said Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
other South African leaders favor di
vestment, but that "the Pretoria gov
ernment's leverage outweighs any
leverage companies might have.''
Rebholz quoted remarks made last
week at Stanford by Coretta Scott King,
who called for total divestment.
"Divestment is a moral statement....
We have a moral obligation (to
divest)," he said.
Specific consequences of divestment
are more important than "a more
generalized abstract view of what is
right," Kennedy replied.
"I tend to look at consequences....
The broader moral consideration — is
it moral to profit — is not as important
as examining consequences," he said.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, who proposed the CIR motion,
said after the meeting, "The senate has
not had the opportunity in years to dis-
I cuss any of these (divestment) issues. I
r thought it was important (for the sen
ate) to speak clearly and positively and
> with a united voice."
i Regarding Rebholz's call for a
> stronger motion, he said: "I myself
1 would have liked to see it stronger too,
but you have to take into account senti
ments of other members.
1 "Belatedly, we're moving in the right
direction," he said. -
