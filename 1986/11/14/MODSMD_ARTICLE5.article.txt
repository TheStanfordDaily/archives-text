# Faculty praises CIR's efforts
## D.C. campus announced 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday unani
mously commended the Commission
on Investment Responsibility for its
selective divestment recommendations
during the past year, and University
President Donald Kennedy defended
the pace at which divestment decisions
are proceeding.
In other business, plans were an
nounced for a Washington, D.C.,
campus, the senate approved an offi
cial statement on undergraduate ad
missions policy, and the proposed site
for the Reagan Library was criticized.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz called tht
motion praising the CIR "weak," bu
added, "I suppose it's better to have i
weak motion passed than a strong mo
tion defeated."
Rebholz also charged that the pact
of divestment was slow and attributec
it to trustees' fear that the University
will lose gifts from some companies.
Kennedy said the Board of Trustee
does not have an "ulterior motive" ii
its current divestment policy but want
to make decisions based on carefu
study.
"We relate to a whole lot of com
munities who respect fairness an<
depth of analyses," he said.
Rebholz, who withheld a stronge
motion because of time constraint;

said Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
other South African leaders favor di
vestment, but that "the Pretoria gov
ernment's leverage outweighs any
leverage companies might have.''
Rebholz quoted remarks made last
week at Stanford by Coretta Scott King,
who called for total divestment.
"Divestment is a moral statement....
We have a moral obligation (to
divest)," he said.
Specific consequences of divestment
are more important than "a more
generalized abstract view of what is
right," Kennedy replied.
"I tend to look at consequences....
The broader moral consideration — is
it moral to profit — is not as important
as examining consequences," he said.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, who proposed the CIR motion,
said after the meeting, "The senate has
not had the opportunity in years to dis-
I cuss any of these (divestment) issues. I
r thought it was important (for the sen
ate) to speak clearly and positively and
> with a united voice."
i Regarding Rebholz's call for a
> stronger motion, he said: "I myself
1 would have liked to see it stronger too,
but you have to take into account senti
ments of other members.
1 "Belatedly, we're moving in the right
direction," he said. -
Kennedy also addressed the issue of
calling on companies to disinvest, or
pull out of South Africa.
The CIR recommended in June that
the trustees adopt a policy of disinvest
ment, and Kennedy said a trustee task
force is studying the issue.
"I believe that it is the trustees' view
that the ClR's recommendation is not
an incremental change, but a funda
mental shift in policy — and one that
deserves careful study," he said.
Kennedy also announced plans for
Stanford fellowship and training pro
grams for black South African profes
sionals and students.
Capital campus
A Washington, D.C., campus will
open next fall quarter, Provost James
Rosse announced at the meeting. The
program will provide "highly qualified
students the opportunity to draw on
Washington's unique cultural and edu
cational resources," he said.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee will chair the program
committee and will also head the

search for a director for the program,
which will open with about 15 students
and eventually will accept 30 students.
Rosse said students in the 13-week
program will serve in an internship
and work under a faculty member and
a tutor. Whether students will receive
academic credit for the internship has
not been determined, he said.
Admissions policy
The senate unanimously approved
the official statement on admissions
criteria proposed by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aid (CUAFA).
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter addressed the senate on the
possibility of discrimination against
Asian-Americans in admissions, an
issue investigated by CUAFA after an
undergraduate raised the question in a
letter to and meeting with Fetter.
Fetter said she welcomed the review
of data concerning Asian-American ad
mission rates, which have been
proportionately lower than those of
whites.
From 1982 to 1985, the Asian-
American acceptance rate was about 70
percent compared to white enroll
ments. The acceptance rate rose to 89
percent last year.

Fetter said she does not believe
there is conscious stereotyping among
admissions officers. "Admissions offi
cers are devoted human beings — who
are fallible," she said.
English Prof. John Bender, former
CUAFA chairman, said the statement
will increase faculty control of admis
sions policy "because it makes it
clearer."
Bender said the statement's discus
sion of character traits — such as
"honesty, good judgement and mag
nanimity'" — that reflect the Funda
mental Standard does not mean there
is an "obligation (for an applicant) to
prove he passes a character test."
The policy does allow for rejection
of those prospective students who
have manifestly violated the principles
set forth in the statement, according to
Bender.
"Also, it is a way to inform students
of the law (the Fundamental Standard)
that governs our community," he
added.
Reagan Library
Earlier in the meeting, Carlos
Camargo, professor of medicine, said
the proposed site of the Reagan Library
will ruin the hill behind Lake Lagunita
that is used by "hundreds" of members

of the Stanford community for their
physical and spiritual health.
The faculty's role in the develop-;
ment of the Reagan Library will be for
mally addressed at next week's senate
meeting.
"We thought it would be tucked
away in the hills as unobtrusively as the
Center for Behavioral Sciences. This is
not the case,'' Camargo said.
"I really don't want to let these asser
tions go unchallenged for even a
week," Kennedy replied. I don't
detect a single statement (in Camargo's
remarks) that is correct."

The broader moral consideration — is
it moral to profit — is not as important
as examining consequences," he said.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, who proposed the CIR motion,
said after the meeting, "The senate has
not had the opportunity in years to dis-
I cuss any of these (divestment) issues. I
r thought it was important (for the sen
ate) to speak clearly and positively and
> with a united voice."
i Regarding Rebholz's call for a
> stronger motion, he said: "I myself
1 would have liked to see it stronger too,
but you have to take into account senti
ments of other members.
1 "Belatedly, we're moving in the right
direction," he said. -
Kennedy also addressed the issue of
calling on companies to disinvest, or
pull out of South Africa.
The CIR recommended in June that
the trustees adopt a policy of disinvest
ment, and Kennedy said a trustee task
force is studying the issue.
"I believe that it is the trustees' view
that the ClR's recommendation is not
an incremental change, but a funda
mental shift in policy — and one that
deserves careful study," he said.
Kennedy also announced plans for
Stanford fellowship and training pro
grams for black South African profes
sionals and students.
Capital campus
A Washington, D.C., campus will
open next fall quarter, Provost James
Rosse announced at the meeting. The
program will provide "highly qualified
students the opportunity to draw on
Washington's unique cultural and edu
cational resources," he said.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee will chair the program
committee and will also head the

search for a director for the program,
which will open with about 15 students
and eventually will accept 30 students.
Rosse said students in the 13-week
program will serve in an internship
and work under a faculty member and
a tutor. Whether students will receive
academic credit for the internship has
not been determined, he said.
Admissions policy
The senate unanimously approved
the official statement on admissions
criteria proposed by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aid (CUAFA).
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter addressed the senate on the
possibility of discrimination against
Asian-Americans in admissions, an
issue investigated by CUAFA after an
undergraduate raised the question in a
letter to and meeting with Fetter.
Fetter said she welcomed the review
of data concerning Asian-American ad
mission rates, which have been
proportionately lower than those of
whites.
From 1982 to 1985, the Asian-
American acceptance rate was about 70
percent compared to white enroll
ments. The acceptance rate rose to 89
percent last year.

Fetter said she does not believe
there is conscious stereotyping among
admissions officers. "Admissions offi
cers are devoted human beings — who
are fallible," she said.
English Prof. John Bender, former
CUAFA chairman, said the statement
will increase faculty control of admis
sions policy "because it makes it
clearer."
Bender said the statement's discus
sion of character traits — such as
"honesty, good judgement and mag
nanimity'" — that reflect the Funda
mental Standard does not mean there
is an "obligation (for an applicant) to
prove he passes a character test."
The policy does allow for rejection
of those prospective students who
have manifestly violated the principles
set forth in the statement, according to
Bender.
"Also, it is a way to inform students
of the law (the Fundamental Standard)
that governs our community," he
added.
Reagan Library
Earlier in the meeting, Carlos
Camargo, professor of medicine, said
the proposed site of the Reagan Library
will ruin the hill behind Lake Lagunita
that is used by "hundreds" of members

of the Stanford community for their
physical and spiritual health.
The faculty's role in the develop-;
ment of the Reagan Library will be for
mally addressed at next week's senate
meeting.
"We thought it would be tucked
away in the hills as unobtrusively as the
Center for Behavioral Sciences. This is
not the case,'' Camargo said.
"I really don't want to let these asser
tions go unchallenged for even a
week," Kennedy replied. I don't
detect a single statement (in Camargo's
remarks) that is correct."
The Faculty Senate yesterday unani
mously commended the Commission
on Investment Responsibility for its
selective divestment recommendations
during the past year, and University
President Donald Kennedy defended
the pace at which divestment decisions
are proceeding.
In other business, plans were an
nounced for a Washington, D.C.,
campus, the senate approved an offi
cial statement on undergraduate ad
missions policy, and the proposed site
for the Reagan Library was criticized.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz called tht
motion praising the CIR "weak," bu
added, "I suppose it's better to have i
weak motion passed than a strong mo
tion defeated."
Rebholz also charged that the pact
of divestment was slow and attributec
it to trustees' fear that the University
will lose gifts from some companies.
Kennedy said the Board of Trustee
does not have an "ulterior motive" ii
its current divestment policy but want
to make decisions based on carefu
study.
"We relate to a whole lot of com
munities who respect fairness an<
depth of analyses," he said.
Rebholz, who withheld a stronge
motion because of time constraint;

said Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
other South African leaders favor di
vestment, but that "the Pretoria gov
ernment's leverage outweighs any
leverage companies might have.''
Rebholz quoted remarks made last
week at Stanford by Coretta Scott King,
who called for total divestment.
"Divestment is a moral statement....
We have a moral obligation (to
divest)," he said.
Specific consequences of divestment
are more important than "a more
generalized abstract view of what is
right," Kennedy replied.
"I tend to look at consequences....
The broader moral consideration — is
it moral to profit — is not as important
as examining consequences," he said.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
