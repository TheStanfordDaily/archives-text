# Daniloff set to speak on campus
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
Nicholas Daniloff, the Moscow cor
respondent for U.S. News & World
Report who was held by the Soviet Un
ion in September under charges of
espionage, will definitely speak at
Stanford Thursday, according to the
chairman of the ASSU's finance com
mittee.
Steven Hellman, chairman of the stu
dent senate's Budget and Finance
Committee, said that while the ASSU
has not made a final decision on the
Daniloff speech, the reservations held
by the ASSU about the visit have been
cleared up.
"It is the intention of the senate, of
my committee and of the COP
(Council of Presidents)" that Daniloff
speak on campus next week, Hellman
said.
A final decision should be reached
by tomorrow, Hellman said.
On Tuesday, the ASSU rejected a re
quest by the Speakers Bureau to pay a
$5,715 share of a $10,000 honorarium

for Daniloff, arguing that the fee was
too high. But Daniloff lowered his re
quest to $8,500, and the senate's share
is now about $3,500.
Hellman's committee can supply the
Speakers Bureau with the appropriate
funds without the full consent of the
ASSU.
Most of the remainder of the
honorarium will he paid by the Office
of Student Affairs and the Wilbur Fel
lows.
Many senators worried that
Daniloffs initial honorarium was too
high to pay for a one-time speaking en
gagement, Hellman said. Daniloff,
however, will make at least one other
speech and attend several smaller dis
cussions.
Otero resident Sanjeev Khagram,
who originally contacted Daniloff, said
yesterday that after the Thursday
speech, Daniloff will spend the night at
Wilbur Hall. On Friday morning,
Daniloff will breakfast with the Knight
Journalism fellows, do research at the
Hoover Institution and speak again at
Wilbur from 5-7 p.m.
