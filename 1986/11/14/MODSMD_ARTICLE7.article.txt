Like components of a binary weapon, graduate students
and beer combined last night with explosive results as Stan
ford's new student pub, Cardinal Sin, celebrated its opening
night.
"It's working out great," said a beleaguered Dave Krieg
man, co-manager of the pub and social chairman of the
Graduate Student Association. "I'm amazed how many
people there are. Our assumption was correct — there is a
need on campus for a place students can party.
Cardinal Sin opened at 8 p.m. last night By 11, every table
was full, 30 students stood in line for beer, a queue of 40
waited outside for patrons to leave and doorman/bouncer
Chris Scholl estimated that 3SO people had walked through
the doors in the pub's first three hours.
Fire codes limited the crowd in Encina Station to 130 at a
time.
"The pub serves a real need for the graduate commu
nity," said Kelly Mays, a doctoral student in English.
"It's a better atmosphere than the Coffee House," said pe
troleum engineering graduate student Danny Grasman.
The pub serves many kinds of beer — on tap and in
bottles and also offers several wines, soft drinks, and cof
fee tea and hot chocolate. Pizza, pretzels, peanuts, burritos

and free popcorn highlight the menu.
Graduate students dominated the pub in the early hours,
but after 10 p.m. undergraduates began pouring in.
"Drinking is something we do, so we might as well do it
on campus," said senior Laura Blanklev.
I think the planner should be nominated for a Dean's
Service Award, said senior Phil Nakashima, between sips of
his draft Heineken.
We ve been waiting too king to get a place like this on
campus," added junior Duncan Ross.
There were some glaring problems noted on opening
night, however.
Students complained about small pitchers, long lines for
beer, a ptxir sound system and the cafeteria environment.
Its kind of like bars on the moon — no atmosphere,
said Scott San Filippo, a junior.
The furniture sucks, but the beers good, agreed senior
Gregg Shapiro.
Council ot Presidents member Rudy Fuentes said the pub
provides the kind of place students are looking for but
noted that it needs more variety of food."
Shelly Lawrence, a sophomore, said she was glad that stu
dents who are under 21 can "still be part of it." Students
with Stanford IDs can gain entrance to the pub, but will not
be served alcohol unless they are 21 or over.
"Maybe we can get the grad students more energetic,
since they seem to be pretty dead," Lawrence said.
