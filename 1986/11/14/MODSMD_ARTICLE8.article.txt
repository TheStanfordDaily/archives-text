Philippine labor leader slain
MANILA, Philippines — A prominent leftist labor leader was kidnapped,
tortured and murdered yesterday, less than 48 hours after he had called on
the 800,000 members of his union to defend President Corazon Aquino's
government against a threatened military coup.
Leaders of leftist political parties blamed the slaying of the labor leader,
Rolando Olalia, 50, on military supporters of Defense Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile, whose men are reportedly planning a coup.
To protest the slayings, the leftist political leaders said that they would
mobilize tens of thousands of peasants and laborers today in the streets
outside Camp Aguinaldo, the military base where Enrile's office is located.
The military denied involvement in Olalia's killing, and a spokesman
said that the case was under investigation.
Members of Olalia's family and police investigators said that Olalia was
last seen as he left a labor meeting Wednesday night. His body was found
24 hours later. He had been shot twice in the body and four times in the
head and stabbed repeatedly. His hands were tied, and a newspaper had
been stuffed in his mouth.
Two days before his death, at a press conference, Olalia and several
other People's Party leaders had called for a nationwide strike and protest
action to support Aquino in the event of an attempt by Enrile's supporters
to undertake a coup while she was out of the country.
According to military commanders and two presidential advisers, the
coup appeared to have been averted at the last minute Monday afternoon,
just after Aquino's departure for Japan.
Group seeks boycott in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The United Democratic Front, South
Africa's largest anti-apartheid organization, called yesterday for Christmas
to be observed as a period of "national unity," with a boycott of white
owned stores to protest the state of emergency.
Murphy Morobe, the front's publicity secretary, said that during the 10
days starting Dec. 16 the organization would ask "the people to rededicate
themselves to the struggle for national liberation" as part of a countrywide
mobilization to counter the impact of emergency rule, now starting its
sixth month.
The observance is an effort by the United Democratic Front, a coalition
of 700 anti-apartheid groups with about 3 million members nationwide, to
reassert its leadership in the black community after being virtually forced
underground by the police. Morobe said that the observance of "Christmas
against the emergency" will unite the black community but avoid con
frontation with the police.
Since the imposition of emergency rule June 12, anti-apartheid groups
have found it increasingly difficult to challenge the government. They have
been all but prohibited from holding meetings; most of their top leaders
have either been detained or are in hiding, and the student protests that
gave them much of their momentum have been halted.
The front's only major success in recent months has been the growing
rent strike in the country's black ghettos — a popular issue now supported
by an estimated 4 million ghetto residents in more than 60 communities.
Center releases new AIDS study
WASHINGTON — Federal health officials, citing a new study of two
"social-sexual" clubs that supports the danger of heterosexual transmission
of AIDS, again warned yesterday that the risk of AIDS "increases for per
sons who have multiple sexual partners."
The Atlanta-based federal Centers for Disease Control reported that the
Minnesota Department of Health tested 134 persons, including 59 women,
in two "swing clubs" and found that two of the women were infected with
the AIDS virus. CDC said the 3 percent rate among the women tested was
"significantly higher" than the 0 percent found in 56,000 female blood
donors in the state.
Thus far, only about 4 percent of the 27,519 reported cases of AIDS in
this country have been attributed to heterosexual transmission. AIDS is
believed to have begun in the United States within the homosexual popula
tion and has been largely confined to homosexual and bisexual men. It has
also afflicted intravenous drug users who share contaminated hypodermic
needles.
Experts, however, have repeatedly stressed that AIDS is a sexually trans
mitted disease that can be spread by both homosexual and heterosexual
activity. Further, they have said that sex with multiple partners increases
the likelihood that an individual will come into contact with an infected
person.
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a virus that
destroys the body's immune system, leaving it powerless against certain
cancers and otherwise rare infections. It can also invade the central ner
vous system, causing severe neurological disorders. Thus far, it has killed
15,445 persons in this country.
Jacobsen will help negotiations
ORANGE — Former hostage David Jacobsen said yesterday that he
would travel to London with two other former captives of Shia Moslems
terrorists in an attempt to help with negotiations for the release of the
remaining Americans being held in Lebanon.
At his first news conference since returning home to Huntington Beach
in Southern California, Jacobsen, 55, said that he did not plan to return to
Lebanon but added that he would go there if it meant the safe release of
more hostages.
Jacobsen refused to talk about the negotiations that led to his release. He
did say, however, that he knew nothing about the arms deals between the
Reagan administration and the government of Iran.
Jacobsen, speaking to scores of reporters crowded into a hotel ballroom
in the city of Orange, 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles, said he had not
been mistreated during his 531 days of captivity.
Rhine suffers from poison waste
SCHWEIZERHALLE, Switzerland — As workers in gas masks cleared the
charred wreckage of two chemical storehouses, the stench of pesticide still
hung heavy in the air here yesterday, 12 days after a fire that led to what ap
parently was the worst poisonous-waste spill in Europe in a decade.
Nobody was killed in the accident, but a stretch of about 200 miles of the
upper Rhine has suffered serious ecological damage, according to Swiss
and West German experts. The chemicals — mostly pesticides and her
bicides, including a particularly toxic mercury-based compound — caused
less damage farther downstream as they progressively were diluted.
It was unclear whether the spill had left the upper Rhine "biologically
dead." Initial tests yielded mixed results as to whether the spill had killed
the microorganisms that play a crucial role in the river's self-cleansing
process.
The accident has been widely described as the worst waste spill in
Europe since poisonous dioxin was released in Seveso, Italy, by a plant of
another Swiss chemical giant, F. Hoffmann La Roche & Co., in 1976.
Alzheimer's disease gene copied
WASHINGTON — Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have
isolated and copied the gene whose product is associated with progressive
destruction of brain tissue in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
This finding, reported during the annual meeting of the Society for
Neuroscience, may supply the missing link in understanding how and why
this dementing and ultimately fatal disease occurs, according to John Mor
rison. an Alzheimer's expert at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation
in San Diego.
The surprise, researchers said, is that the product of the gene, a protein
called amyloid, is a normal constituent of the brain that may somehow ac
cumulate abnormallv.
