# Reagan defends Iran policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, defending his
actions as legal and in the nation's best interest,
conceded yesterday that he authorized a secret oper
ation that sent arms to Iran and resulted in the
release of American hostages held in Lebanon.
But the president, in a televised address from the
Oval Office, branded as "utterly false" charges that
the United States had shipped the weapons to Iran as
ransom payment for the hostages and had violated
American policy against trafficking with terrorists.
"The United States has not made concessions to
those who hold our people captive in Lebanon,"
Reagan declared. "And we will not. The United States
has not swapped boatloads of American weapons for
the return of American hostages. And we will not."
The president, denying news reports that
planeloads of arms had been sent to Iran, said that
only small amounts of defensive weapons and spare
parts for defensive systems had been delivered. The
purpose of these shipments, he added, was to con
vince Iranian officials that American negotiators were
acting with his authority and to send a signal to Teh
ran that the United States was prepared to replace the
animosity between the two countries with a new rela

tionship.
Other administration sources have described the
operation as an arms-for-hostages trade that was con
ceived by Robert McFarlane when he was Reagan's
national security adviser and carried out by
McFarlane and his successor, Adm. John Poindexter.
And, despite the president's denial of such a swap,
evidence indicates that the arms shipments occurred
in close proximity to the release of individual
hostages. For example, one administration official
yesterday cited the release of the Rev. Benjamin Weir
on Sept. 8, 1985, which occurred about the same
time that a shipment of military hardware was
delivered to Iran.
Although emphasizing the strategic importance of
Iran as the major reason for the operation, Reagan
also listed release of the hostages as a major goal and
said American negotiators indicated to the Iranians
that the most significant step they could take in im
proving relations would be to use their influence in
Lebanon "to secure the release of all hostages held
there."
Still, he insisted that no concessions were made
for the return of the hostages. However, a senior ad

minstration official, briefing reporters on back
ground before the president's speech, said that
Reagan had focused on the plight of the hostages in
discussions before authorizing the shipment of arms.
Reagan, confirming many details of news reports
that have touched off a firestorm of criticism of the
administration, noted that it had been widely re
ported that the Congress, as well as top Executive
Branch officials, had been circumvented in the plan
ning and execution of the secret operation.
"Although the efforts we undertook were highly
sensitive and involvement of government officials
was limited to those with a strict need to know, he
said, "all appropriate Cabinet officers were fully con
sulted. The actions 1 authorized were, and continue
to be, in full compliance with federal law — and the
relevant committees of Congress are being and will
be fully informed."
