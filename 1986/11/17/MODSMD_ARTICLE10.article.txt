# Shultz: More Iran deals unneeded
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz
said yesterday that he sees no need for further arms
shipments to enhance U.S. contact with Iran but ac
knowledged that he may not speak for the Reagan ad
ministration on the subject.
Making little effort to camouflage his disagreement
with the administration, President Reagan's top
diplomatic adviser said his knowledge of the opera
tion was "fragmentary at best," that the shipments
were engineered by Reagan's national security advi
ser, Vice Adm. John Poindexter, as "designated hit
ter," and that their value to U.S. interests was
"debatable."
"We gave a signal and the signal has been given,
and, as far as I'm concerned, I don't see any need for
further signals," Shultz said in an extraordinary ex
hange on CBS News' "Face the Nation." Asked if he
had authority to speak for the administration, Shultz
replied firmly and emphatically: "No."
He repeatedly avoided use of the term "arms," re
ferring to the shipments as a "signal."
Shultz raised questions about the effectiveness of
the policy, noting that it was "reasonably clear" that
the three Americans most recently kidnapped in
Beirut were taken by pro-Iranian groups and
repeatedly referring to Iran's continuing pursuit of
terrorism.
Meanwhile, in an apparent effort to extend an olive
branch to angry members of Congress, Poindexter
said that the administration is "anxious" to discuss
the secret operation with congressional oversight
committees.
In an appearance on NBC News' "Meet the Press,"
Poindexter said CIA Director William Casey will lay

out details this week when the Senate Select Commit
tee on Intelligence plans to convene the first of what
is expected to be an exhaustive series of hearings.
Poindexter said he does not intend to participate
in the hearing, but will speak "informally" with mem
bers of Congress. A senior administration official said
Poindexter wanted to avoid setting a precedent by
giving testimony as a national security adviser.
Poindexter's offer, however, suggests that the ad
ministration wishes to avoid an executive-privilege
confrontation amid the clamor for answers on the
arms shipment, including why the secret operation
was conducted without advance notice to Congress
or the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in the face of opposi
tion from Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
Poindexter said the Joint Chiefs were not made
aware of the arms deal because "this was not a mili
tary operation." He avoided commenting on Shultz's
widely reported misgivings.
The clandestine operation, designed by Poindex
ter and Casey and set in motion inside the White
House without concurrence of the administration's
top diplomatic and military advisers, underscores a
growing rift in the administration. Intelligence offi
cials have played an increasingly powerful role in
foreign policy, to the consternation of State and
Defense department officials.
Poindexter explained the Iran episode as the work
of "an active president who likes and feels that bold
action is often required in order to change the status
quo." Congressional critics have called the operation
a blatant violation of the law, however, and Shultz

made clear yesterday his distaste for the policy end
run.
Shultz has been largely silent in the wake of public
disclosures that the administration authorized ship
ment of two planeloads of weapons and spare parts
to what have been described as "moderate" elements
in Iran. On Friday his office said he was "not directly
involved" and was only "sporadically informed"
about the operation.
Sunday, in his most extensive comments on the
controversy, Shultz said Reagan approved the ship
ment as a "signal" of his desire for better relations
with Iran.
Shultz said that Iran "has and continues to pursue
a policy of terrorism," and that U.S. policy against
trading arms with terrorist nations remains in place.
Shultz declined to say what advice he gave Reagan
when the operation was initially discussed. Asked if
he had considered resigning, he responded, "Oh, I
talked to the president. I serve at his pleasure, and
anything that I have to say on that subject I'd just say
to him."
Poindexter said the administration does "not feel it
in our national interest to allow the floodgates to be
thrown open to allow arms to be shipped," but he
did not state unequivocally that no more arms would
be shipped to Iran.
Although Reagan said in his national address last
week that the arms shipment was not a direct attempt
to free American hostages, Poindexter said, "The fact
remains that the moderate elements that we were
talking to, we think, did have some impact on stop
ping the hostage-taking in Lebanon for about a year."

"debatable."
"We gave a signal and the signal has been given,
and, as far as I'm concerned, I don't see any need for
further signals," Shultz said in an extraordinary ex
hange on CBS News' "Face the Nation." Asked if he
had authority to speak for the administration, Shultz
replied firmly and emphatically: "No."
He repeatedly avoided use of the term "arms," re
ferring to the shipments as a "signal."
Shultz raised questions about the effectiveness of
the policy, noting that it was "reasonably clear" that
the three Americans most recently kidnapped in
Beirut were taken by pro-Iranian groups and
repeatedly referring to Iran's continuing pursuit of
terrorism.
Meanwhile, in an apparent effort to extend an olive
branch to angry members of Congress, Poindexter
said that the administration is "anxious" to discuss
the secret operation with congressional oversight
committees.
In an appearance on NBC News' "Meet the Press,"
Poindexter said CIA Director William Casey will lay

out details this week when the Senate Select Commit
tee on Intelligence plans to convene the first of what
is expected to be an exhaustive series of hearings.
Poindexter said he does not intend to participate
in the hearing, but will speak "informally" with mem
bers of Congress. A senior administration official said
Poindexter wanted to avoid setting a precedent by
giving testimony as a national security adviser.
Poindexter's offer, however, suggests that the ad
ministration wishes to avoid an executive-privilege
confrontation amid the clamor for answers on the
arms shipment, including why the secret operation
was conducted without advance notice to Congress
or the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in the face of opposi
tion from Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
Poindexter said the Joint Chiefs were not made
aware of the arms deal because "this was not a mili
tary operation." He avoided commenting on Shultz's
widely reported misgivings.
The clandestine operation, designed by Poindex
ter and Casey and set in motion inside the White
House without concurrence of the administration's
top diplomatic and military advisers, underscores a
growing rift in the administration. Intelligence offi
cials have played an increasingly powerful role in
foreign policy, to the consternation of State and
Defense department officials.
Poindexter explained the Iran episode as the work
of "an active president who likes and feels that bold
action is often required in order to change the status
quo." Congressional critics have called the operation
a blatant violation of the law, however, and Shultz

made clear yesterday his distaste for the policy end
run.
Shultz has been largely silent in the wake of public
disclosures that the administration authorized ship
ment of two planeloads of weapons and spare parts
to what have been described as "moderate" elements
in Iran. On Friday his office said he was "not directly
involved" and was only "sporadically informed"
about the operation.
Sunday, in his most extensive comments on the
controversy, Shultz said Reagan approved the ship
ment as a "signal" of his desire for better relations
with Iran.
Shultz said that Iran "has and continues to pursue
a policy of terrorism," and that U.S. policy against
trading arms with terrorist nations remains in place.
Shultz declined to say what advice he gave Reagan
when the operation was initially discussed. Asked if
he had considered resigning, he responded, "Oh, I
talked to the president. I serve at his pleasure, and
anything that I have to say on that subject I'd just say
to him."
Poindexter said the administration does "not feel it
in our national interest to allow the floodgates to be
thrown open to allow arms to be shipped," but he
did not state unequivocally that no more arms would
be shipped to Iran.
Although Reagan said in his national address last
week that the arms shipment was not a direct attempt
to free American hostages, Poindexter said, "The fact
remains that the moderate elements that we were
talking to, we think, did have some impact on stop
ping the hostage-taking in Lebanon for about a year."
