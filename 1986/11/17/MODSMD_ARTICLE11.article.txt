# Pardon for Hasenfus is unlikely
## 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Justice
Minister Rodrigo Reyes yesterday
rejected the possibility of pardoning
American Eugene Hasenfus, who drew
30 years in prison for his part in a
weapons delivery flight to U.S.-backed
contra rebels.
"There is no reason to pardon him,"
Reyes told The Associated Press by
telephone the day after a political court
handed down the verdict and the sen
tence. "The Nicaraguan penitentiary
system will guarantee that he fulfills his
sentence."
Earlier remarks by President Daniel
Ortega had fed speculation that
Hasenfus, 45, of Marinette, Wis., might
eventually be pardoned.
Ortega has not commented on the
case since the American mercenary
was convicted and his stand on a possi
ble pardon is not known.

Reyes, chief prosecutor in the case,
said, "If a pardon is applicable, I am
sure there will be a rejection by the
population and the authorities would
have to explain that step very well."
Pro-government newspapers yester
day billed the verdict against Hasenfus
as a conviction of the United States as
well.
"The 30 years for Hasenfus are a
penalty for Yankee interventionism,"
El Nuevo Diario said.
It quoted unidentified Nicaraguan
legal authorities as saying, "This sen
tence should hit the eardrums of Presi
dent Reagan (who should) observe
that his obstinate intention of destroy
ing the revolution will have severe
responses."
The government earlier rejected a
contra offer to swap 30 Sandinista

prisoners for Hasenfus and five other
captives.
The sentence handed down Satur
day by the three-member People's
Tribunal includes the maximum 30
years in prison for violating the main
tenance of order and public security
and the maximum three years for crim
inal association, with the sentences to
be served concurrently.
The 30 years also includes an un
specified sentence on a charge of ter
rorism, which carries a maximum two
year penalty.
Hasenfus was the lone survivor
when Sandinista forces in southern
Nicaragua on Oct. 2 shot down a C-123
plane he said was carrying small arms
and ammunition to U.S.-backed rebels.
The American pilot and co-pilot and
a Nicaraguan radio man were killed.
Hasenfus was captured a day later, after

parachuting from the burning aircraft.
Hasenfus on Saturday told the court
he wanted to appeal the sentence. His
Nicaraguan attorney, Enrique Sotelo
Borgen, said after the sentencing that
he did not know if he would appeal.
Presidential spokesman Manuel
Espinoza said yesterday that for the
time being, Hasenfus will not be
allowed to give interviews.
In Washington, a White House
spokesman, Donald Mathes, said Satur
day: "The outcome was decided before
the trial even started. It served no pur
pose other than to make propaganda."
State Department spokesman Pete
Martinez said, "The Nicaraguan gov
ernment's treatment of Mr. Hasenfus
violated many of his basic due process
rights under both international and
Nicaraguan law."
