# Flory honored for human rights work
## 
### EUGENIA LEAN 
The Bay Area Council for Soviet Jews
will present for the first time an award
honoring the late Paul Flory, Stanford
chemistry professor and Nobel
laureate, for his contributions on be
half of human rights, particularly for
Soviet Jews and dissidents.
"Paul was a leader in the struggle for
human rights and scientific freedom in
the Soviet Union," said Lillian
Freeman, president of the council's
board.
On Nov. 22, 1986, a plaque com
memorating the Paul J. Flory Memorial
Award will be presented to the wife of
the late professor, the first recipient of
the annual award. The presentation
will take place at the council's annual
benefit dinner at the Fairmont Hotel in
San Francisco.
The group that established ,
award, the Bay Area Council for Sovier
Jews, hopes to achieve the release of
all Jews who wish to leave the Soviet
Union. The council works on improv
ing and protecting the human rights of
Jews remaining in the Soviet Union.
The council chose to name the
award after Flory because of his work
in the human rights movement, espe
cially with the refuseniks and dissidents

in the Soviet Union. Flory led
thousands of scientists in international
protest against Soviet persecution of
jews and human rights activists by
boycotting joint research and other
work between Western and Soviet sci
entists. He was adamantly against the
cessation of the moratorium with the
Soviet scientists, and he successfully
fought to continue this moratorium.
He once offered himself as a hostage
to the Soviet government in return for
Western medical treatment for Yelena
Bonner, wife of dissident Nobel
physicist, Andrei Sakharov. His offer,
however, was refused.
In addition to his humanitarian ef
forts, Flory was a renowned chemist.
The son of a minister, he won the
Nobel prize in 1974 for what the
Swedish Academy called epoch
making achievements in polymer
{haf the plas
tics industry.
"Paul Flory successfully set a stan
dard for other scientists to follow, es
pecially since he was a Nobel
laureate," David Waksberg of the Bay
Area Council for Soviet Jews said.
The plaque will be awarded an
nually to those making significant con
tributions to human rights. It will not
necessarily be awarded to a scientist.
