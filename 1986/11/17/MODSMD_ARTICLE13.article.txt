# Amnesty looks at Chile

### JON SCHRAGER 
The Stanford chapter of Amnesty International last
Thursday combined first-hand descriptions of the human
rights situation in Chile with examples of Chilean art and
culture.
Part of a four-month series, the program featured two
Stanford students from Chile who cited examples of in
humane treatment of citizens by the Chilean government.
Eduardo Engel, a Stanford graduate student from Chile
cited a recent increase in mass round-ups in poor neighbor
hoods, multiple arrests of "prisoners of conscience. A pris
oner of conscience is someone whose only crime was
speaking against the Pinochet government.
Since the Sept. 7 assassination attempt on Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's life, "you have the appearance of death squads,
Engel told a crowd of approximately 100 at the Oak Lounge
in Tresidder Union.
The death of 19-year-old Rodrigo Rojas De Negri is an ex
ample of the deteriorating human rights situation in Chile,
according to Engel. Negri was beaten and set on fire by
Chilean soldiers last July, Engel said.
Both Engel and fellow graduate student Claudio Dib of
fered reasons for what they described as an increase in
human rights violations in Chile.
There have been national protests since May in the form
of workers striking, workers purposely show ing up late for
work and people banging pots and pans late at night. These
national protests have prompted the government to censor
magazines, radio stations and newspapers, as well as to ar
rest those who express their opinions too loudly, Engel and
Dib said.
Amnesty International displayed the brighter side of
Chilean life with its cultural presentation.
The glimpses of culture were an attempt "to show Chile
as a nation like our own," said Sharon Green, Amnesty In

ternational (AI) coordinator at Stanford.
The presentation of Chilean art included a performance
by the musical group Kamaanchaka and a poetry reading by
Fernando Alegria accompanied by guitarist Rafael Mandri
quez.
Thursday's event was pan of a four-month-long effort to
increase consciousness about human rights violations in
Chile perpetrated by the government there.
AI seeks to accomplish three goals during the campaign,
according to Nick Rizza, San Francisco chapter coordinator
for AI.
These goals are: to make people aware of the human
rights violations in Chile, to pressure the Pinochet govern
ment into releasing "prisoners of conscience," and to ex
press Al's solidarity with groups fighting for human rights in
Chile.
In addition to sponsoring publicity events like Thursday's
program in order achieve these goals, AI plans to organize
letter-writing campaigns, publish articles and sponsor other
publicity events about the human rights violations, Rizza
said.
But throughout this campaign AI will refrain, as it has in
the past, from taking sides on the political issues involved.
Nor will the group denounce the Pinochet government, he
said.
"We don't deal with censorship or elections.... We don't
take a position on such issues as apartheid itself,
monarchies or the political situation in Iran," Rizza said.
Instead, AI is "concerned with getting people out of jail
who are imprisoned because of their political beliefs. If we
were able to stop free speech violations and release those
prisoners of concience' in South Africa, then even apartheid
would fall," he said.
Students interested in becoming involved in AI activities
such as human rights discussions and letter-writing cam
paigns are urged to attend an AI meeting, Green said.
