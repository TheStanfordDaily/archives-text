There is an overwhelmingly prevalent attitude in the
United States that one can do anything, however hideous
and inhumane, to an animal as long as that work is in the
name of science or improvement of human life. The
United States has humane laws for pets and wild animals,
but, for the 70-80 million laboratory animals used an
nually in the United States, there is scarcely any protec
tion from whatever kind of torture a researcher deems
scientifically interesting.
Very clearly, researchers have made great advances in
medicine, psychology and other fields solely because
animals have been used in experimentation. Equally
clearly, there is no foolproof alternative on the horizon
in such vital areas as cardiovascular and cancer research.
Animal research is an unfortunate necessity in the
foreseeable future. There are, however, several steps that
can be taken at both the institutional and national levels
in order to bring the use of experimental animals under
control.
Like many research institutions, Stanford has a board
to review and approve every proposal for research in
volving laboratory animals. This may seem a good solu
tion until one realizes that the University — which has a
great interest in keeping research vigorous and the grant
money flowing — appoints the members of the panel.
The voting members are: five faculty members who work
with animals regularly, the director of the Animal Re
search Facility, two veterinarians, a biologist, a student
and two others, who last year were the chaplain of the
medical school and a law professor.
It is obvious whose voice is missing — that of the non
researcher whose interest is primarily in the animals'
welfare. One need not be a scientist to know when an

animal is suffering and to say that an experiment must
not take place. The addition of at least one panel mem
ber whose expertise is in animal welfare would also help
to pressure the University to search for alternatives to
animal research and not to duplicate experiments. In ad
dition, this revised board should design a policy that
prohibits the University from requiring students to
vivisect animals.
On a national level, the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) maintains guidelines for animal use and is respon
sible for providing federal research grants. Recent expo
sure of shocking experimentation at Columbia Univer
sity and the University of Pennsylvania shows that the
agency is not doing all it could to monitor proper use of
animals. Further proof of the NlH's ineffectiveness is that
the agency has suspended Stanford's funding in recent
years, yet research seems to have continued unabated.
The NIH needs to step up its random, unannounced
inspection of animal facilities, to push for development
of alternatives to use of animals — perhaps through a fin
ancial reward system — and to eliminate animal work
that is not essential or designed to make serious ad
vances in medicine.
These are small steps that could make a big difference
in the lives of countless animals, whose suffering is no
smaller or less significant than that of humans. Some
movement to reform animal experimentation is neces
sary if the United States — and Stanford — are to be
known as the most ethical as well as the most advanced
and productive places of research. As Mahatma Gandhi
said, "The greatness of a nation and its moral progress
can be judged by the way its animals are treated." It's
time to make some progress.
