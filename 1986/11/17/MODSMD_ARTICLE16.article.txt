Vienna program
inspired students
Will the Viennese Ball become a
rootless artifact, unrelated to the
culture that inspired it? If the Stanford
campus in Vienna dies unnoticed, this
could well be the case. Clearly there
are problems with the program: The
points mentioned in a recent article
(Daily, Nov. 10) regarding low enroll
ment, a poorly structured program,
etc., are weak aspects, but they are not
tfcie only aspects. From the viewpoint
of the general public It looks as if the
Vienna campus has been allowed to
decline over the last few years without
most of those concerned being
notified, and that apathy and passivity
on the part of organizational elements
allowed this to happen.
Clearly, students support the exis
tence of the campus. The two students
on the Overseas Studies Committee
voted to maintain it, and the student
interviewed, along with the many
others who attended the center,
report positive experiences. The
decision also affects the students who
had planned to go to Vienna and now
no longer have the chance. Apparently
the decision took place in back rooms
— there were no discussions between
the University and the student body in
general.
The Vienna campus should not be
closed without a discussion and with
out seeking alternatives. Basic reforms
in structure may be necessary, but not
impossible. The Vienna center could
coordinate with the new Poland Pro
gram, perhaps launching students off
to Poland after spring quarter. Maybe
this would involve a reformation of
the campus as a part-time rather than
a full-time program. Why not take
advantage of valuable established
connections in Vienna and of Vienna's
cultural possibilities in order to set up
internships in theater, music and art
for humanities students? We find the
statement that "as far as cultural
wealth, Berlin is head and shoulders
above Vienna" completely out of
place. Cultural environments cannot
be compared in this way. Austrian
culture has a nature all its own, far
different from that of Berlin. The
Vienna experience stimulated enough
interest and excitement in students
that they returned to start traditions
like Austria Week and the Viennese
Ball. How many other overseas
campuses have inspired an active and
involved response such as this?

University should
reconsider decision
We would like to express our disap
pointment with the recent decision
made to close the Stanford program
in Vienna. We find it hard to under
stand why Stanford must shed such a
valuable resource.
As a seat of the United Nations,
Vienna has been a center for discus
sion of world politics. It is home to
high tech firms. It is certainly a
renowned center of culture. Endless
opportunities await Stanford students
in Vienna. In the spring of 1984,
Rudulf Kirschlager, then President of
Austria, visited Stanford University in
the course of a state visit, and when

he returned to Austria, he visited the
Stanford center in Vienna, invited
Stanford students for an informal
discussion and gave them an informal
tour of the Austrian presidential
offices. There is obviously great inter
est on Austria's part to keep the
Vienna program alive.
Stanford-in-Vienna has gifted and
dedicated teachers who spend lots of
time with students, incorporating
classroom learning with the "real
thing" through tours of governmental
institutions and museums, in addition
to field trips to the East Bloc. One
does not get this on the Farm. The
student living situation in Vienna is
the ideal 1 iritegrati6n into the foreign
culture. No villa enclave is this. Stan
ford students live with Austrian stu
dents in the University of Vienna
dormitories (which also house many
international students who choose to
study in Vienna). Students must buy
their food in the city and take the
streetcar or subway to classes. The
immersion in the culture is un
avoidable. The opportunity to study at
the University of Vienna is available
for those with the appropriate level of
German.
We would cite lack of promotion of
the Vienna program as its main prob
lem. We find it sad that Stanford Uni
versity is not willing to put more
energy into the program. And yet the
energy that comes out of the Stanford
student experience in Vienna sur
passes that of any other overseas
campus. Austria Week and the annual
Viennese Ball at Stanford were begun
by students returning from the Vienna
program.
Budgetary constraints have been
mentioned as the main reason for
closing the campus. We are all for the
expansion of the Stanford Overseas
Studies Program to Poland, Japan and
other areas of the globe. Yet Stanford
and the United States still have a
vested interest in Central Europe.
Vienna (the capital of a neutral
country) and Berlin (a divided city
surrounded by East Germany) repre
sent two very different experiences in
that area. Oi ° is not a substitute for
the other.
The Centennial fund-raising effort is
coming up. Why can't a better solution
be found than severing Stanford's ties
with Austria? Please save Stanford-in-
Vienna.

Fac Sen should
discuss shutdown
We were distressed to read recent u
that the Vienna campus will be perma
nently closed (Daily, Nov. 10), espe
cially since the reasons cited for its
closure are, in our opinion, mis
guided, implausible, and resolvable.
As two students who studied in Vienna
last year, we feel that the Overseas
Program Committee has not ade
quately evaluated the situation and the
reasons it has given should not be
accepted at face value by the members
of the Stanford community.
This committee claims low student
enrollment and weak curriculum as
two of the main problems Agreed, the
student population is low in compari
son with other more popular
campuses, like Oxford and Florence,
but we feel that the quality of our

overseas experience was optimal with
the average "low" enrollment.
However, if the University faces cer
tain economic constraints inherent in
not "filling" the Vienna campus, there
are steps that can be taken that would
produce more interest in the pro
gram.
There are many international rela
tions and political science majors here
whose concentration is East-West
relations, and Vienna, as a neutral
country nestled in the Eastern Bloc, is
ideally situated for studying this sub
ject. Our experience with the
reportedly "weak curriculum" was
that it offered a valuable change from
the American approach to East-West
relations. Additionally, the courses in
art, opera, symphony and theater are
an ideal introduction to Austrian
culture. Therefore, we feel that the
curriculum is solid and that the main
problem is the lack of awareness of
Vienna's unique international position
as a bridge between East and West, an
aspect not found in the charged politi
cal atmosphere of Berlin.
Poor administration of the program
is another gripe. Well, the professors
recruited by Vienna's staff are
knowledgeable, enthusiastic and come
from diverse European backgrounds.
Furthermore, the head of the program
and her staff infuse the students with
an amazing enthusiasm for life in
Vienna, and we believe that Stanford
cannot hope to find another group of
people so well suited for administer
ing an overseas campus.
OK, let's talk cash. The committee
claims that budgetary constraints
prevent it from maintaining a Vienna
campus. It's difficult to reconcile this
excuse with reality. Stanford can
afford a new campus in Kyoto, Japan.
Stanford can afford two campuses in
France. Stanford is in the midst of a $1
billion fund drive. Stanford is building
like there's no tomorrow. Certainly a
sincere effort on the part of the Over
seas Office to locate the funds should
be successful considering the
relatively meager needs of the Vienna
program in comparison with certain
other overseas campuses.
Finally there is the most im
probable and insulting excuse pro
posed by the committee: The Univer
sity does not need two programs in
German-speaking countries. Ignoring
the fact that there are other countries,
let alone language areas, that possess
more than one program, maintaining
that Berlin and Vienna are inter
changeable on a language basis is
ludicrous. That's like saying hypotheti
cally that we don't need a campus in
both New York and London because
English is spoken in both places.
Anybody who has spent time in either
country knows that this is not true.
Furthermore, Prof. Russell Berman's
assertion that. "... as far as cultural
wealth. Berlin is head and shoulders
above Vienna," must have been taken
out of context because anyone
familiar with Vienna knows it is any
thing but a cultural backwater. Given
its imperial traditions, art, music and
theater, Vienna possesses a culture
equal, if not superior, to Berlin's.
We do not have all the facts. All that
we ask is that the Faculty Senate be
given the opportunity to bring this
decision out into the open and estab
lish that the reasons given are valid
and unsolvable assuming a sincere
and concerted effort by the Overseas
Program Committee.

Fac Sen should
discuss shutdown
We were distressed to read recent u
that the Vienna campus will be perma
nently closed (Daily, Nov. 10), espe
cially since the reasons cited for its
closure are, in our opinion, mis
guided, implausible, and resolvable.
As two students who studied in Vienna
last year, we feel that the Overseas
Program Committee has not ade
quately evaluated the situation and the
reasons it has given should not be
accepted at face value by the members
of the Stanford community.
This committee claims low student
enrollment and weak curriculum as
two of the main problems Agreed, the
student population is low in compari
son with other more popular
campuses, like Oxford and Florence,
but we feel that the quality of our

overseas experience was optimal with
the average "low" enrollment.
However, if the University faces cer
tain economic constraints inherent in
not "filling" the Vienna campus, there
are steps that can be taken that would
produce more interest in the pro
gram.
There are many international rela
tions and political science majors here
whose concentration is East-West
relations, and Vienna, as a neutral
country nestled in the Eastern Bloc, is
ideally situated for studying this sub
ject. Our experience with the
reportedly "weak curriculum" was
that it offered a valuable change from
the American approach to East-West
relations. Additionally, the courses in
art, opera, symphony and theater are
an ideal introduction to Austrian
culture. Therefore, we feel that the
curriculum is solid and that the main
problem is the lack of awareness of
Vienna's unique international position
as a bridge between East and West, an
aspect not found in the charged politi
cal atmosphere of Berlin.
Poor administration of the program
is another gripe. Well, the professors
recruited by Vienna's staff are
knowledgeable, enthusiastic and come
from diverse European backgrounds.
Furthermore, the head of the program
and her staff infuse the students with
an amazing enthusiasm for life in
Vienna, and we believe that Stanford
cannot hope to find another group of
people so well suited for administer
ing an overseas campus.
OK, let's talk cash. The committee
claims that budgetary constraints
prevent it from maintaining a Vienna
campus. It's difficult to reconcile this
excuse with reality. Stanford can
afford a new campus in Kyoto, Japan.
Stanford can afford two campuses in
France. Stanford is in the midst of a $1
billion fund drive. Stanford is building
like there's no tomorrow. Certainly a
sincere effort on the part of the Over
seas Office to locate the funds should
be successful considering the
relatively meager needs of the Vienna
program in comparison with certain
other overseas campuses.
Finally there is the most im
probable and insulting excuse pro
posed by the committee: The Univer
sity does not need two programs in
German-speaking countries. Ignoring
the fact that there are other countries,
let alone language areas, that possess
more than one program, maintaining
that Berlin and Vienna are inter
changeable on a language basis is
ludicrous. That's like saying hypotheti
cally that we don't need a campus in
both New York and London because
English is spoken in both places.
Anybody who has spent time in either
country knows that this is not true.
Furthermore, Prof. Russell Berman's
assertion that. "... as far as cultural
wealth. Berlin is head and shoulders
above Vienna," must have been taken
out of context because anyone
familiar with Vienna knows it is any
thing but a cultural backwater. Given
its imperial traditions, art, music and
theater, Vienna possesses a culture
equal, if not superior, to Berlin's.
We do not have all the facts. All that
we ask is that the Faculty Senate be
given the opportunity to bring this
decision out into the open and estab
lish that the reasons given are valid
and unsolvable assuming a sincere
and concerted effort by the Overseas
Program Committee.

Vienna program
inspired students
Will the Viennese Ball become a
rootless artifact, unrelated to the
culture that inspired it? If the Stanford
campus in Vienna dies unnoticed, this
could well be the case. Clearly there
are problems with the program: The
points mentioned in a recent article
(Daily, Nov. 10) regarding low enroll
ment, a poorly structured program,
etc., are weak aspects, but they are not
tfcie only aspects. From the viewpoint
of the general public It looks as if the
Vienna campus has been allowed to
decline over the last few years without
most of those concerned being
notified, and that apathy and passivity
on the part of organizational elements
allowed this to happen.
Clearly, students support the exis
tence of the campus. The two students
on the Overseas Studies Committee
voted to maintain it, and the student
interviewed, along with the many
others who attended the center,
report positive experiences. The
decision also affects the students who
had planned to go to Vienna and now
no longer have the chance. Apparently
the decision took place in back rooms
— there were no discussions between
the University and the student body in
general.
The Vienna campus should not be
closed without a discussion and with
out seeking alternatives. Basic reforms
in structure may be necessary, but not
impossible. The Vienna center could
coordinate with the new Poland Pro
gram, perhaps launching students off
to Poland after spring quarter. Maybe
this would involve a reformation of
the campus as a part-time rather than
a full-time program. Why not take
advantage of valuable established
connections in Vienna and of Vienna's
cultural possibilities in order to set up
internships in theater, music and art
for humanities students? We find the
statement that "as far as cultural
wealth, Berlin is head and shoulders
above Vienna" completely out of
place. Cultural environments cannot
be compared in this way. Austrian
culture has a nature all its own, far
different from that of Berlin. The
Vienna experience stimulated enough
interest and excitement in students
that they returned to start traditions
like Austria Week and the Viennese
Ball. How many other overseas
campuses have inspired an active and
involved response such as this?

University should
reconsider decision
We would like to express our disap
pointment with the recent decision
made to close the Stanford program
in Vienna. We find it hard to under
stand why Stanford must shed such a
valuable resource.
As a seat of the United Nations,
Vienna has been a center for discus
sion of world politics. It is home to
high tech firms. It is certainly a
renowned center of culture. Endless
opportunities await Stanford students
in Vienna. In the spring of 1984,
Rudulf Kirschlager, then President of
Austria, visited Stanford University in
the course of a state visit, and when

he returned to Austria, he visited the
Stanford center in Vienna, invited
Stanford students for an informal
discussion and gave them an informal
tour of the Austrian presidential
offices. There is obviously great inter
est on Austria's part to keep the
Vienna program alive.
Stanford-in-Vienna has gifted and
dedicated teachers who spend lots of
time with students, incorporating
classroom learning with the "real
thing" through tours of governmental
institutions and museums, in addition
to field trips to the East Bloc. One
does not get this on the Farm. The
student living situation in Vienna is
the ideal 1 iritegrati6n into the foreign
culture. No villa enclave is this. Stan
ford students live with Austrian stu
dents in the University of Vienna
dormitories (which also house many
international students who choose to
study in Vienna). Students must buy
their food in the city and take the
streetcar or subway to classes. The
immersion in the culture is un
avoidable. The opportunity to study at
the University of Vienna is available
for those with the appropriate level of
German.
We would cite lack of promotion of
the Vienna program as its main prob
lem. We find it sad that Stanford Uni
versity is not willing to put more
energy into the program. And yet the
energy that comes out of the Stanford
student experience in Vienna sur
passes that of any other overseas
campus. Austria Week and the annual
Viennese Ball at Stanford were begun
by students returning from the Vienna
program.
Budgetary constraints have been
mentioned as the main reason for
closing the campus. We are all for the
expansion of the Stanford Overseas
Studies Program to Poland, Japan and
other areas of the globe. Yet Stanford
and the United States still have a
vested interest in Central Europe.
Vienna (the capital of a neutral
country) and Berlin (a divided city
surrounded by East Germany) repre
sent two very different experiences in
that area. Oi ° is not a substitute for
the other.
The Centennial fund-raising effort is
coming up. Why can't a better solution
be found than severing Stanford's ties

ment, a poorly structured program,
etc., are weak aspects, but they are not
tfcie only aspects. From the viewpoint
of the general public It looks as if the
Vienna campus has been allowed to
decline over the last few years without
most of those concerned being
notified, and that apathy and passivity
on the part of organizational elements
allowed this to happen.
Clearly, students support the exis
tence of the campus. The two students
on the Overseas Studies Committee
voted to maintain it, and the student
interviewed, along with the many
others who attended the center,
report positive experiences. The
decision also affects the students who
had planned to go to Vienna and now
no longer have the chance. Apparently
the decision took place in back rooms
— there were no discussions between
the University and the student body in
general.
The Vienna campus should not be
closed without a discussion and with
out seeking alternatives. Basic reforms
in structure may be necessary, but not
impossible. The Vienna center could
coordinate with the new Poland Pro
gram, perhaps launching students off
to Poland after spring quarter. Maybe
this would involve a reformation of
the campus as a part-time rather than
a full-time program. Why not take
advantage of valuable established
connections in Vienna and of Vienna's
cultural possibilities in order to set up
internships in theater, music and art
for humanities students? We find the
statement that "as far as cultural
wealth, Berlin is head and shoulders
above Vienna" completely out of
place. Cultural environments cannot
be compared in this way. Austrian
culture has a nature all its own, far
different from that of Berlin. The
Vienna experience stimulated enough
interest and excitement in students
that they returned to start traditions
like Austria Week and the Viennese
Ball. How many other overseas
campuses have inspired an active and
involved response such as this?

University should
reconsider decision
We would like to express our disap
pointment with the recent decision
made to close the Stanford program
in Vienna. We find it hard to under
stand why Stanford must shed such a
valuable resource.
As a seat of the United Nations,
Vienna has been a center for discus
sion of world politics. It is home to
high tech firms. It is certainly a
renowned center of culture. Endless
opportunities await Stanford students
in Vienna. In the spring of 1984,
Rudulf Kirschlager, then President of
Austria, visited Stanford University in
the course of a state visit, and when

he returned to Austria, he visited the
Stanford center in Vienna, invited
Stanford students for an informal
discussion and gave them an informal
tour of the Austrian presidential
offices. There is obviously great inter
est on Austria's part to keep the
Vienna program alive.
Stanford-in-Vienna has gifted and
dedicated teachers who spend lots of
time with students, incorporating
classroom learning with the "real
thing" through tours of governmental
institutions and museums, in addition
to field trips to the East Bloc. One
does not get this on the Farm. The
student living situation in Vienna is
the ideal 1 iritegrati6n into the foreign
culture. No villa enclave is this. Stan
ford students live with Austrian stu
dents in the University of Vienna
dormitories (which also house many
international students who choose to
study in Vienna). Students must buy
their food in the city and take the
streetcar or subway to classes. The
immersion in the culture is un
avoidable. The opportunity to study at
the University of Vienna is available
for those with the appropriate level of
German.
We would cite lack of promotion of
the Vienna program as its main prob
lem. We find it sad that Stanford Uni
versity is not willing to put more
energy into the program. And yet the
energy that comes out of the Stanford
student experience in Vienna sur
passes that of any other overseas
campus. Austria Week and the annual
Viennese Ball at Stanford were begun
by students returning from the Vienna
program.
Budgetary constraints have been
mentioned as the main reason for
closing the campus. We are all for the
expansion of the Stanford Overseas
Studies Program to Poland, Japan and
other areas of the globe. Yet Stanford
and the United States still have a
vested interest in Central Europe.
Vienna (the capital of a neutral
country) and Berlin (a divided city
surrounded by East Germany) repre
sent two very different experiences in
that area. Oi ° is not a substitute for
the other.
The Centennial fund-raising effort is
coming up. Why can't a better solution
be found than severing Stanford's ties
with Austria? Please save Stanford-in-
Vienna.

Fac Sen should
discuss shutdown
We were distressed to read recent u
that the Vienna campus will be perma
nently closed (Daily, Nov. 10), espe
cially since the reasons cited for its
closure are, in our opinion, mis
guided, implausible, and resolvable.
As two students who studied in Vienna
last year, we feel that the Overseas
Program Committee has not ade
quately evaluated the situation and the
reasons it has given should not be
accepted at face value by the members
of the Stanford community.
This committee claims low student
enrollment and weak curriculum as
two of the main problems Agreed, the
student population is low in compari
son with other more popular
campuses, like Oxford and Florence,
but we feel that the quality of our

overseas experience was optimal with
the average "low" enrollment.
However, if the University faces cer
tain economic constraints inherent in
not "filling" the Vienna campus, there
are steps that can be taken that would
produce more interest in the pro
gram.
There are many international rela
tions and political science majors here
whose concentration is East-West
relations, and Vienna, as a neutral
country nestled in the Eastern Bloc, is
ideally situated for studying this sub
ject. Our experience with the
reportedly "weak curriculum" was
that it offered a valuable change from
the American approach to East-West
relations. Additionally, the courses in
art, opera, symphony and theater are
an ideal introduction to Austrian
culture. Therefore, we feel that the
curriculum is solid and that the main
problem is the lack of awareness of
Vienna's unique international position
as a bridge between East and West, an
aspect not found in the charged politi
cal atmosphere of Berlin.
Poor administration of the program
is another gripe. Well, the professors
recruited by Vienna's staff are
knowledgeable, enthusiastic and come
from diverse European backgrounds.
Furthermore, the head of the program
and her staff infuse the students with
an amazing enthusiasm for life in
Vienna, and we believe that Stanford
cannot hope to find another group of
people so well suited for administer
ing an overseas campus.
OK, let's talk cash. The committee
claims that budgetary constraints
prevent it from maintaining a Vienna
campus. It's difficult to reconcile this
excuse with reality. Stanford can
afford a new campus in Kyoto, Japan.
Stanford can afford two campuses in
France. Stanford is in the midst of a $1
billion fund drive. Stanford is building
like there's no tomorrow. Certainly a
sincere effort on the part of the Over
seas Office to locate the funds should
be successful considering the
relatively meager needs of the Vienna
program in comparison with certain
other overseas campuses.
Finally there is the most im
probable and insulting excuse pro
posed by the committee: The Univer
sity does not need two programs in
German-speaking countries. Ignoring
the fact that there are other countries,
let alone language areas, that possess
more than one program, maintaining
that Berlin and Vienna are inter
changeable on a language basis is
ludicrous. That's like saying hypotheti
cally that we don't need a campus in
both New York and London because
English is spoken in both places.
Anybody who has spent time in either
country knows that this is not true.
Furthermore, Prof. Russell Berman's
assertion that. "... as far as cultural
wealth. Berlin is head and shoulders
above Vienna," must have been taken
out of context because anyone
familiar with Vienna knows it is any
thing but a cultural backwater. Given
its imperial traditions, art, music and
theater, Vienna possesses a culture
equal, if not superior, to Berlin's.
We do not have all the facts. All that
we ask is that the Faculty Senate be
given the opportunity to bring this
decision out into the open and estab
lish that the reasons given are valid
and unsolvable assuming a sincere
and concerted effort by the Overseas
Program Committee.
