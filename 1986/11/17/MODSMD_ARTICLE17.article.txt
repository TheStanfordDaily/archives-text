# Let's get naked and party

It seems that every issue of The Stanford Daily has at least
one editorial, column or letter addressing "harmful
stereotypes." Women, blacks and gays have all been vic
timized by misperception and prejudice and each has
received significant press coverage. There is another
minority on campus that has been ruinously affected by
"harmful stereotypes" and has, heretofore, remained silent.
But we're mad as hell, and we're not going to take it any
more. The stigma that engineers are solemn, stodgy,

number-crunching bores is simply inaccurate. Engineers
are party animals. They just need to be coaxed a bit.
Look at the role engineers have been conditioned to play.
The engineer image includes thick glasses, short hair, plas
tic pocket pencil holders and button-down collars. The typi
cal engineer will vote Republican, drive a Buick and shop at
Sears. Engineers don't date much but tend to marry the first
woman who shows casual interest. They remain loyal to the
day they die. Engineers don't cry in public, throw tantrums
or write best sellers that badmouth their parents. They pay
their bills early, attend church regularly and obey the 55-
miles-per-hour speed limit. Engineers are portrayed as pre
dictable, stable and infinitely practical. Most normal people
find the stereotype frightfully boring and prefer to stay
away.
How has this gross misrepresentation been allowed to
perpetuate? It starts with the responsibility engineers have
to society. The public needs engineers who can be trusted.
When a bridge fails, the power goes out in an entire city or a
space shuttle disintegrates on national television, the image
of reliance and responsibility becomes paramount. Nobody
wants engineers who live on the edge. A safety factor of 1.01
may be exciting and cavalier, but has no place where lives
are at stake. Society wants to believe that the designers of
airplanes, skyscrapers and nuclear reactors are not flakes or
psychopaths. Engineers work from detailed codes based on
solutions that have worked in the past. Everything is conser
vative and change is slow. You don't take a lot of chances.
Aside from doctors, engineers are sued more often than any
other profession — another good reason to be circumspect.
Engineers are not glorified in our society. Nobody
becomes an engineer to live on the wild side or flirt with
danger on a daily basis. There has not been a single televi
sion series about engineers. The corporate sleaze and
sexual exploits that make "Dallas" and "Dynasty" big hits
are contrary to the engineer image. Engineers don't even
carry guns. Could you imagine "Magnum, P.E.," the story of
a renegade professional engineer who inspects highway
bridges in Hawaii? Or perhaps, "Leave it to the Beavers," a
series about the rough-and-ready chaps who design dams
on a moment's notice? Or worse yet, "Miami Splice," a situa
tion comedy about a firm that designs welded, bolted and
shear tab connections for steel structures? None of these
would survive the season.

How can we end this foolish misperception of engineers?
Inside every engineer lurks a party animal waiting to
emerge. Secretly every engineer wants to join the Stanford
Band and "drop trou" in front of 50,000 people. Every en
gineer harbors a clandestine desire to drive fast cars, host a
talk show or appear as the Playgirl centerfold. Every en
gineer yearns to be James Bond chasing beautiful women
across Europe, Tom Cruise blasting commies from the sky
or Jim McMahon mocking the NFL commissioner and hur
ling Super Bowl touchdown passes. The potential is there.
Unfortunately, these desires are hidden behind an im
penetrable exterior fortress of wide flange steel beams
couled with reinforced concrete shear walls. If Joshua's
walls of Jericho could be destroyed, so can those that hold
the heart and soul of the engineer. But it will take effort and
perhaps divine intervention. Stanford students have always
supported the oppressed and downtrodden. If you really
want to "make a difference," then help breathe new life into
an engineer. It won't necessarily be easy, but few of life's
most worthwhile efforts ever are.
Walk up to the next engineer you see and demand, "Let's
go naked and party.'' Try to choose one of the opposite sex.
Have faith — the desire is there — but expect to encounter
resistance. Don't take "no" for an answer!
The conversation will probably proceed as follows:
"Yo, engineer! Yeah, you with those sexy white socks and
the calculator seductively dangling from your belt. Let's go
naked and party."
"Excuse me, miss, but I don't think we've met. Besides, I
must hurry to class. Prof. Pinsky is discussing the principle
of virtual work, a fascinating concept that nobody really un- > *
derstands."
"Forget Prof. Pinsky! Forget virtual work! F'orget those
Greek letters, long equations and irritating sign conven
tions! Come with me. We'll sip wine on the beach, walk
barefoot through the fields and make love under the stars.
Let's live for today. Take some time to smell the roses."
"Frankly, I prefer the smell of molten steel or freshly
paved asphalt. But well, er, maybe we could take in a movie
on Saturday night if I finish my homework."
"You don't understand. I mean now. Drop your books in
Terman pond and we'll depart immediately. The Kronecker
delta and Hooke's Law will still be waiting for you tomor
row. When did you last read a poem in front of the
fireplace? Have you ever sat on the grass and listened to the
birds sing? Did you ever want to paint a picture? You're
young. Live while you can still enjoy it."
"Maybe you're right. There is more to life than problem
sets, laser printers and office hours. Maybe we could get
drunk on a sailboat and watch the sunset. Or we could ride
skateboards through the park at midnight. Or let's have sex
in a hot air balloon. Will you show me how?"
"Take me now, you stud."
Not all engineers will be this easy, but you get the general
idea. Hang tough and be persistent. Imagine the thrill of
transforming a reserved, respectable engineer into a crazed
party animal right before your eyes. You are on a mission
from God. Your engineer will appreciate being freed from
the shackles of caution and conservatism. You will have
made the world a better place in which to live. Dr. Ruth
would approve.
