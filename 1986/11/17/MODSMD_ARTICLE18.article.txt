Student Affairs
donated no funds
for Daniloff talk
We at the Speakers Bureau would
like to clear up some confusion re
garding the financial support for the
Nicholas Daniloff event this Thursday.
At some point, conjecture was acci
dentally turned into reality and the
Office of Student Affairs was reported
to have given $2,000 for Daniloff s
honorarium. This is incorrect.
At present, Daniloffs honorarium is
$8,500. Of that, $7,500 will come from
sources within the ASSU and the
remaining fees to cover the
honorarium and logistical expenses
will come from the Wilbur Fellows,
the Knight Journalism Fellowship
Program and other outside sources. At
no point did the Office of Student
Affairs promise funds, and so any
contribution on its part listed
anywhere was made in error.
We apologize for any confusion,
thank all parties for their patience and
ask that all further inquiries be di
rected to the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Thank you.
