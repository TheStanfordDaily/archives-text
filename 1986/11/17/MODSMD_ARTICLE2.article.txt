In a year that saw nearly twice as
many cases of student misconduct as
the previous year, a Stanford alumnus'
bachelor's degree was invalidated after
he confessed to Honor Code violations
in 11 classes, according to the 1985-86
annual report of the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
In the unprecedented case, an
"alumnus who received a degree
several years ago came forth volun
tarily and admitted to four year's worth
of Honor Code violations during his
undergraudate career," Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole wrote in the report,
which was released Friday.
The case was referred to the Stan
ford Judicial Council (SJC), which
reviews cases without precedents.
Those with precedents are normally
handled by the Dean of Student Affairs
Office.
"Unlike a jury, (the SJC) doesn't eval
uate facts," Cole said, adding that its
main role is to "formulate judicial
policy." It is made up of four students
and four faculty members.
In this particular case, 42 of the
alumnus' units were withdrawn, result
ing in the invalidation of his degree.
He was also suspended from Stanford
for three quarters.
The alumnus was one of 42 people
charged with 45 counts of student mis

conduct in 1985-86.
There were more cases of student
misconduct filed with the Judicial Af
fairs Office that year than in any of the
previous three years, according to
Cole.
Twenty-six charges were levied
