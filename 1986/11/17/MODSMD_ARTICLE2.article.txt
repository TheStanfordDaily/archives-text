# Judicial Affairs sees increase in caseload

### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
In a year that saw nearly twice as
many cases of student misconduct as
the previous year, a Stanford alumnus'
bachelor's degree was invalidated after
he confessed to Honor Code violations
in 11 classes, according to the 1985-86
annual report of the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
In the unprecedented case, an
"alumnus who received a degree
several years ago came forth volun
tarily and admitted to four year's worth
of Honor Code violations during his
undergraudate career," Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole wrote in the report,
which was released Friday.
The case was referred to the Stan
ford Judicial Council (SJC), which
reviews cases without precedents.
Those with precedents are normally
handled by the Dean of Student Affairs
Office.
"Unlike a jury, (the SJC) doesn't eval
uate facts," Cole said, adding that its
main role is to "formulate judicial
policy." It is made up of four students
and four faculty members.
In this particular case, 42 of the
alumnus' units were withdrawn, result
ing in the invalidation of his degree.
He was also suspended from Stanford
for three quarters.
The alumnus was one of 42 people
charged with 45 counts of student mis

conduct in 1985-86.
There were more cases of student
misconduct filed with the Judicial Af
fairs Office that year than in any of the
previous three years, according to
Cole.
Twenty-six charges were levied
against 24 students in 1984-85.
Cole noted, however, that the 45
charges handled by her office in the
past year include eight stemming from
Honor Code violations in Psychology 1
in the spring of 1985.
"That's not a trivial number," she
said. She also said there were many
events last year in which more than
one student was involved in a situation
and each student was charged with a
violation.
The 45 charges include 30 Honor
Code violations, 12 infractions of the

Fundamental Standard, which broadly
defines proper student conduct, and
three Campus Disruption Policy viola
tions. The Campus Disruption Policy
violations were the first brought
before the office since the early 19705,
Cole said.
The Campus Disruption Policy is "a
fairly specific policy" that regulates stu
dent conduct in public places, accord
ing to Cole. Among the areas it governs
is a person's right to express his or
her opinion in a public setting," Cole
said.
In the report, Cole also notes that
there was "a noticeable and troubling
increase in misconduct that in one way
or another victimized fellow students,
and in misconduct that was related to

alconoi aouse.
In brief synopses of some of the
cases, the report cites four different
cases related to alcohol abuse.
Penalties for Fundamental Standard
violations that involved alcohol abuse
include suspension, forced abstention
from alcohol, fines and orders to per
form a specified amount of community
service.
Removal from the University is also a
possible consequence of violating the
Fundamental Standard, which states:
"Students are expected to show both
within and without the University such
respect for order, morality, personal
honor and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens.'
