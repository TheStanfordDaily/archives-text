## Stanford struggles to stay full of faculty family flats

"The Trustees shall ... lay off on
Palo Alto Farm one or more sites for
buildings for the offices and
employees of the Institution and erect
and maintain thereon such buildings
as may be necessary."
So states the second article of the
Founding Grant of Stanford University,
guaranteeing Stanford faculty mem
bers the right to build houses on
campus.
And since its inception, Stanford,
like few other universities, has main
tained and actively encouraged a fac
ulty residential community on its
campus.
In the beginning, there was Alvarado
Row.

Constructed to house the Univer
sity's first professors, the 10-house row
did not provide much more than the
basic necessities of life. In the words of
Mrs. John Casper Branner, the wife of
Stanford's second president, the row
needed "only the line of clothes flap
ping in the wind to complete the
picture of a poor quarter in the out
skirts of some western town."
The houses originally had no
electricity or running water and pro
fessors had to draw water from a com
mon well during their lunch hours. Of
the houses on the Row, one still stands:
the Griffin-Drell house, built in 1892.
Around the same time that Leland
and Jane Stanford built Alvarado Row,
Timothy Hopkins subdivided a portion
of land in Palo Alto. This land,

bounded by Raniona and Waverly
Streets and Lincoln and Kingsley
Avenues, soon became known as
Professorville, an off-campus commu
nity made up largely, but not entirely,
of Stanford professors.
From 1890 until 1910, this area came
to include 29 houses; it would retain a
large faculty community for the first 30
years of the 20th century.
On August 20, 1969, Professorville
became a point of historic interest, and
to commemorate this occasion a
plaque bearing the following inscrip
tion was designed: "Built in sturdy
Turn of the Century' style, these early
homes survived the Great Earthquake
of 1906 and today constitute the largest
neighborhood of its kind in the Mid
peninsula area."
Other early off-campus ventures by
the faculty include a five-professor ef
fort to buy land in the Bellview tract
south of Menlo Park in 1905. According
to the Palo Alto Times, the faculty
members intended to avoid the prohi
bitive prices of Palo Alto housing and
the then-current Stanford policy that
the University could buy back any
campus home at two-thirds of its value.
The Bellview enterprise did not,
however, form a lasting faculty com
munity.

San Juan Hill became the second on
campus faculty community when it
opened for development in 1908. In
this project, faculty could lease lots of
one or more acres on which to build a
single house of their choice. Led by
Prof. William Durand, head of the Me
chanical Engineering Department, fac
ulty gradually moved to San Juan Hill.
The project contained 15 single-family
homes in 1914, but by the end of the
1930s it had 180 such dwellings.
Like all other on-campus develop
ments, San Juan Hill had restrictions.
First, all participants in the project

had to be professors seeking tenure or
senior staff members. Second, these
participants could not own the land on
which their house was built or even,
technically at least, the house that they
built. The University leased both house
and land to the participant.
Third, the lessee had to sell the
leased house and land if he or she
broke affiliation with the University.
The lessee could sell either to Stanford
or to a Stanford-approved buyer, gen
erally for the property's market value.
It made little difference, therefore, that
a faculty member could not technically
own the property: He or she would
receive its market value upon selling
its lease.
San Juan Hill was the first of several
developments that would comprise

what is currently known as the faculty
ghetto, a community of 613 single
family homes.
The next three on-campus Univer
sity developments, named Pine Hill
One, Pine Hill Two and Frenchman's
Hill, were carried on continuously
from the late 1950s to the early 19705.
The two Pine Hill projects, com
pleted by the early 19605, created the
majority of existing single family fac
ulty and senior staff homes on campus,
according to a recent Stanford housing
program publication. The Pine Hill
projects contain 236 single family
homes, each with a one-third acre lot.
Frenchman's Hill, developed from
1968 until 1973, has 190 single family
homes on one-fourth acre lots.
Demand for the houses in Pine Hill

and Frenchman's Hill so far exceeded
supply that lotteries decided who
would live where.
The completion of the Frenchman's
Hill project marked the end of single
family house construction on Stanford
lands — to date.
Following the completion of the fac
ulty ghetto, the University turned its at
tention to building condominiums.
The Pearce Mitchell development,
completed in December 1975, pro
vided 82 housing units designed, ac
cording to its prospectus, "to provide
an alternative form of on-campus
housing for the senior segment of the
faculty, while at the same time increas
ing the supply of available single family
homes to alleviate housing pressures."
Initially, the University had problems selling
the units; in a Daily article a month after the
condominiums were completed, some buyers
and others alleged that small bedrooms and
poor workmanship had eroded faculty support
for the project. However, the units all sold
within nine months of completion,
The University's most recent development,
the Peter Coutts condominiums, opened in
1983. In the face of what a 1981 Daily article
termed "an increasingly dire housing situa
tion," the development provided 140 units of
faculty and staff housing.
At the end of nearly 100 years of operation,
Stanford has created an unparalleled on
campus residential faculty community. From
the bygone days of Alvarado Row — when 10
houses suddenly appeared out on "the plain, in
order that the faculty families when they should
come might not have to live in tents," as one
member of the early Stanford community ob
served — to the present days of the luxurious
faculty ghetto, Stanford's faculty housing has
tried to mirror the University's drastic expan
sion.
With roughly 850 units of faculty and staff
housing, the University now houses more than
half of its tenure-track professors on Stanford
land.
"The Trustees shall ... lay off on
Palo Alto Farm one or more sites for
buildings for the offices and
employees of the Institution and erect
and maintain thereon such buildings
as may be necessary."

completed in December 1975, pro
vided 82 housing units designed, ac
cording to its prospectus, "to provide
an alternative form of on-campus
housing for the senior segment of the
faculty, while at the same time increas
ing the supply of available single family
homes to alleviate housing pressures."
Initially, the University had problems selling
the units; in a Daily article a month after the
condominiums were completed, some buyers
and others alleged that small bedrooms and
poor workmanship had eroded faculty support
for the project. However, the units all sold
within nine months of completion,
The University's most recent development,
the Peter Coutts condominiums, opened in
1983. In the face of what a 1981 Daily article
termed "an increasingly dire housing situa
tion," the development provided 140 units of
faculty and staff housing.
At the end of nearly 100 years of operation,
Stanford has created an unparalleled on
campus residential faculty community. From
the bygone days of Alvarado Row — when 10
houses suddenly appeared out on "the plain, in
order that the faculty families when they should
come might not have to live in tents," as one
member of the early Stanford community ob
served — to the present days of the luxurious
faculty ghetto, Stanford's faculty housing has
tried to mirror the University's drastic expan
sion.
With roughly 850 units of faculty and staff
housing, the University now houses more than
half of its tenure-track professors on Stanford
land.
"The Trustees shall ... lay off on
Palo Alto Farm one or more sites for
buildings for the offices and
employees of the Institution and erect
and maintain thereon such buildings
as may be necessary."
So states the second article of the
Founding Grant of Stanford University,
guaranteeing Stanford faculty mem
bers the right to build houses on
campus.
And since its inception, Stanford,
like few other universities, has main
tained and actively encouraged a fac
ulty residential community on its
campus.
In the beginning, there was Alvarado
Row.

Constructed to house the Univer
sity's first professors, the 10-house row
did not provide much more than the
basic necessities of life. In the words of
Mrs. John Casper Branner, the wife of
Stanford's second president, the row
needed "only the line of clothes flap
ping in the wind to complete the
picture of a poor quarter in the out
skirts of some western town."
The houses originally had no
electricity or running water and pro
fessors had to draw water from a com
mon well during their lunch hours. Of
the houses on the Row, one still stands:
the Griffin-Drell house, built in 1892.
Around the same time that Leland
and Jane Stanford built Alvarado Row,
Timothy Hopkins subdivided a portion
of land in Palo Alto. This land,

bounded by Raniona and Waverly
Streets and Lincoln and Kingsley
Avenues, soon became known as
Professorville, an off-campus commu
nity made up largely, but not entirely,
of Stanford professors.
From 1890 until 1910, this area came
to include 29 houses; it would retain a
large faculty community for the first 30
years of the 20th century.
On August 20, 1969, Professorville
became a point of historic interest, and
to commemorate this occasion a
plaque bearing the following inscrip
tion was designed: "Built in sturdy
Turn of the Century' style, these early
homes survived the Great Earthquake
of 1906 and today constitute the largest
neighborhood of its kind in the Mid
peninsula area."
Other early off-campus ventures by
the faculty include a five-professor ef
fort to buy land in the Bellview tract
south of Menlo Park in 1905. According
to the Palo Alto Times, the faculty
members intended to avoid the prohi
bitive prices of Palo Alto housing and
the then-current Stanford policy that
the University could buy back any
campus home at two-thirds of its value.
The Bellview enterprise did not,
however, form a lasting faculty com
munity.

San Juan Hill became the second on
campus faculty community when it
opened for development in 1908. In
this project, faculty could lease lots of
one or more acres on which to build a
single house of their choice. Led by
Prof. William Durand, head of the Me
chanical Engineering Department, fac
ulty gradually moved to San Juan Hill.
The project contained 15 single-family
homes in 1914, but by the end of the
1930s it had 180 such dwellings.
Like all other on-campus develop
ments, San Juan Hill had restrictions.
First, all participants in the project

had to be professors seeking tenure or
senior staff members. Second, these
participants could not own the land on
which their house was built or even,
technically at least, the house that they
built. The University leased both house
and land to the participant.
Third, the lessee had to sell the
leased house and land if he or she
broke affiliation with the University.
The lessee could sell either to Stanford
or to a Stanford-approved buyer, gen
erally for the property's market value.
It made little difference, therefore, that
a faculty member could not technically
own the property: He or she would
receive its market value upon selling
its lease.
San Juan Hill was the first of several
developments that would comprise

what is currently known as the faculty
ghetto, a community of 613 single
family homes.
The next three on-campus Univer
sity developments, named Pine Hill
One, Pine Hill Two and Frenchman's
Hill, were carried on continuously
from the late 1950s to the early 19705.
The two Pine Hill projects, com
pleted by the early 19605, created the
majority of existing single family fac
ulty and senior staff homes on campus,
according to a recent Stanford housing
program publication. The Pine Hill
projects contain 236 single family
homes, each with a one-third acre lot.
Frenchman's Hill, developed from
1968 until 1973, has 190 single family
homes on one-fourth acre lots.
Demand for the houses in Pine Hill

and Frenchman's Hill so far exceeded
supply that lotteries decided who
would live where.
The completion of the Frenchman's
Hill project marked the end of single
family house construction on Stanford
lands — to date.

ulty ghetto, the University turned its at
tention to building condominiums.
