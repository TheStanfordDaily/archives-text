## Stanford struggles to stay full of faculty family flats 
### CHRIS OWEN 
"The Trustees shall ... lay off on
Palo Alto Farm one or more sites for
buildings for the offices and
employees of the Institution and erect
and maintain thereon such buildings
as may be necessary."
So states the second article of the
Founding Grant of Stanford University,
guaranteeing Stanford faculty mem
bers the right to build houses on
campus.
And since its inception, Stanford,
like few other universities, has main
tained and actively encouraged a fac
ulty residential community on its
campus.
In the beginning, there was Alvarado
Row.

Constructed to house the Univer
sity's first professors, the 10-house row
did not provide much more than the
basic necessities of life. In the words of
Mrs. John Casper Branner, the wife of
Stanford's second president, the row
needed "only the line of clothes flap
ping in the wind to complete the
picture of a poor quarter in the out
skirts of some western town."
The houses originally had no
electricity or running water and pro
fessors had to draw water from a com
mon well during their lunch hours. Of
the houses on the Row, one still stands:
the Griffin-Drell house, built in 1892.
Around the same time that Leland
and Jane Stanford built Alvarado Row,
Timothy Hopkins subdivided a portion
of land in Palo Alto. This land,

bounded by Raniona and Waverly
Streets and Lincoln and Kingsley
Avenues, soon became known as
Professorville, an off-campus commu
nity made up largely, but not entirely,
of Stanford professors.
From 1890 until 1910, this area came
to include 29 houses; it would retain a
large faculty community for the first 30
years of the 20th century.
On August 20, 1969, Professorville
became a point of historic interest, and
to commemorate this occasion a
plaque bearing the following inscrip
tion was designed: "Built in sturdy
Turn of the Century' style, these early
homes survived the Great Earthquake
of 1906 and today constitute the largest
neighborhood of its kind in the Mid
peninsula area."
Other early off-campus ventures by
the faculty include a five-professor ef
fort to buy land in the Bellview tract
south of Menlo Park in 1905. According
to the Palo Alto Times, the faculty
members intended to avoid the prohi
bitive prices of Palo Alto housing and
the then-current Stanford policy that
the University could buy back any
campus home at two-thirds of its value.
The Bellview enterprise did not,
however, form a lasting faculty com
munity.
