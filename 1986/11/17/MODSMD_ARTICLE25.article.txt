# SOUTH PALO ALTO
## 
### 
This tract, recently opened up, is the most attractive subdivision
that has been placed on the market in this locality. In view of the
University buildings, studded with live oaks, streets graded, and
having an independent water system unequalled by any in the County,
SOUTH PALO ALTO has attracted scores of home builders. Since
June 15th. this year, up to this time, over 300 lots have been sold. This
demonstrates what is thought of SOUTH PALO ALTO.

Lots 50x100 feet and 50x200 feet. Average Price about $300. $10 down and
$10 per month will purchase one. The purchase price includes cement sidewalks and
curb, street grading and water mains.

This advertisement from the 1907 Daily Palo Alto announced the subdivision of South Palo Alto in a similar manner
as the Professorville announcement several years before.
