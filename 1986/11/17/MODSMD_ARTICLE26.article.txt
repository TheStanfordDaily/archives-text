# Current-carrying car crux of project purpose

Can you imagine a house and car that generate all their
own power?
Can you, for whom bottle-opening is a major undertak
ing, be a productive part of a group designing and building
a solar car?
And can you believe you can do this on campus?
Believe it: You can, you can and you can at the Stanford
Solar Car Project.
"Pretty much anyone can be a part of the project," said
Curt Castellanet, a mechanical engineering major working
on the project. In addition to designers and builders, we
need publicity people, someone to take pictures, (someone
to) help get corporate donations, someone to design the
interior of the car and lots more. The project is also great
practical experience for students with technical skills."
The ultimate goal of the project is to produce an electric
car that can be recharged by a solar-powered home. In the
meantime, the group is concentrating on getting an electric
car built as well as studying the effects of electric cars and
making their popular use feasible.
The group currently is working on designing and con
structing an electric car, using an electric motor and the
body of a Chevy Chevette donated by the Electric Auto Asso
ciation. Such a car would be non-polluting and have a range
of about 50 miles, enough for most commuters, according
to John Reuyl, a member of the Electric Auto Association
and the advisor for the solar car project.
The group has a good reason to push towards its higher
goal. If electric cars came into general use, they would have
a great impact on everything from the environment to the
world's dependence on oil-producing nations, says Reuyl.
To this end, the project members are building an electric

car that can be recharged from a solar array on a home
Once the car is built at Stanford, it will be tied in to a solar
system already in place in a house on Skyline Boulevard.
"There is enough solar energy falling on the roof of one
house to power both the house and a car â€” in fact, PG&E is
now buying excess power from a home in Palo Alto," Reuyl
said.
In such a system, the house and car share a symbiotic re
lationship. It would work so well that, rather than receiving
an electric bill each month, the homeowner could receive a
check each month, says Reuyl.
Such a combination of a house and a solar/electric car
would be perfectly energy-efficient. The home would sell
excess energy to the power company during peak daytime
hours, when energy use in the house would be low but en
ergy production high. At night, when utilities have more
power available, the process would be reversed. The
homeowner would then be buying electricity to recharge
the car.
There are several different possible combinations of
house and solar/electric car, some of which are designed to
benefit houses built far from power lines. In those cases, it
is ususally cheaper to install solar equipment than to bring
in the power line. With the help of a small backup
generator, an isolated house can become totally self
sufficient, says Reuyl.
"The overall goal of this project is to promote solar en
ergy," says Castellanet. "This is a research project to show
that our vision can become a reality."
If you like the idea of making something with off-the-shelf
technology, join the Stanford Solar Car Project Wednesdays
at 7 p.m. and Saturdays at 10 a.m. in the Elliot Program Cen
ter Project Room, Governor's Corner. The project will be of
fered for credit next quarter.

The body of this Chevrolet Chevette will one day house an electric engine that will be charged from a solar-powered
dwelling, hope designers from the Stanford Solar Car Project.
