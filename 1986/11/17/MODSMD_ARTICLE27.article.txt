# AP exemptions from English — enough
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Staff writer 
Freshmen taking freshman English tend to
think of fulfilling the writing requirement as
something akin to visiting the dentist: They
dread it, wouldn't do it if they didn't have to,
but afterwards are glad they did.
Recent elimination of exemption from the
requirement on the basis of Advanced Place
ment test scores has focused new attention on
these courses.
Freshmen generally support abolition of the
exemption policy, although they express a bit
of anxiety about "not having enough time" to
take other classes their freshman year.
"With (freshman English) and Western Cul
ture, I don't have time to take the classes I
want," said one freshman.
"The two classes together are supposed to be
eight units," said another. "They're not; they're
more."
The time-consuming nature of the course
notwithstanding, freshman generally feel that
the class is worthwhile.
"I would probably be sorry in the long run if
1 didn't take it," said a freshman. "But if I had
the choice I probably wouldn't."
Some freshmen do have a choice. They are
among this year's 39 percent who fulfilled the

writing requirement by scoring a four or five
on the AP English exam. The majority of these
students opted against taking freshman English
courses.
According to Nancy Packer, director of the
Freshman English Program, the writing re
quirement has been around since the 19505,
and is the only specific requirement that the
faculty has never considered abolishing.

'Oh God, I wish I
hadn't exempted.'

Packer stressed the high quality of teaching
in freshman English classes. Fewer than half the
total number of courses are taught by graduate
students, while half the courses are taught by
lecturers, most of whom hold doctorates and
"all of whom are capable of being professors at'
a university," Packer said. Many of the lecturers
specialize in writing instruction and are
devoted to the teaching of it, she added.
The remainder of the classes, numbering ap
proximately six, are taught by English Depart
ment faculty, who are required to teach fresh
man English periodically.
Exactly why the AP exemption policy started

was unclear, Packer said. It might have been
seen as a way of saving money, "but I don't
know that that is the motivation for having the
exemption," she said.
It was most likely seen as a way to encourage
higher standards of writing instruction in high
schools, "to act as a sort of carrot dangling out
there ... for teachers and students," she said.
But freshmen see a great deal of. disparity in
the quality of writing instruction in high
schools. "I have had to write a paper a week
ever since ninth grade," said one freshman,
who is enrolled in a freshman English course.
"We had English' classes in my high school,"
said a student exempted from the writing re
quirement. "We didn't have classes specifically
for writing."
Most of those exempted feel they are hand
ling well the demands of writing at the college
level and are glad to have the extra time in their
schedule for other classes.
"As far as writing goes, I'm doing all right,"
said an exempted freshman. "The people in
freshman English will probably have an advan
tage in the long run because they will be used
to writing a lot of papers, but oh well," she said
with a shrug of her shoulders.
When they do need help on a paper, ex
empted students say they usually turn to an up
perclassmen.

Two sophomores, Susan Mcßeynolds and
Gabrielle Toledano, are probably the most fre
quently sought after for writing assistance. They
are the two sophomore writing tutors living in
Otero this year as pan of a new program spear
headed by Dennis Matthies, an English lecturer
who is also Otero's resident fellow.
Mcßeynolds and Toledano are trained by the
English Department to serve as tutorial help for
everyone in the dorm on a drop-in basis and as
required help for students in Matthies' ind
Great Works instructor Kathy Namphey's
classes.
"They (Mcßeynolds and Toledano) have
been extremely helpful to me," said Matthies,
emphasizing that freshman often feel more
comfortable talking about their writing to
someone who won't be grading them on it.
Toledano pointed out that she often hears
students who were exempted from taking
freshman English complaining about writing
for other classes. "I get people coming to me
saying, 'I need help' and 'Oh God, I wish I
hadn't exempted,'" she said.
Matthies indicated that the program has been
successful in Otero and hopes to expand it to
other dorms. If, in the near future, all freshmen
will be required to take freshman English, the
instructors will probably welcome the support,
he said.
