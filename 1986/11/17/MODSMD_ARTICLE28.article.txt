## Clancy fabricates world war scenario 
### ISAAC DOHERTY BARCHAS 
"Red Storm Rising"
By Tom Clancy
Putnam, New York
$19.95
For someone with neither profes
sional experience in war nor, until
recently, with writing, Tom Clancy
writes convincingly of the military life.
Clancy, a Maryland insurance sales
man, came on the literary scene with
"The Hunt for Red October," a
suspense novel about submarine
warfare. The book became a favorite of
President Reagan's, and this is no
surprise: The world of Clancy's novels
is remarkably similar to the one the
president conjures up in his speeches,
a world in which American "can
doism" triumphs over Soviet commun
ism.
"Red Storm Rising" is also a war
story. To fans of Clancy's last novel, I
must be frank: His newest effort is not
as good. The tight control he exercised
in "The Hunt for Red October" is ab
sent in this new publication. Moreover,
the irony he previously achieved has
been severely diluted. This is not to say
that the novel is worthless. If you like
either long, technical pieces on
warfare or "U.S.A., U.S.A." ex
travaganzas in which the good guys
wear white hats and persevere against
all odds, then you might want to pick
up Clancy's latest. It aptly fills the genre
of war story. "The Hunt for Red Octo
ber," however, defined that genre.
The plot of "Red Storm Rising" is
fairly straightforward. The novel opens
with an oil shortage in the Soviet Un
ion, a manifestation of the failure of the
communist system. Moslem terrorists
exacerbate the problem by blowing up
the Soviets' largest oil refinery. The
Politburo determines that the only so
lution is to seize the Persian Gulf oil
fields. First, however, they conclude
that the military capabilities of NATO
must be paralyzed.
Thus begins Operation Red Storm, a
Soviet propaganda and military cam
paign to take control of Europe. Before
the Soviets strike, however, the West
learns of their plans. At the moment of
combat, neither side knows whether
the Soviet strategy will prevail.
Clancy's characters, both Russian

and Allied, appear at first fascinating,
though as the novel progresses they
begin to lose their differentiating
qualities. The author places his heroes
at the nexus of personal integrity and
technical competence. These heroes
are satisfying, average citizens forced
into greatness by the demands around
them — to conduct a world war with
dignity and an unequivocal dogged
ness.
But let us not forget that Clancy has
drawn praise from a man who sees the
Soviet Union as an "evil empire." Thus,
there are moments when he dips into
the well of nationalistic bias. One par
ticular subplot deserves critical
reproach for this very reason. It begins
with a murder-rape attempt by a small
band of Soviets. One of the American
heroes (who has lost a loved one to vi
olent crime earlier in the novel) steps
in and stops them, and then falls in
love with the woman he has rescued.
Clancy shows us nothing of the intri
cate psychology behind rape recovery,
and he skims the surface of the man's
motivations. It just doesn't work.
Furthermore, Clancy seems to
struggle to draw a realistic female char
acter. His near-rape victim appears
both docile and courageous, as the
plot requires, and the only other
woman in the novel is a fighter pilot
who leans toward lesbianism. Clancy
does not adequately move beyond
stereotypes in creating these roles.

He also has problems depicting
poignant emotional responses from
his characters. He attempts to convey
the love, terror, shock and weariness
that make up war, but he rarely gets to
the center of an individual's conscious
ness, which makes his truth. He
simply lacks the sympathetic imagina

tion to give his reader a deeper under
standing of men in combat. His mis
conceptions can likely be traced to the
limitation of his own personal experi
ence.
Though his attempts at emotional in
tensity fail, he does succeed in creating
a tension throughout the novel. The

honest, nail-biting suspense of a sub
marine chase is his forte; it was a prime
ingredient in his first novel. Clancy
spends close to 100 pages giving life to
a pair of blips on the sonar screen. He
lets us watch as they are pursued, tar
geted, crippled and destroyed. Without
even illustrating the lives of the com
manders or the crew, he invests the
vessels with such vitality that the
reader feels genuine sorrow at their
destruction. Clancy manages one of the
most difficult tricks of modern writing.
He places technology in its rightful
place as an extension of human sen
sibilities. This may allow for greater
feeling and compassion, but it also in
troduces the possibility of greater
destruction.
This technology gives Clancy his
"bread and butter." Many readers —
including Secretary of the Navy Leh
man — have found his depiction of
military hardware and tactics so realis
tic that it nearly constitutes a breach of
national security. Indeed, reading a
Clancy novel gives one the feeling of
sitting through a Defense Department
briefing on modern warfare. This, in
the end, is the novel's great appeal.
Although his technological veracity

remains beyond reproach, Clancy has
some problems in unfolding the strate
gic side of the novel. The* premise of
the book — that the Soviets would
have to demobilize NATO before they
could assume control of the Persian
Gulf — seems a bit ludicrous. Also, in
order to keep the novel "clean," he
avoids depicting the use of chemical
warfare. This is also improbable.
Clancy shares his biggest stumbling
block with every other ambitious au
thor who has attempted to write
realistically of a third world war waged
without nuclear weapons — just how
to keep the warheads in their silos.
Discovering how his attempt fares,
in fact, is one of the major incentives
behind reading the book. As the situa
tion on the military map becomes
more heated and the politcal entangle
ments more intense, one wonders how
Clancy will save the world from a nu
clear holocaust. For a fan of final page
plot-twists, for a devotee of del is ex
machina, even for a connoisseur of the
improbable, Clancy's scheme to avoid
nuclear war is a winner.
For the rest of us, it underscores the
unlikelihood of a third world war ever
having a peaceful resolution.

president conjures up in his speeches,
a world in which American "can
doism" triumphs over Soviet commun
ism.
"Red Storm Rising" is also a war
story. To fans of Clancy's last novel, I
must be frank: His newest effort is not
as good. The tight control he exercised
in "The Hunt for Red October" is ab
sent in this new publication. Moreover,
the irony he previously achieved has
been severely diluted. This is not to say
that the novel is worthless. If you like
either long, technical pieces on
warfare or "U.S.A., U.S.A." ex
travaganzas in which the good guys
wear white hats and persevere against
all odds, then you might want to pick
up Clancy's latest. It aptly fills the genre
of war story. "The Hunt for Red Octo
ber," however, defined that genre.
The plot of "Red Storm Rising" is
fairly straightforward. The novel opens
with an oil shortage in the Soviet Un
ion, a manifestation of the failure of the
communist system. Moslem terrorists
exacerbate the problem by blowing up
the Soviets' largest oil refinery. The
Politburo determines that the only so
lution is to seize the Persian Gulf oil
fields. First, however, they conclude
that the military capabilities of NATO
must be paralyzed.
Thus begins Operation Red Storm, a
Soviet propaganda and military cam
paign to take control of Europe. Before
the Soviets strike, however, the West
learns of their plans. At the moment of
combat, neither side knows whether
the Soviet strategy will prevail.
Clancy's characters, both Russian

and Allied, appear at first fascinating,
though as the novel progresses they
begin to lose their differentiating
qualities. The author places his heroes
at the nexus of personal integrity and
technical competence. These heroes
are satisfying, average citizens forced
into greatness by the demands around
them — to conduct a world war with
dignity and an unequivocal dogged
ness.
But let us not forget that Clancy has
drawn praise from a man who sees the
Soviet Union as an "evil empire." Thus,
there are moments when he dips into
the well of nationalistic bias. One par
ticular subplot deserves critical
reproach for this very reason. It begins
with a murder-rape attempt by a small
band of Soviets. One of the American
heroes (who has lost a loved one to vi
olent crime earlier in the novel) steps
in and stops them, and then falls in
love with the woman he has rescued.
Clancy shows us nothing of the intri
cate psychology behind rape recovery,
and he skims the surface of the man's
motivations. It just doesn't work.
Furthermore, Clancy seems to
struggle to draw a realistic female char
acter. His near-rape victim appears
both docile and courageous, as the
plot requires, and the only other
woman in the novel is a fighter pilot
who leans toward lesbianism. Clancy
does not adequately move beyond
stereotypes in creating these roles.

He also has problems depicting
poignant emotional responses from
his characters. He attempts to convey
the love, terror, shock and weariness
that make up war, but he rarely gets to
the center of an individual's conscious
ness, which makes his truth. He
simply lacks the sympathetic imagina

tion to give his reader a deeper under
standing of men in combat. His mis
conceptions can likely be traced to the
limitation of his own personal experi
ence.
Though his attempts at emotional in
tensity fail, he does succeed in creating
a tension throughout the novel. The

honest, nail-biting suspense of a sub
marine chase is his forte; it was a prime
ingredient in his first novel. Clancy
spends close to 100 pages giving life to
a pair of blips on the sonar screen. He
lets us watch as they are pursued, tar
geted, crippled and destroyed. Without
even illustrating the lives of the com
manders or the crew, he invests the
vessels with such vitality that the
reader feels genuine sorrow at their
destruction. Clancy manages one of the
most difficult tricks of modern writing.
He places technology in its rightful
place as an extension of human sen
sibilities. This may allow for greater
feeling and compassion, but it also in
troduces the possibility of greater
destruction.
This technology gives Clancy his
"bread and butter." Many readers —
including Secretary of the Navy Leh
man — have found his depiction of
military hardware and tactics so realis
tic that it nearly constitutes a breach of
national security. Indeed, reading a
Clancy novel gives one the feeling of
sitting through a Defense Department
briefing on modern warfare. This, in
the end, is the novel's great appeal.
Although his technological veracity

remains beyond reproach, Clancy has
some problems in unfolding the strate
gic side of the novel. The* premise of
the book — that the Soviets would
have to demobilize NATO before they
could assume control of the Persian
Gulf — seems a bit ludicrous. Also, in
order to keep the novel "clean," he
avoids depicting the use of chemical
warfare. This is also improbable.
Clancy shares his biggest stumbling
block with every other ambitious au
thor who has attempted to write
realistically of a third world war waged
without nuclear weapons — just how
to keep the warheads in their silos.
Discovering how his attempt fares,
in fact, is one of the major incentives
behind reading the book. As the situa
tion on the military map becomes
more heated and the politcal entangle
ments more intense, one wonders how
Clancy will save the world from a nu
clear holocaust. For a fan of final page
plot-twists, for a devotee of del is ex
machina, even for a connoisseur of the
improbable, Clancy's scheme to avoid
nuclear war is a winner.
For the rest of us, it underscores the
unlikelihood of a third world war ever
having a peaceful resolution.

"Red Storm Rising"

For someone with neither profes
