## Offense leads the way in Stanford's 93-81 victory 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Getting offensive production from sources
both expected and unexpected, the Stanford
Cardinal made its 1986-87 debut an impres
sive one with a 93-81 victory over the Nor
wegian National Team last night at Maples
Pavilion.
The loss dropped the Norwegians' record
on their 10-game West Coast tour to 3-3. They
had won three straight — over Oregon State,
Oregon and USF — before last night.
The Cardinal got 76 points from the four
players expected to carry most of its scoring
load, as Howard Wright scored 21 points, fol
lowed by Novian Whitsitt with 20, Todd Lichti
with 19 and Greg Butler with 16. However,
Stanford received offensive punch from a
more unlikely source, backup center Eric
Reveno.
The 6-foot-8 junior scored 12 points, hitting
6-of-10 shots from the floor. Five of Reveno's
baskets were the result of a right-handed
jump hook he perfected during the summer,
and the other came when he faked the hook,
then spun right and canned a baseline
jumper.
"I worked on it (the jump hook) over the
s*ummer. I had it before, but it wasn't game
ready,' Reveno said. "When you're playing
the post, you only need a couple of moves. It's
better to have two really good moves rather
than be a jack-of-all-trades but not do anything
real well.
"Rev's my kind of guy," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He works hard, and
he's really improved. He's been as good a
player as we've had (in practice). In practice,
it has been automatic."
Reveno's performance may have been
something of a shock to the crowd of 2,300,

but not to his teammates. "It was no surprise
to me," Wright said. "This year he's made up
his mind that he is going to play. And that
jump hook he's got — who's going to stop
him?"
Stanford's motion offense against Norway's
man-to-man defense enabled the Cardinal to
get the ball inside consistently to Reveno,
Wright and Butler. "They seemed pretty weak
defensively," Lichti said. "It didn't seem like
they really wanted to play defense, especially
in the low post."
One thing the Norwegians really did want
to do was hoist it from the outside. Norway
took 77 shots, most of them from long range,
including 15 three-pointers. The Norwegians
hit six of their three-point attempts, while
Stanford was 2-for-4.
Norway was looking for the three-pointer
the entire second half. Even on fast breaks,
the Norwegians often pulled up and bombed
away rather than attack the basket.
Trailing 42-36 at the half, the Norwegians
used the three-pointer to narrow the gap. In
the first 11 minutes of the second half, four
different Norway players connected from
three-point range; the fourth, guard Eivind
Gronli, brought Norway to within one at 70-
69 with 8:53 left.
The Norwegians were living by the three
pointer, but they soon died by it. After Haakon
Austefjord, who led all scorers with 25 points,
hit two free throws to put Norway ahead 75-74
with 6:06 to go, Lichti set himself behind the
three-point line on the right side and fired up
what the postgame notes called "a rain
maker."
What followed was not precipitation but
three points and a 77-75 Stanford lead it never
relinquished. "I knew that was a three
pointer," said Lichti, who also connected on
his only other three-point attempt. "I set

myself up for it. If you're going to shoot from
that far out, it might as well be for three
points."
The Cardinal took a tenuous 84-81 edge
into the final 2:19, but its spread offense was
in midseason form. While Norway's long
range game finally went cold, Stanford ran off
the game's final nine points.
Whitsitt began the final spurt with two free
throws, then took a perfect high-post pass
from Wright in for a layup that put Stanford
up by seven with 1:06 to go and more or less
ended the evening's suspense^
The 9-0 run was Stanford's second concer
ted surge of the game. The first came midway
through the first half. With 12 minutes left, the
game was tied at 17, but the Cardinal scored
11 unanswered points over the next three
minutes.
Whitsitt led the onslaught with six points.
First he buried two jumpers in front of the
soft defense of Peter Nettli, who was definitely
outmatched in the quickness department.
Then he was on the finishing end of a
textbook fast break started by a Wright steal
and-save.
Stanford shot 51 percent from the field in
the first half and committed only two turn
overs, but the Cardinal did have problems
keeping the Norwegians off the offensive
boards. Norway grabbed eight offensive
rebounds in the first half, including two easy
follow-ins in the last six minutes that helped
cut Stanford's lead to 42-36 at the half and had
Montgomery fuming on the bench.
Overall, though, the Stanford coach was
happy with the Cardinal's first outing. "For us
having to learn new things and considering
the caliber of the Norway team, I was
pleased," Montgomery said. "What I was par
ticularly pleased about is that the kids showed
some heart."
