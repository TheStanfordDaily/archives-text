# Confidentiality policy questioned
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole has
questioned the University's long
standing policy of confidentiality in
judicial cases, saying that a new cate
gory of incidents this year has led her
to question Stanford's self-imposed
gag rule.
In cases of "misconduct that is
already public before it receives Uni
versity scrutiny," the confidentiality
policy may be inappropriate, Cole
wrote in her annual judicial report.
Cole said she generally supports
Stanford's current policy, which
prohibits administrators from releas
ing names of offenders or discussing
the specifics of judicial cases. But she
said the University's Committee of Fif
teen — the body empowered to
modify Stanford's official legislative
and judicial charter — should consider
revising that policy for "public" cases.
"Misconduct that begins in the
public domain ... may present a class
of events where our traditional insis
tence upon confidentiality is unneces
sary or even inappropriate," Cole
wrote in her report, released Friday.
"In such cases, the behavioral facts
— what the student actually did — are
alreadv known rhronqh police records

and media reports. Given this funda
mental, initial characteristic, what pur
pose is served by keeping a tight lid on
the University's response to the behav
ior in question?"
Cole, asked Saturday which judicial
cases in the past year fell into the
"public" category and led her to ques
tion the University's confidentiality
policy, cited three: the fight on Lasuen
Mall in which two students pummeled
a third; the pie-throwing incident that
broke up an ASSU senate meeting; and
the forgery-theft case in which students
ran up a large bill at the Emporium.
Cole said that discussing cases such
as these — incidents that the local
media has covered extensively —
might "heighten the credibility of the

system as well as present opportunities
to raise and discuss the issues impor
tant to the University — which fre
quently do not coincide with the issues
important to law enforcement officers,
attorneys or court officials."
Administrators here explain that the
University uses its own rules, specifi
cally the code of behavior known as
the Fundamental Standard, when con
sidering judicial cases.
As an example of the differences be
tween University rules and state law,
administrators permit a 19-year-old
sophomore to drink alcohol even
though it is illegal for him to do so,
while they may punish a student for
plagiarism even if the offense does not
violate California law.
