# Field hockey shut out in Midwest Regional
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
lOWA CITY, lowa — The press sheet called Stan
ford the "sleeper" of the NCAA field hockey tourna
ment, but instead the Cardinal opened the Midwest
Regional as if it were asleep and gave up what proved
to be the decisive goal with slightly more than 11
minutes played in a 3-0 loss to Northwestern Satur-

; ""They looked nervous to me," Stanford"Coach
Sheryl Johnson said of her players. "(But) I think the
kids, after their first 10 minutes of nervousness,
played well. I don't think the score indicates how the
game was at all."
Lorette Vorstman put the Wildcats ahead to stay
with a rocket past Stanford goalie Karen Jones off a
penalty corner feed from Sannie Van Dijck. It was the
fifth goal in the last three games for the redhot
Vorstman, a sophomore from The Netherlands.
The first half ended with Stanford down 1-0, al
though the Cardinal began to threaten Northwestern
All-America goalie Robin Clark.
The Wildcats came out strong after the break as
Vorstman set up fellow Netherlands native Van Dijk
on a penalty corner at 31:57. The ball emerged from
a den of Wildcats in front of the Stanford goal and
found its way past Jones.
The Cardinal came fighting back, however, and
forward Kat Thomas appeared to have closed the gap
to 2-1 with a point blank goal 10 minutes later. The
goal was disallowed, though, as the referee ruled that
Thomas' score came on a "dangerous" shot.
"1 don't know," Thomas said of the controversial
call as she iced an injured right ankle that kept her

limping for much of the game. "It should have been a
goal. It just bounced back at me, and I just bunted it
■in.
"Ths referee called it dangerous because it was
listed, but that's legal — bad call, very bad call."
According to Johnson: "That could have been the
pivotal point in the game. We had momentum. When
they took away that goal, that took a lot out of our
game. I really disagree with that call."

"There were a lot of whistles," Northwestern
Coach Nancy Stevens said. "In some ways, the offi
cials took the game away from the players."
Down 2-0, instead of merely one goal behind with
more than 20 minutes to play, the Cardinal players
refused to quit. Their shirts soaked with sweat, they
kept the ball in the Wildcat end for much of the
second half, but to no avail.
Van Dijk would tally again for Northwestern on a
penalty corner with the game clock showing :00, al
though there were actually 10 seconds left as the offi
cial time was kept on the field.
For Stanford, it was a case of deja vu, because it
lost 3-0 to a Midwestern team in the first round of the
regional for the second straight year.
lowa Coach Judith Davidson, scouting the game
for her top-seeded Hawkeyes, believes the Cardinal
is handicapped by playing on the West Coast.
"They did some things well, but they didn't have a
sustained attack," she said. "I think Stanford has the
physical ability, (but) there just aren't enough teams
in California."
Stanford star forward and second-leading scorer
Maree Chung disagreed with Davidson's assessment.

"They (Northwestern) have a couple good
players," she said. "Overall, I don't think they're that
much better. I think we played a pretty even game."
Stanford's downfall proved to be penalty corners.
The Cardinal had three and could score on none.
Northwestern attempted 13 and made good on three.
"We changed our corners two weeks ago," Stevens
said. "And that's the reason we beat (No. 1) North
Carolina and that's the reason we won today."
, Northwestern, which
artificial turf of Dyche Stadium, may have also had an
advantage over the natural grass-based Cardinal on
the synthetic grass of the Indoor Practice Facility,
which Chung characterized as "very fast."
The game was moved onto the lowa football
team's practice field under an air-supported bubble
because the Hawkeyes met Purdue later that day at
Kinnick Stadium in a Big Ten Conference football
matchup.
With lowa City temperatures in the 20s and 30s
and traces of snow on the ground, though, the Card
inal was fortunate to be under the bubble.
The battle between Jones, perhaps the top goalie
on the West Coast, and Clark, the pride of the Mid
west, proved inconclusive. Jones gave up three goals
but faced 10 more penalty corners and made seven
more saves, while Clark saw her shutout saved by an
official's questionable call.
The loss dropped the No. 16 Cardinal's record to
12-5-1 and snapped the 10-game winning streak that
propelled the team into the NCAAs.
No. 11 Northwestern advanced to 15-3-2 and the
regional title game against the Hawkeyes yesterday,
where it lost 2-1 to lowa.

"1 don't know," Thomas said of the controversial
call as she iced an injured right ankle that kept her

limping for much of the game. "It should have been a
goal. It just bounced back at me, and I just bunted it
■in.
"Ths referee called it dangerous because it was
listed, but that's legal — bad call, very bad call."
According to Johnson: "That could have been the
pivotal point in the game. We had momentum. When
they took away that goal, that took a lot out of our
game. I really disagree with that call."

"There were a lot of whistles," Northwestern
Coach Nancy Stevens said. "In some ways, the offi
cials took the game away from the players."
Down 2-0, instead of merely one goal behind with
more than 20 minutes to play, the Cardinal players
refused to quit. Their shirts soaked with sweat, they
kept the ball in the Wildcat end for much of the
second half, but to no avail.
Van Dijk would tally again for Northwestern on a
penalty corner with the game clock showing :00, al
though there were actually 10 seconds left as the offi
cial time was kept on the field.
For Stanford, it was a case of deja vu, because it
lost 3-0 to a Midwestern team in the first round of the
regional for the second straight year.
lowa Coach Judith Davidson, scouting the game
for her top-seeded Hawkeyes, believes the Cardinal
is handicapped by playing on the West Coast.
"They did some things well, but they didn't have a
sustained attack," she said. "I think Stanford has the
physical ability, (but) there just aren't enough teams
in California."
Stanford star forward and second-leading scorer
Maree Chung disagreed with Davidson's assessment.

"They (Northwestern) have a couple good
players," she said. "Overall, I don't think they're that
much better. I think we played a pretty even game."
Stanford's downfall proved to be penalty corners.
The Cardinal had three and could score on none.
Northwestern attempted 13 and made good on three.
"We changed our corners two weeks ago," Stevens
said. "And that's the reason we beat (No. 1) North
Carolina and that's the reason we won today."
, Northwestern, which
artificial turf of Dyche Stadium, may have also had an
advantage over the natural grass-based Cardinal on
the synthetic grass of the Indoor Practice Facility,
which Chung characterized as "very fast."
The game was moved onto the lowa football
team's practice field under an air-supported bubble
because the Hawkeyes met Purdue later that day at
Kinnick Stadium in a Big Ten Conference football
matchup.
With lowa City temperatures in the 20s and 30s
and traces of snow on the ground, though, the Card
inal was fortunate to be under the bubble.
The battle between Jones, perhaps the top goalie
on the West Coast, and Clark, the pride of the Mid
west, proved inconclusive. Jones gave up three goals
but faced 10 more penalty corners and made seven
more saves, while Clark saw her shutout saved by an
official's questionable call.
The loss dropped the No. 16 Cardinal's record to
12-5-1 and snapped the 10-game winning streak that
propelled the team into the NCAAs.
No. 11 Northwestern advanced to 15-3-2 and the
regional title game against the Hawkeyes yesterday,
where it lost 2-1 to lowa.
lOWA CITY, lowa — The press sheet called Stan
ford the "sleeper" of the NCAA field hockey tourna

Regional as if it were asleep and gave up what proved
to be the decisive goal with slightly more than 11
minutes played in a 3-0 loss to Northwestern Satur-

; ""They looked nervous to me," Stanford"Coach
Sheryl Johnson said of her players. "(But) I think the
kids, after their first 10 minutes of nervousness,
played well. I don't think the score indicates how the
game was at all."
Lorette Vorstman put the Wildcats ahead to stay
with a rocket past Stanford goalie Karen Jones off a
penalty corner feed from Sannie Van Dijck. It was the
fifth goal in the last three games for the redhot
Vorstman, a sophomore from The Netherlands.
The first half ended with Stanford down 1-0, al
though the Cardinal began to threaten Northwestern
All-America goalie Robin Clark.
The Wildcats came out strong after the break as
Vorstman set up fellow Netherlands native Van Dijk
on a penalty corner at 31:57. The ball emerged from
a den of Wildcats in front of the Stanford goal and
found its way past Jones.
The Cardinal came fighting back, however, and
forward Kat Thomas appeared to have closed the gap
to 2-1 with a point blank goal 10 minutes later. The
goal was disallowed, though, as the referee ruled that
Thomas' score came on a "dangerous" shot.
"1 don't know," Thomas said of the controversial
call as she iced an injured right ankle that kept her

limping for much of the game. "It should have been a
