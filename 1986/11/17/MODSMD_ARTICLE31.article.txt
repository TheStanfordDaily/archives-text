# Stanford done in by Wildcats' Dutch Duo

lOWA CITY, lowa — "Double
Dutch" may be a jump rope term, but
Northwestern Coach Nancy Stevens
likes the looks of her "Dutch treat" on
a field hockey team.
Sannie Van Dijck and Lorette
Vorstman, two sophomore backers
from The Netherlands, combined to
score all three Wildcat goals and added
an assist apiece in Saturday's 3-0 NCAA
Midwest Regional win over Stanford.
"Those two are highlighted on our
(penalty) corners," Stevens said after
watching her Wildcats score all three
of their goals on penalty corners.
Northwestern looks to Van Dijck and
Vorstman on penalty corners because,
as Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson said,
"They hit the ball really hard."
"They're both good players," said
lowa Coach Judith Davidson, whose
Hawkeyes defeated Northwestern in
yesterday's regional final. "They're
physically big and solid, and both have
decent speed. Those Dutch kids grow

up with hockey sticks in their hands —
just like our kids play basketball."
Vorstman begaon playing field
hockey at the age of eight and later
teamed with Van Dijck on the Dutch
18-and-under squad. After leaving the
National Lyceum, she decided to fol
low the path of other Dutch players —
like Judith Jonkheers, the star of No. 1
North Carolina — to America.
"A lot of Dutch girls come to the
States to study," Vorstman said. "We
(she and Van Dijck) just wrote (to
Northwestern), and they offered us a
scholarship."
Both players ranked among the
Wildcats top scorers last year as they
helped Northwestern to a third-place
NCAA finish. This season, Vorstman
and Van Dijck were the Wildcats top
two scorers. Van Dijck tallied two goals
against Stanford Saturday, while
Vorstman has been on fire of late with
five goals in the three games leading
up to yesterday's final.
Both have adjusted to the American
style of play.
"I'm getting so into American field
hockey that I've almost forgotten how
we play at home," Van Dijck said.
Here it's just get the ball in the goal.
The first day we were here, they (the
other Northwestern players) were
going crazy (in practice), but I really
enjoy it.
According to Vorst,man, U.S. field
hockey is "a lot more physical and
faster, but they (U.S. players) don't pay
as much attention to techniques."
With two years of eligibility left, Van
Dijck and Vorstman will be looking to

continue a strong Northwestern Held
hockey tradition that has seen the
Wildcats qualih for the NCAAs the last
five wars.
The "big two, little eight Big Ten
football dominance of Michigan and
Ohio State pales in comparison to the
hold Northwestern and lowa have on
the conference in field hockey.
A Purdue win over Northwestern
earlier this year marked the first time
any conference team had defeated
either of the real big two in the last
four years.
On Saturday, however, Stanford
could well have beaten the Big Ten's
best were it not for the scoring of
Northwestern's talented "Dutch treat."
