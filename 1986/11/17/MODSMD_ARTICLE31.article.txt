lOWA CITY, lowa — "Double
Dutch" may be a jump rope term, but
Northwestern Coach Nancy Stevens
likes the looks of her "Dutch treat" on
a field hockey team.
Sannie Van Dijck and Lorette
Vorstman, two sophomore backers
from The Netherlands, combined to
score all three Wildcat goals and added

Midwest Regional win over Stanford.

"A lot of Dutch girls come to the
States to study," Vorstman said. "We
(she and Van Dijck) just wrote (to
Northwestern), and they offered us a

Both players ranked among the
Wildcats top scorers last year as they
helped Northwestern to a third-place
NCAA finish. This season, Vorstman
and Van Dijck were the Wildcats top
two scorers. Van Dijck tallied two goals
against Stanford Saturday, while
Vorstman has been on fire of late with
five goals in the three games leading
up to yesterday's final.
Both have adjusted to the American
