# Card swimmers upset by Texas
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
Sometimes, for the sake of realism,
the good guy dies. Even Casey struck
out once. So it went Saturday for the
Stanford men's swimming team when
it fell short 64-49 and had its streak of
47 consecutive dual meet victories
halted by Texas.
After posting an earlier 88-25 victory
over an out-manned SMI ! squad the
previous evening, Stanford confronted
an anxious and hungry Longhorn team
that prepared weeks in advance for the
Cardinal.
"They really got ready for us, Stan
ford Coach Skip Kenney said. "They
weren't afraid of our world class ath
lete names."
The extra preparation paid of! for
Texas as the Longhorns swept in both
the 100-yard freestyle and the 200-yard
breaststroke, good enough for a
decisive lead going into the final
relays.
"They outswam us in a lot of events,
senior captain Sam McAdam said.
We'll have to try to evaluate it (the
loss) and treat it as a learning experi
ence."
Not winning is a bit of a new experi
ence for the dapper Kenney, who loses
about as often as he grows a goatee.
"It (the loss) really was a shock,
Kenney said. "I kept thinking that we d
Â£>ull it out. The whole thing was like a
bad dream in slow motion We kept
battling, but they kept winning the big
faces."

Despite the loss, the Cardinal's first
in four years, Stanford came away
feeling positive about the overall ef
fort.
"Nothing negative came out of the
meet except for a scratch on a few
numbers," junior Anthony Mosse said.
"Nothing to be ashamed of. It gives us
something to think about in that last set
(in workouts).
We swam well. I'm extremely
proud of the team. Not once did we
quit or slow down. We fought hard un
til the final event," Kenney added. "It's
a little early to start thinking about
peaking. We're right on schedule, and I
feel great about what we're doing."
Kenney highlighted the efforts of
Mosse and Sean Murphy, who both
swam NCAA qualifying times in their
respective events, the 200-yard butter
fly and the 200-yard backstroke.
Mosse, who was a little surprised by
his strong times, attributed his success
to "staying healthy for the first time."
Mosse was hampered last year by the
chicken pox and other nagging ail
ments.
The Cardinal also received strong
performances from 1984 Olympians
Pablo Morales and Jeff Kostoff.
Morales, swimming in his "off events,
used his water polo sprint condition
ing to register firsts in the 50-yard
freestyle and 200-yard breaststroke
against SMI! while recording impres
sive butterfly splits in the 400-yard
medlev relay.
Kostoff finished first in the 1,000-
yard freestyle against both SMU and
Texas.
The Stanford freshmen, meanwhile,
turned in what Mosse called "gutsy

performances." Rookies John Witchell
and Lunn Lestina took turns winning
the 500-yard freestyle with Witchell
winning at Texas and Lunn at SMU.
Both swam lifetime bests, .
The Cardinal got a big, somewhat
unexpected, boost from sophomore
diver Matt Frawley, who finished first
and second in the three-meter diving
event over the weekend.
