With only three weeks remaining before the NCAA
playoffs begin, the Stanford women's volleyball team has
found another way to win.
In the past, the Cardinal has shown it has the talent to
blow almost any team off the court, but has occasionally
come up short in mental toughness and determination.
This weekend at Maples Pavilion, however, Stanford won
two matches it could easily have lost, beating Arizona
State, 15-12,13-15,15-12,15-3, on Friday and Arizona, 15-
11, 15-9, 7-15, 6-15, 15-7, on Saturday.
The Cardinal extended its Pacific 10 Conference win
ning streak to 13 matches and upped its Pac-10 record to
14-1. The two wins pushed Stanford into a first-place tie
with UCLA, and the Cardinal technically has the lead by
virtue of its win over the Bruins earlier this year.
Stanford next faces California at Berkeley on Tuesday
night, then heads south for a showdown with the Bruins
on Friday. Considering that no other Pac-10 team has
fewer than five conference losses, this contest will
decide the league title.
Friday night Stanford played 13th-ranked Arizona
State, which returned five starters from the team that
handed Stanford its only conference loss last year. The
No. 9 Cardinal expected a tough match, and, unlike the
first meeting this year between the two teams, it almost
got more than it could handle.
The first two games were long, back-and-forth affairs,
highlighted by Nancy Reno's well-timed kills for Stanford
and Regina Stahls fine setting and dumping for the Sun
Devils. Stanford took the first game, but Valentina Vega's
serving carried ASU to a game-two win, bringing the
visitors back from a 13-10 deficit with Five straight points.
According to Stanford Coach Don Shaw, there were
two keys to the match. "The first key was Vega's serving,"

he said. "They came out serving ag
gressively, going for the lines.
In the first two games, the Sun
Devils' serving was outstanding, but
ASU finally slowed down.
The second key was w hat happened
when the Sun Devils came out in the
third game hotter than the Tempe sun
in August. The Cardinal rallied behind
the serving of Reno from a 9-5 deficit
to win 15-12.
"Stanford hung in there, Shaw said.
Game four was again characterized
by Reno's hitting, as well as the stellar
defense of Lara Asper and Brook Bin
ley, who combined for four aces and
13 digs on the night. According to Stan
ford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves, "Lara
played her best match of the season
and Brook was great. Her job is to go
in and make no mistakes."
The 5-foot-8-inch sophomore made
none and was a major factor in Stan
ford's jumping out to a 13-1 lead when
ASU cooled off in game four. The Sun
Devils then came back to life, but it was
much too late for them to avoid their
fifth conference loss.
Reno, a 5-11 junior, had her best
performance of the year with three
solo blocks, five block assists, 22 kills
and six service aces — all match highs.
Saturday's match was much different
as the Cardinal faced a good Arizona
team. Shaw said: "They (Stanford)
came out flat, not moving."

In the fifth game, Stanford showed
great intensity and got it together and
played well when it mattered most,
according to Shaw.
Reno again had a great night; she
and Teresa Smith led both teams with
24 kills each. Games one and two again
featured the fine serving and defense
of Asper (six aces and 12 digs) and Bin
ley (two aces, three digs and a back
row kill to end game two), as Stanford
raced out to an early lead.
Games three and four were just the
opposite — Lindsey Hahn and Beth
Raymond served up many of their nine
aces and the Wildcats stopped making
hitting errors (seven each in games
one and two, two total in games three
and four).
The result was a match tied at two
games apeice. Game four was key for
Stanford, however, in regaining mo
mentum. Jessica Benton came in with
the Cardinal trailing 14-2 to give Wendi
Rush a well-deserved rest and helped
the Cardinal score four points.
This momentum switch became ap
parent in game five with Stanford
hanging in well. With the Cardinal 1
leading 8-7, it became Asper time. The j
5-11 freshman showed why she was I
the most sought-after recruit in the na- I
tion last year by coming in and serving j
out the match.
Asper started with two aces, then
forced bad passes, decimating
Arizona's offensive scheme. After two
kills by Barbra Fontana and three by
Reno, the match was over and Stanford
was 18-8 overall.

ning streak to 13 matches and upped its Pac-10 record to
14-1. The two wins pushed Stanford into a first-place tie
with UCLA, and the Cardinal technically has the lead by
virtue of its win over the Bruins earlier this year.
Stanford next faces California at Berkeley on Tuesday
night, then heads south for a showdown with the Bruins
on Friday. Considering that no other Pac-10 team has
fewer than five conference losses, this contest will
decide the league title.
Friday night Stanford played 13th-ranked Arizona
State, which returned five starters from the team that
handed Stanford its only conference loss last year. The
No. 9 Cardinal expected a tough match, and, unlike the
first meeting this year between the two teams, it almost
got more than it could handle.
The first two games were long, back-and-forth affairs,
highlighted by Nancy Reno's well-timed kills for Stanford
and Regina Stahls fine setting and dumping for the Sun
Devils. Stanford took the first game, but Valentina Vega's
serving carried ASU to a game-two win, bringing the
visitors back from a 13-10 deficit with Five straight points.
According to Stanford Coach Don Shaw, there were
two keys to the match. "The first key was Vega's serving,"

he said. "They came out serving ag
gressively, going for the lines.
In the first two games, the Sun
Devils' serving was outstanding, but
ASU finally slowed down.
The second key was w hat happened
when the Sun Devils came out in the
third game hotter than the Tempe sun
in August. The Cardinal rallied behind
the serving of Reno from a 9-5 deficit
to win 15-12.
"Stanford hung in there, Shaw said.
Game four was again characterized
by Reno's hitting, as well as the stellar
defense of Lara Asper and Brook Bin
ley, who combined for four aces and
13 digs on the night. According to Stan
ford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves, "Lara
played her best match of the season
and Brook was great. Her job is to go
in and make no mistakes."
The 5-foot-8-inch sophomore made
none and was a major factor in Stan
ford's jumping out to a 13-1 lead when
ASU cooled off in game four. The Sun
Devils then came back to life, but it was
much too late for them to avoid their
fifth conference loss.
Reno, a 5-11 junior, had her best
performance of the year with three
solo blocks, five block assists, 22 kills
and six service aces — all match highs.
Saturday's match was much different
as the Cardinal faced a good Arizona
team. Shaw said: "They (Stanford)
came out flat, not moving."

In the fifth game, Stanford showed
great intensity and got it together and
played well when it mattered most,
according to Shaw.
Reno again had a great night; she
and Teresa Smith led both teams with
24 kills each. Games one and two again
featured the fine serving and defense
of Asper (six aces and 12 digs) and Bin
ley (two aces, three digs and a back
row kill to end game two), as Stanford
raced out to an early lead.
Games three and four were just the
opposite — Lindsey Hahn and Beth
Raymond served up many of their nine
aces and the Wildcats stopped making
hitting errors (seven each in games
one and two, two total in games three
and four).
The result was a match tied at two
games apeice. Game four was key for
Stanford, however, in regaining mo
mentum. Jessica Benton came in with
the Cardinal trailing 14-2 to give Wendi
Rush a well-deserved rest and helped
the Cardinal score four points.
This momentum switch became ap
parent in game five with Stanford
hanging in well. With the Cardinal 1
leading 8-7, it became Asper time. The j
5-11 freshman showed why she was I
the most sought-after recruit in the na- I
tion last year by coming in and serving j
out the match.
Asper started with two aces, then
forced bad passes, decimating
Arizona's offensive scheme. After two
kills by Barbra Fontana and three by
Reno, the match was over and Stanford
was 18-8 overall.
With only three weeks remaining before the NCAA
playoffs begin, the Stanford women's volleyball team has
found another way to win.
In the past, the Cardinal has shown it has the talent to
blow almost any team off the court, but has occasionally
come up short in mental toughness and determination.
This weekend at Maples Pavilion, however, Stanford won
two matches it could easily have lost, beating Arizona
State, 15-12,13-15,15-12,15-3, on Friday and Arizona, 15-
11, 15-9, 7-15, 6-15, 15-7, on Saturday.
