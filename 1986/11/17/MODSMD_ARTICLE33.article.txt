With only three weeks remaining before the NCAA
playoffs begin, the Stanford women's volleyball team has
found another way to win.
In the past, the Cardinal has shown it has the talent to
blow almost any team off the court, but has occasionally
come up short in mental toughness and determination.
This weekend at Maples Pavilion, however, Stanford won
two matches it could easily have lost, beating Arizona
State, 15-12,13-15,15-12,15-3, on Friday and Arizona, 15-
11, 15-9, 7-15, 6-15, 15-7, on Saturday.
The Cardinal extended its Pacific 10 Conference win
ning streak to 13 matches and upped its Pac-10 record to
14-1. The two wins pushed Stanford into a first-place tie
with UCLA, and the Cardinal technically has the lead by
virtue of its win over the Bruins earlier this year.
Stanford next faces California at Berkeley on Tuesday
night, then heads south for a showdown with the Bruins
on Friday. Considering that no other Pac-10 team has
fewer than five conference losses, this contest will
decide the league title.
Friday night Stanford played 13th-ranked Arizona
State, which returned five starters from the team that
handed Stanford its only conference loss last year. The
No. 9 Cardinal expected a tough match, and, unlike the
first meeting this year between the two teams, it almost
got more than it could handle.
The first two games were long, back-and-forth affairs,
highlighted by Nancy Reno's well-timed kills for Stanford
and Regina Stahls fine setting and dumping for the Sun
Devils. Stanford took the first game, but Valentina Vega's
serving carried ASU to a game-two win, bringing the
visitors back from a 13-10 deficit with Five straight points.
According to Stanford Coach Don Shaw, there were
two keys to the match. "The first key was Vega's serving,"

Wildcats in five games to move into first place in the Pac-10.
