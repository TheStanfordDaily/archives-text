# Women take 2nd at District 8 meet
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
As the city of Fresno basks in the
light of national attention from its
own comic miniseries, the Stanford
cross country teams excited the
scene Saturday with bittersweet
emotions as the Cardinal women
secured themselves a spot in the
NCAA finals while the men had
their championship aspirations
squelched by a fifth-place finish in
the District 8 Regionals.
The women's squad certainly has
reason to celebrate. Stanford placed
second in the race with 72 points,
just three points more than first
place finisher UCLA. Both teams ad
vanced to the NCAAs, to be held in
Tucson, Ariz., on Nov. 24.
Once again, freshman Carol Gray
led the Cardinal effort. Gray
finished the 5,000-meter race in
16:45 6, her best time of the season,
to garner third place, equaling her
finish last week in the Pacific 10
Conference Championships held at
Stanford.
Her teammates put in solid ef
forts as well. Junior Kathy Smith

finished seventh in 17:01.4, while
junior Cory Schubert ran perhaps
her best race of the season, com
pleting the course in a time of
17:15 0, good for 10th place.
The women's team will return to
the NCAAs after a one-year absence,
a hiatus that the Stanford men will
experience this season following
their disappointing finish Saturday.
The Cardinal, favored to place in
the top three and return to the
finals, settled for fifth place in the
10,000-meter race.
Arizona duplicated its success in
the Fac-lOs by taking the District 8
title.
The Cardinal's hopes of an indi
vidual participant qualifying for the
finals were clashed as well. Marc
Olesen, the senior captain for Stan
ford and the top runner returning
from the 1985 NCAA finals, missed a
spot by one place, finishing less
than 5 seconds behind UCLA's Mark
Junkerman. Olesen had to settle for
seventh, after crossing the finish
line in 30:35.0.
The other Stanford hopeful,
senior Ryan Stoll, finished 14th with
a time of 30:57.3-
