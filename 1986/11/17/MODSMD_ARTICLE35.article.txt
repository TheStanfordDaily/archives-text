### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
If last weekend's tennis tournament is any indication, the
Stanford women's tennis team is in good hands this season.
Even without its top three players in singles action, the
Cardinal placed three performers, including a freshman, in
the singles semifinals, winning both the singles and doubles
competition in the Rolex/Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches As
sociation Northern California Women's Tennis Tournament
at the varsity tennis courts.
"The tournament is a preview of things to come," Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan said. "It's a chance to test some
of the freshmen out. We really made some great showings.
Senior Stephanie Savides captured the singles title and
combined with teammate Patty Fendick yesterday to win the
doubles crown.
Savides, last year's No. 4 singles player and the tourna
ment's No. 2 seed, defeated No. 1 seeded Karen Shin of Cali
fornia in the finals 3-6,6-3, 6-2. Shin is the Bears' top player.
"It was a mild upset," Brennan said. "She (Savides) played
really well. It establishes her as a strong All-America candi
date for this year."
Savides teamed with Fendick as the No. 1 seed to win four
doubles matches and upend the No. 2-seeded Cal tandem of
Sharon Fletcher and Caroline Yao in the finals, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5),
7-6(7-3).
In winning the tournament, Savides in singles and the
Savides/Fendick doubles pair qualified for the Rolex/ITCA
National Indoor Championships later this year.
In addition to Savides, several other Stanford players
played impressively in the singles tournament.
No. 4-seeded junior Kay Tittle and No. 5-seeded freshman
Lisa Green were the other Cardinal players to make it into
the semifinal round.
Tittle, who performed at No. 5 singles last season for
Cardinal, was defeated by Shin 7-6, 6-4. Green, who is Staii*
ford's top recruit this year, fell to Savides 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
"For a freshman to come in and play so well is realty
rare," Brennan said of Green's performance this weekend.
