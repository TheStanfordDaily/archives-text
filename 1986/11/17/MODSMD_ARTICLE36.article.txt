### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
It was a weekend of ups and downs
for the Stanford fencing team.
In the season opener for the Card
inal, the women's team was a 10-6 vic
tor in a non-conference matchup at
UC-Santa Cruz on Saturday, while the
men's squad fell to Santa Cruz 17-10.
The women were led by senior foil
competitors Holly Taylor and Alyson
Yarus. Taylor, coming off a 45-10 1985-
86 campaign, was 4-0, and Yarus
finished at 3-1 on the day. Yarus was
14-11 last year.
"Santa Cruz has an experienced and
a strong team," Stanford Coach Buzz
Hurst said. "I was very pleased with
their (Stanford players') performance.

I think Taylor is the strongest woman
in the region this year, and she cer
tainly did nothing on Saturday to
change my opinion of her."
The men, however, did not fare
quite as well as the women.
In the foil division, the Cardinal was
forced to use several younger players
and was bested by an 8-1 margin.
"Our foil team really got clob
bered," Hurst said. "It was probably a
result of inexperience."
The men were also mastered in the
epee division, falling 6-3- The sabre di
vision provided some consolation for
the Cardinal, however, as it won 6-3-
Senior co-captains Larry Murk and
Steve Levitan helped Stanford avoid an
even more lopsided defeat, both
finishing with 3-0 personal records.
