# Students criticize Vienna campus closure
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
The decision to close the overseas campus in
Vienna has left many who attended the campus
critical of the reasons given for the closure and
angry that student opinions were not more
widely consulted.
But beyond the emotions that came to the
surface at news of the Vienna shutdown, it is now
up to students to decide whether the decision to
close the Vienna program represents a shift in the
goals of Stanford's Overseas Studies Program. If
the move does signify such a shift, both students
and administrators must consider whether the
current review process allows for sufficient stu
dent input.

News Analysis

Judging by student reaction, the Vienna deci
sion managed to spark significant dissatisfaction
with the process used to evaluate overseas pro
grams.
"I feel it was really underhanded," senior Cathy
McDonnell said. Students "were shut out, we
weren't really consulted, and by the time we
found out about it, it was a fait accompli."
"We weren't even aware that they were consid
ering closing the Vienna campus," senior Lisa
Goebbel said. "Nobody asked our opinion about

the classes, the housing or the administrators."
"They should have some open discussion
before they consider closing an overseas
campus," senior Hans Steinhoffer said. "Our atti
tude is just as important as their evaluation of the
program. We're the ones who take the classes and
participate in the program."
"1 feel like this was done totally behind our
backs," junior Paul Dembiczak said. "The first I
heard about it was the story in The Daily."
Nancy Padgett, deputy director of Overseas
Studies, said she visited the Vienna campus twice
last year. For her first visit, Padgett traveled to
Vienna during spring vacation and spoke with
one student. Padgett made her second visit to
Vienna near the end of spring quarter. Those who
were present say Padgett asked for questions
from students, but did not inform them that the
Vienna campus was being reviewed and might be
shut down.
"She never said the program was being
reviewed," junior Gary Castro said. "She should
have said 'Our committee thinks these changes
should be made How do you who are en
rolled here feel about it?' "
According to Thomas Heller, director of the
Overseas Studies Program, a panel established to
look at the Stanford campuses in Central Europe
spent last year talking to Vienna program admi
nistrators, Vienna faculty and faculty members
here whose interests are tied to Austria.
"They obviously didn't talk to the students

there," senior Bronia Whipp said. "Because as far
as we're concerned, the experience is great."
That panel issued a recommendation to cut the
Vienna program.
Seven faculty members and one student sat on
the panel. According to Heller, the student repre
sentative had formerly participated in the Univer
sity's Vienna program. Though no vote was taken,
the recommendation was unanimous, according
to Heller, because the committee operates on a
consensus model.
On receipt of the panel's recommendation, the
Overseas Studies Program Committee voted 7-2
in favor of closing the campus. The two student
members on the committee both voted against
the recommendation.
With three students directly involved in the
decision to close the Vienna campus and two of
them voting against that decision, it is natural to
ask whether Overseas Studies based their assess
ment of student opinion on the statements of one
student representative.
"Where do they get off using one student's
opinion as representative of all students?" Stein
hoffer asked. "You have to talk to a number of stu
dents before you can build a consensus."
Students: reasons for closure unclear
Had students been more aware of Overseas
Studies' concerns about the Vienna program, they
say they might also be able to better understand

the reasons for its closure.
Padgett told students meeting with her last
Wednesday that interest in the Berlin campus has
gone "way up" while interest in Vienna has
declined dramatically in recent years. Though in
terest in the Vienna program has fallen since the
inception of the Berlin program, Padgett said the
number of students enrolled in Berlin who are
not involved in Berlin's internship program is
"about the same" as the number of students at the
Vienna campus.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee told a Daily reporter last week that the
only time Vienna was "even close" to full enroll
ment was when the Stanford Chorale was based
there last winter.
But those who were in Vienna last winter have
had trouble understanding the Overseas Studies
Office's definition.of "full enrollment."
When the Stanford Chorale brought approxi
mately 30 people to Vienna last year, sufficient
dormitory space did not exist to house all stu
dents. Students at the Vienna campus who were
not in the Chorale were placed in dormitories
throughout Vienna (as they regularly are) while
Chorale members lived together in a hotel,
rented for their use.
"I don't think they can expect the campus to do
what they never set it up to do," said senior Joel
Bosch, a former member of the Chorale.
Padgett and other Overseas Studies
administrators now say that "full en
rollment " does not refer to the
capacity of a campus but rather to the
"ideal enrollment aim" of 40-50
people that the office would like at
each of the overseas campuses. Padgett
also notes that both Berlin and Vienna
have fallen short of this target.
Some students feel it would have
been possible to save the Vienna pro
gram had they known about the review
process. Would increased enrollment
in the Vienna program have foiled the
plans of Overseas Studies to chanel
funds into a stronger, culturally "more
desirable" program in Berlin?
Publicity might have helped
Students meeting with Padgett and
Heller last week suggested that the low
enrollment problem in Vienna might
have been solved by increased
publicity for the Vienna campus and in
quired whether this tactic had been
tried. Heller said that Overseas Studies
had not increased publicity on the

Vienna program.
The Overseas Studies Office might
have actually discouraged students
from applying to the Vienna campus,
according to Joel Simpson, a senior
who attended both the Vienna and the
Berlin campuses last year.
Simpson said a fellow student inter
ested in studying overseas told him
that an administrator from the Over
seas Studies Office advised him to ap
ply to Berlin.
That student was apparently told that
students who had attended both
campuses generally preferred Berlin
and that Vienna was "more in the past,"
Simpson said.
According to senior Miki Akimoto,
the Berlin program is promoted "way
out of context" because of emphasis
placed on engineering internships of
fered through the program.
Heller said that conversations with
faculty members and Austrian scholars
led to a desire to restructure the
Vienna curriculum.
"On paper, the Vienna curriculum
looks very good, but we got the
message that (the directors of the
Vienna campus) were not coming up
with the things we wanted," Padgett
said.
According to McDonnell, students

might have provided a good communi
cation link between Overseas Studies
and the Vienna administration — had
they been made aware of the review
process going on at the time.
"Sometimes 1 think there are a lot of
big egos in Overseas Studies who don't
really want to learn how a country
operates, but just want to go in and
impose their own way of doing
things," McDonnell said.
Heller said he decided "new blood"
was needed in the Vienna administra
tion since "I wanted internships and I
wanted other things, and nothing came
of it."
But, conversations with government
officials and Austrian scholars left Hel
ler with the impression that Austria is
currently politically paralyzed and that
"bright, young Austrian scholars just
aren't interested in helping a strug
gling American program."
A push toward internships
What will remain for students inter
ested in Austria is still unclear. Heller
hopes to create internships available to
students who first study for one quar
ter in Berlin, but the internships are
not yet in place.
Most students criticized the decision

to shut down the Vienna program
before the internships were estab
lished.
"(Heller) himself said the country is
paralyzed, so in a year, when they can't
get the internships, they can just let the
idea die quietly," Castro said.
Bosch, who attended the Vienna
program winter quarter of last year
and then stopped out to work in
Austria during the spring, said he
doubts Overseas Studies will be able to
arrange internships in Austria.
The Austrian requirements for legal
working papers "are much more strin
gent," than those in Germany, Bosch
said. "They have small sales offices
with a staff of 10 front people," he said.
"They just don't have the facilities they
have in Germany."
"I think it's a poor substitute to say
that you have to go to Berlin for one
quarter and then can go to Vienna,"
senior Karyl Fox said. Fox attended
both the Berlin and Vienna campuses
last year and said Overseas Studies "is
doing a really bad job trying to com
pare the two."
Vienna's cultural value debated
Above all, students criticize com
ments made by German Studies Prof.

Russell Berman and Heller that Berlin
is "culturally more desirable" than
Vienna.
"Vienna flourished and it was very
important up until 1918," Heller said.
"But that's over. Berlin has a very con
temporary, avant-garde culture."
"Then you're basically saying that
history has no value," Simpson said.
Students who met with Heller and
Padgett last week questioned the am
bition of the Overseas Studies
Program in its desire to restructure the
Vienna program. Many felt that only
those students arriving in Europe with
extremely advanced language skills
would be able to benefit from the ac
cessibility to research institutes and
foreign scholars that Overseas Studies
stresses.
Overseas Studies is looking mofe
toward centers in "new," "dynamic"
cities where more industry will allow
more opportunities for internships,
Bosch said.
"Heller wants to fundamentally and
basically change the direction of Over
seas Studies," Bosch said. "He's trying
to create the power brokers of the
future in international affairs."
Students will need to decide if that's
a direction they support.
The decision to close the overseas campus in
Vienna has left many who attended the campus
critical of the reasons given for the closure and
angry that student opinions were not more
widely consulted.

should be made How do you who are en
rolled here feel about it?' "
According to Thomas Heller, director of the
Overseas Studies Program, a panel established to
look at the Stanford campuses in Central Europe
spent last year talking to Vienna program admi
nistrators, Vienna faculty and faculty members
here whose interests are tied to Austria.
"They obviously didn't talk to the students

there," senior Bronia Whipp said. "Because as far
as we're concerned, the experience is great."
That panel issued a recommendation to cut the
Vienna program.
Seven faculty members and one student sat on
the panel. According to Heller, the student repre
sentative had formerly participated in the Univer
sity's Vienna program. Though no vote was taken,
the recommendation was unanimous, according
to Heller, because the committee operates on a
consensus model.
On receipt of the panel's recommendation, the
Overseas Studies Program Committee voted 7-2
in favor of closing the campus. The two student
members on the committee both voted against
the recommendation.
With three students directly involved in the
decision to close the Vienna campus and two of
them voting against that decision, it is natural to
ask whether Overseas Studies based their assess
ment of student opinion on the statements of one
student representative.
"Where do they get off using one student's
opinion as representative of all students?" Stein
hoffer asked. "You have to talk to a number of stu
dents before you can build a consensus."
Students: reasons for closure unclear
Had students been more aware of Overseas
Studies' concerns about the Vienna program, they
say they might also be able to better understand

the reasons for its closure.
Padgett told students meeting with her last
Wednesday that interest in the Berlin campus has
gone "way up" while interest in Vienna has
declined dramatically in recent years. Though in
terest in the Vienna program has fallen since the
inception of the Berlin program, Padgett said the
number of students enrolled in Berlin who are
not involved in Berlin's internship program is
"about the same" as the number of students at the
Vienna campus.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee told a Daily reporter last week that the
only time Vienna was "even close" to full enroll
ment was when the Stanford Chorale was based
there last winter.
But those who were in Vienna last winter have
had trouble understanding the Overseas Studies
Office's definition.of "full enrollment."
When the Stanford Chorale brought approxi
mately 30 people to Vienna last year, sufficient
dormitory space did not exist to house all stu
dents. Students at the Vienna campus who were
not in the Chorale were placed in dormitories
throughout Vienna (as they regularly are) while
Chorale members lived together in a hotel,
rented for their use.
"I don't think they can expect the campus to do
what they never set it up to do," said senior Joel
Bosch, a former member of the Chorale.
Padgett and other Overseas Studies
administrators now say that "full en
rollment " does not refer to the
capacity of a campus but rather to the
"ideal enrollment aim" of 40-50
people that the office would like at
each of the overseas campuses. Padgett
also notes that both Berlin and Vienna
have fallen short of this target.
Some students feel it would have
been possible to save the Vienna pro
gram had they known about the review
process. Would increased enrollment
in the Vienna program have foiled the
plans of Overseas Studies to chanel
funds into a stronger, culturally "more
desirable" program in Berlin?
Publicity might have helped
Students meeting with Padgett and
Heller last week suggested that the low
enrollment problem in Vienna might
have been solved by increased
publicity for the Vienna campus and in
quired whether this tactic had been
tried. Heller said that Overseas Studies
had not increased publicity on the

Vienna program.
The Overseas Studies Office might
have actually discouraged students
from applying to the Vienna campus,
according to Joel Simpson, a senior
who attended both the Vienna and the
Berlin campuses last year.
Simpson said a fellow student inter
ested in studying overseas told him
that an administrator from the Over
seas Studies Office advised him to ap
ply to Berlin.
That student was apparently told that
students who had attended both
campuses generally preferred Berlin
and that Vienna was "more in the past,"
Simpson said.
According to senior Miki Akimoto,
the Berlin program is promoted "way
out of context" because of emphasis
placed on engineering internships of
fered through the program.
Heller said that conversations with
faculty members and Austrian scholars
led to a desire to restructure the
Vienna curriculum.
"On paper, the Vienna curriculum
looks very good, but we got the
message that (the directors of the
Vienna campus) were not coming up
with the things we wanted," Padgett
said.
According to McDonnell, students

might have provided a good communi
cation link between Overseas Studies
and the Vienna administration — had
they been made aware of the review
process going on at the time.
"Sometimes 1 think there are a lot of
big egos in Overseas Studies who don't
really want to learn how a country
operates, but just want to go in and
impose their own way of doing
things," McDonnell said.
Heller said he decided "new blood"
was needed in the Vienna administra
tion since "I wanted internships and I
wanted other things, and nothing came
of it."
But, conversations with government
officials and Austrian scholars left Hel
ler with the impression that Austria is
currently politically paralyzed and that
"bright, young Austrian scholars just
aren't interested in helping a strug
gling American program."
A push toward internships
What will remain for students inter
ested in Austria is still unclear. Heller
hopes to create internships available to
students who first study for one quar
ter in Berlin, but the internships are
not yet in place.
Most students criticized the decision

to shut down the Vienna program
before the internships were estab
lished.
"(Heller) himself said the country is
paralyzed, so in a year, when they can't
get the internships, they can just let the
idea die quietly," Castro said.
Bosch, who attended the Vienna
program winter quarter of last year
and then stopped out to work in
Austria during the spring, said he
doubts Overseas Studies will be able to
arrange internships in Austria.
The Austrian requirements for legal
working papers "are much more strin
gent," than those in Germany, Bosch
said. "They have small sales offices
with a staff of 10 front people," he said.
"They just don't have the facilities they
have in Germany."
"I think it's a poor substitute to say
that you have to go to Berlin for one
quarter and then can go to Vienna,"
senior Karyl Fox said. Fox attended
both the Berlin and Vienna campuses
last year and said Overseas Studies "is
doing a really bad job trying to com
pare the two."
Vienna's cultural value debated
Above all, students criticize com
ments made by German Studies Prof.

Russell Berman and Heller that Berlin
is "culturally more desirable" than
Vienna.
"Vienna flourished and it was very
important up until 1918," Heller said.
"But that's over. Berlin has a very con
temporary, avant-garde culture."
"Then you're basically saying that
history has no value," Simpson said.
Students who met with Heller and
Padgett last week questioned the am
bition of the Overseas Studies
Program in its desire to restructure the
Vienna program. Many felt that only
those students arriving in Europe with
extremely advanced language skills
would be able to benefit from the ac
cessibility to research institutes and
foreign scholars that Overseas Studies
stresses.
Overseas Studies is looking mofe
toward centers in "new," "dynamic"
cities where more industry will allow
more opportunities for internships,
Bosch said.
"Heller wants to fundamentally and
basically change the direction of Over
seas Studies," Bosch said. "He's trying
to create the power brokers of the
future in international affairs."
Students will need to decide if that's
a direction they support.
The decision to close the overseas campus in
Vienna has left many who attended the campus
critical of the reasons given for the closure and
angry that student opinions were not more
widely consulted.
But beyond the emotions that came to the
surface at news of the Vienna shutdown, it is now
up to students to decide whether the decision to
close the Vienna program represents a shift in the
goals of Stanford's Overseas Studies Program. If
the move does signify such a shift, both students
and administrators must consider whether the
current review process allows for sufficient stu
dent input.

News Analysis

Judging by student reaction, the Vienna deci
sion managed to spark significant dissatisfaction
with the process used to evaluate overseas pro
grams.
"I feel it was really underhanded," senior Cathy
McDonnell said. Students "were shut out, we
weren't really consulted, and by the time we
found out about it, it was a fait accompli."
"We weren't even aware that they were consid
ering closing the Vienna campus," senior Lisa
Goebbel said. "Nobody asked our opinion about

the classes, the housing or the administrators."
"They should have some open discussion
before they consider closing an overseas
campus," senior Hans Steinhoffer said. "Our atti
tude is just as important as their evaluation of the
program. We're the ones who take the classes and
participate in the program."
"1 feel like this was done totally behind our
backs," junior Paul Dembiczak said. "The first I
heard about it was the story in The Daily."
Nancy Padgett, deputy director of Overseas
Studies, said she visited the Vienna campus twice
last year. For her first visit, Padgett traveled to
Vienna during spring vacation and spoke with
one student. Padgett made her second visit to
Vienna near the end of spring quarter. Those who
were present say Padgett asked for questions
from students, but did not inform them that the
Vienna campus was being reviewed and might be
shut down.
"She never said the program was being
reviewed," junior Gary Castro said. "She should

Dean of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee told a Daily reporter last week that the
only time Vienna was "even close" to full enroll
ment was when the Stanford Chorale was based
there last winter.
But those who were in Vienna last winter have
had trouble understanding the Overseas Studies
Office's definition.of "full enrollment."
When the Stanford Chorale brought approxi
mately 30 people to Vienna last year, sufficient
dormitory space did not exist to house all stu
dents. Students at the Vienna campus who were
not in the Chorale were placed in dormitories
throughout Vienna (as they regularly are) while
Chorale members lived together in a hotel,
rented for their use.
"I don't think they can expect the campus to do
what they never set it up to do," said senior Joel
Bosch, a former member of the Chorale.
Padgett and other Overseas Studies
administrators now say that "full en
rollment " does not refer to the
capacity of a campus but rather to the
"ideal enrollment aim" of 40-50
people that the office would like at
each of the overseas campuses. Padgett
also notes that both Berlin and Vienna
have fallen short of this target.
Some students feel it would have
been possible to save the Vienna pro
gram had they known about the review
process. Would increased enrollment
in the Vienna program have foiled the
plans of Overseas Studies to chanel
funds into a stronger, culturally "more
desirable" program in Berlin?
Publicity might have helped
Students meeting with Padgett and
Heller last week suggested that the low
enrollment problem in Vienna might
have been solved by increased
publicity for the Vienna campus and in
quired whether this tactic had been
tried. Heller said that Overseas Studies
had not increased publicity on the

Vienna program.
The Overseas Studies Office might
have actually discouraged students
from applying to the Vienna campus,
according to Joel Simpson, a senior
who attended both the Vienna and the
Berlin campuses last year.
Simpson said a fellow student inter
ested in studying overseas told him
that an administrator from the Over
seas Studies Office advised him to ap
ply to Berlin.
That student was apparently told that
students who had attended both
campuses generally preferred Berlin
and that Vienna was "more in the past,"
Simpson said.
According to senior Miki Akimoto,
the Berlin program is promoted "way
out of context" because of emphasis
placed on engineering internships of
fered through the program.
Heller said that conversations with
faculty members and Austrian scholars
led to a desire to restructure the
Vienna curriculum.
"On paper, the Vienna curriculum
looks very good, but we got the
message that (the directors of the
Vienna campus) were not coming up
with the things we wanted," Padgett
said.
According to McDonnell, students

might have provided a good communi
cation link between Overseas Studies
and the Vienna administration — had
they been made aware of the review
process going on at the time.
"Sometimes 1 think there are a lot of
big egos in Overseas Studies who don't
really want to learn how a country
operates, but just want to go in and
impose their own way of doing
things," McDonnell said.
Heller said he decided "new blood"
was needed in the Vienna administra
tion since "I wanted internships and I
wanted other things, and nothing came
of it."
But, conversations with government
officials and Austrian scholars left Hel
ler with the impression that Austria is
currently politically paralyzed and that
"bright, young Austrian scholars just
aren't interested in helping a strug
gling American program."
A push toward internships
What will remain for students inter
ested in Austria is still unclear. Heller
hopes to create internships available to
students who first study for one quar
ter in Berlin, but the internships are
not yet in place.
Most students criticized the decision

to shut down the Vienna program
before the internships were estab
lished.
"(Heller) himself said the country is
paralyzed, so in a year, when they can't
get the internships, they can just let the
idea die quietly," Castro said.
Bosch, who attended the Vienna
program winter quarter of last year
and then stopped out to work in
Austria during the spring, said he
doubts Overseas Studies will be able to
arrange internships in Austria.
The Austrian requirements for legal
working papers "are much more strin
gent," than those in Germany, Bosch
said. "They have small sales offices
with a staff of 10 front people," he said.
"They just don't have the facilities they
have in Germany."
"I think it's a poor substitute to say
that you have to go to Berlin for one
quarter and then can go to Vienna,"
senior Karyl Fox said. Fox attended
both the Berlin and Vienna campuses
last year and said Overseas Studies "is
doing a really bad job trying to com
pare the two."
Vienna's cultural value debated
Above all, students criticize com
ments made by German Studies Prof.

Russell Berman and Heller that Berlin
is "culturally more desirable" than
Vienna.
"Vienna flourished and it was very
important up until 1918," Heller said.
"But that's over. Berlin has a very con
temporary, avant-garde culture."
"Then you're basically saying that
history has no value," Simpson said.
Students who met with Heller and
Padgett last week questioned the am
bition of the Overseas Studies
Program in its desire to restructure the
Vienna program. Many felt that only
those students arriving in Europe with
extremely advanced language skills
would be able to benefit from the ac
cessibility to research institutes and
foreign scholars that Overseas Studies
stresses.
Overseas Studies is looking mofe
toward centers in "new," "dynamic"
cities where more industry will allow
more opportunities for internships,
Bosch said.
"Heller wants to fundamentally and
basically change the direction of Over
seas Studies," Bosch said. "He's trying
to create the power brokers of the
future in international affairs."
Students will need to decide if that's
a direction they support.
The decision to close the overseas campus in
Vienna has left many who attended the campus
critical of the reasons given for the closure and
angry that student opinions were not more
widely consulted.
But beyond the emotions that came to the
surface at news of the Vienna shutdown, it is now
up to students to decide whether the decision to
close the Vienna program represents a shift in the
goals of Stanford's Overseas Studies Program. If
the move does signify such a shift, both students
and administrators must consider whether the
current review process allows for sufficient stu
dent input.

News Analysis

Judging by student reaction, the Vienna deci
sion managed to spark significant dissatisfaction
with the process used to evaluate overseas pro
grams.
"I feel it was really underhanded," senior Cathy
McDonnell said. Students "were shut out, we
weren't really consulted, and by the time we
found out about it, it was a fait accompli."
"We weren't even aware that they were consid
ering closing the Vienna campus," senior Lisa
Goebbel said. "Nobody asked our opinion about

the classes, the housing or the administrators."
"They should have some open discussion
before they consider closing an overseas
campus," senior Hans Steinhoffer said. "Our atti
tude is just as important as their evaluation of the
program. We're the ones who take the classes and
participate in the program."
"1 feel like this was done totally behind our
backs," junior Paul Dembiczak said. "The first I
heard about it was the story in The Daily."
Nancy Padgett, deputy director of Overseas
Studies, said she visited the Vienna campus twice
last year. For her first visit, Padgett traveled to
Vienna during spring vacation and spoke with
one student. Padgett made her second visit to
Vienna near the end of spring quarter. Those who
were present say Padgett asked for questions
from students, but did not inform them that the
Vienna campus was being reviewed and might be
shut down.
"She never said the program was being
reviewed," junior Gary Castro said. "She should
have said 'Our committee thinks these changes
should be made How do you who are en
rolled here feel about it?' "
According to Thomas Heller, director of the
Overseas Studies Program, a panel established to
look at the Stanford campuses in Central Europe
spent last year talking to Vienna program admi
nistrators, Vienna faculty and faculty members
here whose interests are tied to Austria.
"They obviously didn't talk to the students

there," senior Bronia Whipp said. "Because as far
as we're concerned, the experience is great."
That panel issued a recommendation to cut the
Vienna program.
Seven faculty members and one student sat on
the panel. According to Heller, the student repre
sentative had formerly participated in the Univer
sity's Vienna program. Though no vote was taken,
the recommendation was unanimous, according
to Heller, because the committee operates on a
consensus model.
On receipt of the panel's recommendation, the
Overseas Studies Program Committee voted 7-2
in favor of closing the campus. The two student
members on the committee both voted against
the recommendation.
With three students directly involved in the
decision to close the Vienna campus and two of
them voting against that decision, it is natural to
ask whether Overseas Studies based their assess
ment of student opinion on the statements of one
student representative.
"Where do they get off using one student's
opinion as representative of all students?" Stein
hoffer asked. "You have to talk to a number of stu
dents before you can build a consensus."
Students: reasons for closure unclear
Had students been more aware of Overseas
Studies' concerns about the Vienna program, they
say they might also be able to better understand

the reasons for its closure.
Padgett told students meeting with her last
Wednesday that interest in the Berlin campus has
gone "way up" while interest in Vienna has
declined dramatically in recent years. Though in
terest in the Vienna program has fallen since the
inception of the Berlin program, Padgett said the
number of students enrolled in Berlin who are
not involved in Berlin's internship program is
"about the same" as the number of students at the
Vienna campus.

Lougee told a Daily reporter last week that the
only time Vienna was "even close" to full enroll
ment was when the Stanford Chorale was based
