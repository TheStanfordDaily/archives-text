# Students criticize Vienna campus closure
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
The decision to close the overseas campus in
Vienna has left many who attended the campus
critical of the reasons given for the closure and
angry that student opinions were not more
widely consulted.
But beyond the emotions that came to the
surface at news of the Vienna shutdown, it is now
up to students to decide whether the decision to
close the Vienna program represents a shift in the
goals of Stanford's Overseas Studies Program. If
the move does signify such a shift, both students
and administrators must consider whether the
current review process allows for sufficient stu
dent input.

News Analysis

Judging by student reaction, the Vienna deci
sion managed to spark significant dissatisfaction
with the process used to evaluate overseas pro
grams.
"I feel it was really underhanded," senior Cathy
McDonnell said. Students "were shut out, we
weren't really consulted, and by the time we
found out about it, it was a fait accompli."
"We weren't even aware that they were consid
ering closing the Vienna campus," senior Lisa
Goebbel said. "Nobody asked our opinion about

the classes, the housing or the administrators."
"They should have some open discussion
before they consider closing an overseas
campus," senior Hans Steinhoffer said. "Our atti
tude is just as important as their evaluation of the
program. We're the ones who take the classes and
participate in the program."
"1 feel like this was done totally behind our
backs," junior Paul Dembiczak said. "The first I
heard about it was the story in The Daily."
Nancy Padgett, deputy director of Overseas
Studies, said she visited the Vienna campus twice
last year. For her first visit, Padgett traveled to
Vienna during spring vacation and spoke with
one student. Padgett made her second visit to
Vienna near the end of spring quarter. Those who
were present say Padgett asked for questions
from students, but did not inform them that the
Vienna campus was being reviewed and might be
shut down.
"She never said the program was being
reviewed," junior Gary Castro said. "She should
have said 'Our committee thinks these changes
should be made How do you who are en
rolled here feel about it?' "
According to Thomas Heller, director of the
Overseas Studies Program, a panel established to
look at the Stanford campuses in Central Europe
spent last year talking to Vienna program admi
nistrators, Vienna faculty and faculty members
here whose interests are tied to Austria.
"They obviously didn't talk to the students

there," senior Bronia Whipp said. "Because as far
as we're concerned, the experience is great."
That panel issued a recommendation to cut the
Vienna program.
Seven faculty members and one student sat on
the panel. According to Heller, the student repre
sentative had formerly participated in the Univer
sity's Vienna program. Though no vote was taken,
the recommendation was unanimous, according
to Heller, because the committee operates on a
consensus model.
On receipt of the panel's recommendation, the
Overseas Studies Program Committee voted 7-2
in favor of closing the campus. The two student
members on the committee both voted against
the recommendation.
With three students directly involved in the
decision to close the Vienna campus and two of
them voting against that decision, it is natural to
ask whether Overseas Studies based their assess
ment of student opinion on the statements of one
student representative.
"Where do they get off using one student's
opinion as representative of all students?" Stein
hoffer asked. "You have to talk to a number of stu
dents before you can build a consensus."
Students: reasons for closure unclear
Had students been more aware of Overseas
Studies' concerns about the Vienna program, they
say they might also be able to better understand

the reasons for its closure.
Padgett told students meeting with her last
Wednesday that interest in the Berlin campus has
gone "way up" while interest in Vienna has
declined dramatically in recent years. Though in
terest in the Vienna program has fallen since the
inception of the Berlin program, Padgett said the
number of students enrolled in Berlin who are
not involved in Berlin's internship program is
"about the same" as the number of students at the
Vienna campus.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee told a Daily reporter last week that the
only time Vienna was "even close" to full enroll
ment was when the Stanford Chorale was based
there last winter.
But those who were in Vienna last winter have
had trouble understanding the Overseas Studies
Office's definition.of "full enrollment."
When the Stanford Chorale brought approxi
mately 30 people to Vienna last year, sufficient
dormitory space did not exist to house all stu
dents. Students at the Vienna campus who were
not in the Chorale were placed in dormitories
throughout Vienna (as they regularly are) while
Chorale members lived together in a hotel,
rented for their use.
"I don't think they can expect the campus to do
what they never set it up to do," said senior Joel
Bosch, a former member of the Chorale.
