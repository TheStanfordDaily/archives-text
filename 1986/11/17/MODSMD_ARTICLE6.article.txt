### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Though Stanford's rally plans are
still in limbo, Cal has announced its
plans for Big Game Week events, in
cluding a "Blue and Gold Day" that
Berkeley organizers hope will be
devoid of red.
Beginning Nov. 17, Cal's Big Game
schedule will feature a kick-off rally at
Berkeley, a "Get the Red Out" blood
drive, a cable car rally in San Francisco,
the "Blue and Gold Day"and the Big
Game Bonfire Rally at Berkeley.
"It's going to cause quite a ruckus al
though it's not quite as big as a 112 1 mil
lion liability," said Tina Hoppe, chair
man of the California Rally Committee.
She was referring to the $1 million in
liability insurance that is necessary for
Stanford's traditional Rally and that
Stanford's Axe Committee has been
Berkeley's kick-off rally today will
lead into tomorrow's bkx>d drive and a
volleyball game between Stanford and
Cal. On Wednesday afternoon, the Cali
fornia Marching Band, yell leaders,
pompon girls, the mascot Oski and
boosters will go to San Francisco and

"generate Cal Spirit throughout the
city by singing and playing and per
forming," according to a press release
from the California Rally Committee.
The release described Thursday, also
known in Berkeley as "no red day," as
"the symbol of our intense rivalry with
Stanfurd (sic)."
The hectic schedule will peak Friday
night at the Big Game Bonfire Rally at
Berkeley's Greek Theater. Highlights
include celebrity guests with the his
tory of the Axe, the Cal Band, yell
leaders, pompon girls and, of course,
Oski.
"We're being optimistic â€” blind
idealism is what you'd call it. It's like
1982 when we were 20 points behind
and you remember we won that," said
Hoppe.
Mike Tuchin, president of the Stan
ford Axe Committee, responded to
news of Cal's plans with a roster of
Stanford's activities.
Monday is the Bearial Procession
which starts in White Plaza, Tuesday is
Red and White day, Wednesday is the
Sing-off at Berkeley, Thursday is
Gaieties and the Bonfire in Lake
Lagunita and Friday is the rally at Ac
quatic Park."
