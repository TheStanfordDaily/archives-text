### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It's unofficially official: The Stanford
Cardinal will play in the Gator Bowl on
Dec. 27 against Atlantic Coast Confer
ence champion Clemson.
According to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, the Gator Bowl intends to offer
the Cardinal a bid Saturday, and Stan
ford intends to accept the offer.
According to NCAA rules, bids can
not be officially extended until Satur
day at 4 p.m.
The Gator Bowl, played in Jackson
ville, Fla., the Saturday following
Christmas, is possibly the top bowl not
played on New Year's Day. The game
had been vying for the national cham
pionship game between No. 1 Miami
(Fla.) and soon-to-be No. 2 Penn State,
a contest that will be played in the
Fiesta Bowl.
To land that matchup, the Fiesta
Bowl upped its guarantee to around
$2.4 million per team and moved its
game to Jan. 2 at 9 p.m. EST to avoid
time conflicts with the Cotton and
Citrus Bowls.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway was un
available for comment last night, but a
press conference is scheduled for
11:30 a.m. today.
The Gator Bowl guarantees $800,000
to each participating team. Kickoff is
1:30 p.m. EST (10:30 a.m. PST). Stan
ford has never pldyed in the Gator
Bowl or in the state of Florida.
The Cardinal is 7-2 overall this
season, 4-2 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, and tied with Arizona for third
place, a half-game behind second
place USC. Arizona State clinched the
championship and Rose Bowl berth
last week.
The Cardinal, ranked No. 16 last
week by The Associated Press, has
games remaining with California on
Saturday and Arizona on Nov. 29 in
Tokyo. The Cardinal will finish second
should it win its final two games and
should UCLA beat or tie USC on Satur
day.
Clemson is 7-2-1 overall after a 17-17
tie against Maryland on Saturday. The
Tigers were ranked No. 15 in last
week's AP poll.
A total of six Pac-10 teams will be
playing in bowl games this year, the
largest number from any one confer
ence. Arizona State will play the win
ner of the Ohio State-Michigan game in
the Rose Bowl Jan. 1; USC will play
Auburn in the Citrus Bowl Jan. 1; Wash
ington will play Alabama in the Sun
Bowl Dec. 25; Arizona will play either
Georgia or Hawaii in the Aloha Bowl
Dec. 27; and UCLA will play an un
