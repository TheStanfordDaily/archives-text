Education is the key to helping
Latinos and Chicanos, stressed politi
cal and community leaders during
Saturday's statewide MEChA
(Chicano Student Alliance of the
Southwest) Conference at Stanford.
The attack on affirmative action,
the establishment of English as the
official language of California and the
treatment of Hispanic farm and fac
tory workers are among the prob
lems that can be mitigated through
better education, they said.
More than 700 students from high
schools and colleges all over Califor
nia attended the conference â€” the
first to be held at Stanford, making it
the largest statewide conference in
the history of MEChA.
"Education: Fight to learn, learn to
fight was the conference's theme.
Acccording to Velina Underwood, co
coordinator with Gina Hernandez,
Stanford organizers chose the theme
of education "because of its univer
sality. Each of us is intimately con

cerned ... with education."
Hernandez gave the welcome ad
dress, emphasizing the issues that
were to be discussed at the confer
ence: immigration, Proposition 63,
labor rights, the attack on affirmative
action, cutbacks in Latino Education
classes and others.
Asserting that "Chicanos are not
much better off than we were 30
years ago," Hernandez linked prog
ress in these issues to improvements
in Chicano education.
The struggle for educational
rights is part of our struggle as a
people for self-determination," she
said.

rural towns and have been suspected
of causing birth defects. But Governor
George Deukmejian recently vetoed a
bill that would call for the testing of
water in one such town, according to
the film.
Toney Anaya, governor of New
Mexico, talked about the problems
facing Hispanics and the need to get
politically involved.
"Unfortunately, poverty' is growing
at a time when we're being told by
Washington, D.C., that everything is
great."
"The real future, whatever strides
we make, lies with you," he said.
"Once you attain whatever plateau you
reach, use it to help others."
Susana Navarro, assistant director of
the Achievement Council, talked about
educational problems facing the
Chicano Community. According to
Navarro, not much progress in
achievement scores has been made by
Chicanos over the past 15 years, and
schools with large Chicano popula
tions are overcrowded and do not have
enough resources.
