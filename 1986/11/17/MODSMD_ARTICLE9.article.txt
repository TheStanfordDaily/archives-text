N. Korean leader reported dead
SEOUL, South Korea — The Defense Ministry, in an broadcast today on
state-run radio, said North Korean loudspeakers along the demilitarized
zone were saying North Korean President Kim II Sung had been killed in a
shooting.
The same broadcast said there was no confirmation of the report from
North Korean radio broadcasts or sources here in the capital of South
Korea.
In Tokyo, Radio Press, a Japanese news agency that monitors communist
bloc broadcasts, said North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang did not say
anything about Kim or a shooting in its hourly newscast at 11 a.m. today (6
p.m. PST yesterday). Radio Press said the hourly news program was cover
ing standard material such as farmer's experiences and the need for self
sufficiency.
There was no explanation why communist North Korea would disclose
the information through the loudspeakers along the demilitarized zone
that divides the peninsula. They normally are used for propaganda broad
casts beamed to the south.
Lee Heung shik, spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said
in a brief announcement, "North Korean propaganda loudspeakers at the
front line said on Sunday Kim 11 Sung had been shot and killed."
Lee said the South Korean military was on its usual alert, but gave no
other details immediately.
Police officials announced that the entire national police force had been
placed on full alert "in connection with the recent situation in North Korea
and to block possible subversive attempts by impure elements."
The term impure elements normally is used by authorities here to
describe communists, pro-communists or their supporters.
Rumors had circulated in Seoul yesterday that something had occurred
in North Korea, possibly involving the death of the North Korean leader.
They were said to have originated with South Korean reporters based in
Tokyo.
U.S. Military authorities in South Korea said this morning they could not
comment in any way on the situation.
Bomb explodes at German IBM
HEIDELBERG, West Germany — A bomb explosion heavily damaged an
International Business Machines Corp. research center yesterday, but
caused no casualties, police said.
Leftist terrorists claimed responsibility.
The bomb erupted at about 4 a.m. and damaged the facade of the four
story building and equipment inside, officials said. West German televison
said the homemade device was placed on a second-floor balcony.
Police said it would take days to estimate the damage.
Shortly before the blast, anonymous callers told two Heidelberg pastors
to warn the night watchman to leave the building, said Hans-Juergen
Foerster, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office.
Both pastors immediately contacted police, who informed the
watchman, Foerster said.
He said by the time police arrived at the U.S. company's research facility
in an industrial section of Heidelberg, the bomb had gone off. He said
police saw a car speeding away.
In a letter found nearby, a group calling itself the Hind Alameh Fighting
Cell claimed responsibility for the attack, Foerster said.
Hind Alameh, a member of the Red Army Faction terrorist group, was
killed in a 1977 airliner hijacking.
The letter demanded that imprisoned RAF member Guenter Sonnen
berg be freed and called pq f authorities to allow all jailed RAF members to
be housed in the S3jne area- „ ,
Demonstrators denounce Enrile
MANILA, Philippines — Thousands of demonstrators marched through
downtown Manila yesterday denouncing Defense Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile, and a labor official told them guns may be needed to protect
democracy.
Nick Elman, an official of the leftist May Ist Movement labor union, also
said the 500,000-member union would strike nationwide Thursday to
coincide with the funeral of its slain leader, Rolando Olalia, a supporter of
President Corazon Aquino.
The union, the Philippines' largest, has also called for a general strike for
today in Manila.
At a rally of about 15,000 people in downtown Manila yesterday, Aquino
said: "I want to be known as a leader of peace, but if there is no other
choice, I am ready to lead a war."
Before his death, Olalia warned that his union would launch a general
strike if the military attempted a coup. Rumors have been widespread that
officers linked to Enrile planned to overthrow Aquino's government be
cause of her peace overtures to communist rebels.
Assad denies Syrian terrorism
DAMASCUS, Syria — President Hafez Assad denied that Syria was in
volved in terrorism and accused President Reagan and Britain's Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher yesterday of being the "real terrorists" and trying to
bully Syria.
"We are against terrorism, we don't practice it and do not allow anyone
to hatch terrorist plots from our territory," Assad told about 7,000 people at
a Damascus stadium on the 16th anniversary of the coup that brought him
to power.
Assad said, however, that Syria backed "resistance against occupation
and all national liberation movements."
Britain cut ties with Syria last month after a Jordanian, Nezar Hindawi,
was convicted of working with Syrian diplomats in trying to plant a bomb
on an Israeli airliner in London.
The United States announced Friday it would impose diplomatic and
economic measures against the Damascus government, citing Syria's al
leged support for terrorist groups.
Assad accused Israeli intelligence officials of planning the bombing and
said he wished to express Syria's "astonishment" at Western measures
against his country.
He said his nation would be able to cope with the various measures
imposed by Britain, the United States and the European Common Market.
The United States tightened trade controls and banned commercial
flights between Syria and America. The Common Market, with the excep
tion of Greece, banned the sale of new arms to Syria, suspended high-level
official visits and agreed to review the activities of their diplomats in Syria.
Lenience for white-collar crime
WASHINGTON — More than 80 percent of convicted white-collar
criminals are sentenced by judges to little or no time behind bars, the
federal government reported yesterday.
In a study of forgery, counterfeiting, fraud and embezzlement in eight
states containing more than a third of the nation's population, the govern
ment found that 60 percent of the people convicted of white-collar crimes
were sentenced to prison terms.
However, only 18 percent of those convicted were sent to prison for
more than 12 months, said the report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
More than 40 percent of those convicted were given sentences of less
than one year, and the study did not measure the amount of time the
prisoners actually served Actual prison time generally is shorter than the
sentence imposed because of factors such as sentence reduction due to
good behavior.
In contrast, violent offenders received prison terms of more than a year
39 percent of the time, the study found Property crime offenders received
prison terms of longer than 12 months in 26 percent of the cases.
Forty percent of convicted white-collar criminals were given probation
or other non-prison penalties, the survey concluded.
Criminals committing property crimes such as burglary or car theft were
given probation or other non-prison penalties in 35 percent of the cases.

against his country.
He said his nation would be able to cope with the various measures
imposed by Britain, the United States and the European Common Market.
The United States tightened trade controls and banned commercial
flights between Syria and America. The Common Market, with the excep

Lenience for white-collar crime
WASHINGTON — More than 80 percent of convicted white-collar
criminals are sentenced by judges to little or no time behind bars, the
federal government reported yesterday.
In a study of forgery, counterfeiting, fraud and embezzlement in eight
states containing more than a third of the nation's population, the govern
ment found that 60 percent of the people convicted of white-collar crimes
were sentenced to prison terms.
However, only 18 percent of those convicted were sent to prison for
more than 12 months, said the report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
More than 40 percent of those convicted were given sentences of less
than one year, and the study did not measure the amount of time the
prisoners actually served Actual prison time generally is shorter than the
sentence imposed because of factors such as sentence reduction due to
good behavior.
In contrast, violent offenders received prison terms of more than a year
39 percent of the time, the study found Property crime offenders received
prison terms of longer than 12 months in 26 percent of the cases.
Forty percent of convicted white-collar criminals were given probation
or other non-prison penalties, the survey concluded.
Criminals committing property crimes such as burglary or car theft were
given probation or other non-prison penalties in 35 percent of the cases.

N. Korean leader reported dead
SEOUL, South Korea — The Defense Ministry, in an broadcast today on
state-run radio, said North Korean loudspeakers along the demilitarized
zone were saying North Korean President Kim II Sung had been killed in a
shooting.
The same broadcast said there was no confirmation of the report from
North Korean radio broadcasts or sources here in the capital of South
Korea.
In Tokyo, Radio Press, a Japanese news agency that monitors communist
bloc broadcasts, said North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang did not say
anything about Kim or a shooting in its hourly newscast at 11 a.m. today (6
p.m. PST yesterday). Radio Press said the hourly news program was cover
ing standard material such as farmer's experiences and the need for self
sufficiency.
There was no explanation why communist North Korea would disclose
the information through the loudspeakers along the demilitarized zone
that divides the peninsula. They normally are used for propaganda broad
casts beamed to the south.
Lee Heung shik, spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said
in a brief announcement, "North Korean propaganda loudspeakers at the
front line said on Sunday Kim 11 Sung had been shot and killed."
Lee said the South Korean military was on its usual alert, but gave no
other details immediately.
Police officials announced that the entire national police force had been
placed on full alert "in connection with the recent situation in North Korea
and to block possible subversive attempts by impure elements."
The term impure elements normally is used by authorities here to
describe communists, pro-communists or their supporters.
Rumors had circulated in Seoul yesterday that something had occurred
in North Korea, possibly involving the death of the North Korean leader.
They were said to have originated with South Korean reporters based in
Tokyo.
U.S. Military authorities in South Korea said this morning they could not
comment in any way on the situation.
Bomb explodes at German IBM
HEIDELBERG, West Germany — A bomb explosion heavily damaged an
International Business Machines Corp. research center yesterday, but
caused no casualties, police said.
Leftist terrorists claimed responsibility.
The bomb erupted at about 4 a.m. and damaged the facade of the four
story building and equipment inside, officials said. West German televison
said the homemade device was placed on a second-floor balcony.
Police said it would take days to estimate the damage.
Shortly before the blast, anonymous callers told two Heidelberg pastors
to warn the night watchman to leave the building, said Hans-Juergen
Foerster, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office.
Both pastors immediately contacted police, who informed the
watchman, Foerster said.
He said by the time police arrived at the U.S. company's research facility
in an industrial section of Heidelberg, the bomb had gone off. He said
police saw a car speeding away.
In a letter found nearby, a group calling itself the Hind Alameh Fighting
Cell claimed responsibility for the attack, Foerster said.
Hind Alameh, a member of the Red Army Faction terrorist group, was
killed in a 1977 airliner hijacking.
The letter demanded that imprisoned RAF member Guenter Sonnen
berg be freed and called pq f authorities to allow all jailed RAF members to
be housed in the S3jne area- „ ,
Demonstrators denounce Enrile
MANILA, Philippines — Thousands of demonstrators marched through
downtown Manila yesterday denouncing Defense Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile, and a labor official told them guns may be needed to protect
democracy.
Nick Elman, an official of the leftist May Ist Movement labor union, also
said the 500,000-member union would strike nationwide Thursday to
coincide with the funeral of its slain leader, Rolando Olalia, a supporter of
President Corazon Aquino.
The union, the Philippines' largest, has also called for a general strike for
today in Manila.
At a rally of about 15,000 people in downtown Manila yesterday, Aquino
said: "I want to be known as a leader of peace, but if there is no other
choice, I am ready to lead a war."
Before his death, Olalia warned that his union would launch a general
strike if the military attempted a coup. Rumors have been widespread that
officers linked to Enrile planned to overthrow Aquino's government be
cause of her peace overtures to communist rebels.
Assad denies Syrian terrorism
DAMASCUS, Syria — President Hafez Assad denied that Syria was in
volved in terrorism and accused President Reagan and Britain's Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher yesterday of being the "real terrorists" and trying to
bully Syria.
"We are against terrorism, we don't practice it and do not allow anyone
to hatch terrorist plots from our territory," Assad told about 7,000 people at
a Damascus stadium on the 16th anniversary of the coup that brought him
to power.
Assad said, however, that Syria backed "resistance against occupation
and all national liberation movements."
Britain cut ties with Syria last month after a Jordanian, Nezar Hindawi,
was convicted of working with Syrian diplomats in trying to plant a bomb
on an Israeli airliner in London.
The United States announced Friday it would impose diplomatic and
economic measures against the Damascus government, citing Syria's al
leged support for terrorist groups.
