America will not trade Star Wars
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said yesterday
the United States would never trade "Star Wars" or balanced conventional
strength in Europe for a new arms control accord with the Soviet Union.
In an address prepared for delivery to a symposium here on the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, Weinberger said the United States and its
European allies desired deep reductions in offensive ballistic nuclear
missiles.
But regardless of whether such an accord is negotiated, he continued,
the Western alliance must continue improving its conventional strength.
The defense secretary appeared before a symposium on NATO, which
was sponsored by the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis. A text of his
speech was released in advance at the Pentagon.
Weinberger spoke just a few hours after meeting with West German
Defense Minister Manfred Woerner, who is in Washington for consulta
tions with American officials. Woerner told reporters after his meeting with
Weinberger that the Western allies could not match Soviet-bloc conven
tional strength if all nuclear weapons were eliminated.
Syria tied to bombing in Berlin
BERLIN — A man identified as a top Syrian Air Force intelligence officer
supplied the explosives for a terrorist bombing that injured seven persons
here in March, according to statements given by the two defendants last
spring and presented yesterday at the opening of their trial.
The accused terrorists, both of Palestinian origin, confessed in court yes
terday to placing the bomb at the German-Arab Friendship Society.
But the two — Ahmed Nawaf Mansour Hasi, 35, and Farouk Salameh, 39
— gave evasive answers or refused to respond to the court's questions
about their earlier statements alleging Syrian involvement.
Chief Judge Hans-Joachim Heinze, who heads the five-judge panel, read
large sections of the defendants' depositions, made last spring, that impl
icated the Syrian official. The prosecution identified him today as Haithem
Saeed, a lieutenant colonel and the number two official in the Syrian Air
Force intelligence service, under Gen. Mohammed Khouli, its chief.
Hasi, in a loud and emotional outburst yesterday morning, asserted his
innocence and said that his original statements had been made when he
was drugged in prison and subjected to "psychological torture." This after
noon, however, he confessed that he and Salameh had planted the bomb,
but he refused to comment on alleged Syrian involvement.
Salameh said yesterday that he and Hasi had placed the bomb outside
the friendship society's building at about 9 p.m. on March 29.
The two face sentences of up to life imprisonment if convicted on
charges of attempted murder and causing an explosion.
S. African police, strikers clash
PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa — Police used dogs and rubber whips to
disperse strikers outside the General Motors plant yesterday, and the com
pany said those who stay off the job will be fired.
The automaker gave strikers a deadline of 9 a.m. today to return to work.
The walkout began Oct. 29 in this depressed industrial city on the Indian
Ocean, where GM is the largest employer.
Sixteen workers were arrested during the clash with police at the plant
gate and released on bail of 100 rand ($45) each without formal charges,
their union said.
£oJi.ce.said about 300 strikers were intimidating workers who wanted to
' go to thefr~job~s inside the plant.
Employees struck over demands for compensation from the American
parent company after General Motors announced plans to sell its South
African operation to local management.
Although the strike began as a wildcat action, the National Automobile
and Allied Workers Union has endorsed the workers' demands. GM says it
will not discuss the issues until the strike ends.
"W.W. II internees disappointed
SAN FRANCISCO —Japanese-American groups said yesterday they were
disappointed, but not surprised, by the Supreme Court's decision to con
sider a government effort to kill a lawsuit seeking damages for the mass
detention of 120,000 Japanese-Americans during World War 11.
The high court yesterday agreed to examine a federal appeals court
ruling that the government must defend itself at trial against claims seeking
compensation for property losses suffered by the internees. The losses are
estimated in the billions of dollars.
The court took no action on the plaintiffs' appeal of another portion of
the appeals court decision. That portion dismissed claims for monetary da
mages for alleged constitutional violations and claims seeking to make the
government admit it fraudulently declared the internment a "military
necessity."
Renault president shot dead
PARIS — The head of France's largest state-owned car firm, Renault pres
ident Georges Besse, was shot dead outside his home here last night in an
apparent resurgence of domestic terrorism.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the murder of Besse,
58, one of France's best-known industrialists, but speculation immediately
centered on the left-wing terrorist group Direct Action. Several members
of the group are due to stand trial in Paris on terrorist charges in two
weeks.
Eyewitnesses said the assassins, thought to number either two or three,
included at least one woman. The killers approached Besse as he walked
toward his home in the Montparnasse section of Paris, shot him in the head
and chest from close range and then fled.
The shooting occurred at 8:25 p.m. after the Renault chief had been
driven home from work by his chauffeur and dropped off some 50 yards
from his house. Members of Besse's family heard the shots and immedi
ately ran out of the house, but he was dead by the time they reached him,
police said.
Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and other senior government and police
officials rushed to the scene.
Direct Action is believed to have been behind five bomb attacks, which
caused no injuries, against French companies earlier this month. In early
July, the group said it was responsible for a bomb that went off at Paris
police headquarters, killing a senior police official.
Besse, long regarded as one of France's outstanding senior civil servants,
was appointed head of Renault in January 1985 at a time when the company
was in deep financial trouble. He reduced its losses, but provoked protests
from the trade unions with a recover)' plan that entailed the losses of
21,000 jobs, or roughly 25 percent of the labor force.

ket St., occurred at 2:55 p.m., fire officials said. Floors 26-38 were evacuated

Tobacco and Firearms.
