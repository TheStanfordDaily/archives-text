# Reagan sees no future Iran deals
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said yesterday
that he has "absolutely no plans to send more arms
to Iran, although his spokesman said the president's
authorization for the weapons shipments technically
remains in effect.
As he posed for pictures at the start of a meeting
with Argentine President Raul Alfonsin, Reagan was
asked if there would be more U.S. arms shipments to
Iran like those he confirmed last week after
numerous published reports of secret U.S.-Iranian
dealings.
"We have absolutely no plans to do any such
thing," Reagan told reporters. Nor, he said, would he
be firing Secretary of State George Shultz or any
other top foreign policy advisers as a result of public
controversy over the covert operation.
Presidential spokesman Larry Speakes, meanwhile,
said Reagan had told him there would be no further
arms shipments but that the "intelligence finding," a
Jan. 17 document authorizing the weapons and spare
parts sales, is technically "still in effect" because it
carried no time limit and has not been rescinded.
The spokesman also said the Iranians paid cash for
the military supplies they received under Reagan's
order, although neither the amount nor the precise
weaponry supplied has been disclosed.
The Iranians long have been seeking a variety of

weapons and spare parts for their U.S.-made planes
and equipment ordered and paid for during the
reign of the Shah of Iran, but whose delivery was
blocked when the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized
and Americans were taken hostage.
Speakes said that despite the halt in further arms
shipments, which Reagan has said were intended to
establish credibility with Iranians the United States
was trying to court, verbal efforts to improve rela
tions with moderate Iranian leaders may continue.
"Certainly we would like to continue our original
goal, and that was to develop contacts with Iran so
that we could deal with that country in the future,'
Speakes said. "We would be hopeful that we could,
on some basis, continue our contacts in order to
develop that and to work for a peaceful resolution to
the Iran-Iraq war."
Asked about a suggestion by Iran's ambassador to
the United Nations, Said Rajaie Khorassani, that the
United States must supply weapons to Iran if it wants
Iran to help win the release of Americans still held
hostage in Lebanon, Speakes said: "We will not trade
arms for hostages."
Khorassani, in an interview with IRNA, the official
Iranian news agency, said Reagan had negotiated
with Iran for release of hostages because of Tehran's
"power and influence" over kidnap groups.

"The justification was that if the matter was to be
solved through an influential mediator, Iran was the
right choice, and, therefore, some of their demands,
including the supply of defensive arms to Iran, must
be met," IRNA quoted him as saying.
Reagan has insisted that although the United States
sought Iranians' help in freeing the hostages as a
measure of their willingness to deal with the United
States, there was never a ransom paid for the three
hostages who were released during the period the
secret diplomacy and arms shipments were taking
place.
On Sunday, Shultz said he would oppose sending
more arm's to Iran but that he spoke only for himself
and not for the Reagan administration in that regard.
His statement was widely interpreted as an indication
he and the president were at odds over Iran policy,
particularly the secret weapons shipments during a
public arms embargo.
"The president does want Secretary Shultz to
remain on the job," Speakes said yesterday in answer
to questions about whether the secretary might
resign.
And when Reagan was asked if he planned to fire
Shultz, he replied, "I'm not firing anybody."
