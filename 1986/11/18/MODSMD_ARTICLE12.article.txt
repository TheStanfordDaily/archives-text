PEKING â€” North Korean leader
Kim 11 Sung appeared in public at the
Pyongyang airport this morning to
welcome a foreign visitor, thus dispell
ing earlier reports from South Korea
that he had been assassinated.
The New China News Agency,
China's official wire service, reported
in a dispatch from Pyongyang that Kim,
74, had personally greeted Mongolian
head of state Jambyn Batmonh upon
the visitor's arrival in North Korea.
The Chinese account was subse
quently corroborated by Western
European diplomats in Pyongyang.
Shortly before 11 a.m. today Peking
time, Wolfgang Entmayer, the commer
cial counselor at the Austrian Embassy
in Pyongyang, telephoned his country's
embassy in Peking to say that he had
personally seen Kim at the airport
ceremonies.
"He (Entmayer) said he had seen
Kim and that Kim was in the best of
health and spirits," Wolfgang Wolte,
the Austrian ambassador to China and
North Korea, told the Los Angeles
Times.

North Korea's Central News Agency,
monitored in Tokyo, also reported that
Kim met Batmonh at the airport and
said that 100,000 people lined the
streets in Pyongyang to greet the Mon
golian leader.
The official Soviet news agency Tass
reported without comment that Kim
and "other party and state figures of
the DPRK (North Korea)" were at the
airport to greet Batmonh.
Japan's Foreign Ministry said that it
still had not been able to confirm inde
pendently that Kim had met the Mon
golian leader personally. But officials
said that they considered the report by
the New China News Agency to be
"highly reliable."
Japanese diplomats privately said
that they were not ruling out the possi
bility that some kind of political trou
ble had occurred in North Korea. They
also said that they would seek more in
formation from Seoul about its reports
of Kim's death.
Other diplomats in Peking said that
it remains possible that some major
power struggle has been taking place

in North Korea and that this would ac
count for the erroneous South Korean
reports of Kim's death.
"There may be some major disrup
tion, and we don't know what it is yet,"
said one Western analyst. He
compared the recent events in North
Korea to the turmoil in China in 1971
at the time of the death of Defense
Minister Lin Biao.
At that time, for more than three
weeks foreign governments knew only
that there had been a major internal
struggle in China, but not what it en
tailed. "We didn't even know if Mao
Tse-tung was alive until he came out to
meet (Ethiopian leader) Haile
Selassie," the analyst recalled.
Eventually, China reported that Lin
had died in a plane crash, allegedly
while attempting to escape to the So
viet Union.
Last month, North Korean Defense
Minister O Chin U was reported to
have been seriously injured in a traffic
accident. Since then, the defense mini
ster has not been seen in public and
has not been receiving visitors.

The reports of Kim's death spread
rapidly Sunday and early yesterday.
The South Korean Defense Ministry
said its troops had heard loudspeakers
along the North Korean side of the
demilitarized zone (DMZ) broadcast
ing the news that Kim had been shot
and killed.
South Korean Defense Minister Lee
Ki Baek told the National Assembly yes
terday that "judging from all such cir
cumstances, it is believed that Kim has
died or a serious internal power
struggle is going on there."
Early this morning, the South
Korean Defense Ministry said it had
heard a new report from the North
Korean loudspeakers. According to the
South Korean officials, the
loudspeakers were broadcasting the
news early today that Defense Minister
O Chin U had seized power.
The DMZ extends for 151 miles
across the Korean peninsula. South
Korean officials said they had heard
the broadcasts at six separate advanced
posts along the zone.
