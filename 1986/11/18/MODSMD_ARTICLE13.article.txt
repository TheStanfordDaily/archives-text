## A
						Judicial Debate 
### 
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole's recent statements question
ing whether the University should
maintain confidentiality in all judi
cial cases have raised several ethical
and legal issues.
In a report released Friday, Cole
asked whether Stanford administra
tors should continue to honor con
fidentiality in cases of incidents that
begin in the public domain. "In
such cases," she wrote, "the behav
ioral facts — what the student actu
ally did — are already known
through police records and media
reports. Given this fundamental, in
itial characteristic, what purpose is
served by keeping a tight lid on the
University's response to the behav
ior in question?"
Current judicial policy prohibits
the University from releasing
names of offenders or specifics of
cases, even after a verdict is ren
dered and a sentence handed
down.
Cole's statements raise the issues
of whether Stanford has an obliga
tion to protect students by treating
all judicial cases as confidential,
whether the University is bound by
its own legislative and judicial
charter to maintain confidentiality
and whether the University is re
quired by law to do so.
The chair of the University's
Committee of Fifteen, Communica
tion Prof. Henry Breitrose, said yes
terday that a few members of C-15
with legal expertise would meet
soon to discuss whether Stanford's
judicial charter or any external law
proscribes the disclosure of facts in
University judicial cases.
But even if the committee mem
bers determine that no legislative
obstacles stand in the way of revis
ing the University's confidentiality
policy, suggestions for modifica
tions are likely to meet a barrage of
protests.
The University, many would
argue, has an ethical obligation to
students to maintain confidentiality
regardless of whether the incidents
in their cases have been reported in
the press. Disclosure not only
serves no one but may in fact harm

the students involved.
The flip-side to this argument, of
fered by Cole, is that disclosure of
facts in "public" cases — specifi
cally, the penalty decided upon —
might heighten the credibility of
Stanford's judicial system and also
present opportunities to discuss is
sues uniquely important to the Uni
versity. 1 would add that the Univer
sity could do a service to the com
munity by discussing specifics of
cases that are in the public domain.
If The Daily is going to cover a stu
dents case regardless of whether
administrators agree to disclose any
facts, the University might as well
make sure we get the facts right.
University President Donald Ken
nedy and Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said they favor discuss
ing Cole's ideas but noted that they
are wary of attempts to modify the
University's traditional policy of
confidentiality.
Kennedy said last night that he
strongly supports Stanford's con
fidentiality policy. "If there is any
question that a student may be
harmed" by disclosing information
on a judicial case, confidentiality
should be maintained, he said.
Lyons also said he favors treating
cases as confidential but that he
wants to hear discussion on Cole's
ideas.
Breitrose said he hasn't decided
how he feels about Cole's sugges
tions.
"I don't know what ought to hap
pen," he said. "I'm most interested
in fairness."
He did express skepticism of
Cole's argument that disclosing the
University's responses to judicial of
fenses would heighten the
credibility of the system.
"Public hangings are another way
to heighten the credibility of the
system," he said. "Of course we
don't do those things because
they're not nice."
Breitrose said that the C-15, the
body empowered to modify Stan
ford's legislative and judicial
charter, would not convene to dis
cuss Cole's suggestions until winter
quarter.
