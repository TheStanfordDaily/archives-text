In its relentless crusade against liberalism, the Reagan
administration will let nothing stand in its way — not
even the truth.
The administration's interdepartmental Working
Group on the Family recently issued a report that blames
"two liberal decades" for the decay of the family, in
creased crime, illegitimate birth, teen-age pregnancy,
divorce, poverty — in short, all the ills of society.
All these problems seem to have increased as welfare
spending increased over the last two decades, the task
force notes. It infers from all this that the expanded
welfare spending caused the problems.
' As if this ridiculous leap of reason weren't bad
enough, the report contains a gross error that the
group's director now acknowledges. In its assessment of
welfare spending, the report states that payments were
indexed to provide regular cost-of-living increases.
That's wrong. Welfare payments are not indexed, and
participants in the welfare program were hurt badly by
the high inflation of the late '70s.
On such sloppy analysis the group bases its conclusion
that "the easy availability of welfare in all its forms has
become a powerful force for the destruction of family
life through the perpetuation of the welfare culture."
The report goes on to say that the government should
"do no harm" to families.
However, such a hands-off policy would certainly
weaken the American family even more. And the family

has pledged to — its cockamamie notion that giving
poor families economic aid actually destroys such
families.
In view of this, it is ironic — but somehow, not sur
prising — that the report lauds the Reagan administra
tion for bringing to a "crashing halt" the "anti-family
agenda" of recent years. The administration, according
to the report, has pioneered a "defense of the family."
The administration is actually defending itself and its
simplistic idea of the "American family." The American
family is as diverse and indescribable as the nation itself,
and a 64-page study that took only seven months to finish
is woefully incomplete.
A truly comprehensive report of the American family
would treat fairly such factors as the influence of the
media, changing economic and social climates, the
reality of drugs and shifting educational priorities. This
report mentions all these, but conveniently groups them
under the guise of "liberalism." Such silly reasoning is
downright embarrassing.
The American family has undergone substantial
changes in the past two decades, and no one will deny
that it is not without its problems. Sadly, the Reagan ad
ministration is not interested in real solutions to the
troubles of the American family. Instead, it is concerned
with unashamed boosterism. That's too bad, because a
true report on the state of the American family would be
very useful.
