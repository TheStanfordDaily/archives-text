# Debate must rise to a higher level

### 
Gone are the days (the brief interval between the
late 1960s and the late 70s) when we would criticize
the oppression of women. Instead, today we discuss
the ways in which it is acceptable to oppress them.
Thus, we attempt to define the expectations that a
woman may reasonably have when in the presence
of a man.

UPRISING

The "debate" about acquaintance rape, in reality a
debate about a woman's consent to have sex, reveals
that in our society heterosexual sex is largely an act
that men do to women and to which women either
do or do not acquiesce — an act in whidh two people
engage, not to fulfill mutual desire, but to satisfy the
participant whq is male;. Because sex is understood
as an act in which men dominate women, an act in
which penetration is the defining feature (although
women do not necessarily most desire it), the debate
about acquaintance rape focuses on whether there
was consent to have sex rather than on whether the
interaction was mutual.
Why, after several decades of consciousness
raising about the ways that women have traditionally
been required to serve men, have the old forms of
male domination again become acceptable? Why
does Stanford pay $7,500 to an expert who
legitimizes the notion that when a woman engages in
what a man thinks of as "fore" play, intercourse
becomes a man's prerogative and a woman's duty?
Why are the physiological concerns (e.g.,
premenstrual syndrome about which Dr. Ruth says
too big a deal is being made) as well as the emotional
concerns of women trivialized? These questions
must be answered in light of the socially determined
role imposed upon women.
A world that demands unemotional behavior in
the public sphere, a world of deadlines, of taking or

giving orders, of meeting the demands of an imper
sonal marketplace governed by the profit motive, re
quires the periodic reinjection of life into the tired
body and soul of one whose life-activity has been
sucked dry (for that which has been drained must be
replenished — human beings have certain emotional
and physical needs that must be met). In such a
world, women serve the role of caretakers and nur
turers, providing the human element. (Unfortunately
it is beyond the scope of this letter to analyze the rea
son that our society creates a separate class of indi
viduals to do its nurturing instead of fostering this
behavior in all people.)
Yet women have increasingly failed to act as men's
full-time caretakers and nurturers. As they have en
tered the paid workforce, women have had to take
on a role similar to that of men. This has required
that they leave behind the particular qualities that
made them into "good" wives and mothers.
While on its face this development might seem
like a positive one, it threatens the maintenance of
the status quo. For without an organized system for
nurturing and caretaking, individuals would be
unable to cope with the pressures of everyday life:
Men would not have an outlet for the frustrations
they face in the working world, and children would
have no sense of society's norms, of those behaviors
that are appropriate for them to adopt. Thus, it is no
accident that a presidential task force recently con
cluded that the American family has been harmed by
the "abrasive experiments of two liberal decades,"
proposing major steps to strengthen it.
Of course, the clock cannot be rolled back and
women forced to return to the home completely
(although the ultra-conservatives are attempting to
do this). But, because of the way our society is
structured, women are compelled to understand
that, even if they work outside the home, they are still
women, i.e., they are still society's nurturers and
caretakers. For this reason, they are constantly bom
barded with messages telling them what it means to

be a woman. From sex "experts," to the Women of
Stanford Calendar, to revisionist feminism that pur
ports that women are naturally fit to be mothers, to
the media, women are reminded that they are
"docile, soft, passive, nurturant, vulnerable, weak,
narcissistic, childlike, incompetent and domestic,
made for child care, home care and husband care"
(Catherine MacKinnon, "Feminism, Marxism,
Method and the State: An Agenda for Theory").
The acceptability of date rape is not, in and of it
self, a message that is necessary for putting women in
their place. But it is important that sex "experts" like
Dr. Ruth tell us how to behave in bed; in doing so
they are actually telling us what it means to be men
and women in our society. Furthermore, in a society
where women must serve men, it is natural that the
contours of any debate on the subject would focus on
the permissibility of date rape, on the limits of male
domination, rather than on the topic of male domina
tion as a whole. Implicit in this controversy is the no
tion that womanhood is a state of subordination, a
state of perpetually existing on the verge of being
penetrated, or, in some sense, screwed.
In general, however, this particular state cannot
simply be understood as men screwing over women,
although most men necessarily take on some of the
sexist behaviors with which they have so thoroughly
been indoctrinated. Rather, it must be understood as
resulting from the need for an orderly and objective
slotting of people into their socially determined
roles. And this slotting is an inevitable consequence
of the existing division of labor. Obviously, we must
shift the terms of this debate away from the question
of what constitutes the "acceptable" oppression of
women and address how we will transform the ma
terial basis of women's (and all people's) oppression.
Uprising is an anti-imperialist organization that is
attempting to understand and take action to combat
class divisions, racism, sexism and the oppression of
gays and lesbians.
