# Dr. Ruth's views unfair, harmful
## 
### 
Research shows
date rape common
I wholeheartedly agree with the
statements made by (Assistant Dean of
Residential Education Alice) Supton,
(Coordinator of the Rape Education
Project Judy) David and (contraceptive
peer counselor Eric) Jackson in refer
ence to Dr. Ruth's remarks on what
constitutes date rape and its preva
lence at institutions of higher learning
(Daily, Nov. 13). During 1983-1984 1
directed an extensive survey research
project on sexual harassment at Har
vard University. The results showed
that sexual harassment, including date
or acquaintance rape, does occur on
university campuses with alarming
frequency. It also showed that harass
ment, and date rape in particular, can
cause devastating personal trauma.
Because so few of the date rapes
that occur are ever reported, often the
victim must suffer alone. Part of the
reason this occurs is because the
support system set up for victims of
sexual harassment and rape are not
adequate or sensitive to the victim's
needs. At Stanford this is clearly not
the case, as the University' has a well
established policy and procedure for
dealing with sexual harassment and a
strong support network of counselors.
A second reason why victims don't
report date rape, and probably a gixxi
part of the reason why date rape even
occurs, rests in social stereotypes and
myths. It is exactly the kind of state
ments that Dr Ruth made concerning
date rape that help perpetuate the
myth that it does not occur and, if it
does, it must be the victim's fault.
These kind of remarks belie the social
pressures that validate the aggressor
and isolate the victim.

Dr. Ruth's comments on date rape
were naive — they were also danger
ous. I trust the Stanford community
will recognize this and be aware of
the very real dangers of sexual harass
ment and date rape on any campus.

Dr. Ruth's speech
misleading about
acquaintance rape
Dr. Ruth Westheimer told the Dink
elspiel crowd last Tuesday night that
"anything that two consenting adults
do on the privacy of their bathroom,
bedroom or kitchen floor is all right."
So far so good, although I wonder
why we have to pay someone to come
and tell us that. She then went on to
make the outrageous statement that
once foreplay has taken place, it is not
rape to force sexual intercourse on an
unwilling partner. Given this last
viewpoint, I wonder why she inserted
the world "consenting" in her first
statement. More to the point, 1
wonder what her doctorate is in and
where she obtained it.
1 don't think you have to be a Ph.D.
to appreciate the ridiculousness of Dr.
Ruth's "All or None" law put into
action: Don't lend your car out for a
day without being prepared to have it
stolen; no more dinner guests, as
they'd have automatic squatter's rights
to your house; and above all. be t en'
careful about walking under that darn
mistletoe in the holiday seav>n —
once they plant that first peck on your
cheek, you're at their mercy.
What's not funny in the least is that
in her statements Dr. Westheimer

propagates misinformation about date
rape. As obvious as it sounds, it ap
pears some don't realize that kissing
and petting do not commit one to
intercourse, and, yes, it's OK to stop
sexual intimacy anywhere in between.
Anyone who knowingly carries out
sexual acts against the will of his or
her partner is guilty of rape, no matter
what transpired earlier. Sorry, Dr.
Ruth, but common sense, decency and
respect for human dignity win out.

Westheimer's talk
gave credence to
bad stereotypes
Dr. Ruth Westheimer's speech last
Tuesday night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium was not simply a vacuous
enumeration of old, well-worn sexual
myths. (Yes, I already know that mas
turbation does not cause hair to grow
on the palm of my hand.) Nor was it
simply an hour-and-a-half-long pitch
for her radio program. She has put
sex on the Farm back into the Dark
Ages.
By siding with those who claim
"date rape" and "acquaintance rape"
are myths invented by a few
"bandwagon" feminists, Dr Ruth has
perpetuated the single most danger
ous idea in the sexual arena: -Men can
decide what is or is not mutual con
sent." The argument that says a man
cannot stop himself after a certain
amount of foreplay is bull.
Stanford wasted time, money and
intellectual energy in bringing Dr.
Ruth here to speak. To all those who
clapped vehemently when Dr. Ruth

dismissed acquaintance rape and date
rape (and most in attendance did), I
say, "Grow up."

Dr. Ruth's advice
bad, chauvinistic
As a proud advocate of feminist
values, I am outraged at Dr. Ruth's
Victorian attitude and chauvinistic
advice. Her statement that "one
should not engage in foreplay if one is
not willing to go further" is ludicrous
and undermines all the important
gains of the feminist movement. This
advice is based on the outdated (and
immoral) assumption that women are
sexual bodies. If a speaker as
chauvinistic and sexist as Dr. Ruth
ever speaks at Stanford again for such
an outlandish sum, I will call for the
immediate resignation of all members
of the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
You might discredit this article by
claiming its author is a fringe member
of the feminist movement who has no
concept of mainstream values. On the
contrary, I am a member of a
respected fraternity and on the foot
ball team. Furthermore, my knowl
edge is not a priori, but is based on
intimate experience. I know, as does
any open-minded individual, that all
relationships should be based on
mutual respect, not some unwritten
contract. I can only hope that any
ensuing student protest (and I hope
there is some) will lead to universal
repudiation of sexist, chauvinistic and
immoral attitudes such as the one
espoused by the self-proclaimed
"expert" Dr. Ruth
