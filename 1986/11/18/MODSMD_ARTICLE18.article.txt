Westheimer was
misunderstood
No one has the right to force
anyone else to have intercourse.
I do not believe, however, that in
her remarks last Tuesday that was the
point Dr. Ruth was trying to make.
We've all heard it before — "don't
tease unless you're going to please." 1
think that was her basic assertion, and
I think she was right. Girls, if you
don't want to have sex with your date,
then don't give him any reason to
think that it is going to happen. Don't
invite trouble.
It sounds wonderful to hear
(Assistant Dean of Residential Educa
tion) Alice Supton saying that we all
have a right to get close, to feel good,
to go as far as we want to, and then to
say no when we don't want to go any
further, regardless of whether or not
we have our clothes on (Daily, Nov.
13). But let's be realistic. We've grown
up in a society that is far from perfect,
one that operates on many different
sets of assumptions, however
stereotypical or unfair they may be.
One of those assumptions is that
when two people engage in advanced
foreplay, intercourse is usually the
next step. (After all, what does the
word "foreplay" refer to?) Again, I'm
not saying that this assumption gives
anyone the right to force anyone else
to have sex. I am saying, however, that
people — especially females — have a
responsiblity to avoid allowing their
partner to make such an assumption if
they do not want to have intercourse.
Leading someone on in that manner is
just plain unfair.
The best way to avoid date rape is
not to pray that your date is someone
noble, who manages to challenge all
of life's basic assumptions. Instead —
and I see this as the point Dr. Ruth
was trying to make — don't engage in
foreplay if you don't want to go
beyond that. It's that simple.
I also feel that Supton is misleading
and just plain wrong when she claims
Dr. Ruth to be implying that
women have a right to lead men on as
much as they want to and then to say
no. Women have to be as responsible
as they want men to be. After all, isn't
that a part of what "shared sexual
reponsibility" is all about?

I would like to thank the ASSU
Speakers Bureau for bringing Dr. Ruth

Westheirmr to campus on Nov. 11.
Hopefully, like most lecturers who
come to campus, she allowed stu
dents, faculty and staff to critically
rethink the way we educate one an
other and how these processes shape
Stanford traditions.
I believe Dr. Ruth's major theme is
one that needs to be spoken at Stan
ford. We need to feel free to talk
about our sexuality and to voice our
beliefs. With 150 to 300 unwanted
pregnancies at Stanford each year,
many the result of the failure to use
contraceptives, our interpersonal
communication is definitely lacking.
After four years at Stanford, 1 am
realizing how easily we legitimize
social practices that build intercourse
without intimacy. In supporting tradi
tions such as full moon in the Quad,
screw your roommate parties,
stranger parties, kinky cupids,
firesides, "first time" stories at dinner
and the need to bring a celebrity to
Stanford to discuss sex, we reinforce
attitudes that find humor in sexual
encounters that lack communication.
This lack of communication becomes
more serious when students become
voyeurs, deface statues representing
intimacy, use intercourse as a contest
and are victims of date rape (all inci
dents that have occurred one or more
times at Stanford during my under
graduate years).
"There's no sex at Stanford," some- ■
one commented to Dr. Ruth (which
was aired to all on the TV news). "If
Stanford destroys the Greek system,
this campus will be dead," a senior
woman commented to me last year.
These narrow attitudes, whether they
are meant to be funny or not, are the
outcome of our inability to create an
environment in which our excitement
for quality education fails to be
realized in relationships.
If this letter sparks anger in you, I
want you to realize that I am angry
too. I am angry that I actively rein
forced many of the Stanford traditions
that prevent true interactions between
students. I am angry that during mo
ments when I realized I didn't fully
agree with these traditions, I didn't
feel empowered to act. If you went to
Dr. Ruth's lecture, I challenge you to
continue talking about relationships
and sex. Invite the Contraceptive
Information Center or Rape Education
Project to your fraternity or dorm.
Whatever you do, don't spend your
years at Stanford accepting attitudes
just because they have been nor
malized by social traditions.

they do not want to have intercourse.
Leading someone on in that manner is
just plain unfair.
The best way to avoid date rape is
not to pray that your date is someone
noble, who manages to challenge all
of life's basic assumptions. Instead —
and I see this as the point Dr. Ruth
was trying to make — don't engage in
foreplay if you don't want to go
beyond that. It's that simple.
I also feel that Supton is misleading
and just plain wrong when she claims
Dr. Ruth to be implying that
women have a right to lead men on as
much as they want to and then to say
no. Women have to be as responsible
as they want men to be. After all, isn't
that a part of what "shared sexual
reponsibility" is all about?

I would like to thank the ASSU
Speakers Bureau for bringing Dr. Ruth

Westheirmr to campus on Nov. 11.
Hopefully, like most lecturers who
come to campus, she allowed stu
dents, faculty and staff to critically
rethink the way we educate one an
other and how these processes shape
Stanford traditions.
I believe Dr. Ruth's major theme is
one that needs to be spoken at Stan
ford. We need to feel free to talk
about our sexuality and to voice our
beliefs. With 150 to 300 unwanted
pregnancies at Stanford each year,
many the result of the failure to use
contraceptives, our interpersonal
communication is definitely lacking.
After four years at Stanford, 1 am
realizing how easily we legitimize
social practices that build intercourse
without intimacy. In supporting tradi
tions such as full moon in the Quad,
screw your roommate parties,
stranger parties, kinky cupids,
firesides, "first time" stories at dinner
and the need to bring a celebrity to
Stanford to discuss sex, we reinforce
attitudes that find humor in sexual
encounters that lack communication.
This lack of communication becomes
more serious when students become
voyeurs, deface statues representing
intimacy, use intercourse as a contest
and are victims of date rape (all inci
dents that have occurred one or more
times at Stanford during my under
graduate years).
"There's no sex at Stanford," some- ■
one commented to Dr. Ruth (which
was aired to all on the TV news). "If
Stanford destroys the Greek system,
this campus will be dead," a senior
woman commented to me last year.
These narrow attitudes, whether they
are meant to be funny or not, are the
outcome of our inability to create an
environment in which our excitement
for quality education fails to be
realized in relationships.
If this letter sparks anger in you, I
want you to realize that I am angry
too. I am angry that I actively rein
forced many of the Stanford traditions
that prevent true interactions between
students. I am angry that during mo
ments when I realized I didn't fully
agree with these traditions, I didn't
feel empowered to act. If you went to
Dr. Ruth's lecture, I challenge you to
continue talking about relationships
and sex. Invite the Contraceptive
Information Center or Rape Education
Project to your fraternity or dorm.
Whatever you do, don't spend your
years at Stanford accepting attitudes
just because they have been nor
malized by social traditions.

Westheimer was
misunderstood
No one has the right to force
anyone else to have intercourse.
I do not believe, however, that in
her remarks last Tuesday that was the
point Dr. Ruth was trying to make.
We've all heard it before — "don't
tease unless you're going to please." 1
think that was her basic assertion, and
I think she was right. Girls, if you
don't want to have sex with your date,
then don't give him any reason to
think that it is going to happen. Don't
invite trouble.
It sounds wonderful to hear
(Assistant Dean of Residential Educa
tion) Alice Supton saying that we all
have a right to get close, to feel good,
to go as far as we want to, and then to
say no when we don't want to go any
further, regardless of whether or not
we have our clothes on (Daily, Nov.
13). But let's be realistic. We've grown
up in a society that is far from perfect,
one that operates on many different
sets of assumptions, however
stereotypical or unfair they may be.
One of those assumptions is that
when two people engage in advanced
foreplay, intercourse is usually the
next step. (After all, what does the
word "foreplay" refer to?) Again, I'm
not saying that this assumption gives
anyone the right to force anyone else
to have sex. I am saying, however, that
people — especially females — have a
responsiblity to avoid allowing their
partner to make such an assumption if
they do not want to have intercourse.
Leading someone on in that manner is
just plain unfair.
The best way to avoid date rape is
not to pray that your date is someone
