# Band proposes charter
## 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
lii a meeting yesterday with Athletic
Director Andy Geiger, the Stanford
Hand submitted a working draft of
guidelines for its conduct and perfor
mance in the future.
The final draft will be reviewed by
Geiger, and a decision about the extent
of the Band's participation in Big Game
will be announced today.
The document is in two parts: the ac
tual charter for the Band which w ill be
printed each year in the Band hand
hook and which will be re-emphasized
each fall; and specific applications of
the charter to the current situation.
The document will be finished
today, said Band Manager Jeff Stevens.
"There are specific points that haven't
been completely outlined yet," he said.
The charter itself is divided into
three parts: a statement of purpose, a
statement of organizational responsi
bilities and a statement of individual
responsibilities.
The charter "is basically the Band's
Fundamental Standard," Stevens j aid.
The current applications deal with
the Band's show-planning process, alco
hol policy, musicianship and individ
uals' accountability for their behavior.
This portion of the charter is still gen-
Band needs Geiger's input before
details of the document can be com
pleted.
"We're serious about everything we
put in here," Stevens said. "He
(Geiger) seemed to be very happy with
everything we had written. His main
concern was that the Band as a whole
agreed with the document."
Stevens met with the Band in an
open meeting last Thursday night to
discusss the specific issues presented
in the charter. "That's where all the
ideas come from. The ideas come from
the Band as a whole."
Last night Stevens read the charter to
the Band after their regular rehearsal
in order to get the Band's reaction.
"The response was very- positive," he
said. "People agreed with what was
said."
Regarding the enforcement of the
charter, Stevens emphasized the im
portance of its last line: "It is the re
sponsibility of all members of the Band
to monitor themselves and each other
in order to recognize potential prob
lems and prevent them before they oc
cur."
"If these were rules that Andy
Geiger had given to us, then it would
be a matter of somebody having to en
force them," Stevens explained. "But
since we made these guidelines our
selves, it's simply everyone conducting
themselves in the manner they've
already stated they feel they should."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
called the Band's charter "a good first
step."
"I think it's something on which the
Band could build," he said, adding that
the charter is "long on good
generalizations" and "short on im
plemention."

"The charter itself is general, and
that's the purpose of it," Stevens said.
"It needs to be able to be interpreted
five years from now, 10 years from
now, and used effectively. If we made it
too specific now, there would be no
room for the interpretation in the
future. The intent is that the charter
will be used to form similar interpreta
tions in the future as they're neces
sary."
"We didn't feel that we could be all
inclusive if we said a specific incident
would warrant a specific disciplinary
action," he said.
Regarding the role of leadership in
enforcing the charter, Stevens said: "It
(the charter) definitely talks about
leadership in the sense that it empha
sizes the management's role in per
petrating the standards that we've set."
Robert Freelen, vice president for
Public Affairs, said the charter was "not
a bad start on a set of good intentions.
What matters is how it coincides with
performance.
"If the Band lives up to what's in
here, it probably will work," he added.
Stevens said, "The whole point of
the suspension was to address the
future of the Band, not so short-term as
Big Game but rather for years to come.
And that's what we've done here, and
that's what's important to us.
"It's important to us that we have an
opportunity to march at Big Game, but
we're also very interested in setting up
a set of guidelines for the future so that
we don't have to deal with this kind of
situation again."
