# How new tax law affects students
## 
### 
An extensive review of the new
tax laws indicates that, for the most
part, students in the winter and
spring quarters of 1986-87 will not
be severely impacted by the new
taxation.
As stated in my earlier memo, all
students on fellowships that were
offered prior to Aug. 17, 1986, are
tax-exempt for this academic year.
Students on assistantships in
teaching will have only minor tax
liabilities for the winter and spring
quarter stipends. The stipend
received by a student on a course
assistantship for winter and spring
quarters falls below the single per
son taxable level. We estimate that

E. TRAUGOTT

single students on teaching assis
tantships will be subject to ap
proximately $60 tax for the sums
received in winter and spring quar
ters, and those on teaching fellow
ships approximately $100 tax for
the two quarters. Students on re
search assistantships receive
varying compensation and
therefore will have varying tax
liabilities. The total taxation for the
year, of course, will depend on
what the students' plans are after
July 1. The controller's office is re
quired to estimate a 12 month fig
ure and will start withholding in
January 1987 based on this estimate
rate for the year. As yet no official
federal withholding tables are
available. The controller's office
must estimate the appropriate
amounts to be deducted from each
semi-monthly paycheck. For es
timates for a single student with no
dependents, see the accompanying
chart.
Withholding will commence on
Jan. 22, 1987, for earnings from the
payroll period ended Jan. 15, 1987.
Students who believe that they will
not owe 1986 income taxes and will
earn less than $4,440 in 1987,
thereby not owing 1987 tax, should
consider filing federal form W-4
Employee's Withholding Allowance
Certificate and claim exemption
from withholding. Whether or not
you expect to be liable for with
holding, you should review your
personal circumstances and make
appropriate adjustments on a W-4
withholding amounts. Form W-4 is
found within Stanford payroll form
SU-32 Employee's Tax Data. This
form is available in departments;
please file the completed form with

the payroll office on the first floor
of Encina Hall.
We have arranged an open forum
to provide information and answer
general questions. Representatives
of the controller's office, legal office
and the graduate division will be
present. The forum will be held
next Monday, Nov. 24, from 4:30 to
6 p.m. in room 180 of the Stanford
Law School.
We are, of course, very con
cerned about teaching assistants
and research assistants with limited
resources who may find even the
payment of a modest amount of tax
exceedingly difficult. We have,
therefore, established within the
graduate division a pool of funds to
meet the emergency needs of stu
dents who find that this sudden
taxation causes undue burden. Stu
dents in this situation should first
contact their department to see
whether there is anv alleviation

possible within the department. If
this is not possible, they should fill
out a form available from the
graduate awards office to indicate
how the additional tax has caused a
burden. Small grants-in-aid will be
made to those who are in unex
pected difficulties due to the tax.
Only teaching assistants and re
search assistants in master's, engi
neering and doctoral programs in
the schools of Earth Sciences, Edu
cation, Engineering, Humanities
and Sciences and Medicine will be
eligible. Students enrolled in the
business, law and M.D. programs
are funded through these schools;
since they are not supported on
graduate division funds, they are
not eligible for this grant-in-aid pro
gram. The criteria used for establish
ing need will be the standard Stan
ford student budget used for loan
eligibility. Any extraordinary ex
penses which are not standard
budget items will also be consid
ered in determining eligibility.
At this point we are still planning
how best to handle the tax situation
after July 1. We hope that this spe
cial assistance fund will care for
undue hardship caused this winter
and spring quarter.

possible within the department. If
this is not possible, they should fill
out a form available from the
graduate awards office to indicate
how the additional tax has caused a
burden. Small grants-in-aid will be
made to those who are in unex
pected difficulties due to the tax.
Only teaching assistants and re
search assistants in master's, engi
neering and doctoral programs in
the schools of Earth Sciences, Edu
cation, Engineering, Humanities
and Sciences and Medicine will be
eligible. Students enrolled in the
business, law and M.D. programs
are funded through these schools;
since they are not supported on
graduate division funds, they are
not eligible for this grant-in-aid pro
gram. The criteria used for establish
ing need will be the standard Stan
ford student budget used for loan
eligibility. Any extraordinary ex
penses which are not standard
budget items will also be consid
ered in determining eligibility.
At this point we are still planning
how best to handle the tax situation
after July 1. We hope that this spe
cial assistance fund will care for
undue hardship caused this winter
and spring quarter.

An extensive review of the new
tax laws indicates that, for the most
part, students in the winter and
spring quarters of 1986-87 will not
be severely impacted by the new
taxation.
As stated in my earlier memo, all
students on fellowships that were
offered prior to Aug. 17, 1986, are
tax-exempt for this academic year.
Students on assistantships in
teaching will have only minor tax
liabilities for the winter and spring
quarter stipends. The stipend
received by a student on a course
assistantship for winter and spring
quarters falls below the single per
son taxable level. We estimate that

single students on teaching assis
tantships will be subject to ap
proximately $60 tax for the sums
received in winter and spring quar
ters, and those on teaching fellow
ships approximately $100 tax for
the two quarters. Students on re
search assistantships receive
varying compensation and
therefore will have varying tax
liabilities. The total taxation for the
year, of course, will depend on
what the students' plans are after
July 1. The controller's office is re
quired to estimate a 12 month fig
ure and will start withholding in
January 1987 based on this estimate
rate for the year. As yet no official
federal withholding tables are
available. The controller's office
must estimate the appropriate
amounts to be deducted from each
semi-monthly paycheck. For es
timates for a single student with no
dependents, see the accompanying
chart.
Withholding will commence on
Jan. 22, 1987, for earnings from the
payroll period ended Jan. 15, 1987.
Students who believe that they will
not owe 1986 income taxes and will
earn less than $4,440 in 1987,
thereby not owing 1987 tax, should
consider filing federal form W-4
Employee's Withholding Allowance
Certificate and claim exemption
from withholding. Whether or not
you expect to be liable for with
holding, you should review your
personal circumstances and make
appropriate adjustments on a W-4
withholding amounts. Form W-4 is
found within Stanford payroll form
SU-32 Employee's Tax Data. This
form is available in departments;
please file the completed form with

the payroll office on the first floor
of Encina Hall.
We have arranged an open forum
to provide information and answer
general questions. Representatives
of the controller's office, legal office
and the graduate division will be
present. The forum will be held
next Monday, Nov. 24, from 4:30 to
6 p.m. in room 180 of the Stanford
Law School.
We are, of course, very con
cerned about teaching assistants
and research assistants with limited
resources who may find even the
payment of a modest amount of tax
exceedingly difficult. We have,
therefore, established within the
graduate division a pool of funds to
meet the emergency needs of stu
dents who find that this sudden
taxation causes undue burden. Stu
dents in this situation should first
contact their department to see
whether there is anv alleviation
