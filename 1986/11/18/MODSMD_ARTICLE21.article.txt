# The 						'80s is the decade of stupidity
## 
### 
I sure hope I'm around in a few decades to see
how history treats the '80s; I figure it'll have to he
passed off as a case of either mass insanity or utter
stupidity.
What made me think of this was Andy Gieger's
comment that tjie Stanford Band fails to show the
"taste and values that represent this place. I d love to
see the LSJUMB take this seriously and walk onto the
field wearing nothing but sunglasses and resumes.

Not that the deplorable mental attitude of today is
limited to Stanford; it's not. I'd just like to believe the
progressive thinkers here notice that our age is the
curious offspring of hedonism and radical
Puritanism. It seems that the '80s could be called
"The Me Generation meets Jerry Fallwell."
Have you ever wondered how the same society
could promote selfish, materialistic yuppie-dom, yet
simultaneously find itself concerned every month
with a new moral crisis, curable only by intense legis
lation? The two don't make sense together; the
moralizing BMW crowd, with its calls for a pom-free,
drug-free nation, in itself hasn't the moral fiber to
note the injustice inherent in today's society. How
many yuppies know that one third of America's black
population lives under the poverty level? Of those,
do any care? Why doesn't that make the network
news, while every night brings another exclusive

expose on "America's crack epidemic."?
Face it: Our sense of right and wrong is now hope
lessly confused.
Could any other post-McCarthy era produce a Lyn
don Laßouche? That's not likely. When 1 first heard of
Laßouche about six years ago I thought he was run
ning as a joke. Unfortunately, Laßouche is no Pat
Paulsen; he's a threat. The paranoid Proposition 64,
Laßouche's knee-jerk reaction to the AIDS problem,
is still disturbing, even after being turned down. Per
haps most unnerving is the fact that hundreds of
thousands of people voted yes on this legislative fit of
homophobia. Was 64 a rational way to deal with a
real problem? No, it was one part of society trying to
pass a damning moral judgement on another.
How bout the thought of Pat Robertson running
for president? Now there's no problem with his
being a deeply religious man; few were bothered by
Rev. Jesse Jackson's running for the Democratic nom
ination in 1984, and he too is a religious leader. Even
John F. Kennedy was feared by some due to his Cath
olic status. But religious wholeness is not a reason to
be bothered by Robertson, its his more secular
beliefs on what's wrong with America. Between
Robertson, Jimmy Swaggert, Oral Roberts and their
cronies, some awful things have been said; anyone
remember the comment: "AIDS is God's punishment
for gays"? Then there's the insistence on seeing the
Soviet Union as the "Evil Empire." If U.S. leaders see
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as Darth Vader
without a mask, you can bet that there'll never be
peace on earth ... or good will toward men, for that
matter.
Admittedly, neither Laßouche nor Robertson is in
volved with the government now, but that doesn't
mean the feds can't screw things up on their own. In

the last year, we've seen Congress worn, its silly little
head over some national crises it's either misper
ceived or handled stupidly. Are you happy that your
elected officials held hearings over the supposed
satanic and/or anti-social messages in rock music?
Equally amusing is the Meese Commission por
nography report. A brief glance at the primarily con
servative make-up of the committee suggests that the
findings were probably made before the study
began. And despite the fact we've all been told a
hundred times that rape is a violent —* not a sexual
— crime, the committee concluded that "soft-core
porn'' like Playboy magazine encourages sexual
crimes.
Consider these cases (and perhaps also the
recently passed "anti-drug bill," which, aside from al
locating more money for enforcement and little for
rehabilitation, allows for the death penalty for some
crimes ... an over-reaction to a stunning degree) and
look at what's in common. In each case, the
legislature is attempting to pass a moral judgment
on the lowly populace (are we citizens, or subjects?).
In the end, the big loser is the individual. If society
is to commit itself to paranoia over these petty,
pseudo-moral issues, unanimity of opinion becomes
mandated. The one who sorts out right and wrong in
his own mind must then become the enemy of soci
ety, for he ends up standing in the way of the scream
ing throng of "great society" seekers. In the end, he
faces the classic situation of the individualist: Capit
ulate or be ostracized.
Welcome to the '80s; check your identity at the
door.
