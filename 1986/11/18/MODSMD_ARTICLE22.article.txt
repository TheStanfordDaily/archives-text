Maybe Stanford
isn't very classy
In defense of his decision to
suspend the Band, Andy Geiger was
quoted as saying, "They don't seem to
be able to have a level of taste and
values that represent this place."
Perhaps Geiger is unaware of what is
becoming an acceptable "level of taste
and values" at Stanford. Next time he
pedals through White Plaza he should
take a look at the T-shirt being sold
for Big Game. A trend seems to be
developing where the more vulgar the
slogan, the bigger the sales. This
year's shirt, the most distasteful yet,
depicts a male grabbing his crotch
with the words "Hey Cal â€” We've Got
Your Big Game Right Here."
Maybe the Band does represent
behavior that is unfortunately accep
table to a growing segment of the
Stanford population.
