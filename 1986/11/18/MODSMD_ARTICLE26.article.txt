## Stanford's neighbor stands on its own Paly High has self-respect 
### NICOLE MICHAELS 
Its 22 acres across El Camino from Stanford were
purchased for less than it costs to buy a Big Game
ticket. But to most Stanford students, Palo Alto High
School is simply Paly," that hubbub of teeming teen
activity that occasionally spills over El Camino into
football games, Meyer Library, Lake Lag and fraternity
parties.
Some Stanford students make them welcome;
others are open in their disapproval of "Paly kids" on
campus. Regardless, it is likely that among Stanford
students the complexion of Palo Alto High is judged
more by the fair-faced Paly Girl than by Palo Alto
High s academic reputation. A deeper understanding
of our neighbor might surprise us as much as the fact
that the Paly High real estate, now valued at some $22
million dollars, was originally sold by Stanford for
$10.
In 1924, Stanford sold the land with the stipulation
that it must be used for "school purposes." Any other
use would result in the automatic option for Stanford
to buy back the land at its original purchase price,
regardless of its accumulated worth, including any
standing structures. Today, the land alone is worth an
estimated $750,000 to $1 million per acre.
The sale in 1924 is part of a long relationship be
tween Stanford and the surrounding community. It is
likely that at the time the land was sold, there was a
need for a high school where Stanford faculty mem
bers could send their daughters and sons. This need
developed into a tradition that continues, as does the
need for the Stanford faculty to educate its children
locally — and excellently.
Paly High is nationally renowned for its rigorous
curriculum and academic excellence. Paly counselor
Wally Porter believes the high school is influenced
far more by Stanford's proximity than by the progeny
of the University's faculty.
"I don't think you will find a major university in
this country that does not profoundly influence the
surrounding high schools," said Porter. "Stanford is
perhaps especially far-reaching in its influence. Take
Silicon Valley, for example."
Porter points out that Stanford as an institution
draws professionals into the area; these professionals
in turn send their children to local schools, such as
Palo Alto High. He believes it is the "overall quality of
the students," not the presence of faculty sons and
daughters in particular, that makes Paly so competi
tive academically.
Several Paly seniors would tend to disagree with
their counselor.
"It's not that (children of Stanford faculty) are so
smart," said Brian Noble. "It's a work ethic they have.
Everyone else here has to work harder to keep up."

Students such as Noble, however, see the perfor
mance of Paly students who are the daughters and
sons of Stanford faculty as only one element that
makes Paly a competitive high school. Noble and
other students identify the demanding curricular
structure as a greater source of competition.
Paly's curriculum is divided into several tracks. Ad
vanced Placement classes are comparable to college
level classes. Courses that make up the A Lane are the
most demanding standard courses, followed by B
Lane or "bonehead" classes and the more remedial
track.
"The problem with AP classes is that they act as a
sort of segregation," said Noble, who is enrolled in
an AP English course. "You find the same students in
a lot of your classes because of the way your
schedule works out. If they're in one class, they're
probably in the next."
The track system in general tends to homogenize
class performance by maintaining a similar cross
section of the student body in each class.
While such a system fosters academic excellence
and competition in some classes, it appears to foster
academic stagnation and a lack of academic confi
dence among students in others.
One student said that although she could maintain
an excellent grade average in the B Lane, she felt dis
couraged from entering the A Lane and testing her
performance there.
Another student, senior Jill Rodgers, said "I'd
rather get A's in the B Lane than B's in the A Lane."
What students such as Rodgers fail to realize is that
most admissions programs — Stanford's for example
— judge grade point averages within the context of

study programs. According to one Stanford Admis
sions representative, "Stanford judges the student on
how well she or he took advantage of available re
sources at the school."
When Rodgers was advised of the admissions
policy, she thought a moment and said, "Well, it
makes me feel better to get A's in the B Lane."
Most students like Rodgers do not intend to apply
to schools like Stanford. Are those who do apply at an
advantage because they attend Paly High?
Porter feels Paly students are at a certain advan
tage. "Stanford knows," said Porter, "that Paly stu
dents admitted in the past have done very well (at
Stanford)."
In fact, Stanford Admissions does examine the
Stanford record of matriculated students from an ap
plicant's high school: A legacy of success within a par
ticular high school could conceivably improve a stu
dent's chances of admission, the same way a family
legacy might.
With an average acceptance rate of approximately
12 to 20 students per year, according to Porter, and
about half those students accepting Stanford, Paly
High students could easily feel optimistic about
"getting in."
Both Stanford Admissions officers and Paly stu
dents themselves, however, are quick to point out
that there are many other factors involved in admis
sions decisions.
"We hear that Stanford doesn't want local
kids,"said Rogers. "It might be tougher to get in be
cause you're a Paly student."

Another student stood by Paly's
sound academic program, saying, "Paly
students get in because of Paly's
reputation, not location."
What about "getting in" on campus
social life? Do Paly students feel
welcome or unwanted by their Stan
ford neighbors? Apparently Paly stu
dents are very much abreast of the
gossip their presence creates.

'Paly does its share
of raging.'

Rodgers, a veteran cheerleader at
Paly, said, "We hear that Stanford
women don't like us because we take
their men away."
Asked about the average Stanford
man's opinion of Paly students,
Rodgers said simply, "Two guys going
to a Stanford frat party won't get in; but
two guys with two girls will."
Other students, such as Noble, are in
no hurry to investigate life on the Stan
ford campus. "There's plenty of time
for frat parties," he said.
In general, Paly students claim that

with the exception of football games
and studying for finals in Meyer Li
brary, they venture onto the Stanford
campus only when the social scene at
Paly is slow.
"Paly does its own fair share of
raging," Noble said.
Even Stanford's academic life does
not hold enough appeal for some Paly
students. With an average of some 40
applicants annually, Stanford is cer
tainly high on Paly seniors' lists; still,
about half of those accepted generally
elect to attend another institution.
Noble refuted the notion that stu
dents attend Paly to get into Stanford.
"Students go to Paly to go to Paly," he
said.
"I would have gone to Stanford if it
hadn't been across the street," said an
other student.
All of the seniors applying to college
seemed eager for a new experience.
Rodgers rolled her eyes at the
thought of attending UC-Santa Bar
bara. "There are so many Paly students
planning to go there, it'd be Paly all
over again," she said.
What do Paly students think of Stan
ford students? Perhaps Rodgers
summed it up best: "Stanford students?
I dunno. They never come out of
there."
