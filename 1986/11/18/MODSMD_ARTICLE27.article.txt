# Axe Comm. stokes Big Game fire
## Bear to be toasted on lakebed pyre 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Staff writer 
Their work is going up in smoke.
All the effort put forth by almost
500 people in preparing, organiz
ing and constructing this year's Big
Game Bonfire will burst into flame
at 10:15 p.m. Thursday in the bed of
dry Lake Lag.
The Bonfire, organized and spon
sored by the Axe Committee,
represents the combined efforts of
students from all over campus.
The Bonfire will be over 30 feet
tall and will be made of telephone
poles for sturdiness, wooden pal
lets and a latticework frame made
of two-by-fours.
Volunteers will work throughout
Thursday to erect the pyre. All inter
ested students are welcome to drop
by the lakebed and lend a hand.
"No experience necessary," says
Axe Committee member Scott Roth.
The frame of the Bonfire will be
topped by an effigy of a bear.
Axe Committee Chair Mike Tuc
hin, working on the Bonfire for his
second year, says, "There will cer
tainly be some sort of bear on the
Bonfire."
Sophomore Michael McNitt, one
of the security organizers for the
Bonfire, says that the disappearance
of Cal's bear adds greatly to the
need for security.
"We may have a visit from
Berkeley people who think we have
the bear," McNitt said. "Or whoever
has the bear may decide to come
share in the fun."
For those reasons as well as "just
to make sure nobody gets hurt or
out of hand," the Axe Committee
has provided ample security forces
for the event.
The IFC (Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil) is providing most of our secur
ity," McNitt explained. "Other than
the IFC and Kappa Sig, most of the
security is individuals who have
volunteered to help out."

Volunteers were recruited from
all over campus and attended train
ing sessions last Wednesday and
Friday nights.
The security needs of the Bonfire
hardly begin and end with the bur
ning of the structure itself.
"Axe Committee members have
been guarding the Bonfire supplies
at the lake bed starting on Monday,"
Roth said. "On Wednesday night

"We may have a
visit from
Berkeley people
who think we
have the bear, or
whoever has the
bear may decide
to come share in
the fun.'

several members will sleep there in
order to keep the wood safe and to
be ready to begin building the
structure at 6 a.m. on Thursday."
The Bonfire show will consist of
much more than a giant
pyromaniafest.
The ceremonies will include the
LSJUMB, the Fleet Street Singers, all
the football coaches, senior football
players and a fireworks display. In
addition, "there may be a couple of
special guests, but it's not sure yet,
and it should be a surprise anyway,"
according to sophomore Roth.
Money for the program was
raised from the Axe Committee's
fee assessment as well as funds provided by Pepsi
and Adidas, co-sponsors of the event.
Putting on the Bonfire has not been that easy,
though. Problems have plagued the event since
its revival in 1985.
"I couldn't even believe that Mike (Tuchin) and
Scott (Martin) were able to get the Bonfire ap
proved by the University and Palo Alto," said Jon
Erickson, one of four faculty advisers for the Axe
Committee. "But they did a tremendous market
ing job and came up with a program that no one
could argue with."
The problems went beyond just getting the
program approved.
"This year one of the major sponsors we were
counting on didn't come through," McNitt ex
plained. "So our fee assessment became more
important than ever. We also had to be much
more critical when deciding what to have in the
program."
The hard work of the Axe Committee members
and the student volunteers will all be realized

when the first torch is lit Thursday.
"I'm very excited about the (Bonfire) rally,"
said junior Jay Theiler. "1 really think the Axe
Committee has worked very hard on it, and it will
be well worth attending."
This year s bonfire is the second in two years
after a ten-year fire-free stint between 1975 and
1985. The bonfire tradition was discontinued in
1976 when two student builders suffered broken
legs while constructing the gigantic campftre.
The safety of bonfire builders, the lack of
proper equipment and the use of improper
crowd control procedures were all factors in the
University administration's denial of the request
for a bonfire in 1977. Contrary to popular belief,
waste and air pollution caused by the fire were
only secondary concerns in the cancellation of
the event.
Last year, based on favorable past experiences
with the San Francisco rally the administration ex
tended provisional permission to the Axe Com
mitee to reignite the bonfire tradition on a trial
basis.The trial came off without a hitch.

Berkeley people who think we have
the bear," McNitt said. "Or whoever
has the bear may decide to come
share in the fun."
For those reasons as well as "just
to make sure nobody gets hurt or
out of hand," the Axe Committee
has provided ample security forces
for the event.
The IFC (Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil) is providing most of our secur
ity," McNitt explained. "Other than
the IFC and Kappa Sig, most of the
security is individuals who have
volunteered to help out."

Volunteers were recruited from
all over campus and attended train
ing sessions last Wednesday and
Friday nights.
The security needs of the Bonfire
hardly begin and end with the bur
ning of the structure itself.
"Axe Committee members have
been guarding the Bonfire supplies
at the lake bed starting on Monday,"
Roth said. "On Wednesday night

"We may have a
visit from
Berkeley people
who think we
have the bear, or
whoever has the
bear may decide
to come share in
the fun.'

several members will sleep there in
order to keep the wood safe and to
be ready to begin building the
structure at 6 a.m. on Thursday."
The Bonfire show will consist of
much more than a giant
pyromaniafest.
The ceremonies will include the
LSJUMB, the Fleet Street Singers, all
the football coaches, senior football
players and a fireworks display. In
addition, "there may be a couple of
special guests, but it's not sure yet,
and it should be a surprise anyway,"
according to sophomore Roth.
Money for the program was
raised from the Axe Committee's
fee assessment as well as funds provided by Pepsi
and Adidas, co-sponsors of the event.
Putting on the Bonfire has not been that easy,
though. Problems have plagued the event since
its revival in 1985.
"I couldn't even believe that Mike (Tuchin) and
Scott (Martin) were able to get the Bonfire ap
proved by the University and Palo Alto," said Jon
Erickson, one of four faculty advisers for the Axe
Committee. "But they did a tremendous market
ing job and came up with a program that no one
could argue with."
The problems went beyond just getting the
program approved.
"This year one of the major sponsors we were
counting on didn't come through," McNitt ex
plained. "So our fee assessment became more
important than ever. We also had to be much
more critical when deciding what to have in the
program."
The hard work of the Axe Committee members
and the student volunteers will all be realized

when the first torch is lit Thursday.
"I'm very excited about the (Bonfire) rally,"
said junior Jay Theiler. "1 really think the Axe
Committee has worked very hard on it, and it will
be well worth attending."
This year s bonfire is the second in two years
after a ten-year fire-free stint between 1975 and
1985. The bonfire tradition was discontinued in
1976 when two student builders suffered broken
legs while constructing the gigantic campftre.
The safety of bonfire builders, the lack of
proper equipment and the use of improper
crowd control procedures were all factors in the
University administration's denial of the request
for a bonfire in 1977. Contrary to popular belief,
waste and air pollution caused by the fire were
only secondary concerns in the cancellation of
the event.
Last year, based on favorable past experiences
with the San Francisco rally the administration ex
tended provisional permission to the Axe Com
mitee to reignite the bonfire tradition on a trial
basis.The trial came off without a hitch.

Anticipating a bear barbecue, diligent firestarters set up last year's Big Game Bonfire (the first since 1975) in the dry bed of Lagunita.
Their work is going up in smoke.
All the effort put forth by almost
500 people in preparing, organiz
ing and constructing this year's Big
Game Bonfire will burst into flame
at 10:15 p.m. Thursday in the bed of
dry Lake Lag.
The Bonfire, organized and spon
sored by the Axe Committee,
represents the combined efforts of
students from all over campus.
The Bonfire will be over 30 feet
tall and will be made of telephone
poles for sturdiness, wooden pal
lets and a latticework frame made
of two-by-fours.
Volunteers will work throughout
Thursday to erect the pyre. All inter
ested students are welcome to drop
by the lakebed and lend a hand.
"No experience necessary," says
Axe Committee member Scott Roth.
The frame of the Bonfire will be
topped by an effigy of a bear.
Axe Committee Chair Mike Tuc
hin, working on the Bonfire for his
second year, says, "There will cer
tainly be some sort of bear on the
Bonfire."
Sophomore Michael McNitt, one
of the security organizers for the
Bonfire, says that the disappearance
of Cal's bear adds greatly to the
need for security.
"We may have a visit from
Berkeley people who think we have
the bear," McNitt said. "Or whoever
has the bear may decide to come
share in the fun."
For those reasons as well as "just
