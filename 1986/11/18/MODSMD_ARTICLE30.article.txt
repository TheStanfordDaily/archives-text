## First-place Stanford travels to Berkeley for showdown 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Fresh off its 12th and 13th straight Pacific 10 Con
ference matches, with yet another team member
named Pac-10 Player of the Week and with four more
matches in the next eight days, Stanford women's
volleyball has more than enough going on in its
already hectic world.
"It's always hard to have games during the week,
especially since the ones this weekend (UCLA and
USC) are really, really important," Cardinal hitter
Teresa Smith said. "We've just got to realize that
there are only three weeks left in the season, no mat
ter what... we have to keep on pushing."
Tonight, Stanford will be in Berkeley to face Cali
fornia for the second and final time this fall. In the
teams' first meeting, Cal freshman Tiffany Rochelle
; dominated the first game with eight kills, leading the
Bears to a 15-13 win. Rochelle would manage only
11 three more winners for the rest of the match, though,
' as Stanford ran it out 15-9, 15-7, 15-6.
This evening's match will be broadcast live on
KZSU at 7:30 p.m.
The Cardinal's marathon victories over the
weekend put it atop the conference with a 14-1
record, equaled by a UCLA team that Stanford has
already trounced in three games, and far ahead of the
, rest of the league. The spikers are 18-8 overall,
ranked 11th in the nation.
Cal is unranked at 16-17 overall and in the middle
of the Pac-10 with a 6-9 conference record. While you

can put most of your money on a Cardinal win, don't
put all of it on the line, especially given the trouble
Arizona gave the team Saturday night.
Smith said she doesn't expect a very tough battle
and that she and her teammates will use last
weekend's events to their advantage. "I think we
definitely learned from (the two matches); we just
started out flat," she said. "I don't think it will happen
again."
The newest member of the Stanford Pac-10 Player
of-the-Week club is junior Nancy Reno, who joins
classmates Wendi Rush and Smith, who has won the
award twice. Reno earned her membership as she
led the Cardinal in kills both Friday and Saturday and
achieved a .470 hitting percentage for the weekend.
She also had eight aces and 10 total blocks for the
matches.
No other conference program has won four
Player of the Week honors. The Cardinal is also
leading the conference in more individual and team
statistical categories than any of its competition. In
fact, even on the national level, Stanford is impres
sive statistically. Coming into the weekend, the Card
inal was first among all the country's Division I
schools in assists average and second in kills average.
As the players and coaches have always been the
first to say, however, statistics really don't mean any
thing. This weekend, the conference title will be at
stake, and even after that's been decided, there will
be one more small concern for the spikers: the NCAA
playoffs.
Even with a playoff berth insured by virtue of its

conference record, how the Cardinal does in its four
remaining matches, especially those against top 10-
ranked UCLA and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, will play
a pan in how it does in post-season play.
It is tempting to look right to the playoffs, Smith
said, but still important to take the rest of the regular
season one game at a time. "First things first; per
sonally, I'm thinking a little about the regionals, but
my main course of thought is directed towards this
weekend," Smith said. "(Tonight) will hopefully just
be a good, solid match."
Talking about the NCAAs, the conference's leading
percentage hitter said she didn't think the "flat" per
formance Stanford gave in the Arizona game would
be seen in the playoffs. "We'll be psyched," Smith
said.
While much of the Cardinal's competition in
December's championship draw could be from the
Pac-TO — Stanford Coach Don Shaw said he expects
probably four conference teams will be given bids —
it is the Pacific Coast Athletic Conference that will fill
out much of the tournament. The PCAA, with teams
like San Diego State, Hawaii and Cal Poly, will in all
likelihood have six of its members going for the col
legiate title, according to Shaw.
Going into tonight's match, Stanford's offense con
tinues to be led by Smith, who has 423 kills and a
.354 hitting percentage, and directed by Rush, who
has 1,191 assists. Laura Olesen and Reno lead the
team's front row defense, with 102 and 101 total
blocks, respectively. Co-captain Barbra Fontana
heads up the back row defense with 349 digs.
