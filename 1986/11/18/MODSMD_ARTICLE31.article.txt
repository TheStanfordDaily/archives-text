## 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
After a long off-season break, the Stanford men and
women's crew teams entered the fall season with a bang.
Saturday, at the Stanford Fall Regatta at Redwood Creek,
Stanford swept to a one-two finish against tough local com
petiton in the four-oared shell category.
Stanford's men's A and B teams finished first and second
respectively against competition that included IJC-Davis, the
California Maritime Academy, the University of the Pacific,
Sacramento State, California, St. Mary's and the University of
San Francisco.
Behind the winning Cardinal shells, UC-Davis captured
third place, California finished fourth and Pacific fifth. Stan
ford's C and D teams finished sixth and seventh out of the 13
varsity shells entered.
Stanford's first-place shell finished the two-and-three
quarter mile course in 16 minutes 20 seconds, 18 seconds
ahead of the second-place Stanford team and 32 seconds
ahead of its nearest non-Stanford competitor. All four Stan
ford shells broke the team's recent practice records for the
two-and-three-quarter mile run.
The winning boat was manned by sophomore Tyler
Simonton, junior Scott Southwick and two seniors, co

captain John Latting and captain Andy Rebele. They we're
coxswained by junior Doug Wilner.
Just two weeks before, the same team, coxswained by
junior Jerry Montgomery, finished first in"The Head of the
Harbor" competition in Los Angeles. And two weeks before
that, Southwick and Latting captured first place ahead of
second-place Simonton and Rebele in varsity pair competi
tion at Oakland.
Southwick and Latting have recorded an undefeated fall
racing season this year — quite an improvement over men's
crew fall seasons of the past.
Junior Craig Bouck stroked the Stanford B entry, which
passed four shells over the two-and-three-quarter mile
course en route to an impressive second place finish. Soph
omores Brad Comerford and Andy Winden led their boats
to sixth and seventh place finishes.
The Stanford women's crew performed well in four
oared shells, although no opponents entered the regatta.
Women's Coach John Davis said the varsity women rowed
"very evenly" and recorded "good times."
Also gaining valuable racing experience Saturday without
the pressure of competition were the men's and women's
freshman/novice teams, which rowed very smoothly in
three eight-man boats and finished the regatta in unex
pectedly good times.
