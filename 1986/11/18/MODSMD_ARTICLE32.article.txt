# Women's golf 4th at USIU, McCarthy 5th individually
## 
### 
The first day of the U.S. Interna
tional University Golf Tournament
went pretty much as expected for the
Stanford women's golf team, as the
squad came in with a 312 in the first
round of the 54-hole event. That score
tied the Cardinal with host USIU for
fourth place after 18 rainy holes at the
Rancho Bernardo Golf Course in San
Diego.
Senior Kathleen McCarthy paced
Stanford with a 76, good for fifth in the
individual competition and four shots
behind the leaders, as Martina Koch of
Arizona, Margaret Piatt of Auburn and
Marianne Morris of South Carolina all
recorded two-under-par 71s. South
Carolina's Kelly Brannon was alone in
fourth with a 75
» "Kathleen played really well," Stan

ford Coach Tim Baldwin said, "the best
I've seen her play so far this year. She
missed about five short makeable
putts, or she could just have well shot a
71. She's back on the beam. Kathleen is
very competitive; I anticipate she will
finish in the top three."
Rounding out the rest of Stanford s
scoring were Kay Cornelius and
Adrienne Gilmartin, both just one shot
behind McCarthy at 77. Junior Trish
McGonigle finished with an 82 while
Stephanie Parel totalled an 83.
"The first three played some pretty
good golf," Baldwin said. "I'm quite
sure they will continue to play solidly.
I'm looking for Trish to play better;
she's capable of playing a lot better."
Not suprisingly. South Carolina led
the team scoring, after placing two gol

fers in the top four individually. The
Gamecocks came in with a 303 on the
day. Arizona was right behind with a
305, while Georgia and Auburn both
scored 311
Other teams competing include
Long Beach State (315), Alabama (315),
Washington (316), Brigham Young
(317), San Diego State (323). Washing
ton State (338), Wyoming (343),
Oregon State (34 7 ) and Illinois (348)
"It's a fairly good field," Baldwin
said. "Arizona is quite strong this year;
st) are Georgia and USIU. The South
east part of the country — South
Carolina. Georgia, Auburn. Alabama —
they're all sound golf teams. Arizona,
USIU and ourselves are solid golf
teams I'm looking for a very competi
tive finish to the tournament."
