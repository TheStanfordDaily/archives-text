Grappling with reality
Stanford senior Scott Wiggin was upset in a close contest Saturday by San Jose State's Matt Toves in the 150-
pound weight class."Toves is competitive, but not expected to beat Wiggin," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
said. "He's a consistent winner for San Jose State, but theoretically Wiggin is supposed to be better." Using a
strong defense, Toves neutralized Wiggin and won by a narrow 2-1 score.
