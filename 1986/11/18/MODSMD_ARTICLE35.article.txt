# Stanford backs rushing toward success
## Morris runs for touchdowns now, might run for office in the future 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
As thy end of the 1986 football season nears, the
end of a five-year college football career aproaches
for fullback Brian Morris.
According to Stanford running back Coach Jimmy
Walsh, the team will really miss Morris next year.
"Brian is a constant (on the team). It's hard to imag
ine others in his spot," said Walsh, who has worked
with Morris since 1983, when he first began coaching
at Stanford.
Morris came to Stanford in 1982 from Butte
Central High School in Butte, Mont., where he was a
star player for four years and carried the ball
sometimes 30 to 40 times in a game. He came to Stan
ford for several reasons. "It was a combination of the
high academic standards, the chance to play football
at the top level and the attraction of the climate,"
Morris said.
He redshirted his freshman year and went on to
start in the Oklahoma game as a sophomore. Morris
1983 season, however, was plagued by a sprained
ankle that kept him out of action for four weeks —
enough time for Brad Muster to establish himself as
the new starter.
"Brad is one of the best football players I've seen.
It's challenging to try to keep up with him, and
frustrating because he can always do it that much bet
ter," Morris said.
In the last three years, Morris feels he has learned

a lot from Muster. It's a thrill to play with him." Mor
ris said.
Walsh feels that Morris is also a top player. "Brian
is a very talented football player. He achieved more
than most expected."
Morris said his football skills have improved over
the last three years. "It's been building. My first year I
hadn't really played much, but then I got better and
better. This season has been a culmination of my
work over the last three years," said Morris, who
received honorable mention in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence for his performance in 1985.
As a fullback, Morris' strength is in blocking. He
also has a consistent running and catching game. "I
think my strongest aspect is my dependability. I can
get the job done. I block, run well, catch passes; I'm
becoming a complete player," Morris said.
Morris has filled his role on the team with "flying
colors," Walsh said, adding that the fullback "has the
qualities of a great running back."
Walsh mentioned Morris' key play in Saturday's
game against UCLA as an example of the running
back's skill. "That was so typically Brian. It was third
down and eight, and we needed a first down to win
the ball game. Brian wasn't going to be denied a first
down."
Morris broke three tackles to run 12 yards and gain
the first down. "Brian had no hesitation. It was an
emotion-backed run. It was the ball game — that iced
it," Walsh said.
Morris had been injured in the first half by a blow

to his head. "The doctors said I didn't have a concus
sion If I wanted to play I could. I wasn't injured, so I
played," Morris said.
After the play, Morris was excited but wanted to
remain calm and finish out the game. "It was my big
gest play It's something you dream about, what
you've been waiting to do. I was thrilled," he said.
In addition to playing football, Morris is a co
terminal major with plans to get an undergraduate
degree in Economics and a masters degree in Ap
plied Economics.
"It will be hard to leave. Stanford has been a great
experience for me. I've grown up, I've gotten a great
education, and football has been a good experience.
My fifth year here was an added bonus," Morris said.
After graduation, Morris is unsure of what he wants
to do. "That is a subject of much concern. I'm apply
ing to some law schools. I may take time off to work,"
Morris said.
Morris was an ASSI! senator last year and is inter
ested in politics, but has some doubts. "Politics has
come to have such an unsavory reputation in our so
ciety. However, I do see myself working in some
facet of the public sector," Morris said.
Walsh feels Morris will have the opportunity to
play football professionally. "Professional play may
injure or add to Brian's future career in politics. We
always tease him and say that he will be the next
gubernatorial or senatorial candidate," Walsh said.

looking forward to beating California.
"We plan to beat Cal very badly. I'm
really excited. We're 7-2. Chances like
this don't come along often," he said.
Morris has worked with Walsh in
recruiting. "He's a champion when it
comes to recruiting," said Walsh, add
ing that Morris is always willing to
help. "It's the little, intangible things
that make Brian such a great human
being. Unselfish' is the word that pops
up.

at the top level and the attraction of the climate,"
Morris said.
He redshirted his freshman year and went on to
start in the Oklahoma game as a sophomore. Morris
1983 season, however, was plagued by a sprained
ankle that kept him out of action for four weeks —
enough time for Brad Muster to establish himself as
the new starter.
"Brad is one of the best football players I've seen.
It's challenging to try to keep up with him, and
frustrating because he can always do it that much bet
ter," Morris said.
In the last three years, Morris feels he has learned

a lot from Muster. It's a thrill to play with him." Mor
ris said.
Walsh feels that Morris is also a top player. "Brian
is a very talented football player. He achieved more
than most expected."
Morris said his football skills have improved over
the last three years. "It's been building. My first year I
hadn't really played much, but then I got better and
better. This season has been a culmination of my
work over the last three years," said Morris, who
received honorable mention in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence for his performance in 1985.
As a fullback, Morris' strength is in blocking. He
also has a consistent running and catching game. "I
think my strongest aspect is my dependability. I can
get the job done. I block, run well, catch passes; I'm
becoming a complete player," Morris said.
Morris has filled his role on the team with "flying
colors," Walsh said, adding that the fullback "has the
qualities of a great running back."
Walsh mentioned Morris' key play in Saturday's
game against UCLA as an example of the running
back's skill. "That was so typically Brian. It was third
down and eight, and we needed a first down to win
the ball game. Brian wasn't going to be denied a first
down."
Morris broke three tackles to run 12 yards and gain
the first down. "Brian had no hesitation. It was an
emotion-backed run. It was the ball game — that iced
it," Walsh said.
Morris had been injured in the first half by a blow

to his head. "The doctors said I didn't have a concus
sion If I wanted to play I could. I wasn't injured, so I
played," Morris said.
After the play, Morris was excited but wanted to
remain calm and finish out the game. "It was my big
gest play It's something you dream about, what
you've been waiting to do. I was thrilled," he said.
In addition to playing football, Morris is a co
terminal major with plans to get an undergraduate
degree in Economics and a masters degree in Ap
plied Economics.
"It will be hard to leave. Stanford has been a great
experience for me. I've grown up, I've gotten a great
education, and football has been a good experience.
My fifth year here was an added bonus," Morris said.
After graduation, Morris is unsure of what he wants
to do. "That is a subject of much concern. I'm apply
ing to some law schools. I may take time off to work,"
Morris said.
Morris was an ASSI! senator last year and is inter
ested in politics, but has some doubts. "Politics has
come to have such an unsavory reputation in our so
ciety. However, I do see myself working in some
facet of the public sector," Morris said.
Walsh feels Morris will have the opportunity to
play football professionally. "Professional play may
injure or add to Brian's future career in politics. We
always tease him and say that he will be the next
gubernatorial or senatorial candidate," Walsh said.

this don't come along often," he said.
Morris has worked with Walsh in
recruiting. "He's a champion when it
comes to recruiting," said Walsh, add

up.
As thy end of the 1986 football season nears, the
end of a five-year college football career aproaches
for fullback Brian Morris.
According to Stanford running back Coach Jimmy
Walsh, the team will really miss Morris next year.
"Brian is a constant (on the team). It's hard to imag
ine others in his spot," said Walsh, who has worked
with Morris since 1983, when he first began coaching
at Stanford.
Morris came to Stanford in 1982 from Butte
Central High School in Butte, Mont., where he was a
star player for four years and carried the ball
sometimes 30 to 40 times in a game. He came to Stan
ford for several reasons. "It was a combination of the
high academic standards, the chance to play football
at the top level and the attraction of the climate,"
Morris said.
