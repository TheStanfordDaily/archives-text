# Modest Muster lets his play talk for him
## 
### MARK ANDEREGG 
"He's very similar to E.F. Hutton,"
said Stanford running back Coach
Jimmy Walsh, referring to fullback
Brad Muster. "When he speaks,
everybody listens." Speaking with
Muster, one quickly realizes that this is
no exaggeration, although one could
never get the star runner to imply any
thing of the son.
Indeed, Brad Muster is the most
humble 98 yards-per-game rusher ever
to roam the hallowed corridors of
Stanford University. Muster believes he
deserves very little of the credit for
Stanford's football success, as well as
for his high personal statistics.
"The offensive line deserves the
credit," said Muster, brushing away all
implications that he is the key to Stan
ford's offense. Success "all starts at the
line," he said.
But one need only look at Muster's
numbers on the year to realize that he
must be doing something right. Muster
has already run for 886 yards on 198
carries for a 4.5 yard-per-carry average.
He has tacked on a team-leading S3
receptions for another 519 yards.
Brad catches, runs, picks up blitzes,
decoys and blocks," said Walsh, who
has worked with Muster for three
years. "Without a doubt, he is the best
all-around running back in the United
States."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway voiced a
similar sentiment. "1 wouldn't trade
him for another back in the country
right now," he said.
The Stanford coaches are not the
only ones who recognize Muster's ex
cellence, as the junior's name has
begun to appear regularly on the list of
next year's Heisman Trophy candi

dates. But Muster has humbly
downplayed the significance of the
award.
"I think it's a great award, but its
value has deteriorated. People seem to
win and lose the award at the begin
ning of the season," he said.
Of course, any Heisman thoughts
can be dismissed if Muster chooses not
to return to college football next year.
Since Muster redshjtted his freshman
year, he has one year of athletic
eligibility left, but this is his fourth year
of school. As a result, there is some
question whether Muster will attempt
to turn pro at the conclusion of this
season.
Muster has declined to commit him
self to either scenario thus far. "1
haven't decided yet," he said. Muster
and his father discussed this issue at
the beginning of the season and chose
to "wait and see."
If the star running back leaves, it will
be a long time before anyone knows if
it was the right move for Brad Muster,
but everyone will immediately realize
that it was wrong for Stanford football,
both on and off the field.
Muster, although a quiet individual,
is a very inspirational component of
the Stanford Cardinal. According to El
way, Muster "cares about his
teammates and is very appreciative of
being a part of the football team."
"Brad is a better person than a foot
ball player," said Walsh "He is a very
inspirational runner."

Muster's regard for the rest of the
team becomes apparent as he talks
about his teammates. He called fellow
back Brian Morris a "really tough, un
selfish, outstanding player." Similarly
he referred to John Pave as a "great
team leader." The list goes on.
Despite Muster's humility,
teammates recognize what Muster has
done for them. According to Elway,
"Brad has real respect from the team."
Muster has bec'n a major factor in
carrying Stanford) to its best year in
more than a decade. With a great season
comes a bowl game, and with a bowl
game comes a desire to know where
the players want to be in December.
Brad Muster, at least, would rather not
even play in December.
"Of course we wanted the Rose
Bowl, but now that's out," he said. "I
just want to play on New Year's Day,
he continued, apparently echoing the
feelings of the entire team.
The Cardinal, however, will play
Clemson in the Gator Bowl, held in
Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 27, Althletic
Director Andy Geiger announced Sun
day. Although the Gator Bowl bid is
certain, Muster is not looking past the
next two games, including Saturday's
matchup against the last-place Califor
nia Bears.
"It's Big Game, stressed Muster.
"We can't take anything for granted.

Brad Muster had the longest run of his career, 74 yards, against UCLA two weeks ago. He also carried the ball 38
times to set a new school record for most rushes in a game. He had broken the same record the previous week against
Washington State, when his 37 carries broke the mark of 34 set by Ernie Nevers in the 1925 Rose Bowl against Notre
Dame.
"tough breaks" this year and is a better
team than its record indicates.
After California, Stanford meets
Arizona, which "just keeps improving,"
according to Muster. "We'll have to do
a little bit of everything to beat them,"
he said.
Muster, the football player, is clearly
a competitive, rallying force. But what
about Brad Muster, the person? He is
quick to point out that he does not do a
lot of socializing outside the football
stadium.

"I'm not much of a social bug,'
Muster said. "I spend a lot of time at
home when I'm not on the football
field.''
Muster enjoys spending time with
his family, with whom he is very close.
Although his father is busy coaching
high school football, his mother still
comes to most of the games. And
Muster always calls home after every
game.
Muster has three older brothers who
also coach high school football. "It was
competitive with four boys in the fam
ily," he said, "but there was never any
pressure to perform in football."

If the star running back leaves, it will
be a long time before anyone knows if
it was the right move for Brad Muster,
but everyone will immediately realize
that it was wrong for Stanford football,
both on and off the field.
Muster, although a quiet individual,
is a very inspirational component of
the Stanford Cardinal. According to El
way, Muster "cares about his
teammates and is very appreciative of
being a part of the football team."
"Brad is a better person than a foot
ball player," said Walsh "He is a very
inspirational runner."

Muster's regard for the rest of the
team becomes apparent as he talks
about his teammates. He called fellow
back Brian Morris a "really tough, un
selfish, outstanding player." Similarly
he referred to John Pave as a "great
team leader." The list goes on.
Despite Muster's humility,
teammates recognize what Muster has
done for them. According to Elway,
"Brad has real respect from the team."
Muster has bec'n a major factor in
carrying Stanford) to its best year in
more than a decade. With a great season
comes a bowl game, and with a bowl
game comes a desire to know where
the players want to be in December.
Brad Muster, at least, would rather not
even play in December.
"Of course we wanted the Rose
Bowl, but now that's out," he said. "I
just want to play on New Year's Day,
he continued, apparently echoing the
feelings of the entire team.
The Cardinal, however, will play
Clemson in the Gator Bowl, held in
Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 27, Althletic
Director Andy Geiger announced Sun
day. Although the Gator Bowl bid is
certain, Muster is not looking past the
next two games, including Saturday's
matchup against the last-place Califor
nia Bears.
"It's Big Game, stressed Muster.

Brad Muster had the longest run of his career, 74 yards, against UCLA two weeks ago. He also carried the ball 38
times to set a new school record for most rushes in a game. He had broken the same record the previous week against
Washington State, when his 37 carries broke the mark of 34 set by Ernie Nevers in the 1925 Rose Bowl against Notre
Dame.
"tough breaks" this year and is a better
team than its record indicates.
After California, Stanford meets
Arizona, which "just keeps improving,"
according to Muster. "We'll have to do
a little bit of everything to beat them,"
he said.
Muster, the football player, is clearly
a competitive, rallying force. But what
about Brad Muster, the person? He is
quick to point out that he does not do a
lot of socializing outside the football
stadium.

"I'm not much of a social bug,'
Muster said. "I spend a lot of time at
home when I'm not on the football
field.''
Muster enjoys spending time with
his family, with whom he is very close.
Although his father is busy coaching
high school football, his mother still
comes to most of the games. And
Muster always calls home after every
game.
Muster has three older brothers who
also coach high school football. "It was
competitive with four boys in the fam
ily," he said, "but there was never any
pressure to perform in football."
"He's very similar to E.F. Hutton,"
said Stanford running back Coach
Jimmy Walsh, referring to fullback
Brad Muster. "When he speaks,
everybody listens." Speaking with
Muster, one quickly realizes that this is
no exaggeration, although one could
never get the star runner to imply any
thing of the son.
Indeed, Brad Muster is the most
humble 98 yards-per-game rusher ever
to roam the hallowed corridors of
Stanford University. Muster believes he
deserves very little of the credit for
Stanford's football success, as well as
for his high personal statistics.
"The offensive line deserves the
credit," said Muster, brushing away all
implications that he is the key to Stan
ford's offense. Success "all starts at the
line," he said.
But one need only look at Muster's
numbers on the year to realize that he
must be doing something right. Muster
has already run for 886 yards on 198
carries for a 4.5 yard-per-carry average.
He has tacked on a team-leading S3
receptions for another 519 yards.
Brad catches, runs, picks up blitzes,
decoys and blocks," said Walsh, who
has worked with Muster for three
years. "Without a doubt, he is the best
all-around running back in the United
States."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway voiced a
similar sentiment. "1 wouldn't trade
him for another back in the country
right now," he said.
The Stanford coaches are not the
only ones who recognize Muster's ex
cellence, as the junior's name has
begun to appear regularly on the list of
next year's Heisman Trophy candi

dates. But Muster has humbly
downplayed the significance of the
award.
"I think it's a great award, but its
value has deteriorated. People seem to
win and lose the award at the begin
ning of the season," he said.
Of course, any Heisman thoughts
can be dismissed if Muster chooses not
to return to college football next year.
Since Muster redshjtted his freshman
year, he has one year of athletic
eligibility left, but this is his fourth year
of school. As a result, there is some
question whether Muster will attempt
to turn pro at the conclusion of this
season.
Muster has declined to commit him
self to either scenario thus far. "1
haven't decided yet," he said. Muster
