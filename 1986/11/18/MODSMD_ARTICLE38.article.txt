# Administrators uncertain about effects
## Stanford doubts value of Prop 65 
### FELICIA PAIK editorial staff 
Although California voters on Nov. 4 approved
Proposition 65 by an overwhelming majority, Univer
sity officials are skeptical of the fundamental worth of
the toxics measure and uncertain of its effects.
Proposition 65 prohibits the discharge of chemi
cals into drinking water and requires warning to the
public of toxic chemical exposures. Residents are
permitted to sue polluters if the government fails to
act against them.
"This measure was developed because there was a
feeling of frustration among the people of California.
Other laws have not been successful in dealing with
the toxic crises, and people are very concerned," said
Judy Tyler, the statewide field director for Proposi
tion 65.
Alain Decleve, University director of Health Safety,
said, "At the outset, the proposition is a good one,
but the writing is so vague ... (that) this could be
dangerous.
"Permissible levels for all chemicals can be found.
Now, we have to try and define for each chemical
what is permissible," he said.
The strength and impact of the resolution will not
be known until an incident arises, according to

Decleve.
"Proposition 65 will have to be put to the test,' he
said.
The vagueness of the initiative was intentional, ex
plained Tyler.
"This is an action-forcing initiative," she said, "The
measure will force standards and definitions to be
set. Previously, there had been no incentive for busi
nesses to implement standards."
The measure targets only known cancer-causing
chemicals and is specifically aimed at those compan
ies that knowingly discharge toxins into the water, ac
cording to Tyler.
"As the initiative stands right now, if the University
knowingly allows discharges into the water, we
would be subject to difficulties," said Andy Doty, Uni
versity director of Community Relations.
"The University feels it is in compliance with exist
ing regulations," he added.
University President Donald Kennedy opposed the
initiative and stated his reservations about the mea
sure in a letter to the Palo Alto City Council before
Election Day.
Kennedy said a major flaw with the initiative was
that it required dischargers of toxic or cancer
causing chemicals to show that the material posed
"no significant risk" over a lifetime of exposure and

that a released toxin would have "no observable ef
fect" at 1,000 times the level in question.
Doty echoed those reservations about the measure
and said, "It would be very difficult to prove no sig
nificant risk."
If companies leasing University land in Stanford
Industrial Park are found guilty of wrongdoing under
Proposition 65, those companies would be liable, ac
cording to Doty. Stanford, as landlord, could not be
named in a lawsuit, he said.
"They (the companies) rented the land in its virgin
state, so the tenant causing the pollution would pay
the consequences. The University is not involved,"
Doty said.
A spokesman for Hewlett-Packard, which leases
University land in the industrial park, said the com
pany was disappointed that the proposition passed.
"There are inherent problems with the initiative,
such as the ambiguity in regard to definitions," said
the spokesman, Kevin O'Connor.
"It is considerably vague. What is a discharge ?
How do you define detectable amount ?
Hewlett-Packard has not made any changes in
policy yet, according to O'Connor.
"But, now that it (the proposition) is a reality, we
are looking at our operations because we want to
comply," he said.
