A new undergraduate research pro
gram designed to further encourage
scholarship among black students and
to increase interaction between black
faculty and students opens today.
The Undergraduate Scholars Pro
gram (USP) offers students in all four
classes the opportunity for one-on-one
tutorial relationships and research
with black faculty members from
various departments.
USP is under the auspices of the Pro
gram for Afro-American Studies and
was conceived by AAAS Chairman Ken
nel I Jackson more than a year ago.
"The main reason for the program is
that many black students are not prop
erly nurtured (intellectually) here,"
Jackson said.
He said he hoped the program
would stimulate black students and
cause them to be "discovered."
Fourteen black faculty members —
about 75 percent of the black faculty
on campushave agreed to partici
pate in USP, according to Jackson, also
a professor of history. "It's really out
standing that they have come out in
such great numbers for this."
To demonstrate the volunteers' di

versity, Jackson noted professors
Sandra Drake in English, Sandra Ric
hards in drama, James Gibbs in anthro
pology and Clay Bates in material
sciences.
"I think probably the most impor
tant aspect in the mentor relationship
(that this program establishes) is a
sense of what was involved in living a
certain kind of life, what it means to be
a professor, teacher or scholar and
how you did it," Sandra Drake said in a
publicity video tape for the program.
"It is important to realize the core of
this program is one student to one pro
fessor," Jackson said.
USP affords the opportunity not only
to gain more knowledge, but also to
learn the best ways to acquire new
knowledge, and "that's something
that's not to easy to acquire on your
own," Physics Prof. Arthur Walker said
in the tape.
Fourteen students will be accepted
this quarter and will each receive a
stipend fi£ #125 to cover the costs
related to the research. Credit for the
program will come from the AAAS, said
Jackson, unless separate arrangements
with individual departments can be
made.
