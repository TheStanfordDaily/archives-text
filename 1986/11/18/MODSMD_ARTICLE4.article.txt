More than 40 animal rights activists yester
day demonstrated outside the Palo Alto
Municipal Court as jury selection began for
the trial of seven people arrested April 24 in
an animal research protest at Stanford.
All seven pleaded not guilty to charges of
trespassing and refusing to leave the
premises. If found guilty, they face a maxi
mum sentence of six months in jail or a
$1,000 fine.
Twelve others arrested at the same protest
pled guilty to the charges earlier and were
dismissed with their choice of a $3*>o fine, five
days volunteer work or 40 hours straight time
in jail.
Yesterday's demonstrators hope to gain

entry to the trial and observe the delibera
tions, according to Vicki Markham, spokes
man for In Defense of Animals.
"We're here as a show of support for our
people and to change some people s minds,''
she said.
The trial is open to the public, and District
Attorney Karyn Sinunu said the demonstrators
would be permitted to quietly observe its
progress.
The first witness will probably take the
stand tomorrow, according to Sinunu. She
said she planned to show a video tape of the
incident during the proceedings to prove that
the protestors are in fact guilty of the charges.
Among those who face trial is Jean Baird, a
clinical psychologist who said she has in
tensively studied the results of psychological
experiments on animals. She also was ar

rested Nov. 10 in another animal rights
protest at Stanford. She said that she will
plead not guilty to the charges stemming from
that arrest.
"I don't understand why we get arrested
and they (the experimenters) don't," Baird
said.
"Researchers have persuaded the American
people that their welfare depends on these
experiments. A small percentage of the re
search really is important, but most have no
effect on the general public. It is unnecessary
and painful to the animals," she said.
Last Monday, 21 people protesting the
"torture" and "vivisection" of animals in re
search laboratories were arrested by Stanford
Police in a demonstration in front of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's office.
