# Hazing addressed
## Speaker: Greeks must be responsible 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
Greek societies must take responsi
bility for their decisions on hazing,
said the mother of a 20-year-old under
graduate who died in a hazing incident
in 1978.
"Your image is at stake. Your future
is at stake.... You have a choice,"
Eileen Stevens told an audience of 30
at Kresge Auditorium yesterday after
noon.
Chuck Stevens, a sophomore at
Alfred University in New York, decided
to pledge the local fraternity Klan
Alpine in February 1978.
Stevens was taken from his dorm
and locked into the trunk of a car with
two other pledges. Each was given a
pint of bourbon, a bottle of wjne and a
six pack of beer, and was told he
would not be released from the trunk
until he had consumed everything.
Stevens died later that day from alco
hol poisoning and exposure to the
freezing weather. Two other pledges
were taken to the hospital in critical
condition and later recovered.
Although he occasionally drank a
few beers, he had never before abused

alcohol, according to his mother.
"I could not comprehend what had
made him drink enough alcohol to kill
himself.... He was not a drinker,"
Stevens said.
The local district attorney concluded
the incident was "isolated," and the
university temporarily disassociated it
self from the Klan Alpine Fraternity. No
one was held responsible, according to
Stevens.
Shortly afterwards, Stevens formed
the Committee Halting Useless College
Killings (CHUCK) to inform others of
hazing practices and to lobby for state
laws that prohibit hazing
Anti-hazing laws have been adopted
in 22 states and are pending in six
states, according to Stevens. Hazing is
illegal in California.
Stevens stressed that she is not anti-
Greek. but against hazing. "When I
think of fraternities and sororities, 1
think of trust, honor, friendship, broth
erhood and sisterhood. Hazing
opposes everything they stand for.
she said.
At least 39 students have been killed
and hundreds injured in hazing inci
