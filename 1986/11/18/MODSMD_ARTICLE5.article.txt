# Hazing addressed
## Speaker: Greeks must be responsible 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
Greek societies must take responsi
bility for their decisions on hazing,
said the mother of a 20-year-old under
graduate who died in a hazing incident
in 1978.
"Your image is at stake. Your future
is at stake.... You have a choice,"
Eileen Stevens told an audience of 30
at Kresge Auditorium yesterday after
noon.
Chuck Stevens, a sophomore at
Alfred University in New York, decided
to pledge the local fraternity Klan
Alpine in February 1978.
Stevens was taken from his dorm
and locked into the trunk of a car with
two other pledges. Each was given a
pint of bourbon, a bottle of wjne and a
six pack of beer, and was told he
would not be released from the trunk
until he had consumed everything.
Stevens died later that day from alco
hol poisoning and exposure to the
freezing weather. Two other pledges
were taken to the hospital in critical
condition and later recovered.
Although he occasionally drank a
few beers, he had never before abused

alcohol, according to his mother.
"I could not comprehend what had
made him drink enough alcohol to kill
himself.... He was not a drinker,"
Stevens said.
The local district attorney concluded
the incident was "isolated," and the
university temporarily disassociated it
self from the Klan Alpine Fraternity. No
one was held responsible, according to
Stevens.
Shortly afterwards, Stevens formed
the Committee Halting Useless College
Killings (CHUCK) to inform others of
hazing practices and to lobby for state
laws that prohibit hazing
Anti-hazing laws have been adopted
in 22 states and are pending in six
states, according to Stevens. Hazing is
illegal in California.
Stevens stressed that she is not anti-
Greek. but against hazing. "When I
think of fraternities and sororities, 1
think of trust, honor, friendship, broth
erhood and sisterhood. Hazing
opposes everything they stand for.

Eileen Stevens, mother of an Alfred University sophomore who died in a
hazing incident eight years ago, urges fraternities and sororities here to cease
hazing practices.
dents since 19 7 8, according to Stevens.
Hazing is not necessarily a problem
at Stanford, said Stevens, noting that
hazing violates University policy. "I'm
here because ... hazing is a concern
for everyone," she said.
Stevens, an alumnae initiate of the
Alpha Phi sorority, was invited to speak
at Stanford by the local Alpha Phi chap
ter.
Senior Monica Reimers, a pledge ed
ucator for the chapter, was hazed when
she joined the Alpha Phis in 1983. After
that year, the group decided to elimi
nate hazing, according to Reimers.
"1 was hazed ... not severely, but it
was enough to make me think. Seeing
it in other (Stanford) groups made me
think about it," she said.
"It is commonly thought that
sororities here don't haze. They do,"
said Reimers. Compared to fraternities
here, "sororities tend to haze less with
alcohol (and) more with blindfolding,
secrecy and peer pressure," she said.
Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity Presi
dent John Donald said there is
some discrepancy between the Univer
sity's and the fraternities' definitions of
hazing.
Disruption of sleep, late-night calis
thenics and similar activities might be
viewed by the University as hazing, ac
cording to Donald. "Those things
do go on, but 1 wouldn't call them
hazing. Those are activities the mem

bers do together," he said.
"I think students here are smart
enough to know how far to take some
thing," he said.
Donald, a junior, added: "As long
as I've been at this house, no one has
ever been forced to drink alcohol.
Kappa Alpha Fraternity President
Eric Jacobsen agreed that fraternities'
definition of hazing sometimes differs
from that of the University.
"If a pledge drinks a beer, it's not
hazing as long as he wants to do it. If
(pledges) don't want to drink and
somebody makes them drink, that
would definitely be hazing," he said.
"Hazing is when you get someone to
do something that they don't want to
do," he said.
Communication between actives
and pledges is the best way to
safeguard against hazing, according to
Jacobsen.
"The house needs to sit down and
talk about the pledge education pro
gram. And the house needs to decide il
there's hazing involved in it, and if
anyone thinks that there's hazing in
volved, then whatever (the activity) is,
it shouldn't be done," he said.
Stevens has spoken at ap
pproximately 300 college campuses in
the last eight years. After talking with
students, she says she has heard the
popular reasons given for hazing.
Some students argue that hazing is a
tradition, according to Stevens.
"Hazing is not a part of the founding
of any fraternity or sorority chapter. Ii
came along later," she said.
