# March off, Rally on
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
Fart of an annual football tradition will be mis
sing Friday night.
The Stanford faithful won't begin the Big Game
Rally with a stampede down Fisherman's Wharf
on their way to Aquatic Park. This year, the rally
will be confined to the park.
Unable to obtain the $1 million worth of
liability insurance required by the City of San
Francisco, Axe Committee Chairman Michael Tuc
hin yesterday was forced to cancel the parade
scheduled to proceed from Pier 1 to Aquatic Park.
According to Tuchin, a representative of the
San Francisco Police Department told the Axe
Committee that the police had to know immedi
ately if the march was to take place so that
preparations for the event could be made.
Tuchin told the police that there would be no
parade.
The Rally — led by the Band and featuring a
fireworks display — will still take place in San
Francisco's Aquatic Park.
Axe Committee members' parents involved in
the insurance industry tried to convince carriers
to provide the necessary coverage, but they were
unsuccessful, according to Tuchin.
The Axe Committee's insurance broker, Marsh
and McLennan, was also unable to find a company
willing to cover the march.
Terri Tanner of Marsh and McLennan was able
to find only one carrier willing to provide $1 mil
lion in coverage, according to Tuchin. That com
pany said its special events coverage costs a mini
mum of $10,000 and that coverage for the rally

would exceed that amount.
The Axe Committee refused the offer. Tuchin
said he thinks that the amount is "more than most
Stanford students would want to spend on a
march."
The committee originally budgeted $1,500 for
insurance and would have been willing to spend
$2,000 to $2,500, he said.
The committee does have a commitment from
one insurance company to provide the $500,000
of liability coverage required by Aquatic Park
for the Rally. The policy will be issued today, Tuc
hin said.
Attempts to convince San Francisco to reduce
the insurance requirement for the march from $1
million to $500,000 were unsuccessful.
The police department agreed to the reduction
on the condition that the Port Authority also
agree, according to Tuchin. The Port Authority
"refused to take $500,000," Tuchin said.
According to Tuchin, one official of the Port Au
thority said that if he made the decisions he
wouldn't permit the march even if the Axe Com
mittee could obtain $10 million of coverage.
Tuchin speculated that the increase in liability
lawsuits in California over the last few years has
caused insurance carriers to become extremely
cautious about providing coverage. "People are
so willing to sue, insurance companies are scared
to take a chance," he said.
Tuchin said he thinks students will be enthusi
astic about the Rally despite the absence of the
march. Some people will be disappointed, he
said, but others will be happy that they can see
and hear the Band for a longer time, rather than
having to follow far behind during the march.
