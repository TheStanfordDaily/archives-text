# Card hungry for Gator

### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It is a strange Big Game week. With the Bay
Area's biggest annual sporting event only four
days away, there is little talk about Saturday's con
test at California's Memorial Stadium.
The talk has turned to a bigger game for Stan

said. "Everyone here was yelling and screaming
when we found out. It's a traditional game, and it
should be fun."

left no one unhappy.
"Initially, I think we were all a little skeptical,"
linebacker David Wynian said. "We were thinking
maybe a New Year's Day game. Then it sank in â€”
the prestige, the national television and who
we're playing, and we're excited.
"If we're not playing on New Year's Day, this is
probably the best game. It's one of the original
