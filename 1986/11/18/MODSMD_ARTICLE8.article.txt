# Big '86 Game

### 
five or so. I'd put it in front of the Citrus. Maybe
even in front of the Cotton. The Cotton Bowl al
ways seems boring."
"To be honest with you, no one really knew
what would happen," center Andy Sinclair said.
"We were just hoping for a lot of upsets so we
might play on New Year's Day."
Quarterback John Pave was less optimistic. "I
didn't really expect a New Year's Day game. What
are there, six? We're not ranked in the top 12 yet,"
he said.
Stanford is ranked No. 16 again this week with
a 7-2 record. Clemson fell from No. 15 to No. 19
this week after a 17-17 tie against Maryland
dropped its record to 7-2-1.
"The Gator Bowl seems like the best
game not on New Year's Day," Sinclair
said. "Number one, it's on Dec. 27,
which is a Saturday, and the only cither
bowl competing with it is the Aloha,
which is at night. It's broadcast on na
tional television by CBS, and it's the
only thing on that day. On New Year's
Day you've got five games."
Stanford was possibly hurt in its
chances by not playing last week. The
game originally scheduled against
Arizona for last Saturday was moved to
Nov. 29 to allow the teams to play in
the Coca Cola Bowl in Tokyo, which
gave bowl scouts only nine games to
assess the Cardinal.
"I kind of wish the bids would have
waited to see if we finished better in
the Pac-10," Leiker said. "I think we
should be in the top 10 by the end of
the season."
The last time Stanford had a shot at a

bowl game was in 1982, when a highly
controversial five-lateral kickoff return
by Cal turned a 20-19 win and a 6-5
season with a Hall of Fame Bowl bid
into a 25-20 loss and a 5-6 season.
Wyman is the only player on this
year's team who played in that game.
"It seems like this caps off what I
planned on doing as a freshman," he
said. "I had a rude awakening after
that. It's a good accomplishment, for
the fifth-year seniors like me espe
cially."
The bowl bid caps a return to
respectability under Elway in just three
years. In 1983, Stanford was 1-10, and
Coach Paul Wiggin was let go. This
year's 7-2 mark could conceivably im
prove to 10-2 with wins over Cal,
Arizona andClemson.
"I came ih wttji Coach Elway's first
recruiting class," Sinclair said, "and
we've really had an impact. From a
team that finished 1-10, there's been

tremendous improvement.
"The one thing you have to under
stand is that college football starts with
recruiting. Playing a game crops
country means more show for the Uni
versity for recruiting and a chance for
East Coast people to see what we have.
Overall it's a great thing for the Univer
sity. I think we deserve it with our suc
cess."
That success should continue Satur
day against the Bears, who are one loss
away from becoming the first Cal team
in 105 years of football to lose 10
games in a season. But no one is taking
the Bears for granted, especially in the
final game for California Coach Joe
Kapp.
"Taking Cal for granted is the big
gest mistake we could make," F.lway
said. "That's why it's been Big Game.
Teams go in even, and it's a great

tell the players that no matter who we
play the next week, no matter what
bowl we're in, our Big Game is Califor
nia.''
"It's not just another game,'' Leiker
said. "It's like Coach Elway said at the
beginning of the season: We play 10
games, and then Big Game. We know
what Joe Kapp and Hardy Nickerson

have said, and we want to kick some
ass. They'll rise up, so we can't take
them lightly. They do have talented
players; they just haven't gotten it to
gether.
"My prediction: We need a shutout.
We've got a good defense, and we
haven't gotten one yet. We're going to
do it this week," Leiker said.

week and will not play Saturday. Fifth-year

may see action.

Stanford lias never played Clemson in the
93 years the University has fielded teams.
The only Atlantic Coast Conference team
Stanford has played is Duke, which
defeated Stanford, 9-3 in 1971 and lost 10-6
in No Pac-10 team has played in the
Gator Bowl in 42 years.
Cal is averaging only 93 yards per game
rushing, while allowing almost 200 yards
per game on the ground.
The statistics confirm Stanford's reputa
tion as a fast-starting team. The Cardinal has
outscored opponents in the first quarter 80-
3.
Preliminary research into flights from
San Francisco to Jacksonville found a TX A
fare of $389 round-trip as the lowest.
