### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
The University yesterday named the
recipients of this quarter's Dean's
Award for Service, shining a spotlight
on six students who "quietly and con
tinuously" have given their time and
energy to Stanford and the surround
ing community.
Seniors Lily Chang, Alison Cormack,
Lewie Ford and Lome Needle and
graduate students Christi Bergin and
Dale Griffin were selected for their
service contributions, which took a va
riety of forms and affected both stu
dents and outside community mem
bers.
Each is the type of student who gives
in ways that do not usually generate
the deserved applause, according to
Nadine O'Leary, administrative assis
tant to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
This quarter's winners will attend a
dinner tonight with Lyons and receive
a certificate and a medallion com
memorating the award. O'Leary said
University President Donald Kennedy
is expected to attend, she added.
A picture of each winner will be
posted in a trophy case in Old Union
Needle, who hopes to work in
public service after graduating, said he

did not expect the award. "It's a
surprise and a very pleasant one."
He was recognized in part for his
contributions to the education of East
Palo Alto children from lower-income
families. Needle, with the help of
others, established and directed the
East Palo Alto/Stanford Summer
Academy last year.
The academy sought to reduce the
number of students who drop out be
tween middle school and high school
by helping youngsters become more
motivated. The academy made use of
classes, recreational activities and field
trips toward this aim, said Needle, who
is majoring in public policy.
Needle pointed to an increase in
public service opportunities at Stanford.
In the past few years a lot of progress
has been made," he said, noting that
more publicity would further improve
the situation.
He was nominated for the award by
Public Service Specialist Patti Yukawa
of the Career Planning and Placement
Center and by Director Catherine Mil
ton and Megan Swezy of the Public Ser
vice Center.
The Dean's Office also nominated
Griffin for his contributions in the area
of education. After the death of a psy
chology professor, the department re
quired a restructuring and upgrading
of its statistics curriculum. Griffin
volunteered his services in effecting
these changes.
Griffin said he tried to bring faculty
and students together" by finding out
what the students' needs were.
A fourth-year graduate student in
psychology, Griffin said he was espe
cially pleased with the award because
"it was a nice gesture for the people in
the department to nominate me He
was nominated by Psychology Prof.
Mark Lepper.
Christi Bergin is the first married
graduate student with children to
receive the award.
Despite her academic obligatons,
Bergin organized outings and
workshops for homemakers — who
are often on tight budgets — in Escon

dido Village One workshop entitled,
"Money Trouble: How to Live on a
Shoestring," explored ways in which
graduate student families could bleed
a penny."
She also organized seminars featur
ing doctoral students who discussed
pertinent doctoral thesis findings re
garding parent education, including
the discipline of children.
Asked about her feelings on receiv
ing the award, Bergin said there are
others who have made significant con
tributions. "There are many people
around here who have done so much,"
she said.
Bergin said some University pro
grams dealing with graduate students
are very good, but she questioned the
focus of others. "A few things are won
derful, she said, noting that Residen
tial Education extends its program
n ng to graduate housing in Escon
dido Village. She criticized the Univer
sity, however, for what she called "a
neglect of support of families."

Much of the University's program
ming, like daycare centers here, is
aimed at a graduate student family in
which the wife works pan-time, she
said. Bergin said she would like to see
more of the University's efforts aimed
at a more traditional family in which
the wife, for the most part, remains at
home.
Residential Education Program Co
ordinator Jane Benson and Director of
Escondido Village Patricia Polhemus
nominated Bergin, who recently
received her doctoral degree in educa
tion psychology.
In nominating Ford, the Dean's Of

way he can

unteers cheerfully, warmly and com
petently through the most successful
Orientation to date — also the longest,
most academically strong and most
cross-culturally ambitious."
Cormack, a history and economics
major, was nominated by Alice Supton,
assistant dean of Residential Education,
and Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano.
Chang was cited for involving others
and keeping them interested and
excited about programs sponsored by

The University yesterday named the
recipients of this quarter's Dean's
Award for Service, shining a spotlight
on six students who "quietly and con
tinuously" have given their time and
energy to Stanford and the surround
ing community.
Seniors Lily Chang, Alison Cormack,
Lewie Ford and Lome Needle and
graduate students Christi Bergin and
Dale Griffin were selected for their
service contributions, which took a va
riety of forms and affected both stu
dents and outside community mem
bers.
Each is the type of student who gives
in ways that do not usually generate
the deserved applause, according to
Nadine O'Leary, administrative assis
tant to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
This quarter's winners will attend a
dinner tonight with Lyons and receive
a certificate and a medallion com
memorating the award. O'Leary said
University President Donald Kennedy
is expected to attend, she added.
A picture of each winner will be
posted in a trophy case in Old Union
Needle, who hopes to work in
public service after graduating, said he

did not expect the award. "It's a
surprise and a very pleasant one."
He was recognized in part for his
contributions to the education of East
Palo Alto children from lower-income
families. Needle, with the help of
others, established and directed the
East Palo Alto/Stanford Summer
Academy last year.
The academy sought to reduce the
number of students who drop out be
tween middle school and high school
by helping youngsters become more
motivated. The academy made use of
classes, recreational activities and field
trips toward this aim, said Needle, who
is majoring in public policy.
Needle pointed to an increase in
public service opportunities at Stanford.
In the past few years a lot of progress
has been made," he said, noting that
more publicity would further improve
the situation.
He was nominated for the award by
Public Service Specialist Patti Yukawa
of the Career Planning and Placement
Center and by Director Catherine Mil
ton and Megan Swezy of the Public Ser
vice Center.
The Dean's Office also nominated
Griffin for his contributions in the area
of education. After the death of a psy
chology professor, the department re
quired a restructuring and upgrading
of its statistics curriculum. Griffin
volunteered his services in effecting
these changes.
Griffin said he tried to bring faculty
and students together" by finding out
what the students' needs were.
A fourth-year graduate student in
psychology, Griffin said he was espe
cially pleased with the award because
"it was a nice gesture for the people in
the department to nominate me He
was nominated by Psychology Prof.
Mark Lepper.
Christi Bergin is the first married
graduate student with children to
receive the award.
Despite her academic obligatons,
Bergin organized outings and
workshops for homemakers — who
are often on tight budgets — in Escon

dido Village One workshop entitled,
"Money Trouble: How to Live on a
Shoestring," explored ways in which
graduate student families could bleed
a penny."
She also organized seminars featur
ing doctoral students who discussed
pertinent doctoral thesis findings re
garding parent education, including
the discipline of children.
Asked about her feelings on receiv
ing the award, Bergin said there are
others who have made significant con
tributions. "There are many people
around here who have done so much,"
she said.
Bergin said some University pro
grams dealing with graduate students
are very good, but she questioned the
focus of others. "A few things are won
derful, she said, noting that Residen
tial Education extends its program
n ng to graduate housing in Escon
dido Village. She criticized the Univer
sity, however, for what she called "a
neglect of support of families."

Much of the University's program
ming, like daycare centers here, is
aimed at a graduate student family in
which the wife works pan-time, she
said. Bergin said she would like to see
more of the University's efforts aimed
at a more traditional family in which
the wife, for the most part, remains at
home.
