The University yesterday named the
recipients of this quarter's Dean's
Award for Service, shining a spotlight
on six students who "quietly and con
tinuously" have given their time and
energy to Stanford and the surround
ing community.
Seniors Lily Chang, Alison Cormack,
Lewie Ford and Lome Needle and
graduate students Christi Bergin and
Dale Griffin were selected for their
