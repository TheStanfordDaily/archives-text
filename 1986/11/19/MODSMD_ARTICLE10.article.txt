# Widow: Hauptman did not kill Lindbergh baby
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
"My husband died an innocent man;
he did not kill the Lindbergh baby,"
said Anna Hauptmann, 88, whose hus
band Richard was executed in 1936 for
the kidnapping and murder of the in
fant son of Charles Lindbergh, the fa
mous aviator.
Charles Lindbergh II was abducted
from the Lindbergh home in rural New
Jersey on March 1, 1932. His father,
who made the first solo trans-Atlantic
flight, was considered a living legend,
and the boy's kidnapping caused a na
tional uproar.
Although a ransom of $50,000 was
paid, the baby boy was not returned.
An infant's body, decomposed beyond
recognition, was subsequently found.
Two years later, in 1934, a German
immigrant named Richard Hauptmann
was arrested and put on trial for the
crime.
Hauptmann's sensational trial was
billed as the "Trial of the Century" by
the press at the time. It was "the big
gest criminal trial in the history of the
United States," said Robert Bryan, Mrs.
Hauptmann's lawyer. But the trial,
Bryan said, was "a mockery of justice."
Bryan and Hauptmann spoke last night
at the Law School.
According to Bryan, previously con
fidential government documents —
recently obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act — con
clusively prove that Richard
Hauptmann was innocent.
Bryan cited recently obtained
evidence from FBI and New Jersey

State Police files, suppressed during
the trial, that he says exonerates Rich
ard Hauptmann.
Among the evidence Bryan said he
discovered was the following:
• Handwriting experts, who initially
ruled that Hauptmann did not write
the ransom notes involved in the kid
napping, were pressured by the police

to reverse their decision, which they
did. A modern, court-recognized hand
writing expert has confirmed that
Hauptmann did not write the notes.
• Fingerprints lifted from the ransom
notes and filed in police records did
not match those of Hauptmann. At the
trial, the prosecutor stated that no
usable fingerprints had been obtained

from the notes.
• A wood fragment allegedly taken
from the ladder used in the kidnap
ping was found to match a missing por
tion of the attic floor in Hauptmann's
apartment, thus incriminating him. Ac
cording to police records, however,
the missing floorboard was not discov
ered until a few days after New Jersey
State Police detectives rented the
Hauptmann's apartment, after Mrs.
Hauptmann had moved out. The floor
board had not been missing during
several previous police searches while
Mrs. Hauptmann still lived in the apart
ment.
• The doctor who met with the kidnap
per to negotiate the Lindbergh infant's
release is quoted in police records as
stating, when shown Hauptmann, "This
person doesn't even resemble the man
1 met with." The doctor later testified
to the contrary.
And this evidence is only a small
portion of that culled from over
200,000 pages of FBI and police
records concerning the case, Bryan
said.
Bryan also said that Hauptmann's
defense lawyer, Edward Reilly, was
hired by the Hearst newspaper chain,
which wanted the inside story on
Hauptmann's defense.
Over the course of the six week trial,
Reilly met with Hauptmann for a total
of only 45 minutes, Bryan said.
In addition, Reilly was a "known
drunkard" who was quoted in FBI files
as stating during a recess in the trial "I
hope the 5.0.8. (Hauptmann) burns!"
Bryan said.
The trial was "a smorgasbord of

fraud, said Bryan.
Hauptmann concurred with Bryan
"Every single witness against my hus
band lied, she said. I told the truth,
but nobody believed me,"
But Hauptmann never gave up hope
that her husband's name would be
cleared. In 1981, she met Bryan, who
was researching the case. He showed
her some of the documents he had un
covered, and the two decided to at
tempt to clear her husband's name.
"I know if the jury had known about
this (evidence), the verdict would not
have been what it was, and my Richard

could (have) come home," Haupt
mann said.
At noon today at San Francisco city
hall, the San Francisco Court of Histori
cal Review and Appeals w ill consider
the recently discovered evidence.
While the court has no legal authority,
a favorable decision could instigate a
re-opening of the case or perhaps
generate a pardon from the New Jersey
legislature.
Yesterday's talk was sponsored by
Women of Stanford Law, the National
Lawyers Guild and the Speakers
Bureau.

The "Trial of the Century" was a travesty of justice, Anne Hauptman said
last night. Hauptman, widow of the man convicted of killing the Lindbergh
baby in early 1932, said her husband was innocent of the crime.
