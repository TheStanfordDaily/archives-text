In the midst of the much-debated shutdown of the
Vienna campus, Stanford administrators still seem to
have done something right.
Last Thursday during the Faculty Senate meeting,
Provost James Rosse announced that a Washington, D.C.,
campus will open next fall quarter. Considering that
Stanford's motto is to provide a liberal education, this is
a wise decision.
While there are many opportunities to study diverse
cultures overseas, our homeland has been virtually
ignored. Aside from the strong efforts of Stanford-in-
Government to provide internships in the capital, stu
dents have received little opportunity through Stanford
to study the U.S. government on its main base.
The program will open with about 15 students and
will expand to 30. touring a 13-week term, these select
students will serve in internships with major policy
makers while also working under a faculty member and
tutor.
This increases resources and alternatives available to

Stanford students, as well as exposing them to a — yes —
different cultural background. It must be admitted that
the atmosphere at Stanford is somewhat more laidback
than the rest of the country, and often we forget that
there's a real world out there.
Stanford may produce knowledgeable students, but
this knowledge is superficial in that it hasn't been ap
plied to real-life situations. A Washington, D.C., campus,
especially one that offers such a close working environ
ment with government officials, will provide the oppor
tunity for students to apply their knowledge of the U.S.
government, while attaining a broader education in the
ways of the "other side" of the nation.
It is no secret that Stanford has always longed for Ivy
League standing. Yet always in the back of people's
minds is the belief that Stanford students are wild and
party-loving. With the introduction of a campus in our
nation's capital, Stanford will have the opportunity to
demonstrate that its students really do care about the af
fairs of the real world.
