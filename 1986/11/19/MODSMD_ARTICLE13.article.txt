Alternatives exist
in student housing
In his viewpoint on student housing
(Daily, Oct. 20), Doug Deckman
pointed out the problems that off
campus students face, but his solu
tions reflect a trend that is causing big
problems for America — the passive
reliance on bureaucratic institutions
to take care of us. Instead of con
centrating on what the University
administration owes them, students
ought to focus on what they can do to
help themselves. Students should
realize that they are quite capable of
coming up with alternatives to institu
tional housing and that their solutions
would probably be more attractive
than dormitories.
Many students around the country
have encountered housing shortages
and high rents or board rates, and
they have taken different routes to
living economically. At UC-Berkeley,
for example, 14 students started a
cooperative housing association in
1933 that now owns $16 million in
assets and houses 1,500 students. The
board of directors of this co-op corpo
ration consists of students elected by
each house. This student group has
built its own offices and apartment
complexes, hires its general manager
and offers jobs and scholarships to its
members. What they've done is equiv
alent to the students on the Row
putting their money together and
building one-third of Governor's
Corner.
But we don't need to look else
where to find student-built housing.
Most of the houses on the Row were
built by students organizing them
selves into chapters of the earliest
student housing organizations in the
country — the Greek system. The
success of the co-ops, self-ops and
fraternities at Stanford today shows
that the self-reliance spirit has not left
Stanford. It doesn't take administra
tion intervention to create houses; all
it takes are students willing to
cooperate.
Deckman was serious about the
housing shortage on campus, despite
his use of USC as a school for compar
ison. Few students would be willing to
pay for a hotel atmosphere with valet

parking. What a lot of students would
take seriously are practical, cheap and
self-determining solutions to the
challenge of housing.
When many people say "the Univer
sity," what they often actually mean is
the administration. But the University
also includes the faculty, students and
workers. Various parts of a university
work independently, but the main
goal of a university is to offer educa
tion to students. When one relies on
the administration to provide food
and housing, one may forget one's
abilities to be self-reliant. While for
many it's certainly most convenient to
live on campus and pay the adminis
tration to deal with providing food
and shelter, it's not the only, or most
practical, way to survive at Stanford.
Learning to live on one's own is
educating. Participating democratically
in determining where and how you
will live is perhaps just as valuable in
creating citizenry for a free society as
"more academic" studies. The oppor
tunity for students at Stanford to
realize their own abilities and tap into
the resources at Stanford and else
where that are dedicated to help
students create their own housing.

Daily should tell
about assaults
In its Nov. 12 editorial, "Help Stop
Assaults," The Stanford Daily noted
that three assaults against women had
occurred during the previous week.
The editorial made specific sugges
tions for how the University can
reduce the number of such incidents.
It concluded by saying that "men and
women on campus need to be aware
of the dangers that exist for women at
Stanford and to take the steps neces
sary to minimize that danger."
Why then was there no mention of
these assaults when they occurred?
Certainly three attacks in one week
deserves greater coverage than a
single editorial comment. If The Daily

truly believes in increasing awareness
of this issue, the editorial board has
been negligent in not reporting these
events as news.
We agree with the specific recom
mendations outlined in the editorial.
The University should fund and ex
pand the SURE escort service and the
Rape Education Project, as well as
improve campus lighting. Most impor
tant, student awareness needs to be
increased.
As Stanford's newspaper, The Daily
should actively promote awareness by
reporting this news.
The Stanford Women's Center
Collective
University should
give information
of sexual assaults
I just heard something that really
upset me. I want to tell you about it
because it's something that the entire
Stanford community should be aware
of. There have been at least three
sexual assaults on campus in the last
two weeks. Why did I have to hear
about this through word of mouth?
For the sake of women who enjoy
the outdoors, every danger that lies
there must be publicized, written
about, talked about, cried over. No
one benefits from silence. Yes, it
preserves the anonymity of the victim,
but it also preserves the invisibility of
the act, one that keeps occurring.
Couldn't the University distribute a
map with an X on each campus area
where any form of sexual assault has
taken place in the last, say, 10-20
years? This would be a valuable tool
for all members of the Stanford com
munity. Unfortunately, even a map
like this would portray an underes
timation of the problem; so many
incidents go unreported.
As an undergraduate at another
"safe" institution, Wesleyan in Con
necticut, I experienced the same
frustration with the lack of informa
tion concerning recent sexual assaults,
Please, we don't need to know any
personal details, but we do need to
know how to protect ourselves.
