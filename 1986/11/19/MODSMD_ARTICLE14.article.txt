# Protesters' views misrepresented
## 
### 
The Daily's substantial coverage of last Monday's
demonstration against experimental abuse of
animals at Stanford was very gratifying, despite a few
factual errors (for example, the statement that no stu
dent was arrested, when, in fact, an undergraduate
senior was).

RAYMOND GIRAUD

A much graver mistake, however, is the weight
given to administration spokesman Bob Beyers'
assertion that the protesters "want discontinuation of
all research.' This is utterly false. Nowhere is any
such conception articulated in the six-point program
presented weeks ago in a letter to President Kennedy
and distributed in profuse quantities at the demon
stration, but curiously absent from the Daily's ac
count. Surely, these six reasonable and moderate
demands, which were at the heart of Monday's event,
deserved some mention in the story.
The program proposed includes support for
federal funding for the development of alternate re
search techniques and calls for the admission of
biomedically trained professional animal rights rep
resentatives to observe what now goes on behind
closed d(X>rs. It would forbid the use of lost and
abandoned pets acquired from animal shelters, like
the dog Snowball, whose miserable fate came to light
only by accident. It seeks protection of students' right
of conscience not to be required to vivisect animals.
Only one point of the six has to do with the outright
prohibition of experiments — not all experimenta
tion or even all animal experimentation, but only
psychological experimentation on animals, the area
of animal use most generally discredited for its inap

plicability to human beings, for its egregious
repetitiveness and waste of funds sorely needed in
other areas like preventive medicine and patient
care, and, 1 might add, for its gratuitous violence and
callous disregard for pain and suffering.
In sum, if spokespersons for the University seek to
imply that the institution of any meaningful control
or oversight of researchers' absolute license to do
whatever they wish with animals, regardless of its ap
plicability or ethical justification, constitutes
"discontinuance of all research," they are propagat
ing a total misconception of what animal advocates
have been saying.
Equally troubling is the Daily's inaccurate account
of the notorious Snowball case, not just because of
the errors, but because of the credence which it gave
too easily to Stanford Animal Lab Director Thomas
Hamm's misrepresentation of the case. The article
says: "As Hamrn pointed out, that incident was not
linked to Stanford in any way." That simply is not
true, and the editorial stamp of validation it gives to
Hamm's allegation is unwarranted. (Incidentally,
Hamm and Elliot Katz, the president of In Defense of
Animals, both have the same degree, Doctor of
Veterinary Medicine, but only the Stanford adminis
trator, Hamm, is identified as "Dr." in the story.)
A few facts are imperative. The dog Snowball (so
named by the children of the Stockton family whose
pet he had been) was found lying in the ball of the
research wing of the Palo Alto Veterans Administra
tion Hospital by a Stanford medical student on March
24, 1983. I shall spare the Daily's readers the sordid
details of his inexcusably neglected and abused con
dition, amply documented by expert and impartial
medical examination and necropsy. Contrary to what
Hamm told the Daily reporter, the incident was
indeed verv intimatelv linked to Stanford research:

all rescarcn at the VA is directed by faculty from the
Stanford Medical Center. Snowball had been used in
a project of which Prof. D. Graig Miller of the Stan
ford medical faculty was the principal investigator.
Stanford was, at the time, wholly responsible for all
veterinary care at the VA. The veterinarian in charge
of the dog's physical welfare was Carolyn Reed, who
had a joint appointment with Stanford and the VA
Hospital. Stanford and the VA Hospital were both
named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by three Bay
Area humane societies in 1984. The suit was never
argued on its merits, because the judge decided that
the humane societies had no legal standing as
injured parties in the matter and consequently dis
missed the case. Thus, for Hamm to maintain that
there was no "link" with Stanford is disingenuous, to
put it mildly.
At Stanford, as in many other comparable institu
tions, administrators and even some faculty often see
as their prime responsibility the maximization of the
institution's material resources through grants and
donations and tend to let this obscure other consid
erations. This attitude is conspicuous in the area of
biomedical research. Such conduct is not based on
ethical values, but it is not "value-free" either. It is
rooted in a corporate ideology oriented toward
money and power.
Stanford interprets any challenge, however
moderate, to current modes of animal use in terms of
its impact on grant income. This is a perspective that
is simply not good enough if this university (in the
words of the Daily's editorial of last April 30 on
animal rights) "is to be considered one of the world's
most humane and ethical, as well as productive and
innovative research institutions."

pet he had been) was found lying in the ball of the
research wing of the Palo Alto Veterans Administra
tion Hospital by a Stanford medical student on March
24, 1983. I shall spare the Daily's readers the sordid
details of his inexcusably neglected and abused con
dition, amply documented by expert and impartial
medical examination and necropsy. Contrary to what
Hamm told the Daily reporter, the incident was
indeed verv intimatelv linked to Stanford research:

all rescarcn at the VA is directed by faculty from the
Stanford Medical Center. Snowball had been used in
a project of which Prof. D. Graig Miller of the Stan
ford medical faculty was the principal investigator.
Stanford was, at the time, wholly responsible for all
veterinary care at the VA. The veterinarian in charge
of the dog's physical welfare was Carolyn Reed, who
had a joint appointment with Stanford and the VA
Hospital. Stanford and the VA Hospital were both
named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by three Bay
Area humane societies in 1984. The suit was never
argued on its merits, because the judge decided that
the humane societies had no legal standing as
injured parties in the matter and consequently dis
missed the case. Thus, for Hamm to maintain that
there was no "link" with Stanford is disingenuous, to
put it mildly.
At Stanford, as in many other comparable institu
tions, administrators and even some faculty often see
as their prime responsibility the maximization of the
institution's material resources through grants and
donations and tend to let this obscure other consid
erations. This attitude is conspicuous in the area of
biomedical research. Such conduct is not based on
ethical values, but it is not "value-free" either. It is
rooted in a corporate ideology oriented toward
money and power.
Stanford interprets any challenge, however
moderate, to current modes of animal use in terms of
its impact on grant income. This is a perspective that
is simply not good enough if this university (in the
words of the Daily's editorial of last April 30 on
animal rights) "is to be considered one of the world's
most humane and ethical, as well as productive and
innovative research institutions."

The Daily's substantial coverage of last Monday's
demonstration against experimental abuse of
animals at Stanford was very gratifying, despite a few
factual errors (for example, the statement that no stu
dent was arrested, when, in fact, an undergraduate
senior was).

A much graver mistake, however, is the weight
given to administration spokesman Bob Beyers'
assertion that the protesters "want discontinuation of
all research.' This is utterly false. Nowhere is any
such conception articulated in the six-point program
presented weeks ago in a letter to President Kennedy
and distributed in profuse quantities at the demon
stration, but curiously absent from the Daily's ac
count. Surely, these six reasonable and moderate
demands, which were at the heart of Monday's event,
deserved some mention in the story.
The program proposed includes support for
federal funding for the development of alternate re
search techniques and calls for the admission of
biomedically trained professional animal rights rep
resentatives to observe what now goes on behind
closed d(X>rs. It would forbid the use of lost and
abandoned pets acquired from animal shelters, like
the dog Snowball, whose miserable fate came to light
only by accident. It seeks protection of students' right
of conscience not to be required to vivisect animals.
Only one point of the six has to do with the outright
prohibition of experiments — not all experimenta
tion or even all animal experimentation, but only
psychological experimentation on animals, the area
of animal use most generally discredited for its inap

plicability to human beings, for its egregious
repetitiveness and waste of funds sorely needed in
other areas like preventive medicine and patient
care, and, 1 might add, for its gratuitous violence and
callous disregard for pain and suffering.
In sum, if spokespersons for the University seek to
imply that the institution of any meaningful control
or oversight of researchers' absolute license to do
whatever they wish with animals, regardless of its ap
plicability or ethical justification, constitutes
"discontinuance of all research," they are propagat
ing a total misconception of what animal advocates
have been saying.
Equally troubling is the Daily's inaccurate account
of the notorious Snowball case, not just because of
the errors, but because of the credence which it gave
too easily to Stanford Animal Lab Director Thomas
Hamm's misrepresentation of the case. The article
says: "As Hamrn pointed out, that incident was not
linked to Stanford in any way." That simply is not
true, and the editorial stamp of validation it gives to
Hamm's allegation is unwarranted. (Incidentally,
Hamm and Elliot Katz, the president of In Defense of
Animals, both have the same degree, Doctor of
Veterinary Medicine, but only the Stanford adminis
trator, Hamm, is identified as "Dr." in the story.)
