What pisses you off?
The things that outrage us and how we deal with that
outrage are spiritual issues. I have spoken for toleration in
previous columns, and, I believe, some effort must be made
to understand the position of any group before you say what
they are doing is unequivocably wrong. But there comes a
time for each of us when we decide that what another per
son or group of people is doing is not right. It is then that
we must make a conscious moral choice either to accept
and ignore what is happening or to make an effort to bring
about a change.

Great strides were made this century by Mahatma Gandhi
and Martin Luther King Jr., who demonstrated in undeniably
concrete ways that change can be brought about without
recourse to violence or force of any kind other than that of
sheer determination. The achievements of these two great
men should remain alive in our thoughts because the non
violent resistanceor satyagraha formulated by Gandhi is, ul
timately, more effective at bringing two contrary forces to
agreement than any kind of coercion or force.
Central to an understanding of Gandhian philosophy is
some idea of what he meant by violence. Gandhi's defini
tion of violence was very broad, spreading far beyond the
physical violence usually associated with the term. Under
Gandhi the idea of violence was stretched to cover the
repression and discriminatory laws he fought against in
South Africa, and, indeed, the term came to cover anything
that he and his followers considered wrong.
Because they believed that they were essentially fighting
violence to begin with, the followers of Gandhi were able to
incite and then accept even physical violence against them
selves as a way to indicate to their opponents that a given sit
uation was violently unjust. At the various ashrams that he
founded throughout his lifetime, arguments as to whether a
given act was violent or not were a daily occurance.
If Gandhi's notion of violence was broad, then his notion
of nonviolence was correspondingly narrow. In fact, the
Gandhian ideal of nonviolence is one that is in no sense
practicable for anyone. As he noted, even as we walk about
we cannot help but kill a few ants and microscopic or
ganisms along the way. The idea of nonviolence is,
therefore, an ideal that people should strive for rather than
expect to obtain, because — and this is essential to the
whole structure of Gandhian philosophy — all creatures are
one, and so violence against one creature is violence against
everyone (Sound familiar? Buddha was Indian too.) Thus,
the whole idea of nonviolent activism or satyagraha is pred
icated on the idea that any violent coercion is, ultimately,
self-directed and therefore self-deafeating.
It's at this point in my understanding of Gandhian philos
ophy that I have a strong desire to throw up my hands, say
that this is all very well, but I happen to like my occasional
double-beef hamburger at Burger King no matter how
many cows have unwillingly given their lives for my repast.
There is, indeed, a strong temptation to accept the comfort
ing notion that Gandhi was admirable for formulating this
kind of ideal, but only saints like Gandhi himself could
honestly consider trying to live that way. Let's just pop the
movie into our VCRs occasionally to show our heartfelt ad
miration for the guy, and leave it at that, OK?
That kind of attitude does a great disservice to the spirit of

Gandhi and his philosophy in two important respects. First,
throughout his lifetime and even now there are people who
do try to live according to nonviolent norms. Gandhi did
not achieve his remarkable nonviolent triumphs in isola
tion, and, indeed, thousands of people participated in his
nonviolent campaigns. Second, Gandhi was a man who
made mistakes on occasion, and his philosophy was, in es
sence, an attempt to show how imperfect and ultimately vi
olent people can practicably reduce the violent nature of
their confrontations.
The doctrines of satyagraha are the guides by which non
violent protests have been carried out and are being carried
out today; moreover, they are quite applicable to more per
sonal confrontations. First, you must always attempt to un
derstand and identify with your opponent's position. It is
quite common in a satyagraha campaign for the protesters
to have initially a much better idea of what their opponents'
position is than the opponents themselves.
Next, you must have limited, specific objectives as the foci
of your campaigns; you must be willing to compromise on
issues tangential to those objectives, and you must not ex
pand your agenda when the campaigns are going well. Just
think about how specific the successful nonviolent cam
paigns led by King and other civil rights leaders were in
comparison to the more general and, ultimately, ineffectual
thrusts of militant black power groups in the latter half of
the '60S.
Finally, the tactics of satyagraha must, above all else, be
active and in accord with nonviolence as much as possible.
In a satyagraha campaign you must seek a balance between
the conflicting problem of knowing that the current state of
affairs must be corrected as soon as possible and not wan
ting to do anything so confrontational that it would com
pletely close the minds of your adversaries. To cause any
permanent kind of change in a given system you must con
vert the opposition to your side. Thus, Gandhi speaks of bat
tling antagonisms rather than antagonists, and cautions that
you never provoke or humiliate your opponent. In addition
though, you must carry on an active campaign against that
which you feel is wrong, for, ultimately, the strongest force
anyone must overcome to bring about some kind of change
in any situation personal or public is that of apathy and the
status quo.
I have said that it is important to believe, but, more than
that, it is important to fight against that which you believe is
wrong. The grand and glorious achievement of Gandhi and
those who followed in his wake all over the world in the
past half century was in demonstrating through the formula
tion and application of satyagraha that conflicts can be re
solved without recourse to manipulation or coercion, and,
in such a fashion, that the opposing parties can be, perhaps
grudgingly, reconciled. The essence of such a campaign
rests in having a complete and specific understanding of
what it is that you want and, conversely, what is the position
of the adversaries.
Finally, because the objective of satyagraha is to bring
about the lasting kind of change that only occurs when the
opposition has been converted rather than conquered,
methods based on nonviolent ideals must be employed. I
do not believe that even Gandhi claimed that satyagraha is
appropriate for every instance of conflict, nor are satyagraha
campaigns always successful. No, the important fact to be
gleaned from the concept of sataygraha is that the power
trips that most of us get into in order to have our way in a
given situation are not always necessary or desirable, and
that there are methods of conflict resolution which do not
involve confrontation and intimidation.
