### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
A meeting yesterday between Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger and Band
representatives resulted in "progress,
but no decision" on whether the Band
will be allowed to play on the field at
Big Game Saturday, according to
Geiger.
The meeting came a day after the
Band submitted to Geiger a working
draft of guidelines for Band conduct
and performances in the future. Geiger
said, however, that the Band does not
have to finalize the document in ordet"
to play at Big Game.
According to Geiger, there needs to
be an "agreement in principle" regard
ing proper band conduct before the
Band can be reinstated. "It doesn't mat
ter if it is a document or a handshake,"
Geiger said.
"There are fundamentals I want to
see (established) before Big Game"
and before the band plays on the field,
Geiger said.
Band Manager Jeff Stevens, who
along with Asst. Manager Todd Oleson
attended the meeting yesterday, said
the Band "still has to work out some
details (of the charter) with Geiger."
Geiger said that if he and the Band
can reach hp
tic the Band will play at Big Game.
Whether the Band plays, however, is
up to the Band itself, Geiger added.
The Band "has just a little more to

go. They're working hard on it,"
Geiger said.
Geiger will meet again with Stevens
and Oleson tommorow, or maybe
even by telephone tonight, Geiger
said.
On Nov. 5, Geiger suspended the
liajiU-fcoin uavtiling.lv the UCLA game
and from playing on the field during
Big Game against UC-Berkeley. Last
week, he said the suspension might be
lifted for Big Game, provided the Band

developed a suitable means for self
discipline.
Although he said he hopes to be
able to reach a decision soon, Geiger
said there is "no time limit" for resolv
ing the issue.
"I'd be working with them Saturday
morning if that's what it takes But )
don't think it's going to be a problem,"
he said.
While a final version of Band
guidelines does not have to be finished

before Big Game, Geiger said he wants
such a document in the near future. Ac
cording to Geiger, the Band needs to
establish a long-term code of its rela
tion to the rest of the University.
The draft document is in two parts:
the actual charter for the Band which
wiil Iks printed each year in the Band
handbook and which will be empha
sized each fall; and specific applica
tions of the charter to the current situa
tion.
