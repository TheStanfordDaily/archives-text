## Ruth-lessly pursuing the truth 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
Dr. Ruth, wellspring of sexual advice for mil
lions, remains an enigma when it comes to her
own sexual preferences. She is always telling us,
"Have good sex." What we want to know is — in
reference to her own sexual experience — how
good is it?
— 2 SXL DV8s

Well now, don't we have anything better to do
than to pry into people's sex lives?
I received this question just before going on as
signment to Dr. Ruth's speech and didn't know
whether or not I was up to the task. I went ahead
though; not so much because I thought you
deserved an answer, but because I wanted to ob
serve how this woman to whom many confide just
such information would handle herself.
I nervously approached the good doctor after
her lecture.
"Dr. Ruth, you preach about the virtues of good

sex. I've been asked to ask you, with reference to
your own experience, is it good for you?"
"Do you mean in my own personal life?" Dr.
Ruth asked.
"Yes," I stammered.
"You tell them it's none of their business," Dr.
Ruth answered curtly in her distinctive accent. "Do
you have any other questions?"
I don't. Do you?
Dear Bug Me,
Does the Stanford Axe still exist? Is it decorating
the dorm room of some lucky Axe Committee
member? I'm tired of the silly poster that hangs in
its place in the glass case in Tresidder.
— Oski Mayer
The axe was removed due to security reasons,"
said Axe Committee Chairman Michael Tuchin.
He said that, while the glass case in Tresidder is
quite secure, he had received several threats from
Berserkeley partisans that they were going to steal
(or maybe steel) the axe. It would be very expen
sive to replace the first two layers of glass in the
case if someone attempted to break in, so Tuchin
said he had the axe removed.
"We never reveal where the axe is, (but it) is
very secure," he said.
Tuchin assured me that the axe was not under
his bed and that it is not being hoarded. The axe
has been making appearances at various events.
While we're on the subject — where is Oski,
Cal's stuffed big bear of Big Game? I've been
unable to prove the veracity of a rumor that a Cal
frat has stolen Oski and will display him Saturday
claiming that he was liberated from Cardinal kid
nappers.
Tuchin hadn't heard this rumor but said that he
was not surprised with "Cal mentality what it is."
Until Saturday, I guess all we can do is guess
about that dirty golden bear's whereabouts and
hope that the Athletic Department's Geiger
counter doesn't register the Band's show as explo
sive and allows the LSJUMB to play on the field.

Dear Bug Me,
Recently, I was pondering why engineers, and
especially electrical engineers, are often referred to
as "geeks." Upon checking the mighty Webster's, I
found that a geek was a circus wild man whose act
usually included biting the head off a chicken. Not
knowing many electrical engineers who fit this des
cription, I thought perhaps you could shed some
etymological light on the subject.
— A socially concerned EE
Yes, geeks were once the chicken equivalent of
Ozzie Osbourne. However, for the usage under
consideration, I found some information in the
Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English.
Geek is actually a word of Australian origin. In
this context it means "a long look." My source sug
gests that it would be used — perhaps by even
Crocodile Dundee — in the sentence "'Gis' (or
give us) a geek at that book." G'day, mate.
Alternatively, it derives from the German
"gucken" — to peep or peek, and was possibly in
fluenced by the dialectical Cornish word "geek" —
to look intently at. The assumption here is that
geeks stare at books for a long time.
If you're an engineer and offended by this evolu
tion of language, read the next question.
Dear Bug Me,
This past summer there were ducks in Terrnan
Pond. Where did they come from? Where did they
go?
— A Terman-al denizen
Mary Cloutier, administrative assistant to the
dean of the engineering school, said that "this hap
pens every year."
Apparently, a duck has a nest near Lake Lagunita.
Once the ducklings are born, they need to be
taught to swim. Lagunita is dry in the summer, so
the ducklings are led to Terman Pond by their
mother to learn these life skills, Cloutier suggests.
Unfortunately, once the ducks get into the pond
they can't get out, so some civil engineers built a
ramp for them this summer.

Geek is actually a word of Australian origin. In
this context it means "a long look." My source sug
gests that it would be used — perhaps by even
Crocodile Dundee — in the sentence "'Gis' (or
give us) a geek at that book." G'day, mate.
Alternatively, it derives from the German
"gucken" — to peep or peek, and was possibly in
fluenced by the dialectical Cornish word "geek" —
to look intently at. The assumption here is that
geeks stare at books for a long time.
If you're an engineer and offended by this evolu
tion of language, read the next question.
Dear Bug Me,
This past summer there were ducks in Terrnan
Pond. Where did they come from? Where did they
go?
— A Terman-al denizen
Mary Cloutier, administrative assistant to the
dean of the engineering school, said that "this hap
pens every year."
Apparently, a duck has a nest near Lake Lagunita.
Once the ducklings are born, they need to be
taught to swim. Lagunita is dry in the summer, so
the ducklings are led to Terman Pond by their
mother to learn these life skills, Cloutier suggests.
Unfortunately, once the ducks get into the pond
they can't get out, so some civil engineers built a
ramp for them this summer.

Dear Bug Me,
Dr. Ruth, wellspring of sexual advice for mil
lions, remains an enigma when it comes to her
own sexual preferences. She is always telling us,
"Have good sex." What we want to know is — in
reference to her own sexual experience — how
good is it?
— 2 SXL DV8s

Well now, don't we have anything better to do
than to pry into people's sex lives?
I received this question just before going on as
signment to Dr. Ruth's speech and didn't know
whether or not I was up to the task. I went ahead
though; not so much because I thought you
deserved an answer, but because I wanted to ob
serve how this woman to whom many confide just
such information would handle herself.
I nervously approached the good doctor after
her lecture.
"Dr. Ruth, you preach about the virtues of good

sex. I've been asked to ask you, with reference to
your own experience, is it good for you?"
"Do you mean in my own personal life?" Dr.
Ruth asked.
"Yes," I stammered.
"You tell them it's none of their business," Dr.
Ruth answered curtly in her distinctive accent. "Do
you have any other questions?"
I don't. Do you?
Dear Bug Me,
Does the Stanford Axe still exist? Is it decorating
the dorm room of some lucky Axe Committee
member? I'm tired of the silly poster that hangs in
its place in the glass case in Tresidder.
— Oski Mayer
The axe was removed due to security reasons,"
said Axe Committee Chairman Michael Tuchin.
He said that, while the glass case in Tresidder is
quite secure, he had received several threats from
Berserkeley partisans that they were going to steal
(or maybe steel) the axe. It would be very expen
sive to replace the first two layers of glass in the
case if someone attempted to break in, so Tuchin
said he had the axe removed.
"We never reveal where the axe is, (but it) is
very secure," he said.
Tuchin assured me that the axe was not under
his bed and that it is not being hoarded. The axe
has been making appearances at various events.
While we're on the subject — where is Oski,
Cal's stuffed big bear of Big Game? I've been
unable to prove the veracity of a rumor that a Cal
frat has stolen Oski and will display him Saturday
claiming that he was liberated from Cardinal kid
nappers.
Tuchin hadn't heard this rumor but said that he
was not surprised with "Cal mentality what it is."
Until Saturday, I guess all we can do is guess
about that dirty golden bear's whereabouts and
hope that the Athletic Department's Geiger
counter doesn't register the Band's show as explo
sive and allows the LSJUMB to play on the field.

Dear Bug Me,
Recently, I was pondering why engineers, and
especially electrical engineers, are often referred to
as "geeks." Upon checking the mighty Webster's, I
found that a geek was a circus wild man whose act
usually included biting the head off a chicken. Not
knowing many electrical engineers who fit this des
cription, I thought perhaps you could shed some
etymological light on the subject.
— A socially concerned EE
Yes, geeks were once the chicken equivalent of
Ozzie Osbourne. However, for the usage under
consideration, I found some information in the
Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English.
