# No room for the memories
## Reagan library means research 
### NICHOLAS J.R. ANDERSON 
Though Stanford University has one
of the largest library systems in the
country, its impressive access to ar
chives will soon be greatly increased
by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary.
Although the library will be open to
the public, undergraduate and
graduate students are expected to con
situte more than half of the library's
users â€” judging from the experiences
of other presidential libraries on
campuses, such as the Gerald Ford
Presidential Library at the University of
Michigan. Another quarter of its users
will be faculty members working on
books and articles.
In fact, one of the unique aspects of
a presidential library is that it can inde
pendently support book-length studies
on numerous subjects such as eco
nomics, foreign affiars, health and
welfare, and the environment.
The library will be "a place where
faculty bring seminar groups to show
how research is carried out with pri
mary sources," says Charles Palm, a
member of the board of the Ronald
Reagan Library Foundation, the private
organization that is overseeing the li
brary's development.
To emphasize the fact that the
Reagan Library is a research library,
less than one-tenth of the floor space
will be used for presidential exhibits,
according to the library plans. More
than half the library will be an under
ground archive storage area, where the
seven-and-a-half-mile-thick stack of
papers Reagan amasses in his eight
years of office will reside. That stack is
25 percent more paper than the
Hoover library has collected in 68
years.
Even the library exhibits will be edu

cational rather than entertaining in na
ture. "One case might present how the
policy for SDI came about," says Palm,
who is also head librarian and archivist
at the Hoover Institution.
While the library will own all the
memorabilia associated with the presi
dent, tourist artifacts like the presi
dent's limousines and gifts to the presi
dent and first lady will be on indefinite
loan to Eureka College in Illinois,
where Reagan was a student.
The library will house all the papers
that sat on Reagan's desk, as well as
many of the reports and briefings asso
ciated with decision-making in the ex
ecutive branch. These materials will in
clude records from Cabinet members
and others associated with the presi
dent, videotapes from every Cabinet
and sub-Cabinet meeting and appear
ances on television by the president
and his advisers.
Access to the Reagan Library will be
facilitated by the Socrates network,
which will link the library with rest of
the University's libraries.
The library will also be linked to the
National Archives of the United States
and seven of the eight other presiden
tial libraries. This opportunity is of
fered only to presidential libraries.
The National Archives maintains all
the permanent records of the United
States, including a thorough collection
of documents from American history,
such as the Declaration of Indepen
dence and the Constitution.
While students and faculty will not
be able to borrow important docu
ments such as those, other federal
records will be available through this
new "inter-library loan" arrangement.
The library will be located west of
Junipero Serra Boulevard in a small
valley between two hills overlooking
Lake Lagunita. The building will be in
the tradition of Stanford's California
mission-style stone quadrangle with
cloistered walkways and red-tiled
roofs.
The Ronald Reagan Library Founda
tion will raise the $30 million needed
to build the library, saving Stanford
that expense.
