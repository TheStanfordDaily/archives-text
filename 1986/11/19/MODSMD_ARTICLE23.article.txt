## 'Moonlight' examines modern family problems 
### JULIET JOHNSON 
Controversial issues were riddled throughout the pro
duction of "Moonlight Serenade,'' performed last weekend
at the Elliot Program Center.
Written by local author Toni Press, "Moonlight Serenade
centers around an ordinary Tucson, Ariz., family and its hid
den problems. The family has gathered at Grandma's house
to celebrate Faster Sunday, and one by one tensions that
have been present in the family for years are revealed and
dealt with.
The first concerns the- missing grandson, Tommy, who is
dying of AIDS. The family members seem to accept
Tommy's sexual preference and are outraged that mor.. re
search wasn't done on the disease at the outset, when it was
prevalent only among gays.
As the day goes on, each family member is forced to face
his or her own problems.
Roseann (Lindi Bauman), Grandma's middle-aged
daughter, has fallen apart since her divorce. Grandma her
self (Gina Barrett) cries for the first time in a generation
when Tommy dies. Granddaughter Laura (Toni Press),
comes to grips with her father's incestuous behavior and, in
a moving scene, confronts him. Another granddaughter,
Jane (Virginia Shepley), convinces herself that it's all right to
be divorced and have a lover.
Even the late Grandpa (Greg Tours) comes back as a
ghost, to visit his grandchildren. Laura berates him for
having been a criminal and an adulterer during his life, and
so he too becomes entwined in the family drama. The only
character seemingly without problems is the young
musician Baker (Rudy Lohmeyer), Laura's confidante, who
adds a much-needed element of calmness and sanity to the
atmosphere.
At first, the acting appeared forced, but as the play
progressed and emotional tensions grew, the performers
rose to the occasion. Greg Tours portrayed Grandpa as viva
cious and opinionated, creating an extremely charismatic
character and adding humor to the otherwise serious plot.
Press and Lohmeyer were a believable couple as Laura

and Baker. They were especially impressive in the scene
where Laura finally tells of her father's incest. Laura s emo
tions and Baker's resulting feelings of anger and impotence
came through well; the audience shared the pain.
The illusion of reality was an outstanding aspect of
"Moonlight Serenade.' The performers chosen by director
Janet Heimlich were not 20-year-olds trying to act old or
overweight. Grandpa and Grandma were played by actual
senior citizens, and the weight-conscious Roseann was no
willowy model. Just the appearance of these people on the
stage made the play more believable, and they were un
doubtedly able to interpret their parts better, since they
knew what it was like to be in their character's situation.
This represented a refreshing change from most other Stan
ford productions.
The writing sensitively treated the topics of AIDS, incest
and unspoken family tensions, never patronizing or
moralizing but simply showing how regular people deal
with incredibly stressful experiences in their lives.
Unfortunately, Press tries to cover so many important and
controversial family dilemmas that "Moonlight Serenade"
sometimes took on the appearance of a soap opera. If she
had chosen to approach just one or two of the issues pre
sented in the play, it might have had more continuity and
certainly more depth.
In one particularly awkward moment, Laura has just
finished revealing her father's incest when Grandma walks
into the room and announces that Tommy has just died. The
poignancy of the previous scene was shattered, and the an
nouncement seemed melodramatic instead of devastating
"Moonlight Serenade" had its excellent moments, but in
attempting to deal with too much at once it often stretched
the audience's imagination, as it was required to assimilate
the many emotions tied to each issue. Since Press shows
such a facility with her characters, 1 have no doubt that a
play in which she developed a single issue and its repercus
sions would be truly outstanding. Her characters don't have
all the answers, and they sometimes say inappropriate
things, just like we all do. Her next effort should be a pro
duction to look forward to.

things, just like we all do. Her next effort should be a pro
duction to look forward to.
