# Contemporary dance from the Washington Ballet
## 
### SUSAN CHUNG 
The Washington Ballet — from the nation's capital — per
formed a selection of primarily contemporary works last
Tuesday evening in Memorial Auditorium.
Three of the five pieces performed were choreographed
by the company's associate director Goh Choo-San, which
gave the Stanford audience a taste of the internationally ac
claimed artist's award-winning style of incorporating classi
cal technique with a decidedly more modern accent.

The performance came to
gether with the final piece.

Beginning with a less than dazzling performance of Goh's
"Double Contrasts," the evening finally came together for
the dancers and the audience with the last piece, Goh's un
usual and compelling "Unknown Territory."
The curtain first opened to a subtly lit stage of frozen fig
ures set against a backdrop suggestive of a shimmering
night sky. The theme of duality apparent in the title "Double
Contrasts" was developed initially with the music, Poulenc's
"Concerto in D Minor for Two Pianos and Orchestra," and
with the visual contrast of the glittering dancers, dressed en
tirely in either white or black.
However, the differentiation between the movement of
the black-costumed dancers versus the white didn't follow
clearly throughout the piece. The subdued black pas de
deux offered some opposition to the bright, almost flir
tatious white pas de deux, but soon the neat model of ten
sion gave way to an erratic, swirling galaxy and some near
collisions. Interspersed with unexpected, quirky motifs
taken from a modern, jazz-based vocabulary, the piece suf
fered for its lack of precision.

Three short pieces followed the first intermission. Lar
Lubovitch's "The Time Before the Time After (After the
Time Before)" began with two entwined bodies standing
center-stage, bathed in a red light. It was a highly evocative
piece due to its strong visual imagery; the dancers played an
emotional game of chase characterized by a succession of
acts in which they were indifferent, indignant, mocking and
brutal with each other. At one point they separate and indi
vidually teeter along imaginary tightropes, only to return to
more of the same (of "the time before").
"Momentum Pas De Deux" was precisely what its title
suggests. Exquisitely danced by Andrea Dickinson and Mi
chael Bjerknes, it managed to create a fleeting aura of
serenity and fragility. Opening with several measures of
silence and relative stillness, this dance truly blossomed.
The wonderful fluidity of movement was punctuated by a
sense of breath which came with each sustained release
from a balance onpointe, a dramatic dive or an aerial whirl.
However, a single movement, reminiscent of a gingerly
sensitive anemone, was the highlight of this piece. A
blink, and it would have been missed.
Out of character with the rest of the program was the in
clusion of the pas de deux from "La Fille Mai Gardee." It
misfired as the token pleaser for the crowd's balletomanes.
Fortunately, the last piece, "Unknown Territory," was
well-received. Set to a commissioned "new-age" musical
score by Jim Jacobsen, the piece was eclectic in other ways
as well. The amalgamation of influences, ranging from
primitive tribal rites to Oriental religious gestures to
Chinese opera styles, was certainly bewildering. But the
piece was quite interesting to watch, especially for its
thoroughly new applications of age-old movements.
The same assessment holds for the performance as a
whole. The Washington Ballet set out with the intent of con
centrating on contemporary rather than traditional ballet;
though not technically brilliant, they did this quite well, of
fering the audience a program of works not often per
formed.
