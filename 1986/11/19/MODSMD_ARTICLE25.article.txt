# Rock group Poison discusses heavy metal career strategies
## 
### LIZ GOODMAN 
//' ever there were a musical genre
that lived in a cultural ghetto, its heavy
metal. Despised by rock' critics, fun
damentalists and the wives of influen
tial U.S. congressmen, heavy metal is
commonly regarded as music for
pimply adolescents, few people will
own up to liking it Well, we say that if
it upsets so many people, there must be
some good to it. Or if not something
good, at least something interesting
The following inteivivw with the mem
bers of the up-and-coming hard rock
group Poison provides a refreshingly,
uh, frank perspective on heavy metal
It could easily be a layout for a cos
metic ad in "Vogue or "Glamour, but
instead of being your basic run-of -the
mill models, the four pretty faces
featured on the front of the debut al
bum from the rock band Poison are in
fact the band's members. But with their
solid album, a video on MTV and an
energetic live show that will soon be
Ratt's opening act, these guys are out to
prove that they're more than just pretty
faces.
"We are definitely an image
conscious band, guitarist C.C. DeVille
told The Daily before the group s
recent performance at the Stone. "But I
hate to separate the image from the
music; it's one big thing
As for Poison's heavy use of make
up, DeVille rationalizes, Women wear
make-up to enhance how good they
look There have been so many times
where I've went to bed with a beautiful
woman and woke up with this ugly
thing. There d be times when I
debated about just biting my arm off as
opposed to waking her up just to move
it The whole (make-up) image is be
cause it lix)ks cool. It's not because
we're making any kind of a sex stand
— that we're girls or anything
It seems that DeVille and the group's
other members, lead vocalist Bret Mic
haels, drummer Rikki Rockett and bas

sist Bobby Dall, have spent some time
developing their image — a Poison
formula as it were — deliberately
taking into account all aspects of per
forming and entertaining, music and
image, in hopes of becoming success
ful.
The first signs of this strategy were
apparent when the band decided to
relocate from their Pennsylvania and
Brooklyn origins in order to move to
the center of the music industry, Los
Angeles.
"We didn't move to enjoy the sun,"
stresses DeVille. "We went for our
careers, we went to try and make it.
Whenever you think about how you're
going to do something for your career,
you have to try and not worry about
whether people can see your tan lines
or not."
The move seems to have paid off as
their first album, "Look What the Cat
Dragged In," has been released on a
major label. In contrast to their elabo
rate, glam-rock appearance though, the
music on the album is straightforward,
no-frills rock n roll.
"Musically, 1 think it's rock n' roll in
its most primitive form," says DeVille.
"Nowadays everything is digitally
sampled this and analog that, so when
a band comes and plays regular rock
n' roll, people say, Gee, this sounds
different, what kind of computer are
they using to get that tone?' when in ac
tuality it's the absence of computers
that gets the tone."
>X'ith titles like "I Want Action," "Talk
Dirty to Me" and "Want Some, Need
Some," it's not difficult to see where
Poison draws most of its inspiration.
The band combines easy -to-learn lyrics
with catchy melodic lines, creating a
musical level that doesn't require an
in-depth knowledge of music to under
stand. The group's music is far from
making any kind of serious statement,
aimed instead at having a gtxxl time.
Even the anthem like "Cry Tough."'
which encourages listeners to "cry
tough to make your dreams happen,"

is not weighty or demanding.
The Poison live show combines the
best of the Poison strategy, the fun up
beat music and the high quality perfor
mance. "It's a big show, a big ex
travaganza, a big production," says the
ever-enthusiastic DeVille.
At the Stone club in Palo Alto, Poison
was definitely in its element. The club's
many closed-circuit television screens
perfectly complimented the group's
style of performance. Vocalist Michaels
led the band through choreographed
stage moves, giving the show a
planned, unified feel — as if it had
been a video. The stage set. which the
band members like to think of as "the
Poison playpen," helped create a
festive atmosphere.
"The stage set is a conglomerate of
what everyone thinks," explained
DeVille. "We get so sick of seeing a
bunch of Marshall and Fender amps on
stage. It starts to look like a music
store. We wanted people to go see a
rock show not a music store, so we
decided to do something different. We
put faces on the amps just to make a
production out of it."
The theme of the stage as "the
Poison playpen" is right in line with
the group's image Though some may
condemn them for being contrived,
the bright colors, balloons and flashy
clothes of the "playpen, along with
the Poison members themselves —
like vibrant children showing an
excess of energy and enthusiasm —
are unarguably entertaining to watch
and listen to.
Given the music industry's heavy
emphasis on video these days, the
Poison "formula for success seems to
be an obvious, practical step for
making it big.
"I think the four of us are very lucky
to be in the position we're in right
now,' concludes DeVille, "because
we'll go into the Guinness Book of
World Records for being the most
crazy, entertaining band around, or
we II die trying
