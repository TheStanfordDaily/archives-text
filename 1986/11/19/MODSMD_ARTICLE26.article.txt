## Card sweeps Bears; all alone in first 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Last night in California's Harmon
Gymnasium, Stanford women's volley
ball won its 14th straight Pacific 10
Conference game, easily defeating the
Bears, 15-2, 15-10, 15-10, and taking
sole possession of first place in the
conference for the first time this fall.
The victory was the Cardinal's fifth in
a row and 14th in its last 17 matches.
The team is now 19-8 overall, 15-1 in
the Pac-10. The Bears dropped to 16-18
overall and 6-10 in conference play.
Both squads wrap up their 1986 Pac-10
seasons this weekend at UCLA and USC.
Half a game behind Stanford are the
14-1 Bruins, who will almost surely
beat Cal Thursday night to set up a
showdown for the conference title
when UCLA hosts the Cardinal Friday
night. Both teams will face one more
Pac-10 school after the "championship
game," but that Pac-10 school is USC.
The Trojans are winless in conference
play this season.
The score of last night's match and
the fact that it took only an hour and 15
minutes indicate exactly what kind of
contest it was, according to Stanford
Coach Don Shaw.

"We played well all three games,"
Shaw said. "We pretty much handled
them easily in the first game. They
played better in the last two games, but
we sustained a high level of play."
The Bears visited Maples Pavilion in
late October and stole the first game
from Stanford before losing the next
three by progressively greater margins.
Shaw said the Cardinal spikers did not
give Cal a chance this time, and he at
tributed this in pan to their perfor
mance Saturday night against un
ranked Arizona, when they needed a
fifth game surge to pull out the win.
"One of the best things that could
have happened to us was the way we
played vs. Arizona," Shaw said.
"(Stanford) did not want to come out
and not be ready to play."
Shaw added that the squad's solid,
well-executed play last night shows a
team confidence that is starting to peak
just at the right time, a little more than
two weeks before the NCAA playoffs.
Cal freshman Tiffany Rochelle, who
carried her team to that first game win
in October before being shut down en
tirely for the rest of the match, was not
a factor at all in her home gym. Shaw

night.
said the Cardinal keyed on Rochelle
the entire match, allowing her only five
kills in 24 attempts. Rochelle finished
with a - .125 hitting percentage.
Teresa Smith led the Cardinal with
16 kills at a .462 success rate, followed
by Barbra Fontana with 10 kills and a
.273 hitting percentage. Stanford hit at
.364 as a team, while Cal managed only
.062.
