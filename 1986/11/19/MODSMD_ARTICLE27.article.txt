# Davis starts season with Iowa

lOWA CITY, lowa â€” It's an hour before the
lowa basketball players are scheduled to hit the
floor of Carver-Hawkeye Arena, but the black and
yellow-clad fans have already started to straggle in
and will soon number in the thousands.
A critical Big Ten Conference matchup for the
Hawkeyes, or perhaps an early season non
conference tilt with the likes of lowa State?
Actually it's just a light Saturday morning
workout before an important exhibition with the
Russian national squad the next day, but the
crowd is evidence that former Stanford Coach
Tom Davis has stepped into a radically different
basketball atmosphere in lowa City.
The last two lowa coaches, Lute Olson and
George Raveling, fled west to Arizona and USC,
respectively, and the pressure the lowa fans and
press put on their coach is legendary. However,
the relaxed Davis discounted this influence in a
pre-practice interview.
"What a lot of people outside coaching don't
realize is that pressure is internal," he said. Al
though, "there is no question there is (more pres
sure) here. 1 think that's true of any state univer
sity, especially here where there aren't any pro
teams."
When the Hawkeyes do come out for warmups,
they carry the burden of high expectations and
the blessing of being perhaps the most talented
group of players in the Big Ten. Sophomore
swingman Roy Marble was one of the top fresh
men in the conference last season and will be

joined at forward by 7-footer Brad Lohaus. At cen
ter is powerful sophomore Ed Horton, a former
Illinois Mr. Basketball.
Jeff Moe, Kevin Gamble, B.J. Armstrong and Bill
Jones will allow Davis to go four-deep at guard,
and Al Lorenzen, among the team's leading
scorers last year and one of the greatest lowa
prep players ever, will come off the bench. Not
even on the floor is Gerry "Sir Jamalot" Wright,
the starting center who is currently out with an in
jury.
Still, Davis compares his past Stanford teams
favorably with his conglomeration of former prep
superstars at lowa.
"This team is a little quicker, and it's a fairly
deep team," he said. "People who think there's a
big difference in talent are really mistaken. We're
a very nice ballclub, but if we were located in an
other part of the country, we wouldn't receive any
attention at all.
"They're really nice kids (at Iowa). They
remind me a lot of our Stanford players."
Davis also plans to use the all-out style of bas
ketball that is his trademark. "In terms of pressing
and running, I think we'll be a high-scoring bal
lclub," he said.
Many people speculated that the Stanford Ad
mission's Department's decision to reject prep
superstar Chris Munk played a role in Davis' deci
sion to leave the Farm, but Davis feels the compe
tition involved in recruiting players to lowa City
makes the task just as challenging there.
"It's really the same process," he said. "You're

looking at a different pool and differ
ent numbers of kids. (At Stanford) we
were only able to look at a small por
tion of the population. You work just as
hard here. When we lose a kid, it might
be to North Carolina, Georgetown or
Kentucky."
Davis' Stanford assistants Bruce
Pearl and Gary Close followed him to
lowa and have helped him put to
gether his first batch of recruits as well
as implement his style of play in a
rushed schedule of pre-season work
outs.
"Bruce Pearl and Gary Close had
what I think might be a good recruiting
year," said Davis, adding that he feels
fortunate to work with a familiar staff,
"because they know what you're
looking for."
Davis is taking what might be called
a "crash course" in lowa basketball as
he attempts to set his lineup before the
Great Alaska Shootout during Thanks
giving weekend.
"It's hard in your first year to see
who your best players are, your best
defenders, your best shooters," Davis

said. "That's one of the things we're
trying to work though. I'm still not sure
I've got all the answers."
For Davis, who compiled a 58-59
Stanford record ;iru| boasts an overall
tally of 274-150, the move to lima is a
return to the Midwest, where he spent
of his youth and early coaching career.
Davis was born in Wisconsin and held
his first coaching job at Milledgeville
(111.) High School. Nonetheless, he has
mixed feelings about leaving the Farm.
"The reality strikes you when the
first cold wave goes through," he said
of being back in the Midwest. "I lived
here for 25, 26 years, so I'm pretty
familiar with the area and way of life.
"(But) anytime you change jobs it's
tough. We were all happy out there (at
Stanford). It was an enjoyable stop.
Sometimes you leave jobs and are glad,
but that's definitely not the case with
Stanford."
