# Clemens MVP, Mattingly second
## 
### 
KATY, Texas (AP) — Roger Clemens, who won 24
games in his first full season with the Boston Red
Sox, capped a dream year yesterday by becoming the
first starting pitcher in 15 years to win the American
League's Most Valuable Player Award.
The 24-year-old right-hander captured 19 of 28
first place votes for 339 points in easily outdistancing
Don Mattingly of the New York Yankees and Boston
teammate Jim Rice in the balloting by the Baseball
Writers Association of America.
"I thought I did have a pretty good chance even
though I was a starting pitcher," said Clemens at his
home in Katy. He conceded, though, that the news
still was a bit of a shock.
"I was going to come home tonight and see on TV
if 1 finished second or third, but Debbie (his wife)
wanted me to stay around the house."
He learned of the award by telephone and imme
diately called his wife, who was at an obstetrician's
office. She is expecting the couple's first child in five
days.
"I hope by winning this award I have put an ex
clamation mark in the minds of voters about starting
pitchers winning it. If I was voting, I'd vote for my
teammatejim Rice. But I felt one of us should win it."
The media descended upon the Clemens home for
the second time in a week — he won the Cy Young
award last Wednesday — and the scene was chaotic
with utility crews working on the new home and a
cleaning service using vacuums in the background.

The awards, he said, would be displayed in the
family room, where he already has his high school,
college and pro uniforms ready to hang.
Mattingly, the 1985 MVP, had five first place votes
and 258 points as he failed in a bid to become the
first to win the award in consecutive years since the
Yankees' Roger Maris in 1960-61.
Rice, the league's 1978 MVP, was third with the
other four first place votes and 241 points in the bal
loting by two writers in each of the 14 league cities.
Coming back from right shoulder surgery that cut
short his rookie season in 1985, Clemens began a
fabulous season by winning his first game 7-2 in
Chicago on April 11. He went on to pitch the Red Sox
to their first pennant since 1975 and only their fourth
in 68 years.
He became the Boston stopper. The Red Sox did
not lose more than four games in a row all season.
Clemens followed 14 losses with a victory'.
His other accomplishments included:
• setting a major league record by striking out 20 bat
ters in a game against the Seattle Mariners in Fenway-
Park on April 29;
• going 14-0 at the start of the season;
• winning the only games as Boston went 3-10 on the
road, but clung to the AL East lead immediately after
the All-Star Game in mid-July;
• with a 24-4 record, leading the majors in victories
and topping the AL with a 2.48 earned run average;

• struck out 238 batters in the season, second only to
Seattle's Mark Langston with 245;
• became only the third AL pitcher to win the Cy
Young Award unanimously, joining Detroit's Denny
McLain, 1968, and New York's Ron Guidry, 1978.
After pitching the Red Sox to the pennant with at
least four days' rest between starts, Clemens tired in
the postseason. He pitched three times with just
three days' rest in the seven-game playoff with Cali
fornia, with a 1-1 record, including a victory in the
seventh game.
He had no decision in two starts in the World Se
ries, won by the New York Mets in seven games.
Mattingly had another outstanding season as the
Yankees finished second in the AL East. He batted
.352, runnerup to Boston's Wade Boggs' .357, set a
New York record with 238 hits, had 31 homers and
drove in 113 runs.
Rice became the first Boston player to have four
200-hit seasons as he batted .324 with 20 homers and
110 RBI. Those figures compared with .315, 46
homers and 139 when he was MVP in 1978, the year
the Red Sox lost the division title in a single game
playoff with the Yankees.
Trailing the top three in the MVP voting were
George Bell of Toronto, 125 points; Jesse Barfield,
also of Toronto, 107; Kirbv Puckett of Minnesota, 105,
and Boggs, 87.

McLain, 1968, and New York's Ron Guidry, 1978.
After pitching the Red Sox to the pennant with at
least four days' rest between starts, Clemens tired in
the postseason. He pitched three times with just
three days' rest in the seven-game playoff with Cali
fornia, with a 1-1 record, including a victory in the
seventh game.
He had no decision in two starts in the World Se
ries, won by the New York Mets in seven games.
Mattingly had another outstanding season as the
Yankees finished second in the AL East. He batted
.352, runnerup to Boston's Wade Boggs' .357, set a
New York record with 238 hits, had 31 homers and
drove in 113 runs.
Rice became the first Boston player to have four
200-hit seasons as he batted .324 with 20 homers and
110 RBI. Those figures compared with .315, 46
homers and 139 when he was MVP in 1978, the year
the Red Sox lost the division title in a single game
playoff with the Yankees.
Trailing the top three in the MVP voting were
George Bell of Toronto, 125 points; Jesse Barfield,
also of Toronto, 107; Kirbv Puckett of Minnesota, 105,
and Boggs, 87.
KATY, Texas (AP) — Roger Clemens, who won 24
games in his first full season with the Boston Red
Sox, capped a dream year yesterday by becoming the
first starting pitcher in 15 years to win the American
League's Most Valuable Player Award.
The 24-year-old right-hander captured 19 of 28
first place votes for 339 points in easily outdistancing
Don Mattingly of the New York Yankees and Boston
teammate Jim Rice in the balloting by the Baseball
Writers Association of America.
"I thought I did have a pretty good chance even
though I was a starting pitcher," said Clemens at his
home in Katy. He conceded, though, that the news
still was a bit of a shock.
"I was going to come home tonight and see on TV
if 1 finished second or third, but Debbie (his wife)
wanted me to stay around the house."
He learned of the award by telephone and imme
diately called his wife, who was at an obstetrician's
office. She is expecting the couple's first child in five
days.
"I hope by winning this award I have put an ex
clamation mark in the minds of voters about starting
pitchers winning it. If I was voting, I'd vote for my
teammatejim Rice. But I felt one of us should win it."
The media descended upon the Clemens home for
the second time in a week — he won the Cy Young
award last Wednesday — and the scene was chaotic
with utility crews working on the new home and a
cleaning service using vacuums in the background.

The awards, he said, would be displayed in the
family room, where he already has his high school,
college and pro uniforms ready to hang.
Mattingly, the 1985 MVP, had five first place votes
and 258 points as he failed in a bid to become the
first to win the award in consecutive years since the
Yankees' Roger Maris in 1960-61.
Rice, the league's 1978 MVP, was third with the
other four first place votes and 241 points in the bal
loting by two writers in each of the 14 league cities.
Coming back from right shoulder surgery that cut
short his rookie season in 1985, Clemens began a
fabulous season by winning his first game 7-2 in
Chicago on April 11. He went on to pitch the Red Sox
to their first pennant since 1975 and only their fourth
in 68 years.
He became the Boston stopper. The Red Sox did
not lose more than four games in a row all season.
Clemens followed 14 losses with a victory'.
His other accomplishments included:
• setting a major league record by striking out 20 bat
ters in a game against the Seattle Mariners in Fenway-
Park on April 29;
• going 14-0 at the start of the season;
• winning the only games as Boston went 3-10 on the
road, but clung to the AL East lead immediately after
the All-Star Game in mid-July;
• with a 24-4 record, leading the majors in victories
and topping the AL with a 2.48 earned run average;

• struck out 238 batters in the season, second only to
Seattle's Mark Langston with 245;
• became only the third AL pitcher to win the Cy
Young Award unanimously, joining Detroit's Denny
McLain, 1968, and New York's Ron Guidry, 1978.
