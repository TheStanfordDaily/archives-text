# Eselius: Card football fan after four years
## 
### 
When I first came to this fine institu
tion, I was not a Cardinal football fan. I
just wasn't. During this point in my life,
influenced by other geographical hot
spots, 1 cheered predominantly for pri
mary consumers — the Oregon Ducks,
the Oregon State Beavers and the Min
nesota Golden Gophers.

I wanted to like the Cardinal. I
jiggled my keys blindly; I timed my "All
Right Now" 45-inch'vertical leap (OK, I
exaggerated); I even offered throaty
gasps of "Rose Bowl" to spur on the
team toward loftier achievement —
we were 1-10 that season.
Through it all — the kazoos, the
Wave, the cookie-crazy antics — I still
didn't feel that deep conviction for the
Farm squad. Most of my dormmates
chided me for this lack of football rev

erence, and eventually, coerced by
longstanding, deep-set frustrations,
they launched heavy, blunt stones at
my navel. Today, I have no navel.
After my turbulent beginning, 1 en
tered my sophomore year full of new -
found alacrity — a sudden revelation
of red covered my embittered soul 1
cheered loudly and enthusiastically. 1
appropriately high-fived on big Stan
ford plays. 1 wore red, and by all
means, appeared to be a true Cardinal
rooter.
I suffered inside, though. A tiny
voice, centered deep in the recesses of
my duodenum (I had X-rays), rose up
and chanted doggedly "Go Ducks,
go Beavs, go Golden Gophers."
At first, I thought I had swallowed a
copy of Ranger Rick, then it dawned
upon me. A Cardinal fan 1 was not.
Promptly, I metamorphosed into a
reclusive, defensive troll, no longer
able to communicate or socialize. Call
it sophomore slump.
My junior year offered a fresh start. It
gave me the chance to re-evaluate my
life as a Cardinal fan. Instead of petty
concern for blind loyalty and proper


ERIK I
ESELIUS'
alligiance, I made the Saturday after
noon stadium march out of
"appreciation for the game." If nothing
else, the Pacific 10 Conference was the
"conference of champions," 1 surmised.
Gradually, a change came over me.
No longer did Oregon's loss to
whomever affect me adversely. Occa
sionally, I would forget who the Gop
hers played that afternoon. Yes, I found
myself sincerely interested in the game
at hand. The Stanford game.
I felt disgust after blown plays. A
great reception instantly generated a
determined and delighted yell of ap
proval. 1 enjoyed watching Stanford,
and, for the first time, I sensed that I
was a Cardinal fan.
Now in my final year on the Farm,
ducks, beavers and gophers are cute
critters that I still pull for whenever
they do not play Stanford.
Going to a game now means serious
emotions. Granted, 1 don't break down
and hyperventilate when we fumble.
Neither have I painted my body red
and gone naked to a game.
But as the contest moves along, I'm
there emotionally. I hated losing to

Washington this season. Being
defeated by USC brought similiar, al
most angry, feelings of disappoint
ment. "We got in" rationalizations
didn't work anymore — we should
have just won, period
Nonetheless, we're Gator Bowl
bound. As a senior, who has seen the 1-
10 lean years, I should be delighted.
I'm happy, but not ecstatic. I wanted to
roadtrip.
I understand that the Gator Bowl is a
prestigious bowl, and, most of all, a big
money maker. Problem is, most of us
cannot afford to go to Florida, which
translates to few Cardinal partisans
waving keys in lovely, ever
cosmopolitan Jacksonville. Oh well, at
least we play Clemson — they're cer
tainly exciting.
What can I say but Sun Bowl. Held in
El Paso, Texas, Stanford fans could still
soak in the accustomed rays. While
Stanford would not receive as much
money, we would play Alabama, a team
that would convince the undecided to
climb into the passenger seat.
Ahh yes, the fabled and glorious
roadtrip gone roadside. A pity, espe
cially for the seniors.
Oh well, we're 7-2 and styling. 1 just
hope that we get good reception in
Oregon.

didn't feel that deep conviction for the
Farm squad. Most of my dormmates
chided me for this lack of football rev

erence, and eventually, coerced by
longstanding, deep-set frustrations,
they launched heavy, blunt stones at
my navel. Today, I have no navel.
After my turbulent beginning, 1 en
tered my sophomore year full of new -
found alacrity — a sudden revelation
of red covered my embittered soul 1
cheered loudly and enthusiastically. 1
appropriately high-fived on big Stan
ford plays. 1 wore red, and by all
means, appeared to be a true Cardinal
rooter.
I suffered inside, though. A tiny
voice, centered deep in the recesses of
my duodenum (I had X-rays), rose up
and chanted doggedly "Go Ducks,
go Beavs, go Golden Gophers."
At first, I thought I had swallowed a
copy of Ranger Rick, then it dawned
upon me. A Cardinal fan 1 was not.
Promptly, I metamorphosed into a
reclusive, defensive troll, no longer
able to communicate or socialize. Call
it sophomore slump.
My junior year offered a fresh start. It
gave me the chance to re-evaluate my
life as a Cardinal fan. Instead of petty
concern for blind loyalty and proper


ERIK I
ESELIUS'
alligiance, I made the Saturday after
noon stadium march out of
"appreciation for the game." If nothing
else, the Pacific 10 Conference was the
"conference of champions," 1 surmised.
Gradually, a change came over me.
No longer did Oregon's loss to
whomever affect me adversely. Occa
sionally, I would forget who the Gop
hers played that afternoon. Yes, I found
myself sincerely interested in the game
at hand. The Stanford game.
I felt disgust after blown plays. A
great reception instantly generated a
determined and delighted yell of ap
proval. 1 enjoyed watching Stanford,
and, for the first time, I sensed that I
was a Cardinal fan.
Now in my final year on the Farm,
ducks, beavers and gophers are cute
critters that I still pull for whenever
they do not play Stanford.
Going to a game now means serious
emotions. Granted, 1 don't break down
and hyperventilate when we fumble.
Neither have I painted my body red
and gone naked to a game.
But as the contest moves along, I'm
there emotionally. I hated losing to

Washington this season. Being
defeated by USC brought similiar, al
most angry, feelings of disappoint
ment. "We got in" rationalizations
didn't work anymore — we should
have just won, period
Nonetheless, we're Gator Bowl
bound. As a senior, who has seen the 1-
10 lean years, I should be delighted.
I'm happy, but not ecstatic. I wanted to
roadtrip.
I understand that the Gator Bowl is a
prestigious bowl, and, most of all, a big
money maker. Problem is, most of us
cannot afford to go to Florida, which
translates to few Cardinal partisans
waving keys in lovely, ever
cosmopolitan Jacksonville. Oh well, at
least we play Clemson — they're cer
tainly exciting.
What can I say but Sun Bowl. Held in
El Paso, Texas, Stanford fans could still
soak in the accustomed rays. While
Stanford would not receive as much
money, we would play Alabama, a team
that would convince the undecided to
climb into the passenger seat.
Ahh yes, the fabled and glorious
roadtrip gone roadside. A pity, espe
cially for the seniors.
Oh well, we're 7-2 and styling. 1 just
hope that we get good reception in
Oregon.
