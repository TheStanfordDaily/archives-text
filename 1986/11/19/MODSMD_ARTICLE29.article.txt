# Eselius: Card football fan after four years
## 
### 
When I first came to this fine institu
tion, I was not a Cardinal football fan. I
just wasn't. During this point in my life,
influenced by other geographical hot
spots, 1 cheered predominantly for pri
mary consumers — the Oregon Ducks,
the Oregon State Beavers and the Min
nesota Golden Gophers.

I wanted to like the Cardinal. I
jiggled my keys blindly; I timed my "All
Right Now" 45-inch'vertical leap (OK, I
exaggerated); I even offered throaty
gasps of "Rose Bowl" to spur on the

we were 1-10 that season.
Through it all — the kazoos, the
Wave, the cookie-crazy antics — I still
didn't feel that deep conviction for the

longstanding, deep-set frustrations,
they launched heavy, blunt stones at
my navel. Today, I have no navel.
After my turbulent beginning, 1 en

ford plays. 1 wore red, and by all
means, appeared to be a true Cardinal
rooter.
I suffered inside, though. A tiny
voice, centered deep in the recesses of
my duodenum (I had X-rays), rose up
and chanted doggedly "Go Ducks,
go Beavs, go Golden Gophers."
At first, I thought I had swallowed a
copy of Ranger Rick, then it dawned
upon me. A Cardinal fan 1 was not.
Promptly, I metamorphosed into a
reclusive, defensive troll, no longer
able to communicate or socialize. Call
it sophomore slump.
My junior year offered a fresh start. It
gave me the chance to re-evaluate my
life as a Cardinal fan. Instead of petty
concern for blind loyalty and proper
