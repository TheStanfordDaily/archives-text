# Individual research emphasized
## Black Scholars Program starts 
### DES BRACEY 
The Black Scholars Program (BSP) is only one day
old, yet talk has already turned to its future impact on
Stanford's black community and the University as a
whole.
BSP is a research/tutorial preset from the Pro
gram for Afro-American Studies AAAS) that offers
black students the opportunity to engage in individ
ual research with black faculty.
More than 40 students and 20 faculty and staff
members attended a reception yesterday at Harmony
House to herald the official opening of the program.
BSP will accept only 14 students for research to be
done spring quarter.
AAAS Chairman Kennel 1 Jackson and Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies Carolyn Lougee were pleased
with the turnout and spoke enthusiastically of the
program's future.
Jackson said the program will promote research
among more students. "People always talk about
senior honors, but they don't talk about the prelude

that will lead up to them. This program gives under
graduates some control over what will happen to
them, even if it is only for five units."
Jackson hopes BSP will ultimately prove his belief
that there are more black students "capable of great
things" than current numbers indicate. BSP will help
provide the nurturing necessary for blacks to excel in
the traditional honors competitions like the Rhodes
Scholarship, Jackson said.
Jackson, also a professor of history, noted the need
to foster close interaction between students and pro
fessors. "I think too much education here is talking at
people."
Lougee said reverberations from BSP could effect
the entire University. "I see it as a pilot endeavor that
could be replicated by other departments and pro
grams."
Lougee said the program successfully addresses
the two most crucial problems in undergraduate
education at Stanford. "The first is the need to per
sonalize education, to bring students and faculty into

personal relationships in a university where we have
classes larger than either students or faculty are com
fortable with.
"The second is the need for faculty to involve un
dergraduates in research," said Lougee, adding that
this will be the greatest curricular priority at Stanford
over the next decade.
Lougee also said that she has secured funding for
the BSP for its first three years. "If it is successful —
which it will be — permanent funding will be ar
ranged," she said.
Students seemed appreciative of BSP. Sophomore
Marcos Santos plans to apply for a research position
with Physics Prof. Arthur Walker. "I think sooner or
later 1 would have searched for a research project,
but I don't think I would have found it," Santos said.
BSP "makes things a lot easier," he added.
Applications for BSP are still available at the AAAS
office, and the deadline for consideration is Feb. 1,
1987. Positions in the project are open to all under
graduate students from any major department.
