# Women's golf fifth, McCarthy shoots 73
## 
### 
The second round of the 54-hole
U.S. International University Golf
Tournament was held in the rain at
Rancho Bernardo Golf Course in
San Diego yesterday, but the
downpour did not bother the Stan
ford women's golf team, as the
Cardinal held onto fifth place and
picked up a shot on the leader.
The leader has changed since
Monday's round, however, as host
USIU moved into the top position
with a total of 611. The Gulls shot
299 as a team in yesterday's action
to move a stroke in front of South
Carolina. Arizona and Georgia are
tied for third at 617.
"USIU is playing on their home
course," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said, "but they still played
well. USIU has the best player in
South Africa and Colombia. They
have five really strong foreign
stars."
Martina Koch of Arizona
remained first in individual play
with a 145. Right behind was
Marianne Morris of South Carolina
with a 146. South African Laurette
Maritz, a three-time first team All-

American for USIU, held down
third at 148.
Stanford's Kathleen McCarthy
came in with a par 73 on the day to
give her a 149 total, good for fourth
among individuals. McCarthy is just
four shots behing the leader Koch.
"Kathleen just played great,"
Baldwin said. "Her 73 could just as
well have been a 67 or 66. She had
probably 10 putts that went right
over the edge, just over the lip. She
played phenomenally. Tomorrow, I
think she will play really well."
Junior Kay Cornelius recorded
her second 77 in as many days to
give her a 154. Adrienne Gilmartin,
a senior, trails by one at 155, while
junior Trish McGonigle has a 161.
Freshman Stephanie Parel com
pleted the 36 holes in 167 strokes.
"The team played really well,"
Baldwin said. "The rain was tough;
it was raincoats and umbrellas all
day. The girls handled it really
well — they crept up a little today.
The team feels pretty good."
Following Stanford in sixth
through eighth places were Wash
ington, Alabama and Auburn.
