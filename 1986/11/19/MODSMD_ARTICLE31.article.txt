# Wyman defeats both injury and opponents
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Sunday's announcement that Stanford will cap its season
by playing in the Gator Bowl probably meant more to
linebacker David Wyman than anyone who ever picked up a
football and donned the Cardinal red. After four years of
frustration — years in which Wyman played standout foot
ball while bad luck, injuries and poor supporting casts
dashed his hopes time after time — his dream of playing in
a bowl game is coming true.
And, though the soft-spoken All-America candidate would
never admit it, Wyman has had a lot to do with getting his
team the date in Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 27. Wyman's ag
gressive play — "violent," in the words of Stanford Asst.
Coach Dick Mannini — has earned him the respect of oppo
nents and teammates alike and will likely earn him a job in
the National Football League next year.
"He's exceeded expectations as far as play is concerned,"
said Mannini, noting that Wyman this year is coming off a
serious knee injury that forced him to sit out all of last
season. "But, as for his role on the team, it's hard to put into
words what Dave has done — there's no way to measure it."
In the departments that can be measured, the numbers
help explain exactly what the 6-foot-2, 235-pound Wyman
means to the Cardinal. Through nine games, he leads the
defense with 139 tackles — 57 better than the runner-up.
Wyman also has two interceptions and two pass deflections
on a squad that ranks second in the Pacific 10 Conference
and ninth in the nation in scoring defense.
"He's an excellent football player who adds a lot to their
defense," said USC Asst. Coach Ron Turner, the offensive co
ordinator for the Trojan squad that beat Stanford 10-0 last
month despite a career-high 27 tackles by Wyman. "There's
no question he's an inspirational leader as well as a physical
leader, and one of the best in the Pac-10."
Wyman, with typical modesty, shares credit with his
teammates on a defensive squad that has improved vastly
since 1985, when the unit finished eighth in the Pac-10 in
total defense and ninth in scoring defense. Wyman said a
"pretty wild-eyed bunch of guys" playing with a simple
game plan and a positive attitude have turned things around
for the defense.
"We're not the real intellectual type that you would think
you would find at Stanford," Wyman said. "We have a lot of
guys who are on defense because they like to hit and are ag
gressive just by nature."
That description, plus the more unusual qualities of high
intensity, consistency and leadership by example, all add up
to Wyman's hard-hitting style, according to teammates,
coaches and opponents.
"He's extremely aggressive and even intimidating to a
certain extent," said Stanford Asst. Coach Dick Kerr, who
coaches linebackers. "Overall, he's an extremely well
rounded player, and he's a leader by what he does out
there."
Fellow linebacker Chris Weber recalled that when he was
a sophomore two years ago he was sometimes intimidated

by Wyman in the huddle. "1 was as scared of Dave as 1 was of
the other team," Weber said. "1 used to pretend I wasn't
breathing hard so he wouldn't notice."
But Wyman, a communication major who won a Dean's
Award last year for his work with Volunteers for Youth and
his leadership in the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, said it is less
a case of him intimidating other players than his simply be
coming "consumed" by football.
"It takes me about half a day to get out of game mode,"
the fifth-year senior said. "It's hard for me to talk to people.
You get yourself worked up all week, and you go down
there and it's a war. That's what I always compare it to — just
going into battle."
Wyman waged his biggest battle last year in rehabilitating
his right knee, which he dislocated in a game against
Arizona two years ago. "The doctors said it was the worst
one they'd seen from football, that it looked like a car acci
dent," he said. "So I wasn't expecting.much."
But after three-and-a-half hours of surgery, two months in
a cast, three-and-a-half months in a walking brace and
countless hours sweating it out in a special rehabilitation
program, Wyman says his knee is as good as ever and his
speed even better. "Physically, there's no remnant of the in
jury other than the scars on my leg," he said. "Mentally, it's a
whole different game. The first game back, I was out there
looking out of the corner of my eye. It's hard to get back
into it and forget something like that."
At the time of the injury, some predicted Wyman would
never play again. "That was the lowest I d ever been, he
said. "I had everything going for me at the time. I was having
a pretty good game against Arizona, and then, just like that, it
was like someone came and took everything away from me,
everything I had been planning for since I was a little kid.
Wyman has had plenty of time to consider the roadblocks
to a successful football career. He has wanted to be a foot
ball player since his grade school days. He started playing as
a high school freshman in his hometown of Reno, Nev., and
two years later he was all-state as both a tight end and a
middle linebacker as he led his team to a state champion
ship.
"Then I started getting mail," Wyman said. Oklahoma, Ne
braska, Notre Dame, Washington, UClj\ and Stanford all
recruited him heavily. Wyman said he could have received
more recognition at a school such as UCLA, which in
Wyman's four college years so far has played in three Rose
Bowls and one Fiesta Bowl, but Wyman chose Stanford be
cause of the academic appeal and the fact that his brother
Mike was here and on the football team at the time.
"It was neat for my mom and dad to have two kids playing
football at Stanford," he said. "It's not that they pushed me at
all. I wanted to be known as not just an everyday dumb jock.
I guess I was looking a little bit ahead then, knowing that 1
couldn't play football all my life and that I had to make a
living."
Then-Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin elected not to redshirt
Wyman in his freshman year, because, Wyman said, there
was a good chance the Cardinal would go to a bowl game
and Wyman would see some playing time. He did get into

the game occasionally and recorded 17 tackles, nine of
which were unassisted, but a Stanford loss in Big Game on a
controversial five-lateral California kickoff return knocked
the Cardinal from bowl contention, the last time Stanford
was even close to receiving a bid.
Sophomore year, Wyman's career blossomed while the
team collapsed to a 1-10 record. He was named second team
All-Pac-10, after leading the Cardinal with 144 tackles, 92
solo stops and two fumbles caused. Not even a torn tendon
in his left ring finger could stop Wyman. He elected to put
off surgery until the end of the dismal Cardinal season —
even though the decision meant losing the ability to
straighten the finger for the rest of his life.
In the 1984 season, Wyman was near the end of easily the
best season of his life when he suffered the knee injury. But
he was still named second team All-Pac-10, won the Irving S.
Zeimer Award as the team's most valuable player and led
the defense with 128 tackles and 68 unassisted stops.
The next era in Wyman's football career will probably
begin when the NFL draft takes place in April. Both Mannini
and Kerr said Wyman will probably be selected within the
first three rounds.
"If he's not one of the two best linebackers in the country,
I don't know who is," Mannini said. "His pro career is going
to be a very, very bright one. At first the scouts approached
him with a little trepidation (because of the injury), but he's
fully recovered."
Wyman expressed a more conservative view of his profes

sional prospects. "I'm taking the approach that I'm not ex
pecting too much," he said. "A lot of people have told me a
lot of different things. Some people have been telling me
my knee might not pass the physical. Others are saying I'm a
sure second or third rounder."
Cornerback Toi Cook, a likely draftee himself, said
Wyman should be very appealing to the scouts, comparing
his teammate to "big name players" like professional foot
ball stars Kenny Easley and Jack Lambert. "He's the kind of
player you just know is there, and that brings you up," Cook
said.
Weber agreed that Wyman's biggest asset is his ability to
inspire his teammates to play their best. "He's not a yell
leader out there," Weber said. "But you see him stack some
one up at the line and you say I want to play harder.' There
are very few who have the qualities that Dave does."
Weber said Wyman, who calls the defensive plays, is or
dinarily quiet in the huddle. But on the final Bruin drive at
the UCLA game two weeks ago, Wyman exploded with
valuable encouragement. "He came in and said, We've had
enough should'ves, could'ves, would'ves and let's get it
done.' I was surprised."'
The squad responded. The defense dropped UCIA run
ning back Gaston Green on a crucial fourth-and-one play,
sealing the biggest Cardinal victory of the decade.
Looking back on his Stanford years and a football career


Kym Boyman/Daily file
All-America candidate David Wyman leads the Cardinal in tackles with 139, 57 more than Barry McKeever, the
team's second-leading tackier. The senior from Reno, Nev., collected a career-high 27 tackles against USC earlier
this season and has also recorded two interceptions.
that will go down as one of Stanford's
all-time greatest, Wyman said he is
pleased, especially with the bowl bid,
despite the frequent frustrations. The
only thing that still bothers him is the
lack of support the team gets from the
Stanford community.
He said apathy about sports here
and the sometimes negative comments
he has heard about the team have left
him somewhat bitter. He said criticism
of the football program is unfounded
and suggests misunderstanding of the
sport in the community.
"We bring something to the Univer
sity an A student can't," Wyman said.
"But someone could turn on the TV on
Saturday and think Stanford's really
great, not because some guy's getting
straight A's in classes. I think people
don't realize we represent Stanford in
a different way."
Wyman cannot stand anyone not
taking football seriously. He remem
bered one incident before this year's
game against Washington when a
group of freshmen were walking be
hind the team to the stadium making

jokes about the game.
"They just didn't understand,"
Wyman said. "They didn't understand
that we wanted to be quiet and keep a
serious attitude. Finally, I told some
one to shut up, and he looked up at me
asking, What's your deal?"
"It makes your heart hurt, because
you work so hard for it and you believe
in it so much, and someone just rips
you,'' he said. "I think everyone here
has had someone come up to them
and say that it's a joke that we're in the
top 20."
Wyman said he has become
'immune'' to the insults and has
simply concentrated on becoming the
best football player he can be — a goal
he has more than accomplished con
sidering the impediments he has
overcome. Acclaim is not/what Wyman
is after, though. In fact, there may be
only one person around whom Wyman
is really interested in impressing.
"I still remember one time when I
was talking to my friend in eighth
grade, and he was asking me what I
wanted to do when I grow up," Wyman
said. "I used to always say I wanted to
be a pro football player, and he used to
always make fun of me.
"Now, I wonder if he is watching
me."
