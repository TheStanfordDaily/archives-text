# Harvard OKs Women's Studies

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The faculty of Harvard's College of Arts and Sciences
voted overwhelmingly yesterday to recognize Women's
Studies as a formal interdisciplinary program in which stu
dents can obtain undergraduate degrees.
The establishment of the new major culminates an eight
year drive by a faculty committee to foster interest in
women's studies at Harvard.
Two years ago, the committee proposed creating the
Women's Studies major. The proposal wound its way
through the Harvard bureaucracy and came up for final ap
proval yesterday. Only one faculty member dissented.
As an interdisciplinary- major, Women's Studies will offer
credit for relevant courses in several departments and will
also offer special tutorials.
In other news at Harvard, the college is still feeling the af
tershocks of Education Secretary William Bennett's recent
criticism of its core curriculum.
Bennett slammed Harvard's lax course requirements,

saying the core curriculum had no focus. Harvard under
graduates must take eight courses to fulfill the core require
ment, but they are offered several choices of courses within
the distribution areas.
The attack has spurred widespread discussion, with many
students and faculty members defending the college's pro
gram, according to senior Matthew Saal, associate editor of
the Harvard Crimson.
Saal said the core is far from perfect — and certainly does
not teach students any single body of knowledge — but he
added that it aims only at teaching students "modes of
thought" through exposure to both Eastern and Western
cultures.
He cited the Harvard faculty's "stalwart, Puritan indepen
dence" as a reason they might oppose the Western culture
core that Bennett advocated.
On another topic, the Harvard Corporation — known to
some critics as "the seven white men" — has decided it will
not grant an audience to any students or organizations. The
move is significant because a large number of students have
asked to come before the corporation to argue the case for
blanket divestment.
