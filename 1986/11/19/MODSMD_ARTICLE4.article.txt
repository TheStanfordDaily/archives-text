# D.C. campus set to open in 1988
## Internships to be major focus 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Staff writer 
A Stanford campus in Washington,
D.C., will open in the spring of 1988 to
provide both academic work and "very
substantial" internships for students,
according to Carolyn I.ougee, dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
This is the first time the University
has ever considered opening a campus
in the capital. According to Lougee, the
idea stemmed from the increasing
number of students interested in
public service and policy-making.

Science Department. "I think it could
do a lot for Stanford," he said, echoing
the sentiments of other professors.
The academic portion of the pro

by the director of the campus, a
tutorial and smaller seminars taught by
instructors from other universities,

agencies, think tanks or congressional
staffs. Students will also be required to
write a research paper.
With the exception of the director of
the program, no Stanford faculty will
teach at the Washington campus ini
tially. As the program expands, one fac
ulty member from Stanford may be
added.
An integral pan of the program will
be the internship, which Lougee said
will put students "near high-level
policy-makers." Internships will in
volve up to 30 hours of work per week.
She emphasized that the internships
will not be insignificant jobs, but that
an effort will be made to provide stu
dents with rewarding, challenging pos

Whether students will receive aca
demic credit for the internship had not
been determined when Provost James
Rosse announced the initiation of the
Washington campus to the Faculty Sen

But Catherine Milton, director of the
Public Service Center and member of
the program committee, clarified the
