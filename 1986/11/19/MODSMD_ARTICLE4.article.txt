# D.C. campus set to open in 1988
## Internships to be major focus 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Staff writer 
A Stanford campus in Washington,
D.C., will open in the spring of 1988 to
provide both academic work and "very
substantial" internships for students,
according to Carolyn I.ougee, dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
This is the first time the University
has ever considered opening a campus
in the capital. According to Lougee, the
idea stemmed from the increasing
number of students interested in
public service and policy-making.
"It looked like both an academic op
portunity and one that would be of in
terest to a number of students," said
Lougee, who chairs the D.C. campus
program committee.
"I think it's a terrific idea," said Ste
phen Krasner, chairman of the Political
Science Department. "I think it could
do a lot for Stanford," he said, echoing
the sentiments of other professors.
The academic portion of the pro
gram will consist of a seminar taught
by the director of the campus, a
tutorial and smaller seminars taught by
instructors from other universities,

agencies, think tanks or congressional
staffs. Students will also be required to
write a research paper.
With the exception of the director of
the program, no Stanford faculty will
teach at the Washington campus ini
tially. As the program expands, one fac
ulty member from Stanford may be
added.
An integral pan of the program will
be the internship, which Lougee said
will put students "near high-level
policy-makers." Internships will in
volve up to 30 hours of work per week.
She emphasized that the internships
will not be insignificant jobs, but that
an effort will be made to provide stu
dents with rewarding, challenging pos
itions.
Whether students will receive aca
demic credit for the internship had not
been determined when Provost James
Rosse announced the initiation of the
Washington campus to the Faculty Sen
ate last Thursday.
But Catherine Milton, director of the
Public Service Center and member of
the program committee, clarified the
problem. "(Students) will not get
credit for the internship per se, but for
the whole program," she said. "They
will pay tuition, and they will get credit
for the program." She also said the
maximum number of units awarded
for the quarter will probably be 15.
The committee split the academic
year for the D.C. campus into two

"stretch quarters,' which are simply
fall and spring quarters with a few
weeks added, making them each 13
weeks long. A winter quarter in Wash
ington will not be offered. "The nor
mal quarter is too short a period to get
involved and do something substantial
as an intern," said Milton.
The program will open for one year
on a pilot basis, and only 15 students
will be enrolled, said Lougee. After that
time, the program will accept 30 stu
dents.
During the pilot stage, the program

emphasis will probably be "heavily
weighted" toward political science,
economics, international relations and
public policy, said Lougee. As the pro
gram gets larger, however, opportuni
ties for students in communication, the
arts and other majors will be created.
The program, designed for under
graduate students, is targeted mainly at
juniors, said Milton. But the program
"will be really flexible and include
graduate students if they're inter
ested," she added.
The next step for the committee is to

find a program director who will be
stationed in Washington. The director,
in addition to teaching a seminar for all
students in the program, will find the
internships for the students.
Lougee said the director will prob
ably not be someone from Stanford, al
though Stanford faculty will be
canvassed for the position. "But I think
it's a long-shot," she said. "No one here
wants to make that major a change."
The committee has not yet found a
location for the program, nor has it de
termined where students will be
housed.
Milton said it is "pretty unlikely" that
Stanford would build a new facility in
Washington.
Funding for the program "is one
of the highest priorities in the Centen
nial campaign," she said.
