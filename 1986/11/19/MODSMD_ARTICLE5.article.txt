# Expert: U.S. lost edge at Reykjavik

The United States lost control of the
dialogue, the agenda and the course of
events at the summit last month in
Reykjavik, Iceland, according to Jack
Mendelsohn, deputy director of the
Arms Control Association, who spoke
last night in Terman Auditorium.
Mendelsohn criticized an "inept"
lack of preparation on the part of the
Reagan administration. "The poverty of
analysis of the administration was
beyond compare," he said. '
Mendelsohn's speech on the current
arms control agenda was part of an on
going public lecture series in Crisis in
Arms Control, sponsored by the Center
for International Security and Arms
Control.
Both the United States and the Soviet
Union came away from the summit
agreeing that it was the Soviets who
made the moves and concessions,
Mendelsohn said. This is a "unique"
shift in Soviet policy, because the Rus

It was the Soviets who suggested the

meeting in Reykjavik and the proposals
leading up to the summit, Mendelsohn
said. The United States thought it was
in control since it planned the agenda
at the summit, he said. But the United
States walked into what the Soviet Un

Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star
Wars, "is what is blocking agree

Mendelsohn said, "Star Wars is and
was the key issue at Reykjavik." The
failure of the summit resulted from the
lack of any substantive discussion on
how to resolve the "standoff' on SDI,
he said.
Mendelsohn said the Soviets will
now "let the U.S. stew in its own juices
for awhile," adding that the forecast for
the Reagan administration's popularity
in its arms control policy looks even
"bleaker for the next couple of years.
"If and when the USSR thinks it is to
its tactical advantage" to return to the
reduction discussions, it will, he said.
In the meantime, the Soviets will "try
to appear as pro-arms control as possi
