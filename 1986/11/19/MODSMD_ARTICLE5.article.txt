# Expert: U.S. lost edge at Reykjavik
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
The United States lost control of the
dialogue, the agenda and the course of
events at the summit last month in
Reykjavik, Iceland, according to Jack
Mendelsohn, deputy director of the
Arms Control Association, who spoke
last night in Terman Auditorium.
Mendelsohn criticized an "inept"
lack of preparation on the part of the
Reagan administration. "The poverty of
analysis of the administration was
beyond compare," he said. '
Mendelsohn's speech on the current
arms control agenda was part of an on
going public lecture series in Crisis in
Arms Control, sponsored by the Center
for International Security and Arms
Control.
Both the United States and the Soviet
Union came away from the summit
agreeing that it was the Soviets who
made the moves and concessions,
Mendelsohn said. This is a "unique"
shift in Soviet policy, because the Rus
sians were "proud" of their con
ciliatory nature, he said.
It was the Soviets who suggested the

meeting in Reykjavik and the proposals
leading up to the summit, Mendelsohn
said. The United States thought it was
in control since it planned the agenda
at the summit, he said. But the United
States walked into what the Soviet Un
ion wanted to get out of Reykjavik: to
show the world that President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star
Wars, "is what is blocking agree
ments."
Mendelsohn said, "Star Wars is and
was the key issue at Reykjavik." The
failure of the summit resulted from the
lack of any substantive discussion on
how to resolve the "standoff' on SDI,
he said.
Mendelsohn said the Soviets will
now "let the U.S. stew in its own juices
for awhile," adding that the forecast for
the Reagan administration's popularity
in its arms control policy looks even
"bleaker for the next couple of years.
"If and when the USSR thinks it is to
its tactical advantage" to return to the
reduction discussions, it will, he said.
In the meantime, the Soviets will "try
to appear as pro-arms control as possi
ble" and watch the effect of the pres
sure put on the Reagan administration
hv Congress and U.S. allies, he said.
The United States has allowed "the
worst of all possible worlds' by anger
ing its allies and allowing the Soviet
Union to be "the most forthcoming,"
he said.
"Only the simplest problems were
solved or dealt with" at Reykjavik, he
said.
For example, the U.S.-Soviet
working group proposed that, over the
next five years, the number of strategic
warheads be reduced form 11,000 to
6,000. This was part of a proposal by
Reagan to completely eliminate the
number of strategic warheads during
the next decade.
However, Mendelsohn said that this
number of warheads does not repre
sent a 50 percent reduction as the ad
ministration claims. There are at least
3,000 warheads not included in the
classification.
Nor did the working group agree to
what would happen during the second
five year period.
"It was surreal," Mendelsohn said. If
the two countries were really serious,
they would have put the proposal "into
a declaration of mutual and honest in
tent," he added.
Another "stumbling block" not re
solved at the summit that will impede
further agreements or progress is stra

tegic weapons sublimits put forth by
the United States. The administration
did not want to deal with "complicated
mathematics," he said.
Mendelsohn also said he believes
the United States is "about to shoot it
self in the other foot" because of the
administration's recent statement that

the Soviets will not mind if the United
States breaks the SALT II treaty.
Mendelsohn said that the adminis
tration is "naive to believe this. The
Soviets know that an "ocean of
criticism" from the allies and Congress
will immedietely ensue if SALT II is
broken.

a declaration of mutual and honest in
tent," he added.
Another "stumbling block" not re
solved at the summit that will impede
further agreements or progress is stra

tegic weapons sublimits put forth by
the United States. The administration
did not want to deal with "complicated
mathematics," he said.
Mendelsohn also said he believes
the United States is "about to shoot it
self in the other foot" because of the
administration's recent statement that

the Soviets will not mind if the United
States breaks the SALT II treaty.
Mendelsohn said that the adminis
tration is "naive to believe this. The
Soviets know that an "ocean of
criticism" from the allies and Congress
will immedietely ensue if SALT II is
broken.
