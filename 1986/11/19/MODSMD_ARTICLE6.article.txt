# Kelly dispels TV myths
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Dispelling the glamorous image of television journalism,
newscaster Kate Kelly told more than 120 people last night
at Branner Hall about the realities of broadcasting.
Kelly, who received a bachelor's degree in communica
tion from Stanford in 1979, is a reporter for CBS affiliate
KPIX Ch. 5 and co-anchors the station's weekend newscasts.
"It's not a real glamorous profession — you're only one
of the peons in the newsroom, and you're only as good as
your last story," Kelly said.
The road to an on-camera position in the nation's fourth
largest television market was not an easy one for Kelly, who
first worked for stations in Redding and Austin, Texas.
"I did not think that I'd be able to work in San Francisco
for years," she said, calling the Bay Area "a very hard market
to get into, especially in production."
As a reporter at KPIX. Kelly said she gets to the station by
9 a.m. to pick up a story assignment — a task that can be
more difficult for female reporters.
"Women have to be very aggressive in this business to get
a g(H)d story," she said, noting that assignment editors often
pick male reporters for important stories. Once a female
reporter is able to get an important story and prove her
journalistic capabilities, such discrimination tends to fade,
she said.
While Kelly said she did not face sexual discrimination in
her rise to KPIX, she said it would be difficult for her to get a
job in New York City, the top television market in the
country.
"I don't get offers from the East Coast — I've got blond
hair In New York they like brunettes," she said.
Kelly, whose contract is now under renegotiation, said
she is happy in the Bay Area, although she said that she has

looked at a station in Chicago.
Right now I'm happy. I've got plenty of a challenge righf
here," she said, adding that she doesn't feel ready to try to
get a job as a network correspondent.
Kelly said life as a network correspondent "leaves a lot to
be desired, noting that such reporters "are living out of
suitcases."
While at Stanford, Kelly worked for KZSU and as a writer
for The Daily, but was undecided about her career aspira
tions until late in her undergraduate years.
"I really didn't narrow into it (broadcast journalism) until
the end of my junior year," Kelly said.
She spent the summer between her junior and senior
years taking part in the University's eight-week Mass Media
Institute, an experience that Kelly called her most practical
work at Stanford.
"You are able to get a tape out of it and you get to touch
the equipment," she said.
Kelly was also able to get hands-on experience in Red
ding, w here only five people worked in the newsroom, as
compared to the 115 staffers at KPIX
"You get to do a little bit of everything." she said, noting
that she wrote, produced and anchored her own newscasts
in the small town.
At KPIX, union regulations separate the various positions
in the news department, and Kelly said she is unable to
touch the editing equipment by herself.
Kelly said that while unions can be beneficial in some
aspects of broadcast journalism they "can be detrimental to
a shop" by segregating each aspect of the production
process.
At KPIX, Kelly said she enjoys working as an anchor more
than her three-davs-a-week position as a reporter, noting
that the anchors have a less physically grueling day and earn
more monev.
