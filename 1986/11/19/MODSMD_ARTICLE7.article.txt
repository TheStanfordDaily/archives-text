Scandal triggers Dow plummet
WASHINGTON — The stock market plummeted yesterday in a broad
cnain reaction of selling triggered by the Ivan Boesky scandal.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 43-31 points, or 2.33 percent,
to 1,817. It was the fourth-largest drop on record and the steepest daily
decline since an 87-point plunge two months ago.
The market fell in stages, as a broad sell-off of blue chip stocks appeared
to prompt a surge of further selling by computerized trading programs.
The tailspin began with a decline in some major stocks that are targets or
likely targets of takeover activity, such as Gillette Co., Federated Depart
ment Stores, Winn-Dixie Stores Inc. and Lockheed Corp.
The disgrace of Boesky, Wall Street's most active securities speculator
and an important force in corporate takeovers, has seeded fears that
takeover activity may slow down, market analysts said.
Last Friday, Boesky agreed to forfeit $100 million in penalties from il
legal insider trading. Yesterday, Wall Street was staggered by reports that
Boesky has furnished investigators with recordings of conversations with
his associates and contacts.
On Monday, news media reports revealed that the government's investi
gation of illegal insider trading by Boesky has expanded to include an in
quiry aimed at Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., one of Wall Street's most im
portant brokerage and investment banking firms.
Seoul claims N. Korean mutiny
SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea moved yesterday to counter embar
rassment over its incorrect claims that President Kim 11 Sung of North
Korea was probably dead and insisted the evidence suggests that a serious
political upheaval has occurred there.
To support their case, officials in Seoul released details of announce
ments of Kim's death that they said were made by North Korean
loudspeakers at the frontier. The messages continued yesterday morning,
they said, even while the 74-year-old leader was preparing to greet foreign
dignitaries at the airport of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
In Seoul, analysts continued to speculate that part of the North Korean
Army had mutinied and tried to depose Kim or block his passing of power
to his son, Kim Chong U.
The South Korean government also suggested the announcements could
be part of "a sophisticated form of psychological warfare" against the
South. The purpose might be to test its reaction or distract its attention,
sources said.
In a telephone interview last night, presidential spokesman Lee Jong
Ryool defended the government's action.
"We just reported the facts," he said. The loudspeaker activity "was a very
unusual thing. The government thought the people should know about it."
Some South Korean officials also worried that the government's
credibility with the outside world had been damaged. The South has
several times before reported incorrectly that Kim appeared to have died.
Concern was raised that its views on other matters concerning North Korea
will not be taken seriously.
Israel brokered Iranian arms
JERUSALEM — The first secret delivery of arms to Iran authorized by the
White House was brokered through an Israeli arms dealer to senior Iranian
Army officers embroiled in a power struggle with radical Revolutionary
Guards, according to knowledgeable Israeli sources.
The Israeli sources, who insisted on anonymity, contended that Israel's
role in the Iranian connection was merely that of a messenger, shuttling
between Iranian contacts in Europe and the White House. But analysts here
also contended that Jerusalem won an important policy victory in persuad
ing the White House to adopt the Israeli view that Iran is a state of crucial
geopolitical importance that should be cultivated and dealt with even while
under the rule of a hostile fundamentalist Moslem regime.
Public exposure of the secret arms connection has led to a closing of
contacts that the Israelis hope is temporary, sources said. They said they
fear that by sending former national security adviser Robert McFarlane to
Tehran, the White House overplayed its hand and caused the exposure by
Iranian radicals seeking to sabotage any rapprochement with Washington.
There is also a fear, according to a few observers, that Israel com
promised its sovereignty by allowing itself to be used by the White House
to bypass both the Pentagon and the CIA. "It's like Israel has become just
another federal agency, one that's convenient to use when you want some
thing done quietly," one analyst said.
Israeli analysts generally look at the Iranian connection as a valid policy
vindicated by U.S. involvement.
But some analysts contend that there are two ways the Iranian connec
tion could backfire politically on Israel: first, if Israeli arms end up in the
hands of Shiite Moslem fighters in southern Lebanon, where the Iranian
backed Hezbollah is doing battle with Israeli troops; and second, if expo
sure of the connection leads to violence against the 30,000 Jews that Israeli
officials say still live in Iran.
GM strike ends unresolved
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The three-week strike at the General
Motors Corp. plant in Port Elizabeth ended yesterday but without resolu
tion of the main issues stemming from the American automaker's plans to
sell its South African subsidiary to local managers.
Despite clashes between the strikers and whip-wielding police Monday
outside the plant gates, the workers' return yesterday was peaceful. Offi
cials of the National Automobile and Allied Workers' Union, however, des
cribed their members as angry and bitter over GM's request for police in
tervention.
The workers' demands for full severance pay for all workers and for the
transfer of their pension funds to South Africa will be submitted to arbitra
tion, as requested by the union, in the next month. Management of the new
company will also consider a request for union representation on its board
of directors.
In forcing the showdown with the union yesterday, GM believed it was
fighting to preserve the deal in which local managers would take over its
South African subsidiary rather than close the operation down.
"No company can afford to give in to irrational and irresponsible
demands," Stegmann commented. "What we were dealing with involved
ideological and political issues obviously issues that other companies in
this country will have to face and deal with."
Army needs to economize
WASHINGTON — The Army needs at least $100 billion more to finish its
current modernization program and must cancel and stretch programs in
this decade to avoid chaos in the 19905, Undersecretary of the Army James
Ambrose said yesterday.
I his first public alarm in the new budget season by a top Defense De
partment official comes as planners for each of the services are determin
ing that they have started more projects than can be funded in zero-growth
defense budgets on the horizon.
The shortfall stems not only from congressional budget cuts but also
from administration underfunding of President Reagan s huge defense
buildup started in 1981, according to internal Pentagon studies.
Ambrose's prescription for Army belt-tightening in what he termed
acquisition, as distinct from paying trtxjps, would mean stretching pur
chases of tanks, canceling marginal programs before they run into big
money, buying less ammunition for reserves and delaying such big-ticket
items as the prized light helicopter.
He said his purpose is not to lobby Congress for more funds but to per
suade the defense establishment to adjust to new budget realities.
Meanwhile, Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller 111
told reporters that he favored asking Congress for a defense-spending in
crease of 3 percent plus inflation in fiscal 1988, using $289 billion ap
propriated by Congress for this year as the base.
