# CIA involved in Iran dealings

WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration's se
cret overtures and arms shipments to Iran are pan of
a seven-year-long pattern of covert Central Intelli
gence Agency operations — some dating back to the
Carter administration — that were designed both to
curry favor with the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini and to support Iranian exiles who seek to
overthrow it, according to informed sources.
In 1983, for example, the CIA participated in a se
cret operation to provide a list of Soviet KGB agents
and collaborators operating in Iran to the Khomeini
regime, which then executed up to 200 suspects and
closed down the communist Tudeh party in Iran, ac
tions that dealt a major blow to KGB operations and
Soviet influence there, the sources said. Khomeini
also expelled 18 Soviet diplomats, imprisoned the
Tudeh party leaders and publicly thanked God for
"the miracle" leading to the arrests of the
"treasonous leaders."
At the same time, secret presidential intelligence
orders, called "findings," authorized the CIA to sup
port Iranian exiles opposed to the Khomeini regime,
the sources said. These included providing nearly $6
million to the main Iranian exile movement, financ
ing an anti-Khomeini exile group radio station in
Egypt and supplying a miniaturized television trans
mitter for an 11-minute clandestine broadcast to Iran
two months ago by Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late

Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who vowed, "I will
return."
One well-placed intelligence source said that this
support of the anti-Khomeini exile movement is "just
one level above (intelligence) collection," and that
the money involved was equivalent to the "walking
around money" frequently distributed in American
political campaigns. Administration officials stressed
that the CIA operations are not intended to bring
about Khomeini's downfall but are aimed primarily
at obtaining intelligence about his regime through
the exile groups.
The White House and administration spokesmen
declined to comment on these CIA operations. Vice
Adm. John Poindexter, the president's national secur
ity affairs adviser, told a television interviewer Sun
day that "I don't want to confirm or deny any other
operations" and added that "we aren't seeking the
overthrow of the Khomeini regime."
Press and broadcast reports from Iran have
repeatedly accused the U.S. government of backing
anti-Khomeimi exile activities. Informed sources said
that the Khomeimi regime knows many of the details
of the CIA operations because it has agents inside the
Iranian exile groups.
Some of the Iranian exiles in Paris said it is well
known within their groups that they have received
CIA money. Sources also said that some of the CIA

money was used to speculate in currency markets in
Switzerland.
Administration sources said that all CIA programs
concerning Iran have been designed with several ob
jectives: to build bridges to potential Iranian leaders,
to use the exiles for information about what is hap
pening in Iran, to develop independent intelligence
sources, to win friends, to diminish Soviet influence
and to keep pressure on the Khomeini regime by
demonstrating that the exile and dissident opposi
tion is active.
Iran is strategically vital because of its oil supplies,
warm-water ports on the Persian Gulf and proximity
to the Soviet Union. Iran's political turbulence and
the possibility that one of the exile groups could
some day assume power justifies a U.S. strategy that
proceeds on several tracks, according to several ad
ministration officials, and that view is shared by some
former U.S. intelligence officers.
"I have no knowledge that the Reagan administra
tion is giving money to the Iranian exile groups, but I
see no reason not to give them money and at the
same time extend a hand to Khomeini," Stansfield
Turner, CIA director in the Carter administration,
said Monday. "Playing both sides of the fence is not
unusual, as long as they did not fund any exile group
to the extent that they would try to overthrow the
(Khomeini) government.
