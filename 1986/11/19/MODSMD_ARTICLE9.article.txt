# Reagan changes arms objectives

### 
WASHINGTON — In a speech last
night, President Reagan dropped as a
priority for nuclear-arms negotiations
the proposal he made at the Reykjavik
summit to eliminate all ballistic
missiles, a further indication that the
United States is backing away from that
controversial idea under pressure
from its NATO allies and domestic crit
ics.
Speaking at a dinner at the Washing
ton Hilton, Reagan listed four priorities
for arms-control talks that he said he
had agreed on last weekend with
British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher: a 50 percent cut in strategic
nuclear forces; "sweeping" cuts in
intermediate-range missiles in Europe
and Asia; a ban on chemical weapons;
and "addressing" conventional-force
imbalances.
The omission of his proposal to
eliminate all ballistic missiles — made
to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in
the final session of the Iceland summit
— marked an apparent victory for
allied leaders, members of Congress

and administration officials, including
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had
voiced strong opposition to the idea.
Thatcher indicated satisfaction with
the shift in emphasis in American
policy in London yesterday.
Reagan's remarks were the latest in
dication of second thoughts within the
administration over the proposal. Sec
retary of State George Shultz suggested
Monday that a small ballistic-missile
force be retained as an "insurance
policy" against cheating.
White House officials said yesterday
the Shultz comment was approved by
the president. They said the proposal
to eliminate all ballistic missiles would
remain on the bargaining table in
Geneva, but Shultz was offering a
hypothetical example of a possible
change.
Reagan said last night, without refer
ring specifically to the proposal, that
"all our proposals" from Iceland "are
still on the table, and we see no reason
that our negotiating teams shouldn't
pick up where we left off."

Reagan first broached the idea of
eventually eliminating all ballistic
missiles in his July 25 letter to Gorba
chev. In Reykjavik, Reagan proposed
that the missiles be wiped out in 10
years; the Soviets countered with a
proposal to eliminate all strategic
forces — including bombers and air
launched cruise missiles, a suggestion
Reagan evidently accepted. Both plans
died when Reagan and Gorbachev
could not agree on what type of testing
should be allowed on Reagan's Strate
gic Defense Initiative research pro
gram during those 10 years or what
would happen to SDI afterward.
The idea of eliminating all ballistic
missiles was conceived by a small
group of Reagan advisers and was not
seriously studied by senior military
and arms-control specialists.
The allies have expressed concern
that without ballistic missiles they
would face a large Soviet advantage in
conventional forces. Many of the allies
also fear the political and psychologi
cal impact of removing all of the Amer

ican intermediate-range missiles that
were deployed in Europe since 1983
after a prolonged political battle.
Since Reykjavik, the administration
appears to have been slowly backing
away from the Reagan proposal while
still saying it was on the bargaining
table.
After listing his priorities last night
and omitting the ballistic-missile idea,
Reagan said, "America will go into
those talks with the support of our
allies, and, I hope, the support of
Congress as well.
Administration officials said the
chief emphasis by the United States
now will be on achieving agreement
on reductions in intermediate-range
forces in Europe and Asia. In Iceland,
Reagan accepted a Gorbachev pro
posal to wipe out the missiles in
Europe and permit only 100 Soviet
warheads in Asia and an equivalent
number in the United States.
