# Kodak withdraws from S. Africa

### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —
Eastman Kodak Co., the world's largest
maker of film and photographic equip
ment, announced yesterday that it was
pulling out of South Africa, saying that
it could "not see with any certainty a
time when South Africa will he free
from apartheid."
Kodak said it was not only selling all
its assets here and laying off its 466
employees, but that it was also
withdrawing its products entirely from
the South African market in the most
dramatic American business pullout
yet from the country.
Colby Chandler, Kodak's chairman,
said that the principal reason for his
company's decision to join other major
American companies in leaving the
strife-torn nation was the failure of the
white-led, minority government here
to end apartheid.

"We had hoped that by now the
signs in South Africa concerning plans
to dismantle statutory apartheid would
be clear," Chandler said in a statement
released from Kodak's corporate
headquarters in Rochester, N.Y.
"Unfortunately, we cannot see with any
certainty a time when South Africa will
be free from apartheid.
"The implication of that situation is a
degree of business risk that we do not
consider prudent, and we have thus
concluded with reluctance that Kodak
should withdraw from that troubled
country."
Kodak's action, a total pullout, goes
significantly further than the
withdrawals announced recently by
General Motors, IBM, Coca-Cola, Gen
eral Electric, Procter and Gamble, GTE,
Warner Communications, Bell &
Howell and more than 20 other Ameri

can companies, which ensured that
their products would remain on the
South African market through licens
ing arrangements with their former
subsidiaries.
No Kodak products will be shipped
to South Africa after April 30, the com
pany said, and the ban will be ob
served by all its subsidiaries and af
filiates worldwide.
Kodak's computer subsidiary, Atex
Inc., whose equipment and programs
are used by most major South African
newspapers, said in a statement in Bed
ford, Mass., that it would also pull out
by April 30.
"We are leaving, period," Kodak
spokesman lan Guthrie said by tele
phone from Rochester. "There will be
no management buy out, no licensing
agreements, no agents appointed to
import and distribute Kodak products,

no lingering or hidden presence, noth
ing at all like that."
Few political condemnations of
President Pieter Botha's limited, step
by-step reforms and the American
policy of constructive engagement
were as damning as the comments by
the once-optimistic Kodak manage
ment. The South African government,
taken aback by the harshness of the
company's criticism, had no immediate
response yesterday.
Kodak will be the 70th U.S. company
to withdraw from South Africa since
January 1985; as many as a quarter of
the 240 companies remaining are des
cribed by well-informed business
sources as very close to decisions to
pull out, perhaps in the next two to
three months.
