The Graduate School of Business
has started two new programs that
will enhance its faculty's overseas
research opportunities, especially
in Japan and other Pacific Rim
countries.
The Program in International Re
search and Teaching will encourage
and help coordinate the efforts of
faculty who are interested in global
issues, according to Director
Gerald Meier, a Konosuke Matsu
shita professor of international eco
nomics and policy analysis at the
business school.
Professors will be especially en
couraged to study the Pacific Rim
countries, which include Japan, Sin
gapore, South Korea, Taiwan and
Hong Kong.
The second program will be a se
ries of annual academic confer
ences to be held by business school
faculty and members of the com
merce faculty at Hitotsubashi Uni
versity in Japan. The first meeting,
which will take place in Tokyo this
March, will examine the roles of

corporations in the United States
and Japan.
Ihe annual conferences will be
coordinated by Prof. David Kreps,
director of the business school's
doctoral program. "A number of
people here at Stanford know
people there (in Japan) quite well,"
he said. "It seemed natural for us to
get together."
The Program in International Re
search and Teaching will begin this
fall with a series of research semi
nars on internatinal topics and will
be open to both faculty and stu
dents at the busines school.
Speakers from MIT, Princeton, and
the World Bank are scheduled to
discuss their work at upcoming
seminars.
These seminars will facilitate the
exchange of information and "allow
for all kinds of creative things to
happen," said Richard Kurovsky,
news director at the business
school.
Kurovsky said increased faculty
research in international areas will
ultimately benefit business students
because the faculty members will teach
more courses on the international
aspects of business. Students have
been "openly advocating" the intro
duction of more internationally ori
ented courses, he said.
One of the main objectives of the
two programs is to spread interna
tional topics throughout the business
school's curriculum instead of con
centrating them in a single interna
tional course or faculty area, according
to Business School Dean Robert
Jaedicke. He noted that this process
has already begun.
"In the past five years, we have in
creased the number of faculty involved
in international study significantly, and
we are seeing the results," Jaedicke
said. "We intend to do even better."
