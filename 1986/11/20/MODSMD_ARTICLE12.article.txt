# 1,500 sign to protest library plans

### EUGENIA LEAN 
More than 1,500 people have signed
a petition protesting plans to construct
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
on a hillside above Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
University President Donald Ken
nedy is scheduled to report on the li
brary's facilities, access and use at
today's Faculty Senate meeting. Last
month, Kennedy told the senate that
changing the library site was not a pos
sibility.
Petition organizer Sam Brain said
the petition will not be presented at
the senate meeting.
Brain, a senior research associate in
radiology, said the protest is non
political. He said the library will bring
construction, traffic and visitors that
will "detract from the tranquility and
special nature of the hill."
The signatures were gathered near
the library site, according to Cedith
Copenhever of the Department of Im
munology. Copenhaver, an organizer
of the petition drive, said petitioners
solicited joggers, hikers, bicyclists and
others using the hill that is located
south and west of Lake Lagunita.
The petition, also organized by
Laura Esserman, resident in surgery,
charges that "conditions on Junipero
Serra Boulevard already present
serious dangers to joggers, bicyclists

and hikers, and the library traffic on
the currently preferred access route
will seriously aggravate this hazardous
situation."
The petition urges the Stanford
Board of Trustees to seriously consider
moving the library' to a site proposed
for a conference center and hotel area
â€” near the intersection of Interstate
280 and Sand Hill Road.
On Oct. 30, Kennedy told the Faculty
Senate that such a change was "not a
possibility."
Furthermore, the petition says the
350-seat auditorium "the inclusion of
an upper story (second floor) for en
tertaining and other non-library uses
suggest that more than a library
resource for scholars is desired by the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Founda
tion."
The library's conference and lecture
facilities will invite more people and
will lead to further disruption of the
quiet nature of the hill, Brain said.
Charles Palm, Hoover Institution ar
chivist and campus representative of
the Reagan Presidential Foundation,
which will fund the library's construc
tion, said the foundation "does not
want anything more than other presi
dential libraries in providing for other
academic functions."
In response to the petition, Paha
said the decision about the site was
made by the Stanford Board of Trus

tees in February 1985 after a year and a
half of research and discussion.
Once the trustees agreed to the deci
sion, the choice was offered to Presi
dent Reagan and the White House. The
White House approved the decision.
Palm said that in order to grant the pe
tition's requests, Stanford would have
to undo the decision that has already
been approved by the White House.
Palm said the library should be near
the central campus because its pur
pose is to make the presidential papers
available to the Stanford community.
Since the petitioners only started
collecting signatures two weeks ago,
Brain said he does not believe that the
petition will make a big difference.
The petitioners hope to collect a few
hundred more signatures in White
Plaza this week, but their plans for the
future are uncertain.

Brain hopes that the petitions will at
least "increase community conscious
ness which may lead the University
to reconsider the decision."
Earlier senate sessions have in
cluded criticism of plans for including
the auditorium.
All the other presidential libraries
have modest conference and lecture
series," Palm noted. Campus visits by
Stanford professors and officials to the
University of Michigan, which houses
the Gerald Ford Presidential Library,
showed that the faculty there was
particularly pleased with the presi
dential libraries."
"We want to include space for such
conferences .. (suitable for) five or
six events a year," Palm said. These
might include two scholarly confer
ences related to the library holdings
and visits by the former president.
