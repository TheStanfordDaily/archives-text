Is there a negative bias in Asian-American admissions
at Stanford?
Although the answer recently given in the annual
report of the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aids is mixed and unclear, two statistics
stand out: Asian-American applicants are admitted to
Stanford at a rate consistently lower than that for white
applicants; and Asian-Americans are admitted to Stanford
in numbers proportionally larger than their representa
tion in the U.S. population.
The crucial fact is that while there is a higher
percentage of Asian-Americans at Stanford than in the
outside world, Asian-Americans are granted admission at
a much lower rate than whites.
A subcommittee found that academic ratings, choice of
major and overrepresentation of whites among
privileged groups such as alumni families, faculty/staff
children and athletes did not account for this difference
in admission rates.
It concluded that there is no implicit quota or
evidence of conscious bias on the part of the admissions
staff, and the CUAFA wrote in its 1985-86 report:
"The remaining alternatives, which do not yield easily
to numerical analysis, are that real differences may exist
among Asian-Americans and whites in the subjective data
on which admissions decisions are based, and/or that
unconscious biases have influenced admissions deci
sions
"Real differences would mean that a completely
neutral ethnic-blind evaluator would detect significant
differences in features of the letters, essays, etc., of the
two groups.... Alternatively, or in addition, ethnic
stereotyping might interact with subjective ratings in the
minds of readers to create an aggregate portrait that is
unintentionally detrimental to Asian-Americans."

The data indicates that a negative bias does exist in the
admission rates, and the committee strongly suggests
that the bias is the result of unconscious yet detrimental
attitudes — held by high school teachers and counselors,
the applicants themselves or the admissions staff — re
garding Asian-Americans.
In a society where prejudices are rampant and
stereotypes often held as truth, it is not surprising that
even Stanford is susceptible to the effects of racism.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter told
the Faculty Senate that she does not believe there is a
conscious bias among her staff: "Admissions officers are
devoted human beings — who are fallible."
But while admissions officers may not be responsible
for the apparent discrimination, they do have the respon
sibility of stamping it out.
So far, the University seems to be giving the issue
serious consideration:
• The Faculty Senate affirmed last week that it is Stan
ford's policy not to discriminate against Asian-Americans
— or any other ethnic group — in determining under
graduate admissions.
• The training of new admissions officers will include a
session on unconscious stereotyping, especially of Asian-
Americans, and the University will tell high schools of
the possibility of unconscious stereotyping in letters of
recommendation.
• Admissions data on Asian-American applicants and
comparisons with data on white applicants will be an
nually reviewed and analyzed for evidences of bias.
Despite the uncomfortable information revealed by
the CUAFA investigation, the University extends the
promise that it will do all it can to enforce its non
discrimination policy in undergraduate admissions.
For the sake of equality, that promise must be kept.
