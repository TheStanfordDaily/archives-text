Letters neglected
views of students
Prof. Ronald Hilton claims that the
opponents of Proposition 63 are
dupes of the Soviet Union as it tries
"to weaken the glue [English] that
holds the American ethnic mosaic
together" (Daily, Oct. 30). It has come
to our attention that some members
of the Stanford community believe
Hilton to represent the views of the
Department of Spanish and Por
tuguese. As graduate students in this
department, we wish to make clear
that Hilton has not taught in the de
partment during the past 10 years, and
he certainly does not speak for us, We
find his comments, tainted with strains
of McCarthyism, inadmissible and
dangerously simplistic. He lacks the
sensitivity necessary to understand the
complexity of the issues.
To speak of the democratic voting
process as "the tyranny of the
minorities," or to categorically label
voters "uninformed people" reflects a
pseudopolitical discourse built on
name-calling that has no place in the
University. His questionable remarks
reveal an ethnocentricity, a false sense
of superiority and a Moscow paranoia
that give a particular irony to his
statement that "such activities [public
demonstrations of opposition to Prop.
63 on university campuses] are trying
to lower our universities to the level
of those of Latin America."
Hilton willfully obscures the com
plexity of the issues relevant to multi
culturalism and multilingualism in
Canada, Belgium, Switzerland and
South Africa. We consider such
pretense of social analysis unprofes
sional, unethical and well below the

standards of any university.
We are appalled at the passage of
Proposition 63 and are very con
cerned about its probable conse
quences. We are afraid that instead of
enabling minorities to learn English, it
will have the opposite effect. Neces
sary funding for programs teaching
English as a second language, already
insufficient, will be further
diminished. While we believe it is
important for minorities to maintain
linguistic and cultural ties, we recog
nize the necessity of their acquisition
of the dominant language of the land
to enable their full participation in the
democratic processes to which they
are entitled.

Some suggestions
for better service
As one of the "incompetent" tellers
taken to task by a student quoted in a
recent article (Daily, Nov. 14), I feel
obliged to to educate the customers of
the Wells Fargo bank as to how they
might facilitate better service.
First, know your account number.
It's only 10 digits, the same as an area
code and phone number. At a mini-

mum service express branch such as
Tresidder, the tellers cannot track
your account number down from
your name, your ATM card or any
other form of identification. Memoriz
ing the number, or even carrying a
slip of paper in your wallet, will save
you and the people behind you in line
a great deal of time. Second, be
prepared when you get to the win
dow; have deposit slips filled out and
ID in hand. Above all, make sure you
have ID. Exceptions are made on
occasion, but don't expect that they
will be.
Most customers are prepared and
cooperative. Unfortunately, it is most
often those who don't take responsi
bility for their own mistakes who
choose to blame the bank. As a cus
tomer service employee, I do my best
to deliver fast, accurate and friendly
service. I do not feel it is too much to
ask for patience and cooperation from
our customers.
