# A 						misguided anti-drug campaign

' Pee in this," the nurse says, as she hands you a

"But why?" you ask.
"Just do it." she says."And don't ask questions.
We're only trying to help you."
"How is this going to help?"
"Trust us. It will."
This may seem like a ridiculous solution to sub
stance abuse to you and me, but not to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The recent
deaths of sport stars Len Bias and Don Rogers have
spurred the growing concern about drug abuse and
have also prompted college and professional officials
to search for new ways to crack down on the illicit in
dulgences of our nation's "exalted role models."
When college athletes returned to their campuses
this year, they found that the NCAA had instituted
mandatory drug testing for all athletes participating
in championship competitions and certified post
season football games.

For the past three years I have been a diver here at
Stanford, but because I would not sign a statement
agreeing to be tested for substance abuse, the NCAA
will no longer allow me to compete. I have no
doubts that 1 would pass this test. I refused because I
believe that the NCAA should not be allowed to sub
ject athletes to such tests.
The NCAA refuses to realize that this requirement
is a violation of athletes' Constitutional rights. It is an
invasion of privacy that blatantly violates the ideal of
the Fourth Amendment, which asserts that Americans
are free from search and seizure without probable

cause. The principle of comparative justice upon
which our legal tradition is based states that "people
should be treated the same if and only if there are no
relevant differences between them." We don't send
all suspected criminals to prison to make sure that
the guilty ones get punished, so why is it OK to test
all athletes to find out which ones are using drugs?
The NCAA program unfairly subjects both the in
nocent and the guilty to intrusive bodily searches in
order to find those who may be using illicit chemical
substances. It is true that people can be legitimately
subjected to various kinds of testing and invasions of
their privacy, but only if there is some reason to
believe that that specific individual is committing an
offense. If there is no objective evidence that an indi
vidual athlete is behaving erratically or using an illicit
substance, it is grossly unfair for him or her to be
subjected to such testing.
The NCAA endeavors to justify its program by
stating that athletes are not being forced to do any
thing. Although it is true that an athlete must sign a
statement before he or she can be tested, failure to
complete the form annually results in the athlete's in
eligibility for participation in all collegiate competi
tions. The NCAA also absurdly assumes that students
dependent on athletic scholarships for their educa
tion have a choice not to sign
The NCAA assertion that the program was imple
mented in the interest of the athlete's health and
safety should also be questioned. If it is truly con
cerned, why does the NCAA s list of more than 300
banned drugs include such over-the-counter drugs
as Vick's cough medicine and more innocuous sub
stances like caffeine? It is very difficult to believe that
these types of drugs are more harmful to athletes
than they are to non-athletes.
The NCAA further contradicts its stated "concern
for athletes by placing a greater emphasis on punish

ment rather than help. Athletes testing positive are
ineligible from competition for 90 days, but nowhere
is there any mention of programs to help those with
serious drug abuse problems. If the NCAA was truly
interested in helping these athletes, it would have es
tablished programs for drug education and
rehabilitation rather than stressing the importance of
punishing the offenders. It fails to realize that drug
testing merely finds out there's something wrong
with an athlete's urine when there's really something
wrong with his head.
The fact is the NCAA has recently found itself with a
serious public relations problem. In fact, it may be in
danger of alienating fans permanently if the percep
tion grows that it is unable or unwilling to tackle the
drug problem. For this reason, the NCAA and big
time university athletic programs are more than will
ing to violate individual rights as long as they can be
sure of preserving their image and increasing their
revenues.
The efforts of the NCAA to appease this national
anxiety without regard for individual rights is a
reflection of the momentum and popularity of the
drug war campaign that is currently sweeping the
country. However, this eagerness to immediately find
solutions to the drug abuse problem becomes dan
gerous because it pressures people to support and
submit to repressive and unconstitutional measures
to which they would not agree in other circum
stances Anyone in the public eye, like an athlete, is a
role model and is therefore expected to conform.
And refusal to submit to the testing implies a pro
drug attitude. But the fact is that to silently acquiesce
and not take a stand against these intrusive measures
is to contribute to the claims that the stepped-up
repression of drug testing is mandated by the people
