# Never fear speaking out

### 
This column is going to be short and to the point. Upon
reading Tuesday's Daily, I was filled with an absolutely won
derful feeling of distress. Distress because on Monday night
I had just finished my column for this week, on — you
guessed it — my reactions to Dr. Ruth's visit. After reading
the full page of responses, I realized that my response was
no longer needed. The complexity of the issue had been
much better stated by Uprising, Megan Swezey, Alice Sup
ton, et al.
But once I put my hurt ego to rest, 1 realized how
positively wonderful the situation was. At last the Stanford
community was responding in full force to an issue that di
rectly affects us all. At last open discussion was being
generated on some topics usually not covered in a public
form. At last, Stanford students were not being apathetic. At
last, we have been shown the possibility of what The Daily's
Opinions page can be.

I am sure there were people aghast at the notion that a
whole page of The Daily was used to talk about Dr. Ruth,
contraception, date rape and women's roles, just as there
were people shocked at the idea of paying $7,500 to bring
Dr. Ruth here in the first place (and just as there were
people who could not believe so much time and space was
alloted to discussing the "Women of Stanford" calendar).
People often seem much more concerned about issues in
which they are not directly implicated. Stanford students in
particular, when they feel like being intellectual, often place
greater value in talking about Nicaragua or President Reagan
than they do in talking about sex or sexuality or — in a
broader sense — any issue that directly concerns the in
herent problems in the setup of our society.
The assumption here is one of high-brow elitism, that as
members of an intellectual community we are above those
more mundane, day-to-day issues. Perhaps in an ideal com
munity where sexism, abortion and rape did not occur so
regularly this would be true. The problem lies in the fact
that there are more than 150 cases of unwanted pregnancies
reported by the Cowell Student Health Center each year.
The most recent estimate is that five Stanford women per
week will test positive to a pregnancy test administered by
Cowell. And this is just at Cowell. Most of the people I talked
with at Cowell said it would be safe to assume that at least as
many women go somewhere other than Cowell for a preg
nancy test. Since the number of Stanford students who are
also mothers is incredibly low, it appears from the estimates
that there may be at least 300 cases of abortion per year at
Stanford. Stanford students clearly are not above learning
about contraception.
Now many would probably agree to what was just said but
would still contest that the money paid for Dr. Ruth's visit
could have been spent in more effective ways. Such as? The
Contraceptive Information Center (CIC) has worked very
hard to increase contraceptive awareness, through its dorm
outreaches, classes and afternoon hours, yet relatively few

Some real good can come
from this if we are willing to
keep the discussion open.

take advantage of the knowledge (and the inexpensive con
doms and sponges) available through the CIC. The Rape
Education Project (REP) also works hard to increase the
level of awareness of Stanford students about the com
plexities of male/female relationships, yet for the handful of
people actively involved in the REP, there are hundreds who
would just as soon go to firesides, full moon parties or
screw-your-roommate parties. Less money could have been
spent on a speaker that was more informed than Dr. Ruth,
that was more aware of the complexity of sexual relation
ships, but how many would have gone? If nothing else, Dr.
Ruth's visit has made it possible to talk openly about these
issues.
Yes, I think Dr. Ruth was dangerously wrong on the prob
lem of date rape. Yes, I agree with Uprising that the ideal of
femininity is a product of male society, that the entrance of
women into every conceivable sphere of the workforce has
concealed the dehumanization that women are continually
facing, but at least now we seem to be open to talking about
all of these issues. Some real good can come from this if we
are willing to keep the discussion open.
And please don't limit what I am saying to sex and
sexuality. We must be more open to discussion on all sub
jects, whether they are traditionally defined as sensitive or
not. I hear more people complaining about the super
ficiality of their relationships, the poor quality of The Dally,
something a professor or student has said, yet they do noth
ing about it.
I see the apathy in myself. Sitting in class, I am scared to
raise my hand, worried about what other people will think
of me. In my silence, I am allowed to feel that I am OK, that I
have offended no one, that everyone still "likes" me. Yet
what kind of a false sense of self-esteem is that?
I see people doing things I think are hurting others,
saying things I think are hurting others, and I remain silent.
I keep doing and saying things in my own life that I'm not
happy about, simply because in a social context it is the
easiest way to be. Sociability, then, is society's worse ail
ment. Sociability ignores fundamental human concerns,
pretending that in this often callous world we are still able
to talk to each other, not realizing that the superficial,
amiable remark continues to perpetuate the silence.
Please, Stanford, I challenge you to challenge yourselves.
Continue this discussion about Dr. Ruth, taking it "to a
higher level." Stan new discussions. Speak out. As Thomas
Huxley said, "The great end in life is not knowledge, but ac
tion." Listen to other people's opinions. Be bold and state
your own. Yet remember that any kind of heightened aware
ness is a process, not a goal; you'll never stop learning as
long as you keep looking in toward yourself and keep listen
ing — openly — to others.
To close with the words of the poet Audrey Lord, "It is
better to speak, remembering that we were never meant to
survive."
