# Band will perform on the field at Big Game

### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
The Band will be allowed to play on the field at Big Game
and at the Coca-Cola and Gator Bowls â€” provided it
remains alcohol-free before and during the game, Athletic
Director Andy Geiger announced yesterday.
The Band wil l be flown all expenses paid to Jacksonville,
Fla., to play in both a parade and the Gator Bowl, said Band
Manager Jeff Stevens. The game will be televised nationally.
The emphasis on alcohol abuse is not new, Geiger said.
"It's become clear that alcohol was a big part of the cause
(of the Band's past problems)," he said.
On Monday, the Band submitted a charter and a set of
guidelines for its behavior to Geiger for review. In the
guidelines, the Band proposed to de-emphasize alcohol
through self-regulation.
But the decision to allow the Band to play for the
remainder of the season came only after the Band agreed to
remain completely dry.
"From the day that Andy (Geiger) put the suspension on
the Band, alcohol has been one of the major focuses of the
Band's problem," Stevens said.
Geiger said it is not unreasonable to ask the Band to
remain sober. "They are a creature of this department," he
said, "and they represent this department and this Univer
sity when they march on the field."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons commented: "I'm

glad they're going to be at the game. Having the Band at
football games is part of football games."
Lyons said the Band had become too relaxed about its
music, its organization and its planning. "It looks to me like
they're going to work on that in the future, and 1 think that s
good," he said.
"I think that probably if they're going to be dry, that
means they're going to be better because when they re
good they're really good," Lyons added.
"I don't think that the things they did are normally in the
repertoire," Lyons continued, "I don't think that (alcohol)
was the only problem, but 1 think that was a large part of it
But the Band expressed disappointment that the Univer
sity did not give it the chance to regulate itself.
A Band press release said, "The Band is disappointed that
the University has demonstrated a lack of faith in the Band's
ability to solve the present problems on its own."
Stevens explained that the Band originally thought its sit
uation similar to that of the fraternities, which were allowed
to police their own behavior with guidelines similar to the
Band's charter.
"Now they (the University administration) haven't given
us an opportunity to implement those guidelines or even
negotiate the possibility of those being effective (without
external regulation)," said Stevens.
Whether the alcohol-free policy will extend beyond the
next three games remains an open issue, Stevens said.
"I really don't know what, the future of the Band is going

to be on this issue, but we really didn't want to have this
issue decided in one night. We wanted to have a chance to
discuss it," Stevens said.
Meetings will be held later to discuss the issue with every
one involved, Stevens said. "This is an ongoing process.
We're not anywhere near finished.
"At this point, the most important thing is performing,"
Stevens said. "That's what we're here for."
An advisory committee that was provided for in the
Band's charter will discuss future policy for the Band, said

Geiger. However, Stevens said, "The more Andy (Geiger)
talks, the more I think he has a different perception of it (the
advisory committee) than we do."
According to Stevens, the Band sees the advisory commit
tee as primarily a tool for getting opinions and imput on
potentially controversial show ideas from representatives of
the Athletic Department, the faculty and the students.
The charter was simply meant to be a working draft, em
phasized Stevens.
