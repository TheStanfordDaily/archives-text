## Athletics needs a financial shape up 
### SEAN KINCH Staff writer 
The Athletic Department is faced
with difficult financial problems that
may force the elimination of some
sports from the athletic program, ac
cording to officials within the depart
ment.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger em
phasized that the financial problems
were complicated and were largely
due to the fact that the Athletic Depart
ment's income is unable to keep up
with its rising expenditures.
"First of all, let me say that this is a
very, very complex subject," he said.
"But basically our costs are inflating
faster than our income, and our debts
are accumulating."
To solve its financial problems, the
Athletic Department will have to
generate a great deal of income from
individuals in the Stanford community
or it will have to cut some sports from
the program, according to Geiger.
Alan Cummings, senior associate
director of athletics, said the major ex
penditures of the department are fin
ancial aid, salaries and other benefits.
He said this year's budget calls for $4.7
million in aid for athletes and roughly

$6 million for salaries and benefits out
of a total budget of around $17 million.
These figures represent a 6-7 per
cent increase from the previous year,
and there is reason to believe that
those costs will continue to increase at
a similar rate for the immediate years
to come, Cummings said.
Geiger stressed that on top of these

$PORT$

obvious costs, the simple maintenance
of the Athletic Department buildings
and property — about 300-350 acres
total — puts a strain on its budget.
"When the hedges outside (Athletic
Department buildings) have to
clipped, we have to pay for it,"he said.
Adding to its problems, Geiger
pointed out, the Athletic Department's
income from ticket sales has not been
as lucrative as it had planned.
"We are a little behind our projec
tion in ticket sales," he said. "But we
are a little ahead of our projection in
television revenue."

Cummings added that the Athletic
Department probably has the most dif
ficult task of any Stanford department
in trying to predict its income because
"it could depend on the weather on a
given Saturday."
Monetary gifts from outside donors,
the other major source of income for
the department, have not been large
enough to compensate for the financial
drains, Geiger said, adding quickly that
a successful football season cannot
cure all of the department's financial
problems.
"We are doing great with the foot
ball program, but it does not create a
bonanza," he stated.
Geiger said the goal of the Athletic
Department is to provide a broad
based program that can field competi
tive teams on the most elite level, as
well as providing opportunities for ath
letes on a less competitive level.
Cummings agrees with Geiger's
goal, but he fears that such a program
will prohibit the department from ever
solving its financial problems.
"We are concerned that if we con
tinue to try to support the level of pro
gram that we have now that there will
be an ever-increasing gap between ex
penses and income sources," he said.

"To continue to raise enough revenue
we will have to intensify our marketing
and promotional efforts.
If those efforts do not generate the
necessary revenue, however, Cum
mings fears that there might have to be
some cuts in the Athletic Department.
He said department officials do not
want to eliminate any programs or
sports, but there may still be changes
in the program.
"We are working with the University
to find joint solutions," he said. We
are trying to negotiate a settlement
with the University to share the finan
cial responsibilty."
Geiger said that his decision this
year to demote women's softball from
a varsity sport to a club sport was due
to practical financial concerns.
He said that after he made softball a
varsity sport two years ago, he soon
found that for the program to be com
petitive it would take a huge financial
commitment that the department
simply could not afford.
The department cannot allow its fin
ancial problems to continue to grow
unchecked, said Cummings, adding
that "the pressure is beginning to
mount" to find some real solutions.

and promotional efforts.
If those efforts do not generate the
necessary revenue, however, Cum
mings fears that there might have to be
some cuts in the Athletic Department.
He said department officials do not
want to eliminate any programs or
sports, but there may still be changes
in the program.
"We are working with the University
to find joint solutions," he said. We
are trying to negotiate a settlement
with the University to share the finan
cial responsibilty."
Geiger said that his decision this
year to demote women's softball from
a varsity sport to a club sport was due
to practical financial concerns.
He said that after he made softball a
varsity sport two years ago, he soon
found that for the program to be com
petitive it would take a huge financial
commitment that the department
simply could not afford.
The department cannot allow its fin
ancial problems to continue to grow
unchecked, said Cummings, adding
that "the pressure is beginning to
mount" to find some real solutions.
