# Card cans Cal in promo bowl
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
It's a bad day for you in 1959.
Mouth tasting of cotton from the
one-too-many skinfuls last night at
the Bonfire, you stumble bleary
eyed into the lounge and fall face
forward on the front page of The
Daily.
The top half of page one is a car

toon drawn expressly for The Daily
by a nationally syndicated car
toonist. The cartoon typifies '50s
humor: blatant, sexist and racist and
not terribly funny. For instance, an
Indian rope climber is shown shin
nying up his rope and a student
below says: "These foreign students
have an unfair advantage."
Below the cartoon is a two-inch high
banner headline: "GOOD GRIEF! BIG
GAME!"
At the bottom of the page are the
rosters of the Cal and Stanford teams,
flanked by two photographs. The left
photograph shows the Stanford foot
ball team captain in a rushing pose.
The right photograph is captioned,
"Cal's Secret Weapon — These Big
Games don't worry me,' " and shows a
player in a Cal uniform with Alfred E.
Neuman's head.

History
. . .1986

Those days are gone, but the promo
tion of the Big Game is still a big busi
ness. The Stanford Axe Committee has
a $24,500 budget for this year's game.
Their counterparts at UC-Berkeley, the
Rally Committee and the Californians,
will spend a total of $21,000 on Big
Game Week activities. In human terms,
then, the schools will spend about 70
hype-cents for each of the 80,000 spec
tators expected to show up for this
year's Big Game.
Compared to past years, the 70 cents
represents a princely sum. Three years
ago, the Axe Committee spent $7,000
while the corresponding Cal commit
tees shelled out $11,000, the total of
which breaks down to 25 hype-cents
per spectator.
In the time it took the cost of promo

tion to triple, ticket prices rose from
$20 to $22 — an increase of 10 per
cent.
By comparison, the Stunt Commit
tee, an ancestor of the Axe Committee,
spent $132.25 on the 1920 Big Game.
Assuming that Cal spent a similar
amount, the hype cost a penny and a
half per onlooker. Tickets, at that time,
cost $5.
The primary culprit, at least in the
past few years, in the promotions cost
increases seer.' > to be that more things
cost money.
"Back then, we didn't have to pay for
a lot of things that we do now," said Cal
Rally Committee Chairwoman Tina
Hoppi. For instance, the Greek
Theater, where the committee spon
sors the Big Game rally, changed
ownership several years ago and
started to charge a rental fee.
In addition, new events are being
sponsored by the committees. "A lot of
times, the Axe Committee takes a tradi
tion and brings it back," said senior Mi
chael Tuchin, the committee chairman.
He noted that the Lake Lagunita
Bonfire and the march through San
Francisco were both added to the com
mittee's curriculum in the past several
years, which increased costs tremen
dously.
One big non-spender in the entire
promotional campaign is the Stanford
Athletic Department. Promoting home
football games and season tickets costs
about $25,000 yearly, according to the
figures supplied by the department.
However, none of this money is tar
geted specifically for Big Game.
Jim Colton, the director of market
ing for the department, believes that
the Big Game is not worth promoting.
"It's one of those rare occasions in
sports where the event sells itself," he

said. "It'd be throwing good money
after bad; it's such an emotional game
for the Bay Area, really for the entire
West Coast, we don't need to spend the
money." The Big Game proceeds are
split evenly between Berkeley and
Stanford — approximately $700,000
for each school.
Big Game has also gotten quite a few
free plugs from The Daily. Until 1960,
the Daily annually ran an edition totally
devoted to Big Game a day before the
event.
Of course, the hype was not univer
sally appreciated.
"In Friday's Daily, the motto under

the flag read, 'The Peninsula's Only
Morning Newspaper.' Where was the
news?" wrote one reader irritated by
the 1959 Big Game edition. "On those
frequent occasions when you Find it
necessary to suspend the reporting of
all or almost all news of national and
international interest, shouldn't you,
strictly speaking, call your publication
by another name?"
Strangely, The Daily then broke a
half-century-old tradition by dropping
the Big Game edition soon after that
letter. The reasons seemed to be partly
due to reader dislike, partly due to na
tional events. For instance, the 1963

Big Game was postponed for a week
by the assassination of President John
F. Kennedy, canceling aie Big Game
edition of The Daily altogether.
It wasn't until another event of na
tional import — the police raid of The
Daily in 1971 — that football editions
began to surface again, according to
Charlie Hoffman, the editor-in-chief in
1973- After the raid, the then-editors
did a study of what readers wanted
from The Daily.
"We started looking at it as a busi
ness," he said, and a football supple
ment made good business sense.
"They (the students) didn't want to

buy the program (sold by the Athletic
Dept.)," Hoffman continued. "They just
wanted a simple roster."
So in 1972, the football supplement
to The Daily appeared at every home
football game, a publication that would
eventually become the Cardinal Today.
As costs continue to climb and as
new events are added to the pre-Big
Game festivities, the price of hype can
be expected to increase. So why have it
at all?
"We try to create a general feeling
on campus to support the football
team and to have a good time," said
Tuchin. At those prices, why not?

History
. . .1986

Those days are gone, but the promo
tion of the Big Game is still a big busi
ness. The Stanford Axe Committee has
a $24,500 budget for this year's game.
Their counterparts at UC-Berkeley, the
Rally Committee and the Californians,
will spend a total of $21,000 on Big
Game Week activities. In human terms,
then, the schools will spend about 70
hype-cents for each of the 80,000 spec
tators expected to show up for this
year's Big Game.
Compared to past years, the 70 cents
represents a princely sum. Three years
ago, the Axe Committee spent $7,000
while the corresponding Cal commit
tees shelled out $11,000, the total of
which breaks down to 25 hype-cents
per spectator.
In the time it took the cost of promo

tion to triple, ticket prices rose from
$20 to $22 — an increase of 10 per
cent.
By comparison, the Stunt Commit
tee, an ancestor of the Axe Committee,
spent $132.25 on the 1920 Big Game.
Assuming that Cal spent a similar
amount, the hype cost a penny and a
half per onlooker. Tickets, at that time,
cost $5.
The primary culprit, at least in the
past few years, in the promotions cost
increases seer.' > to be that more things
cost money.
"Back then, we didn't have to pay for
a lot of things that we do now," said Cal
Rally Committee Chairwoman Tina
Hoppi. For instance, the Greek
Theater, where the committee spon
sors the Big Game rally, changed
ownership several years ago and
started to charge a rental fee.
In addition, new events are being
sponsored by the committees. "A lot of
times, the Axe Committee takes a tradi
tion and brings it back," said senior Mi
chael Tuchin, the committee chairman.
He noted that the Lake Lagunita
Bonfire and the march through San
Francisco were both added to the com
mittee's curriculum in the past several
years, which increased costs tremen
dously.
One big non-spender in the entire
promotional campaign is the Stanford
Athletic Department. Promoting home
football games and season tickets costs
about $25,000 yearly, according to the
figures supplied by the department.
However, none of this money is tar
geted specifically for Big Game.
Jim Colton, the director of market
ing for the department, believes that
the Big Game is not worth promoting.
"It's one of those rare occasions in
sports where the event sells itself," he

said. "It'd be throwing good money
after bad; it's such an emotional game
for the Bay Area, really for the entire
West Coast, we don't need to spend the
money." The Big Game proceeds are
split evenly between Berkeley and
Stanford — approximately $700,000
for each school.
Big Game has also gotten quite a few
free plugs from The Daily. Until 1960,
the Daily annually ran an edition totally
devoted to Big Game a day before the
event.
Of course, the hype was not univer
sally appreciated.
"In Friday's Daily, the motto under

the flag read, 'The Peninsula's Only
Morning Newspaper.' Where was the
news?" wrote one reader irritated by
the 1959 Big Game edition. "On those
frequent occasions when you Find it
necessary to suspend the reporting of
all or almost all news of national and
international interest, shouldn't you,
strictly speaking, call your publication
by another name?"
Strangely, The Daily then broke a
half-century-old tradition by dropping
the Big Game edition soon after that
letter. The reasons seemed to be partly
due to reader dislike, partly due to na
tional events. For instance, the 1963

Big Game was postponed for a week
by the assassination of President John
F. Kennedy, canceling aie Big Game
edition of The Daily altogether.
It wasn't until another event of na
tional import — the police raid of The
Daily in 1971 — that football editions
began to surface again, according to
Charlie Hoffman, the editor-in-chief in
1973- After the raid, the then-editors
did a study of what readers wanted
from The Daily.
"We started looking at it as a busi
ness," he said, and a football supple
ment made good business sense.
"They (the students) didn't want to

buy the program (sold by the Athletic
Dept.)," Hoffman continued. "They just
wanted a simple roster."
So in 1972, the football supplement
to The Daily appeared at every home
football game, a publication that would
eventually become the Cardinal Today.
As costs continue to climb and as
new events are added to the pre-Big
Game festivities, the price of hype can
be expected to increase. So why have it
at all?
"We try to create a general feeling
on campus to support the football
team and to have a good time," said
Tuchin. At those prices, why not?

It's a bad day for you in 1959.
Mouth tasting of cotton from the
one-too-many skinfuls last night at
the Bonfire, you stumble bleary
eyed into the lounge and fall face

toon drawn expressly for The Daily
