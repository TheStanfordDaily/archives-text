It's a bad day for you in 1959.
Mouth tasting of cotton from the
one-too-many skinfuls last night at
the Bonfire, you stumble bleary
eyed into the lounge and fall face
forward on the front page of The
Daily.
The top half of page one is a car

toon drawn expressly for The Daily
by a nationally syndicated car
toonist. The cartoon typifies '50s
humor: blatant, sexist and racist and
not terribly funny. For instance, an
Indian rope climber is shown shin
nying up his rope and a student
below says: "These foreign students
have an unfair advantage."
