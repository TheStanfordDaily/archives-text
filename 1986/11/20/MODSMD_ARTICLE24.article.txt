# Johnson picks a fight with BofA, Cap Weinberger

### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
A soft-spoken computer professional from Eng
land has single-handedly taken on the U.S. gov
ei nment and the Bank of America in law suits that
have made headlines from Moscow to Mountain
View: It could only be Clifford Johnson.
When Cliff believes he has cause or good rea
son for pursuing something to its completion, he
will exhaust his own resources to take it to the
end," said Rogelio Careaga, Johnson's friend of
more than 10 years who is a professor of econom
ics at Colorado College in Colorado Springs,
Colo.
It is this persistence with an ideal that has pro
vided Johnson with a wealth of past experiences
and future promise.
His life as a U.S. resident began prestigiously
enough when he came here in 1970 as a Harkness
fellow, the British equivalent of a Rhodes scholar.
1 le had just received his master's degree in math
ematics (first class) on scholarship from Oxford,
where he played soccer and captained the cricket
team.
His soccer skills earned him a tryout with the
British Olympic team. Unfortunately, torn liga
ments forced Johnson to hang up his cleats and
channel all of his energies toward education.

I was the black sheep because no one in my
family had any type of education," said Johnson,
who comes from a working-class London family.
Given his upbringing, it is not hard to imagine
the culture shock he experienced in going from
Oxford to California in the late '70s. "1 was ed
ucated at Oxford and re-educated in California,
but I basically loved it here, especially the sun
shine," he said.
After studying statistics for two years at Stanford
and UC-Berkeley, however, Johnson's love affair
with California was put on hold.
His fellowship expired, and he returned to
England for three years to teach operations re
search and earn his doctorate at the University of
Sussex.
Then, it was back to California, where Johnson
did some odd jobs such as selling brushes door
to-door before being hired in 1977 by Bank of
America in San Francisco as a computer project
manager.
Enter lawsuit number one:
Johnson, who currently works for Information
Technology Services at Stanford, claims he saved
the bank millions of dollars by tuning up its com
puter system but was, nevertheless, fired because
his recommendations were sorely received by
bank higher-ups.
"They called me in, asked for my Visa card and

cut it in half," he said. "Then they did the same
thing to my bank identification card."
He is suing his ex-employer for $250,000 plus a
satisfactory work reference for improperly firing
him and damaging his reputation.
After six years of plodding through lower
courts, the suit will be filed this week with the
California Supreme Court.
Johnson hopes this will spell success for the
suit and ease some of the strain of his dawn-to
midnight work schedule. However, until then, he
still has much unfinished business with his most
recent lawsuit, this time against U.S. Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger.
Johnson first got motivated for the suit in 1983
when the United States put cruise missiles
outside London. "Being a Londoner, I said, 'Hey,
they can't do that.' "
He filed the suit on Feb. 29, 1984 — a date he
considers "appropriately Orwellian."
The suit, which has received worldwide
publicity, challenges the constitutionality of
peacetime launch-on-warning capability (LOWC)
in the United States' nuclear defense plan.
The Constitution of the United States stipulates
that "The Congress shall have the power ... to
declare war" and that "The President shall be
Commander in Chief' of the armed forces.
Johnson believes that peacetime LOWC violates

these constraints.
Because the power to launch nuclear missiles
— an act tantamount to a declaration of war — is
essentially delegated to a computer-operated de
tection system in LOWC, there is not enough time
to accomodate any human participation in the
decision, including a presidential or congres
sional alert, Johnson contends.
"You've got this satellite out there in space, and
as soon as it thinks it sees something, the missiles
go off. That's declaring war," Johnson said, outlin
ing a "potential result"' of peacetime use of
LOWC.
Experts from the legal community and groups
such as Computer Professionals for Social Re
sponsibility (CPSR) and Beyond War International
Scientific Initiative have expressed support for
Johnson's case.
Gary Chapman, director of the CPSR, called the
case "one of the best vehicles ... for averting an
insane policy," referring to LOWC.
"1 expect that (the case) is going to the Su
preme Court, so does Cliff," Chapman said, add
ing that the CPSR has subjected the case to "a lot
of scrutiny from experts" and has found it to be
"very solid."
Chapman, who has become "a good friend" of
