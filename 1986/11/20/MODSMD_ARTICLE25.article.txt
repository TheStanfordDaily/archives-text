## McCarthy fires final-round 71 to win tourney 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Senior Kathleen McCarthy shot a
final-round 71 yesterday to make up a
four-stroke deficit and win the individ
ual title by two shots at the U.S. Inter
national University Golf Tournament at
the Rancho Bernardo Golf Course in
San Diego.
McCarthy's three-round total of 220
helped the Stanford women's golf
team improve to fourth place overall in
the tournament (with a 923 team total)
from a fifth place standing after two
rounds.
Winning the team competition was
host USIU, finishing with a three-day
total of 908. The Gulls blew open a
close team race yesterday, shooting a
blistering 297 one-day team total.
Georgia ended up in second place
with a team total of 919, followed by
the Pacific 10 Conference's Arizona
with 920. The Cardinal edged South
Carolina (924) in the team race for
fourth place.
In addition to McCarthy, senior
Adrienne Gilmartin (231) and junior
Kay Cornelius (232) had strong tourna
ments for the Cardinal. Junior Trish

McGonigle (240) and freshman Steph
anie Parel (249) also contributed to
Stanford's fourth-place team finish.
"Everyone on the team thinks we
could have played better," McCarthy
said. "1 really think we can beat any
one of those teams (USIU, Georgia and
Arizona)."
McCarthy, who had not won a tourn
ament since the summer after her
sophomore year at the Western
Amateur Championships in 1985,
passed second-round leader Martina
Koch of Arizona on the 15th hole and
extended her lead to two shots with a
birdie at the 16th.
"All three days I hit the ball very
well," McCarthy said. "I putted consis
tently the whole way through. It has
been a long time since I won a tourna
ment. I am really, really happy."
Koch shot a disappointing final
round of 80 to drop into a fifth-place
tie at 225 with Heather Kuznich of
Georgia and Tracy Drake of Long
Beach State. USIU's Laurette Moritz and
Helen Altredson came in second with
three-day totals of 222. The
Gamecocks' Marianne Morris finished
fourth at 224.
