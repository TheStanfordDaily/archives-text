# Card signs 4 in women's hoops
## 
### 
With the fall deadline for signing
recruits coming to a close yester
day, Stanford Women's Basketball
Coach Tara VanDerveer did some
nifty work, getting four of the top
100 high school seniors to sign
letters-of-intent to attend Stanford
for the 1987-88 school year.
The next signing period begins
in April.
"1 couldn't be more pleased,
VanDerveer said. "I feel that this
group has the potential to be one of
the best recruiting classes in the
country. All four are in the top 100
in the country."
VanDerveer's success was a result
of her scouring the United States
from coast to coast. None of the
recruits hails from California. From
the West Coast is Trisha Stevens of
Philomath, Ore., and coming from
the eastern pan of the nation are
Tammy Svoboda (Cincinnati),
Celeste Lavoie (Nashua, N.H.) and
Ann Adkins (Huntington, W.Va.).
Adkins, a 5-foot-ll guard/for
ward, was a USA Today honorable
mention All-America last year at
Huntington East High School and is
averaging 23.4 points and eight
rebounds per game this season. She
chose Stanford over Pittsburgh,

Northwestern, Temple and West
Virginia.
Lavoie, a 6-1 forward, earned first
team All-State honors the past two
seasons at Nashua High School. Last
season, she averaged 15 points and
12 rebounds per game, and this
year she was named one of the top
five in the nation at her position by
Women's Basketball News Service.
Lavoie could fill either the small
forward or power forward position
for VanDerveer.
Stevens averaged 24 points and
19 rebounds a year ago at
Philomath High School and, at 6-
2-1/2, could play center for Stan
ford. She was also chosen one of
the top five at her position by
Women's Basketball News Service.
In addition to playing basketball,
Stevens has won the state high
school high jump championship
the past three years.
Svoboda, the tallest of the Stan
ford recruits at 6-3, averaged 17
points and 15 rebounds while
shooting 58 percent last season at
Princeton High School. A Street &
Smith's preseason honorable men
tion All-America this year, Svoboda
is expected to be a power forward
at Stanford.
