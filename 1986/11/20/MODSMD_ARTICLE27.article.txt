# Big Game rivalry brings out Stanford fans
## 
### 
Big Game week. At Stanford, this is the one
week that a majority of the students care, or
pretend to care, about football. The Band plays
all week long, there's Gaieties, there's the
Bonfire tonight, there's something that, it is
claimed, will bear some resemblance to the
rally in San Francisco. And there's a football
game. Oh yeah, a football game.

At a campus that could only manage a crowd
of 35,000 for the final home game of a bowl
bound team, football has moved to the fore
front this week. The Gator Bowl has decided to
invite the Cardinal to the biggest post-season
party in Jacksonville, Fla. And this is Big Game
week.
Sometimes it's hard to see what the deal with
Big Game is. There is indeed some rivalry be
tween the two schools, and it is one that ex
tends into other areas of university life.

But somehow it seems USC is a more hated
rival. Cal students are intelligent folks who got
into the best state school in the country, though
we like to think they did not get into the best
private school in the country. USC is the
"University of Second Choice," a place filled
with Southern California stereotypes who drive
daddy's BMW to the beach while well-paid mer
cenaries go 9-3 every year.
Even the Cal band isn't detestable, though I
still don't understand why they play the UCLA
fight song so often. USC is the only place
outside of Nuremburg where the goose-step
has ever been popular. Glenn Miller is the only
composer they play whose music was written in
the 20th century.
Still, it's Big Game that can bring a relatively
apathetic campus out of Meyer and Green for a
week to show that school spirit isn't dead, it's
just been in a 51-week coma.
Why? Tradition.
"We play 10 games, then we play the Big
Game," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said. "No
matter who we play next week, no matter what
bowl we're going to, our Big Game is still Cali
fornia."
"Big Game is Big Game," Cal Coach Joe Kapp
said. "If someone needs extra emotion, there's
enough emotion in the game itself."

This is the 89th time Stanford University and
the University of California will line up on op
posite sides of the ball in the biggest annual
sporting event ih Northern California. The
legends of the Axe and the Immortal 21 are
dusted off for another year, the memorable
games are relived, the photograph of the offi
cial signaling The Play dead when Dwight
Garner's knee hit the ground runs in The Daily
yet again.
Still, from a football point of view, it's hardly
a Big Game. Stanford is 7-2, ranked No. 16, tied
for third in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
Gator Bowl-bound. Cal is 1-9, ranked No. 2 in
Steve Harvey's Bottom 10, tied for last in the
Pac-10, and according to Harvey, set to play No.
1 Columbia{o-9) in the Sominex Siesta Bowl.
Stanford has a game next week against
Arizona in Tokyo that could decide second
place in the Pac-10. And Stanford faces Clemson
in the nationally televised Gator Bowl, with a
chance to reach the top 10. At Cal, the big foot
ball news next week will be whether or not Jim
Sochor will leave UC-Davis for a school where
more students sit on the steps outside Sproul
Hall than in the stands inside Memorial
Stadium.
This year, Big Game should be a Big
Blowout. But, as Elway said, "Teams go in

favored and win. And teams go in not favored
and win."
Look at 1980. Stanford was 6-4 and Peach
Bowl-bound. Cal was 2-8 and homeward
bound. Cal 28, Stanford 23. No bowl.
Look at 1970. Stanford was 8-2 and going to
its first Rose Bowl in 19 years. Cal was 5-5. Cal
22, Stanford 14.
The Stanford players don't look to let down
just because Cal is the worst team they play this
season. For one thing, the defense hasn't let
down all year. For another, as Tony Leiker said,
"We need a shutout." It's an achievable goal.
And, as Elway said, "You're not going to win the
football game if you get shut out."
Stanford Defensive Coordinator Dick Man
nini doesn't see Tokyo and Jacksonville as inter
fering with this week's task. "The media's been
making a lot of to-do about the Gator Bowl and
Japan," he said. "We've got 95 kids who are
thinking about nothing but California."
And Cal has nothing to think about but Stan
ford. It's hard to be a player on a team that is
the butt of everyone's jokes. Comedian Bob
Sarlatte had a field day with the Bears at yester
day's Guardsmen's Big Game luncheon in San
Francisco. "The images of Cal's season come to
mind," he said. "Chernobyl. The Andrea Doria.
"Actually, Cal's getting new jerseys next year

— they say welcome on the front. We've seen a
lot of the short-side option — that's where the
quarterback has the option to pitch the ball or
fumble it himself. But Cal's still a member of
the Pac-9-1/2."
And Cal has but one game left to take out the
frustrations of a miserable season that has Kapp
looking for a new job. "This is our bowl game,"
Cal wide receiver Wendell Peoples said.
"It's been a tough 10 weeks practicing and
getting up for Big Game," center Chuck Steele
said. "Big Game's all we have left. It's not just
our last game — it's our last chance to gain self
respect."
Stanford has already earned plenty of
respect. But perhaps not gained it. A complaint
among Stanford players has always been the
lack of support from the community. In a 1-10
season, perhaps it was understandable. This
year, there is no excuse. A crowd of 35,000 for
the final home game is a sad reflection on Stan
ford, a sad show of appreciation for a team that
has worked its way to this point.
Why, then, would 76,000 people pay $22 a
head to spend three hours in Berkeley watch
ing a football game between a 7-2 football team
and a 1-9 football team?
Because for most, it's not a football game. It's
Big Game.
