# Cardinal to swim against Berkeley
## 
### 
In what amounts to more of a
practice session than a regular
season dual meet, the Stanford
men's and women's swimming
teams will face California today
in an opportunity to gain some
racing experience before the
dual-meet season begins in ear
nest in January.
The men's team, coming off
two rare November dual meets
against SMII and Texas last
weekend, will swim in a long
course pool rather than the cus
tomary short-course pool used
for dual meets. Meters will be
employed as the distance mea
sure rather than the usual yards.
The meet is scheduled to
begin at 1 p.m. at DeGuerre
Pool.
"We sign up for our own
events," senior Sam McAdam
said. "We are not swimming a
strong lineup and there is no
strategy involved. It is a chance
to get in some quality races. I ex
pect Berkeley will have the same
attitude."
The men enter the meet with
a surprising 1-1 dual meet
record. The Longhorns upset the
Cardinal 64-49 in Austin to end a
46-meet Stanford winning
streak.
Like the men, the women's
meet against Cal is more of an
exhibition test than a full
fledged dual meet. The women
will swim double distances, or
twice as long as each race is
scheduled to last.
The women will travel to Cal,
and the meet will begin at 1:30
p.m.
