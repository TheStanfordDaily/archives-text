# Fischer, Klass: aces in the hole position
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
In the sport of water polo, the hole
man, somewhat comparable to the
center in basketball, is the primary of
fensive and defensive force.
He usually is the strongest player on
the team and harnesses the respon
siblity of either shooting from two
meter range or distributing the ball to
the outside field players for a shot on
goal.
On offense, the field players feed the
ball into the hole position each time
down the water. Defensively, the
player who guards the hole man is as
signed the unenviable task of denying
any offensive penetration from only
two meters away from the goal. The

hole is by far the busiest area in the
pool.
"The whole offense is keyed off the
hole man," Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti said. "Everything revolves
around the hole. His (the hole man's)
primary job is to run the offense."
A great hole man in water polo, like
an outstanding basketball center, can
literally take over a game both of
fensively and defensively. For example,
exceptional NCAA teams of the past
have always been marked by the per
formance of a standout hole man. Two
time Olympian Jody Campbell of the
1981 31-0 and NCAA champion Stan
ford team is testimony to this state
ment.
Rather than just one outstanding
hole man, the 32-0 and No. 1 ranked

1986 Stanford men's water polo team
has two. Senior Craig Klass and junior
Erich Fischer combine their talents in
the hole to give the Cardinal a unique
double threat from two-meter range.
"Most schools are lucky to have one
good hole man," Dettamanti said. "We
(Stanford) have always had a good
hole man, but we have never had two
of this caliber at the same time."
"It (two good hole men) doesn't
come along that often," Klass said. "We
don't have to worry about getting tired.
I don't think there is any other team
that has the consistency that we do at
two meters."
Both players can score — and score
big. Entering Saturday's game against
California, Fischer has scored 78 goals
this year, with Klass notching 77. Only

James Bergeson (82) in 1981 scored
more goals for the Cardinal in a single
season.
"Both of them are such big targets,"
teammate Chris Thompson said. "They
get up so high out of the water that it
makes our passes so much easier. You
pretty much know if you get them the
ball, they'll score."
Klass, who is Stanford's primary set,
was last year's leading scorer for the
Cardinal, tallying 59 goals on his way to
receiving the 1985 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Player of the Year award and first
team All-America honors. Fischer
started slowly in his first two years,
scoring 46 goals in a reserve role, but
has responded with almost twice his
combined 1984 and 1985 total this
season. *
"It's hard for other teams to concen
trate on guarding just one of us," Fis
cher said. "It's nice to have two hole
men at once; one of us is always in po
sition to set."
With the ability to employ two
equally effective hole men, the Card
inal enjoys the luxury of adding several
additional twists to its offense.
For example, Stanford can draw the
opponent's top defensive player, such
as UCLA's Fernando Carsalade, away
from the hole and go against a weaker
defender at the hole position.
"If a team has a good defensive
player," Thompson said, "Craig can
swim out and Erich can swim into the
hole. It moves their best defensive
player out and makes the shot a lot
easier for our hole man."
In addition, when the Cardinal is in a
man-up situation, it has the rare ability
to employ both a left-handed (Klass)
and a right-handed player (Fischer)
near the goal.
"For us, it (using both Klass and Fis
cher simultaneously) gives us another
dimension in our six-on-five," Fischer
said. "We really look for each other on
the post."
In many cases, the hole man is big
and strong but usually not very fast. A
common tactic to diminish his effec
tiveness is to tire out the hole man by
forcing him to swim a lot. However,
this practice doesn't work with Klass or
Fisher; they are complete players. Both
are among the fastest swimmers on the
team and excel on the counterattack.

"Both Erich and Craig are such good
swimmers," Stanford's Dave Imber
nino said. "They practically lead our
counterattack. That is really surprising
with hole men."
"That is one big advantage that we
have." Klass said. "We have speed to go
along with our size and our ability to
take a lot of punishment. I feel I am
faster than most of the guys (opposing
hole men)."
By virtue of their speed out of the
blocks, Klass and Fischer often reach
the opponent's goal before their op
posing defender. As a result, both
players often represent the extra man
on the characteristic Cardinal count
erattack.
Although both players are very fast
swimmers and possess the ability to
score in bunches, Klass and Fischer dif
fer in their styles of play. Klass is the
more methodical and powerful of the
two, while Fischer's play is character
ized more by short bursts of speed.
"Craig relies on size and strength,
whereas Fischer especially relies on
quickness," Dettamanti said. "Teams
can't key on one guy. Because of their
different styles of play, we are more
difficult to defend against."
Even though Klass and Fischer have
contrasting styles, both have been in
strumental in combining to help Stan
ford produce the same end result — a
win. Winning is something the Card
inal has become accustomed to since
Fischer joined Klass in the starting
lineup this year as it currently sports
the NCAA record for consecutive
wins with 41.
"They both like to make big plays,"
Imbernino said.
Again like the center in basketball,
the hole position in water polo often
sets the tone for the entire team in an
individual game. The position is in the
center of activity; the hole man is the
player whom the team rallies around.
Both Klass and Fischer are such
players.
"Playing the hole position is the
most difficult position on the team,"
Imbernino said. "It is the most physi
cally demanding. They both show such
enthusiasm and want to win so badly.
When you see how hard they art
working in there, it inspires you to play
and work harder."

While most water polo teams struggle to find one good hole man, Stanford has had the luxury this season of going to
either Erich Fischer (above) or Craig Klass. Both have a chance to break the Stanford single-season scoring record of
82 goals.
