# Stanford Stadium may go dry

Alcohol may be banned from Stan
ford Stadium next year, according to
Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
Consideration of that issue may have
been prompted when University offi
cials reviewed the Band's alcohol
policy.
Geiger said alcohol in the stadium
would be discussed at future meetings.

"We have something that we need to
discuss," Geiger said, "and the Band is
just one little piece of it."
Geiger cited problems with
drunkenness throughout the student
section this year and a possible prob
lem with insurance similar to what
caused the cancellation of tomorrow's
march in San Francisco.
Stanford Chief of Police Marvin Her
rington said he would rather not ban
alcohol from the stadium.

But Herrington said that this year
there was an increase in alcohol
related incidents, especially in the stu
dent section. "Alcohol abuse is way
up," he said.
The warm weather during all the
home games this year aggravated the
problem, Herrington said. "By the
fourth quarter, most of the students
didn't know there was a football game
going on.
This year there were several trou
bling incidents related to drunkenness,
Herrington said. One woman was
injured when she was hit with a full
can of beer, and a Dolly was hit in the
face with a pomegranate while she was
performing.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
noting that Stanford is one of the few
stadiums remaining which allows
people to bring in alcohol, said he did
not particularily want to see a dry
stadium next year.
"If we're going to get alcohol abused
and drunk in great quantities and there
are going to be resultant problems,
then that is probably going to be the
only solution," Lyons said. "It's very
difficult to police moderation."
