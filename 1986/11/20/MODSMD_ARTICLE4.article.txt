# Students blast Vienna move
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Tensions ran high at Haus Mitteleuropa last night
as students met with representatives of the Overseas
Studies Program Committee to discuss closure of
Stanford's Vienna campus.
In a discussion that at times included angry com
ments and snap retorts from both sides, approxi
mately 30 students questioned Thomas Heller, the
director of the Overseas Studies Program, and Ger
man Studies Prof. Russell Berman on how and why
the decision to close the Vienna campus was made.
Throughout tlx* meeting, students insisted they
have not been granted access to information on over
seas campus financing or on the costs of maintaining
the Vienna campus. The students said they also
wished to know more about the data used by the
Overseas Studies Program Committee to evaluate the
Vienna program.
The Overseas Studies Program Committee,
composed of students and faculty, voted 7-2 to close
the campus. The vote was prompted by a recommen
dation from a panel established last year to evaluate
Stanford's campuses in Central Europe.
Though no prepared information was available at
the meeting, Heller said he saw no reason why it
should not be made public but that he is hesitant to
release reports of a "confidential" nature.
Heller asked students to suggest changes not con
sidered by the committee. One student suggested a
specific faculty member to take over as director of
the program. "He refused," Heller said. "Now do you

want a report on why he refused?"
Students criticized the Overseas Studies Program
Committee for soliciting a report from an Austrian
scholar who had previously written on what Heller
termed "the intellectual stagnation of Vienna." Heller
said the scholar was also unhappy with the Austrian
education system.
"Now that seems to suggest right away that he
would have a bias against the possibilities of reform
in Vienna," said senior Cathy McDonnell. Heller said
people consulted by the Overseas Studies Program

Committee agreed that the scholar would be the best
person from whom to solicit a report.
Students asked both Heller and Berman to explain
what Heller referred to as "low intellectual energy
in the Vienna program. Berman said he had reviewed
the course syllabi for both the Berlin and Vienna pro
grams and considered the Vienna program weaker.
"That's a bias toward Germany," said senior l.isa
Goebbel.

German Studies Prof. Russell Berman (with beard) and Thomas Heller, director of the Overseas
Studies Program, last night discuss the Vienna campus closure.
After the meeting, Chairman of the
German Department Rob Robinson
said much of the emotion stemmed
from"the sincerity of everybody on
both sides.
"The only thing that bothers me is
the extent to which people seem to
believe somebody somewhere did
something intentionally under

handed,' Robinson said.
German Studies Prof. Gerald Gil
lespie also attended the meeting and
said he sympathizes "very deeply with
the students because I feel their cul
tural and intellectal arguments are
more convincing than the commit
tee's."
Gillespie said he was not consulted
about the Vienna campus closure al
though he has visited both campuses.
Gillespie said he first heard about the
decision in The Daily.
"We never discussed it in our de
partment, even though we are
supposed to specialize in studies of
that area," Gillespie said.
Robinson said that although Over
seas Studies did not contact the Ger
man Studies Department for com
ments, a meeting was held last year at
which German studies professors
were asked to comment on the
campuses in Berlin and Vienna.
