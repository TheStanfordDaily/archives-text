# Arraignment postponed for Lockheed protesters
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Arraignment was postponed yesterday until Jan. 22 for
three Stanford students who were among 52 people ar
rested in a protest at the Sunnyvale Lockheed, Inc.. plant last
month.
The four other Stanford students arrested Oct. 20 at the
"Lockdown Lockheed" protest organized by the political
coalition No Business As Usual, will appear in court today
and tomorrow.
Three hundred people participated in the Oct. 20 protest,
which was part of a nationwide day of protest against the
Strategic Defense Intiative. Related marches were held in At
lanta, Washington, D.C., and Cleveland.
Graduate student Scott Bohning and seniors Mario
Huerta and Carl Hill were notified yesterday in Sunnyvale
Municipal Court that any misdemeanor charges will not be
pursued until January.
No Business as Usual sees the development of SDI as an
offensive weapon and as preparation for World War 111,
Bohning said.
Huerta, unlike the majority of protesters who were ar
rested for obstructing traffic, was charged with refusal to
disperse and trespassing.
Seniors Diane Honigberg and Galen Hilgard and recent
Stanford graduates Caroline Paul and Jennifer Grant will ap
pear in court today and tomorrow, and their arraignment
probably will bo postponed as well, Bohning said
Huerta, a psychology major, said he didn't originally ex
pect to be arrested at the protest.
Vi <• went with the idea that some of us could stand by on
the sidelines But the situation got out of control, he said
Huerta called police arrests "arbitrary."

"They were arresting anybody who was trying to run
away," he said. "It became chaotic."
Police mistreated some protesters as they ran away,
Huerta said. They were "thrown on the ground, (some
were) clubbed," he said.
"I'm scared of nuclear war. I was there to make a state
ment," Huerta said.
Some Stanford students expressed beforehand that they
did not intend to be arrested, Bohning said.
Bohning, a mfcmber of Stanford Action for Nuclear Dis
armament, said the approximtaely 25 Stanford students w ho
participated in the march wanted to raise awareness of the
issue on campus, and also to call attention to SDI research at
the University itself.
At least 123 million in official SDI money has gone to re
search at Stanford over the last five years, according to fig
ures Bohning compiled from University records from the
Sponsored Project Office, through the Freedom of Informa
tion Act and from phone calls to the Pentagon.
Free electron laser research at Stanford received fH mil
lion in SDI funding for this year, he said.
"1 was quite suprised that the amount of money is as large
as it is," he said.
University researchers who apply for SDI funding for
non-defense projects "unwittingly become pan of the SDI
propaganda in Washington, D C., because their names and
schools are used as evidence that research money is
needed, Bohning said
Although some researchers openly support SDI. like Math
Prof. Joseph Goodman, "others see it only as a source of
funds, if its a project that N.S.F. won't fund (because funding
has shifted to SDI)," Bohning said.
Bohning said many University scientists request SDI
money because the National Science Foundation does not
provide funding for projects already sponsored by SDI.
