# Stanford leads in faculty pay hikes
## 
### MICHAEL WOLFE 
Salary increases for Stanford faculty
have ranked first among major univer
sities over the* past 15 years, giving the
University a competitive edge in at
tracting and keeping faculty.
"Stanford's salaries have kept our
departments tops across the board,"
said Norman Wessells, dean of the
School of Humanities and Science.
"We can compete with any other uni
versity as far as salaries go, and we
don't lose people because of salaries,
and we can hire from anywhere."
Stanford also led in average salaries
and ranked second in average salaries
of full professors and associate and as
sistant professors, according to Provost
James Rosse.
Rosse s comments, delivered to the
Faculty Senate last Thursday, were
based on a study done by Rick Bieden
weg of the University's Office of Man
agement and Budget. Biedenweg was
asked by Rosse to study data released
annually by the American Association
of University Professors (AAIJP) con
cerning faculty salaries.
Biedenweg compared 1985-86 data
with 1970-71 salary data of all profes
sors from the 25 universities with the

highest-paid full professors. Results
were weighted to take into account the
mix of assistant, associate and full pro
fessors.
Over the past 15 years, faculty
salaries at Stanford have risen an
average of 7.4 percent annually,
compared with 7 percent at Harvard.
"We have gained about 1 percent a
year over inflation," Rosse said.
"We have traditionally had a policy
to keep our salaries high to keep the
quality of our faculty high," Rosse said.
"1 initiated this report to find out how
successful Stanford has been."
Rosse said Stanford's strategy of
keeping salaries high, in combination
with its housing programs, has paid off
in faculty recruitment. "This policy has
been very successful. The quality of
our faculty has risen steadily over the
past 20 years."
In the latest AAUP survey, Stanford
also led all other universities in
average salaries of faculty regardless of
rank. The California Institute of Tech
nology placed second, UC-Berk
eley third and Harvard fourth.
However, Harvard led Stanford in
average salaries of full professors,
while Cal Tech led Stanford in average
salaries of associate and assistant pro
fessors.
If one takes inflation into account,
the 1985-86 salary increase was dra
matic, possibly the highest in modern
times, according to Rosse. The average
salary increase in 1985-86, 7 percent,
led inflation by 3-4 percent.
Rosse also warned the senate that
salary increases would probably be
lower in 1986-87, possibly by 4-5 per
cent. He said this was because of lower
inflation rates, and it would most likely
not affect Stanford's rankings among
other universities.
He pointed out that even though
Stanford has more full professors than
average, only 0.2 percent of the salary
increase over this period has come
from the rank-shift effect.
