# SOSA protests at H-P

### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Hewlett-Packard Corp. rents com
puters to a South African munitions
company, according to fliers that were
handed out yesterday at the company's
Palo Alto headquarters by about 20
members of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA).
There were no arrests.
The fliers also alleged that Hewlett-
Packard sells "computers and test
equipment to many sectors of the
South African government."
Hewlett-Packard spokesman Karen
Gervais denied the charge. "The com
pany is very, very specific about where
their products are sold, (and) they are
not sold to the police or the govern
ment."
Gervais said Hewlett-Packard's influ
ence can promote change in South
Africa. We are not there because of a
profit motive.... We are there because
of an abhorrent situation" that the
company feels it can change, according
to Gervais.
Stanford owns about S2l million of
Hewlett-Packard stock, which makes
the firm Stanford's largest investment
that is tied to South Africa. Stanford
owns about 1166 million of stock in 64
companies with operations in South
Africa.
During the protest, SOSA members
also requested a meeting with Hewlett-
Packard President John Young. Young,
also a member of the Stanford Board
of Trustees, was out of his office, ac
cording to a secretary. SOSA member
Stacey Leyton said Young would call
the group today.
"We'd like to have an opportunity to
find out what trustee Young thinks
about divestment, so we can hold him
personally responsible for decisions
the board (of trustees) makes," Leyton
said. She said trustees within the board
duck their personal moral responsibil
ity to take action against apartheid by
hiding behind the board.
She said SOSA members would also
like to ask Young how much tax money
Hewlett-Packard pays to the South
African government, whether sales are
made to the South African police and
government, how much influence
Hewlett-Packard has over Stanford
policies and "how he feels about his
own conflict of interest as a trustee
voting on divestment decisions."
