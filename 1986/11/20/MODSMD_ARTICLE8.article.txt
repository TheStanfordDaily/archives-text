GNP, economy looking up
WASHINGTON — The nation's economy, bolstered by a boom in car
sales and hefty defense spending, grew at a respectable 2.9 percent annual
rate last summer, substantially better than the dismal performance during
the spring, the government reported yesterday.
While the Reagan administration hailed the increase as proof that the
long-awaited rebound in economic growth is under way, private
economists expressed fears that the strength could be short-lived.
The Commerce Department reported that the gross national product,
after adjusting for inflation, expanded from July through September at a 2.9
percent pace, up substantially from a barely discernible 0.6 percent growth
rate turned in from April through June.
The estimate of third-quarter GNP growth marked an upward revision
from an initial report last month that put growth at a 2.4 percent rate.
The faster growth was accompanied by higher inflation as the beneficial
effects of plunging oil prices wore off. Prices, as measured by a GNP infla
tion index, rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent compared with 1.7 percent
in the second quarter.
U.S. sponsors contra training
WASHINGTON — A contingent of about 70 Nicaraguan rebels has begun
receiving U.S.-sponsored military training at an undisclosed location in the
United States — the first major sign that direct U.S. support of the contras
has resumed, administration sources said yesterday.
The sources and rebel officials declined to specify where the training is
taking place, but one administration official said the location could be a
U.S. military reservation or "sites that look similar to military sites but
belong to the CIA."
The Reagan administration has assigned to the Central Intelligence
Agency the task of managing day-to-day operations of the recently ap
proved $100 million aid program to the rebels.
While the military is expected to assist the CIA in training the contras, of
ficials declined to say yesterday who is conducting the program underway.
The trainers could be U.S. military officials, outside contractors or CIA
operatives, sources said.
Adolfo Calero, the head of the contras' largest guerrilla force of an esti
mated 11,000 fighters, said yesterday that the training, which began two
weeks ago, will last six weeks, and the process will be repeated for addi
tional contra groups. The training sites will change, U.S. sources said.
U.S. officials have said the administration had unsuccessfully sought to
have the training take place in Central America, but Costa Rica, El Salvador
and Honduras refused. The three countries did not want to risk retaliation
from Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, officials said.
Violence in Manila continues
MANILA, Philippines — A bomb hidden in a shopping bag blew up yes
terday in a department store packed with Christmas shoppers, injuring
about 35 people. A few hours earlier a prominent friend of Defense Mini
ster Juan Ponce Enrile was shot to death in an ambush.
President Corazon Aquino said on television that the escalating violence
was directed at her. She vowed to retaliate once she knows "which forces
are with me."
Police said a homemade time bomb exploded at a ground-floor counter
in the Shoemart Department Store about 7:20 p.m. No group claimed re
sponsibility, and police reported no arrests
Hospital sources said about 35 people were treated for cuts and bruises,
but no one was seriously injured.
A half-hour before the blast, an unknown assailant tossed a grenade into
the crowded balcony of a movie theater two blocks from the department
store, but the device did not explode.
Earlier yesterday, David Puzon, 65, a right-wing businessman and friend
of Enrile, was killed along with his driver and a factory manager by a band
of gunmen dressed as women 10 miles northeast of Manila. Two senior
police officers were killed in separate ambushes.
No arrests were reported in any of the cases, but the military command
blamed the Communist New People's Army rebels in the Puzon slaying.
Soviets help private businesses
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union adopted yesterday a new law designed to
encourage the growth of small private enterprise in the consumer sector
for the first time since the 19205.
The new law, adopted unanimously by the Supreme Soviet, the nominal
parliament, provides a legal framework for individual and family-owned
shops and services.
An important feature of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to revi
talize the economy, the law is designed to fill large gaps in the consumer
economy that have been a hallmark of Soviet life for more than half a cen
tury.
Introducing the law to the Supreme Soviet, Ivan Gladky, chairman of the
state committee for labor and social issues, said it effectively gave legal
sanction to workers who have long provided repair and other services on
their own, outside the law.
Bennett calls for loan reform
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Education William Bennett yesterday
called for major changes in the nation's student financial aid programs,
proposing that the federal government no longer subsidize interest rates
on many student loans and that loan repayment schedules be based on a
student's income after leaving school.
In announcing his proposals, Bennett sharply attacked colleges and uni
versities for allowing a 150 percent increase in the average cost of college
since 1975.
In laying out his "blueprint" for the future of financial aid, Bennett pro
posed the expansion of a recently approved pilot program of "income con
tingent loans," in which students must pay the full interest rate on a loan in
stead of having the federal government pick up the costs of interest that
exceeds a preset ceiling. Under the pilot program, however, the repayment
schedule is adjusted according to the borrower's ability to pay. Department
of Education officials said the program, if expanded, could eventually save
billions of dollars in subsidies and loan defaults.They predicted that the
default rate would decrease because payments would be held to no more
than 15 percent of the borrower's income.
Laßouche offices raided in probe
LOS ANGELES — The state attorney general's office raided offices of po
litical extremist Lyndon Laßouche in two California cities yesterday in its in
vestigation of alleged improprieties in qualifying the AIDS initiative for the
November ballot.
The raids were condemned by Jim Duree, a spokesman for PANIC, the
Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee, as "a political witchhunt against
Lyndon Laßouche and his associates."
"What they are trying to do is harass us," said Khushro Ghandhi, PANIC
president. "Our members have been living under close harassment since
October," when the U.S. attorney general's office raided the Laßouche
offices in Leesburg. Va.
Chief Assistant Attorney General Steve White said the raids, executing
search warrants, were carried out in Livermore and Los Angeles by agents
of the attorney general s office and the district attorneys' offices of Alameda
and Los Angeles counties.
The raids were part of the state's previously reported investigation into
alleged improprieties into how signatures were gathered for the ballot
measure. Proposition 64, which voters defeated "*9 percent to 21 percent.
The investigation centers on the alleged use of out-of-state petition cir
culators to gather signatures in California last spring. State law requires
such signature gatherers to be California citizens.
