# Reagan faces press over Iran
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, his controver
sial program of arms shipments to Iran under attack
in Congress, insisted yesterday that the program had
succeeded in opening lines of communication to
Iranian officials.
"I don't think it has been a fiasco," he said in his
first televised news conference in more than three
months. He argued that the program resulted in the
release of at least three American hostages held in
Lebanon.
The president acknowledged that several top ad
visers had opposed the sale of arms to Iran. But he
added: "I decided to proceed, and the responsibility
for the decision of the operation is mine and mine
alone."
Reagan said that although his decison authorizing
the operation was controversial and some had
"profoundly disagreed" with what was done, "I
deeply believe in the correctness of my decision.
"I was convinced then, and 1 am convinced now,"
he said, "that while the risks were great, so too was
the potential reward."

In other statements on the controversial arms ship
ments to Iran, Reagan:
• Declared that the United States would ship no
more weapons to Iran. "To eliminate the widespread
but mistaken perception that we have been exchang
ing arms for hostages, I have directed that no further
sales of arms of any kind be sent to Iran," he said.
• Said Secretary of State George Shultz, who has
publicly criticized the secret Iranian operation and
indicated he might resign, "has made it plain he will
stay as long as I want him, and I want him."
• Contended that other hostages in Lebanon would
have been released if the U.S. news media had not
paid so much attention to the story. "If there had not
been so much publicity, we would have had two
more that we were expecting," he said.
• Declared that "we did not condone, and do not
condone, the shipment of arms from other countries
(to Iran)." Immediately after the press conference,
the White House issued a "clarification" conceding
that the United States had condoned arms shipments
from one other nation to Iran.

The highly secretive Iranian initative, which
Reagan authorized 18 months ago, deeply divided
the president's top advisers, with Shultz and Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger strongly
opposed. The operation was directed from the White
House by John Poindexter, Reagan's national security
adviser, and supported by chief of staff Donald
Regan.
Reagan, unusually somber throughout the press
conference, reacted sharply when a reporter sugges
ted his credibility had been severely damaged by the
Iranian operation and asked whether he thought he
could repair it.
"Well, 1 imagine I'm the only one around who
wants to repair it, and I didn't... have anything to do
with damaging it,"he declared.
Polls taken after Reagan's speech last Thursday and
a White House news media blitz showed that a large
majority of Americans did not believe the president
when he said the Iranian initiative did not involve ex
changing arms for hostages.
