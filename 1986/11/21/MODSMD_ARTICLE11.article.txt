## For the Record

The Stanford Police Department
yesterday obtained two
photographs from The Stanford
Daily after having them sub
poenaed a day earlier.
The photographs, from an animal
research protest spring quarter,
may be used in court to identify
protesters.
The background facts:
On April 21, two local residents
began a protest in White Plaza. The
two people sat in a wooden cage
for three days to protest Stanford's
treatment of lab animals. On April
22, The Daily published a photo
graph showing one of the two.
On April 24, a larger group of
protesters held a sit-in on the fifth
floor of Jordan Hall, home to the
Psychology Department. Nineteen
protesters were arrested at the
time. The next day, The Daily pub
lished a photograph showing
several of the demonstrators.
Following is what happened this
week:
On Tuesday, Stanford Police Sgt.
Del Bandy asked The Daily for a
copy of the April 22 photograph.
Daily Editor in Chief Mark
Lawrence told police he would not
give tljem the photograph unless
they produced a subpoena.
On Wednesday, Bandy came to
The Daily's office with a subpoena.
The subpoena went far beyond
what Bandy had originally re
quested. The deputy district attor
ney asked not only for the April 22
photograph but for all published
and unpublished photos of the Jor
dan Hall animal research protest
and any related events.
Yesterday morning, Lawrence
gave the deputy D.A. copies of the

two published photos, and did not
give her any additional photos.
Three important questions:
Why did Lawrence not give any
photographs to the police before
seeing a subpoena?
The Daily sought to maintain its
integrity — meaning its indepen
dence — by not volunteering
evidence that could be used to con
vict the protesters, according to
Lawrence.
Why did Lawrence honor the
subpoena insofar as giving the
police the two photographs?
The Daily has a stated policy of
complying with legal requests.
Why did Lawrence then not give
the police unpublished
photographs that were also sub
poenaed?
The Daily used a 19H0 law — Arti
cle One, Section Two of the Califor
nia constitution — to protect its un
published photographs.
The law says, in part, that an
editor cannot be held in contempt
for refusing to disclose any un
published information, which is
defined as anything "not dis
seminated to the public," including
"notes, outtakes, photographs,
tapes or other data...."
The deputy district attorney
argued that the police had a right to
obtain unpublished Daily
photographs of the Jordan Hall sit
in because the police had allowed a
Daily photographer to stay on
private property to take the
pictures.
Hal Mickelson, a lawyer who
spoke to the deputy D.A. on The
Daily's behalf, called the claim
"ludicrous."
