# CIR report: 'What do black South Africans want us to do?'
## 
### 
As moral overseers of Stanford Univer
sity's investment policy, we believe that a
critical element in any decision on the
question of disinvestment must be the pref
erence of those in whose interests an end to
apartheid is being sought Accordingly, the
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) has endeavored to examine the major
pieces available on black South African atti
tudes toward economic sanctions and disin
vestment for some indication of public
sentiment.
These pieces consist of policy statements
of the major political groups, labor unions
and federations; interviews, statements and
speeches of prominent South African politi
cal social leaders; public opinion surveys
conducted between June 1984 and July
1986; and pertinent summary documents
prepared by the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC). Consistent with these
source documents, our findings are broken
down into the following categories: trade
unions; political groups and political
leaders; and public opinion polls and sur
veys. -
South African security laws prohibiting
political subversion are thought by many to
outlaw expression or advocacy of disinvest
ment policy, in fact, Allan Boesak was
"detained" under these laws just last year
on charges which included inciting disin
vestment activity and economic boycotts. As
a result, certain findings cited here may un
derestimate the extent to which disinvest
ment is actually favored by the black
popluation.
Trade Unions
A recent indication of workers' views on
disinvestment comes from the newly
formed (predominantly black) non-racial
trade union "superfederation" called
COSATU (Congress of South African Un
ions). COSATU, which was officially
launched Nov. 30, 1985, is a composite of
FOSATU (a predecessor multi-racial
umbrella federation), the National Union of
Mine Workers (the largest trade union in
South Africa), the Commercial, Catering
and Allied Workers of South Africa, the
Food and Canning Workers Union, Cape
Town Municipal Workers Association, the
General Workers Union, the United Mining,
Metal and Allied Workers Unions of South
Africa, the Retail and Allied Workers Union
and unions affiliated with the United Demo
cratic Front and National Federation of
Workers. This merger makes COSATU the
largest federation of unionized workers in

South Africa, embracing 33 unions and
450,000 individual members.
At its first official conference in 1984,
COSATU approved what is regarded as the
first explicit call by a major South African
union or federation of unions for disinvest
ment. The applicable resolution (which)
passed reads: "This Congress: 1 Believes
that all forms of international pressure on
the South African government — including
disinvestment or the threat of disinvestment
— is an essential and effective form of pres
sure on the South African regime, and we
support it."
This pronouncement represents a
marked departure from the vague and cau
tious statements on disinvestment issued
previously by leading South African unions.
For example, a policy statement issued in
July, 1984 by the now-dissolved FOSATU, al
though supportive of pressures generated
by the disinvestment movement, stopped
short of calling for foreign companies to
withdraw. Similarly, CUSA (Council of Un
ions of South Africa), a significant black un
ion federation which decided not to join
FOSATI! (due to differences about union
policy with respect to race), stated in 1984
that it to welcomes pressures exerted by
disinvestment activity without specifically
urging disinvestment. It did, however,
adopt a resolution late in 1984 calling for
no new investment in South Africa by
foreign countries and companies.
The reluctance of South African unions in
the past to urge a policy of disinvestment
has been attributed not only to South
African security laws, but also to the adverse
personal consequences disinvestment
policy represents to workers. The signifi
cance of the COSATU position, therefore, is
that workers now appear to be saying that
they are willing to accept significant per
sonal sacrifices in order to end apartheid.
Political Groups and Leaders:
African National Congress (ANC) —
Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo
The oldest and most outspoken of South
Africa's liberation groups, the ANC is
believed to have the plurality of black South
African support. Leadership of this non
racial (predominantly black) organization,
now headed by President Oliver Tambo,
has included such notable national figures
as 1960 Nobel Prize winner Chief Albert
Luthuli and jailed activist Nelson Mandela.
The ANC was banned by the government in
1960 after abandoning its long-term policy
of non-violent opposition in favor of a cam

paign of armed resistance.
Clirrent membership figures for the ANC
are unavailable, due in part to its banned
status, but polls and survey* consistently
suggest that this organisation (and "Man
dela ) have the largest African support of any
opposition group, making it a decisive force
in South African politics \\ ith which the gov
eminent must deal if meaningful negotia
tions are to take place. Referring to
pollsters from across the political spec-,
trum. a recent article in The New Republic
(2) indicates that ' no other organization
and no other individual receives even half
as much support" from blacks. In the words
of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, "The ANC is
the premier black political organization.
The fact that many of its members have paid
a very heavy price has enhanced its prestige
and credibility."
According to a recent New York Times ar
tide (4), the ANC and allied groups — the
UDF and COSATU (both described below)
— "have largely pushed aside rival black
groups, such as Inkatha, the Zulu based po
litical machine of Chief Gatsha Buthelesi."
The group has long-term ties with the
South African Communist Party and accord
ing to the same New York l imes account,
currently receives roughly half of its overall
support in the form of military aid from
Soviet-bloc countries. Nevertheless, most of
the old guard within the ANC, including
Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo,. are not
communist, and most experts agree that
"the practical importance of this Commu
nist influence is almost impossible to
gauge."
Furthermore, there is general agreement
that nearly all ANC leaders and members
are, first and foremost, black nationalists
whose primary political goal is the elimina
tion of apartheid and the establishment of
a just non-racial political system in South
Africa. The ANC receives substantial finan
cial support from both nations and charities
in the West, and even some Reagan admin
istration officials now are calling for the
freeing of Nelson Mandela and the es
tablishment of direct negotiations between
the ANC and the South African government.

For at least the last 20 years, the ANi hxs
advocated disinvestment by foreigfi V,ln,
panies It also supports trade sanctions artd
divestment of stuck in companies doing
business in South Africa.
United Democratic Front (l'I)F) —
Allan Boesak and Partlck I.ekota
The I'DF is one of the largest and most
diverse of the country's legal opposition
groups, representing over one million
people in over 600 community, religious
and student organizations. Its meml>erslup
is thought to overlap significantly with tlrat
of its underground ally, the ANC Tin's n< uv
racial (predominantly black) organization
and its leaders openly urge foreign pres
sure on the South African government v>
end apartheid In a statement issued Aug..s,
19HS, UDF called on foreign business 10
make no new investment in South \friia
and to end "all forms of Financial ma
terial assistance to the South Afric.m gijv
ernment, the homelands and South' African
businesses.
In an Interview with the Investor
Responsibility Research Center (IRRO ayv
ducted a year before this statement wits
drafted, Boesak urged foreign companies Jo
adopt policies of conditional withdrawal h\
specifying tij Pretoria that they ya>u)d
withdraw tlieir operations from, South
Africa by a certain date if Pretoria did i\ot
meet specific demands for political n form.
Since that time, Boesak is believed ty h.iye
advocated a policy of disfnvestment'during
local meetings. It is this belief, together
with other alleged reform activity, that
resulted in Boesak's short-term "detehtioh"
last year.
Azanian People's Organization
(AZAPO)
This black consciousness group was or
ganized in the 1960s under the leaderslijp
of Steve Biko, who died in 1977 while in
detention (many believe at the hands of the
South African police). To the IRRC's know!
edge, AZAPO has not issued any statement
on investment policy to date. However, it is
assumed that this group favors disjnvej-t
ment on the basis of the strong stance
against capitalism and imperialism.
And, in fact, in an interview conducted
earlier this year by the IRRC, Saths Cooper,
the president of AZAPO, made several state
ments critical of foreign investment in
South Africa that supported this assump
tion. As reported by the IRRC, Saths argued:
1) that "multinational corporations' involve
ment in South Africa is not altruistic or
humanitarian, but rather an investment in
the status quo, and that their commitment
to social responsibility has been minimal;
and 2) that companies, by providing funds
for black health, education and other com
munity development projects, "merely
relieve the government of its own obliga
tions, enabling it to allocate more resources
for repressive purposes."
South African Council of Churches
(SACC)
This group, whose membership is
primarily black, adopted a resolution at its
national conference on June 28, 1985,
stating that "disinvestment and similar eco
nomic pressure are now called for as a
peaceful and effective means of putting
pressure on the South African government
to bring about those fundamental changes
this country needs."
It is important to point out that resolu
tions supporting disinvestment had been
proposed but not adopted in prior years.
Strong support last year for the adoption of
a resolution in support of disinvestment is
felt by SACC administrative officials to be
due to the increased radicalization of the
SACC membership generated by the polit
cal events of last year.
Bishop Tutu
Bishop Desmond Tutu, recipient of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, Archbishop of
Cape Town and former head of the SACC,
openly criticizes American and foreign in
vestment generally in South Africa. Since
1983, he has supported a policy of condi
tional withdrawal (threatened and actual
withdrawal by companies if specific
demands for reform are not met within a
certain period of time). Standing by the
March 1986 deadline he gave last year for
compliance with his set of reform demands,
Bishop Tutu on April 2, 1986 called publicly
on the international community to apply
punitive economic sanctions against South
Africa. In his April statement, Tutu did not
urge disinvesment specifically, but rather
something "effective ... concerted and
united." by so doing, Tutu risks criminal
prosecution under South Africa's security
laws.
Labor Party
Prior to 1985, the "colored" (mixed
races) Labor Party long had supported dis
investment. Then, after the founding of a
new colored chamber of parliament (but
none for blacks) in August, 1984, the Labor
Part>- reversed its position at its annual con
ference in January 1985 and called instead
for a five-year moratorium on efforts to stop
foreign investment.
Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha
Chief Gaisha Buthelezi, chief minister of
the Kwa-Zulu homeland, and his Inkatha or
ganization solidly favor increased invest
ment by foreign companies that adhere to
certain social responsiblity standards. The
members of Inkatha rival UDF members in
numbers (nearly a million) but, unlike UDF

members, are from more rural than urban
areas. Chief Buthelezi is a controversial fig
ure in South Africa. According to IRRC (5),
"Buthelezi is viewed by many urban blacks
as having "sold out" to Pretoria, in part be
cause he has often criticized politically in
spired student boycotts and work stavaways
mobilized by other black organizations or
unions. To many of his black critics, But
helezi is an extension of the South African
government, rather than an opponent of it."
In fact. Chief Buthelezi and many Inkatha
members are, in a sense, employees of the
government through the KwaZulu adminis
tration which is funded by Pretoria.
Black Public Opinion Surveys
In turning next to surveys of black public
opinion for enlightenment on what black
South Africans want us to do, one harsh
reality must be recognized. For many black
South Africans, the main issue they must ad
dress is survival — obtaining the basic es
sential to get through another day. Policy is
sues such as disinvestment may be beyond
their frame of reference. Those reached by
surveys would tend to be less impoverished
blacks, such as those who have employment
in an urban setting, and even they may not
have considered such policy issues before
being questioned. Therefore, the well
considered views of black leaders, includ
ing the leadership of the national black or
ganizations cited in the preceding sections,
probably have more significance than the
results of black opinion surveys.
As described in some detail in an IRRC
report (5), five major surveys of black
public opinion were taken between June
1984 and July 1986. These surveys are des
cribed in the following table, and then the
major results are summarized in the second
table.
(Tables here are omitted.)
Analysis of Survey Results
Although most black leaders, including
the leadership of national black organiza
tions, have dealt with the complex issues of
disinvestment and sanctions, it is unclear
whether there issues have received much
consideration by the general black public. If
well-formed opinions have not been
reached prior to being questioned by sur
vey takers, one would expect differences in
how surveys approach these issues to yield
substantial differences in the results, and
such differences in results have indeed oc
curred. Consequently, given the enormous
differences in wording and polling met
hodologies of the various surveys con
ducted to date, it is impossible to arrive at
many foolproof conclusions about African
sentiment toward sanctions and/or disin
vestment. In fact, a selective reader of the
survey results can find support for almost
any position. It is probably fair to conclude
from survey findings, however, that:
1) Of those urban blacks who support
economic pressure by foreign countries
against the government, the majority appear
to support pressure at the risk of personal
sacrifice.
2) It appears that a majority of urban
blacks think that disinvestment will actually
help in pressuring the government to end
apartheid.
3) Given a spectrum of policy options re
garding the disinvestment issue, a large
majority of urban blacks appear to support
either unconditional disinvestment or con
ditional disinvestment (disinvestment un
less the company is actively pressuring the
government to end apartheid).
Can any other tentative conclusions be
drawn? In a scholarly analysis of the survey

results summarized above, Rich Brody (1)
has drawn the following interpretations:
1) It is likely that before the state of emer
gency was imposed this past spring, about
25 to 30 percent of urban black South
Africans supported unconditional disinvest
ment and other forms of foreign economic
sanctions.
2) It is likely that a shift in opinion has
taken place since the state of emergency
was imposed.
3) Among urban blacks with an opinion
about the issue of economic sanctions, it is
likely that a majority now support sanctions.
Conclusions
Although there is not unanimity among
black South Africans, growing impatience
with the South African government's unwill
ingness to adopt meaningful reforms is
producing increased support among black
South Africans for some form of disinvest
ment policy. This trend is reflected most
vividly in COSATU's recent statement in
support of unconditional disinvestment. It
is bolstered by UDF's recent stance in oppo
sition to any new foreign investment in
South Africa, and public opinion polls sug
gesting both increased support for eco
nomic sanctions and plurality allegiance to
the ANC, an aggressive proponent of disin
vestment policy.
In summary,
1) The superfederation of non-racial
(predominantly black) labor unions
(COSATU) supports disinvestment or the
threat of disinvestment even though this
may require significant personal sacrifice
by some of its members.
2) The premier black political organiza
tion (ANC), which enjoys strong plurality
support by black South Africans, has sup
ported disinvestment for at least 20 years,
and most of the other top black organiza
tions and leaders now take a similar posi
tion.
3) Although black public opinion surveys
are far from conclusive, they do suggest that
a majority of urban blacks with an opinion
now support (i) sanctions, (ii) either un
conditional or conditional disinvestment,
and (iii) the view that disinvestment will ac
tually help in pressuring the government to
end apartheid.

Trade Unions
A recent indication of workers' views on
disinvestment comes from the newly
formed (predominantly black) non-racial
trade union "superfederation" called
COSATU (Congress of South African Un
ions). COSATU, which was officially
launched Nov. 30, 1985, is a composite of
FOSATU (a predecessor multi-racial
umbrella federation), the National Union of
Mine Workers (the largest trade union in
South Africa), the Commercial, Catering
and Allied Workers of South Africa, the
Food and Canning Workers Union, Cape
Town Municipal Workers Association, the
General Workers Union, the United Mining,
Metal and Allied Workers Unions of South
Africa, the Retail and Allied Workers Union
and unions affiliated with the United Demo
cratic Front and National Federation of
Workers. This merger makes COSATU the
largest federation of unionized workers in

South Africa, embracing 33 unions and
450,000 individual members.
At its first official conference in 1984,
COSATU approved what is regarded as the
first explicit call by a major South African
union or federation of unions for disinvest
ment. The applicable resolution (which)
passed reads: "This Congress: 1 Believes
that all forms of international pressure on
the South African government — including
disinvestment or the threat of disinvestment
— is an essential and effective form of pres
sure on the South African regime, and we
support it."
This pronouncement represents a
marked departure from the vague and cau
tious statements on disinvestment issued
previously by leading South African unions.
For example, a policy statement issued in
July, 1984 by the now-dissolved FOSATU, al
though supportive of pressures generated
by the disinvestment movement, stopped
short of calling for foreign companies to
withdraw. Similarly, CUSA (Council of Un
ions of South Africa), a significant black un
ion federation which decided not to join
FOSATI! (due to differences about union
policy with respect to race), stated in 1984
that it to welcomes pressures exerted by
disinvestment activity without specifically
urging disinvestment. It did, however,
adopt a resolution late in 1984 calling for
no new investment in South Africa by
foreign countries and companies.
The reluctance of South African unions in
the past to urge a policy of disinvestment
has been attributed not only to South
African security laws, but also to the adverse
personal consequences disinvestment
policy represents to workers. The signifi
cance of the COSATU position, therefore, is
that workers now appear to be saying that
they are willing to accept significant per
sonal sacrifices in order to end apartheid.

For at least the last 20 years, the ANi hxs
advocated disinvestment by foreigfi V,ln,
panies It also supports trade sanctions artd
divestment of stuck in companies doing
business in South Africa.
United Democratic Front (l'I)F) —
Allan Boesak and Partlck I.ekota
The I'DF is one of the largest and most
diverse of the country's legal opposition
groups, representing over one million
people in over 600 community, religious
and student organizations. Its meml>erslup
is thought to overlap significantly with tlrat

primarily black, adopted a resolution at its

stating that "disinvestment and similar eco

peaceful and effective means of putting
pressure on the South African government
to bring about those fundamental changes

It is important to point out that resolu
tions supporting disinvestment had been
proposed but not adopted in prior years.
Strong support last year for the adoption of
a resolution in support of disinvestment is
felt by SACC administrative officials to be
due to the increased radicalization of the
SACC membership generated by the polit
cal events of last year.
Bishop Tutu
Bishop Desmond Tutu, recipient of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, Archbishop of
Cape Town and former head of the SACC,
openly criticizes American and foreign in
vestment generally in South Africa. Since
1983, he has supported a policy of condi

for a five-year moratorium on efforts to stop
foreign investment.
Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha
Chief Gaisha Buthelezi, chief minister of
the Kwa-Zulu homeland, and his Inkatha or
ganization solidly favor increased invest
ment by foreign companies that adhere to
certain social responsiblity standards. The
members of Inkatha rival UDF members in
numbers (nearly a million) but, unlike UDF

members, are from more rural than urban

In fact. Chief Buthelezi and many Inkatha

public opinion were taken between June
1984 and July 1986. These surveys are des
cribed in the following table, and then the
major results are summarized in the second
table.
(Tables here are omitted.)
Analysis of Survey Results
Although most black leaders, including
the leadership of national black organiza
tions, have dealt with the complex issues of
disinvestment and sanctions, it is unclear
whether there issues have received much
consideration by the general black public. If
well-formed opinions have not been
reached prior to being questioned by sur
vey takers, one would expect differences in
how surveys approach these issues to yield
substantial differences in the results, and
such differences in results have indeed oc
curred. Consequently, given the enormous
differences in wording and polling met
hodologies of the various surveys con
ducted to date, it is impossible to arrive at
many foolproof conclusions about African
sentiment toward sanctions and/or disin
vestment. In fact, a selective reader of the
survey results can find support for almost
any position. It is probably fair to conclude
from survey findings, however, that:
1) Of those urban blacks who support
economic pressure by foreign countries
against the government, the majority appear
to support pressure at the risk of personal
sacrifice.
2) It appears that a majority of urban
blacks think that disinvestment will actually
help in pressuring the government to end
apartheid.
3) Given a spectrum of policy options re
garding the disinvestment issue, a large
majority of urban blacks appear to support
either unconditional disinvestment or con
ditional disinvestment (disinvestment un
less the company is actively pressuring the
government to end apartheid).
Can any other tentative conclusions be
drawn? In a scholarly analysis of the survey

results summarized above, Rich Brody (1)
has drawn the following interpretations:
1) It is likely that before the state of emer
gency was imposed this past spring, about
25 to 30 percent of urban black South
Africans supported unconditional disinvest
ment and other forms of foreign economic
sanctions.
2) It is likely that a shift in opinion has
taken place since the state of emergency
was imposed.
3) Among urban blacks with an opinion
about the issue of economic sanctions, it is
likely that a majority now support sanctions.
Conclusions
Although there is not unanimity among
black South Africans, growing impatience
with the South African government's unwill
ingness to adopt meaningful reforms is
producing increased support among black
South Africans for some form of disinvest
ment policy. This trend is reflected most
vividly in COSATU's recent statement in
support of unconditional disinvestment. It
is bolstered by UDF's recent stance in oppo
sition to any new foreign investment in
South Africa, and public opinion polls sug
gesting both increased support for eco
nomic sanctions and plurality allegiance to
the ANC, an aggressive proponent of disin
vestment policy.
In summary,
1) The superfederation of non-racial
(predominantly black) labor unions
(COSATU) supports disinvestment or the
threat of disinvestment even though this
may require significant personal sacrifice
by some of its members.
2) The premier black political organiza
tion (ANC), which enjoys strong plurality
support by black South Africans, has sup
ported disinvestment for at least 20 years,
and most of the other top black organiza
tions and leaders now take a similar posi
tion.
3) Although black public opinion surveys
are far from conclusive, they do suggest that
a majority of urban blacks with an opinion
now support (i) sanctions, (ii) either un
conditional or conditional disinvestment,
and (iii) the view that disinvestment will ac
tually help in pressuring the government to
end apartheid.

As moral overseers of Stanford Univer
sity's investment policy, we believe that a
critical element in any decision on the
question of disinvestment must be the pref
erence of those in whose interests an end to
apartheid is being sought Accordingly, the
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) has endeavored to examine the major
pieces available on black South African atti
tudes toward economic sanctions and disin
vestment for some indication of public
sentiment.
These pieces consist of policy statements
of the major political groups, labor unions
and federations; interviews, statements and
speeches of prominent South African politi
cal social leaders; public opinion surveys
conducted between June 1984 and July
1986; and pertinent summary documents
prepared by the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC). Consistent with these
source documents, our findings are broken
down into the following categories: trade
unions; political groups and political
leaders; and public opinion polls and sur
veys. -
South African security laws prohibiting
political subversion are thought by many to
outlaw expression or advocacy of disinvest
ment policy, in fact, Allan Boesak was
"detained" under these laws just last year
on charges which included inciting disin
vestment activity and economic boycotts. As
a result, certain findings cited here may un
derestimate the extent to which disinvest
ment is actually favored by the black
popluation.
Trade Unions
A recent indication of workers' views on
disinvestment comes from the newly
formed (predominantly black) non-racial
trade union "superfederation" called
COSATU (Congress of South African Un
ions). COSATU, which was officially
launched Nov. 30, 1985, is a composite of
FOSATU (a predecessor multi-racial
umbrella federation), the National Union of
Mine Workers (the largest trade union in
South Africa), the Commercial, Catering
and Allied Workers of South Africa, the
Food and Canning Workers Union, Cape
Town Municipal Workers Association, the
General Workers Union, the United Mining,
Metal and Allied Workers Unions of South
Africa, the Retail and Allied Workers Union
and unions affiliated with the United Demo
cratic Front and National Federation of
Workers. This merger makes COSATU the
largest federation of unionized workers in

South Africa, embracing 33 unions and
450,000 individual members.
At its first official conference in 1984,
COSATU approved what is regarded as the
first explicit call by a major South African
union or federation of unions for disinvest
ment. The applicable resolution (which)
passed reads: "This Congress: 1 Believes
that all forms of international pressure on
the South African government — including
disinvestment or the threat of disinvestment
— is an essential and effective form of pres
sure on the South African regime, and we
support it."
This pronouncement represents a
marked departure from the vague and cau
tious statements on disinvestment issued
previously by leading South African unions.
For example, a policy statement issued in
July, 1984 by the now-dissolved FOSATU, al
though supportive of pressures generated
by the disinvestment movement, stopped
short of calling for foreign companies to
withdraw. Similarly, CUSA (Council of Un
ions of South Africa), a significant black un
ion federation which decided not to join
FOSATI! (due to differences about union
policy with respect to race), stated in 1984
that it to welcomes pressures exerted by
disinvestment activity without specifically
urging disinvestment. It did, however,
adopt a resolution late in 1984 calling for
no new investment in South Africa by
foreign countries and companies.
The reluctance of South African unions in
the past to urge a policy of disinvestment
has been attributed not only to South
African security laws, but also to the adverse
personal consequences disinvestment
policy represents to workers. The signifi
cance of the COSATU position, therefore, is
that workers now appear to be saying that
they are willing to accept significant per
sonal sacrifices in order to end apartheid.
Political Groups and Leaders:
African National Congress (ANC) —
Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo
The oldest and most outspoken of South
Africa's liberation groups, the ANC is
believed to have the plurality of black South
African support. Leadership of this non
racial (predominantly black) organization,
now headed by President Oliver Tambo,
has included such notable national figures
as 1960 Nobel Prize winner Chief Albert
Luthuli and jailed activist Nelson Mandela.
The ANC was banned by the government in
1960 after abandoning its long-term policy
of non-violent opposition in favor of a cam

paign of armed resistance.
Clirrent membership figures for the ANC
are unavailable, due in part to its banned
status, but polls and survey* consistently
suggest that this organisation (and "Man
dela ) have the largest African support of any
opposition group, making it a decisive force
in South African politics \\ ith which the gov
eminent must deal if meaningful negotia
tions are to take place. Referring to
pollsters from across the political spec-,
trum. a recent article in The New Republic
(2) indicates that ' no other organization
and no other individual receives even half
as much support" from blacks. In the words
of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, "The ANC is
the premier black political organization.
The fact that many of its members have paid
a very heavy price has enhanced its prestige
and credibility."
According to a recent New York Times ar
tide (4), the ANC and allied groups — the
UDF and COSATU (both described below)
— "have largely pushed aside rival black
groups, such as Inkatha, the Zulu based po
litical machine of Chief Gatsha Buthelesi."
The group has long-term ties with the
South African Communist Party and accord
ing to the same New York l imes account,
currently receives roughly half of its overall
support in the form of military aid from
Soviet-bloc countries. Nevertheless, most of
the old guard within the ANC, including
Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo,. are not
communist, and most experts agree that
"the practical importance of this Commu
nist influence is almost impossible to
gauge."
Furthermore, there is general agreement
that nearly all ANC leaders and members
are, first and foremost, black nationalists
whose primary political goal is the elimina
tion of apartheid and the establishment of
a just non-racial political system in South
Africa. The ANC receives substantial finan
cial support from both nations and charities
in the West, and even some Reagan admin
istration officials now are calling for the
freeing of Nelson Mandela and the es
tablishment of direct negotiations between
the ANC and the South African government.

For at least the last 20 years, the ANi hxs
advocated disinvestment by foreigfi V,ln,
panies It also supports trade sanctions artd
divestment of stuck in companies doing
business in South Africa.
United Democratic Front (l'I)F) —
Allan Boesak and Partlck I.ekota
The I'DF is one of the largest and most
diverse of the country's legal opposition
groups, representing over one million
people in over 600 community, religious
and student organizations. Its meml>erslup
is thought to overlap significantly with tlrat
of its underground ally, the ANC Tin's n< uv
racial (predominantly black) organization
and its leaders openly urge foreign pres
sure on the South African government v>
end apartheid In a statement issued Aug..s,
19HS, UDF called on foreign business 10
make no new investment in South \friia
and to end "all forms of Financial ma
terial assistance to the South Afric.m gijv
ernment, the homelands and South' African
businesses.
In an Interview with the Investor
Responsibility Research Center (IRRO ayv
ducted a year before this statement wits
drafted, Boesak urged foreign companies Jo
adopt policies of conditional withdrawal h\
specifying tij Pretoria that they ya>u)d
withdraw tlieir operations from, South
Africa by a certain date if Pretoria did i\ot
meet specific demands for political n form.
Since that time, Boesak is believed ty h.iye
advocated a policy of disfnvestment'during
local meetings. It is this belief, together
with other alleged reform activity, that
resulted in Boesak's short-term "detehtioh"
last year.
Azanian People's Organization
(AZAPO)
This black consciousness group was or
ganized in the 1960s under the leaderslijp
of Steve Biko, who died in 1977 while in
detention (many believe at the hands of the
South African police). To the IRRC's know!
edge, AZAPO has not issued any statement
on investment policy to date. However, it is
assumed that this group favors disjnvej-t
ment on the basis of the strong stance
against capitalism and imperialism.
And, in fact, in an interview conducted
earlier this year by the IRRC, Saths Cooper,
the president of AZAPO, made several state
ments critical of foreign investment in
South Africa that supported this assump
tion. As reported by the IRRC, Saths argued:
1) that "multinational corporations' involve
ment in South Africa is not altruistic or
humanitarian, but rather an investment in
the status quo, and that their commitment
to social responsibility has been minimal;
and 2) that companies, by providing funds
for black health, education and other com
munity development projects, "merely
relieve the government of its own obliga
tions, enabling it to allocate more resources
for repressive purposes."
South African Council of Churches
(SACC)
This group, whose membership is
primarily black, adopted a resolution at its
national conference on June 28, 1985,
stating that "disinvestment and similar eco
nomic pressure are now called for as a
peaceful and effective means of putting
pressure on the South African government
to bring about those fundamental changes
this country needs."
It is important to point out that resolu
tions supporting disinvestment had been
proposed but not adopted in prior years.
Strong support last year for the adoption of
a resolution in support of disinvestment is
felt by SACC administrative officials to be
due to the increased radicalization of the
SACC membership generated by the polit
cal events of last year.
Bishop Tutu
Bishop Desmond Tutu, recipient of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, Archbishop of
Cape Town and former head of the SACC,
openly criticizes American and foreign in
vestment generally in South Africa. Since
1983, he has supported a policy of condi
tional withdrawal (threatened and actual
withdrawal by companies if specific
demands for reform are not met within a
certain period of time). Standing by the
March 1986 deadline he gave last year for
compliance with his set of reform demands,
Bishop Tutu on April 2, 1986 called publicly
on the international community to apply
punitive economic sanctions against South
Africa. In his April statement, Tutu did not
urge disinvesment specifically, but rather
something "effective ... concerted and
united." by so doing, Tutu risks criminal
prosecution under South Africa's security
laws.
Labor Party
Prior to 1985, the "colored" (mixed
races) Labor Party long had supported dis
investment. Then, after the founding of a
new colored chamber of parliament (but
none for blacks) in August, 1984, the Labor
Part>- reversed its position at its annual con
ference in January 1985 and called instead
for a five-year moratorium on efforts to stop
foreign investment.
Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha
Chief Gaisha Buthelezi, chief minister of
the Kwa-Zulu homeland, and his Inkatha or
ganization solidly favor increased invest
ment by foreign companies that adhere to
certain social responsiblity standards. The
members of Inkatha rival UDF members in
numbers (nearly a million) but, unlike UDF

members, are from more rural than urban
areas. Chief Buthelezi is a controversial fig
ure in South Africa. According to IRRC (5),
"Buthelezi is viewed by many urban blacks
as having "sold out" to Pretoria, in part be
cause he has often criticized politically in
spired student boycotts and work stavaways
mobilized by other black organizations or
unions. To many of his black critics, But
helezi is an extension of the South African
government, rather than an opponent of it."
In fact. Chief Buthelezi and many Inkatha
members are, in a sense, employees of the
government through the KwaZulu adminis
tration which is funded by Pretoria.
Black Public Opinion Surveys
In turning next to surveys of black public
opinion for enlightenment on what black
South Africans want us to do, one harsh
reality must be recognized. For many black
South Africans, the main issue they must ad
dress is survival — obtaining the basic es
sential to get through another day. Policy is
sues such as disinvestment may be beyond
their frame of reference. Those reached by
surveys would tend to be less impoverished
blacks, such as those who have employment
in an urban setting, and even they may not
have considered such policy issues before
being questioned. Therefore, the well
considered views of black leaders, includ
ing the leadership of the national black or
ganizations cited in the preceding sections,
probably have more significance than the
results of black opinion surveys.
As described in some detail in an IRRC
report (5), five major surveys of black
public opinion were taken between June
1984 and July 1986. These surveys are des
cribed in the following table, and then the
major results are summarized in the second
table.
(Tables here are omitted.)
Analysis of Survey Results
Although most black leaders, including
the leadership of national black organiza
tions, have dealt with the complex issues of
disinvestment and sanctions, it is unclear
whether there issues have received much
consideration by the general black public. If
well-formed opinions have not been
reached prior to being questioned by sur
vey takers, one would expect differences in
how surveys approach these issues to yield
substantial differences in the results, and
such differences in results have indeed oc
curred. Consequently, given the enormous

many foolproof conclusions about African
sentiment toward sanctions and/or disin

sacrifice.
2) It appears that a majority of urban
blacks think that disinvestment will actually

apartheid.
3) Given a spectrum of policy options re
garding the disinvestment issue, a large
majority of urban blacks appear to support
either unconditional disinvestment or con
ditional disinvestment (disinvestment un
less the company is actively pressuring the

Can any other tentative conclusions be
drawn? In a scholarly analysis of the survey

25 to 30 percent of urban black South

Trade Unions
A recent indication of workers' views on
disinvestment comes from the newly
formed (predominantly black) non-racial
trade union "superfederation" called
COSATU (Congress of South African Un
ions). COSATU, which was officially
launched Nov. 30, 1985, is a composite of
FOSATU (a predecessor multi-racial
umbrella federation), the National Union of
Mine Workers (the largest trade union in
South Africa), the Commercial, Catering
and Allied Workers of South Africa, the
Food and Canning Workers Union, Cape
Town Municipal Workers Association, the
General Workers Union, the United Mining,
Metal and Allied Workers Unions of South
Africa, the Retail and Allied Workers Union
and unions affiliated with the United Demo
cratic Front and National Federation of
Workers. This merger makes COSATU the
largest federation of unionized workers in

South Africa, embracing 33 unions and
450,000 individual members.
At its first official conference in 1984,
COSATU approved what is regarded as the
first explicit call by a major South African
union or federation of unions for disinvest
ment. The applicable resolution (which)
passed reads: "This Congress: 1 Believes
that all forms of international pressure on
the South African government — including
disinvestment or the threat of disinvestment
— is an essential and effective form of pres
sure on the South African regime, and we
support it."
This pronouncement represents a
marked departure from the vague and cau
tious statements on disinvestment issued
previously by leading South African unions.
For example, a policy statement issued in
July, 1984 by the now-dissolved FOSATU, al
though supportive of pressures generated
by the disinvestment movement, stopped
short of calling for foreign companies to
withdraw. Similarly, CUSA (Council of Un
ions of South Africa), a significant black un
ion federation which decided not to join
FOSATI! (due to differences about union
policy with respect to race), stated in 1984
that it to welcomes pressures exerted by
disinvestment activity without specifically
urging disinvestment. It did, however,
adopt a resolution late in 1984 calling for
no new investment in South Africa by
foreign countries and companies.
The reluctance of South African unions in
the past to urge a policy of disinvestment
has been attributed not only to South
African security laws, but also to the adverse
personal consequences disinvestment
policy represents to workers. The signifi
cance of the COSATU position, therefore, is
that workers now appear to be saying that
they are willing to accept significant per
sonal sacrifices in order to end apartheid.

United Democratic Front (l'I)F) —
Allan Boesak and Partlck I.ekota
The I'DF is one of the largest and most
diverse of the country's legal opposition
groups, representing over one million
people in over 600 community, religious
and student organizations. Its meml>erslup
is thought to overlap significantly with tlrat

1) that "multinational corporations' involve
ment in South Africa is not altruistic or
humanitarian, but rather an investment in
the status quo, and that their commitment
to social responsibility has been minimal;
and 2) that companies, by providing funds
for black health, education and other com
munity development projects, "merely
relieve the government of its own obliga
tions, enabling it to allocate more resources
for repressive purposes."
South African Council of Churches
(SACC)
This group, whose membership is
primarily black, adopted a resolution at its
national conference on June 28, 1985,
stating that "disinvestment and similar eco
nomic pressure are now called for as a
peaceful and effective means of putting
pressure on the South African government
to bring about those fundamental changes
this country needs."
It is important to point out that resolu
tions supporting disinvestment had been
proposed but not adopted in prior years.
Strong support last year for the adoption of
a resolution in support of disinvestment is
felt by SACC administrative officials to be
due to the increased radicalization of the
SACC membership generated by the polit
cal events of last year.
Bishop Tutu
Bishop Desmond Tutu, recipient of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, Archbishop of
Cape Town and former head of the SACC,
openly criticizes American and foreign in
vestment generally in South Africa. Since
1983, he has supported a policy of condi
tional withdrawal (threatened and actual
withdrawal by companies if specific
demands for reform are not met within a
certain period of time). Standing by the
March 1986 deadline he gave last year for
compliance with his set of reform demands,
Bishop Tutu on April 2, 1986 called publicly
on the international community to apply
punitive economic sanctions against South
Africa. In his April statement, Tutu did not
urge disinvesment specifically, but rather
something "effective ... concerted and
united." by so doing, Tutu risks criminal
prosecution under South Africa's security
laws.
Labor Party
Prior to 1985, the "colored" (mixed
races) Labor Party long had supported dis
investment. Then, after the founding of a
new colored chamber of parliament (but
none for blacks) in August, 1984, the Labor
Part>- reversed its position at its annual con
ference in January 1985 and called instead
for a five-year moratorium on efforts to stop
foreign investment.
Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha
Chief Gaisha Buthelezi, chief minister of
the Kwa-Zulu homeland, and his Inkatha or
ganization solidly favor increased invest
ment by foreign companies that adhere to
certain social responsiblity standards. The
members of Inkatha rival UDF members in
numbers (nearly a million) but, unlike UDF

members, are from more rural than urban
areas. Chief Buthelezi is a controversial fig
ure in South Africa. According to IRRC (5),
"Buthelezi is viewed by many urban blacks
as having "sold out" to Pretoria, in part be
cause he has often criticized politically in
spired student boycotts and work stavaways
mobilized by other black organizations or
unions. To many of his black critics, But
helezi is an extension of the South African
government, rather than an opponent of it."
In fact. Chief Buthelezi and many Inkatha
members are, in a sense, employees of the
government through the KwaZulu adminis
tration which is funded by Pretoria.
Black Public Opinion Surveys
In turning next to surveys of black public
opinion for enlightenment on what black
South Africans want us to do, one harsh
reality must be recognized. For many black
South Africans, the main issue they must ad
dress is survival — obtaining the basic es
sential to get through another day. Policy is
sues such as disinvestment may be beyond
their frame of reference. Those reached by
surveys would tend to be less impoverished
blacks, such as those who have employment
in an urban setting, and even they may not
have considered such policy issues before
being questioned. Therefore, the well
considered views of black leaders, includ
ing the leadership of the national black or
ganizations cited in the preceding sections,
probably have more significance than the
results of black opinion surveys.
As described in some detail in an IRRC
report (5), five major surveys of black
public opinion were taken between June
1984 and July 1986. These surveys are des
cribed in the following table, and then the
major results are summarized in the second
table.
(Tables here are omitted.)
Analysis of Survey Results
Although most black leaders, including
the leadership of national black organiza
tions, have dealt with the complex issues of
disinvestment and sanctions, it is unclear
whether there issues have received much
consideration by the general black public. If
well-formed opinions have not been
reached prior to being questioned by sur
vey takers, one would expect differences in
how surveys approach these issues to yield
substantial differences in the results, and
such differences in results have indeed oc
curred. Consequently, given the enormous
differences in wording and polling met
hodologies of the various surveys con
ducted to date, it is impossible to arrive at
many foolproof conclusions about African
sentiment toward sanctions and/or disin
vestment. In fact, a selective reader of the
survey results can find support for almost
any position. It is probably fair to conclude
from survey findings, however, that:
1) Of those urban blacks who support
economic pressure by foreign countries
against the government, the majority appear
to support pressure at the risk of personal
sacrifice.
2) It appears that a majority of urban
blacks think that disinvestment will actually
help in pressuring the government to end
apartheid.
3) Given a spectrum of policy options re
garding the disinvestment issue, a large
majority of urban blacks appear to support
either unconditional disinvestment or con
ditional disinvestment (disinvestment un
less the company is actively pressuring the
government to end apartheid).
Can any other tentative conclusions be
drawn? In a scholarly analysis of the survey

results summarized above, Rich Brody (1)
has drawn the following interpretations:
1) It is likely that before the state of emer
gency was imposed this past spring, about
25 to 30 percent of urban black South
Africans supported unconditional disinvest
ment and other forms of foreign economic
sanctions.
2) It is likely that a shift in opinion has
taken place since the state of emergency
was imposed.
3) Among urban blacks with an opinion
about the issue of economic sanctions, it is
likely that a majority now support sanctions.
Conclusions
Although there is not unanimity among
black South Africans, growing impatience
with the South African government's unwill
ingness to adopt meaningful reforms is
producing increased support among black
South Africans for some form of disinvest
ment policy. This trend is reflected most
vividly in COSATU's recent statement in
support of unconditional disinvestment. It
is bolstered by UDF's recent stance in oppo
sition to any new foreign investment in
South Africa, and public opinion polls sug
gesting both increased support for eco
nomic sanctions and plurality allegiance to
the ANC, an aggressive proponent of disin
vestment policy.
In summary,
1) The superfederation of non-racial
(predominantly black) labor unions
(COSATU) supports disinvestment or the
threat of disinvestment even though this
may require significant personal sacrifice
by some of its members.
2) The premier black political organiza
tion (ANC), which enjoys strong plurality
support by black South Africans, has sup
ported disinvestment for at least 20 years,
and most of the other top black organiza
tions and leaders now take a similar posi
tion.
3) Although black public opinion surveys
are far from conclusive, they do suggest that
a majority of urban blacks with an opinion
now support (i) sanctions, (ii) either un
conditional or conditional disinvestment,
and (iii) the view that disinvestment will ac
tually help in pressuring the government to
end apartheid.

As moral overseers of Stanford Univer
sity's investment policy, we believe that a
critical element in any decision on the
question of disinvestment must be the pref
erence of those in whose interests an end to
apartheid is being sought Accordingly, the
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) has endeavored to examine the major
pieces available on black South African atti
tudes toward economic sanctions and disin
vestment for some indication of public
sentiment.
These pieces consist of policy statements
of the major political groups, labor unions
and federations; interviews, statements and
speeches of prominent South African politi
cal social leaders; public opinion surveys
conducted between June 1984 and July
1986; and pertinent summary documents
prepared by the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC). Consistent with these
source documents, our findings are broken
down into the following categories: trade
unions; political groups and political
leaders; and public opinion polls and sur
veys. -
South African security laws prohibiting
political subversion are thought by many to
outlaw expression or advocacy of disinvest
ment policy, in fact, Allan Boesak was
"detained" under these laws just last year
on charges which included inciting disin
vestment activity and economic boycotts. As
a result, certain findings cited here may un
derestimate the extent to which disinvest
ment is actually favored by the black
popluation.
Trade Unions
A recent indication of workers' views on
disinvestment comes from the newly
formed (predominantly black) non-racial
trade union "superfederation" called
COSATU (Congress of South African Un
ions). COSATU, which was officially
launched Nov. 30, 1985, is a composite of
FOSATU (a predecessor multi-racial
umbrella federation), the National Union of
Mine Workers (the largest trade union in
South Africa), the Commercial, Catering
and Allied Workers of South Africa, the
Food and Canning Workers Union, Cape
Town Municipal Workers Association, the
General Workers Union, the United Mining,
Metal and Allied Workers Unions of South
Africa, the Retail and Allied Workers Union
and unions affiliated with the United Demo
cratic Front and National Federation of
Workers. This merger makes COSATU the
largest federation of unionized workers in

South Africa, embracing 33 unions and
450,000 individual members.
At its first official conference in 1984,
COSATU approved what is regarded as the
first explicit call by a major South African
union or federation of unions for disinvest
ment. The applicable resolution (which)
passed reads: "This Congress: 1 Believes
that all forms of international pressure on
the South African government — including
disinvestment or the threat of disinvestment
— is an essential and effective form of pres
sure on the South African regime, and we
support it."
This pronouncement represents a
marked departure from the vague and cau
tious statements on disinvestment issued
previously by leading South African unions.
For example, a policy statement issued in
July, 1984 by the now-dissolved FOSATU, al
though supportive of pressures generated
by the disinvestment movement, stopped
short of calling for foreign companies to
withdraw. Similarly, CUSA (Council of Un
ions of South Africa), a significant black un
ion federation which decided not to join
FOSATI! (due to differences about union
policy with respect to race), stated in 1984
that it to welcomes pressures exerted by
disinvestment activity without specifically
urging disinvestment. It did, however,
adopt a resolution late in 1984 calling for
no new investment in South Africa by
foreign countries and companies.
The reluctance of South African unions in
the past to urge a policy of disinvestment
has been attributed not only to South
African security laws, but also to the adverse
personal consequences disinvestment
policy represents to workers. The signifi
cance of the COSATU position, therefore, is
that workers now appear to be saying that
they are willing to accept significant per
sonal sacrifices in order to end apartheid.
Political Groups and Leaders:
African National Congress (ANC) —
Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo
The oldest and most outspoken of South
Africa's liberation groups, the ANC is
believed to have the plurality of black South
African support. Leadership of this non
racial (predominantly black) organization,
now headed by President Oliver Tambo,
has included such notable national figures
as 1960 Nobel Prize winner Chief Albert
Luthuli and jailed activist Nelson Mandela.
The ANC was banned by the government in
1960 after abandoning its long-term policy
of non-violent opposition in favor of a cam

paign of armed resistance.
Clirrent membership figures for the ANC
are unavailable, due in part to its banned
status, but polls and survey* consistently
suggest that this organisation (and "Man
dela ) have the largest African support of any
opposition group, making it a decisive force
in South African politics \\ ith which the gov
eminent must deal if meaningful negotia
tions are to take place. Referring to
pollsters from across the political spec-,
trum. a recent article in The New Republic
(2) indicates that ' no other organization
and no other individual receives even half
as much support" from blacks. In the words
of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, "The ANC is
the premier black political organization.
The fact that many of its members have paid
a very heavy price has enhanced its prestige
and credibility."
According to a recent New York Times ar
tide (4), the ANC and allied groups — the
UDF and COSATU (both described below)
— "have largely pushed aside rival black
groups, such as Inkatha, the Zulu based po
litical machine of Chief Gatsha Buthelesi."
The group has long-term ties with the
South African Communist Party and accord
ing to the same New York l imes account,
currently receives roughly half of its overall
support in the form of military aid from
Soviet-bloc countries. Nevertheless, most of
the old guard within the ANC, including
Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo,. are not
communist, and most experts agree that
"the practical importance of this Commu
nist influence is almost impossible to
gauge."
Furthermore, there is general agreement
that nearly all ANC leaders and members
are, first and foremost, black nationalists
whose primary political goal is the elimina
tion of apartheid and the establishment of
a just non-racial political system in South
Africa. The ANC receives substantial finan
cial support from both nations and charities
in the West, and even some Reagan admin
istration officials now are calling for the
freeing of Nelson Mandela and the es
tablishment of direct negotiations between
the ANC and the South African government.

For at least the last 20 years, the ANi hxs
advocated disinvestment by foreigfi V,ln,
panies It also supports trade sanctions artd
divestment of stuck in companies doing
business in South Africa.
United Democratic Front (l'I)F) —
Allan Boesak and Partlck I.ekota
The I'DF is one of the largest and most
diverse of the country's legal opposition
groups, representing over one million
people in over 600 community, religious
and student organizations. Its meml>erslup
is thought to overlap significantly with tlrat
of its underground ally, the ANC Tin's n< uv
racial (predominantly black) organization
and its leaders openly urge foreign pres
sure on the South African government v>
end apartheid In a statement issued Aug..s,
19HS, UDF called on foreign business 10
make no new investment in South \friia
and to end "all forms of Financial ma
terial assistance to the South Afric.m gijv
ernment, the homelands and South' African
businesses.
In an Interview with the Investor
Responsibility Research Center (IRRO ayv
ducted a year before this statement wits
drafted, Boesak urged foreign companies Jo
adopt policies of conditional withdrawal h\
specifying tij Pretoria that they ya>u)d
withdraw tlieir operations from, South
Africa by a certain date if Pretoria did i\ot
meet specific demands for political n form.
Since that time, Boesak is believed ty h.iye
advocated a policy of disfnvestment'during
local meetings. It is this belief, together
with other alleged reform activity, that
resulted in Boesak's short-term "detehtioh"
last year.
Azanian People's Organization
(AZAPO)
This black consciousness group was or
ganized in the 1960s under the leaderslijp
of Steve Biko, who died in 1977 while in
detention (many believe at the hands of the
South African police). To the IRRC's know!
edge, AZAPO has not issued any statement
on investment policy to date. However, it is
assumed that this group favors disjnvej-t
ment on the basis of the strong stance
against capitalism and imperialism.
And, in fact, in an interview conducted
earlier this year by the IRRC, Saths Cooper,
the president of AZAPO, made several state
ments critical of foreign investment in
South Africa that supported this assump
tion. As reported by the IRRC, Saths argued:
1) that "multinational corporations' involve
ment in South Africa is not altruistic or
humanitarian, but rather an investment in
the status quo, and that their commitment
to social responsibility has been minimal;
and 2) that companies, by providing funds
for black health, education and other com
munity development projects, "merely
relieve the government of its own obliga
tions, enabling it to allocate more resources
for repressive purposes."
South African Council of Churches
(SACC)
This group, whose membership is
primarily black, adopted a resolution at its
national conference on June 28, 1985,
stating that "disinvestment and similar eco
nomic pressure are now called for as a
peaceful and effective means of putting
pressure on the South African government
to bring about those fundamental changes
this country needs."
It is important to point out that resolu
tions supporting disinvestment had been
proposed but not adopted in prior years.
Strong support last year for the adoption of
a resolution in support of disinvestment is
felt by SACC administrative officials to be
due to the increased radicalization of the
SACC membership generated by the polit
cal events of last year.
Bishop Tutu
Bishop Desmond Tutu, recipient of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, Archbishop of
Cape Town and former head of the SACC,
openly criticizes American and foreign in
vestment generally in South Africa. Since
1983, he has supported a policy of condi
tional withdrawal (threatened and actual
withdrawal by companies if specific
demands for reform are not met within a
certain period of time). Standing by the
March 1986 deadline he gave last year for
compliance with his set of reform demands,
Bishop Tutu on April 2, 1986 called publicly
on the international community to apply
punitive economic sanctions against South
Africa. In his April statement, Tutu did not
urge disinvesment specifically, but rather
something "effective ... concerted and
united." by so doing, Tutu risks criminal
prosecution under South Africa's security
laws.
Labor Party
Prior to 1985, the "colored" (mixed
races) Labor Party long had supported dis
investment. Then, after the founding of a
new colored chamber of parliament (but
none for blacks) in August, 1984, the Labor
Part>- reversed its position at its annual con
ference in January 1985 and called instead
for a five-year moratorium on efforts to stop
foreign investment.
Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha
Chief Gaisha Buthelezi, chief minister of
the Kwa-Zulu homeland, and his Inkatha or
ganization solidly favor increased invest
ment by foreign companies that adhere to
certain social responsiblity standards. The
members of Inkatha rival UDF members in
numbers (nearly a million) but, unlike UDF

members, are from more rural than urban
areas. Chief Buthelezi is a controversial fig
ure in South Africa. According to IRRC (5),
"Buthelezi is viewed by many urban blacks
as having "sold out" to Pretoria, in part be
cause he has often criticized politically in
spired student boycotts and work stavaways
mobilized by other black organizations or
unions. To many of his black critics, But
helezi is an extension of the South African
government, rather than an opponent of it."
In fact. Chief Buthelezi and many Inkatha
members are, in a sense, employees of the
government through the KwaZulu adminis
tration which is funded by Pretoria.

Trade Unions
A recent indication of workers' views on
disinvestment comes from the newly
formed (predominantly black) non-racial
trade union "superfederation" called
COSATU (Congress of South African Un
ions). COSATU, which was officially
launched Nov. 30, 1985, is a composite of
FOSATU (a predecessor multi-racial
umbrella federation), the National Union of
Mine Workers (the largest trade union in
South Africa), the Commercial, Catering
and Allied Workers of South Africa, the
Food and Canning Workers Union, Cape
Town Municipal Workers Association, the
General Workers Union, the United Mining,
Metal and Allied Workers Unions of South
Africa, the Retail and Allied Workers Union
and unions affiliated with the United Demo
cratic Front and National Federation of
Workers. This merger makes COSATU the
largest federation of unionized workers in

South Africa, embracing 33 unions and
450,000 individual members.
At its first official conference in 1984,
COSATU approved what is regarded as the
first explicit call by a major South African
union or federation of unions for disinvest
ment. The applicable resolution (which)
passed reads: "This Congress: 1 Believes
that all forms of international pressure on
the South African government — including
disinvestment or the threat of disinvestment
— is an essential and effective form of pres
sure on the South African regime, and we
support it."
This pronouncement represents a
marked departure from the vague and cau
tious statements on disinvestment issued
previously by leading South African unions.
For example, a policy statement issued in
July, 1984 by the now-dissolved FOSATU, al
though supportive of pressures generated
by the disinvestment movement, stopped
short of calling for foreign companies to
withdraw. Similarly, CUSA (Council of Un
ions of South Africa), a significant black un
ion federation which decided not to join
FOSATI! (due to differences about union
policy with respect to race), stated in 1984
that it to welcomes pressures exerted by
disinvestment activity without specifically
urging disinvestment. It did, however,
adopt a resolution late in 1984 calling for
no new investment in South Africa by
foreign countries and companies.
The reluctance of South African unions in
the past to urge a policy of disinvestment
has been attributed not only to South
African security laws, but also to the adverse
personal consequences disinvestment
policy represents to workers. The signifi
cance of the COSATU position, therefore, is
that workers now appear to be saying that
they are willing to accept significant per
sonal sacrifices in order to end apartheid.
Political Groups and Leaders:
African National Congress (ANC) —
Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo
The oldest and most outspoken of South
Africa's liberation groups, the ANC is
believed to have the plurality of black South
African support. Leadership of this non
racial (predominantly black) organization,
now headed by President Oliver Tambo,
has included such notable national figures
as 1960 Nobel Prize winner Chief Albert
Luthuli and jailed activist Nelson Mandela.
The ANC was banned by the government in
1960 after abandoning its long-term policy
of non-violent opposition in favor of a cam

paign of armed resistance.
Clirrent membership figures for the ANC
are unavailable, due in part to its banned
status, but polls and survey* consistently
suggest that this organisation (and "Man
dela ) have the largest African support of any
opposition group, making it a decisive force
in South African politics \\ ith which the gov
eminent must deal if meaningful negotia
tions are to take place. Referring to
pollsters from across the political spec-,
trum. a recent article in The New Republic
(2) indicates that ' no other organization
and no other individual receives even half
as much support" from blacks. In the words
of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, "The ANC is
the premier black political organization.
The fact that many of its members have paid
a very heavy price has enhanced its prestige
and credibility."
According to a recent New York Times ar
tide (4), the ANC and allied groups — the
UDF and COSATU (both described below)
— "have largely pushed aside rival black
groups, such as Inkatha, the Zulu based po
litical machine of Chief Gatsha Buthelesi."
The group has long-term ties with the
South African Communist Party and accord
ing to the same New York l imes account,
currently receives roughly half of its overall
support in the form of military aid from
Soviet-bloc countries. Nevertheless, most of
the old guard within the ANC, including
Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo,. are not
communist, and most experts agree that
"the practical importance of this Commu
nist influence is almost impossible to
gauge."
Furthermore, there is general agreement
that nearly all ANC leaders and members
are, first and foremost, black nationalists
whose primary political goal is the elimina
tion of apartheid and the establishment of
a just non-racial political system in South
Africa. The ANC receives substantial finan
cial support from both nations and charities
in the West, and even some Reagan admin
istration officials now are calling for the
freeing of Nelson Mandela and the es
tablishment of direct negotiations between
the ANC and the South African government.

For at least the last 20 years, the ANi hxs
advocated disinvestment by foreigfi V,ln,
panies It also supports trade sanctions artd
divestment of stuck in companies doing
business in South Africa.
United Democratic Front (l'I)F) —
Allan Boesak and Partlck I.ekota
The I'DF is one of the largest and most
diverse of the country's legal opposition
groups, representing over one million
people in over 600 community, religious
and student organizations. Its meml>erslup
is thought to overlap significantly with tlrat
of its underground ally, the ANC Tin's n< uv
racial (predominantly black) organization
and its leaders openly urge foreign pres
sure on the South African government v>
end apartheid In a statement issued Aug..s,
19HS, UDF called on foreign business 10
make no new investment in South \friia
and to end "all forms of Financial ma
terial assistance to the South Afric.m gijv
ernment, the homelands and South' African
businesses.
In an Interview with the Investor
Responsibility Research Center (IRRO ayv
ducted a year before this statement wits
drafted, Boesak urged foreign companies Jo
adopt policies of conditional withdrawal h\
specifying tij Pretoria that they ya>u)d
withdraw tlieir operations from, South
Africa by a certain date if Pretoria did i\ot
meet specific demands for political n form.
Since that time, Boesak is believed ty h.iye
advocated a policy of disfnvestment'during
local meetings. It is this belief, together
with other alleged reform activity, that
resulted in Boesak's short-term "detehtioh"
last year.
Azanian People's Organization
(AZAPO)
This black consciousness group was or
ganized in the 1960s under the leaderslijp
of Steve Biko, who died in 1977 while in
detention (many believe at the hands of the
South African police). To the IRRC's know!
edge, AZAPO has not issued any statement
on investment policy to date. However, it is
assumed that this group favors disjnvej-t
ment on the basis of the strong stance
against capitalism and imperialism.
And, in fact, in an interview conducted
earlier this year by the IRRC, Saths Cooper,
the president of AZAPO, made several state
ments critical of foreign investment in
South Africa that supported this assump
tion. As reported by the IRRC, Saths argued:
1) that "multinational corporations' involve
ment in South Africa is not altruistic or
humanitarian, but rather an investment in
the status quo, and that their commitment
to social responsibility has been minimal;
and 2) that companies, by providing funds
for black health, education and other com
munity development projects, "merely
relieve the government of its own obliga
tions, enabling it to allocate more resources
for repressive purposes."
South African Council of Churches
(SACC)
This group, whose membership is
primarily black, adopted a resolution at its
national conference on June 28, 1985,
stating that "disinvestment and similar eco
nomic pressure are now called for as a
peaceful and effective means of putting
pressure on the South African government
to bring about those fundamental changes
this country needs."
It is important to point out that resolu
tions supporting disinvestment had been
proposed but not adopted in prior years.
Strong support last year for the adoption of
a resolution in support of disinvestment is
felt by SACC administrative officials to be
due to the increased radicalization of the
SACC membership generated by the polit
cal events of last year.
Bishop Tutu
Bishop Desmond Tutu, recipient of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, Archbishop of
Cape Town and former head of the SACC,
openly criticizes American and foreign in
vestment generally in South Africa. Since
1983, he has supported a policy of condi
tional withdrawal (threatened and actual
withdrawal by companies if specific
demands for reform are not met within a
certain period of time). Standing by the
March 1986 deadline he gave last year for
compliance with his set of reform demands,
Bishop Tutu on April 2, 1986 called publicly
on the international community to apply
punitive economic sanctions against South
Africa. In his April statement, Tutu did not
urge disinvesment specifically, but rather
something "effective ... concerted and
united." by so doing, Tutu risks criminal
prosecution under South Africa's security
laws.
Labor Party
Prior to 1985, the "colored" (mixed
races) Labor Party long had supported dis
investment. Then, after the founding of a
new colored chamber of parliament (but
none for blacks) in August, 1984, the Labor
Part>- reversed its position at its annual con
ference in January 1985 and called instead
for a five-year moratorium on efforts to stop
foreign investment.
Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha
Chief Gaisha Buthelezi, chief minister of
the Kwa-Zulu homeland, and his Inkatha or
ganization solidly favor increased invest
ment by foreign companies that adhere to
certain social responsiblity standards. The
members of Inkatha rival UDF members in
numbers (nearly a million) but, unlike UDF

members, are from more rural than urban
areas. Chief Buthelezi is a controversial fig
ure in South Africa. According to IRRC (5),
"Buthelezi is viewed by many urban blacks
as having "sold out" to Pretoria, in part be
cause he has often criticized politically in
spired student boycotts and work stavaways
mobilized by other black organizations or
unions. To many of his black critics, But
helezi is an extension of the South African
government, rather than an opponent of it."
In fact. Chief Buthelezi and many Inkatha
members are, in a sense, employees of the
government through the KwaZulu adminis
tration which is funded by Pretoria.
Black Public Opinion Surveys
In turning next to surveys of black public
opinion for enlightenment on what black
South Africans want us to do, one harsh
reality must be recognized. For many black
South Africans, the main issue they must ad
dress is survival — obtaining the basic es
sential to get through another day. Policy is
sues such as disinvestment may be beyond
their frame of reference. Those reached by
surveys would tend to be less impoverished
blacks, such as those who have employment
in an urban setting, and even they may not
have considered such policy issues before
being questioned. Therefore, the well
considered views of black leaders, includ
ing the leadership of the national black or
ganizations cited in the preceding sections,
probably have more significance than the
results of black opinion surveys.
As described in some detail in an IRRC
report (5), five major surveys of black
public opinion were taken between June
1984 and July 1986. These surveys are des
cribed in the following table, and then the
major results are summarized in the second
table.
(Tables here are omitted.)
Analysis of Survey Results
Although most black leaders, including
the leadership of national black organiza
tions, have dealt with the complex issues of
disinvestment and sanctions, it is unclear
whether there issues have received much
consideration by the general black public. If
well-formed opinions have not been
reached prior to being questioned by sur
vey takers, one would expect differences in
how surveys approach these issues to yield
substantial differences in the results, and
such differences in results have indeed oc
curred. Consequently, given the enormous
differences in wording and polling met
hodologies of the various surveys con
ducted to date, it is impossible to arrive at
many foolproof conclusions about African
sentiment toward sanctions and/or disin
vestment. In fact, a selective reader of the
survey results can find support for almost
any position. It is probably fair to conclude
from survey findings, however, that:
1) Of those urban blacks who support
economic pressure by foreign countries
against the government, the majority appear
to support pressure at the risk of personal
sacrifice.
2) It appears that a majority of urban
blacks think that disinvestment will actually
help in pressuring the government to end
apartheid.
3) Given a spectrum of policy options re
garding the disinvestment issue, a large
majority of urban blacks appear to support
either unconditional disinvestment or con
ditional disinvestment (disinvestment un
less the company is actively pressuring the
government to end apartheid).
Can any other tentative conclusions be
drawn? In a scholarly analysis of the survey

results summarized above, Rich Brody (1)
has drawn the following interpretations:
1) It is likely that before the state of emer
gency was imposed this past spring, about
25 to 30 percent of urban black South
Africans supported unconditional disinvest
ment and other forms of foreign economic
sanctions.
2) It is likely that a shift in opinion has
taken place since the state of emergency
was imposed.
3) Among urban blacks with an opinion
about the issue of economic sanctions, it is
likely that a majority now support sanctions.
Conclusions
Although there is not unanimity among
black South Africans, growing impatience
with the South African government's unwill
ingness to adopt meaningful reforms is
producing increased support among black
South Africans for some form of disinvest
ment policy. This trend is reflected most
vividly in COSATU's recent statement in
support of unconditional disinvestment. It
is bolstered by UDF's recent stance in oppo
sition to any new foreign investment in
South Africa, and public opinion polls sug
gesting both increased support for eco
nomic sanctions and plurality allegiance to
the ANC, an aggressive proponent of disin
vestment policy.
In summary,
1) The superfederation of non-racial
(predominantly black) labor unions
(COSATU) supports disinvestment or the
threat of disinvestment even though this
may require significant personal sacrifice
by some of its members.
2) The premier black political organiza
tion (ANC), which enjoys strong plurality
support by black South Africans, has sup
ported disinvestment for at least 20 years,
and most of the other top black organiza
tions and leaders now take a similar posi
tion.
3) Although black public opinion surveys
are far from conclusive, they do suggest that
a majority of urban blacks with an opinion
now support (i) sanctions, (ii) either un
conditional or conditional disinvestment,
and (iii) the view that disinvestment will ac
tually help in pressuring the government to
end apartheid.

As moral overseers of Stanford Univer
sity's investment policy, we believe that a
critical element in any decision on the
question of disinvestment must be the pref
erence of those in whose interests an end to
apartheid is being sought Accordingly, the
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) has endeavored to examine the major
pieces available on black South African atti
tudes toward economic sanctions and disin
vestment for some indication of public
sentiment.
These pieces consist of policy statements
of the major political groups, labor unions
and federations; interviews, statements and
speeches of prominent South African politi
cal social leaders; public opinion surveys
conducted between June 1984 and July
1986; and pertinent summary documents
prepared by the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC). Consistent with these
source documents, our findings are broken
down into the following categories: trade
unions; political groups and political
leaders; and public opinion polls and sur
veys. -
South African security laws prohibiting
political subversion are thought by many to
outlaw expression or advocacy of disinvest
ment policy, in fact, Allan Boesak was
"detained" under these laws just last year
on charges which included inciting disin
vestment activity and economic boycotts. As
a result, certain findings cited here may un
derestimate the extent to which disinvest
ment is actually favored by the black
popluation.
Trade Unions
A recent indication of workers' views on
disinvestment comes from the newly
formed (predominantly black) non-racial
trade union "superfederation" called
COSATU (Congress of South African Un
ions). COSATU, which was officially
launched Nov. 30, 1985, is a composite of
FOSATU (a predecessor multi-racial
umbrella federation), the National Union of
Mine Workers (the largest trade union in
South Africa), the Commercial, Catering
and Allied Workers of South Africa, the
Food and Canning Workers Union, Cape
Town Municipal Workers Association, the
General Workers Union, the United Mining,
Metal and Allied Workers Unions of South
Africa, the Retail and Allied Workers Union
and unions affiliated with the United Demo
cratic Front and National Federation of
Workers. This merger makes COSATU the
largest federation of unionized workers in

South Africa, embracing 33 unions and
450,000 individual members.
At its first official conference in 1984,
COSATU approved what is regarded as the
first explicit call by a major South African
union or federation of unions for disinvest
ment. The applicable resolution (which)
passed reads: "This Congress: 1 Believes
that all forms of international pressure on
the South African government — including
disinvestment or the threat of disinvestment
— is an essential and effective form of pres
sure on the South African regime, and we
support it."
This pronouncement represents a
marked departure from the vague and cau
tious statements on disinvestment issued
previously by leading South African unions.
For example, a policy statement issued in
July, 1984 by the now-dissolved FOSATU, al
though supportive of pressures generated
by the disinvestment movement, stopped
short of calling for foreign companies to
withdraw. Similarly, CUSA (Council of Un
ions of South Africa), a significant black un
ion federation which decided not to join
FOSATI! (due to differences about union
policy with respect to race), stated in 1984
that it to welcomes pressures exerted by
disinvestment activity without specifically
urging disinvestment. It did, however,
adopt a resolution late in 1984 calling for
no new investment in South Africa by
foreign countries and companies.
The reluctance of South African unions in
the past to urge a policy of disinvestment
has been attributed not only to South
African security laws, but also to the adverse
personal consequences disinvestment
policy represents to workers. The signifi
cance of the COSATU position, therefore, is
that workers now appear to be saying that
they are willing to accept significant per
sonal sacrifices in order to end apartheid.
Political Groups and Leaders:
African National Congress (ANC) —
Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo
The oldest and most outspoken of South
Africa's liberation groups, the ANC is
believed to have the plurality of black South
African support. Leadership of this non
racial (predominantly black) organization,
now headed by President Oliver Tambo,
has included such notable national figures
as 1960 Nobel Prize winner Chief Albert
Luthuli and jailed activist Nelson Mandela.
The ANC was banned by the government in
1960 after abandoning its long-term policy
of non-violent opposition in favor of a cam

paign of armed resistance.
Clirrent membership figures for the ANC
are unavailable, due in part to its banned
status, but polls and survey* consistently
suggest that this organisation (and "Man
dela ) have the largest African support of any
opposition group, making it a decisive force
in South African politics \\ ith which the gov

and no other individual receives even half
as much support" from blacks. In the words
of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, "The ANC is

and credibility."
According to a recent New York Times ar

UDF and COSATU (both described below)
— "have largely pushed aside rival black
groups, such as Inkatha, the Zulu based po
litical machine of Chief Gatsha Buthelesi."
The group has long-term ties with the

For at least the last 20 years, the ANi hxs
advocated disinvestment by foreigfi V,ln,
panies It also supports trade sanctions artd
divestment of stuck in companies doing
business in South Africa.
United Democratic Front (l'I)F) —
Allan Boesak and Partlck I.ekota
The I'DF is one of the largest and most
diverse of the country's legal opposition
groups, representing over one million
people in over 600 community, religious
and student organizations. Its meml>erslup
is thought to overlap significantly with tlrat
of its underground ally, the ANC Tin's n< uv

munity development projects, "merely

South African Council of Churches
(SACC)
This group, whose membership is
primarily black, adopted a resolution at its
national conference on June 28, 1985,
stating that "disinvestment and similar eco
nomic pressure are now called for as a
peaceful and effective means of putting
pressure on the South African government
to bring about those fundamental changes
this country needs."
It is important to point out that resolu
tions supporting disinvestment had been
proposed but not adopted in prior years.
Strong support last year for the adoption of
a resolution in support of disinvestment is
felt by SACC administrative officials to be
due to the increased radicalization of the
SACC membership generated by the polit
cal events of last year.
Bishop Tutu
Bishop Desmond Tutu, recipient of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, Archbishop of
Cape Town and former head of the SACC,
openly criticizes American and foreign in
vestment generally in South Africa. Since
1983, he has supported a policy of condi

punitive economic sanctions against South
Africa. In his April statement, Tutu did not
urge disinvesment specifically, but rather
something "effective ... concerted and

prosecution under South Africa's security

Labor Party
Prior to 1985, the "colored" (mixed
races) Labor Party long had supported dis
investment. Then, after the founding of a
new colored chamber of parliament (but
none for blacks) in August, 1984, the Labor
Part>- reversed its position at its annual con
ference in January 1985 and called instead
for a five-year moratorium on efforts to stop
foreign investment.
Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha
Chief Gaisha Buthelezi, chief minister of
the Kwa-Zulu homeland, and his Inkatha or
ganization solidly favor increased invest
ment by foreign companies that adhere to
certain social responsiblity standards. The
members of Inkatha rival UDF members in
numbers (nearly a million) but, unlike UDF

members, are from more rural than urban
areas. Chief Buthelezi is a controversial fig
ure in South Africa. According to IRRC (5),
"Buthelezi is viewed by many urban blacks

cause he has often criticized politically in
spired student boycotts and work stavaways

In fact. Chief Buthelezi and many Inkatha
members are, in a sense, employees of the

on Disinvestment," Investor Responsibility
Research Center report, July 1986.
(All reference materials are on reserve at
Meyer Library.)
As moral overseers of Stanford Univer
sity's investment policy, we believe that a
critical element in any decision on the
question of disinvestment must be the pref
erence of those in whose interests an end to
apartheid is being sought Accordingly, the
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) has endeavored to examine the major
pieces available on black South African atti
tudes toward economic sanctions and disin
vestment for some indication of public
sentiment.
These pieces consist of policy statements
of the major political groups, labor unions
and federations; interviews, statements and
speeches of prominent South African politi
cal social leaders; public opinion surveys
conducted between June 1984 and July
1986; and pertinent summary documents
prepared by the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC). Consistent with these
source documents, our findings are broken
down into the following categories: trade
unions; political groups and political
leaders; and public opinion polls and sur
veys. -
South African security laws prohibiting
political subversion are thought by many to
outlaw expression or advocacy of disinvest
ment policy, in fact, Allan Boesak was
"detained" under these laws just last year
on charges which included inciting disin
vestment activity and economic boycotts. As
a result, certain findings cited here may un
derestimate the extent to which disinvest
ment is actually favored by the black
popluation.
Trade Unions
A recent indication of workers' views on
disinvestment comes from the newly
formed (predominantly black) non-racial
trade union "superfederation" called
COSATU (Congress of South African Un
ions). COSATU, which was officially
launched Nov. 30, 1985, is a composite of
FOSATU (a predecessor multi-racial
umbrella federation), the National Union of
Mine Workers (the largest trade union in
South Africa), the Commercial, Catering
and Allied Workers of South Africa, the
Food and Canning Workers Union, Cape
Town Municipal Workers Association, the
General Workers Union, the United Mining,
Metal and Allied Workers Unions of South
Africa, the Retail and Allied Workers Union
and unions affiliated with the United Demo
cratic Front and National Federation of
Workers. This merger makes COSATU the
largest federation of unionized workers in

South Africa, embracing 33 unions and
450,000 individual members.
At its first official conference in 1984,
COSATU approved what is regarded as the
first explicit call by a major South African
union or federation of unions for disinvest
ment. The applicable resolution (which)
passed reads: "This Congress: 1 Believes
that all forms of international pressure on
the South African government — including
disinvestment or the threat of disinvestment
— is an essential and effective form of pres
sure on the South African regime, and we
support it."
This pronouncement represents a
marked departure from the vague and cau
tious statements on disinvestment issued
previously by leading South African unions.
For example, a policy statement issued in
July, 1984 by the now-dissolved FOSATU, al
though supportive of pressures generated
by the disinvestment movement, stopped
short of calling for foreign companies to
withdraw. Similarly, CUSA (Council of Un
ions of South Africa), a significant black un
ion federation which decided not to join
FOSATI! (due to differences about union
policy with respect to race), stated in 1984
that it to welcomes pressures exerted by
disinvestment activity without specifically
urging disinvestment. It did, however,
adopt a resolution late in 1984 calling for
no new investment in South Africa by
foreign countries and companies.
The reluctance of South African unions in
the past to urge a policy of disinvestment
has been attributed not only to South
African security laws, but also to the adverse
personal consequences disinvestment
policy represents to workers. The signifi
cance of the COSATU position, therefore, is
that workers now appear to be saying that
they are willing to accept significant per
sonal sacrifices in order to end apartheid.
Political Groups and Leaders:
African National Congress (ANC) —
Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo
The oldest and most outspoken of South
Africa's liberation groups, the ANC is
believed to have the plurality of black South
African support. Leadership of this non
racial (predominantly black) organization,
now headed by President Oliver Tambo,
has included such notable national figures
as 1960 Nobel Prize winner Chief Albert
Luthuli and jailed activist Nelson Mandela.
The ANC was banned by the government in
1960 after abandoning its long-term policy
of non-violent opposition in favor of a cam

paign of armed resistance.
Clirrent membership figures for the ANC
are unavailable, due in part to its banned
status, but polls and survey* consistently
suggest that this organisation (and "Man
dela ) have the largest African support of any
opposition group, making it a decisive force
in South African politics \\ ith which the gov
eminent must deal if meaningful negotia
tions are to take place. Referring to
pollsters from across the political spec-,
trum. a recent article in The New Republic
(2) indicates that ' no other organization
and no other individual receives even half
as much support" from blacks. In the words
of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, "The ANC is
the premier black political organization.
The fact that many of its members have paid
a very heavy price has enhanced its prestige
and credibility."
According to a recent New York Times ar
tide (4), the ANC and allied groups — the
UDF and COSATU (both described below)
— "have largely pushed aside rival black
groups, such as Inkatha, the Zulu based po
litical machine of Chief Gatsha Buthelesi."
The group has long-term ties with the
South African Communist Party and accord
ing to the same New York l imes account,
currently receives roughly half of its overall
support in the form of military aid from
Soviet-bloc countries. Nevertheless, most of
the old guard within the ANC, including
Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo,. are not
communist, and most experts agree that
"the practical importance of this Commu
nist influence is almost impossible to
gauge."
Furthermore, there is general agreement
that nearly all ANC leaders and members
are, first and foremost, black nationalists
whose primary political goal is the elimina
tion of apartheid and the establishment of
a just non-racial political system in South
Africa. The ANC receives substantial finan
cial support from both nations and charities
in the West, and even some Reagan admin
istration officials now are calling for the
freeing of Nelson Mandela and the es
tablishment of direct negotiations between
the ANC and the South African government.

For at least the last 20 years, the ANi hxs
advocated disinvestment by foreigfi V,ln,
panies It also supports trade sanctions artd
divestment of stuck in companies doing
business in South Africa.
United Democratic Front (l'I)F) —
Allan Boesak and Partlck I.ekota
The I'DF is one of the largest and most
diverse of the country's legal opposition
groups, representing over one million
people in over 600 community, religious
and student organizations. Its meml>erslup
is thought to overlap significantly with tlrat
of its underground ally, the ANC Tin's n< uv
racial (predominantly black) organization
and its leaders openly urge foreign pres
sure on the South African government v>
end apartheid In a statement issued Aug..s,
19HS, UDF called on foreign business 10
make no new investment in South \friia
and to end "all forms of Financial ma
terial assistance to the South Afric.m gijv
ernment, the homelands and South' African
businesses.
In an Interview with the Investor
Responsibility Research Center (IRRO ayv
ducted a year before this statement wits
drafted, Boesak urged foreign companies Jo
adopt policies of conditional withdrawal h\
specifying tij Pretoria that they ya>u)d
withdraw tlieir operations from, South
Africa by a certain date if Pretoria did i\ot
meet specific demands for political n form.
Since that time, Boesak is believed ty h.iye
advocated a policy of disfnvestment'during
local meetings. It is this belief, together
with other alleged reform activity, that
resulted in Boesak's short-term "detehtioh"
last year.
Azanian People's Organization
(AZAPO)
This black consciousness group was or
ganized in the 1960s under the leaderslijp
of Steve Biko, who died in 1977 while in
detention (many believe at the hands of the
South African police). To the IRRC's know!
edge, AZAPO has not issued any statement
on investment policy to date. However, it is
assumed that this group favors disjnvej-t
ment on the basis of the strong stance
against capitalism and imperialism.
And, in fact, in an interview conducted
earlier this year by the IRRC, Saths Cooper,
the president of AZAPO, made several state
ments critical of foreign investment in
South Africa that supported this assump
tion. As reported by the IRRC, Saths argued:
1) that "multinational corporations' involve
ment in South Africa is not altruistic or
humanitarian, but rather an investment in
the status quo, and that their commitment
to social responsibility has been minimal;
and 2) that companies, by providing funds
for black health, education and other com
munity development projects, "merely
relieve the government of its own obliga
tions, enabling it to allocate more resources
for repressive purposes."
South African Council of Churches
(SACC)
This group, whose membership is
primarily black, adopted a resolution at its
national conference on June 28, 1985,
stating that "disinvestment and similar eco
nomic pressure are now called for as a
peaceful and effective means of putting
pressure on the South African government
to bring about those fundamental changes
this country needs."
It is important to point out that resolu
tions supporting disinvestment had been
proposed but not adopted in prior years.
Strong support last year for the adoption of
a resolution in support of disinvestment is
felt by SACC administrative officials to be
due to the increased radicalization of the
SACC membership generated by the polit
cal events of last year.
Bishop Tutu
Bishop Desmond Tutu, recipient of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, Archbishop of
Cape Town and former head of the SACC,
openly criticizes American and foreign in
vestment generally in South Africa. Since
1983, he has supported a policy of condi
tional withdrawal (threatened and actual
withdrawal by companies if specific
demands for reform are not met within a
certain period of time). Standing by the
March 1986 deadline he gave last year for
compliance with his set of reform demands,
Bishop Tutu on April 2, 1986 called publicly
on the international community to apply
punitive economic sanctions against South
Africa. In his April statement, Tutu did not
urge disinvesment specifically, but rather
something "effective ... concerted and
united." by so doing, Tutu risks criminal
prosecution under South Africa's security
laws.
Labor Party
Prior to 1985, the "colored" (mixed
races) Labor Party long had supported dis
investment. Then, after the founding of a
new colored chamber of parliament (but
none for blacks) in August, 1984, the Labor
Part>- reversed its position at its annual con
ference in January 1985 and called instead
for a five-year moratorium on efforts to stop
foreign investment.
Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha
Chief Gaisha Buthelezi, chief minister of
the Kwa-Zulu homeland, and his Inkatha or
ganization solidly favor increased invest
ment by foreign companies that adhere to
certain social responsiblity standards. The
members of Inkatha rival UDF members in
numbers (nearly a million) but, unlike UDF

members, are from more rural than urban
areas. Chief Buthelezi is a controversial fig
ure in South Africa. According to IRRC (5),
"Buthelezi is viewed by many urban blacks
as having "sold out" to Pretoria, in part be
cause he has often criticized politically in
spired student boycotts and work stavaways
mobilized by other black organizations or
unions. To many of his black critics, But
helezi is an extension of the South African
government, rather than an opponent of it."
In fact. Chief Buthelezi and many Inkatha
members are, in a sense, employees of the
government through the KwaZulu adminis
tration which is funded by Pretoria.
Black Public Opinion Surveys
In turning next to surveys of black public
opinion for enlightenment on what black
South Africans want us to do, one harsh
reality must be recognized. For many black
South Africans, the main issue they must ad
dress is survival — obtaining the basic es
sential to get through another day. Policy is
sues such as disinvestment may be beyond
their frame of reference. Those reached by
surveys would tend to be less impoverished
blacks, such as those who have employment
in an urban setting, and even they may not
have considered such policy issues before
being questioned. Therefore, the well
considered views of black leaders, includ
ing the leadership of the national black or
ganizations cited in the preceding sections,
probably have more significance than the
results of black opinion surveys.
As described in some detail in an IRRC
report (5), five major surveys of black
public opinion were taken between June
1984 and July 1986. These surveys are des
cribed in the following table, and then the
major results are summarized in the second
table.
(Tables here are omitted.)
Analysis of Survey Results
Although most black leaders, including
the leadership of national black organiza
tions, have dealt with the complex issues of
disinvestment and sanctions, it is unclear
whether there issues have received much
consideration by the general black public. If
well-formed opinions have not been
reached prior to being questioned by sur
vey takers, one would expect differences in
how surveys approach these issues to yield
substantial differences in the results, and
such differences in results have indeed oc
curred. Consequently, given the enormous
differences in wording and polling met
hodologies of the various surveys con
ducted to date, it is impossible to arrive at
many foolproof conclusions about African
sentiment toward sanctions and/or disin
vestment. In fact, a selective reader of the
survey results can find support for almost
any position. It is probably fair to conclude
from survey findings, however, that:
1) Of those urban blacks who support
economic pressure by foreign countries
against the government, the majority appear
to support pressure at the risk of personal
sacrifice.
2) It appears that a majority of urban
blacks think that disinvestment will actually
help in pressuring the government to end
apartheid.
3) Given a spectrum of policy options re
garding the disinvestment issue, a large
majority of urban blacks appear to support
either unconditional disinvestment or con
ditional disinvestment (disinvestment un
less the company is actively pressuring the
government to end apartheid).
Can any other tentative conclusions be
drawn? In a scholarly analysis of the survey

results summarized above, Rich Brody (1)
has drawn the following interpretations:
1) It is likely that before the state of emer
gency was imposed this past spring, about
25 to 30 percent of urban black South
Africans supported unconditional disinvest
ment and other forms of foreign economic
sanctions.
2) It is likely that a shift in opinion has
taken place since the state of emergency
was imposed.
3) Among urban blacks with an opinion
about the issue of economic sanctions, it is
likely that a majority now support sanctions.
Conclusions
Although there is not unanimity among
black South Africans, growing impatience
with the South African government's unwill
ingness to adopt meaningful reforms is
producing increased support among black
South Africans for some form of disinvest
ment policy. This trend is reflected most
vividly in COSATU's recent statement in
support of unconditional disinvestment. It
is bolstered by UDF's recent stance in oppo
sition to any new foreign investment in
South Africa, and public opinion polls sug
gesting both increased support for eco
nomic sanctions and plurality allegiance to
the ANC, an aggressive proponent of disin
vestment policy.
In summary,
1) The superfederation of non-racial
(predominantly black) labor unions
(COSATU) supports disinvestment or the
threat of disinvestment even though this
may require significant personal sacrifice
by some of its members.
2) The premier black political organiza
tion (ANC), which enjoys strong plurality
support by black South Africans, has sup
ported disinvestment for at least 20 years,
and most of the other top black organiza
tions and leaders now take a similar posi
tion.
3) Although black public opinion surveys
are far from conclusive, they do suggest that
a majority of urban blacks with an opinion
now support (i) sanctions, (ii) either un
conditional or conditional disinvestment,
and (iii) the view that disinvestment will ac
tually help in pressuring the government to
end apartheid.
