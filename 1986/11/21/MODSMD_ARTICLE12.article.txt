# CIR report: 'What do black South Africans want us to do?'
## 
### 
As moral overseers of Stanford Univer
sity's investment policy, we believe that a
critical element in any decision on the
question of disinvestment must be the pref
erence of those in whose interests an end to
apartheid is being sought Accordingly, the
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) has endeavored to examine the major
pieces available on black South African atti
tudes toward economic sanctions and disin
vestment for some indication of public
sentiment.
These pieces consist of policy statements
of the major political groups, labor unions
and federations; interviews, statements and
speeches of prominent South African politi
cal social leaders; public opinion surveys
conducted between June 1984 and July
1986; and pertinent summary documents
prepared by the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC). Consistent with these
source documents, our findings are broken
down into the following categories: trade
unions; political groups and political
leaders; and public opinion polls and sur
veys. -
South African security laws prohibiting
political subversion are thought by many to
outlaw expression or advocacy of disinvest
ment policy, in fact, Allan Boesak was
"detained" under these laws just last year
on charges which included inciting disin
vestment activity and economic boycotts. As
a result, certain findings cited here may un
derestimate the extent to which disinvest
ment is actually favored by the black
popluation.
Trade Unions
A recent indication of workers' views on
disinvestment comes from the newly
formed (predominantly black) non-racial
trade union "superfederation" called
COSATU (Congress of South African Un
ions). COSATU, which was officially
launched Nov. 30, 1985, is a composite of
FOSATU (a predecessor multi-racial
umbrella federation), the National Union of
Mine Workers (the largest trade union in
South Africa), the Commercial, Catering
and Allied Workers of South Africa, the
Food and Canning Workers Union, Cape
Town Municipal Workers Association, the
General Workers Union, the United Mining,
Metal and Allied Workers Unions of South
Africa, the Retail and Allied Workers Union
and unions affiliated with the United Demo
cratic Front and National Federation of
Workers. This merger makes COSATU the
largest federation of unionized workers in

South Africa, embracing 33 unions and
450,000 individual members.
At its first official conference in 1984,
COSATU approved what is regarded as the
first explicit call by a major South African
union or federation of unions for disinvest
ment. The applicable resolution (which)
passed reads: "This Congress: 1 Believes
that all forms of international pressure on
the South African government — including
disinvestment or the threat of disinvestment
— is an essential and effective form of pres
sure on the South African regime, and we
support it."
This pronouncement represents a
marked departure from the vague and cau
tious statements on disinvestment issued
previously by leading South African unions.
For example, a policy statement issued in
July, 1984 by the now-dissolved FOSATU, al
though supportive of pressures generated
by the disinvestment movement, stopped
short of calling for foreign companies to
withdraw. Similarly, CUSA (Council of Un
ions of South Africa), a significant black un
ion federation which decided not to join
FOSATI! (due to differences about union
policy with respect to race), stated in 1984
that it to welcomes pressures exerted by
disinvestment activity without specifically
urging disinvestment. It did, however,
adopt a resolution late in 1984 calling for
no new investment in South Africa by
foreign countries and companies.
The reluctance of South African unions in
the past to urge a policy of disinvestment
has been attributed not only to South
African security laws, but also to the adverse
personal consequences disinvestment
policy represents to workers. The signifi
cance of the COSATU position, therefore, is
that workers now appear to be saying that
they are willing to accept significant per
sonal sacrifices in order to end apartheid.
Political Groups and Leaders:
African National Congress (ANC) —
Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo
The oldest and most outspoken of South
Africa's liberation groups, the ANC is
believed to have the plurality of black South
African support. Leadership of this non
racial (predominantly black) organization,
now headed by President Oliver Tambo,
has included such notable national figures
as 1960 Nobel Prize winner Chief Albert
Luthuli and jailed activist Nelson Mandela.
The ANC was banned by the government in
1960 after abandoning its long-term policy
of non-violent opposition in favor of a cam

paign of armed resistance.
Clirrent membership figures for the ANC
are unavailable, due in part to its banned
status, but polls and survey* consistently
suggest that this organisation (and "Man
dela ) have the largest African support of any
opposition group, making it a decisive force
in South African politics \\ ith which the gov
eminent must deal if meaningful negotia
tions are to take place. Referring to
pollsters from across the political spec-,
trum. a recent article in The New Republic
(2) indicates that ' no other organization
and no other individual receives even half
as much support" from blacks. In the words
of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, "The ANC is
the premier black political organization.
The fact that many of its members have paid
a very heavy price has enhanced its prestige
and credibility."
According to a recent New York Times ar
tide (4), the ANC and allied groups — the
UDF and COSATU (both described below)
— "have largely pushed aside rival black
groups, such as Inkatha, the Zulu based po
litical machine of Chief Gatsha Buthelesi."
The group has long-term ties with the
South African Communist Party and accord
ing to the same New York l imes account,
currently receives roughly half of its overall
support in the form of military aid from
Soviet-bloc countries. Nevertheless, most of
the old guard within the ANC, including
Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo,. are not
communist, and most experts agree that
"the practical importance of this Commu
nist influence is almost impossible to
gauge."
Furthermore, there is general agreement
that nearly all ANC leaders and members
are, first and foremost, black nationalists
whose primary political goal is the elimina
tion of apartheid and the establishment of
a just non-racial political system in South
Africa. The ANC receives substantial finan
cial support from both nations and charities
in the West, and even some Reagan admin
istration officials now are calling for the
freeing of Nelson Mandela and the es
tablishment of direct negotiations between
the ANC and the South African government.

For at least the last 20 years, the ANi hxs
advocated disinvestment by foreigfi V,ln,
panies It also supports trade sanctions artd
divestment of stuck in companies doing
business in South Africa.
United Democratic Front (l'I)F) —
Allan Boesak and Partlck I.ekota
The I'DF is one of the largest and most
diverse of the country's legal opposition
groups, representing over one million
people in over 600 community, religious
and student organizations. Its meml>erslup
is thought to overlap significantly with tlrat
of its underground ally, the ANC Tin's n< uv
racial (predominantly black) organization
and its leaders openly urge foreign pres
sure on the South African government v>
end apartheid In a statement issued Aug..s,
19HS, UDF called on foreign business 10
make no new investment in South \friia
and to end "all forms of Financial ma
terial assistance to the South Afric.m gijv
ernment, the homelands and South' African
businesses.
In an Interview with the Investor
Responsibility Research Center (IRRO ayv
ducted a year before this statement wits
drafted, Boesak urged foreign companies Jo
adopt policies of conditional withdrawal h\
specifying tij Pretoria that they ya>u)d
withdraw tlieir operations from, South
Africa by a certain date if Pretoria did i\ot
meet specific demands for political n form.
Since that time, Boesak is believed ty h.iye
advocated a policy of disfnvestment'during
local meetings. It is this belief, together
with other alleged reform activity, that
resulted in Boesak's short-term "detehtioh"
last year.
Azanian People's Organization
(AZAPO)
This black consciousness group was or
ganized in the 1960s under the leaderslijp
of Steve Biko, who died in 1977 while in
detention (many believe at the hands of the
South African police). To the IRRC's know!
edge, AZAPO has not issued any statement
on investment policy to date. However, it is
assumed that this group favors disjnvej-t
