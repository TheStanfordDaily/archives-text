## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper We'll answer to Cal 
### 
Will Stanford Paye the Price for an overconfident atti
tude toward California and Big Game?
Can it Muster enough desire to beat the 1-9 Bears in
Berkeley?
Will Cal Kapp off a "good Joe's" career with a win?
Where there's a will there's an Elway, but is there a
will for a Gator Bowl-bound Cardinal?
Do the Bears still growl about last winter's
acrimonious recruiting battle over a Kohlmoos of a
lineman?
Will Cal's defense be Hardy like USC's Trojans or
escape to Walden Pond as Washington State did?
Stanford put the Texas quarterback through a pressure
Cooker. Can Cal's quarterback stand the heat or will he
have to leave the kitchen?
Are the Bears Green with envy for UCLA's running
game, or have they just been Marc-ing their time before
they too explode on the ground?
Washington Fenneyed off Stanford, but doesn't one
still have to Leiker the Cardinal's never-say-die defense?
Elway ran away from a USC win. Will he make Paye
shoulder the burden again or let Muster continue to

break a record that people had thought would Nevers be
matched?
Stanford players seem to have Tokyo on their minds.
Don't they remember that Big Game is "the real thing"?
Has the Cardinal filled itself with Gator-ade and forgot
ten that Big Game is Cal's bowl game?
The James gang has been stealing touchdowns from
opponents' defenses throughout the year. Can they once
again get away Scott-free?
Will Stanford's David-led defense continue to slay
Goliaths as it has all season long?
Will Cal's join the several other opponents' receivers
buried in Grant's tomb?
The Bear will not quit, but has it just died?
Will Oski, who's about as hard to find as a Cal win,
show up?
The Band was banished but bounced back. Will it
show more offense than the Bears?
For the answers to these questions and more tune in at
1:30 tomorrow afternoon for the 89th Big Game. Still the
Biggest Game in town.
