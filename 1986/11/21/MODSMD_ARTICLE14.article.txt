# Britain is pawn in Cold War
## 
### 
A few weeks ago I wrote a column for The Daily (Nov. 4)
- celebrating the possibility of British unilateral nuclear dis
, armament. Since then, a number of people, doubting my
; sanity, have asked me how a post-nuclear Britain would
deter Soviet expansionism and maintain its independence
in a dangerous world. Am I not, they have asked me, guilty
' of advocating appeasement and naive trust in Soviet good
. will? These are important questions, and they deserve a
serious response.
The standard argument in defense of nuclear weapons in
Europe is that they alone deter a Soviet invasion of Western
Europe since the Soviets have overwhelming superiority in
conventional forces; take away the nuclear weapons and the
Red Army will come pouring across the Iron Curtain. In fact,
however, it is far from clear that the Soviets have conven
tional superiority in Europe.

NATO apologists always talk about the tanks: The Warsaw
Pact has 18,000, while NATO has only 6,500. What goes un
mentioned is that, first, many of the Warsaw Pact tanks are
very old and unreliable and, second, you do not fight tanks
with tanks. You fight tanks with anti-tank missiles. With
240,000 of these, NATO looks quite secure against a Soviet
tank invasion. i , ,
NATO apologists also like to talk about the overwhelming
size of the Warsaw Pact's army as against ours. Their figures,
however, are often slanted: They include Warsaw Pact
reserve forces but not NATO reserves, and they usually in
clude the entire Soviet army, including those units not as
signed to Europe, while counting only American forces in
Europe. Once the figures are adjusted to compare like with
like, the Warsaw Pact army is not much larger than NATO's,
and they certainly do not have the two-to-one advantage
which, according to conventional military wisdom, the at
tacker needs over the defender.
In other words, the removal of Britain's or NATO's nu
clear weapons would hardly make the invasion of Western
Europe an attractive proposition.
But even if the Soviets did have conventional superiority,
are we really supposed to believe that they would be able to
subjugate the densely populated, advanced industrial
societies of Western Europe? Despite all their tanks,
helicopters and soldiers, the Soviets are having trouble
enough subduing a few handfuls of primitively armed
tribesmen in Afghanistan. Superiority in military hardware
is useless in the face of the determined resistance of a
mobilized people. It would be quite possible for the 55 mil
lion people of Britain to make this kind of resistance, rather
than the threat to annihilate the enemy's civilians through
the use of nuclear weapons, the centerpiece of their defense
policy. This is exactly what Switzerland has done, and no
one is claiming that Swiss independence and national secur
ity have suffered as a consequence.
Thus the argument for British unilateral nuclear disarma
ment is not just a moral argument. It is also strategic. It is not
just that nuclear weapons are immoral; they are also

manifestly unnecessary for the defense of Western Europe.
The proponents of British disarmament ask: Given the im
morality of nuclear weapons, given the deterrent superfluity
of nuclear weapons and given the magnitude of the burden
nuclear weapons impose upon the crumbling British eco
nomy, what is the justification for having such weapons?
The real answer to this question, I believe, is that nuclear
weapons are status symbols. As even the generals agree,
they serve no useful military purpose: They did not help
Britain in its recent great crises in Suez, Rhodesia and the
Falklands, and they cannot be used against the Soviets with
out bringing about the retaliatory incineration of Britain.
Nuclear weapons do, however, confer a sense of impor
tance upon their owners. For Britain, which has declined'
from imperial majesty to economic decay and political tur
moil in a few short decades, the compensatory prestige of
nuclearism is alluring: Our once-great industries may be in
ruins and our people among the poorest and worst
educated in Western Europe, but at least we can have the
Trident submarine.
Unfortunately, we purchase this illusion of greatness at
the price of its substance. First, the expense of the weapons
is doing far more harm to our economy than the Russians
ever have. Second, and more important, we have ironically
paid for these symbols of a lost national grandeur with our
contemporary freedom and independence. I am referring
here to the fact that the Cruise missiles in Britain are under
the sole control of the American military; they can be
launched at any time from British territory, thus coipmfttipg
Britain to war, without British consent. (And even Britain's
so-called "independent" nuclear deterrent is dependent on
American servicing and targeting personnel and American
satellite facilities.) In the name of defending British
sovereignty against the Soviets, Margaret Thatcher has non
chalantly surrendered it to the Americans, turning Britain
into an American aircraft carrier in the Atlantic. Margaret
Thatcher's nationalism has, paradoxically, emasculated Brit
ain, bringing it to the nadir of its national decline; it has ce
mented Britain's servile clientship to the United States and
its global interests.
My point here is not that it is the Americans rather than
the Soviets who truly threaten British independence â€”
though there is some truth in this argument. The real enemy
of British freedom and independence, the cause of our in
ability to find a dignified post-colonial role, is not the
stockpile of tanks in Eastern Europe nor the American
button-pressers at Greenham Common, but the fabric of the
Cold War itself which forces the once-great nations of
Europe to follow obsequiously one or other superpower.
We have become pawns in someone else's game. British nu
clear disarmament would help us to start breaking up this
game. It would not compromise British national security ris
a-iris the Soviets, but it would rupture the fabric of the Cold
War in which the British are trapped and create a space for
European leadership in world affairs. This would be a
patriotic and a moral gesture.
