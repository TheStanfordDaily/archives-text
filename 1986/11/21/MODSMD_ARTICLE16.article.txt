Task force chair
explains members
There seems to be a widespread
misapprehension, expressed in both
Daily editorials and articles, concern
ing the nature of the membership of
the Task Force on the Area One Re
quirement (Western Culture): namely,
that two members of the task force are
not full members but have been
seconded to the committee to sit ex
officio.
Provost James Rosses charge to the
task force, dated Sept. 29, shows the
present roster of the task force, except
for the student members who had not
yet been nominated, and none of the
members named are listed as ex
officio. Although two members, Dean
of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee and Assistant Provost Fer
nando de Necochea, have administra
tive titles, both are full members of
the task force and were appointed, as
I understand it, not as representatives
of administrative offices but for what it
was believed each would contribute
to the work of the task force.

Britain can't fall
for appeasement
Mr. Gusterson (Daily, Nov. 4) must
either be a Communist or not have
read his modern European history. Or
maybe he is one of those people who
simply refuse to believe the things
that happened prior to and during
World War 11.
Theodore Roosevelt said, "Walk
softly but carry a big stick." Now
bullies are afraid of big sticks, but if
they can cajole and make token
overtures to back up their promises,
thus convincing their adversaries that
they are sincere, they have won the
first round in the conquest. Didn't the
Nazis do just that in the '30s, and didn't
Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamber
lain, not to mention the Duke of
Windsor, who still had a popular
following, fall for their aa?
There was only one man who kept
saying again and again that the Nazis
were liars and that Great Britain and
their allies would have to pay. And it
wasn't until he and some of his sup-

porters gathered irrefutable evidence
that the Nazis were on their way to
dominate Europe — and then the
world — and presented it to the
government that those in power
thought there might be some truth in
what Winston Churchill was saying.
But Poland fell, Czechoslovakia was
annexed and the panzer divisions
crossed the border into Austria before
anyone pulled in the reins. Sentiments
such as Mr. Gusterson's has Winston
turning flip-flops in that churchyard at
Bladen, with his jaw set firm and with
a tear or two trickling down his cheek,
muttering, "Will they never learn? I
told them we should have marched
on through Germany or we would
have to pay yet again."
As James Scaminaci 111 says (Daily,
Nov. 12), the only real moral is that
we have peace only through strength.
I do not believe Britain is so blind this
time as to fall for appeasement again.
They paid too heavy a price in 1939.

Engineers should

*) GGHO ICIH
1 disagree with the assertion of
Allen C. Estes that the responsible .role
of engineers in the society has led to
perpetuation of certain stereotypes
about them (Daily, Nov. 17). En
gineers do constitute a privileged (not
"oppressed and downtrodden")
group in society which has by and
large been insensitive to the weak and
those discriminated against. For
many valid reasons, engineers are
seen as individuals lacking human
values and the vision of an ideal soci
ety, so laboriously cherished by the
rest of humankind. They are consid
ered robots who simply follow the
commands from the warlords and the
greedy profit-makers of this world.
Undoubtedly, this picture is an
oversimplification; nonetheless, it is
the main source of the engineer's
image described in great detail by
Estes. I believe that engineers should
fight against these stereotypes — but
not by having sex in a hot air balloon,
as Estes suggests. There exists a
wealth of opportunities for engineers,
more than many others, to educate
themselves about the political and
social issues of the time and act to
build a better world. Or at least to be
sensitive to the progressive trends in
their own community.

Estes also ignores the fact that
women are a substantial and fast
growing component of the engineer
community and talks proudly about
the clandestine desire of an engineer
to appear as the Playgirl centerfold
and chase beautiful women across
Europe like James Bond. By showing
insensitivity toward the women
pursuing a career in engineering,
Estes has further reinforced the
stereotype of the engineer without
values.

Column assumes
bad stereotypes
While attempting to dispel the
unjust stereotypes of the engineering
student, Allen C. Estes (Nov. 17)
makes certain unfortunate assump
tions that only perpetuate other —
sexist and homophobic —
stereotypes. With one exception, the
article shows that the engineer whose
social life has been stunted by soci
ety's preconceptions must be both
male and straight. This engineer's
secret desires to drive fast, show off
his body and chase beautiful women,
across continents are hardly admira
ble. Even if written in jest, such state
ments do not portray an engineer (or
an author) whose values would
diminish prejudice against women —
especially in the sciences — and gays.
In trying to entice timid engineers out
of their offices and classrooms, less
restrained people should "try to
choose one [an engineer] of the oppo
site sex." Here Estes hints that per
haps the engineer to be rescued from
a pit of conservative boredom is
female. However, the offensive
scenario that follows clearly calls on
straight female readers to enlighten
straight male engineers.
It's too bad Estes didn't write a
column that cleverly included a few
more imaginative possibilities. But
perhaps it's my imagination that needs
stretching: Suppose I've misread him
and his hypothetical engineer is a
woman. (Estes carefully avoids using
pronouns to denote gender and side
steps the linguistic stumbling block of
the generic "he.") In that case, my
sincere apologies to the author, and

Britain can't fall
for appeasement
Mr. Gusterson (Daily, Nov. 4) must
either be a Communist or not have
read his modern European history. Or
maybe he is one of those people who
simply refuse to believe the things
that happened prior to and during
World War 11.
Theodore Roosevelt said, "Walk
softly but carry a big stick." Now
bullies are afraid of big sticks, but if
they can cajole and make token
overtures to back up their promises,
thus convincing their adversaries that
they are sincere, they have won the
first round in the conquest. Didn't the
Nazis do just that in the '30s, and didn't
Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamber
lain, not to mention the Duke of
Windsor, who still had a popular
following, fall for their aa?
There was only one man who kept
saying again and again that the Nazis
were liars and that Great Britain and
their allies would have to pay. And it
wasn't until he and some of his sup-

porters gathered irrefutable evidence
that the Nazis were on their way to
dominate Europe — and then the
world — and presented it to the
government that those in power
thought there might be some truth in
what Winston Churchill was saying.
But Poland fell, Czechoslovakia was
annexed and the panzer divisions
crossed the border into Austria before
anyone pulled in the reins. Sentiments
such as Mr. Gusterson's has Winston
turning flip-flops in that churchyard at
Bladen, with his jaw set firm and with
a tear or two trickling down his cheek,
muttering, "Will they never learn? I
told them we should have marched
on through Germany or we would
have to pay yet again."
As James Scaminaci 111 says (Daily,
Nov. 12), the only real moral is that
we have peace only through strength.
I do not believe Britain is so blind this
time as to fall for appeasement again.
They paid too heavy a price in 1939.

Engineers should
fight stereotypes
*) GGHO ICIH
1 disagree with the assertion of
Allen C. Estes that the responsible .role
of engineers in the society has led to
perpetuation of certain stereotypes
about them (Daily, Nov. 17). En
gineers do constitute a privileged (not
"oppressed and downtrodden")
group in society which has by and
large been insensitive to the weak and
those discriminated against. For
many valid reasons, engineers are
seen as individuals lacking human
values and the vision of an ideal soci
ety, so laboriously cherished by the
rest of humankind. They are consid
ered robots who simply follow the
commands from the warlords and the
greedy profit-makers of this world.
Undoubtedly, this picture is an
oversimplification; nonetheless, it is
the main source of the engineer's
image described in great detail by
Estes. I believe that engineers should
fight against these stereotypes — but
not by having sex in a hot air balloon,
as Estes suggests. There exists a
wealth of opportunities for engineers,
more than many others, to educate
themselves about the political and
social issues of the time and act to
build a better world. Or at least to be
sensitive to the progressive trends in
their own community.

Estes also ignores the fact that
women are a substantial and fast
growing component of the engineer
community and talks proudly about
the clandestine desire of an engineer
to appear as the Playgirl centerfold
and chase beautiful women across
Europe like James Bond. By showing
insensitivity toward the women
pursuing a career in engineering,
Estes has further reinforced the
stereotype of the engineer without
values.

Graduate student,

Column assumes
bad stereotypes
While attempting to dispel the
unjust stereotypes of the engineering
student, Allen C. Estes (Nov. 17)
makes certain unfortunate assump
tions that only perpetuate other —
sexist and homophobic —
stereotypes. With one exception, the
article shows that the engineer whose
social life has been stunted by soci
ety's preconceptions must be both
male and straight. This engineer's
secret desires to drive fast, show off
his body and chase beautiful women,
across continents are hardly admira
ble. Even if written in jest, such state
ments do not portray an engineer (or
an author) whose values would
diminish prejudice against women —
especially in the sciences — and gays.
In trying to entice timid engineers out
of their offices and classrooms, less
restrained people should "try to
choose one [an engineer] of the oppo
site sex." Here Estes hints that per
haps the engineer to be rescued from
a pit of conservative boredom is
female. However, the offensive
scenario that follows clearly calls on
straight female readers to enlighten
straight male engineers.
It's too bad Estes didn't write a
column that cleverly included a few
more imaginative possibilities. But
perhaps it's my imagination that needs
stretching: Suppose I've misread him
and his hypothetical engineer is a
woman. (Estes carefully avoids using
pronouns to denote gender and side
steps the linguistic stumbling block of
the generic "he.") In that case, my
sincere apologies to the author, and
keep up the good work!
