# Fight against Reagan Library continues
## 
### 
Site of library
not only problem
We are writing to you to express
our diappointment with your editorial
of Nov. 14 entitled, "Alter library
focus." You state that our effort is
misdirected and that it is too late to
alter the site of the Ronald Reagan
Library and Museum. We strongly
disagree with your viewpoint.
First of all, the environmental
review of the project has yet to be
done. No public permits from the
county have been issued for the build
ing of the library/museum complex.
No earth has been turned. No hillside
has been carved out.
We are not taking issue with the
decision of whether or not the Llniver
sity should have a Ronald Reagan
library and museum with a memorial
Sequoia. It is only very recently that
pictures and details of the library's
design have been published In a very
short time, we have gathered more
than 1,000 signatures from people of
the community who believe that the
issue of the siting of the library and
museum needs more consideration. A
large majority of those signing the
petition were not aware of the scope
of the project or the location. The
issues of form (including siting) and
function should be considered to
gether
Additionally', the location of this

development should be considered in
the context of other planned develop
ment. Phil Williams was quoted in a
Daily article (Nov. 11) as saying this
road "is not just a driveway. We might
need it later for other academic
purposes." Is there more already in
the works that needs to be discussed
that the public should know about?
If nothing else, the gathering of
signatures has made the public aware
of the site and the questions that even
you think are important "regarding
the auditorium and the architectural
design." One would think that the staff
of a newspaper would be in favor of
the expression of divergent views
which seek thorough discussion of
important issues. The project, includ
ing its site, must still undergo ap
proval of a governmental body that is
outside of Stanford, called Santa Clara
County, which must be responsive to
members of the general public as well
as Stanford. Vi e and those who signed
the petition will certainly also make
our views known to the county
agencies that must approve this proj
ect.
Furthermore, the petition reveals
that we are concerned with more than
just the siting of the library We are
also concerned with the currently
hazardous conditions of the Junipero
Serra Boulevard. The Reagan Library
and Museum, as proposed, will fur
ther aggravate this condition.
Perhaps you no longer have any
hopes, but we draw our inspiration

from the excellent Daily articles and
University President Donald Kennedy.
We and those who have signed the
petition believe in Stanford and its
high standards. We and more than a
thousand others think our concerns
are pertinent and important... And we
will continue to gather signatures.

University lacks
site consideration
There are many questions one
might ask following the recent story
about the petition against the Reagan
Library site (Daily, Nov. 11). For exam
ple, (Vice President for Public Affairs)
Bob Freelen speaks of Stanford using
its land for academic purposes. How
many academic departments at Stan
ford have asked for this "academic"
facility to come to Stanford? How
many faculty billets or academic re
sources have departments proposed
to devote to it? The answer is none.
(Director of Planning) Phil Williams
speaks of the access route. The Plan
ning Office has been working for
nearly a year on a long-term plan for
the \Miuit luvHiims •• •■•••»«»
interaction has there been between
this long-range planning and the
Reagan Library siting? The answer is,
again, none.

(Special Assistant to the President)
Boh Hamrdla says it's a little late for
reconsideration. Given the care Stan
ford devotes to architectural planning,
and the uniquely precious character
of this site, one might ask how many
alternative designs for the library has
Stanford considered? The answer yet
again is, none. Stanford was presented
with a finished plan from outside,
completed more than a year ago and
held private for a considerable time.
It's had no opportunity itself, and
given none to others, to consider
alternative plans.
But the last paragraph is the grab
ber. The Reagan Library has as of yet
no Santa Clara County use permit, no
Palo Alto or County design approval,
no Environmental Impact Report, no
fully approved access route, no
designs for its roads, fences or secur
ity measures, no negotiated lease with
the University, no accepted under
standing on future governance by-
Stanford, no completed public
hearings or Faculty Senate discussions
on any of these items and darned
little, if any, community support. Yet
the project is expected to break
ground in April! I guess the final
question has to be, is this plan really
going to be rammed through with the
same inadequate consideration it's
had up to now, so it can break ground
in just five months?

the context of other planned develop
ment. Phil Williams was quoted in a
Daily article (Nov. 11) as saying this
road "is not just a driveway. We might
need it later for other academic
purposes." Is there more already in
the works that needs to be discussed
that the public should know about?
If nothing else, the gathering of
signatures has made the public aware
of the site and the questions that even
you think are important "regarding
the auditorium and the architectural
design." One would think that the staff
of a newspaper would be in favor of
the expression of divergent views
which seek thorough discussion of
important issues. The project, includ
ing its site, must still undergo ap
proval of a governmental body that is
outside of Stanford, called Santa Clara
County, which must be responsive to
members of the general public as well
as Stanford. Vi e and those who signed
the petition will certainly also make
our views known to the county
agencies that must approve this proj
ect.
Furthermore, the petition reveals
that we are concerned with more than
just the siting of the library We are
also concerned with the currently
hazardous conditions of the Junipero
Serra Boulevard. The Reagan Library
and Museum, as proposed, will fur
ther aggravate this condition.
Perhaps you no longer have any
hopes, but we draw our inspiration

from the excellent Daily articles and
University President Donald Kennedy.
We and those who have signed the
petition believe in Stanford and its
high standards. We and more than a
thousand others think our concerns
are pertinent and important... And we
will continue to gather signatures.

University lacks
site consideration
There are many questions one
might ask following the recent story
about the petition against the Reagan
Library site (Daily, Nov. 11). For exam
ple, (Vice President for Public Affairs)
Bob Freelen speaks of Stanford using
its land for academic purposes. How
many academic departments at Stan
ford have asked for this "academic"
facility to come to Stanford? How
many faculty billets or academic re
sources have departments proposed
to devote to it? The answer is none.
(Director of Planning) Phil Williams
speaks of the access route. The Plan
ning Office has been working for
nearly a year on a long-term plan for
the \Miuit luvHiims •• •■•••»«»
interaction has there been between
this long-range planning and the
Reagan Library siting? The answer is,
again, none.

(Special Assistant to the President)
Boh Hamrdla says it's a little late for
reconsideration. Given the care Stan
ford devotes to architectural planning,
and the uniquely precious character
of this site, one might ask how many
alternative designs for the library has
Stanford considered? The answer yet
again is, none. Stanford was presented
with a finished plan from outside,
completed more than a year ago and
held private for a considerable time.
It's had no opportunity itself, and
given none to others, to consider
alternative plans.
But the last paragraph is the grab
ber. The Reagan Library has as of yet
no Santa Clara County use permit, no
Palo Alto or County design approval,
no Environmental Impact Report, no
fully approved access route, no
designs for its roads, fences or secur
ity measures, no negotiated lease with
the University, no accepted under
standing on future governance by-
Stanford, no completed public
hearings or Faculty Senate discussions
on any of these items and darned
little, if any, community support. Yet
the project is expected to break
ground in April! I guess the final
question has to be, is this plan really
going to be rammed through with the
same inadequate consideration it's
had up to now, so it can break ground
in just five months?

Site of library
not only problem
We are writing to you to express
our diappointment with your editorial
of Nov. 14 entitled, "Alter library
focus." You state that our effort is
misdirected and that it is too late to
alter the site of the Ronald Reagan
Library and Museum. We strongly
disagree with your viewpoint.
First of all, the environmental
review of the project has yet to be
done. No public permits from the
county have been issued for the build
ing of the library/museum complex.
No earth has been turned. No hillside
has been carved out.
We are not taking issue with the
decision of whether or not the Llniver
sity should have a Ronald Reagan
library and museum with a memorial
Sequoia. It is only very recently that
pictures and details of the library's
design have been published In a very
short time, we have gathered more
than 1,000 signatures from people of
the community who believe that the
issue of the siting of the library and
museum needs more consideration. A
large majority of those signing the
petition were not aware of the scope
of the project or the location. The
issues of form (including siting) and
function should be considered to
gether
Additionally', the location of this

development should be considered in
the context of other planned develop
ment. Phil Williams was quoted in a
