# Daniloff talks on arms

If an arms control agreement between the Soviet Union
and the I'nited States is not reached next year, negotiations
will be stalled until well after the next U.S. president takes
office in 1989, journalist Nicholas Daniloff told a capacity
crowd at Memorial Church yesterday afternoon.
Daniloff said: "1987 could be a historic year if the United
States shows flexibility. If an agreement is not reached, it
will be put off for several years because we will have a new
president."
Daniloff, the former Moscow correspondent for U.S.
News H World Report, was held by the Soviet Union earlier
this fall on charges of espionage.
Daniloff said President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev have only until "late March 1988 to make a
breakthrough in this area."
If there is no arms agreement by the November 1988
presidential elections, the president-elect will need at least a
year in office to assess his arms control position before he
will be prepared to hold talks with the Soviet Union,
Daniloff said.
He stressed the need for mutual understanding in order
to reach any arms agreements.
"The Soviet Union is our main adversary nation. We all
have to live on the same planet and survive, and it seems we
need to understand each other a little better."
Although the United States considers the Soviet Union a
difficult country to work with, the Soviet Union feels the
same way about the U.S. government, Daniloff said. "The So

viet Union feels that Americans don't keep their word.
According to Daniloff, his arrest on Aug. 30 was instigated
"to get the attention of President Reagan."
In the months previous to the "Daniloff affair," Gorba
chev made attempts to establish a dialogue with Reagan, but
the president ignored him, Daniloff said.
After Gennadi Zakharov, a Soviet employee at the United
Nations, was arrested in New York, the Soviet party secre
taries gave the order to the KGB to arrest an American with
out diplomatic immunity and trade him for Zakharov,
Daniloff said, adding that his arrest did precipitate a crisis
that obtained the president's attention.
Daniloff said, however, that he did not think he was
"swapped for Zakharov.... There was a certain symmetry
once we were both in our (respective) embassies, but a
diplomatic solution to an uncomfortable crisis was reached
at the same time."
Daniloff said two good results of his imprisonment were
that he was able to come home and that October's summit
meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev resulted.
"Although (the summit) was not productive, new ground
was plowed, and we still have enough time to make prog
ress for mutual relations," he said.
Daniloff described his stay in prison as a "nightmarish ex
perience" and said that he had felt "terribly uncomfortable
and vulnerable."
Although he was arrested on charges of espionage,
Daniloff believes that the Soviets never thought he actually
was a spy.

Journalist Nicholas Daniloff, the object of a U.S.-Soviet tug-of-war earlier this year, waits before delivering a speech
on the prospects for arms control to a capacity crowd at Memorial Church yesterday.
"They have known me since 1961;
they opened a file on me then. And my
apartment (in Moscow) was bugged,
and the telephones were tapped," he
said
But they could not have really
thought I was spy. They didn't even

have a warrant when I was arrested. It
was clearly a frame-up."
Regarding current issues, Daniloff
voiced his opinion about the contro
versial trading of weapons with Iran
for hostages.
"I think the trade of arms for bodies
is morally repugnant. And it is a breach
of the trade embargo policy against
Iran. Also, it is a breach of the policy of
not dealing with terrorists," he said.
