## Sig Eps have a ball with charity relay 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Staff Writer 
Tlje game ball for this year's Big
Game will change hands several times,
and not just at the game.
In( fact, the ball will be carried by
more than 40 people before Brad
Muster gets a chance to run all over
California's Memorial Stadium with it.
Neither quarterback John Paye nor
center Andy Sinclair will be the first
Stanfordite to handle the ball.
Instead, the first Stanford person
carrying the precious Big Game
pigskin will be University President
Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy will go around end for a
long gainer and then hand off to Augie
Sabela, president of Stanford's Sigma
Phi Epsilon fraternity.
Sabela gets this honor because of
what the Sig Eps are planning on doing
with the football once they get it from
Kennedy.
They're going to take the ball and
run with it.
Not that unique an idea, except that
they won't be running on astroturf or
grass, and the only points they hope to
score are for the Ronald McDonald
House — in the third annual Sig Ep
Pigskin Relay.
Kennedy will receive the game ball
todUy from Sabela. Tomorrow morn
ing he will carry the ball from the Lou
Henry Hoover House to the Oval,
where he will be met by the Sig Eps.
Eryr& there, the ball will be carried
by pairs of Sig Eps running one mile
each on a course that crosses the Dum
barton Bridge and eventually reaches
Berkeley.

Stanford's Sig Eps are responsible
for the first half of the 44-mile trek.
"Since we have two guys running
each mile of the 22 miles, plus drivers
to shuttle runners back and forth, al
most everybody in the chapter is
actively involved in this project," ex
plained Clint Wilson, project manager
for the run.

7 think it's great
that he (Kennedy)
is running the first
leg for us... in this
age of harrassing
fraternities, the
more support we
can get, the better.'

At the halfway point, the last pair of
Stanford Sig Eps will hand the ball off
to the Berkeley Sig Eps, who will com
plete the journey to Memorial Stadium.
There the ball will be presented to the
teams at game time. In addition, the
Stanford and Berkeley Sig Ep presi
dents will present a check to the
Ronald McDonald House just before
kickoff.
The check they present will be for
around $6,000, up from last years'

$5,000 contribution, according to Wil
son.
The funds are per-mile contribution
pledges that have been made to the Sig
Ep chapters.
Wilson says that the involvement of
the Sig Ep chapters is just one of the
reasons this is such a successful charity
project.
"Another interesting aspect is how
we work together right in the middle
of Big Game week. We're working to
gether, but the rivalry is definitely still
there," Wilson says.
"Last year the rivalry was most ap
parent when they handed us the ball,"
he explained. "There were TV cameras
there and we were all shouting Beat
Cal' and they were yelling 'Beat Stan
ford.' Plus our red and white clothing
and signs really showed up against
their blue and yellow, but at game time
we still made the presentation together
— and we won the game."
Wilson also is encouraged by the im
provements in the relationships of the
Sig Eps with University administration
and the Ronald McDonald House.
"I think it's great that he (Kennedy )
is running the first leg for us. It shows
that he supports our cause, and, in this
age of harrassing fraternities, the more
support we can get, the better," said
Wilson.
"The (Ronald McDonald) House is a
really good cause, and they appreciate
all our efforts," he continued. "We've
built up a great rapport with them
through this. We've helped them paint,
clean up and fix things just because
they feel they can count on us now."
The Pigskin Relay will start at 6:30
a.m. tomorrow from Kennedy's home.

and the Ronald McDonald House.
"I think it's great that he (Kennedy )
is running the first leg for us. It shows
that he supports our cause, and, in this
age of harrassing fraternities, the more
support we can get, the better," said
Wilson.
"The (Ronald McDonald) House is a
really good cause, and they appreciate
all our efforts," he continued. "We've
built up a great rapport with them
through this. We've helped them paint,
clean up and fix things just because
they feel they can count on us now."
The Pigskin Relay will start at 6:30
a.m. tomorrow from Kennedy's home.
