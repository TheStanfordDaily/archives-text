Bloodlust
The rivalry between Stanford and
UC-Berkeley may be an intense one,
but out in the Midwest, traditional in
trastate rivals Indiana University and
Purdue are out for blood.
Literally.
For the second consecutive year the
campuses of Purdue and Indiana are

waging a blood drive competition
during the week before their football
teams face off on the gridiron.
After the two school's drives are
over, the school donating the most
pints of blood will be presented with
the "Bucket of Life" before the kickoff
in tomorrow's lU-Purdue game.
The "Bucket of Life" parallels the
Old Oaken Bucket, which is the tradi
tional spoils of the lU-Purdue contest
(analagous to the Axe).
Meanwhile, in Michigan
Oh, those Midwesterners. At the Uni
versity of Michigan in Ann Arbor, on
football game days Gianelli's Pizza of
fers a 1 percent discount for every
point the Wolverines score. Two weeks
ago the team rolled up 69 points
against the University of Illinois.
"We had to close early (that day) be
cause we ran out of ingredients," said
Herschel Rohr, owner and manager of
Gianelli's. "No one really envisioned a
69-point game."
Rohr is still tabulating how many

pizzas were served that day, but he es
timated that the store received 500-600
calls.
Bop 'til you drop dead
When they're not ordering pizzas,
the Michigan folk party hearty. But a
few of them got excessive recently.
During one weekend early this month,
Ann Arbor police issued almost 80 tick
ets for disorderly conduct and
drunkenness. Although a focus of
police enforcement has been fraternity
parties, most of the deviants receiving
tickets were at private residences.
In addition, one student partier fell
30 feet from a balcony, incurring fatal
injuries. A woman at another party fell
out a window and suffered a broken
hip, and a third student had his face cut
with a knife while being escorted from
a party. ,
Apparently, this kind of thing is com
monplace in Ann Arbor: The students
death wasn't even the lead story in the
subsequent Monday's edition of The
Michigan Daily.
