## Are compact discs overtaking the LP? The 						record may be headed for extinction 
### LORI SILVER 
Dinosaurs, big cars, manual typewriters, slide rulers,
eight-track tapes — and the vinyl record.
Is the increasing popularity of compact discs dooming
the record to extinction? According to music store
owners, the demise of the record may be appoaching
sooner than we think.
Already record sales have seriously decreased
compared with the dramatic rise of the compact disc. At
Tower Records in Palo Alto, compact discs comprise 36
percent of total sales, according to manager Kevin Ser
reter.
This figure is typical for most local retailers, who
report that compact discs account for about 30 percent of
total sales. At Classical Wax in Menlo Park, however,
owner Duff Gainy said that compact discs comprise 60
percent of gross sales, compared to 25 percent for cas
settes and 15 percent for records.
"We're being forced to phase out LPs," said Gainy.
"After a matter of time, major record companies are
going to reduce or completely phase out LPs. It's not
economically feasible for plants that make records to
stay in business because major labels are getting out."
Classical records will be the first to go, he predicts,
"two or three years down the line."
The manager of one major record chain, who wished
to remain anonymous, said "In five or 10 years, we (the
chain) will not be carrying vinyl records anymore. We
will stock only compact discs and cassettes."
Not all retailers are pessimistic about the fate of the
record.
"Records are going to be around for a while," said Ser
reter. "The CD is making inroads, but until they can get the
price down on a comparable level (with records), there

are always going to be records."
The average cost for a compact disc ranges from $13.99
to 114.99.
A serious supply problem is also limiting the growth of
compact discs. Since there is only one place in the
country now pressing compact discs, retailers are having
problems getting a good supply and selection.
"They can't supply all the CDs we can sell," said Ser
reter. "We try to order everything in the catalogues, and
we can only get 60 percent of our order filled."
In one store, an order for 18,000 compact disc copies
of Bruce Springsteen's new release could be filled with
only 4,000 copies.
"New CD plants are being built which will produce
more and more CDs. People will begin to see what is
available and how much is available on CD."
With the holidays approaching, retailers are predicting
that compact disc players will be a popular item. As the
players go down in price, compact discs will begin to ap
peal to a much wider audience.
"The popular market has grown and grown," Serreter
said. "Machines are going down in price and CDs are be
coming more widespread."
Owners of compact disc players assert that compact
discs have a variety of advantages over records.
For Andy Berke, a freshman, a compact disc player pro
vides clear music for an affordable price.
"I heard that if you could buy the nicest turntable ever,
it would sound better than a compact disc player, but I
don't have that kind of money. For $200, it's the best
sound you can get," he said.
"I love CDs," said Gainy. "I like the sound quality, the
size, the fact that I don't have to turn it over, the 70
minutes of music and the packaging. It's a new and excit
ing product — a real panacea for the music industry."
