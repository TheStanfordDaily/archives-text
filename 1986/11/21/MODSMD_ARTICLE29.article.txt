# Money: It's crucial for successful campaigns
## 
### BOBBY LANDON 
Ballot results have been counted. Victory
celebrations and concession speeches have
been made. The 1986 elections are over, but
the issue of campaign finances lingers.
Fund raising is key to winning state and
federal elections. A candidate must raise money
before he or she can even formally enter a race.
And campaign debts often follow election day.
The local U.S. congressional race between
Democrat Lance Weil and Republican Ernie
Konnyu illustrates how funds are raised and
spent.
Konnyu defeated Weil with a comfortable 59
percent of the vote for the 12th Congressional
District seat, which includes Stanford and is
now held by Republican Ed Zschau. Konnyu
will be sworn in Jan. 6.
Financially, Konnyu had a definite advantage:
a budget of $275,000 compared to Weil's

$75,000. But the two candidates had similar
spending strategies.
For both, the greatest portion was allocated
to mass mailings. Each mailed thousands of let
ters to registered voters in the district. Letters
included a biography of the candidate, his posi
tions on the issues and his goals. Konnyu spent
$125,000, more than twice the amount of Weil's
$50,000.
While the anti-Rose Bird campaign and can
didates for state governor and U.S. Senate spent
millions on television and radio advertising,
neither Weil nor Konnyu spent much money
on audiovisual pitches.
The Weil campaign, struggling to stay its lim
ited budget, simply could not afford air time,
especially since the Bay Area is one of the most
expensive markets in the country.
Chuck Garland, treasurer of the Konnyu cam
paign, also noted the high cost of television and
radio as prohibitively expensive, but added:

"We really didn't need it. We were 17 points
ahead at the last poll and felt that we would be
spending our supporters' money irrespon
sibly."
With a budget less than one-third of Kon
nyu's $275,000, Weil was constrained in more
than just media advertising. But, said Judy
Kleinberg, Weil's assistant campaign manager
for media, "100 percent of our funds are from
grass-roots support— And it is all located
within the district."
Most of the funds were raised through small
donations of less than $200, she added. Several
campaign dinners were held, with proceeds
going to election coffers.
Alleviating some of the strain of a tight
budget was "a lot of donated professional
time," Kleinberg said. This allowed overhead
costs to stay low. Those costs accounted for
$20,000 of Weil's budget, while Konnyu spent
more than $100,000. Kleinberg herself is a Palo

Alto lawyer who volunteered full-time on the
campaign.
Konnyu's campaign also had "a majority of
donors who gave under $200," Garland said.
"We've had over 3,000 individual donors within
the community." Individual support accounted
for about $100,000 of Konnyu's budget.
PACs (Political Action Committees) donated
$85,000 to Konnyu. PACs have specific political
agendas and support candidates for public of
fice.
More than 150 PACs made donations to Kon
nyu, and some are "considerably outside the
district," notes Garland. The leading donors in
clude the National Auto Dealers, the National
Rifle Association, the Watkins and Johnson cor
poration and the Lincoln Club of Northern Cali
fornia. Each gave the legal limit of $5,000.
The disproportionate share of PAC money
received by the Republican candidate is not re
flective of national trends. According to the

Federal Board of Elections, Democrats running
for Congress in 1986 received $36.8 million in
PAC money as opposed to $22 million for
Republicans.
Among the leading national donors are the
Realtors ($1.4 million), the National Education
Association ($1 million), the National Associa
tion of Homebuilders ($950,000) and the Amer
ican Medical Association ($870,000).
Konnyu's work is not done now that the elec
tion is over. To meet expenses, the campaign
was forced to borrow $85,000. The loan was not
taken out by Konnyu himself, but, said Garland,
"the campaign has borrowed on Ernie's col
lateral."
What is the plan to pay off this debt? "It is not
going to be a major problem, " says Sandy
Field, the campaign manager. "We plan to pay it
off by January— We'll look to our staunch in
dividual supporters." And, once again, "PACs
will be a good source."
