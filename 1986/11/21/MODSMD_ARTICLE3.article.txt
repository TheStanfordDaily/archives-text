# Council reviews Western Culture
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Editorial staff 
Faculty members on the Academic Council, meeting yes
terday to discuss the current Western Culture Program and
possible changes, expressed sentiment ranging from strong
convictions to preserve the current Eurocentric focus of the
program to desires to revise it significantly and incorporate
other cultures.
The purpose of vesterday's meeting was to discuss the
current Western ( ulture Program rather than to arrive at
any final decision concerning modifications.
The Academic Council, which includes the 1,350 mem
bers of the Stanford professoriate, does not possess the
power to effect legislation but does debate issues and send
its recommendations to the Faculty Senate.
According to University President Donald Kennedy, "The
central purpose of this discussion is to help inform
deliberations of the task force that is currently reviewing
the Western Culture Program. The task force, appointed by
Provost lames Rosse in October and chaired by History Prof.
P;tul Seaver, will continue to discuss the varying views and
other alternatives throughout (his academic year, at the end
of which they are expected to issue some recommendation
to the Academic Council.
The Western Culture Program, ;i distribution requirement
for all undergraduates, has been the subject of a variety of
criticism from Stanford faculty, as well as students, through
most of its six-year history.
The criticim has generally centered around the claim that
minorities and women are largely ignored in the current
structure of the program. A wide range of opinions,
however, were expressed at the meeting.
English Prof. William Chace pointed to the recent statis
tics illustrating that the majority of students like the program
as it currently exists and stated: "If it's not broke, don't fix it.
It (the program) isn't broke, but it can never be perfect.... I
think we have an excellent course."
Other faculty members, also wary of possible changes in
Western Culture, voiced concerns over the prospect of fin
ding competent faculty to teach a world culture curriculum
or a program with a non-Furopean focus.
Robinson said that it is difficult enough to teach the
classes as thev currently are constructed due to the vast
amount of material covered in each. Expanding the material
to be covered would only in,ike teaching the classes appear
even less appealing to tenured senior faculty, he said.
Many professors also stressed the important links be
tween American and European cultures.
English Prof. Ronald Rehholz said that women and
minorities should receive more attention, but that there are
practical constraints as to how much one professor can
legitimately and aptly cover. Given these constraints, he
stressed the importance of conveying to Stanford students
the key role that European culture has played in their cur
rent lives.
Rebholz said that it is most important to give students "a
sense of who they are and why they are today.
According to Rebholz. women and minorities should be
"a matter of constant concern in the program. Rebholz
added that he was not sure how substantial a part they
should play.
Conversely, mam faculty members argued that the West
ern Culture Program, as it currently stands, must be
broadened.
Political Science Prof David Abernethy said that the pres
ent program alienates minority students and consequently
hurts many other aspects of Stanford life for everyone.
Abernethv said, however, that the program should not be
widened to include non-Western cultures. Rather, the pro
gram could be structured to contrast perceptions of the
West bv the Western self to perceptions by the non-
Western 'other
Other faculty, such as Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs,
noted that even the manner in which the Academic Council
was discussing the Western Culture requirement illustrated
a son of "ethnocentric" world view and that non-Western
cultures have lessons to teach, in and of themselves, not
merely as backdrops to Western culture.
