## Charming killers 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Though well-mannered, cour
teous and relatively soft-spoken, the
bad guys in "52 Pick-Up" are ex
tremely dangerous. They're respon
sible for some of the most revolt
ingly violent scenes in recent films
(and yes, 1 saw "Blue Velvet").
They're also responsible for making
'52 Pick-Up" a classic thriller,
despite the presence of less inter
esting good guys like Harry Mitchell
(Roy Scheider).
Renowned detective writer
Elmore Leonard makes a valiant at
tempt with his first screen adapta
tion of one of his best-sellers. The
way Leonard has written things,
hero Roy Scheider can't measure
up to his evil counterparts. He plays
a DeLorean-like character whose
hard work as a young man pays off
in establishing his own company,
Ranco Steel. But some of his old
habits remain to give depth and grit

We're fascinated
by these villains
because they're
capable of so
much violence.

to his glittery southern California
lifestyle: He drinks a Coors while
wearing a tuxedo, gets his hands
dirty from working on the Jaguar he
built himself, and he talks and
swears with his company workers
as if he were one himself.
Scheider's Harry Mitchell is likable
and yet mean at the same time.
His meanness begins to show
when he sends an envelope with an
insulting refusal to the men trying
to extort him, when he was
supposed to have included $10,000.
Mitchell isn't afraid of these
seemingly soft criminals who, with
all the courtesy that you or I might
entertain a friend, show him a video
cassette he might be interested in.
Of course he is interested, because
the video shows him making love to
his 22-year-old mistress in a motel
room. Mitchell confesses his affair
to his wife, but he refuses to pay the
extortionists.
This causes them to roll their
second feature video to Mitchell,
and we see the full extent of their
insanity. We don't like these extor

tionists more than we do Mitchell,
but somehow we're drawn to them,
fascinated by them, simply because
they're capable of so much vio
lence. It's the same instinct that
makes us interested in rattle snakes
and sharks. We fear them, yet we
want to know more about them,
even if it means watching them in
their destructive acts.
Leonard and director John
Frankenheimer play upon our in
stinctual interest in villains by
giving us one of the most unusual
killers since Jack Nicholson in"The
Shining," namely, John Glover as
extortionist Alan Raimey. 1 think
Leonard meant this character to be
funny, in a sick way, otherwise the
amount of violence that results
from his insanity would be un
bearable. Even with the humor, it's
still upsetting. But Glover manages
to distance us from the violence
with subtle touches of comedy.
For example, while showing
Mitchell the second video (during
which I advise the weak-of-heart to
go buy some Junior Mints), Glover's
character tells Mitchell, "I wish 1
had some popcorn and lemonade
for you, but this is kind of a low
budget production."
Ironic touches like these con
tinue throughout the movie. Before
a meeting with Mitchell in a dark
area, Raimey makes sure to lock his
car door; the extortionist worries
about getting ripped off. He calls
Mitchell "sport" and his wife (Ann
Margaret) "slim," and is unfailingly
polite, always making small talk.
Thus Raimey defies all our criminal
stereotypes. He's a yuppie with a
business degree from Northwest
ern, has a good sense of humor and
smiles a lot. If he weren't a mur
derer, rapist, extortionist and
owner of porn films, his manners
would be impeccable.
Raimey's partner in crime, the
ironically named Bobby Shy
(Clarence Williams III) is definitely
not coy about killing. He too has his
share of sick, blackly humorous
lines. After nearly killing his
girlfriend for spilling some infor
mation, he says, "All right, all right, I
believe you, but I believe
everybody," as if he were just an old
softy at heart.
All of our interest is drawn by
these two characters. Their
dialogue is refreshingly original,
and the fact that they are good and
kind, despite their violent exploits,
gives them a unique depth. But it's
still difficult to watch all the vio
lence in "52 Pick-Up" just to be en
tertained by two characters who
aren't even the center of the
movie's attention. If you can stand
the violence, by all means see it. If
not, you'd better read the book.

with subtle touches of comedy.
For example, while showing
Mitchell the second video (during
which I advise the weak-of-heart to
go buy some Junior Mints), Glover's
character tells Mitchell, "I wish 1
had some popcorn and lemonade
for you, but this is kind of a low
budget production."
Ironic touches like these con
tinue throughout the movie. Before
a meeting with Mitchell in a dark
area, Raimey makes sure to lock his
car door; the extortionist worries
about getting ripped off. He calls
Mitchell "sport" and his wife (Ann
Margaret) "slim," and is unfailingly
polite, always making small talk.
Thus Raimey defies all our criminal
stereotypes. He's a yuppie with a
business degree from Northwest
ern, has a good sense of humor and
smiles a lot. If he weren't a mur
derer, rapist, extortionist and
owner of porn films, his manners
would be impeccable.
Raimey's partner in crime, the
ironically named Bobby Shy
(Clarence Williams III) is definitely
not coy about killing. He too has his
share of sick, blackly humorous
lines. After nearly killing his
girlfriend for spilling some infor
mation, he says, "All right, all right, I
believe you, but I believe
everybody," as if he were just an old
softy at heart.
All of our interest is drawn by
these two characters. Their
dialogue is refreshingly original,
and the fact that they are good and
kind, despite their violent exploits,
gives them a unique depth. But it's
still difficult to watch all the vio
lence in "52 Pick-Up" just to be en
tertained by two characters who
aren't even the center of the
movie's attention. If you can stand
the violence, by all means see it. If
not, you'd better read the book.
Though well-mannered, cour
teous and relatively soft-spoken, the
bad guys in "52 Pick-Up" are ex
tremely dangerous. They're respon
sible for some of the most revolt
ingly violent scenes in recent films
(and yes, 1 saw "Blue Velvet").
They're also responsible for making
'52 Pick-Up" a classic thriller,
despite the presence of less inter
esting good guys like Harry Mitchell
(Roy Scheider).
Renowned detective writer
Elmore Leonard makes a valiant at
tempt with his first screen adapta
tion of one of his best-sellers. The
way Leonard has written things,
hero Roy Scheider can't measure
up to his evil counterparts. He plays
a DeLorean-like character whose
hard work as a young man pays off
in establishing his own company,
Ranco Steel. But some of his old
habits remain to give depth and grit

We're fascinated
by these villains
because they're
capable of so
much violence.

to his glittery southern California
lifestyle: He drinks a Coors while
wearing a tuxedo, gets his hands
dirty from working on the Jaguar he
built himself, and he talks and
swears with his company workers
as if he were one himself.
Scheider's Harry Mitchell is likable
and yet mean at the same time.
His meanness begins to show
when he sends an envelope with an
insulting refusal to the men trying
to extort him, when he was
supposed to have included $10,000.
Mitchell isn't afraid of these
seemingly soft criminals who, with
all the courtesy that you or I might
entertain a friend, show him a video
cassette he might be interested in.
Of course he is interested, because
the video shows him making love to
his 22-year-old mistress in a motel
room. Mitchell confesses his affair
to his wife, but he refuses to pay the
extortionists.
This causes them to roll their
second feature video to Mitchell,
and we see the full extent of their
insanity. We don't like these extor

tionists more than we do Mitchell,
but somehow we're drawn to them,
fascinated by them, simply because
they're capable of so much vio
lence. It's the same instinct that
makes us interested in rattle snakes
and sharks. We fear them, yet we
want to know more about them,
even if it means watching them in
their destructive acts.
Leonard and director John
Frankenheimer play upon our in
stinctual interest in villains by
giving us one of the most unusual
killers since Jack Nicholson in"The
Shining," namely, John Glover as
extortionist Alan Raimey. 1 think
Leonard meant this character to be
funny, in a sick way, otherwise the
amount of violence that results
from his insanity would be un
bearable. Even with the humor, it's
still upsetting. But Glover manages
to distance us from the violence
with subtle touches of comedy.
For example, while showing
Mitchell the second video (during
which I advise the weak-of-heart to
go buy some Junior Mints), Glover's
character tells Mitchell, "I wish 1
