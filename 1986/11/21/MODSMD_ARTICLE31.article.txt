# 'Streets' is down for the count
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
Take a splash of "Moscow on the
Hudson" and a dash of "Rocky IV" and
what you end up with is an unoriginal
new film called "Streets of Gold," star
ring the talented Austrian actor, Klaus
Maria Brandauer.
When 1 say talented, I mean talented.
Brandauer's seemingly effortless abil
ity to flesh out highly distinctive
characterizations has been the mark of
his brilliant career. For his portrayal in
"Mephisto" as an actor who col
laborates with Nazis to advance his
career, he was named Best Actor at the
1982 Cannes Film Festival. He went on
to win further critical acclaim for the
title role in "Colonel Redl." From that
point, he was launched to international
stardom for his terrific performance as
a formidable, charming villain on the
James Bond film, "Never Say Never
Again." Last year, his understated per
formance as Meryl Streep's lecherous
husband in "Out of Africa" was
definitely the best thing about Sydney
Pollack's overrated film, and it earned
Brandauer a well-deserved Oscar nom
ination.
It is the strength of Brandauer's tal
ents that are only occasionally able to
lift "Streets of Gold" out of the time
worn genre of the cliched sports film.
Brandauer plays Alek Neuman, a Rus
sian Jew and former championship
boxer who was banned from boxing in
his native country because of his religi
ous beliefs.
Neuman comes to America, like
most immigrants, with the hopes of fin
ding streets paved with gold. Instead,
he finds that he must start his new life
in America at the lowest level of Ameri
can existence — as a busboy in a bust
ling restaurant. Neuman's self-pity and
depression drive him to the brink of al
coholism, and, on one drunken night,
he wanders into a seedy, underground
boxing match and witnesses the
boxing skills of two young fighters,
Jenkins (Wesley Snipes) and Boyle
(Adrian Pasdar).
Being particularly impressed by the
athletic ability — but not the technique
— of Jenkins, Neuman half-drunkenly
challenges him to a fight. Despite his
age and pot belly, Neuman still retains
some of the moves that made him a
champ, as he deftly sidesteps each of
Jenkins' powerful swings. The two are
separated before they can hurt each
other, but Neuman is left feeling even
more frustrated that he never had the
chance to see his dream of becoming a
world-class fighter come true.
Boyle, after witnessing Neuman's
encounter with Jenkins, recognizes

Neuman's talents and sees him as the
guiding force who might be able to
help him realize his potential as a great
fighter. Boyle then makes Neuman an
offer to coach him, and Neuman,
seeing his chance to experience his
lost glory vicariously, accepts. He
begins training Boyle and eventually
ends up training Jenkins as well.
Neuman's chance to see his fighters
demonstrate his and their ability is at a
bout with, of course, a Russian boxing
team that just happens to be coming to
the neighborhood. The rest of the film
revolves around his training of the two
fighters, how one of the fighters gets
injured and how one is left to fight the
Russians, and, well, it's not too hard to
guess how it ends.
My main complaint here is: Why is it
so impossible for screenwriters to
conjuoe up original sports movies?
seen the "Rocky - " genre play
itself out in countless films and there's
really no point to seeing it again in
"Streets of Gold." The one slightly

novel aspect about the film is that, for
once, we are watching from the per
spective of the coach, not the athlete.
Despite that fact, the movie still ends
up as a victim of the "Rocky"
syndrome.
Anyway, it's a shame to see Bran
dauer working in a movie that isn't
worthy of his talents. The rest of the
cast members are adequate. Wesley
Snipes ("Wildcats") lacks emotional
depth but is nevertheless energetic as
Roland Jenkins, the skilled black
fighter. Adrian Pasdar ("Top Gun") is
also out of his league but is appealing
as Timmy Boyle, the hotheaded Irish
boxer. Finally, Angela Molina ("That
Obscure Object of Desire") never
quite makes an impact, but is pleasant
to look at, as Neuman's romantic inter
est.
Aside from the script, the film's
other problems are the fault of first
time director Joe Roth (who co
produced "Bachelor Party" and
"Where the River Runs Black"). Espe

cially his boring camera. Although this
is supposed to partly be an action film,
he settles for extended long shots and
conventional angles that lack any visual
creativity. To his credit, however, the
training and boxing scenes are pretty
convincing.
Another negative aspect about the
film is the music byjack Nitzche which,
although it tries to be sensitive and
strong, turns out to be needlessly ex
cessive and intrusive.
Even though I've given "Streets of
Gold" a pretty bad rap, suffice it to say I
wasn't bored by it. All in all, it's a harm
less piece of entertainment that may
satisfy those people who like to see
"Rocky" movies over and over again.
It's just somewhat insulting that a
talented group of people, who had the
potential to make a good film, resorted
to the tried and true method of a for
mulaic, hackneyed plot line that we've
seen in every sports movie from here
to eternity. In my opinion, "Streets of
Gold" ends up down for the full count.

mold. Above (1-r): Brandauer as a boxing coach and Adrian Pasdar as the young fighter he trains.
