The Woodentops — "Giant"
Betelgeuse Betelgeuse Betelgeuse
Betel (3 1/2)
It was another of Sparky s eternally
long messages on my answering ma
-1 hine, the kind that make you yearn for
the days when the caller got 20
anxiety-ridden seconds to stammer his
or her name, number, time he/she
c alled and brief message before being
cut off bv your insensitive machine. 1
didn t need to listen to the whole thing
to know what he wanted, so I called
him back. "I'd like to review the
Woodentops." He scoffed: "But Ben,
we need to review something MAIN
STREAM."
Precisely. We're talking about Co
lumbia Records. Production with the
big pop sound of Bob Sargeant
(Remember the English Beat and.
more to the point, Haircut One
Hundred?). College radio superstar
dom usually reserved for teen idols
such as Depeche Mode with the last
three months spent in the top five at
KZSU and literally hundreds of OTHER
college radio stations. Commercial
radio airplay on the way. "But why,"
you mutter to yourself in the midst of
econ lecture, "should ! care?"
Well, "Giant" is good pop music.
The music is creative, infectiously
happy and not too demanding of the
listener. You'll hum along on the first
listen but not be bored out of vour

mind by the 10th. There are more pop
hooks in most songs here than most
bands put in whole albums.
The band relies heavily on acoustic
sound. Six- and 12-string guitars, vocal
harmonies and inventive percussion
jump out at the listener. But this is not
Peter, Paul and Mary with marimbas.
When the situation calls for speed and
intensity, the Woodentops prove that it
is possible to have both without in
validating their basic approach; the
music just gets faster and better. Where
a slower tempt) permits, the band uses
quirky instrumentation to flesh out its
melodies, the idea being to reinterpret
the way pop music sounds rather than
to change its premise. Give it a listen.
This could be exactly what you need to
make it through the rest of the quarter.

The House martins — "London 0
Hull 4"
Aldebaran Aldebaran Aldeb (2 1/2)
We know what you're thinking. You
listen to KZSU all the time. You've
heard "Happy Hour," this year's
nominee for the Paul McCartney Peppi
ness Prize, eleventy-billion times. Boy,
it's fab, isn't it? It's got that great bub
blegummy guitar riff thing and those
adorable, sincerely urgent vocals,
backed with nifty four-part harmonies.
And it's by this band called the
Housemartins.
What a cute name! You rush out to
get a look at their album. The cover is
this neat shade of green and sorta

looks an awful lot like an early '60s Par
lophone release. You note that its
called "London 0 Hull 4." You're not
real sure what this means, but it sure
does sound spiffy! Then you turn it
over to see what they look like. And if
they aren't the darnedest, most clean
cut, CI'TEST bunch of fellers.... Well,

you clutch the album close to your
heart and dash to the register to plunk
down your eight bucks, squealing in
comprehensibly all the while about the
next Beatles after the Knack and Duran
Duran and oh!! You re delirious.
If this hasn't happened to you yet,
good. Because it's time to dispel this

myth of benign cuteness associated
with the Housemartins. Y'see, there's
this new trend over in England for
bands to have cute names and cute
sounding songs, but all the while to
have deep-down political awareness
and Marxist inclinations. The
Housemartins are into this.
Aside from all the messages, the
guys don't seem to have a heck of a lot
of musical innovation. They've got
your standard pop cliches, but they
add a few more, like vocal non
diversity a la Smiths and, most annoy
ing of all, that darn four-beat riff which
they can adjust to be peppy or dirgy,
depending on what the Housemartins
feel like saying.
Mavbe the lesson to be learned from
young British commies is that being
political is OK as long as you try to
have a good time with it. When you get
TOO serious, it gets a little bother
some. After all. music is for fun. Isn't it?

Everything But the Girl — "Baby
the Stars Shine Bright"
Polaris Polaris Polaris (3)
When Everything But the Girl came
out with its first album in 1984, it was
lumped along with the Style Council
and Sade as part of a new, softer
jazz/soul-influenced pop sound. And
rightly so: Tracy Thorn sang "The Paris
Match" on the first Style Council LP and
Ben Watt played guitar on the same
song. Paul Weller, former Jam leader
and current Style Councilor, worked

on Thorn's two solo albums.
But with its third album, Everything
But the Girl move away from the
simple guitar and vocal arrangements
that characterized its self-titled debut
and its second release, "Love Not
Money.' The Thorn/Watt duo is
branching into other areas. They do
country with "Come Hell or High
Water (with Thorn sounding suspici
ously like Linda Ronstadt). They have
sophisticated orchestral arrangments
with tunes like "Don't Leave Me Be
hind.' In fact, along with Thorn on vo
cals, Watt on guitar, and a regular bas
sist, drummer, and keyboardist, the
group now has a full-fledged 48-piece
orchestra, arranged by Watt.
Even with the addition of the or
chestra, however, the real basis
is Thorn's strong, sultry voice, the
moody melodies and the emotion
laden lyrics. Thorn primarily writes
about failing relationships, infidelity
and troubled actresses: "Sugar Finney"
is dedicated to Marilyn Monroe, just as
"Ugly Little Dreams" on "Lowe Not
Money" was dedicated to Frances
Farmer.
"Baby the Stars ..is great for
doing homework to or listening to
before bed. It's NOT good music for a
raging party. Everything But the Girl
again proves that they're at their best
performing soulful ballads, even with
an entire orchestral ensemble behind
them. But this is OK, because it's ex
actly what Tracey Thorn's voice is best
suited for.

jazz/soul-influenced pop sound. And
rightly so: Tracy Thorn sang "The Paris
Match" on the first Style Council LP and
Ben Watt played guitar on the same
song. Paul Weller, former Jam leader
and current Style Councilor, worked

on Thorn's two solo albums.
But with its third album, Everything
But the Girl move away from the
simple guitar and vocal arrangements
that characterized its self-titled debut
and its second release, "Love Not
Money.' The Thorn/Watt duo is
branching into other areas. They do
country with "Come Hell or High
Water (with Thorn sounding suspici
ously like Linda Ronstadt). They have
sophisticated orchestral arrangments
with tunes like "Don't Leave Me Be
hind.' In fact, along with Thorn on vo
cals, Watt on guitar, and a regular bas
sist, drummer, and keyboardist, the
group now has a full-fledged 48-piece
orchestra, arranged by Watt.
Even with the addition of the or
chestra, however, the real basis
is Thorn's strong, sultry voice, the
moody melodies and the emotion
laden lyrics. Thorn primarily writes
about failing relationships, infidelity
and troubled actresses: "Sugar Finney"
is dedicated to Marilyn Monroe, just as
"Ugly Little Dreams" on "Lowe Not
Money" was dedicated to Frances
Farmer.
"Baby the Stars ..is great for
doing homework to or listening to
before bed. It's NOT good music for a
raging party. Everything But the Girl
again proves that they're at their best
performing soulful ballads, even with
an entire orchestral ensemble behind
them. But this is OK, because it's ex
actly what Tracey Thorn's voice is best
suited for.

The Woodentops — "Giant"

It was another of Sparky s eternally
long messages on my answering ma
-1 hine, the kind that make you yearn for
the days when the caller got 20
anxiety-ridden seconds to stammer his
or her name, number, time he/she
c alled and brief message before being
cut off bv your insensitive machine. 1
didn t need to listen to the whole thing
to know what he wanted, so I called
him back. "I'd like to review the
Woodentops." He scoffed: "But Ben,
we need to review something MAIN
STREAM."
Precisely. We're talking about Co
lumbia Records. Production with the
big pop sound of Bob Sargeant
(Remember the English Beat and.
more to the point, Haircut One
Hundred?). College radio superstar
dom usually reserved for teen idols
such as Depeche Mode with the last
three months spent in the top five at
KZSU and literally hundreds of OTHER
college radio stations. Commercial
radio airplay on the way. "But why,"
you mutter to yourself in the midst of
econ lecture, "should ! care?"
Well, "Giant" is good pop music.
The music is creative, infectiously
happy and not too demanding of the
listener. You'll hum along on the first
listen but not be bored out of vour

mind by the 10th. There are more pop
hooks in most songs here than most
bands put in whole albums.
The band relies heavily on acoustic
sound. Six- and 12-string guitars, vocal
harmonies and inventive percussion
jump out at the listener. But this is not
Peter, Paul and Mary with marimbas.
When the situation calls for speed and
intensity, the Woodentops prove that it
is possible to have both without in
validating their basic approach; the
music just gets faster and better. Where
a slower tempt) permits, the band uses
quirky instrumentation to flesh out its
melodies, the idea being to reinterpret
the way pop music sounds rather than
to change its premise. Give it a listen.
This could be exactly what you need to
make it through the rest of the quarter.

The House martins — "London 0
Hull 4"
Aldebaran Aldebaran Aldeb (2 1/2)
We know what you're thinking. You
listen to KZSU all the time. You've
heard "Happy Hour," this year's
nominee for the Paul McCartney Peppi
ness Prize, eleventy-billion times. Boy,
it's fab, isn't it? It's got that great bub
blegummy guitar riff thing and those
adorable, sincerely urgent vocals,
backed with nifty four-part harmonies.
And it's by this band called the
Housemartins.
What a cute name! You rush out to
get a look at their album. The cover is
this neat shade of green and sorta

looks an awful lot like an early '60s Par
lophone release. You note that its
called "London 0 Hull 4." You're not
real sure what this means, but it sure
does sound spiffy! Then you turn it
over to see what they look like. And if
they aren't the darnedest, most clean
cut, CI'TEST bunch of fellers.... Well,

you clutch the album close to your
heart and dash to the register to plunk
down your eight bucks, squealing in
comprehensibly all the while about the
next Beatles after the Knack and Duran
Duran and oh!! You re delirious.
If this hasn't happened to you yet,
good. Because it's time to dispel this

myth of benign cuteness associated
with the Housemartins. Y'see, there's
this new trend over in England for
bands to have cute names and cute
sounding songs, but all the while to
have deep-down political awareness
and Marxist inclinations. The
Housemartins are into this.
Aside from all the messages, the
guys don't seem to have a heck of a lot
of musical innovation. They've got
your standard pop cliches, but they
add a few more, like vocal non
diversity a la Smiths and, most annoy
ing of all, that darn four-beat riff which
they can adjust to be peppy or dirgy,
depending on what the Housemartins
feel like saying.
Mavbe the lesson to be learned from
young British commies is that being
political is OK as long as you try to
have a good time with it. When you get
TOO serious, it gets a little bother
some. After all. music is for fun. Isn't it?
