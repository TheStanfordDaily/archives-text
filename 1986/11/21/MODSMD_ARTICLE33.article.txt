# Blacklisted film now stands as a classic

### GINA POE 
The film "Salt of the Earth" and the accompa
nying documentary "A Crime Fit the Punish
ment" were more than just two good flicks on a
Friday night. In fact, the two films made up a
rather gala event. Besides kicking off the
sjatewide MEChA conference, last Friday's
screening brought together many of the partici
pants in the original 1951 film, "Salt of the
Earth," and those who are fighting to keep the
movie's message alive today.
El Centro, the Chicano Student Activities
Committee, MEChA and other support groups
here at Stanford played a historic human rights
film of 1951, a classic docudrama that survived
the Hollywood film industry's blacklist as well
as the pervading "red-scare" mentality of the
post-war McCarthy era. "Salt of the Earth" was
the first film of its kind, illustrating both the
struggle of Mexican-Americans to achieve
equality in the workplace and the struggle of
women to rise above the stereotype of
bomemaker to achieve a legitimate role in soci
ety.
It's easy to recognize "Salt of the Earth" as a
work of historical importance. When it was
originally released, the film was squelched by
distributors; Hollywood threatened to blacklist
any theatre that hosted it. But the film was
warmly received abroad. In 1954 it won the
Grand Prize at Czechoslovakia's international
film festival, and it was awarded the Academic
du Cinema de Paris Award in 1956. It has been
seen in a host of European countries, and even

such culturally remote places as the Soviet Un
ion and China.
The story of the film's production, docu
mented in "A Crime to Fit the Punishment," is
one of persistence and faith in the face of viol
ent opposition.
In 1951, a group of blacklisted Hollywood
filmmakers got wind of a strike for equal rights
by Mexican-American mine workers in Grant
County, N.M. Unique to this strike was the role
of the Chicano women of the community, who
stepped in and took over the picket line when
their men faced defeat under the Taft-Hartley
anti-picketing injunction placed against them.
The filmmakers, excluded from Hollywood for
refusing to cooperate with the House Commit
tee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), decided
that this was a chance for them to commit a
crime to fit the punishment.
Arriving in Silver City, N.M., they go to work
recreating the events of the preceding 16
months there. Screenwriter and Stanford
graduate Michael Wilson ("A Place in the Sun")
had trouble getting the miners to agree on his
scripts. "We turned his script down so many
times," recalls Virginia Chacon, wife of the
film's male lead and community leader, Juan
Chacon, and member of the local 890 Women's
Auxilliary. "We wanted how we were living to
be in the script," she says, not some made-up
Hollywood fantasy.
Director Herbert Bieberman decided to cast
many of the miners and their families as them
selves. "We began to feel that no professional
actors could possibly give us the ring of truth
we were seeking," says Sonjia Bieberman, asso

ciate director. "I remember Juan Chacon spoke
of his horror when we chose him to play the
lead male role, but he did a magnificent job. We
showed him not how to act, but to remember.
This is, perhaps, the secret to the impact of
the movie. The tale itself is simple. It is only
black and white, good versus evil, the sneaky,
unfair management and the proud, honest
workmen and their supportive wives. And good
ultimately wins the decisive battle over evil,
giving "Salt of the Earth' a happily-ever-after
ending that largely ignores the long struggle
the miners will face in the years ahead. Never
theless, this film rings true because the actors
and actresses are playing themselves, reliving
their experiences of that period, mindful of
their victory, trusting in a naive and inspira
tional faith that things will be better for them in
the future.
"The remembrances of the miners were so
strong," recalls Bieberman. When acting out a
particularly emotional scene, "one of the
miners got so exited about it we had to take
him aside" to calm him down again.
In one dramatic scene, the miners and their
wives are in the union meeting house, facing
the serious implications of the Taft-Hartley anti
picketing injunction. As far as the men could
see, their only choices were grim: They could
remain in the picket line and be carted off to
jail; they could give up their struggle and go
back to work; or they could leave the picket
line and lose their jobs to face all the hardships
of poverty. But the gloom of the meeting room
seemed to literally ignite with surprise, deri
sion and hope as one woman suggested that the

Women's Auxilliary, previously confined to
providing coffee and donuts. now take over the
picket line. The emotion of the moment is so
tangible and the people so real, it's easy to im
agine oneself watching a newsreel rather than a
movie starring non-professional actors.
Unfortunately, the opposition to the film's
production from Hollywood and the govern
ment were real. During filming, the workers
Union House was burned down. An
anonymous caller threatened the crew that if
they didn't get out of town, they'd be carried
out in black boxes. The director's car was shot
at. The film's female lead, Mexican actress
Rosaura Revueltas, was hastily deported three
works before shooting was completed, on the
shaky excuse that one of her passport stamps
was missing. As a result, the director made crea
tive use of stand-ins for Revueltas, and even
made some secret trips to Mexico to finish film
ing.
"The post-production work was as just as
dangerous as the making of it,"says Steven
Mack, producer of "A Crime to Fit the Punish
ment."
"We were being followed constantly by the
FBI," says music composer Sol Kaplan, "and
our phones were tapped."
The film crew found access to film labs,
editing facilities and recording studios being
denied to them. "To record," says Kapaln with a
chuckle, "we had to pretend we were playing
for "Vaya Con Dio," and use blank leader tape
with dots and lines to cue us when we should
start and stop, rather than risk running the true
footage of the film."

"It came out rough. It's far from perfect," ad
mits Kaplan, "but it's the only film of the many
I've done that has gotten better over the years."
So what impact has the film had? Silver city,
N.M.. today languishes in the throes of a lagging
industry and high unemployment. Most of the
old residents remain indignant at the memory
of the trouble stirred up by the filmmakers.
One of the outspoken witnesses against the
blacklisted members of the film industry is now
president of the United States. And "Salt of the
Earth" has still never been given a proper com
mercial run in the United States. Was it worth
the struggle?
The participants believe so. "It was a tough
struggle, but I have no regrets," says Virginia
Chacon. "If we had to do it all over, I'd do it.
"It was a salutary change," says Sonjia Bieber
man. "It became a ilag for them. It speaks for
women, Chicanos, working class, blacklisted,
everyone who wanted to make a difference."
The last words we hear spoken by the film's
heroine, played by the deported Revueltas, are:
"Together we can push everything up with us
as we go. We had won something they could
never take away; something I could give to my
children, and they, the salt of the earth, would
inherit it."
Her words serve as a fitting description of
"Salt of the Earth." This film, documenting the
hope and inspiration of a people fighting for
their rights, has inspired others to continue the
struggle; thus no matter how excessive its
idealism and naivete might seem, "Salt of the
Earth" can indeed be deemed a success.
