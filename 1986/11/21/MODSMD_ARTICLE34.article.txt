Notorius (1946)
York, San Francisco
The most romantic (Editor's note and
f >est) of Alfred Hitchcock's pictures. When
her father turns out to be a Fascist, Ingrid
Bergman feels she must clear her name by
working to trap another Fascist — her
husband (Claude Rains). Bergman looks
ravishing, and her scenes with Cary Grant,
as the agent she is allied with, are among
the few genuine examples of eroticism in
American films of this puritanical decade.
Ben Hecht wrote the screenplay. Classic
sequences: the wine cellar scene and the
famous full-screen shot of the cellar key.

The Color Purple (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Steven Spielberg directed this candy
coated adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulit
zer Prize-winning novel, and he
transmutes both Walker's powerful emo
tional force and her blatant female
chauvinism. In the book, set among black
sharecroppers in 1909 Georgia, all of the
men are either oppressively loutish or
properly cowed, and all of the women are
loving, sisterly and long-suffering. Spiel'
berg doesn't change this basic dialectic,
but he does turn the men into ineffectual,
occasionally comical buffoons, and he
gives the material a "Song of the South'
patina. This is a movie-made Black South,
where even the cornstalks seem primed
for the camera. Walker's original charac
ters were little more than one
dimensional, but what Spielberg does
with them here is still slightly insulting; he
has them falling through roofs and
blowing apart stoves, and the net result is
we care about them as we might care
about Disney's animated critters. The
mostly faithful screenplay is by Menno
Meyjes, and Whoopi Goldberg as Celie
does as well as possible under Spielberg's
direction. With Margret Avery, Danny
Glover, Willard Pugh and Oprah Winfrey,
whose heroically powerful Sophia is the
best thing about the movie.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.

The Breakfast Club (1985)
Bechtel I-Center
John Hughes' film bristles with the self
importance of a movie that thinks it has
something earth-shattering to say about
teenagers. The five protagonists, stuck to
gether for eight hours in an unorthodox
Saturday detention, are an athlete (Emilio
Estevez), a juvenile delinquent (Judd Nel
son), a prom queen (Molly Ringwald), an
eccentric (Ally Sheedy) and an A student
(Anthony Michael Hall, who takes the act
ing honors). In the course of the day, they
form alliances, engage in confrontations
of various kinds, get stoned, discuss sex,
reveal their hang-ups, become friends and
pair off. Occasionally Hughes' talent for
adolescent conversation surfaces, but
most of the dialogue is of a confessional
nature, which strands most of the actors.
The movie is heavy-handed and preten
tious, but it impresses teenage audiences
with its self-seriousness. With Paul
Gleason and John Kapelos.
Plays Sunday at 8 p.m.

Spellbound (1945)
York, San Francisco ,
One of the most eagerly anticipated col
laborations in movie history: Alfred
Hitchcock directs Gregory Peck and In
grid Bergman in a Ben Hecht script, with
dream sequences designed by Salvador
Dali. Unhappily, the movie is a fiasco. The
dream decor is of passing interest, but the
Freudian content is risible ( just about as
much of the id as could be safely dis
played in a Bergdorf Goodman window,
according to James Agee), since it serves
merely as a fairly lunkheaded strategy for
unraveling a murder mystery. Leo G. Car
roll, Michael Chekhov and Rhonda
Fleming co-star.

Down and Out in Beverly Hills
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This charming class comedy takes off
from Jean Renoir's "Boudu Saved From
Drowning," and transplants the action into
swank Beverly Hills. Mangy bum Jerry Bas
kin (Nick Nolte) attempts suicide in the
swimming pool of the Whitemans, staid,
dissatisfied, noureau riche Californians;
he is rescued, taken in by the family, and
begins acting as a primal force in their
white-washed environment. The movie

treads an uneasy line between all-out sa
tire and humanistic comedy, and the dog
jokes and comic running around wear a
little thin, but director Paul Mazursky and
screenwriter Leon Capetanos do a great
job of capturing the precarious,
profoundly superficial mental state of the
Whitemans. The situations are so comi
cally ripe in the first half of tht movie that
the occasionally weak pay-offs are a defi
nite let-down in the last half. Overall,
though, it's a lot of fun, and Mazursky has

assembled a great cast: Richard Dreyfuss,
Bette Midler and Nolte in the major roles,
and Donald Munich, Tracy Nelson, Evan
Richards and Little Richard.
Plays tonight with "Back to School." Late
show: "Rocky Horror Picture Show"

Manhattan (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In a Chaplinesque display of ego,
Woody Allen makes the schlemiel hero
he's made us identify himself with pitifully
tormented: He is trying so hard to be true
to himself and fair to his lovers, but they
keep victimizing him. This character, Isaac
Davis, is involved with three women. His
wife Jill (Meryl Streep) throws him over
for another woman, writes a book expos
ing the dark underside of their marriage,
and retains custody of their little boy, who
is glimpsed in montages with Isaac that
signal us that he is the most loving of fat
hers. Mar)' (Diane Keaton) returns to her
old boyfriend, Isaac's best friend, Yale
(Michael Murphey). Tracy (Mariel
Hemingway) commits the unpardonable
crime of being too young — she is 17, and
in this movie's cockeyed terms, the in
discretion is all on her side. Ironically, the

redeeming grace of this infuriating movie
is the performances of the three actresses
cast in these roles. Gordon Willis did the
striking black and white photography; the
music is by George Gershwin.

Interiors (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Arthur (E.G. Marshall) has decided after
more than 30 years that he must leave his
> Tr

wife. Eve (Geraldine Page), who is an inte
rior decorator, and his action provokes
her to nervous breakdown and a series of
suicide attempts. They have three
daughters: Flyn (Kristin Griffith), a film
actress; Renata (Diane Keaton), a writer
whose author-husband Frederic (Richard
Jordan) is experiencing a painful writer's
block; and Joey (Mary Beth Hurt), married
to Michael (Sam Waterston) and searching
desperately for the appropriate form
through which to channel her urges for
self-expression. Ridden with angst in its
advanced stages, these stilted, overartic
ulate boobies voice despair in carefully
sculpted phrases so remote from human
experience that we draw back from these
people as if they were Martians. The film
seems to be ideal material for a Lily Tom
lin routine, and the characters are such
horrors that they are already parodied; we
long for Tomlin to take over, or better
still, Woody Allen — and then we realize
that Allen, writer, director, is the man who
invented these people, but he meant them
to be taken seriously. Except for Maureen
Stapleton, as the loud, passionate widow
Arthur falls in love with, the actors give the
kind of intense, psychodramatic perfor
mances that are sometimes mistaken for
first-rate acting.
Plays tomorrow with "Manhattan."

The Name of the Rose
Century 10, Mountain View
Italian semioticist Umberto Eco's novel
was both an intellectual bagatelle and a
medieval murder mystery, as well as a
fluke bestseller; French director Jean-
Jacques Annaud has concentrated on the
mystery, abandoning the book's wordplay
and literary themes. Annaud was obvi
ously attracted by the story's setting (a
medieval abbey) — the film is great to
look at, and Annaud exhibits the knack for
dark, sweeping imagemaking we first saw
in "Quest for Fire." He doesn't do as well
with the story itself; the movie moves too
slowly and goes on for too long, and it's
hard to keep the characters straight. But
Sean Connery, relaxed and charming as an
English Franciscan monk who sets about
investigating a mysterious death at the
German abbey he is visiting, is enough to
keep you interested until you fall under
the spell of the film's lovingly created at
mosphere. With F. Murray Abraham, in a
howlingly bad performance as a judge of
the Inquisition, Michael Lonsdale and
William Hickey.

She's Gotta Have It
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Independent black filmmaker Spike
Lee's <175,000, black-and-white feature
screams out its shoestring budget and its
maker's inexperience and lack of craft at
every moment: It's made in a mock
documentary, flashback style, with charac
ters speaking directly to the camera, that
allowed it to be shot in less than two
weeks; it's full of needless film-school
gimmickry in the editing; and some of the
acting is truly bad. But much of the movie
is hilarious, including every scene that
features Lee as Mars Blackmon, one of the
three lovers of Nola Darling (Tracy Camila

Johns), a young black woman who lives in
Bed-Stuy and would rather not commit.
"She's Gotta Have It" is basically a black
version of the omnipresent yuppie sex
comedy, set in Brooklyn rather than Man
hattan or Chicago; it's funnier and sexier
than most, but the characters are
cardboard and it doesn't have any more to
say about young love and sexual freedom
thiui "About Last Night" did. The movie's
real impact lies in Spike Lee's personal
style — the way he can plead "Please baby,
please baby, baby baby please" while
maintaining perfect dignity.

Something Wild
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A wonderful new comedy from director
Jonathan Demme ("Melvin and Howard,"
"Stop Making Sense"). Charlie Driggs,
square young bank vice-president with
submerged anarchic tendencies (Jeff
Daniels), is picked up on a Manhattan
sidewalk by Lulu (Melanie Griffith), a
beautiful, unpredictable and seemingly
unfathomable young woman. The movie
is the story of the trip she takes him on out
into America (and back again), the lies
they tell each other, the things they do that
they've never done before, and how all
this nearly kills them; it plumbs yuppie
conformity, mindless violence, and the
distance (or lack thereof) between them.
American filmmakers have been trying to
make a movie like this one for the past few
years — most notably Martin Scorsese
with "After Hours," but also Susan Seidel
man with "Desperately Seeking Susan"
and even, in a tangential way, David Lynch
with "Blue Velvet" — but none has
managed it so truly, so seamlessly and
with such depth of feeling. Daniels and
Griffith give warm, tremendously touch
ing performances; Ray Liotta makes an im
pressive movie debut as a man out of
Lulu's past. Written by E. Max Frye; shot by
the great Tak Fujimoto.

Round Midnight
Bijou, Palo Alto
This movie has plenty of jazz, but not
much soul. The great bebop sax man Dex
ter Gordon plays Dale Turner, an Ameri
can jazz man living in Paris in the '60s and
slowly killing himself with booze; he is
befriended by Francis, a young French
commercial artist (Francois Cluzet), who
gets him off the juice and back in the
studio. In addition to Gordon, the cast in
cludes musicians Bobby Hutcherson,
Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Freddie Hub
bard, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock
and singer Lonette McKee We see and
hear a lot of jazz played, including a mix of
standards and Hancock's and Gordon s
own compositions, fiut' director and co
writer Bertrand Tavernier doesn't bring
the music, and the passion these men and
women feel for it, to life. Tavernier's rela
tionship to his material resembles that of
Francis to the jazzmen he idolizes: We first
see the character huddled in the rain
outside a Paris club, listening to Turner
through a grate in the wall. Gordon has
tremendous dignity and presence, and the
scenes showing the friendship between
Turner, Francis and Francis's daughter

Berangere (Christine Pascal) arc very
touching; this seems to be the only part of 112
the movie Tavernier had any feel for.

The Gods Must Be Crazy (19*4)
Oaks Cupertino
Do people love this picture because the
comedy is lowest-common-denominatof
burlesque (really primal — sub-Three
Stooges stuff) under the guise of political
satire? The writer-director-photographer- 1
editor, Jamie Uys, seems to know what
he's doing when there's no one on the
screen but his charming bushman hero,
Ki, and a baboon or an elephant, but the
moment other human beings show up hi?
routines (and camerawork) become so
crude you'd swear he'd never seen a
movie. Marius Weyers, as the biologist in
the Kalahari Desert who falls apart when
he's around a beautiful woman, dominates
most of the film, and he's appalling. (It's
not merely that his timing is bad; he has
no apparent sense of humor at all.) The (
storyline has something to do with his
romance with a transplanted urban
schoolteacher, with desperate rebels
taking hostages, and with Ki's efforts to get
rid of a Coca-Cola bottle dropped from a
passing plane onto his tribe, and which he
considers a lunatic, burdensome gift from
the gods. (Hence the title.)

A Room with a View
Camera 3, San Jose
E.M. Forster described his Edwardian
romantic/comic novel as "Clear and
bright and well-constructed, but so thin,"
and that's a pretty accurate summing up of
this movie version, directed by James
Ivory from an adaptation by Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala. Jhabvala's screenplay is very
faithful to Forster, and preserves much of
his beautifully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger thematic,
more didactic elements of the novel (such
as Forster's sternly humanistic belief in
the supreme sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to inflate the
characters' passions; they keep everything
very light, entertaining and borderline
frivolous, and the movie stays exception
ally neat and well-constructed simply by
following Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and en
joyable group, with the slight exception of
Helena Bonham Carter, whose Lucy
Honeychurch doesn't seem quite the ves
sel for passion that Forster intended. She's
very likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith, Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm Elliot,
Julian Sands and a host of others.
