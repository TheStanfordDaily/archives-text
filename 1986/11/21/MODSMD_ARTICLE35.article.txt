## Card faces Bears away in Big Splash 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Stanford and California. In the sport of water polo,
much like football, Big Game, or the "Big Splash" in
this case, needs no introduction.
However, unlike Big Game in football, the Big
Splash \isually pits the two top teams in the nation
against each other. The NCAA Championships have
been v£dn by either the Cardinal or the Bears 10 out
of Ihe 12 years. Stanford and Cal have the two
premier water polo programs in the country.
"Cal and Stanford is the biggest rivalry in water
pofc>," Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "Big
Game has always meant the No. 1 ranking and the
(Pacific 10 Conference) league championship over
the years."
This year, however, the No. 1 ranking will not be at
stake when the top-rated and Pac-10 champion Card
inal and third-rated Bears (27-6) square off.
Few teams have been able to challenge the
dominance of this year's Stanford squad. Only in one
game this year (against USC on Nov. 7) has the Card
inal trailed in the second half. Stanford has held the
No. 1 ranking the entire season and will enter the
NCAAs'as the top seed regardless of the game's
outcome
Tomorrow, the Cardinal will travel to Spieker
Aquatic Center in Berkeley to face Cal for the fifth
time this season. The game is scheduled for a 10:30
a.m. start.
The Cardinal — led by a senior nucleus of 1985
Pac-10 Player of the Year Craig Klass, U.S. National
Team member David Imbernino, 1985 third-team All
America Greg Gamble, Greg Ocasek and Chris
Thompson — has won an NCAA-record 41 con
secutive games. Klass, with 77 goals, and junior Erich
Fischer, with 78 goals, lead the offensive attack.
Recently, Stanford has gotten the best of the Bears.
Stanford has won the last six meetings between the
two natipnal powers and holds a 29-13-3 advantage
over Cal since 1975. The last Bears victory over the
Cardinal was Oct. 5 1985, with Cal winning 9-8 in
overtime.
Cal, which recently lost its No. 2 ranking to Pac-10
rival UCI.A, has suffered four of its defeats this season
against Stanford. The Cardinal bested the Bears 11-8
at Cal on Sept. 12, 7-2 in the UC-Irvine Tournament
on Sept, 20, 9-7 at DeGuerre Pool on Oct. 4 and again
14-5 at home on Oct. 10.
"We weren't too successful the first four times,"
California Coach Pete Cutino said. "We know we do
not have the balance and experience that Stanford
has. It would take a real team effort to win.
Despite Stanford's recent success over Cal, the
Bears' loss of the No. 2 ranking along L with the adjdi
tio|ial charge of Big Game weekend could make Cal a
threatto the Cardinal. In addition, the Bears are
renowned for having tremendous home crowds.
' is going to look much different than

they did earlier in the season," Fischer said. "They
have had time to mature and I think they are much
improved. They are really out to gun us down."
In addition to the traditional Big Game intensity,
the game is the last chance for any team to upend the
undefeated Cardinal. It is the last regular season
game for both teams before the NCAAs Nov. 28-30.
"Every team has been looking to knock us off
before NCAAs," Thompson said. "If Berkeley beat us,
it would show other teams that we are beatable."
Although Cal is ranked below Stanford and would
perhaps rise to No. 2 once again with a victory tomor
rqyy, t th<? Cardinal has much, more, #t sfake.in the con
test.
Sports Illustrated has been at the Cardinal practice
sessions for the past week and will be on hand to
cover tomorrow's game. It will be featuring Stanford

in its next issue.
"We wouldn't want to lose to Cal with Sports Il
lustrated about to write an article on us," Dettamanti
said.
In addition, in its latest games against highly
ranked opponents — No. 4 Pepperdine, No. 6 USC
and No. 2 UCLA, Stanford has been a part of some un
characteristicly close contests for this year's team.
The Trojans traded leads with the Cardinal for three
quarters before finally bowing 11-9.
With a victory over the Bears, Stanford could enter
the NCAAs on a positive note and keep its winning
streak alive.
"There is a psychological element to the game,"
Thompson said. "If we win we will establish a
mindset for us and for the rest of the other teams that
we can't be beaten."

Stanford goalie Todd Kemp gained All-American honors last season in his freshman year. This season,
with the Cardinal undefeated and ranked No. 1 throughout the season, Kemp is once again a likely
candidate for postseason honors. In fact, both Stanford goalies (junior Obi Greenman shares duties
with Kemp) could be named to the All-American team.
