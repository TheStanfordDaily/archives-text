# Stanford, UCLA battle; conference title at stake
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Tqnight at 7:30 in Los Angeles, Stanford women's volley
ball will take on UCLA in what can unofficially be called the
1936* Pacific 10 Conference championship match.
Fbr the Cardinal, it will be a chance to affirm that its
swfeep of the Bruins in October was no fluke. For UCLA, it
will be a chance for revenge.
Stanford hosted the Bruins in the teams' first
meeting, UCLA came in as a definite favorite in terms of its
record and national ranking. By these standards, the Bruins
will again be the favorite tonight, but not so definitely, and
the jquad has a clear memory of how easily the Cardinal
proved the insignificance of records and rankings a little
mpre than a month ago by scores of 15-8, 15-7 and 15-2.
Stanford is 19-8 overall; UCLA is 28-9. The two are tied at
the top of the Pac-10 with 15-1 conference marks. The Card
inal spikers will finish up their league season tomorrow
night at USC, while UCLA's one remaining Pac-10 match is
also against 2-17 USC on Tuesday night.
Tlje Tachikara Coaches' Poll released early this week
ranks the Bruins eighth and the Cardinal tenth. With No. 13
Arizona State and No. 16 Oregon also named in the poll, the
Pac-10 is second to the Pacific Coast Athletic Conference in
top-20 representation. The PCAA has six schools in the top
11, including rankings two through five. Brigham Young is
ranked No. 1.

According to UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski, his team is
not really looking for revenge in tonight's contest. "It's
going to be a championship match, that's how we're ap
proaching it," Banachowski said. "We know this is it."
Banachowski expects a far superior performance from
the Bruins tonight in comparison to the one they gave at
Maples. "I hope we're better, I know we're better," he said.
"I don't think we played very well (in October's match)."
In terms of mental preparation going into the NCAA
playoffs in the first week of December, Banachowski feels
that his team's play in the "Pac-10 championship match" is
significant. In concrete terms, however, the Bruin coach
does not place too much importance on who wins or loses.
"As far as confidence goes, 1 think it's really important,"
Banachowski said. "But, frankly, as far as the outcome is
concerned, it really makes no difference who wins the con
ference t'tle.... We'll probably meet again in the regionals."
Cardinal setter Wendi Rush agreed that the two teams
would face each other again and that a win would give Stan
ford "an edge" in the tournament, but said that even a loss
could have a positive effect. "If we lose, it will just make us
want to win that much more in the NCAAs," she said.
Rush doesn't think the Bruins will have any home court
advantage tonight, due to the fact that most of the Cardinal
players' friends and family live in Southern California and
also to the tendency of Pauley Pavilion fans to cheer on
good volleyball from both sides of the net first and the
Bruins second.
