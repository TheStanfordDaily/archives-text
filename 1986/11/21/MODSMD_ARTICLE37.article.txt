The Stanford football team does not
hold the monopoly on Bay Area ath
letic competition this Big Game
weekend, as the men's gymnastics

7 need to see who

team will demonstrate when it opens
its season tonight and tomorrow in the
Spartan Open at San Jose State.
Competition begins today at 7 p.m.
with the optionals and culminates with
compulsories tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
and Iptionals again at 7:00 p.m.
Competing with the Cardinal will be
California, UC-Santa Barbara, UC-Davis,
Pullerton State and host San Jose State
"Everyone on my team will be com

peting," Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada
said.
The team, however, is not going into
the competition specifically with the
goal of victory.
"We're not trying to win the compe
tition," Hamada said. "At this time, I'd
like to see where they (the gymnasts)
are at so I can make a judgment. I
need to see who needs what in future
training.
"For all of the teams, the competi
tion is too early," he added. In order to
accomodate Stanford's academic calen
dar, the Spartans moved up the compe
tition so that it would not conflict with
Dead Week.
"The competition is a month earlier
than the previous year," Hamada
noted. "We're still in the middle of
training for tricks (in practice). It's still
too early to start routines."
However, all the teams will be at the
same disadvantage, giving Hamada and
his team a chance "to see where they
(the other teams) are and what they're
capable of at this time.'
The prognosis for this year's team is

excellent. The Cardinal comes off its
most successful season this decade, and
that fact, paired with an excellent
recruiting year, makes the team a force
to be reckoned with.
Last year, the Cardinal enjoyed the
No. 1 ranking for most of the season,
and finished the year second in the
Pac-10 and third in the NCAA finals in
Lincoln, Neb. In addition, Jon Louis, a
senior in 1985, garnered the title of
best all-around.
Except for Louis and Gary Smith,
who is now an assistant coach on the
women's team, all of last year's gym
nasts are returning: Mark Arnold,
Randy Besosa, Chuck Gerardo, Mike
Matzek, Andy Ropp and Scott Schaffer.
Joining them is the result of a year of
hard recruiting. The new freshmen in
clude Charles Loop and Adam
Foreman, both from Dallas, and Con
rad Voorsanger from San Rafael, Calif.
Foreman, who finished first at the 1985
Class I Junior Nationals, is the most
prominent of the group and should
play a role in the already- strong Card
inal line-up.
