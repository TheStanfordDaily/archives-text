# Muster Kodak All-American
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Stanford running back Brad Muster,
poised to become only the second
Stanford player in history' to rush for
1,000 yards in a season, was named
yesterday to the first team of the
Eastman Kodak All-America team.
Muster is the first Stanford player to
be named to the Kodak team since
quarterback John Elway in 1982.
"I feel very honored to be associated
with the other great football players on
this team," Muster said. "I owe a lot of
credit to the offensive line and the
other running backs who've blocked
for me. I'm certainly glad to be part not
only of the All-America team but the
Stanford team as well."
The Kodak selectors had sent a
camaraman to Stanford's 28-23 win
over UCLA two weeks ago. Muster
carried 38 times for 183 yards in that
game, a performance that no doubt
helped the panel of coaches make its
decision. The game was also carried on
regional television by CBS.
Muster has rushed for 886 yards
through nine games this season, an
average of 98 yards per game. The 226-
pound fourth-year junior from Novato
needs to average only 38 yards in his
final three games to reach 1,000 yards
and join Darrin Nelson, the only other
Stanford back to turn the trick. Nelson
had 1,000-yard seasons in 1977, 1978
and 1981.
To break Nelson's single-season
record of 1,069 yards, Muster needs
only to rush for 61 yards in each of the
Cardinal's final games against Califor

nia, Arizona and Clemson.
In his last two games against Wash
ington State and UCLA, Muster has
carried 75 times for 373 yards, includ
ing a career-longest run of 74 yards in
the first quarter at UCLA.
Muster also leads the Cardinal in re
ceiving this season with 53 receptions
for 519 yards, though he will likely not
break the school record of 78 he set
last season.
Muster is second on the all-time
Stanford rushing list with 2,224 yards,
and tied for second on the all-time
receptions list with 162. He has 12
touchdowns and 72 points this season.
Muster has been pivotal to the Gator
Bowl-bound Cardinal's 7-2 season so
far. Stanford is 4-0 in games in which
he has rushed more than 100 yards,
and in losses to Washington and USC,
he ran for only 11 and 35 yards, carry
ing 10 times against the Huskies and
eight against the Trojans.
With his selection, Muster will have
the chance to appear on the"The Bob
Hope Christmas Special" on NBC next
month.
