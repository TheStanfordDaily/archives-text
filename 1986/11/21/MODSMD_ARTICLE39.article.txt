# Raiders win in OT
## 
### 
SAN DIEGO (AP) â€” Marcus Allen
ran 28 yards for a touchdown 8:33 into
overtime last night to rally the Los An
geles Raiders to a 37-31 NFL victory
over the San Diego Chargers.
The Raiders, winning for the eighth
time in nine games since an 0-3 start,
drove 56 yards in five plays on their
second possession of the overtime per
iod. A key play in the drive was a 28-
yard pass completion from Jim
Plunkett to Todd Christensen that
moved the ball to the San Diego 38. Al
len ran for 10 yards to the 28 and, after
an incompletion, Allen scooted around
right end, broke a couple of tackles

and carried two Chargers into the end
zone for the winning score.
The Raiders, stung by San Diego's
second-half rally from a 21-point defi
cit, had a chance to win the game with
seven seconds to play in regulation.
But Chris Bahr's 35-yard field goal at
tempt was blocked by rookie lineman
Jeff Walker, who had blocked two kicks
already this season.
Los Angeles defensive stars Lester
Hayes and Jerry Robinson teamed up
to convert two San Diego turnovers
into touchdowns.
Curtis Adams ran one and 13 yards
for Chargers touchdowns.
