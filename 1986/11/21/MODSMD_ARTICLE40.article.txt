### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
Light winds made for a less than thrilling Stanford
Frosh/Soph/Women's regatta last weekend, but the
Cardinal sailing team showed that it could bring its
winning style to even the most boring events.
The sailors continued to dominate in West Coast com
petition, with finishes of first and fourth in the freshman
sophomore division, and second, third, and fourth in the
women's division of Stanford's first home regatta of the
season.
Though the regatta was scheduled to be held over
both Saturday and Sunday, a dying breeze on Saturday
and a total lack of wind on Sunday shortened the compe
tition to a set of four races held on the first day.
Sophomores Brad Swett and Lori Dobeus led the
home team to victory in their division, narrowly defeat
ing a team from Santa Barbara to capture the regatta's top
prize.
Close on the heels of the winning pair were fellow

Stanford sailors Al Sargent, a freshman, and sophomore
Rita Snape, who finished fourth, and freshmen Bruce
Smith and Jonathan Schiebes, who scored a 10th in the
16-boat competition.
In the women's division, juniors Buffy Wendt and
junior Evans combined to take second place behind a
team from UC-Santa Cruz. Sophomore D.J. Bernstein and
junior Gina Ottobani followed close behind in third,
while sophomores Karen Holland Amy Baltzer rounded
out the impressive Stanford women's team performance
with a fourth-place finish in the 12-boat division.
' We could have done even better, but the lack of wind
was frustrating, and there weren't really enough races to
make it a real regatta, Wendt said.
The regatta was held at Stanford's home field, the turn
ing basin off Seaport Boulevard in Redwood City. Ac
cording to team members, the peculiar nature of the
area gave them a slight advantage.
"There was a definite advantage to sailing at home, es
pecially in light wind, because we had a better chance at
guessing the wind shifts,'' Smith said.
