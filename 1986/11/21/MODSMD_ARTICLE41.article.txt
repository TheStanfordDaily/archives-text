# Sack-leader Weber a pleasant surprise
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
After making a name for himself as
Stanford's leading quarterback tackier
with six-and-a-half sacks this season,
outside linebacker Chris Weber
believes he has fulfilled his potential.
"It's been a great year," Weber said.
"We've had great success in defense.
We've been accepted at the Gator
Bowl. We're playing together. We're
getting our confidence, and we're
learning to execute without mistakes.
The senior, whose strength lies not
just in his sacking ability but also in his
general pass rushing skills, has been an
influential force for the team.
"Chris has been very productive;
he's played as well as any outside
linebacker in the league, and there are
some really good ones he's up
against," said Stanford linebacker
coach Larry Kerr, who has been coach
ing on the Farm since 1983, Weber's
freshman year.
Weber began his Stanford career as
a special teams member, and unlike
most players, he never redshirted. He
has played all four seasons, but it was
not until this year that he became a
regular starter.
Stanford linebacker coach Jack Gil
mete sees Weber as the Cardinal's
surprise player of the season. "Chris
has played better than any of us ex
pected. There is no doubt in my mind
that he deserves All-Pac-10 honors,"
Gilmete said.
Weber is third on the team in tackles
with 65, which he attributed to an ag
gressiveness that he learned at Stan
ford. "It took me about a year to get the
right attitude. You have to get mean,
more aggressive, more physical. You
can't really like the person across from
you," he said.
Weber found other difficulties in ad
justing to college football. "It's hard
coming into the program. It's a tough
transition (from high school)," said
Weber, who is from Novato High
School in Northern California.
Balancing academics with football
has been a main focus for Weber, who
will come back to school next year to

finish his undergraduate degree in or
ganizational sociology. "Football is
pretty time-consuming,'' he said. "It's
hard to compete with other students
who aren't out playing football."
Kerr sees football more as a five-unit
course than as a sport. "The demands
on the players are tremendous. They
put in hours and hours in practice. It's

really a mental and physical wearing
on them," he said.
Weber's improvement over the four
years is proof that he has worked hard
in both academics and football, Kerr
said. "Weber has met the challenge. He
has been really motivated both in the
classroom and on the field."
This season, Weber's last, has been

his strongest. "Being a senior, it meant
a lot to he a starter for Chris," Kerr
said. "He's really blossomed under
what we're doing with the defense.
He's become more disciplined, more
experienced; he's developed consis
tency."
Gilmete sees Weber as an unconven
tional player whose ability to surprise

quarterbacks with his balance has
made him a forceful player. "Chris is a
tough guy to block. He'll do weird
things on big plays — sort of unortho
dox," he said.
Weber has also brought a sense of
humor and what Gilmete calls a
"young-acting, goofy attitude. He's
amazing; he does a great job. But he's

not a strong kid. It's amazing to see
how he does what he does with what
he has.'
During the 28-23 upset of UCLA on
Nov. 8, Weber was able to use his bal
ance and pass-rushing ability to make
some key plays. "Chris played a major
role against UCLA, Gilmete said. It
was his elusiveness and the fact that he
fought better than anyone to be right
there in the quarterback's face.'
In past seasons, Weber has been a
skilled player, making big plays, but his
errors and inconsistency kept him
from starting. "We knew that Chris was
a really good athlete and that he had
the talent," Kerr said. "Over the last
year, his consistency has improved. In
the UCLA game, he was the key reason
for the (Toi Cook) interception that led
to a touchdown."
Weber hopes to continue his consis
tency when playing against California
tomorrow. Growing up in the Bay
Area, the rivalry is ingrained in him.
"It's not too tough to get fired up.
We're going to score as many points
out there as we can,"' he said.
"Chris will be causing some fits (on
Saturday)," Gilmete said.
As for future plans, Weber has not
decided what he will be doing. "I'm
not really concerned with immediate
plans. Maybe I'll play around, maybe
I'll get into the business world. I'd love
to help out next year with the team. 1
have a lot of friends who would get a
big laugh seeing me in coaching gear,'"
said Weber, who will have two more
quarters of school to finish after this
year.
"I probably would have had more
time to spend in the classroom if I
hadn't played football," Weber added.
"But I love it. I'd be right back here on
the grass if I had to do it over."
Kerr sees professional football as a
possibility for Weber. "1 know some
pro scouts that are interested in Chris.
Fro ball is definitely an avenue open
for him," he said.
"I've learned a lot playing football —
the value of competition, the benefits
of hard work — and I've made some
really good friends," Weber said. "It's a
lot more than just football."

you," he said.
Weber found other difficulties in ad
justing to college football. "It's hard
coming into the program. It's a tough
transition (from high school)," said
Weber, who is from Novato High
School in Northern California.
Balancing academics with football
has been a main focus for Weber, who
will come back to school next year to

finish his undergraduate degree in or
ganizational sociology. "Football is
pretty time-consuming,'' he said. "It's
hard to compete with other students
who aren't out playing football."
Kerr sees football more as a five-unit
course than as a sport. "The demands
on the players are tremendous. They
put in hours and hours in practice. It's

really a mental and physical wearing
on them," he said.
Weber's improvement over the four
years is proof that he has worked hard
in both academics and football, Kerr
said. "Weber has met the challenge. He
has been really motivated both in the
classroom and on the field."
This season, Weber's last, has been

his strongest. "Being a senior, it meant
a lot to he a starter for Chris," Kerr
said. "He's really blossomed under
what we're doing with the defense.
He's become more disciplined, more
experienced; he's developed consis
tency."
Gilmete sees Weber as an unconven
tional player whose ability to surprise

quarterbacks with his balance has
made him a forceful player. "Chris is a
tough guy to block. He'll do weird
things on big plays — sort of unortho
dox," he said.
Weber has also brought a sense of
humor and what Gilmete calls a
"young-acting, goofy attitude. He's
amazing; he does a great job. But he's

not a strong kid. It's amazing to see
how he does what he does with what
he has.'
During the 28-23 upset of UCLA on
Nov. 8, Weber was able to use his bal
ance and pass-rushing ability to make
some key plays. "Chris played a major
role against UCLA, Gilmete said. It
was his elusiveness and the fact that he
fought better than anyone to be right
there in the quarterback's face.'
In past seasons, Weber has been a
skilled player, making big plays, but his
errors and inconsistency kept him
from starting. "We knew that Chris was
a really good athlete and that he had
the talent," Kerr said. "Over the last
year, his consistency has improved. In
the UCLA game, he was the key reason
for the (Toi Cook) interception that led
to a touchdown."
Weber hopes to continue his consis
tency when playing against California
tomorrow. Growing up in the Bay
Area, the rivalry is ingrained in him.
"It's not too tough to get fired up.
We're going to score as many points
out there as we can,"' he said.
"Chris will be causing some fits (on
Saturday)," Gilmete said.
As for future plans, Weber has not
decided what he will be doing. "I'm
not really concerned with immediate
plans. Maybe I'll play around, maybe
I'll get into the business world. I'd love
to help out next year with the team. 1
have a lot of friends who would get a
big laugh seeing me in coaching gear,'"
said Weber, who will have two more
quarters of school to finish after this
year.
"I probably would have had more
time to spend in the classroom if I
hadn't played football," Weber added.
"But I love it. I'd be right back here on
the grass if I had to do it over."
Kerr sees professional football as a
possibility for Weber. "1 know some
pro scouts that are interested in Chris.
Fro ball is definitely an avenue open
for him," he said.
"I've learned a lot playing football —
the value of competition, the benefits
of hard work — and I've made some
really good friends," Weber said. "It's a
lot more than just football."

Outside linebacker Chris Weber (98) is enjoying his best year at Stanford this senior honors candidate is also third on the team in tackles with 65 and has

After making a name for himself as
Stanford's leading quarterback tackier
with six-and-a-half sacks this season,
outside linebacker Chris Weber
believes he has fulfilled his potential.
"It's been a great year," Weber said.
"We've had great success in defense.
We've been accepted at the Gator
Bowl. We're playing together. We're
getting our confidence, and we're
learning to execute without mistakes.
The senior, whose strength lies not
just in his sacking ability but also in his
general pass rushing skills, has been an
influential force for the team.
"Chris has been very productive;
he's played as well as any outside
linebacker in the league, and there are
some really good ones he's up
against," said Stanford linebacker
coach Larry Kerr, who has been coach
ing on the Farm since 1983, Weber's
freshman year.
Weber began his Stanford career as
a special teams member, and unlike
most players, he never redshirted. He
has played all four seasons, but it was
not until this year that he became a
regular starter.
Stanford linebacker coach Jack Gil
mete sees Weber as the Cardinal's
surprise player of the season. "Chris
has played better than any of us ex
pected. There is no doubt in my mind
that he deserves All-Pac-10 honors,"
Gilmete said.
Weber is third on the team in tackles
with 65, which he attributed to an ag
gressiveness that he learned at Stan
ford. "It took me about a year to get the
right attitude. You have to get mean,
more aggressive, more physical. You
can't really like the person across from
you," he said.
Weber found other difficulties in ad
justing to college football. "It's hard
coming into the program. It's a tough
