# Seniors Fontana, Hahner share leadership duties
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Though Chinese philosophy may seem to
tally unrelated to Stanford women's volley
ball, the union of Yin and Yang pretty ac
curately describes the bond between Barbra
Fontana and Brooke Hahner, the two co
captains of the team and two individuals who
are distinctive yet very similar and very close.
From a purely statistical, factual perspec
tive, the two seniors would seem to be worlds
apart. After all, Hahner is a 5-foot-11 right-side
hitter who is noted for her powerful hitting,
while Fontana, a 5-foot-6 left-side hitter,
remains one of the strongest defensive
players in collegiate volleyball.
"Barb is steady and consistent, and does the
little things that often don't get noticed by the
average fan," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"Brooke is more noticeable with a big hit or a
big block."
Their volleyball backgrounds are as differ
ent as their playing styles. Fontana has been
playing volleyball for 10 years, whereas Hah
ner started relatively late by collegiate stand
ards.
"Where I'm from (Manhattan Beach), vol
leyball is the sport that everyone plays," Fon
tana said. "I played on the beach with my
friends."
In seventh grade, she joined the team in
her junior high school and continued through
high school. "I started for fun, then it got com
petitive," she said.
Hahner started the game in her sophomore
year in high school, when Fontana was
already rising to prominence on her Mira

Costa High School team. Hahner's reason for
picking up the sport is somewhat unusual. "I
started to play so I didn't have to play basket
ball in college,'' she said.
"Freshman year (at Esperanza High
School), I didn't make the (volleyball) team,"
she remembered, "but the coach said that 1
want you to play next year because you have a
lot of potential. She coached me, and the next
year 1 started tin the varsity team."
Both Fontana and Hahner were recruited
by a number of colleges, but each chose Stan
ford without reservation. The reason: the edu
cation.
"There's a better balance between volley
ball and academics (at Stanford) than
anywhere else," 1 Jahner said.
Fontana concurred. "This was my number
one choice. If I didn't get in here, I would
have gone to Berkeley. I wanted to get a good
education, so I would have sacrificed volley
ball for education.
"What I planned to do with my volleyball
was get an education," Fontana added, saying
that Olympic competition is not in the picture
for her and has not been one of her goals.
"Other things in life are more important. I
don't want to live the life of an athlete."
Hahner's initial ambitions were quite the
opposite. "I used to have higher aspirations in
volleyball," she said. Consequently, she
looked at schools like the University of the
Pacific and USC.
"The coach at HOP was good — now he's
the Olympic coach — and the coach at USC
has trained good volleyball players.
"I considered programs where volleyball
was the top priority," Hahner added, "and

decided that this wasn't a good balance,
though the training would have been more
intense."
Hahner has no regrets about her decision.
"The reasons I'm here now are right," she
said. "It's not the ultimate for me to play on
the Olympic team."
"I'm happy with my choice," Fontana
agreed. "My reasons are still right on the
head. This was the best choice, and I wouldn't
trade it for anything in the world."
Fontana and Hahner's spirit carries over
into the volleyball program and their perfor
mance as co-captains.
"Both are very caring and positive people,"
setter Wendi Rush said. "They're concerned
with the whole welfare of the team and the
well-being of every individual as well as the
group."
As for any division of responsibilities, it is
virtually impossible to separate Fontana's in
put from Hahner's. They are complementary.
"They work out well that way," Shaw said.
"They both add a lot to the team," Rush
said. "Barbra may add a little more leadership
on the court, and more people look to her
there." Rush attributed this to the fact that
"Barb has had more playing time."
Trying to find Hahner and Fontana's inter
ests outside of volleyball is a difficult task.
"They're more complex than meets the eye,"
Shaw said. "If you don't really know them, it's
hard to figure what they're like."
In fact, neither Fonatna nor Hahner could
come up with any specific interests apart from
volleyball. "I don't collect stamps or shells or
anything, Hahner said, to which Fontana
added, "Volleyball is my hobby now."
