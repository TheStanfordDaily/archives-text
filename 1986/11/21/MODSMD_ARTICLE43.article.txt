# Athletic Dept. invades Greek ranks
## 
### 
Well, it's Big Game. And that means
the end of another season of the Greek
of the Week.
Wrong. Not this year. Thanks to the
tremendous success being enjoyed by
the soon-to-be 8-2 Stanford Cardinal,
not only will we run The Greek next
week for the Coca-Cola Bowl in Tokyo
against Arizona (which really isn't a
bowl at all), but in the Dead Week
Daily, we will have the Greeks pick
winners of all 18 Division I-A bowl
games.
A reminder as well that today is the
last day to submit entries for the Be the
Guest Greek contest. Space limitations
present us from running the entry
blank again, but we will accept any
legible sheet of paper with your name,
address and phone number, along
with the winners of the 10 games selec
ted here and the score of Big Game.
Because this is Big Game, we have
two Guest Greeks for this week. The
first, is Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
and the other isn't. Actually, it's Sports
Information Director Bob "Bevo" Vaz
quez.
Geiger is coming off a busy week,
dealing with Gator Bowl bids and Stan

ford Band kids, but he found time to
return our call and offer an insider's
view of this week's top 10 games.
Geiger picked Stanford in an easy
31-10 victory. "Stanford will continue
its intense, dominant plav," he said. He
also picked Pennsylvania, his former
employer, to beat Cornell for its fifth
straight Ivy League championship.
Vazquez, who together with Steve
"Stevo" Raczynski and Gary Migdol
provides the latest scores, statistics and
other relevent news to the Peninsula's
largest morning paper as well as the
Bay Area, California and national
media, echoed Tony Leiker's predic
tion of a shutout in a 35-0 Stanford win.
The San Diego State graduate, who
spoke last week in Kresge on the role
of minorities in the media, had the au
dience rolling at the Guardsmen's Big
Game luncheon in San Francisco on
Wednesday, displaying a little-seen
sense of humor.
Band manager Jeff Stevens went 5-5
despite the turmoil that surrounded
the incomparable LSJUMB last week.
Ties by Clemson at Maryland and UCLA
at Washington hurt all the Greeks be
cause they are counted as losses.

Well, it's Big Game. And that means
the end of another season of the Greek
of the Week.
Wrong. Not this year. Thanks to the
tremendous success being enjoyed by
the soon-to-be 8-2 Stanford Cardinal,
not only will we run The Greek next
week for the Coca-Cola Bowl in Tokyo
against Arizona (which really isn't a
bowl at all), but in the Dead Week
Daily, we will have the Greeks pick
winners of all 18 Division I-A bowl
games.
A reminder as well that today is the
last day to submit entries for the Be the
Guest Greek contest. Space limitations
present us from running the entry
blank again, but we will accept any
legible sheet of paper with your name,
address and phone number, along
with the winners of the 10 games selec
ted here and the score of Big Game.
Because this is Big Game, we have
two Guest Greeks for this week. The
first, is Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
and the other isn't. Actually, it's Sports
Information Director Bob "Bevo" Vaz
quez.
Geiger is coming off a busy week,
dealing with Gator Bowl bids and Stan

ford Band kids, but he found time to
return our call and offer an insider's
view of this week's top 10 games.
Geiger picked Stanford in an easy
31-10 victory. "Stanford will continue
its intense, dominant plav," he said. He
also picked Pennsylvania, his former
employer, to beat Cornell for its fifth
straight Ivy League championship.
Vazquez, who together with Steve
"Stevo" Raczynski and Gary Migdol
provides the latest scores, statistics and
other relevent news to the Peninsula's
largest morning paper as well as the
Bay Area, California and national
media, echoed Tony Leiker's predic
tion of a shutout in a 35-0 Stanford win.
The San Diego State graduate, who
spoke last week in Kresge on the role
of minorities in the media, had the au
dience rolling at the Guardsmen's Big
Game luncheon in San Francisco on
Wednesday, displaying a little-seen
sense of humor.
Band manager Jeff Stevens went 5-5
despite the turmoil that surrounded
the incomparable LSJUMB last week.
Ties by Clemson at Maryland and UCLA
at Washington hurt all the Greeks be
cause they are counted as losses.
