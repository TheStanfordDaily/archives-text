Victoria Emmons serves traditional gourmet food. Tradi
tion with a twist. Tradition that breaks all the rules. In that
sense, not tradition at all.
The most expectation-defying factor of her business is its
location. To put a gourmet restaurant in midtown Palo Alto
among Baskin Robbins, Bergmans Department Store and
Scherba's Auto Supply is not merely a business risk, but a
calculated statement of confidence. Victoria Emmons is not
just in midtown, she's in the back of a midtown parking lot
— hidden.
She knows she's special. She's catered for Queen
Elizabeth; Prince Philip and Francois Mitterand have dined
in midtown. Her locale lays the psychological groundwork
for those who find her to exaggerate the significance of
their find.
However, once you've found her, confidence and security
are restored by the hints of tradition throughout her design.
Her scheme is soft and womanly. Pink and brass. Dried and
live plants. Teak furniture and Oriental details (wall han
gings, planter pots, flatware and wood-carved partitions).
The service is traditional and formidable — black-and-white
obedience.
The menu is eclectic, eclectically eclectic. It's Franco-
Italo-Anglo-Americano-Oriental. Our appetizers, Franco-

Italo, were excellent. The carpaccio ($4.95) was sliced trans
lucently thin (that's good). The light glaze of seasoning and
mayonnaisey dressing added spark to the smooth beef
flavor.
The Buckwheat Crepe with apple and brie ($4.95) was
beautiful — tastefully and visually. Melted brie with sharp
slices of apple wrapped in a dainty but wholesome crepe.
Sweet, strong, warm, tart: sensual.
The house salad ($2.50) was big and bouncy. The key fac
tor is King Kong mushrooms — huge in form and flavor —
bedded in large leaves of fresh lettuce and topped with a
zesty rich vinaigrette. The vegetable soup ($2.00) is a
julienne garden. What ho! Another salad in spiced broth
that's somewhere this side of memorable.
Our main courses were high quality'. Luscious tender rare
lamb, drowned in "Chinese-style" barbecue sauce ($14.95),
which means coarse mustard and soy sauce. Our other dish
was Veal Medallions with Wild Mushrooms ($16.95): tender
young succulent veal, lovely in texture but slightly
dominated by the taste of those wild mushrooms. This is
lighter than the lamb, but still traditionally French in the
rich fullness de la sauce brurie.
Oh, how a sweet last course can wipe away a bit of
cynicism, criticism, pessimism and poverty, even if it's just
until the caffeine lets go. The carrot cake ($3-75) was light
and happy and small. Sweet and satisfying, it resolved one
meal. The Queen of Sheba Cake ($3-75) is traditionally
European: dark chocolate punctuated by hazelnut crunch.
Victoria Emmons' fine restaurant is just the place to wine
and dine your visiting parents, your sweetheart on his/her
Christmas formal or any royal relatives that happen to be in
town.
