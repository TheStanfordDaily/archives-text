This time "Sophie's Choice" has ab
solutely nothing to do with anti-
Semitism, genocide, scurvy, anorexia
or manic depression. Fortunate for us.
Neither is it just a cutesy name for a
new restaurant Californien-Francais on
Emerson next to the Bijou.
Sophie's Choice is a collage of com
plex turns of fate, acts of God and acts
of free will, all working together to
bring Palo Alto one of its very finest
gourmet kitchens.
As in the novel, Sophie's Choice is
based on a complicated interplay of
personality and history. In this case the
name has to do with Sophie de
L'Horme's decision to sell her smash
success Alouette about six years ago. It
has to do with her opening and closing
of A la Carte, where the Thai Orchid
now sits.
Sophie opted to become a pan of
this neighborhood that borrows its
character from design studios, antique
shops, the artsy Bijou, Le Meursault, St.
Michael's Alley, some old art deco
esque cleaners and dairies, and some
quaint old-style Northern Californian
homes.
Sophie is a dynamic businesswoman
in touch with the purely artistic side of
food preparation and customer ser
vice. Daily buyer and menu planner,
she waits to see what's fresh before she
handwrites her choice on a plate that
she props on each table when she seats
you, personally and personably.
Amiably attractive and fashionable,
she is supervisor of affairs and
Maitresse d'Hotel. Though her accent
is thick French, we could not resist the
comparison to Meryl Streep/Sophie's

exotic charm.
Our choice for appetizer was Pate
Champenoise, a crude melee spiced
heavily with peppercorns. Smeared on
a baguette slice and taken with a sip of
wine, it tasted pleasantly French.
The soup was Butter Nut Squash; it
was heavy on the butter, very yellow
and very rich. Saving our arteries for
the rest of the meal, we moved on to
the salad, which refreshed us with
large green leaves laced in a lime and
orange vinaigrette.
Having painfully chosen two dishes
from Sophie's tantalizing plate of
entrees, we anticipated the main
course. A steaming bowl of fresh pasta
arrived, surrounded by a circle of
steamed clams and mussels still in the
shell.
The pile of pasta was composed of
very thin, delicate noodles colored
both red and white, which — basted in
a mollusk-juice-and-garlic butter —
melted on the tongue.
The next dish, a picquant Louisana
red fish blackened Cajun style, was far
less soothing. The fish was thickly cut
with a taste strong enough to withstand
both the Cajun spices and the hot skil
let in which it was fried.
The flavor can only be described as
dark, sharp and brown with tinges of
red. This dish, which is riding out its
vogue in the culinary world, was very
successful and thoroughly enjoyed.
And, to finally top off a masterful
meal, Sophie's sweets. We chose only
one, feeling a little gustatorially
fatigued. One was surely enough. The
Sacher Tone stood between us glisten
ing in the candlelight.
The chef employed that devastating
mixture: dark chocolate and raspberry.
The cake was moist with thick, rich
frosting and layers of raspberry
entwined throughout.
With coffee to end, it was really fine.
We thanked Sophie for sharing her
Choice with us and walked slowly with
silly, sated smiles on our faces.
