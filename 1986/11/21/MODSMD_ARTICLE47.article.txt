# CIR reports on black views

Most influential black leaders and political groups in
South Africa favor the withdrawal of foreign corporations
from South Africa, hut polls surveying South African
blacks can support various interpretations, according to
a report compiled by the University's Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR).
However, the report says,"The well-considered views
of black leaders, including the leadership of the national
black organizations ... probably have more significance
than the results of black opinion surveys."
I he discussion paper, titled "What Do Black South
Africans Want Us to Do?," is the ClR's second in a four
part series on South Africa. (The full text of the paper
begins on page 3 of today's Daily.)
A critical element in any decision on the question of
disinvestment must be the preference of those in whose
interests an end to apartheid is sought," it says.
Among black political groups and black leaders, the
< ii< report finds only Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, chief mini
ster of the Kwa-Zulu homeland, to be in favor of in-

creased investment by foreign companies.
But Buthelezi is considered by many blacks to have
"sold out" to the South African government, according to
the report.
Interpretation of the public opinion polls is
problematical. As the report states: "Given the enormous
differences in wording and polling methodologies of the
various surveys conducted to date, it is impossible to
arrive at many foolproof conclusions about African senti
ment toward sanctions and/or disinvestment."
Political Science Prof. Richard Brody analyzed the
same reports earlier this year and presented his findings
to University President Donald Kennedy.
According to Brody, "It is likely that before the state of
emergency was imposed this past spring, about 25 to 30
percent of urban black South Africans supported disin
vestment and other forms of foreign economic sanctions.
My guess, hopefully educated, is that the state of
emergency — and all that has transpired in its wake —
has contributed to the vast increase in the willingness of
urban black South Africans to approve of sanctions, even
at the cost of personal sacrifice."
