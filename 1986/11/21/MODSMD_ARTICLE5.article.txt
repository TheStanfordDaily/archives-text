# Fac Sen wants say in Reagan Library
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
The use of the Ronald Reagan Presi
dential Library should be limited to
primarily scholarly activities related to
the archival collection of the library,
according to a motion passed yester
day by the Faculty Senate.
The motion, proposed by Philoso
phy Prof. Michael Bratman at a special
senate session on the library, also
called for substantial faculty represen
tation in future decisions about the use
of library facilities.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz cast
the one dissenting vote against the mo
tion, saying that, because the motion
allows for use of the facility for activi
ties not related to the archival function
of the library, the new wording could
allow the Ronald Reagan Foundation
and the Hoover Institution to dictate
the use of the facility.
Before the motion was proposed,
Rebholz charged that, without the
knowledge of the faculty, "a miniature
version of a public affairs center" will
be instituted at the Reagan Library.
Citing a 1983 Board of Trustees
resolution that approved the library in
"affiliation with the Hoover Institution
and under the provision of applicable
Federal law," Rebholz said the Reagan
Library's scheduling of conferences
will be controlled by the Hoover Insti
tution.
According to Rebholz, the Ronald
Reagan Foundation is directly linked to
the Hoover Institution and has raised
$33 million for the library' and $77 mil
lion for a public affairs center. As fur
ther support for his claims, Rebholz
noted that W. Glenn Campbell, direc
tor of the Hoover Institution, is head of
the Ronald Reagan Foundation and
Martin Anderson, a senior Hoover fel
low, is treasurer for the foundation.
University President Donald Ken
nedy denied Rebholz's allegations,
saying: "The library, as you know, is
owned and operated by the United
States government. The person re

sponsible for it reports to the archivist
of the United States."
As to the scheduling of conferences
at the facility, Kennedy said: "There is
no particular inside track with respect
to the Hoover Institution."
The library will be linked to the Uni
versity library system through the
Hoover library, Kennedy said, because
of the high quality of Hoover's archival
collection.
Rebholz said the Reagan Library
facility is not analogous to other presi
dential libraries such as the Lyndon
Johnson library at the University of
Texas or the Gerald Ford library at the
University of Michigan, because "these
libraries are not run in affiliation with a
think tank like Hoover."
Kennedy, however, responded that
the planning committee for the Reagan
Library was influenced in its decisions
by the structures of the Ford and
Johnson libraries. During visits to the
two libraries, the committee "found a
good working cooperation between
the university faculty and archivists at
those libraries."
Kennedy, in a jest over being
severely questioned by the senate in
the last week over South Africa and the
Reagan Library, brought out a Stanford
football helmet and jersey during his
opening remarks.
John Schwartz, vice president and
general counsel, said both the Univer
sity and the Ronald Reagan Foundation
want a substantial role in the
governance of the library.
"And that's what negotiation is for,"
he told the senate. "I can only tell you,
we intend to provide the kind of con
trols you're all concerned about."
Schwartz said the library will be
built with the approval of three agree
ments signed by three parties â€” Stan
ford, the U.S. government and the
Reagan Foundation.
In other matters, University Planning
Director Phil Williams said the library
will probably not be finished in time to
