### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Stating that reading newspapers is "an en
dangered skill. William Randolph Hearst
111. editor and publisher of the San Fran
cisco Examiner, said yesterday that
newspapers have the responsibility to edu
cate their readership.
"There's now a new reality (in the news
paper business). You've got to create a
paper to educate. You have to be a little
more serious and careful," Hearst told a
Communication 1 class.
Hearst, grandson of the late newspaper
baron William Randolph Hearst and a mem
ber of a family whose ownings in publica
tions branch across the United States, said
the Examiner is focused somewhat on the

upper-middle-class people in the area. "We
are looking for the educated reader, ' he
said, adding that "there is the risk factor that
you could wander off into 'yuppie' con
cerns."
Hearst opened the conversation by dis
cussing what he called an "explosion" in the
different areas of communication. "New
frontiers that are getting mixed reactions,
some successful, some that are kind of fail
ures. are opening up. he said.
Although his grandfather was a leading
"yellow" journalist around the turn of the
century, Hearst said he to avoid sen
sationalizing the news.
"I'm cautious about sensationalism. Vie
ask ourselves: Are we going to magnify the
whole problem by running the story? But
we reallv don't want to get into the business

of deciding what people should and
shouldn't know. We can't put ourselves in
the position of the government," he said.
Hearst said he is trying to develop a trust
between the Examiner and its readers.
We're trying to build up a loyalty, build up
the habit so that people can say, That's my
paper. I buy it everyday.'"
He stressed the importance of having a
policy for decision making. "News affects a
large number of people, so we're constantly
making decisons."
According to Hearst, the Examiner has
developed an "interesting test to deter
mine what will run in the paper. "We ask
which stories are news, which stories are
unusual and which stories will cause
ripples. Our polio 1 is, if you've got it, run
it.'"

Since Hearst's takeover of the Examiner
in 1984, the paper has expanded its
primarily community focus to include the
arts, fashion, political issues, business and
foreign events.
' We've tried to make a few changes. Some
people seem to think we've succeeded, he
said.
Although his publications run advertise
ments suggesting that ' Ken and Barbie"
dolls would he successful co-anchors on
television news, Hearst admitted that
"advertisements can only be described as
cheap shots."
Hearst, however, regards newspapers
very differently than he does other media
forms. "We spoof advertising in our publica-
tions, but newspapers hardly exist without the entity of ad
vertising," he said.
His sometimes controversial career as a publisher began
as reporter and photographer for the Examiner. "I worked
on the opinion editorial page and the city page, so now I
feel I know this paper," Hearst said.
Before taking over the Examiner, Hearst worked for the
area magazine Outside. "The transition between magazine
and newspaper was much bigger than I thought," Hearst
said.
He then became involved with the Hearst company's
drive to acquire newspapers across the country. When it
bought the Examiner, Hearst became the editor and pub
lisher.
Since the takeover of the Examiner, the Hearst family has
been criticized for its control in the publication field. "We
can't really justify it in the moral sense, only that most
newspapers are owned by a chain or by a family," Hearst
said. "I've found that family businesses are incredibly badly
run, crazy inefficiencies. But when the paper goes to the
corporation, then the people who run the paper live in a dif
ferent city. The paper becomes a little more faceless."
Hearst concluded by agreeing with the checks and
balances system in the broadcasting field. "The restriction
on ownership of broadcasting companies is a good thing."
