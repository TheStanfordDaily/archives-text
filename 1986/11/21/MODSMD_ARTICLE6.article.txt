Stating that reading newspapers is "an en
dangered skill. William Randolph Hearst
111. editor and publisher of the San Fran
cisco Examiner, said yesterday that
newspapers have the responsibility to edu
cate their readership.
"There's now a new reality (in the news
paper business). You've got to create a
paper to educate. You have to be a little
more serious and careful," Hearst told a
Communication 1 class.
Hearst, grandson of the late newspaper
baron William Randolph Hearst and a mem
ber of a family whose ownings in publica
tions branch across the United States, said
the Examiner is focused somewhat on the

upper-middle-class people in the area. "We
are looking for the educated reader, ' he
said, adding that "there is the risk factor that
you could wander off into 'yuppie' con
cerns."
Hearst opened the conversation by dis
cussing what he called an "explosion" in the
different areas of communication. "New
frontiers that are getting mixed reactions,
some successful, some that are kind of fail

We're trying to build up a loyalty, build up

paper. I buy it everyday.'"
He stressed the importance of having a
policy for decision making. "News affects a
large number of people, so we're constantly
making decisons."
According to Hearst, the Examiner has
developed an "interesting test to deter
mine what will run in the paper. "We ask
which stories are news, which stories are
unusual and which stories will cause
ripples. Our polio 1 is, if you've got it, run
it.'"

Since Hearst's takeover of the Examiner
in 1984, the paper has expanded its
primarily community focus to include the
arts, fashion, political issues, business and
foreign events.
' We've tried to make a few changes. Some
people seem to think we've succeeded, he
said.
Although his publications run advertise
ments suggesting that ' Ken and Barbie"
dolls would he successful co-anchors on
television news, Hearst admitted that
"advertisements can only be described as
cheap shots."
Hearst, however, regards newspapers
very differently than he does other media
forms. "We spoof advertising in our publica-
