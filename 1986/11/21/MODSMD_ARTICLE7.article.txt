Khomeini criticizes Reagan
TEHRAN, Iran — Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, launching
a blistering attack on President Reagan and his policies, said yesterday that
The U.S. president should mourn over this great scandal and the White
House should be turned into a black house."
The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Khomeini's
remarks, which apparently referred to Reagan's decision to ship arms to
Iran in a bid to establish links with Tehran moderates and secure the
release of American hostages.
Khomeini asserted that the storm that had blown up over the disclosures
of the U.S. arms shipments represented "a huge explosion at the black
house," one which the American media was trying to cover up.
Khomeini said those governments who had severed ties with Iran were
now begging the Iranian nation for a resumption of relations. "But our na
tion does not accept it, and this is greater (for us) than all your (America's)
achievements."
Congress re-elects its leadership
WASHINGTON — The Senate's victorious Democrats and vanquished
Republicans yesterday re-elected their leadership, including Robert Byrd
(D-W.Va.) as majority leader and Robert Dole (R-Kan.) as minority leader,
as Democrats moved to take the offensive from an embattled White House
in the Democratic-controlled 100 th Congress.
Gathering for the first time since Democrats recaptured control of the
Senate in the Nov. 4 elections, Republicans scrambled to draw the curtain
on the uproar over administration-sanctioned arms shipments to Iran,
while Democrats asserted that President Reagan's credibility has been
seriously eroded by his handling of the controversy.
Rather than following the normal pattern of assembling for opening for
malities in early January, then recessing until the State of the Union Ad
dress, which has been scheduled for Jan. 27, the Senate will stay on the job
from the start, Byrd said. "We are in the majority, and we are ready to do
business," he added.
Democrats vowed to set their agenda rather than waiting for Reagan to
act, starting with immediate action in early January to again pass clean
water legislation that Reagan vetoed. They predicted defeats for the presi
dent on such high-stakes issues as defense spending and aid to the
Nicaraguan contras.
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who is in line to head the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said the Pentagon will be lucky to keep pace with in
flation next year and could face cutbacks of up to $60 billion in spending
authority unless the president agrees to a budget compromise that in
cludes tax increases.
In yesterday's leadership elections, none of the current party leaders was
challenged despite the upheaval at the polls that ended the Republicans'
six-year dominance of the Senate and returned the Democrats to control,
55 to 45.
The contest between Sens. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.) for ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
was left to be resolved when the committee is reconstituted, possibly not
until January. Elected with Byrd by the Democrats was Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) as assistant party leader and Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-
Hawaii) as head of the party conference, or caucus. Sen. George Mitchell
(D-Maine), who was the Democratic campaign chairman for last fall's elec
tion, was elected deputy president pro tempore, which has not been filled
since it was created a decade ago for the late Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-
Minn.). Sen. John Stennis (D-Mlss.), the senior Democrat, will be president
pro tempore in the 100 th Congress.
Slain labor leader mourned
MANILA, Philippines — More than 100,000 people marched for 10 hours
yesterday through downtown Manila to mourn last week's gangland-style
killing of labor leader Rolando Olalia and to tell President Corazon Aquino
that she cannot ignore the nation's radical left.
Many of the mourners also demanded the resignation of Mrs. Aquino's
controversial defense minister, Juan Ponce Enrile, who has been out
spoken in his criticism of government efforts to sign a cease-fire with com
munist insurgents.
It was the largest funeral procession in Manila since the 1983 mass out
pouring of sympathy for the president's slain husband, Benigno Aquino Jr.
Military authorities clearly were shaken by the size and makeup of yester
day's highly disciplined procession.
Among the marchers who followed the red flatbed truck bearing Olalia's
remains through 10 miles of city streets were thousands of troops of the
Communist New People's Army, whose rebellion, now in its 17th year, has
left thousands dead in the Philippine countryside since Aquino took office
last February.
The funeral march was the biggest show of strength by the communists
since their people's war began.
The mourners included such prominent leftists as Satur Ocampo and
Antonio Zumel, the two negotiators for the communist rebels in cease-fire
talks with the government. Both men were surrounded by a human secur
ity cordon of New People's Army regulars.
There was no violence. There were few tears, few signs of anger and
even fewer chants against imperialism and fascism.
Better Medicare coverage urged
WASHINGTON — Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen
yesterday proposed a $1.8 billion expansion of Medicare, various tax
breaks and other "options" aimed at increasing insurance protection for
those hit with catastrophic medical expenses.
The long-awaited proposals for filling gaps not now covered by
Medicare and private health insurance are expected to generate intense
controversy within the Reagan administration because in some cases they
would enlarge the federal deficit and replace private insurance.
Several key Democratic leaders in Congress, while saying that they think
the government should do much more than Bowen suggested, neverthe
less called the proposals a positive step and said they might give impetus to
far-reaching legislation.
In a 117-page report, Bowen listed numerous options that President
Reagan's domestic advisers will consider in shaping final recommen
dations.
FAA orders plane inspections
NEW YORK — The Federal Aviation Administration ordered yesterday
that most Lockheed L-101 Is be inspected after a 6-inch crack was found last
week inside the wing of a Delta plane following a "hard landing" in
Newark, N.J.
Between 90 and 100 of the 117 wide-body aircraft operating in the
United States would be affected by the order. Delta, which has the largest
fleet of L-101 Is with 35 planes, said yesterday that it had already completed
its inspections. "We found nothing," said a spokesman.
The FAA action followed a recommendation by the National Tranporta
tion Safety Board, the agency that investigates aircraft incidents, including
the one on Nov. 13 when Delta flight 194 from Atlanta made what the NTSB
described as a "hard landing."
The spar is the main structural support inside the wing. Made of alumi
num. it is like the girder of a building or bridge. It both supports the wing
and forms one wall of the fuel tank. Should a spar break during a flight it
could cause a crash. However, there are two spars in even- wing, and the
second could keep the plane aloft, the manufacturer said.
Lockheed issued a service bulletin to all airlines that operate the 1011s,
recommending the type of inspection that the FAA has ordered.
• A total of 250 1011s were built in Palmdale, Calif., from April 1972
through October 1983. It is being used by seven domestic operators, in
cluding Eastern Airlines, Trans World Airlines, United Airlines and Delta
Air Lines.
