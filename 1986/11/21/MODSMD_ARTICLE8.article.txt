# Reagan's advisers cast blame

### 
WASHINGTON — The clandestine shipments of
U.S. weapons to Iran have touched off a bitter round
of recriminations within the Reagan administration,
officials said yesterday. The president's most senior
advisers are casting blame at themselves and others
for what has become one of the most serious foreign
policy crises of the Reagan years.
White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, at a
senior staff meeting yesterday, responded angrily to a
statement by former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane, who went to Tehran on a mission for the
president, that it was a "mistake" to send weapons to
Iran.
According to officials who were present, Regan
said, "Let's not forget whose idea this was. It was
Bud's (McFarlane's) idea. When you give lousy ad
vice, you get lousy results."
McFarlane, in a statement issued yesterday, ap
peared to shift emphasis somewhat, taking more re
sponsibility for the Iran episode.
In an interview with The Washington Post pub
lished in yesterday's editions, he said that "it was a
mistake to introduce any element of arms transfers"
into dealings with Iran, but that he thought "it was a
sensible policy" to attempt to open a political
dialogue with people in Tehran. Sources close to
McFarlane quoted him as telling President Reagan
that it would be wrong to send arms to Iran, but the
president went ahead anyway.
Yesterday, McFarlane confirmed the statement he

made to The Post, but amplified it by saying the arms
shipments were a "mistake" because they created po
litical "turmoil" in the United States when they were
disclosed. He added, "As a senior adviser to the pres
ident, I should have anticipated this potential
outcome; the failure to do so represents a serious er
ror in judgement for which 1 accept full responsibil
ity."
Regan s outburst at McFarlane yesterday was the
latest in a round of second-guessing and increasingly
bitter criticism that has swept the White House since
the Iran operation was disclosed. "Everybody is run
ning from this thing," said a White House aide. "If
everyone thinks this was such a bad idea, who
brought it up with the president?"
There has been growing tension, in particular, be
tween the White House and the State Department.
Two informed sources said that Secretary of State
George Shultz telephoned Regan before Wednesday
night's news conference and urged that the president
say Shultz had been given control over U.S. antiter
rorism policy and future dealings with Iran.
However, the sources said, Regan refused, and the
president did not make such a statement in the news
conference. The president did, however, give a per
sonal vote of confidence to Shultz and said he was
not going to resign — signals that Shultz's aides at
the State Department took as a sign their man had
prevailed.
White House officials also said they were angry at

statements from the State Department that Shultz was
only "sporadically" informed of the Iran operation.
Presidential spokesman Larry Speakes said yesterday
that Shultz participated in two meetings in which the
operation was discussed and decided upon with the
president.
Meanwhile, public opinion surveys continued to
show yesterday that Reagan's public approval rating
has suffered in the aftermath of the Iran disclosures,
despite his explanations of them in a nationally
televised speech last week and at Wednesday's news
conference.
In an ABC News poll, taken immediately after the
news conference, 57 percent of those surveyed said
they approved of the way Reagan was handling his
job, a drop of 10 points since September. This was
the lowest level charted by ABC since May 1985 after
Reagan's controversial trip to the Bitburg military
cemetery in West Germany.
The poll showed that six in 10 of those questioned
said they believed Reagan is not telling the truth
about the Iran operation. It also showed overwhelm
ing opposition to sending arms to Iran, regardless of
the rationale, whether to win freedom for American
hostages in Lebanon or to influence the Iranian gov
ernment.
While Reagan has said he did not make an arms
for-hostages deal, the ABC survey showed that six in
10 people interviewed believe there was such a deal.
