# Wall Street lambasts SEC action
## 
### 
Wall Street reacted with outrage yes
terday to reports that the Securities
and Exchange Commission allowed
stock speculator Ivan Boesky to sell
more than $400 million of stocks of
takeover targets before it announced
the insider trading case against him
that sent stock prices plunging.
"The SEC has unwittingly aided one
of the largest insider trading scams in
history," said David Nolan, a chief
stock trader for Spear Leeds and Kel
logg. "We're still trading in the dark
because we don't know who's been
entrapped by Boesky and the SEC
The SEC should go about this in a
more savvy way and not allow Boesky
and his investors to get out early in the
market."
"It's a horror," said Richard Spring,
research director at 61 Associates, a
New York investment firm.
The SEC, aware that reports of
Boesky's trading set off a tumult on
Wall Street, said it had no comment on
the matter, possibly because the com
missioners had not agreed on a public
statement. Until yesterday's reports
that Boesky traded just prior to public
disclosure of the SEC charges against
him, many Wall Street professionals

had praised the SEC's handling of the
case.
Theodore Levine, one of Boesky's at
torneys, sought to play down the Wall
Street reaction. "I feel it is diversion of
attention which is not well-founded,"
he said. "Mr. Boesky has been conduct
ing his business in an appropriate way
at all times."
Legal sources said Boesky's trading
on advance information of the charges
against him protected investors who
have given him billions of dollars of
their money to manage. But a New
York attorney said late yesterday that
lawsuits are likely to be filed by those
who are angry that Boesky sold them
stocks, which plunged in price this
week after the $100 million case
against him was announced last Friday.
Legal sources said lawsuits also are
likely against those who profited from
Boesky's trading in recent years as in
vestors in funds he managed.
The first known class action suit
against Boesky and his operations was
filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan by Angelo Oriolo, a stock
holder who says he sold General
Foods Corp. stock without the benefit
of insider knowledge that Boesky pos
sessed. Oriolo sold 100 shares of Gen

eral Foods two months before the
stock price increased dramatically,
after the company announced it was
being acquired by Phillip Morris Cos.
Inc., the lawsuit says.
After the stock market closed last
Friday, the SEC charged Boesky with
using confidential information about
corporate takeover bids to make $50
million in illegal stock trading profits.
Because takeover bids typically cause
stock prices to rise sharply, Boesky was
able to make enormous profits trading
stocks on advance information. To set
tle the SEC charges, Boesky paid the
government $100 million and agreed
to plead guilty to one criminal charge.
Boesky's competitors — the large
and small speculators in stocks of
takeover targets, known as arbitrageurs
— suffered major losses earlier this
week as takeover stocks in their
portfolios plunged. There were
rumors that some smaller arbitrage
firms were forced out of business by
the decline.
The stocks plunged because the SEC
insider trading Case against Boesky was
followed by reports of grand jury sub
poenas of the Wall Street firm of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
some of its key employees. Drexel,

which recently helped Boesky raise
hundreds of millions of dollars to in
vest in stocks of takeover targets, was
in the midst of financing takeover bids
for the stocks that plunged.
Drexel, also named as a defendant in
the class action lawsuit filed against
Boesky, has been advised that neither
the firm nor its key employees who
received subpoenas are targets of a
criminal investigation. They may be
witnesses. While recipients of sub
poenas may be witnesses rather than
targets, the reports of Boesky's demise
and the subpoenas against Drexel
damaged confidence in the firm.
As Wall Street arbitrageurs fumed,
Boesky was at his offices working
Thursday. To minimize potential losses
by investors in Boesky-managed funds,
he is permitted to continue trading
while he dismantles his empire, with a
deadline of April 1, 1988.
"Is he selling? He's conducting trans
actions," said Gerald Rath, an attorney
with the Boston firm Bingham, Dana &
Gould, who was appointed by the SEC
to monitor Boesky s trading. Rath said
the goal is for Boesky to preserve the
assets of his enterprises while he extr
icates himself.

Wall Street reacted with outrage yes
terday to reports that the Securities
and Exchange Commission allowed
stock speculator Ivan Boesky to sell
more than $400 million of stocks of
takeover targets before it announced
the insider trading case against him
that sent stock prices plunging.
"The SEC has unwittingly aided one
of the largest insider trading scams in
history," said David Nolan, a chief
stock trader for Spear Leeds and Kel
logg. "We're still trading in the dark
because we don't know who's been
entrapped by Boesky and the SEC
The SEC should go about this in a
more savvy way and not allow Boesky
and his investors to get out early in the
market."
"It's a horror," said Richard Spring,
research director at 61 Associates, a
New York investment firm.
The SEC, aware that reports of
Boesky's trading set off a tumult on
Wall Street, said it had no comment on
the matter, possibly because the com
missioners had not agreed on a public
statement. Until yesterday's reports
that Boesky traded just prior to public
disclosure of the SEC charges against
him, many Wall Street professionals

had praised the SEC's handling of the
case.
Theodore Levine, one of Boesky's at
torneys, sought to play down the Wall
Street reaction. "I feel it is diversion of
attention which is not well-founded,"
he said. "Mr. Boesky has been conduct
ing his business in an appropriate way
at all times."
Legal sources said Boesky's trading
on advance information of the charges
against him protected investors who
have given him billions of dollars of
their money to manage. But a New
York attorney said late yesterday that
lawsuits are likely to be filed by those
who are angry that Boesky sold them
stocks, which plunged in price this
week after the $100 million case
against him was announced last Friday.
Legal sources said lawsuits also are
likely against those who profited from
Boesky's trading in recent years as in
vestors in funds he managed.
The first known class action suit
against Boesky and his operations was
filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan by Angelo Oriolo, a stock
holder who says he sold General
Foods Corp. stock without the benefit
of insider knowledge that Boesky pos
sessed. Oriolo sold 100 shares of Gen

eral Foods two months before the
stock price increased dramatically,
after the company announced it was
being acquired by Phillip Morris Cos.
Inc., the lawsuit says.
After the stock market closed last
Friday, the SEC charged Boesky with
using confidential information about
corporate takeover bids to make $50
million in illegal stock trading profits.
Because takeover bids typically cause
stock prices to rise sharply, Boesky was
able to make enormous profits trading
stocks on advance information. To set
tle the SEC charges, Boesky paid the
government $100 million and agreed
to plead guilty to one criminal charge.
Boesky's competitors — the large
and small speculators in stocks of
takeover targets, known as arbitrageurs
— suffered major losses earlier this
week as takeover stocks in their
portfolios plunged. There were
rumors that some smaller arbitrage
firms were forced out of business by
the decline.
The stocks plunged because the SEC
insider trading Case against Boesky was
followed by reports of grand jury sub
poenas of the Wall Street firm of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
some of its key employees. Drexel,

which recently helped Boesky raise
hundreds of millions of dollars to in
vest in stocks of takeover targets, was
in the midst of financing takeover bids
for the stocks that plunged.
Drexel, also named as a defendant in
the class action lawsuit filed against
Boesky, has been advised that neither
the firm nor its key employees who
received subpoenas are targets of a
criminal investigation. They may be
witnesses. While recipients of sub
poenas may be witnesses rather than
targets, the reports of Boesky's demise
and the subpoenas against Drexel
damaged confidence in the firm.

Boesky was at his offices working
