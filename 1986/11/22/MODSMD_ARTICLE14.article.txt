# Band makes its return
## 
### 
Well, we're back! First we disap
pointed them, and they said we'd
stay at home or buy our own tick
ets. Then they said we'd just have
to stay in the stands.
But we've worked it out. Now
they have disappointed us. They
set the stakes high, but we paid
their price. It was costly, but we
ARE back!
Big Game is upon us as the au
tumn sun sets earlier, sending
shadows across the field. But in
fact this game has been over
shadowed for weeks. No longer is
this the season finale for the Card
inal and its entourage. Two bowl
games and much musical contro
versy have put a damper on the
usual rivalry down on the Farm.
Now the day is here, the bowls
have bid and the Band is back to
display its new personality. We've
cleaned up our Axe ("Sanitized for
your protection!"), so Come Join
The Band!
But it's been three weeks since
we've been out in front of so many
people. What do we do now? What
if they still don't like us? Are you
sure it's OK? Can we really play

now? Sure, Let The Children Play!
Lest you think we've sold out,
however, think again! We may have
stopped drinking on game days,
but we're still the LSJIJMB and we
are an American Band.

The first half is over and the
bowl scouts have completed their
jobs. In a few hours, the official
bids will be released. So the Band
forms a crystal ball for you all to
predict the post-season fate of our
Cardinal gridsters.
With what twisted Pretzel Logic
will the bowls deal out the bids?

The verdict is in, and we are going
bowling!
When we first arrive at the
bowling alley, all is very quiet.
None of the teams have arrived yet,
and it seems deserted. We look
Roundabout, but no one is in sight.
So we decide to play a few lines
(Yes, that is what 10 frames are
called).
We go up to the counter to get
some bowling shoes. But the shoes
we get look somewhat peculiar.
They're not two-tone orange and
burgundy. They have this deep
green lustre and strange reptilian
texture. And when we put them on
we get the feeling that we're
Walking On Sunshine!
That's it! These aren't shoes for
any ordinary bowl. They're made
of 'gator skin. This can only mean
one thing! We've got an Open Invi
tation to do the Crocodile Rock in
Jacksonville, Fla., with the Tigers of
Clemson University.
As for our cross-Bay rivals? Well,
at least they have a long rest ahead
of them and will be able to spend
Christmas at home.

It's been a lough couple of weeks for the Stanford band. After
being cited for lewd conduct and unexemplary field behavior,
the truly incomparable musicians were suspended for the UCLA
game by order of Athletic Director Andy Geiger. But after a series
of meetings and the writing of a new charter, the band and its
dry humor are back.
