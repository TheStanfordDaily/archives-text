# Axe tells story of pain and glory
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
A sharp piece of metal suitable
for cutting wood, rendered vir
tually useless by its lack of a han
dle. An object of jealousy, thievery,
competition, bloodlust. A symbol
of one of the longest-standing and
richest rivalries in collegiate ath
letics. The spoils of the Big Game.
The Axe.
Now it is mounted neatly on
polished mahogony, its 14-inch
blade shined and clean. Below it is
a plaque bearing the scores of past
Big Games. Its heading reads, "The
Stanford Axe — Forged March
1899. Captured by California April
15, 1899. Recaptured by Stanford
April 3, 1930. To be awarded an
nually to the winner of the Big
Game."
It is a simple inscription, belying
the coveted weapon's tumultuous
past. The sharp edge of passion
surrounding the Axe seems to have
been dulled in recent years, per
haps because its transfer from
school to school is so orderly now,
an inexorable function of the
result of the Big Game.
But in days of old, the Axe was
more a mascot than a trophy, and
its possessor could hold onto it as
long as it liked, unless the enemy
stole it away. Back then, the history
of the blade was, as a 1947 Daily
headline read, "replete with raids,
blood, triumph, dull despair."
But before that, before there was
ever an Axe, there was an Axe yell.
By the mid-1890s, shortly after
the opening of Stanford, the natu
ral geographic rivalry between the
nascent school in Palo Alto and its
more established cross-Bay neigh
bor had begun to heat up.
The Axe yell, growing out of this
budding rivalry, came from some

where in the imagination of Will Ir
win and Chris Bradley, Stanford
Class of '98. Just why the two chose
an axe as Stanford's figurative in
strument of spleen-venting is un
clear. In his book titled "The Stan
ford Axe,'' R.G. O'Neil posited this
theory:
"The axe was the most terrible
of weapons. Even as an instrument
of domestic utility, we think of the
axe not as the great boon to the
pioneers of old who forced back
our frontiers ... but rather as the
means for stopping the squawks of
excited chickens by one clean
blow which severed the head and
covered the ground with spurting
blood.
"And the stark naked truth of the
matter is simply this: the axe is the
symbol which most accurately
describes the subconscious
feelings of those loyal to Stanford
and California" toward the oppos
ing school.
And Will Irwin, according to
O'Neil, "put his finger unerringly
on this feeling, and came through
with the famous yell," which goes
as follows:
"Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, give 'em the Axe,
give 'em the Axe!
Where?
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, right in the neck,
right in the neck!
There!"
The Axe yell was born in 1896,
but some observers, including
Archie Cloud in his book "The
Stanford Axe," have noted that the
cadence of the yell imitates the
rhvthm of the chorus in the At

henian comedy "The Frogs,"
penned by Aristophanes some
2,000 years earlier.
Whether or not its creation was
the result of some Western Culture
plagiarism, the Axe yell was ini
tially the sole possession of Stan
ford rooters (and probably a tad
tiresome to the Berkeley faithful).
It was not until 1899 that anyone
had the idea of a real axe to accom
pany the Axe yell. And even then, it
was only because the Stanford
baseball team was in a crisis.
Facing California in April 1899 in
a best-of-three series to decide the
intercollegiate champion, the Stan
ford nine dropped the first contest.
Despairing Stanford backers
sensed that the team needed spe
cial inspiration before the second
contest. Yell-leader Billy Erb, along
with a few classmates, gathered
$4.50 and purchased a rusty
broadaxe which had a 14-inch
blade and weighed over 10
pounds. He painted the blade red
and attached a makeshift four-foot
handle.
At the huge bonfire rally two
nights before the baseball game,
Erb brought out the Axe, made a
big display of sharpening it on a
grindstone and then chopped the
head off a blue and gold-clad ef
figy-
The crowd responded wildly,
and two days later Erb appeared at
the ballgame (which was played at
old Recreation Park in downtown
San Franciso), brandishing the
blade menacingly in the faces of
the Berkeley rooters and leading
the Stanfordites in the Axe yell.
Although the Axe and yell ap
parently irked California's backers,
it had litle effect on the Bears team,
which rolled to a 9-7 victory to
wrap up the championship.
The Stanford fans felt betrayed

be their new totem and paid little
attention to the Axe's safety in the
aftermath of the disappointing loss.
It was entrusted to the keeping of
three Stanford men, who barely
got out the gate of the park before
they were jumped by a mob of
Bear bullies. The Berkeleyites
seized the Axe and dashed away.
A wild chase through the streets
of the City ensued. The thiefs
paused in a butcher shop long

enough to cut off the Axe's handle,
then made for the wharf, where,
concealing the head of the Axe,
they were able to sneak past a
gauntlet of San Francisco police
and Stanfordites, board a ferry and
ride to safety across the Bay.
Stanford students were outraged
by the theft. Raids between the two
school became rampant. So much
ill will was generated in the en
suing days that Stanford President
David Starr Jordan had to issue a
formal public admonition to the
Stanford student body, saying "Let
no old axe cut off our dignity and
self-respect." Eventually, both
schools' administrations agreed
that the Axe was Cal's "by right of
conquest" and outlawed all further
raids.
Still, recovery of the Axe
remained an all-consuming pas
sion on the Farm.
Meanwhile, Berkeley fans
adopted the Axe yell for their own
use, using it like salt in the wounds
of the Stanford faithful at every op
portunity. Each year in April,
Berkeley held a huge bonfire and
Axe rally in its Greek Theater.The
safekeeping of the weapon was
entrusted to the Axe Custodian,
usually a member of the California
baseball team, who was elected an
nually by vote of the student body.
When not out for its single annual
appearance at the rally, the Axe
was kept locked up in a bank vault
at the American Trust Company in
Berkeley.
For 31 years the Axe rested in
the hands of the Golden Bears,
"estranged from the Farm, its

After last year's Big Game, the exalted Axe was in Cardinal hands,
where it has remained ever since. Unable to steal it back as the
"Immortal 21" did in 1930, the Bears' only hope of regaining the
trophy will be on the football field Saturday. Otherwise it'll be
another "axe-less" year for Cal.
birthplace, and subjected to the
crazed gloatings of its malefac
tors," as the 1930 Quad said.
But in 1930 the Axe made a sud
den and glorious return to the
Farm.
A group of 21 Stanford under
graduates and recent graduates
(subsequently given the name
"The Immortal 21") had been plot
ting the recover)' of the Axe for
several years. Their attempts in
1928 and 1929 were foiled, but in
1930 their scheme was flawless.
On the eve of Cal's rally, April 3,
1930, the 21, led by Don Kropp,
drove in three cars to Berkeley.
Several of them were dressed as
Berkeley freshmen, the others as
newspapermen.
As the rally came to a close, four
of the Stanfordites, incon
spicuously clad in blue and gold
and posing as protectors of the
Axe, managed to attach themselves
to the armored car transporting
the Axe back to the bank. Mean
while, the others parked their cars
outside the bank and waited,
poised with fake cameras and a
tear gas bomb created in a
chemistry lab back at Stanford.
When the Axe, with its coterie of
guardians, arrived at the bank, the
bogus newsmen implored Axe
Custodian Norman Horner to pose
for a few photographs. They then
popped a bright flash in Horner's
eyes, blinding him momentarily.
The Stanfordites nabbed the Axe
and amid the tumult created by the
exploding tear gas bomb, passed it
quickly through the throng around
the bank, and whisked it into the
waiting getaway car.
Fifty minutes later, the Axe was
back on the Farm. Stanford stu
dents were exultant, rising from
their slumbers for an impromptu
late-night celebration.
News of the theft spread quickly,
inspiring hyperbolic prose and
oratory on both sides of the Bay.
The Daily's banner headline the
next day screamed "AXE
REGAINED!" in three- and-a-half
inch high letters. The Daily Califor
nian moaned "AXE STOLEN" in let
ters just as large.
"The Stanford Axe is Stanford's
once more," said The Daily in
reporting the event. "While the
Blue and Gold horde literally
slumbered on its feet last night, a
band of 20 intrepid wearers of the
Cardinal whisked the precious
implement from under the nose of
the Berkeleyans in whose posses
sion it had rested since that fatal
day in 1899, and brought it back to
the Stanford campus."
At a campus-wide rally honoring
the 21, Dan Evans, Class of '20,
spoke for the alumni, saying,
"During the last 31 years, there
hasn't been a Stanford man or
woman who hasn't dreamed of this
day."
The Axe itself, meanwhile, was
stored in Roble Hall its first night
on campus, then was moved to a
steel vault at the Palo Alto Ameri
can Trust Bank.

On the other side of the Bay, a
pall of gloom fell over the
Berkeley campus. Considerable
bitterness was directed toward the
Farm, manifested by several "hate
Stanford" editorials in The Daily
California!!, the student newspa
per.
Berkeley was quite quick to pro
pose a plan to make the Axe the of
ficial trophy of the annual Big
Game, to be awarded automatically
to the winner every year.
Stanford did not receive this
proposal with overwhelming en
thusiasm.
"The Axe is not and never was a
trophy to be passed from hand to
hand," said a Stanford Daily edito
rial. "It is a symbol of Stanford
It is not and never was Califor
nia's If men and women here
on th Farm are inclined to treat this
matter seriously, they should pro
pose that California put up her
Golden Bear along with the Card
inal Axe as a Big Game trophy.


Within hours after the "Immortal 21" repossessed the Axe, the Stanford Daily informed campus
with this mammoth headline. The Friday, April 4,1930 front page headline was no less than three
and-a-half inches high. The woebegotten Daily California ran a similar headline that read "Axe
stolen".
Would not that be more equable,
more reasonable?"
Nonetheless, in 1933 the student
body presidents of the two schools
signed an agreement designating
the Axe as the official Big Game
trophy and arranging for its or
derly annual transfer to the
campus of the victor.
Since then, there have been
numerous attempted thefts of the
Axe, meeting with varying degrees
of success.
The most colorful incident oc
curred in November 1973- Three
members of Stanford's Theta Delta
Chi fraternity (later dubbed "The
Infamous Three") cooked up a
ruse startlingly reminiscent of the
Immortal 21's daring deed 43 years
earlier.
Impersonating Cal head football
coach Mike White, one of the
Three called the general manager
of the UC student union and asked

that the Axe be brought to that
week's meeting of the Northern
California Football Writers, to be
held at Ming's Restaurant in Palo
Alto.
When the Axe arrived outside
the restaurant, another of the
Three, clad in a California letter
man's jacket, persuaded the Axe's
keepeers to let him hold the Axe
for a minute. As soon as he got his
hands on the precious trophy, he
bolted; a tussle ensued and a car
load of backup fraternity brothers
arrived just in time to carry the Axe
and its rescuers to safety.
The Axe disappeared mys
teriously for a few days, and was
eventually given back to Cal six
days later, just before the kickoff of
that year's Big Game.

Although the intensity of feeling
generated by the Axe has dimmed
somewhat during its 87-year life,
the shiny blade remains the sym
bol of a grand and long-lived
rivalry. Hear the timeless words of
the editor of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review as he reflected on
the 1930 capture of the Axe:
"There is a side to this affair (the
recovery of the Axe) that lifts it out
of the commonplace of college
rivalries. For 31 years, we have
carried the determination to
regain the symbol of Stanford
spirit.
"Just a sharp piece of metal! But
it represents a unifying object — a
force that holds us together, stu
dents and alumni, to pit combined
brain and energy against a friendly
rival."

the result of some Western Culture
plagiarism, the Axe yell was ini
tially the sole possession of Stan
ford rooters (and probably a tad
tiresome to the Berkeley faithful).
It was not until 1899 that anyone
had the idea of a real axe to accom
pany the Axe yell. And even then, it
was only because the Stanford
baseball team was in a crisis.
Facing California in April 1899 in
a best-of-three series to decide the
intercollegiate champion, the Stan
ford nine dropped the first contest.
Despairing Stanford backers
sensed that the team needed spe
cial inspiration before the second
contest. Yell-leader Billy Erb, along
with a few classmates, gathered
$4.50 and purchased a rusty
broadaxe which had a 14-inch
blade and weighed over 10
pounds. He painted the blade red
and attached a makeshift four-foot
handle.
At the huge bonfire rally two
nights before the baseball game,
Erb brought out the Axe, made a
big display of sharpening it on a
grindstone and then chopped the
head off a blue and gold-clad ef
figy-
The crowd responded wildly,
and two days later Erb appeared at
the ballgame (which was played at
old Recreation Park in downtown
San Franciso), brandishing the
blade menacingly in the faces of
the Berkeley rooters and leading
the Stanfordites in the Axe yell.
Although the Axe and yell ap
parently irked California's backers,
it had litle effect on the Bears team,
which rolled to a 9-7 victory to
wrap up the championship.
The Stanford fans felt betrayed

be their new totem and paid little
attention to the Axe's safety in the
aftermath of the disappointing loss.
It was entrusted to the keeping of
three Stanford men, who barely
got out the gate of the park before
they were jumped by a mob of
Bear bullies. The Berkeleyites
seized the Axe and dashed away.
A wild chase through the streets
of the City ensued. The thiefs
paused in a butcher shop long

enough to cut off the Axe's handle,
then made for the wharf, where,
concealing the head of the Axe,
they were able to sneak past a
gauntlet of San Francisco police
and Stanfordites, board a ferry and
ride to safety across the Bay.
Stanford students were outraged
by the theft. Raids between the two
school became rampant. So much
ill will was generated in the en
suing days that Stanford President
David Starr Jordan had to issue a
formal public admonition to the
Stanford student body, saying "Let
no old axe cut off our dignity and
self-respect." Eventually, both
schools' administrations agreed
that the Axe was Cal's "by right of
conquest" and outlawed all further
raids.
Still, recovery of the Axe
remained an all-consuming pas
sion on the Farm.
Meanwhile, Berkeley fans
adopted the Axe yell for their own
use, using it like salt in the wounds
of the Stanford faithful at every op
portunity. Each year in April,
Berkeley held a huge bonfire and
Axe rally in its Greek Theater.The
safekeeping of the weapon was
entrusted to the Axe Custodian,
usually a member of the California
baseball team, who was elected an
nually by vote of the student body.
When not out for its single annual
appearance at the rally, the Axe
was kept locked up in a bank vault
at the American Trust Company in
Berkeley.
For 31 years the Axe rested in
the hands of the Golden Bears,

After last year's Big Game, the exalted Axe was in Cardinal hands,
where it has remained ever since. Unable to steal it back as the

trophy will be on the football field Saturday. Otherwise it'll be

birthplace, and subjected to the
crazed gloatings of its malefac
tors," as the 1930 Quad said.
But in 1930 the Axe made a sud
den and glorious return to the
Farm.
A group of 21 Stanford under
graduates and recent graduates
(subsequently given the name
"The Immortal 21") had been plot
ting the recover)' of the Axe for
several years. Their attempts in
1928 and 1929 were foiled, but in
1930 their scheme was flawless.
On the eve of Cal's rally, April 3,
1930, the 21, led by Don Kropp,
drove in three cars to Berkeley.
Several of them were dressed as
Berkeley freshmen, the others as
newspapermen.
As the rally came to a close, four
of the Stanfordites, incon
spicuously clad in blue and gold
and posing as protectors of the
Axe, managed to attach themselves
to the armored car transporting
the Axe back to the bank. Mean
while, the others parked their cars
outside the bank and waited,
poised with fake cameras and a
tear gas bomb created in a
chemistry lab back at Stanford.
When the Axe, with its coterie of
guardians, arrived at the bank, the
bogus newsmen implored Axe
Custodian Norman Horner to pose
for a few photographs. They then
popped a bright flash in Horner's
eyes, blinding him momentarily.
The Stanfordites nabbed the Axe
and amid the tumult created by the
exploding tear gas bomb, passed it
quickly through the throng around
the bank, and whisked it into the
waiting getaway car.
Fifty minutes later, the Axe was
back on the Farm. Stanford stu
dents were exultant, rising from
their slumbers for an impromptu
late-night celebration.
News of the theft spread quickly,
inspiring hyperbolic prose and
oratory on both sides of the Bay.
The Daily's banner headline the
next day screamed "AXE
REGAINED!" in three- and-a-half
inch high letters. The Daily Califor
nian moaned "AXE STOLEN" in let
ters just as large.
"The Stanford Axe is Stanford's
once more," said The Daily in
reporting the event. "While the
Blue and Gold horde literally
slumbered on its feet last night, a
band of 20 intrepid wearers of the
Cardinal whisked the precious
implement from under the nose of
the Berkeleyans in whose posses
sion it had rested since that fatal
day in 1899, and brought it back to
the Stanford campus."
At a campus-wide rally honoring
the 21, Dan Evans, Class of '20,
spoke for the alumni, saying,
"During the last 31 years, there
hasn't been a Stanford man or
woman who hasn't dreamed of this
day."
The Axe itself, meanwhile, was
stored in Roble Hall its first night
on campus, then was moved to a
steel vault at the Palo Alto Ameri
can Trust Bank.

On the other side of the Bay, a
pall of gloom fell over the
Berkeley campus. Considerable
bitterness was directed toward the
Farm, manifested by several "hate
Stanford" editorials in The Daily
California!!, the student newspa
per.
Berkeley was quite quick to pro
pose a plan to make the Axe the of
ficial trophy of the annual Big
Game, to be awarded automatically
to the winner every year.
Stanford did not receive this
proposal with overwhelming en
thusiasm.
"The Axe is not and never was a
trophy to be passed from hand to
hand," said a Stanford Daily edito
rial. "It is a symbol of Stanford
It is not and never was Califor
nia's If men and women here
on th Farm are inclined to treat this
matter seriously, they should pro
pose that California put up her
Golden Bear along with the Card
inal Axe as a Big Game trophy.


Within hours after the "Immortal 21" repossessed the Axe, the Stanford Daily informed campus
with this mammoth headline. The Friday, April 4,1930 front page headline was no less than three
and-a-half inches high. The woebegotten Daily California ran a similar headline that read "Axe
stolen".
Would not that be more equable,
more reasonable?"
Nonetheless, in 1933 the student
body presidents of the two schools
signed an agreement designating
the Axe as the official Big Game
trophy and arranging for its or
derly annual transfer to the
campus of the victor.
Since then, there have been
numerous attempted thefts of the
Axe, meeting with varying degrees
of success.
The most colorful incident oc
curred in November 1973- Three
members of Stanford's Theta Delta
Chi fraternity (later dubbed "The
Infamous Three") cooked up a
ruse startlingly reminiscent of the
Immortal 21's daring deed 43 years
earlier.
Impersonating Cal head football
coach Mike White, one of the
Three called the general manager
of the UC student union and asked

that the Axe be brought to that
week's meeting of the Northern
California Football Writers, to be
held at Ming's Restaurant in Palo
Alto.
When the Axe arrived outside
the restaurant, another of the
Three, clad in a California letter
man's jacket, persuaded the Axe's
keepeers to let him hold the Axe
for a minute. As soon as he got his
hands on the precious trophy, he
bolted; a tussle ensued and a car
load of backup fraternity brothers
arrived just in time to carry the Axe
and its rescuers to safety.
The Axe disappeared mys
teriously for a few days, and was
eventually given back to Cal six
days later, just before the kickoff of
that year's Big Game.

Although the intensity of feeling
generated by the Axe has dimmed
somewhat during its 87-year life,
the shiny blade remains the sym
bol of a grand and long-lived
rivalry. Hear the timeless words of
the editor of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review as he reflected on
the 1930 capture of the Axe:
"There is a side to this affair (the
recovery of the Axe) that lifts it out
of the commonplace of college
rivalries. For 31 years, we have
carried the determination to
regain the symbol of Stanford
spirit.
"Just a sharp piece of metal! But
it represents a unifying object — a
force that holds us together, stu
dents and alumni, to pit combined
brain and energy against a friendly
rival."
A sharp piece of metal suitable
for cutting wood, rendered vir
tually useless by its lack of a han
dle. An object of jealousy, thievery,
competition, bloodlust. A symbol
of one of the longest-standing and
richest rivalries in collegiate ath
letics. The spoils of the Big Game.
The Axe.
Now it is mounted neatly on
polished mahogony, its 14-inch
blade shined and clean. Below it is
a plaque bearing the scores of past
Big Games. Its heading reads, "The
Stanford Axe — Forged March
1899. Captured by California April
15, 1899. Recaptured by Stanford
April 3, 1930. To be awarded an
nually to the winner of the Big
Game."
It is a simple inscription, belying
the coveted weapon's tumultuous
past. The sharp edge of passion
surrounding the Axe seems to have
been dulled in recent years, per
haps because its transfer from
school to school is so orderly now,
an inexorable function of the
result of the Big Game.
But in days of old, the Axe was
more a mascot than a trophy, and
its possessor could hold onto it as
long as it liked, unless the enemy
stole it away. Back then, the history
of the blade was, as a 1947 Daily
headline read, "replete with raids,
blood, triumph, dull despair."
But before that, before there was
ever an Axe, there was an Axe yell.
By the mid-1890s, shortly after
the opening of Stanford, the natu
ral geographic rivalry between the
nascent school in Palo Alto and its
more established cross-Bay neigh
bor had begun to heat up.
The Axe yell, growing out of this
budding rivalry, came from some

where in the imagination of Will Ir
win and Chris Bradley, Stanford
Class of '98. Just why the two chose
an axe as Stanford's figurative in
strument of spleen-venting is un
clear. In his book titled "The Stan
ford Axe,'' R.G. O'Neil posited this
theory:
"The axe was the most terrible
of weapons. Even as an instrument
of domestic utility, we think of the
axe not as the great boon to the
pioneers of old who forced back
our frontiers ... but rather as the
means for stopping the squawks of
excited chickens by one clean
blow which severed the head and
covered the ground with spurting
blood.
"And the stark naked truth of the
matter is simply this: the axe is the
symbol which most accurately
describes the subconscious
feelings of those loyal to Stanford
and California" toward the oppos
ing school.
And Will Irwin, according to
O'Neil, "put his finger unerringly
on this feeling, and came through
with the famous yell," which goes
as follows:
"Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, give 'em the Axe,
give 'em the Axe!
Where?
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, right in the neck,
right in the neck!
There!"
The Axe yell was born in 1896,
but some observers, including
Archie Cloud in his book "The
Stanford Axe," have noted that the
cadence of the yell imitates the
rhvthm of the chorus in the At

henian comedy "The Frogs,"
penned by Aristophanes some
2,000 years earlier.
Whether or not its creation was
the result of some Western Culture
plagiarism, the Axe yell was ini

where it has remained ever since. Unable to steal it back as the
"Immortal 21" did in 1930, the Bears' only hope of regaining the
trophy will be on the football field Saturday. Otherwise it'll be
another "axe-less" year for Cal.
birthplace, and subjected to the
crazed gloatings of its malefac
tors," as the 1930 Quad said.
But in 1930 the Axe made a sud
den and glorious return to the
Farm.
A group of 21 Stanford under
graduates and recent graduates
(subsequently given the name
"The Immortal 21") had been plot
ting the recover)' of the Axe for
several years. Their attempts in
1928 and 1929 were foiled, but in
1930 their scheme was flawless.
On the eve of Cal's rally, April 3,
1930, the 21, led by Don Kropp,
drove in three cars to Berkeley.
Several of them were dressed as
Berkeley freshmen, the others as
newspapermen.
As the rally came to a close, four
of the Stanfordites, incon
spicuously clad in blue and gold
and posing as protectors of the
Axe, managed to attach themselves
to the armored car transporting
the Axe back to the bank. Mean
while, the others parked their cars
outside the bank and waited,
poised with fake cameras and a
tear gas bomb created in a
chemistry lab back at Stanford.
When the Axe, with its coterie of
guardians, arrived at the bank, the
bogus newsmen implored Axe
Custodian Norman Horner to pose
for a few photographs. They then
popped a bright flash in Horner's
eyes, blinding him momentarily.
The Stanfordites nabbed the Axe
and amid the tumult created by the
exploding tear gas bomb, passed it
quickly through the throng around
the bank, and whisked it into the
waiting getaway car.
Fifty minutes later, the Axe was
back on the Farm. Stanford stu
dents were exultant, rising from
their slumbers for an impromptu
late-night celebration.
News of the theft spread quickly,
inspiring hyperbolic prose and
oratory on both sides of the Bay.
The Daily's banner headline the
next day screamed "AXE
REGAINED!" in three- and-a-half
inch high letters. The Daily Califor
nian moaned "AXE STOLEN" in let
ters just as large.
"The Stanford Axe is Stanford's
once more," said The Daily in
reporting the event. "While the
Blue and Gold horde literally
slumbered on its feet last night, a
band of 20 intrepid wearers of the
Cardinal whisked the precious
implement from under the nose of
the Berkeleyans in whose posses
sion it had rested since that fatal
day in 1899, and brought it back to
the Stanford campus."
At a campus-wide rally honoring
the 21, Dan Evans, Class of '20,
spoke for the alumni, saying,
"During the last 31 years, there
hasn't been a Stanford man or
woman who hasn't dreamed of this
day."
The Axe itself, meanwhile, was
stored in Roble Hall its first night
on campus, then was moved to a
steel vault at the Palo Alto Ameri
can Trust Bank.

On the other side of the Bay, a
pall of gloom fell over the
Berkeley campus. Considerable
bitterness was directed toward the
Farm, manifested by several "hate
Stanford" editorials in The Daily
California!!, the student newspa
per.
Berkeley was quite quick to pro
pose a plan to make the Axe the of
ficial trophy of the annual Big
Game, to be awarded automatically
to the winner every year.
Stanford did not receive this
proposal with overwhelming en
thusiasm.
"The Axe is not and never was a
trophy to be passed from hand to
hand," said a Stanford Daily edito
rial. "It is a symbol of Stanford
It is not and never was Califor
nia's If men and women here
on th Farm are inclined to treat this
matter seriously, they should pro
pose that California put up her
Golden Bear along with the Card
inal Axe as a Big Game trophy.


Within hours after the "Immortal 21" repossessed the Axe, the Stanford Daily informed campus
with this mammoth headline. The Friday, April 4,1930 front page headline was no less than three
and-a-half inches high. The woebegotten Daily California ran a similar headline that read "Axe
stolen".
Would not that be more equable,
more reasonable?"
Nonetheless, in 1933 the student
body presidents of the two schools
signed an agreement designating
the Axe as the official Big Game
trophy and arranging for its or
derly annual transfer to the
campus of the victor.
Since then, there have been
numerous attempted thefts of the
Axe, meeting with varying degrees
of success.
The most colorful incident oc
curred in November 1973- Three
members of Stanford's Theta Delta
Chi fraternity (later dubbed "The
Infamous Three") cooked up a
ruse startlingly reminiscent of the
Immortal 21's daring deed 43 years
earlier.
Impersonating Cal head football
coach Mike White, one of the
Three called the general manager
of the UC student union and asked

that the Axe be brought to that
week's meeting of the Northern
California Football Writers, to be
held at Ming's Restaurant in Palo
Alto.
When the Axe arrived outside
the restaurant, another of the
Three, clad in a California letter
man's jacket, persuaded the Axe's
keepeers to let him hold the Axe
for a minute. As soon as he got his
hands on the precious trophy, he
bolted; a tussle ensued and a car
load of backup fraternity brothers
arrived just in time to carry the Axe
and its rescuers to safety.
The Axe disappeared mys
teriously for a few days, and was
eventually given back to Cal six
days later, just before the kickoff of
that year's Big Game.

Although the intensity of feeling
generated by the Axe has dimmed
somewhat during its 87-year life,
the shiny blade remains the sym
bol of a grand and long-lived
rivalry. Hear the timeless words of
the editor of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review as he reflected on
the 1930 capture of the Axe:
"There is a side to this affair (the
recovery of the Axe) that lifts it out
of the commonplace of college
rivalries. For 31 years, we have
carried the determination to
regain the symbol of Stanford
spirit.
"Just a sharp piece of metal! But
it represents a unifying object — a
force that holds us together, stu
dents and alumni, to pit combined
brain and energy against a friendly
rival."
A sharp piece of metal suitable
for cutting wood, rendered vir
tually useless by its lack of a han
dle. An object of jealousy, thievery,
competition, bloodlust. A symbol
of one of the longest-standing and
richest rivalries in collegiate ath
letics. The spoils of the Big Game.
The Axe.
Now it is mounted neatly on
polished mahogony, its 14-inch
blade shined and clean. Below it is
a plaque bearing the scores of past
Big Games. Its heading reads, "The
Stanford Axe — Forged March
1899. Captured by California April
15, 1899. Recaptured by Stanford
April 3, 1930. To be awarded an
nually to the winner of the Big
Game."
It is a simple inscription, belying
the coveted weapon's tumultuous
past. The sharp edge of passion
surrounding the Axe seems to have
been dulled in recent years, per
haps because its transfer from
school to school is so orderly now,
an inexorable function of the
result of the Big Game.
But in days of old, the Axe was
more a mascot than a trophy, and
its possessor could hold onto it as
long as it liked, unless the enemy
stole it away. Back then, the history
of the blade was, as a 1947 Daily
headline read, "replete with raids,
blood, triumph, dull despair."
But before that, before there was
ever an Axe, there was an Axe yell.
By the mid-1890s, shortly after
the opening of Stanford, the natu
ral geographic rivalry between the
nascent school in Palo Alto and its
more established cross-Bay neigh
bor had begun to heat up.
The Axe yell, growing out of this
budding rivalry, came from some

where in the imagination of Will Ir
win and Chris Bradley, Stanford
Class of '98. Just why the two chose
an axe as Stanford's figurative in
strument of spleen-venting is un
clear. In his book titled "The Stan
ford Axe,'' R.G. O'Neil posited this
theory:
"The axe was the most terrible
of weapons. Even as an instrument
of domestic utility, we think of the
axe not as the great boon to the
pioneers of old who forced back
our frontiers ... but rather as the
means for stopping the squawks of
excited chickens by one clean
blow which severed the head and
covered the ground with spurting
blood.
"And the stark naked truth of the
matter is simply this: the axe is the
symbol which most accurately
describes the subconscious
feelings of those loyal to Stanford
and California" toward the oppos
ing school.
And Will Irwin, according to
O'Neil, "put his finger unerringly
on this feeling, and came through
with the famous yell," which goes
as follows:
"Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, give 'em the Axe,
give 'em the Axe!
Where?
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, right in the neck,
right in the neck!
There!"
The Axe yell was born in 1896,
but some observers, including
Archie Cloud in his book "The
Stanford Axe," have noted that the
cadence of the yell imitates the
rhvthm of the chorus in the At

henian comedy "The Frogs,"
penned by Aristophanes some
2,000 years earlier.
Whether or not its creation was
the result of some Western Culture
plagiarism, the Axe yell was ini
tially the sole possession of Stan
ford rooters (and probably a tad
tiresome to the Berkeley faithful).
It was not until 1899 that anyone
had the idea of a real axe to accom
pany the Axe yell. And even then, it
was only because the Stanford
baseball team was in a crisis.
Facing California in April 1899 in
a best-of-three series to decide the
intercollegiate champion, the Stan
ford nine dropped the first contest.
Despairing Stanford backers
sensed that the team needed spe
cial inspiration before the second
contest. Yell-leader Billy Erb, along
with a few classmates, gathered
$4.50 and purchased a rusty
broadaxe which had a 14-inch
blade and weighed over 10
pounds. He painted the blade red
and attached a makeshift four-foot
handle.
At the huge bonfire rally two
nights before the baseball game,
Erb brought out the Axe, made a
big display of sharpening it on a
grindstone and then chopped the
head off a blue and gold-clad ef
figy-
The crowd responded wildly,
and two days later Erb appeared at
the ballgame (which was played at
old Recreation Park in downtown
San Franciso), brandishing the
blade menacingly in the faces of
the Berkeley rooters and leading
the Stanfordites in the Axe yell.
Although the Axe and yell ap
parently irked California's backers,
it had litle effect on the Bears team,
which rolled to a 9-7 victory to
wrap up the championship.
The Stanford fans felt betrayed

be their new totem and paid little
attention to the Axe's safety in the
aftermath of the disappointing loss.
It was entrusted to the keeping of
three Stanford men, who barely
got out the gate of the park before
they were jumped by a mob of
Bear bullies. The Berkeleyites
seized the Axe and dashed away.
A wild chase through the streets
of the City ensued. The thiefs
paused in a butcher shop long

enough to cut off the Axe's handle,
then made for the wharf, where,
concealing the head of the Axe,
they were able to sneak past a
gauntlet of San Francisco police
and Stanfordites, board a ferry and
ride to safety across the Bay.
Stanford students were outraged
by the theft. Raids between the two
school became rampant. So much
ill will was generated in the en
suing days that Stanford President
David Starr Jordan had to issue a
formal public admonition to the
Stanford student body, saying "Let
no old axe cut off our dignity and
self-respect." Eventually, both
schools' administrations agreed
that the Axe was Cal's "by right of
conquest" and outlawed all further
raids.
Still, recovery of the Axe
remained an all-consuming pas
sion on the Farm.
Meanwhile, Berkeley fans
adopted the Axe yell for their own
use, using it like salt in the wounds
of the Stanford faithful at every op
portunity. Each year in April,
Berkeley held a huge bonfire and
Axe rally in its Greek Theater.The
safekeeping of the weapon was
entrusted to the Axe Custodian,
usually a member of the California
baseball team, who was elected an
nually by vote of the student body.
When not out for its single annual
appearance at the rally, the Axe
was kept locked up in a bank vault
at the American Trust Company in
Berkeley.

Within hours after the "Immortal 21" repossessed the Axe, the Stanford Daily informed campus
with this mammoth headline. The Friday, April 4,1930 front page headline was no less than three
and-a-half inches high. The woebegotten Daily California ran a similar headline that read "Axe
stolen".
Would not that be more equable,
more reasonable?"
Nonetheless, in 1933 the student
body presidents of the two schools
signed an agreement designating
the Axe as the official Big Game
trophy and arranging for its or
derly annual transfer to the
campus of the victor.
Since then, there have been
numerous attempted thefts of the
Axe, meeting with varying degrees
of success.
The most colorful incident oc
curred in November 1973- Three
members of Stanford's Theta Delta
Chi fraternity (later dubbed "The
Infamous Three") cooked up a
ruse startlingly reminiscent of the
Immortal 21's daring deed 43 years
earlier.
Impersonating Cal head football
coach Mike White, one of the
Three called the general manager
of the UC student union and asked

that the Axe be brought to that
week's meeting of the Northern
California Football Writers, to be
held at Ming's Restaurant in Palo
Alto.
When the Axe arrived outside
the restaurant, another of the
Three, clad in a California letter
man's jacket, persuaded the Axe's
keepeers to let him hold the Axe
for a minute. As soon as he got his
hands on the precious trophy, he
bolted; a tussle ensued and a car
load of backup fraternity brothers
arrived just in time to carry the Axe
and its rescuers to safety.
The Axe disappeared mys
teriously for a few days, and was
eventually given back to Cal six
days later, just before the kickoff of
that year's Big Game.

Although the intensity of feeling
generated by the Axe has dimmed
somewhat during its 87-year life,
the shiny blade remains the sym
bol of a grand and long-lived
rivalry. Hear the timeless words of
the editor of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review as he reflected on
the 1930 capture of the Axe:
"There is a side to this affair (the
recovery of the Axe) that lifts it out
of the commonplace of college
rivalries. For 31 years, we have
carried the determination to
regain the symbol of Stanford
spirit.
"Just a sharp piece of metal! But
it represents a unifying object — a
force that holds us together, stu
dents and alumni, to pit combined
brain and energy against a friendly
rival."
A sharp piece of metal suitable
for cutting wood, rendered vir
tually useless by its lack of a han
dle. An object of jealousy, thievery,
competition, bloodlust. A symbol
of one of the longest-standing and
richest rivalries in collegiate ath
letics. The spoils of the Big Game.
The Axe.
Now it is mounted neatly on
polished mahogony, its 14-inch
blade shined and clean. Below it is
a plaque bearing the scores of past
Big Games. Its heading reads, "The
Stanford Axe — Forged March
1899. Captured by California April
15, 1899. Recaptured by Stanford
April 3, 1930. To be awarded an
nually to the winner of the Big
Game."
It is a simple inscription, belying
the coveted weapon's tumultuous
past. The sharp edge of passion
surrounding the Axe seems to have
been dulled in recent years, per
haps because its transfer from
school to school is so orderly now,
an inexorable function of the
result of the Big Game.
But in days of old, the Axe was
more a mascot than a trophy, and
its possessor could hold onto it as
long as it liked, unless the enemy
stole it away. Back then, the history
of the blade was, as a 1947 Daily
headline read, "replete with raids,
blood, triumph, dull despair."
But before that, before there was
ever an Axe, there was an Axe yell.
By the mid-1890s, shortly after
the opening of Stanford, the natu
ral geographic rivalry between the
nascent school in Palo Alto and its
more established cross-Bay neigh
bor had begun to heat up.
The Axe yell, growing out of this
budding rivalry, came from some

where in the imagination of Will Ir
win and Chris Bradley, Stanford
Class of '98. Just why the two chose
an axe as Stanford's figurative in
strument of spleen-venting is un
clear. In his book titled "The Stan
ford Axe,'' R.G. O'Neil posited this
theory:
"The axe was the most terrible
of weapons. Even as an instrument
of domestic utility, we think of the
axe not as the great boon to the
pioneers of old who forced back
our frontiers ... but rather as the
means for stopping the squawks of
excited chickens by one clean
blow which severed the head and
covered the ground with spurting
blood.
"And the stark naked truth of the
matter is simply this: the axe is the
symbol which most accurately
describes the subconscious
feelings of those loyal to Stanford
and California" toward the oppos
ing school.
And Will Irwin, according to
O'Neil, "put his finger unerringly
on this feeling, and came through
with the famous yell," which goes
as follows:
"Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, give 'em the Axe,
give 'em the Axe!
Where?
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, right in the neck,
right in the neck!
There!"
The Axe yell was born in 1896,
but some observers, including
Archie Cloud in his book "The
Stanford Axe," have noted that the
cadence of the yell imitates the
rhvthm of the chorus in the At

henian comedy "The Frogs,"
penned by Aristophanes some
2,000 years earlier.
Whether or not its creation was
the result of some Western Culture
plagiarism, the Axe yell was ini
tially the sole possession of Stan
ford rooters (and probably a tad
tiresome to the Berkeley faithful).
It was not until 1899 that anyone
had the idea of a real axe to accom
pany the Axe yell. And even then, it
was only because the Stanford
baseball team was in a crisis.
Facing California in April 1899 in
a best-of-three series to decide the
intercollegiate champion, the Stan
ford nine dropped the first contest.
Despairing Stanford backers
sensed that the team needed spe
cial inspiration before the second
contest. Yell-leader Billy Erb, along
with a few classmates, gathered
$4.50 and purchased a rusty
broadaxe which had a 14-inch
blade and weighed over 10
pounds. He painted the blade red
and attached a makeshift four-foot
handle.
At the huge bonfire rally two
nights before the baseball game,
Erb brought out the Axe, made a
big display of sharpening it on a
grindstone and then chopped the
head off a blue and gold-clad ef
figy-
The crowd responded wildly,
and two days later Erb appeared at
the ballgame (which was played at
old Recreation Park in downtown
San Franciso), brandishing the
blade menacingly in the faces of
the Berkeley rooters and leading
the Stanfordites in the Axe yell.
Although the Axe and yell ap
parently irked California's backers,
it had litle effect on the Bears team,
which rolled to a 9-7 victory to
wrap up the championship.
The Stanford fans felt betrayed

be their new totem and paid little
attention to the Axe's safety in the
aftermath of the disappointing loss.
It was entrusted to the keeping of
three Stanford men, who barely
got out the gate of the park before
they were jumped by a mob of
Bear bullies. The Berkeleyites
seized the Axe and dashed away.
A wild chase through the streets
of the City ensued. The thiefs
paused in a butcher shop long

enough to cut off the Axe's handle,
then made for the wharf, where,
concealing the head of the Axe,
they were able to sneak past a
gauntlet of San Francisco police
and Stanfordites, board a ferry and
ride to safety across the Bay.
Stanford students were outraged
by the theft. Raids between the two
school became rampant. So much
ill will was generated in the en
suing days that Stanford President
David Starr Jordan had to issue a
formal public admonition to the
Stanford student body, saying "Let
no old axe cut off our dignity and
self-respect." Eventually, both
schools' administrations agreed
that the Axe was Cal's "by right of
conquest" and outlawed all further
raids.
Still, recovery of the Axe
remained an all-consuming pas
sion on the Farm.
Meanwhile, Berkeley fans
adopted the Axe yell for their own
use, using it like salt in the wounds
of the Stanford faithful at every op
portunity. Each year in April,
Berkeley held a huge bonfire and
Axe rally in its Greek Theater.The
safekeeping of the weapon was
entrusted to the Axe Custodian,
usually a member of the California
baseball team, who was elected an
nually by vote of the student body.
When not out for its single annual
appearance at the rally, the Axe
was kept locked up in a bank vault
at the American Trust Company in
Berkeley.
For 31 years the Axe rested in
the hands of the Golden Bears,
"estranged from the Farm, its

After last year's Big Game, the exalted Axe was in Cardinal hands,
where it has remained ever since. Unable to steal it back as the
"Immortal 21" did in 1930, the Bears' only hope of regaining the

birthplace, and subjected to the
crazed gloatings of its malefac
tors," as the 1930 Quad said.
But in 1930 the Axe made a sud
den and glorious return to the
Farm.
A group of 21 Stanford under
graduates and recent graduates
(subsequently given the name
"The Immortal 21") had been plot
ting the recover)' of the Axe for
several years. Their attempts in
1928 and 1929 were foiled, but in
1930 their scheme was flawless.
On the eve of Cal's rally, April 3,
1930, the 21, led by Don Kropp,
drove in three cars to Berkeley.
Several of them were dressed as
Berkeley freshmen, the others as
newspapermen.
As the rally came to a close, four
of the Stanfordites, incon
spicuously clad in blue and gold
and posing as protectors of the
Axe, managed to attach themselves
to the armored car transporting
the Axe back to the bank. Mean
while, the others parked their cars
outside the bank and waited,
poised with fake cameras and a
tear gas bomb created in a
chemistry lab back at Stanford.
When the Axe, with its coterie of
guardians, arrived at the bank, the
bogus newsmen implored Axe
Custodian Norman Horner to pose
for a few photographs. They then
popped a bright flash in Horner's
eyes, blinding him momentarily.
The Stanfordites nabbed the Axe
and amid the tumult created by the
exploding tear gas bomb, passed it
quickly through the throng around
the bank, and whisked it into the
waiting getaway car.
Fifty minutes later, the Axe was
back on the Farm. Stanford stu
dents were exultant, rising from
their slumbers for an impromptu
late-night celebration.
News of the theft spread quickly,
inspiring hyperbolic prose and
oratory on both sides of the Bay.
The Daily's banner headline the
next day screamed "AXE
REGAINED!" in three- and-a-half
inch high letters. The Daily Califor
nian moaned "AXE STOLEN" in let
ters just as large.
"The Stanford Axe is Stanford's
once more," said The Daily in
reporting the event. "While the
Blue and Gold horde literally
slumbered on its feet last night, a
band of 20 intrepid wearers of the
Cardinal whisked the precious
implement from under the nose of
the Berkeleyans in whose posses
sion it had rested since that fatal
day in 1899, and brought it back to
the Stanford campus."
At a campus-wide rally honoring
the 21, Dan Evans, Class of '20,
spoke for the alumni, saying,
"During the last 31 years, there
hasn't been a Stanford man or
woman who hasn't dreamed of this
day."
The Axe itself, meanwhile, was
stored in Roble Hall its first night
on campus, then was moved to a
steel vault at the Palo Alto Ameri
can Trust Bank.

On the other side of the Bay, a
pall of gloom fell over the
Berkeley campus. Considerable
bitterness was directed toward the
Farm, manifested by several "hate
