# Miserable season leaves Cal hungry
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
Usually after any sports season,
the whole team goes out and has a
banquet to celebrate and reflect
upon a season's work and fun.
Sometimes, if the team did particu
larly well, the team may frequent a
fairly decent place — say a good
Italian restaurant.
This year, Joe Kapp's team may
have to plan on grazing at Sirloin
and Brew. Perhaps they'll have to
consider an order to go. Such has
been the season for the California
Golden Bears.
The Bears, picked by many
sports publications to finish at least
sixth in the Pacific 10, have proven
many a prognosticator woefully
wrong. Not only has California ce
mented itself in the veritable
bowels of the Pac-10, but it has also
suffered the indignity of losing to
not one, but two, Oregon schools
this season, a feat that has gone un
paralleled for countless years.
The California football follies
materialized slowly, eventually

snowballing until they hit full
iridescent bloom somewhere in
mid-season.
The opener, which began with
the aforementioned optimism,
came against an underrated Boston
College team that dominated from
the beginning, led by a defense
that stymied the Bear offensive at
tack. The 21-15 score was close, the
game wasn't.
Washington State entered next,
and with them, California mus
tered its first and only win streak.
At the time, the victory was appre
ciated but very much expected.
The horrible slide was soon to
ensue.
Indeed, the mighty streak of one
ended shortly thereafter, as the
Bears were systematically picked
apart by San Jose State quarterback
Mike Perez, who led the Spartans
to a 35-14 victory.
After the San Jose State upset,
Kapp tried to regroup, gamely at
tempted to turn over a new leaf,
but instead settled despondently
with turnovers. A fumble here, an
interception there.

Creatively turning the ball over
at will, the Bears bowed out quietly
to a superior Washington club 50-
18. Critics began to mumble. The
scenario of a shouting, endorphin
driven Joe Kapp urging his team
on became increasingly ques
tioned.
Fear not, said the Kapp groupies,
we have Oregon State next — at
home no less. Hardly noted for
their football prowess, the Beavers
showed the Pac-10 world that per
haps the Bears were, indeed,
miserable. Final score: Beavs 14,
Bears 12.
Infants, homeless orphans, Mr.
Rogers and Oski all began to
clamor in unison for the termina
tion of Kapp's regime. But Kapp,
bent on the old ways of football jin
goism, decided to steadfastly per
severe onward. Oh, that bear of a
man.
What followed was something
not safe or proper for younger
tikes to watch, let alone imitate. In
consecutive weeks, the Golden
Bear lost 36-10 to UCLA, 33-16 to
Arizona and, the coup de grace, 27-

9 to Oregon.
The wolves, including San
Francisco Chronicle columnist
Glenn Dickey, Kapp's presumed
godfather, hungrily pounced on
the bedeviled papa bear.
Literally on his last leg, Kapp
rallied the team for the Sun Devils
of Arizona State, the Pac-10 leader
and eventual champion. The result
was a pitiful 49-0 shutout, and the
California program lay all but com
atose.
Slowly and painfully, the Golden
Bear migrated south to play the
playboys of Southern Cal, the regu
lar season game before The Big
Game. The Trojans represented an
opportunity for an upset — that
much needed boost of spirit and
adrenaline.
Instead, the Bears opted for
grade-C Novocain, losing to the
men of further south 28-3. After
wards, Kapp poignantly en
capsuled the Bear effort for the
football neophyte, "The game was
typical of our season — we lost it,"
he said.
All that remains now for the 1-9

Bears is the traditional season
maker, the Big Game. Without
doubt, much of what California suf
fered through may be salvaged
with a victory over the bowl-bound
Cardinal.
The intangibles are there —
hatred for Stanford, a home crowd
and the wackiest mascot around,
the incomparable Oski, to lead the
crowd into a frenetic pitch.
But the Bears also have the final,
perhaps the most important, in
centive behind them, the "win
one-for-the-Kapper" attitude. And
if California converts on this final
big if, the season will be saved and
the team will not have to bring a
sack lunch to the postseason cere
mony.

Literally on his last leg, Kapp
rallied the team for the Sun Devils
of Arizona State, the Pac-10 leader
and eventual champion. The result
was a pitiful 49-0 shutout, and the
California program lay all but com
atose.
Slowly and painfully, the Golden
Bear migrated south to play the
playboys of Southern Cal, the regu
lar season game before The Big
Game. The Trojans represented an
opportunity for an upset — that
much needed boost of spirit and
adrenaline.
Instead, the Bears opted for
grade-C Novocain, losing to the
men of further south 28-3. After
wards, Kapp poignantly en
capsuled the Bear effort for the
football neophyte, "The game was
typical of our season — we lost it,"
he said.
All that remains now for the 1-9

Bears is the traditional season
maker, the Big Game. Without
doubt, much of what California suf
fered through may be salvaged
with a victory over the bowl-bound
Cardinal.
The intangibles are there —
hatred for Stanford, a home crowd
and the wackiest mascot around,
the incomparable Oski, to lead the
crowd into a frenetic pitch.
But the Bears also have the final,
perhaps the most important, in
centive behind them, the "win
one-for-the-Kapper" attitude. And
if California converts on this final
big if, the season will be saved and
the team will not have to bring a
sack lunch to the postseason cere
mony.
Usually after any sports season,
the whole team goes out and has a
banquet to celebrate and reflect
upon a season's work and fun.
Sometimes, if the team did particu
larly well, the team may frequent a
fairly decent place — say a good
Italian restaurant.
This year, Joe Kapp's team may
have to plan on grazing at Sirloin
and Brew. Perhaps they'll have to
consider an order to go. Such has
been the season for the California
Golden Bears.
The Bears, picked by many
sports publications to finish at least
sixth in the Pacific 10, have proven
many a prognosticator woefully
wrong. Not only has California ce
mented itself in the veritable
bowels of the Pac-10, but it has also
suffered the indignity of losing to
not one, but two, Oregon schools
this season, a feat that has gone un
paralleled for countless years.
The California football follies
materialized slowly, eventually

snowballing until they hit full
iridescent bloom somewhere in
mid-season.
The opener, which began with
the aforementioned optimism,
came against an underrated Boston
College team that dominated from
the beginning, led by a defense
that stymied the Bear offensive at
tack. The 21-15 score was close, the
game wasn't.
Washington State entered next,
and with them, California mus
tered its first and only win streak.
At the time, the victory was appre
ciated but very much expected.
The horrible slide was soon to
ensue.
Indeed, the mighty streak of one
ended shortly thereafter, as the
Bears were systematically picked
apart by San Jose State quarterback
Mike Perez, who led the Spartans
to a 35-14 victory.
After the San Jose State upset,
Kapp tried to regroup, gamely at
tempted to turn over a new leaf,
but instead settled despondently
with turnovers. A fumble here, an
interception there.

Creatively turning the ball over
at will, the Bears bowed out quietly
to a superior Washington club 50-
18. Critics began to mumble. The
scenario of a shouting, endorphin
driven Joe Kapp urging his team
on became increasingly ques
tioned.
Fear not, said the Kapp groupies,
we have Oregon State next — at
home no less. Hardly noted for
their football prowess, the Beavers
showed the Pac-10 world that per
haps the Bears were, indeed,
miserable. Final score: Beavs 14,
Bears 12.
Infants, homeless orphans, Mr.
Rogers and Oski all began to
clamor in unison for the termina
tion of Kapp's regime. But Kapp,
bent on the old ways of football jin
goism, decided to steadfastly per
severe onward. Oh, that bear of a
man.
What followed was something
not safe or proper for younger
tikes to watch, let alone imitate. In
consecutive weeks, the Golden
Bear lost 36-10 to UCLA, 33-16 to
Arizona and, the coup de grace, 27-

9 to Oregon.
The wolves, including San
Francisco Chronicle columnist
Glenn Dickey, Kapp's presumed
godfather, hungrily pounced on
the bedeviled papa bear.
Literally on his last leg, Kapp
rallied the team for the Sun Devils
