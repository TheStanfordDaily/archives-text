# Disgruntled Bears reveal the truth
## 
### CHRIS RIBACK MICHAEL SILVER Daily Californian editorial staff 
Chris Riback and Michael Silver,
the sports editors of the Daily
Californian, the UC-Berkeley stu
dent newspaper, gratiously agreed
to share their first-hand sentiments
on this year's disappointing Cali
fornia football season.
The 1986 California Golden
Bear football season began with
nothing but promise, or so we
were told.
California was going to make it
to a bowl game. Hardy Nickerson
Would rant and rave his way
straight into the National Football
League. Marc Hicks would be an
All-America tailback. Brian Bedford
would become a first-class quarter
back.
A team that had lost four games
by a total of 10 points while finish
ing 4-7 the season before would
put it all together in Joe Kapp's fifth
year. As the coach himself said,
"The smell of Bear is in the air."
Well, the smell of something
else is in the air now. Pass the lysol,
please.
The bad news Bears have made
it all the way to the bottom — Cali
fornia's greatest di-stink-tion in this
pungent season is its No. 1 ranking
in the nationally syndicated
"Bottom Ten" column. Yes, the
Bears are No.l, but, come to think
of it, they're actually more like
number two.
Now Kapp is headed out the
door, with only a single "win one
for the zipper" speech standing be
tween him and unemployment.
California is 1-9 with a school
record 10th loss looming in the
distance. Yes, 1-10 would be the
worst record of any Golden Bear
football team this century.
The last time the Bears had a
season this bad, Grover Cleveland
was the president of the United
States
Just how long ago was that? A
guy who was named after him,
major league pitcher Grover
Cleveland Alexander, has already
come and gone to the big baseball
diamond in the sky. And the actor

who portrayed Alexander in the
movie about his life is in his last
days as ... Well, there we go again.
But don't be too harsh on us.
We, like everybody else who heard
the Kappaganda, have a right to be
upset. After listening to the coach
and his players talk about how im
proved they were, we actually
started to believe them.
Sure, the Bears were going to a
bowl game. Now the only
postseason games considering the
Bears are the Dispica-bowl, the
Disreputa-bowl and, most of all,
the Hyper-bowl.
If there's one good thing that
can be said about the Bears, it's
that everything they touch turns to
gold. Out of the 10 opponents Cali
fornia has faced so far, seven are
headed for bonafide bowl games,
and the 11th, Stanford, is already
on its way to two of them — don't
forget the Nov. 29 Sushi Bowl
against Arizona.
First came Boston College,
which certainly looked like it was
playing B.C. football against Cal.
But the Bears fumbled and
bumbled that one away, and now
the probably bowl-bound Eagles
are 7-3.
Then, after beating Washington
State 31-21 (despite showing up
for only one quarter), Cal lost to
San Jose State, 35-14. Now the 9-2
Spartans, who are going to the Cal
ifornia Bowl as champions of the
Pacific Coast Athletic Association,
are one of the year's biggest
surprises.
Coincidence? Probably. But
partly because of the preseason
optimism, 1986 has definitely been
more frustrating to California fans
than the average, well, below
average, 1-9 season.
For one thing, it's been longer.
Since Kapp was fired two weeks
ago, the Bears have been a candi
date for euthanasia. And the youth
in Asia tould probably have played
better football.

It's also been filled with bad
luck. "I thought Murphy was an
Irishman," said Kapp, who is
Mexican.
But Kapp isn't the only distress
story from this year's team. Bed
ford, after trying for nearly two
years to become a college quarter
back, was finally pulled in favor of
freshman Troy Taylor and
switched to wide receiver five
games ago.
While at quarterback, Bedford
caught two passes — two more
than he's caught as a wide receiver.
Just as Kapp promised when Bed
ford came to Berkeley, he has not
made a receiver out of Bedford.
And then there is Hicks, the one
time California football savior
gone sour. After gaining 40 yards
in the first quarter of the first game
at BC, Hicks has rushed for only
324 more and has lost his starting
job to Chris Richards.
At least Hicks, Kapp and the rest
aren't saying much anymore.
Praised be! It's been a long season,
and boy are our ears tired.
