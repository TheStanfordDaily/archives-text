# Cardinal faces Cal in 89th Big Game
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Stanford vs. California. Big
Game. It's the biggest annual sport
ing event in Northern California
and the traditional final game for
both teams.
For Stanford, though, it isn't.
Prior to the start of the season, the
Stanford-Arizona match was
moved to Tokyo as the Coca-Cola
Bowl next week for the regular
season finale. And the Cardinal
learned this week that at 4 p.m. Sat
urday officials from the Dec. 27
Gator Bowl will present a contract
to Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
sealing a Stanford-Clemson
matchup in the Cardinal's first
postseason game in eight -years.
For Cal, it's more than the last
game of the season. It's the last
game in the coaching career of Joe
Kapp. The last quarterback to lead
the Bears to the Rose Bowl, back in
the 1958 season, Kapp had hoped
to bring them back as a coach. In
stead, he enters his last Big Game
with a 19-34-1 record.
At a luncheon Wednesday which
Kapp did not attend, KCBS an
nouncer Bob Murphy emphasized
the positives of Kapp's association
with Cal. "I hope he's remembered
for the player he was," Murphy
said, "not the coach who didn't
show up today, not the coach who
was fired by Cal."
But Kapp may be remembered
as the coach of the losingest Cal
team in 105 years of football. This
year's 1-9 team is a Big Game loss
away from becoming the first Cal
team to lose 10 games in a season.
And the frustration in Berkeley
has become painfully apparent. In
the most celebrated incident,
when a reporter asked Kapp
whether his job was in jeopardy
following a loss, Kapp unzipped

his fly and asked if the reporter
were interested in seeing what lay
inside.
Asked about his feelings going
into his final game, Kapp appropri
ately responded, "My emotions:
I've exposed myself many, many
times. My emotions are my emo
tions."
And a 1-9 season also makes Big
Game emotional for the Cal
players as well. "This is our bowl
game," wide receiver Wendell
Peoples said. "I think that's the atti
tude everyone hits."
"It's been a tough 10 weeks of
practice getting up for Big Game,"
center Chuck Steele said. "Big
Game is all we have left. It's not
just our last game — it's our last
chance to gain some self-respect."
Meanwhile, the Cardinal has to
avoid the obvious tendency to look
past Cal to the Arizona game,
which could decide second place
in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
the Gator Bowl, which will be na
tionally televised and possibly for a
top-10 ranking.
"Taking Cal for granted is the
biggest mistake we could make,"
Elway said.
Last week, Cal played USC per
haps closer than expected, losing
28-3. Kapp's analysis of that con
test: "That game was typical of our
season — we lost the football
game."
The Bears also lost freshman
quarterback Troy Taylor for the
season with a broken jaw. Taylor
had completed 58 percent of his
passes for 891 yards with one
touchdown and eight interceptions
since assuming the starting role
midway through the season.
His replacement is expected to
be fifth-year senior Kevin Brown,
though junior Brian Howe could
see action. Kapp wasn't saying
which. "You name these things at

game time," he said. "Kevin has the
most experience. Howe played the
fourth quarter Saturday. I think un
less we go to the single-wing, it'll
be one of those two. "
"I don't really know if it'll be a
real change," Stanford defensive
tackle Tony Leiker said. "I guess
Brown's not as mobile as Taylor."
"Kevin's a fifth-year quarter
back," Peoples said. "He knows the
program. I think he's a good quar
terback."

On the Stanford side, quarter
hack John Paye has had a week off
to rest his shoulder. Paye received
a cortisone shot in the shoulder 10
days ago and is not expected to
have any problems Saturday.
The week off was the first mid
season break for the Cardinal since
1980. A 6-4 Stanford team came off
that rest looking at a possible
Peach Bowl berth, but a 28-23 win
by a 2-8 Cal team ended those
dreams. Similarly, a highly dis
putable five-lateral kickoff return
after Mark Harmon's field goal had
given Stanford a 20-19 victory in
1982 gave the Cardinal a 5-6 finish
and ended any hope of a Hall of
Fame Bowl bid.
So, heading back into Memorial
Stadium with a Gator Bowl bid
assured, Elway can perhaps relax a
bit. "Having the bowl bid, as far as
I'm concerned, is good," he said.
"But it's important for us to con
centrate on continuing to win.
We've got a real good opportunity
to finish second in the Pac-10.
That's something that's important
to us."
Cal has no pressure, except per
haps to finish ahead of Oregon
State out of the Pac-10 cellar. "On
defense, they're going to be ag
gressive and want to come after
us," Elway said. "On offense, they
could come out with different
things and look for the big play.
The motivation they have at this
point is that they can salvage a dis
appointing season. We have to go
into the football game and expect
the unexpected. They can let cau
tion go to the wind."
It was two years ago in Berkeley
that running back Brad Muster

rushed 34 times for 204 yards in a
27-10 Stanford win. Muster has
been used just as much the past
two weeks in victories over Wash
ington State and UCLA, carrying a
total of 75 times for 373 yards.
"We're going to use him as a
decoy, Elway quipped. "There
won't be any question that they
have to prove they can stop Brad, i
think the offensive line has been
together and improving as a unit.
They've been getting on people
and allowing Brad to use it."

Kapp astutely summed up what
Cal needs to do to pull off the up
set. "Stopping Brad Muster and
John Paye and getting points on the
board.''
Kapp, however, was at a loss
how to do that. He has little time
left to figure it out.

Much to the dismay of UCLA's star tailback, Gaston Green,'' Stanford nose guard Ray Huckestein has
found a second home behind the line of scrimmage. The sophomore has anchored a Cardinal
defense which is currently ranked first in the conference in turnover ratio and 15th in the nation
against the run. Against the Bruins, Huckestein collected a career high 11 tackles to raise his
season total to 41. • -

Cardinal tailback Brad Muster carrying the ball has been a familiar sight for Stanford fans the las',

season with a broken jaw. Taylor
had completed 58 percent of his
passes for 891 yards with one
touchdown and eight interceptions
since assuming the starting role
midway through the season.
His replacement is expected to
be fifth-year senior Kevin Brown,
though junior Brian Howe could
see action. Kapp wasn't saying
which. "You name these things at

game time," he said. "Kevin has the
most experience. Howe played the
fourth quarter Saturday. I think un
less we go to the single-wing, it'll
be one of those two. "
"I don't really know if it'll be a
real change," Stanford defensive
tackle Tony Leiker said. "I guess
Brown's not as mobile as Taylor."
"Kevin's a fifth-year quarter
back," Peoples said. "He knows the
program. I think he's a good quar
terback."

On the Stanford side, quarter
hack John Paye has had a week off
to rest his shoulder. Paye received
a cortisone shot in the shoulder 10
days ago and is not expected to
have any problems Saturday.
The week off was the first mid
season break for the Cardinal since
1980. A 6-4 Stanford team came off
that rest looking at a possible
Peach Bowl berth, but a 28-23 win
by a 2-8 Cal team ended those
dreams. Similarly, a highly dis
putable five-lateral kickoff return
after Mark Harmon's field goal had
given Stanford a 20-19 victory in
1982 gave the Cardinal a 5-6 finish
and ended any hope of a Hall of
Fame Bowl bid.
So, heading back into Memorial
Stadium with a Gator Bowl bid
assured, Elway can perhaps relax a
bit. "Having the bowl bid, as far as
I'm concerned, is good," he said.
"But it's important for us to con
centrate on continuing to win.
We've got a real good opportunity
to finish second in the Pac-10.
That's something that's important
to us."
Cal has no pressure, except per
haps to finish ahead of Oregon
State out of the Pac-10 cellar. "On
defense, they're going to be ag
gressive and want to come after
us," Elway said. "On offense, they
could come out with different
things and look for the big play.
The motivation they have at this
point is that they can salvage a dis
appointing season. We have to go
into the football game and expect
the unexpected. They can let cau
tion go to the wind."
It was two years ago in Berkeley
that running back Brad Muster

rushed 34 times for 204 yards in a
27-10 Stanford win. Muster has
been used just as much the past
two weeks in victories over Wash
ington State and UCLA, carrying a
total of 75 times for 373 yards.
"We're going to use him as a
decoy, Elway quipped. "There
won't be any question that they
have to prove they can stop Brad, i
think the offensive line has been
together and improving as a unit.
They've been getting on people
and allowing Brad to use it."

Kapp, however, was at a loss
how to do that. He has little time
left to figure it out.

Much to the dismay of UCLA's star tailback, Gaston Green,'' Stanford nose guard Ray Huckestein has
found a second home behind the line of scrimmage. The sophomore has anchored a Cardinal
defense which is currently ranked first in the conference in turnover ratio and 15th in the nation
against the run. Against the Bruins, Huckestein collected a career high 11 tackles to raise his
season total to 41. • -

Cardinal tailback Brad Muster carrying the ball has been a familiar sight for Stanford fans the las',
two games. Against Washington State Muster's 37 carries set a Stanford record, which he promptly
broke the following week at UCLA by carrying 38 times. Anyone for 39 on Saturday?
Stanford vs. California. Big
Game. It's the biggest annual sport
ing event in Northern California
and the traditional final game for
both teams.
For Stanford, though, it isn't.
Prior to the start of the season, the
Stanford-Arizona match was
moved to Tokyo as the Coca-Cola
Bowl next week for the regular
season finale. And the Cardinal
learned this week that at 4 p.m. Sat
urday officials from the Dec. 27
Gator Bowl will present a contract
to Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
sealing a Stanford-Clemson
matchup in the Cardinal's first
postseason game in eight -years.
For Cal, it's more than the last
game of the season. It's the last
game in the coaching career of Joe
Kapp. The last quarterback to lead
the Bears to the Rose Bowl, back in
the 1958 season, Kapp had hoped
to bring them back as a coach. In
stead, he enters his last Big Game
with a 19-34-1 record.
At a luncheon Wednesday which
Kapp did not attend, KCBS an
nouncer Bob Murphy emphasized
the positives of Kapp's association
with Cal. "I hope he's remembered
for the player he was," Murphy
said, "not the coach who didn't
show up today, not the coach who
was fired by Cal."
But Kapp may be remembered
as the coach of the losingest Cal
team in 105 years of football. This
year's 1-9 team is a Big Game loss
away from becoming the first Cal
team to lose 10 games in a season.
And the frustration in Berkeley
has become painfully apparent. In
the most celebrated incident,
when a reporter asked Kapp
whether his job was in jeopardy
following a loss, Kapp unzipped

his fly and asked if the reporter
were interested in seeing what lay
inside.
Asked about his feelings going
into his final game, Kapp appropri
ately responded, "My emotions:
I've exposed myself many, many
times. My emotions are my emo
tions."
And a 1-9 season also makes Big
Game emotional for the Cal
players as well. "This is our bowl
game," wide receiver Wendell
Peoples said. "I think that's the atti
tude everyone hits."
"It's been a tough 10 weeks of
practice getting up for Big Game,"
center Chuck Steele said. "Big
Game is all we have left. It's not
just our last game — it's our last
chance to gain some self-respect."
Meanwhile, the Cardinal has to
avoid the obvious tendency to look
past Cal to the Arizona game,
which could decide second place
in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
the Gator Bowl, which will be na
tionally televised and possibly for a
top-10 ranking.
"Taking Cal for granted is the
biggest mistake we could make,"
Elway said.
Last week, Cal played USC per
haps closer than expected, losing
28-3. Kapp's analysis of that con
test: "That game was typical of our
season — we lost the football
game."
The Bears also lost freshman
quarterback Troy Taylor for the
season with a broken jaw. Taylor
had completed 58 percent of his
passes for 891 yards with one
touchdown and eight interceptions
since assuming the starting role
midway through the season.

Kapp astutely summed up what
Cal needs to do to pull off the up
set. "Stopping Brad Muster and
John Paye and getting points on the
board.''
Kapp, however, was at a loss
how to do that. He has little time
left to figure it out.

Much to the dismay of UCLA's star tailback, Gaston Green,'' Stanford nose guard Ray Huckestein has
found a second home behind the line of scrimmage. The sophomore has anchored a Cardinal
defense which is currently ranked first in the conference in turnover ratio and 15th in the nation
against the run. Against the Bruins, Huckestein collected a career high 11 tackles to raise his
season total to 41. • -

Cardinal tailback Brad Muster carrying the ball has been a familiar sight for Stanford fans the las',
two games. Against Washington State Muster's 37 carries set a Stanford record, which he promptly
broke the following week at UCLA by carrying 38 times. Anyone for 39 on Saturday?
Stanford vs. California. Big
Game. It's the biggest annual sport
ing event in Northern California
and the traditional final game for
both teams.
For Stanford, though, it isn't.
Prior to the start of the season, the
Stanford-Arizona match was
moved to Tokyo as the Coca-Cola
Bowl next week for the regular
season finale. And the Cardinal
learned this week that at 4 p.m. Sat
urday officials from the Dec. 27
Gator Bowl will present a contract
to Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
sealing a Stanford-Clemson
matchup in the Cardinal's first
postseason game in eight -years.
For Cal, it's more than the last
game of the season. It's the last
game in the coaching career of Joe
Kapp. The last quarterback to lead
the Bears to the Rose Bowl, back in
the 1958 season, Kapp had hoped
to bring them back as a coach. In
stead, he enters his last Big Game
with a 19-34-1 record.
At a luncheon Wednesday which
Kapp did not attend, KCBS an
nouncer Bob Murphy emphasized
the positives of Kapp's association
with Cal. "I hope he's remembered
for the player he was," Murphy
said, "not the coach who didn't
show up today, not the coach who
was fired by Cal."
But Kapp may be remembered
as the coach of the losingest Cal
team in 105 years of football. This
year's 1-9 team is a Big Game loss
away from becoming the first Cal
team to lose 10 games in a season.
And the frustration in Berkeley
has become painfully apparent. In
the most celebrated incident,
when a reporter asked Kapp
whether his job was in jeopardy
following a loss, Kapp unzipped

his fly and asked if the reporter
were interested in seeing what lay
inside.
Asked about his feelings going
into his final game, Kapp appropri
ately responded, "My emotions:
I've exposed myself many, many
times. My emotions are my emo
tions."
And a 1-9 season also makes Big
Game emotional for the Cal
players as well. "This is our bowl
game," wide receiver Wendell
Peoples said. "I think that's the atti
tude everyone hits."
"It's been a tough 10 weeks of
practice getting up for Big Game,"
center Chuck Steele said. "Big
Game is all we have left. It's not
just our last game — it's our last
chance to gain some self-respect."
Meanwhile, the Cardinal has to
avoid the obvious tendency to look
past Cal to the Arizona game,
which could decide second place
in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
the Gator Bowl, which will be na
tionally televised and possibly for a
top-10 ranking.
"Taking Cal for granted is the
biggest mistake we could make,"
Elway said.
Last week, Cal played USC per
haps closer than expected, losing
28-3. Kapp's analysis of that con
test: "That game was typical of our
season — we lost the football
game."
The Bears also lost freshman
quarterback Troy Taylor for the
season with a broken jaw. Taylor
had completed 58 percent of his
passes for 891 yards with one
touchdown and eight interceptions
since assuming the starting role
midway through the season.
His replacement is expected to
be fifth-year senior Kevin Brown,
though junior Brian Howe could
see action. Kapp wasn't saying
which. "You name these things at

game time," he said. "Kevin has the
most experience. Howe played the
fourth quarter Saturday. I think un
less we go to the single-wing, it'll
be one of those two. "
"I don't really know if it'll be a
real change," Stanford defensive
tackle Tony Leiker said. "I guess
Brown's not as mobile as Taylor."
"Kevin's a fifth-year quarter
back," Peoples said. "He knows the
program. I think he's a good quar
terback."

On the Stanford side, quarter
hack John Paye has had a week off
to rest his shoulder. Paye received
a cortisone shot in the shoulder 10
days ago and is not expected to
have any problems Saturday.
The week off was the first mid
season break for the Cardinal since
1980. A 6-4 Stanford team came off
that rest looking at a possible
Peach Bowl berth, but a 28-23 win
by a 2-8 Cal team ended those
dreams. Similarly, a highly dis
putable five-lateral kickoff return
after Mark Harmon's field goal had
given Stanford a 20-19 victory in
1982 gave the Cardinal a 5-6 finish
and ended any hope of a Hall of
Fame Bowl bid.
So, heading back into Memorial
Stadium with a Gator Bowl bid
assured, Elway can perhaps relax a
bit. "Having the bowl bid, as far as
I'm concerned, is good," he said.
"But it's important for us to con
centrate on continuing to win.
We've got a real good opportunity
to finish second in the Pac-10.
That's something that's important
to us."
Cal has no pressure, except per
haps to finish ahead of Oregon
State out of the Pac-10 cellar. "On
defense, they're going to be ag
gressive and want to come after
us," Elway said. "On offense, they
could come out with different
things and look for the big play.
The motivation they have at this
point is that they can salvage a dis
appointing season. We have to go
into the football game and expect
the unexpected. They can let cau
tion go to the wind."
It was two years ago in Berkeley
that running back Brad Muster

rushed 34 times for 204 yards in a
27-10 Stanford win. Muster has
been used just as much the past
two weeks in victories over Wash
ington State and UCLA, carrying a
total of 75 times for 373 yards.
"We're going to use him as a
decoy, Elway quipped. "There
won't be any question that they
have to prove they can stop Brad, i
think the offensive line has been
together and improving as a unit.
They've been getting on people
and allowing Brad to use it."
