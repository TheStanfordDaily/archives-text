Stanford

Yes, Brown is a senior, but he's
the Bears' third choice at quarter
back. Yes, he played in last year's
Big Game, but this year California
Coach Joe Kapp went to junior
Brian Bedford and freshman Troy
Taylor at quarterback before going
to Brown. The Stanford defense
hasn't suffered a letdown yet this
year, and linebacker Dave
Wyman's quiet but consistent lead
ership may help prevent one Satur
day afternoon.

If Brown can connect on some
passes, Devers will probably be the
one making the catches. The soph
omore has snagged 33 receptions
for a big average of 14.6 yards per
catch. From the free safety posi
tion, Harris leads the Cardinal
bend-but-not-break secondary.
Stanford is ninth in the Pacific 10 in
passing defense, but has allowed
only five touchdowns through the
air.

Majett Whiteside may have a
cool name, but he'll be up against a
Stanford offensive line that has
become more calm and collected
as the year has progressed. Actu
ally, Whiteside may be the most
talented nose guard the Cardinal
has faced all season. But Sinclair's
confidence level after Stanford's
last two big rushing games must be
miles above Whiteside and com
pany's.

"Brad Muster has improved my
play selection tremendously,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said
Monday. Muster needs 114 yards to
get 1,000 on the year, and, if he
gets those, the Axe should stay at
Stanford. Nickerson was a strong
pro prospect at the beginning of
the season, but California's dismal
record has not highlighted his play
this year.

Heaven forbid it comes down to
the kicking game. But if it does,
California would seem to have the
advantage. Maybe. Rix is 11-for-15
on the year and has missed only
twice inside 40 yards. But Rix
missed a possible game-winning
field goal in last year's Big Game.
Sweeney is 3-for-12 and has not
made a field goal outside of 30
yards. He has missed six straight.
