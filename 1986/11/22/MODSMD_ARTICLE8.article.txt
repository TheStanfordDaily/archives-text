# Cardinal year in review
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
For ardent Cardinal football
fans,' 1986 has been a long time
coming. Seniors remember the
1983 1-10 season, consecutive
losing seasons and the cries of
many for Stanford to abandon big
time football. After all, 1978, the
year of the Cardinal's last bowl ap
pearence, was so long ago that the
team was known as the Cardinals.
But behold, as the song says, it's
all right now. Going into Saturday's
89th renewal of the Big Game, the
Cardinal gridders have a chance to
post their best season since 1977,
when the team finished 9-3, dum
ping LSU in the Sun Bowl 24-14.
This year, however, even the
casual observer could sense there
was something up down on the
Farm. The days of mediocre Stan
ford football were gone. The Card
inal was charged by the coaches to
win all the games it was supposed
to and even pull some upsets. The
team was to be revitalized on
defense and maintain the same

level of offensive play that put Stan-.
ford on the football map.
And it did. When the team broke
camp and headed South for its first
test against perennial Southwest
Conference powerhouse Texas, it
was obvious that Stanford football
fans were in for one great season.
Stanford 30, Texas 21
From the opening kickoff, Stan
ford went right to work and racked
up 14 quick points on the way to its
first non-conference road win
since 1982. As in the 1985 contest,
receiver Jeff James and quarter
back John Paye put on an ex
traordinary aerial show. Paye
threw for 241 yards and three
touchdowns. All the touchdowns
went to James, who finished the
day with nine catches for 162
yards.
Along the way, the Stanford
defense established a tempo that
would continue throughout the
year. Led by fifth-year senior
linebacker David Wyman and
senior cornerback Toi Cook, the

defense virtually shut down the
Texas offense and created a reputa
tion for hard-nosed, aggressive
play.
Stanford 28, San Jose St. 10
The Cardinal returned trium
phantly the week after dumping
the Longhorns to face perennial
nemesis San Jose State. It was the
home opener for Stanford, and the
team did not let its fans down. In
the past, the Spartans had been a
thorn in Stanford's side, but this
year the team had developed
enough character to win even the
"small'' games.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
quick lead in the first quarter, but
then relied on the defense to
protect the lead. It was not until
the fourth quarter that the offense
began to move again, after being
shut out in the third.
Stanford 17, Oregon State 7
The Cardinal opened the 1986
Pacific 10 Conference chase on the


Jack El way Adam Grossman/Daily file
road in Corvallis, Ore., against the
Beavers. This was the day when the
Stanford faithful would find out
whether Stanford could win the
"easy" ones.
This game, like most of the
others this season, was marked by
tenacious defense. Going into the
final 11 minutes of the game, the
Stanford defense was aiming for a
shutout, but lost it on a question
able catch by OSU receiver Pat
Chaffey. Despite the touchdown,
Stanford held on to win its confer
ence opener.
"We wanted the shutout," said
Wyman of the OSU game. "We
were excited about that, but we
still got a Pac-10 win."
Refering to the sluggish offense,
running back Brad Muster said,
"It's exciting. .. . We know we
don't have to score 34 points to
win, so I'm not concerned about
the offense right now."
Stanford 17, San Diego St. 10
The last time it happened was
1952. Truman was president, and

the Stanford Indians were 4-0. It
took 34 years, but history did
repeat itself. The Cardinal chalked
up its fourth win against no losses.
This game had more signifi
cance attached to it than just a per
fect record — it was these very
same Aztecs that handed Stanford
its most embarrassing loss a year
ago. There was definitely payback
on the minds of the Stanford
players.
"That (SDSU) game was so bad
... I kind of wanted to walk onto
the highway and get hit by a truck,"
said Elway in reference to his
teams 41-22 debacle.
Stanford used its best weapons,
Muster and a stifling defense, to
capture the win. Muster banged
out 115 yards on 21 carries for one
touchdown, and the defense sel
dom let the Aztecs within scoring
range.
Although Stanford won, it lost
cornerback Toi Cook to a severe
wrist injury. He was feared to be
lost for the season but returned
against USC.
Washington 24, Stanford 14
The bubble had to burst
sometime, but there could have
been a better time. Off to its best

stan in years and ranked 18th in
the country, the Cardinal faced its
first major test of the season on na
tional television. And for 55
minutes, the Cardinal looked like it
was going to be 5-0.
Stanford played flawlessly
through most of the game. Paye
and his offense moved the ball ef
fectively but were not able to post
more than 14 points, on two Paye
touchdown passes. Paye finished
the day with 349 yards through the
air.
It looked like 14 points were
enough, though, as the Cardinal
led 14-10 going into the fourth per
iod. The Stanford defense seemed
it would be able to hold off the
Huskies all day until quarterback
Chris Chandler found Lonzell Hill
behind Stanford's Pat Kelly for a
42-yard touchdown pass.
The Cardinal had two opportu
nities to tie the game, but kicker
David Sweeney started his embar
rassing streak of missed field goals,
shanking two. The Stanford team
would not die, however. Late in the
final period, Paye drove his team
down into Husky territory, but
could not convert a fourth-down
play. After that, a tired defense gave
up one more score.

Stanford 41, Oregon 7
After a disheartening loss to the
Huskies, the Cardinal broke loose
against Oregon, returning the fa
vor of last year's ugly defeat. Paye
and his cohorts silenced their crit
ics by putting the game away early
in the first half.
The highlight of the game was
Thomas Henley's electrifying 92-
yard punt return for a touchdown.
Henley's scamper was the longest
in Stanford history, breaking a
record dating back to Murray Cud
deback's 80-yarder back in 1923.
USC 10, Stanford 0
The scene was set. Stanford had
the largest home crowd in the Pac
-10 this year,, a national television
audience and an Associated Press
ranking of 19th.
On defense, the Cardinal was
masterful. It denied USC a touch
down on all but one possession.
The defense was especially spec
tacular during a goal-line stand.
The Trojans had four cracks from
the 1-yard line, but could not get
any further than the Stanford 1-foot
line. Wyman collected 27 tackles in
the game. That is a season for some
players
While the defense was rock
solid, the hapless offense could get
no further than the USC 38. The
Trojans made use of five and
sometimes six defensive backs in
an "invert" type of defense. By
lining up the backs in a straight
line, USC was able to diguise its
coverage and befuddle Paye.
Stanford also made a critical
mistake by not running the ball.
The Cardinal only rushed 11 times
for 47 yards.

"We had to have a better day
running," Elway said. "I'm not sure
I gave them the chance to have a
better game running."
Stanford 42, "Washington St. 12
With the dissappointment of
USC still fresh in the players'
minds, the Cardinal set out to
bounce back against the WSU
Cougars. A win would make the
team's record 6-2 and keep it in the
thick of the bowl hunt.
On this day, Stanford's gameplan
could be summed up in one word
— Muster. Big Brad was respon
sible for 274 yards of offense him
self, including 181 on the ground
on 35 carries. His 35 carries set a
new, albeit short-lived, Stanford
record for most carries in a game.
With the WSU defense worrying
about how to stop a 6-foot-3,
226-pound halfback, Paye was able
to bounce back, throwing for 214
yards and one touchdown and
scoring another two himself.
On defense, the Cardinal
stymied its opponent once again.
WSU was known for its option of
fense, but it didn't show in this
game. The defensive game was
highlighted by a one-handed inter
ception by Wyman.
Wyman's pick was very appro
priate. He and 19 other seniors
were making their final ap
pearence in Stanford Stadium.
Stanford 28, UCLA 23
Sportswriters have a tendency to
blow things out of proportion, but
the Cardinal's win over the Bruins
was certainly one of the most im
portant victories in years. It was on
this trip to the Rose Bowl (the
stadium, not the game) that Stan
ford assured itself of getting its first
bowl bid in eight long years.
Behind a strong but bandless
student contingent, the Cardinal
dismissed UCLA in grand fashion
in front of yet another television
audience. How was it done?
Simple. The coaches followed a
formula: If a little Muster is good,
then a lot will be great.

The Muster express piled up an
other 190 yards including a dra
matic 74-yard dash to the UCIA 15.
That run set up a 15-yard Paye-to-
James touchdown pass. Fortunately
for Paye, the running game was on
track. The senior was nursing a
sore shoulder and only threw 22
times.
It was only fitting that the
defense save this one, however.
After a whole year of solid play, the
defensive squad had the chance to
seal its team's fate. Toi Cook, a
literal one-armed bandit, stole a
Matt Stevens pass and returned it
to the UCLA 9. Three plays later,
Muster scored to ice it for the
Cardinal.
The Bruins tried to scare Stan

ford a few times more, but the
defense and the referee fixed that.
UCLA was driving late in the game
for what could have been a win
ning score, but safety Brad
Humphreys shut the door when he
stuffed Gaston Green short of a
first down, giving the Cardinal the
ball and the chance to run out the
clock.
Although it seemed simple
enough to kill the clock, Stanford
got a scare doing so. UCLA's
nose guard slapped the ball
skyward before Stanford center
Andy Sinclair could snap it, and the
Bruins fell on it. An alert referee
and some coaxing by Sinclair,
however, gave Stanford the ball, a
7-2 record and an assured bowl
bid.
"That was the greatest feeling in
the world," linebacker Chris
Weber said of stopping UCLA on
their last play. "I was running
around the field — I didn't want to
come off."
