# Cardinal year in review
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
For ardent Cardinal football
fans,' 1986 has been a long time
coming. Seniors remember the
1983 1-10 season, consecutive
losing seasons and the cries of
many for Stanford to abandon big
time football. After all, 1978, the
year of the Cardinal's last bowl ap
pearence, was so long ago that the
team was known as the Cardinals.
But behold, as the song says, it's
all right now. Going into Saturday's
89th renewal of the Big Game, the
Cardinal gridders have a chance to
post their best season since 1977,
when the team finished 9-3, dum
ping LSU in the Sun Bowl 24-14.
This year, however, even the
casual observer could sense there
was something up down on the
Farm. The days of mediocre Stan
ford football were gone. The Card
inal was charged by the coaches to
win all the games it was supposed
to and even pull some upsets. The
team was to be revitalized on
defense and maintain the same

level of offensive play that put Stan-.
ford on the football map.
And it did. When the team broke
camp and headed South for its first
test against perennial Southwest
Conference powerhouse Texas, it
was obvious that Stanford football
fans were in for one great season.

From the opening kickoff, Stan
ford went right to work and racked
up 14 quick points on the way to its
first non-conference road win
since 1982. As in the 1985 contest,
receiver Jeff James and quarter
back John Paye put on an ex
traordinary aerial show. Paye
threw for 241 yards and three
touchdowns. All the touchdowns
went to James, who finished the
day with nine catches for 162
yards.
Along the way, the Stanford
defense established a tempo that
would continue throughout the
year. Led by fifth-year senior
linebacker David Wyman and
senior cornerback Toi Cook, the

defense virtually shut down the
Texas offense and created a reputa
tion for hard-nosed, aggressive
play.

The Cardinal returned trium
phantly the week after dumping
the Longhorns to face perennial
nemesis San Jose State. It was the
home opener for Stanford, and the
team did not let its fans down. In
the past, the Spartans had been a
thorn in Stanford's side, but this
year the team had developed
enough character to win even the
"small'' games.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
quick lead in the first quarter, but
then relied on the defense to
protect the lead. It was not until
the fourth quarter that the offense
began to move again, after being
shut out in the third.
