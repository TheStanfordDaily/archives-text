Stanford football highlights
featuring wide receiver Jeff
James Take one.
Roll tape one Under three
minutes to go in Big Game, 1985.
Stanford hanging on to 24-22 lead,
facing third-and-22 from its own
8-yard line. Quarterback John Paye
finds James on a down-and-out pat
tern for 34 yards and a game-saving
first down.
Voiceover: "A receiver is kind of
a big play man," James says. "My
number isn't usually called unless
10 or more yards are needed. In
the clutch, I'd like to think I'm the
one they go to."
Roll tape two— September 13,
1986. The underdog Cardinal leads
Texas in the season opener, but
the Longhorns have scored to cut
the lead to 14-9. With time running

out in the first half and momentum
shifting to the Texas side, James
steals a Paye pass from Texas' Step
hen Braggs and takes it 45 yards for
his third touchdown of the half.
Stanford goes on to win, 31-20.
Voiceover: "You like to have big
play potential in a receiver," Stan
ford receivers Coach Dave Baldwin
says,"and James definitely has
that."
In his third season at Stanford,
James has already been on more
highlight films than one could
mention in a football program.
That's no surprise, since making
the big play is his "raison d'etre."
"John Stallworth is my guy I
really wish I could be like," said
James, comparing himself to the
great Pittsburgh Steelers receiver.
"He always makes the big catch. I
like to make the catch people don't
think I should make."
Baldwin said, "Our offense this

year is based around many people.
His role this year is to get that big
play on offense."
The 6-foot, 186-pound junior has
nabbed 42 receptions this season,
second on the team to Brad
Muster. To give an idea of what
kind of season James is having, the
next catch he makes will give him a
career high, even though he
missed two games with a bruised
heel and there are still two regular
season games left.
"It sure showed when he was
injured that we weren't as potent
on the outside," Baldwin said. "I'd
say he took away at least seven
points (a game) by not playing.''
Part of the reason for James'
ever-increasing receiving numbers
is having played with the same
quarterback, Paye, for three years
— not seasons, but years.
"From freshman year on, I've
lived with John over the sum
mers," James said. "(We) worked
out every day, running the routes
we're supposed to run. And
through the years we've been
playing games, he also knows my
adjustments and I know what he
can see."
"John Paye has a confidence in
Jeff," Baldwin said. "In a crucial sit
uation, he knows Jeff will get
open."
"My biggest strength is con

thrives on the big play. "My number usually isn't called on un
less 10 or more yards are needed in the clutch," James said. "I
like to think I'm the one they go to." In the fourth quarter of last
year's Big Game, the team went to James on a crucial third-and
-22 play. James made a spectacular 34-yard catch and kept the
Cardinal's game-ending drive alive.
centrating on learning to read
defenses," James said. "If I can line
up and know the defense, I can
know where approximately I have
to be, what kind of route I have to
run — if it's a zone defense, know
what hole I'm supposed to be
looking for."
Even if a receiver knows every
thing about timing and location,
however, if he can't get himself
there it's all for nought. James and
Baldwin disagree on just how
talented James is in this area.
"Comparing myself across the
board there's no attribute that
really stands out," James said. "Of
the three basic things (speed, run
ning routes, and catching the ball)
I don't do any exceptionally well."
But Baldwin said, "Each of the
three years I've been here he's
progressed. He's got all the talents:
speed, toughness, and ability to get
to the ball."
Baldwin is on the winning side
of this debate. He argues his case
very persuasively.
"Jeffs got a very aggressive at
tack to this game," Baldwin said.
"He wants to be the best, and it
shows in his work habits. He just
keeps it going at 100-percent, and
he doesn't let up."
And this guy went to Beverly
Hills High School? It shows that
some stereotypes don't hold up for
everybody.
"He's the most aggressive
receiver I've ever coached,"
Baldwin said. "He wants to be the
best. It's a burning desire inside
him, very unique."
The same desire holds for the
entire team, and it's being
rewarded this year by a trip to the
Gator Bowl.
Last year, the Cardinal salvaged a
seven-loss season by winning the
Big Game. This year, Big Game is a
slight misnomer, since Stanford
has bigger and better things ahead.
"With the success of this year,"
James said, "it's a little less signifi
cant in that respect, but it's impor
tant to maintain our national
ranking. A loss to Cal would drop
us."

Like his idol John Stallworth of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Jeff James
thrives on the big play. "My number usually isn't called on un
less 10 or more yards are needed in the clutch," James said. "I
like to think I'm the one they go to." In the fourth quarter of last
year's Big Game, the team went to James on a crucial third-and

Cardinal's game-ending drive alive.
centrating on learning to read
defenses," James said. "If I can line
up and know the defense, I can
know where approximately I have
to be, what kind of route I have to
run — if it's a zone defense, know
what hole I'm supposed to be
looking for."
Even if a receiver knows every
thing about timing and location,
however, if he can't get himself
there it's all for nought. James and
Baldwin disagree on just how
talented James is in this area.
"Comparing myself across the
board there's no attribute that
really stands out," James said. "Of
the three basic things (speed, run
ning routes, and catching the ball)
I don't do any exceptionally well."
But Baldwin said, "Each of the
three years I've been here he's
progressed. He's got all the talents:
speed, toughness, and ability to get
to the ball."
Baldwin is on the winning side
of this debate. He argues his case
very persuasively.
"Jeffs got a very aggressive at
tack to this game," Baldwin said.
"He wants to be the best, and it
shows in his work habits. He just
keeps it going at 100-percent, and
he doesn't let up."
And this guy went to Beverly
Hills High School? It shows that
some stereotypes don't hold up for
everybody.
"He's the most aggressive
receiver I've ever coached,"
Baldwin said. "He wants to be the
best. It's a burning desire inside
him, very unique."
The same desire holds for the
entire team, and it's being
rewarded this year by a trip to the
Gator Bowl.
Last year, the Cardinal salvaged a
seven-loss season by winning the
Big Game. This year, Big Game is a
slight misnomer, since Stanford
has bigger and better things ahead.
"With the success of this year,"
James said, "it's a little less signifi
cant in that respect, but it's impor
tant to maintain our national
ranking. A loss to Cal would drop
us."
Stanford football highlights
featuring wide receiver Jeff
James Take one.
Roll tape one Under three
minutes to go in Big Game, 1985.
Stanford hanging on to 24-22 lead,
facing third-and-22 from its own
8-yard line. Quarterback John Paye
finds James on a down-and-out pat
tern for 34 yards and a game-saving
first down.
Voiceover: "A receiver is kind of
a big play man," James says. "My
number isn't usually called unless
10 or more yards are needed. In
the clutch, I'd like to think I'm the
one they go to."
Roll tape two— September 13,
1986. The underdog Cardinal leads
Texas in the season opener, but
the Longhorns have scored to cut
the lead to 14-9. With time running

out in the first half and momentum
shifting to the Texas side, James
steals a Paye pass from Texas' Step
hen Braggs and takes it 45 yards for
his third touchdown of the half.
Stanford goes on to win, 31-20.
Voiceover: "You like to have big
play potential in a receiver," Stan
ford receivers Coach Dave Baldwin
says,"and James definitely has
that."
In his third season at Stanford,
James has already been on more
highlight films than one could
mention in a football program.
That's no surprise, since making
the big play is his "raison d'etre."
"John Stallworth is my guy I
really wish I could be like," said
James, comparing himself to the
great Pittsburgh Steelers receiver.
"He always makes the big catch. I
like to make the catch people don't
think I should make."
Baldwin said, "Our offense this

year is based around many people.
His role this year is to get that big
play on offense."
The 6-foot, 186-pound junior has
nabbed 42 receptions this season,
second on the team to Brad
Muster. To give an idea of what
kind of season James is having, the
next catch he makes will give him a
career high, even though he
missed two games with a bruised
heel and there are still two regular
season games left.
"It sure showed when he was
injured that we weren't as potent
on the outside," Baldwin said. "I'd
say he took away at least seven
points (a game) by not playing.''
Part of the reason for James'
ever-increasing receiving numbers
is having played with the same
quarterback, Paye, for three years
— not seasons, but years.
"From freshman year on, I've
lived with John over the sum
mers," James said. "(We) worked
out every day, running the routes
we're supposed to run. And
through the years we've been
playing games, he also knows my
adjustments and I know what he
can see."
"John Paye has a confidence in
Jeff," Baldwin said. "In a crucial sit
