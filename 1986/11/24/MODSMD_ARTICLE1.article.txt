BERKELEY â€” The Bears may he Kapp-less,
but they are hapless no more.
In the final game of Coach Joe Kapp's less
than-illustrious five years as the Bears' head
man, a California team listed as an 18-point un
derdog pulled off the biggest upset in Big
Game history, defeating Stanford 17-11 Satur

day in the 89th renewal of the cross-Bay rivalry
to salvage a bit of respect in an otherwise dis
mal 2-9 season.
Stanford, now 7-3, came into the game
ranked No. 16 in the nation and had a Gator
Bowl invitation waiting in the locker room after
what most observers expected to be an easy vic
tory over Cal, which came in one loss away
from its losingest season in 105 years of foot
ball

Instead, the Bear neither quit nor died.
Playing in his first full #ame all season, Cal
quarterback Kevin Brown threw for 221 yards,
and the Bears defense sacked Stanford quarter
back John Paye seven times as the Cardinal s
recent nightmares in Strawberry Canyon con
tinued in front of a sellout crowd of 75,662 in
Memorial Stadium.
"Going into the game, it was a desperate
struggle for us," Cal center Chuck Steele said.

"They were just expecting us to show up and
give them the game. It was the most important
game of most of our careers. Nobody wanted to
go out being the worst team in school history."
"This is the only way to go out," outside
linebacker John Geringer said, "especially with
the season we've had, which has been pretty
ugly. A lot of it was for ourselves. Coach Kapp
wanted it that way. Them going to a bowl game
inspired us even more to beat them up."

Bowl-bound Stanford teams have an allergy
to winning in Berkeley. Four years ago, with a
Hall of Fame Bowl bid hinging on a victors , Cat
used a hotly disputed five-lateral kickoff return
to annul what had been a 20-19 Stanford vic
tor)'. In 1980, needing a win over a 2 8 Cal team
for a Peach Bowl bid, Stanford lost, 28-23 And
in 1970, Stanford's first Rose Bowl team in two
