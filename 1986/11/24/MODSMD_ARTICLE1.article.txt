# Card loses Big Shame, 17-11
## SPORTS 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — The Bears may he Kapp-less,
but they are hapless no more.
In the final game of Coach Joe Kapp's less
than-illustrious five years as the Bears' head
man, a California team listed as an 18-point un
derdog pulled off the biggest upset in Big
Game history, defeating Stanford 17-11 Satur

day in the 89th renewal of the cross-Bay rivalry
to salvage a bit of respect in an otherwise dis
mal 2-9 season.
Stanford, now 7-3, came into the game
ranked No. 16 in the nation and had a Gator
Bowl invitation waiting in the locker room after
what most observers expected to be an easy vic
tory over Cal, which came in one loss away
from its losingest season in 105 years of foot
ball

Instead, the Bear neither quit nor died.
Playing in his first full #ame all season, Cal
quarterback Kevin Brown threw for 221 yards,
and the Bears defense sacked Stanford quarter
back John Paye seven times as the Cardinal s
recent nightmares in Strawberry Canyon con
tinued in front of a sellout crowd of 75,662 in
Memorial Stadium.
"Going into the game, it was a desperate
struggle for us," Cal center Chuck Steele said.

"They were just expecting us to show up and
give them the game. It was the most important
game of most of our careers. Nobody wanted to
go out being the worst team in school history."
"This is the only way to go out," outside
linebacker John Geringer said, "especially with
the season we've had, which has been pretty
ugly. A lot of it was for ourselves. Coach Kapp
wanted it that way. Them going to a bowl game
inspired us even more to beat them up."

Bowl-bound Stanford teams have an allergy
to winning in Berkeley. Four years ago, with a
Hall of Fame Bowl bid hinging on a victors , Cat
used a hotly disputed five-lateral kickoff return
to annul what had been a 20-19 Stanford vic
tor)'. In 1980, needing a win over a 2 8 Cal team
for a Peach Bowl bid, Stanford lost, 28-23 And

decades dropped a 22-14 decision here.
Stanford will still go to the Gator Bowl, but that
game has lost much of the luster it seemed to
have when the matchup was announced last
week. Stanford could be 7-4 with a loss to Arizona
next week in Tokyo, and Atlantic Coast Confer
ence champion Clemson suffered a 21-21 tie
against South Carolina to finish the regular
season 7-2-2. It was Clemson's second con
secutive tie.
The Bears "came into the football game with
high intensity and emotion," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "You've got to give them credit. There
are no excuses as far as we're concerned. We
knew they're a talented football team. We knew
they could salvage a lot from the disappointment
they've had in the past."
"They played with more emotion than we did
today," Stanford wide receiver Jeff James said.
"They have some good athletes. I don't know why
they had the record they did."
Had the Bears played defense like they did Sat
urday, they wouldn't have. Stanford finished with
only 41 yards rushing on the afternoon, and run
ning back Brad Muster, who carried 75 times for
373 yards in his two previous games, carried 18
times for only 59 yards before leaving in the third
quarter with a contusion above his right knee.
"I thought we'd have more success with the
running game," said Muster, who earlier last week
was named a first-team All-American by Eastman
Kodak. "Their defense protected well on the
outside. I thought the cutback was there, but we
had a little trouble sustaining blocks."
|The offensive line that had looked so good in
springing Muster the last two games didn't Satur
day. Not only was the running game ineffective,
but Paye was rudely introduced to Cal defenders
on seven occasions and forced to run, dodge and
scramble on several others.
"We really got whipped up front," Elway said,
"they were coming off the ball and getting
penetration."
That didn't look like the scenario at first. Stan
ford took the opening kickoff 58 yards to the Cal
4. Muster carried four times for 29 yards, and he
completed an 18-yard halfback-option pass to
tight end Eric Snelson to the Cal 7. The drive
stalled, though, and David Sweeney came on to
try an easy 21-yard field goal. He missed, for the
seventh consecutive time.
"The ease with which we drove on them — I
figured we'd be able to do that all day," James
said. "I was just worried about what we were
going to do on the goal line."
Paye was hampered by a severely sore
shoulder all game, but managed to complete 23-
of-35 passes for 224 yards with no interceptions.
Take away a 69-yard touchdown to James, though,
and Paye's average completion was under eight
yards.
"I tried my best," Paye said when asked how
much the shoulder affected his play. Paye refused
to , 112
*1 though John played pretty well today and
threw the ball well," Elway said.
"He didn't give me any indication that his arm
was bothering him, "James said. "He threw to me
pretty well."
Once again, Stanford disdained the long pass,
though no one said it was out of deference to
Paye's shoulder. The Cardinal had relied on
Muster to carry the load the past two games, but
that game plan proved ineffective Saturday.
"I was getting behind them all day," James said.
"We just weren't throwing deep. It's sort of a
Catch-22 — it's not high-percentage, it's risky. I
think maybe they watched the films on us — we
haven't gone deep in 10 games."
Stanford was also without wide receiver
Thomas Henley, who suffered a hyperextended
elbow on a first quarter punt return and did not
return. Henry Green and Ed McCaffrey both saw
action in Henley's absence, but neither caught a
pass. James finished with seven catches for 138
yards.
Defensively, Stanford played well, as it has all
season. Two big plays by freshman wide receiver

Mike Ford were the only black marks on an other
wise tough defensive effort. Ford caught a 61-yard
pass from Brown along the right sideline to set up
Cal's first touchdown in the second quarter, then
took a pitch on a reverse 47 yards for what proved
to be the final margin of victory.
"Troy Taylor was up in the box, and he spotted
the opening and helped call the play," Ford said.
Taylor was Cal's starting quarterback until he suf
fered a broken jaw last week against USC.
Four plays later, Brown hit wide receiver Wen
dell Peoples in the end zone from five yards out
to give Cal a 10-0 lead. Cornerback Toi Cook had
tight coverage on Peoples, but the ball was just
over Cook and caught by the leaping Peoples.
"Looking back, I should've made that play,"
Cook said. "That still bothers me."
The Stanford secondary came back with a big
play of its own before the half was through, when
strong safety Brad Humphreys dived for a poor

pass by Brown and came up with his fifth inter
ception of the season at the Cal 28.
Unfortunately, the Stanford offense went back
ward three yards, and Elway sent Sweeney in to
try a 48-yarder. His kick had enough leg to clear
the crossbar and cut the Cal lead to 10-3 just
before halftime.
In the third quarter, it appeared Stanford
would tie the game when Paul Svitenko blocked a
punt by Cal's Scott Tabor and Mike Newton took it
in for an apparent touchdown — but Svitenko
was offside on the play.
The second time Ford touched the ball came in
the fourth quarter. Brown rolled left for an appar
ent option, but instead pitched to Ford on the
reverse. Stanford outside linebacker Chris Weber
got a hand on Ford but couldn't make the play,
two Cal blockers took Cook out of the play, and
Ford outran Humphreys and linebacker David
Wyman to the end zone.

Stanford came back, though, when James out
maneuvered Cal safety Darryl Stallworth to grab a
Paye pass on the right sideline, cut across the
field, and outrun everyone for a 69-yard touch
down.
Elway then chose to play for the win by going
for the two-point conversion, and Paye hit tight
end Jim Price over the middle to pull Stanford
within six.
Stanford got the ball back with 4:33 to play on
its own 16, and thoughts immediately turned to
John Elway's apparent game-winning drive here
four years ago. Paye proceeded to bring the Card
inal to the Cal 37, but then the line caved in.
Two sacks and an incompletion left Stanford
with one chance on fourth-and-26 at its own 47,
but there was no "just get open and I'll hit you"
pass to Emile Harry this time. Paye's desperation
toss to Brian Morris was good for only two yards,
and Cal had the upset.

decades dropped a 22-14 decision here.
Stanford will still go to the Gator Bowl, but that
game has lost much of the luster it seemed to
have when the matchup was announced last
week. Stanford could be 7-4 with a loss to Arizona
next week in Tokyo, and Atlantic Coast Confer
ence champion Clemson suffered a 21-21 tie
against South Carolina to finish the regular
season 7-2-2. It was Clemson's second con
secutive tie.
The Bears "came into the football game with
high intensity and emotion," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "You've got to give them credit. There
are no excuses as far as we're concerned. We
knew they're a talented football team. We knew
they could salvage a lot from the disappointment
they've had in the past."
"They played with more emotion than we did
today," Stanford wide receiver Jeff James said.
"They have some good athletes. I don't know why
they had the record they did."
Had the Bears played defense like they did Sat
urday, they wouldn't have. Stanford finished with
only 41 yards rushing on the afternoon, and run
ning back Brad Muster, who carried 75 times for
373 yards in his two previous games, carried 18
times for only 59 yards before leaving in the third
quarter with a contusion above his right knee.
"I thought we'd have more success with the
running game," said Muster, who earlier last week
was named a first-team All-American by Eastman
Kodak. "Their defense protected well on the
outside. I thought the cutback was there, but we
had a little trouble sustaining blocks."
|The offensive line that had looked so good in
springing Muster the last two games didn't Satur
day. Not only was the running game ineffective,
but Paye was rudely introduced to Cal defenders
on seven occasions and forced to run, dodge and
scramble on several others.
"We really got whipped up front," Elway said,
"they were coming off the ball and getting
penetration."
That didn't look like the scenario at first. Stan
ford took the opening kickoff 58 yards to the Cal
4. Muster carried four times for 29 yards, and he
completed an 18-yard halfback-option pass to
tight end Eric Snelson to the Cal 7. The drive
stalled, though, and David Sweeney came on to
try an easy 21-yard field goal. He missed, for the
seventh consecutive time.
"The ease with which we drove on them — I
figured we'd be able to do that all day," James
said. "I was just worried about what we were
going to do on the goal line."
Paye was hampered by a severely sore
shoulder all game, but managed to complete 23-
of-35 passes for 224 yards with no interceptions.
Take away a 69-yard touchdown to James, though,
and Paye's average completion was under eight
yards.
"I tried my best," Paye said when asked how
much the shoulder affected his play. Paye refused
to , 112
*1 though John played pretty well today and
threw the ball well," Elway said.
"He didn't give me any indication that his arm
was bothering him, "James said. "He threw to me
pretty well."
Once again, Stanford disdained the long pass,
though no one said it was out of deference to
Paye's shoulder. The Cardinal had relied on
Muster to carry the load the past two games, but
that game plan proved ineffective Saturday.
"I was getting behind them all day," James said.
"We just weren't throwing deep. It's sort of a
Catch-22 — it's not high-percentage, it's risky. I
think maybe they watched the films on us — we
haven't gone deep in 10 games."
Stanford was also without wide receiver
Thomas Henley, who suffered a hyperextended
elbow on a first quarter punt return and did not
return. Henry Green and Ed McCaffrey both saw
action in Henley's absence, but neither caught a
pass. James finished with seven catches for 138
yards.
Defensively, Stanford played well, as it has all
season. Two big plays by freshman wide receiver

Mike Ford were the only black marks on an other
wise tough defensive effort. Ford caught a 61-yard
pass from Brown along the right sideline to set up
Cal's first touchdown in the second quarter, then
took a pitch on a reverse 47 yards for what proved
to be the final margin of victory.
"Troy Taylor was up in the box, and he spotted
the opening and helped call the play," Ford said.
Taylor was Cal's starting quarterback until he suf
fered a broken jaw last week against USC.
Four plays later, Brown hit wide receiver Wen
dell Peoples in the end zone from five yards out
to give Cal a 10-0 lead. Cornerback Toi Cook had
tight coverage on Peoples, but the ball was just
over Cook and caught by the leaping Peoples.
"Looking back, I should've made that play,"
Cook said. "That still bothers me."
The Stanford secondary came back with a big
play of its own before the half was through, when
strong safety Brad Humphreys dived for a poor

pass by Brown and came up with his fifth inter
ception of the season at the Cal 28.
Unfortunately, the Stanford offense went back
ward three yards, and Elway sent Sweeney in to
try a 48-yarder. His kick had enough leg to clear
the crossbar and cut the Cal lead to 10-3 just
before halftime.
In the third quarter, it appeared Stanford
would tie the game when Paul Svitenko blocked a
punt by Cal's Scott Tabor and Mike Newton took it
in for an apparent touchdown — but Svitenko
was offside on the play.
The second time Ford touched the ball came in
the fourth quarter. Brown rolled left for an appar
ent option, but instead pitched to Ford on the
reverse. Stanford outside linebacker Chris Weber
got a hand on Ford but couldn't make the play,
two Cal blockers took Cook out of the play, and
Ford outran Humphreys and linebacker David
Wyman to the end zone.

Stanford came back, though, when James out
maneuvered Cal safety Darryl Stallworth to grab a
Paye pass on the right sideline, cut across the
field, and outrun everyone for a 69-yard touch
down.
Elway then chose to play for the win by going
for the two-point conversion, and Paye hit tight
end Jim Price over the middle to pull Stanford
within six.
Stanford got the ball back with 4:33 to play on
its own 16, and thoughts immediately turned to
John Elway's apparent game-winning drive here
four years ago. Paye proceeded to bring the Card
inal to the Cal 37, but then the line caved in.
Two sacks and an incompletion left Stanford
with one chance on fourth-and-26 at its own 47,
but there was no "just get open and I'll hit you"
pass to Emile Harry this time. Paye's desperation
toss to Brian Morris was good for only two yards,
and Cal had the upset.

In the final game of Coach Joe Kapp's less

man, a California team listed as an 18-point un
derdog pulled off the biggest upset in Big
Game history, defeating Stanford 17-11 Satur

to salvage a bit of respect in an otherwise dis

Bowl invitation waiting in the locker room after
what most observers expected to be an easy vic
tory over Cal, which came in one loss away
from its losingest season in 105 years of foot
ball

Instead, the Bear neither quit nor died.
Playing in his first full #ame all season, Cal
quarterback Kevin Brown threw for 221 yards,
and the Bears defense sacked Stanford quarter
back John Paye seven times as the Cardinal s
recent nightmares in Strawberry Canyon con
tinued in front of a sellout crowd of 75,662 in
Memorial Stadium.
"Going into the game, it was a desperate
struggle for us," Cal center Chuck Steele said.

"They were just expecting us to show up and
give them the game. It was the most important
game of most of our careers. Nobody wanted to
go out being the worst team in school history."
"This is the only way to go out," outside
linebacker John Geringer said, "especially with
the season we've had, which has been pretty
ugly. A lot of it was for ourselves. Coach Kapp
wanted it that way. Them going to a bowl game
inspired us even more to beat them up."

springing Muster the last two games didn't Satur
day. Not only was the running game ineffective,
but Paye was rudely introduced to Cal defenders
on seven occasions and forced to run, dodge and
scramble on several others.
"We really got whipped up front," Elway said,
"they were coming off the ball and getting
penetration."
That didn't look like the scenario at first. Stan
ford took the opening kickoff 58 yards to the Cal
4. Muster carried four times for 29 yards, and he
completed an 18-yard halfback-option pass to
tight end Eric Snelson to the Cal 7. The drive
stalled, though, and David Sweeney came on to
try an easy 21-yard field goal. He missed, for the
seventh consecutive time.
"The ease with which we drove on them — I
figured we'd be able to do that all day," James
said. "I was just worried about what we were
going to do on the goal line."
Paye was hampered by a severely sore
shoulder all game, but managed to complete 23-
of-35 passes for 224 yards with no interceptions.
Take away a 69-yard touchdown to James, though,
and Paye's average completion was under eight
yards.
"I tried my best," Paye said when asked how
much the shoulder affected his play. Paye refused
to , 112
*1 though John played pretty well today and
threw the ball well," Elway said.
"He didn't give me any indication that his arm
was bothering him, "James said. "He threw to me
pretty well."
Once again, Stanford disdained the long pass,
though no one said it was out of deference to
Paye's shoulder. The Cardinal had relied on
Muster to carry the load the past two games, but
that game plan proved ineffective Saturday.
"I was getting behind them all day," James said.
"We just weren't throwing deep. It's sort of a
Catch-22 — it's not high-percentage, it's risky. I
think maybe they watched the films on us — we
haven't gone deep in 10 games."
Stanford was also without wide receiver
Thomas Henley, who suffered a hyperextended
elbow on a first quarter punt return and did not
return. Henry Green and Ed McCaffrey both saw
action in Henley's absence, but neither caught a
pass. James finished with seven catches for 138
yards.
Defensively, Stanford played well, as it has all
season. Two big plays by freshman wide receiver

Mike Ford were the only black marks on an other
wise tough defensive effort. Ford caught a 61-yard
pass from Brown along the right sideline to set up
Cal's first touchdown in the second quarter, then
took a pitch on a reverse 47 yards for what proved
to be the final margin of victory.
"Troy Taylor was up in the box, and he spotted
the opening and helped call the play," Ford said.
Taylor was Cal's starting quarterback until he suf
fered a broken jaw last week against USC.
Four plays later, Brown hit wide receiver Wen
dell Peoples in the end zone from five yards out
to give Cal a 10-0 lead. Cornerback Toi Cook had
tight coverage on Peoples, but the ball was just
over Cook and caught by the leaping Peoples.
"Looking back, I should've made that play,"
Cook said. "That still bothers me."
The Stanford secondary came back with a big
play of its own before the half was through, when
strong safety Brad Humphreys dived for a poor

pass by Brown and came up with his fifth inter
ception of the season at the Cal 28.
Unfortunately, the Stanford offense went back
ward three yards, and Elway sent Sweeney in to
try a 48-yarder. His kick had enough leg to clear
the crossbar and cut the Cal lead to 10-3 just
before halftime.
In the third quarter, it appeared Stanford
would tie the game when Paul Svitenko blocked a
punt by Cal's Scott Tabor and Mike Newton took it
in for an apparent touchdown — but Svitenko
was offside on the play.
The second time Ford touched the ball came in
the fourth quarter. Brown rolled left for an appar
ent option, but instead pitched to Ford on the
reverse. Stanford outside linebacker Chris Weber
got a hand on Ford but couldn't make the play,
two Cal blockers took Cook out of the play, and
Ford outran Humphreys and linebacker David
Wyman to the end zone.

Stanford came back, though, when James out
maneuvered Cal safety Darryl Stallworth to grab a
Paye pass on the right sideline, cut across the
field, and outrun everyone for a 69-yard touch
down.
Elway then chose to play for the win by going
for the two-point conversion, and Paye hit tight
end Jim Price over the middle to pull Stanford
within six.
Stanford got the ball back with 4:33 to play on
its own 16, and thoughts immediately turned to
John Elway's apparent game-winning drive here
four years ago. Paye proceeded to bring the Card
inal to the Cal 37, but then the line caved in.
Two sacks and an incompletion left Stanford
with one chance on fourth-and-26 at its own 47,
but there was no "just get open and I'll hit you"
pass to Emile Harry this time. Paye's desperation
toss to Brian Morris was good for only two yards,
and Cal had the upset.

BERKELEY — The Bears may he Kapp-less,
but they are hapless no more.
In the final game of Coach Joe Kapp's less
than-illustrious five years as the Bears' head
man, a California team listed as an 18-point un
derdog pulled off the biggest upset in Big
Game history, defeating Stanford 17-11 Satur

day in the 89th renewal of the cross-Bay rivalry
to salvage a bit of respect in an otherwise dis
mal 2-9 season.
Stanford, now 7-3, came into the game
ranked No. 16 in the nation and had a Gator
Bowl invitation waiting in the locker room after
what most observers expected to be an easy vic
tory over Cal, which came in one loss away
from its losingest season in 105 years of foot
ball

Instead, the Bear neither quit nor died.
Playing in his first full #ame all season, Cal
quarterback Kevin Brown threw for 221 yards,
and the Bears defense sacked Stanford quarter
back John Paye seven times as the Cardinal s
recent nightmares in Strawberry Canyon con
tinued in front of a sellout crowd of 75,662 in
Memorial Stadium.
"Going into the game, it was a desperate
struggle for us," Cal center Chuck Steele said.

"They were just expecting us to show up and
give them the game. It was the most important
game of most of our careers. Nobody wanted to
go out being the worst team in school history."
"This is the only way to go out," outside
linebacker John Geringer said, "especially with
the season we've had, which has been pretty
ugly. A lot of it was for ourselves. Coach Kapp
wanted it that way. Them going to a bowl game
inspired us even more to beat them up."

decades dropped a 22-14 decision here.
Stanford will still go to the Gator Bowl, but that
game has lost much of the luster it seemed to
have when the matchup was announced last
week. Stanford could be 7-4 with a loss to Arizona
next week in Tokyo, and Atlantic Coast Confer
ence champion Clemson suffered a 21-21 tie
against South Carolina to finish the regular
season 7-2-2. It was Clemson's second con
secutive tie.
The Bears "came into the football game with
high intensity and emotion," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "You've got to give them credit. There
are no excuses as far as we're concerned. We
knew they're a talented football team. We knew
they could salvage a lot from the disappointment
they've had in the past."
"They played with more emotion than we did
today," Stanford wide receiver Jeff James said.
"They have some good athletes. I don't know why
they had the record they did."
Had the Bears played defense like they did Sat
urday, they wouldn't have. Stanford finished with
only 41 yards rushing on the afternoon, and run
ning back Brad Muster, who carried 75 times for
373 yards in his two previous games, carried 18
times for only 59 yards before leaving in the third
quarter with a contusion above his right knee.
"I thought we'd have more success with the
running game," said Muster, who earlier last week
was named a first-team All-American by Eastman
Kodak. "Their defense protected well on the
outside. I thought the cutback was there, but we
had a little trouble sustaining blocks."
