humanities and humanists are
everybody's business; and for his su
perlative example of institutional
good citizenship on behalf of the
Stanford professoriate."

the Stanford University Libraries in

recipient.
Banks wins NASA award
Electical Engineering Prof. Peter
Banks has been awarded the Distin
guished Public Sevice Medal by the
National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministation for his planning work on
the U.S. space station.
Banks is chairman of the Space and
Earth Science Advisory Committee
Task Force on Scientific Uses of the
Space Station. The award was pre
sented in Washington last month.
The award was given for Banks'
"leadership (and) enthusiastic insight
into the study of the usefulness of the
space station concept for the scien
tific community in the 19905."
Ombudsperson's report
Non-academic staff presented one
third of the problems considered by

the Stanford Ombudsperson's Office
in 1985-86, Leah Kaplan declared in
her first annual report as its head.
"Personal conflicts with super
visors and other workers were fre
quently raised," she noted.
Of the 480 cases considered by the
Ombudsperson's office, 163 came
from non-academic staff. Of these,
116 concerned personnel and staff af
fairs, while 27 involved the libraries.
In all, 125 undergraduates and 117
graduate students came to Kaplan's
office with problems, most often con
cerning student services and student
affairs.
According to Kaplan, the om
budsperson does not have "decision
making power." Kaplan said all her
office can do is to "try to think
through a problem with an individual
and work out a plan for action and/or
solution."
Conference center dedicated
Stanford dedicated the new Fred

Hartley Conference Center last week.
The center is located on the first floor
of the Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing.
The center was presented to the
University by Unocal Corp. Fred
Hartley, Unocal's chairman and chief
executive officer, said, "It is not just a
case of funding a good cause, but an
investment in the future of the petro
leum industry."
Hartley said Stanford is a training
ground for petroleum engineers,
geologists and geophysicists who will
have to find ways of recovering oil
from wells that were once thought to
be exhausted. He referred to Stan
ford's pre-eminence in enhanced oil
recovery technology.
Melvin Lane accepted the confer
ence center on behalf of Stanford's
Board of Trustees. He mentioned Un
ocal's generosity to several Stanford
institutions, including the Graduate
School of Business and the Hoover
Institution, besides the School of
Earth Sciences.
