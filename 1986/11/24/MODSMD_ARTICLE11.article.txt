### HELEN SURH 
To unify Stanford with the sur
rounding community and inform it
of the public events, services and is
sues on campus, University News
and Publications Service recently
distributed the sixth issue of its bi
annual tabloid, the Stanford Com
munity Report.
Distributed to 65,000 homes in
local neighborhoods, the 24-page
Community Report contains articles
on a wide variety of topics that are
of interest to the public, such as
lectures, artistic events, sports,
public service programs, campus
tours and plans for Stanford land
use.
According to Terry Johnson,
editor of the Community Report,
the paper lets the public know that
Stanford is not isolated in its institu
tionalized "ivory tower," but is in
terested in keeping its neighbors
informed and inviting them to
share in University activities,
"Stanford should reach out more
to the community and invite people
to find out more about us," Johnson
said. The basic purpose of the

publication is to "reach out and
invite in," said Andy Doty, director
of Community Relations.
The Community Report was first
published in the spring of 1984,
when the University determined
there existed a need for greater in
teraction with the community and
asked various departments to sub
mit information and articles to be
synthesized into one packet.
Although it is difficult to make
conclusions about the success of
the Community Report, its overall
reception from the public has been
extremely favorable, according to
Doty. The public seems to appreci
ate Stanford's effort to become
closer to the community, he said,
noting positive letters and phone
calls received by the Community
Relations Office.
Doty said there are very few
private universities engaged in this
"novel" type of community educa
tion effort. "Private universities
tend to focus their resources on stu
dents and faculty. In contrast, be
cause they are funded by taxpayers'
money, public universities feel an
obligation to serve."
