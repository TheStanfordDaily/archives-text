## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper A 						good suggestion 
### 
The recent call for the University to re-examine its
policy of confidentiality in disciplinary cases is a wise
idea, and, if the suggestions for change are approved, the
new system could protect students better than the cur
rent policy.
The review, suggested by Judicial Affairs Adviser Sally
Cole in the most recent Judicial Affairs report on discipli
nary action, urges the administration to consider releas
ing in future reports the names of those students who
are involved in "public" cases. Currently, the University
has a policy of confidentiality about all disciplinary cases.
While the change may seem, at first, to be insensitive
and unfair, those who will serve on the committee
reviewing the current policy should take into account
the advantages of such a system.
First and foremost, releasing the names would en
hance the underlying goals of Stanford's judicial process.
Critics of the proposal would claim that to release the
names of students involved in public cases would un
fairly increase a guilty student's punishment. Their argu
ment is simple enough: Judicial Affairs establishes what it
considers to be a just punishment, and revealing the
names of the guilty party would result in damaging
publicity and significantly worsen what was once a fair
penalty.
But these critics fail to see that when dealing with a
public case — one that occurs in a public place and in
which the names of those involved are discovered by the
media before Judicial Affairs is made aware of the case —
the University is doing a disservice to the accused by not

releasing the names along with other details of the case.
In these public cases, the University policy is harmful be
cause it effectively forbids those involved in the decision
to clarify or challenge unwarranted rumors and miscon
ceptions that the press may mistakenly perpetuate.
A revised policy of confidentiality in public cases
would not mean added publicity and punishment for the
guilty party; instead, it would serve to diminish the
chances that harmful and inaccurate information will be
published. Cole's point of view is a reasonable one. If the
names are already public and have already been printed,
then why shouldn't the Judicial Affairs committee do all
that it can to prevent the spread of inaccurate informa
tion?
A revised policy is also beneficial because it would
make students more aware of the judicial process itself.
Currently, the system appears mysterious even in those
public cases in which the media prints everything but the
process behind administering justice. Certainly, there is
no point for having justice occur behind closed doors in
these well-publicized cases. Students have a right to see
how and why decisions are made. Justice, after all, is
something that should not be tainted by secrecy if it can
be avoided.
Cole's suggestions are worthy of the University's time
and consideration. There are still some aspects of her
recommendations that are unclear, such as the legal
ramifications of releasing the names in public cases, but
once these are detailed, the University would do well to
modify its policy in order to benefit the accused and the
student body in general.
