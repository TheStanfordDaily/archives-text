# Acquaintance rape is no fad

Dr. Ruth Westheimer's popularity across the country di
rectly reveals the difficulty people have with openly discuss
ing sexuality. By unabashedly confronting very real and un
deniable concerns, she seems to permit others to do the

So when Dr. Ruth visited us on the Farm two weeks ago,
she answered some questions, made us laugh and made us
think. Many of us are still thinking about the implications of
her comments on acquaintance rape. She claimed, in effect,
that engaging in foreplay commits a person to intercourse.
Perhaps she was trying to point out that we must be respon
sible for the situations, we get ourselves into. However, she
ffailed to acknowledge ffMf emotions, expectations,'"geriQer
roles, confusions and-fears add to the complexity of-our
sexual relationships. Are feelings honestly and straightfor
wardly communicated between partners prior to any sexual
involvement? Do people always know ahead of time how
comfortable they feel at different stages of a sexual relation
ship?
Responsibility in a relationship includes not only using
contraception, but also honestly and sensitively communi
cating with one's partner at all times and, more over,
respecting what is said. In downplaying the role of consent
in a sexual relationship, Dr. Ruth is essentially denying a
person the right to say no. It is much simpler to place the
blame for all unwanted activity on the unconsenting individ
ual — to say the person was "a tease" by participating in
foreplay — rather than acknowledge that coercion and
force are elements that can enter into a relationship.
But Dr. Ruth finds it hard to believe that any intelligent,
educated college student would be capable of raping some
one. (This point was made at the Yost reception after her
talk.) So not only did she perpetuate the blame-the-victim
myth, she also relayed the myth that rapists are all from cer
tain racial or ethnic groups and socio-economic levels and
have psycho-pathological problems far beyond that of
"normal" people. Dr. Ruths misconceptions are extremely
dangerous. By appearing as an educator, her statements give
license to others. If she chooses to bill herself as such, she
owes a duty to the public to educate herself fully on all of
the issues related to sexuality, rather than to use the podium
as a forum for her personal, and often misinformed be
liefs.
Contrary to Dr. Ruth's assertions, college women are es
pecially vulnerable to acquaintance rape. According to a

recent study by Ms. magazine, one quarter of the women in
college today have been victims of rape or attempted rape
and almost 90 percent of those victims knew their assailant.
Out of 7,000 students surveyed at 35 colleges across the
country, one out of every eight women were rape victims,
according to the legal definition of rape (intercourse with
out consent). Out of these rapes, 47 percent occurred on
first or casual dates or involved romantic acquaintances.
Faced with such statistics, can we accept the notion that ac
quaintance rape is a myth, a mere passing fad?

What is more frightening, however, is the reaction of some
