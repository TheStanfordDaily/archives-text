# Iceland: Reagan's sham?
## 
### 
The spell has finally broken for the Reagan administra
tion. Recent events in Iceland, Nicaragua and Iran not only
have highlighted this administration's penchant for lying to
Congress and the public about its policies, but they have
revealed how short-sighted and cynical those policies really
are. Even the Teflon Gipper's once-mighty public approval
rating has skidded.
Of the recent fiascoes, the one which I'm afraid will cause
the most far-reaching harm is President Reagan's refusal at
Reykjavik to compromise on SDI.

At the Iceland summit, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
presented a series of astounding arms reduction proposals
to eliminate Soviet and U.S. missiles from Europe, ban nu
clear testing and decrease each side's ballistic missile stock
by 50 percent over a 10-year period. In exchange, he
demanded that Reagan curtail development of his Strategic
Defense Initiative.
Partly because he failed to appreciate his unique place in
history and largely because of his myopic faith in his "Star
Wars" fantasy, Reagan missed the chance to be remembered
as a truly great president.
At Reykjavik, Reagan was the righf*man right time to
negotiate the mosf signifftartCjiTffft functions in history. He
didn't seem to realize it. Not just any president could have
used SDI successfully as a bargaining chip.
On one hand, the Soviets know that Reagan is hawkish
enough that if they didn't offer major concessions, he would
go ahead and develop the $100 billion system. On the other
hand, Reagan possesses sufficiently strong anti-communist
and pro-defense credentials that he could have dealt away
SDI, persuaded the conservatives in the Senate to go for it
and still remained popular with the people.
In some ways, the situation resembles Richard Nixon's
visits to China and the Soviet Union: Because of his reputa
tion as a hardliner, he could do it without being labeled
"soft" on communism.
Not only was Ronald Reagan in a position to obtain agree
ment on unprecedented arms reductions, but he had the
opportunity to get those reductions at virtually no cost. We
would have been giving up future development of weapons
which have so far cost us nothing. A bargain might still be
struck in the post-summit negotations, but time is running
out for Reagan.
Moreover, the next president — assuming he doesn't gut
SDI outright as a matter of principle — will have a much
tougher time making a deal. America's investment in SDI
would be much higher by then, jobs would depend on it,
and the Soviets might have complicated things by taking
countermeasures.
Criticizing Reagan for not dealing on SDI at the right time
assumes that he considers it a potential bargaining chip at
all. Questioning that assumption leads us to the most crucial
question in interpreting Reagan's presidency: How smart is
Reagan, really?

Had Reagan not been an actor, the answer would be ob
vious. Because he was once an actor, there is the slightest of
possibilities that he really isn't the simpleton he appears to
be and is in fact shrewdly masking his true (and wise) inten
tions.
For Reagan to have deftly dealt away SDI in order to
achieve the most sweeping and cost-effective arms reduc
tions we're ever likely to have a crack at would have added
considerable credence to the clever actor hypothesis. As it
was, he appeared more foolish than ever by clinging to a
dream that no reputable scientist in America believes will
work. As one congressman put it, what Reagan did was
"trade a bird in the hand for a pie in the sky."
Reagan's Star Wars myopia may be rooted in what is
sometimes called "technologism" — the belief that science
can provide miraculous solutions to our most vexing prob
lems. For Reagan, SDI offers the hope of eliminating the
threat of nuclear war (a very real horror) by rendering nu
clear missiles "impotent and obsolete" — a naive but very
appealing proposition.
Reagan can ignore the political complexities of maintain
ing stable superpower relations by saying that all our
worries will be over when "Science" comes up with a magic
weapon.
That kind of panacean fantasy may seem ridiculous, but
the reality of SDI is not silly, it's dangerous. Whether it
works perfectly or not, SDI represents a quantum leap in
the arms race — away from competition in missiles (a tech
nology the Soviets have mastered) and toward a high-tech
arms race that will make the Soviets very nervous.
In 1972, both the United States and the Soviet Union
recognized when they signed the ABM Treaty tlw m/ssitr*
defenses were inherently destabilizing. They serve merely*
to extend the arms race to more types of arms, since if one
side gains an advantage in defensive weapons it is free to at
tack with impunity or bully the other side in non-nuclear
confrontations.
So far the Reagan administration has portrayed SDI as
something fundamentally different from old-fashioned
missile defense. Yet the current SDI program is not invent
ing the glitzy, ultra-sophisticated space lasers that populate
every artist's conception of SDI. Rather, current SDI re
search looks like what you would expect any standard
missile defense program to look like: point defenses,
missiles to shoot down incoming missiles, anti-satellite
weapons.
One doesn't have to be too cynical to conclude that the
allure and promise of Star Wars is just a ruse to sucker
Americans into supporting a dangerously destabilizing mili
tary program.
As things stand now, it's hard to figure Ronald Reagan. If
he really cared about arms control, then he made a serious
blunder in Iceland. The outcome in Reykjavik, however,
suggests that Reagan's supposedly deep concern over end
ing the arms race was a sham.
Reagan remains the same idealogue who in 1980 said he
wouldn't have signed a single one of the post-war arms con
trol agreements. It's at least possible that all the bluster
about SDI is simply an excuse for escalating the arms race
and — as Reagan's 1980 platform demanded — attaining
"nuclear superiority."

Had Reagan not been an actor, the answer would be ob
vious. Because he was once an actor, there is the slightest of
possibilities that he really isn't the simpleton he appears to
be and is in fact shrewdly masking his true (and wise) inten
tions.
For Reagan to have deftly dealt away SDI in order to
achieve the most sweeping and cost-effective arms reduc
tions we're ever likely to have a crack at would have added
considerable credence to the clever actor hypothesis. As it
was, he appeared more foolish than ever by clinging to a
dream that no reputable scientist in America believes will
work. As one congressman put it, what Reagan did was
"trade a bird in the hand for a pie in the sky."
Reagan's Star Wars myopia may be rooted in what is
sometimes called "technologism" — the belief that science
can provide miraculous solutions to our most vexing prob
lems. For Reagan, SDI offers the hope of eliminating the
threat of nuclear war (a very real horror) by rendering nu
clear missiles "impotent and obsolete" — a naive but very
appealing proposition.
Reagan can ignore the political complexities of maintain
ing stable superpower relations by saying that all our
worries will be over when "Science" comes up with a magic
weapon.
That kind of panacean fantasy may seem ridiculous, but
the reality of SDI is not silly, it's dangerous. Whether it
works perfectly or not, SDI represents a quantum leap in
the arms race — away from competition in missiles (a tech
nology the Soviets have mastered) and toward a high-tech
arms race that will make the Soviets very nervous.
In 1972, both the United States and the Soviet Union
recognized when they signed the ABM Treaty tlw m/ssitr*
defenses were inherently destabilizing. They serve merely*
to extend the arms race to more types of arms, since if one
side gains an advantage in defensive weapons it is free to at
tack with impunity or bully the other side in non-nuclear
confrontations.
So far the Reagan administration has portrayed SDI as
something fundamentally different from old-fashioned
missile defense. Yet the current SDI program is not invent
ing the glitzy, ultra-sophisticated space lasers that populate
every artist's conception of SDI. Rather, current SDI re
search looks like what you would expect any standard
missile defense program to look like: point defenses,
missiles to shoot down incoming missiles, anti-satellite
weapons.
One doesn't have to be too cynical to conclude that the
allure and promise of Star Wars is just a ruse to sucker
Americans into supporting a dangerously destabilizing mili
tary program.
As things stand now, it's hard to figure Ronald Reagan. If
he really cared about arms control, then he made a serious
blunder in Iceland. The outcome in Reykjavik, however,
suggests that Reagan's supposedly deep concern over end
ing the arms race was a sham.
Reagan remains the same idealogue who in 1980 said he
wouldn't have signed a single one of the post-war arms con
trol agreements. It's at least possible that all the bluster
about SDI is simply an excuse for escalating the arms race
and — as Reagan's 1980 platform demanded — attaining
"nuclear superiority."

The spell has finally broken for the Reagan administra
tion. Recent events in Iceland, Nicaragua and Iran not only
have highlighted this administration's penchant for lying to
Congress and the public about its policies, but they have
revealed how short-sighted and cynical those policies really
are. Even the Teflon Gipper's once-mighty public approval
rating has skidded.
Of the recent fiascoes, the one which I'm afraid will cause
the most far-reaching harm is President Reagan's refusal at
Reykjavik to compromise on SDI.

At the Iceland summit, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
presented a series of astounding arms reduction proposals
to eliminate Soviet and U.S. missiles from Europe, ban nu
clear testing and decrease each side's ballistic missile stock
by 50 percent over a 10-year period. In exchange, he
demanded that Reagan curtail development of his Strategic
Defense Initiative.
Partly because he failed to appreciate his unique place in
history and largely because of his myopic faith in his "Star
Wars" fantasy, Reagan missed the chance to be remembered
as a truly great president.
At Reykjavik, Reagan was the righf*man right time to
negotiate the mosf signifftartCjiTffft functions in history. He
didn't seem to realize it. Not just any president could have
used SDI successfully as a bargaining chip.
On one hand, the Soviets know that Reagan is hawkish
enough that if they didn't offer major concessions, he would
go ahead and develop the $100 billion system. On the other
hand, Reagan possesses sufficiently strong anti-communist
and pro-defense credentials that he could have dealt away
SDI, persuaded the conservatives in the Senate to go for it
and still remained popular with the people.
In some ways, the situation resembles Richard Nixon's
visits to China and the Soviet Union: Because of his reputa
tion as a hardliner, he could do it without being labeled
"soft" on communism.
Not only was Ronald Reagan in a position to obtain agree
ment on unprecedented arms reductions, but he had the
opportunity to get those reductions at virtually no cost. We
would have been giving up future development of weapons
which have so far cost us nothing. A bargain might still be
struck in the post-summit negotations, but time is running
out for Reagan.
Moreover, the next president — assuming he doesn't gut
SDI outright as a matter of principle — will have a much
tougher time making a deal. America's investment in SDI
would be much higher by then, jobs would depend on it,
and the Soviets might have complicated things by taking
countermeasures.
Criticizing Reagan for not dealing on SDI at the right time
assumes that he considers it a potential bargaining chip at
all. Questioning that assumption leads us to the most crucial
question in interpreting Reagan's presidency: How smart is
Reagan, really?

Had Reagan not been an actor, the answer would be ob
vious. Because he was once an actor, there is the slightest of
possibilities that he really isn't the simpleton he appears to
be and is in fact shrewdly masking his true (and wise) inten
tions.
