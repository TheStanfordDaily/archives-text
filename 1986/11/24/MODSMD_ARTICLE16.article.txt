Letter neglects
anti-racist effort
I was disturbed and confused by
Steven Phillips recent viewpoint
(Daily, Oct. 31).
I lived in Ujamaa my sophomore
year and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had
the opportunity to meet many good
[x-opie and at the same time to learn
about an issue (blacks in American
society), with which I had not previ
ously had any encounter. I do not in
any way wish this letter to be a con
frontation, but rather wish to ask
some questions.
In his letter, Phillips writes that
blacks v\ere put at a grave disadvan
tage by the Bakke decision in 1976. In
the same breath he says that whites
should not do anything for blacks.
"We don't want your charity We can
do fine for ourselves, thank you."
How much is affirmative action
charity, and how much is it a right that
was won and justly given during the
19605? As a columnist in the Heal
News wrote this quarter, many blacks
at college are here in part because of
the pitiful condition of other blacks.
Is that not charity? This is a real ques
tion for me — I don't have any idea,
In talking to one black friend of mine,
he told me that quotas aren t the real
problem with black college enroll
ment — rather a lack of qualified

applicants was the real problem.
My second question is: What can 1
do without appearing "paternalistic
and insincerely sympathetic" on the
one hand or "quietly racist" on the
other? In his article. Phillips makes a
point about white people making a
movie about blacks and just adding to
the stereotypes. I agree that blacks can
probably portray blacks more ac
curately than whites can. Yet does that
mean that whites should be divorced
from all discussion about racism?
Should those of us who are not black
sit back and say, "It's your problem —
you deal with it?" 1 think not. I feel
that if I agree to stop attempting to be
"sympathetic to the black viewpoint,
then I will be labeled racist. Yet if I
attempt too hard to understand blacks
and their views, then I will be
"paternalistic and guilt-ridden and
told that I don't know what I'm talking
about so would I please shut up. I
desire neither of those results —
rather, I only wish to better under
stand my role in the ongoing struggle
against all forms of racism.

Jewish studies
is important field
Man. - Felstiner, a history professor
at San Francisco State and a frequent

visiting scholar at Stanford, partici
pated in a panel discussion on
women, Judaism and Jewish studies"
during Stanford's celebration of the
new program in Jewish studies. In
describing her research on Jewish
artist Charlotte Salamon, Felstiner
made an excellent argument for the
establishment of an ethnic studies
program at Stanford.
Felstiner said that the groundwork
laid by other feminist scholars has
provided her with the tools to exam
ine Salaman's experience as a female
artist against the backdrop of her time.
But echoing the sentiments of others
on the panel, Felstiner added that
research on Jewish women is as yet so
limited that a comparable method
ology does not yet exist to consider
what impact being Jewish made on
her life and work. For help she turned
to a colleague in black studies and
found the insights gained by one
ethnic study applicable to her own.
The hiring of two distinguished
Jewish scholars is a valuable addition
and an essential component of Stan
ford s new Jewish Studies Program.
But even more important than the
discrete individuals is the establish
ment of an identifiable program
that offers a focal point for debate,
the coalescing of ideas and a stimulus
for new thinking and research. The
spirited and well-attended discussion
on Women, Judaism and Jewish
Studies is just one example of the
vitality generated by the new program.

The birth of this program is the
long-awaited fruition of more than a
decade of discussions within the
University and offers the potential to
make a significant impact on Jewish
scholarship and community leader
ship. But the same potential can and
should he realized by every ethnic
community at Stanford.
The establishment of an ethnic
studies program recognizes the im
portance of such scholarship. As with
the Jewish Studies Program, an ethnic
studies program would advance and
strengthen both scholarship and the
community itself. The synergistic
effect of having every community
pushing the limits of its own scholar
ship is the key to moving us all for
ward as an academic community and
as a society.
