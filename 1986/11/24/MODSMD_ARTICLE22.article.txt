## Team goes horse for fund raising Equestrians look for green 
### SUE TROTT 
An unusual club sport has been in
cluded in the brochures at the Roble
Gym office this fall: the first-ever Stan
ford Equestrian Team.
"But doesn't Stanford already have a
polo team?" is the typical response to
such news. Yes, Stanford does.
However, polo and competitive horse
showing are entirely separate entities.
Led by team president Lisa Yanney, a
group of enthusiastic riders are taking
steps to finally turn the latter into a
reality at Stanford.
The coed team welcomes all inter
ested Stanford students, regardless of
riding experience. "There will be op
portunities for everyone to compete
even though, realistically speaking,
once (the team) is in good enough
shape to hit the show circuit, we're
only talking about showing at most five
horses at a time," said Betty Carmich
ael, the current instructor at the Stan
ford Riding Academy and the
equestrian team's trainer.
Due to lack of funds, coupled with
the inordinate expenses of supporting
and showing horses (the average
single stall rents for approximately

$250 per month), the team only has
access to a few hunter/jumper horses
suitable for intercollegiate competi
tions.
These competitions are broken
down into different classes. The team's
top horsemen will be urging their
mounts over fences in the jumping
classes, while the less advanced riders
will compete in the flat (walk, trot,
canter) classes.
An additional consequence of the
horse shortage is that formal team
practices are out of the question. The
only riding available is through the
Stanford Physical Education Depart
ment — at a steep $300 per quarter —
on schoolhorses "soured" by years of
abuse by beginning riders.
And while some team members are
able to cut the fee by participating in a
student work program, the two hours
of training per week is hardly sufficient
to keep one's riding up to par.
Serious competition will probably
not begin until next fall quarter. The
team's technical existence as a club
sport doesn't counter the fact that at
present it lacks its own horses, uni
