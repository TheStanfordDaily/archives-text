## Team goes horse for fund raising Equestrians look for green 
### SUE TROTT 
An unusual club sport has been in
cluded in the brochures at the Roble
Gym office this fall: the first-ever Stan
ford Equestrian Team.
"But doesn't Stanford already have a
polo team?" is the typical response to
such news. Yes, Stanford does.
However, polo and competitive horse
showing are entirely separate entities.
Led by team president Lisa Yanney, a
group of enthusiastic riders are taking
steps to finally turn the latter into a
reality at Stanford.
The coed team welcomes all inter
ested Stanford students, regardless of
riding experience. "There will be op
portunities for everyone to compete
even though, realistically speaking,
once (the team) is in good enough
shape to hit the show circuit, we're
only talking about showing at most five
horses at a time," said Betty Carmich
ael, the current instructor at the Stan
ford Riding Academy and the
equestrian team's trainer.
Due to lack of funds, coupled with
the inordinate expenses of supporting
and showing horses (the average
single stall rents for approximately

$250 per month), the team only has
access to a few hunter/jumper horses
suitable for intercollegiate competi
tions.
These competitions are broken
down into different classes. The team's
top horsemen will be urging their
mounts over fences in the jumping
classes, while the less advanced riders
will compete in the flat (walk, trot,
canter) classes.
An additional consequence of the
horse shortage is that formal team
practices are out of the question. The
only riding available is through the
Stanford Physical Education Depart
ment — at a steep $300 per quarter —
on schoolhorses "soured" by years of
abuse by beginning riders.
And while some team members are
able to cut the fee by participating in a
student work program, the two hours
of training per week is hardly sufficient
to keep one's riding up to par.
Serious competition will probably
not begin until next fall quarter. The
team's technical existence as a club
sport doesn't counter the fact that at
present it lacks its own horses, uni

forms, equipment and money to pay a
trainer's fee. But the team sees beyond
these current setbacks, setting its sights
instead on one day becoming a
prominent member of the West Coast
intercollegiate hunter/jumper riding
circuit.
"At most we'll attend two shows next
spring, just to let the other schools
know we're here and want to com
pete," said Yanney. "But this upcoming
year is going to be more like one
massive fund-raiser than anything else."
However, once the team is in full
swing, Yanney plans not only to com
pete with nearby schools such as UC-
Berkeley, UC-Davis and Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo, but to take on far-off

schools such as UCLA and USC as well.
But English show riding isn't labeled
the "Sport of the Kings" for nothing.
Consequently, the team held its first
fund-raiser of the year last Sunday — a
horse show at the Stanford Riding
Academy, which, thanks to the organi
zation of sophomore Christy Johnson
(a two-year veteran of the Smith Col
lege equestrian team), proved finan
cially successful enough to initiate
plans for a winter schooling show se
ries.
Prize donations ranged from horse
apparel from local tack shops to coffee
house gift certificates, and local busi
nesses helped out as well by sponsor
ing individual classes in exchange for
advertisement.
The equestrian team also plans to
join forces with the already well
established Stanford polo club for

future fund-raisers and alumni-related
activities. Polo club President Annie
Kreyenberg welcomes the new team,
saying that because the two sports actu
ally complement one another — each
requires entirely different types of
horses and equipment — she doesn't
consider it new competition for
alumni contributions.
Instead, she expresses hopes that, in
working together, the two teams can
make the surrounding horse commu
nity aware of Stanford and eventually
draw a strong common crowd of sup
porters.
Proof that there are people willing
to contribute to the new club sport is
the money that has been donated for
the construction of a new schoolhorse
barn at the Stanford Stables, and the
team's goals for next fall include filling

that new barn with exclusively team
owned horses.
Yanney admits, however, that partic
ular goal needs plenty of money.
"True, we have a lot of talented
riders here," she said. "But the team's

full development — new horses, uni
forms, equipment and training — is
going to take more than just the money
we can make ourselves. We readily
welcome any donations; they're all tax
deductible."
