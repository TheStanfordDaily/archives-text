Habla English?
With elections over, tradition dictates that all the oppos
ing factions close ranks and carry on with governing.
Occasionally, this doesn't happen.
For instance, The Daily Californian was not happy about
the passage of Prop. 63, the English-only initiative, on Nov.
4.
So they translated their masthead into Spanish and
became "El Diario Californiano," which was "Establecido
1871."
"We believe Prop. 63 to be a bigoted, xenophobic slap at
California's non-white population and a dangerous threat to
minority education," explained the newspaper's editorial
board. "Until this ill-considered law is repealed or over
turned by the courts, we urge all Californians actively to dis
obey its provisions."

Meanwhile, back at Tech:
When we last left the crowd at Caltech, they were rather
upset over the renovations being performed in their dorms.
Well, they're still mad.
The Caltech housing authorities have apparently decided
to paint over any blemish on any of the dorm walls as soon
as it appears. This includes decade-old graffiti and acciden
tal scuff marks.
"I and many of my fellow students don't want to live in a
house with virgin blank walls," wrote one outraged (what
other kind are there) reader to the California Tech. "It
seems obvious to me that this is a waste of perfectly good
paint."
And that was all they wrote.
