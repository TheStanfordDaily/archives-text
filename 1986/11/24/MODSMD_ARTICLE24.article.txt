The unthinkable happened, and the Axe
was lost. A Cal team came into Big Game an
18-point underdog and emerged the winner
of the biggest upset in the 89-game history
of the series.
Quarterback Kevin Brown had fans asking
where Kapp had kept him all year, as he
threw for 221 yards to lead Cal to the upset.

Stanford quarterback John Paye, meanwhile,
was running for his life â€” seven times he
didn't quite escape from the paws of Bear
defenders. When he did, receivers like Eric
Snelson were quickly grounded.
The Cal defense held the Cardinal to just
one touchdown, and enabled linebacker
Hardy Nickerson to hold the purloined
trophy aloft for a final time.
