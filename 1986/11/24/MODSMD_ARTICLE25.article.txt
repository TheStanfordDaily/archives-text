# The 						Farm here is Dad's
## Iowa owes a longer look at Stanford athletics

Is it in the East?
It's in Washington, isn't it?
Isn 'tit like around Berkeley?
What is this elusive place? Is it the geographic center of
liberalism in the United States, or perhaps the last BART
stop, or maybe the home of the worst football team in the
country?
Actually it's the location of Stanford University — at least
in the eyes of some students at the University of lowa, lo
cated on the banks of the lowa River in, you guessed it, lowa
City. By the way, their student union is named — get this —
the lowa Memorial Union.
While lowans seem to have a little trouble thinking up
original names for places in their state, they did have some
interesting things to say about the Farm.
The Band recently appeared in the New York Times and
USA Today, but the true testament to its notoriety is found in
the fact that even people in lowa have heard about it.
"I love their marching band," Rick Mann, a trumpet player

in the lowa band, said enthusiastically while the Hawkeyes
pummeled hapless Purdue on the field. 1 like the way
they're creative and do crazy things. You've got to respect
that."
Mann added that he thought the lowa band was pretty
crazy and controversial, too. His statements were borne out
by the band's "wild" halftime show, which included a rock
medley" (by a 200-and-some-odd piece band) and a band
member who "surfed" on a piece of cardboard while a
Beach Boys song was played. The "surfer wore a pair of
"crazy" jams in the 20-degree weather.
Out of control.
Mann also noted that "whenever you hear of Stanford,
you hear of lousy athletics but a lot of smart people. You
hardly hear about the Pac-10 besides UCLA and USC.
Christy Anton, a sophomore from Santa Rosa who attends
lowa, had a little more respect for the Stanford athletic pro
gram, but nonetheless gave it a rather backhanded compli
ment.
"I grew up going to ali the Stanford games, she said, as
lowa, leading 42-7 late in the fourth quarter, went for the
first down on fourth-and-four deep in Purdue territory.
"They could beat lowa right now It's pretty sad."
Julie Nauman, a freshman from Dubuque, lowa, was not
quite as knowledgeable about Stanford and really didn't see
a need to rectify that situation.
"We know nothing about Stanford," she said, as a penalty
pushed the bloodthirsty Hawkeyes back and they were
stopped on the fourth-down play. "We think it's a bigshot'
school. We don't really care, because we'd rather be here."
A tour of the lowa City hot spots — Burger King, Pizza
Hut, Rocky Rococco's and other "swinging" places — that
night elicited some more interesting responses from Hawk
eyes fans glorying in their 42-14 obliteration of 2-8 Purdue.
Most lowans seemed to feel that Stanford is a preppy
school with good academics, although for most the initial
response was one of bewilderment.
"It's one of those places you always hear about but don't
know anything about," said senior Diane Ihlenfeldt from
Springville, lowa.
"Isn't it a prestigious school?... It's just kind of like you

hear of," said freshman Bev Hiller, although she belied her
lack of knowledge about the Farm when she described Stan
ford males as "well-dressed gentlemen."
Brad Cuhoom, a 1984 graduate, claimed he hadn't
"followed Stanford at all," but showed he indeed had,
saying: "Some of the guys (in the Band) dropped their
pants. John Pave, he's tough, (but) it's unfair they play in the
Pac-10." •
Burger King patron Doug Wright from Fort Madison,
lowa, would probably make Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy cringe with his perception of the stereotypical Stan
ford student.
"I'd say a cross between a beach bum and a prep," Wright
said. "Princeton is prep; San Diego State is beach bum."
Has Harvard ever been compared to Daytona Beach State?
"(Stanford) is not that much different than Iowa; I just
think it costs more," sophomore Dianne Kopielski said
before enumerating some of the differences between the
two schools. "Academically, they're much higher. I think
you guys are more liberal — from people that I know who
go there."
Most lowans seem to have heard about Stanford, the Band
and the then-top-20 ranked football team; but when some
one mentions the Farm, the First thing they probably think
of is the place they grew up.
