## Kammen examines Constitution's function

"A Machine That Would Go of
Itself: The Constitution in
American Culture"

Alfred Knopf, New York
$29.95
The Constitution — the legal cor
nernstone of our government — is
soon to celebrate its 200 th birthday. It
has helped this country stay afloat
through the storms of history, yet it
may, in the end, destroy hope for a na
tional unity needed to maintain
America as a great world power.
The Constitution explicitly does
away with the historical common
denominators of a nation, such as
shared religion and the ability of the
government — in most cases — to
coerce loyalty from its citizens. In this
light, the recent passage of the English
only initiative by the voters of Califor
nia can be viewed as a desperate at
tempt to find some bond of cultural
unification, even one as tenuous as
common language.
Which brings us to the
"Constitutional Paradox:" Almost since
its conception, Americans have
focused upon the Constitution as per
haps the most important of our shared
national symbols. The very document
which on the surface disallowed the
guidelines for social cohesion has itself
become America's leading cultural
icon. Indeed, if one were to parse the
national loyalty of socially, culturally
and geographically isolated Americans,
the common thread would probably
be allegiance to a constitution that is
itself vague, uncertain and as shifting as
sand.
This loyalty seems somehow out of
place. The document's wording flatly
declares that the framers did not in
tend to create a national or cultural
symbol. Rather, they structured the
Constitution to act as a pragmatic legal
glue to hold the emerging nation to
gether.
The persistence of "Constitutional

worship ' in America in the face of both
practical intent and practical failure
must represent some resilient need of
the soul for cultural unity. However,
for reasons that are often unfath
omable, the discipline of historical
analysis generally neglects these kinds
of powerful, popular themes, and in
stead focuses on the concrete and of
ten boring details of particular events.
Michael Kammen transcends this ten
dency. For this reason, his new book,
"A Machine That Would Go of Itself:
The Constitution in American Culture,"
deserves special praise. In his
thoroughly researched and spritely
written work, the former Pulitzer Prize
winner explores the history of popular
conceptions of the American Constitu
tion.
Kammen's major contention seems
at first glance to be a truism:
"Americans take too much pride and
proportionally too little interest in
their frame of goverment." Those of us
outside the legal profession have gen
erally considered the Constitution as
an icon instead of a legal document.
We have therefore viewed it as an inde
pendent cultural force rather than a
framework of government which re
quires constant vigilance and input.
When the American people regard
their constitution as an icon, they
regard it as "a machine that would go
of itself."
This is not to say that Kammen
begrudges the Constitution for its cul
tural purpose. He only complains that
this design has made simple constitu
tional knowledge difficult to come by:
"For almost two centuries it has been
swathed in pride yet obscured by indif
ference: a fulsome rhetoric of rever
ence more than offset by the reality of
ignorance."
Further examining popular ignor
ance of the Constitution, Kammen
finds causes other than this problem of
the Constitution as cultural center
piece. For example, he admits that it is
a "dry" document. Moreover, the am
biguous interpretations of the Consti
tution, conflicting ideologies that

were as strong in 1789 as they are
today, have deterred many average
citizens from entering the ruckus. And
then there is the primary, and un
surprising, conclusion: Constitutional
ignorance springs from a lack of
proper education.
His treatment of the "Omega Glory"
episode from "Star Trek" ties the pres
ent college generation's cultural
upbringing into the grand scheme of
American cultural history so well that it
is worth reading in itself, though one
might have time only to browse
through the rest of the book:
"Reducing this saga to its ideological
essence, Captain Kirk and the starship
Enterprise land on a planet where the
inhabitants (the Yangs) are guided by a
Prime Directive' which must not be
violated. Those inhabitants ... possess
a worn, parchment document' that is
the greatest of holies.' Kirk and his
crew encounter a bizarre political sit
uation that is not so different from the
one criticised by James Russel Lowell
in 1888. The Yangs worship 'freedom'
but do not know what it means.
Through the ages it has become a
ritualized 'worship word.' ... It
becomes clear that the institutions of
justice are amazingly resilient — capa
ble of enduring even though their ra
tional has suffered badly from neglect
and amnesia. At the culmination, Cap
tain Kirk informs the Yangs that they
revere a sacred document without un
derstanding what it is all about. En
lightenment then occurs and the great
question — is the Prime Directive still
operative and does it apply to this
planet? — achieves a satisfactory
resolution."
This book makes a strong appeal to
"Constitutional morality": the need for
public attention to the document, with
out which it may become worthless.
The passage concerning the "Omega
Glory" episode summarizes Kammen's
view of the necessary interplay be
tween a people and their system of
government. It also sends a message to
Americans never to deny themselves
the freedom that is their birthright.

Kammen does a wonderful job with
this book. Despite the size and scope
of his endeavor, his style remains
charming, his touch light and his
thematic concerns focused throughout
most of the work.
The American Constitution can func
tion as a cultural icon only if faith in its
applicability is accompanied by knowl
edge of its mechanisms. It is a tension
that still waits for resolution.

erally considered the Constitution as
an icon instead of a legal document.
We have therefore viewed it as an inde
pendent cultural force rather than a
framework of government which re
quires constant vigilance and input.
When the American people regard
their constitution as an icon, they
regard it as "a machine that would go
of itself."
This is not to say that Kammen
begrudges the Constitution for its cul
tural purpose. He only complains that
this design has made simple constitu
tional knowledge difficult to come by:
"For almost two centuries it has been
swathed in pride yet obscured by indif
ference: a fulsome rhetoric of rever
ence more than offset by the reality of
ignorance."
Further examining popular ignor
ance of the Constitution, Kammen
finds causes other than this problem of
the Constitution as cultural center
piece. For example, he admits that it is
a "dry" document. Moreover, the am
biguous interpretations of the Consti
tution, conflicting ideologies that

were as strong in 1789 as they are
today, have deterred many average
citizens from entering the ruckus. And
then there is the primary, and un
surprising, conclusion: Constitutional
ignorance springs from a lack of
proper education.
His treatment of the "Omega Glory"
episode from "Star Trek" ties the pres
ent college generation's cultural
upbringing into the grand scheme of
American cultural history so well that it
is worth reading in itself, though one
might have time only to browse
through the rest of the book:
"Reducing this saga to its ideological
essence, Captain Kirk and the starship
Enterprise land on a planet where the
inhabitants (the Yangs) are guided by a
Prime Directive' which must not be
violated. Those inhabitants ... possess
a worn, parchment document' that is
the greatest of holies.' Kirk and his
crew encounter a bizarre political sit
uation that is not so different from the
one criticised by James Russel Lowell
in 1888. The Yangs worship 'freedom'
but do not know what it means.
Through the ages it has become a
ritualized 'worship word.' ... It
becomes clear that the institutions of
justice are amazingly resilient — capa
ble of enduring even though their ra
tional has suffered badly from neglect
and amnesia. At the culmination, Cap
tain Kirk informs the Yangs that they
revere a sacred document without un
derstanding what it is all about. En
lightenment then occurs and the great
question — is the Prime Directive still
operative and does it apply to this
planet? — achieves a satisfactory
resolution."
This book makes a strong appeal to
"Constitutional morality": the need for
public attention to the document, with
out which it may become worthless.
The passage concerning the "Omega
Glory" episode summarizes Kammen's
view of the necessary interplay be
tween a people and their system of
government. It also sends a message to
Americans never to deny themselves
the freedom that is their birthright.

Kammen does a wonderful job with
this book. Despite the size and scope
of his endeavor, his style remains
charming, his touch light and his
thematic concerns focused throughout
most of the work.
The American Constitution can func
tion as a cultural icon only if faith in its
applicability is accompanied by knowl
edge of its mechanisms. It is a tension
that still waits for resolution.

"A Machine That Would Go of
Itself: The Constitution in
American Culture"
By Michael Kammen
Alfred Knopf, New York
$29.95
The Constitution — the legal cor
nernstone of our government — is
soon to celebrate its 200 th birthday. It
has helped this country stay afloat
through the storms of history, yet it
may, in the end, destroy hope for a na
tional unity needed to maintain
America as a great world power.
The Constitution explicitly does
away with the historical common
denominators of a nation, such as
shared religion and the ability of the
government — in most cases — to
coerce loyalty from its citizens. In this
light, the recent passage of the English
only initiative by the voters of Califor
nia can be viewed as a desperate at
tempt to find some bond of cultural
unification, even one as tenuous as
common language.
Which brings us to the
"Constitutional Paradox:" Almost since
its conception, Americans have
focused upon the Constitution as per
haps the most important of our shared
national symbols. The very document
which on the surface disallowed the
guidelines for social cohesion has itself
become America's leading cultural
icon. Indeed, if one were to parse the
national loyalty of socially, culturally
and geographically isolated Americans,
the common thread would probably
be allegiance to a constitution that is
itself vague, uncertain and as shifting as
sand.
This loyalty seems somehow out of
place. The document's wording flatly
declares that the framers did not in
tend to create a national or cultural
symbol. Rather, they structured the
Constitution to act as a pragmatic legal
glue to hold the emerging nation to
gether.
The persistence of "Constitutional

worship ' in America in the face of both
practical intent and practical failure
must represent some resilient need of
the soul for cultural unity. However,
for reasons that are often unfath
omable, the discipline of historical
analysis generally neglects these kinds
of powerful, popular themes, and in
stead focuses on the concrete and of
ten boring details of particular events.
Michael Kammen transcends this ten
dency. For this reason, his new book,
"A Machine That Would Go of Itself:
The Constitution in American Culture,"
deserves special praise. In his
thoroughly researched and spritely
written work, the former Pulitzer Prize
winner explores the history of popular
conceptions of the American Constitu
tion.
Kammen's major contention seems
at first glance to be a truism:
"Americans take too much pride and
proportionally too little interest in
their frame of goverment." Those of us
outside the legal profession have gen
erally considered the Constitution as
an icon instead of a legal document.
We have therefore viewed it as an inde
pendent cultural force rather than a
