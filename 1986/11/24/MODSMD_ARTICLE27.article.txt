# Bitter end for Kapp, however
## 
### 
His team had just pulled off the big
gest upset in Big Game history, and his
players were squeezing the victor}' for
all it was worth, but, when California
Coach Joe Kapp entered his last
post-game press conference Saturday,
he looked a lot like the Grinch who
was stealing the Big Game celebration
from the Golden Bear faithful.
Kapp, his shirt hanging out and the
scowl on his face staring out at the

media, could not put the rest of the
season behind him. Nor did he seem
to want to.
"Everything that could possibly go
wrong went wrong," Kapp said be
tween one of his many long pauses.
Of course, by beating Stanford 17-
11, the Bears avoided becoming the
losingest team in the school's history,
but Kapp found little consolation in
Saturday's turn of events.
"I've never been through anything
like this year," he said.
Kapp did praise Stanford "for the
tremendous season they've had" and
was complimentary of quarterback
Kevin Brown ("He did a great job of
being ready when his number was
called") and wide receiver Mike Ford
("He was a great recruit").
But he could not hide the fact that he
was a bitter man — bitter about the
treatment that he had received all
season.
Kapp's coaching deficiencies are
well-documented, and after Saturday's
game he even admitted that he had "to
be held accountable" because, as he
had "said all along, we weren't getting
enough wins in the bank."
. Yet, at the same time, he seemed to
think that much of the criticism was
unwarranted. Thus, on Wednesday he
failed to attend the Guardsmen
luncheon, and Saturday he took his
parting shots at the media.
Kapp brushed aside most of the
reporters' questions, and those that he
chose to tackle were answered sarcasti
cally.
One reporter asked him if being
carried off the field on his players'
shoulders was an emotional experi
ence. "That's none of your business,"
Kapp shot back. "But yes, it was....
Why should 1 respond to a man who's
been shooting me down forever? But
yes, I will, because I'm a big person."
Big enough to push aside a KGO
radio interviewer as he made his way
back to his team's locker room after
the press conference.
The Cal players were also frustrated


KEN \
STEVENS
and somewhat disenchanted with the
media this season, hut they could at
least savor the Big Game win for what
it was — a tremendous victory over a
team that was much better on paper.
"Right now it feels great," Cal quar
terback Kevin Brown said. "I'm not
even thinking about the year. The past
is past.''
"I can say 1 went out a winner,"
senior center Chuck Steele said.
"That's what you shoot for. I couldn't
be any happier."
Kapp must have been happy, at least
partially, but he certainly would not
give the media the satisfaction of a
smile. This was really pretty sad.
Not that Kapp owed the media any
thing. But he did owe more to the
school that took a chance on him and
the players who stuck it out with him.
He did make one passing statement
about each, saying that anyone would
"fall in love with this place" and thank
ing the players "who have worked so
hard."
Unfortunately, Kapp had little to say
about the game itself, which had to be
one of the Bears' most impressive vic
tories ever. Why take the spotlight
away from his players so that he could
retaliate at the media?
While at Cal, Kapp never learned a
couple of thines in tec ml to bein<r a

head coach. One, a 1-9 team will not
receive positive reviews. Two, a coach
of a losing team can direct attention
away from his players by taking the
heat himself — whether or not he is
responsible for the team's failure. A
coach must realize that he will be
given too much credit should his team
be successful and too much blame if
his team does not win. This has, and al
ways will be, the case.
If Kapp could have rolled with the
punches and concentrated on coach
ing, a lot of the negative press that he
received probably would have
subsided. Instead, he chose to fuel the
fire.
Thus, Kapp became more of an issue
than his team. The man became more
important than the whole. This might
have been forgiveable when the team
was floundering, but after a huge vic
tory like Saturday's — one that could
have put a whole season of bad
memories in the background — Kapp
should have highlighted his players'
performance in the post-game confer
ence, because, whether he likes it or
not, the media dispenses the informa
tion to the public.
Instead, he described how the
season was like living hell, and this is
what the media will report.
"This has been a nightmare season,"
Kapp said. "I can't think of any more
that could have happened this year to
hurt the program."
Well, Joe, they could have retained
you as coach.

("He was a great recruit").
But he could not hide the fact that he
was a bitter man — bitter about the
treatment that he had received all
season.
Kapp's coaching deficiencies are
well-documented, and after Saturday's
game he even admitted that he had "to
be held accountable" because, as he
had "said all along, we weren't getting
enough wins in the bank."
. Yet, at the same time, he seemed to
think that much of the criticism was
unwarranted. Thus, on Wednesday he
failed to attend the Guardsmen
luncheon, and Saturday he took his
parting shots at the media.
Kapp brushed aside most of the
reporters' questions, and those that he
chose to tackle were answered sarcasti
cally.
One reporter asked him if being
carried off the field on his players'
shoulders was an emotional experi
ence. "That's none of your business,"
Kapp shot back. "But yes, it was....
Why should 1 respond to a man who's
been shooting me down forever? But
yes, I will, because I'm a big person."
Big enough to push aside a KGO
radio interviewer as he made his way
back to his team's locker room after
the press conference.

and somewhat disenchanted with the
media this season, hut they could at
least savor the Big Game win for what
it was — a tremendous victory over a
team that was much better on paper.
"Right now it feels great," Cal quar
terback Kevin Brown said. "I'm not
even thinking about the year. The past
is past.''
"I can say 1 went out a winner,"
senior center Chuck Steele said.
"That's what you shoot for. I couldn't
be any happier."
Kapp must have been happy, at least
partially, but he certainly would not
give the media the satisfaction of a
smile. This was really pretty sad.
Not that Kapp owed the media any
thing. But he did owe more to the
school that took a chance on him and
the players who stuck it out with him.
He did make one passing statement
about each, saying that anyone would
"fall in love with this place" and thank
ing the players "who have worked so
hard."
Unfortunately, Kapp had little to say
about the game itself, which had to be
one of the Bears' most impressive vic
tories ever. Why take the spotlight
away from his players so that he could
retaliate at the media?
While at Cal, Kapp never learned a
couple of thines in tec ml to bein<r a

head coach. One, a 1-9 team will not
receive positive reviews. Two, a coach
of a losing team can direct attention
away from his players by taking the
heat himself — whether or not he is
responsible for the team's failure. A
coach must realize that he will be
given too much credit should his team
be successful and too much blame if
his team does not win. This has, and al
ways will be, the case.
If Kapp could have rolled with the
punches and concentrated on coach
ing, a lot of the negative press that he
received probably would have
subsided. Instead, he chose to fuel the
fire.
Thus, Kapp became more of an issue
than his team. The man became more
important than the whole. This might
have been forgiveable when the team
was floundering, but after a huge vic
tory like Saturday's — one that could
have put a whole season of bad
memories in the background — Kapp
should have highlighted his players'
performance in the post-game confer
ence, because, whether he likes it or
not, the media dispenses the informa
tion to the public.
Instead, he described how the
season was like living hell, and this is
what the media will report.
"This has been a nightmare season,"
Kapp said. "I can't think of any more
that could have happened this year to
hurt the program."
Well, Joe, they could have retained
you as coach.
His team had just pulled off the big
gest upset in Big Game history, and his
players were squeezing the victor}' for
all it was worth, but, when California
Coach Joe Kapp entered his last
post-game press conference Saturday,
he looked a lot like the Grinch who
was stealing the Big Game celebration
from the Golden Bear faithful.
Kapp, his shirt hanging out and the
scowl on his face staring out at the

media, could not put the rest of the
season behind him. Nor did he seem
to want to.
"Everything that could possibly go
wrong went wrong," Kapp said be
tween one of his many long pauses.
Of course, by beating Stanford 17-
11, the Bears avoided becoming the
losingest team in the school's history,
but Kapp found little consolation in
Saturday's turn of events.
"I've never been through anything
like this year," he said.
Kapp did praise Stanford "for the
tremendous season they've had" and
was complimentary of quarterback
Kevin Brown ("He did a great job of
being ready when his number was
called") and wide receiver Mike Ford
("He was a great recruit").
But he could not hide the fact that he
was a bitter man — bitter about the
treatment that he had received all
