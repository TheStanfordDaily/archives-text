# Bitter end for Kapp, however
## 
### 
His team had just pulled off the big
gest upset in Big Game history, and his
players were squeezing the victor}' for
all it was worth, but, when California
Coach Joe Kapp entered his last
post-game press conference Saturday,
he looked a lot like the Grinch who
was stealing the Big Game celebration
from the Golden Bear faithful.
Kapp, his shirt hanging out and the
scowl on his face staring out at the

media, could not put the rest of the
season behind him. Nor did he seem
to want to.
"Everything that could possibly go
wrong went wrong," Kapp said be
tween one of his many long pauses.
Of course, by beating Stanford 17-
11, the Bears avoided becoming the
losingest team in the school's history,
but Kapp found little consolation in
Saturday's turn of events.
"I've never been through anything
like this year," he said.
Kapp did praise Stanford "for the
tremendous season they've had" and
was complimentary of quarterback
Kevin Brown ("He did a great job of
being ready when his number was
called") and wide receiver Mike Ford
("He was a great recruit").
But he could not hide the fact that he
was a bitter man â€” bitter about the
treatment that he had received all
season.
Kapp's coaching deficiencies are
well-documented, and after Saturday's
game he even admitted that he had "to
be held accountable" because, as he
had "said all along, we weren't getting
enough wins in the bank."
. Yet, at the same time, he seemed to
think that much of the criticism was
unwarranted. Thus, on Wednesday he
failed to attend the Guardsmen
luncheon, and Saturday he took his
parting shots at the media.
Kapp brushed aside most of the
reporters' questions, and those that he
chose to tackle were answered sarcasti
cally.
One reporter asked him if being
carried off the field on his players'
shoulders was an emotional experi
ence. "That's none of your business,"
Kapp shot back. "But yes, it was....
Why should 1 respond to a man who's
been shooting me down forever? But
yes, I will, because I'm a big person."
Big enough to push aside a KGO
radio interviewer as he made his way
back to his team's locker room after
the press conference.
The Cal players were also frustrated
