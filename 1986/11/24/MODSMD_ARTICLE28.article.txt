# Stanford over Cal in Splash
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
In front of a record-setting crowd of
4,000 at Spieker Aquatic Center in
Berkeley on Saturday, the No. 1 -ranked
Stanford men's water polo team
crushed third-rated California 11-6 in
the "Big Splash" and set its sights on
the NCAA championships Nov. 28-30.
Coming off three mediocre perfor
mances against No. 4 Pepperdine, No.
6 USC and No. 2 UCLA in the past three
weeks, the Cardinal was looking for a
strong outing before the NCAAs.
It got it.
"This is the kind of game we needed
to give us back our confidence — to
reinforce it for the NCAAs," said Stan
ford Coach Dante Dettamanti.
"The team is peaking right on
schedule," senior David Imbernino
said. "The attitude on our team both
physically and mentally is really good
right now."
Shaking off a tight first quarter, the
33-0 Cardinal scored three un
answered second-period goals and
never looked back. Stanford shut out
Cal's Bill Schoening and limited high
scoring sophomore Kirk Everist to
only one goal It was the Cardinal's fifth
victorv over the Bears this vear. Cal fell
to 27-7.
"I think we feel if we play our
game," Dettamanti said, "nobody can
beat us. The game was a positive way to
end the season prior to the NCAAs "
Senior Greg Gamble and junior

Erich Fischer scored three goals each
to lead the Cardinal.
Gamble has now scored 27 goals
this year. With his three goals, Fischer
increased his team-leading scoring
total to 81 goals and is only one goal
away from James Bergeson's single
season Stanford scoring record of 82
goals.
With its 33rd victory this season,
Stanford extended its NCAA-record
consecutive win streak to 42 games,
dating back to last season.
The prospects for a Cardinal win did
not look promising in the early going,
however. Cal, buoyed by its home
crowd, came out on fire in the first
quarter.
The Bears hit the post on two shots
in the game's opening minutes and
were shutting down Stanford's high
powered offense.
Only a counterattack goal by Imber
nino and a quick shot by Fischer found
their way into the Cal goal. Stanford
was leading just 2-1 at the end of the
first quarter.
"We were a little hesitant in the first
quarter," Dettamanti said. "We had ?
little trouble getting our offense
going."
In only permitting two first-period
goals, Cal's predominant tactic was to
foul senior All-America hole man Craig
Klass every time he touched the ball
and force the Cardinal to shoot from
outside. Klass, who has scored 77 goals


ienior Greg Gamble had perhaps his best game of the season Saturday,
icoring three goals in Stanford's 11-6 win over Cal. "Everybody took up the

Mike Topoiovac/Daily
slack, especially Greg Gamble. He seems to do really well against Berkeley,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamante said.
this season, did not score in the con
test.
"I can't remember the last time
Craig hasn't scored in a game," Detta
manti said. "That is really unusual."
Despite the virtual nullification of

Klass, Stanford was able to produce
scoring from other sources. Such is the
luxury of a talent-laden team.
"They did shut us down inside,"
Klass said. "But its not like we do not
have guys that can score from the
outside."
Benefitting from the attention given
to Klass were Gamble, Imbernino, Matt
Tingler and senior Greg Ocasek. With
Cal pressing the two-meter men on the
regular front-court offense as well as

the six-on-live, outside shooters were
given more room than usual, Imber
nino and Tingler scored two goals
each, with Ocasek tallying one.
"One of the things that we have
done this year is take what the defense
has given us and adjust to it," Tingler
said. "Both Gamble and Ocasek took
good shots from the outside when they
(Cal) were pressing Erich (Fischer)
and Klass."
In addition, sophomore goalie Todd

Kemp thwarted several Bear shot at
tempts and kept Cal from getting some
early goals.
"Todd played an excellent game,"
Dettamanti said. "He matches up well
with Cal. He is better than Obi
(Greenman) at stealing the ball when
players have inside water."
One solid quarter was all the Bears
could manage against the Cardinal,
however, as Stanford pulled away to a
5-1 lead by halftime.

Tingler and Gamble ignited the
Cardinal offense by scoring on
counter-attack goals. Ocasek also
scored in the second period.
"The counter-attack was the key to
the whole thing,'' Dettamanti said.
"The turning point in the game was
when Cal made a few defensive
mistakes
"We played good water polo," Im
bernino said. "We didn't let them (Cal)
back into the game."

Cal's Bill Schoening and limited high
scoring sophomore Kirk Everist to
only one goal It was the Cardinal's fifth
victorv over the Bears this vear. Cal fell
to 27-7.
"I think we feel if we play our
game," Dettamanti said, "nobody can
beat us. The game was a positive way to
end the season prior to the NCAAs "
Senior Greg Gamble and junior

Erich Fischer scored three goals each
to lead the Cardinal.
Gamble has now scored 27 goals
this year. With his three goals, Fischer
increased his team-leading scoring
total to 81 goals and is only one goal
away from James Bergeson's single
season Stanford scoring record of 82
goals.
With its 33rd victory this season,
Stanford extended its NCAA-record
consecutive win streak to 42 games,
dating back to last season.
The prospects for a Cardinal win did
not look promising in the early going,
however. Cal, buoyed by its home
crowd, came out on fire in the first
quarter.
The Bears hit the post on two shots
in the game's opening minutes and
were shutting down Stanford's high
powered offense.
Only a counterattack goal by Imber
nino and a quick shot by Fischer found
their way into the Cal goal. Stanford
was leading just 2-1 at the end of the
first quarter.
"We were a little hesitant in the first
quarter," Dettamanti said. "We had ?
little trouble getting our offense
going."
In only permitting two first-period
goals, Cal's predominant tactic was to
foul senior All-America hole man Craig
Klass every time he touched the ball
and force the Cardinal to shoot from
outside. Klass, who has scored 77 goals


ienior Greg Gamble had perhaps his best game of the season Saturday,
icoring three goals in Stanford's 11-6 win over Cal. "Everybody took up the

slack, especially Greg Gamble. He seems to do really well against Berkeley,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamante said.
this season, did not score in the con
test.
"I can't remember the last time
Craig hasn't scored in a game," Detta
manti said. "That is really unusual."
Despite the virtual nullification of

Klass, Stanford was able to produce
scoring from other sources. Such is the
luxury of a talent-laden team.
"They did shut us down inside,"
Klass said. "But its not like we do not
have guys that can score from the
outside."
Benefitting from the attention given
to Klass were Gamble, Imbernino, Matt
Tingler and senior Greg Ocasek. With
Cal pressing the two-meter men on the
regular front-court offense as well as

the six-on-live, outside shooters were
given more room than usual, Imber
nino and Tingler scored two goals
each, with Ocasek tallying one.
"One of the things that we have
done this year is take what the defense
has given us and adjust to it," Tingler
said. "Both Gamble and Ocasek took
good shots from the outside when they
(Cal) were pressing Erich (Fischer)
and Klass."
In addition, sophomore goalie Todd

Kemp thwarted several Bear shot at
tempts and kept Cal from getting some
early goals.
"Todd played an excellent game,"
Dettamanti said. "He matches up well
with Cal. He is better than Obi
(Greenman) at stealing the ball when
players have inside water."
One solid quarter was all the Bears
could manage against the Cardinal,
however, as Stanford pulled away to a
5-1 lead by halftime.

Tingler and Gamble ignited the
Cardinal offense by scoring on
counter-attack goals. Ocasek also
scored in the second period.
"The counter-attack was the key to
the whole thing,'' Dettamanti said.
"The turning point in the game was
when Cal made a few defensive
mistakes
"We played good water polo," Im
bernino said. "We didn't let them (Cal)
back into the game."
In front of a record-setting crowd of
4,000 at Spieker Aquatic Center in
Berkeley on Saturday, the No. 1 -ranked
Stanford men's water polo team
crushed third-rated California 11-6 in
the "Big Splash" and set its sights on
the NCAA championships Nov. 28-30.
Coming off three mediocre perfor
mances against No. 4 Pepperdine, No.
6 USC and No. 2 UCLA in the past three
weeks, the Cardinal was looking for a
strong outing before the NCAAs.
It got it.
"This is the kind of game we needed
to give us back our confidence — to
reinforce it for the NCAAs," said Stan
ford Coach Dante Dettamanti.
"The team is peaking right on
schedule," senior David Imbernino
said. "The attitude on our team both
physically and mentally is really good
right now."
Shaking off a tight first quarter, the
33-0 Cardinal scored three un
answered second-period goals and
never looked back. Stanford shut out
Cal's Bill Schoening and limited high
