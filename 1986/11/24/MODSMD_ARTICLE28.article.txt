# Stanford over Cal in Splash
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
In front of a record-setting crowd of
4,000 at Spieker Aquatic Center in
Berkeley on Saturday, the No. 1 -ranked
Stanford men's water polo team
crushed third-rated California 11-6 in
the "Big Splash" and set its sights on
the NCAA championships Nov. 28-30.
Coming off three mediocre perfor
mances against No. 4 Pepperdine, No.
6 USC and No. 2 UCLA in the past three
weeks, the Cardinal was looking for a
strong outing before the NCAAs.
It got it.
"This is the kind of game we needed
to give us back our confidence â€” to
reinforce it for the NCAAs," said Stan
ford Coach Dante Dettamanti.
"The team is peaking right on
schedule," senior David Imbernino
said. "The attitude on our team both
physically and mentally is really good
right now."
Shaking off a tight first quarter, the
33-0 Cardinal scored three un
answered second-period goals and
never looked back. Stanford shut out
Cal's Bill Schoening and limited high
scoring sophomore Kirk Everist to
only one goal It was the Cardinal's fifth
victorv over the Bears this vear. Cal fell
to 27-7.
"I think we feel if we play our
game," Dettamanti said, "nobody can
beat us. The game was a positive way to
end the season prior to the NCAAs "
Senior Greg Gamble and junior

Erich Fischer scored three goals each
to lead the Cardinal.
Gamble has now scored 27 goals
this year. With his three goals, Fischer
increased his team-leading scoring
total to 81 goals and is only one goal
away from James Bergeson's single
season Stanford scoring record of 82
goals.
With its 33rd victory this season,
Stanford extended its NCAA-record
consecutive win streak to 42 games,
dating back to last season.
The prospects for a Cardinal win did
not look promising in the early going,
however. Cal, buoyed by its home
crowd, came out on fire in the first
quarter.
The Bears hit the post on two shots
in the game's opening minutes and
were shutting down Stanford's high
powered offense.
Only a counterattack goal by Imber
nino and a quick shot by Fischer found
their way into the Cal goal. Stanford
was leading just 2-1 at the end of the
first quarter.
"We were a little hesitant in the first
quarter," Dettamanti said. "We had ?
little trouble getting our offense
going."
In only permitting two first-period
goals, Cal's predominant tactic was to
foul senior All-America hole man Craig
Klass every time he touched the ball
and force the Cardinal to shoot from
outside. Klass, who has scored 77 goals


ienior Greg Gamble had perhaps his best game of the season Saturday,
icoring three goals in Stanford's 11-6 win over Cal. "Everybody took up the

slack, especially Greg Gamble. He seems to do really well against Berkeley,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamante said.
