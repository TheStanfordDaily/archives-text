# Fencers foil Berkeley

### 
It was the Big Match at Roble Gym
last Friday as the Stanford men's and
women's fencing teams took on Cali
fornia. In this match-up, Stanford
emerged victorious, with a close 15-12
win.
Stanford has had one of the top fen
cing programs on the West Coast in
recent years. The women's team has
been the defending regional champion
three years in a row, and the men have
won the regional title two of the last
four years. This season, however, the
Cardinal is relatively inexperienced,
with a number of players recruited
from spring quarter fencing classes.
"A lot of teams are gunning for us,"
Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst said. "We
have less experience. The women and
the men are in the enviable — or un
enviable — position where it would
make teams' entire seasons to beat us."
That's certainly what California came
out trying to do, but the Bears were
thwarted initially by the women's team,
which started things off on the right
foot for Stanford with an 11-5 win.
Seniors Holly Taylor and Alyson

Yarus and freshman Elizabeth Spillman
all went 3-1 on the day, while junior
Alexandra Rankin was 2-2.
"Cal had basically the same team as
last year," Hurst said. "We beat them
decisively last year, but we had a
powerhouse team. The team is all vir
tually beginners this year, but they
took command at the beginning
against a more experienced team.
"Holly Taylor did the job you would
expect; she's a skilled veteran. She's
not expected to lose a bout, but it hap
pens ... the less experienced people
picked up the slack. It was a real great
effort on the part of our young
people," Hurst added.
The women's team has now won
two in a row to open the season, after
previously downing UC-Santa Cruz 10-
6. "They're following in the footsteps
of the women's team last year," Hurst
said. "Suprisingly so."
California jumped out to an 8-1 lead
over the Stanford men's fencing team
following the foil competition.
The Cardinal then narrowly edged
Cal in the men's epee match-up 5-4,

and the men's sabre team followed
with an impressive 9-0 outing to give
Stanford a 15-12 comeback win. Senior
co-captain Steve Levitan and juniors
Mike Kramer and David Fishman all
were 3-0 against the Bears.
"They turned in a sterling perfor
mance," Hurst said. "They didn't lose a
bout, and they also didn't give up many
touches. The real key that gave us vic
tory was the epee team. That was our
most dramatic win. It was a real star
tling comeback — as a coach, I could
stand a few less exciting moments."
Inexperience was not as much of a
drawback as anticipated. Sophomore
Lee Tankersley in particular drew
praise from Hurst for his play in the
epee competition. Tankersley was 2-1
and defeated Cal's No. 1 player. "It was
a sophomore beginner against a senior
veteran, and the beginner beat him,"
Hurst said. "It took a lot of courage."
The Stanford program is attracting
national recognition. Defending na
tional champion Notre Dame learned
that the Cardinal is making a mid-West
trip in January and called to arrange a
match with Stanford on Jan. 16. It will
be the first meeting between the two
teams. "That means a lot more than
coaches' polls," Hurst said. "It says a lot
more for our efforts than anything else
when a team like Notre Dame goes out
of their way to fence us."
