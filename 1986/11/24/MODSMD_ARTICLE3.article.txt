# Toxics haven't tainted local water
## University tests show Barron Park water safe to drink 
### TOM OSCHHRWITZ Senior staff writer 
New tests of six wells in the Barron Park area
reveal that the wells continue to be safe for drinking,
but a seventh previously untested well contains
traces of trichloroethylene (TCP.) in excess of estab
lished state levels for drinking water, according to
Andv Doty, director of Community Relations.
The I'niversitv offerred to retest the wells,
originally examined last January, after PCB spills this
summer in Matadero Creek aroused concern among
residents of Barron Park over the purity of their
drinking water, Doty said.
Barron Park is located downstream from the Stan
ford Research Park, the site of several industrial re
search buildings.
Of the six wells tested hist January and recently re
tested, five no longer contain detectable levels ot ot
ganic chemicals, while the sixth registered a slight
increase in TCE, from 0.6S parts per billion (ppb) to
1.1 ppb.
The seventh well, whose owner previously did not
permit the test, contained 0.54 ppb of
trichloroethane (TCA) and 9.S ppb of TCE The
amount of TCK was five ppb over the acceptable level
for the chemical set by the State Department of
Health Services (DOHS).
Stanford reported its findings on the seunth well

to DOHS and intends to retest the well in the near
future, according Zera Murphy, associate director of
University Lands Management.
While some of the wells are used for irrigation,
none are actually used for drinking purposes, Doty
said.
"We re pleased with these results and hope they
are reassuring to our Barron Park neighbors." Dotv
told the Times Tribune yesterday.
The tests of the wells in the Barron Park area first
began after Watkins Johnson Co. discovered toxic
chemicals -t" 7 feet below its property in 19H » and re
ported its findings to the DOHS.
In response to the findings, the DOHS ordered
that all wells in a one-mile radius of the contamina
tion be tested Seven ground wells fit this criteria.
The tests on these wells were delayed, however, as
companies in the research park denied responsibilty
and refused to pick up the cost of the tests, Doty said.
According to Watkins-Johnson Co., it had not
leaked any chemicals into the water supply, and,
therefore, the company claimed that the source of
the contamination was upstream. Doty said.
In the ensuing arguments over responsibility , the
University decided to intervene and pay for the tests
itself rather than let the matter sit. Doty said. This is
a one-time thing,... Stanford is not establishing a
precedent, he said.
All results of the test w ill be sent to the DOHS and

to the Palo Alto Main Library on Newell Road.
W title Don said that Stanford owns the land in
Stanford Research Hark, he added that the park is an
nexed to Palo Alto and is subject to the cit\ s regula
tion on toxics. Ordinarily, the company that
deposited the spill would pay for the clean-up. he
said.
Doty noted that the DOHS is still investigatin, the
cause of the spill. How the chemicals got in ) the
groundwater and where they came from at two
questions that still remain, lie said.
DOHS is involved in a slow and deliberate s hto
find the causes. The investigation will take .> >ut a
year to complete. Doty said
The campus has its own radiological, bactet 'logi
cal and toxicological department under the dii tion
of Dr. Alain De Cleve Phis department han< -s all
toxic problems on the campus. Doty said
This summer, the I'niversity joined the Hazardous
Materials Coordinating Council, a council designed
to centralize communication about toxii chemical
use at the Stanford Research Park The members of
the council include University representatives, the
tenants in the research park, Barron Park residents
and representatives from the citv of Palo Alto
The University also co-signed .1 letter with Palo
Alto "urging < research park tenants) t( > look carefully
at storm drains and other channels that flow into the
creek. Doty said in July.
