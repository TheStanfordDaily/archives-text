# Women runners go to NCAAs

### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
After a one-year hiatus and a very
successful 1986 season, the Stan
ford women's cross country- team
returns to NCAA championship
competition today in Tuscon, Ariz.
The squad assured itself a berth
with strong conference title perfor
mances, taking third place at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships at Stanford Nov. 3 and finish
ing second at the District-8
Regionals last Monday in Fresno.
The men's team will not be
joining the women in Arizona. The

Cardinal men finished fifth at the
District-8 Regionals, with only the
top three teams getting NCAA spots.
In addition, Marc Olesen, the top
scoring runner returning from last
year's finals, failed to qualify indi
vidually as well, falling short by one
place.
This fact, however, hasn't
detracted from Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson's enthusiasm. "I'm
excited and delighted," he said.
Surprisingly, Johnson is not
overly concerned with a victory, but
rather hopes that his team exits
the season with no bad feelings. "The
attitude is that this is just another race,"
he said. "We're not going to get all
adrenalated about it.
"It's essentially a case of us not get
ting uptight, and we'll do alright,"
Johnson added. "It's more important to
get out of cross country with a positive
attitude."
Many eyes will be turned to fresh
man Carol Gray, who has consistently
finished highest for the Cardinal for
the season. Most recently, Gray took
third at both the Pac-lOs and the
District-Bs. Johnson, however, refuses
to become overconfident or overex
pectant for the finals.
"Gray is just a freshman, so she is
still young," he said. With all rookie

runners, "I don't want to put pressure
on them, because everyone hits the
wall sometime."
Gray's teammates have put in fine
performances as well this season, com
plementing her finishes. Kathy Smith,
Cor}- Schubert and Christa Curtin have
run strongly, all finishing in the top 20
at District-Bs, and Kim Stevens and
Brenda Steenhof have also registered
great efforts.
