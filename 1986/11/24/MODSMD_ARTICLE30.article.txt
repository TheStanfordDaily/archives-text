successful 1986 season, the Stan
ford women's cross country- team
returns to NCAA championship
competition today in Tuscon, Ariz.
The squad assured itself a berth
with strong conference title perfor
mances, taking third place at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships at Stanford Nov. 3 and finish
ing second at the District-8
Regionals last Monday in Fresno.
The men's team will not be
joining the women in Arizona. The

Cardinal men finished fifth at the
District-8 Regionals, with only the
top three teams getting NCAA spots.

scoring runner returning from last

place.

detracted from Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson's enthusiasm. "I'm
excited and delighted," he said.

overly concerned with a victory, but
rather hopes that his team exits
