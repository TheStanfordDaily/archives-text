### CHRIS CRADER EVAN TUCHINSKY 
This weekend in Los Angeles showed the Stanford
women's volleyball team that a top squad can enter a
match flat yet still heat most teams, but be soundly
defeated by another top team playing at its best.
The Cardinal (.20-9, 16-2 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) was defeated by now-Pac-10-Champion UCLA
(30-9,16-1, with one to play in league action) in three
games, 11-15,13-15,4-15, Friday night, but came back
Saturday to beat USC in the same number, win
ning 15-2, 15-13 and 15-13.
"We didn t play well, Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said, describing Friday night's match. "I.'CLA did play
well, as well as I've seen them play all season. It was
their night, just as it was ours when they played up
here (Oct. 18)."
The first game started out fairly evenly, with an oc
casional point separated by many side outs. The
scoring picked up in the second half, with Julie
Barnes, Bruin junior back-court specialist, serving up
four consecutive points, which were quickly coun
tered by three behind the serves of Stanford fresh
man Lara Asper, making the score 10-9 UCLA.
After the Bruins raced to a 14-11 lead, a Stanford
overpass led to an Ann Boyer kill, abruptly ending
the game.
Game two was the heartbreaker for the Stanford
team. The Cardinal stepped out to an early 12-3, be
hind three aces by Teresa Smith and two by Lara
Asper. But 12 points does not win a game.
The Bruins slowly crept back to 13-9 by siding out
well and only allowing the Cardinal to score one
point. There the score stayed for more than four
minutes, as the two teams recorded 20 consecutive
side outs.
The stalemate was broken with a hitting error by
Stanford. Lisa Ettesvold, I'CLA's senior Ail-American
middle blocker, served up four points to tie the score
at 13. After a short series of serves, a Bruin block con
cluded the second game.
Stanford came out in game three and garnered a 2-
1 lead, but was unable to hold UCLA for the
remainder of the match. A well-balanced attack
brought the Bruins to a 13-4 lead, when two more
Boyer kills ended the match.
"It boils down to simple things," Stanford Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves said. "They played very well.
They blocked and defensed us very well. They had a
game plan, executed and stuck with it."
UCLA Coach Andy Eanachowski agreed. "We
played better, blocked better and dug better," he
said.
The Stanford players had a slightly different assess
ment. "I guess we weren't prepared mentally," soph
omore middle blocker Laura Olesen said. "It just
wasn't one of our days."
Junior All-American setter Wendi Rush echoed her
teammate's sentiments. "We didn't have a good warm
up, and people weren't ready to go," Rush said. "We
were nervous and not confident.
"We didn't play like we could win. There were a

lot of blank faces looking to someone else for some
thing to happen," she added.
Graduate assistant Terri Bryson summed up the
evening with a prophetic "there's more to come."
The next night at USC was a totally different ball
game. The sadly undermanned Trojans, now 2-29
and 0-17 in the Pac-10, posed no significant threat to
the Cardinal, by USC Coach Chuck Erbe's own admis
sion. "We don't match up physically. They should

win," he said.
The Trojan roster reads like a casualty list, with
three regular starters out of action and freshman set
ter Kathy Rich hampered by a knee injury. Jamie
Hatchett and Trisonya Thompson have ankle prob
lems, and pre-season Ail-American Yvonne Lewis is
suffering from a chronic knee ailment.

Barbra Fontana's team-leading 20 kills weren't enough to lift Stanford over UCLA last Friday, as the
Cardinal fell in three games to the Pac-10 champions. The senior hitter led the squad in digs at USC
Saturday with 15. Stanford defeated the Trojans in three games.
