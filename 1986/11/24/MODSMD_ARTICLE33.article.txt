# Band returns without a hitch

### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
The Band returned to the playing
field for Big Game Saturday and
delivered two shows that were enter
taining but not particularly humorous,
students and Band members say.
Band Manager Jeff Stevens said both
the pre-game and halftime perfor
mances, while not "incredibly funny,"
were still "decent shows."
"We decided to be topical rather
than crazy," Stevens said.
Although initially suspended by Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger from
playing on the field at the football
game, the Band reached an agreement
with Geiger last Wednesday to let the
Band perform. Geiger had suspended
the Band Nov. 5.
By all accounts, the two shows did
not contain the Band's trademark
sense of obscene humor, and the
Band, complete with tin foil halos
taped on to their jackets, made a con
certed effort to avoid controversey.
Geiger said he was "delighted" with
the perfomances, and many seemed to
agree.
According to junior Paul Salm, the
shows were "reasonably entertaining,
if more restrained than in the past."

Junior Jim Jen said the two perfor
mances were "kind of cute.
Others, however, missed the
obscene flavoring to Band antics.
Senior Curt Castellanet said, I thought
it was really tame. If they're not going
to march and be a real serious band,
then they might as well be vulgar and
disgusting."
Junior Ed Fulton said,"lt would be a
tragedy if the Stanford Band was forced
to turn into what the Cal Band is
boring." Fulton added that he wuld
"like (the Band) to be more controver
sial but not completely vulgar. You can
be tastefully crude."
Geiger's declaration that the Band
remain alcohol-free both before and
during the game — a condition the
Band had to meet to play in the game
— proved to have little effect on the
Band, according to Chris Schraeder,
the Band's public relations director. "I
don't think people really thought it was
different," Schraeder said.
Although he only wanted an infor
mal agreement on Band behavior
before allowing the Band to play at Big
Game, Geiger still says a formal Band
charter needs to be reached. He said,
however, that he and the Band man
agement will not work on the docu
ment until after the Gator Bowl.
