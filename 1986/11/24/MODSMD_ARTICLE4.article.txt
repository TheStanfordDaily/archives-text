# Students support Western Culture
## 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Eighty percent of students who have
completed Stanford's Western Culture
program called it "a positive academic
experience," according to results of
student course evaluations from 1984-
35 Western Culture classes.
In addition, 66 percent were "glad"
the course was required, and 33 per
cent of the students surveyed would
have taken one of the eight sequences
without the requirement.
"These are about the best statistics
I've ever seen," said William Chace,
vice provost for Academic Planning
and Development. Adding that stu
dents "usually don't like required
courses," he labeled the results "very
gratifying."
The survey also found that 76 per
cent of students thought they had
gained "a useful understanding of the
major factors that have shaped Western
culture "
Two-thirds of the students said the
course "increased their ability to read
and interpret written works," and
about half said the course made them
more interested in pursuing
humanities and the social sciences.
"Vi e have a good course, and one we
should be proud of. The questionnaire
showed that students liked the experi
ence and found it to be valuable,"
Chace said.
Among graduating seniors, the self
assessed ability to "understand the de
velopment of Western culture" has
risen noticeably since the requirement
was adopted.
The proportion of seniors rating
themselves "good" or "excellent'' in
this respect was S5 percent in 1985.
compared with 43 percent in 1980.
Those ranking their ability "very poor
or "poor" dropped to nine percent
from 24 percent.
According to Charles Junkerman, as
sistant to the dean of Undergraduate

Affairs, the Western Culture statistics,
coupled with a survey given to depart
ing seniors show that "the Western
Culture experience is rated as a high
water mark" of the students' Stanford
education.
The current debate over whether a
world culture program should replace
Western Culture has prompted a care
ful examination of the sequences and
the core reading list. In addition, the
absence of minorities and women on
the required and recommended
reading lists has led to criticism of the
program as too narrow. Chace said he
considers the program "imperfect" but
that he sees the "hard-working faculty"
and vigorous student response as en
couraging signs of the program's value.
Chace said he sees the "ability to
make students more familiar with the
sources of Western culture" as signifi
cant. Referring to the reading core, he
said, "The basic form, phrases and
cliches that we use come from those
works. NX'e are embedded in Plato, Aris
totle, Darwin, Freud and Kant."
According to Chace, the current pro
gram will grow in the next few years to
include works by minorities and
women.
Barry Katz, a lecturer in the Values,
Technology, Science and Society track
and a member of the Provost's Western
Culture Task Force, cautioned against
complacency over the statistics and
questioned whether the core readings
really reflected the course of Western
culture.
Referring to the make-up of the 20
percent of students who indicated that
they were dissatisfied with the pro
gram, Katz said he would be encour
aged if the negative opinions came
from diverse ethnic backgrounds and
both genders.
But, if the 20 percent is concen
trated in one ethnic group, then there
is cause for concern. If minority stu
dents feel alienated, that's something
we have to look at. Katz said.
