It's here,
The much-anticipated Stanford
Student Directory will be dis
tributed to students and facultv
ft >da\
The directory contains the phone
numbers and addresses of all
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents who filled out the appropri
ate forms at the start of the school
year. It also h.is the numbers of all
campus departments and organiza
tions.
Improvements in this year s
directory include drasticalh in

creased advertising and coupon
sections, said senior John Fer
nandez director)' project director
A near 50-percent increase in this
year s advertisement section will
make the director) ;i better refer
ence guide for area entertainment
and services, said senior Trask
Leonard, advertising manager for
the director)
The restaurant section now lists
restaurants according to their
cuisine and location relative to the
Stanford campus, Leonard said
To improve the coupon section,
Fernades explained, the coupons
are printed in red ink on heavier paper
so they will be more prominent.
Located in the back of the book, the
coupons offer discounts on a variety of
items ranging from pizza to carpets,
Fernandez said. Domino's Pizza and
the Acapulco restaurant are new addi
tions to this year's coupon section.
The company recruitment section
has also increased, Leonard said, and
students looking for jobs should look
in the front of the directory.
This year's increase in advertise
ments and coupons is largely a result
of the impressive appearance of last
year's cover, Leonard said. The cover
was used for a demonstration model
and on business cards and bills.
With last year's directory as an exam
ple, "merchants are seeing how
valuable Stanford business is," Fer
nandes said. "They want student busi
ness, and the directory is a great way to
advertise."
Each year, the management staff
selects the cover design from the
drawings of a pool of applicants who
submit designs to the directory project,
Fernandes said. The artist of last year's
cover received $600, he added.
In addition to Fernandes and
Leonard, the management staff this
year also included editor Cindy Weis
man, who designed all of the advertise
ments and laid out the the entire book,
according to Fernandes.
They started work on the project in
April and hired eight students for their
sales staff in June. Together, the 13 staff
members worked full-time through
the summer to organize the book by
selling and compiling advertisements
and by gathering information on
various University departments and
student organizations.
Every year, the directory is sched
uled to come out during Big Game
week, causing some students to

wonder why the directory doesn't
arrive sooner.
It's not due to a hold-up on the part
of the directory staff, Fernandes ex
plained. The gathering of student
names and information isn't com
pleted until a few weeks into the term,
and entering them into the registrar's
computer system takes longer still, he
said. This year, there are 700 more
names than the staff anticipated, so last

minute revisions caused the unveiling
of this year's directory to be delayed by
one weekend.
The directories will be delivered to
on-campus undergraduates through
their dorms. Graduate students and
university staff can pick up their direc
tories at their departments. Off-campus
undergraduates will recieve a note in
their mailboxes on where to pick up
their copies.
