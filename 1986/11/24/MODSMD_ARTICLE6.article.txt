Boesky aids government probe
WASHINGTON — Stock speculator Ivan Boesky has provided federal in
vestigators with videotape recordings, made with hidden cameras, of his
meetings with Wall Street professionals who provided him with advance
tips on corporate takeovers, according to sources close to the investigation.
The videotaped meetings and audio recordings of Boesky's telephone
conversations, dating back at least seven weeks, are expected to form the
basis for the next series of moves in the government's crackdown on the
insider trading networks centered on Boesky and Dennis Levine, a former
investment banker with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the sources said.
At least one other investment banker is cooperating with investigators
after being implicated by the recordings, sources said. Boesky and Levine
have been supplying investigators with names of their Wall Street contacts
who shared illegal tips about takeovers or other major corporate develop
ments, thus reaping millions of dollars in insider trading profits.
On Nov. 14, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that
Boesky had agreed to forfeit $50 million in illegal insider trading profits,
pay a $50 million penalty and plead guilty to an unspecified criminal
charge. The SEC said Boesky agreed to pay Levine $2.4 million for a series
of leaks about upcoming takeovers and major corporate actions that Levine
had learned about from Drexel's clients or other Wall Street sources.
Boesky's use of such confidential information to buy and sell securities vio
lated federal laws against insider trading, the SEC said.
Mubarak, Hussein warn U.S.
CAIRO, Egypt — The leaders of Egypt and Jordan, two of the most impor
tant U.S. allies in the Middle East, warned the Reagan administration yester
day that its credibility in the Arab world has been harmed by its covert
supply of arms to Iran.
Commenting publicly on the controversy for the first time, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said he found the still-unfolding reports about
the arms shipments to Iran astonishing.
The president spoke to reporters at the close of two days of talks with
Jordan's King Hussein, who had already characterized the Reagan adminis
tration's secret dealings with Iran as incomprehensible and "an insult to all
Arabs."
Mubarak, whose nearly bankrupt government is in the middle of
sensitive negotiations with Washington over the refinancing of $4.5 billion
in back military debt, was more restrained.
"I have asked him, and I am still asking, (that) the United States do some
thing so as not to lose its credibility in the Arab world because of this act. I
hope something can be done in the very near future... because lam afraid
(U.S. credibility) is starting to deteriorate," Mubarak said in a tone that sug
gested an appeal.
However, senior Egyptian officials have repeatedly urged the Reagan ad
ministration to become more involved in the floundering Middle East
peace process.
Shultz' Iran position criticized
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz, who has carefully
sought to distance himself from the White House decision to send arms to
Iran, was sharply criticized yesterday for not supporting President Reagan
publicly in a time of crisis for his administration.
At the same time, evidence continues to mount that Shultz knew more
about arms shipments this year to Iran than he has acknowledged, but
decided not to fight what he knew was the president's strong desire to at
tempt to gain release of American hostages in Lebanon, even by offering
arms.
A top State Department official said that Shultz initially fought the deci
sion, but after the president had made up his mind, Shultz decided not to
use up his credit with Reagan by raising the issue again. At the same time,
he allowed his top aides to remain in the dark.
In an unusually direct blast against Shultz, Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
who will be minority leader in the new Congress, said he was having diffi
culty supporting Reagan's decision because "it's fairly difficult when the
secretary of state is not doing anything."
Gorbachev: SDI may halt talks
NEW DELHI, India — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned the
Reagan administration yesterday that its Strategic Defense Initiative could
bring arms talks to a halt.
In a two-hour broadcast interview with Indian journalists in his Kremlin
office, Gorbachev signaled that the future of arms control will be a major
focus of his talks this week with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who
has taken an active role both within the Nonaligned Movement and with
other world leaders in pressing for nuclear disarmament.
Gorbachev begins a four-day visit to the Indian capital tommorrow in an
effort to reinforce the close ties that have marked Soviet-Indian relations
for three decades.
He is likely to find fertile ground for his arguments on SDI in India,
which has been highly critical of that program for research into a space
based antimissile system.
In addition, there were widespread reports in the press here yesterday
that Moscow, in continuing arms sales here, will begin delivery of the ad
vanced MiG-29 aircraft to India next month. This would be the first delivery
of the plane outside the Soviet Union.
Kirk calls for 'campaign code'
WASHINGTON — Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk said yester
day that he will call on contenders for the party's 1988 presidential nomina
tion to abide by a "campaign code" designed to help the Democrats regain
the White House by curbing intrapartv divisiveness.
The purpose of the code, Kirk said in a speech to the Democratic Na
tional Committee here, "is to ensure that our campaign is not negative, is
not polarizing, is not party bashing but sets forth a clear constructive policy
agenda for the American people to address and to follow."
Kirk expects to develop the code by meeting with presidential prospects
and other party leaders, he later told reporters. The proposed standards
would attempt to cover the activities of state parties and constituency
groups, as well as presidential candidates.
Examples of the type of activity Kirk hopes to restrict are the straw polls
on presidential preference conducted by state parties before the actual
start of the 1984 campaign.
AIDS carriers increase celibacy
WASHINGTON — Psychologists at the University of California-San Fran
cisco have found a "significant increase" in celibacy and a "significantly
higher frequency of relationship disruption" among homosexual men who
have tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus, one of the researchers
said yesterday.
In an unpublished study, psychologists who have been studying 824 gay
and bisexual men in San Francisco since 1983 said that a positive test fre
quently results in sexual isolation, the ending of relationships and a "major
increase in anxiety and depression.
"People we interviewed told us that when they got their positive results
they really didn't want to be around people — they felt contaminated and
just didn't want to be touched," said Dr. Steve Morin, assistant clinical pro
fessor of medicine at UCSF, in a telephone interview.
He added: "That may account for both the high level of celibacy and the
high level of relationship disruption."
Further. Morin said, a positive test also leads to a decrease in behavior
that transmits the virus. "We found that a vers strong social responsiblity
motive emerged." he said

not polarizing, is not party bashing but sets forth a clear constructive policy
agenda for the American people to address and to follow."
Kirk expects to develop the code by meeting with presidential prospects
and other party leaders, he later told reporters. The proposed standards
would attempt to cover the activities of state parties and constituency
groups, as well as presidential candidates.
Examples of the type of activity Kirk hopes to restrict are the straw polls
on presidential preference conducted by state parties before the actual
start of the 1984 campaign.
AIDS carriers increase celibacy
WASHINGTON — Psychologists at the University of California-San Fran
cisco have found a "significant increase" in celibacy and a "significantly
higher frequency of relationship disruption" among homosexual men who
have tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus, one of the researchers
said yesterday.
In an unpublished study, psychologists who have been studying 824 gay
and bisexual men in San Francisco since 1983 said that a positive test fre
quently results in sexual isolation, the ending of relationships and a "major
increase in anxiety and depression.
"People we interviewed told us that when they got their positive results
they really didn't want to be around people — they felt contaminated and
just didn't want to be touched," said Dr. Steve Morin, assistant clinical pro
fessor of medicine at UCSF, in a telephone interview.
He added: "That may account for both the high level of celibacy and the
high level of relationship disruption."
Further. Morin said, a positive test also leads to a decrease in behavior
that transmits the virus. "We found that a vers strong social responsiblity
motive emerged." he said

Boesky aids government probe
WASHINGTON — Stock speculator Ivan Boesky has provided federal in
vestigators with videotape recordings, made with hidden cameras, of his
meetings with Wall Street professionals who provided him with advance
tips on corporate takeovers, according to sources close to the investigation.
The videotaped meetings and audio recordings of Boesky's telephone
conversations, dating back at least seven weeks, are expected to form the
basis for the next series of moves in the government's crackdown on the
insider trading networks centered on Boesky and Dennis Levine, a former
investment banker with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the sources said.
At least one other investment banker is cooperating with investigators
after being implicated by the recordings, sources said. Boesky and Levine
have been supplying investigators with names of their Wall Street contacts
who shared illegal tips about takeovers or other major corporate develop
ments, thus reaping millions of dollars in insider trading profits.
On Nov. 14, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that
Boesky had agreed to forfeit $50 million in illegal insider trading profits,
pay a $50 million penalty and plead guilty to an unspecified criminal
charge. The SEC said Boesky agreed to pay Levine $2.4 million for a series
of leaks about upcoming takeovers and major corporate actions that Levine
had learned about from Drexel's clients or other Wall Street sources.
Boesky's use of such confidential information to buy and sell securities vio
lated federal laws against insider trading, the SEC said.
Mubarak, Hussein warn U.S.
CAIRO, Egypt — The leaders of Egypt and Jordan, two of the most impor
tant U.S. allies in the Middle East, warned the Reagan administration yester
day that its credibility in the Arab world has been harmed by its covert
supply of arms to Iran.
Commenting publicly on the controversy for the first time, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said he found the still-unfolding reports about
the arms shipments to Iran astonishing.
The president spoke to reporters at the close of two days of talks with
Jordan's King Hussein, who had already characterized the Reagan adminis
tration's secret dealings with Iran as incomprehensible and "an insult to all
Arabs."
Mubarak, whose nearly bankrupt government is in the middle of
sensitive negotiations with Washington over the refinancing of $4.5 billion
in back military debt, was more restrained.
"I have asked him, and I am still asking, (that) the United States do some
thing so as not to lose its credibility in the Arab world because of this act. I
hope something can be done in the very near future... because lam afraid
(U.S. credibility) is starting to deteriorate," Mubarak said in a tone that sug
gested an appeal.
However, senior Egyptian officials have repeatedly urged the Reagan ad
ministration to become more involved in the floundering Middle East
peace process.
Shultz' Iran position criticized
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz, who has carefully
sought to distance himself from the White House decision to send arms to
Iran, was sharply criticized yesterday for not supporting President Reagan
publicly in a time of crisis for his administration.
At the same time, evidence continues to mount that Shultz knew more
about arms shipments this year to Iran than he has acknowledged, but
decided not to fight what he knew was the president's strong desire to at
tempt to gain release of American hostages in Lebanon, even by offering
arms.
A top State Department official said that Shultz initially fought the deci
sion, but after the president had made up his mind, Shultz decided not to
use up his credit with Reagan by raising the issue again. At the same time,
he allowed his top aides to remain in the dark.
In an unusually direct blast against Shultz, Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
who will be minority leader in the new Congress, said he was having diffi
culty supporting Reagan's decision because "it's fairly difficult when the
secretary of state is not doing anything."
Gorbachev: SDI may halt talks
NEW DELHI, India — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned the
Reagan administration yesterday that its Strategic Defense Initiative could
bring arms talks to a halt.
In a two-hour broadcast interview with Indian journalists in his Kremlin
office, Gorbachev signaled that the future of arms control will be a major
focus of his talks this week with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who
has taken an active role both within the Nonaligned Movement and with
other world leaders in pressing for nuclear disarmament.
Gorbachev begins a four-day visit to the Indian capital tommorrow in an
effort to reinforce the close ties that have marked Soviet-Indian relations
for three decades.
He is likely to find fertile ground for his arguments on SDI in India,
which has been highly critical of that program for research into a space
based antimissile system.
In addition, there were widespread reports in the press here yesterday
that Moscow, in continuing arms sales here, will begin delivery of the ad
vanced MiG-29 aircraft to India next month. This would be the first delivery
of the plane outside the Soviet Union.
Kirk calls for 'campaign code'
WASHINGTON — Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk said yester
day that he will call on contenders for the party's 1988 presidential nomina
tion to abide by a "campaign code" designed to help the Democrats regain
the White House by curbing intrapartv divisiveness.
The purpose of the code, Kirk said in a speech to the Democratic Na
tional Committee here, "is to ensure that our campaign is not negative, is
not polarizing, is not party bashing but sets forth a clear constructive policy
agenda for the American people to address and to follow."
