# Aquino fires defense minister

### 
MANILA, Philippines — President Corazon Aquino,
declaring the need for a "fresh start" to her crisis
ridden nine-month-old government, yesterday dis
missed outspoken Defense Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile from her Cabinet after learning that officers
loyal to him were set to announce an open rebellion.
Aquino accepted Enrile's resignation at the end of
a tense and dramatic day in which all 25 members of
her fractious Cabinet resigned in order to give her a
free hand in naming a new government. In a
televised speech, Aquino said she would decide
which of the other resignations to accept within the
next few days.
At the same time, Aquino announced that if com
munist insurgents battling her government do not
agree to a cease-fire by the end of the month, she will
"terminate all further negotiations." A tougher ap
proach to the insurgency, as well as the purging of
certain liberal members from the Cabinet, were
among the key demands of dissident officers in the
military who had been pressuring Aquino for weeks
with veiled threats of a coup.
Armed forces chief of staff Gen. Fiflel Ramos, who
had earlier taken the extraordinary step of ordering
the military to ignore any orders from Enrile's mini
stry, yesterday night issued a statement telling
citizens that the situation was calm. Ramos, by firmly
backing Aquino's civilian government, appeared to
have emerged yesterday as perhaps the most pivotal
player on the nation's political stage.
By removing Enrile, her harshest critic, from the
Cabinet while taking a harder line against the com

munist rebels. Aquino appeared to boldly tackle two
of the most pressing problems contributing to the
widespread image both here and abroad that her
government was under siege. That image of instabil
ity has bogged down the government's efforts to at
tract new foreign investment needed to rebuild the
country's shattered economy.
Aquino herself acknowledged the appearance of
drift in her government, saying, "Of late, my cir
cumspection has been viewed as weakness, and my
sincere attempts at reconciliation as indecision. This
cannot continue."
Yesterday's moves, while sudden, were not wholly
unexpected. Aquino's supporters, including U.S. offi
cials in Washington, had been anxiously watching
events unfolding here and expecting her to reshuffle
her Cabinet in the face of mounting criticism.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman
Anita Stockman said, "We are pleased that this re
ported coup attempt failed.... We reiterate our
strong and unequivocal support for President Aquino
and her administration."
But Aquino's latest moves on the Cabinet changes
and the insurgency, while strengthening her hand
here, are not seen as sufficient to diminish the mul
titude of problems still besetting her administration.
A breakdown of the cease-fire talks with the com
munists could mean an escalation of the warfare,
with the Army still largely unprepared. Political vio
lence, including bombings and assassinations, con
tinues unabated. Military dissidents, well-armed and
financed loyalists of deposed president Ferdinand

Marcos and Moslem secessionists still challenge her
government's authority.
Enrile, even outside the government, still looms as
Aquino's best-known and most articulate political ad
versary who still could command the loyalties of dis
parate anti-Aquino forces if he chooses to remain in
the political arena.
Enrile and a handful of loyal officers led a military
revolt in February that toppled the Marcos govern
ment and helped install Aquino as president. But he
had since become one of her most vocal critics, ac
cusing her of "betraying" the February revolution
and reneging on her promise to give him free rein in
conducting the nation's counterinsurgency effort.
Aquino yesterday appointed Deputy Defense Mini
ster Rafael Ileto, a low-keyed and well-liked retired
general, to run the Defense Ministry. Ileto immedi
ately moved to consolidate his own position among
the clique of middle-level officers loyal to Enrile who
were believed to be behind the latest coup activity.
Those Enrile loyalists in the Defense Ministry had
built up their own military unit in the form of Enrile's
personal security force. Ileto met with the leaders of
that group yesterday and said afterward, "I probably
won't be needing that much security for myself. I
hinted that there might be some reorganization." !
Concern over how those Enrile loyalists might
respond to his firing led to an atmosphere of high
tension during most of the day..Troop reinforce-!
ments were moved in and government buildings
kept under tight security.

widespread image both here and abroad that her
government was under siege. That image of instabil
ity has bogged down the government's efforts to at
tract new foreign investment needed to rebuild the
country's shattered economy.
Aquino herself acknowledged the appearance of
drift in her government, saying, "Of late, my cir
cumspection has been viewed as weakness, and my
sincere attempts at reconciliation as indecision. This
cannot continue."
Yesterday's moves, while sudden, were not wholly
unexpected. Aquino's supporters, including U.S. offi
cials in Washington, had been anxiously watching
events unfolding here and expecting her to reshuffle
her Cabinet in the face of mounting criticism.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman
Anita Stockman said, "We are pleased that this re
ported coup attempt failed.... We reiterate our
strong and unequivocal support for President Aquino
and her administration."
But Aquino's latest moves on the Cabinet changes
and the insurgency, while strengthening her hand
here, are not seen as sufficient to diminish the mul
titude of problems still besetting her administration.
A breakdown of the cease-fire talks with the com
munists could mean an escalation of the warfare,
with the Army still largely unprepared. Political vio
lence, including bombings and assassinations, con
tinues unabated. Military dissidents, well-armed and
financed loyalists of deposed president Ferdinand

Marcos and Moslem secessionists still challenge her
government's authority.
Enrile, even outside the government, still looms as
Aquino's best-known and most articulate political ad
versary who still could command the loyalties of dis
parate anti-Aquino forces if he chooses to remain in
the political arena.
Enrile and a handful of loyal officers led a military
revolt in February that toppled the Marcos govern
ment and helped install Aquino as president. But he
had since become one of her most vocal critics, ac
cusing her of "betraying" the February revolution
and reneging on her promise to give him free rein in
conducting the nation's counterinsurgency effort.
Aquino yesterday appointed Deputy Defense Mini
ster Rafael Ileto, a low-keyed and well-liked retired
general, to run the Defense Ministry. Ileto immedi
ately moved to consolidate his own position among
the clique of middle-level officers loyal to Enrile who
were believed to be behind the latest coup activity.
Those Enrile loyalists in the Defense Ministry had
built up their own military unit in the form of Enrile's
personal security force. Ileto met with the leaders of
that group yesterday and said afterward, "I probably
won't be needing that much security for myself. I
hinted that there might be some reorganization." !
Concern over how those Enrile loyalists might
respond to his firing led to an atmosphere of high
tension during most of the day..Troop reinforce-!
ments were moved in and government buildings
kept under tight security.
