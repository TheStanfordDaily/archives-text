# Advisers urged a Reagan apology

WASHINGTON — Some of Presi
dent Reagan's White House advisers
suggested before his news conference
last week that Reagan admit it was a
mistake to secretly break his arms em
bargo against Iran, but he rejected
their advice, administration officials
said yesterday.
The advisers had considered an al
ternative opening statement for Reagan
in which he would have acknowledged
it was a mistake to sell weapons to Iran
while he was publicly calling for an
arms embargo, the officials said.
Instead, Reagan used the opening
statement to reaffirm the position he
had taken in his Nov. 13 televised
speech on Iran, that the operation was
risky but "I deeply believe in the cor
rectness of my decision." Reagan also
said he would take responsibility for
the operation, but later said others
were to blame for damage to his
credibility.
The Iran operation in

tense criticism of the White House
staff, and some of Reagan's California
friends are seeking a shakeup in the
presidential staff and Cabinet.
However, one member of the group
cautioned yesterday that it would be
difficult to persuade Reagan to agree to
this in the midst of the controversy,
and predicted that changes may wait
until early next year.
In urging Reagan to admit the Iran
operation was a mistake, his advisers
argued that the president could
dampen the controversy by ack
nowledging what many Americans and
leading political figures had already
concluded.
Moreover, they suggested, Reagan
could take the offensive and define the
nature of the error on his terms, rather
than let others do it for him. They said,
for example, Reagan could claim the
mistake was in saying one thing and
doing another — and not concede that
tlje shipment of arms was wrong. Or*

as others suggested, Reagan could ac
knowledge that the arms sales were an
error.
One of those who raised the idea of
acknowledging a mistake was White
House communications director
Patrick Buchanan. Officials said that
when Buchanan brought it up, a
lengthy debate ensued on Wednesday
among other aides about whether this
was a correct approach.
Ultimately, the officials said, the
question was taken to the president,
and he decided not to acknowledge
that a mistake had been made. Reagan,
said one of the officials, "never says he
made a mistake."
White House chief of staff Donald
Regan said in an interview Friday that
he consistently favored the policy of
shipping arms to Iran and believes the
"jury is still out" on whether it was a
success.
But officials said they worried
,that Reagan's approach would invite

even greater controversy as informa
tion about the Iran episode filters out
piecemeal, further eroding his.
credibility.
For example, while Reagan des
cribed the arms shipments as
"minuscule," it was disclosed to con
gressional leaders later in the week
that about $12 million in weapons
were sent to Iran. And Newsweek mag
azine reports this week that Reagan's
"operatives sent $50 million to $100
million worth of weapons to Iran,"
using the Central Intelligence Agency
and concealing the shipments from the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said the Iran op
eration was a "mistake" and urged
Reagan to move quickly to put it be
hind him. "The only person who cari
put this to rest is the president — the
quicker the better," Dole said on CBS
News' "Face the Nation."
