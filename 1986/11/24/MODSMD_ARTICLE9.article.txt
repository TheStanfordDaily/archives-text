Arraignment was postponed last week until Janu
ary for two Stanford students and two recent
graduates who were among 52 arrested at the Sunny
vale Lockheed, Inc., plant last month for demonstrat
ing against that company's links with the military.
Protesters said after the postponements Thursday
and Friday that the Palo Alto District Attorney's office
will probably prosecute four or five of the protest
ers.
The seven Stanford students arrested at the protest
will probably not be among those prosecuted by the
Sunnyvale/Cupertino district attorney, said graduate
student Scott Bohning, who spoke with District Attor
ney Dana Burkett. Bohning was one of the Stanford
students arrested.
"It all depends what they're basing it (the investi
gation) on. There's no telling what's on their
Videotapes," he said.
Seniors Galen Hilgard and Diane Honigberg and

recent Stanford graduates Caroline Paul and Jennifer
Grant were notified at Sunnyvale Municipal Court
last week that their arraignment will be postponed
until Jan. 14 and 15.
Last Wednesday, the arraignment of seniors Mario
Huerta and Carl Hill and Bohning was postponed un
til Jan. 22.
Court proceedings for the protesters have been
delayed because police reports have not yet been
filed, Honigberg said.
About 150 people marched in the Oct. 20 protest,
organized by the political coalition No Business As
Usual as part of a national day of protest against the
Strategic Defense Initiative. Related protests were
held in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and Cleveland.
The majority of those arrested were charged with
obstructing traffic. Huerta, however, was charged
with refusal to disperse, and Grant was charged with
resisting an officer.
Grant feels the protest was a success: "It was effec
tive. I would do it again.... People can do some
thing."

"I don't think arrests have anything to do with the
success of the protest," said Honigberg,. a member of
Stanford Action for Disarmament (STAND). The
main thing was it got national (press) coverage."
Bohning said the main goal of most protesters was
not to get arrested, but to protest SDI, adding: "It
made national press and punctured the idea that
everyone's lining up in support of 5D1.... We think
it's a very dangerous program," Bohning said.
The approxiamately 25 Stanford students who par
ticipated in the march sought to raise awareness of
the SDI issue on campus and to call attention to SDI
research at the University itself, said Bohning, who is
also a member of STAND.
Stanford has received at least $23 million in official
SDI funding over the last five years, according to fig
ures Bohning compiled from University records
from the Sponsored Projects Office and from phone
calls to the Pentagon.
No Business as Usual is planning another SDI
protest in April, Bohning said.
