# Doubts arise over Filipino coup
## 
### 
MANILA, Philippines — The
Philippines' new defense minister,
Rafael Ileto, launched an "informal in
vestigation" yesterday into whether
dissident members of the Philippine
armed forces actually were plotting a
coup against President Corazon
Aquino last Saturday night or whether
the rumored plot was a "psychological
warfare" campaign that backfired.
Noting that the military had now suf
ficiently "defused the situation" so the
Philippine people "can relax a little"
after several weeks of crisis, Ileto
added that he had no plans at the mo
ment to punish any officers who may

have been involved in such a plot.
Aquino and her military chief of
staff, Gen. Fidel Ramos, Sunday used
the widely rumored coup to fire
Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, a
frequent critic of the president's
policies, and to ask for courtesy
resignations from the rest of the
Cabinet.
A spokesman for the president said
Aquino was not likely to announce
which resignations she would accept
until later this week, though several
top aides said the changes would be
extensive. Most of her government's at
tention yesterday was focused on ex

plaining in detail to the now-relieved
nation the events that led up to the
most critical day of Aquino's
presidency.
Presidential press secretary Teodoro
Benigno reiterated to reporters yester
day afternoon that a coup was, indeed,
in the offing late Saturday night by 180
opposition politicians and members of
Enrile's internal security group — the
same men who staged the rebellion
last February that led to the toppling of
former President Ferdinand Marcos.
It was the removal of these military
plotters, whom he did not mention by
name, that Benigno said ranked among

the greatest triumphs of the president.
"One of the three daggers at the
heart of this government has been
removed," Benigno said, adding that
the communist insurgency and the na
tion's lingering economic crisis
remained. "This small group in the
military, that had largely acoustical
ability to frighten the entire country, is
now gone."
"The idea of mass courtesy resigna
tions had actually been entertained by
the president for some time," Benigno
said, adding that Aquino nearly called
for them before.
