## Big Game Revisited 
### 
Cal may have the Axe, but Stan
ford has the bowl bid.
With apologies to Mike Tuchin,
who no longer has anything to
chain himself to except other Axe
Committee members, keeping the
Axe just doesn't mean all that much.
I'd take a winning record and a
Gator Bowl bid over a Big Game
victory any year.
Before Cal-haters accuse me of
sacrilege and Stanford psychology
majors fault me for blatant cognitive
dissonance reduction, consider the
following:
• Stanford went into the Big Game
knowing it had already secured a
bid in the prestigious Gator Bowl,
while Cal went into its final game
on the verge of becoming the
losingest football team in the
school's history.
• Stanford's Jack Elway entered the
game with a well-earned reputation
as a fine coach, while Cal's lame
duck leader, Joe Kapp, had been
canned weeks earlier.
• Stanford had won the last two Big
Games.
In short, the reputation of Cal's
frtnrhnll team rested en

tirely on Saturday's game, while the
reputation of Cardinal football
simply was not at stake.
Granted, the loss was quite disap
pointing, but it is in no way a fair
measure of Stanford's season.
Cardinal football has been spec
tacular this year and has provided
many unforgettable moments, such
as the final stand against IJCLA. It is
a gutsy team, marked by un-
Stanfordlike reliance on a strong
running game and a dominating
defense. The Texas Longhorns actu
ally called the Cardinal bullies.
I take great pride in attending a
school with a national powerhouse
football team, and the aberrant Big
Game loss did little to change that
feeling.
This column, then, is reaffirma
tion of my pride and confidence in
the Cardinal.
Say you heard it here first: Stan
ford will win its last two games,
against Arizona and Clemson, and
will reappear in the Associated
Press Top 20 — where it belongs —
for the season's final poll.
