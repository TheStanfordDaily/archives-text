The recent controversy in President Reagan's secret
arms sale to Iran may well be the biggest crisis in his ad
ministration. Although it is as yet unclear just who is to
be blamed, it is very clear that none of the people in
volved have handled the problem well.
The reaction of members of Reagan's Cabinet is remi
niscent of the crises European governments like Italy
and France periodically experience. Just as in those
European crises when entire governments can be
replaced overnight, here Americans are faced with Sec
retary of State George Shultz's threats to retire, the
Cabinet's attempt to use National Security Adviser John
Poindexter as a scapegoat for the entire controversy, and
Nancy Reagan and her friends' pressure on Reagan to
replace three key cabinet members.
The way to conduct politics, and especially those with
international implications, is not to threaten firings and
resignations. Nor is it to attempt to fix the blame on one
person who did nothing any worse than any of the other
people involved.
Reagnn mnde a very big mistake in bi,«* decision to

engage in a secret sale of arms to bargain for hostages —
a bargain he said he would never consider. Not only has
he undermined his stance on terrorism, but his subse
quent attempt to protect himself has created a deep rift
within his Cabinet and has instilled an element of
mistrust between members of his administration.
Rather than dig a deeper hole around himself, Reagan
should simply tell the entire truth about the incident. He
and his Cabinet should admit they made a mistake,
resolve not to engage in this kind of international con
spiracy again and put an end to the speculation and in
trigue that now surrounds the affair.
If his bad politics are an attempt to save face per
sonally, Reagan should be aware that his actions are
being watched by every country in the world. His
mistakes reflect on the United States as a whole. Instead
of continuing the backbiting and scapegoating that has
dragged on since the controversy exploded, Reagan
should consider the country's standing on the interna
tional front and wipe the slate clean.
