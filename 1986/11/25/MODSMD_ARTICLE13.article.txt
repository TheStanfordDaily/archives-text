Workers received
unfair treatment
Last week, two food service workers
at Florence Moore Hall were sub
jected to unfair treatment. This treat
ment should concern the Stanford
community.
A worker needed a document from
the food service manager at Flo Mo.
He asked a co-worker to be present as
a Spanish interpreter, if needed, when
he requested the document because
this document was so important to
him.
The manager refused to allow the
co-worker to be present as an inter
preter. She said workers were now
allowed to speak only English at Flo
Mo and that workers were no longer
allowed to speak any Spanish in the
kitchen.
The co-worker asked her to be
reasonable. He said he was just serv
ing his friend as an interpreter, and
since he wasn't being paid for it and
was only doing a service, what was the
problem?
The manager repeated that there
would be no interpreter, repeated that
only English could be spoken at Flo
Mo and had them leave her office.
We should understand several
things about this incident. First,
workers at Flo Mo always communi
cate with the manager about their
work assignments in English, so that is
not an issue here. What is at issue is
the manager's blanket condemnation
of a second language. To tell someone
that they cannot have an interpreter in
a special situation, or when talking to
each other if it doesn't involve a third
party, is harrassment, discrimination
and an insult to a major part of the
community.
It is not suprising that this directive
came from the food service manager
at Flo Mo. Since she has taken over,
there has been a steady stream of
labor problems — in fact, since she

took over, there have been more
verbal and written grievances by more
workers at Flo Mo than all the other
dining halls combined.
The attitude of higher management
has been to uphold this manager no
matter what the cost to workers sub
jected to her treatment.
Hopefully, the community as a
whole, but especially MEChA, El
Centro Chicano and other groups, will
inform themselves about this situation
and help us correct this injustice.

Report's findings
not unprecedented
In a recent editorial criticizing the
White House Task Force Report on
the Family, you call the report's con
clusion that "the easy availability of
welfare in all its forms has become a
powerful force for the destruction of
the family through the perpetuation of
the welfare culture" a "ridiculous leap
of reason" (Daily, Nov. 18). In fairness
it should be said that the Reagan
administration does not deserve all
the credit — or blame — for discover
ing the strong correlation between
expansion of welfare programs and
social decay.
In his 1935 State of the Union
message, President Franklin Roosevelt
wrote: "The lessons of history ...
show conclusively ... that continued
dependence upon relief induces a
spiritual and moral disintegration
fundamentally destructive to the
national fiber. To dole our relief is to
administer a narcotic, a subtle
destroyer of the human spirit The
Federal Government must and shall
quit this business of relief." Forty-two
years later President Jimmy Carter said
in his congressional message on Aug.
6,1977: "The welfare system is anti
work, anti-family, inequitable in its -

treatment of the poor and wasteful of
the taxpayers' dollars It provides
incentives for family breakup "
President Carter's criticism was di
rected not at President Roosevelt's
1935 program but at what subsequent
welfare administrators had done to
the program and its intended
beneficiaries.
Testifying before the House Appro
priations Committee in February 1947,
federal Social Security administrator
Arthur Altmeyer said: "So, if we had
the coverage of the old-age and sur
vivors insurance system which include
the whole working population ... we
should find that our old-age assistance
rolls and our aid-to-dependent
children rolls would decline rapidly."
Social Security coverage soon after
became universal throughout the
country and multiplied its benefits.
But the number of aid-to-dependent
children (ADC) recipients soared
from 1.1 million in 1946 to 11 million
in 1972. President Lyndon Johnson, on
signing the Economic Opportunity Act
of 1964, wrote: "We are not content to
accept endless growth of relief or
welfare r0115.... The days of the dole
in our country are numbered.'' At that
point ADC recipients numbered four
million. Eight years later they totalled
11 million.
I agree that the recommendations
of the welfare task force report do not
contribute much that has not been
said before to the solution of the
poverty problem. Nor can solutions
be outlined in this letter. I did so in
my book "The Wayward Welfare
State" (Hoover Institution Press,
1981), an expanded updating of my
earlier book "The Growth of Ameri
can Government," which received the
Most Distinguished Research Award of
the Governmental Research Associa
tion in 1975. Its core: The welfare
state argument is not over the ques
tion of whether unfortunate and
needy people ought to be kept from
starving. This has long been settled in
the affirmative. The question is how

far the state can go in redistributing
huge amounts of income from pro
ductive to nonproductive segments of
the population without inflicting
serious damage to the economy and
to society.

Walkway needs
lighting installed
Lights are badly needed on the new
sidewalk running diagonally in front
of the Business School, from
Memorial Way to Serra Street. This
stretch of sidewalk, as an already
popular shortcut, is heavily used by
both pedestrians and cyclists at all
hours of the day and night and is
likely to become even more so. Yet it
has no lighting of any kind. The over
arching trees, moreover, reduce
visibility to practically nothing at
night. And this problem is only ag
gravated by darkness falling earlier,
now that it's winter. As a University
employee working a night shift, I
travel this sidewalk twice a day in the
dark, en route to and from work. I
have several times just barely avoided
collisions with bicyles or pedestrians
here in the darkness. I hope it will not
take the occurrence of a preventable
accident or an assault along this route
in order to get lampposts installed
where they are so badly needed.
