# It's that time of the quarter again
## 
### 
Madeleine's roommate and Gem and Julia and I
went to the city to buy records and go dancing. Julia
was feeling a little blue, which is a horrible pun, be
cause the party we were going to was entitled "Blu
Hysteria." The invitation was a blue postcard, and in
blue ink it read "Mono-chromatic attire." No one, not
even us, took that seriously. But, the horrible pun
notwithstanding, Julia was feeling a bit down.

I shouldn't be doing this," she said. "I have a
report due Wednesday, and I haven't even read the
book yet, let alone found any secondary sources. I
haven't been to my Italian class in a week, and Elena
is going to kill me. Which is right, because I deserve
to die." We laughed. Julia talks like this. Even when
she is serious, she is not serious.
Gem said he still had a few secondary applications
for medical school to finish. Julia was looking out the
window distractedly.
"Do you think I look all right?" she said.
Of course we do, Julia.
"Not tcx) high school?"
It's only a party, Julia.
"I just want to make sure I look all right," she said.
"I need to get my hair cut before I go home, but I
don't know when I'll get to it. My record player is
broken. I forgot to call my brother back last week,
and I think it was something important."
Madeleine's roommate said, "You should talk to
the Invisible Girl She's really scattered too. I don't
think she's even got a new bike yet."
"It's that time of the quarter," I said.

"You'll get some work done over Thanksgiving,"
said Gem.
"I might be going away," said Julia.
"Do you think that's really smart?" said Gem. We
had parked the car and were browsing through the
records at Reckless Records.
Julia was staring at the man ringing up her pur
chases, which came to 198. Suddenly she said, "Have
you had a hard day?"
The man looked startled. "Not really," he said.
"Then why are you looking at me like that?" she
said. "You're scaring me."
The man laughed. "Scaring customers, that's the
best news I've heard all day "Julia smiled back.
We had to stop at the bank so Julia could get some
more cash. She looked very small as she ran across
Market Street and back to the car. She said: "They're
just like that, the English. You can't take it personally.
They're just sullen like that."
"It must be you," said Madeleine's roommate. "He
was nice to me."
"Thanks," said Julia. Then she said, "I haven't
balanced my checkbook in months."
"Is it really a $10 cover tonight?" said Gem.
"I just can't stop spending money to count it," said
Julia. "I can't stop, it's like I have blinders on"
"It's that time of the quarter," I said.
The club wasn't as packed as we feared it might be.
Gem and I walked up to the second floor to sit down.
Julia stayed chatting to the doorman and then ran up
to join us.
"Did you see the blue typewriter on the stairs?"
she said.
"I didn't notice," I said. ' Remind me to type some
thing before we go."
Gem and Madeleine's roommate ran down to be
closer to the fashion show. Julia nibbled on the straw
in her drink.
"I feel like I'm in a tunnel," she said. "A four-week
long tunnel, and until I'm at the end, I can't look left
or right or I'll fall down. I have so much work to do,
and I just don't know if I can do it. No-Doz hardly
even works on me anymore."
"Listen, Julie, it's not worth ruining your health
over, believe me."

"I just wish I had an hour where I could really,
really relax, but I feel guilty for every moment I'm
not studying. I do this every quarter, and I always pull
through somehow, but it scares me so much.''
"You just need a little perspective," I said. "Don't
worry so much. It's just not worth it. Slow down and
get your strength back."
Julia smiled and said, "Look, there's Bee and
Aurora. I'm going to go say hello. See you later."
I leaned my head on my hands and began to pay at
tention to the fashion show again. The music they
were playing was by the Cocteau Twins; it sounded
vaguely Japanese, and it was very soothing
Gem woke me up about an hour later. "Let's go,"
he said. I went to get my coat from coatcheck and
then realized I'd forgotten to check out the type
writer. I still wanted to do that, so I told Gem to wait
and went back to the stairs. I met Julia on her way
down. She smiled at my dazed expression. (Don't
you hate the look people get on their faces when
they've fallen asleep somewhere unusual?) There
was no more paper in the typewriter. The piece that
had been in it was lying on the table. I tried putting it
back in, but it seemed the ribbon on the typewriter
was broken and I was too tired to try to fix it. Wed
nesday's all-nighter had really sapped my strength.
People had typed, "Love is blue My blue Heaven
... denim blue, faded up to the sky... he110... I hate
funk I.G. loves Armand...(l knew who'd writ
ten that one, of course. I was sorry to have missed
her.) "People in Glass Houses, eh, Doc ... Tri-sig
forever ... My candle burns at both ends, it will not
last the night, but oh my friends and oh my foes, it
gives a lovely light.... November 1986, before
Thanksgiving."
I looked down to find Julia and saw her chatting
with the doorman again. I folded up the paper and
put it in my pocket. The doorman was saying to her,
"That was you on the stairs just now. wasn't it?" His
voice held something like awe in it.
Like he'd seen a shooting star.
Rest and be thankful. It's Thanksgiving.

Madeleine's roommate and Gem and Julia and I
went to the city to buy records and go dancing. Julia
was feeling a little blue, which is a horrible pun, be
cause the party we were going to was entitled "Blu
Hysteria." The invitation was a blue postcard, and in
blue ink it read "Mono-chromatic attire." No one, not
even us, took that seriously. But, the horrible pun
notwithstanding, Julia was feeling a bit down.

I shouldn't be doing this," she said. "I have a
report due Wednesday, and I haven't even read the
book yet, let alone found any secondary sources. I
haven't been to my Italian class in a week, and Elena
is going to kill me. Which is right, because I deserve
to die." We laughed. Julia talks like this. Even when
she is serious, she is not serious.
Gem said he still had a few secondary applications
for medical school to finish. Julia was looking out the
window distractedly.
"Do you think I look all right?" she said.
Of course we do, Julia.
"Not tcx) high school?"
It's only a party, Julia.
"I just want to make sure I look all right," she said.
"I need to get my hair cut before I go home, but I
don't know when I'll get to it. My record player is
broken. I forgot to call my brother back last week,
and I think it was something important."
Madeleine's roommate said, "You should talk to
the Invisible Girl She's really scattered too. I don't
think she's even got a new bike yet."
"It's that time of the quarter," I said.

"You'll get some work done over Thanksgiving,"
said Gem.
"I might be going away," said Julia.
"Do you think that's really smart?" said Gem. We
had parked the car and were browsing through the
records at Reckless Records.
Julia was staring at the man ringing up her pur
chases, which came to 198. Suddenly she said, "Have
you had a hard day?"
The man looked startled. "Not really," he said.
"Then why are you looking at me like that?" she
said. "You're scaring me."
The man laughed. "Scaring customers, that's the
best news I've heard all day "Julia smiled back.
We had to stop at the bank so Julia could get some
more cash. She looked very small as she ran across
Market Street and back to the car. She said: "They're
just like that, the English. You can't take it personally.
They're just sullen like that."
"It must be you," said Madeleine's roommate. "He
was nice to me."
"Thanks," said Julia. Then she said, "I haven't
balanced my checkbook in months."
"Is it really a $10 cover tonight?" said Gem.
"I just can't stop spending money to count it," said
Julia. "I can't stop, it's like I have blinders on"
"It's that time of the quarter," I said.
The club wasn't as packed as we feared it might be.
Gem and I walked up to the second floor to sit down.
Julia stayed chatting to the doorman and then ran up
to join us.
"Did you see the blue typewriter on the stairs?"
she said.
"I didn't notice," I said. ' Remind me to type some
thing before we go."
Gem and Madeleine's roommate ran down to be
closer to the fashion show. Julia nibbled on the straw
in her drink.
"I feel like I'm in a tunnel," she said. "A four-week
long tunnel, and until I'm at the end, I can't look left
or right or I'll fall down. I have so much work to do,
and I just don't know if I can do it. No-Doz hardly
even works on me anymore."
"Listen, Julie, it's not worth ruining your health
over, believe me."

"I just wish I had an hour where I could really,
really relax, but I feel guilty for every moment I'm
not studying. I do this every quarter, and I always pull
through somehow, but it scares me so much.''
"You just need a little perspective," I said. "Don't
worry so much. It's just not worth it. Slow down and
get your strength back."
Julia smiled and said, "Look, there's Bee and
Aurora. I'm going to go say hello. See you later."
I leaned my head on my hands and began to pay at
tention to the fashion show again. The music they
were playing was by the Cocteau Twins; it sounded
vaguely Japanese, and it was very soothing
Gem woke me up about an hour later. "Let's go,"
he said. I went to get my coat from coatcheck and
then realized I'd forgotten to check out the type
writer. I still wanted to do that, so I told Gem to wait
and went back to the stairs. I met Julia on her way
down. She smiled at my dazed expression. (Don't
you hate the look people get on their faces when
they've fallen asleep somewhere unusual?) There
was no more paper in the typewriter. The piece that
had been in it was lying on the table. I tried putting it
back in, but it seemed the ribbon on the typewriter
was broken and I was too tired to try to fix it. Wed
nesday's all-nighter had really sapped my strength.
People had typed, "Love is blue My blue Heaven
... denim blue, faded up to the sky... he110... I hate
funk I.G. loves Armand...(l knew who'd writ
ten that one, of course. I was sorry to have missed
her.) "People in Glass Houses, eh, Doc ... Tri-sig
forever ... My candle burns at both ends, it will not
last the night, but oh my friends and oh my foes, it
gives a lovely light.... November 1986, before
Thanksgiving."
I looked down to find Julia and saw her chatting
with the doorman again. I folded up the paper and
put it in my pocket. The doorman was saying to her,
"That was you on the stairs just now. wasn't it?" His
voice held something like awe in it.
Like he'd seen a shooting star.
Rest and be thankful. It's Thanksgiving.
