# Concert Network is working hard
## 
### 
A recent article overemphasized certain issues confronting the Concert Net
work (Daily, Nov. 6). I would like to clarify the challenges the Concert Network
faces.
The headline was inaccurate, stating that no big rock bands will play at Stan
ford. True, none have been signed on yet to play this year. However, our major
season is spring quarter in Frost Amphitheatre, and contract signing does not
even start until winter quarter. "Tentative at best," in regard to a Grateful Dead
concert, connotes that a concert is nearly out of the question. Quite to the con
trary, we are tentative because we are waiting to see about the health of the band
members and to work out a reasonable date with their tour schedule.
A major rock band to the Concert Network is a band charging $20,000 or more.
What determines who comes to Stanford is a measure of who bids the most
money. With large acts, very few people can compete with Bill Graham Presents.
We have seen the danger of bidding for major acts; our predecessor, Special
Events, lost $90,000 in 1979 and consequently went out of business. The Concert
Network cannot, by its charter, risk more money than it has in reserve. Based on
our present reserves, we feel it foolish to try to bid for an uncertain "major" act
and potentially risk the future of contemporary concerts at Stanford.

TIM SELF

When comparing the Stanford Concert Network to Berkeley's SUPERB, one
must realize that SUPERB only brings one major show to the Greek Theatre a
year, the summer jazz festival. (The show lost $85,000 last year. ) All other major
shows are brought to the Greek by Cal Performances, a professional group that
contracts with Bill Graham Presents to put shows into the Greek. One must
realize that SUPERB's $60,000 budget comes from student fees. After getting an in
itial fee assessment to start up in 1984, the Concert Network must cover operating
expenses and generate reserves through ticket sales alone.
Additionally, the example of bringing the band "X" to Berkeley is misleading.
Berkeley did not take the Friday show away from Bill Graham Presents, the com
pany. They outbid Wolfgang's, a 400-seat club — Bill Graham's private club, not
Bill Graham Presents. X, in the Concert Network's eyes, is not a "major rock
band," as the article suggests. The Concert Network does have the ability to go
after these size shows but uses careful scrutiny because it cannot afford a loss of
any sort.
The article also misrepresented the use of the technical rider. The technical
rider specifies what technical services the producer or promoter will provide for
the band — sound, lights, hospitality. The rider is important in determining spe
cific costs of the show. After evaluating the demands and costs of a show, includ
ing technical demands in the rider and many other considerations, the Concert
Network then decides to bid on a band. Money determines whether a band
agrees to a contract. The band's agent is not concerned how we fulfill the rider,
just that the band gets its guarantee. The technical rider serves as one factor of
many in determining costs before we even continue to pursue a certain band.
The major issues in getting bands are to have the halls to put them in and the fin
ancial backing to make competitive offers.
The Concert Network has only existed since 1984. Our future depends on the
success of our small shows now. We are trying to establish a reputation and finan
cial base, so we can go after larger shows. Our goal is to provide professional
contemporary entertainment to the Stanford community. This does not exclude
"smaller shows." We hope to bring acts to Stanford that do not usually make their
way onto the Farm. This year will be our busiest yet, with fall and winter quarters
highlighted by a five-show comedy series interspersed with smaller jazz and rock
shows. Our spring season should remain solid with several larger shows in Frost.
Our next event is the second show of the Stanford Stand-Up Comedy Series on
Friday, Dec. 5 in Memorial Auditorium. A great way to relieve pre-Dead Week
stress. Don't count us out yet!
