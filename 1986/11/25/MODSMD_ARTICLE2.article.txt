# Reports of rape here are untrue
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Contrary to rumors circulating
among students, no sexual assaults
have been reported to the Stanford
Police Department this school year, ac
cording to Police Chief Marvin Her
rington.
"The rumors that are going around,"
Herrington said, "are that there have
been three to four rape cases."
Herrington said the police have
received two reports, probably related,
of attempted sexual assault. The police
have also learned of three shower
peeping incidents since September.
Herrington said police do not believe
any of these incidents are related.
Those cases are also the only of
which Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons has heard. If an incident of
shower intrusion or sexual assault
were reported to a resident assistant,
the police or a resident fellow, Lyons
said he "would learn of it pretty
quickly." He said the system "is not
perfect, but pretty close."
The two attempted sexual assaults
occurred Nov. 1 near the Dish. Both
incidents took place near noon, within
a few hundred yards of the Dish, Her
rington said.
The two women, one of them a Stan
ford student, described their assailant
as a white male in his late 20s or early
30s, about 5-feet-9 to 6-feet tall, of
medium to thin build. He had light
bolored, dirty blond hair, a poor com
plexion and possibly a mustache.
He was seen riding or walking a
beat-up green bicycle with upright
handle bars.

Although the police have not identi
fied the man or any suspects, "We have
not had any other instances of anything
like this or of anybody with that des
cription since then," Herrington said.
The shower-peeping incidents took
place in October and early November,
Herrington said. Although two took
place in Governor's Corner — at Schiff
and Potter houses — Herrington said
"they're random."
"Every year we get some. It's hard to
tell whether they're done on purpose
or as a joke or by somebody drinking,"
he said. "Occasionally we'll get some
thing that focuses on one dorm or one
area ... but it's a random kind of thing,
generally.
"I would urge women to at least
report (shower-peeping incidents) ...
and if there is a pattern, then it gives us
something to go on," he said.
Some of the rumors circulating
campus may be attributable to The
Daily. A Nov. 12 editorial erred in re
ferring to "sexual assaults such as the
three that occurred on campus last
week."
Herrington offered several tips to
help both men and women avoid at
tacks:
• Be aware. "We don't have a lot of
problems here, but that tends to lull
people into a false sense of security,"
Herrington said. Also, he said, "People
tend to be much more cautious at
night, and what they need to remem
ber is that these things happen in the
daytime too." v ~ -
• Run together. Run with someone
from your dormitory, Herrington said,
or if you're running the Dish, wait for
other people to come along before
you start running,
• lock your doot The door to your
room is the only senility you have In a
dormitory, llerrlngton said Make sure
your door Is locked when you arc
either out ol the room or inside and
alone,
