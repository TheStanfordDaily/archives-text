# Faculty housing funding crunch eased by programs
## 
### CHRIS OWEN 
From its inception, Stanford has tried to en
courage its faculty to live on campus. A decree
in the University Trusts states that: "It is
desirable so far as may be that the faculty and
students should reside on University
grounds I direct that professors or Univer
sity officers desiring to build on the ground be
permitted to do so on suitable terms of lease."
For much of Stanford's history, housing did
not pose a serious obstacle to faculty recruit
ment.
"Up until 1973, when Frenchman's Hill was
completed, a newly arrived faculty member
could purchase, relatively inexpensively, a
long-term ground lease on Stanford land and
build a lovely single family home, the construc
tion of which would be financed by Stanford,
which provided long-term, low-interest
mortgages," said Robin Hamill, director of Uni
versity real estate, in a 1983 Daily article.
In the late 19705, however, Palo Alto became
one of the most expensive real estate markets
in the country because of the rapid growth of
Silicon Valley and the inability of new housing
to keep pace with this growth. Stanford faculty
recruitment suffered as a result. A 1979 Daily
article quoted then- President Richard Lyman as
saying, "The housing shortage, more than any
thing else, impeded recruitment of faculty and
staff here."
A 1983 Stanford housing publication des
cribed the dilemma in even starker terms:
"We are faced with a choice; we will find a
way to solve the housing problem, or we will
find that the momentum that brought us to our
present state has turned around and that a slow

but inexorable erosion of academic quality has
begun."
Today, fortunately, the housing situation
does not impede faculty recruitment, according
to Richard Whitmore, deputy director of Real
Estate Programs and Land Management. No
prospective faculty members refused jobs for
the 1985-86 academic year exclusively because
of housing difficulties, he said.
Whitmore believes that the housing shortage
of the late 1970s and early 1980s stemmed from
"an affordability problem" rather than from a
complete lack of housing in the Palo Alto area.
The story of Stanford's success in solving its
faculty housing problems, then, is the story of
its success in developing sufficient financial
support for faculty in search of housing. One
important faculty support program is the
Second Mortgage Coinvestment Loan, or COIN.
Under COIN, a faculty member can secure a
mortgage at less than market interest rates and
defer paying off the principal until he or she
sells or refinances the house. The member,
however, must pay the difference between the
lower interest rate and the market rate out of
the appreciation of the house's value at the time
of sale.
Initiated in 1980, the COIN program elicited
a large response and, by 1983, had to be
stopped because it required too much endow
ment money. "People were surprised by the
demand for mortgages," Whitmore said.
However, this year the program began anew
with $46 million, made up of an endowment
commitment of $16 million and private bor
rowings of $30 million. Whitmore believes that
any additional capital needed for the program
will come out of future private borrowings, not
out of the University's endowment.

Other faculty assistance programs include
the 10/30 Program, the Housing Allowance Pay
ment Program and the Down Payment Assis
tance Program.
The first of these programs, the 10/30 Pro
gram, allowed faculty to defer the market rate
interest payments on their mortgages for the
first 10 years of the mortgage. This program,
begun in 1983, ended this year.
The second of these programs, the Housing
Allowance Payment Program, started in 1981. It
provides a faculty member with additional
income each month to be applied to housing
payments.
Last year, however, the University did a more
extensive study of similar university housing
markets around the country and used this study
as a means of ensuring that HAP payments
made Stanford housing roughly competitive in
affordability with housing in those other areas.
The last of the faculty assitance programs, the
Down Payment Assistance Program, begun in
1983, offers faculty the opportunity to borrow
the substantial sums of money often required
for down payments. According to Whitmore,
the program serves those people "who haven't
built up enough equity" but have adequate
income to buy a certain house.
Participation in one Stanford program for
financing faculty housing does not preclude
participation in another. The University makes
only one requirement of faculty who apply for
financial assistance: that their house or con
dominium be within a 15-mile radius of
Hoover Tower. This requirement, said
Whitmore, is designed "to encourage (the
formation of) a residential community" near
the University.
While Stanford concentrates on making affor

dable housing available to its faculty, it also
tries to ensure the construction of new
housing. With a turnover of 30 to 40 houses
each year, the faculty ghetto (made up of the
San Juan Hill, Frenchman's Hill and Pine Hill
One and Two areas) continues to meet some of
the Stanford faculty's unsatisfied needs."
However, in recognition of unmet demand
for faculty and staff housing, Stanford is pres
ently developing several new housing projects,
according to Jeffrey Wachtel, associate director
of Real Estate Programs.
One of these new housing projects is 1100
Welch Road. To be completed in July 1987, this
project contains six buildings of 18 units and
one building of 42 units. The larger building
will be a "Hometel," a temporary home for the
families of patients at Stanford's hospital, and
will be operated by the Assistance League of
Santa Clara County.
Out of the remaining 108 units, 72 will be al
located to the Medical Center; they will
primarily house first-year interns and residents
at the Center. Of the remaining units, 18 will be
allocated to SLAC, the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Program, and the other 18 will go to
the Provost's Office for allocation. All of the
rooms in this development will be rental.
Stanford West is another future housing proj
ect. Located in the city of Palo Alto, it would
contain no more than 700 housing units, most
of which would go to members of the Univer
sity's staff. However, the project has not yet ad
vanced far.
At its September meeting, the Stanford Board
of Trustees gave the project "concept ap
proval"; this action authorized architectural
planning and environmental review of the proj
ect. Previously, the city of Palo Alto had ex

pressed concern over the impact of this devel
opment on Sand Hill Road, and at one time, the
University had even halted the project.
The final two University developments are
Ryan Lab and Rural Lane; both are in the early
planning stages.
Ryan Lab, located on Stanford Avenue, will
consist of "approximately 30 single-family
houses" on small lots and will be built in two
years if all goes as planned, according to Wach
tel. This development will house faculty and
staff.
Rural Lane, situated near the Stanford golf
course, will house faculty in 14 "luxurious
townhouse units." No date has been set for
completion of the project.
Stanford seems to have overcome the faculty
housing dilemma of the late 1970s by develop
ing a successful group of financial aid programs
for its faculty members in search of housing.
Columbia, Princeton and Yale have all inquired
about Stanford's housing programs, said
Whitmore, and MIT has developed a program
similar to the COIN program.
The University's financial support programs
are adequate, said two residents of recent Uni
versity on-campus developments, one living in
the Pearce Mitchell condominiums and the
other in the Peter Coutts condominiums.
However, at least one faculty member, Art
Prof. Keith Boyle, feels that the price of on
campus housing does account for some faculty
members' decision to live off campus.
Whatever the financial support offered by the
University, some professors do not want to
devote a very large portion of their income
each year to housing; they prefer to commute
from a more distant but less expensive home,
he said.
From its inception, Stanford has tried to en

in the University Trusts states that: "It is

are adequate, said two residents of recent Uni
versity on-campus developments, one living in
the Pearce Mitchell condominiums and the
other in the Peter Coutts condominiums.
However, at least one faculty member, Art
Prof. Keith Boyle, feels that the price of on
campus housing does account for some faculty
members' decision to live off campus.
Whatever the financial support offered by the
University, some professors do not want to
devote a very large portion of their income
each year to housing; they prefer to commute
from a more distant but less expensive home,
he said.
From its inception, Stanford has tried to en
courage its faculty to live on campus. A decree
in the University Trusts states that: "It is
desirable so far as may be that the faculty and
students should reside on University
grounds I direct that professors or Univer
sity officers desiring to build on the ground be
permitted to do so on suitable terms of lease."
For much of Stanford's history, housing did
not pose a serious obstacle to faculty recruit
ment.
"Up until 1973, when Frenchman's Hill was
completed, a newly arrived faculty member
could purchase, relatively inexpensively, a
long-term ground lease on Stanford land and
build a lovely single family home, the construc
tion of which would be financed by Stanford,
which provided long-term, low-interest
mortgages," said Robin Hamill, director of Uni
versity real estate, in a 1983 Daily article.
In the late 19705, however, Palo Alto became
one of the most expensive real estate markets
in the country because of the rapid growth of
Silicon Valley and the inability of new housing
to keep pace with this growth. Stanford faculty
recruitment suffered as a result. A 1979 Daily
article quoted then- President Richard Lyman as
saying, "The housing shortage, more than any
thing else, impeded recruitment of faculty and
staff here."
A 1983 Stanford housing publication des
cribed the dilemma in even starker terms:
"We are faced with a choice; we will find a
way to solve the housing problem, or we will
find that the momentum that brought us to our
present state has turned around and that a slow

but inexorable erosion of academic quality has
begun."
Today, fortunately, the housing situation
does not impede faculty recruitment, according
to Richard Whitmore, deputy director of Real
Estate Programs and Land Management. No
prospective faculty members refused jobs for
the 1985-86 academic year exclusively because
of housing difficulties, he said.
Whitmore believes that the housing shortage
of the late 1970s and early 1980s stemmed from
"an affordability problem" rather than from a
complete lack of housing in the Palo Alto area.
The story of Stanford's success in solving its
faculty housing problems, then, is the story of
its success in developing sufficient financial
support for faculty in search of housing. One
important faculty support program is the
Second Mortgage Coinvestment Loan, or COIN.
Under COIN, a faculty member can secure a
mortgage at less than market interest rates and
defer paying off the principal until he or she
sells or refinances the house. The member,
however, must pay the difference between the
lower interest rate and the market rate out of
the appreciation of the house's value at the time
of sale.
Initiated in 1980, the COIN program elicited
a large response and, by 1983, had to be
stopped because it required too much endow
ment money. "People were surprised by the
demand for mortgages," Whitmore said.
However, this year the program began anew
with $46 million, made up of an endowment
commitment of $16 million and private bor
rowings of $30 million. Whitmore believes that
any additional capital needed for the program
will come out of future private borrowings, not
out of the University's endowment.

Other faculty assistance programs include
the 10/30 Program, the Housing Allowance Pay
ment Program and the Down Payment Assis
tance Program.
The first of these programs, the 10/30 Pro
gram, allowed faculty to defer the market rate
interest payments on their mortgages for the
first 10 years of the mortgage. This program,
begun in 1983, ended this year.
The second of these programs, the Housing
Allowance Payment Program, started in 1981. It
provides a faculty member with additional
income each month to be applied to housing
payments.
Last year, however, the University did a more
extensive study of similar university housing
markets around the country and used this study
as a means of ensuring that HAP payments
made Stanford housing roughly competitive in
affordability with housing in those other areas.
The last of the faculty assitance programs, the
Down Payment Assistance Program, begun in
1983, offers faculty the opportunity to borrow
the substantial sums of money often required
for down payments. According to Whitmore,
the program serves those people "who haven't
built up enough equity" but have adequate
income to buy a certain house.
Participation in one Stanford program for
financing faculty housing does not preclude
participation in another. The University makes
only one requirement of faculty who apply for
financial assistance: that their house or con
dominium be within a 15-mile radius of
Hoover Tower. This requirement, said
Whitmore, is designed "to encourage (the
formation of) a residential community" near
the University.
While Stanford concentrates on making affor

dable housing available to its faculty, it also
tries to ensure the construction of new
housing. With a turnover of 30 to 40 houses
each year, the faculty ghetto (made up of the
San Juan Hill, Frenchman's Hill and Pine Hill
One and Two areas) continues to meet some of
the Stanford faculty's unsatisfied needs."
However, in recognition of unmet demand
for faculty and staff housing, Stanford is pres
ently developing several new housing projects,
according to Jeffrey Wachtel, associate director
of Real Estate Programs.
One of these new housing projects is 1100
Welch Road. To be completed in July 1987, this
project contains six buildings of 18 units and
one building of 42 units. The larger building
will be a "Hometel," a temporary home for the
families of patients at Stanford's hospital, and
will be operated by the Assistance League of
Santa Clara County.
Out of the remaining 108 units, 72 will be al
located to the Medical Center; they will
primarily house first-year interns and residents
at the Center. Of the remaining units, 18 will be
allocated to SLAC, the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Program, and the other 18 will go to
the Provost's Office for allocation. All of the
rooms in this development will be rental.
Stanford West is another future housing proj
ect. Located in the city of Palo Alto, it would
contain no more than 700 housing units, most
of which would go to members of the Univer
sity's staff. However, the project has not yet ad
vanced far.
At its September meeting, the Stanford Board
of Trustees gave the project "concept ap
proval"; this action authorized architectural
planning and environmental review of the proj
ect. Previously, the city of Palo Alto had ex

pressed concern over the impact of this devel
opment on Sand Hill Road, and at one time, the
University had even halted the project.
The final two University developments are
Ryan Lab and Rural Lane; both are in the early
planning stages.
Ryan Lab, located on Stanford Avenue, will
consist of "approximately 30 single-family
houses" on small lots and will be built in two
years if all goes as planned, according to Wach
tel. This development will house faculty and
staff.
Rural Lane, situated near the Stanford golf
course, will house faculty in 14 "luxurious
townhouse units." No date has been set for
completion of the project.
Stanford seems to have overcome the faculty
housing dilemma of the late 1970s by develop
ing a successful group of financial aid programs
for its faculty members in search of housing.
Columbia, Princeton and Yale have all inquired
about Stanford's housing programs, said
Whitmore, and MIT has developed a program
similar to the COIN program.
The University's financial support programs
are adequate, said two residents of recent Uni
versity on-campus developments, one living in

Rural Lane, situated near the Stanford golf
course, will house faculty in 14 "luxurious
townhouse units." No date has been set for
completion of the project.
Stanford seems to have overcome the faculty
housing dilemma of the late 1970s by develop
ing a successful group of financial aid programs
for its faculty members in search of housing.
Columbia, Princeton and Yale have all inquired
about Stanford's housing programs, said
Whitmore, and MIT has developed a program
similar to the COIN program.
The University's financial support programs
are adequate, said two residents of recent Uni
versity on-campus developments, one living in
the Pearce Mitchell condominiums and the
other in the Peter Coutts condominiums.
However, at least one faculty member, Art
Prof. Keith Boyle, feels that the price of on
campus housing does account for some faculty
members' decision to live off campus.
Whatever the financial support offered by the
University, some professors do not want to
devote a very large portion of their income
each year to housing; they prefer to commute
from a more distant but less expensive home,
he said.
