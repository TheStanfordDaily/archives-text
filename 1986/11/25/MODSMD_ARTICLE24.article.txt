## Muster wins Pac-10 Player of the Year 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
There isn't a whole lot of happiness
at Stanford following Saturday's 17-11
upset loss to California in the 89th Big
Game, but the Cardinal got a bright
side on which to look yesterday when
junior running back Brad Muster was
named the Offensive Player of the Year
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Muster headed a list of nine Stanford
players on the two all-conference
teams, four of whom made the first
team. Linebacker David Wyman, defen
sive tackle Tony Leiker and kick
returner Thomas Henley joined Muster
on the first team, while quarterback
John Paye, wide receiver Jeff James,
center Andy Sinclair, cornerback Toi
Cook and safety Walt Harris were
named to the second team.
"I was pretty surprised," Muster said.
"There are a lot of guys with talent. It's
a big honor for me." Muster is second
in the conference in rushing with 945
yards through 10 games, behind
Arizona's David Adams with 1,170, but
Muster has 57 receptions this year to
16 for Adams.
"Numbers aren't everything,"
Muster said. "I think there are a lot
more things than that. I think of it as a
complete award. It's still a great honor
for me."
Muster needs to average only 28
yards in his final two games against
Arizona and Clemson to become only

the second Stanford back ever to rush
for 1,000 yards. He needs to average 63
yards a game to break Darrin Nelson's
season rushing mark of 1,069.
Wyman was one of only four players
to receive votes for Defensive Player of
the Year, an award that went to Arizona
linebacker Byron Evans. "1 wasn't
really sure," Wyman said. "There are a
lot of good players. My junior year
(1984), I thought I'd make it, and I got
second team. I thought I got screwed
that year. This year, there are so many
good linebackers, I didn't know."
Wyman leads Stanford in tackles this
season with 154, 69 ahead of fellow
linebacker Barry McKeever. He has
two interceptions, has caused one
fumble, and has combined on a sack.
He had a career-high 27 tackles against
USC, and has six games with 15 or
more tackles.
On Saturday, Wyman wore a jersey
with the word "Comeback" on the
back, signifying his return from a
career-threatening knee injury sus
tained in the 10th game of the 1984
season against Arizona.
Leiker has 56 tackles this season,
second among defensive linemen. He
has six sacks, second on the team, and
has caused and recovered a fumble.
Henley has averaged 12.2 yards on
29 punt returns this season, including a
92-yard touchdown that erased a Stan
ford record that had stood since 1923.
