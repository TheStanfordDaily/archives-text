# Spikers close regular season
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
It is the final home game of
their season, and it is the final
home game ever in the college
volleyball careers of their co
captains. But the Cardinal spikers
have a long way to go ... maybe.
Tonight, at 7:30 in Maples
Pavilion, Cardinal fans will have
their last chance to see this
year's edition of Stanford
women's volleyball in action. It
will be the last chance to watch
seniors Barbra Fontana and
Brooke Hahner as the team
readies itself for the program's
seventh straight national cham
pionship tournament appear
ance.
At the NCAAs, Stanford could
extend its 1986 season into late
December or have it ended as
soon as the last month's first
week.
Visiting No. 10 Stanford for
the regular season finale tonight
are the No. 11 Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo Mustangs, who beat
Stanford 15-7, 4-15, 15-6, 4-15,
15-12 a month ago in what has
become a classic example of the down side of Cardinal vol
leyball this fall: A steady, error-free opponent edges an
inconsistent Stanford. Five of the Cardinal's nine losses this
season have come in five-game matches.
When the three C's — concentration, communication and
confidence — have been there for the Cardinal, so has a
win, even against the toughest competition. When these C's
have deserted Stanford, the squad has struggled against les
ser teams and lost to equal or slightly superior teams.
Despite the fact that it will be her last game at Maples,
Hahner said she has not thought about tonight's game on a
personal level at all. The feeling of nostalgia, the mixed
emotions of the curtain call that you might expect the senior
co-captain to feel after four years as pan of the nation's most
consistent program are easily overshadowed by lingering
disappointment from Friday night's loss to UCLA and by the
upcoming playoffs, according to Hahner.
The outside hitter expressed concern over the Cardinal's
inability to get it together against the Bruins in what it knew
was a match for the Pacific 10 Conference title, an inability
which Stanford Coach Don Shaw said the team "couldn't fig
ure out" afterward.
Hahner said that "if we play with a lot of confidence, we
win," and that a win this evening would "give us a boost
going into the playoffs."
Shaw said he expects the players to be ready when they
take the court for their first playoff game Dec. 5.
Talking about this season's first match between Stanford
and Cal Poly-SLO, Shaw said, "We played sporadically I
think a lot of it had to do with the drive down — four hours
on a bus and then right onto the court against a team that
doesn't make many mistakes They gave us a chance to
make mistakes, and we did."
Tonight it will be the Mustangs who will be taking the
four-hour bus ride. Shaw said he also hopes that Cal Poly
finds the tables turned in terms of crowd support. "(Their
crowd) gave us a real tough time down there," he said.
