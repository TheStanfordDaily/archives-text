At the beginning of the Stanford women's cross country
team's 1986 season, freshman Carol Gray just wanted to do
well enough to make the traveling team.
When the team competed in yesterday's NCAA finals in
Tucson, Ariz., Gray was not only on the traveling roster, but
she also finished 25th and led all Stanford runners with a
time of 17:39.5, capping off a brilliant season.
The petite Gray, a top recruit from La Porte, Ind., was the
Cardinal's No. 1 runner throughout the 1986 season. She
finished third in the Pacific 10 Cross Country Champion
ships and second in last weekend's District 8 cham
pionships to help Stanford earn a berth in yesterday's
NCAA finals.
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson has been able to find
very few flaws with his prize freshman. "She's confident
enough in her own abilities and disciplined enough to do
exactly what she's supposed to do," he said.
"She's very coachable," Johnson added, "and basically
what she does is she allows herself to become an extension
of a coaching philosophy."
Gray seems not to notice the pressure associated with
being the top runner as a freshman. "It doesn't seem to af
fect her at all, one way or another," Johnson said. "I don't
think she'd be any different if she was No. 1 or No. 5. She
would be doing the same thing and acting the same way no
matter what her position is. She's got a rock-solid founda
tion.
"She addresses life as it is presented to her. There's no
sense in her wishing it differently. There are a lot more
gifted people in the world who won't get half as far as she's
going to go."
Is Gray surviving the transition from being in high school
to being a top collegiate athlete?

"It's challenging," she said "With the Stanford name, I
knew I'd be challenged academically along with athletics. I
knew if I would go here I'd get pushed.
"Roadtrips make it a little bit difficult," Gray added. "But
you have to be disciplined. You just can't waste time —
more so than other kids who aren't in a sport."
Although a driven competitor while racing, Gray does not
see herself as an intense person. "I don't think that I have to
blow off a whole day to relax," she said.
Gray has found Stanford to be more than just academics
and athletics. "That's the thing about Stanford — the admis
sions process is so stiff and so strict that you're bound to get
all these disciplined, hard-driving, interesting people.
"It's not the weather, not this or that," Gray added. "It's
the people I can talk with. That's the greatest thing about
Stanford."
Gray credits much of her success to her high school
coach, Doug Snyder. She began running her freshman year
at New Prairie High School in New Carlisle, Ind.
She eventually became a two-time member of the Kinney
National Cross Country Team and Indiana state champion in
cross country and track.
"I can say 'thanks a lot' to my high school coach and to the
guys that I trained with," Gray said. "I think our teamwork
got me my scholarship here and everything good that's hap
pening now."
