# Marino guns down Jets
## Dolphins' 45-3 victory drops New York to 10-2 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — Dan Marino threw for
288 yards and four touchdowns and
Lorenzo Hampton ran for 148 yards
and scored three times as the Miami
Dolphins beat the New York Jets 45-3
last night and ended the Jets' nine
game winning streak.
Marino completed 29 of 36, in an un
characteristic short-passing ball
control game that kept the ball for al
most two-thirds of the game and kept
the explosive New York offense off the
field. He hit Nat Moore with 22- and 21-
yarders and threw for 1-yard scores to
Hampton and Bruce Hardy as Miami
scored on seven of its first eight
possessions.
That gave him 31 touchdown passes,

making him the first NFL quarterback
ever to throw for 30 TDs in three
straight years.
Hampton, running against an injury
decimated New York front line missing
Joe Klecko, Mark Gastineau, Marty
Lyons and Lance Mehl, burst 54 yards
for a score on Miami's first possession.
He also scored from a yard out in the
second period and caught the pass
from Marino.
It was the first 100-yard game by a
Miami back in 41 games, dating back to
Oct. 14, 1984, and the first this season
against the Jets.
The win evened Miami's record at 6-
6 and kept their flickering wild-card
playoff hopes alive. The Jets, who lost

for the first time since the second week
of the season, are 10-2, a game ahead
of the New England Patriots in the AFC
East.
It was a complete reversal of form
for Miami, which had ranked last in the
NFL in rushing entering the game and
next-to-last in defense.
This time, the Dolphins limited Ken
O'Brien, the league's leading quarter
back, to 11 completions in 21 attempts
for 168 yards. The only two New York
threats when the game still was in
reach ended with a Johnny Hector
fumble at the Miami 16 in the first
quarter and an interception by Bud
Brown after the Jets had moved to the
Dolphins' 40 in the second period.
