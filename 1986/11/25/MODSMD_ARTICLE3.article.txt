# Out-of-state cars targeted by CHP

The luxury of an automobile on
campus may prove expensive to many
Stanford students.
The California Resident Foreign
Registration Program is threatening to
charge students who have not regis
tered their out-of-state cars with fees
that are cumulative to the number of
years they have been in California.
The statewide program to ensure ve
hicle registration has been in effect for
about 15 years, enforced jointly by the
California Highway Patrol (CHP) and
the Department of Motor Vehicles. In
the past two years, the Redwood City
CHP has adopted the program locally,
with Stanford being "one area of con
centration," according to Redwood
City officer Robert Voss.
"Stanford is not an area we single
out, but any university or state campus
tends to have a higher concentration of

out-of-state vehicles," Voss said.
Registration is required of any vehi
cle that is in California longer than the
state in which it is registered. Before
January 1984, drivers had until the
license plates expired, with a maxi
mum of one year, in which to register
the automobile. Now a period of just 20
days is given in order to pay the basic
$26 fee, along with a fee of two percent
of the car's assessed value.
Additionally, a late penalty for
registration is added. If the delay is un
der one year, a 40 percent penalty is
imposed, and an 80 percent penalty for
under two years. The penalties were
increased this spring from a flat 10
percent late fee. "We had an amnesty
period for six months to get everyone
on equal footing," Voss said.
The requirement to register an out
of-state vehicle also applies to those
who register to vote in California,
