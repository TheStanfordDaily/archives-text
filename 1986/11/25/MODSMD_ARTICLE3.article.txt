# Out-of-state cars targeted by CHP

The luxury of an automobile on
campus may prove expensive to many
Stanford students.
The California Resident Foreign
Registration Program is threatening to
charge students who have not regis
tered their out-of-state cars with fees
that are cumulative to the number of
years they have been in California.
The statewide program to ensure ve
hicle registration has been in effect for
about 15 years, enforced jointly by the
California Highway Patrol (CHP) and
the Department of Motor Vehicles. In
the past two years, the Redwood City
CHP has adopted the program locally,
with Stanford being "one area of con
centration," according to Redwood
City officer Robert Voss.
"Stanford is not an area we single
out, but any university or state campus
tends to have a higher concentration of

out-of-state vehicles," Voss said.
Registration is required of any vehi
cle that is in California longer than the
state in which it is registered. Before
January 1984, drivers had until the
license plates expired, with a maxi
mum of one year, in which to register
the automobile. Now a period of just 20
days is given in order to pay the basic
$26 fee, along with a fee of two percent
of the car's assessed value.
Additionally, a late penalty for
registration is added. If the delay is un
der one year, a 40 percent penalty is
imposed, and an 80 percent penalty for
under two years. The penalties were
increased this spring from a flat 10
percent late fee. "We had an amnesty
period for six months to get everyone
on equal footing," Voss said.
The requirement to register an out
of-state vehicle also applies to those
who register to vote in California,
claim a homeowners tax exemption,
have children in California schools,
rent a residence, own a telephone or
obtain a California driver s license or
identification card.
A majority of the people we cite
aren't aware of the law," said Voss, who
suggested that Stanford might advise
students on vehicle registration.
Voss described the registration
process as lengthy, involving paper
work, a smog test and vehicle identifi
cation number verification. If an auto
mobile is seen with out-of-state license
plates, a letter is mailed explaining the
program.
"If I feel they need to register their
car and they refuse, I go through the
District Attorney's office and charges
will be brought," said Voss, who ex
plained that for those that are inten
tionally defrauding the state, the fee
could run between $6,000 and $10,000.

Most of the cases are seen on the
freeways, with about 175-250 per
month in the Redwood City area.
' We're not out to prosecute, but to
make sure that vehicles are regis
tered," Voss said.
According to graduate student Larry
Bovett, the law is a "revenue-gaining
move on the pan of the state." Bovett
added: "There are 15 different defini
tions of residency in California."
"For collection purposes, the defini
tions are liberal, but for payment, they
are stria," Bovett said. Bovett, whose
wife was cited for out-of-state registra
tion, noted the fact that admission to
California state schools and univer
sities is very strict, while collection for
automobile registration is very liberal.
"The notion of applying (the law) to
students is silly because the main prob
lem is that state schools admit very few
non-residents, so the total of out-of
state student cars is small."
A recent Supreme Court decision
forced Alaska to have one definition of
residency, a move that Bovett sees as
a step in the right direction.
