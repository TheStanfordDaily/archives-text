# Walker: Shuttle explosion was preventable
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Calling the January explosion of the
space shuttle Challenger "an accident
that should have Ik'cu foreseen," an
applied physics professor here last
night criticized engineers and manage
ment at NASA and Motion t'hlokol for
the tragic incident.
Arthur Walker, a member of the
presidential commission that I lives
tlgated the accident, made his remarks
In a presentation that included slides
of the explosion before mote than <10
people at Hranner llall.
"We hail incompetent people who
were not deleted by the management
structure higher tip at NASA," Walker
said, stressing that some engineers In
volved with the shuttle pro|ect "didn't
understand the system."
The part of the system that failed was
an O ring, a rubbery, plastic device de
signed to expand and form a seal pre
venting, high pressure hot gases Inside
the solid rocket motor from reaching
the external fuel tank, Walker said,
That tank is filled with liquid hydrogen
and oxygen.
A breakdown on the putty surround
lug the O-rlng allowed the gases to
reach the tank, eventually leading to
the explosion that killed all seven crew
members on the 2Sth shuttle mission,
he said.
Temperatures In the 30s at the lime
ol the launch decreased the elasticity
of the shuttle's two c) rings, weakening
their ability to prevent the leak ol the
gases, Walker said.
"There was an indication that this

seal wui not working properly,"
Walker nuld, calling ilu- O ring design
"a problem that concerned a number
of people who were Involved In Un
building of the solid rocket motor,
Before the launch, officials at NASA
questioned engineers ai Morton
Thiokol, the company Involved with
production of the solid rocket motor,
about possible failure due to the low
temperature.
"The engineers, to the man, suld
don't launch, It's too cold,'" Walker
Suld.
No confirmed data, however, on the
effect* of temperature on the () rings
was available to NASA, he said. The
commission's report alter the cxplo
slon revealed that O t ings on all previ
ous launches that took place at temper
at tires below 65 degrees Fahrenheit
sustained damage,
"They didn't have enough data to
delay the launch, so they reversed their
decision," Walker said, Indicating that
previous delays In the launch might
have Influenced NASA officials to go
ahead with the mission
"They thought that If they continued
to delay, other shuttle launches would
be lost during the year," Walker said,
adding that "there were enormous
pressures (to launch) because they
(NASA) had overscheduled the
shuttle."
At the time of the explosion, the
space shuttles were being used by the
Department of Defense, as well as
foreign governments and private com
panics tor launching of communlca
lion satellites
"The shuttle Is not an operation ve
hlcle," Walker said, stressing that NASA

is a research institution with no expert
ence In scheduling operation systems,
NASA would have io have launched
each shuttle every two months to keep
up with ihc operational demands
placed on the system, a period of time
too short lor propot malntainance ol
the shuttles, lie said. Walker said It
takes four to six months after a launch
to prepare a shuttle for another mis
sion
Walker also cited a "very Indirect

and confusing management structure"
at NASA for the explosion, noting that
the branches ol the organization
"really operate quite Independently."
Engineers at the Johnson Space Cen
ter In Houston, Texas the scientists
responsible for the whole shuttle sys
tem were bypassed in the decision
i<> launch Challenger, he said.
Walker also said NASA had "no
central safety authority" and there was
"no one responsible for looking at the

system u.n a whole."
Walker said the commission ai
tempted to "lay down some general
principles" lor the space shuttle pro|
eei, The recommendations were
"completely accepted" by President
Reagan,
Included In the report is a new
design for the solid rocket motor that
Includes three O rings and a latch dc
signed to prevent separation of the two
pieces of metal that seal of the O rings,
