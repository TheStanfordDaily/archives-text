The Soviets have technological superiority over the
United States in nuclear arms development, according to
Edward Teller, an eminent physicist who played a key role
in the development of the hydrogen bomb.
"We are now approaching a point where the Soviets not
only have superiority, but they'll have such superiority that
they can claim almost anything," Teller, a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution, told approximately 120
people in Faisan Lounge last night.
The Strategic Defense Initiative aims to prevent that crisis,
according to Teller.
"We can make the outcome of a Soviet attack dubious
That is what the SDI argument is all about," he said.
"Hitler was an adventurer. The Soviets are not. The
Soviets are not gamblers.... They won't attack unless they
can predict the outcome," he said.
President Reagan's SDI program is important as a possi
ble means for sharing America's defense research with
other countries, according to Teller.
"The real initiative of Reagan is when people collaborate
on defense. [Defense research] is only done really effec
tively when it is done jointly by nations," said Teller, who
added that the United States is sharing much of its technol-

ogy, although not with the Soviets be
cause "they are not interested."
Teller said the concept of mutually
assured destruction is wrong.
"The Soviets now have a good
defense around Moscow. They have
every right to defend themselves.
Where 1 disagree is their argument that
we should not defend ourselves," he
said, referring to the anti-ballistic
missile system that protects the Soviet
capital.
"American retaliation is not only a
really terrible idea, it is rapidly becom
ing obsolete. The Soviets have the
defense that we are researching today.
There is evidence for that," he said.
The Soviets are also advanced in
their work on civil defense, according
to Teller.
"The Soviets are spending real
money to defend their population. The
Soviets today can shelter practically

their whole city population from a nu
clear explosion. And civil defense is as
important as SDI. The Soviets are
doing both, which is even better.
Teller strongly supports continua
tion of SDI research. "In this tech
nological age, to remain ignorant
about technological possibilities is a
luxury. >X'e cannot afford it now," he
said.
Answering a question about hypo
thetical war in Europe, Teller said he
would use nuclear weapons.
"I would not hesitate to use nuclear
explosives over my territory, or over
allied territory with allied consent,"
said Teller, who added he would only
use nuclear weapons over other na
tions' territories if a similar amount of
damage had already been inflicted on
the United States.
Teller, who has been at Hoover
since 1975, was one of 12 scientists to
receive the National Medal of Science
from President Reagan in May 1983.
Teller said he is not currently advis
ing Reagan, but "advising the presi
dent's advisers."
