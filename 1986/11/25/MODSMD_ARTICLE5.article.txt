# W. Culture focus probed

### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
A plan calling for faculty within the Western Culture Pro
gram to modify individual track syllabuses may mean it will
not be necessary to overhaul the program s focus, according
to the chair of a task force examining the issue.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, who heads the Western Culture
Task Force, said efforts already underway to include contri
butions by women and minorities in syllabuses may be suffi
cient reform in the program.
"Considerable change is in the process right at the mo
ment," he said.
Once these changes are completed, the only remaining
question will be whether or not the definition of the pro
gram will change, Seaver said, referring to suggestions that
the program be expanded to include world culture, not just
Western contributions.
The task force plans to continue to investigate changing
the focus to a world culture program, he said. Currently, the
task force is interviewing student groups and faculty from
individual tracks who are interested in changing the focus.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz echoed the belief that changes
effected by faculty within the program may be a sufficient
reform to the program, but he discounted the idea that the
overall focus of the Western Culture Program should be
changed.
Rebholz said he thought reading lists were being revised
to include women and minority authors, and this sort of self
governance by the faculty of each of the tracks "may be
enough with the Western Culture requirement.
"I hope that the task force continues on its course" of
reviewing objections to the program, but "I don't think we
should change the definition of Western Culture," Rebholz
said.
"I think we can reform from within," Rebholz added.
Rebholz said the need to expose students to something
other than Euro-Greek emphasis now offered might be bet
ter served by changing the non-Western Culture require
ment, which he feels students can complete without engag
ing Third World issues.
"The reason that Buddhism has so many students is that
there aren't enough courses to satisfy it (the non-Western
Culture requirement)," Rebholz said.
William Chace, vice provost for Academic Planning and
Development also does not favor an overhaul of the pro
gram.
. Chace said that "this is a moment of self-consciousness"
that is calling attention to the needs of the program that
are not being met. However, Chace said he believed the fac
ulty wanted the program to go on as it is currently and that
there was no utility in changing the program's definition.
Citing the lack of "a groundswell of opinion" by students
for a major overhaul of the program, Chace said he thought
thai those who were concerned about
the scope of the program made their
need* known And the University was
attentive to them,
A recently released survey showed
that H() percent of stuilents completing
the Western Culture program last year
thought It to Ite "a positive academic
experience, and 66 percent said that
they were "glad" the course was re
quired.
Seaver said he did not think this
report would alter the steps now being
taken to review- the program and that
he didn't think the report would have
"anything to do with our agenda."
