# Robotics aid the severely handicapped
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Adapting the latest technology in robotics and ar
tificial intelligence to aid the handicapped should be
a piece of cake, or so Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Larry Leifer hopes. After all, that's how his interest in
the field of robotic aids for the handicapped began.
In 1978, the 40 undergraduates of Mechanical En
gineering 116 A took Leifer's challenge to bake a cake
using a robot arm. The results so intrigued Leifer that
he began considering the applications robot technol
ogy could have for the handicapped.
Leifer theorized that a severely handicapped per
son could tell a robot to pick up, carry and otherwise
manipulate objects as he or she desired. The robot

would become a functional substitute for the per
son's inoperative limbs.
Attempting to bring this dream closer, Leifer and a
team of Stanford robotics engineers are currently
using the latest advances in both robotics and artifi
cial intelligence to give the physically disabled new
ways to access their surroundings. The team consists
of about a dozen specialists from a wide variety of
fields, including engineering, linguistics, behavioral
sciences and medicine, according to Leifer
The team currently is working with a robot that
stands about four-feet tall, is powered by 12 six-volt
aircraft batteries, receives commands through radio
waves and possesses three wheels allowing it to
move in any direction.
The robot is equipped with two on-board 32-bit

microprocessors, a small television camera and a
working mechanical hand.
The team hopes ultimately to create a robot that
can learn — a robot similar to the current model that
can be easily instructed by the user. "We are attempt
ing to make a general purpose tool that can be used
by elderly as well as young people if they are not able
to perform manipulative tasks," Leifer said.
The current prototype can be controlled using a
computer keyboard, voice commands or an
ultrasonic head control unit that reacts to the oper
ator's head motions. The robot will respond to
simple voice commands within its 70-word vocabu
lary, according to Leifer.

Two Stanford students take a roll in the Astro Turf after Saturday's Big Game. UC-
Berkeley upset the Cardinal by a score of 17-11. The loss affected some more than others.
Improving this ability to understand
vocal commands — called natural lan
guage processing — is one of the
greatest challenges facing the research
team. "At all stages, the interface be
tween human and machine is the most

demanding," Leifer said.
This interface is also one of the most
important parts of the robot. Natural
language processing ability will make
the robot useful to disabled persons
without the detailed technical knowl
edge necessary to program the. team's
first robot.
The earlier version of this type of
robot was an immobile table-top
model that used two eight-bit

microprocessors and had all its in
structions pre-programmed with the
assistance of a technician. Leifer's team
wants the second-generation version
to be instructable by virtually anyone.
This desire is why the team concen
trates on natural language processing,
also known as computational linguis
tics, Leifer said.
It's not practical "to have a computer
scientist strapped to each (robot)," he

said. "It's got to be some clown like
you or me who can tell it what to do."
The second-generation robot would
represent a 40-fold increase in com
puting power over the original ver
sion.
The research team currently has "a
good, workable version of each subsys
tem" and is working on the
"integration — the orchestration of the
pieces" of the robot, Leifer said.
