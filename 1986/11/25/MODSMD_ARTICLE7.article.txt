# Forum looks at planning, grove
## FEATURES 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
With the current glut of construction
on the Stanford campus, it's under
standable if students are a bit mystified
about the rhyme and reason behind
University building and development.
Students might also be excused for
feeling left out of the University's plan
ning process.
At a time when Stanford is poised on
the edge of a major push in building
and development in connection with
the University's Centennial, issues of
land use, planning, and facility use and
expansion are taking on increased im
portance.
Student representatives on the Uni
versity's Committee on Land and Build
ing Development (UCLBD) are hold
ing a student forum tonight in hopes of
increasing student understanding of
and involvement in the University's
planning and building process.
The forum will focus specifically on

Centennial Grove, a proposed
landscaping and art project intended as
a centerpiece of the Near West Campus
development and as a tribute to major
donors to the University during its first
100 years.
The forum will also be a launching
pad for a student survey about campus
facilities and land use, according to
senior Heather Stone, one of the or
ganizers of the forum and a student
representative on the UCLBD.
In addition, Stone said she and her
fellow organizer, graduate student
Joan Woodward, would like "to organ
ize this as a forum that can be used in
coming quarters as a means for stu
dents to become informed."
Stone said she also hoped the forum
might serve "as a model for other stu
dent representatives on other Univer
sity committees '
Stone and Woodward were chosen
for the UCLBD because they "were
both interested in actively represent
ing student interests," according to
Stone, a civil engineering major with a
focus on resources planning and man
agement.
The planned survey, to be reviewed
at the forum, is intended as a way to
gauge student interests and concerns
about campus development. In 1982,
Woodward handed out a questionnaire
to students in which 85 percent of re
spondents listed the Inner Quad
(which at that time was gravel-lined
and hazardous to bikers, as well as
an eyesore) as the area of campus
most demanding of repair or reno
vation.
The response helped hasten the sub
sequent overhaul of the Inner Quad.
Tonight's forum is the first of its kind
in recent memory.
"It's certainly a new thing to have a
student forum (on a University proj
ect)," said John Kennedy, a project en
gineer in the University Office of
Facilities Project Management and the
project manager for Centennial Grove.
At the forum, Kennedy will present
the proposed design of Centennial
Grove. The grove will be located by

the northwest corner of the Quad, ad
jacent to Math Corner and parallel to
what is now the parking lot for the
Varian Physics Building. It will be a vir
tual reflection of Dohrman Grove,
which is adjacent to the University Art
Gallery near the Quad's northeast cor
ner.
According to the University's project
description, Centennial Grove is
supposed "to respond to the goals of
providing an enhanced landscape, gat
hering and outdoor space as well as
provide the University with a means of
acknowledging and appreciating the
generousity of those who have given to
the University."
According to Kennedy, the hope is
that Centennial Grove will be com
pleted in time for the May 14, 1987
ceremonies celebrating the 100-year
anniversary of the laying of the Univer
sity's cornerstone.
The University set a long list of
criteria for the design of the site and
for an art piece to be an integral part of
the project.
A design has already been solicited
from and submitted by the team of
landscape architect John Wong and
sculptor Robert Behrens. Kennedy will
present a scale model of the design at
tonight's forum.
The design as submitted consists of a

large rectangular grove bordered by a
low-lying sandstone wall that can
double as a bench. A polished granite
walkway runs around the inside of the
wall. Existing trees will remain, supple
mented by a few additional ones.
The focal point of the grove is a grid,
roughly 54 feet by 50 feet, of 100
polished brass poles each 10-feet tall
and each set in a sandstone cube. The
brass poles are etched with a grating
that causes light to diffract around
them and create striking interference
patterns.
Kennedy said the submitted design
has thus far been received enthusiastic
ally.
"Everybody here (in the Office of
Facilities Project Management) likes
it,"he said. "This is just an idea, just a
concept... the intent being to just see
how an artist and architect would at
tack the problem ... nothing has been
approved now, but it's being consid
ered."
The Office of Development, which
initiated the donor recognition com
ponent of the grove, also received the
design well.
"We (the Office of Development
staff) think it does the job very, very
nicely," said Richard Bennett, director
of Campaign Planning in the Office of
Development. "The landscape archi

tect and designer have done a wonder
ful job of capturing many things that
are true about Stanford."
The design will be submitted to the
UCLBD for concept approval at its
December meeting. If the UCLBD gives
a positive recommendation, the design
will then have to gain approval from
the University Administrative Council
and the Board of Trustees, according
to Kennedy.
"We're certainly interested in Stan
ford student opinion ," Kennedy said.
"That's something that doesn't usually
happen with projects.... We didn't so
licit student input, but we're glad to
have it.... This one (project) was
unique because of the sculpture; it has
a special interest for students."
"I think that there are certain things
on this campus that it's very important
to get student opinion on," said Ben
nett, pointing to the recent renovation
of the Inner Quad as an instance in
which a great deal of student and other
input was solicited. "There was just a
ton of input (on the Inner Quad), and
the end result was very outstanding.
"Each project carries a different kind
of requirement for consultation," he
added.
The student forum is tonight at 7 in
the Tresidder Sequoia Room.

versity's Committee on Land and Build
ing Development (UCLBD) are hold
ing a student forum tonight in hopes of
increasing student understanding of
and involvement in the University's
planning and building process.
The forum will focus specifically on

Centennial Grove, a proposed
landscaping and art project intended as
a centerpiece of the Near West Campus
development and as a tribute to major
donors to the University during its first
100 years.
The forum will also be a launching
pad for a student survey about campus
facilities and land use, according to
senior Heather Stone, one of the or
ganizers of the forum and a student
representative on the UCLBD.
In addition, Stone said she and her
fellow organizer, graduate student
Joan Woodward, would like "to organ
ize this as a forum that can be used in
coming quarters as a means for stu
dents to become informed."
Stone said she also hoped the forum
might serve "as a model for other stu
dent representatives on other Univer
sity committees '
Stone and Woodward were chosen
for the UCLBD because they "were
both interested in actively represent
ing student interests," according to
Stone, a civil engineering major with a
focus on resources planning and man
agement.
The planned survey, to be reviewed
at the forum, is intended as a way to
gauge student interests and concerns
about campus development. In 1982,
Woodward handed out a questionnaire
to students in which 85 percent of re
spondents listed the Inner Quad
(which at that time was gravel-lined
and hazardous to bikers, as well as
an eyesore) as the area of campus
most demanding of repair or reno
vation.
The response helped hasten the sub
sequent overhaul of the Inner Quad.
Tonight's forum is the first of its kind
in recent memory.
"It's certainly a new thing to have a
student forum (on a University proj
ect)," said John Kennedy, a project en
gineer in the University Office of
Facilities Project Management and the
project manager for Centennial Grove.
At the forum, Kennedy will present
the proposed design of Centennial
Grove. The grove will be located by

the northwest corner of the Quad, ad
jacent to Math Corner and parallel to
what is now the parking lot for the
Varian Physics Building. It will be a vir
tual reflection of Dohrman Grove,
which is adjacent to the University Art
Gallery near the Quad's northeast cor
ner.
According to the University's project
description, Centennial Grove is
supposed "to respond to the goals of
providing an enhanced landscape, gat
hering and outdoor space as well as
provide the University with a means of
acknowledging and appreciating the
generousity of those who have given to
the University."
According to Kennedy, the hope is
that Centennial Grove will be com
pleted in time for the May 14, 1987
ceremonies celebrating the 100-year
anniversary of the laying of the Univer
sity's cornerstone.
The University set a long list of
criteria for the design of the site and
for an art piece to be an integral part of
the project.
A design has already been solicited
from and submitted by the team of
landscape architect John Wong and
sculptor Robert Behrens. Kennedy will
present a scale model of the design at
tonight's forum.
The design as submitted consists of a

large rectangular grove bordered by a
low-lying sandstone wall that can
double as a bench. A polished granite
walkway runs around the inside of the
wall. Existing trees will remain, supple
mented by a few additional ones.
The focal point of the grove is a grid,
roughly 54 feet by 50 feet, of 100
polished brass poles each 10-feet tall
and each set in a sandstone cube. The
brass poles are etched with a grating
that causes light to diffract around
them and create striking interference
patterns.
Kennedy said the submitted design
has thus far been received enthusiastic
ally.
"Everybody here (in the Office of
Facilities Project Management) likes
it,"he said. "This is just an idea, just a
concept... the intent being to just see
how an artist and architect would at
tack the problem ... nothing has been
approved now, but it's being consid
ered."
The Office of Development, which
initiated the donor recognition com
ponent of the grove, also received the
design well.
"We (the Office of Development
staff) think it does the job very, very
nicely," said Richard Bennett, director
of Campaign Planning in the Office of
Development. "The landscape archi

tect and designer have done a wonder
ful job of capturing many things that
are true about Stanford."
The design will be submitted to the
UCLBD for concept approval at its
December meeting. If the UCLBD gives
a positive recommendation, the design
will then have to gain approval from
the University Administrative Council
and the Board of Trustees, according
to Kennedy.
"We're certainly interested in Stan
ford student opinion ," Kennedy said.
"That's something that doesn't usually
happen with projects.... We didn't so
licit student input, but we're glad to
have it.... This one (project) was
unique because of the sculpture; it has
a special interest for students."
"I think that there are certain things
on this campus that it's very important
to get student opinion on," said Ben
nett, pointing to the recent renovation
of the Inner Quad as an instance in
which a great deal of student and other
input was solicited. "There was just a
ton of input (on the Inner Quad), and
the end result was very outstanding.
"Each project carries a different kind
of requirement for consultation," he
added.
The student forum is tonight at 7 in
the Tresidder Sequoia Room.

With the current glut of construction
on the Stanford campus, it's under
standable if students are a bit mystified
about the rhyme and reason behind
University building and development.
Students might also be excused for
feeling left out of the University's plan
ning process.
At a time when Stanford is poised on
the edge of a major push in building
and development in connection with
the University's Centennial, issues of
land use, planning, and facility use and
expansion are taking on increased im
portance.
