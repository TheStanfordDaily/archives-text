Biggest pullout yet in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Barclays Bank of Britain, citing finan
cial and political pressure, said yesterday it sold its last shares in its South
African affiliate for about $230 million. It was the biggest divestment yet by
a foreign company.
A consortium of South African companies signed the deal last week to
. buy Barclays' shares in Barclays National Bank of South Africa, the country's
largest commercial bank.
"The Barclays PLC sale of shares must have an impact on the South
African economy. It is certainly not a perilous matter, but it is cause for
serious concern in terms of psychological impact,'' Basil Hersov, chairman
of Barclays National, told a news conference.
The London-based Barclays Bank PLC once owned 100 percent of the
local affiliate, but since 1973 had reduced its share to 40.4 percent. Its final
pullout is the first by a major British company but follows withdrawal by
numerous American companies, most recently General Motors, Kodak and
IBM.
The value of the divestment and number of employees involved, 26,000,
made it the largest so far. However, officials of the local affiliate said the
existing staff and operations will be maintained.
South African bankers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
feared Barclays' withdrawal would encourage pullouts by other British
companies. Britain is the largest foreign investor in South Africa, with $8.5
billion, compared to about $1.3 billion in American investments.
In London, Barclays spokesman Geoffrey Kelly said the sale was made
chiefly because of the affiliate's poor economic performance and unfavor
able prospects for the South African economy.
But he told The Associated Press, "I think certainly political factors come
into it.
"The lack of progress toward ending apartheid has itself had impact on
the South African economy," he said. "It is also true that the threat to our
business in the U.K. and the U.S. is one of the factors, but not the prime fac
tor."
In Britain, anti-apartheid groups have protested outside Barclays'
branches to push for divestment.
The Citizen, a pro-government Johannnesburg paper, said the Barclays'
sale "would almost certainly be seen as a vote of no-confidence in South
Africa from a company which has had possibly the highest profile of all
foreign business interests here."
Peres pressured over Iran role
JERUSALUM — Foreign minister Shimon Peres tried yesterday to defuse
pressure on the Israeli government to disclose its role in shipping U.S.
arms to Iran, promising to report to a watchdog subcommittee in Parlia
ment.
He flatly refused, however, to give information about any Iranian arms
deal when he appeared before the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee,
an unwieldy, 26-member body where deliberations are rarely kept secret.
He promised instead to brief the six-member Subcommittee on Armed
Services.
The development came amid concern that an angry U.S. Congress could
make Israel a scapegoat for the U.S. administration's sales.
The political uproar in the United States over the arms shipments has
just begun to spread to Israel, where many Israelis accept that arms deals
are not a subject for public debate. The full 120-member Knesset, or parlia
ment, scheduled a debate for today on the issue.
mfm "There has never arisen a more bitter enemy of the Jewish people and,
in my opinion, of human civilization, than the Khomeini regime," said
"Abba EbaKi; i. formed foreign minister who presides over the Knesset com
mittee.
He referred to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary
patriarch.
President Reagan has said he authorized a third country, reportedly Is
rael, to ship arms to Iran to try to form links with Iranian moderates.
Bomber arrested near Pope
BRISBANE, Australia — A man carrying a gasoline bomb was arrested
near the Brisbane city hall today just hours before Pope John Paul II was
scheduled to visit the building, police reported.
Police spokesman Reg Gahan said only that the man was being ques
tioned. He did not identify the man or give further details.
The pope was scheduled to visit city hall at 4 p.m. before flying to Sydney
on his Australian tour.
Berlin tough on terrorists
BERLIN — Prosecutors said yesterday they proved Syria aided a terrorist
bombing in West Berlin and demanded that the two Palestinian defendants
receive stiff sentences to keep the city from becoming a battleground for
the Middle East.
The West Berlin court hearing the case said it would issue a verdict to
morrow in the trial of Farouk Salameh, 39, and Ahmed Nawar Hasi, 35, who
are accused of attempted murder and arms violations in the March 29 at
tack on the German-Arab Friendship Society. The bombing injured nine
people.
"We cannot allow Berlin to become a battleground for the Middle East,"
prosecutor Detlev Mehlis told the court.
"Tough sentences are a weapon in the struggle against terrorism. Mild
sentences will only lead to further terrorist activity," he said.
Prosecutors said the evidence at the trial proved "beyond doubt" that the
bombing attack was carried out by the two defendants and was planned by
Nezar Hindawi, Hasi's brother, with the help of Syrian officials.
Skiers trapped by floods in Wash.
SNOQUALMIE, Wash. — Flooding caused by heavy rain and melting
snow forced dozens of families from their homes yesterday and blocked
the only highway to a mountain resort where about 1,000 weekend skiers
were stranded.
Railroads were cut off east and south of Seattle by flooding and
mudslides, including one mudslide that cut a 300-foot-deep gap through 60
feet of track. Interstate 90, the state's major east-west highway, also was
closed for part of the day.
Another storm weather system is expected to hit the coast today, the Na
tional Weather Service said.
Plans had been made to airlift the skiers off Mount Baker, near the
Canadian border north of Seattle, where they were isolated Sunday, but
Neil Clement, spokesman for the Whatcom County Department of Emer
gency Services, said yesterday that apparently wasn't necessary.
Alleged scandel upsets Intelsat
WASHINGTON — Intelsat, the global communications satellite consor
tium, suspended its chief executive and his deputy yesterday after external
auditors identified $1.35 million in payments not authorized by the Intelsat
governing board.
The auditors questioned $1.35 million paid to two Little Rock, Ark.,
mortgage brokers for arranging a loan of between $60 million and $80 mil
lion to refinance the company's offices at Connecticut Avenue and Van Ness
Street, according to sources close to Intelsat and a copy of the auditors'
report obtained by The Washington Post.
This "disbursement was made under questionable circumstances, lacked
supporting documentation and was not authorized by the Board of Gover
nors," the auditors of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co said in a letter to the In

the only highway to a mountain resort where about 1,000 weekend skiers
were stranded.
Railroads were cut off east and south of Seattle by flooding and
mudslides, including one mudslide that cut a 300-foot-deep gap through 60
feet of track. Interstate 90, the state's major east-west highway, also was
closed for part of the day.
Another storm weather system is expected to hit the coast today, the Na
tional Weather Service said.
Plans had been made to airlift the skiers off Mount Baker, near the
Canadian border north of Seattle, where they were isolated Sunday, but
Neil Clement, spokesman for the Whatcom County Department of Emer
gency Services, said yesterday that apparently wasn't necessary.
Alleged scandel upsets Intelsat
WASHINGTON — Intelsat, the global communications satellite consor
tium, suspended its chief executive and his deputy yesterday after external
auditors identified $1.35 million in payments not authorized by the Intelsat
governing board.
The auditors questioned $1.35 million paid to two Little Rock, Ark.,
mortgage brokers for arranging a loan of between $60 million and $80 mil
lion to refinance the company's offices at Connecticut Avenue and Van Ness
Street, according to sources close to Intelsat and a copy of the auditors'
report obtained by The Washington Post.
This "disbursement was made under questionable circumstances, lacked
supporting documentation and was not authorized by the Board of Gover
nors," the auditors of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co said in a letter to the In

Biggest pullout yet in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Barclays Bank of Britain, citing finan
cial and political pressure, said yesterday it sold its last shares in its South
African affiliate for about $230 million. It was the biggest divestment yet by
a foreign company.
A consortium of South African companies signed the deal last week to
. buy Barclays' shares in Barclays National Bank of South Africa, the country's
largest commercial bank.
"The Barclays PLC sale of shares must have an impact on the South
African economy. It is certainly not a perilous matter, but it is cause for
serious concern in terms of psychological impact,'' Basil Hersov, chairman
of Barclays National, told a news conference.
The London-based Barclays Bank PLC once owned 100 percent of the
local affiliate, but since 1973 had reduced its share to 40.4 percent. Its final
pullout is the first by a major British company but follows withdrawal by
numerous American companies, most recently General Motors, Kodak and
IBM.
The value of the divestment and number of employees involved, 26,000,
made it the largest so far. However, officials of the local affiliate said the
existing staff and operations will be maintained.
South African bankers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
feared Barclays' withdrawal would encourage pullouts by other British
companies. Britain is the largest foreign investor in South Africa, with $8.5
billion, compared to about $1.3 billion in American investments.
In London, Barclays spokesman Geoffrey Kelly said the sale was made
chiefly because of the affiliate's poor economic performance and unfavor
able prospects for the South African economy.
But he told The Associated Press, "I think certainly political factors come
into it.
"The lack of progress toward ending apartheid has itself had impact on
the South African economy," he said. "It is also true that the threat to our
business in the U.K. and the U.S. is one of the factors, but not the prime fac
tor."
In Britain, anti-apartheid groups have protested outside Barclays'
branches to push for divestment.
The Citizen, a pro-government Johannnesburg paper, said the Barclays'
sale "would almost certainly be seen as a vote of no-confidence in South
Africa from a company which has had possibly the highest profile of all
foreign business interests here."
Peres pressured over Iran role
JERUSALUM — Foreign minister Shimon Peres tried yesterday to defuse
pressure on the Israeli government to disclose its role in shipping U.S.
arms to Iran, promising to report to a watchdog subcommittee in Parlia
ment.
He flatly refused, however, to give information about any Iranian arms
deal when he appeared before the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee,
an unwieldy, 26-member body where deliberations are rarely kept secret.
He promised instead to brief the six-member Subcommittee on Armed
Services.
The development came amid concern that an angry U.S. Congress could
make Israel a scapegoat for the U.S. administration's sales.
The political uproar in the United States over the arms shipments has
just begun to spread to Israel, where many Israelis accept that arms deals
are not a subject for public debate. The full 120-member Knesset, or parlia
ment, scheduled a debate for today on the issue.
mfm "There has never arisen a more bitter enemy of the Jewish people and,
in my opinion, of human civilization, than the Khomeini regime," said
"Abba EbaKi; i. formed foreign minister who presides over the Knesset com
mittee.
He referred to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary
patriarch.
President Reagan has said he authorized a third country, reportedly Is
rael, to ship arms to Iran to try to form links with Iranian moderates.
Bomber arrested near Pope
BRISBANE, Australia — A man carrying a gasoline bomb was arrested
near the Brisbane city hall today just hours before Pope John Paul II was
scheduled to visit the building, police reported.
Police spokesman Reg Gahan said only that the man was being ques
tioned. He did not identify the man or give further details.
The pope was scheduled to visit city hall at 4 p.m. before flying to Sydney
on his Australian tour.
Berlin tough on terrorists
BERLIN — Prosecutors said yesterday they proved Syria aided a terrorist
bombing in West Berlin and demanded that the two Palestinian defendants
receive stiff sentences to keep the city from becoming a battleground for
the Middle East.
The West Berlin court hearing the case said it would issue a verdict to
morrow in the trial of Farouk Salameh, 39, and Ahmed Nawar Hasi, 35, who
are accused of attempted murder and arms violations in the March 29 at
tack on the German-Arab Friendship Society. The bombing injured nine
people.
"We cannot allow Berlin to become a battleground for the Middle East,"
prosecutor Detlev Mehlis told the court.
"Tough sentences are a weapon in the struggle against terrorism. Mild
sentences will only lead to further terrorist activity," he said.
Prosecutors said the evidence at the trial proved "beyond doubt" that the
bombing attack was carried out by the two defendants and was planned by
Nezar Hindawi, Hasi's brother, with the help of Syrian officials.
