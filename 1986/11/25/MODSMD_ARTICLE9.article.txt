# Reagan Cabinet shake-up possible
## President's closest advisers urge removal of Shultz, Poindexter 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The State Department's number
two official, in a dramatic new demonstration of
open revolt within the administration, called on the
White House yesterday to "undo the damage" caused
by its secret arms-and-hostages deal with Iran and
challenged President Reagan's contention that Teh
ran has stopped supporting terrorism.
"I don't like to have to differ with my president,"
said Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, "but 1
believe there is some evidence of Iranian involve
ment with terrorists." He noted what he called Iran's
association with the taking in recent months of three
more American hostages in Lebanon.
Reagan has asserted publicly that Iran, which
received U.S. arms shipments as part of an adminis
tration effort to establish ties with so-called
moderates and help free American hostages, is no
longer involved with terrorists even though it
remains on the State Department's list of countries
supporting terrorism.
Whitehead's comments, an almost unprecedented
challenge by a Cabinet member to the White House,
came amid mounting pressure on Reagan to oust
Secretary of State George Shultz for publicly oppos
ing the president on his Iranian initiative.
Whitehead's testimony, given before the House
Foreign Affairs Committee as Shultz's representative,
left some committee members looking stunned.
He castigated the White House National Security

Council for the way it conducted Iranian policy,
saying the State Department still had not been told
many important facts about the arms shipments.
"We in the State Department find it difficult to
cope with National Security Council staff operational
activities ... particularly when we don't know about
them," he said. "The department was at no time
operationally involved."
But Whitehead, insisting that it would be "a ter
rible tragedy" for the president to fire Shultz, des
cribed the secretary of state as "an extremely able
American" who could provide the "forward move
ment" needed to help the administration deal with
the current crisis.
At the White House, summaries of Whitehead's tes
timony were hurriedly distributed among aides who
have been privately saying that Shultz should be fired
for opposing the president and undermining his
credibility on the Iranian operation.
One senior aide, who declined to be identified,
said, "I don't know anything for sure, but my gut tells
me some kind of a shake-up will happen this week."
Despite unrelenting criticism of the arms-and
hostages deal, the president reiterated that he "didn't
make a mistake" and declared, "I'm not firing
anybody."
However, when he was questioned by reporters
during an Oval Office ceremony about whether he
was satisfied with his staff, he merely murmured.

"Um-mmm." And when pressed whether there
would be a staff shake-up, he replied, "I'm not com
menting either way."
Reagan summoned administration officials in
volved in his Iran policy to a meeting at the White
House yesterday afternoon but released no informa
tion on the discussions.
Lyn Nofziger, a long-time Reagan adviser who once
served as his chief political aide in the White House,
yesterday joined another former White house politi
cal aide, Ed Rollins, in calling for a shake-up and
criticized Shultz for opposing the Iranian deal. "My
own feeling is if you work for the president and can't
support his policy, you ought to resign," Nofziger
said.
One high-level administration official, describing
the enormity of the crisis, said, "The president is
slowly bleeding and somebody's got to come up with
a strategy to stop it, because this thing is not going to
go away by itself."
Several of Reagan's longtime California confidants
are urging a major shake-up in which Shultz, White
House Chief of Staff Donald Regan and White House
National Security Adviser John Poindexter would be
removed. One of the Californians said yesterday that
Reagan "has always understood the magnitude of the
problem this creates better than his staff does."
