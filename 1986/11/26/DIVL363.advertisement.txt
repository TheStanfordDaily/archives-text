You want price ??
WE GOT PRICE !!
You've waited and waited and waited. "I know if I wait long enough, Apple will
lower it's prices for Christimas." AND YOU WERE RIGHT!! We have lowered our
prices. We are now offering the Macintosh Plus and Imagewriter II Printer
for a "world's lowest" price of just $1,561.50. The 512K Macintosh and
ImagerWriter II Printer is just $1241.50. (Promotion lasts until Jan. 9,1987).
Not only can you get the most popular computer on campus for these low prices, but
we will throw in Mac Lightning, the premier spelling checker containing an 80,000 word
dictionary for free.
This Holiday Bundle makes a perfect gift you can recommend to Mom and Dad when
they ask what they can get you this Christmas.
So while you're studying for finals or typing a project paper, (or preparing them for your
students) remember that next quarter you can have the same computer over 7,000 of
your fellow students, faculty, and staff members have already taken advantage of.
Call us at 415/329-1217 or come to the Bookstore for a demonstration.
