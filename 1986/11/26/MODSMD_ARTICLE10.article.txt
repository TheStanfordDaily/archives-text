# Congress attacks arms deals
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Members of Congress, outraged
by the news that profits from the Iranian arms sales
were sent to Nicaraguan rebels in the face of a con
gressional ban, said yesterday the deal was probably
illegal and certainly called into question President
Reagan's stewardship of U.S. foreign policy.
Although Congress is not in session, many Demo
cratic lawmakers issued public statements predicting
that the disclosure would lead to congressional in
vestigations and ultimately to legislation, including a
vote by Congress to suspend military aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras.
Republican leaders generally applauded the presi
dent for taking the correct action in ousting the Na
tional Security Council staff member involved in the
profits transfer, but they did not try to minimize the
severity of the crisis. Rep. William Broomfield (R-
Mich.) described it as "a very serious foreign policy
crisis" and predicted that others would be implicated
in the scandal.
"It was a shocking revelation and it further shows
up the chaotic state of our foreign policy," said Sen
ate Democratic leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.)
"There's something wrong if the president doesn't
know what's going on in the basement of the White
House. What this says is nobody seems to be really in
charge of the foreign policy of this country."

Some Democrats, such as House Majority Leader
Jim Wright (D-Texas) even went so far as to question
whether the president was telling the truth when he
said he was unaware of the deal until a Department
of Justice inquiry exposed it.
"How could the president not know?" Wright
asked, saying Reagan is able "in his own mind to
reject information he doesn't want."
In addition to planning their own hearings, mem
bers of Congress called on the president to take a
number of steps to repair the damage to his adminis
tration and his foreign policy.
Those included firing Donald Regan, the White
House chief of staff, issuing an executive order bar
ring the National Security Council staff, which di
rected the Iranian arms pipeline, from participating
in operations and appointing a special prosecutor to
look into possible criminal action.
Also recommended was the appointment of a spe
cial envoy to visit European and Middle Eastern allies
who were angered by the secret shift in U.S. policy
toward terrorism.
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who will be chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee in the 100 th
Congress to convene in January, said the deal was
probably a misappropriation of taxpayer funds.

Nunn and others cited at least three laws they said
were probably violated:
• The Arms Export Control Act, which requires
Congress to be notified of all transfers of American
arms — even by third countries. Sen. John Glenn CD-
Ohio) said that under the law the Congress should
have been notified of Israeli shipments of U.S. arms
to Iran.
• A prohibition that existed in the law until last Oct. 1
against the expenditure of any U.S. funds for military
assistance to the contras. The sale proceeds
reportedly were transferred to the contras between
January and September this year. Rep. Michael
Barnes (D-Md.), chairman of the House subcommit
tee on Latin America, said the law specifically
prohibited U.S. agencies making arrangements with
third countries to funnel financial support to the con
tras.
• The National Security Act's provision requiring the
president to notify Congress of all covert operations
by the U.S. government either in advance or in a
"timely" fashion. Glenn said the timely notice provi
sion was designed "to give the president a little
breathing room on a weekend" if he could not notify
Congress in advance, but was never designed to keep
an operation secret for many months.
