# Israel denies funding contras

### 
JERUSALEM — Israel's government
early this morning, Jerusalem time,
confirmed its involvement in shipping
arms to Iran at the behest of the White
House but strongly denied it had
played any role in funneling a portion
of Iranian payments to U.S.-backed
Nicaraguan rebels, or contras, in ap
parent violation of U.S. law.
In a terse statement issued after a
two-hour emergency meeting of the
country's three top leaders, Israel said
the funds were paid directly by an
unnamed Iranian representative into a
Swiss bank account "in accordance
with instructions from the American
respresentative. These funds did not
pass through Israel."
The statement, which did not name
the American involved, added that "the

government of Israel was surprised to
learn that supposedly a portion of
these funds was transferred to the con
tras. If such a transaction took place, it
had nothing to do with Israel and the
government of Israel had no knowl
edge of it. Israel did not serve, and
would not have served, as a channel
for such a transaction."
The Israeli statement appeared to
provide a different account of what had
taken place from that given by U.S. At
torney General Edwin Meese at a press
conference in Washington yesterday,
although Meese's remarks left open a
possible distinction between the Is
raeli government and individual Is
raelis who may have been involved as
arms traders and intermediaries.
Under questioning about whether

persons other than National Security
Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver North, who
was fired yesterday, were involved in
money transfers, Meese said:
"Bank accounts were established, as
best we know, by representatives of
the forces in Central America. And this
information was provided to represen
tatives of the Israeli government... or
representatives of Israel, I should say
... and then these funds were put into
the accounts."
The hastily drafted Israeli explana
tion did not give any details about the
kind of equipment that was shipped to
Iran or the dates of the shipments nor
did it say why some shipments were
made that apparently were not ap
proved before the fact by the United
States.

It also did not disclose the amount
of money involved or explain how
some of the money — reportedly $12
million — was paid to the United
States while the rest — estimated by
Meese to be $10 million to $30 million
— was not.
The statement marked an abandon
ment of the government's previous
strategy — adopted three weeks ago
when an Israeli role in secret arms
sales to Iran were first disclosed — of
making absolutely no public comment
in the hope that the issue would fade
away.
An emergency meeting of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Foreign Mini
ster Shimon Peres and Defense Mini
ster Yitzhak Rabin was held.
