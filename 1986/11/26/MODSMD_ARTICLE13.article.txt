						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Make stadium dry 
### 
Hundreds of students crowd into a small space. They
drink a lot of beer. Some get drunk. Fights break out,
beer gets sprayed, cans get thrown. Things get out of
hand.
A fraternity party at 3 a.m.? Or Stanford Stadium on a
Saturday afternoon?
The many alcohol-related disturbances at the stadium
this season demonstrate clearly that booze and Cardinal
football do not mix. Stanford should do as most other
universities have done and ban alcohol at its athletic
events.
Stanford police report that at one of the home games
this fall a woman was injured when she was hit by a full
can of beer.
At another game, one of the Dollies was hit in the face
by a pomegranate thrown from the student section. Ac
cording to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, there
have also been cases of "drunken brawling" in the
stands.
The loudness, the beer-spraying and the generally dis
ruptive behavior of inebriated fans has been an ongoing
source of annoyance and embarrassment this football
season.
A combination of factors makes a football stadium a
highly unsuitable place for alcohol consumption. To

begin with, the relative anonymity of a large audience
removes some of the social inhibitions to disruptive be
havior that might otherwise restrain a student who had
had too much to drink
Secondly, football is a violent game designed to excite
its audience. If part of that audience is drunk, the game's
"excitement" can all too easily spark fighting, thrown
cans or other violent behavior in the stands.
A dry stadium policy would also minimize the number
of fans who drive home drunk from football games. If
students and alumni want to make alcohol a part of their
football Saturdays, they can drink as much as they wish at
pre-game tailgaters.
One might argue that banning booze would drive
away many fans, particularily students. However, other
universities that have banned alcohol from their
stadiums do not have this problem. Besides, students
who come to the games in order to drink shouldn't be
there in the first place. Removing alcohol from the
stadium would help focus audience attention where it
belongs: on the game.
A dry stadium policy would largely eliminate embar
rassing alcohol-related injuries, fights and disruptions
and make Stanford's home games more enjoyable expe
riences.
