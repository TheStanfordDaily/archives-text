# Take a chance: Work at friendship
## 
### 
The other day, I saw someone with whom I was
close freshman year. We talked for a while, observed
that we hadn't kept up with each other (and thus im
plicitly acknowledged that we are not now as close as
we once were) and continued on our different ways.
I wondered if my friendship that is less intimate than
it once was is unique here at Stanford. After talking to
other students, I decided that my experience has
been shared by many people.
This situation can be understood as a conflict be
tween, on the one hand, the desire for friendships
and the pleasure one receives from them and, on the
other hand, certain forces that gravitate against per
sonal closeness. Two of these forces include distance
and a natural tendency of people to drift from each
other as they change. The third factor consists of
what I call the "achieving lifestyle" here, its accompa
nying individualistic attitudes and the greater value
society places on the individual pursuits that charac
terize this lifestyle. This difficulty in maintaining
closeness with friends is rarely brought up in the dis
cussion of Stanford before one arrives here.

The issue of what close friendships consist of
needs to be addressed. Friendships involve vul
nerability and trust and require active effort to main
tain. Close friends tend to share many things, which
range from similar sensibilities (which can come
from being raised in the same geographic region), to
shared experiences and pleasure in being with each
other, to compatible interests and activities (be they
partying or a Bible study group), and finally to com
mon goals and values. I neither pretend that this list
is exhaustive nor do I proscribe an "ingredient ap
proach" to friendship (that is, even if two people ful
fill three of the criteria I have mentioned, they will
not necessarily be good friends). Rather I am at
tempting to depict several components that I have
found to be common to many close friendships and
to stress the effort that friendships require.
Several forces gravitate against the maintenance
and strengthenening of friendship bonds. The first
factor is proximity or the lack of it. I learned in Psych.
1 that while the cliche "absence makes the heart
grow fonder" may be true, the dictum "Out of sight,
out of mind" tends to be a stronger informant of
human behavior. We have contact with the people
with whom we live simply because they are there.
Similarly, it is more difficult to maintain contact with
someone who lives further away and whom we do
not normally see every day. We tend not to make the
effort to trek off campus or to Sterling Quad and the
Cowell Cluster if we do not live near these

residences, in pan because it is not as easy as riding
to our own dorm for lunch. Thus, part of why
relationships become distant stems from basic prox
imity.
Personal change and its impact on a friendship is a
second force that can work against intimacy. People
drift from each other as they change. We pick our
friends for who we think we are and what we value at
any particular stage of our lives. These self-images
and values evolve over a period of time. Each change
in an individual requires a shift in the basis of the re
lationship. To change the framework of a relation
ship requires effort and work by both partners, is of
ten painful and is often not undertaken because of
the pain involved. Thus, relationships often do not
survive this transition in values, and people emerge
distant from each other over a period of time. One's
companions in mad partying freshman year may not
necessarily be the same people with whom one
hangs out as a sophomore, and these sophomore
buddies are not always the same people as senior
year friends.
The "achieving lifestyle" and its accompanying in
dividually oriented attitudes seem more specific to
Stanford than the other two dimensions. What is an
"achieving lifestyle"? Broadly speaking, it is a lifestyle
that is both goal-oriented and involved in endeavors
deemed "successful" by society. More concretely, it
means striving for individual achievement, be it
playing a sport, doing well in school or auditioning
for and gaining entrance into a singing group. These
efforts are usually conducted in the context of a great
goal, be it a job as an investment banker, a place in
graduate school or simply a quality education. This
way of life is underpinned by an emphasis on indi
vidual and competitive rather than cooperative
values — our society rewards making lots of money
more than working at friendships.
People at Stanford tend to be tuned into an
achievement wavelength before arriving here; in fact,
it is almost obligatory to be so attuned in order to
gain admission to the University. A cursory examina
tion of the admissions process demonstrates this
point. It is difficult to gain admission here, as
evidenced by the approximately l-in-6 or l-in-7 ac
ceptance rate. In order to be considered a "qualified
candidate" for admission, people must have
"accomplished" many things in high school. Valedic
torians, Boys and Girls Staters and All-Everything sci
entists abound here. These activities require a great
deal of time — time in which one is focused on
oneself. Thus, people arrive at Stanford with a dis
position toward choosing individual activities over
the less societally recognized work of maintaining
friendships.
This trend is furthered when one arrives here and
embarks on the "Stanford experience." We are con
stantly urged by University officials, by our parents
and even by ourselves to make a difference, to ex
plore the resources that are here, to make the most
of our tremendous opportunity. We respond to this
prompting by involving ourselves in Stanford on
many levels. Some people take 20 units, others

become political activists, others join fraternities or
sororities, and so on. The net result of all this activity
is that people not only are very busy but feel even
busier.
This relates to friendships in that people get so in
volved in their individual activities that they tend not
to work at friendships. When a perceived conflict
arises between doing an activity and biking half a
mile to see a friend, the conflict is often resolved in
favor of the former option. This tendency is accen
tuated when the relationship with the friend is
changing, requires additional understanding, and
thus may be a difficult scene with which to deal.
When one adds the factors that the individual activity
will be more openly lauded by society, the picture
becomes complete. Thus friendships become more
distant not because of a lack of desire for closeness
but because of overinvolvement in one's own activi
ties and underinvolvement in the effort it takes to
strengthen friendship bonds.
While I realize that this phenomenon occurs the
world over, it seems to me that feeling very ctfn-"
nected with one's own life, relatively "tfriCdhnecred*"
with others, and the loneliness that accompanies this
situation is both a partial consequence of the achiev
ing lifestyle and a common experience here at Stan
ford. I believe there are many people walking
around campus who would gladly do a few fewer ac
tivities and feel a little closer to other people than
they currently feel. They do not do so because of the
situation they are in, one which rewards
"achievement" but does not particularly reward
close friendships. Many people hesitate to take ac
tions (such as hanging out with friends when a paper
is due) which they perceive will jeopardize their
achievements and long-term goals. Thus, they con
tinue to conduct their activities, become distant from
once close friends and wonder if what they are doing
is worthwhile.
This aspect of Stanford is rarely discussed before
one arrives here. When one applies here, the gor
geous campus, the amazing resources and the
"prestige" are mentioned much more than the diffi
culty in maintaining friendships. We are told,
"Stanford is one of the finest universities in the
world," not "Stanford is a great place, people tend to
be very busy, and thus be prepared for a great deal of
emotional unavailability." I contend that while the
second statement is largely true, one's time here
does not have to be spent this way. One can have inti
mate friendships here, but they must be given a
priority in your life — they do not spontaneously oc
cur and remain. I am neither speaking out against
achievement nor saying that no one has close friends
here; rather, I am addressing a consequence of both
natural tendencies and the "track" we find ourselves
on. While sharing a beer, cranking tunes or discuss
ing the nature of a changing friendship may not gain
one admission to law school, these actions may help
people feel less alone.
