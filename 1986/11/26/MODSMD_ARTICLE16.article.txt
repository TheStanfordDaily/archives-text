Black scholars
program is racist
This letter refers to a recent front
page article about the establishment
of the Black Scholars Program (BSP)
at Stanford (Daily, Nov. 19). In the
article, the start of "a research/tutorial
project... that offers black students
the opportunity to engage in individ
ual research with black faculty" was
announced.
The goals and aims of this type of
program are admirable. As Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee aptly mentioned at the
opening reception for the BSP, it will
address two needs of Stanford's un
dergraduate education: "The first is
the need to,personalize education, to.
bring students arid faculty into per
" sonal relationships— iiie second is
the need for faculty to involve under
graduates in research."
Yes, the aims are worthy of merit,
but are they meritorious because of
the racial emphasis of the BSP? Why is
it more right for the University to fund
14 research scholarships this spring
specifically for blacks than to fund
scholarships for Asians or Hispanics?
What about Catholics or Jews? Why
won't there be special projects for
these minorities? Obviously this is
merely a foil for my point — that the
racial nature of the BSP is racist, plain
and simple.
Once again, the ideals are admira
ble. Closer relationships with our
professors both in research and per
sonal ways can only improve our
school. But the method should go
through the academic departments of
Stanford. Using race as the vehicle to
improve the experiences of a few is
both sad and disturbing, for it goes
against the non-discriminatory
precepts that we as an academic and
moral community should hold sacred.

Abusive letter
proves need for
Proposition 63
I have spent 50 years traveling
around the globe studying, among
other things, bilingualism, about
which I have published scholarly
articles. I therefore had a special
interest in Proposition 63, about
which I wrote a piece in the Stanford
Daily (Oct. 30). In it, I mentioned the
indignation of those defending
Proposition 63 who had been sub
jected to scurrilous attacks by militant
Hispanics. These attacks backfired,
and the proposition was overwhelm
ingly approved by all grdups, except
th(THispanics, wtR/ Voted against It by
* a slight majority. ~
My article received the commenda
tion of serious scholars and also of a
Chicano, who came to interview me
for a piece he plans to write for the
Stanford Chicano magazine. I am
delighted to discuss these issues with
polite individuals such as him. An
exchange of divergent views is the
lifeblood of the University.
However, the letter by a group of
Spanish graduate students (Daily, Nov.
20) is quite a different matter. It is a
repeat of the ad hominem abuse
against which I had warned. It is one
of the most abusive letters I have read
in The Stanford Daily. If it represents
the mentality of the opponents of
Proposition 63,1 congratulate the
public in showing good sense and not
listening to them, or listening with
revulsion.
I have spent much of my life help
ing Hispanics, and I delight in intellec
tual exchange, but I will not engage in
abuse unworthy of a university, or
indeed, civilized society.
