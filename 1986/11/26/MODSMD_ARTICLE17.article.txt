# Money corrupts Stanford research
## 
### 
Thank you for your good editorial (Nov. 17) on lab
animals. It happened to appear on the first day of the
trial — which is still going on at the North County
Courthouse in Palo Alto — of seven of the 19 people
arrested last April for a peaceful Jordan Hall sit-in, the
purpose of which had been to demand greater ac
countability from the research community — the
very thing your editorial advocated.
There is, however, one correction I should like to
make. Your editorial stated: "Further proof of the
NlH's (National Institute of Health) ineffectiveness is
that the agency has suspended Stanford's funding in
recent years, yet research seems to have continued
unabated."

You are quite right in saying that the NIH is inef
fective and that research has continued abated. But
the reason it has continued is that the funding has
not been cut off. What makes this significant is that
Stanford has, since 1981, been judged in non
compliance with the NlH's own guidelines for the
care of laboratory animals, as expressed by the
withdrawal of accreditation by the American Associa
tion for Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC), the agency
charged by the NIH for the monitoring of its
guidelines.

In 1981 Stanford received $44,511,192 for direct
costs from the NIH. By fiscal 1985, the last year for
which published NIH figures are available, Stanford
got $71,736,015 plus the 69 percent for indirect cost
recovery that is added to research grants, thus total
ing some $121 million for last year alone.
Given the annual increments of more than $6.5
million that the NIH has been lavishing on Stanford
since it no longer adhered to the NIH guidelines, this
present year may well be seeing the disbursement of
about $79 million, which, with the addition of the 71
percent Stanford now receives for indirect cost
recovery, makes for some $135 million of govern
ment funds received for biomedical research.
With figures like these at stake, one may be
excused for some skepticism that it is only the medi
cal profession's unadulterated altruism or the irre
sistible urge for scientific investigation that keeps re
search (much of which is animal research) going.
It should help, too, to put into proper perspective
the claims of such people as Dr. Thomas Hamm,
director of Stanford's Division of Laboratory Animal
Medicine, that the NIH imposes stringent controls on
the safekeeping of laboratory animals. The other two
stringent controls generally cited are the internal
review committee your editorial takes to task for its
rigid exclusion of animal advocates and the Animal
Welfare Act, a piece of legislation so feeble that un
der it, in the 20 years of its existence, no researcher
has ever been convicted, regardless of the number

ratory Animal Care.

and ghastliness of the atrocities that have come to
light.
Money, like power, tends to currupt. Much money
corrupts absolutely, and Stanford University gets
much money from animal research.
