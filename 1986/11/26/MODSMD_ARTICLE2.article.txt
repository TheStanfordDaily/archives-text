# Iranian arms sales linked to contra support
## Experts respond 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
Scholars here last night criticized
Reagan administration officials in
volved in U.S. arms sales to Iran that
were linked yesterday to U.S. aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels and said the key
remaining issue is whether other offi
cials knew of the transactions.
"It means that we've got another
president whose commitment to am
bitious foreign policy goals has led to
playing footloose with the Constitu
tion," said Hubert Marshall, emeritus
professor of political science.
"In that respect it resembles what
went on in the Nixon administration,"
he added.
"The revelations are very disturb
ing," said Political Science Prof. Alex
ander George. "There has to be a thor
ough and impartial investigation," he
added.
The key issue to be resolved is
whether officials higher than National
Security Adviser John Poindexter au
thorized or knew about the plan to fill
Swiss bank accounts for the contras,
George said.
"More people probably know about
it, and this was their way of getting out
of the bind — letting these guys take
the fall," said Terry Moe, referring to
yesterday's resignation of Vice Adm.
Poindexter and dismissal of Poindexter
aicTe"l.t. Col 'diver North. "It's difficult
to believe" that no one else knew
about the secret arrangements, said
Moe, an associate professor of political
science. He and others cautioned that

all the facts are not yet known.
Most of the professors interviewed
raised the possibility of the president
intentionally shielding himself from
precise knowledge of clandestine ef

forts to supply the contras or of ad
visers intentionally informing the pres
ident of such efforts in only vague
terms.
George questioned the role of Attor
ney General Edwin Meese in inves
tigating responsibility for the scheme.
Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) correctly
pointed out that it is "not entirely reas
suring to have Ed Meese take charge of
the investigation," George said.
It is difficult to reconcile Meese's
stated loyalty to the president with the
conducting of a proper investigation,
George said.
The professors agreed the adminis
tration made the correct choice in
going public with the information and
staff shake-up yesterday. The adminis
tration "cut its losses by going public"
rather than waiting for Congress to dis
cover the dealings, Moe said.
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution and former
Reagan adviser, said going public was
"the right thing to do." While the dis
closure "doesn't help the president,"
the administration "seems to have
already moved fairly quickly" in trying
to identify those responsible, he told
University News Service.
Most of the speculation revolves
around the reaction of Congress to yes
terday's revelations. Congress is
"already furious," Marshall said. Law
makers believe that "once again the
President — or the NSC — has made

fools out of them" by circumventing
congressional authority, he said.
A congressional investigation seems
imminent; some Republicans and
Democrats have already called for the
appointment of a special prosecutor to
determine whether the administration
has broken the law. "Congress is going
to have a field day," said Moe, adding
that the president may invoke execu
tive privilege if Congress tries to call
officials like North and Poindexter to
appear under oath. The crisis will oc
cupy much of Congress' time in the
coming month, Moe said.
Congressional Republicans and
Democrats alike are "afraid of damag
ing the presidency and Reagan," said
George, adding that in any investiga
tion the president also has his
"enormous popularity going for him."
The actions of the NSC have violated
the intent of Congress, Marshall said.
"It was never pan of congressional in
tent that (the NSC) be an operating
agency," Marshall said. The council
was formed to be "a planning, thinking
and coordinating agency," he said.
Reagan has already said he will name a
commission to examine the role of his
NSC staff, which directed the Iranian
operation. The president has also
pledged to return control of Iranian
foreign policy to the State Department.
Republicans in Congress have been
"worried that a scandal would break
out at the highest levels" through the
"arrogance" of the Reagan administra
tion, George said.
George and Marshall stressed that to
understand the current crisis, one
must consider an entire chain of

related events — from earlier sales of
arms to Iran by Israel to the recent
downing of a CIA-linked plane carrying
arms to the contras. Political Science
Prof. Gary Jacobson said repeated dis
closures have added "lots of fuel to the
fire."
"The public wants a certain amount
of restraint in our foreign policy,' said
Marshall.
The experts had some early predic
tions on results of the current contro
versy. "Anything Reagan does will be
subject to greater scrutiny," Marshall
said. In the past, congressmen have
tried to cooperate with Reagan in or
der to please their constituents, he
said. "Now the burden of proof will be
on Reagan's side" and Congress will be
more skeptical when making deci
sions, according to Marshall.
The crisis also could have some ef
fect on the political career of Vice
President George Bush, a 1988 presi
dential candidate. "For all we know
he's up to his neck" in the affair, said
Moe. On the other hand, "maybe there
isn't anything there," he added.
George noted that Bush is the presi
dent's chief of crisis management, yet
has been conspicuously absent from
the crisis. "There is a possibility that it
could ruin him," he added.
