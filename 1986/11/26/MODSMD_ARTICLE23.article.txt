## Stanford frosh sees red after Cal mistreatment 
### JAMES SPENCER 
Stanford football players weren't the
only wearers of Cardinal who got pum
meled at this weekend's Big Game in
UC-Berkeley's Memorial Stadium.
Marty Walsh, a naive Stanford fresh
man from Sioux City, Iowa, left the
safety of the Stanford student section
before game time to look for an
"acquaintance" in the Cal student sec
tion.
Minutes later, he was abducted by
the Cal fans and tossed up through the
stands, to the horror of disbelieving
Stanford fans.
"I figured that my friend would be
able to see me since 1 was wearing red
I didn't want to start any trouble," said
Walsh. "1 took off my Stanford sweat
shirt and put it around my waist, but 1
was still wearing a red shirt under
neath."
Upon reaching the Cal student sec
tion, Walsh found himself surrounded
by a horde of Berkeley students chant
ing their magical mantra,"Take off that
red shirt!"
Faced with this horrible fate, Walsh
did what any other good Stanford man
would have done in the same situation:
He held up his Stanford sweatshirt to
the Cal card section and put it on.
The Golden Bear fans then

proceeded to throw oranges, eggs and
full cans of beer at Walsh. Walsh at
tempted to flee the barrage, but the Cal
fans swarmed him as he was walking
away. They picked him up, then passed
him bodily to the top of the stands by
hand.
"It was kind of fun at first, but then
they started hitting me and trying to
take off my shin as I was going up. In
general, it was pretty lame," said
Walsh.
"It was really scary — I was totally
outnumbered," he continued. "And I

couldn't believe the things they were
throwing. I thought to myself, 'No self
respecting person would throw those
things. Then I understood — I was
dealing with Weenies.'"
Walsh's red shirt was visible to the
Stanford student section, which voiced
its intense collective disapproval.
Senior Ruby Lim equated Cal's be
havior with that of the outlawed Delta
Upsilon fraternity last spring. "My first
reaction was Why?'" said Lim. "It's
very insensitive. It's like throwing a
burning couch off of a third-story bal
cony."
Another spectator said of Walsh,
"What an idiot!"
However, the general reaction was
one of horror. Sophomore Linda Fong,
a resident with Walsh in Mirlo House,
was heard yelling to Mirlo resident as
sistant Bob Barcklay, "You're the RA;
do something!"
After first taking off every piece of
red clothing that he was wearing,
Barcklay ran to Walsh's aid. However,
the incident was over by the time he
arrived.
"He was in shock when I arrived,"
Barckley said. "I tried to comfort him
and told him he was stupid for going
over in the first place. Then again, the
same thing happened to me last year."
Walsh was visibly shaken up after the
incident, in which he was dropped
twice. "I couldn't believe how mean
they were. It just goes to show that they
are all Stanford wanna-be's."
Walsh is determined to look at the
bright side of the incident, though, and
was last heard musing, "I wonder if
there's any way I could sue the entire
Cal student body?"
