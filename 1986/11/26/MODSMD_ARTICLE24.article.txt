Dear Bug Me,
Could you tell me some statistical
data about the Nobel Prize? How
many people altogether have been
awarded the prize? Of those, how
many are U.S. scientists and how
many are Stanford faculty? Harvard
ranks first in the number of prize
winners. What's the rank of Stan
ford?
— Linus Pauling
By my count, 569 Nobel Prizes
have been awarded to date. That
number includes both multiple
prizes awarded in a single discipline
in a given year and awards given to
organizations.
Alfred Nobel, the inventor of
dynamite, left a legacy of $9 million
to reward efforts toward peace and
progress. He did this because he was
distressed that he had created an in
strument of destruction. In the final
analysis, trains and bridges have
largely been the victims of his dis
covery.
The prizes in chemistry, medicine,
literature, peace and physics were
first awarded in 1901. The Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economics was
endowed in 1968 by the Central
Bank of Sweden to celebrate its
300 th anniversary.
This year's prize of $270,000 (tax
free in most countries) for each dis
cipline will be presented Dec. 10 —
the anniversary of Nobel's death.
According to the Reader's Digest
Almanac, 191 Americans have won
the prize. This ranks first in the
world, followed by the England, Ger
many and France. The Soviet Union
ranks fifth.
It is difficult to classify prizes by
countries or academic institutions
because many prize-winners have
been of dual or questionable citizen
ship and have been associated with
many universities. The Nobel Foun
dation Handbook lists nine laureates
who had Stanford affiliation when
they won. However, one of this year's
winners was a Stanford graduate and
another is a consulting professor.
Where does one draw the line?
Officially, Stanford claims 9
laureates on the Academic Council at
present. Four of those are emeritus
professors, and not all won their
prizes while at Stanford. The Hoover
Institution claims four laureates as
sociated with it.

Ray Colvig, UC-Berkeley's public
information officer, claims his insti
tution has 15 laureates historically (I
only counted 10, but what's a few
Nobels among friends?) and 12 who
are presently on the faculty.
Earlier in the year, the Berkeley
alumni association, soliciting dona
tions, ran an advertisement that
eventually appeared in Time and
Newsweek, claiming "Berkeley
threatens Russia." It seems that
before this year the Soviet Union as a
whole had garnered just one more
Nobel than the Berkeley faculty. But
Berkeley pulled in another prize this
year, so its window of vulnerability
in the Nobel race is now shut.
Certainly Harvard ranks first, fol-

lowed by Stanford, UC-Berkeley, Cal
ifornia Institute of Technology, the
University of Chicago and Massachu
setts Institute of Technology, not
necessarily in that order.
Just in case you were wondering
what my opinion of all this is, I think
the prize is too politicized and that
universities should not be
repositories of aging academicians,
but rather centers of current learn
ing and research.
Dear Bug Me
Why is Cubberly Auditorium
purple? I mean, I like it and every
thing, but I'm fust curious.
— Alice Walker
At the time that Cubberly was
remodeled, the Concert Network
had hopes of bringing singer Prince
to Stanford for a concert and per
haps to shoot a portion of his
"Purple Rain" video in the
auditorium. According to University
President Donald Kennedy, the
shades of purple chosen were
thought to highlight Apollonia's
eyes.
I don't know whether or not Don
listens to Prince, but I thought that

answer was more interesting than
the real one.
Sue Crawford, the facilities
manager for the School of Educa
tion, said the color of Cubberly's
walls was a design decision made by
a remodeling committee. The color
purple simply matched the curtains
and seat covers that it had chosen.
The remodeling, completed in the
summer of 1983, changed the shape
of the auditorium, making it nar
rower in the front, enlarged the
stage and improved the lighting, bal
cony and handicapped access.
The projection screen was im
proved, as was the sound system.
You'll be pleased to know that when
Stephen Krasner lectures in Poli. Sci.
35, he does it in three-track Dolby
sound.
Dear Bug Me,
I have coffee and yogurtfor break
fast every morning. Someone
recently told me that coffee interferes
with the body's ability to absorb the
calcium in the yogurt. Is this true?
Does coffee interfere with the utiliza
tion of any foods?
— Coffee Achiever
First of all, if all you're eating is
coffee and yogurt, you should alter
your eating habits and get a more
balanced diet.
If you are eating well the rest of
the day, the word from the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bet
hesda, Maryland, is "don't be con
cerned."
Dr. Van Hubbard, director of the
Nutritional Sciences Program at the
NIH, says that three to five cups of
coffee a day and normal diet pose no
threat to health. Drink more than
five cups and "nobody is sure."
Although there is no hard data
linking the caffeine in coffee to the
malabsorption of calcium or other
nutrients, Dr. Charles Pak of the Uni
versity of Texas, who has conducted
some calcium absorption studies,
says it is "theoretically possible."
Pak warns that caffeine increases
the transit of nutrients through the
digestive system and that the kidneys
may "leak" calcium through the
urine. This could endanger the
maintenance of bone tissue and pos
sibly destroy it.
The malabsorption of other
nutrients might also be possible with
the excessive drinking of coffee. Pak
suggests no more than three cups of
coffee a day.
