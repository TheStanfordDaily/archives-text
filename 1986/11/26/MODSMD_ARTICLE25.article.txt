## Gaieties '86 better than most 
### JAMES KOSIC 
Uncertainty is an integral part of
watching any Stanford football game.
Only rarely is one able to relax in the
fourth quarter, assured of victory. Two
years ago, Washington State destroyed
any Stanford fan's hope of ever being
complacent, no matter what the lead.
This past weekend simply reinforced
this anxiety.
Big Game Gaieties is the exact oppo
site. Gaieties thrives on a repetition of
Stanford-stereotype jokes year after
year after year. Stern food is consis
tently slammed in every production.
Resident assistants are always pictured
as effervescent activity maniacs. Once a
few Gaieties are seen in a row, in
memory they all begin to blend into an
indistinguishable mass. Each show has
its successes and failures, but from
year to year they tend to vary little in
overall quality. They tend rather to set
tle into a grey middle area and blur
into one another.
The start of this year's program
seemed to indicate that a generally
poorer performance than usual was in
the works. The overture was discon
nected, uninspiring and not very enjoy
able. The introduction of the storyline
tended (as usual) to be drawn out a bit
too much, and the first songs were
similarly a little too slow and lengthy.
Stanford 2086, it seems, is a dull, me
thodical and spiritless school. Janet
(Brooke Ramel), a student of the
future, decides to return to 1986 to dis
cover what happened to Stanford spirit
and attempt to recover it (a very real

concern for Axe Committee Chairman
Michael Tuchin already). All in all, the
plot seemed to differ little from such
past greats as returning the Stanford
family ghosts to the Mausoleum or
catching the malevolent fiend spraying
apathy gas on the students.
Oncejanet returns to 1986, the show
began to improve. What followed was
the traditional recap of Stanford life
and its foibles. Though hardly novel,
this show's descent into topical humor
was better than most, having been
facilitated by two important develop
ments.
The first was the self-deprecatory
humor, which was stronger in this
show than ever before. Janet's knowing
asides to the audience concerning the
hokiness of the plot developments
made it clear that the plot was clearly
of secondary importance here, buried
under a broad parody of Stanford life.
The goal here is obviously not to rival
the great playwrights of English
literature but rather to imitate the dean
of topical humor, Bob Hope. The best
Hope movies are those where the plot
is of secondary or tertiary importance,
behind the performance and the
delivery of a catchy punchline.
The second difference in this year's
Gaieties was the greater reliance on
imitations of well-known personalities
or songs. The spots in the show that
relied on imitation rather than
originality were generally the most
successful. There was a parody of "The
David Letterman Show," letter perfect
from David Oehler's great impersona
tion down to the final voice-over by a

Hal Gurnee sound-alike. The Woody
Allen and Rod Serling sequences were
also successful. However, the imita
tions of Emily Litella and Pee-Wee Her
man were unfortunately less than in
spiring. The most memorable musical
scene was the takeoff on "Do Re Mi"
from"The Sound of Music," turning
the song into an exhortation for con
traceptives. Much of the scene's humor
derived from imagining Julie Andrews
singing the song to the saccharine Van
Trapp family.
The success of these parodies of es
tablished performers and songs shows
that here the writers don't need to
waste time in establishing a character's
identity, a necessary ingredient in
Shakesperean drama but something
that justs slows down the pace in
Gaieties. Fortunately this year's writers
kept all the main characters delight
fully one-dimensional.
The point of all this is that Gaieties is
funny and entertaining because it is
topical humor, the wittiness of which
derives from an insider's knowledge.
And topical humor by nature is not
daring (again, for example, think of
Bob Hope). Therefore a lack of plot
and an abundance of one-dimensional
characters is not only acceptable but
desirable. Future writers should worry
less about constructing a coherent plot
and concentrate more on writing fun
nier lines. As mentioned earlier, after
experiencing a few Gaieities one
ceases to remember particular shows,
only particular parts from all the
shows. The best, most memorable
scene from this year's show came

when a pompous Western Culture pro
fessor (Doug Heise) dictated a pop
quiz: "Spell Nietzsche .. . spell
Kierkegaard ... you have one hour."
Finally, I'd like to point out the over
whelming popularity of one tradition,
the appearance of the president and/or
the dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions. I won't comment on the Dean
Jean years (her delivery is good, but
her following has yet to develop), but I

remember how the Dean Fred Gaieties
were marked by nervous anticipation
for that moment when Dean Fred
would be lowered from the ceiling on
a swing or drive onstage in a golf cart.
This one small tradition has become a
focal point of the whole production.
My final point is actually a specific
recommendation for future Gaieties
producers. Generally, the periods be
tween scenes when the lights go down

are incredibly dull, ruining the tone of
the show. Four years ago, television
theme songs, the folk songs of our gen
eration, were played between each
scene. The response was overwhelm
ing as the crowd sang along to
"Gilligan's Island," "The Brady
Bunch," "Green Acres" and "All In the
Family." What are often the show's
worst moments became the most
memorable part of that year's Gaieties.

Anything can happen in Gaieties, and it does. This year, "Norm Robinson" (Brendan Kelly) appeared as Kool-Aid,
providing some relief for hot and thirsty Stanford students.
