# Another view: of once and future Gaieties
## 
### DAVE CASSELL 
Gaieties is like a pre-game show to the Big
Game rally in San Francisco. In fact, Gaieties
is all part of the Big Game Week experience,
with the Thursday night bonfire, the rally in
the city and of course the game itself. We lost
Big Game. And now I'm supposed to review
Gaieties; I'd rather review the football team's
offensive line. The question arises, is Gaieties
a failure if the football team doesn't win Big
Game? Of course not. I just wanted to bring
that up so I could talk about Big Game.
Let's try a new approach: Write your own
review. Wait about four days after Gaieties,
and then see how much of it you remember.
It'll probably be the funniest or most insight
ful jokes and the most coherent perfor
mances. You'll probably also remember the
strong reactions you had to any serious flaws.
It seems almost cruel even to offer a
criticism of what to most students is just an
other spirit-related activity. But here's what I
remember from this year's Gaieties: a too
cutesy freshman couple, two rich old Stanford
alumni (Hewlett and Packard) trying to do the
high five and that great David Letterman im
personation. I was also really glad to see the
reprisal of the moronic Berkeley goons. For
those of you who missed it, the plot was about
a girl from Stanford in 2086 who visits Stan
ford in 1986.
One of the great things about Gaieties is
that you expect it to have an anything-but-the
kitchen-sink structure. Half the fun is that in
Gaieties, and nowhere else, you can expect to
see things you recognize but thought no one
else would ever share with you, let alone
make jokes out of. Like resident assistants
who exhort you to go square dancing and
how tough it is to spell Kierkegaard, how
hokey Gaieties endings are. These things are
what make Gaieties fun.
And the most interesting thing about
Gaieties over the years is to see just how the

Stanford experience is conveyed each time
around. You have to go to several productions
before you realize they're all very similar.
This year's show, however, was a bit more
freshman dorm-oriented: Western Culture
jokes, the freshman couple, the freshman
dorm RA, and so on.
With this kind of catch-all show, it's hard to
bring the story to a payoff. I think a throw
away ending is the only possible ending a
Gaieties can have. I wonder, what's the point
of even having a plot at all, whether it be a
love story or a mystery to be solved?

One of the great things
about Gaieties is that
you expect it to have
an anything-but-the
kitchen-sink structure.

Looking back on Stanford from the year
2086 seemed like a promising idea. The prob
lem, though, is that after all the guaranteed
laughs of the First scene are over (as when
future people see Big Game Week as a mass
orgy), the premise doesn't hold up well. As in
"Mork and Mindy" or "Alf," you've got the
tried-and-true premise of an alien outsider's
look at what we take for granted. But the
problem here is that what this outsider Oanet
from 2086) looks at seems only to per
ipherally reflect Stanford life. It bore a
resemblance to those sullen days when it
seemed that no matter where you went, the

real glamour and excitement of the Stanford
experience was happening somewhere else,
and it was too bad you had to be where you
were. Thus we went to a Stern dorm meal, an
RA's room, a Western Culture section, the post
office and a contraceptive lecture; nothing
very dramatic. Kind of like showing your par
ents around campus.
Donald Kennedy's role seemed a little
weak this year. "Jean ... you're fired," he said.
I don't think any display of animosity is appro
priate for the Kennedy we all know and love.
Maybe this was the joke, meeting a freshman
so dorky that even Kennedy would get mad
and fire Dean Jean. But the great thing about
Kennedy in Gaieties is that he automatically
produces a wholly satisfying climax to a
scene; just by being Kennedy, he elevates his
scene above any fabricated plot situation. All
you have to do is put him on stage at an unex
pected moment. To do anything more is like
casting Bob Denver as Othello.
The opening number of this year's Gaieties
was titled "Every Week is Dead Week at Stan
ford." The choreography was terrific, but for
me, the title recalls a line from an earlier
Gaieties: "Every week is mid-terms week at
Stanford." The second is funnier; it draws
more on an insider's Stanford experiences,
instead of being connected to an almost su
perfluous atmosphere piece.
Also, making references to previous
Gaieties during the show is a great shtick, but
perhaps it's also a sign of the times. If we
really do have a form so well-known it can
now be satirized, then isn't that form dead?
And if so, where does that leave us for future
Gaieties?
But the answer is, let's face it, this is just
petty carping, because how could the Gaieties
ever miss? Even if it isn't funny consistently
(for, say, six years in a row), it can never die.
So having said that, was this year's Gaieties
any good? Well, from where I stand, I've got to
say ... hell, yeah!

In a go-for-broke production like Gaieties, good taste is usually the first thing to get thrown out
the window. Above: a scene from "Contraception," a takeoff on "Do Re Mi" from"The Sound
of Music." Can you imagine Julie Andrews singing this?
