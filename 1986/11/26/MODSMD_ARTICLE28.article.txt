## Card seeks culture and a win in Japan 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
For the second consecutive week, the Stanford
Cardinal will play a Pacific 10 Conference op
ponent outside the United States. Last week, the
Cardinal visited the Twilight Zone, located some
where in Berkeley's Strawberry Canyon, to play
the 89th Big Game against California. The 2-9
Bears pulled the biggest upset in Big Game his
tory, defeating the 7-3 Cardinal 17-11 in Coach Joe
Kapp's final game.
This week the Cardinal visits a more earthly,
but more foreign, land —Japan. Saturday's game
against Arizona was moved from Tucson to Tokyo
and is now the Coca-Cola Bowl, played in Olym
pic Stadium, the site of the 1964 Olympic Games.
"They'll have the opportunity to see the sights
and take in Tokyo," Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said. "We'll take that into consideration. We also
have a plan scheduled to take away the impact of
jet lag." That plan has the Cardinal arising one
morning at 4 a.m. to adjust to the 17-hour time
difference.
"We aren't going over there to lock them in
their rooms," Elway said. "They should experi
ence Tokyo, and we've got some tours set up for
them to see it. On the other hand, we have a cur
few. We have to remember to prepare for the
football game. I want to have both. 1 want the
team to be good ambassadors. 1 want them to en
joy themselves, but have respect for the culture
they're in."
Elway's hopes for himself were a bit simpler.
"Do any of you know how to say vodka in
Japanese?" he quipped.
Linebacker Barry McKeever wasn't thinking
about where the game was being played, just
whom it was being played against. "The bottom
line is we're going there to win the game. We're
playing Arizona — one of the toughest teams in
the Pac-10. Obviously, we want to take in the cul
ture, but we want to win the football game."
Arizona is certainly looking like one of the
toughest teams in the conference after the
Wildcats handed league champion Arizona State
its first defeat, 34-17, last week in Tucson. Arizona
is now 8-2 overall, 5-2 in the Pac-10, and in
second place.

"I'm never surprised with what happens,''
Arizona Coach Larry Smith said of the No. 12
Wildcats upset of the then-No. 4 Sun Devils.
Despite Stanford's embarassing loss at Cal,
Smith still respects the 7-3 Cardinal. "We have to
be solid," he said. "That's the whole key. Stan
ford's a solid football team. They didn't turn the
ball over even against Cal."
The game will feature the two top running
backs in the Pac-10. Arizona's David Adams, while
only 5-foot-6 and 167 pounds, is tops in the con
ference with 1,126 yards. Stanford's Brad Muster
is second with 945 yards and on Monday was
named the conference Offensive Player of the
Year.
Muster, however, suffered a contusion just
above his right knee against Cal, and it is not yet
known how badly it will affect him Saturday.
Stanford quarterback John Paye is also hurting
with a seriously sore shoulder that was expected
to cause him to miss some practice time this
week. "John Paye is fine" is all Elway would say
about the senior signal-caller.
Wide receiver Thomas Henley suffered a hy
perextended elbow against Cal, and he is ques
tionable for Saturday. Henley will make the trip,
though.
Muster ran for only 59 yards in the loss to Cal,
and when seven sacks of Paye were figured in, the
Cardinal finished with only 41 yards on the
ground. Stanford is 7-0 in games in which Muster
rushed for over 60 yards and 0-3 in games where
he had less than 60.
"They've taken away the running game all
year," Elway said of Arizona. "What they 11 try to
do is take away the running game early and force
us to pass because we have to."
The Wildcat defense is allowing only 81 yards
per game rushing.
The Cardinal practiced here yesterday and
Monday, though Elway said the practices would
not be physical. The team leaves for Tokyo today,
arriving tomorrow afternoon with the time
change. It will practice Friday and Saturday in
Tokyo, with the game scheduled for 1 p.m. Sun
day, Japan Standard Time.
The game will be televised by the ESPN cable
network Saturday at 8 p.m. PST. KCBS (740 AM)
and KZSU (90.1 FM) will carry the game on radio.


Strong safety Brad Humphreys, whose second-quarter intercep
tion set up a Stanford field goal, provided one of the Cardinal's
few big plays in its Big Game loss to California. Stanford will be

looking to break up Arizona's chances of a second-place Pacific 10
Conference finish on Saturday at the Coca-Cola Bowl in Tokyo,
Japan.
