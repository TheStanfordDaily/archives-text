# Stanford heavily favored at NCAAs
## Card needs three wins for perfect season 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
With the regular season over and
done with, the 33-0, top-ranked Stan
ford men's water polo team enters the
NCAA Championships this weekend at
the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach
with an opportunity to join the 1981
Cardinal as the only teams in history to
go through an undefeated season and
win back-to-back titles.
"It (NCAAs) is a chance for this team
to go down in history as one of the
greatest teams in the NCAAs," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "A lot of
teams have won NCAA Championships,
but only the great teams win back-to
back championships."
The Cardinal, by virtue of being
named the No. 1 tournament seed, will
face No. 8 seed and Midwest Region
champion Air Force at 3 p.m. Friday.
The Falcons come into the NCAAs with
a 6-16 record.
On Saturday, Stanford will take on
the winner of the game between
fourth-seeded Pepperdine and No. 5
seed USC at 6 p.m. If all goes according
to schedule, the Cardinal will play in
the final game Sunday at 7:30 p.m.
In the other side of the draw, No. 2
seed California will face No. 7 Brown
in the first round, with third-seeded
UCLA going against sixth-seeded Navy.

water polo championships in Long Beach. One of the primary reasons for the Cardinal's dominance has been junior
Erich Fischer, who leads the team with 81 goals.
