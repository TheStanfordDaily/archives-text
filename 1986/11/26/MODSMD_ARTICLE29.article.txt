# Stanford heavily favored at NCAAs
## Card needs three wins for perfect season 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
With the regular season over and
done with, the 33-0, top-ranked Stan
ford men's water polo team enters the
NCAA Championships this weekend at
the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach
with an opportunity to join the 1981
Cardinal as the only teams in history to
go through an undefeated season and
win back-to-back titles.
"It (NCAAs) is a chance for this team
to go down in history as one of the
greatest teams in the NCAAs," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "A lot of
teams have won NCAA Championships,
but only the great teams win back-to
back championships."
The Cardinal, by virtue of being
named the No. 1 tournament seed, will
face No. 8 seed and Midwest Region
champion Air Force at 3 p.m. Friday.
The Falcons come into the NCAAs with
a 6-16 record.
On Saturday, Stanford will take on
the winner of the game between
fourth-seeded Pepperdine and No. 5
seed USC at 6 p.m. If all goes according
to schedule, the Cardinal will play in
the final game Sunday at 7:30 p.m.
In the other side of the draw, No. 2
seed California will face No. 7 Brown
in the first round, with third-seeded

Because of its 33-0 record and No. 1 national ranking, Stanford is the prohibitive favorite at this weekend's NCAA
water polo championships in Long Beach. One of the primary reasons for the Cardinal's dominance has been junior
Erich Fischer, who leads the team with 81 goals.
be its sixth NCAA Championship since
the tournament's inception in 1969,
tying the Cardinal with California for
the most titles by one school.
The Cardinal currently holds the
NCAA record for consecutive wins with
42.
After finishing last year with nine
straight victories and an NCAA title,
Stanford has utterly dominated the op
position this season, outscoring its op
ponents 429 to 169. Junior Erich Fis
cher and senior Craig Klass pace the
Cardinal attack, scoring 81 and 77 goals
respectively.
Defensively, led by senior Greg
Gamble and goalies Obi Greenman
and Todd Kemp, Stanford has limited
its opponents to an average of only five
goals per game. While the Cardinal has
averaged 13 goals per game, only Pep
perdine on Sept. 27 scored as many as
10 goals.
It is this combination of Stanford's
ability to score goals in bunches as
well as shut down the opposition that
has several coaches already quaking in
their boots.
"I think it would be very difficult to
beat them (Stanford)," Pepperdine
Coach Terry Schroeder said. "I think
they would have to play a little off their

game to lose."
The Cardinal's dominance has been
so complete this year that only twice
(against Pepperdine Oct. 31 and USC
Nov. 7) has it even fallen behind. In ad
dition, the Cardinal has defeated No. 2
California five times and No. 3 UCLA on
three different occasions.
"Stanford has been dominant all
year long," California Coach Pete
Cutino said. "Even when they have
played poorly, they have managed to
win — that is the sign of a great team."
While the Cardinal has had a
memorable regular season, however,
only the NCAA title could justly cap its
first 33 games. According to Dettamanti
and several Cardinal players, this year's
effort would be all for nought if Stan
ford were denied the NCAA Champion
ship.
"The 33 wins and the Pac-10 Cham
pionship doesn't mean anything unless
we win the NCAAs," Dettamanti said.
"We expect to win the championship.
If we do not win it, we will be very dis
appointed."
"If we lose any of those games
(NCAAs), almost the whole season
would be a failure," said senior Chris
Thompson. "Our goal has been to go
undefeated, but our main objective is
to win the NCAAs. If we did not win, it
would seem like we did not ac
complish what we set out to do."
After three subpar performances
against Pepperdine (Oct. 31), USC

(Nov. 7) and UCLA (Nov. 8), the Card
inal seems to be hitting full stride just
in time for the NCAAs. Last Saturday,
Stanford manhandled Cal 11-6 in
Berkeley.
"Over the last two weeks, we have
regained the intensity that we had ear
lier in the season," senior Greg Ocasek
said. "We are peaking right around the
time Dante (Dettamanti) wants us to —
right before the NCAAs."
Powered by the senior nucleus of
Klass, Gamble, Ocasek, Thompson and
David Imbernino, Stanford's previous
NCAA performances should also pro
vide a strong foundation that might
help carry the team to the title.
"The thing that separates Stanford
from the others right now is tourna
ment experience," UCLA Coach Bob
Horn said. "Tournament play is very
different; it is the definition of experi
ence. I don't think any team has played
together as consistently as Stanford
has. They are well-schooled as a unit."
After winning all 33 regular season
games and recently defeating Cal to en
ter the NCAAs with a win over the na
tion's second-rated team, the Cardinal
is poised for the three games that will
culminate its regular season and bring
it the championship.
"This will be the three most impor
tant games of the season," Imbernino
said. "These are the three games that
most of the guys have been thinking
about all season."

beat them (Stanford)," Pepperdine
Coach Terry Schroeder said. "I think
they would have to play a little off their

game to lose."
The Cardinal's dominance has been
so complete this year that only twice
(against Pepperdine Oct. 31 and USC
Nov. 7) has it even fallen behind. In ad
dition, the Cardinal has defeated No. 2
California five times and No. 3 UCLA on
three different occasions.
"Stanford has been dominant all
year long," California Coach Pete
Cutino said. "Even when they have
played poorly, they have managed to
win — that is the sign of a great team."
While the Cardinal has had a
memorable regular season, however,
only the NCAA title could justly cap its
first 33 games. According to Dettamanti
and several Cardinal players, this year's
effort would be all for nought if Stan
ford were denied the NCAA Champion
ship.
"The 33 wins and the Pac-10 Cham
pionship doesn't mean anything unless
we win the NCAAs," Dettamanti said.
"We expect to win the championship.
If we do not win it, we will be very dis
appointed."
"If we lose any of those games
(NCAAs), almost the whole season
would be a failure," said senior Chris
Thompson. "Our goal has been to go
undefeated, but our main objective is
to win the NCAAs. If we did not win, it
would seem like we did not ac
complish what we set out to do."
After three subpar performances
against Pepperdine (Oct. 31), USC

(Nov. 7) and UCLA (Nov. 8), the Card
inal seems to be hitting full stride just
in time for the NCAAs. Last Saturday,
Stanford manhandled Cal 11-6 in
Berkeley.
"Over the last two weeks, we have
regained the intensity that we had ear
lier in the season," senior Greg Ocasek
said. "We are peaking right around the
time Dante (Dettamanti) wants us to —
right before the NCAAs."
Powered by the senior nucleus of
Klass, Gamble, Ocasek, Thompson and
David Imbernino, Stanford's previous
NCAA performances should also pro
vide a strong foundation that might
help carry the team to the title.
"The thing that separates Stanford
from the others right now is tourna
ment experience," UCLA Coach Bob
Horn said. "Tournament play is very
different; it is the definition of experi
ence. I don't think any team has played
together as consistently as Stanford
has. They are well-schooled as a unit."
After winning all 33 regular season
games and recently defeating Cal to en
ter the NCAAs with a win over the na
tion's second-rated team, the Cardinal
is poised for the three games that will
culminate its regular season and bring
it the championship.
"This will be the three most impor
tant games of the season," Imbernino
said. "These are the three games that
most of the guys have been thinking
about all season."
With the regular season over and
done with, the 33-0, top-ranked Stan
ford men's water polo team enters the
NCAA Championships this weekend at
the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach
with an opportunity to join the 1981
Cardinal as the only teams in history to
go through an undefeated season and
win back-to-back titles.
"It (NCAAs) is a chance for this team
to go down in history as one of the
greatest teams in the NCAAs," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "A lot of
teams have won NCAA Championships,
but only the great teams win back-to
back championships."
The Cardinal, by virtue of being
named the No. 1 tournament seed, will
face No. 8 seed and Midwest Region
champion Air Force at 3 p.m. Friday.
The Falcons come into the NCAAs with
a 6-16 record.
On Saturday, Stanford will take on
the winner of the game between
fourth-seeded Pepperdine and No. 5
seed USC at 6 p.m. If all goes according
to schedule, the Cardinal will play in
the final game Sunday at 7:30 p.m.
In the other side of the draw, No. 2
seed California will face No. 7 Brown
in the first round, with third-seeded
UCLA going against sixth-seeded Navy.

Because of its 33-0 record and No. 1 national ranking, Stanford is the prohibitive favorite at this weekend's NCAA
water polo championships in Long Beach. One of the primary reasons for the Cardinal's dominance has been junior
Erich Fischer, who leads the team with 81 goals.
be its sixth NCAA Championship since
the tournament's inception in 1969,
tying the Cardinal with California for
the most titles by one school.
The Cardinal currently holds the
NCAA record for consecutive wins with
42.
After finishing last year with nine
straight victories and an NCAA title,
Stanford has utterly dominated the op
position this season, outscoring its op
ponents 429 to 169. Junior Erich Fis
cher and senior Craig Klass pace the
Cardinal attack, scoring 81 and 77 goals
respectively.
Defensively, led by senior Greg
Gamble and goalies Obi Greenman
and Todd Kemp, Stanford has limited
its opponents to an average of only five
goals per game. While the Cardinal has
averaged 13 goals per game, only Pep
perdine on Sept. 27 scored as many as
10 goals.
It is this combination of Stanford's
ability to score goals in bunches as
well as shut down the opposition that
has several coaches already quaking in
their boots.

beat them (Stanford)," Pepperdine
Coach Terry Schroeder said. "I think
