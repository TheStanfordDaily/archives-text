# Prof.: More may come

### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
The attempt by top Reagan adminis
tration officials to separate themselves
from the Iranian arms deals suggests
that much more may still be revealed
in the present crisis, History Prof. Bar
ton Bernstein said in a speech in
Florence Moore Hall's main lounge
yesterday.
"Rather than rallying around the
president, (administration officials) are
scampering away," Bernstein said.
"Somebody has a document or close to
a document," Bernstein told a gather
ing of about 75 people.
High level investigators could also
have obtained commitments from
knowledgeable administration sources
to testify on the record, he said.
Since the arms deal was uncovered,
Secretary of State George Shultz has
successively said he knew nothing,
knew almost nothing, and then he
claimed he argued against the sales,
Bernstein said.
U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese
also "protected himself' in news con
ferences, Bernstein said. This is a sig
nificant development because Meese
has been the most loyal attorney gen
eral since Bobby Kennedy, he said.
In reference to claims of ignorance
among administration officials,
Bernstein said it is "incredible, if not
unbelievable" that top officials were
uninformed about "the details" of the
arms deals. They might not have
known the name of the ships or the
hour at which they docked, but they
knew the general plan, he said.
Bernstein expressed doubts,
however, that evidence will be found.
"Since Watergate, administrations have

learned to shred quickly," he said.
Commenting on the origins of the
crisis, Bernstein said that the specific
involvement of Iran and recent na
tional elections made the issue into a
crisis.
The outrage over the sales of arms to
Iran partly originates from Iran's sym
bolic role in recent presidential
politics, he said.
During his 1980 campaign, Reagan
emphasized President Carter's
"lackluster, unsuccessful, and vacillat
ing policies" toward Iran in the
hostage crisis, Bernstein said.
Reagan's campaign rhetoric on Iran
made that country a symbol of ter
rorism for Americans. If arms had been
sent to another Middle Eastern
country, the issue would not have
resonated in such a negative fashion,
Bernstein said.
The Democratic resurgence in
recent U.S. elections also encouraged
members of Congress and the press to
take on the president, he said.
