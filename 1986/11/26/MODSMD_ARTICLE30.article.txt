# Spikers conclude regular season by beating Cal-Poly
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
After last night's volleyball match,
for the first time in a while, the
coach from each side of the net ap
plauded the play of both his team
and its opponent. This fall's pattern
of one team making a subpar per
formance and giving away the
match was broken last night, as the
Cardinal defeated Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo in a display of unrelenting
offense versus unrelenting defense.
A nerve-racking Maples Pavilion
contest of streaks saw a total of 25
game points saved by side outs, as
the No. 11 Cardinal sweated out its
regular season finale 15-7, 12-15,
15-8, and 15-11. Its record stands at
21-9 overall and 16-2 in the Pacific
10 Conference. The No. 12 Mus
tangs finish their regular schedule
at 22-14 overall, 10-9 in Pacific Coast
Athletic Association play.
In the two teams' last meeting,
Cal Poly welcomed a road-weary
Stanford into a packed gvm and
won a match of ups and downs in
five games, as evidenced by the fact
that the Cardinal won its two games
by the score of 15-4. Mustang Asst.
Coach Craig Cummings said the
main difference between that match
and last night's was something that
Stanford did not do this time
around: "They didn't just get out of
a van after three and a half hours on

the road," he said.
Cal Poly has a better travel agent
than the Cardinal, though, and
came into Stanford Monday night,
making this match a truer test of
volleyball talent. The Mustangs
didn't lose a lot in the crowd sup
port area either, as the Cardinal
crowd was easily drowned out by a
group of Cal Poly Sigma Nu frater
nity members who had hiked up
the coast as a fund-raiser, proving
that Mustang volleyball fans are
serious and fit, if a little overeager.
Each game had enough elements
to qualify as matches in themselves,
and, according to Stanford Coach
Don Shaw, there were more fre
quent and longer rallies than in any
other match Stanford has played
this season.
The first game saw the host jump
out to a 9-1 lead before the visitor
got it together and came back to 10-
6, benefitting from three straight
Cardinal service errors. When Stan
ford reached 14, Cal Poly stood fast,
saving six game points before fi
nally letting go.
Stanford again had the early lead,
6-3, in the second game, when the
Mustangs ran off 10 straight points.
After fighting back to 13-10 and
then managing five side outs with
the game on the line and with
players sprawled all over the floor,
