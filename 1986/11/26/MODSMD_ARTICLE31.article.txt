# One tough opener
## Stanford faces No. 6 Georgia Tech in Richmond 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
< When a school decides to host a
. four-team basketball tournament, it of
ten follows three basic guidelines.
- First, it brings in a drawing card, a
.national power to put people in the
seats.
Second, it makes sure to find a fairly
; weak team to take on in the first round,
ensuring that the home team will get a
shot at the headliner in the final game.
And third, it invites another team,
matches it up with the headliner, and
says, "Thanks for coming. Have fun in
the consolation game."
Because Richmond traveled to Stan
ford last year to be the drawing card at
the Cardinal's Apple Invitational, Stan
ford is headed East this season to be
the "other" team in Richmond's
Central Fidelity Invitational. The Card
inal meets sixth-ranked Georgia Tech
in Friday's first round, while Richmond
draws Southwest Conference doormat
Rice.
Friday's game will be the regular
season opener for Stanford, and it may
be the Cardinal's toughest game of the
year. "It's a good challenge," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"'They're a top-10, nationally
prominent team. They've got great
.players our guys know about, like
XBruce) Dalrymple, (Tom) Hammonds
and (Duane) Ferrell."
Those three are definitely
; noteworthy. They are the key returning
•players on a team that made the final
16 of the 1985-86 NCAA tournament.
They are also the last three recipients
•of the Atlantic Coast Conference
!Rookie-of-the-Year award.
; Ferrell, a junior, and sophomore
Hammonds are 6-foot-7 forwards who
"averaged 12.2 points per game last
year, but their games are very dis
similar. Ferrell is a smooth shooter
who can also take it to the hoop, while
Hammonds is a ferocious inside
.player. With Hammonds, 7-0 center An
toine Ford and Dalrymple, one of the
nation's best rebounding guards, the
'Yellowjackets may make a clean sweep
•of the glass.
! "Rebounding is a concern to me
Tight now," Montgomery said.
"Georgia Tech can really get on the
'boards."

Georgia Tech can get on the boards,
but it cannot go to the bench. Only
seven Yellowjackets saw significant
playing time last year, and five of them
are starting this season. The other two,
All-American guard Mark Price and
first-round draft choice John Salley, are
in the NBA.

So if Cardinal big men Howard
Wright, Greg Butler and Eric Reveno
can get the Georgia Tech frontline in
foul trouble, forcing Coach Bobby
Cremins to go to his suspect bench,
Stanford may give the Richmond
tournament organizers something they
didn't count on — a cliffhanger.

Stanford will need a strong performance from backup center Eric Reveno
Friday if it is to cope with the powerful inside game of Georgia Tech.
