# Cardinal women will begin promising season at UNLV

Invariably, it's a thin line that separates the truly domi
nant teams from the merely competitive ones.
As the Stanford women's basketball team approaches
the stan of the 1986-87 season, Coach Tara VanDerveer is
unsure whether the Cardinal, although improved over
last year, has crossed the line.
"Overall we've reached a higher caliber of play," Van-
Derveer said. "But we're a very young team, so we lack
the experience and, sometimes, the consistent intensity
we need.''
Like last year's squad, the 1986-87 Cardinal is laden
with youth and relative inexperience — underclassmen
occupy five of the top eight playing spots — but with
four of five starters returning, including sophomores Jill
Yanke (13 points per game, 6.8 rebounds) and Evon As
foris (9.1 points, 8.4 rebounds a game), Stanford has
gained some valuable team cohesiveness

"Jill and Evon are playing much better together," Van-
Derveer said. "The leap between freshman and sopho
more year is a big one; it's when you've found out what
collegiate basketball is all about."
Along with the sophomore twin towers, the Cardinal
returns defensive stalwart Erica Mueser for this year's
campaign. Stanford will look to the 5-foot-6 senior for
leadership in an area that has hurt the Cardinal in the
past.
"The major reasons why we lost games last year were
in the areas of rebounding and team defense," VanDer
veer said. "We've made good progress in these areas, but
at this level you're constantly looking for ways to im
prove."
The UNLV/7-UP Invitational this weekend in Las Vegas,
Nev., will provide Stanford with its first test of the season.
The Cardinal will face Cleveland State and the Lady
Rebels of UNLV, a team hungry to avenge a 62-59 loss at
the hands of an upstart Stanford team last year.
