# Author addresses arms race

### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
Author Paul Loeb stressed individual
choices and local community organiza
tion as important responses to the nu
clear threat in a speech last night at
Kresge Auditorium.
Loeb said he was trying to look at the
arms race from a personal perspective.
What does it mean to us? What are our
responsibilities?" he asked.
Loeb said he found the presence of
ordinary, genial workers at the Han
ford Nuclear Reservation a "metaphor
for a common situation and a common
denial." Loeb completed two years of
research at the reservation which led
to his book, "Nuclear Culture."
He said workers looked on their
jobs as a technical challenge to make
machines work as well as possible.
"The question of that machine's use
and consequences is left to someone
else," he said.
He used the phrase "the men who
know best" to describe the attitude of
many workers that politicians should
make the decisions regarding the use

of nuclear energy.
"Somehow (the worker is able to)
separate his perception of the world
and his actions," he said, adding that
many of the workers at nuclear plants
are concerned about the possibility of
nuclear war.
Loeb spoke about similar mecha
nisms used by society to distance itself
from the horrors of nuclear destruc
tion: "cynicism and learned helpless
ness."
We are taught that "ordinary citizens
... have no right to deal in these affairs
because they are too complex, the
stakes are too high," he said.
"(People) do not belive they are
creating a holocaust, but preventing
one," said Loeb. They consider nuclear
war to be unthinkable, he added
But history has shown that "we are
indeed capable of that kind of violence
toward fellow human beings," he said.
"The ultimate evil in our time
doesn't have to do with a mad,
deranged killer or even a mad,
deranged leader," but rather with soci
ety's passive acceptance of its lack of
choice in nuclear matters, Loeb said.

Loeb said he investigated "how ordi
nary people could begin to take these
(nuclear) issues on" in his latest book
"Hope in Hard Times."
He said he was impressed with the
depth and breadth of the disarmament
movement, noting that it is not just a
movement of the young, but a
response to a universal threat.
People involved in the movements
are most concerned with "our right to
toy with that kind of annihilation," he
said. They realize that this country is
"not just the America of Meeses and
Reagans."
One example of changes that such
groups have brought about are the
programs to implement nuclear issues
in the education of children, said Loeb.
He also spoke about President
Nixon's admission in his memoirs that
a massive march in Washington
stopped him from threatening to use
nuclear weapons in Vietnam.
"Somehow the actions we take
rebound in ways we don't always see at
the time," he said.
"It is important to understand his
tory as a flow of forces."
