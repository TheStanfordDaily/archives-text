The recent scandal on Wall Street will probably create
legislation to curb insider trading, takeover bids and
mergers, according to experts here.
The government's crackdown on the insider trading
networks centered on stock speculator Ivan Boesky and
Dennis Levine, a former investment banker with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., has caused a stir on Wall Street.
Insider trading has always been an issue, but the
Boesky case has caused controversy because the crimes
were so blatant and so much money was involved, said
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin.
On Nov. 14, the Securities and Exchange Commission
announced that Boesky had agreed to forfeit $50 million
in illegal insider trading profits, pay a $50 million penalty
and plead guilty to an unspecified criminal charge.
The SEC said Boesky agreed to pay Levine $2.4 million
for a series of leaks about upcoming takeovers and major
corporate actions that Levine learned of from Drexel's
clients or other Wall Street sources. Boesky's use of this
confidential information to buy and sell securities vio
lated federal laws against insider trading.
"People are also nervous because Boesky has turned
state's evidence. They are nervous they may be fingered
by Boesky," Boskin said.

Legislation from Congress will be implemented to
curb insider trading, he said.
"Legislation will certainly attempt to stop insider
trading, but it is unclear whether any legislation will
really improve matters," Boskin said.
This scandal will also affect business on Wall Street, ac
cording to Boskin.
"People will now be more circumspect on how they
do business," he said.
Economics Prof. Ronald McKinnon said, Attempts to
anticipate mergers will lessen.... People will not give up
information as readily.
The article about the Boesky case in the Dec. 1 issue of
Businessweek states that this scandal is the worst crisis
on Wall Street since the 19205, but both Boskin and Mc-
Kinnon disagree with this statement.
"That is a drastic overstatement. In the 19205, there
was an immense amount of speculation, a collapse of
confidence in the economy," Boskin said. This is just a
small set of nervous people afraid of being lingered by
Boesky."
According to McKinnon, there is too much incentive
for takeover bids because the corporate raider gets paid
off and shareholders get less.
"Hopefully, the legislation will be constructive for
such things as green mail but will not completely elimi
nate the possibility of an unfriendly takeover, he said.
