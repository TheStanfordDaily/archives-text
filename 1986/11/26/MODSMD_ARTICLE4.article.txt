# Band readies for Japan trip
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
When Band members arrive in Tokyo tomorrow, they
should refrain from speaking in loud voices, sitting on desks
or tables, and eating while they walk.
Each of these actions is considered a social blunder in
Japan, according to Foreign Student Adviser Marcia Makino,
who led a workshop to prepare Band members for cultural
differences they may face when they perform at the Coca-
Cola Bowl this weekend.
The bowl game pits the Stanford football team against the
University of Arizona Wildcats. Both teams along with the
Band are scheduled to depart from San Francisco Interna
tional Airport today at 10 a.m.
That may not sound early, except that Band members
must report to the Band Shak at 6:30 a.m. to begin loading
suitcases onto their truck.
Fcxnball plavers will be sitting in the front of the plane,
leaving the Band in the back for the 11-hour trip to Tokyo.
Sixty playing members and 55 non-playing members
from each f<x>tball team are on the flight, along with 100
members of the 150-member Band. The Arizona band will
depart separately from I.os Angleles.
The people of Japan are scheduled to get their first
glimpse of the Stanford crowd at 1:40 p.m. Japan time to
morrow. Japan is ahead of the United States by 17 hours.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger will also be on the plane.
Fie plans to divide his time in Japan between the team, the
Band and several official receptions planned by the com
panies sponsoring the bowl.
Geiger is not alone in representing Stanford. University
President Donald Kennedy has already left for Japan with a
group of alumni, faculty and administrators.
The Stanford and Arizona bands plan to perform side by

side on the field at the bowl. Several of the planned songs
were submitted by each band, and about 20 songs were cho
sen by the sponsors.
Stanford band members expressed mixed feelings about
the songs they are scheduled to play, which include "We Are
the World," "Papa Don't Preach" and "Say You Say Me."
"They're different. They're a little out of line from what
we're used to playing," said sophomore John McGrory. "But
it's a small sacrifice."
Some members see a larger sacrifice in their expected
marching performance with the Arizona band.
"The Arizona director said he could teach us how to
march in 20 minutes. Ha, ha, ha, ha. That's absolutely
impossible. It will not happen," said junior Susan Greim.
"Their side will probably look really nice, and we'll look
indiscernible, because we've never marched before,"
Greim said.
The bands will not learn the footwork for the show until
their arrival in Tokyo. The itinerary' calls for a great deal of
practice.
Band members are scheduled to spend their first full day
in Japan practicing the show. Except for lunch and dinner
breaks, the two bands will practice from 7:45 a.m. until 10
p.m., a plan that will challenge Band members who remem
ber that the Japanese consider yaw ning to be rude.
After playing for a parade and evening concert Saturday,
the Band will have a final practice Sunday morning. The
Coca-Cola Bowl is scheduled for 115 p.m. Sunday, Japan
time
The f(K)tball players' schedule also focuses on practice.
The team plans to rise at 4 a.m. Friday for a morning of
meetings and an afternoon of practice.
Its going to be a long day," said senior Jeff James, who
added that bed check will be at 9 p.m..
