WASHINGTON — President Reagan
accepted Vice Adm. John Poindexter's
resignation as his chief national secur
ity adviser yesterday and dismissed
Oliver North, one of Poindexter's
aides, after a Department of Justice in
vestigation disclosed that up to $30
million in proceeds from arms sales to
Iran had been diverted to Nicaraguan
rebels.

Attorney General Edwin Meese, who
has been investigating the Iranian arms
deal, said that North was the only gov
ernment official with full knowledge of
the diversion of funds to the rebels,
known as contras. Poindexter, he said,
knew "that something of this nature
was occurring" several months ago but
did not inform the president.
A government source said that it was
North, acting in the face of a presiden
tial decision to the contrary, who au
thorized the first shipment of U.S.-
made arms from Israel to Iran in late
summer 1985.
' In August 1985 — despite ihe presi
dent's (previous) disapproval — an Is
raeli shipment of arms went to Iran,''
said the source. "Oliver North author
ized the Israelis to do it and didn't tell
Reagan."

That official, speaking on condition
that he not be named, said it remained
unknown whether North was acting on
his own or at someone else's direction.
Meese confirmed that Reagan did
not learn until afterward about this
arms shipment, which was followed by
the release of American hostage Ben
jamin Weir and became the catalyst for
the president's decision the following
January to begin supplying weapons to
Iran.
But Meese said that Israel acted on
its own in the arms shipment of late
summer 1985. "To my knowledge," he
said, "nobody authorized that particu
lar shipment specifically."
At a White House briefing for
reporters, Reagan said that although
Poindexter had not been "directly in
volved" in the diversion of funds, he
had "asked to be relieved of his assign
ment ... and to return to another as
signment in the Navy." North, he said,
"has been relieved of his duties on the
National Security Council staff."
The president, seeking for the first
time to distance himself from an oper
ation that has seriously undermined
his administration's credibility,
declared that he had not been fully in
formed of the initiative.
While insisting that the goals of his
Iranian policy were "well-founded," he
said he was deeply troubled to learn
that implementation of the policy was
"seriously flawed" and raised "serious
questions of propriety."
Grim-faced as he read a short
prepared statement, Reagan an
nounced that he had ordered an inves
tigation by Attorney General Edwin
Meese. He also said that he would ap
point a special review board to study
the role and procedures of the White
House National Security Council staff,
which Poindexter headed, in the con
duct of foreign affairs.
In a lengthy briefing following
Reagan's brief appearance, Meese said
that he was investigating whether
anyone involved in the Iranian arms
sale was subject to criminal prosecu
tion.
Meese said Israel acted on its own in
late summer of 1985 to ship U.S.-made
arms to Iran. "To my knowledge," he
said, "nobody authorized that particu
lar shipment specifically." Other gov
ernment sources have told the Los An
geles Times that Reagan had rejected a
proposal to approve shipments of arms
from Israel to Iran, although the Israeli
government continued to insist today

that it had U.S. authorization for the
late-summer arms sale.
In January of this year, Meese said,
Reagan decided to authorize the ship
ment of U.S. arms to Iran in an effort to
help stop the Iran-Iraq war and to se
cure the release of American hostages
held in Lebanon by Moslem militants
with ties to Iran.
"Three or four shipments" were ulti
mately made by way of Israel, Meese
said, and some of the proceeds from at
least one of them and possibly as many
as three were transferred to Swiss bank
accounts for the use of the contras.
Meese said members of the National
Security Council, himself included,
knew of the Iranian arms deal after
Reagan approved it in January. But
Meese said neither he nor any other
member of the NSC was aware of the
diversion of funds to the contras until
he discovered it during a "thorough"
review of documents over the
weekend under instructions from
Reagan.
Meese, speaking in measured tones
and meticulous detail as he answered
reporters' questions for almost an
hour, said: "The president knew noth
ing about it until I reported it to him. I
alerted him yesterday morning."
Meese said that at least three per
sons — Poindexter, North and Robert

McFarlane, whom Poindexter
succeeded as national security adviser
last December — knew about the di
version of funds to the contras. But
North, Meese said, was the only person
in the U.S. government who knew
precisely" about the affair.
Poindexter "did know that some
thing of this nature was occurring, but
he did not look into it further,'' Meese
said. He added that Poindexter learned
of the money transfer sometime
during the last year but "did not try to
stop it."
And McFarlane, who accompanied
North in May on a visit to Tehran in
connection with the arms shipments,
learned of the diversion of funds in
April or May of this year after he had
already left the government, Meese
said. He said that it was his understand
ing that McFarlane knew of the transfer
of funds while it was going on.
The disclosure that money had been
diverted to the contras at a time when
Congress had rejected formal U.S. gov
ernment aid to them stirred a new
storm of criticism on Capitol Hill. Sen
ate Republican leader Robert Dole of
Kansas called the diversion of funds "a
bizarre twist which has to be explored
thoroughly before any final judgments
are drawn."

Poindexter had not been "directly in
volved" in the diversion of funds, he
had "asked to be relieved of his assign
ment ... and to return to another as
signment in the Navy." North, he said,
"has been relieved of his duties on the
National Security Council staff."
The president, seeking for the first
time to distance himself from an oper
ation that has seriously undermined
his administration's credibility,
declared that he had not been fully in
formed of the initiative.
While insisting that the goals of his
Iranian policy were "well-founded," he
said he was deeply troubled to learn
that implementation of the policy was
"seriously flawed" and raised "serious
questions of propriety."
Grim-faced as he read a short
prepared statement, Reagan an
nounced that he had ordered an inves
tigation by Attorney General Edwin
Meese. He also said that he would ap
point a special review board to study
the role and procedures of the White
House National Security Council staff,
which Poindexter headed, in the con
duct of foreign affairs.
In a lengthy briefing following
Reagan's brief appearance, Meese said
that he was investigating whether
anyone involved in the Iranian arms
sale was subject to criminal prosecu
tion.
Meese said Israel acted on its own in
late summer of 1985 to ship U.S.-made
arms to Iran. "To my knowledge," he
said, "nobody authorized that particu
lar shipment specifically." Other gov
ernment sources have told the Los An
geles Times that Reagan had rejected a
proposal to approve shipments of arms
from Israel to Iran, although the Israeli
government continued to insist today

that it had U.S. authorization for the
late-summer arms sale.
In January of this year, Meese said,
Reagan decided to authorize the ship
ment of U.S. arms to Iran in an effort to
help stop the Iran-Iraq war and to se
cure the release of American hostages
held in Lebanon by Moslem militants
with ties to Iran.
"Three or four shipments" were ulti
mately made by way of Israel, Meese
said, and some of the proceeds from at
least one of them and possibly as many
as three were transferred to Swiss bank
accounts for the use of the contras.
Meese said members of the National
Security Council, himself included,
knew of the Iranian arms deal after
Reagan approved it in January. But
Meese said neither he nor any other
member of the NSC was aware of the
diversion of funds to the contras until
he discovered it during a "thorough"
review of documents over the
weekend under instructions from
Reagan.
Meese, speaking in measured tones
and meticulous detail as he answered
reporters' questions for almost an
hour, said: "The president knew noth
ing about it until I reported it to him. I
alerted him yesterday morning."
Meese said that at least three per
sons — Poindexter, North and Robert

McFarlane, whom Poindexter
succeeded as national security adviser
last December — knew about the di
version of funds to the contras. But
North, Meese said, was the only person
in the U.S. government who knew
precisely" about the affair.
Poindexter "did know that some
thing of this nature was occurring, but
he did not look into it further,'' Meese
said. He added that Poindexter learned
of the money transfer sometime
during the last year but "did not try to
stop it."
And McFarlane, who accompanied
North in May on a visit to Tehran in
connection with the arms shipments,
learned of the diversion of funds in
April or May of this year after he had
already left the government, Meese
said. He said that it was his understand
ing that McFarlane knew of the transfer
of funds while it was going on.
The disclosure that money had been
diverted to the contras at a time when
Congress had rejected formal U.S. gov
ernment aid to them stirred a new
storm of criticism on Capitol Hill. Sen
ate Republican leader Robert Dole of
Kansas called the diversion of funds "a
bizarre twist which has to be explored
thoroughly before any final judgments
are drawn."

WASHINGTON — President Reagan
accepted Vice Adm. John Poindexter's
resignation as his chief national secur
ity adviser yesterday and dismissed
Oliver North, one of Poindexter's
aides, after a Department of Justice in
vestigation disclosed that up to $30
million in proceeds from arms sales to
Iran had been diverted to Nicaraguan
rebels.

Attorney General Edwin Meese, who
has been investigating the Iranian arms
deal, said that North was the only gov
ernment official with full knowledge of
the diversion of funds to the rebels,
known as contras. Poindexter, he said,
knew "that something of this nature
was occurring" several months ago but
did not inform the president.
A government source said that it was
North, acting in the face of a presiden
tial decision to the contrary, who au
thorized the first shipment of U.S.-
made arms from Israel to Iran in late
summer 1985.
' In August 1985 — despite ihe presi
dent's (previous) disapproval — an Is
raeli shipment of arms went to Iran,''
said the source. "Oliver North author
ized the Israelis to do it and didn't tell
Reagan."

That official, speaking on condition
that he not be named, said it remained
unknown whether North was acting on
his own or at someone else's direction.
Meese confirmed that Reagan did
not learn until afterward about this
arms shipment, which was followed by
the release of American hostage Ben
jamin Weir and became the catalyst for
the president's decision the following
January to begin supplying weapons to
Iran.
