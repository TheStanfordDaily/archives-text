WASHINGTON — President Reagan
accepted Vice Adm. John Poindexter's
resignation as his chief national secur
ity adviser yesterday and dismissed
Oliver North, one of Poindexter's
aides, after a Department of Justice in
vestigation disclosed that up to $30
million in proceeds from arms sales to
Iran had been diverted to Nicaraguan
rebels.

Attorney General Edwin Meese, who
has been investigating the Iranian arms
deal, said that North was the only gov
ernment official with full knowledge of
the diversion of funds to the rebels,
known as contras. Poindexter, he said,
knew "that something of this nature
was occurring" several months ago but
did not inform the president.
A government source said that it was
North, acting in the face of a presiden
tial decision to the contrary, who au
thorized the first shipment of U.S.-
made arms from Israel to Iran in late
summer 1985.
' In August 1985 — despite ihe presi
dent's (previous) disapproval — an Is
raeli shipment of arms went to Iran,''
said the source. "Oliver North author
ized the Israelis to do it and didn't tell
Reagan."

That official, speaking on condition
that he not be named, said it remained
unknown whether North was acting on
his own or at someone else's direction.
Meese confirmed that Reagan did
not learn until afterward about this
arms shipment, which was followed by
the release of American hostage Ben
jamin Weir and became the catalyst for
the president's decision the following
January to begin supplying weapons to
Iran.
But Meese said that Israel acted on
its own in the arms shipment of late
summer 1985. "To my knowledge," he
said, "nobody authorized that particu
lar shipment specifically."
At a White House briefing for
reporters, Reagan said that although
Poindexter had not been "directly in
volved" in the diversion of funds, he
had "asked to be relieved of his assign
ment ... and to return to another as
signment in the Navy." North, he said,
"has been relieved of his duties on the
National Security Council staff."
The president, seeking for the first
time to distance himself from an oper
ation that has seriously undermined
his administration's credibility,
declared that he had not been fully in
formed of the initiative.
While insisting that the goals of his
Iranian policy were "well-founded," he
said he was deeply troubled to learn
