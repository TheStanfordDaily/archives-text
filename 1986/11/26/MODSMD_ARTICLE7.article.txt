# Student forum looks at grove plan
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
The preliminary design for Centennial Grove was
received enthusiastically at a student forum on Uni
versity building and planning held last night at
Tresidder Memorial Union.
The forum, organized by student representatives
from the University Committee on Land and Building
Development (UCLBD), was designed to educate stu
dents about the process of University planning and
development and to elicit student response to the
process, using the Centennial Grove project as a
focus and test case.
Centennial Grove is a planned landscaping and
sculpture project intended to honor donors to Stan
ford during its first 100 years and to provide a place
to recognize future benefactors of the University.
The grove will be located at the northwest
(mathematics) corner of the Quad, running parallel
to Serra Street on one side and the Varian Physics
Building parking lot on the other. The new grove is
designed to be similar to Dohrman Grove, the grove
of redwood trees situated between the Graduate
School of Business and the University Art Gallery

near the Quad's northeast (history) corner.
According to Centennial Grove project manager
John Kennedy of the University Facilities Project Man
agement, the dual goals in the design of the grove
were "to honor donors and to create an area that
invites people to use it."
University planners hope the grove will be ready
for May 14, 1987, ceremonies commemorating the
100-year anniversary of the laying of the University's
cornerstone.
At last night's forum, Kennedy presented a scale
model and schematic drawings of the proposed
design of the grove.
Students and community members attending the
forum were universally pleased with the design.
"I really like it," said senior Heather Stone, one of
the forum's organizers and a student representative
on the UCLBD. "I think it's really something that can
be majestic."
"I think it's excellent," said Heidi Hansen, a 1980
Stanford graduate and now a Palo Alto architect. "It's
nice and clear conceptually.... It will function very
nicely."
Several students at the forum, while expressing ap
proval of the design, raised questions about student

involvement in the University's planning process.
The design "is aesthetically great, and it meets
criteria set for it," said Tom Strand, a graduate stu
dent in resources planning. "But I'm really con
cerned about who came up with the idea of a place to
honor donors ... and at what point students can plug
into that (decisionmaking) process.
"We don't want to throw a bug into the works, but
there is a point where student input becomes cru
cial," he said.
Last night's forum, the first of its kind, was a start
toward increased student involvement in the Univer
sity planning process, according to UCLBD student
representative Jane Woodward, an MBA student who
organized the forum along with Stone.
"We're just trying to open up the process," Wood
ward said. "If we can get a core of people who are in
terested, I think that's a good thing.... The nature of
the decisions (made by the UCLBD) has to do with
aesthetics; if you have two students representing
13,000, it's byund to be biased."
"I think this forum is a really good way for us
(students) to get input in the process," said junior
Craig Young.
