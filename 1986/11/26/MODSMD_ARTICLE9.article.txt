Shultz will control Iran policy
WASHINGTON — The State Department announced yesterday that it has
been given control over U.S. policy toward Iran, effective "immediately."
Secretary of State George Shultz said he fully supports President Reagan's
goals there and intends "to be very much a part of the effort to bring them
to fruition."
The reassertion of the department's primacy in Middle East policy
making followed the announcement of Vice Adm. John Poindexter's resig
nation as Reagan's national security adviser. It also came one day after
Shultz's deputy secretary, John Whitehead, appeared before Congress and
sharply criticized the National Security Council staff for its role in the secret
shipment of arms to Iran.
Whitehead's testimony, and Shultz's earlier statements that he had
opposed the Iranian arms operation and then was left largely uninformed
about it, had caused some White House officials and other Reagan loyalists
to describe a State Department in open rebellion against the president.
Reagan supporters' anger at Shultz was made clear by Attorney General
Edwin Meese when he appeared at the White House to announce Poindex
ter's departure. While asserting that he was not referring to any individual,
Meese answered questions about public dissension in the administration's
top ranks by saying:
"I think every member of the administration owes it to the president to
stand shoulder to shoulder with him and support the policies that he has."
Meese also said the question of Shultz's leaving "has not been a mattter
of conjecture or discussion or inquiry." But White House sources, who
asked not to be identified, said they believe that Shultz will leave when the
furor over the Iran dealings shows signs of abating. The sources predicted
that Shultz will be gone in about two months, about the time Reagan
delivers his State of the Union address in late January.
Cease-fire expected in Manila
MANILA, Philippines — Negotiators for the Philippine government and
the communist rebels are very close to accord on a cease-fire and are likely
to sign an agreement this week, the government announced yesterday.
At the end of a grueling eight-hour meeting, government negotiator
Ramon Mitra reported that an agreement was close but that the two sides
would have to meet again today to solidify details. It is likely, Mitra said,
that an agreement will be signed tomorrow.
The rebels reopened cease-fire talks with the government earlier yester
day, three days after President Corazon Aquino gave the communist leader
ship until Monday to reach an agreement to end the bloody 17-year insur
gency or face all-out war.
Sources on both sides of the negotiating table have said that throughout
the five months of negotiations, Aquino has consistently been pushing
them for a cease-fire signing tomorrow, Nov. 27, which is the birthday of
her slain husband, former Sen. Benigno Aquino.
The president has offered the rebels a 30-day cease-fire, based mostly on
recommendations from the armed forces, whose commanders believe that
a longer cessation of hostilities would allow the communist New People's
Army to regroup and recruit fresh troops. The rebels responded earlier
this month with a 100-day proposal.
As negotiators for the two sides were on the verge of signing a compro
mise 60-day agreement two weeks ago, militant labor leader Rolando
Olalia was murdered and the rebel leadership canceled what could have
been their crucial meeting. The rebels' political arm, the National Demo
cratic Front, said at the time that they no longer felt safe continuing the
talks.
Durable goods orders plunge
WASHINGTON — New orders for durable goods received by American
manufacturers plunged 6 percent in October, the largest decline in 2 years,
dimming the nation's short-term economic prospects.
The big drop in new orders, which the Commerce Department yester
day said fell to a seasonally adjusted level of $102.2 billion, more than
wiped out a 4.7 percent gain in September that President Reagan hailed as
a sign the economy was about to experience a boom.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose
0.2 percent last month on a seasonally adjusted basis as energy price
declines partially offset increases in other categories — particularly for
food and beverages, medical care and the classification of other goods and
services.
With the small October rise in the consumer price index, which fol
lowed similar increases of 0.2 percent in August and 0.3 percent in Septem
ber, the CPI was up 1.5 percent since October 1985. It has gone up at an an
nual rate of 2.7 percent in the past three months, and most analysts expect
it to rise at a 3-5 percent to 4.5 percent rate during 1987.
Despite the new orders figures, which were at their lowest level since
April 1985, White House spokesman Larry Speakes asserted, "The Ameri
can economy is gathering steam ... and today's news on the inflation front
assures us that the new growth will not be accompanied by a return of the
devastating inflation that preceded the president's tenure in office."
Military upset with summit role
WASHINGTON — Quietly and almost haltingly, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff complained yesterday that the U.S. military should have been
given a greater role at the Reykjavik summit conference and that senior
military officers had no opportunity to advise President Reagan or his aides
once negotiations began.
Adm. William Crowe, the nation's top-ranking military officer, portrayed
the joint chiefs as a team relegated to the sidelines when Reagan and his
senior aides began preparations for the hastily arranged meeting with So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Iceland last month.
His testimony before a panel of the House Armed Services Committee
prompted the committee chairman, Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) to tell the
mild-mannered four-star admiral: "I wish you had been a little more as
sertive this fall."
"In this town, the squeaky wheel gets attention," Aspin said, admonish
ing Crowe: "You have to squeak a little more."
It was only after Reagan returned from Reykjavik, having discussed with
Gorbachev the possibilities of reducing the two superpowers' nuclear ar
senals by 50 percent in five years and of eliminating all nuclear missiles in
10 years, that the joint chiefs began to study the impact such reductions
would have on the military forces.
"We didn't think the negotiations at Reykjavik would go that far that fast.
We plain didn't," Crowe testified.
And he conceded that from the vantage point of "Monday-morning quar
terbacking," the chiefs could have given Reagan better advice.
Gorbachev arrives in New Delhi
NEW DELHI, India — Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi hailed Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a "crusader for peace" when the Kremlin
chief arrived here yesterday for a four-day state visit.
Gandhi also echoed Gorbachev's attacks on President Reagan's plans for
a space-based missile defense and said they wrecked chances for a dis
armament breakthrough at last month's superpower summit meeting in
Reykjavik, Iceland.
It was the strongest endorsement to date of Gorbachev's arms-control
proposals by Gandhi, who prides himself on his leadership of the non
aligned movement.
Gorbachev, making his first visit to an Asian nation since taking power 20
months ago, said "the chains of militarism" are blocking progress toward a
U.S.-Soviet arms accord.
Tens of thousands of spectators, including children who were let out of
school for the occasion, tried to get a glimpse of Gorbachev
Police blocked attempts by scores of refugees from Afghanistan to
protest the presence of Soviet troops in their country-, however, by seizing
their placards and banners and putting their leaders under house arrest.

Durable goods orders plunge
WASHINGTON — New orders for durable goods received by American
manufacturers plunged 6 percent in October, the largest decline in 2 years,
dimming the nation's short-term economic prospects.
The big drop in new orders, which the Commerce Department yester
day said fell to a seasonally adjusted level of $102.2 billion, more than
wiped out a 4.7 percent gain in September that President Reagan hailed as
a sign the economy was about to experience a boom.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose
0.2 percent last month on a seasonally adjusted basis as energy price
declines partially offset increases in other categories — particularly for
food and beverages, medical care and the classification of other goods and
services.
With the small October rise in the consumer price index, which fol
lowed similar increases of 0.2 percent in August and 0.3 percent in Septem
ber, the CPI was up 1.5 percent since October 1985. It has gone up at an an
nual rate of 2.7 percent in the past three months, and most analysts expect
it to rise at a 3-5 percent to 4.5 percent rate during 1987.
Despite the new orders figures, which were at their lowest level since
April 1985, White House spokesman Larry Speakes asserted, "The Ameri
can economy is gathering steam ... and today's news on the inflation front
assures us that the new growth will not be accompanied by a return of the
devastating inflation that preceded the president's tenure in office."
Military upset with summit role
WASHINGTON — Quietly and almost haltingly, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff complained yesterday that the U.S. military should have been
given a greater role at the Reykjavik summit conference and that senior
military officers had no opportunity to advise President Reagan or his aides
once negotiations began.
Adm. William Crowe, the nation's top-ranking military officer, portrayed
the joint chiefs as a team relegated to the sidelines when Reagan and his
senior aides began preparations for the hastily arranged meeting with So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Iceland last month.
His testimony before a panel of the House Armed Services Committee
prompted the committee chairman, Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) to tell the
mild-mannered four-star admiral: "I wish you had been a little more as
sertive this fall."
"In this town, the squeaky wheel gets attention," Aspin said, admonish
ing Crowe: "You have to squeak a little more."
It was only after Reagan returned from Reykjavik, having discussed with
Gorbachev the possibilities of reducing the two superpowers' nuclear ar
senals by 50 percent in five years and of eliminating all nuclear missiles in
10 years, that the joint chiefs began to study the impact such reductions
would have on the military forces.
"We didn't think the negotiations at Reykjavik would go that far that fast.
We plain didn't," Crowe testified.
And he conceded that from the vantage point of "Monday-morning quar
terbacking," the chiefs could have given Reagan better advice.
Gorbachev arrives in New Delhi
NEW DELHI, India — Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi hailed Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a "crusader for peace" when the Kremlin
chief arrived here yesterday for a four-day state visit.
Gandhi also echoed Gorbachev's attacks on President Reagan's plans for
a space-based missile defense and said they wrecked chances for a dis
armament breakthrough at last month's superpower summit meeting in
Reykjavik, Iceland.
It was the strongest endorsement to date of Gorbachev's arms-control
proposals by Gandhi, who prides himself on his leadership of the non
aligned movement.
Gorbachev, making his first visit to an Asian nation since taking power 20
months ago, said "the chains of militarism" are blocking progress toward a
U.S.-Soviet arms accord.
Tens of thousands of spectators, including children who were let out of
school for the occasion, tried to get a glimpse of Gorbachev
Police blocked attempts by scores of refugees from Afghanistan to
protest the presence of Soviet troops in their country-, however, by seizing
their placards and banners and putting their leaders under house arrest.

Shultz will control Iran policy
WASHINGTON — The State Department announced yesterday that it has
been given control over U.S. policy toward Iran, effective "immediately."
Secretary of State George Shultz said he fully supports President Reagan's
goals there and intends "to be very much a part of the effort to bring them
to fruition."
The reassertion of the department's primacy in Middle East policy
making followed the announcement of Vice Adm. John Poindexter's resig
nation as Reagan's national security adviser. It also came one day after
Shultz's deputy secretary, John Whitehead, appeared before Congress and
sharply criticized the National Security Council staff for its role in the secret
shipment of arms to Iran.
Whitehead's testimony, and Shultz's earlier statements that he had
opposed the Iranian arms operation and then was left largely uninformed
about it, had caused some White House officials and other Reagan loyalists
to describe a State Department in open rebellion against the president.
Reagan supporters' anger at Shultz was made clear by Attorney General
Edwin Meese when he appeared at the White House to announce Poindex
ter's departure. While asserting that he was not referring to any individual,
Meese answered questions about public dissension in the administration's
top ranks by saying:
"I think every member of the administration owes it to the president to
stand shoulder to shoulder with him and support the policies that he has."
Meese also said the question of Shultz's leaving "has not been a mattter
of conjecture or discussion or inquiry." But White House sources, who
asked not to be identified, said they believe that Shultz will leave when the
furor over the Iran dealings shows signs of abating. The sources predicted
that Shultz will be gone in about two months, about the time Reagan
delivers his State of the Union address in late January.
Cease-fire expected in Manila
MANILA, Philippines — Negotiators for the Philippine government and
the communist rebels are very close to accord on a cease-fire and are likely
to sign an agreement this week, the government announced yesterday.
At the end of a grueling eight-hour meeting, government negotiator
Ramon Mitra reported that an agreement was close but that the two sides
would have to meet again today to solidify details. It is likely, Mitra said,
that an agreement will be signed tomorrow.
The rebels reopened cease-fire talks with the government earlier yester
day, three days after President Corazon Aquino gave the communist leader
ship until Monday to reach an agreement to end the bloody 17-year insur
gency or face all-out war.
Sources on both sides of the negotiating table have said that throughout
the five months of negotiations, Aquino has consistently been pushing
them for a cease-fire signing tomorrow, Nov. 27, which is the birthday of
her slain husband, former Sen. Benigno Aquino.
The president has offered the rebels a 30-day cease-fire, based mostly on
recommendations from the armed forces, whose commanders believe that
a longer cessation of hostilities would allow the communist New People's
Army to regroup and recruit fresh troops. The rebels responded earlier
this month with a 100-day proposal.
As negotiators for the two sides were on the verge of signing a compro
mise 60-day agreement two weeks ago, militant labor leader Rolando
Olalia was murdered and the rebel leadership canceled what could have
been their crucial meeting. The rebels' political arm, the National Demo
