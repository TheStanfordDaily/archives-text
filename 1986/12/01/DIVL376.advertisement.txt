I How's this for a football oddity I
| . . . Did you know there was |
■ once a college football game ■
J in which one team did not ran _
■ or pass the ball at any time '
I during the entire game, and I
| still won it!. .. It happened to |
■ Kentucky ... In a game in the ■
J early 1900s, Kentucky _
I decided to kick on first down '
I every time they got the ba11... I
| They did kick on the first down |
■ throughout the game . . . They ■
■ never ran the ball and never :
I passed . . . And they won 12-6 ®
| by recovering two fumbles by I
■ their opponents in the end |
_ zonel. . . The oddity is hard to ■
■ believe by it's been verified by J
I the Kentucky Athletic Depart- I
| ment. I

■ Ever wonder how many commer- |
-cials there are during the telecast of ■
■ college or pro football games? • • • ■
I How many would you say? • • • J
| The national TV networks put in I
■ about 50 different commercials |
■ during the telecast of each game.

' When was the last time a team J
I won the championship of the I
| National Football League with |
■ a rookie as its regular quarter- ■
! back? ... It hasn't happened .
■ since 1945 when the Rams ■
| won the NFL title with rookie I
| Bob Waterfield at quarter- |
■ back.
