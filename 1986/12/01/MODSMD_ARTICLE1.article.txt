# Bunzel to leave rights agency

### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
John Bunzel, a senior research fel
low at the Hoover Institution, intends
to leave the United States Commission
on Civil Rights, an agency which he
says has been crippled by internal dis
cord and a loss of credibility.
In a letter to President Reagan last
week, Bunzel wrote that he did not
wish to be reappointed when his
three-year term ends this month.
Reagan appointed Bunzel to the com
mission in spring 1983.
"The commission, sad to say, has
become a little Beruit on the
Potomac," Bunzel wrote to Reagan. He
added that the commission "has been
caught up in an unrelenting political
struggle for power and control."
Bunzel has sided with a majority of
the eight-member commission in op
posing the use of quotas for hiring
women and blacks and in resisting the
use of busing to desegregate schools.

In addition to attacking the liberal
civil rights activists who have criticized
the commission, Bunzel in his letter
also blasted the conservative chairman
of the commission, Clarence
Pendleton Jr.
Under Pendleton's leadership, Bun
zel wrote, "the crisis of credibility and
confidence has deepened."
These comments on Pendleton
reiterated criticisms of the chairman
that Bunzel initially made six months
ago when he publicly called for
Pendleton's resignation.
In an April letter to Pendleton, Bun
zel wrote, "During the two-and-a-half
years I have been a member of the
commission 1 have been increasingly
disturbed by your inflammatory rheto
ric. It has too often stifled rather than
contributed to the kind of rational and
respectful debate of complex issues
that is needed today."
At the time, Bunzel also denounced
