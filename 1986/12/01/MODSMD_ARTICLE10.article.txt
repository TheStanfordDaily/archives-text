# U.S. violates SALT II treaty
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The United States broke the
1979 strategic arms limitation treaty Friday as the
131st B-52 bomber equipped to carry cruise missiles
landed at a Texas air base, touching off a storm of
protest from arms control advocates in Congress.
When the plane arrived at 3:02 p.m. EST at the Stra
tegic Air Command's cruise missile facility at
Carswell Air Force Base, it put the United States over
the SALT II limit of 1,320 launchers for land- and sea
launched intercontinental ballistic missiles with mul
tiple warheads and bombers armed with cruise
missiles.
The treaty was never ratified by the U.S. Senate, but
both Washington and Moscow had pledged to follow
it.
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), expected to become
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee
when Congress resumes in January, said the action
ultimately would benefit the Soviet Union far more
than the United States, damage U.S. relations with its
allies and thwart future arms control efforts.
Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) predicted that
Congress would pass legislation early next year re
quiring the administration to dismantle another
weapons system to push the U.S. total back under the
limit. He sent Reagan a letter signed by a bipartisan

group of 15 senators that urged continued compli
ance with the pact.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, said breaching the pact
was "a very bad decision" designed only to burnish
Reagan's reputation with right-wing ideologues.
Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.1.) said the administration
"just handed (Moscow) an excuse" to resume a
missile arms race that it is in a position to win, at least
in the short run.
Reagan announced May 27 that the United States
no longer considered itself bound by the treaty,
which it accused Moscow of violating repeatedly. He
said at that time that Washington would not scrap any
other weapons to compensate for the 131st cruise
missile carrier when it was ready for deployment.
Although all other members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization urged the United States to
reconsider that decision, President Reagan decided
earlier this week to go ahead with his original plan.
Britain, West Germany, Canada and the Nether
lands issued statements Friday deploring the U.S. ac
tion. Other members of the alliance were expected
to express similar displeasure shortly,
At Carswell air base, Capt. Paula Hoffmann, a
public affairs officer, said the bomber was not carry

ing cruise missiles when it arrived from Kelly Air
Force Base, Texas, where it had been modified to
carry 12 of the accurate, low-flying missiles designed
to penetrate Soviet air defenses. But she said it would
go on alert on a "normal rotational basis" with other
cruise missile carriers at the base.
Congressional leaders agreed last month to aban
don efforts to force Reagan to comply with SALT II to
avoid embarrassing the president before his Iceland
summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev.
However, Bumpers said in a statement Friday:
"Congress will almost certainly mandate a reversal of
this decision when it reconvenes in January."
"Even the CIA has said that the Soviets would have
several thousand more nuclear warheads by the mid
-1990s without SALT than they would have if they con
tinued abiding by the treaty," he said.
Although the administration has accused Moscow
of a long list of violations of arms limitation agree
ments, it has not charged the Soviets with deploying
more weapons systems than permitted by the pact. A
Bumpers aide said the Soviets have dismantled more
than 500 missiles and bombers to remain in compli
ance with the treaty.
