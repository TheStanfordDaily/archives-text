# Stanford Hospital needs more nurses

### 
Due to a recent surge of patients,
Stanford University Hopsital needs to
hire nurses to fill approximately 50 im
mediate positions.
According to Malinda Mitchell,
director of nursing services, 150
nurses have already been hired during
the last six months. Mitchell said the
growing number of patients who need
to stay in the hospital is responsible for
the increased need for nurses.
Patient volume has unexpectedly in
creased by an average of 8 percent
since June, said Dan Heath, associate
director of finance. During some
months, patient volume has been as
much as 16 percent above last year's
rates.
The increase has surprised adminis
trators, who are still adjusting to the
"downsizing" that took place early this
year in response to a regional hospital
slump. During that period, no new
nursing positions were created, and
those that were unfilled were
eliminated. Although no nurses were
laid off, vacated positions were also
eliminated.
Mitchell said she anticipates that the
need for more nurses will continue to
increase because of the new programs
being developed. The hospital, for ex
ample, has recently initiated a kidney

transplant program as part of an over
all thrust toward the formation of a
transplantation center.
The hospital is in the midst of a
major renovation project, scheduled
for completion next year. With
updated and improved facilities for
patients and physicians, hospital admi
nistrators foresee a subsequent in
crease of approximately 7 percent.
As one of three designated trauma
centers for Santa Clara County, the
hospital has been seeing an increase in
the number of trauma patients, many
of whom require require intensive
care treatment. Likewise, many posi
tions that remain open are in the inten
sive care areas.
"All the units are very busy,"
Mitchell said. "Nurses have been put
ting in a lot of overtime, but they can't
continue to do so on a long-term basis.
They burn out."
To alleviate the shortage, the nur
sing service has stepped up its recruit
ing effort with heavy advertising in
newspapers and professional journals.
Representatives have attempted to
recruit nurses at a number of profes
sional meetings and a career day was
held last month to give prospective
employees a chance to visit the hospi
tal.
