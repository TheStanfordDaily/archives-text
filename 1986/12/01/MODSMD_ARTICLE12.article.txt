Dean Gibbons backs the liberal arts
Support of science and technology is critical, hut
the most important issues have essentially
qualitative, subjective dimensions best ap
proached through studies of literature, history, art
and social sciences," Engineering Dean James Gib
bons said Saturday in Tokyo.
"This is as true for leadership in engineering as
it is for leadership in public policy, lie said in
remarks prepared for the Stanford conference in
Tokyo. Sponsored by the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion and the Japan-Stanford Association, the confer
ence was held at the Press Club preceding the
Stanford-Arizona football game.
At the conference, Gibbons disclosed that plans
for Stanford's Near West Campus — a 4l -acre, $250
million project — include a new $30 million
photon science center.
The center will house four experimental X-ray
stations giving Stanford "a unique resource for
studying material surfaces and interfaces on an
atomic scale," he said. It will be used for studies of
non-invasive angiography, dynamic processes on
semiconductor and other material surfaces, and for
the flourescent examination of geologic materials.
In all, 60 faculty from the School of Earth
Sciences, five departments in the School of Engi
neering and four departments in the School of
Humanities and Sciences have major research in
terests in the general field of materials, Gibbons
said.
According to Gibbons, education for future lead

ership means:
• providing undergraduates with the education
needed for a productive life in "a high tech. H & I)-
intensive, global society;
• "doing basic research and providing graduate
education in the major professions with strong
connections to both industry and the federal gov
ernment; and
• "educating new faculty who will teach others in
schools and universities across the nation and
around the world."
Education should enable students to understand
the relationships between science, technology,
venture capital and public policy, for example,
without having to be scientists or engineers them
selves, Gibbons said.
Levlnthal named associate dean
Elliott Levinthal, professor of mechanical engi
neering and director of the Stanford Institute for
Manufacturing and Automation (SIMA), has been
appointed associate dean of research for the
School of Engineering by Dean James Gibbons.
Levinthal will be responsible for monitoring in
terdepartmental research activities within the
School of Engineering and joint Univer
sity/industry institutes on campus. He will also
oversee the operations of Research Administration.
Levinthal, who received a doctorate in physics
from Stanford in 1949, returned to the University
in 1961 as senior scientist and director of the In
strumentation Research Laboratory in the School

of Medicine's Department of Genetics. He served
as associate dean for research affairs at the School
of Medicine from 19 7 0 until 19-3 He was named
adjunct professor in the Department of Genetics in
19"4. where he remained until 1980
Prof. Emeritus Linsley honored
Ray Linsley, professor emeritus of civil engineer
ing, has been elected to the grade of Honorary
Member of the American Society of Civil En
gineers.
Linsley was cited for his "contributions to the
understanding and prediction of hydrologic
phenomena in his 46 years of experience in the art
and practice of hydrology.
Linsley is president of Linsley, Kraeger As
sociates Ltd. of Santa Cruz. I le is the former head of
Stanford's Department of Civil Engineering and
former associate dean of the School of Engineer
ing.
Kiparsky receives honorary doctorate
Linguistics Prof. Paul Kiparsky has received an
honorary doctorate from Gothenburg University in
Sweden.
The award, made earlier this fall at Gothenburg,
honors Kiparsky for his help in setting up the lin
guisitcs program at the Swedish university and for
his work in linguistics, specifically in historical lin
guistics.
