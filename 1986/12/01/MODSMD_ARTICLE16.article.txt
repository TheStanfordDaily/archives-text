# A 						foolish mistake
## 
### 
Sensibility and credibility were all but nonexistent in
U.S. foreign policy last week. First there was the Reagan
administration's inept handling of the Iran affair. Then,
on Friday, the United States violated the terms of the
1979 SALT II agreement when it deployed a B-52 bomber
newly refitted to carry cruise missiles. The action simply
defies common sense â€” and current wisdom.
Although the Senate has not ratified the treaty, most of
the key weapons ceilings had been observed by the
United States and the Soviet Union. The administration's
decision to deploy the plane was a bad one and stands as
a major setback for arms control. Agreement on the
move's stupidity has been virtually universal.
Members of Congress have said it will hamper
Reagan's relations with the House and Senate. According
to Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark ), the action will probably
lead to the passage of legislation requiring the adminis
tration to dismantle another weapons system to bring the
U.S. total back under the limit. Sen. John Chafee (R-R.1.)
said the administration "just handed an excuse" to the
Soviet Union to resume the arms race.
U.S. allies in Europe have also expressed dismay at the
decision. All members of NATO have pushed the admin
istration to reconsider the move. Britain, West Germany,
Canada and the Nethei lands have told the United States
that the decision is not in their interests

And understandably, the Soviet Union is unhappy with
the move. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called it "a
major mistake which will make it more difficult to search
for the approaches for disarmament."
To say that this violation of the arms treaty is contrary
to the spirit of arms control is redundant. Indeed, the ac
tion is only indicative of the callous attitude toward the
Soviet Union that has marked U.S. foreign policy since
the beginning of the Reagan era. If the administration
were truly concerned about meaningful arms reduction,
then perhaps an agreement would have been reached at
Reykjavik.
U.S. officials claim the Soviet Union has broken other
tenets of the treaty; however, the Soviets have not
deployed more weapons systems than is permitted by
the pact. They have ignored some aspects of the treaty, to
be sure, but they have also dismantled more than 500
missiles and bombers in the last few years in order to
remain in compliance with the agreement.
The accusation is simply puerile. Just because the So
viet Union has transgressed pans of the treaty doesn't
mean the United States should. Instead, the Reagan ad
ministration should prove to Moscow that it is serious
about arms control and abide by the terms of the SALT II
agreement of 1979.
