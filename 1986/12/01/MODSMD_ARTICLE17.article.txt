Reagan Library
bad due process

As the chairman of the committee
charged with finding an appropriate
site for the Ronald Reagan Library, I
have been asked by both trustee
James Gaither and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy to respond to a
recent letter (Daily, Nov. 6). Copies of
the letter, and of this response, will be
sent to members of the Board's Aca
demic Affairs and Development Com
mittee.
The letter suggests that Stanford has
changed its policy on the nature of the
facility for a Ronald Reagan Library
and has publicized one site but selec
ted another. If we had done this, then
the writers of the letter should be
concerned. I believe, however, the
record shows that Stanford's decisions
have been faithful to the letter and
spirit of the Board of Trustee resolu
tion of Dec. 13, 1985, and that there
has been no shift in site selection.
First, the record on the nature of
the facility shows a consistent, un
changed University position. The
trustee resolution of Dec. 13, 1983,
specifies, "a library with incorporated
museum facilities limited in space and
substantially integrated with the ar
chives and antechambers." The

Ronald Reagan Library Planning Com
mittee (RRLPC) recommended that
exhibit space be limited to 15 percent
of the library; the proposed exhibition
space in the design approved by the
Stanford Trustees is under 10 percent.
It is my understanding that Eureka
College, President Reagan's alma
mater, will receive the memorabilia of
campaign and elections. According to
the president's representative, the
exhibition space at the Reagan Library
at Stanford will supplement the main
functional uses of the archival material
in the library. There will be no public
affairs center in the library at Stanford.
The inclusion of incidental meeting
rooms, suitable for Stanford seminars,
and a small auditorium is consistent
with the purposes envisioned by the
1983 trustee resolution and do not
indicate a change in Stanford policy.
Second, with regard to the site, the
record Ls also clear. The RRLPC ex
amined, in considerable detail, 20
sites. The committee recommended to
Kennedy three sites: Page Mill Road,
Alpine Road and Junipero Serra
Boulevard. These sites were consid
ered by the Stanford University Board
of Trustees at its February 1985
meeting. The Board chose to offer the
Junipero Serra site to President
Reagan. The letter asserts that a site
near Interstate 280 was "publicized."
Whatever speculation may have
existed, at no time did any University

officer, the RRLPC or the Stanford
trustees issue any statement suggest
ing the selection of a site near Inter
state 280.
A final thought about the Stanford
foothills: The University values its
open space as much as you do. We are
well aware that the hills and fields are
an asset that few other institutions
possess. This property is part of the
land endowment granted to Stanford
at its founding. The trustees rejected a
plan in the 1950s to cover the foothills
with residential subdivisions (as much
of the surrounding hills have been
covered), and in 1974 they ruled out
commerical development of the prop
erty. While we can foresee no other
uses of the outlying land at this time,
the University reserves the right to use
the property for academic purposes
when necessary. We would do so as
sensitively as possible, within the
regulations of public agencies.
The resolutions and background
papers are available in this office
should anyone wish to read them.

Knowledge useful
in 'real world'
A recent editorial (Daily, Nov. 24)
endorsed a Stanford campus in Wash
ington, D.C. It linked students, knowl

edge and the real world in a simplistic
and unsound manner.
The assertion that Stanford students
are handicapped by knowledge with
out direct bearing on "real life" situa
tions reflects a misunderstanding of
education and evokes memories of a
time when course material was judged
for its relevance. A primary objective
of education is to indicate the advan
tages that perception, reasoning and
formulation provide in the study of
diverse problems; such an objective is
not furnished by the mere presenta
tion of facts, however detailed or
precise. Knowledge accumulates over
a lifetime and undergraduates cannot
be expected to acquire a vast store in
four or five years; they can and
should, however, learn how to effec
tively organize and analyze data in
accord with basic rules or concepts.
Theoretical developments in nuclear
physics, electronics, aeronautics and
chemistry, made without any signifi
cant cues from the outside world,
certainly had an impact in wartime;
but they did not spring from such
realities. Undergraduates should
clamor for, in their long-term inter
ests, greater emphasis on fundamental
concepts in the curriculum, which
does not necessitate the complication
and distraction of real-life situations
or the opening of new campus sites.
