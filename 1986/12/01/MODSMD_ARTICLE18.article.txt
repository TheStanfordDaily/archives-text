# Novel experience for this engineer
## 
### 
What is the likelihood of an obscure civil engineer
writing an adventure novel while sitting on the beach
and finding a publisher that will buy it? Probably
about the same as an English major successfully de
signing a nuclear power plant or a political science
major performing effective brain surgery. Despite
the odds, Stanford's newest novelist comes from the
Department of Civil Engineering. Jeff Raines' first
novel, "The Big Island," is expected to be on the
streets in September.

While not drinking beer or watching "Late Night
with David Letterman," Jeff Raines can usually be
found in the basement of Terman plodding slowly
toward his doctorate in geotechnical engineering
("din to us mere mortals). After spending the sum
mer working for an engineering firm in Hawaii, Jeff
decided to vacation on the beach. When it became
apparent that no women were willing to talk to him,
Jeff created his literary masterpiece. Jeff freely admits
that his sole motives for writing were profit and
fame. Any future English student who claims that the
author was trying to make a strong social statement
or demonstrate man's inhumanity to man should be
summarilv flunked.
"The big Island' is a fast-paced, irreverent story
about the drug trade on the island of Hawaii. It in
cludes plent) of foul language, abundant violence
and .1 token steann sex scene that Jeff s mother found
offensive. It is no honor to be a character
in Jeffs book, since your chances of being alive at the
conclusion are quite low . Nobod\ w ho knows Jeff
would really expect him to write something sweet
and sensitive.
The book's main character is James Yamasaki, a
cynical and amoral chief of police on Haw aii. About
half the book occurs in the present and deals with
Chief Yamasaki s troubles after Mormon tourists are
killed while wandering too close to marijuana fields.
Yamasaki s life becomes threatened as the Mormons
seek vengeance and start murdering Hawaii's drug
producers The other part of the ston. told through a
series of flashbacks, focuses on Yamasaki's rather un
pleasant youth and introduction to the drug trade.
Yamasaki encountered racial hatred for most of his
life due to his mixed Japanese. Polynesian and Anglo
heritage. His bitterness and hatred of the rich white
tourists are evident throughout. Yamasaki's college
football career is cut short by an injurs'. The only
w oman he ever loved commits suicide, and Yamasaki

ends up in jail after a bar brawl. Like so many fine
Americans, the key provision in Yamasaki's release is
a tour of duty with the Marine Corps. We follow
Yamaski through boot camp at Parris Island and
eventually to the Vietnam War, where he is captured
during a raid on Laos. How Yamasaki's capture leads
to his drug connections and eventually to his posi
tion as chief of police is left for the reader to dis
cover.
"The Big Island" is fast, exciting and fun to read.
The nariative is told by Yamasaki in the first person.
The real bca'itv and humor of the novel is the sar
casm and cynicism of its protagonist. White attitudes,
the Mormon religion and all branches of the military
are lambasted with flair and biting wit. I figured that
after reading "The Big Island," I would know more
about its author than before I started. Bad assump
tion. Chief Yamasaki is so flippant and snide that the
reader must wait until the end of the book for even a
glimpse of human feeling.
Jeff admits that he identifies closely with Chief
Yamasaki, which is surprising; the two seem to have
little in common. While Jeff has a slender build,
Yamasaki weighs more than 260 pounds. Yamasaki's
mixture of nationalities and his minority status con
trast with Jeffs WASP upbringing. Yamasaki's world is
one of violence, corruption and illegal drugs. Jeffs
world centers on problem sets and computer pro
grams. Jeff has already become the elitist that his
main character despises. I'll leave that for him to ex
plain.
Jeffs rise to stardom includes a brief stint with The
Stanford Daily. As a columnist during the spring of
1985, Jeff authored such immortal classics as
"Gradsex: A fad for the 80s." He applied again last
autumn with a sample column entitled Beer blast
etiquette," but was turned away. Apparently, he
lacked the journalistic quality The Daily demands.
That and failing to qualify as a contestant on
"Jeopardy" are his two biggest failures to date.
Jeff s first big break came w hen he entered the first
chapter of his fledgling novel in the annual Playboy
College Fiction Contest. Out of several thousand
entires. Jeff took third place and won a year's sub
scription to Playboy — a far cry from the J3.000 first
prize. His name even appears in the October 1986
"Women of the Ivy League issue — how ironic.
Nevertheless, the honor attracted the attention of an
agent, which in today's world is half the battle.
Jeff completed the manuscript and submitted it to
his agent, who in turn submitted it to four publishers.
Considering the success rate of first-time novelists, it
is amazing that all four publishers offered to buy it. It
is even more astounding considering that Jeff has
never been to Southeast Asia, is not Mormon, has no
affiliation with the military, has never experienced
racial prejudice and does not take drugs — but was
writing about them all One publisher who had
hoped for a bargain dropped out upon discovering

that others were interested. An auction was held, and
Beechtree Books, a division of William Morrow, Inc.,
won the bid.
Jeffs original title, "Pete's Tears, was wonderfully
symbolic of the volcano goddess weeping over the
fate of her island. Unfortunately, the publisher feared
the public would think this was a sports story. It
preferred "The Big Island," an uninspired generic
title that will hopefully be appropriate for the movie.
Jeff is offering two cases of beer as a reward for an ac
ceptable alternative. Considering his advance on
royalties, it's a pretty chintzy prize.
After scoring with a first novel, a doctoral thesis
seems dull in comparison. Unsubstantiated rumor
has it that Jeff is already working on a second novel.
The next one reportedly takes place on the campus
of a prestigious private college on the West Coast.
FBI agents are called in to investigate a series of mur
ders involving the controversial location of a presi
dential library. The university's president, a former
biology professor with a reputation for seducing
comely female undergrads. discovers he is gay and
must reconcile his desires with his esteemed posi
tion in the community. A subplot develops as the stu
dent band kidnaps the athletic director It demands a
fl million ransom and assurance that the football
team will not consume alcohol or embarass the
school on the plaving field. It should be a winner,
Jeff.
The Big Island is an exciting blood and guts"
adventure story I found the dialogue clever, the sar
casm wonderful and the story believable. It is snappy,

Jeffs rise to stardom includes a brief stint with The

Jeff s first big break came w hen he entered the first
chapter of his fledgling novel in the annual Playboy

Jeff completed the manuscript and submitted it to
his agent, who in turn submitted it to four publishers.
Considering the success rate of first-time novelists, it
is amazing that all four publishers offered to buy it. It
is even more astounding considering that Jeff has

affiliation with the military, has never experienced

writing about them all One publisher who had

Beechtree Books, a division of William Morrow, Inc.,
won the bid.
Jeffs original title, "Pete's Tears, was wonderfully
symbolic of the volcano goddess weeping over the
fate of her island. Unfortunately, the publisher feared
the public would think this was a sports story. It
preferred "The Big Island," an uninspired generic
title that will hopefully be appropriate for the movie.
Jeff is offering two cases of beer as a reward for an ac

After scoring with a first novel, a doctoral thesis
seems dull in comparison. Unsubstantiated rumor
has it that Jeff is already working on a second novel.

What is the likelihood of an obscure civil engineer
writing an adventure novel while sitting on the beach
and finding a publisher that will buy it? Probably
about the same as an English major successfully de
signing a nuclear power plant or a political science
major performing effective brain surgery. Despite
the odds, Stanford's newest novelist comes from the
Department of Civil Engineering. Jeff Raines' first
novel, "The Big Island," is expected to be on the
streets in September.

While not drinking beer or watching "Late Night
with David Letterman," Jeff Raines can usually be
found in the basement of Terman plodding slowly
toward his doctorate in geotechnical engineering
("din to us mere mortals). After spending the sum
mer working for an engineering firm in Hawaii, Jeff
decided to vacation on the beach. When it became
apparent that no women were willing to talk to him,
Jeff created his literary masterpiece. Jeff freely admits
that his sole motives for writing were profit and
fame. Any future English student who claims that the
author was trying to make a strong social statement
or demonstrate man's inhumanity to man should be
summarilv flunked.
"The big Island' is a fast-paced, irreverent story
about the drug trade on the island of Hawaii. It in
cludes plent) of foul language, abundant violence
and .1 token steann sex scene that Jeff s mother found
offensive. It is no honor to be a character
in Jeffs book, since your chances of being alive at the
conclusion are quite low . Nobod\ w ho knows Jeff
would really expect him to write something sweet
and sensitive.
The book's main character is James Yamasaki, a
cynical and amoral chief of police on Haw aii. About
half the book occurs in the present and deals with
Chief Yamasaki s troubles after Mormon tourists are
killed while wandering too close to marijuana fields.
Yamasaki s life becomes threatened as the Mormons
seek vengeance and start murdering Hawaii's drug
producers The other part of the ston. told through a
series of flashbacks, focuses on Yamasaki's rather un
pleasant youth and introduction to the drug trade.
Yamasaki encountered racial hatred for most of his
life due to his mixed Japanese. Polynesian and Anglo
heritage. His bitterness and hatred of the rich white
tourists are evident throughout. Yamasaki's college
football career is cut short by an injurs'. The only
w oman he ever loved commits suicide, and Yamasaki

ends up in jail after a bar brawl. Like so many fine
Americans, the key provision in Yamasaki's release is
a tour of duty with the Marine Corps. We follow
Yamaski through boot camp at Parris Island and
eventually to the Vietnam War, where he is captured
during a raid on Laos. How Yamasaki's capture leads
to his drug connections and eventually to his posi
tion as chief of police is left for the reader to dis
cover.
"The Big Island" is fast, exciting and fun to read.
The nariative is told by Yamasaki in the first person.
The real bca'itv and humor of the novel is the sar
casm and cynicism of its protagonist. White attitudes,
the Mormon religion and all branches of the military
are lambasted with flair and biting wit. I figured that
after reading "The Big Island," I would know more
about its author than before I started. Bad assump
tion. Chief Yamasaki is so flippant and snide that the
reader must wait until the end of the book for even a
glimpse of human feeling.
Jeff admits that he identifies closely with Chief
Yamasaki, which is surprising; the two seem to have
little in common. While Jeff has a slender build,
Yamasaki weighs more than 260 pounds. Yamasaki's
mixture of nationalities and his minority status con
