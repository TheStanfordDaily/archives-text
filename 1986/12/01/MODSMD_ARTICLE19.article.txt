# Keep Vienna open
## 
### 
I was shocked when I read recently about the plan to close the Vienna Campus
(Daily, Nov. 10). I have taught at the Austrian campus on three different occasions
— once in the Semmering, twice in Vienna, at the Seillerstatte campus, and most
recently at the Luegerplatz location. In my opinion the cultural experience for
students and faculty in Vienna is superior to that of the Tours campus and British
campus when it was at Cliveden. Once before, in 1972, there were plans to close
the Austrian campus (it did close for one year), and I was on a program commit
tee that eventually reorganized the campus and reopened it in its present lega
tion. At that time also there was talk of there being need for only a single German
speaking campus and a sense in the German Department that if there were to be
a single German-speaking campus it should be located in Germany.

DOUGLAS RUSSELL

At that time I and others on the program committee argued that the cultural ex
perience to be gained in Vienna was superior to that at any other fully operational
campus at the time (there was no Paris program). Today, if one does make a com
parison between Berlin and Vienna — as Russell Berman (associate professor of
German) did in that article and Overseas Director Thomas Heller did in the
Campus Report (Nov. 12) — I totally disagree that Berlin is a superior city for
study. Vienna is the older city; it was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire when
Berlin was a rude village; it is the home of psychiatry and psychoanalysis; it is the
capital of music for all Europe; it is the cultural crossroads of East and West, North
and South, with a cultural mix that cannot be matched anywhere else in Europe.
It is the home of OPEC in Europe, the center for East/West meetings, the door to
Eastern Slavic Europe (since under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Vienna was the
capital of part of Poland, all of Czechoslovakia and Hungary and parts of modern
Yugoslavia) and far closer in historical-cultural ties and distance to the new pro
gram in Krakow than is Berlin. Heller cites Berlin's proximity to the East bloc as
a strong point in Berlin s favor. My response would be that Berlin has a proximity
only to East Germany — not Eastern Europe, and one has only to lcx>k at the map
to see which location is a more logical place from which to develop contacts and
programs related to Eastern Europe. Vienna is also a far more interesting and
varied city architecturally and artistically than is the almost completely modern
West Berlin. Particularly noteworthy are its baroque an dart nouveau art and ar
chitecture, some of the most interesting and unique in all Europe. Its theater is a
superb mixture of the best elements of realism, spectacle, music and fantasy, with
a state theater second only to the Comedie Francaise in age and reputation. It pos
sesses an opera that has the admiration of all Europe. One could go on and on,
but I do not think one can make the case that Berlin is a superior city culturally
for student study. On the other hand, I do not think there should be a contest be
tween the two, any more than I thought that there should have been a contest be
tween Vienna and Beutelsbach in 1972. Each German-speaking location is unique
and must be considered on its own merits, only one of which is its language.
If there are administrative problems with curriculum and attendance, they can
be easily remedied through the appropriate committee oversight of courses and
the proper promotion of the program. Possibly Stanford's undergraduates, who
are encouraged in their interest in technology and science and who often miss
opportunities to gain knowledge and appreciation for the historical past, do not
realize, unless it is made fully apparent to them, that Vienna is one of the best pro
gram locations in Europe. Just as the program committee in 1972 reorganized,
streamlined and promoted the new program in Vienna, the same should be
allowed to take place again before there is talk of closing the campus.
I sense political rivalry and prejudice behind the scenes, and I think a very
careful, open discussion of all campus programs abroad and their purposes
should be undertaken before the Vienna campus is summarily closed. I think a
survey of the students who have studied in Vienna would soon give a unani
mously positive response regarding the experience, as would also be the case
with a majority of the faculty. I urge Dean of Humanities and Sciences Carolyn
Lougee to halt the movement of events toward a June closure and to organize a
Vienna program committee to look into ways to reorganize and promote the pro
gram to make it one of the most valuable overseas locations.

programs related to Eastern Europe. Vienna is also a far more interesting and
varied city architecturally and artistically than is the almost completely modern
West Berlin. Particularly noteworthy are its baroque an dart nouveau art and ar
chitecture, some of the most interesting and unique in all Europe. Its theater is a
superb mixture of the best elements of realism, spectacle, music and fantasy, with
a state theater second only to the Comedie Francaise in age and reputation. It pos
sesses an opera that has the admiration of all Europe. One could go on and on,
but I do not think one can make the case that Berlin is a superior city culturally
for student study. On the other hand, I do not think there should be a contest be
tween the two, any more than I thought that there should have been a contest be
tween Vienna and Beutelsbach in 1972. Each German-speaking location is unique
and must be considered on its own merits, only one of which is its language.
If there are administrative problems with curriculum and attendance, they can
be easily remedied through the appropriate committee oversight of courses and
the proper promotion of the program. Possibly Stanford's undergraduates, who
are encouraged in their interest in technology and science and who often miss
opportunities to gain knowledge and appreciation for the historical past, do not
realize, unless it is made fully apparent to them, that Vienna is one of the best pro
gram locations in Europe. Just as the program committee in 1972 reorganized,
streamlined and promoted the new program in Vienna, the same should be
allowed to take place again before there is talk of closing the campus.
I sense political rivalry and prejudice behind the scenes, and I think a very
careful, open discussion of all campus programs abroad and their purposes
should be undertaken before the Vienna campus is summarily closed. I think a
survey of the students who have studied in Vienna would soon give a unani
mously positive response regarding the experience, as would also be the case
with a majority of the faculty. I urge Dean of Humanities and Sciences Carolyn
Lougee to halt the movement of events toward a June closure and to organize a
Vienna program committee to look into ways to reorganize and promote the pro
gram to make it one of the most valuable overseas locations.
