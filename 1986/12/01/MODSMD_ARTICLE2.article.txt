# Experts disagree on U.S. arms move
## 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Staff writer 
Soviet and foreign policy experts
here disagreed yesterday over the wis
dom of President Reagan's decision to
abandon the nuclear weapons ceilings
imposed by the second strategic arms
limitation treaty.
"The arms race is in danger of
breaking free" as a result of the deci
sion, History Prof. Barton Bernstein
said.
"Reagan will blame this on their (the
Soviets') breaking of treaties and he
will also try to use this to divert atten
tion from his own fiasco in Iran," he
said.
Richard Staar, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and editor of the In
ternational Yearbook on Communist
Affairs, disputed Bernstein's views and
said that it made no sense for the
United States to comply with a verbal
agreement to which the Soviets had
never fully adhered.
"I agree with President Reagan's
decision," Staar said. "If you continue
to ignore the repeated treaty violations
by the Soviets, how can you expect to
have their respect?"
The United States broke the 1979
SALT II treaty Friday when it deployed
a B-52 bomber equipped to carry
cruise missies at a Texas air base,
bringing the U.S. total of such bombers
to 131 and exceeding the limits
allowed by the treaty.
Although SALT II expired last
December and was never ratified by
Congress, it nevertheless had been fol

lowed — at least in form — by both
the United States and the Soviet Union
until Friday.
It limits the number of launchers for
intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs) to 1,320 for the United States.
In order to stay under that limit, the
United States has dismantled one
launcher for every one it has made
during the last seven years, disman
tling 48 launchers since 1979.
Reagan announced in May that the
United States would no longer comply
with SALT II because the Soviet Union
repeatedly violates the treaty.
Bernstein called the United States'
violation of the treaty limits "an unfor
tunate fact.... Even though this has
never been an official treaty, it has al
ways been a de facto agreement be
tween the countries."
"This is a very unfortunate move,"
agreed Sidney Drell, co-director of the
Center for International Security and
Arms Control. "I regret it deeply."
"1 just think this (decision) is not in
our interest," he said. "It is in our in
terest to not lead the Russians to in
creased numbers of weapons.
"There have been Russian violations
of other treaties, but we should extract
compensation from them in other
ways," he said.
According to Hoover Institution
Director W. Glenn Campbell, however,
"The Russians have been violating that
treaty for a long time, so it's really hard
to get excited about our exceeding a
limit by one."
