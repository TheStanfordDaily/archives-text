# DJs work dances throughout Bay Area
## 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Staff writer 
In October most Stanford students
went to classes, football games and
parties.
Seniors Jim Case, Mark Whipple, and
Eric Jacobsen did all of those things
that month. They also grossed more
than $6,500.
The source of their money was TNT
Enterprises, Northern California's larg

est self-contained mobile music show.
The explosively lucrative venture
had a modest beginning.
While freshmen in Otero, Case,
Whipple and Jacobsen decided to pro
vide music tor a few on-campus dorm
parties after the other two learned that
Case had been a disc jockey in high
school.
"I had done small parties at my high
school and had a small sound and light
set-up," Case explained. "But all I

mostly had to offer was the experi
ence."
That proved to be the only thing
Case needed when Whipple and Jacob
sen approached him.
"We talked for a while and decided
that to be successful we needed some
thing different to offer, something un
usual to give people a reason to come
to us instead of others," Case said.

"Video screens were just getting big
then (in early 1983) in night clubs, but
no DJs had them, so I thought a big
screen would be the thing to get,"
Whipple said.
So with the video screen and projec
tor provided by Whipple, Case's equip
ment and Jacobsen's stereo, TNT
sound was created.
It was the first mobile video system
in Northern California.
The three partners DJ'd all of the
first few parties themselves, with the
addition of music buyer Andy Metzger,
a senior who has been Case's
roommate since their freshman year.
"He's the only non-partner who's
been in since the beginning. I guess it's
son of a default since he's always been

my roommate," Case said.
TNT has expanded since then, and in
more ways than one.
In its three years of business, the
group has provided sounds at more
than 80 on-campus parties at Stanford.
But now TNT also does parties from
Fresno to Tahoe.
And in addition to playing at parties,
TNT is a licensed dealer for Carter
Electronics, makers of amplifiers and
tape decks, and for lighting systems.
TNT recently installed the light and
sound system at the Vortex club in Palo
Alto and supplied new lighting at Gar
field's, another local club.
TNT has grown to include 11 other
DJs who man the three full-size sys
tems and two sound setups that TNT
can now supply on any given night.

The full size "Dance Concert Sys
tems" owned by TNT contain two 10-
foot video screens, lasers, a 5,000-watt
sound system and four 10-foot-tall
lighting towers each holding 1,200
watts of lights.
With the inclusion of its new lasers,
TNT became the first mobile system
in California to have both video
screens and lasers. It also has the larg
est completely self-contained system.
To carry all the equipment and DJs,
TNT now has two vans and a 16-foot
diesel utility truck.
And instead of booking its own par
ties, TNT is now represented by three
different agents from all over Califor
nia, who provide the group with its
most lucrative parties, high school
proms and dances.

"The nice thing about high schools
is that they have enough money for a
band, but they don't want to risk get
ting a bad one or having to deal with
long breaks and short sets," Metzger
said. "So we provide a sort of middle
road — we are more impressive than a
DJ, but we can play all the music they
want to hear and we can go all night
without breaks."
TNT's success has not been without
its costs.
Case, who plans on continuing his
work with TNT after graduation, ex
plains: "1 easily spend more than 40
hours a week on TNT just booking par
ties and dealing with our accountants,
employees and parties," he said. "But I
really get satisfaction from it, or 1
wouldn't be doing it."

The full size "Dance Concert Sys
tems" owned by TNT contain two 10-
foot video screens, lasers, a 5,000-watt
sound system and four 10-foot-tall
lighting towers each holding 1,200
watts of lights.
With the inclusion of its new lasers,
TNT became the first mobile system
in California to have both video
screens and lasers. It also has the larg
est completely self-contained system.
To carry all the equipment and DJs,
TNT now has two vans and a 16-foot
diesel utility truck.
And instead of booking its own par
ties, TNT is now represented by three
different agents from all over Califor
nia, who provide the group with its
most lucrative parties, high school
proms and dances.

"The nice thing about high schools
is that they have enough money for a
band, but they don't want to risk get
ting a bad one or having to deal with
long breaks and short sets," Metzger
said. "So we provide a sort of middle
road — we are more impressive than a
DJ, but we can play all the music they
want to hear and we can go all night
without breaks."
TNT's success has not been without
its costs.
Case, who plans on continuing his
work with TNT after graduation, ex
plains: "1 easily spend more than 40
hours a week on TNT just booking par
ties and dealing with our accountants,
employees and parties," he said. "But I
really get satisfaction from it, or 1
wouldn't be doing it."
