ended the year prior to the NCAAs
at 33-0. In addition, Stanford set a new-
NCAA mark for consecutive wins with
42.
Entering the NCAAs over Thanksgiv
ing weekend, the Cardinal had
achieved its first goal of an undefeated
regular season.
And yesterday, at the Belmont Plaza
Olympic Pool here, Stanford com
pleted its dream season by defeating
No. 2-seeded California in the title
game 9-6 to win the NCAA champion
ship.
The title was the second straight for
the Cardinal and the sixth in Stanford's
history. Only Cal has won as many
titles as the Cardinal.
"It just says something for our pro
gram at Stanford," Dettamanti said. "I
am really happy for these guys. They
will go down as one of the great teams
in NCAA history."
Not only did Stanford win the NCAA
title, finish the season at 36-0 and ex
tend its win streak to 45 games, but it
utterly annihilated the rest of the field.
Friday, Stanford obliterated No. 8-
seeded Air Force 23-5 in the first
round. In the semifinals Saturday, the
Cardinal jumped out to a commanding
10-1 halftime lead over No. 4-seeded
Pepperdine on its way to a 15-8 victory'.
"They (Stanford) play together cer
tainly as well as any team I have ever
seen," Pepperdine Coach Terry
Schroeder said after that game.
But it was the final game that cul
minated the Cardinal's seaon. Despite

Cal's best game of the season against
Stanford, the Cardinal was not to be
denied.
After falling behind three times in
the first half, Stanford tied Cal 5-5 at
halftime.
"We had them pretty good," Cal
Coach Pete Cutino said. "1 was pleased
with our performance. Our guys gave
the game an all-out effort."
After the lead changed hands four
times in the first half, the Cardinal took
control in the third period. Sopho
more goalie Todd Kemp was inserted
in the lineup and only allowed one
goal in the second half. Kemp also per
mitted only one goal against Pep
perdine in the semifinals.
"Todd played great," Dettamanti
said. "1 feel he was clearly the best
goalie in the tournament."
The Cardinal, powered by senior All-
America Craig Klass' third and fourth
goals of the game, outscored the Bears
3-0 in the third period and never
looked back.
"1 think he (Klass) was the differ
ence," Cutino said. "We had a few mis
matches against him down in the hole.
He did an excellent job."
The Cardinal scored on five of its
seven 6-on-5 situations while the Bears
only scored on 3-of-ll man-up situa
tions.
Senior Greg Ocasek's second goal of
the game in the fourth quarter pushed
Stanford's lead to an insurmountable
9-5. Cal scored once in the game's
closing minutes to bring the score to
its final 9-6 margin.
"It (the title) feels so good," senior
David Imbernino said. "And it's all be
cause of the players I play with. These
guys mean a lot to me."

Junior Erich Fischer, Klass and Im
bernino were all selected to the All
tournament first team. Fischer and Im
bernino scored six goals each in the
tournament, with Klass amassing 10
goals in the three games.
"The second time was sweeter than
the first," Fischer said of the title. "It
feels great. Everyone is on cloud nine."
Both Fischer and Klass ended the
season with 87 goals, each setting a
new Stanford single-season scoring

29-17 lead.
"It (the shoulder) really started to tighten
up on me in the second half with the cold
weather," Paye said, referring to the 46-
degree temperature. "I thought that if I stayed
in, I couldn't do the job anymore."
"John just didn't have any zing on the ball,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said, "so we
brought in Greg. He came in and showed a lot
of poise." Elway added that the decision to
come out was Paye's.
"For the past three weeks, I've been
looking for a chance to play," Ennis said. "I've
had to prepare myself, and it felt really good
to get into the game and play. On the first se
ries, I was really nervous, but Brian Morris
helped calm me down. It was like practice
after that."
Ennis had already completed a pass before
Paye went out, however. The holder for field
goals, Ennis pickefl up the ball on an apparent
21-yard attempt by David Sweeney, rolled
right and found tight end Jim Price at the back
of the end zone to give Stanford a 16-7 lead
early in the second quarter.
"Yeah, we planned to do that today," Elway
said. "I was going to do that at Cal last week,
too. I guess I neglected to do it."
While Elway pulled out a few more stops
than usual, he was able yet again to rely on
running back Brad Muster for another steady
performance. Muster carried 27 times for 108
yards and Stanford's first touchdown, a 21-
yard off-tackle run he broke outside to tie the
game at 7-7 midway through the first quarter.
Muster finished the season with 1,053
yards, becoming only the second Stanford
player ever to rush for 1,000 yards in a season.
Darrin Nelson, who holds the single-season
record of 1,069 yards, turned the trick three
times.
The Gator Bowl game against Clemson will
not count toward any Stanford records.
"I think it's a tribute to the offensive line,"
said Muster, who is the only back to rush for
more than 100 yards against Arizona this
season. "We haven't had a running back do
that in a long time, and it's a tribute to them."

record. The old record of 82 goals was
held by James Bergeson (1981).
Senior Greg Gamble and Kemp
were chosen for the all-tournament
second team, and Ocasek was an
honorable-mention pick.
"It really hasn't hit in yet," Gamble
said of the championship. "I don't
think it will hit in until I sit down and
think about it for awhile."
The key to winning the title,
however, was the play of Klass. He

Stanford is 8-0 this year in games in which
Muster has rushed for more than 60 yards.
The Stanford defense was as reliable as it
has been all season, giving up only one sus
tained touchdown drive late in the fourth
quarter. That march was capped by an 11-yard
touchdown catch by wide receiver Branch
McNeal with 2:42 to play that cut Stanford's
lead to 29-24.
When the Wildcats got the ball back with
1:38 to go for a shot at the winning score, it
was linebacker David Wyman who stepped in
front of Jeff Fairholm for his third intercep
tion of the season to ice the victory'.
"I think we had a little more pressure on
us," said cornerback Toi Cook, who had his
seventh interception of the season yesterday.
"There was no way we were going back
losers."
"Defensively, this was typical of the kind of
play we've exhibited all year," Elway said. "We
played hard and with intensity the entire foot
ball game."
Elway had his team on a regimented
schedule designed to overcome the 17-hour
time difference between Stanford and Tokyo.
While the players did get out some before the
game, they went to bed at 7 p.m. Thursday
after arrival, then had a 9 p.m. curfew Friday
and an 11 p.m. curfew Saturday.
On the other side, Arizona's players were
spotted by several writers in some of the
more disreputable sections of Tokyo long
after the Stanford players had called it an
evening.
"They can have fun now," Elway said of his
charges after the game. "They were real fresh
and had their legs today. I don't think they'll
be in bed early tonight."
"In our minds, we came to play a football
game," Muster said. "Arizona was the first
thing on our mind. Now we're going to party
Tokyo-style — like Arizona's done all week."
"It's a long way to come to sit in a hotel
room," Morris said, "but for the seniors, we
had only two games left, period. We wanted to
be at full speed."
The Cardinal will be able to enjoy Tokyo
today and tomorrow before flying home to
morrow evening. Arizona safety Chuck Cecil,
though, didn't think pregame routines had
anything to do with his team's loss.
"Anybody who thinks that is a crock. Stan-

scored two of the Cardinal's three
goals in the pivotal third period and
was the one player the Bears could not
defend against.

as the tournament tri-MVPs.

ford had as much leisure time as we did," he
said.
It looked like rest would be unimportant at
first when Stanford's Thomas Henley fumbled
the opening kickoff and Chris Singleton
recovered for Arizona on the Stanford 9.
Henley was playing with a dislocated elbow
he suffered a week ago against California. "It's
sore as heck," Henley said afterward. "It gave
me a lot of problems out there."
Tailback David Adams, who was held to 49
yards on the afternoon, fumbled two plays
later, but guard Val Bichekas recovered in the
end zone 50 seconds into the game.
After Muster tied the game, Arizona gave
Coston a shot at a 37-yard field goal, but Ben
nett broke through for the block.
"Ray Huckestein and Paul Svitenko spread
the guys and I just ran through the center
guard gap on the right side. Huckestein
smashed the center, and there was a gap that I
ran through," Bennett said.
Stanford was forced to punt, but Derek Hill
fielded Doug Robison's kick for Arizona on
his 6-yard line, went backward and was caught
by Kevin Richardson and Rob Hinckley for a
safety.
"He might not have seen the line," Richard
son said. "They weren't painted well. He tried
to outrun the coverage, but we tackled well
on special teams."
For the first time since 1978, the end of the
regular season is not the end of the football
season for Stanford. The Cardinal will face At
lantic Coast Conference champion Clemson
in the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., Dec.
27.
"It feels great now going into the Gator
Bowl like this, not in through the back door,"
Elway said. "I haven't given Clemson one bit
of thought — yet. I'm going to enjoy Tokvo a
little bit before I worry about that. I can tell
you one thing, though; we're going to kick
Clemson's ass."
Card notes
Paye moved into second place on the Stanford
career passing offense list, finishing with 7,669
yards. He moved past Jim Plunkett in the Arizona
game. John Elway remains first on the list with
9,349 career passing yards.
Wyman was credited unofficially with 11 tackles,
giving him 165 for the season.

Elway had his team on a regimented

time difference between Stanford and Tokyo.
While the players did get out some before the
game, they went to bed at 7 p.m. Thursday
after arrival, then had a 9 p.m. curfew Friday
and an 11 p.m. curfew Saturday.
On the other side, Arizona's players were
spotted by several writers in some of the
more disreputable sections of Tokyo long
after the Stanford players had called it an
evening.
"They can have fun now," Elway said of his
charges after the game. "They were real fresh
and had their legs today. I don't think they'll
be in bed early tonight."
"In our minds, we came to play a football

"It's a long way to come to sit in a hotel

Henley was playing with a dislocated elbow
he suffered a week ago against California. "It's
sore as heck," Henley said afterward. "It gave
me a lot of problems out there."
Tailback David Adams, who was held to 49
yards on the afternoon, fumbled two plays
later, but guard Val Bichekas recovered in the
end zone 50 seconds into the game.
After Muster tied the game, Arizona gave
Coston a shot at a 37-yard field goal, but Ben

"Ray Huckestein and Paul Svitenko spread

smashed the center, and there was a gap that I
ran through," Bennett said.
Stanford was forced to punt, but Derek Hill
fielded Doug Robison's kick for Arizona on
his 6-yard line, went backward and was caught
by Kevin Richardson and Rob Hinckley for a
safety.
"He might not have seen the line," Richard

With his 108-yard performance in the Cardinal's 29-24 victory over Arizona yesterday in Tokyo
(Saturday California time), Stanford running back Brad Muster became the second back in the
school's history to run for more than 1,000 yards in a single season.

ended the year prior to the NCAAs
at 33-0. In addition, Stanford set a new-
NCAA mark for consecutive wins with
42.
Entering the NCAAs over Thanksgiv
ing weekend, the Cardinal had
achieved its first goal of an undefeated
regular season.
And yesterday, at the Belmont Plaza
Olympic Pool here, Stanford com
pleted its dream season by defeating
No. 2-seeded California in the title
game 9-6 to win the NCAA champion
ship.
The title was the second straight for
the Cardinal and the sixth in Stanford's
history. Only Cal has won as many
titles as the Cardinal.
"It just says something for our pro
gram at Stanford," Dettamanti said. "I
am really happy for these guys. They
will go down as one of the great teams
in NCAA history."
Not only did Stanford win the NCAA
title, finish the season at 36-0 and ex
tend its win streak to 45 games, but it
utterly annihilated the rest of the field.
Friday, Stanford obliterated No. 8-
seeded Air Force 23-5 in the first
round. In the semifinals Saturday, the
Cardinal jumped out to a commanding
10-1 halftime lead over No. 4-seeded
Pepperdine on its way to a 15-8 victory'.
"They (Stanford) play together cer
tainly as well as any team I have ever
seen," Pepperdine Coach Terry
Schroeder said after that game.
But it was the final game that cul
minated the Cardinal's seaon. Despite

Cal's best game of the season against
Stanford, the Cardinal was not to be
denied.
After falling behind three times in
the first half, Stanford tied Cal 5-5 at
halftime.
"We had them pretty good," Cal
Coach Pete Cutino said. "1 was pleased
with our performance. Our guys gave
the game an all-out effort."
After the lead changed hands four
times in the first half, the Cardinal took
control in the third period. Sopho
more goalie Todd Kemp was inserted
in the lineup and only allowed one
goal in the second half. Kemp also per
mitted only one goal against Pep
perdine in the semifinals.
"Todd played great," Dettamanti
said. "1 feel he was clearly the best
goalie in the tournament."
The Cardinal, powered by senior All-
America Craig Klass' third and fourth
goals of the game, outscored the Bears
3-0 in the third period and never
looked back.
"1 think he (Klass) was the differ
ence," Cutino said. "We had a few mis
matches against him down in the hole.
He did an excellent job."
The Cardinal scored on five of its
seven 6-on-5 situations while the Bears
only scored on 3-of-ll man-up situa
tions.
Senior Greg Ocasek's second goal of
the game in the fourth quarter pushed
Stanford's lead to an insurmountable
9-5. Cal scored once in the game's
closing minutes to bring the score to
its final 9-6 margin.
"It (the title) feels so good," senior
David Imbernino said. "And it's all be
cause of the players I play with. These
guys mean a lot to me."

Junior Erich Fischer, Klass and Im
bernino were all selected to the All
tournament first team. Fischer and Im
bernino scored six goals each in the
tournament, with Klass amassing 10
goals in the three games.
"The second time was sweeter than
the first," Fischer said of the title. "It
feels great. Everyone is on cloud nine."
Both Fischer and Klass ended the
season with 87 goals, each setting a
new Stanford single-season scoring

29-17 lead.
"It (the shoulder) really started to tighten
up on me in the second half with the cold
weather," Paye said, referring to the 46-
degree temperature. "I thought that if I stayed
in, I couldn't do the job anymore."
"John just didn't have any zing on the ball,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said, "so we
brought in Greg. He came in and showed a lot
of poise." Elway added that the decision to
come out was Paye's.
"For the past three weeks, I've been
looking for a chance to play," Ennis said. "I've
had to prepare myself, and it felt really good
to get into the game and play. On the first se
ries, I was really nervous, but Brian Morris
helped calm me down. It was like practice
after that."
Ennis had already completed a pass before
Paye went out, however. The holder for field
goals, Ennis pickefl up the ball on an apparent
21-yard attempt by David Sweeney, rolled
right and found tight end Jim Price at the back
of the end zone to give Stanford a 16-7 lead
early in the second quarter.
"Yeah, we planned to do that today," Elway
said. "I was going to do that at Cal last week,
too. I guess I neglected to do it."
While Elway pulled out a few more stops
than usual, he was able yet again to rely on
running back Brad Muster for another steady
performance. Muster carried 27 times for 108
yards and Stanford's first touchdown, a 21-
yard off-tackle run he broke outside to tie the
game at 7-7 midway through the first quarter.
Muster finished the season with 1,053
yards, becoming only the second Stanford
player ever to rush for 1,000 yards in a season.
Darrin Nelson, who holds the single-season
record of 1,069 yards, turned the trick three
times.
The Gator Bowl game against Clemson will
not count toward any Stanford records.
"I think it's a tribute to the offensive line,"
said Muster, who is the only back to rush for
more than 100 yards against Arizona this
season. "We haven't had a running back do
that in a long time, and it's a tribute to them."

record. The old record of 82 goals was
held by James Bergeson (1981).
Senior Greg Gamble and Kemp
were chosen for the all-tournament
second team, and Ocasek was an
honorable-mention pick.
"It really hasn't hit in yet," Gamble
said of the championship. "I don't
think it will hit in until I sit down and
think about it for awhile."
The key to winning the title,
however, was the play of Klass. He

Stanford is 8-0 this year in games in which
Muster has rushed for more than 60 yards.
The Stanford defense was as reliable as it
has been all season, giving up only one sus
tained touchdown drive late in the fourth
quarter. That march was capped by an 11-yard
touchdown catch by wide receiver Branch
McNeal with 2:42 to play that cut Stanford's
lead to 29-24.
When the Wildcats got the ball back with
1:38 to go for a shot at the winning score, it
was linebacker David Wyman who stepped in
front of Jeff Fairholm for his third intercep
tion of the season to ice the victory'.
"I think we had a little more pressure on
us," said cornerback Toi Cook, who had his
seventh interception of the season yesterday.
"There was no way we were going back
losers."
"Defensively, this was typical of the kind of
play we've exhibited all year," Elway said. "We
played hard and with intensity the entire foot
ball game."
Elway had his team on a regimented

The Cardinal scored on five of its
seven 6-on-5 situations while the Bears
only scored on 3-of-ll man-up situa

Senior Greg Ocasek's second goal of
the game in the fourth quarter pushed
Stanford's lead to an insurmountable
9-5. Cal scored once in the game's
closing minutes to bring the score to
its final 9-6 margin.
"It (the title) feels so good," senior
David Imbernino said. "And it's all be
cause of the players I play with. These
guys mean a lot to me."

Junior Erich Fischer, Klass and Im
bernino were all selected to the All
tournament first team. Fischer and Im
bernino scored six goals each in the
tournament, with Klass amassing 10
goals in the three games.
"The second time was sweeter than
the first," Fischer said of the title. "It
feels great. Everyone is on cloud nine."
Both Fischer and Klass ended the
season with 87 goals, each setting a
new Stanford single-season scoring

29-17 lead.
"It (the shoulder) really started to tighten
up on me in the second half with the cold
weather," Paye said, referring to the 46-
degree temperature. "I thought that if I stayed

"John just didn't have any zing on the ball,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said, "so we
brought in Greg. He came in and showed a lot
of poise." Elway added that the decision to
come out was Paye's.
"For the past three weeks, I've been
looking for a chance to play," Ennis said. "I've
had to prepare myself, and it felt really good
to get into the game and play. On the first se
ries, I was really nervous, but Brian Morris
helped calm me down. It was like practice
after that."
Ennis had already completed a pass before
Paye went out, however. The holder for field
goals, Ennis pickefl up the ball on an apparent
21-yard attempt by David Sweeney, rolled
right and found tight end Jim Price at the back
of the end zone to give Stanford a 16-7 lead
early in the second quarter.
"Yeah, we planned to do that today," Elway
said. "I was going to do that at Cal last week,
too. I guess I neglected to do it."
While Elway pulled out a few more stops
than usual, he was able yet again to rely on
running back Brad Muster for another steady
performance. Muster carried 27 times for 108
yards and Stanford's first touchdown, a 21-
yard off-tackle run he broke outside to tie the
game at 7-7 midway through the first quarter.
Muster finished the season with 1,053
yards, becoming only the second Stanford
player ever to rush for 1,000 yards in a season.
Darrin Nelson, who holds the single-season
record of 1,069 yards, turned the trick three
times.
The Gator Bowl game against Clemson will
not count toward any Stanford records.
"I think it's a tribute to the offensive line,"

more than 100 yards against Arizona this
season. "We haven't had a running back do
that in a long time, and it's a tribute to them."

Muster has rushed for more than 60 yards.
The Stanford defense was as reliable as it
has been all season, giving up only one sus

quarter. That march was capped by an 11-yard
touchdown catch by wide receiver Branch
McNeal with 2:42 to play that cut Stanford's
lead to 29-24.
When the Wildcats got the ball back with
1:38 to go for a shot at the winning score, it
was linebacker David Wyman who stepped in

"I think we had a little more pressure on

seventh interception of the season yesterday.
"There was no way we were going back

"Defensively, this was typical of the kind of

Elway had his team on a regimented
schedule designed to overcome the 17-hour
time difference between Stanford and Tokyo.
While the players did get out some before the
game, they went to bed at 7 p.m. Thursday
after arrival, then had a 9 p.m. curfew Friday
and an 11 p.m. curfew Saturday.
On the other side, Arizona's players were
spotted by several writers in some of the
more disreputable sections of Tokyo long
after the Stanford players had called it an
evening.
"They can have fun now," Elway said of his
charges after the game. "They were real fresh
and had their legs today. I don't think they'll

"In our minds, we came to play a football

"It's a long way to come to sit in a hotel

he suffered a week ago against California. "It's

me a lot of problems out there."
Tailback David Adams, who was held to 49
yards on the afternoon, fumbled two plays
later, but guard Val Bichekas recovered in the
end zone 50 seconds into the game.
After Muster tied the game, Arizona gave
Coston a shot at a 37-yard field goal, but Ben

"Ray Huckestein and Paul Svitenko spread
the guys and I just ran through the center
guard gap on the right side. Huckestein
smashed the center, and there was a gap that I
ran through," Bennett said.
Stanford was forced to punt, but Derek Hill
fielded Doug Robison's kick for Arizona on
his 6-yard line, went backward and was caught
by Kevin Richardson and Rob Hinckley for a
safety.
"He might not have seen the line," Richard
son said. "They weren't painted well. He tried
to outrun the coverage, but we tackled well
on special teams."
For the first time since 1978, the end of the
regular season is not the end of the football
season for Stanford. The Cardinal will face At
lantic Coast Conference champion Clemson
in the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., Dec.
27.
"It feels great now going into the Gator
Bowl like this, not in through the back door,"
Elway said. "I haven't given Clemson one bit
of thought — yet. I'm going to enjoy Tokvo a
little bit before I worry about that. I can tell
you one thing, though; we're going to kick
Clemson's ass."

Paye moved into second place on the Stanford

at 33-0. In addition, Stanford set a new-
NCAA mark for consecutive wins with
42.
Entering the NCAAs over Thanksgiv
ing weekend, the Cardinal had
achieved its first goal of an undefeated
regular season.
And yesterday, at the Belmont Plaza
Olympic Pool here, Stanford com
pleted its dream season by defeating
No. 2-seeded California in the title
game 9-6 to win the NCAA champion
ship.
The title was the second straight for
the Cardinal and the sixth in Stanford's
history. Only Cal has won as many
titles as the Cardinal.
"It just says something for our pro
gram at Stanford," Dettamanti said. "I
am really happy for these guys. They
will go down as one of the great teams
in NCAA history."
Not only did Stanford win the NCAA
title, finish the season at 36-0 and ex
tend its win streak to 45 games, but it
utterly annihilated the rest of the field.
Friday, Stanford obliterated No. 8-
seeded Air Force 23-5 in the first
round. In the semifinals Saturday, the
Cardinal jumped out to a commanding
10-1 halftime lead over No. 4-seeded
Pepperdine on its way to a 15-8 victory'.
"They (Stanford) play together cer
tainly as well as any team I have ever
seen," Pepperdine Coach Terry
Schroeder said after that game.
But it was the final game that cul
minated the Cardinal's seaon. Despite

Cal's best game of the season against
Stanford, the Cardinal was not to be
denied.
After falling behind three times in
the first half, Stanford tied Cal 5-5 at
halftime.
"We had them pretty good," Cal
Coach Pete Cutino said. "1 was pleased
with our performance. Our guys gave
the game an all-out effort."
After the lead changed hands four
times in the first half, the Cardinal took
control in the third period. Sopho
more goalie Todd Kemp was inserted
in the lineup and only allowed one
goal in the second half. Kemp also per
mitted only one goal against Pep
perdine in the semifinals.
"Todd played great," Dettamanti
said. "1 feel he was clearly the best
goalie in the tournament."
The Cardinal, powered by senior All-
America Craig Klass' third and fourth
goals of the game, outscored the Bears
3-0 in the third period and never
looked back.
"1 think he (Klass) was the differ
ence," Cutino said. "We had a few mis
matches against him down in the hole.
He did an excellent job."

seven 6-on-5 situations while the Bears

"Ray Huckestein and Paul Svitenko spread
the guys and I just ran through the center
guard gap on the right side. Huckestein
smashed the center, and there was a gap that I
ran through," Bennett said.
Stanford was forced to punt, but Derek Hill
fielded Doug Robison's kick for Arizona on
his 6-yard line, went backward and was caught
by Kevin Richardson and Rob Hinckley for a
safety.
"He might not have seen the line," Richard
son said. "They weren't painted well. He tried
to outrun the coverage, but we tackled well
on special teams."
For the first time since 1978, the end of the
regular season is not the end of the football
season for Stanford. The Cardinal will face At
lantic Coast Conference champion Clemson
in the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., Dec.
27.
"It feels great now going into the Gator
Bowl like this, not in through the back door,"
Elway said. "I haven't given Clemson one bit
of thought — yet. I'm going to enjoy Tokvo a
little bit before I worry about that. I can tell
you one thing, though; we're going to kick
Clemson's ass."
