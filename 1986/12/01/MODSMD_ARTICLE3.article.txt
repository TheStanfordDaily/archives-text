# Card wins 2nd straight title
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
LONG BEACH — At the begin
ning of the year, the defending na
tional champion Stanford men's
water polo team had just two goals
— to go undefeated and to win the
NCAA championships. In short, the
Cardinal dreamed of a perfect
season.
Few teams in any sport can even
entertain such thoughts, but many
felt that this squad was capable of
turning its dream into reality. It
would not be easy, but they were at
tainable achievements for a team
that was coming off an NCAA title in
1985 and that returned virtually all
of its key performers from a year
ago.
"These guys have won the NCAAs
before," Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti said on Oct. 2 when the
Cardinal was 15-0. "The great teams
win back-to-back. The motivation
for these guys is to win the NCAAs
and to go undefeated."
Fulfilling and even surpassing its
preseason promise, the Cardinal
went through the regular season in
dominant fashion, holding the No. 1
ranking for the entire season. It
only fell behind in a game twice
(against Pepperdine and USC) and
