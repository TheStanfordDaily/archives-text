# Taylor's three-pointer bounces off the front rim at buzzer
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
As expected, Stanford went 1-1 and finished third
in the Central Fidelity Invitational this weekend at
Richmond, Va., hut the Cardinal basketball team's
performance was anything but ho-hum.
In Coach Mike Montgomery's debut, Stanford
turned in two impressive showings. The Cardinal
methodically routed Rice 72-52 in Saturday's consola
tion game and came only inches away from upsetting
sixth-ranked Georgia Tech on Friday, as Terry
Taylor's 25-foot three-point attempt at the buzzer fell
short to preserve a 67-65 Yellowjacket win.
Georgia Tech was not able to escape an upset the
following night in the championship game against
host Richmond, falling 67-62 in overtime to the
Spiders.
Like Georgia Tech, Richmond got a scare in the
first round. The Spiders trailed Rice by as many as 14
points in the second half, but five straight three
pointers got them back in it. Richmond finally tri
umphed 73-66.
Had Taylor's shot gone in, it would have capped a
determined comeback that saw Stanford rally from a
16-point deficit in the game's final nine minutes. The
Cardinal had whittled a seven-point Yellowjacket
halftime lead down to three with 15:23 left, but
Duane Ferrell led a 17-4 Georgia Tech spurt with 12
of his game-high 29 points to put the Yellowjackets
ahead 59-43 with 9:08 to play.
' Ferrell was getting loose in our zone by coming
from the low post up to the high post," Montgomery
said. "He shot the ball extremely well, which we
didn't expect."
The next surprise, however, was on Georgia Tech
Montgomery, gambling that his big men could hold

their own against the Yellowjackets' powerful front
line of Ferrell, Tom Hammonds and Antoine Ford,
took the Cardinal out of its 3-2 zone and went to
man-to-man defense.
The result was a 21-6 Stanford run that brought the
Cardinal to within a point at 65-64 with 1:33 remain
ing. Todd Lichti led the surge with 10 of his team
high 17 points.
"The thing we did well is that we bounced back,"
Montgomery said. "We played them straight-up,
nose-to-nose, to get back in the game."
After Ford made two free throws, Howard Wright
hit one with 52 seconds left to keep Stanford within
two. Georgia Tech ran the clock inside 10 seconds,
but Stanford forced Bruce Dalrymple into a tough 18-
foot baseline jumper as the 45-second clock expired.
Eric Reveno grabbed the rebound, but had trouble
finding Taylor. Taylor Finally got the ball near mid
court, then dribbled straight toward the basket
before pulling up and Firing with about two seconds
remaining.
His shot was on line, but hit the front rim and
bounced away.
"When I shot it, I thought it was in," Taylor said. "I
was ready to celebrate because it felt so good coming
out of my hand. When it hit the rim. it just about
killed me."
Despite the disappointing ending, the sophomore
point guard was generally encouraged by the Card
inal's performance. We showed we can play with the
best in the country," Taylor said
Before the game, however, Stanford wasn't quite
as certain. We didn't know what to expect from
Georgia Tech," Montgomery said. "They're very im
posing, with all those great athletes and big names."
"We were a little intimidated, whether we like to
admit it or not," guard Novian Whitsitt said.

Once the game started, though, the Cardinal's con
fidence grew. "Going in, we weren't sure how we
would do facing the caliber of team that Georgia
Tech poses," Taylor said. "They looked dominating,
with all those big guys and big names. But when we
started playing, we started thinking we could play
with them."
Besides Ferrell, only Ford was able to hurt Stan
ford, scoring 12 points and yanking down 13
rebounds. The Cardinal held Georgia Tech stars
Hammonds and Dalrymple to 12 points on 5-for-18
shooting.
Wright played a strong game inside, with 14 points
and 12 rebounds. Stanford also got production from
its bench, as Reveno scored a career-high 13 points
while guard Scott Meinert chipped in nine.
Montgomery was worried that Friday's close call
might result in a letdown on Saturday against Rice,
but after a slow start, the Cardinal dominated the out
manned Owls.
The game was tied at 10 after nine minutes, but
Lichti and Whitsitt scored all the points in an 11-2 run
that led Stanford to a 31-22 halftime lead.
The Cardinal more or less ended any remaining
suspense when it scored the first six points of the
second half. Stanford then slowly extended its lead,
which twice reached 25 points.
"Compared to us, they really didn't have that good
a team," Taylor said. They really only had one stud,
and we took him out of the game early."
That one stud was 6-3 forward Greg Hines, a
second-team 1985-86 All-Southwest Conference se
lection. Hines averaged 16.7 points per game last
year, but Stanford used a diamond-and-one defense
(four men playing zone and one playing man-to-

admit it or not," guard Novian Whitsitt said.

Once the game started, though, the Cardinal's con
fidence grew. "Going in, we weren't sure how we
would do facing the caliber of team that Georgia
Tech poses," Taylor said. "They looked dominating,
with all those big guys and big names. But when we
started playing, we started thinking we could play
with them."
Besides Ferrell, only Ford was able to hurt Stan
ford, scoring 12 points and yanking down 13
rebounds. The Cardinal held Georgia Tech stars
Hammonds and Dalrymple to 12 points on 5-for-18
shooting.
Wright played a strong game inside, with 14 points
and 12 rebounds. Stanford also got production from
its bench, as Reveno scored a career-high 13 points
while guard Scott Meinert chipped in nine.
Montgomery was worried that Friday's close call
might result in a letdown on Saturday against Rice,
but after a slow start, the Cardinal dominated the out
manned Owls.
The game was tied at 10 after nine minutes, but
Lichti and Whitsitt scored all the points in an 11-2 run
that led Stanford to a 31-22 halftime lead.
The Cardinal more or less ended any remaining
suspense when it scored the first six points of the
second half. Stanford then slowly extended its lead,
which twice reached 25 points.
"Compared to us, they really didn't have that good
a team," Taylor said. They really only had one stud,
and we took him out of the game early."
That one stud was 6-3 forward Greg Hines, a
second-team 1985-86 All-Southwest Conference se
lection. Hines averaged 16.7 points per game last
year, but Stanford used a diamond-and-one defense

Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti was all business as the Cardinal fought off a late Pepperdine surge in Saturday's
semifinal game, but Dettamanti and the Cardinal had little to worry about most of the weekend as the team
captured its second consecutive NCAA water polo championship, winning the final game 9-6 over California.
As expected, Stanford went 1-1 and finished third
in the Central Fidelity Invitational this weekend at
Richmond, Va., hut the Cardinal basketball team's
performance was anything but ho-hum.
In Coach Mike Montgomery's debut, Stanford
turned in two impressive showings. The Cardinal
methodically routed Rice 72-52 in Saturday's consola
tion game and came only inches away from upsetting
sixth-ranked Georgia Tech on Friday, as Terry
Taylor's 25-foot three-point attempt at the buzzer fell
short to preserve a 67-65 Yellowjacket win.
Georgia Tech was not able to escape an upset the
following night in the championship game against
host Richmond, falling 67-62 in overtime to the
Spiders.
Like Georgia Tech, Richmond got a scare in the
first round. The Spiders trailed Rice by as many as 14
points in the second half, but five straight three
pointers got them back in it. Richmond finally tri
umphed 73-66.
Had Taylor's shot gone in, it would have capped a
determined comeback that saw Stanford rally from a
16-point deficit in the game's final nine minutes. The
Cardinal had whittled a seven-point Yellowjacket
halftime lead down to three with 15:23 left, but
Duane Ferrell led a 17-4 Georgia Tech spurt with 12
of his game-high 29 points to put the Yellowjackets
ahead 59-43 with 9:08 to play.
' Ferrell was getting loose in our zone by coming
from the low post up to the high post," Montgomery
said. "He shot the ball extremely well, which we
didn't expect."
The next surprise, however, was on Georgia Tech
Montgomery, gambling that his big men could hold

their own against the Yellowjackets' powerful front
line of Ferrell, Tom Hammonds and Antoine Ford,
took the Cardinal out of its 3-2 zone and went to
man-to-man defense.
The result was a 21-6 Stanford run that brought the
Cardinal to within a point at 65-64 with 1:33 remain
ing. Todd Lichti led the surge with 10 of his team
high 17 points.
"The thing we did well is that we bounced back,"
Montgomery said. "We played them straight-up,
nose-to-nose, to get back in the game."
After Ford made two free throws, Howard Wright
hit one with 52 seconds left to keep Stanford within
two. Georgia Tech ran the clock inside 10 seconds,
but Stanford forced Bruce Dalrymple into a tough 18-
foot baseline jumper as the 45-second clock expired.
Eric Reveno grabbed the rebound, but had trouble
finding Taylor. Taylor Finally got the ball near mid
court, then dribbled straight toward the basket
before pulling up and Firing with about two seconds
remaining.
His shot was on line, but hit the front rim and
bounced away.
"When I shot it, I thought it was in," Taylor said. "I
was ready to celebrate because it felt so good coming
out of my hand. When it hit the rim. it just about
killed me."
Despite the disappointing ending, the sophomore
point guard was generally encouraged by the Card
inal's performance. We showed we can play with the
best in the country," Taylor said
Before the game, however, Stanford wasn't quite
as certain. We didn't know what to expect from
Georgia Tech," Montgomery said. "They're very im
posing, with all those great athletes and big names."
"We were a little intimidated, whether we like to
admit it or not," guard Novian Whitsitt said.
