# Spikers to battle Oregon
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
In a season of ups and downs, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
once again received some good news
and some bad news.
The good news is the Cardinal will
be competing in its sixth consecutive
NCAA tournament. The bad news is it
will have to go to Oregon next
weekend to begin.
The last time the Cardinal traveled to
Oregon's McArthur Court, on Sept. 20,
the team dropped a tough five-game
match to the Ducks. This time, the
Cardinal needs a win to advance to the
West regional.
Stanford is seeded third in the eight
team region, while Oregon is seeded
sixth. Normally, the higher-seeded
team gets the home-court advantage,
but, because the Apple Invitational bas
ketball tournament will occupy Maples
Pavilion next weekend, the match can
not be played here.
"It's really frustrating," Stanford co
captain Brooke Hahner said about
playing away from home. "It puts a lot
of pressure on us, but we have a lot of
confidence."
The Cardinal, ranked 11th in the na
tion, should be favored over the 15th
ranked Ducks, but no one is looking at
this match as a vacation.
"Oregon will provide more than a

good test," Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said.
The Ducks boast the hitting of Teri
Kramer and Michele Krebsbach —
both of whom have spent most of the
year in the national top 10 in kills
average — as well as the talents of na
tional assists leader Stephanie Snyder.
"Oregon is a good challenge for us,"
junior Nancy Reno said. "I'm really
psyched to go there again. It just won't
be good as far as schoolwork goes."
The other matchups in the West
region are Washington at No. 1 Brig
ham Young, Loyola Marymount at
UCLA (No. 7), and Pepperdine (No. 15)
at Arizona State (No. 14). The four win
ners will advance to regional play Dec.
11-13, which probably will be at BYU.
If Stanford and UCLA both win this
weekend, they are likely to meet in the
opening round of the regional.
When asked about a third confronta
tion with UCLA, Reno replied: "That
would be great."
That, of course, assumes the Card
inal gets by Oregon, but Shaw is opti
mistic. "Naturally, I'd rather be playing
at home," he said, "but we've proven
to be a good road team, and this is the
NCAAs, so I expect we'll be pumped
up."
Stanford goes into the tournament
having one of the strongest postseason
records since the NCAA began
sanctioning a playoff system in 1981.

The Cardinal finished fifth that year,
fourth in 1982, third in 1983 and
second in both 1984 and 1985. This
year, though, the field is much tough
er, with no one dominant team.
If th'e Cardinal can fight its way
through the tough West region, it will
meet the winner of the Mideast region
— probably No. 6 Nebraska or No. 9 Il
linois.
The other half of the draw contains
the South region, where Texas is chal
lenged by no one in the top 15, and the
deadly Northwest region, which may
provide more excitement than the
Final Four itself.
No. 2 University of the Pacific, No. 3
Hawaii, No. 4 San Jose State, No. 5 San
Diego State, No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara
and No. 12 Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
will all be fighting for one Final Four
berth.
Hahner thinks the division of teams
is "absolutely ridiculous — not fair to
West Coast teams."

more. These guys are what makes win
ning the title feel so great."
Yesterdays game marked the final
NCAA appearance for one of Stanford's
most talented recruiting classes ever.
Beginning their freshman year with an
11-13-3 record (the only losing season
in Stanford's history), the group
finished second in the NCAAs in 1984
and ended their Cardinal careers with
back-to-back national championships.
Seniors Klass, Imbernino, Gamble,
Ocasek and Chris Thompson will be a
hard group to replace.
"It is nice to be back this year with
the team," said Thompson, who came
back from a preseason collapsed lung
to play his final year. "I really wanted
to finish with the guys I started with.
Winning back-to-back championships
and going undefeated is a great feeling.
It's like we have accomplished some
thing in our four years here."
Indeed they have.

man) to hold him in check.
Whitsitt was given the challenge of
stopping Hines, and he stopped him
cold. Hines missed all 11 of his shots
from the field and scored just five
points.
"Novian is our quickest player, and
he denied him (Hines) the ball,''
Montgomery said. "The job that Novian
did on him early took him out of the
game."
"It was my job to keep him off bal
ance, deny him the ball," Whitsitt said.
"That put a burden on the other
players to pick up the scoring slack,
and that was the game plan."
The other Owls were not equal to
the task, as Rice shot only 38 percent
for the game. Stanford, meanwhile,
shot a blistering 66 percent (29-for-44)
after an icy 37 percent outing against
Georgia Tech.
Whitsitt typified the Cardinal turn
around. After being held scoreless
despite playing 30 minutes against

Georgia Tech, Whitsitt scored 12 on 5-
for-6 shooting the following night.
"I didn't have a particularly good
game against Georgia Tech," Whitsitt
said. "I wanted to play hard and forget
the previous night. I had a little aggres
sion I wanted to work out."
Wright, who was named to the All
tournament team, led Stanford with 15
points and 10 rebounds. Lichti scored
10, followed by Meinert and Bryan
McSweeney with eight each.
Card notes
One of the most exciting plays of the
tournament didn't count. With the final
seconds of garbage time ticking down in
the Stanford-Rice game, Cardinal reserve
guard Charles Schwager picked up a
loose ball and launched a 50-foot baseball
pass toward the basket as the buzzer
sounded. It went in, drawing a roar from
the Richmond crowd but no sympathy from
the referees, who disallowed the shot.
Joining Wright on the all-tournament
team were Ferrell and Spiders Peter
Woolfolk, Steve Kratzer and Rodney
Rice. Ferrell was named most valuable
player.
Stanford's next game will be tomorrow
night at San Jose State.
