# Raiders squander key game; Pats in 1st place
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” It was the kind of game the Los An
geles Raiders usually win and the Philadelphia Eagles
usually lose because the Raiders have been winners and the
Eagles losers in recent years.
But, in a weird ending to a very weird game, the under
dog Eagles came away with the victory.
Quarterback Randall Cunningham scored on a one-yard
sneak with 8:07 elapsed in overtime yesterday to give the
Eagles a shocking 33-27 triumph over the Raiders.
Two plays earlier, with the Raiders at the Philadelphia 16-
yard line and apparently on the verge of winning, Marcus Al
len fumbled and safety Andre Waters scooped up the ball
and raced 81 yards to the Los Angeles 4.
"It was the sweetest victory by far in my NFL career," said
Waters, a three-year veteran from Cheyney (Pa.) University,
who joined the Eagles as a free agent in 1984. "Coach
(Buddy) Ryan is responsible for that. He keeps telling us we
have to take the ball away when the game is on the line."
The loss severely jeopardizes the playoff chances of the
Raiders, who are 8-5 and trail AFC West-leading Denver by
two games with three games left to play.
The win broke a four-game losing streak for the Eagles,
who have a 4-9 record.
"This is probably the greatest win we've had since I've
been here," said Ryan, the former defensive coordinator for
the Chicago Bears who is in his first season as the Eagles'
head coach. "I like the way we fought them tooth and nail.
That's the kind of team 1 want.
"We tried to give it away a few times and the officials tried
to take it away about a thousand times."
The Raiders had an excellent chance to win before Allen
fumbled.
Los Angeles had gotten the ball at the Philadephia 42-yard
line when Bill Pickel recorded the 10th Raider sack of Cun
ningham and caused a fumble, which teammate Howie Long

recovered.
Jim Plunkett threw a 27-yard pass to Allen on a third-and
-20 play to put the ball at the Eagles' 20. Allen ran for four
yards before losing the ball on the next play.
Waters caught it on a bounce and appeared on his way to
a game-winning touchdown, but he was run down by Dokie
Williams at the Los Angeles 4. Cunningham ran for three
yards before scoring the game-winner.
"There's no question it was my fault on the play," Allen
said. "It was just a simple lead play. I was reaching for the
ball and didn't take it the proper way. As a result of that, I
lost the ball.
Cunningham completed 22 of 39 passes for 298 yards and
three touchdowns, all to Mike Quick. He was intercepted
once.
"Randall Cunningham is just unbelievable," cornerback
Lester Hayes of the Raiders said of the elusive Philadelphia
quarterback. "He must shower in Vaseline. There's only one
Cunningham in the entire NFL, and he really gives the
Eagles' offense life.
Patriots 21, Saints 20
Just when it looks like the New England Patriots are finally
going to lose, they find another way to win.
The Patriots scored touchdowns on a blocked punt and a
fumble recovery in the final four minutes yesterday and
defeated the New Orleans Saints 21-20. New England's
seventh consecutive victory pulled them into a tie for first
place with the New York Jets, both with 10-3 records.
It was the third straight week that the Patriots won in the
late going. They defeated the Los Angeles Rams with a last
play pass into the end zone and rallied to beat Buffalo with i
scoring drive in the last two minutes.
Eugene Profit, a rookie from Yale activated only two days

earlier, blocked a punt, and Mosi Tatupu, a nine-year vet
eran, picked it up and raced 1" vards for a touchdown with
3:51 left.
Two minutes later, with 1:49 left in the game, 2" 7 8-pound
rookie defensive lineman Brent Williams ran 21 yards with a
fumble recovery for another TD.
Rams 17, Jets 3
Jim Everett hit Kevin House with a 60-yard touchdown
pass, Eric Dickerson ran for 107 yards and the Los Angeles
defense shut down New York's high-scoring offense.
Everett, making only his second NFL start, was intercepted
on two of his first three passes. But after a 96-yard drive by
the Jets ended with Wesley Walker's fumble into the end
zone, the rookie quarterback hit House with a third-and-4
pass from his own 40 in the first minute of the second quar
ter.
Browns 13, Oilers 10
Mark Moseley, acquired last week after Matt Bahr was
injured, kicked a 29-yard field goal with 16 seconds remain
ing as Cleveland capitalized on the second of Frank Min
efield's two overtime interceptions to beat Houston.
The overtime field goal was the fifth in Moseley's career,
giving him sole possession of the NFL record he had shared
with former Cleveland kicker Don Cockroft.

Bears 13, Steelers 10
Kevin Butler, who missed a field goal at the end of regula
tion play, redeemed himself with a 42-yard boot into
overtime as Chicago clinched its third straight NFC Central
Division title by beating Pittsburgh.
Butler had missed a 28-yarder with SS seconds left in
regulation.
Redskins 20, Cards 17
Washington took sole possession of first place in the NFC
East when Max Zendejas kicked a field goal with
four seconds to go against St Louis, clinching at least a
home wild-card berth for the Redskins.
Jav Schroeder completed 23 of 44 passes tor 2S(> yards for
the Redskins.
Bills 17, Chiefs 14
Jim Kelly threw two touchdown passes to Andre Reed as
Buffalo ended the NFL's second-longest road losing streak
ever by beating Kansas City
The Bills had lost 22 straight on the road since winning in
Kansas City on Dec. 4, 1983. The streak was one short of the
record 23 lost bv Houston between 1981 and 1984
