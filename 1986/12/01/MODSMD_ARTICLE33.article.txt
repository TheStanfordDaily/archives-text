# Raiders squander key game; Pats in 1st place
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — It was the kind of game the Los An
geles Raiders usually win and the Philadelphia Eagles
usually lose because the Raiders have been winners and the
Eagles losers in recent years.
But, in a weird ending to a very weird game, the under
dog Eagles came away with the victory.
Quarterback Randall Cunningham scored on a one-yard
sneak with 8:07 elapsed in overtime yesterday to give the
Eagles a shocking 33-27 triumph over the Raiders.
Two plays earlier, with the Raiders at the Philadelphia 16-
yard line and apparently on the verge of winning, Marcus Al
len fumbled and safety Andre Waters scooped up the ball
and raced 81 yards to the Los Angeles 4.
"It was the sweetest victory by far in my NFL career," said
Waters, a three-year veteran from Cheyney (Pa.) University,
who joined the Eagles as a free agent in 1984. "Coach
(Buddy) Ryan is responsible for that. He keeps telling us we
have to take the ball away when the game is on the line."
The loss severely jeopardizes the playoff chances of the
Raiders, who are 8-5 and trail AFC West-leading Denver by
two games with three games left to play.
The win broke a four-game losing streak for the Eagles,
who have a 4-9 record.
"This is probably the greatest win we've had since I've
been here," said Ryan, the former defensive coordinator for
the Chicago Bears who is in his first season as the Eagles'
head coach. "I like the way we fought them tooth and nail.
That's the kind of team 1 want.
"We tried to give it away a few times and the officials tried
to take it away about a thousand times."
The Raiders had an excellent chance to win before Allen
fumbled.
Los Angeles had gotten the ball at the Philadephia 42-yard
line when Bill Pickel recorded the 10th Raider sack of Cun
ningham and caused a fumble, which teammate Howie Long

recovered.
Jim Plunkett threw a 27-yard pass to Allen on a third-and
-20 play to put the ball at the Eagles' 20. Allen ran for four
yards before losing the ball on the next play.
Waters caught it on a bounce and appeared on his way to
a game-winning touchdown, but he was run down by Dokie
Williams at the Los Angeles 4. Cunningham ran for three
yards before scoring the game-winner.
"There's no question it was my fault on the play," Allen
said. "It was just a simple lead play. I was reaching for the
ball and didn't take it the proper way. As a result of that, I
lost the ball.
Cunningham completed 22 of 39 passes for 298 yards and
three touchdowns, all to Mike Quick. He was intercepted
once.
"Randall Cunningham is just unbelievable," cornerback
Lester Hayes of the Raiders said of the elusive Philadelphia
quarterback. "He must shower in Vaseline. There's only one
Cunningham in the entire NFL, and he really gives the
Eagles' offense life.
Patriots 21, Saints 20
Just when it looks like the New England Patriots are finally
going to lose, they find another way to win.
The Patriots scored touchdowns on a blocked punt and a
fumble recovery in the final four minutes yesterday and
defeated the New Orleans Saints 21-20. New England's
seventh consecutive victory pulled them into a tie for first
place with the New York Jets, both with 10-3 records.
It was the third straight week that the Patriots won in the
late going. They defeated the Los Angeles Rams with a last
play pass into the end zone and rallied to beat Buffalo with i
scoring drive in the last two minutes.
Eugene Profit, a rookie from Yale activated only two days

earlier, blocked a punt, and Mosi Tatupu, a nine-year vet
eran, picked it up and raced 1" vards for a touchdown with
3:51 left.
Two minutes later, with 1:49 left in the game, 2" 7 8-pound
rookie defensive lineman Brent Williams ran 21 yards with a
fumble recovery for another TD.
Rams 17, Jets 3
Jim Everett hit Kevin House with a 60-yard touchdown
pass, Eric Dickerson ran for 107 yards and the Los Angeles
defense shut down New York's high-scoring offense.
Everett, making only his second NFL start, was intercepted
on two of his first three passes. But after a 96-yard drive by
the Jets ended with Wesley Walker's fumble into the end
zone, the rookie quarterback hit House with a third-and-4
pass from his own 40 in the first minute of the second quar
ter.
Browns 13, Oilers 10
Mark Moseley, acquired last week after Matt Bahr was
injured, kicked a 29-yard field goal with 16 seconds remain
ing as Cleveland capitalized on the second of Frank Min
efield's two overtime interceptions to beat Houston.
The overtime field goal was the fifth in Moseley's career,
giving him sole possession of the NFL record he had shared
with former Cleveland kicker Don Cockroft.

Bears 13, Steelers 10
Kevin Butler, who missed a field goal at the end of regula
tion play, redeemed himself with a 42-yard boot into
overtime as Chicago clinched its third straight NFC Central
Division title by beating Pittsburgh.
Butler had missed a 28-yarder with SS seconds left in
regulation.
Redskins 20, Cards 17
Washington took sole possession of first place in the NFC
East when Max Zendejas kicked a field goal with
four seconds to go against St Louis, clinching at least a
home wild-card berth for the Redskins.
Jav Schroeder completed 23 of 44 passes tor 2S(> yards for
the Redskins.
Bills 17, Chiefs 14
Jim Kelly threw two touchdown passes to Andre Reed as
Buffalo ended the NFL's second-longest road losing streak
ever by beating Kansas City
The Bills had lost 22 straight on the road since winning in
Kansas City on Dec. 4, 1983. The streak was one short of the
record 23 lost bv Houston between 1981 and 1984
While Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev called the move a "major
mistake," Staar said, Despite the rhet
oric that will come out through Tass or
Pravda, I think they (the Russians) are
going to respect us for what the presi
dent did."
\ Political Science Prof. Alexander
Dallin said the importance of Reagan's
move was not strategic, but that it
would be one more indication of the
administration's attitude toward arms
control
Hubert Marshall, professor of politi

cal science and history, agreed, saying,
"This is just further evidence that Presi
dent Reagan has no interest in putting
a cap on the arms race."
He's opposed all past arms treaties
and has done nothing to show any
serious interest in stopping or slowing
down the race," he said.
While the experts interviewed yes
terday had concrete ideas regarding
Reagan's decision, none had a clear
idea of the repercussions the move
would bring.
"There's really no way to know,
Marshall said. "I have the feeling they
(the Soviets) will not do anything im
mediately, at least until they are quite
sure that this is an irrevocable move by

It was the play of freshmen Jennifer
Azzi, Stacy Parson and Katy Steding,
however, that brought the most praise
from Vanderveer.
Azzi, a 5-foot-7 guard, scored 13
points, passed for four assists, had two
steals in the final and was named to the
All-tournament team. Parson, also a 5-7
guard, scored 11 points, as did the 6-1
Steding, who led the team in rebounds
with 11.
"I was really pleased with Katy
Steding," VanDerveer said. Right now,
she's the leading rebounder on the

team
The play of the Stanford freshmen
boded well for the team's future, ac
cording to VanDerveer. "Some of our
young players raised some eyebrows
this weekend," she said. "They're gix>d
players."
The freshmen got their chance early
in the final when foul trouble sidelined
many of the Stanford starters. "VC'e
were in really bad foul trouble the
whole game," VanDerveer said.
In addition, sophomore starting for
ward Evon Asforis was lost for the
game after only six minutes when she
reinjured the knee she had sprained
last season. "I watched it on the
videotape. She came down on the
wrong foot, VanDerveer said. "I think
it scared her more than anything else.
We're not going to rush her back in."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal took a 39-
30 halftime lead and was able to ex
tend the margin in the second half
largely because of a solid defense that
clamped down on the UNLV fast break.
Instead of their usual full-court of
] fense, the Rebels were forced to shoot
■ from outside. They did not respond
; well, shooting just 32 percent on the
1 night (20 of 63 from the floor).
i The Cardinal did not shoot very well
, either, canning just 23 of 53 shots, and
j the team was out-rebounded by the
; Rebels 42-40. But the effort was good
enough for Stanford to record its
second victory in as many years against
UNLV.
Last season, Stanford surprised the
Rebels 62-59 at Maples Pavilion, but
Saturday's victory was more satisfying,
according to VanDerveer. "This year's
win was a different win," she said. "Last
year, they had a player out and they
were sort of looking past us. I don't
think our players were convinced we
were that good. This year they were
healthy."

Los Angeles had gotten the ball at the Philadephia 42-yard
line when Bill Pickel recorded the 10th Raider sack of Cun
ningham and caused a fumble, which teammate Howie Long

recovered.
Jim Plunkett threw a 27-yard pass to Allen on a third-and
-20 play to put the ball at the Eagles' 20. Allen ran for four
yards before losing the ball on the next play.
Waters caught it on a bounce and appeared on his way to
a game-winning touchdown, but he was run down by Dokie
Williams at the Los Angeles 4. Cunningham ran for three
yards before scoring the game-winner.
"There's no question it was my fault on the play," Allen
said. "It was just a simple lead play. I was reaching for the
ball and didn't take it the proper way. As a result of that, I
lost the ball.
Cunningham completed 22 of 39 passes for 298 yards and
three touchdowns, all to Mike Quick. He was intercepted
once.
"Randall Cunningham is just unbelievable," cornerback
Lester Hayes of the Raiders said of the elusive Philadelphia
quarterback. "He must shower in Vaseline. There's only one
Cunningham in the entire NFL, and he really gives the
Eagles' offense life.
Patriots 21, Saints 20
Just when it looks like the New England Patriots are finally
going to lose, they find another way to win.
The Patriots scored touchdowns on a blocked punt and a
fumble recovery in the final four minutes yesterday and
defeated the New Orleans Saints 21-20. New England's
seventh consecutive victory pulled them into a tie for first
place with the New York Jets, both with 10-3 records.
It was the third straight week that the Patriots won in the
late going. They defeated the Los Angeles Rams with a last
play pass into the end zone and rallied to beat Buffalo with i
scoring drive in the last two minutes.
Eugene Profit, a rookie from Yale activated only two days

earlier, blocked a punt, and Mosi Tatupu, a nine-year vet
eran, picked it up and raced 1" vards for a touchdown with
3:51 left.
Two minutes later, with 1:49 left in the game, 2" 7 8-pound
rookie defensive lineman Brent Williams ran 21 yards with a
fumble recovery for another TD.
Rams 17, Jets 3
Jim Everett hit Kevin House with a 60-yard touchdown
pass, Eric Dickerson ran for 107 yards and the Los Angeles
defense shut down New York's high-scoring offense.
Everett, making only his second NFL start, was intercepted
on two of his first three passes. But after a 96-yard drive by
the Jets ended with Wesley Walker's fumble into the end
zone, the rookie quarterback hit House with a third-and-4
pass from his own 40 in the first minute of the second quar
ter.

Mark Moseley, acquired last week after Matt Bahr was
injured, kicked a 29-yard field goal with 16 seconds remain

The overtime field goal was the fifth in Moseley's career,
giving him sole possession of the NFL record he had shared
with former Cleveland kicker Don Cockroft.

Bears 13, Steelers 10
Kevin Butler, who missed a field goal at the end of regula

Division title by beating Pittsburgh.
Butler had missed a 28-yarder with SS seconds left in
regulation.
Redskins 20, Cards 17
Washington took sole possession of first place in the NFC
East when Max Zendejas kicked a field goal with
four seconds to go against St Louis, clinching at least a
home wild-card berth for the Redskins.
Jav Schroeder completed 23 of 44 passes tor 2S(> yards for
the Redskins.

It was the play of freshmen Jennifer
Azzi, Stacy Parson and Katy Steding,
however, that brought the most praise
from Vanderveer.
Azzi, a 5-foot-7 guard, scored 13
points, passed for four assists, had two
steals in the final and was named to the
All-tournament team. Parson, also a 5-7
guard, scored 11 points, as did the 6-1
Steding, who led the team in rebounds
with 11.
"I was really pleased with Katy
Steding," VanDerveer said. Right now,
she's the leading rebounder on the

team
The play of the Stanford freshmen
boded well for the team's future, ac
cording to VanDerveer. "Some of our
young players raised some eyebrows
this weekend," she said. "They're gix>d
players."
The freshmen got their chance early
in the final when foul trouble sidelined
many of the Stanford starters. "VC'e
were in really bad foul trouble the
whole game," VanDerveer said.
In addition, sophomore starting for
ward Evon Asforis was lost for the
game after only six minutes when she
reinjured the knee she had sprained
last season. "I watched it on the
videotape. She came down on the
wrong foot, VanDerveer said. "I think
it scared her more than anything else.
We're not going to rush her back in."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal took a 39-
30 halftime lead and was able to ex
tend the margin in the second half
largely because of a solid defense that
clamped down on the UNLV fast break.
Instead of their usual full-court of
] fense, the Rebels were forced to shoot
■ from outside. They did not respond
; well, shooting just 32 percent on the
1 night (20 of 63 from the floor).
i The Cardinal did not shoot very well
, either, canning just 23 of 53 shots, and
j the team was out-rebounded by the
; Rebels 42-40. But the effort was good
enough for Stanford to record its
second victory in as many years against
UNLV.
Last season, Stanford surprised the
Rebels 62-59 at Maples Pavilion, but
Saturday's victory was more satisfying,
according to VanDerveer. "This year's
win was a different win," she said. "Last
year, they had a player out and they
were sort of looking past us. I don't
think our players were convinced we
were that good. This year they were
healthy."

Junior Kami Anderson led a balanced Stanford attack this weekend as the
Cardinal won the championship at the UNLV/7-UP Invitational. Anderson
scored 31 points in two games to win tournament MVP honors.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — It was the kind of game the Los An
geles Raiders usually win and the Philadelphia Eagles
usually lose because the Raiders have been winners and the
Eagles losers in recent years.
But, in a weird ending to a very weird game, the under
dog Eagles came away with the victory.
Quarterback Randall Cunningham scored on a one-yard
sneak with 8:07 elapsed in overtime yesterday to give the
Eagles a shocking 33-27 triumph over the Raiders.
Two plays earlier, with the Raiders at the Philadelphia 16-
yard line and apparently on the verge of winning, Marcus Al
len fumbled and safety Andre Waters scooped up the ball
and raced 81 yards to the Los Angeles 4.
"It was the sweetest victory by far in my NFL career," said
Waters, a three-year veteran from Cheyney (Pa.) University,
who joined the Eagles as a free agent in 1984. "Coach
(Buddy) Ryan is responsible for that. He keeps telling us we
have to take the ball away when the game is on the line."
The loss severely jeopardizes the playoff chances of the
Raiders, who are 8-5 and trail AFC West-leading Denver by
two games with three games left to play.
The win broke a four-game losing streak for the Eagles,
who have a 4-9 record.
"This is probably the greatest win we've had since I've
been here," said Ryan, the former defensive coordinator for
the Chicago Bears who is in his first season as the Eagles'
head coach. "I like the way we fought them tooth and nail.
That's the kind of team 1 want.
"We tried to give it away a few times and the officials tried
to take it away about a thousand times."

play pass into the end zone and rallied to beat Buffalo with i
scoring drive in the last two minutes.
Eugene Profit, a rookie from Yale activated only two days

earlier, blocked a punt, and Mosi Tatupu, a nine-year vet
eran, picked it up and raced 1" vards for a touchdown with
3:51 left.
Two minutes later, with 1:49 left in the game, 2" 7 8-pound
rookie defensive lineman Brent Williams ran 21 yards with a
fumble recovery for another TD.
Rams 17, Jets 3
Jim Everett hit Kevin House with a 60-yard touchdown
pass, Eric Dickerson ran for 107 yards and the Los Angeles
defense shut down New York's high-scoring offense.
Everett, making only his second NFL start, was intercepted
on two of his first three passes. But after a 96-yard drive by
the Jets ended with Wesley Walker's fumble into the end
zone, the rookie quarterback hit House with a third-and-4
pass from his own 40 in the first minute of the second quar
ter.
Browns 13, Oilers 10
Mark Moseley, acquired last week after Matt Bahr was
injured, kicked a 29-yard field goal with 16 seconds remain
ing as Cleveland capitalized on the second of Frank Min
efield's two overtime interceptions to beat Houston.
The overtime field goal was the fifth in Moseley's career,
giving him sole possession of the NFL record he had shared
with former Cleveland kicker Don Cockroft.

Bears 13, Steelers 10
Kevin Butler, who missed a field goal at the end of regula
tion play, redeemed himself with a 42-yard boot into
overtime as Chicago clinched its third straight NFC Central
Division title by beating Pittsburgh.
Butler had missed a 28-yarder with SS seconds left in
regulation.
Redskins 20, Cards 17
Washington took sole possession of first place in the NFC
East when Max Zendejas kicked a field goal with
four seconds to go against St Louis, clinching at least a
home wild-card berth for the Redskins.
Jav Schroeder completed 23 of 44 passes tor 2S(> yards for
the Redskins.
Bills 17, Chiefs 14
Jim Kelly threw two touchdown passes to Andre Reed as
Buffalo ended the NFL's second-longest road losing streak
ever by beating Kansas City
The Bills had lost 22 straight on the road since winning in
Kansas City on Dec. 4, 1983. The streak was one short of the
record 23 lost bv Houston between 1981 and 1984

He's opposed all past arms treaties
and has done nothing to show any

It was the play of freshmen Jennifer
Azzi, Stacy Parson and Katy Steding,
however, that brought the most praise
from Vanderveer.
Azzi, a 5-foot-7 guard, scored 13
points, passed for four assists, had two
steals in the final and was named to the
All-tournament team. Parson, also a 5-7
guard, scored 11 points, as did the 6-1
Steding, who led the team in rebounds
with 11.
"I was really pleased with Katy
Steding," VanDerveer said. Right now,
she's the leading rebounder on the

team
The play of the Stanford freshmen
boded well for the team's future, ac
cording to VanDerveer. "Some of our
young players raised some eyebrows
this weekend," she said. "They're gix>d
players."
The freshmen got their chance early
in the final when foul trouble sidelined
many of the Stanford starters. "VC'e
were in really bad foul trouble the
whole game," VanDerveer said.
In addition, sophomore starting for
ward Evon Asforis was lost for the
game after only six minutes when she
reinjured the knee she had sprained
last season. "I watched it on the
videotape. She came down on the
wrong foot, VanDerveer said. "I think
it scared her more than anything else.
We're not going to rush her back in."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal took a 39-
30 halftime lead and was able to ex
tend the margin in the second half
largely because of a solid defense that
clamped down on the UNLV fast break.
Instead of their usual full-court of
] fense, the Rebels were forced to shoot
■ from outside. They did not respond
; well, shooting just 32 percent on the
1 night (20 of 63 from the floor).
i The Cardinal did not shoot very well
, either, canning just 23 of 53 shots, and
j the team was out-rebounded by the
; Rebels 42-40. But the effort was good
enough for Stanford to record its
second victory in as many years against
UNLV.
Last season, Stanford surprised the
Rebels 62-59 at Maples Pavilion, but
Saturday's victory was more satisfying,
according to VanDerveer. "This year's
win was a different win," she said. "Last
year, they had a player out and they
were sort of looking past us. I don't
think our players were convinced we
were that good. This year they were
healthy."

Cardinal won the championship at the UNLV/7-UP Invitational. Anderson
scored 31 points in two games to win tournament MVP honors.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — It was the kind of game the Los An
geles Raiders usually win and the Philadelphia Eagles
usually lose because the Raiders have been winners and the
Eagles losers in recent years.
But, in a weird ending to a very weird game, the under
dog Eagles came away with the victory.
Quarterback Randall Cunningham scored on a one-yard
sneak with 8:07 elapsed in overtime yesterday to give the
Eagles a shocking 33-27 triumph over the Raiders.
Two plays earlier, with the Raiders at the Philadelphia 16-
yard line and apparently on the verge of winning, Marcus Al
len fumbled and safety Andre Waters scooped up the ball
and raced 81 yards to the Los Angeles 4.
"It was the sweetest victory by far in my NFL career," said
Waters, a three-year veteran from Cheyney (Pa.) University,
who joined the Eagles as a free agent in 1984. "Coach
(Buddy) Ryan is responsible for that. He keeps telling us we
have to take the ball away when the game is on the line."
The loss severely jeopardizes the playoff chances of the
Raiders, who are 8-5 and trail AFC West-leading Denver by
two games with three games left to play.
The win broke a four-game losing streak for the Eagles,
who have a 4-9 record.
"This is probably the greatest win we've had since I've
been here," said Ryan, the former defensive coordinator for
the Chicago Bears who is in his first season as the Eagles'
head coach. "I like the way we fought them tooth and nail.
That's the kind of team 1 want.
"We tried to give it away a few times and the officials tried
to take it away about a thousand times."
The Raiders had an excellent chance to win before Allen
fumbled.
Los Angeles had gotten the ball at the Philadephia 42-yard
line when Bill Pickel recorded the 10th Raider sack of Cun
ningham and caused a fumble, which teammate Howie Long

recovered.
Jim Plunkett threw a 27-yard pass to Allen on a third-and
-20 play to put the ball at the Eagles' 20. Allen ran for four
yards before losing the ball on the next play.
Waters caught it on a bounce and appeared on his way to
a game-winning touchdown, but he was run down by Dokie
Williams at the Los Angeles 4. Cunningham ran for three
yards before scoring the game-winner.
"There's no question it was my fault on the play," Allen
said. "It was just a simple lead play. I was reaching for the
ball and didn't take it the proper way. As a result of that, I
lost the ball.
Cunningham completed 22 of 39 passes for 298 yards and
three touchdowns, all to Mike Quick. He was intercepted
once.
"Randall Cunningham is just unbelievable," cornerback
Lester Hayes of the Raiders said of the elusive Philadelphia
quarterback. "He must shower in Vaseline. There's only one
Cunningham in the entire NFL, and he really gives the
Eagles' offense life.
Patriots 21, Saints 20
Just when it looks like the New England Patriots are finally
going to lose, they find another way to win.
The Patriots scored touchdowns on a blocked punt and a
fumble recovery in the final four minutes yesterday and
defeated the New Orleans Saints 21-20. New England's
seventh consecutive victory pulled them into a tie for first
place with the New York Jets, both with 10-3 records.
It was the third straight week that the Patriots won in the
late going. They defeated the Los Angeles Rams with a last
play pass into the end zone and rallied to beat Buffalo with i
