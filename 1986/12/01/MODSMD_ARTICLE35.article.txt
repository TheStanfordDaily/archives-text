Whenever CBS-TV shows an episode
of its yupscale news magazine "West
57th," the grumpy old-timers in the
CBS news department complain,
"That's not the way Ed would have
wanted it." Every three weeks or so,
when commentator Bill Moyers vows

to leave network news for public tele
vision, he claims that network news
isn't being done "the way it was when
Ed was around." In almost any serious
discussion of radio and television
news, the name Ed is invoked like that
of a saint.
The "Ed" remembered with such
reverence is Edward R. Murrow (1908-
65), America's first great broadcast
newsman. He was a gifted reporter, not
so much because of his dedicated pur
suit of the truth, although that he cer
tainly had, but because of his rather
tight-lipped skepticism about those
who create news and, in the later years

of his career, those who bring news to
the public.
Good timing played a part in his fa
mous career. He was fortunate enough
to enter the field of radio news in its
infancy and later joined television
news on the ground floor as well.
Since there were no pre-existing stand
ards to conform to in each medium,
Murrow always followed his reporter's
instincts, no matter how many tersely
worded memos his corporate
employers might issue in protest.
All this is detailed in AM. Sperber's
"Murrow: His Life and Times," a
massive account of the newsman's life.

But while Sperber's biography is a real
brute at nearly 800 pages, there's no
sense of strain in the writing. One
never imagines Sperber huffing and
puffing over her subject, trying to in
ject an inflated drama into her ma
terial. She lets Murrow's opinions
speak for themselves, only occasionally
underlining the significance of the
events in his life.
And what a life it was. Reading this
book it's hard not to feel jealous of
Murrow: he got in on all the action of
the mid-20th century. The spread of
fascism in Europe, the bombing of
London, the European front in WWII,
the Korean War, the red scares of the
'50s, the Kennedy administration —
Murrow either covered all these events
or actually took part in them. For this
reason Sperber's book is not just an ex
cellent biography, it's also an engross
ing account of recent American history
as seen, like most things these days,
through the prism of broadcasting.
After college Murrow spent five
years working for the Institute of Inter
national Education, normally a student
exchange program but which, in the
mid-'3os, had become one of the few
means of escape for scholars fleeing
Hitler. In 1935, at the age of 27, Mur
row was hired by CBS Radio, and he
soon found himself working the 1936
presidential conventions, two of the
earliest major political events covered
by radio.
He carefully noted the role the
media played at the conventions, as the
candidates made sure their speeches
wouldn't run up against "Amos 'n'
Andy."
"I saw the power of the medium
demonstrated at first hand," Murrow
said later. "Few people, even those in
timately connected with broadcasting,
appreciate the potential power of this
medium in both national and interna
tional affairs."
Not surprisingly, then, it was Mur
row who elevated the brash and noisy
upstart of radio news, in his position as
CBS's foreign news director. Under his
guidance, radio provided instan
taneous coverage and analysis of the
deteriorating European situation.
While the BBC gave out dry, statistics
oriented news reports, Murrow's dis
patches (often reported with bombs
exploding in the background) had a

sociological feel, depicting a world in
transition. He solicited on the air the
opinions of common people, a
practice never adopted by the BBC.
More importantly, he made a point of
presenting opposing viewpoints on
every issue, a policy that struck the
BBC's government sponsors as being
vaguely heretical.
Sperber is at her best as an author
when she describes Murrow's experi
ences during World War 11. Her ac
count of the bombing of London is all
too vivid, an important reminder of
how tragic and destructive massive
bombing campaigns can be.
Celebrated for his war-time radio
broadcasts, Murrow then went on to
conquer the budding medium of tele
vision news, doing battle with both
spineless advertisers, who didn't want
to sponsor controversial programs,
and the red-baiting junior senator from
Wisconsin. The McCarthy era of the
mid-'sos, that infamous period when
our country decided to go insane for a
little while, is the centerpiece of Sper
ber's biography, and rightly so. It was
in 1954 that Murrow used all the clout
he had accumulated over the years, all
the trust the public placed in him, to at
tack Joseph McCarthy.
As the red scare gathered steam in
the late '40s and early '50s, Murrow
watched with growing dismay and con
tempt as one colleague after another
was blacklisted. He was alarmed at the
blatant disregard for civil liberties. He
instructed his "See It Now" news staff
to begin compiling a file on McCarthy.
The end result in March 1954 was "A
Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy."
The program was no report but a long
editorial against the senator, using film
of McCarthy speaking his own words to
condemn him. Yet Murrow also asked
the audience to acknowledge that the
national hysteria was not entirely
McCarthy's fault; the show ended with
Murrow turning to the camera and
quoting, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."
The McCarthy episode was the high
point of "See It Now," Murrow's
weekly documentary series for CBS
TV, the forerunner of "60 Minutes" and
all the rest. Murrow's cinematic good
looks, coupled with his ever-serious
demeanor, made him the perfect tele
vision newsman. "A cool host suited to

a cool medium." Sperber calls him.
Backed up by Murrow's keen grasp of
politics and history, the program
looked at racial segregation, the Cold
War, blacklisting, the Korean War and
the plight of migrant workers (in the
celebrated "Harvest ot Shame" seg
ment). Murrow demonstrated that tele
vision news need not be vacuous en
tertainment, the province of empty
headed trendies hired for their Ken
and-Barbie-doll good looks.

And yet, for all his high-mindedness,
Murrow also worked on such kitschy
fare as "Person to Person," a popular
television series in which he glibly in
terviewed celebrities. When asked why
he bothered, he replied, "Listen, do
you know what I can get away with be
cause Person to Person' is a big hit?"
Murrow died in 1965 of lung cancer.
His last few years were spent directing
the U.S. Information Agency for John F.
Kennedy. He had been quietly phased
out of CBS after a famous 1958 speech
in which he bit into the hand that fed
him and refused to let go. "The top
management of the (television) net
works," he said, "with a few notable
exceptions, has been trained in adver
tising, research or show business. But
by the nature of the corporate
structure, they also make the final and
crucial decisions having to do with
news and public affairs. Frequently
they have neither the time nor the
competence to do this."
This speech, given nearly 30 years
ago, applies all too accurately to the
current state of broadcasting.
"Television is being used to distract,
delude, amuse and insulate us," Mur
row continued. "This could be the
most exciting and fruitful means of
communication yet devised, but it is in
the hands of timid and avaricious men
and the public appears to be largely
apathetic."
You tell 'em, Ed.
We need more people like Edward
R. Murrow, with his intelligence,
courage and honesty. A.M. Sperber is
well aware of these qualities in Mur
row; while reading the book you can
almost hear the sighs of infatuation
coming from the pages. But if Sperber
is a little in love with her subject, it's
understandable. After reading this
book, I think I'm a little in love with
him myself.

The McCarthy episode was the high
point of "See It Now," Murrow's
weekly documentary series for CBS

all the rest. Murrow's cinematic good
looks, coupled with his ever-serious
demeanor, made him the perfect tele

a cool medium." Sperber calls him.
Backed up by Murrow's keen grasp of
politics and history, the program
looked at racial segregation, the Cold
War, blacklisting, the Korean War and
the plight of migrant workers (in the
celebrated "Harvest ot Shame" seg

vision news need not be vacuous en
tertainment, the province of empty
headed trendies hired for their Ken
and-Barbie-doll good looks.

And yet, for all his high-mindedness,
Murrow also worked on such kitschy
fare as "Person to Person," a popular

he bothered, he replied, "Listen, do
you know what I can get away with be

Murrow died in 1965 of lung cancer.
His last few years were spent directing
the U.S. Information Agency for John F.
Kennedy. He had been quietly phased
out of CBS after a famous 1958 speech
in which he bit into the hand that fed
him and refused to let go. "The top
management of the (television) net
works," he said, "with a few notable
exceptions, has been trained in adver
tising, research or show business. But
by the nature of the corporate
structure, they also make the final and
crucial decisions having to do with
news and public affairs. Frequently
they have neither the time nor the
competence to do this."
This speech, given nearly 30 years
ago, applies all too accurately to the
current state of broadcasting.
"Television is being used to distract,
delude, amuse and insulate us," Mur
row continued. "This could be the
most exciting and fruitful means of
communication yet devised, but it is in
the hands of timid and avaricious men
and the public appears to be largely
apathetic."
You tell 'em, Ed.
We need more people like Edward
R. Murrow, with his intelligence,
courage and honesty. A.M. Sperber is
well aware of these qualities in Mur
row; while reading the book you can
almost hear the sighs of infatuation

Whenever CBS-TV shows an episode
of its yupscale news magazine "West
57th," the grumpy old-timers in the
CBS news department complain,
"That's not the way Ed would have
wanted it." Every three weeks or so,
when commentator Bill Moyers vows

to leave network news for public tele
vision, he claims that network news
isn't being done "the way it was when
Ed was around." In almost any serious
discussion of radio and television
news, the name Ed is invoked like that
of a saint.
The "Ed" remembered with such
reverence is Edward R. Murrow (1908-
65), America's first great broadcast
newsman. He was a gifted reporter, not
so much because of his dedicated pur
suit of the truth, although that he cer
tainly had, but because of his rather
tight-lipped skepticism about those
who create news and, in the later years

of his career, those who bring news to
the public.
Good timing played a part in his fa
mous career. He was fortunate enough
to enter the field of radio news in its
infancy and later joined television
news on the ground floor as well.
Since there were no pre-existing stand
ards to conform to in each medium,
Murrow always followed his reporter's
instincts, no matter how many tersely
worded memos his corporate
employers might issue in protest.
All this is detailed in AM. Sperber's
"Murrow: His Life and Times," a
massive account of the newsman's life.

But while Sperber's biography is a real
brute at nearly 800 pages, there's no
sense of strain in the writing. One
never imagines Sperber huffing and
puffing over her subject, trying to in
ject an inflated drama into her ma
terial. She lets Murrow's opinions
speak for themselves, only occasionally
underlining the significance of the
events in his life.
And what a life it was. Reading this
book it's hard not to feel jealous of
Murrow: he got in on all the action of
the mid-20th century. The spread of
fascism in Europe, the bombing of
London, the European front in WWII,
the Korean War, the red scares of the
'50s, the Kennedy administration —
Murrow either covered all these events
or actually took part in them. For this
reason Sperber's book is not just an ex
cellent biography, it's also an engross
ing account of recent American history
as seen, like most things these days,
through the prism of broadcasting.
After college Murrow spent five
years working for the Institute of Inter
national Education, normally a student
exchange program but which, in the
mid-'3os, had become one of the few
means of escape for scholars fleeing
Hitler. In 1935, at the age of 27, Mur
row was hired by CBS Radio, and he
soon found himself working the 1936
presidential conventions, two of the
earliest major political events covered
by radio.
He carefully noted the role the
media played at the conventions, as the
candidates made sure their speeches
wouldn't run up against "Amos 'n'
Andy."
"I saw the power of the medium
demonstrated at first hand," Murrow
said later. "Few people, even those in
timately connected with broadcasting,
appreciate the potential power of this
medium in both national and interna
tional affairs."
Not surprisingly, then, it was Mur
row who elevated the brash and noisy
upstart of radio news, in his position as
CBS's foreign news director. Under his
guidance, radio provided instan
taneous coverage and analysis of the
deteriorating European situation.
While the BBC gave out dry, statistics
oriented news reports, Murrow's dis
patches (often reported with bombs
exploding in the background) had a

sociological feel, depicting a world in
transition. He solicited on the air the
opinions of common people, a
practice never adopted by the BBC.
More importantly, he made a point of
presenting opposing viewpoints on
every issue, a policy that struck the
BBC's government sponsors as being
vaguely heretical.
Sperber is at her best as an author
when she describes Murrow's experi
ences during World War 11. Her ac
count of the bombing of London is all
too vivid, an important reminder of
how tragic and destructive massive
bombing campaigns can be.
Celebrated for his war-time radio
broadcasts, Murrow then went on to
conquer the budding medium of tele
vision news, doing battle with both
spineless advertisers, who didn't want
to sponsor controversial programs,
and the red-baiting junior senator from
Wisconsin. The McCarthy era of the
mid-'sos, that infamous period when
our country decided to go insane for a
little while, is the centerpiece of Sper
ber's biography, and rightly so. It was
in 1954 that Murrow used all the clout
he had accumulated over the years, all
the trust the public placed in him, to at
tack Joseph McCarthy.
As the red scare gathered steam in
the late '40s and early '50s, Murrow
watched with growing dismay and con
tempt as one colleague after another
was blacklisted. He was alarmed at the
blatant disregard for civil liberties. He
instructed his "See It Now" news staff
to begin compiling a file on McCarthy.
The end result in March 1954 was "A
Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy."
The program was no report but a long
editorial against the senator, using film
of McCarthy speaking his own words to
condemn him. Yet Murrow also asked
the audience to acknowledge that the
national hysteria was not entirely
McCarthy's fault; the show ended with
Murrow turning to the camera and
quoting, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."
The McCarthy episode was the high
point of "See It Now," Murrow's
weekly documentary series for CBS

tertainment, the province of empty
headed trendies hired for their Ken
and-Barbie-doll good looks.

And yet, for all his high-mindedness,
Murrow also worked on such kitschy
fare as "Person to Person," a popular
television series in which he glibly in

media played at the conventions, as the
candidates made sure their speeches
wouldn't run up against "Amos 'n'
Andy."
"I saw the power of the medium
demonstrated at first hand," Murrow
said later. "Few people, even those in
timately connected with broadcasting,
appreciate the potential power of this
medium in both national and interna
tional affairs."
Not surprisingly, then, it was Mur
row who elevated the brash and noisy
upstart of radio news, in his position as
CBS's foreign news director. Under his
guidance, radio provided instan
taneous coverage and analysis of the
deteriorating European situation.
While the BBC gave out dry, statistics
oriented news reports, Murrow's dis
patches (often reported with bombs
exploding in the background) had a

sociological feel, depicting a world in
transition. He solicited on the air the
opinions of common people, a
practice never adopted by the BBC.
More importantly, he made a point of
presenting opposing viewpoints on
every issue, a policy that struck the
BBC's government sponsors as being
vaguely heretical.
Sperber is at her best as an author
when she describes Murrow's experi
ences during World War 11. Her ac
count of the bombing of London is all
too vivid, an important reminder of
how tragic and destructive massive
bombing campaigns can be.
Celebrated for his war-time radio
broadcasts, Murrow then went on to
conquer the budding medium of tele
vision news, doing battle with both
spineless advertisers, who didn't want
to sponsor controversial programs,
and the red-baiting junior senator from
Wisconsin. The McCarthy era of the
mid-'sos, that infamous period when
our country decided to go insane for a
little while, is the centerpiece of Sper
ber's biography, and rightly so. It was
in 1954 that Murrow used all the clout
he had accumulated over the years, all
the trust the public placed in him, to at
tack Joseph McCarthy.
As the red scare gathered steam in
the late '40s and early '50s, Murrow
watched with growing dismay and con
tempt as one colleague after another
was blacklisted. He was alarmed at the
blatant disregard for civil liberties. He
instructed his "See It Now" news staff
to begin compiling a file on McCarthy.
The end result in March 1954 was "A
Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy."
The program was no report but a long
editorial against the senator, using film
of McCarthy speaking his own words to
condemn him. Yet Murrow also asked
the audience to acknowledge that the
national hysteria was not entirely
McCarthy's fault; the show ended with
Murrow turning to the camera and
quoting, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."
The McCarthy episode was the high
point of "See It Now," Murrow's
weekly documentary series for CBS
TV, the forerunner of "60 Minutes" and
all the rest. Murrow's cinematic good
looks, coupled with his ever-serious
demeanor, made him the perfect tele
vision newsman. "A cool host suited to

a cool medium." Sperber calls him.
Backed up by Murrow's keen grasp of
politics and history, the program
looked at racial segregation, the Cold
War, blacklisting, the Korean War and
the plight of migrant workers (in the
celebrated "Harvest ot Shame" seg
ment). Murrow demonstrated that tele
vision news need not be vacuous en
tertainment, the province of empty
headed trendies hired for their Ken
and-Barbie-doll good looks.

And yet, for all his high-mindedness,
Murrow also worked on such kitschy
fare as "Person to Person," a popular
television series in which he glibly in
terviewed celebrities. When asked why
he bothered, he replied, "Listen, do
you know what I can get away with be
cause Person to Person' is a big hit?"
Murrow died in 1965 of lung cancer.
His last few years were spent directing
the U.S. Information Agency for John F.
Kennedy. He had been quietly phased
out of CBS after a famous 1958 speech
in which he bit into the hand that fed
him and refused to let go. "The top
management of the (television) net
works," he said, "with a few notable
exceptions, has been trained in adver
tising, research or show business. But
by the nature of the corporate
structure, they also make the final and
crucial decisions having to do with
news and public affairs. Frequently
they have neither the time nor the
competence to do this."
This speech, given nearly 30 years
ago, applies all too accurately to the
current state of broadcasting.
"Television is being used to distract,
delude, amuse and insulate us," Mur
row continued. "This could be the
most exciting and fruitful means of
communication yet devised, but it is in
the hands of timid and avaricious men
and the public appears to be largely
apathetic."
You tell 'em, Ed.
We need more people like Edward
R. Murrow, with his intelligence,
courage and honesty. A.M. Sperber is
well aware of these qualities in Mur
row; while reading the book you can
almost hear the sighs of infatuation
coming from the pages. But if Sperber
is a little in love with her subject, it's
understandable. After reading this
book, I think I'm a little in love with
him myself.
