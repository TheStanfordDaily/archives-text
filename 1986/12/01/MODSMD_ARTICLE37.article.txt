# Japan center announced

The University yesterday officially announced the es
tablishment of a new study center for Stanford students
in Kyoto, Japan, with the cooperation of Kyoto University.
The announcement was made by President Yasunori
Nishijima of Kyoto University and University President
Donald Kennedy in an informal ceremony at the Kyoto
campus.
The center will provide two programs, which will of
fer to a wide spectrum of Stanford students classes about
Japanese economic and industrial organization, plus life
and culture, as well as a focal point for research and aca
demic exchanges between faculties of the two univer
sities.
"Most of the overseas programs since their founding
nearly 30 years ago have been general studies programs,
concentrated in the humanities and Euro-centered," ac
cording to Law Prof. Thomas Heller, director of the
Overseas Studies Program. The Overseas Studies Pro
gram will administer the new center.
"Now we will build on these strengths by designing
programs with curricula that are integrated with a wide
range of concentrations on the home campus, including
engineering, computer science, business and technol
ogy, Heller said. "At the same time, we need to reach

out into other places in the world that have become im
portant to Americans."
The first of the two programs, the Stanford Center for
Technology and Innovation, will provide six months of
study in Kyoto for Stanford students preparing for tech
nical, managerial or governmental roles. Classes, to be
taught in English by Stanford and Japanese professors,
will focus on the study of technology and innovation and
their impact upon advanced industrial societies.
After three months of classes, the students — 25 to 30
at a time are expected — will spend another three
months as interns at Japanese and multinational firms.
Young middle-management Japanese and Americans are
expected to be sent to Kyoto by their firms to participate
in special programs and to join the students in the
classes as auditors.
The second program, the Kyoto Program in Japanese
Studies, is designed for students with a strong back
ground in Japanese language and culture.
By providing students with an opportunity to study in
Japan, the University hopes to "build a core of technically
trained students able to operate in Japan with the same
ease that technically trained Japanese students now oper
ate in the United States," Heller said.

Pendleton for attacking the motives and integrity" of his
opponents, stating that that had cost Pendleton the chance
to "exert effective influence" on the commission.
Concerned about audits indicating mismanagement at the
commission, Congress in October cut its budget from $11.8
million in the last fiscal year to million in the current
fiscal year. J. Al Latham, Jr., who became staff director of the
commission in December 1985, resigned last month, com
plaining that Congress had "hobbled" the agency.
The commission, which Congress established in 1957 to
wipe out discrimination and racism, is an advisor}' body that
can hold hearings and submit recommendations to
Congress and the president. It has no legislative power, but
many of its recommendations have been incorporated into
the laws. The Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act were
passed during its first 10 years.
Congress should seriously consider eliminating the com
mission, Bunzel told the New York Times, because "the
agency may no longer have significant work to do. The
original mandate of the commission, to equalize rights, has
to a significant extent been accomplished, although not
completed, in the last 30 years."
If the commission continues to exist, it should focus on
the economic and educational problems of "the black un
derclass in America," but must acknowledge that "racism
and overt discrimination are not responsible for all the ills
that still trap millions of blacks in failure and despair."
The commission also needs to bring attention to such
problems as teen-age pregnancy among unwed blacks, Bun
zel told the Times.
