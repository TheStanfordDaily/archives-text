TOKYO — If you had to take a
football game with every twist im
aginable and package it for export,
you couldn't do much better than
yesterday's Stanford-Arizona game
(Saturday California time).
Stanford's special teams scored
two touchdowns and a safety to lead
the Cardinal to a 29-24 victory over
the Wildcats in front of an enthusias

Stadium in the Coca-Cola Bowl.

After Arizona's Gary Coston made a
27-yard field goal despite a deflection
by Darron Bennett to put the
Wildcats ahead 17-16, Kevin Scott
took the ensuing kickoff 88 yards the

other way, breaking clean through
the initial wave, side-stepping kicker
Jeff Walder and outrunning four
Wildcats to the end zone to give Stan
ford a lead it never relinquished.
"We didn't do anything different,"
Scott said. "The difference was we
got it to work. We've been close to
breaking one the last three weeks,
but there's always been one prob

"It was plain and simple, the spe

Coach Larry Smith said. "They've
been strong all year, but they let us
down today."
Stanford quarterback John Paye,
whose right shoulder has been get
ting sorer as the season has
progressed, was forced to leave the
game midway through the third quar

complete 5-of-7 passes for 75 yards
and scored his first collegiate touch
down, a one-yard quarterback sneak
with 5:37 to play that gave Stanford a
