# Animal activists' trial to end
## 
### KRISTIN BARENDSEN Staff writer 
The trial of seven animal rights activists ar
rested at Stanford in April, which began Nov.
17 at the Palo Alto Municipal Courthouse, is
expected to end tomorrow, according to Dep
uty District Attorney Karvn Sinunu.
Sinunu show ed the jury a videotape of the
demonstration as part of her prosecution.
Seventy members of various animal rights
groups entered the Psychology Department's
Jordan Hall, earning signs, chanting and de
manding unscheduled open access to psycho
logical experiments on laboratory animals.
After the protesters occupied the fifth floor
for more than three hours, the Stanford
police arrested 19 people for intending to dis
rupt and actually disrupting business.
The seven who stand trial pleaded not
guilty to the charges.
The court also heard testimony from three
people involved in research at Stanford, all of
whom claimed that their experiments suf
fered losses because of the protest.
Grace Hegywara. a human subject in an ex
periment on cystic fibrosa and Cindy Bishop,
who assists in research on muscular

dystrophy, both said that the disruption cost
them time and money.
Psychology Prof. Richard Thompson tes
tified that he was forced to shut down his lab
oratory for the day at a cost to the University
of an estimated $2,000 in labor and materials.
His research on memory involves recording
the activity of the brain cells of New Zealand
white rabbits and is "totally painless" to the
rabbits, he said.
As of last Wednesday two defendants had
taken the stand. Sharon Proetti, who said she
had once rescued an elephant from a circus,
said she joined the protest because she
"wanted Stanford to open its doors," and that
she would not have made her ppint without
being arrested. When questioned by Sinunu
about her personal attitude toward animals
and products that use animals, Proetti replied
that she w ill kill fleas on her dogs and use hair
dye that is tested on laboratory animals, but
she draws the line there.
Proetti wept throughout most of her tes
timony, according to Sinunu.
Debbie Funai briefly began her testimony
before the courtroom closed for the holiday
weekend.
The defendants face a maximum sentence

of a $1,000 fine or six months in jail.
According to Sinunu, Judge Patricia
Bamattre-Manoukian must decide if the
protester's chanting and excessive noise falls
under the category of egregious conduct. If it
does, the defendants may receive a slightly
stiffer penalty than they would otherwise.
Sinunu was unable to predict how
Manoukian would decide.
More than 20 activists who demonstrated
outside the couthouse when the proceedings
began were permitted to view the trial quietly
on the condition that they bring no signs into
the courtroom.
The April 24 protest for which the animal
rights activists are on trial and a protest held
outside University President Donald Ken
nedy's office Nov. 10 were backed by In
Defense of Animals (IDA).
The group has demanded more open
access to Stanford facilities where research is
conducted using laboratory animals. Dr. Elliot
Katz, founder of IDA, has said that the inspec
tions of the facilities by federal agents such as
the U.S. Department of Agriculture are inade
quate and fail to reveal "cruel and unneces
sary" treatment performed by the ex
perimenters.
