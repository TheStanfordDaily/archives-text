Reagan defiant as crisis deepens
WASHINGTON — A defiant President Reagan returned to Washington
yesterday night facing a deepening crisis over the secret Iranian and
Nicaraguan operations with a pledge that "I'm not going to back off," and
saying the storm of criticism has left "bitter bile in my throat these days."
In an interview with Time magazine published yesterday, Reagan des
cribed Lt. Col. Oliver North, whom he fired from the National Security
Council staff last week for his involvement in the clandestine operations, as
"a national hero" and added, "My only criticism is that I wasn't told every
thing."
"I've never seen the sharks circling like they are now with blood in the
water," the president said, in remarkably blunt language. "What is driving
me up the wall is that this wasn't a failure until the press got a tip from that
rag in Beirut and began to play it up. I told them that publicity could
destroy this, that it could get people killed. They then went right on."
Reagan repeatedly attacked American media reporting of the Iran and
Nicaragua operations in his comments last Wednesday to Time columnist
Hugh Sidey, his first public remarks since the disclosure last Tuesday that
money from the Iran weapons sales was diverted to help the Nicaraguan
rebels. Reagan's national security adviser, Vice Adm. John Poindexter,
resigned and North was fired when the secret deals were made public by
Attorney General Edwin Meese.
An unrepentant Reagan vowed to press forward despite the controversy.
"This is a Beltway bloodletting," he said. "Frankly, I believe that as the truth
comes out, people will see what we were trying to do was right. I'm not
going to back off; I'm not going to crawl in a hole. I'm going to go forward.
I have a lot of things to do in this job."
Before the president left his California ranch yesterday, White House
chief of staff Donald Regan said the administration might not use executive
privilege to shield some officials from testifying before Congress, but said
his own advice to the president would be protected from disclosure.
Israel shipped obsolete parts
WASHINGTON — Israeli arms brokers substituted obsolete anti-aircraft
missile parts in a secret November 1985 arms shipment to Iran, angering
the Iranians and causing the Reagan White House to begin sending weap
ons directly from U.S. military stocks, informed U.S. and Israeli sources
said yesterday.
Iranian military officers had given the Israelis a list of specific spare parts
for a type of anti-aircraft battery known as Improved Hawk, or I-Hawk, but
for reasons that are not clear they received parts for an older, less sophisti
cated version of the Hawk.
The November shipment was eventually returned to Israel, and the inci
dent led the White House to stop using the Israeli arms brokers as inter
mediaries in the shipments. Those Israelis had begun the clandestine oper
ation with tacit U.S. approval in the fall of 1985, when two arms shipments
to Tehran resulted in the Sept. 14 release of the Rev. Benjamin Weir, who
had been held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.
The White House opted to begin selling parts directly from the U.S. arse
nal for what became four subsequent shipments this year. The Iranians
paid millions of dollars more than the $12 million value of the weapons
into a Swiss bank account, and some of those profits were secretly diverted
to aid Nicaraguan contras, according to administration disclosures last
week.
Sikh gunmen kill 24 Hindus
NEW DELHI, India — Sikh gunmen herded Hindu passengers off a bus
in Punjab State yesterday and killed 24 of them with submachine gun fire,
news agency reports from Punjab said.
Police officials in the state capital, Chandigarh, said a young Sikh pas
senger pulled out a revolver, held it to the driver's head and forced him to
stop the bus on a deserted road in Hoshiarpur district, the reports said. The
man, with three accomplices, then ordered the 40 or so passengers off the
bus, gathered the Hindus together and opened fire on them from close
range, they said.
Police described yesterday's attack, near the village of Khudda, as the
worst single terrorist act in Punjab's four years of violence between Sikhs
and Hindus, news agencies said.
A similar attack last July, in which Sikh gunmen killed 14 Hindu bus pas
sengers in Punjab, ignited riots in New Delhi between Sikhs and Hindus.
With the news of yesterday's massacre, police here in the capital immedi
ately ordered an alert and mounted extra patrols and roadblocks around
the city.
Three women were among those said killed in yesterday's attack, and
eight persons were reported injured. The gunmen reportedly escaped on
motor scooters that pulled up immediately after the shooting.
S. Africans resent U.S. policies
PRETORIA, South Africa — As the new U.S. economic sanctions begin to
bite and more American companies pull out, South Africa is being swept by
a wave of angry, anti-American resentment — and an even stiffer deter
mination by whites to resist foreign pressures for change.
"Go Home Yanks!" posters put up on Pretoria street corners declared a
few days ago. "Hypocrisy is cheaper by the dollar!" say handbills dis
tributed at shopping centers here and around Johannesburg. And state-run
Radio South Africa, in a commentary reflecting government thinking, said
last week, "South Africans can no longer look upon the United States as a
friendly country."
Nowhere is this anger stronger and the resentment deeper than in the
government of President Pieter Botha and his ruling National Party.
"The United States has already declared economic war against us for the
most absurd and sanctimonious reasons," Botha said in a bitter speech last
week. "In doing so, they have yet again taken up the sword against us on
behalf of the Soviet Union and its goals in this region."
Gorbachev plans foreign visits
MOSCOW — Fresh from a triumphal trip to India, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev is considering travel to Italy, Greece, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina
and Japan in 1987.
Unless Soviet-American relations improve remarkably in coming
months, however, he probably will not make it to the United States next
year as proposed for a third summit session with President Reagan.
Gorbachev, who clearly enjoys his overseas outings, could become the
most widely traveled Kremlin chief since the globe-trotting days of Nikita
Khrushchev in the 1950s and early 1960s if he keeps up his present pace.
Energetic and articulate, Gorbachev presents himself as the leading
champion of nuclear disarmament and a "new Soviet man" who wants to
heal scars and divisions dating from the Cold War era.

ation with tacit U.S. approval in the fall of 1985, when two arms shipments
to Tehran resulted in the Sept. 14 release of the Rev. Benjamin Weir, who
had been held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.
The White House opted to begin selling parts directly from the U.S. arse

paid millions of dollars more than the $12 million value of the weapons

Sikh gunmen kill 24 Hindus
NEW DELHI, India — Sikh gunmen herded Hindu passengers off a bus
in Punjab State yesterday and killed 24 of them with submachine gun fire,
news agency reports from Punjab said.
Police officials in the state capital, Chandigarh, said a young Sikh pas
senger pulled out a revolver, held it to the driver's head and forced him to
stop the bus on a deserted road in Hoshiarpur district, the reports said. The
man, with three accomplices, then ordered the 40 or so passengers off the
bus, gathered the Hindus together and opened fire on them from close
range, they said.
Police described yesterday's attack, near the village of Khudda, as the
worst single terrorist act in Punjab's four years of violence between Sikhs
and Hindus, news agencies said.
A similar attack last July, in which Sikh gunmen killed 14 Hindu bus pas
sengers in Punjab, ignited riots in New Delhi between Sikhs and Hindus.
With the news of yesterday's massacre, police here in the capital immedi
ately ordered an alert and mounted extra patrols and roadblocks around
the city.
Three women were among those said killed in yesterday's attack, and
eight persons were reported injured. The gunmen reportedly escaped on
motor scooters that pulled up immediately after the shooting.
S. Africans resent U.S. policies
PRETORIA, South Africa — As the new U.S. economic sanctions begin to
bite and more American companies pull out, South Africa is being swept by
a wave of angry, anti-American resentment — and an even stiffer deter
mination by whites to resist foreign pressures for change.
"Go Home Yanks!" posters put up on Pretoria street corners declared a
few days ago. "Hypocrisy is cheaper by the dollar!" say handbills dis
tributed at shopping centers here and around Johannesburg. And state-run
Radio South Africa, in a commentary reflecting government thinking, said
last week, "South Africans can no longer look upon the United States as a
friendly country."
Nowhere is this anger stronger and the resentment deeper than in the
government of President Pieter Botha and his ruling National Party.
"The United States has already declared economic war against us for the
most absurd and sanctimonious reasons," Botha said in a bitter speech last
week. "In doing so, they have yet again taken up the sword against us on
behalf of the Soviet Union and its goals in this region."
Gorbachev plans foreign visits
MOSCOW — Fresh from a triumphal trip to India, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev is considering travel to Italy, Greece, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina
and Japan in 1987.
Unless Soviet-American relations improve remarkably in coming
months, however, he probably will not make it to the United States next
year as proposed for a third summit session with President Reagan.
Gorbachev, who clearly enjoys his overseas outings, could become the
most widely traveled Kremlin chief since the globe-trotting days of Nikita
Khrushchev in the 1950s and early 1960s if he keeps up his present pace.
Energetic and articulate, Gorbachev presents himself as the leading
champion of nuclear disarmament and a "new Soviet man" who wants to
heal scars and divisions dating from the Cold War era.

Reagan defiant as crisis deepens
WASHINGTON — A defiant President Reagan returned to Washington
yesterday night facing a deepening crisis over the secret Iranian and
Nicaraguan operations with a pledge that "I'm not going to back off," and
saying the storm of criticism has left "bitter bile in my throat these days."
In an interview with Time magazine published yesterday, Reagan des
cribed Lt. Col. Oliver North, whom he fired from the National Security
Council staff last week for his involvement in the clandestine operations, as
"a national hero" and added, "My only criticism is that I wasn't told every
thing."
"I've never seen the sharks circling like they are now with blood in the
water," the president said, in remarkably blunt language. "What is driving
me up the wall is that this wasn't a failure until the press got a tip from that
rag in Beirut and began to play it up. I told them that publicity could
destroy this, that it could get people killed. They then went right on."
Reagan repeatedly attacked American media reporting of the Iran and
Nicaragua operations in his comments last Wednesday to Time columnist
Hugh Sidey, his first public remarks since the disclosure last Tuesday that
money from the Iran weapons sales was diverted to help the Nicaraguan
rebels. Reagan's national security adviser, Vice Adm. John Poindexter,
resigned and North was fired when the secret deals were made public by
Attorney General Edwin Meese.
An unrepentant Reagan vowed to press forward despite the controversy.
"This is a Beltway bloodletting," he said. "Frankly, I believe that as the truth
comes out, people will see what we were trying to do was right. I'm not
going to back off; I'm not going to crawl in a hole. I'm going to go forward.
I have a lot of things to do in this job."
Before the president left his California ranch yesterday, White House
chief of staff Donald Regan said the administration might not use executive
privilege to shield some officials from testifying before Congress, but said
his own advice to the president would be protected from disclosure.
Israel shipped obsolete parts
WASHINGTON — Israeli arms brokers substituted obsolete anti-aircraft
missile parts in a secret November 1985 arms shipment to Iran, angering
the Iranians and causing the Reagan White House to begin sending weap
ons directly from U.S. military stocks, informed U.S. and Israeli sources
said yesterday.
Iranian military officers had given the Israelis a list of specific spare parts
for a type of anti-aircraft battery known as Improved Hawk, or I-Hawk, but
for reasons that are not clear they received parts for an older, less sophisti
cated version of the Hawk.
The November shipment was eventually returned to Israel, and the inci
dent led the White House to stop using the Israeli arms brokers as inter
mediaries in the shipments. Those Israelis had begun the clandestine oper
ation with tacit U.S. approval in the fall of 1985, when two arms shipments
to Tehran resulted in the Sept. 14 release of the Rev. Benjamin Weir, who
