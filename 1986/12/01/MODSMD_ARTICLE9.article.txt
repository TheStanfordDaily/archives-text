# Reagan urged to call Congress

### 
WASHINGTON — Outgoing Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
called on President Reagan yesterday
to convene Congress in an extraordi
nary special session on Wednesday to
create a Watergate-style committee to
investigate the secret funneling of Iran
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan
contras.
Dole's recommendation for the first
special session of Congress since Harry
Truman called one 38 years ago con
tributed to a growing sense of urgency
and turmoil over the controversy that
Republicans and Democrats say is
threatening to paralyze the Reagan ad
ministration in its final two years.
Demands mounted for a general
housecleaning within the administra
tion, appointment of an independent
counsel to take over the investigation
from the Justice Department and ap
pointment of a select bipartisan panel
to take charge of congressional probes
into the matter. There was also widen
ing skepticism over administration
claims that knowledge of the affair was
limited to the president's former na

tional security adviser, Vice Adm. John
Poindexter, and one of Poindexter's
key aides, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North.
"I don't think Ripley would believe
that," Dole said in an interview yester
day on ABC News' "This Week With
David Brinkley."
Reagan, who returned to the White
House late yesterday from a four-day
vacation at his California mountain
ranch, told reporters, "We're going to
get to the bottom of this, and then we'll
make it known."
In response to Dole's call for a spe
cial session, White House spokesman
Dan Howard said, "That's a novel idea.
We simply have not had time to con
sider it."
Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd
(D-W.Va.) also proposed a select com
mittee, but rejected the idea of a spe
cial session to appoint the panel before
Congress reconvenes Jan. 6. "I think
that (a special session) would probably
be an overreaction.... I think we
ought to be careful we don't overreact
and create an atmosphere of hysteria
and crisis."

Dole, a potential presidential candi
date in 1988, said of Reagan: "He has to
lay it all out. I would hope he would
call a special session of Congress next
week and form this select committee.
Otherwise we're going to have 15 or
20 committees investigating this prob
lem." An aide said later that Dole
urged the White House to reconvene
Congress this Wednesday.
The aide said the departing majority
leader conveyed the proposal for a
special session this morning by tele
phone to White House congressional
liaison chief Will Ball, who said he
would pass it to the president. Dole
said he had not discussed the idea with
Reagan directly.
Dole's proposal for a special session
— which would bring the 99th
Congress, with the Senate still in Re
publican hands, back to Washington a
month before the opening of the
Democrat-controlled 100 th Congress
— drew generally cool reaction from
Democrats as well as some
Republicans.
"We'll be back in a month This

isn't something you're going to do in
12 or 24 hours or a week," said an aide
to House Majority Leader Jim Wright
(D-Tex.).
"Congress just wants to get into the
act because it's miffed it hasn't been in
the act before this," said House
Minority Whip Trent Lott (R-Miss.). "It
would only complicate the process."
Rep. Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.), head of
the House Republican Policy Commit
tee, supported the call for a special ses
sion. "It would let us focus the effort.
Otherwise we're going to have
numerous committees on both sides
crawling all over the whole thing."
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) has
privately endorsed a select committee,
referring to it as "the proper course,"
according to an aide. Lugar, appearing
yesterday on NBC News' "Meet the
Press," strongly urged Reagan to "take
charge immediately.... He needs a
new staff at the White House. He may
need new Cabinet members."
