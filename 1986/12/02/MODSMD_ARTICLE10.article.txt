## Branner Envy 
### 
The grass is always greener on Branner Halls lawn.
And that's not all.
Branner freshmen throw wilder parties than all other
freshmen, Branner resident assistants run more activities
than all other RAs, and Branner alumni stay truer to their
freshman dorm than all other alumni.
Sarcasm? Hardly. 1 suffer from a serious malady known
as Branner Envy.
1 he first signs came early in my freshman year. Norm
Robinson and his cohorts in Residential Education had
put me in Florence Moore, and older students told me
that spelled trouble. When the RAs there decided to can
cel the annual "Screw Your Roommate" party because
they deemed it "bilaterally sexist," I realized I was in for
quite a year. I was right.
A few examples:
The highlights of residential education at my dorm
were playing Trivial Pursuit and reading sections of a
Herant Katchadourian textbook aloud.
Our intramural teams suffered because half the dorm
attended classes in the late afternoon for Structured
Liberal Education, the Western Culture track for the
gifted.
We acquired, or inherited, a reputation as a deadly
dull dorm, and soon other residences declared a cam
puswide boycott on our parties.
Meanwhile, Branner was hosting riveting speakers,
putting on plays, fielding IM teams that could compete
with the Phi Delts, partying until 4 a.m. and dumping up

wards of 11 million crickets in Wilbur dorms that dared
challenge it in a prank war.
Three years later the Branner mystique is still there,
and Stanford is left to wonder why the same residence
invariably leads the freshman community in spirit.
The first factor is size. More than 170 freshmen live in
close quarters at Branner, a unique arrangement in the
University. "Undiluted freshman enthusiasm," as one
Branner alumna calls it.
The second factor is leadership. Resident Fellow Ken
nell Jackson, dedicated to providing Branner residents
with an unforgettable freshman experience, signs up
high-powered RAs and lines up big-name speakers and
makes sure that his efforts do not go unnoticed in the
community.
The third factor is reputation. Branner is, by tradition,
full of excitement, and freshmen there are always ex
pected to be active and extroverted. The dorm's success
can be attributed in part to a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Surprisingly, some Branner alumni tell me they wish
they had lived elsewhere as freshmen. They complain
that the dormitory is too large — a smaller dorm, some
contend, fosters deeper friendships — and they say the
loud music and wild parties grow tiresome after a few
months.
I choose to ignore these complaints. Rather, 1 will con
tinue to feel, perhaps for years, that my life might some
how have been different had I begun my Stanford career
in Branner Hall.
