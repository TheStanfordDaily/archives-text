# Walker suit to go to court
## $2 million award requested in discrimination case 
### MARCUS MABRY Editorial staff 
Stanford employee Betty Walker and the University will
probably not settle a $2 million discrimination suit before
the case is heard in Santa Clara Superior Court, according to
Procurement Director James Gallaher.
"Basically, I think, at this point it has to come out in
court," Gallaher said.
Walker filed a $2 million suit against the University in
June, charging that she was the subject of racial and sexual
discrimination while working for the Procurement Office of
the University Controller.
Currently, depositions for the suit are being taken from
both sides.
Walker received a letter yesterday from the University that
she and her attorney, Jack Robertson, believe may alter the
nature of the case, and both were cautious about comment
ing on the case until Robertson was able to thoroughly
review the letter, probably today.
But, Robertson did release the following statement:
"Mrs. Walker has had outstanding performance evalua
tions since her employment at Stanford. As a result, she was
promoted to manager of Special Contracts in October 1985.
Because at that time she objected to the salary given her in
her new position, she has been subject to continous harrass
ment by her supervisors with nagging criticism of her work,
demotion and withholding of normal salary increases."
Walker's suit names as dependents the University, Gal-
Jaher and Procurement Operations Manager Larry Wolfson,
Robertson said. Robertson is a partner in the Menlo Park law
firm of Robertson, Alexander, Luther, Esselstein, Sheills and

Wright.
Walker, in a statement released last month, stated she was
"terminated by ... Gallaher ... after she went to Ken
Creighton, controller, and William Massey, vice president of
Business and Finance, and complained about her salary ad
justment and other (racial) and sexual inequities."
Walker, a black woman, still works for the Procurement
Department.
In the earlier release, she said she was terminated from
her position as one of five managers in the Procurement De
partment in February and was "subjected to batten 1 and
prolonged harrassment."
Gallaher says Walker's suit is unfounded and her allega
tions untrue.
"My position, and the University's position, is that none of
the things she has said is true," he said. "I'm sure that she
thinks they are."
In response, Walker said, referring specifically to the bat
tery charge, that she has witnesses to attest to the validity of
her allegations and that they will testify at the hearing.
Gallaher added that Walker was never terminated. She
was merely demoted to her previous position after it
became clear that she could not adequately perform the job
of manager of Special Contracts in the Controller's Procure
ment Office.
"It was a matter of her not being able to handle the
manager's job. There were letters and letters mailed to her
explaining why she couldn't handle the job," he said.
Walker pointed to yesterday's letter as further harrass
ment from the University. Although she was not willing to
fully disclose its contents, she said it did threaten her posi
tion.
