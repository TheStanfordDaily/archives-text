The credibility of an administration is on the line. The
effectiveness of a president in the last two years of his
term is in the balance. The trust of a people in its govern
ment hangs on every new development. It is essential
that someone somehow get to the bottom of the Iran
arms controversy before irreparable damage is done to
President Reagan and the great faith Americans have
shown in him.
Anyone who is truly interested in uncovering all the
answers to the Iran fiasco and the reported links to the
Nicaraguan contras knows that only an independent in
vestigator from outside the administration — a special
prosecutor — can do the job fully. Only when such an
impartial investigation is complete and the answers are
known can Americans put the debacle behind them and
look to the urgent issues confronting the nation.
The Iran affair warrants a full-scale criminal investiga
tion. U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese has called in
the FBI, but the FBI is responsible to Meese, Reagan's
friend and adviser. Clearly, Meese is not the man for the
job if the administration is interested in establishing facts
beyond a shadow of a doubt.
By his actions in the affair thus far, Meese has shown
himself to be at best an unauthoritative leader and at
worst a political pawn determined only to protect the
president. Last week, after it was revealed that money
from arms sales to Iran was diverted to the contras,
Meese stated that Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North was the

only man in the administration fully aware of the pro
gram. Later, Meese backed off a bit, admitting that per
haps "consultants and other people [who] have a tangen
tial relationship to the United States government" might
have known of the operation.
More recently, reports have surfaced that North
shredded documents in the White House basement
before locks were changed. Meese's "investigation"
looks more like an exercise in shielding the president
and diverting blame to relatively minor officials. Meese
seems to be following his own advice of last week, to
stand "shoulder to shoulder" with other administration
officials in the crisis.
Equally absurd is Reagan's appointment of former
Sen. John Tower to head a review of the role of the Na
tional Security Council, the agency where North worked.
Tower, a Reagan ally and close adviser to former Na
tional Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, presents the
same problems as Meese. An insider cannot be counted
upon to carry out a thorough investigation and win the
confidence of the nation.
Americans want some answers to some very serious
questions, especially: Who knew of the operation? Who
didn't? If they didn't know, why not? For the good of the
country, and for the good of the government at this
pivotal time in so many crucial issues, the truth must be
uncovered, and uncovered in as indisputable a way as
possible.
