# Smokers vs. non-smokers
## 
### 
I heard on the news last week that
there were a few businessmen on an
airplane, and, although they were told
repeatedly, they refused to put out
their cigarettes. Not even the pilot's im
plorations would sway them to extin
guish their hand-held smoke colonies.
Subsequently, when the plane landed,
the five were arrested. The question I
ask is: "How could society give rise to
such callous people?"
Not the smokers. I'm talking about
the moralizing throng of non-smokers.
Firstly, I have to emphasize that I
don't smoke either; nor do I intend to.
My problem is with my fellow non
smokers. How can we be so self
righteous? Perhaps the most interest
ing side effect of the smoke vs. anti
smoke war is the shift of which side
can be pushy. At the moment, society
seems to allow any form of terrorism
directed at smokers.
The premier whine of most non
smokers is the "second-hand smoke"
argument: the belief that being near
smokers is as bad as being a smoker.
And you can pick up AIDS through
casual contact. And the Easter Bunny
really exists too. Admittedly, some
amount of lung disease is probably
transmitted by being in persistent,

close contact with smokers. But that
amount is not to any degree compara
ble to what would be encountered in
the atmosphere anyway. Let's face facts:
Anyone who fears lung poisoning from
external sources has picked the wrong
society to live in.
Have you ever visited South Bend,
Indiana? There's a town where you
keep your car windows rolled up, even
if it's 95 degrees and you don't have air
conditioning. Yes, it's really that bad.
Towns like Los Angeles are only
slightly less offensive. The point is that
lung cancer is in the atmosphere
waiting for you anyway, so claiming
personal health as an excuse to assault
smokers is pretty ludicrous.
But imagine that we anti-smokers
had a real reason to hate smokers. Is
that any reason for the social barba
rism directed at smokers these days? I
don't believe so. For some, smoking is
an addiction, but is help available? Yes,
but for a price. If offices are going to
ban smoking altogether, as has hap
pened in many places recently, they
must make resources available that
help people quit smoking. This, of
course, assumes the Bill of Rights has
been conveniently forgotten, in
making these kinds of across-the-board
regulations in places of work.
Now, it's not like smokers aren't
rude; if someone exhales smoke in
your face, you have every reason to
want to assault them physically. But it
seems that the present slant of society
allows one to lash out verbally at some
one 15 feet away at the mere sight of a
lit match. Don't believe that? Try to
light a cigarette in a non-smoking sec
tion of an airplane; I've seen the
results, and they're not pretty. It takes
about five to 10 seconds for
obscenities to be shouted. Maybe that's
an extreme case, but it shows the ex
treme problem with many non
smokers: We're capable of being

positively rabid!
The ultimate concern is how society
can condone such wanton hatred
against one group. We pat ourselves on
the back because racial groups aren't
systematically attacked (much), but we
simultaneously condone mass hatred
against a section of the population that
Chooses to burn out its innards. That's
their choice; the rest of the world has
no right to pass judgment on their self
destructiveness. The attempt is made
to show that smoking is an offense
against society, but with ozone
annihilating automobiles and smoke
stacks the size of some towers, it's a
petty offense.
So is it possible to have rules that are
fair for all involved? Perhaps. Stan
ford's regulation on smoking is rather
fair, although it allows one person in a
crowd of 20 to (supposedly) keep the
other 19 from lighting up. Still, it con
siders the opinions and needs of both
sides of the fence, as opposed to the
supercilious "thou shalt not smoke"
ordinances adopted in some areas. If
life is fair, maybe we'll see more of the
equitable regulations of Stanford's va
riety. Then we won't have asinine
scenes with local police confronting
five men and arresting them for
"illegal smoking."
C'mon, try to picture that in your
mind's eye. Can you imagine anything
much more stupid?

I heard on the news last week that
there were a few businessmen on an
airplane, and, although they were told
repeatedly, they refused to put out
their cigarettes. Not even the pilot's im
plorations would sway them to extin
guish their hand-held smoke colonies.
Subsequently, when the plane landed,
the five were arrested. The question I
ask is: "How could society give rise to
such callous people?"
Not the smokers. I'm talking about
the moralizing throng of non-smokers.
Firstly, I have to emphasize that I
don't smoke either; nor do I intend to.
My problem is with my fellow non
smokers. How can we be so self
righteous? Perhaps the most interest
ing side effect of the smoke vs. anti
smoke war is the shift of which side
can be pushy. At the moment, society
seems to allow any form of terrorism
directed at smokers.
The premier whine of most non
smokers is the "second-hand smoke"
argument: the belief that being near
smokers is as bad as being a smoker.
And you can pick up AIDS through
casual contact. And the Easter Bunny
really exists too. Admittedly, some
amount of lung disease is probably
transmitted by being in persistent,

close contact with smokers. But that
amount is not to any degree compara
ble to what would be encountered in
the atmosphere anyway. Let's face facts:
Anyone who fears lung poisoning from
external sources has picked the wrong
society to live in.
Have you ever visited South Bend,
Indiana? There's a town where you
keep your car windows rolled up, even
if it's 95 degrees and you don't have air
conditioning. Yes, it's really that bad.
Towns like Los Angeles are only
slightly less offensive. The point is that
lung cancer is in the atmosphere
waiting for you anyway, so claiming
personal health as an excuse to assault
smokers is pretty ludicrous.
But imagine that we anti-smokers
had a real reason to hate smokers. Is
that any reason for the social barba
rism directed at smokers these days? I
don't believe so. For some, smoking is
an addiction, but is help available? Yes,
but for a price. If offices are going to
ban smoking altogether, as has hap
pened in many places recently, they
must make resources available that
help people quit smoking. This, of
course, assumes the Bill of Rights has
been conveniently forgotten, in
making these kinds of across-the-board
regulations in places of work.
Now, it's not like smokers aren't
rude; if someone exhales smoke in
your face, you have every reason to
want to assault them physically. But it
seems that the present slant of society
allows one to lash out verbally at some
one 15 feet away at the mere sight of a
lit match. Don't believe that? Try to
light a cigarette in a non-smoking sec
tion of an airplane; I've seen the
results, and they're not pretty. It takes
about five to 10 seconds for
obscenities to be shouted. Maybe that's
an extreme case, but it shows the ex
treme problem with many non
smokers: We're capable of being

positively rabid!
The ultimate concern is how society
can condone such wanton hatred
against one group. We pat ourselves on
the back because racial groups aren't
systematically attacked (much), but we
simultaneously condone mass hatred
against a section of the population that
Chooses to burn out its innards. That's
their choice; the rest of the world has
no right to pass judgment on their self
destructiveness. The attempt is made
to show that smoking is an offense
against society, but with ozone
annihilating automobiles and smoke
stacks the size of some towers, it's a
petty offense.
So is it possible to have rules that are
fair for all involved? Perhaps. Stan
ford's regulation on smoking is rather
fair, although it allows one person in a
crowd of 20 to (supposedly) keep the
other 19 from lighting up. Still, it con
siders the opinions and needs of both
sides of the fence, as opposed to the
supercilious "thou shalt not smoke"
ordinances adopted in some areas. If
life is fair, maybe we'll see more of the
equitable regulations of Stanford's va
riety. Then we won't have asinine
scenes with local police confronting
five men and arresting them for
"illegal smoking."

mind's eye. Can you imagine anything
