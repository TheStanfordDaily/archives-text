# Stanford, H-P and South Africa
## 
### 
Stanford's investments in Hewlett-Packard are a
major pan of the millions of dollars it has invested in
companies that operate in South Africa. Stanford Out
of South Africa, a student group, is writing this view
point in order to reveal the links between Stanford
and Hewlett-Packard, to examine Hewlett-Packard's
activities in South Africa and to speculate as to why
Stanford does not endorse total divestment from
companies that do business in South Africa.

Stanford's H-P stock hits a market value of more
than $25 million, by far Stanford's largest single in
vestment in any company doing business in South
Africa. William Hewlett and David Packard recently
pledged $120 million in stock as personal gifts to
Stanford. John Young, president of H P. is on the
Stanford Board of Trustees. The Stanford Research
Park, a block of Stanford land that is rented to many
high tech companies, was pioneered by H P's rental
of land, and H P currently leases one of the largest
sections of land in the park. Hewlett-Packard is one
of the companies the Stanford administration con
tinually lauds for its business practices in South
Africa. This close relationship between Stanford and
Hewlett Packard, which takes many forms, makes it
highly unlikely that Stanford will divest from H-P
Hewlett-Packard s history in South Africa is not im
pressive H-P does $-44 million of business per year in
South Africa. This business takes the form of com
puters and test equipment sales to many sectors of
the South African government, a fact dcumented by
H-P itself in its informational booklet entitled
Hewlett-Packard in South Africa. H-P also pays sub
stantial amounts of money in taxes to the South
African government, monev that can then be used by

the government to buy arms. The exact amount paid
in taxes to the South African government is known
only to the Pretoria regime and Hewlett-Packard,
which refuses to release this information to the
public. An example of HP's sales is its participation
in the new calibration system developed by
ARMSCOR (a corporation that develops armaments
for the South African government), which aids in im
proving high calibration of military equipment.
H-P claims to be improving the plight of blacks in
South Africa by staying there, though only 12 out of
261 of its employees are black. The information
booklet that H-P publishes states: "A growing,
dynamic economy brings more blacks into the main
stream of business and industry, a movement that
serves as an impetus for political as well as economic
change." But H-P has been there since 1968, since
which time the South African economy has seen peri
ods of remarkable growth, and conditions have only
gotten worse for black South Africans. The above
facts contradict H P's claim of laudable behavior.
A recent policy statement by an H-P spokesperson
announced that "our plans are to remain there [in
South Africa] indefinitely." This statement was made
in response to IBM and General Motors pulling out
of South Africa. IBM and GM are two corporations
that were consistently lauded as having some of the
best, most moral business practices in South Africa,
and both companies cited the degeneration of the sit
uation in South Africa as one of their reasons for pull
ing out. H-P is taking a moral stance by planning to
remain in South Africa indefinitely, a stance that
represents an implicit acceptance of apartheid and
apartheid's benefits to H P's profits. David Packard
himself said, Some states back home say they intend
to boycott U.S. companies which trade with South
Africa. Well, that doesn't worry us at all; we're going
to continue to trade. I d much rather lose business
with Nebraska than with South Africa" (Rand Dailv

Mail, April 16, 1980). How long does "indefinitely"
mean? How much repression will H-P condone
before it feels that morality comes before its profits?
Because of the close relationship between Stan
ford and Hewlett-Packard, it comes as no surprise
that Stanford also puts profits before people and
seeks high returns and large contributions in spite of
the human cost. Stanford students have been calling
for divestment almost continually since 1977. In
these nine years, Stanford has divested less than $5
million of $187 million in holdings, and only then
after significant student protest.
The trustees have justified their inaction in finan
cial terms. At a forum on divestment in the spring of
1985, trustee James Gaither made the devastatingly
honest admission that the Board of Trustees consid
ers its "principal" responsibility to be to "preserve
and protect and seek the best return from the assets
that we have." He noted that this responsibility, "not
the merits of the cause we are addressing today,"
may cause the trustees to oppose divestment. Stan
ford Treasurer Rodney Adams also lamented that
"any company we choose to publicly chastise would
not be too interested in giving money."
Stanford's quest for high returns and large contri
butions should not cause us to continue investing in
companies that operate in South Africa, and should
not override concern for human rights and human
dignity. The fight must continue for moral invest
ment policies from Stanford. Pressure most continue
to be applied to Stanford to divest and to H-P to disin
vest from South Africa. This is so because Stanford
and H-P will only act to divest and disinvest as a result
of continued protest. In continuing that pressure, stu
dents conducted a protest of H-P on Nov. 19, and we
won't stop until total divestment is achieved

Schmitz on behalf of Stanford Out of South Africa

companies that operate in South Africa, and should
not override concern for human rights and human
dignity. The fight must continue for moral invest
ment policies from Stanford. Pressure most continue
to be applied to Stanford to divest and to H-P to disin
vest from South Africa. This is so because Stanford
and H-P will only act to divest and disinvest as a result
of continued protest. In continuing that pressure, stu
dents conducted a protest of H-P on Nov. 19, and we
won't stop until total divestment is achieved

Stanford's investments in Hewlett-Packard are a
major pan of the millions of dollars it has invested in
companies that operate in South Africa. Stanford Out
of South Africa, a student group, is writing this view
point in order to reveal the links between Stanford
and Hewlett-Packard, to examine Hewlett-Packard's
activities in South Africa and to speculate as to why
Stanford does not endorse total divestment from
companies that do business in South Africa.

Stanford's H-P stock hits a market value of more
than $25 million, by far Stanford's largest single in
vestment in any company doing business in South
Africa. William Hewlett and David Packard recently
pledged $120 million in stock as personal gifts to
Stanford. John Young, president of H P. is on the
Stanford Board of Trustees. The Stanford Research
Park, a block of Stanford land that is rented to many
high tech companies, was pioneered by H P's rental
of land, and H P currently leases one of the largest
sections of land in the park. Hewlett-Packard is one
of the companies the Stanford administration con
tinually lauds for its business practices in South
Africa. This close relationship between Stanford and
Hewlett Packard, which takes many forms, makes it
highly unlikely that Stanford will divest from H-P
Hewlett-Packard s history in South Africa is not im
pressive H-P does $-44 million of business per year in
South Africa. This business takes the form of com
puters and test equipment sales to many sectors of
the South African government, a fact dcumented by
H-P itself in its informational booklet entitled
Hewlett-Packard in South Africa. H-P also pays sub
stantial amounts of money in taxes to the South
African government, monev that can then be used by

the government to buy arms. The exact amount paid
in taxes to the South African government is known
only to the Pretoria regime and Hewlett-Packard,
which refuses to release this information to the
public. An example of HP's sales is its participation
in the new calibration system developed by
ARMSCOR (a corporation that develops armaments
for the South African government), which aids in im
proving high calibration of military equipment.
H-P claims to be improving the plight of blacks in
South Africa by staying there, though only 12 out of
261 of its employees are black. The information
booklet that H-P publishes states: "A growing,
dynamic economy brings more blacks into the main
stream of business and industry, a movement that
serves as an impetus for political as well as economic
change." But H-P has been there since 1968, since
which time the South African economy has seen peri
ods of remarkable growth, and conditions have only
gotten worse for black South Africans. The above
facts contradict H P's claim of laudable behavior.
A recent policy statement by an H-P spokesperson
announced that "our plans are to remain there [in
South Africa] indefinitely." This statement was made
in response to IBM and General Motors pulling out
of South Africa. IBM and GM are two corporations
that were consistently lauded as having some of the
best, most moral business practices in South Africa,
and both companies cited the degeneration of the sit
uation in South Africa as one of their reasons for pull
ing out. H-P is taking a moral stance by planning to
remain in South Africa indefinitely, a stance that
represents an implicit acceptance of apartheid and
apartheid's benefits to H P's profits. David Packard
himself said, Some states back home say they intend
to boycott U.S. companies which trade with South
Africa. Well, that doesn't worry us at all; we're going
to continue to trade. I d much rather lose business
with Nebraska than with South Africa" (Rand Dailv

Mail, April 16, 1980). How long does "indefinitely"
mean? How much repression will H-P condone
before it feels that morality comes before its profits?
Because of the close relationship between Stan
ford and Hewlett-Packard, it comes as no surprise
that Stanford also puts profits before people and
seeks high returns and large contributions in spite of
the human cost. Stanford students have been calling
for divestment almost continually since 1977. In
these nine years, Stanford has divested less than $5
million of $187 million in holdings, and only then
after significant student protest.
The trustees have justified their inaction in finan
cial terms. At a forum on divestment in the spring of
1985, trustee James Gaither made the devastatingly
honest admission that the Board of Trustees consid
ers its "principal" responsibility to be to "preserve
and protect and seek the best return from the assets
that we have." He noted that this responsibility, "not
the merits of the cause we are addressing today,"
may cause the trustees to oppose divestment. Stan
ford Treasurer Rodney Adams also lamented that
"any company we choose to publicly chastise would
not be too interested in giving money."
