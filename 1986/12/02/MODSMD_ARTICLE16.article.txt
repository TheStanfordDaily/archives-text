# Lab animals treated well
## 
### 
A recent editorial attacked current practices in the care,
use and protection of laboratory animals (Daily, Nov. 24).
This editorial, however, contained factual errors, distortions
of the truth and questionable logic. The issue of use of
animals in research understandably provokes strong
responses on all sides, and for that reason it is critical to
have at hand accurate information when confronting the im
portant questions involved in this debate. In what follows,
we propose to correct misleading information in The Daily
editorial and cast (apparently) much needed light on certain
aspects of laboratory animal care, use and protection at
Stanford.

HAMM & MENDELOW

Fact: There are more laws, regulations, and guidelines
protecting the welfare of laboratory animals than that of pets
and wild animals. The Daily incorrectly states the opposite.
Fact: Between 17 and 22 million laboratory animals are
used annually in the United States, according to a recently
released congressional study that examined all available
data on numbers (U.S. Congress Office of Technology
Assessment, 1986). The figure cited in the recent editorial
— 70 to 80 million animals — is not supported by any data.
Fact: All, not just "many," research institutions that receive
federal funding must appoint committees to review the care
and use of laboratory animals. The Daily seems to imply that
this arrangement represents a conflict of interest; it is,
however, a legal requirement and an effective mechanism
to protect the welfare of lab animals.
Fact: Stanford's president appoints a 12-member panel
each year for the sole purpose of ensuring humane care and
treatment of laboratory animals. All proposals involving use
of lab animals at Stanford must be approved by this panel,
of which less than half the members themselves are in
volved in animal research. Three of the members are from
outside the University, including a former Palo Alto city

councilor and two veterinarians affiliated with local pet
hospitals, one of whom is past president of a humane soci
ety. Other members include a Stanford student and the
Stanford Hospital chaplain.
Thus, The Daily's observation that a voice is missing from
among those who care about animal welfare is not only
wrong, it denigrates the reality of the Animal Care Panel's
mission and the sincere dedication of its members to animal
welfare.
Fact: In contrast to The Daily's assertion, the National In
stitutes of Health (NIH) is quite effective in monitoring
animal research, whether at Columbia University, the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, Stanford or other institutions. It was
this federal agency that inspected the first two schools' pro
grams, discovered deficiencies and suspended their re
search funding. For your information, NIH also conducted
an unannounced site visit at Stanford this year and found the
University's program in full compliance with existing stand
ards and regulations.
Fact: The NIH has never suspended Stanford's federal re
search funds for inadequacies in the care or use of labora
tory' animals, nor {i&s Stanford University ever lost any other
research funding due to sponsor concerns about the Uni
versity's care or treatment of lab animals. The Daily's infor
mation is simply wrong.
A vast majority of the U.S. public — 77 percent, according
to a recent public opinion survey — supports biomedical
research using animals (Foundation for Biomedical Re
search, 1986).
As we commented earlier in this response, readers con
cerned with this important issue deserve accurate
reportage. An occasional factual error in an editorial is
regrettable, but perhaps understandable; however, jour
nalists have a particularly important obligation to report fac
tually issues that are in public debate.

laboratory Animal Medicine. David Mendelow is an associ
