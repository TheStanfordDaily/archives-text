Volunteers have
always aided SH
Let's set the record straight. A
recent article on Jeanne Kennedy
states, "She developed the hospital's
volunteer program'' (Daily, Nov. 6).
Since the Stanford Hospital opened
in 1959, the Stanford University Medi
cal Center Auxiliary, founded in 1929,
has provided 1,812,453 volunteer
hours. This was accomplished with no
paid staff. This same organization,
through its gift shop and baby photo
sales, has donated $1,263,322 to the
Stanford University Hospital for equip
ment to improve patient care, includ
ing $70,000 to establish the lifeline
program. Again, this was contributed
with no paid staff.
Our organization is grateful to the

many Stanford students who have
worked within the auxiliary as volun
teers, as "Stanford Aides" in pediatrics
and other services for the past 27
years. The auxiliary has always valued
the contributions Stanford students
make by giving of their time and
talent to the patients at the hospital.
Because Stanford students have
participated in our volunteer work
since 1959, we feel it is important to
establish the facts. We would welcome
any present students to continue the
"volunteer" tradition by contacting the
Auxiliary Office at the Medical Center.

She likes puzzles
Please, please, please don't drop the
Daily crossword! Crossword puzzles
are my Reason For Living. I get
through the morning on the
Chronicle's, the afternoon on The
Daily's, and the evening on the New
York Times' â€” except for some days
when I save up three for a big hit late
at night. Fellow crossword addicts
who have lived through years of
multiple newspaper subscriptions
know the terror that hit me when I
read that my primary source of happi
ness might be eliminated. At the risk
of being redundant and saying every
thing again, please, please keep the
crossword!
