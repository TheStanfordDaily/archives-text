## Lougee guides, nurtures undergraduate education Dean's list of roles in University is long 
### KATHY SYLVESTER 
She leans back calmly, her navy blue
cardigan draped smoothly over her
shoulders.
"I like being in a position where I
can see I can make a difference," she
says."I have a desire to improve
things, to enhance things in ways in
which 1 have the capability."
As dean of Undergraduate Studies at
Stanford, Carolyn Lougee seems to
have found a niche that allows her to
accomplish exactly that. Overseer of
undergraduate education in all corners
of the University, Lougee does much
more than just make speeches at fresh
man orientation and other student
events. An ex-officio member of the
University Policy Committee, she also
supervises various campus advising
programs such as the Center for Teach
ing and Learning (CTL), Innovative
Academic Courses (lAC), Overseas
Studies and Undergraduate Research
Opportunities.
In addition, Lougee serves as associ
ate dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the largest school on
campus. In this capacity, she is in
charge of particular divisions within
Humanities and Sciences and has
"regular deaning duties," which in
clude setting salaries, hiring new fac
ulty, promoting existing faculty and
making tenure decisions.
"It is very important that an under
graduate dean be a real dean," she
says, emphasizing that by playing both
parts the dean can more effectively
channel ideas, funding and attention to
undergraduate education. Holding
true to this belief, Lougee also serves
as undergraduate dean in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, participating
in curriculum decision-making and
serving as an intermediary in inter
departmental problems.
In addition to these administrative
responsibilities, Lougee extends her
talents into academic and residential
areas of Stanford, teaching halftime in
the history track of Western Culture
and serving as an adviser in Ujamaa.
As if this weren't enough, Lougee is
also married and has two daughters,

one a senior at Smith College and the
other a sophomore at UC-Berkeley.
Always wanted to be a teacher
Why and how does Carolyn Lougee
find time and ability to pursue all these
activities? "Stamina," says Lougee. A
history of incorporating many projects
at once, says her past.
Born in the Detroit suburb of Bir
mingham, Mich., to an auto executive
father and a "very traditional
housewife" mother, Lougee decided at
a young age that she wanted to go into
education.
"I always wanted to be a teacher."
she says."I guess I admired my own
teachers," she adds, also attributing
part of her decision to the post-war,

1950s sex role expectations. "My only
other alternative was to be a nurse, but
I knew I couldn't give people shots,"
she laughs.
By the time she entered the Univer
sity of Michigan at Ann Arbor, however,
Lougee had decided to become a
chemist. "I loved math and lab sci
ence," she explains, adding that career
expectations for women at the time
were still quite limited.
Serendipitously, along with her
math and science classes she was re
quired to take a class that would
eventually shape the rest of her career
plans: freshman European history.
"I just loved it," Lougee exclaims.
This sudden enthusiasm for history
also awoke in her a desire to break
away from the "traditional Midwestern

set of assumptions" that included a de
emphasis of a careerist ethic in
women.
Knowing Smith College in Massa
chusetts had an "exceptional" history
department, she transferred there in
her sophomore year and went on to
graduate with a degree in history.
Shied away from a doctorate
Two weeks after graduation, she
married David Lougee, an English
major whom she had met in college.
Together they attended graduate
school at the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor, with Carolyn studying
European history and David pursuing
English.
"I didn't want to turn into an intel
lectual, so I shied away from a Ph.D.,"
says Lougee. "But the more I stayed
with history, the more I discovered it
changed in front of my eyes. The re
search drew me into getting my Ph.D."
Another change occurred in
Lougee's life during graduate school:
Her two daughters were born. "It was
really tough raising a family and going
to graduate school," Lougee admits.
"Nobody did it."
She remembers her mother telling
her she would never have time to read
a book or have any free time to herself.
"But I wouldn't have wanted one with
out the other," Lougee emphasizes.
After a time in Florida — where her
husband got his first teaching job as an
English professor — and then a period
of commuting between Michigan and
Florida after she was hired at the Uni
versity of Michigan, Lougee received a
job at Stanford, and the whole family
moved to California.
A great experiment
After just five years of teaching, she
received tenure at Stanford, and the
next year she became chairman of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
"Whisked into policy," she next
became dean of Undergraduate
Studies, her current position.
The first woman to carry that title,
Lougee was also, in 1973, the first

woman to be hired as a professor in
the History Department. "It took a stu
dent protest to get the department to
hire a woman," says Lougee, adding
that college faculties at the time were
just beginning to open up to women
professors.
"It was very controversial," says
Lougee. "I had no idea what I was step
ping into. I was a great experiment, a
test case to see if I could do the job,
stack up and then hold up with my col
leagues."
What was it like for Lougee as a
woman in a male-dominated institu
tion?
"Once they had made the decision
to hire me, the department seemed
completely supportive of my having a
crack at succeeding, to show what I
could do," she says. She added that her
senior colleagues helped to show her
what to expect and ways to focus her
energy, as well as things not to waste
her energy pursuing.

'It's a neat thing to
know I can make
a difference in a
big way.'

"Stanford is good that way," Lougee
continues. "It is fair to the people it
brings in." She adds that Stanford has
been "very successful" with women
faculty members because it "looks at
work objectively" and has good men
toring rapport between senior faculty
and the younger professors.
Can being a woman in that environ
ment, then, actually help at Stanford?
"I have never understood how my
male colleagues can say it is easier to
be a woman and work at this job,"
Lougee answers. "The truth is, any
woman who is teaching here and has a
family has a tremendous burden, an
uphill struggle to achieve and gain
recognition. The expectations are high,

and it takes a 150 percent effort from
anybody to produce."
Lougee admits the University still
doesn't do all it could for women fac
ulty, citing its lack of sufficient child
care and maternity benefits as two ex
amples.
She also admits that it is not possible
to "equalize the burden" between
women and men. "But despite the un
relenting work," she says, "I've been
able to have the best of all worlds."
Linking students with faculty
Lougee's world of deaning has been
particularly active lately because of
functions and fund-raising activities
connected with the University's Cen
tennial Celebration. She is working to
divert resources to undergraduate
education, a task she admits can be dif
ficult.
"It's a battle," she says. "There are so
many unparalleled developments on
the research side that the natural flow
and tension is directed toward
graduate education." She adds that
Stanford has "self-consciously"
decided to become a research univer
sity, a decision that presents risks for
the school's undergraduates.
Lougee's plan for the coming cen
tury, or at least the first pan of it, is ba
sically two-fold: to involve more un
dergraduates in the research arena of
the campus, ".nd to strengthen under
graduate education through network
ing groups that join students and fac
ulty.
"The knitting together of the re
search orientation of the University
and talented undergraduates is a top
priority of our Centennial funds," she
explains.
Through honors programs, Golden
and Firestone awards and increased
one-on-one interaction between stu
dents and faculty, Undergraduate
Studies plans to develop Stanford's
"first-rate" undergraduate program to
be part of the research institution, ac
cording to Lougee.

"I always wanted to be a teacher," says Carolyn Lougee, dean of Undergrad
uate Studies and associate professor of history. "I guess I admired my own
teachers." Lougee says she may vacate her administrative positions
sometime next year to return to full-time teaching and research.
Lougee's interest in linking students
with faculty as well as with other stu
dents was sparked when she discov
ered that women students drop out
from science and engineering majors
at rates disproportionate to those for
men.
In an effort to combat this problem,
Lougee founded the Women's Network
in Science and Engineering, a mentor
group that encourages women science
and engineering students through
closer contact with faculty. These
groups have expanded, and Lougee is
concentrating on making them a larger
part of academic life at Stanford.
"It is important to help different
categories of students overcome dis
abilities or limitations, whether that is
being a woman, being of a particular
race or ethnicity or being on financial
aid," she says.
In light of her commitment to un
dergraduates, how does Lougee view
the purported "anti-intellectualism"
among students, as well as the Univer
sity's role in causing or combating it?
"I think Stanford as an institution

probably does not have enough safe'
places for intellectual exchange,"
answers Lougee, adding that she feels
the environment in the residences dis
courages intellectual discussion and
sharing of individual ideas.
"I'm the last person to think all dis
cussion in residences should be
serious," she hastens to explain. "But
people should be able to do it if they
want."
Despite the lack of intellectual ex
change, Lougee says she has noticed a
"revived sense of commitment to
public service," reflected in an up
surge in interest in education as a
career goal for Stanford students.
"It's a rekindled interest that seems
to have come spontaneously," she says.
"It's one of the nicest things to hear a
student say they would like to be a
teacher. We really need good people
in education."
Driven
Besides her own commitment to
education, what ultimately motivates
Carolyn Lougee to continue with all
her responsibilities? "I think I am
driven because Stanford is a place
where there are so many resources;
there is no limit on what you can make

happen," Lougee responds. "I can see I'
can make a difference I can imple
ment a solution to a problem. It's a
neat thing to know I can make a differ
ence in a big way."
Although Lougee's six-year appoint
ment as dean is over the year after
next, she may stop next year if she
completes her "agenda" of goals as
dean. Her new pursuits will then in
clude finishing her book on the educa
tion of girls in 15th-century France, as
well as returning to teaching history on
a more regular basis.
"When I stop being dean I think I
will be driven by my research," she
says, confessing that she looks forward
to being able to think about history in
stead of administration when she takes
a shower, does the dishes or fixes din
ner.
"It's been good to be in administra
tion," she says, "but it'll be good to go
back to history."
Are there any possibilities that she
would not return to Stanford? "It
would be very hard to leave Stan
ford It really is a caring, humane
kind of community," Lougee says."It is
exciting being here in the beginning
stages of Stanford becoming the finest
university in the country. It is a meteor
in the business."

She also admits that it is not possible

Linking students with faculty
Lougee's world of deaning has been
particularly active lately because of
functions and fund-raising activities
connected with the University's Cen
tennial Celebration. She is working to
divert resources to undergraduate
education, a task she admits can be dif
ficult.
"It's a battle," she says. "There are so
many unparalleled developments on
the research side that the natural flow
and tension is directed toward
graduate education." She adds that
Stanford has "self-consciously"
decided to become a research univer
sity, a decision that presents risks for
the school's undergraduates.
Lougee's plan for the coming cen
tury, or at least the first pan of it, is ba
sically two-fold: to involve more un
dergraduates in the research arena of
the campus, ".nd to strengthen under
graduate education through network
ing groups that join students and fac
ulty.
"The knitting together of the re
search orientation of the University
and talented undergraduates is a top
priority of our Centennial funds," she
explains.
Through honors programs, Golden
and Firestone awards and increased
one-on-one interaction between stu
dents and faculty, Undergraduate
Studies plans to develop Stanford's
"first-rate" undergraduate program to
be part of the research institution, ac
cording to Lougee.

"I always wanted to be a teacher," says Carolyn Lougee, dean of Undergrad
uate Studies and associate professor of history. "I guess I admired my own
teachers." Lougee says she may vacate her administrative positions
sometime next year to return to full-time teaching and research.
Lougee's interest in linking students
with faculty as well as with other stu
dents was sparked when she discov
ered that women students drop out
from science and engineering majors
at rates disproportionate to those for
men.
In an effort to combat this problem,
Lougee founded the Women's Network
in Science and Engineering, a mentor
group that encourages women science
and engineering students through
closer contact with faculty. These
groups have expanded, and Lougee is
concentrating on making them a larger
part of academic life at Stanford.
"It is important to help different
categories of students overcome dis
abilities or limitations, whether that is
being a woman, being of a particular
race or ethnicity or being on financial
aid," she says.
In light of her commitment to un
dergraduates, how does Lougee view
the purported "anti-intellectualism"
among students, as well as the Univer
sity's role in causing or combating it?
"I think Stanford as an institution

probably does not have enough safe'
places for intellectual exchange,"
answers Lougee, adding that she feels
the environment in the residences dis
courages intellectual discussion and
sharing of individual ideas.
"I'm the last person to think all dis
cussion in residences should be
serious," she hastens to explain. "But
people should be able to do it if they
want."
Despite the lack of intellectual ex
change, Lougee says she has noticed a
"revived sense of commitment to
public service," reflected in an up
surge in interest in education as a
career goal for Stanford students.
"It's a rekindled interest that seems
to have come spontaneously," she says.
"It's one of the nicest things to hear a
student say they would like to be a
teacher. We really need good people
in education."
Driven
Besides her own commitment to
education, what ultimately motivates
Carolyn Lougee to continue with all
her responsibilities? "I think I am
driven because Stanford is a place
where there are so many resources;
there is no limit on what you can make

happen," Lougee responds. "I can see I'
can make a difference I can imple
ment a solution to a problem. It's a
neat thing to know I can make a differ
ence in a big way."
Although Lougee's six-year appoint
ment as dean is over the year after
next, she may stop next year if she
completes her "agenda" of goals as
dean. Her new pursuits will then in
clude finishing her book on the educa
tion of girls in 15th-century France, as
well as returning to teaching history on
a more regular basis.
"When I stop being dean I think I
will be driven by my research," she
says, confessing that she looks forward
to being able to think about history in
stead of administration when she takes
a shower, does the dishes or fixes din
ner.
"It's been good to be in administra
tion," she says, "but it'll be good to go
back to history."
Are there any possibilities that she
would not return to Stanford? "It
would be very hard to leave Stan
ford It really is a caring, humane
kind of community," Lougee says."It is

stages of Stanford becoming the finest
university in the country. It is a meteor

As dean of Undergraduate Studies at
Stanford, Carolyn Lougee seems to
have found a niche that allows her to
accomplish exactly that. Overseer of
undergraduate education in all corners
of the University, Lougee does much
more than just make speeches at fresh
man orientation and other student
events. An ex-officio member of the
University Policy Committee, she also
supervises various campus advising
programs such as the Center for Teach
ing and Learning (CTL), Innovative
Academic Courses (lAC), Overseas
Studies and Undergraduate Research
Opportunities.
In addition, Lougee serves as associ
ate dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the largest school on
campus. In this capacity, she is in
charge of particular divisions within
Humanities and Sciences and has
"regular deaning duties," which in
clude setting salaries, hiring new fac

making tenure decisions.
"It is very important that an under

serving as an intermediary in inter
departmental problems.
In addition to these administrative
responsibilities, Lougee extends her
talents into academic and residential
areas of Stanford, teaching halftime in
the history track of Western Culture
and serving as an adviser in Ujamaa.
As if this weren't enough, Lougee is
also married and has two daughters,

one a senior at Smith College and the
other a sophomore at UC-Berkeley.
Always wanted to be a teacher
Why and how does Carolyn Lougee
find time and ability to pursue all these
activities? "Stamina," says Lougee. A
history of incorporating many projects
at once, says her past.
Born in the Detroit suburb of Bir
mingham, Mich., to an auto executive
father and a "very traditional
housewife" mother, Lougee decided at
a young age that she wanted to go into
education.
"I always wanted to be a teacher."
she says."I guess I admired my own
teachers," she adds, also attributing
part of her decision to the post-war,

1950s sex role expectations. "My only
other alternative was to be a nurse, but
I knew I couldn't give people shots,"
she laughs.
By the time she entered the Univer
sity of Michigan at Ann Arbor, however,
Lougee had decided to become a
chemist. "I loved math and lab sci
ence," she explains, adding that career
expectations for women at the time
were still quite limited.
Serendipitously, along with her
math and science classes she was re
quired to take a class that would
eventually shape the rest of her career
plans: freshman European history.
"I just loved it," Lougee exclaims.
This sudden enthusiasm for history
also awoke in her a desire to break
away from the "traditional Midwestern

set of assumptions" that included a de
emphasis of a careerist ethic in
women.
Knowing Smith College in Massa
chusetts had an "exceptional" history
department, she transferred there in
her sophomore year and went on to
graduate with a degree in history.
Shied away from a doctorate
Two weeks after graduation, she
married David Lougee, an English
major whom she had met in college.
Together they attended graduate
school at the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor, with Carolyn studying
European history and David pursuing
English.
"I didn't want to turn into an intel
lectual, so I shied away from a Ph.D.,"
says Lougee. "But the more I stayed
with history, the more I discovered it
changed in front of my eyes. The re
search drew me into getting my Ph.D."
Another change occurred in
Lougee's life during graduate school:
Her two daughters were born. "It was
really tough raising a family and going
to graduate school," Lougee admits.
"Nobody did it."
She remembers her mother telling
her she would never have time to read
a book or have any free time to herself.
"But I wouldn't have wanted one with
out the other," Lougee emphasizes.
After a time in Florida — where her
husband got his first teaching job as an
English professor — and then a period
of commuting between Michigan and
Florida after she was hired at the Uni
versity of Michigan, Lougee received a
job at Stanford, and the whole family
moved to California.
A great experiment
After just five years of teaching, she
received tenure at Stanford, and the
next year she became chairman of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
"Whisked into policy," she next
became dean of Undergraduate
Studies, her current position.
The first woman to carry that title,
Lougee was also, in 1973, the first

woman to be hired as a professor in
the History Department. "It took a stu
dent protest to get the department to
hire a woman," says Lougee, adding
that college faculties at the time were
just beginning to open up to women
professors.
"It was very controversial," says
Lougee. "I had no idea what I was step
ping into. I was a great experiment, a
test case to see if I could do the job,
stack up and then hold up with my col
leagues."
What was it like for Lougee as a
woman in a male-dominated institu
tion?
"Once they had made the decision
to hire me, the department seemed
completely supportive of my having a
crack at succeeding, to show what I
could do," she says. She added that her
senior colleagues helped to show her
what to expect and ways to focus her
energy, as well as things not to waste
her energy pursuing.

'It's a neat thing to
know I can make
a difference in a
big way.'

"Stanford is good that way," Lougee
continues. "It is fair to the people it
brings in." She adds that Stanford has
been "very successful" with women
faculty members because it "looks at
work objectively" and has good men
toring rapport between senior faculty
and the younger professors.
Can being a woman in that environ
ment, then, actually help at Stanford?
"I have never understood how my
male colleagues can say it is easier to
be a woman and work at this job,"
Lougee answers. "The truth is, any
woman who is teaching here and has a
family has a tremendous burden, an
uphill struggle to achieve and gain
recognition. The expectations are high,

and it takes a 150 percent effort from
anybody to produce."
Lougee admits the University still
doesn't do all it could for women fac
ulty, citing its lack of sufficient child
care and maternity benefits as two ex
amples.
She also admits that it is not possible
to "equalize the burden" between
women and men. "But despite the un
relenting work," she says, "I've been
able to have the best of all worlds."
Linking students with faculty
Lougee's world of deaning has been
particularly active lately because of
functions and fund-raising activities
connected with the University's Cen
tennial Celebration. She is working to
divert resources to undergraduate
education, a task she admits can be dif
ficult.
"It's a battle," she says. "There are so
many unparalleled developments on
the research side that the natural flow
and tension is directed toward
graduate education." She adds that
Stanford has "self-consciously"
decided to become a research univer
sity, a decision that presents risks for

also married and has two daughters,

one a senior at Smith College and the
other a sophomore at UC-Berkeley.
Always wanted to be a teacher
Why and how does Carolyn Lougee
find time and ability to pursue all these
activities? "Stamina," says Lougee. A
history of incorporating many projects
at once, says her past.
Born in the Detroit suburb of Bir
mingham, Mich., to an auto executive
father and a "very traditional
housewife" mother, Lougee decided at
a young age that she wanted to go into
education.
"I always wanted to be a teacher."
she says."I guess I admired my own
teachers," she adds, also attributing
part of her decision to the post-war,

1950s sex role expectations. "My only
other alternative was to be a nurse, but
I knew I couldn't give people shots,"
she laughs.
By the time she entered the Univer
sity of Michigan at Ann Arbor, however,
Lougee had decided to become a
chemist. "I loved math and lab sci
ence," she explains, adding that career
expectations for women at the time
were still quite limited.
Serendipitously, along with her
math and science classes she was re
quired to take a class that would
eventually shape the rest of her career
plans: freshman European history.
"I just loved it," Lougee exclaims.
This sudden enthusiasm for history
also awoke in her a desire to break
away from the "traditional Midwestern

set of assumptions" that included a de
emphasis of a careerist ethic in
women.
Knowing Smith College in Massa
chusetts had an "exceptional" history
department, she transferred there in
her sophomore year and went on to
graduate with a degree in history.
Shied away from a doctorate
Two weeks after graduation, she
married David Lougee, an English
major whom she had met in college.
Together they attended graduate
school at the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor, with Carolyn studying
European history and David pursuing
English.
"I didn't want to turn into an intel
lectual, so I shied away from a Ph.D.,"
says Lougee. "But the more I stayed
with history, the more I discovered it
changed in front of my eyes. The re
search drew me into getting my Ph.D."
Another change occurred in
Lougee's life during graduate school:
Her two daughters were born. "It was
really tough raising a family and going
to graduate school," Lougee admits.
"Nobody did it."
She remembers her mother telling
her she would never have time to read
a book or have any free time to herself.
"But I wouldn't have wanted one with
out the other," Lougee emphasizes.
After a time in Florida — where her
husband got his first teaching job as an
English professor — and then a period
of commuting between Michigan and
Florida after she was hired at the Uni
versity of Michigan, Lougee received a
job at Stanford, and the whole family
moved to California.
A great experiment
After just five years of teaching, she
received tenure at Stanford, and the
next year she became chairman of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
"Whisked into policy," she next
became dean of Undergraduate
Studies, her current position.
The first woman to carry that title,
Lougee was also, in 1973, the first

woman to be hired as a professor in
the History Department. "It took a stu
dent protest to get the department to
hire a woman," says Lougee, adding
that college faculties at the time were
just beginning to open up to women
professors.
"It was very controversial," says
Lougee. "I had no idea what I was step
ping into. I was a great experiment, a
test case to see if I could do the job,
stack up and then hold up with my col
leagues."
What was it like for Lougee as a
woman in a male-dominated institu
tion?
"Once they had made the decision
to hire me, the department seemed
completely supportive of my having a
crack at succeeding, to show what I
could do," she says. She added that her
senior colleagues helped to show her
what to expect and ways to focus her
energy, as well as things not to waste
her energy pursuing.

'It's a neat thing to
know I can make
a difference in a
big way.'

"Stanford is good that way," Lougee
continues. "It is fair to the people it
brings in." She adds that Stanford has
been "very successful" with women
faculty members because it "looks at
work objectively" and has good men
toring rapport between senior faculty
and the younger professors.
Can being a woman in that environ
ment, then, actually help at Stanford?
"I have never understood how my
male colleagues can say it is easier to
be a woman and work at this job,"
Lougee answers. "The truth is, any
woman who is teaching here and has a
family has a tremendous burden, an
uphill struggle to achieve and gain
recognition. The expectations are high,

and it takes a 150 percent effort from
anybody to produce."
Lougee admits the University still
doesn't do all it could for women fac
ulty, citing its lack of sufficient child
care and maternity benefits as two ex
amples.
She also admits that it is not possible
to "equalize the burden" between
women and men. "But despite the un
relenting work," she says, "I've been
able to have the best of all worlds."
Linking students with faculty
Lougee's world of deaning has been
particularly active lately because of
functions and fund-raising activities
connected with the University's Cen
tennial Celebration. She is working to
divert resources to undergraduate
education, a task she admits can be dif
ficult.
"It's a battle," she says. "There are so
many unparalleled developments on
the research side that the natural flow
and tension is directed toward
graduate education." She adds that
Stanford has "self-consciously"
decided to become a research univer
sity, a decision that presents risks for
the school's undergraduates.
Lougee's plan for the coming cen
tury, or at least the first pan of it, is ba
sically two-fold: to involve more un
dergraduates in the research arena of
the campus, ".nd to strengthen under
graduate education through network
ing groups that join students and fac
ulty.
"The knitting together of the re
search orientation of the University
and talented undergraduates is a top
priority of our Centennial funds," she
explains.
Through honors programs, Golden
and Firestone awards and increased
one-on-one interaction between stu
dents and faculty, Undergraduate
Studies plans to develop Stanford's
"first-rate" undergraduate program to
be part of the research institution, ac
cording to Lougee.

"I always wanted to be a teacher," says Carolyn Lougee, dean of Undergrad
uate Studies and associate professor of history. "I guess I admired my own
teachers." Lougee says she may vacate her administrative positions
sometime next year to return to full-time teaching and research.
Lougee's interest in linking students
with faculty as well as with other stu
dents was sparked when she discov
ered that women students drop out
from science and engineering majors
at rates disproportionate to those for
men.
In an effort to combat this problem,
Lougee founded the Women's Network
in Science and Engineering, a mentor
group that encourages women science
and engineering students through
closer contact with faculty. These
groups have expanded, and Lougee is
concentrating on making them a larger
part of academic life at Stanford.
"It is important to help different
categories of students overcome dis
abilities or limitations, whether that is
being a woman, being of a particular
race or ethnicity or being on financial
aid," she says.
In light of her commitment to un
dergraduates, how does Lougee view
the purported "anti-intellectualism"
among students, as well as the Univer
sity's role in causing or combating it?
"I think Stanford as an institution

probably does not have enough safe'
places for intellectual exchange,"
answers Lougee, adding that she feels
the environment in the residences dis
courages intellectual discussion and
sharing of individual ideas.
"I'm the last person to think all dis
cussion in residences should be
serious," she hastens to explain. "But
people should be able to do it if they
want."
Despite the lack of intellectual ex
change, Lougee says she has noticed a
"revived sense of commitment to
public service," reflected in an up
surge in interest in education as a
career goal for Stanford students.
"It's a rekindled interest that seems
to have come spontaneously," she says.
"It's one of the nicest things to hear a
student say they would like to be a
teacher. We really need good people
in education."
Driven
Besides her own commitment to
education, what ultimately motivates
Carolyn Lougee to continue with all
her responsibilities? "I think I am
driven because Stanford is a place
where there are so many resources;
there is no limit on what you can make

happen," Lougee responds. "I can see I'
can make a difference I can imple
ment a solution to a problem. It's a
neat thing to know I can make a differ
ence in a big way."
Although Lougee's six-year appoint
ment as dean is over the year after
next, she may stop next year if she
completes her "agenda" of goals as
dean. Her new pursuits will then in
clude finishing her book on the educa
tion of girls in 15th-century France, as
well as returning to teaching history on
a more regular basis.
"When I stop being dean I think I
will be driven by my research," she
says, confessing that she looks forward
to being able to think about history in
stead of administration when she takes
a shower, does the dishes or fixes din
ner.
"It's been good to be in administra
tion," she says, "but it'll be good to go
back to history."
Are there any possibilities that she
would not return to Stanford? "It
would be very hard to leave Stan
ford It really is a caring, humane
kind of community," Lougee says."It is
exciting being here in the beginning
stages of Stanford becoming the finest
university in the country. It is a meteor
in the business."

Carolyn Lougee wears many hats in serving the University as an administrator and teacher. "I like being in a posi
tion where I can see I can make a difference," she says.
She leans back calmly, her navy blue
cardigan draped smoothly over her
shoulders.
"I like being in a position where I
can see I can make a difference," she
says."I have a desire to improve
things, to enhance things in ways in
which 1 have the capability."
As dean of Undergraduate Studies at
Stanford, Carolyn Lougee seems to
have found a niche that allows her to
accomplish exactly that. Overseer of
undergraduate education in all corners
of the University, Lougee does much
more than just make speeches at fresh
man orientation and other student
events. An ex-officio member of the
University Policy Committee, she also
supervises various campus advising
programs such as the Center for Teach
ing and Learning (CTL), Innovative
Academic Courses (lAC), Overseas
Studies and Undergraduate Research
Opportunities.
In addition, Lougee serves as associ
ate dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the largest school on
campus. In this capacity, she is in
charge of particular divisions within
Humanities and Sciences and has
"regular deaning duties," which in
clude setting salaries, hiring new fac
ulty, promoting existing faculty and
making tenure decisions.
"It is very important that an under
graduate dean be a real dean," she
says, emphasizing that by playing both
parts the dean can more effectively
channel ideas, funding and attention to
undergraduate education. Holding
true to this belief, Lougee also serves
as undergraduate dean in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, participating
in curriculum decision-making and
serving as an intermediary in inter
departmental problems.
In addition to these administrative
responsibilities, Lougee extends her
talents into academic and residential
areas of Stanford, teaching halftime in
the history track of Western Culture
and serving as an adviser in Ujamaa.
As if this weren't enough, Lougee is
also married and has two daughters,

one a senior at Smith College and the

I knew I couldn't give people shots,"
she laughs.
By the time she entered the Univer

Lougee had decided to become a
chemist. "I loved math and lab sci

expectations for women at the time

Lougee's interest in linking students
with faculty as well as with other stu
dents was sparked when she discov
ered that women students drop out
from science and engineering majors
at rates disproportionate to those for
men.
In an effort to combat this problem,
Lougee founded the Women's Network
in Science and Engineering, a mentor
group that encourages women science
and engineering students through
closer contact with faculty. These
groups have expanded, and Lougee is
concentrating on making them a larger
part of academic life at Stanford.
"It is important to help different
categories of students overcome dis
abilities or limitations, whether that is
being a woman, being of a particular
race or ethnicity or being on financial
aid," she says.
In light of her commitment to un
dergraduates, how does Lougee view
the purported "anti-intellectualism"
among students, as well as the Univer
sity's role in causing or combating it?
"I think Stanford as an institution

probably does not have enough safe'
places for intellectual exchange,"
answers Lougee, adding that she feels
the environment in the residences dis
courages intellectual discussion and
sharing of individual ideas.
"I'm the last person to think all dis
cussion in residences should be
serious," she hastens to explain. "But
people should be able to do it if they
want."
Despite the lack of intellectual ex
change, Lougee says she has noticed a
"revived sense of commitment to
public service," reflected in an up
surge in interest in education as a
career goal for Stanford students.
"It's a rekindled interest that seems
to have come spontaneously," she says.
"It's one of the nicest things to hear a
student say they would like to be a
teacher. We really need good people
in education."
Driven
Besides her own commitment to
education, what ultimately motivates
Carolyn Lougee to continue with all
her responsibilities? "I think I am
driven because Stanford is a place
where there are so many resources;
there is no limit on what you can make

happen," Lougee responds. "I can see I'
can make a difference I can imple
ment a solution to a problem. It's a
neat thing to know I can make a differ
ence in a big way."
Although Lougee's six-year appoint
ment as dean is over the year after
next, she may stop next year if she
completes her "agenda" of goals as
dean. Her new pursuits will then in
clude finishing her book on the educa
tion of girls in 15th-century France, as
well as returning to teaching history on
a more regular basis.
"When I stop being dean I think I
will be driven by my research," she
says, confessing that she looks forward
to being able to think about history in
stead of administration when she takes
a shower, does the dishes or fixes din
ner.
"It's been good to be in administra
tion," she says, "but it'll be good to go
back to history."
Are there any possibilities that she
would not return to Stanford? "It
would be very hard to leave Stan
ford It really is a caring, humane
kind of community," Lougee says."It is
exciting being here in the beginning
stages of Stanford becoming the finest
university in the country. It is a meteor
in the business."
