# Championship Stanford chess team never hoard
## 
### KEVIN WACKNOV 
Most people perceive chess as a
dull game, but that's probably be
cause they haven't played much," ex
plains sophomore Peter Thiel, mem
ber of the Stanford chess team,
which placed first in the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Chess Tournament
early last month.
"Actually," says Thiel, "the
numerous geometric and psycholog
ical motifs in chess make it more
than just an ordinary boardgame."
Stanford's chess team, consisting
of freshman Adam Lief (senior na
tional master), senior Eric Chapa
(national master) and junior Peter
Thiel (candidate master), went unde
feated in last month's tournament,
beating four successive colleges.
"We have a very strong team this
year, and hope to go on to the Na
tional Chess Championships," says
Thiel. Currently, the chess team is
raising money to attend that tourna
ment.
"Along with the chess team, we
are also getting the Stanford Chess
Club off the ground this year," Peter
adds. The club, which meets on

'Most people per
ceive chess as a
dull game '

Tuesday evenings, is open to players
of all skill levels.
To Thiel, the uniqueness and at
traction of chess are easily ex
plained.
"It has been estimated that there is
a greater number of possible chess
games than there are atoms in the
observable universe. As a result,
most games between two chess
players are unique, having never
before been played in the 2,500
years of chess," Thiel says.
"However, this alone does not ac
count for the popularity of chess,
since one must also consider the
psychological element in a game be
tween two humans."

As an example, Thiel cites 1978
Chess World Championship be
tween international titans Anatoly
Karpov and Victor Korchnoi. Be
cause Korchnoi feared that one of
Karpov's partners might try to hyp
notize him, he requested that the
first 12 rows of seats in the playing
hall be kept empty. On the day of the
decisive game, a parapsychologist
from the Karpov camp sat in the
front row, Korchnoi lost the game
and, with it, his bid for the world
championship.
Are members of the team afraid
that computers may replace them in
the future? "Although some of the
computer chess programs are very
impressive, they are still far from
perfect," says Thiel.
"Chess computers tend to go
through all of the possible moves
from a given position, which makes
it hard for them to look very far
ahead, since the possibilities grow
exponentially," he explains. "Human
players, on the other hand, focus on
specific goals in a given position.
And, until the computers become
goal-oriented as well, they will prob
ably continue to lose."
