## Card clashes with SJSU in basketball 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Coming off two encouraging games
in Richmond, Va., Stanford will be
looking to raise its record to 2-1 when
it travels to San Jose's Civic Auditorium
to meet San Jose State at 7:30 tonight.
The Cardinal began the 1986-87
season last weekend by splitting games
at the Central Fidelity Invitational at
Richmond. Stanford came within
inches of upsetting sixth-ranked Geor
gia Tech on Friday, as point guard
Terry Taylor's 25-foot attempt at a
game-winning three-pointer caught
the front rim. The Cardinal then went
out and pummeled Rice in the consola
tion game, 72-52.
Although Stanford was pleased with
its performance against Georgia Tech,
the general consensus was that the Yel
lowjackets' No. 6 ranking is somewhat
inflated.
"They're not as good as they're
rated," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said simply.
Taylor and shooting guard Novian
Whitsitt agreed with Montgomery, but
both members of the Stanford back
court believe Georgia Tech has the
ability to be among the nation's best.
"I think they have the talent to be
No. 6," Taylor said. "Right now, they're
just not playing together. Their
chemistry is not that good right now,
so they're probably not a top-10 team."
"As far as talent-wise, they are
definitely in the top 10," Whitsitt said.
"You have to remember that they lost
two great players (Mark Price and John
Salley, both now in the NBA). It takes a
while to readjust to that. They've got
some great athletes."
Georgia Tech's early-season vul
nerability was shown again the follow
ing night. The Yellowjackets were
beaten 67-62 in overtime by Rich
mond.
Still, the Cardinal was not about to

belittle its comeback from a 16-point
deficit in the final nine minutes or its
ability to go toe-to-toe inside with a
front line consisting of 7-foot Antoine
Ford and the last two Atlantic Coast
Conference Rookies-of-the-Year, for
wards Tom Hammonds and Duane
Ferrell.
"It (the comeback) demonstrated
we've got a competitive bunch of kids,"
Montgomery said. "They could have
quit, laid down, but didn't and got back
in it."
"We kind of surprised ourselves,"
Whitsitt said. "Eric Reveno is as strong
as anyone inside, and Howard Wright
isn't exactly a pushover. And Greg But
ler is no slouch, either. We held our
own. It was a real confidence-builder."
An all-tournament selection, Wright
led Stanford in both scoring with 27
points and rebounds with 22. "He
boarded well," Montgomery said. "He
hung in there with some pretty good
athletes."
San Jose State opened its season on
Saturday with a 54-49 loss at the Uni
versity of Portland. Guard Anthony
Perry came off the bench to lead the
Spartans with 14 points, followed by
junior forward Reggie Owens with 12.
Senior forward George Puou grabbed
13 rebounds, despite being only 6-5.
Last year, San Jose went 16-12 and
finished fourth in the Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association. The Spartans will
definitely be hurt by the absence of
Ricky Berry, son of San Jose State
Coach Bill Berry, who is probably out
until the first of the year with an injury.
Berry averaged 18.6 points and 4.9
rebounds last season.
Even with Berry on the bench with
his father, Montgomery is wary of the
Spartans. "San Jose State will be a big
ballgame for us," he said. "It's a
smaller facility, and it will be crowded.
They've got good athletes. It's a game
we should be pointing toward."

junior forward Reggie Owens with 12.
Senior forward George Puou grabbed
13 rebounds, despite being only 6-5.
Last year, San Jose went 16-12 and
finished fourth in the Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association. The Spartans will
definitely be hurt by the absence of
Ricky Berry, son of San Jose State
Coach Bill Berry, who is probably out
until the first of the year with an injury.
Berry averaged 18.6 points and 4.9
rebounds last season.
Even with Berry on the bench with
his father, Montgomery is wary of the
Spartans. "San Jose State will be a big
ballgame for us," he said. "It's a
smaller facility, and it will be crowded.
They've got good athletes. It's a game
we should be pointing toward."
