# Stanford in top 20 again
## 
### 
With its 29-24 victory over Arizona in the Coca-Cola
Bowl, Stanford moved back into The Associated Press
Top Twenty for the fifth time this season. The Card
inal is ranked No. 20 in the latest AP poll, released last
night.
Stanford is one of five Pacific 10 Conference teams
ranked in the Top Twenty — the others being Arizona
State (7), Washington (12), UCLA (15) and Arizona
(16). USC dropped out of the Top Twenty after losing
to Notre Dame Saturday.
Clemson, Stanford's opponent in the Gator Bowl
on Dec. 27, is ranked No. 21.
Miami and Penn State are set for college football's
version of the Super Bowl.
That was assured yesterday when the Hurricanes
and Nittany Lions finished 1-2 in the final regular
season poll.
Miami completed an 11-0 season last Thursday by
trouncing East Carolina 36-10 with quarterback Vinny
Testaverde watching from the sidelines after a motor
scooter mishap two nights earlier.
The Hurricanes received 53 of 58
first-place votes and 1,155 of a possible
1,160 points from a nationwide panel
of sports writers and sportscasters.
Miami has been No. 1 since defeating
Oklahoma 28 16 on Sept. 27.
Penn State, also 11-0, received the
other five first-place votes and 1,092
points. The Lions are No. 2 for the third
consecutive week.
The Miami-Penn State matchup in
the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 2 will be the
21st time the No. 1 and No. 2 teams
have met since the AP poll began in
1936.
