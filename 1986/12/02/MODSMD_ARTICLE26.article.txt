# Stanford in top 20 again
## 
### 
With its 29-24 victory over Arizona in the Coca-Cola
Bowl, Stanford moved back into The Associated Press
Top Twenty for the fifth time this season. The Card
inal is ranked No. 20 in the latest AP poll, released last
night.
Stanford is one of five Pacific 10 Conference teams
ranked in the Top Twenty â€” the others being Arizona
State (7), Washington (12), UCLA (15) and Arizona
(16). USC dropped out of the Top Twenty after losing
to Notre Dame Saturday.
Clemson, Stanford's opponent in the Gator Bowl
on Dec. 27, is ranked No. 21.
Miami and Penn State are set for college football's
version of the Super Bowl.
That was assured yesterday when the Hurricanes
and Nittany Lions finished 1-2 in the final regular
season poll.
Miami completed an 11-0 season last Thursday by
trouncing East Carolina 36-10 with quarterback Vinny
Testaverde watching from the sidelines after a motor
scooter mishap two nights earlier.
