LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Reggie Miller scored 21 of his 32
points in the second half as UCLA held on to upset top
ranked North Carolina 89-84 in college basketball last night.
The victory avenged the Bruins' worst loss ever, a 107-70
defeat suffered last year at Chapel Hill, N.C., at the hands of
the Tar Heels.
The Bruins, 2-0, led almost the entire way, opening a 13-
point lead in the first half.
With freshmen Greg Foster and Trevor Wilson playing
key roles in the second half, the Bruins kept North Carolina
from getting into position to tie the game in the final 10
minutes.
Foster scored six points in the second half, and Wilson
added six more in the final four minutes.
Kenny Smith led North Carolina, 2-1, with 18 points.
