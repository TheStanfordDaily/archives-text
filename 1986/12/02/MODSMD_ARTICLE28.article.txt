# Rags to riches for 1983 recruits

It doesn't get any sweeter.
After starting their Stanford men's water polo
careers in the Pacific 10 Conference basement with a
losing record in 1983 (11-13-3), members of the 1983
recruiting class rebounded with a second-place
NCAA finish in 1984 and culminated their Cardinal
years as part of a team that won back-to-back national
championships in 1985 and 1986 and went through a
perfect season in their senior year.
"It feels really good to look back at what we have
accomplished," senior David Imbernino said. "It is
kind of neat to see all of our hard work pay off."
Rather than entering a program that was immedi
ately sucessful as freshmen, this recruiting class was
forced to take its share of hard knocks in the begin
ning. Forced into duty right away, players such as
senior All-America Craig Klass were getting pushed
around in 1983- The team had to start from the
ground up.

But since that first year, this same group of players
improved dramatically and is now proclaimed to be
one of Stanford's finest recruiting classes ever.
"It makes it a lot more special," Imbernino said.
"We were nothing when we got here, and through
dedication, hard work and great coaching we won
the national championships two years in a row."
Comprised of seniors Imbernino, Klass, Greg
Gamble, Greg Ocasek, Chris Thompson and redshjrt
seniors Grant Stanley and Bob Abbot, this group of
seven combined as a well-oiled unit to help form a
team this year that is considered one of the best in
NCAA history.
"This group of players is definitely the quickest
and fastest group I have ever had," Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "They should be proud of
what they have accomplished. As people, they are a
fantastic group of young men. They are my favorite
group of people I have had in my 20 years of coach
ing."
This year's team, spearheaded by this group of
seven, has rewritten several Stanford and national

record books. In addition to their athletic achieve
ments, each player provided a unique personal
quality to the team, which brought it closer together
as a unit.
"They group) have two great attributes: their
great athletic talent and their personal qualities,"
Dettamanti said. "The group had a great sense of har
mony and togetherness. It is just not going to be the
same out there in the pool without those guys."
Klass, along with junior Erich Fischer, set a new
Cardinal season scoring record with 87 goals. In ad
dition, Stanford currently sports the NCAA's longest
consecutive win streak at 45 games and finished the
season with the best record in NCAA history (36-0).
Klass and Imbernino were selected first-team All-
America in 1985 and seem destined to be picked for
the honor again this year. Both shared the NCAA
Tournament Most Valuable Player award with UCLA's
Fernando Carsalade. Gamble was chosen as third
team All-America last season and will in all likelihood
