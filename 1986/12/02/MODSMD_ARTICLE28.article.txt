# Rags to riches for 1983 recruits
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
It doesn't get any sweeter.
After starting their Stanford men's water polo
careers in the Pacific 10 Conference basement with a
losing record in 1983 (11-13-3), members of the 1983
recruiting class rebounded with a second-place
NCAA finish in 1984 and culminated their Cardinal
years as part of a team that won back-to-back national
championships in 1985 and 1986 and went through a
perfect season in their senior year.
"It feels really good to look back at what we have
accomplished," senior David Imbernino said. "It is
kind of neat to see all of our hard work pay off."
Rather than entering a program that was immedi
ately sucessful as freshmen, this recruiting class was
forced to take its share of hard knocks in the begin
ning. Forced into duty right away, players such as
senior All-America Craig Klass were getting pushed
around in 1983- The team had to start from the
ground up.

But since that first year, this same group of players
improved dramatically and is now proclaimed to be
one of Stanford's finest recruiting classes ever.
"It makes it a lot more special," Imbernino said.
"We were nothing when we got here, and through
dedication, hard work and great coaching we won
the national championships two years in a row."
Comprised of seniors Imbernino, Klass, Greg
Gamble, Greg Ocasek, Chris Thompson and redshjrt
seniors Grant Stanley and Bob Abbot, this group of
seven combined as a well-oiled unit to help form a
team this year that is considered one of the best in
NCAA history.
"This group of players is definitely the quickest
and fastest group I have ever had," Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "They should be proud of
what they have accomplished. As people, they are a
fantastic group of young men. They are my favorite
group of people I have had in my 20 years of coach
ing."
This year's team, spearheaded by this group of
seven, has rewritten several Stanford and national

record books. In addition to their athletic achieve
ments, each player provided a unique personal
quality to the team, which brought it closer together
as a unit.
"They group) have two great attributes: their
great athletic talent and their personal qualities,"
Dettamanti said. "The group had a great sense of har
mony and togetherness. It is just not going to be the
same out there in the pool without those guys."
Klass, along with junior Erich Fischer, set a new
Cardinal season scoring record with 87 goals. In ad
dition, Stanford currently sports the NCAA's longest
consecutive win streak at 45 games and finished the
season with the best record in NCAA history (36-0).
Klass and Imbernino were selected first-team All-
America in 1985 and seem destined to be picked for
the honor again this year. Both shared the NCAA
Tournament Most Valuable Player award with UCLA's
Fernando Carsalade. Gamble was chosen as third
team All-America last season and will in all likelihood
be an All-American pick again this year.
"Just being able to play with these
guys is what makes winning really spe
cial because of the friendships that
were made," Imbernino said.
Although some individuals have
received more recognition than
others, each player was an integral
piece in the national championship
puzzle.
"I have been fortunate to play with
players who can get me the ball," Klass
said after the NCAA title game on Sun
day. "I would not get the opportunity
to score goals without the help of my
teammates."
"Every guy on the team adds a
unique quality to the team," Detta
manti said. "It is kind of like a recipe
— you take a little of this and a little of
that and you blend it all together per
fectly. That is what this group has
done."
Dettamanti's recipe begins with U.S.
National Team alternates Imbernino
and Klass.
Imbernino, a 6-foot-3, 180-pound
driver from Newport Beach, who is
widely regarded as the best collegiate
water polo player in the country, has

been chosen as an All-America in each
of his four seasons on the Farm.
"There are so many things you can
say about Dave," Dettamanti said. "He
leads by his actions. He is one of the
best athletes 1 have ever coached."
Klass, an imposing 6-5, 195-pound
hole man from Walnut Creek, em
bodies the classic overpowering hole
man in the Cardinal offense.
"He really made himself into a great
player," Dettamanti said. "He is an ex
tremely dedicated worker. Guys have
so much respect for him — he inspires
the guys by his hard work. Last night
(Sunday) he completely turned the
game around (scoring four goals in the
championship final against California).
It is the kind of thing he has done for
four years."
While Imbernino and Klass are na
tionally renowned figures, Gamble and
Thompson are not household names.
But both Gamble and Thompson are
just as essential to Stanford's success,
adding particularly a defensive inten
sity to this year's Cardinal.
"Gamble is a team leader," Detta
manti said. "He has been the guy in the
group that has kept us loose. His
teammates really look up to him."
"Chris has probably been the
steadiest player on our team," Detta
manti added. "You really don't notice
what he does, but he never makes

mistakes. He just goes out and does his
job."
Like Gamble and Thompson, Ocasek
has not grabbed a lot of headlines this
year. But, if a player on this year's team
was named Mr. Hustle, Ocasek would
be the man. Ocasek is thought of as the
sparkplug of the team.
"He has developed more than any of
the players," Dettamanti said. "Both as
a person and an athlete. If someone
were named most improved in this
group, he would be it. He doesn't get
the honors the other guys get. I hope
he gets All-America this year."
The two final pieces to the champi
onship puzzle recruited by Dettamanti
in 1983 are Stanley and Abbot. Both
performers redshirted last year and
will return next season for the Card
inal.
It is rare indeed when such a group
of players comes together. It is rarer
still when the same group is able to be
part of two national championships
and one perfect season.
"A lot of people have complimented
me on their behalf," Dettamanti said.
"They say that these guys are really
great people. I think they have made
valuable contributions to Stanford
while they have been here. They have
represented Stanford well. I consider
all those guys as great friends."

Chris Thompson, one of seven Stanford water polo players from the recruiting class of 1983, is not the flashiest of the
group, but according to Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti, "Chris has probably been the steadiest player on our
team."
