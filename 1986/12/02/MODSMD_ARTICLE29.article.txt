# Card 5th at regatta
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
For four Stanford sailors and their
coach, Thanksgiving break was any
thing but a vacation. The Cardinal
squad spent the last three days of No
vember on cold Lake Michigan, where
they scored a fifth place finish in the
Timme Angston Regatta.
The regatta, which is one of the fall
season's most competitive, attracted 10
of the top 20 teams in the nation.
As a result of Stanford's strong
showing at this latest event, the team
has moved up to eighth in the nation in
the most recent Sailing World maga
zine ranking.
Though the Cardinal started slowly,
reaching only 12th place after the first
day's racing, the team improved its po
sition throughout the regatta. By the
end of the third day, the Stanford
sailors were only a few points behind
fourth-place Wisconsin. Tulane led the
fleet, followed by Navy in second and
Rhode Island in third.
"Tulane and Navy were in a class of
their own, but we were equal to or bet
ter than the other teams. It was a very
competitive regatta, and I was satisfied
with our finishes," Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton said.
Junior Drew Gashler and sopho

more Lori Dobeus scored an eighth
place finish for the Cardinal in the
regatta's A division, while juniors Doug
Hagen and Gina Ottobani sailed to
seventh place in the B division.
"Both our teams sailed well, and
they were equally successful. Both
pairs had really good races, along with
some bad ones, and all four sailors
deserve credit for the good overall
score," Middleton said.
Both pairs spent time in the protest
room after the races, but of the four
protests in which the Stanford sailors
were involved, they only lost one in
one hearing.
Conditions varied during the regatta,
which Middleton described as
"mellow as Timme Angstons go, with
moderate winds on the first day, a dead
calm on the second and a howling
breeze on the third.
This year, for the first time, the
Timme Angston regatta was sailed in
Dyer Flyer class sailboats. None of the
Cardinal sailors were familiar with the
new type of boat, so it took some time
for the skippers to learn the boats' par
ticular behaviors.
"The boats were certainly better
than the ones they used in the past, but
they weren't perfect. They took some
getting used to," said Middleton.
