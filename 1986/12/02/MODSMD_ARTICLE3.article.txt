# Groups urge approval of course
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
A coalition of student groups drafted a letter last
night urging the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) to endorse an alternative spring quar
ter class in the Western Culture Program.
The coalition was responding to a rumor that
"members of (CUS) are ... reluctant to recommend
approval of this course to the Faculty Senate," ac
cording to the letter. No CUS member could be
reached last night to confirm or deny the rumor.
The course, designed during the summer by His
tory Prof. Clay Carson, would focus on the experi
ences of minorities and women in the United States.
The class was proposed as a temporary solution to
criticism that the Western Culture Program ignores
the historical contibutions of those groups.
The purpose of the letter is to "remind them
(committee members) that there is widespread senti
ment for change," said Steve Phillips of the Black Stu

dent Union (BSU), one of the groups in the coalition.
The coalition, which included representatives
from all the minority communities as well as Stan
ford Out of South Africa and the ASSU Senate, plans
to attend the CUS meeting tomorrow and to petition
the freshman class. A group of faculty, led by Emeritis
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake, has also drafted a
letter in support of the course.
The ASSU Senate will vote tonight on a resolution
supporting the proposed class, according to ASSU
senator Stacey Leyton.
According to Phillips, CUS is reversing its endorse
ment of the class last spring now that there is less
pressure from students.
Amanda Kemp, chair of the BSU, also questioned
the value of student course evaluations of the 1984-
1985 Western Culture classes, in which 80 percent of
those surveyed called the program "a positive exper
ience."
"(The survey) does not indicate the numbers of
people who think (the Western Culture Program)

could be greatly improved by including the experi
ences of people of color or of women," she said.
Kemp added that the coalition still hopes to
replace the current program with a world culture
program in order "to prepare people for life in a
gloal society."
"This (spring quarter) class is still just a band-aid
to what we see as a chronic problem We would
like to see the program overhauled," she said.
According to a press release received early yester
day, the Academic Council supports the incorpora
tion of women and minorities into the current West
ern Culture Program rather than adopting a "world
culture" requirement in its place.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz said the culture of
Western Europe should remain the focus of the
course.
But he agreed that the contributions of women
and minorites should receive "more attention in all
the tracks."
