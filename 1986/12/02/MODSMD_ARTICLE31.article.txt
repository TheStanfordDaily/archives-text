# Giants rally to defeat 49ers
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Phil Simms threw two touch
down passes and set up New York's third TD with a 49-yard
completion to Stacy Robinson during an amazing third
period turnaround last night that gave the Giants a 21-17 vic
tory over the San Francisco 49ers and clinched a spot in the
NFL playoffs.
Simms totaled 388 yards passing, including 202 in the 21-
point third quarter, as New York stretched its winning streak
to six games, the NFL team's longest in 16 years, by coming
back from a 17-0 halftime deficit. Simms was intercepted
twice in the first half, when the Giants' rushing game netted
only two yards and kicker Raul Allegre missed two field goal
attempts.
The 49ers had a chance to pull out a victory in the final
minutes of the game, but were stopped on downs at the
Giants' 20-yard line.
By improving to 11-2, the Giants remained tied with

Washington for the NFC Eastern Division lead. They will
meet the Redskins next Sunday in a first-place showdown.
The 49ers, second in the NFC West, dropped to 7-5-1 and
one-and-a-half games behind the division-leading Los An
geles Rams.
Simms passed 17 yards to running back Joe Morris and 34
yards to wide receiver Robinson for the touchdowns that
completed drives of 49 and 71 yards. Ottis Anderson
plunged one yard for the go-ahead TD immediately after the
49-yard play to Robinson, who pulled the ball to his chest as
he landed on the ground near the goal line.
The 49ers, who failed to get a first down in the third quar
ter, built their 17-0 lead on Ray Wersching's 30-yard field
goal in the first period and a pair of TDs by receiver Jerry
Rice in the second quarter.
Rice caught a 11-yard TD pass from Joe Montana and ran
one yard to score on an end-around play.
