Victims of cancer and several other
diseases will now be treated at Stan
ford University Hospital with the
country 's newest medical linear ac
celerator, according to Therapeutic
Radiology Prof. Malcolm Bagshaw.
The Clinac 1800, a state-of-the-art ac
celerator, is being used to treat
autoimmune diseases as well as to sup
press bone marrow function and
thereby assist in preventing rejection
of organ transplants, said Bagshaw,
chairman of the Therapeutic Radiology
Department.
The new accelerator is pan of a $2.1
million project to add to Stanford's ra
diation therapy services.
I'he accelerator is more versatile
than its predecessor and is able to tar
get cancerous cells at a specific tissue
depth while minimizing radiation
damage to the patient, Bagshaw said.
Medical linear accelerators kill can
cer cells by hitting them with X-rays or
electrons, which ionize atoms and
destroy important cellular macro
molecules such as DNA. This
molecular destruction causes cell
death, according to Radiology Prof.
Peter Fessenden.
Stanford's new accelerator has both
six- and 15-million volt X-ray beams as
well as six different energy levels of
electron beams. The previous model
used only X-rays to kill cells.

X-ray treatment is inferior to treat
ment with electron beams, according
to Bagshaw. "X-ray beams are very
penetrating. They shoot right through
the body so there is no way to control
the depth of penetration," he said.
Using electron beams allows one to
target cells of a specific depth. Elec
trons penetrate only as deep as their
energy level. By selecting the electron
energy, the depth of penetration can
be controlled. Thus, low electron
energies are particularly good for
treating skin cancers, especially
mycosis fungoids. Stanford is a major
referral center for people who have
that condition.
Stanford's new accelerator also min
imizes radiation damage by shooting
electron beams from different direc
tions toward the target tissue. By using
this approach, accelerators "distribute
the damage in normal tissues while
concentrating it in the tumor," accord
ing to Fessenden.
The linear accelerator can also be
used to treat autoimmune diseases by
irradiating a specific lymph node and
killing the lymphocytes made there.
Autoimmune diseases occur when the
body's immune system attacks its own
healthy cells.
By treating the disease with the
linear accelerator, "you don't need a
heavy dose of pharmacological agents
that would hurt the patient more," Bag
shaw said.

The development of the linear ac
celerator is dependent on two inven
tions â€” a tuned cavity in an accelerator
pipe that propels electrons and a mi
crowave tube call a klystron, Bagshaw
said.
The microwave tube is the basis
upon which World War II radar was
dependent. The linear accelerator "is
essentially a peaceful application of a
wartime device," Bagshaw said.
The Clinac 1800, fourth in a line of
linear accelerators at Stanford, was
made by Varian Associates of Palo Alto.
The first linear accelerator was hand
made in 1955 at the Hansen Lab, a high
energy physics lab at Stanford. The ac
celerator was put into operation at the
old Stanford Hospital in San Francisco
and is now in the Smithsonian Institu
tion in Washington, D.C., according to
Bagshaw.
The first commercial linear ac
celerator was developed by Varian As
sociates in 1960.
Linear accelerators are also used in
nuclear physics research to create nu
clear reactions. The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator (SLAC) is a very high energy
linear accelerator. Its electrons have a
kinetic energy of 22 billion electron
volts, more than 1,000 times greater
than those of the medical linear ac
celerator, which has electron energies
from six million to 20 million electron
volts.
