# Football, show entertaining for Japanese
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
TOKYO — It wasn't really a bowl
game, but the folks here who organ
ized what they called the Coca-Cola
Bowl weren't going to let that stand in
their way, as they put on a show for
55,000 fans Sunday — most of them
Japanese who weren't extremely
familar with football.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway's team
plays its home games in front of fans
whose knowledge exceeds their en
thusiasm, and he was happy to experi
ence the opposite.
"I heard that Japanese fans are very
positive and clap for everything —
even incomplete passes. If they do that,
I might stay in Japan for the rest of my
career," he said before the Cardinal
downed Arizona 29-24 to cap off an 8-3
regular season.
Elway wasn't completely right, but
the crowd paid 16,000 yen ($100) per
ticket and came for the festivity. But the
fans soon got caught up in what ended
up being a very exciting — and at
times bizarre — football game.
The game was played in Tokyo
Olympic Stadium, an 80,000-seat
structure built for the track and field
events of the 1964 Olympic Games.
The infield is only 115 yards long,
though, which meant one-fourth of the
end zones were on the rubberized
track surface instead of grass.
At least the field was natural turf. The
Cardinal practiced Friday and Saturday
at a baseball stadium on an artificial
surface with all the cushion of a pool
table. Yard lines were taped onto the
outfield.
That might have been an idea for the
Olympic Stadium field. The lines were
chalked in extremely lightly, making it
difficult for fans or the ESPN television
audience stateside to tell where the
ball was.
The game was the thing, but it
seemed at first the fans came for the
bands. Both the Stanford and Arizona
bands, both schools' dance groups, the
Arizona baton twirlers and the Wheat
Street Baptist Church Choir from At
lanta (the headquarters of the game's
sponsor) combined for lengthy
pregame, halftime and postgame
shows that at times seemed the main
attraction. Both bands played through
out the game, often at the same time,
but the players didn't complain about
excessive noise.
"It really wasn't a distraction," cor
nerback Toi Cook said. Maybe only

when we came off the field for defen
sive meetings."
The fans learned to cheer on cue
when placards in Japanese were held
up reading "Let's wave our pompons."
Sure enough, they waved their pom
pons, regardless of what was transpir
ing on the field. The one exception
came when an Arizona cheerleader
held up the sign — upside-down.
The fans picked up the idea of the
game as it progressed, and came to
their feet when Kevin Scott broke his
88-yard kickoff return that gave Stan
ford a 22-17 lead it never relinquished.
There's something obvious about a guy
running real fast past everyone to the
goal line.
At the end, the Stanford players
saluted the fans on their side of the
stadium as the Band played "All Right
Now." Then the Cardinal walked
around the track, slapping hands with
the fans, signing autographs and giving
away expendable wristbands and the
like. Scott was enjoying it so much, he
told a reporter who asked for an inter
view that he'd have to wait his turn.
"I was really impressed with the
fans," Cook said. "I think they sup
ported us a little more than Arizona. I
don't know if it's because we were win
ning or what. On the whole, I'm glad it
turned out the way it did."
"It was a grand affair, a grand event,"
Elway said. "I'm glad personally I got
to experience the pageantry. The
hospitality's been great. I've never
visited Tokyo, visited Japan, and it's
beyond my expectations."
Even linebacker David Wyman, a
man who doesn't like anything to inter
fere with the game at hand, began to
appreciate the uniqueness of the event.
"Initially, I didn't want to come here,"
he said. "I thought the distractions
would take away from the intensity of
the football game. I've been pleasantly
surprised."
One Cardinal player got the chance
to experience part of the ceremony of
the event. When University President
Donald Kennedy and Athletic Director
Andy Geiger were invited to a recep
tion by U.S. Ambassador Mike
Mansfield, they brought along fullback
Brian Morris, who like Mansfield is a
native of Butte, Mont.
The Cardinal had yesterday and will
have part of today to see the sights
before returning today. Elway said
several tours were organized, adding,
"I don't think they'll be in bed early
tonight."
