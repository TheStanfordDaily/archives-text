# Congress urged to look at USCRC

### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Congress needs to conduct a "long
range and more serious examination'
of the future of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission, according to John Bun
zel, a senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
Bunzel, a member of the commis
sion since December 1983, told Presi
dent Reagan in letter made public this
weekend to withdraw his name from
consideration for a second three-year
term on the commission.
In his letter to Reagan, Bunzel called
the commission a "little Beirut on the
Potomac," refering to the turmoil sur
rounding the commission and its con
troversial chairman, Clarence
Pendleton Jr. Bunzel called for
Pendleton's resignation last spring,
stating at the time that Pendleton's
"inflammatory rhetoric" was hindering
the commission's effectiveness.
Bunzel told The Daily yesterday that
the commission's goals and purpose
must be evaluated and redefined if the
body is to be effective in the future.
The commission, which was formed In
1957 to make recommendations about
civil rights to Congress, could be ter
minated in 1989 it its statutory author
ity is not renewed.
The commission's budget was cut by

40 percent in October, a move that
prompted the resignation of staff direc
tor J. Al Latham last month.
"The Congress really doesn't know
what to do with the commission," said
Bunzel, suggesting that the body ac
complished much of its original goals
and now must tackle other problems.
"I think that the work that led to
equality of rights ... has largely been
done, but not completed," said Bunzel,
noting that there are other serious cul
tural problems that must be dealt with
today.
Attention must be given to the plight
of the black underclass in the United
States, Bunzel said, adding that the
problems of this group go beyond rac
ism.
"The black underclass would not
disappear if racism were eliminated to
morrow," he said, pointing out that an
examination of "the cycle of inferior
education" facing underclass blacks
and the p<x>r should be made.
"I understand fully that the heritage
of discrimination is very important, but
what I'm trying to say is that in terms of
the life career of young blacks today,
it's clearly not the key determinant in
their future," he said.
Bunzel said that the United States
needs "more solid research that will
confront the real causes of failure" of
underclass blacks. Laws against racist

policies are not sufficient to end the
problems facing certain minority
groups, he said.
"We just can't pass laws today that
are going to deal with the problems of
the black underclass," Bunzel said.
Bunzel, a former president of San
Jose State University, said he will
remain busy despite his resignation
from the commission.
Bunzel said he plans to continue his
research on admissions to U.S. univer
sities and his study of civil rights, but
added that his golf game will occupy
some of the time once spent on the
commission.
"The first thing I'm going to do is
work on my golf swing," Bunzel said.
