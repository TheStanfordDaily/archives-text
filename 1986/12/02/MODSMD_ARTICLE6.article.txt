# USW defends SLAC worker
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers union said yesterday it will
appeal to arbitration because the University has not
reinstated a union member accused of stealing even though
the San Mateo District Attorney's Office recently dropped all
criminal charges against him.
Larry Reid, the union member who was discharged from
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in January,
should also be reinstated because the California Unemploy
ment Board upheld his unemployment benefits, citing a
lack of competent evidence for his dismissal, according to
Bill Di Vita, USW field representative.
SLAC needs to review the terminations of both Reid and
James Reese, another former SLAC employee, on the basis
of the new decisions. Di Vita said. Although charges against
Reese were dropped, the District Attorney's office is inves
tigating other possible illegalities.
"SLAC relied on information from an outside agency to
terminate these workers," Di Vita said. The situation has
changed since the termination notices were issued, he
added.
An arbitration hearing for Reid has been scheduled for
next March while a hearing date for Reese has not yet been
finalized. Di Vita is asking SLAC to reinstate the workers im
mediately rather than wait until the arbitration hearings.
According to Bernard Lighthouse, deputy director of per
sonnel at SLAC, the center will not immediately reinstate the
fired workers, despite the fact that the charges were
dropped and the adminstrative-law judge ruled against the
University.
"We will follow those procedures outlined in the col
lective bargaining agreement" and go to arbitration,
Lighthouse said. "An arbitration is a review mechanism by
which the union and the University have agreed to settle
their differences."
Mike Vartain. staff counsel for the University, said the new
developments have no direct connection to the propriety

of the dischargeâ€” The only proceeding which will deter
mine the propriety of the discharge is the arbitration
hearing."
While Vartain said the University had not yet received in
formation about the dismissal of charges from the District
Attorney's office, there are a "whole host of reasons" why
the charges were dropped. The congestion of the court sys
tem and the amount of money involved could have have
been contributing factors, he said.
The dismissal of charges, by itself, bears "no direct reflec
tion on whether the person committed the crime," Vartain
said. The University "terminates people for employee mis
conduct, not criminal violations," he added.
Di Vita said the University hasn't "proved anything yet".
Both Reid and Reese were fired by SLAC as a result of in
formation and testimony given by James Walker, a confiden
tial informant for the San Mateo Narcotics Task Force, Di
Vita said. Walker was sentenced to a year in prison after
pleading "no contest" to stealing 112,000 worth of com
puter equipment from SLAC, he said.
Di Vita, refering to Walker's own record, said people
should question the reliability of Walker's testimony.
Union attorney Jim Eggleston said in a USW news release:
"The Union doesn't condone theft but condemns police
state tactics to entrap employees and manufacture claims of
theft and misconduct in order to justify discipline or dis
charge."
According to Vartain, the California Unemployment
Board's decision upholding unemployment benefits for
Reese and Reid is still up for appeal. The judge was not will
ing to accept the official police investigation report because
the officers involved were not present, he said.
The judge also refused to let the University question Reid
about his involvement, Vartain said.
Di Vita said that the judge took all the information into ac
count. During the hearing, Vartain submitted numerous
unrelated documents from Reid's personnel file, which
eventually prompted the judge to call the documents
"ludicrous," Di Vita said
