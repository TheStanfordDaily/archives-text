Senate begins Iran affair probe
WASHINGTON — The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence began a
closed-door probe into the Reagan administration's clandestine Iranian
and Nicaraguan operations yesterday, taking sworn testimony from former
National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane and Lt. Col. Oliver North, who
was fired from the National Security Council staff for his involvement in the
operations.
McFarlane, who helped arrange an arms deal for Iran that subsequently
diverted an estimated 110 million to $30 million in funds to aid the
Nicaraguan antigovernment rebels, or contras, testified for nearly six
hours. When he emerged from the session around nightfall, he looked
flushed and grim and refused to talk with reporters.
McFarlane's appearance before the committee was requested over the
weekend, and he worked into the early hours Sunday preparing for his tes
timony with his attorney, Leonard Garment, former White House counsel
in the Nixon administration.
A source familiar with his testimony said McFarlane was asked
repeatedly about who else in the administration he told about the diver
sion of money to aid the contras after learning of it from North last May.
McFarlane reportedly responded that he did not tell others because he
assumed they already knew.
McFarlane said last week that he assumed the operation was administra
tion policy.
North, who was in his Marine uniform and flanked by several other men,
then entered the hearing room. He was expected to testify well into the
evening. Attorney General Edwin Meese said last week that North "knew
precisely" about the operation.
Vice Adm. John Poindexter, who Meese said knew about the diversion of
money to aid the contras but did not stop it and who resigned as Reagan's
national security adviser last week, is expected to testify today.
Operating under an extraordinarily tight, self-imposed gag rule, commit
tee members refused to disclose their agenda, witness list or details of tes
timony.
But Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.) said McFarlane testified under oath
about the secret sale of arms to Iran and subsequent diversion of funds to
aid the contras.
"Yeah, I'm sure it was McFarlane. It wasn't Santa Claus," Eagleton told
reporters as he left the session on the second floor of the Senate's Han of
fice building.

Aquino faces difficult tasks
WASHINGTON — Despite recent achievements, Philippines President
Corazon Aquino still faces a difficult task in reforming her nation's govern
ment and economy, Pentagon and State Department officials warned yes
terday.
Although they praised Aquino's firing of several Cabinet members, sign
ing of a cease-fire with communist insurgents and negotiation of new inter
national loans, the U.S. officials told a congressional panel that hard-core
opponents would continue to trouble her government and that private in
vestment by foreigners has lagged.
The two officials — Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of state, and Karl
Jackson, deputy assistant secretary of defense — made their comments in
testimony before the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee for Asian and
Pacific affairs as part of an effort by Chairman Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.) to
assess the outlook for what Aquino has vowed will be a "fresh start" in her
government.
The officials, both involved in East Asia policy, reiterated U.S. commit
ment to the Aquino government while castigating Communist opponents
and criticizing the policies of Ferdinand Marcos, Aquino's predecessor,
who was ousted in February.
Aquino has initiated policies aimed at "restoring market forces and
private enterprise to their proper role as the engines of economic growth,"
Sigur said, asserting that Aquino had "inherited" an economy that "was
characterized by excessive government intervention and monopolies in
key sectors."
She also inherited a 17-year insurgency that has left thousands of
Filipinos dead. On Thursday, Aquino's government and communist rebel
leaders signed a five-page document calling for a two-month truce, begin
ning Dec. 10.
Archives releases Nixon papers
WASHINGTON — Former President Richard Nixon was counseled by a
top aide in 1969 to avoid a visit to Mrs. Martin Luther King on the first an
niversary of her husband's assassination because "it would outrage many,
many people."
The aide, Patrick Buchanan, was a speechwriter in the Nixon White
House. He is the director of communications for President Reagan.
Buchanan's memo was among 1.5 million documents from the Nixon ad
ministration made public yesterday by the National Archives. It was the first
release of textual material from the more than 40 million documents Nixon
left behind when he resigned Aug. 9, 1974.
Missing from the newly released documents are the most sensitive of the
Nixon files — those relating to the Watergate scandal that drove him from
office. The National Archives once before tried to release those but was
stopped by 29 lawsuits filed by former Nixon associates.
The Archives, which has custody of the Nixon materials, is expected to
try again next month to open the papers to public scrutiny. The law re
quires th.it a notice of such release be published in the Federal Register
and that any persons who object have 60 days to do so.
The documents also revealed that Nixon astonished some aides by
meeting with Elvis Presley on Dec. 21. 1970. Presley had written to Nixon
saying he wanted to be named a federal drug agent.
Bilingual program proposed
SACRAMENTO — Saving he intends to lead the drive to implement the
English-only initiative approved by California voters last month, state Sen.
Art Torres yesterday proposed a new $5.5 million bilingual education pro
gram for adults.
Laying the foundation for what could be one of the state capitol's major
political battles of 198". Torres said now that supporters of the initiative
making English the official language of California have won the election, it
i> up to them to join opponents in making it work.
Torres (D-Los Angeles) said a key to that will be strengthening public
school programs that teach English to minority children and creating
programs for an estimated 4 million adults in California who either do not
speak English at all or are illiterate.
As introduced. Torres bill does not seek any additional state dollars, but
rather calls for redirecting unspecified existing adult education and
bilingual education funds which Torres said were being wasted.
