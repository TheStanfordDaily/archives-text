# Billionaire admits ransom plan

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot
said today that at the behest of a now-dismissed Na
tional Security Council aide he put up $2 million ear
lier this year to ransom U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
Perot, in an interview on ABC-TV's "Nightline,"
confirmed an account published in today's editions
of The Washington Post, which said the billionaire
put up the money at the request of Marine Lt. Col.
Oliver North, the NSC aide. North was fired Nov. 25
for what the administration said was his role in fun
neling Iranian weapons payments to Nicaraguan con
tra rebels.
On May 23, North asked Perot, listed by Forbes
magazine as the third wealthiest American, to deposit
$2 million in a Swiss bank account, said the newspa
per, quoting anonymous "informed sources."
Perot was on the point of telexing the money when
North called and asked him to send it by courier to
Cyprus for an exchange in "a ship-to-ship transfer,"
the Post said.
Perot's courier waited five days on Cyprus, but the
deal for the release of five Americans fell through for
reasons that could not be determined, the newspa
per said.
"It didn't work out and that was just an unfortunate
try that failed," Perot told ABC. "It's my understand

ing that the people that were supposed to produce,
didn't. It's that simple."
The newspaper said its information was provided
by "informed sources, including people with
firsthand knowledge of the transactions described."
Contacted last night, Daniel Howard, a White
House spokesman said the ransom attempt, if it oc
curred, was undertaken without the knowledge or
authorization of the National Security Council.
But Perot told ABC that he assumed North had
higher authority.
"My sense is always that people who do these types
of things in the government are very meticulous in
getting approval for their activities," Perot said.
"Maybe by the time I started dealing with Col. North
specifically, I had been pretty well programmed in
that direction because that's always been the case."
North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan Jr., did not im
mediately return telephone messages left at his
home last night.
The ransom attempt directly contradicted Presi
dent Reagan's stated policy of refusing to negotiate
for the release of hostages, but one source told the
Post the ransom attempt was justified on the grounds
that the money was from a private individual, not the
government.
Explained Perot: "As I understand the govern

ment's policy, it is they don't want to use U.S. money,
but if and when they can find a willing citizen to help
him in matters like this, then they can go to great ef
forts to save the person's life."
North worked with Perot on efforts to free the
Beirut hostages beginning soon after March 16, 1984,
when the Central Intelligence Agency's Beirut station
chief, William Buckley, was taken hostage. In the
words of one source with firsthand knowledge,
"North became preoccupied with getting ransom
and asked for $1 million to $2 million.... They had
to get Buckley back."
North requested that Perot provide the ransom for
Buckley, and Perot immediately agreed to make up
to $2 million available whenever it was needed. But
neither North nor the CIA was able to work out an
exchange with Buckley's captors, despite extraordi
nary efforts. After about 15 months in captivity
marked by torture and medical neglect, Buckley
died. The next month, McFarlane, while still the na
tional security adviser, began the Reagan administra
tion's secret opening to Iran.
North's role in soliciting Perot's private funds to
ransom American hostages seems to parallel North's
efforts to solicit private funds for the Nicaraguan
rebels, called contras.
