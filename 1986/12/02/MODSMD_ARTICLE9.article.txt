# CIA chief contradicts earlier testimony
## Casey approved arms shipments 
### 
LOS ANGELES — CIA Director
William Casey personally approved
agency support for a secret arms ship
ment to Iran in November 1985, con
trary to what he initially told congres
sional intelligence committees, the Los
Angeles Times reported today.
Casey apparently ordered CIA in
volvement in the U.S.-Israeli arms ship
ment, believing that he was acting in
accordance with White House wishes,
though he proceeded without written
approval, the newspaper said.
The intelligence chief ordered the
CIA to provide logistical suppon for
the shipment at the request of Lt. Col.
Oliver North, then a member of the
National Security Council staff, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified
government sources.
The CIA involvement occurred some
two months before President Reagan
signed the written intelligence
"finding," a formal order from the

president, normally required for such
covert activity, the newspaper said.
The November shipment caught the
attention of the House and Senate in
telligence committees because it
marked the first CIA involvement in
the Reagan administration's secret
arms operation, and because the
agency acted without the order from
Reagan.
Reagan did not learn of the arms
shipment until February 1986, some
three months after it had taken place,
Attorney General Edwin Meese 111 said
last week.
Casey initially told the congressional
intelligence panels the ClA's role in the
shipment had been approved by John
McMahon, then the agency's deputy
director for operations, committee
members said.
The CIA director told the panels
Nov. 21 that he was traveling in China
when the White House request came

and that McMahon approved it
"without (Casey's) knowledge," Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) later
recounted.
Some members said Casey's account
gave them the impression that he did
not even know of the shipment at the
time.
Casey later told the Senate commit
tee that he had "misspoken," two
knowledgeable officials said —
reportedly after McMahon contested
the Casey version.
McMahon "was furious.... He hit
the ceiling" after he learned that some
members of Congress believed that he
had approved the unusual shipment
on his own authority, one unidentified
source told the Times.
An official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the CIA relayed to
Casey the request for the arms ship
ment and that the director approved it.
Members of the intelligence com

mittees and several other sources said
the CIA helped ship the cargo, which
contained Hawk anti-aircraft missiles
and TOW anti-tank missiles.
It was not immediately dear
whether the ClA's role may have vio
lated the law.
Federal law bars the CIA from aiding
or conducting a covert operation
abroad unless the president issues a
finding that the operation is in the na
tional interest.
A senior administration official who
briefed reporters at the White House
last month said then that the United
States had sent no arms shipments to
Iran before Reagan signed the Jan. 17
finding because "that would have been
illegal, and I have said we didn't do
anything illegal."
He later admitted to "one excep
tion,' which he said was a shipment
sent to Iran "in our interests" by Israel.
