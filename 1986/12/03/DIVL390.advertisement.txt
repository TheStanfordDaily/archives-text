SCIENCE: AN INTERNATIONAL ENDEAVOR
From their early beginnings, the natural sciences have been intrinsically international in character.
The vcallcd laws of nature are almost by definition the same all over the globe. But the material
and human resources needed for the more general application of scientific knowledge to societal
progress and human welfare are not; furthermore, in most countries they seem to grow faster than
the GNP. Dr. Rosenblith will discuss how governments have increasingly come to view science and
technology as essential to internal growth and development, as ingredients of national strength, as
tools of competition among nations, and even instruments of foreign policy. Given the increases in
the globe's population, limitations in natural resources, and the consequences of certain technolo
gies, there is a greater need for effective international cooperation among scientists of many coun
tries and disciplines. Dr. Rosenblith will show how such cooperation depends for success on a
variety of national and multi-national institutions, and how obstacles that limit the mobility of
scientists or the free flow of scientific information impede the ability of this community to contribute
— in the words of Francis Bacon — "to the relief of man's estate."
