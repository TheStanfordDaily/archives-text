# Adm. Poindexter refuses to testify
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” One day after
fired national security aide Oliver
North repeatedly invoked his Fifth
Amendment rights against self
incrimination to avoid answering a
Senate panel's questions about the
Iranian arms sale affair, President
Reagan's former national security
adviser, Vice Adm. John Poindexter,
declined to answer the committee's
questions yesterday.
Poindexter never got to the wit
ness chair, sources said, but was in
terviewed by the chairman and vice
chairman of the Select Committee
on Intelligence, David Durenberger
(R-Minn.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)
prior to his scheduled formal ap
pearance. When the two senators
reported to their colleagues that
Poindexter was not prepared to
respond to their questions, the
panel reacted angrily and decided
to subpoena him for a second ap
pearance today, according to Senate
sources.
Poindexter, who resigned his
post as national security adviser last
week, refused to answer substantive
questions just hours after Reagan
said he had said he was taking the

"unprecedented step of permitting
two of my former national security
advisers to testify" before Congress
on the Iranian arms affair. Reagan
was referring to Poindexter and his
predecessor, Robert McFarlane,
who testified before the committee
for more than seven hours Monday.
"We will cooperate fully with these
inquiries," the president promised.
Poindexter's problems with the
committee came on the heels of
North's refusal to testify on the
opening day of what is expected to
be a several-week-long inquiry by
the intelligence panel, which is re
sponsible for overseeing the execu
tive branch's intelligence activities.
North has been identified as the
person who directed the arms sales
to Iran and subsequent diversion of
proceeds to aid the Nicaraguan con
tras; he was fired for his role.
In his brief appearance yesterday,
Poindexter told the intelligence
committee he would answer ques
tions only "in good time," accord
ing to one source. This angered
several senators, the source said.
