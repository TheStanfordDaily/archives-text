# President considers $1.1 trillion budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan ad
ministration is considering a fiscal
1988 budget with spending of $1.1 tril
lion that still meets the $108 billion
deficit target set by the Gramm-
Rudman-Hollings law.
The broad outlines of the new
budget began to emerge yesterday
after two days of meetings between
President Reagan with his senior aides
to decide how to cut spending, add
some revenue and sell government as
sets to meet the deficit target. James
Miller, director of the Office of Man
agement and Budget, said the combi
nation of deficit reducing measures
will have to add up to about $50 bil
lion.
The spending cuts decided upon at
the White House meetings are sched
uled to be presented to the Cabinet
today.
Administration sources said the
budget is likely to include proposals to
sell enough government loans to in
vestors to produce up to $8 billion in
revenue.
Altogether, the administration
sources said, spending in 1988 will be
about $1.1 trillion and receipts
boosted to more than $915 billion to
achieve the deficit target.
OMB has proposed actual spending

cuts — as opposed to merely letting
outlays rise in line with inflation — for
most major federal agencies and de
partments. The three areas allowed
substantially higher spending for 1988
would be defense, international affairs
and several programs administered
under the Department of Health and
Human Services.
Hitting the deficit target is being
made more difficult by an economy
that administration economists now
believe will not perform as well as they
predicted earlier. The economists are
completing a new forecast that shows
the economy growing at about a 3 per
cent rate during 1987, administration
officials said.
That would be about a percentage
point better than the 2 percent rise in
the gross national product, adjusted for
inflation, likely for 1986. But it would
also be weaker than the 4 percent
growth predicted for next year in the
administration's last official forecast.
Miller said that about half of the $50
billion reduction in the 1988 deficit
will come from spending cuts and pro
gram eliminations. The other half will
come from new user fees and other
revenues, along with sales of govern
ment assets, principally federal loans.
