The latest development in the controversy over Stan
ford's Western Culture Program is a proposal to imple
ment a spring course concentrating on the experiences
of minorities and women in the United States. This
course is designed as a "temporary solution" to the cur
rent program's neglect of minority and female contribu
tions to Western culture.
Despite the good intentions of the course's designer
and supporters, offering a third-quarter alternative to the
eight normal Western Culture tracks will solve none of
the problems students and faculty are now fighting to
solve.
A course whose main purpose is to expose students to
the problems of minorities and women in Western cul
ture is most likely to attract students who are already
aware that these problems exist. Instead of educating the
entire freshman class, the proposed course, by virtue of
class size limitations, can only help a few students ex
pand beyond the works of white males that pervade the
current Western Culture track.
Implementation of this course may actually harm the
movement to make the Western Culture Program more
sensitive to the role of women and minorities in history.
Since the students most likely to sign up for the course

have the loudest voices in the movement to change the
current program, appeasing their argument will make
the movement lose momentum. Eventually, the issue
will drop — those students who want to study minorities
and women in Western Culture will do so, and the others
will continue to be exposed to the same material now in
the program.
If the goal of students in the fight to change the West
ern Culture Program is to ensure that every Stanford stu
dent becomes aware of the minority and female ele
ments in our culture, an alternative, elective course will
only hinder the movement more.
Instead, the current mandatory courses should be
changed internally to include works by women and
minorities and to expose students to their historical
plight. The curriculum, not the entire program, is what
needs to be changed. Students and faculty should review
the material now presented in the program and replace
some of that literature with the works of major minority
and female figures in the course of Western culture.
The way to improve the Western Culture Program is
not to create an alternative to appease the students who
are aware of the problem. It is to implement a curricu
lum that exposes the problem to all students at Stanford.
