# Dispossess darkness with your light
## 
### 
Dark times have returned to Stanford campus. The
skies are filling with the dead gray of winter; the
holidays and home seem just out of reach beyond
two more weeks of problems sets, papers and finals;
and once again, thoughts of failure have become all
too tangible as our chances to raise those grades
have all but slipped away for one more quarter. I
think the hardest issue any of us have to face is that of
reconciling ourselves to an unkind world, and I
believe that the bedrock of any kind of hope is the
realization that there can be happiness despite the
darkness and despair that slink about within us.
Two things have always bothered the hell out of

me. The first is that so many people seem deter
mined to be unhappy, and the second is the sheer
impossibility of making another person happy. One
of my personal icons of horror was having a friend
tell me with a cold and adamant certainty in her voice
that "life sucks." There seemed to be no chink in the
armor of despair in which she clad herself. Her
defense against a world in which things could so hor
ribly go wrong was a stolid acceptance that they
would, and a rejection of anything beautiful or hope
ful on the grounds that if she let herself momentarily
believe that she could be happy then she would only
be hurt all the more when those hopes inevitably
would be dashed.
I was naive and arrogant enough to think that I
could help her. It was a hard lesson for me, but I
learned that no one can be responsible for anyone
else's happiness. You can be a part of someone's
happiness, and you can even make another person
happier, but all the care and concern in the world
will not extract one bit of another's despair unless
they are happy enough with themselves to let you in.
Happiness, you see, is a personal thing, and is ulti
mately not contingent on anything external to the in
dividual.

Much of our innate capacity to make ourselves
miserable hinges on this idea that there is some set
of conditions that must be met before we can con
sider ourselves well and truly happy. There have
been times when I've told myself that I'd be happy if I
were to be accepted by my peers, or I'd be happy if I
had a girlfriend, or I'd be happy if I got a good grade.
Well, they were lies, every single one of them. In fact,
I suspect that every statement beginning with "I'd be
happy if ..or "I'll be happy when" is unequiv
ocally false. The belief that our happiness is pred
icated on anything external to ourselves is no more
than a way to justify our feeling bad about ourselves
and to carrot-stick ourselves along toward goals that
our society has told us are important. "Happiness
when ..simply does not work: There is only happi
ness now.
Of course, the question of how we go about being
happy right this minute is not a trivial one, particu
larly with a lab report due tomorrow, 531 pages to
read before Friday and a relationship that is being
stressed the way everything else is at the end of a
quarter. When we're caught up in the midst of every
thing, there seems to be no time to do laundry, let
alone strive after something as intangible as happi
ness. Besides, Aristotle said happiness is something a
person achieves only on his deathbed when looking
back on a full and complete life, and I'm certainly not
ready for that. For one thing, happiness is not some
thing that can be striven after, and for another I don't
think the so-called happiness of being able to look
back at a life full of accomplishment can justify con
tinual misery if you weren't doing what you really
wanted to in order to accomplish those goals.
The world and its demands seem like a maelstrom
at times, and at those times it is hard to feel centered
and comfortable about who you are. But the idea that
all the nonsense you put up with will be justified by
something that will happen in the future, and that by
focusing on your goals you can get by, is an illusion.
This game is not about getting by or enduring until
we have that perfect job, that home in the suburbs,
the faithful spouse, those loving children, that VCR or
anything that We don't have now. Achieving any goal
is not as important as enjoying the road that you must
take to get there. If you cannot enjoy and appreciate
what you have now, there is certainly no reason to
believe that you will be able to do so once you have
what you think you are missing.

The final source of despair in our lives, it seems to
me, is the burden of our past. It is so very natural, so
very easy to blame ourselves for the hurts we have
faced in the past whether or not we were responsible
in any sense at all. You know well the darknesses you
have experienced; you have shared the darknesses of
your closest friends. So you know how hard it is for a
person who had been in an abusive relationship to
convince herself that it wasn't her fault that he kept
hitting her, you know how hard it is to come to
believe that it wasn't entirely your fault that you were
dumped by your lover, and you know how long and
hard it takes the wounds that have driven our souls to
scab over and heal.
Internal growth begins with simple self
forgiveness, happiness begins with nothing more
than self-love, and hope begins with the elementary
faith that you are a capable and worthwhile human
being who will not only be able to cope with the ex
igencies of an unkind world but will be able to ap
preciate and enjoy the scenery along the way. This is
the triumph of the human spirit: that we are the light
to dispossess the darkness, that we may be harrowed
to our very core and may still hope and that in the
face of an unkind world we may find within our
selves the courage to cherish ourselves and others.
Yes, we make mistakes; yes, we hurt ourselves; yes,
we hurt others; yes, we see many of our plans and
dreams come to nothing; yes, we will face pettiness
and hatred day by day, not as just punishment for any
wrongs we may have committed, but simply from
whim and prejudice.
Hope is about letting go. It's about letting go of the
hurts of the past, the frustrations of the present, and
our anxieties about the future. We must let go, not
because the pain we have known in the past or the
dreams we have for the future are not important, but
because the very act of clinging to these things gets in
the way of the healing and growth which we must
have in order to be the people we want to be. I guess
in the final analysis it all comes down to a matter of
accepting our inadequacies, but nevertheless believ
ing in ourselves and our ability to enjoy the road we
are walking. The light of any destination or even des
tiny pales in comparison to the simple joy of living.
For we are the light to dispossess the darkness.

your closest friends. So you know how hard it is for a
person who had been in an abusive relationship to
convince herself that it wasn't her fault that he kept
hitting her, you know how hard it is to come to
believe that it wasn't entirely your fault that you were
dumped by your lover, and you know how long and
hard it takes the wounds that have driven our souls to
scab over and heal.
Internal growth begins with simple self
forgiveness, happiness begins with nothing more
than self-love, and hope begins with the elementary
faith that you are a capable and worthwhile human
being who will not only be able to cope with the ex
igencies of an unkind world but will be able to ap
preciate and enjoy the scenery along the way. This is
the triumph of the human spirit: that we are the light
to dispossess the darkness, that we may be harrowed
to our very core and may still hope and that in the
face of an unkind world we may find within our
selves the courage to cherish ourselves and others.
Yes, we make mistakes; yes, we hurt ourselves; yes,
we hurt others; yes, we see many of our plans and
dreams come to nothing; yes, we will face pettiness
and hatred day by day, not as just punishment for any
wrongs we may have committed, but simply from
whim and prejudice.
Hope is about letting go. It's about letting go of the
hurts of the past, the frustrations of the present, and
our anxieties about the future. We must let go, not
because the pain we have known in the past or the
dreams we have for the future are not important, but
because the very act of clinging to these things gets in
the way of the healing and growth which we must
have in order to be the people we want to be. I guess
in the final analysis it all comes down to a matter of
accepting our inadequacies, but nevertheless believ
ing in ourselves and our ability to enjoy the road we
are walking. The light of any destination or even des
tiny pales in comparison to the simple joy of living.
For we are the light to dispossess the darkness.

Dark times have returned to Stanford campus. The
skies are filling with the dead gray of winter; the
holidays and home seem just out of reach beyond
two more weeks of problems sets, papers and finals;
and once again, thoughts of failure have become all
too tangible as our chances to raise those grades
have all but slipped away for one more quarter. I
think the hardest issue any of us have to face is that of
reconciling ourselves to an unkind world, and I
believe that the bedrock of any kind of hope is the
realization that there can be happiness despite the
darkness and despair that slink about within us.
Two things have always bothered the hell out of

me. The first is that so many people seem deter
mined to be unhappy, and the second is the sheer
impossibility of making another person happy. One
of my personal icons of horror was having a friend
tell me with a cold and adamant certainty in her voice
that "life sucks." There seemed to be no chink in the
armor of despair in which she clad herself. Her
defense against a world in which things could so hor
ribly go wrong was a stolid acceptance that they
would, and a rejection of anything beautiful or hope
ful on the grounds that if she let herself momentarily
believe that she could be happy then she would only
be hurt all the more when those hopes inevitably
would be dashed.
I was naive and arrogant enough to think that I
could help her. It was a hard lesson for me, but I
learned that no one can be responsible for anyone
else's happiness. You can be a part of someone's
happiness, and you can even make another person
happier, but all the care and concern in the world
will not extract one bit of another's despair unless
they are happy enough with themselves to let you in.
Happiness, you see, is a personal thing, and is ulti
mately not contingent on anything external to the in
dividual.

Much of our innate capacity to make ourselves
miserable hinges on this idea that there is some set
of conditions that must be met before we can con
sider ourselves well and truly happy. There have
been times when I've told myself that I'd be happy if I
were to be accepted by my peers, or I'd be happy if I
had a girlfriend, or I'd be happy if I got a good grade.
Well, they were lies, every single one of them. In fact,
I suspect that every statement beginning with "I'd be
happy if ..or "I'll be happy when" is unequiv
ocally false. The belief that our happiness is pred
icated on anything external to ourselves is no more
than a way to justify our feeling bad about ourselves
and to carrot-stick ourselves along toward goals that
our society has told us are important. "Happiness
when ..simply does not work: There is only happi
ness now.
Of course, the question of how we go about being
happy right this minute is not a trivial one, particu
larly with a lab report due tomorrow, 531 pages to
read before Friday and a relationship that is being
stressed the way everything else is at the end of a
quarter. When we're caught up in the midst of every
thing, there seems to be no time to do laundry, let
alone strive after something as intangible as happi
ness. Besides, Aristotle said happiness is something a
person achieves only on his deathbed when looking
back on a full and complete life, and I'm certainly not
ready for that. For one thing, happiness is not some
thing that can be striven after, and for another I don't
think the so-called happiness of being able to look
back at a life full of accomplishment can justify con
tinual misery if you weren't doing what you really
wanted to in order to accomplish those goals.
The world and its demands seem like a maelstrom
at times, and at those times it is hard to feel centered
and comfortable about who you are. But the idea that
all the nonsense you put up with will be justified by
something that will happen in the future, and that by
focusing on your goals you can get by, is an illusion.
This game is not about getting by or enduring until
we have that perfect job, that home in the suburbs,
the faithful spouse, those loving children, that VCR or
anything that We don't have now. Achieving any goal
is not as important as enjoying the road that you must
take to get there. If you cannot enjoy and appreciate
what you have now, there is certainly no reason to
believe that you will be able to do so once you have
what you think you are missing.

The final source of despair in our lives, it seems to
me, is the burden of our past. It is so very natural, so
very easy to blame ourselves for the hurts we have
faced in the past whether or not we were responsible
in any sense at all. You know well the darknesses you
have experienced; you have shared the darknesses of
your closest friends. So you know how hard it is for a
person who had been in an abusive relationship to
convince herself that it wasn't her fault that he kept
