# Western Culture must fight divisions
## 
### 
Recently, The Daily ran an article
reporting that 80 percent of Stan
ford students approved of the Western
Culture Program (Nov. 24). I was
annoyed. I was especially irritated with
the obvious implications of such a
report. I'm not arguing against the
validity of the article, but rather the
message the article projects: Why are
we trying to change a program that a
majority of students are satisfied with?
In other words, if it ain't broke, don't
fix it.

I do not wish to relate the multi
plicity of arguments for why the cur
rent Western Culture Program is
indeed broke, because they have been
presented often enough already. I'm
sure most of us are tired of hearing
about the problems with Western Cul
ture. Well, maybe not the freshman
(their problems are just beginning). I
have completed the Western Culture
Program, and like most of the students
cited in the Daily article, I too can say
that what I learned in Western Culture
was valuable. Who can knock Plato and
Aristotle? But why I had to learn this
particular information is the problem
I'm having. I mean, I could have
learned some equally and maybe more
valuable information in another in
vigorating academic course at Stan
ford Western Culture simply dt)es not
fulfill the requirements of a year-long,
required course.
A required course should be a
course that prepares me for my future.
It should be a course that I absolutely
should not do without Granted, the

Western Culture Program has interest
ing information, but could those who
have completed the program have
done without it? Yes.
As a freshman, I was actively in
volved with advocating change in the
Western Culture Program. I saw the
program as racist and biased in favor of
white, male, European ideas. This is
true, but it is only true in the same way
as any Afro-American or Chicano
studies course. But Western Culture is
different in that it is given the superior
ity of being a required course.
Some argue that the course ac
curately reflects the dominant influen
ces of past world history. And far be it
from me to say that the white, Anglo-
Saxon culture has not played a major
role in the history of the world and the
subsequent formation of the United
States. But should we all be forced to
focus on just one aspect of the various
life experiences that created the world
as we know it? Is learning European
history the only way of understanding
and coping with the world? Is taking a
year-long study of Western culture
going to help me understand what it
means to be black in today's society?
No. It will help me get my degree,
but I must say that a year of Western
Culture has done next to nothing to
enlighten my understanding of the
world. This is because my understand
ing of our world comes not from an
cient texts in which people of my an
cestry play a secondary role, but the
experiences I go through in day-to-day
life. My freshman fight against the re
quired Western Culture Program has
done more to enlighten my under
standing of my experiences in this
world than sitting in any hour-long
lecture concerning William James' con
ceptions of reality.

OK, maybe I'm expecting the West
ern Culture Program to do too much.
It is just a springboard from which I am
to jump from and dive into the study of
other non-European experiences. It is
a program based on the assumption
that understanding the so-called domi
nant European influence will some
how make me better-suited for the
world. Thus, a black student has just as
much to gain from the Western Culture
Program as any white student. But what
are they both gaining? Not much.
Students are receiving only a small
amount of the vast information
available. (This fact makes the idea of
broadening the course even more
ludicrous.) This bit of information
does nothing to promote the needed
racial understanding between many
different cultural experiences. We see
this failure on our own campus. Yes,
the Stanford campus can be viewed as
a racist institution. But it is no more
racist than the rest of the world. For ex
ample, theme houses have been
accused of being racist or promoting
segregation. Well, Ujamaa is no more
racist than a white theme house such
as Branner. The emphasis, though,
should be on the fact that they are both
separatist establishments. Sure, one
can argue that people prefer to be with
their own kind, i.e., birds of a feather
flock together. But can we afford this in
a world that is forever increasing in
population and being made smaller
due to technological advances in com
munication? We need to start learning
how to get along with one another.
The Western Culture Program does
nothing to solve a debate such as the
one concerning theme houses on the
Stanford campus. As the only required
course of Stanford University, Western
Culture should be teaching us about

each other — not how one particular
group viewed or didn't view the other.
What is Western culture? The
simplest answer is that Western culture
is the culture from which our Ameri
can culture has evolved and continues
to exist within. How many times have
you heard this deceptive phrase: "the
great American melting pot"? It is a
phrase based on the belief that if you
are a minority in America, you blend in
and just disappear into the depths of
this great, big, heated pot. But America
is not a pot — it is a country made up
of different people whose cognitive
evaluations of their social experiences
differ greatly. Different cultures need
to learn different things to better un
derstand their existence in American
society.
There will always be controversy
surrounding the required Western
Culture Program as long as the admin
istration fails to recognize this. As an
institution of higher learning, Stanford
should take the first step in devising a
program that provides through
literature and class discussion the
means by which the black and white
student can better understand each
other. Each different life experience
must be linked together in a more ex
emplifying social context. It would be
sort of like a year-long rap on race.
One does not get this education in a
program that states: I was your master,
and you were my slave. Until this hap
pens here, and throughout the world,
we will always remain an Earth
divided.
This is too idealistic, you say. Well,
then, why do you get out of bed each
morning?
