End U.S. lies to
Central America
In Guatemala, President Corezo has
declared with courage and determina
tion that U.S. training of contra troops
in his country will not be allowed. He
has stated that Guatemala has room
only for the Guatemalan army; a
foreign power cannot be permitted to
use Guatemalan soil to prepare the
Somocista contras and mercenaries to
carry on the dirty war of contra/U.S.
aggression against Nicaragua. Presi
dent Corezo gave a clear warning that
such activities, funded by a foreign
power (the United States), will lead to
the regionalization of the war in
Central America.
Honduras does not want either us
or the contras. Nor does Costa Rica.
The small, desperately poor countries
of Central America have worked
together to promote the Contadora
peace process, a process that
Nicaragua has stated repeatedly it
would approve. It is the United States
that stands in the way and prevents
the consummation of Contadora.
I think it is impossible — I am
unable — to express in words the
profound revulsion, the horror and
the grief and the guilt that I, as an
American taxpayer, feel when I con
front, in my mind and spirit and im
agination, the ghastly consequences of
my country's policies in Central
America. What can be worse than U.S.
policy in El Salvador? In Nicaragua? In
Honduras?
We terrorize and brutalize our
neighbors to the South. We
deliberately impoverish them; we
wreck their ecology and subvert their
economy, while our government lies
to them and lies to the American
people. Basta\ Enough!

Stanford University will now re

The University is also continuing to

"study" the issue of divestment from
companies engaged in business in
South Africa so that the University can
understand the "consequences" of
this action. If the University accepts
students of good moral character,
what does it propose to teach them?
To dissemble? Does anyone seriously
think the magnitude of the Univer
sity's investment is such as to have a
significant economic effect? Clearly,
the issue is whether Stanford is will

then what competence does the Uni

I A T . \' Q. 1 i' (
Regarding The Daily's printing of
crossword puzzles, I send my hear
tiest "Yes"; please do keep it in. I have
been a loyal solver of the puzzle since
The Daily started printing it in the
'70s. Indeed, I really miss it during
breaks in printing and when the paper
is not printed daily in the summer.
Please consider one request,
however. Please print the answer to
the puzzle in the same issue. I am not
always able to find a copy of The Daily
every single day. For years, I have had
atrocious luck whenever I try to ob
tain the issue that has the answer to a
puzzle I've been stumped on. Since
The Daily nearly always prints the
answer in a different place anyway,
what would it hurt to give us the same
day's puzzle answer?
Give us addicts a break, folks.
Please? I hate to discard a puzzle not
quite solved, but occasionally a few
words elude me and I never get to
find out what "mean or intervening:
law" or "old word meaning incense"
really mean.
I enjoy The Daily — headlines,
editorials and letters especially — but
I do indeed turn first to the cross
word. Please keep it in!
Thanks a lot.
