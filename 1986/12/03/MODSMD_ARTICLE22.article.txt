### SUE TROTT

Daylight savings time may no longer
be in effect, but his day still starts
before the sun clears the horizon. By 9
ia.m. — already awake for three hours
now — he joins the rest of us for
morning classes. But by mid-afternoon
he has disappeared again, and, al
though friends and dormmates may
catch a glimpse of him at dinner (his
hair still wet from a shower), he's
usually off to study for the night before
anyone else.
No, he's not Superman — just a Stan
ford varsity athlete.
Anyone who has ever known any of
the varsity athletes here at Stanford has
probably asked himself at one time or
another, "How do they ever manage to
organize their time to practice five
hours a day, take 16 units, study and
still find the energy to breathe?"
The truth is that there is no one an
swer to that question; there really is no
typical "Life of the Stanford Varsity Ath
• lete." Rather, each student-athlete
! weighs his academic and athletic com
) mitments differently.

Like breathing or sleeping

"Yeah, I'm tired all the time," sopho
! more swimmer Kurt Kroesche says in
response to everyone's first question.
"But you get used to it ... and it's a
; good tired."
For Kroesche, a typical day
resembles the above scenario. It in
cludes two hours of morning workout
and nearly three hours in the after
• noon, supplemented by weight train
' ing twice a week. Somehow he also
• manages to juggle 19 units around all
. of this activity — "I take as many
! classes as I can when we're off season,"
; he says — and presently plans a
double major in history and drama.
; "Homework?" jokes freshman Hank
• Wise, also a member of the swim team.
. "That's a good question."
' But in all seriousness, the general
consensus — from the water polo
! player to the inside right linebacker —
is that studying is done "between naps
• and practice," and each athlete
)■ manages to work everything into his
daily schedule simply because he
knows he has to.
For sophomore freestyler Aimee

Berzins, swimming is hardly just an ex
tracurricular activity. She explains,
"I've been swimming competitively for
12 years, and by now it's become like
breathing or sleeping — something I
don't even decide to do. I would just
never think of not doing it."
Consequently, Berzins says, fitting
her 20 units (which, according to her,
"may not be pre-med but certainly

aren't 'mick'") around workouts and
meets is comparable to studying
around other everyday activities like
eating dinner.
Freshman water polo player Steve
Millham points out: "People think that
since sports take a lot of time they hurt
your education, but they've helped
mine. I'd be wasting so much time
here if I wasn't playing polo."

And sophomore Amy Berner, a two
year veteran of the women's crew
team, says crew — a walk-on sport —
always has a huge turnout of sopho
mores at the start of the season, but is
now down to six newcomers; only
those able to budget their time stick it
out. Amazingly enough, despite their
tremendous athletic commitments, the
rowers range from pre-meds to engi-

neering majors to honors English stu
dents who consistently have the high
est average GPAs of any athletes on
campus.
Priorities
However, Berner adds that this aca
demic dimension of the rower s life is,
in a sense, an obstacle to achievement

that even the coach must accept. At
present, the University of Washington
crew team is the best in the Pacific 10
Conference . And while Stanford may
be closing in on them, "The difference
between them and us," according to
Berner, "is that we study— And even
though a coach always wishes that no
matter how much you're giving at
practices you'd always give a little
more, ours understands that we also
want to take advantage of the great
(academic) programs they offer here
... and to stay awake in class."
Both Kroesche and Berzins also say
no matter how important swimming is
to them studying will always be a top
priority.
"Above all we're here at Stanford to
study," Kroesche says. "But I'd still
never let it interfere with swimming.
I'd just arrange my time so I'd never
have to choose between the two."
But opinions differ on this matter.
Freshman water polo player Mike Dar
ling readily admits that in his mind he
may tell himself that studying is his top
priority here at Stanford. "But if it
came down to cramming for a mid
term or going to practice, I know I'd go
to practice," he says.
He adds that most people don't
seem to understand that it's not the
fear of getting yelled at by a coach that
compels an athlete to show up every
day. "When someone tells me 1 can just
blow off practice just this once, they
don't realize that the coach would un
derstand if I couldn't make it,"he ex
plains. "But when I'm not there I worry
that I'm missing some important new
play or something."
And t hen there's the other end of the
scale. Sophomore football players Dar
ron Bennett and Ray Huckestein flat
out admit that for them, especially
during football season, homework is
not a priority.
"I put football first, then socializing,
then napping, then just goofing
around," Bennett says, ticking off his
mental list. And with strenuous daily
practices from 1:30 to 6 p.m., not much
time is left for studying.
"Besides," he adds, "we've got head
aches every night from smashing into
each other all afternoon — try studying
with that."




In addition, Huckestein comments
that only because of the team's recent
success and preparation for the Gator
Bowl has Head Coach Jack Elway been
putting on the pressure.
"It's not like most people think,"
Huckestein says. "Sure, we work hard,
but he (Elway) is a really understand
ing guy, and I doubt he's as intensive
about us as, say, the swim coach prob
ably is (about the swimmers)."
Libby Kinkead, assistant women's
swim coach and a former member of
the team, will vouch for the fact that a
swim coach — even unintentionally —
gives her swimmers the message that
everything in life should be secondary
to swimming.
"A coach will barely ever tell you to
slow down, take it easy, you're working
too hard," she says. "Every day at
workout you're told that when you go
home, get your homework done, eat
this kind of food, get this much sleep,
and beat your times when you come
back tomorrow."
Can't just blow off sleep
So, if the athlete divides his time be
tween studying hard and working out
hard in varying ratios as he sees fit,
when does he play hard, as Stanford
students are supposed to?
Interestingly enough, the general
response is that although some of the
athletes feel isolated to some degree,
most of them don't feel cheated of the
full "Stanford experience."
Wise elaborates on the responsibil
ity one feels as a Stanford varsity ath
lete, especially one on scholarship. "I
can't swim alter college, so I've got to
go my all now," he says.
And it may mean less partying and
"playing," but for him that's OK: "You
have to make every day count. I have
the rest of my life to go to parties."
Kroesche admits he may not have
the time to pursue many of his other
interests during his college years, but,
like Wise, he sees swimming as a tem
porary element of his life. And while it
would be nice to be able to relax over
summer and Christmas vacations in
stead of keeping up the rigorous work
outs, as most athletes are required to
do, swimming is something to be done
now or never.
In fact, Kroesche says that his arrival
at Stanford has had a positive effect on
his performance. "Once you get used
to the transition from being your high
school's MVP to being just another
member of the team, being around all

those talented athletes makes you
more competitive and hard-working,"
he explains.
Darling and Millham both say having
to miss many traditional Stanford
freshman dorm functions is more than
made up for by the camaraderie on the
polo team.
"Those guys (returning lettermen)
really welcomed us when we got
here," says Darling. "We're a very
close-knit group — no ego clashes get
in the way of friendships. Even the best
players put their personal accomplish
ments aside and just concentrate on
improving the team so we can be there
at NCAAs."
"I don't know, sometimes I did feel
like a lot was going on in my freshman
dorm without me," says Berner, recall
ing all of the late night birthday parties
and "even just B.S. sessions" she heard
going on down the hall while trying to
sleep because morning workout was in
six-and-a-half hours. "If you do a sport,
you just can't blow off sleep," she says.
"But the big races in the spring make it
worth the sacrifice.
"People really respect you for it,"
she says. "They think it's great to be so
involved in something."
Obsession
Kinkead knows from personal ex
perience just how "out of hand" such
positive reinforcement can get.
"If you'd asked me three years ago
— when I was still swimming — I
probably would've said that I had a
balanced life," she comments. Not un
til a neck and shoulder injury forced
her out of the pool for good did she
take the time to re-evaluate herself and
realize just how distorted her perspec
tives on life had really been, due to her
obsession with swimming.
Kinkead started swimming com
petitively at age 11 and claims that,
before long, she found her identity in
being a swimmer. "Between your
coach and your peers you can't help
but get into a grind," she says."I mean,
everyone talks to you about your swim
ming ... everyone admires you for
your swimming ... you start to think
that that's why people like you.
"Everyone develops identities with
certain things that they do. But since
sports are so glorified, everyone wants
to be friends with an athlete. The ath
lete is never criticized for working
toward being number one, whereas a
student who studies constantly
develops the stigma of being a nerd.' "
Kinkead found it had gotten to the
point where all she thought about was
what her times were going to be that
week. She says the day the doctors told
her she'd have to quit began the most

painful period of her life.
"Our society lives on a basis of con
ditional love, and the message I was
getting was that everyone was im
pressed with my swimming," she ex
plains. "Then the thing 1 was great at
wasn't there anymore, so now what
was I? And would anyone still like me?"
However, Kinkead points out that
hers was an extreme case; many ath
letes are able to maintain balanced
lives while remaining competitive, she
says.
For instance, while Huckestein and
Millham reply that if an injury halted
their athletic careers they'd "go crazy,"
Kroesche, Darling and Berner all agree
they'd "probably find something else
to do."
Bennen laughs,"l don't know ... I'd
probably study more."
Stereotyped
Meanwhile, both Millham and Huck
estein see yet another side to their
identities as football players.
"Football players here aren't given a
chance," Huckestein says. "We get
stereotyped as being just a bunch of
dumb jocks who got in on athletic
scholarships."
Bennett adds that someone may be
outwardly nice and look up to him "in
stature," but "1 always have the feeling
that in the back of his mind that person
is thinking how hard he worked to get
into this school while here's this guy
who got an acceptance letter handed to
him for playing football."
That may partially explain the migra
tion of football players up to the Theta
Delta Chi and Delta Tau Delta frater
nity houses. "It's more comfortable to
live with a bunch of guys who don't
look down their noses at you," says
Bennett, a resident of the Delt house.
"I always felt isolated from my fresh
man dorm for just that reason ...
which isn't fair because we've got
some really smart guys on the team."
The preconceptions concerning
football players may be unfair and in
accurate, but both Huckestein and
Bennett probably speak for more than
themselves when they say that, given
the opportunity, they would go profes
sional after college.
"Of course I would," Huckestein
comments. "Ultimately, I guess, that's
what we're all shooting for."
Then what about all those athletes
whose careers end with college
graduation? What are they making all
of these social and academic sacrifices
for?
"No water polo players have any
million-dollar contracts waiting for
them when school's over," says Dar
ling. "We do it for the sport."
