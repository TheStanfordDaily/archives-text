### SUE TROTT

Daylight savings time may no longer
be in effect, but his day still starts
before the sun clears the horizon. By 9
ia.m. — already awake for three hours
now — he joins the rest of us for
morning classes. But by mid-afternoon
he has disappeared again, and, al
though friends and dormmates may
catch a glimpse of him at dinner (his
hair still wet from a shower), he's
usually off to study for the night before
anyone else.
No, he's not Superman — just a Stan
ford varsity athlete.
Anyone who has ever known any of
the varsity athletes here at Stanford has
probably asked himself at one time or
another, "How do they ever manage to
organize their time to practice five
hours a day, take 16 units, study and
still find the energy to breathe?"
The truth is that there is no one an
swer to that question; there really is no
typical "Life of the Stanford Varsity Ath
• lete." Rather, each student-athlete
! weighs his academic and athletic com
) mitments differently.

Like breathing or sleeping

"Yeah, I'm tired all the time," sopho
! more swimmer Kurt Kroesche says in
response to everyone's first question.
"But you get used to it ... and it's a
; good tired."
For Kroesche, a typical day
resembles the above scenario. It in
cludes two hours of morning workout
and nearly three hours in the after
• noon, supplemented by weight train
' ing twice a week. Somehow he also
• manages to juggle 19 units around all
. of this activity — "I take as many
! classes as I can when we're off season,"
; he says — and presently plans a
double major in history and drama.
; "Homework?" jokes freshman Hank
• Wise, also a member of the swim team.
. "That's a good question."
' But in all seriousness, the general
consensus — from the water polo
! player to the inside right linebacker —
is that studying is done "between naps
• and practice," and each athlete
)■ manages to work everything into his
daily schedule simply because he
knows he has to.
For sophomore freestyler Aimee

Berzins, swimming is hardly just an ex
tracurricular activity. She explains,
"I've been swimming competitively for
12 years, and by now it's become like
breathing or sleeping — something I
don't even decide to do. I would just
never think of not doing it."
Consequently, Berzins says, fitting
her 20 units (which, according to her,
"may not be pre-med but certainly

aren't 'mick'") around workouts and
meets is comparable to studying
around other everyday activities like
eating dinner.
Freshman water polo player Steve
Millham points out: "People think that
since sports take a lot of time they hurt
your education, but they've helped
mine. I'd be wasting so much time
here if I wasn't playing polo."

And sophomore Amy Berner, a two
year veteran of the women's crew
team, says crew — a walk-on sport —
always has a huge turnout of sopho
mores at the start of the season, but is
now down to six newcomers; only
those able to budget their time stick it
out. Amazingly enough, despite their
tremendous athletic commitments, the
rowers range from pre-meds to engi-

neering majors to honors English stu
dents who consistently have the high
est average GPAs of any athletes on
campus.
Priorities
However, Berner adds that this aca
demic dimension of the rower s life is,
in a sense, an obstacle to achievement

that even the coach must accept. At
present, the University of Washington
crew team is the best in the Pacific 10
Conference . And while Stanford may
be closing in on them, "The difference
between them and us," according to
Berner, "is that we study— And even
though a coach always wishes that no
matter how much you're giving at
practices you'd always give a little
more, ours understands that we also
want to take advantage of the great
(academic) programs they offer here
... and to stay awake in class."
Both Kroesche and Berzins also say
no matter how important swimming is
to them studying will always be a top
priority.
"Above all we're here at Stanford to
study," Kroesche says. "But I'd still
never let it interfere with swimming.
I'd just arrange my time so I'd never
have to choose between the two."
But opinions differ on this matter.
Freshman water polo player Mike Dar
ling readily admits that in his mind he
may tell himself that studying is his top
priority here at Stanford. "But if it
came down to cramming for a mid
term or going to practice, I know I'd go
to practice," he says.
He adds that most people don't
seem to understand that it's not the
fear of getting yelled at by a coach that
compels an athlete to show up every
day. "When someone tells me 1 can just
blow off practice just this once, they
don't realize that the coach would un
derstand if I couldn't make it,"he ex
plains. "But when I'm not there I worry
that I'm missing some important new
play or something."
And t hen there's the other end of the
scale. Sophomore football players Dar
ron Bennett and Ray Huckestein flat
out admit that for them, especially
during football season, homework is
not a priority.
"I put football first, then socializing,
then napping, then just goofing
around," Bennett says, ticking off his
mental list. And with strenuous daily
practices from 1:30 to 6 p.m., not much
time is left for studying.
"Besides," he adds, "we've got head
aches every night from smashing into
each other all afternoon — try studying
with that."
