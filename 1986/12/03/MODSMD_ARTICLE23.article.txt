# Bug looks at high price of a Messiah
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
Why is the December "Messiah" Sing in Memorial
iJjurch so expensive ($6)? Are the soloists arid/or or
chestra paid'? Aren't we expected to tyring our own
'Messiah scores? The fee rather discourages family
groups from attending together. We pay less than that
to go to a concert to be entertained, such as the Stan
ford Jazz Band concert for $5, whereas for the sing
we pay to become a part of the entertainment.

Stanford's "Messiah" Sing, one of the longest
running in this area (taking place annually Since
1974), enables all those shower crooners among us
to take part in a performance of Handel's famous
oratorio.
There is a valid argument, however, in asking why
an admission price is charged when the admittee is a
part of the performance.
The soloists are professionals but are not paid;
likewise, the conductor, Music Prof. William Ramsey,
is not paid for the performance and neither are the
musicians in the orchestra.
In fact, Ramsey said, "If you want to play, come and
bring your instrument, and we'll provide you with a

score and music stand" on the night of the perfor
mance.
The annual sing was free until a few years ago,
when an admission price was first charged. Now
individuals must pay 16 ($3 for students) and provide
their own score, which will be available at the Stan
ford Bookstore for a nominal charge.
Ramsey said the concert is not "non-cost." Scores
must be provided for the orchestra musicians, stu
dent technicians are paid, and there are some costs
associated with having the event in Memorial
Church. Ramsey said, however, that the receipts from
the concert benefit music students and those in the
choral program.
According to Music Deptartment Administrator
John Planting, the price of tickets for nearly all de
partment performances this year ranges from $5 to
$6, putting the sing's ticket price in line with that of
most other shows.
The San Francisco Conservatory of Music also puts
on a participatory performance of "Messiah" at
Davies Hall in San Francisco. Ticket prices for that
sing-along range from $15 to $40. The conservatory
pays for the hall and the conductor, and the tickets
sold represent its largest fund-raising effort of the
year.
My best explanation for the admission charge is
that the sing almost always sells out, and people are
turned away. Elementary economics would dictate

that an admission charge puts the number of people
who want to attend at that price more in line with the
number of available seats.
The sing is in Memorial Church on Dec. 14 at 8
p.m. Tickets are available. Hallelujah.
Dear Bug Me,
How much must one donate to have a building
named after oneself? More than half? If Stanford
built a building without donated funds, would some
one be able to donate t5 or so and get their name on
the building because they are the only donor?
— Phil Anthropist
To paraphrase J. P. Morgan, if you have to ask you
can't afford it.
There are some "informal" guidelines to leaving a
"name gift," according to David Fulton, the director
of communications for the Office of Development.
Fulton said the cost of the building, the availability
of funds and the prospects that the Office of Develop
ment has to contribute those funds all play a part in
whether or not one of Stanford's buildings will be
named for a particular individual. However, he said
he could not remember a case in which the name of
the building did not come from the building's prin
cipal donor. ,

Fulton suggested that one put up
35 to 70 percent of the total project
cost to qualify.
This does not mean that all the
named buildings on campus were
paid for by their namesake. The Ter
man Engineering Center was built
through the generosity of alumni
William Hewlett and David Packard,
who requested that the building
bear the name of Frederick Terman,
the former Stanford provost and
"father of Silicon Valley."
Of course, not all of the Univer
sity's structures are built with
donated funds. For those that are
not, a token contribution will not get
your name on the lips of future
generations of Stanford students,
Fulton said.
Dear Bug Me,
When were those red banners that
hang from the lampposts around
Stanford first used? What occasions
warrant their use? Where did they
come from and who paid for them?
— Red Banner Baron
Not available in any store at any
price, those banners that you've seen
hanging around were purchased for
the 1985 Commencement out of the
money the University budgeted for
the event.
Larry Davidson, the associate di
rector of University Events and
Services, told me that the banners
were specially designed by Art Prof.
Gregory Lynch to give the com
mencement a "festive flair." They
cost $34 each, and 1,000 of them

were attached to some sections of
seating at Stanford Stadium during
commencement.
Davidson said special security
(which included some football
players) was hired during com
mencement to prevent the banners
from becoming souvenirs. Appar
ently they weren't good enough be
cause there was "an exciting police
chase" in which some people unaf
filiated with Stanford tried to make
off with a banner in a car, Davidson
said.
The banners became so popular
that University President Donald
Kennedy suggested they be used
more frequently. In addition to the
banners used in the stadium, there
are 50-60 double-sided banners,
which are hung from special brack
ets on some of the lampposts on the
Farm. They were last displayed
during the week of freshman orien
tation and will be flown again during
the week of May 14 to coincide with
the 100 th anniversary of the laying of
the University's cornerstone.
Dear Bug Me,
Why doesn 7 Hoover Tower have to
have a red flashing light on top for
airplanes? It's probably too low for
airplanes, but I've seen a lot of
helicopters come close.
— Amelia Earhart
Hoover Tower does have a light
on top; it just doesn't flash.
There is a constant red light on the
top of the structure which, said Gary
Gruber, the facilities manager of the
Hoover Institution, puts the tower in
compliance with the Federal Avia
tion Administration's regulations.
Next time you're in your helicop
ter check it out.

Dear Bug Me,
On the second floor of Sweet Hall
the women's bathroom door swings
inward, while the men's door swings
outward. Is this accidental or part of
some greater sexual allusion?
— Swings Both Ways
The construction of the bathroom
entrances was neither a mistake nor
a sexual statement.
Brian Peters of Spencer Associates,
the firm that designed the building,
said the doors swing in different di
rections for improved handicapped
access. There is an angled wall just
inside the door of the men's room
that would restrict the amount of
room a wheelchair has to negotiate if
the door didn't swing out.
The women's room, on the other
hand, does not have this angled wall
so the door can swing in without
minimizing access. Thus, the door
was designed to swing in.
Let's keep bathroom questions to
a minimum, please.
Nobel Addendum: Over the
weekend, I was at a friend's house
and happened to pick up a copy of
the September/October issue of the
Harvard Magazine. (It's all right since
the recipient went to Stanford as an
undergrad.) In it, Harvard claims it
faculty members have received 29
Nobel prizes, making it first among
academic institutions, followed by
UC-Berkeley with 14 and Stanford
with 13. Both Harvard and Berkeley
have won an additional prize since
then.
Last week I wimped out of ranking
Stanford with respect to Nobels it
has won. If you care to believe the
Harvard Magazine, we rank third.
