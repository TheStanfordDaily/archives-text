# Bug looks at high price of a Messiah
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
Why is the December "Messiah" Sing in Memorial
iJjurch so expensive ($6)? Are the soloists arid/or or
chestra paid'? Aren't we expected to tyring our own
'Messiah scores? The fee rather discourages family
groups from attending together. We pay less than that
to go to a concert to be entertained, such as the Stan
ford Jazz Band concert for $5, whereas for the sing
we pay to become a part of the entertainment.

Stanford's "Messiah" Sing, one of the longest
running in this area (taking place annually Since
1974), enables all those shower crooners among us
to take part in a performance of Handel's famous
oratorio.
There is a valid argument, however, in asking why
an admission price is charged when the admittee is a
part of the performance.
The soloists are professionals but are not paid;
likewise, the conductor, Music Prof. William Ramsey,
is not paid for the performance and neither are the
musicians in the orchestra.
In fact, Ramsey said, "If you want to play, come and
bring your instrument, and we'll provide you with a

score and music stand" on the night of the perfor
mance.
The annual sing was free until a few years ago,
when an admission price was first charged. Now
individuals must pay 16 ($3 for students) and provide
their own score, which will be available at the Stan
ford Bookstore for a nominal charge.
Ramsey said the concert is not "non-cost." Scores
must be provided for the orchestra musicians, stu
dent technicians are paid, and there are some costs
associated with having the event in Memorial
Church. Ramsey said, however, that the receipts from
the concert benefit music students and those in the
choral program.
According to Music Deptartment Administrator
John Planting, the price of tickets for nearly all de
partment performances this year ranges from $5 to
$6, putting the sing's ticket price in line with that of
most other shows.
The San Francisco Conservatory of Music also puts
on a participatory performance of "Messiah" at
Davies Hall in San Francisco. Ticket prices for that
sing-along range from $15 to $40. The conservatory
pays for the hall and the conductor, and the tickets
sold represent its largest fund-raising effort of the
year.
My best explanation for the admission charge is
that the sing almost always sells out, and people are
turned away. Elementary economics would dictate

that an admission charge puts the number of people
who want to attend at that price more in line with the
number of available seats.
The sing is in Memorial Church on Dec. 14 at 8
p.m. Tickets are available. Hallelujah.
Dear Bug Me,
How much must one donate to have a building
named after oneself? More than half? If Stanford
built a building without donated funds, would some
one be able to donate t5 or so and get their name on
the building because they are the only donor?
— Phil Anthropist
To paraphrase J. P. Morgan, if you have to ask you
can't afford it.
There are some "informal" guidelines to leaving a
"name gift," according to David Fulton, the director
of communications for the Office of Development.
Fulton said the cost of the building, the availability
of funds and the prospects that the Office of Develop
ment has to contribute those funds all play a part in
whether or not one of Stanford's buildings will be
named for a particular individual. However, he said
he could not remember a case in which the name of
the building did not come from the building's prin
cipal donor. ,
