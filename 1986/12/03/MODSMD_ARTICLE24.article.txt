## ACT stumbles with Shaw production 
### PETER MORGAN 
Given the chance to save either a
humble, honest man or a smug and
egotistical liar, whom would you
choose? This is the crux of George
Bernard Shaw's "The Doctor's Di
lemma," now playing at the American

Conservatory Theatre. Both men are
dying of tuberculosis, and the only
physician who has a cure, Dr. Henry
Ridgeon, can treat only one of them.
There's a twist to this seemingly
clear-cut choice, however, as the
honest man is poor and pitiful, but
also socially unbearable. The smug

liar, for his part, happens to be an ar
tistic genius whose work inspires
everyone who sees it. As Dr. Ridgeon
puts it, is it better to save the good
man who makes life unbearable or
the evil one who makes it beautiful?
There's one final twist to the doctor's
dilemma: What if you're in love with
the beautiful, virtuous wife of the
smug liar?
The real dilemma here, however,
is getting over the disappointment of
ACT's production of this play. It's not
Shaw's most brilliant script, or so the
experts proclaim, but it's certainly
playable. It presents a wonderful sa
tire of the medical profession, a few
concise moral questions and the
usual Shavian wit. The final act ends
abruptly, but, since the play is inter
esting for its ideas more than its ac
tion, the absence of a balanced end
ing isn't as bothersome as it could be.
Shaw presents his ideas and then
quickly lays down his pen.
It may sound as if I support the fas
hionable criticism that Shaw's plays
are all head and no heart, that his
plots are dull talk without any engag
ing action, that his characters have
only one opinion and no depth. And
if you see the ACT production, you'd
probably agree with this assessment.
Although I'm in the minority, I
believe that Shaw has as much heart
as any other playwright. It's the pain
in his heart that creates all his wit and
rhetoric about the world's ills, not
some detached intellect. Sadly, ACT
has misinterpreted Shaw by over
looking his hidden heart and trying
to create an obvious one in its place.
This means that the actors help the
allegedly dull, talky script by adding
extra physical gestures to their move
ments and "significant" emotional
tones to their lines. Nice idea in the
ory. In practice, though, it causes the
actors to rush over lines as quickly as
possible, move around without pur
pose, touch each other "mean
ingfully" and generally try to con

vince the audience that they're real
people. Maybe the actors themselves
just didn't believe in Shaw's charac
ters; all their "help" does more
damage than good.
It seems to me a little more trust in
words instead of bodies, in silence
rather than noise, and stillness rather
than motion would have created a
more engaging emotional reality for
the production. The two most fasci
nating moments in"The Doctor's Di
lemma" involved motionless people
using pauses to clearly formulate the
intention of their words. Sadly, these
were only brief moments from pass
ing characters.
Like ACT's "You Never Can Tell"
also by Shaw last year, the cast of this
Shaw production is mired in an act
ing style of mannerisms and vocal
gymnastics, attaining credibility only
rarely. And even these surface tech
niques seem shoddy, as the British
accents of the characters were
strangely Californian at times. Excep
tions to this were Drew Eshelman (in
his best work with the company yet)
and Tony Amendola (who kept his
body movement in line with his
humble character). The design ele
ments of the show were adequate,
but added little.
I'll confess to being a reviewer
who likes theater to be magical, not
just entertaining. I bring high expec
tations with me into the theatre, par
ticularly when seeing the classics by
Shakespeare, Moliere, Ibsen, Chek
hov, O'Neill, Beckett and Shaw. Per
haps that's the cause of my disap
pointment with ACT's show; I ex
pected too much. I can't recommend
the show, despite the availability of
student discount tickets (something
the Stanford community should take
advantage of with other ACT shows).
ACT began its season of "new leader
ship" admirably with "Sunday in the
Park with George." Sadly, it's taken a
step backward with "The Doctor's Di
lemma."

This seemingly mismatched couple is really a very happy duo, despite his
facial expression. He (Howard Swain) is an egotistic artist, while she
(Nancy Carlin) is his devoted wife in"The Doctor's Dilemma," playing at
the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco.
