## 
### 
Tomorrow and Friday nights will be

filmmakers; their films wili be shown
at the New Varsity Theatre in Palo Alto
and at the Roxie Cinema in San Fran
cisco, respectively. In a program enti
tled "Ordinary People/Extraordinary
Lives," four half-hour documentaries
will be shown, each one focusing on
an important social issue.
Each of the documentaries was
produced as a master's thesis project in
Stanford's graduate film program. The
program as a whole is presented by In-
Sync Film Projects, a group of indepen
dent filmmakers committed to making
social issue into documentaries.
The four award-winning films in the
program cover a wide range of topics.
Lauren Lazin's "The Flapper Story" ex

amines the "flapper" phenomenon of
the 19205, exploring that period from a
woman's viewpoint. "Silver Into Gold,"
produced by Lynn Mueller, tells the
story of two ordinary women who, in
middle age, overcome societal pres
sures and become prize-winning ath
letes. Wynn Hausser's "Sanctuary: A
Question of Conscience" provides a
historical look at the sanctuary move
ment and includes interviews with four
sanctuary workers who have helped
Central American refugees. The last
film may be the most provocative:
"Living With AIDS," by Lynn Mueller,
depicts the final months of a young San
Francisco man with AIDS and ad
dresses the issues faced by an increas
ing number of people as they come
into contact with the disease.
