# The 						Vicious life of 'Pistols' star
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Sid Vicious' life was highlighted by
such acts as being punched in the face
by fans after he spat on them, cutting
slogans on his chest with a razor blade,
injecting heroin, kicking people,
breaking things and stabbing his
girlfriend. As you might imagine, this
isn't particularly pleasant to watch, yet
director and co-writer Alex Cox has
brought Vicious' life story to the screen
in the movie "Sid and Nancy."
For the uninitiated, Vicious was a
member of the Sex Pistols, the first offi
cial punk group, the English band that
created a revolution in rock music.
Formed in 1975, they recorded only
one album (the celebrated "Never
Mind the Bollocks") and broke up
during a tour of America in 1977. Fol
lowing the split, Vicious went downhill
rapidly. He was accused of murdering
his American girlfriend Nancy Spun
gen in late '78 and died of a drug
overdose the following year.

The movie shows
that violence is not
fun to watch.

Now there is "Sid and Nancy," a look
at the relationship between Vicious
and Spungen and how it became
poisoned with drug abuse. The movie
is two hours of depressed, self
destructive people in a violent struggle
with themselves, each other and the
world in general. Their demise is pre
dictable from the very beginning,
when Vicious bangs his head against a
brick wall to please Spungen. After
this, the audience suffers through a se
ries of self-destructive acts, as the
couple spirals down an inescapable
hole. By the time the movie ends, you
feel like you've witnessed a horrible
auto accident on the highway.
Chloe Webb, who plays Spungen,
screams about three-fourths of her
lines and whines the remaining fourth.
I don't care how true to life Webb plays
her character; her Nancy Spungen
grates the nerves like a chainsaw, den
tist's drill or jackhammer, depending
on her mood. It's a relief when Vicious
temporarily leaves her to tour in
America.
Vicious is played by the talented En
glish actor Gary Oldman, who sticks
needles in his arms and kicks people
as convincingly as the real Vicious
might have done. Unfortunately, this
excellent performance is wasted on a
character who would make any actor
look bad. Vicious' violent actions are as
disturbing to watch as Spungen's voice
is to listen to.

Vicious does have some good mo
ments at first. Before he's hooked on
heroin, he shows a charming English
matter-of-factness. When Spungen
screams hysterically, "My mother
wouldn't send us any money — she
said we'd spend it on drugs!", Vicious
replies, "We would."
Sometimes his violent antics are
funny. A man enthusiastically offers Vi
cious Bruce Springsteen tickets, and
Sid kicks him. The rest of the time,
though, he's a gray-skinned addict
whose madness as a punk rocker
becomes the disturbing shivers and
shakes of a junkie.
Despite all the hype and action that
stirs up around him, there is little
more to Vicious than his addiction to
heroin and his girlfriend. His identity
as a musician springs from his
destructive behavior rather than from
any innate creativity. Take away his
razor blades, drugs and black leather
boots, and all that's left is a second-rate
musician.
What is more interesting about Vi
cious is that he, more than the other
members of the Sex Pistols, made such
an impact on American culture with his
mass following of punkers. The fact
that a violent, crazy drug-abuser can
become so popular says more about
the violent streak in our society than
the one in Vicious. This, I think, is what
interested director Cox and inspired
him to make the movie.
In "Repo Man," Cox's first movie, he
mocked the mass appeal of television
and our society's materialism. "Sid and
Nacy" makes Vicious the focal point of
our culture's bandwagon mentality.
Mass marketing has produced such dis
tasteful characters as Hulk Hogan,
Rambo and Mr. T. The only difference
between these figures and Vicious is
that he lived his violent character both
on and off-stage.
By portraying Vicious as a real char
acter, Cox makes us wonder how he
ever had a following at all. We realize
that his fame is the result of marketing,
like the hula-hoop or "The Preppy
Handbook." Cox shows this during a
Sex Pistols concert, where we see an
audience full of clean-cut teenagers
who probably went to the concert with
the same expectations of seeing an
animal in the zoo. They went to see Vi
cious a a crazy, cut himself or spray
paint his tongue. He was encouraged
to lead a violent lifestyle because his
violence amused people.
The movie shows that violence is not
amusing to watch, and the reality of Vi
cious' life makes us less willing to
watch the actions of other violent char
acters. We want to turn away from fig
ures like Vicious the same way we
don't want to see the victims of real
violence. But in the end, while Cox had
the right intentions, it's not worth suf
fering through this disturbing movie to
find his moral message.

isn't particularly pleasant to watch, yet
director and co-writer Alex Cox has
brought Vicious' life story to the screen
in the movie "Sid and Nancy."
For the uninitiated, Vicious was a
member of the Sex Pistols, the first offi
cial punk group, the English band that
created a revolution in rock music.
Formed in 1975, they recorded only
one album (the celebrated "Never
Mind the Bollocks") and broke up
during a tour of America in 1977. Fol
lowing the split, Vicious went downhill
rapidly. He was accused of murdering
his American girlfriend Nancy Spun
gen in late '78 and died of a drug
overdose the following year.

The movie shows
that violence is not
fun to watch.

Now there is "Sid and Nancy," a look
at the relationship between Vicious
and Spungen and how it became
poisoned with drug abuse. The movie
is two hours of depressed, self
destructive people in a violent struggle
with themselves, each other and the
world in general. Their demise is pre
dictable from the very beginning,
when Vicious bangs his head against a
brick wall to please Spungen. After
this, the audience suffers through a se
ries of self-destructive acts, as the
couple spirals down an inescapable
hole. By the time the movie ends, you
feel like you've witnessed a horrible
auto accident on the highway.
Chloe Webb, who plays Spungen,
screams about three-fourths of her
lines and whines the remaining fourth.
I don't care how true to life Webb plays
her character; her Nancy Spungen
grates the nerves like a chainsaw, den
tist's drill or jackhammer, depending
on her mood. It's a relief when Vicious
temporarily leaves her to tour in
America.
Vicious is played by the talented En
glish actor Gary Oldman, who sticks
needles in his arms and kicks people
as convincingly as the real Vicious
might have done. Unfortunately, this
excellent performance is wasted on a
character who would make any actor
look bad. Vicious' violent actions are as
disturbing to watch as Spungen's voice
is to listen to.

Vicious does have some good mo
ments at first. Before he's hooked on
heroin, he shows a charming English
matter-of-factness. When Spungen
screams hysterically, "My mother
wouldn't send us any money — she
said we'd spend it on drugs!", Vicious
replies, "We would."
Sometimes his violent antics are
funny. A man enthusiastically offers Vi
cious Bruce Springsteen tickets, and
Sid kicks him. The rest of the time,
though, he's a gray-skinned addict
whose madness as a punk rocker
becomes the disturbing shivers and
shakes of a junkie.
Despite all the hype and action that
stirs up around him, there is little
more to Vicious than his addiction to
heroin and his girlfriend. His identity
as a musician springs from his
destructive behavior rather than from
any innate creativity. Take away his
razor blades, drugs and black leather
boots, and all that's left is a second-rate
musician.
What is more interesting about Vi
cious is that he, more than the other
members of the Sex Pistols, made such
an impact on American culture with his
mass following of punkers. The fact
that a violent, crazy drug-abuser can
become so popular says more about
the violent streak in our society than
the one in Vicious. This, I think, is what
interested director Cox and inspired
him to make the movie.
In "Repo Man," Cox's first movie, he
mocked the mass appeal of television
and our society's materialism. "Sid and
Nacy" makes Vicious the focal point of
our culture's bandwagon mentality.
Mass marketing has produced such dis
tasteful characters as Hulk Hogan,
Rambo and Mr. T. The only difference
between these figures and Vicious is
that he lived his violent character both
on and off-stage.
By portraying Vicious as a real char
acter, Cox makes us wonder how he
ever had a following at all. We realize
that his fame is the result of marketing,
like the hula-hoop or "The Preppy
Handbook." Cox shows this during a
Sex Pistols concert, where we see an
audience full of clean-cut teenagers
who probably went to the concert with
the same expectations of seeing an
animal in the zoo. They went to see Vi
cious a a crazy, cut himself or spray
paint his tongue. He was encouraged
to lead a violent lifestyle because his
violence amused people.
The movie shows that violence is not
amusing to watch, and the reality of Vi
cious' life makes us less willing to
watch the actions of other violent char
acters. We want to turn away from fig
ures like Vicious the same way we
don't want to see the victims of real
violence. But in the end, while Cox had
the right intentions, it's not worth suf
fering through this disturbing movie to
find his moral message.
Sid Vicious' life was highlighted by
such acts as being punched in the face
by fans after he spat on them, cutting
slogans on his chest with a razor blade,
injecting heroin, kicking people,
breaking things and stabbing his
