# Irons, De Niro: men with a 'Mission'
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial Staff 
Going into "The Mission," I expected the type of
self-consciously serious, tasteful film that comes out
at this time of the year, the type of film that screams,
"Nominate me! Nominate me!" The advance publicity
made it sound like a standard case of Big Names tack
ling Big Issues, and the various plot summaries I'd
read certainly indicated that the movie had a busy po
litical agenda. I imagined all the issues touched upon
in the script lumbering their way on screen and col
liding into each other like massive sumo wrestlers:
imperialism, conflict between church and state, the
nature of dissent, liberation theology â€” oof!
A quick history lesson is in order. Set in the Argen
tina of 1750, "The Mission" takes place right after the
signing of the Treaty of Madrid between Spain and
Portugal. Spain is turning many of its South American
colonies over to Portugal; included among these
colonies are several Jesuit missions. This is bad news
for both the Jesuits and the native Guarani Indians of
Argentina, since under Spanish rule the missions
provided a haven for the Indians, a sanctuary where
no slave traders dared to come. But the Portuguese
are active slavers. Now that they're taking over, they

demand of the Vatican that the Jesuits abandon their
missions; this will enable the Portuguese to conquer
the Guarani Indians without even breathing hard.
Naturally this doesn't go down at all well with the
Jesuits. In particular it doesn't sit well with Father
Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) who, at great risk to himself,
has converted the Guarani to Christianity. Having
come to love the Indians, he can't bear to see them
turned over to slave traders, yet there's nothing else
he can do. AJesuit's first vow is to obey, and so Father
Gabriel must submit to the word of the papal emis
sary Altamirano (Ray McAnally).
This isn't the case with Father Mendoza (Robert De
Niro). A former mercenary and slave trader himself,
Mendoza knows exactly what kind of treatment the
Indians can expect at the hands of the European
slavers; he vows that it shall not come to pass. Gather
ing the more militant Guarani around him, he
prepares to fight the Portuguese, even if it means
renouncing his role in the Jesuit order.
Readers may be scratching their heads in bewil
derment, wondering if they want to grapple with
"The Mission" and its cumbersome historical frame
of reference. The movie is at times ponderous and
perhaps even self-congratulatory, but it's also an in

volving drama, the greatest film David Lean never
made. As the story moves along to its inevitable tragic
climax, it's hard not to get a bit weepy. And the movie
works very well as a study of its two central charac
ters, Fathers Gabriel and Mendoza.
I'm wildly biased here, since Irons and De Niro are
two of my favorite actors. But if any actors were ever
worth being biased about, it's Irons and De Niro.
They represent two very different acting styles: Irons,
the epitome of British reserve, is the supposed heir
to the Laurence Olivier/classical tradition, while De
Niro, all raw American energy, is famous for his use
of the "method" style of acting. The film's casting di
rector must have been pretty sharp, for as it turns out
each actor's style is perfect for his part.
With his haunted face and cracked voice, Irons
was born to play martyrs. He always looks so
tragic; someone should take him aside sometime and
tell him things are really going to be OK. But "The
Mission" is a welcome achievement for Irons. He's
stopped frittering his talent away on bad art movies
and G.Q. spreads and finally delivers the goods.
Looking more like an El Greco portrait than ever,
Irons as Father Gabriel is an observer; as in

movies in which he did little but look soulful, Irons has finally found a movie
worthy of his talents.
