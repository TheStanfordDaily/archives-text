# Irons, De Niro: men with a 'Mission'
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial Staff 
Going into "The Mission," I expected the type of
self-consciously serious, tasteful film that comes out
at this time of the year, the type of film that screams,
"Nominate me! Nominate me!" The advance publicity
made it sound like a standard case of Big Names tack
ling Big Issues, and the various plot summaries I'd
read certainly indicated that the movie had a busy po
litical agenda. I imagined all the issues touched upon
in the script lumbering their way on screen and col
liding into each other like massive sumo wrestlers:
imperialism, conflict between church and state, the
nature of dissent, liberation theology â€” oof!
A quick history lesson is in order. Set in the Argen
tina of 1750, "The Mission" takes place right after the
signing of the Treaty of Madrid between Spain and
Portugal. Spain is turning many of its South American
colonies over to Portugal; included among these
colonies are several Jesuit missions. This is bad news
for both the Jesuits and the native Guarani Indians of
Argentina, since under Spanish rule the missions
provided a haven for the Indians, a sanctuary where
no slave traders dared to come. But the Portuguese
are active slavers. Now that they're taking over, they

demand of the Vatican that the Jesuits abandon their
missions; this will enable the Portuguese to conquer
the Guarani Indians without even breathing hard.
Naturally this doesn't go down at all well with the
Jesuits. In particular it doesn't sit well with Father
Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) who, at great risk to himself,
has converted the Guarani to Christianity. Having
come to love the Indians, he can't bear to see them
turned over to slave traders, yet there's nothing else
he can do. AJesuit's first vow is to obey, and so Father
Gabriel must submit to the word of the papal emis
sary Altamirano (Ray McAnally).
This isn't the case with Father Mendoza (Robert De
Niro). A former mercenary and slave trader himself,
Mendoza knows exactly what kind of treatment the
Indians can expect at the hands of the European
slavers; he vows that it shall not come to pass. Gather
ing the more militant Guarani around him, he
prepares to fight the Portuguese, even if it means
renouncing his role in the Jesuit order.
Readers may be scratching their heads in bewil
derment, wondering if they want to grapple with
"The Mission" and its cumbersome historical frame
of reference. The movie is at times ponderous and
perhaps even self-congratulatory, but it's also an in

volving drama, the greatest film David Lean never
made. As the story moves along to its inevitable tragic
climax, it's hard not to get a bit weepy. And the movie
works very well as a study of its two central charac
ters, Fathers Gabriel and Mendoza.
I'm wildly biased here, since Irons and De Niro are
two of my favorite actors. But if any actors were ever
worth being biased about, it's Irons and De Niro.
They represent two very different acting styles: Irons,
the epitome of British reserve, is the supposed heir
to the Laurence Olivier/classical tradition, while De
Niro, all raw American energy, is famous for his use
of the "method" style of acting. The film's casting di
rector must have been pretty sharp, for as it turns out
each actor's style is perfect for his part.
With his haunted face and cracked voice, Irons
was born to play martyrs. He always looks so
tragic; someone should take him aside sometime and
tell him things are really going to be OK. But "The
Mission" is a welcome achievement for Irons. He's
stopped frittering his talent away on bad art movies
and G.Q. spreads and finally delivers the goods.
Looking more like an El Greco portrait than ever,
Irons as Father Gabriel is an observer; as in

movies in which he did little but look soulful, Irons has finally found a movie
worthy of his talents.
"Brideshead Revisited" he lets his eyes
do all the work for him. His two best
scenes are when he tells Mendoza that
he doesn't want to live in a world
where might is right, and when, numb
with helplessness, he has to tell the In
dians that the Pope requires them to
leave the mission.
1 had questioned the very notion of
De Niro as an 18th-century priest
before seeing the movie; I always think
of De Niro as a sort of bipedal exten
sion of New York City. 1 chortled at
first, when De Niro is required to say
lines like "So me you do not love," but
he pulls off the role. When he first ap
pears as a rugged slave trader, Men
doza seems like the essence of power
contained in one man's frame. Later,
after his conversion to the Jesuit order,
there's still a tightness about him, that
unique potential for violence that
seems to underline all of De Niro's
best performances.
Most of the other performances are
quite good as well, especially McAnally
as the papal emissary Altamirano.
McAnally makes Altamirano a subtle,
finely shaded character. The same can
not be said of Ronald Pickup as Hontar,
the Portuguese minister out to destroy
the Jesuit missions. Hontar is the most
embarrassing thing about "The Mis
sion," but in fairness to Pickup, it's
writer Robert Bolt's fault. The script
makes Hontar a hissing, spitting
caricature of villainy; I kept expecting
Indiana Jones to step in and knock
some sense into him.
Which brings up the question, just
how successful is "The Mission" in
dealing with its various weighty
themes? Director Roland Joffe, of "The
Killing Fields" fame, has created a vis
ual spectacle, but he and writer Bolt
("A Man For All Seasons," "Lawrence of
Arabia") at times veer too much in the
direction of Noble Savages versus Evil
White Men, particularly with the
aforementioned Portuguese minister.

Fortunately the more complex figure
of Altamirano is on hand to lend some
maturity to the proceedings.
Further, the movie avoids easy
answers in showing that neither
Gabriel's Gandhi-like resistance nor
Mendoza's guerrilla tactics are able to
stop the Portuguese army. The eventual
massacre of the Guarani Indians is jus

tified as an unavoidable political neces
sity, an excuse familiar to 20th-century
ears. We know now what Gabriel and
Mendoza discover for the first time,
that the road to hell is paved in the
name of political expediency.
One last tip of the hat is due to En
nio Morricone, who's responsible for
the movie's soundtrack.
