						look back at Cary Grant

Cary Grant died this weekend at the age of 82, marking
the passing of one of Hollywoood's greatest actors.
He was born Archibald Leach in 1904, the son of
working-class parents. While still a schoolboy, he left his
family and background behind and joined an acrobatic
troupe. This was the first step in the long process which,
in a marvelously Gatsby-like transformation, turned the
young boy from the lower classes into a romantic idol,
an aristocratic icon of urbanity.
When writing about Grant, an old Jules Feiffer cartoon
comes to mind, in which a man experiences a perfect
day because everyone is somehow lulled into thinking
he's Cary Grant. He himself becomes euphoric because
he starts to believe it, too.
That cartoon neatly sums up the essential appeal of
Grant's screen persona. Grant was the model of un
ruffled cool; he showed that the proper response to any
situation, no matter how alarming, was a raised eyebrow.
Through an inimitable combination of understatement,
good-natured humor and larger-than-life qualities, he
epitomized and perfected the role of the movie star.
In a famous essay, Pauline Kael called him "The Man
from Dream City," and rightly so. Grant's film personality
was irresistible to women, to men, to Grant himself. "I
pretended to be somebody I wanted to be and I finally
became that person," he once said. "Or he became me.
Or we met at some point. It's a relationship." He seems
to have been rather wittily self-effacing in private, unen
cumbered by the pretensions that characterize many
stars.
Grant appeared in 72 films; one could spend hours
luxuriating in the memories of his classic scenes. With
Katharine Hepburn as his co-star, he appeared in
"Bringing Up Baby" (1938), the definitive screwball com
edy. The following year found him playing an exuberant
young British army officer in the riotous "Gunga Din," a
film which survives as half high adventure, half farce.
For my money, though, it was in his work with Sir
Alfred Hitchcock that Grant revved up to full power.
"Suspicion," "Notorious," "To Catch A Thief' and "North
By Northwest" â€” these four films alone would ensure
Grant a major place in the Hollywood pantheon.
Hitchcock was well aware of Grant's charisma and cast
him in roles that made full use of, or played upon, his
legendary charm.

One of the most memorable scenes in the Grant-
Hitchcock films comes in "North By Northwest," when
Grant, a hunted man, finds himself trapped in an art auc
tion with his pursuers covering the exits. It's one of those
wonderfully improbable moments that only Hitchcock
could get away with: Grant decides the only way to
escape safely is to get thrown out of the auction, and so,
upon hearing the price of a sculpture, yells out, "What?
For that piece of chromo?" The humor comes from
seeing Grant suddenly turned into a vulgarian.
And then, of course, there is "Notorious," that dark
gem in the Hitchcock crown. A perfect movie, it features
an exquisite sexual tension between Grant and his co
star Ingrid Bergman, neither of whom were ever better.
It would be easy to go on. Sadly, the Man from Dream
City is no longer with us. Grant had been retired for
nearly 20 years; even so, his death is a real loss. The sil
ver screen will shine a little less brightly without him.
