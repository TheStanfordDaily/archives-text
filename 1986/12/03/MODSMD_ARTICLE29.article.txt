## Stanford falls at SJS; poor shooting costly 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
SAN JOSE — A cold start and a colder finish
were too much to overcome for Stanford last
night, as the Cardinal fell 72-63 to San Jose
State before an intimate gathering of 1,832 in
San Jose's tiny Civic Auditorium.
The loss dropped the Cardinal's record to
1-2, while the Spartans evened their mark at 1-
1.
Stanford shot just 23 percent from the floor
in the first half, then scored just one field goal
in the game's final 7:32 before Terry Taylor
and Todd Lichti hit meaningless three
pointers in the closing seconds.
San Jose State opened the game in a 2-3
zone, using lightning-quick guards Rodney
Scott and Bobby Evans to sag inside on Stan
ford's big men and pop out to harass the
Cardinal's outside shooters.
The strategy worked, as Stanford was
unable to get the ball inside or to loosen up
the Spartans' zone by hitting the outside shot.
"The important thing was not to let Howard
Wright kill us inside and not to let Todd Lichti
kill us outside and with his drives," San Jose
State Coach Bill Berry said.
"They were doing a tremendous job. Every
time we turned around (inside), there were at
least two players around us, and it was hard
not to turn it over," said Wright, who was
forced into six miscues.
Luckily for the Cardinal, the Spartans were
not exactly burning the cords, either. San Jose
State shot 44 percent for the half.
Forward Reggie Owens made two plays
within one minute that typified the half. First,
he threw up a hideous looking foul shot that
banked in. Then on a breakaway, he slammed
a dunk attempt off the back rim and watched
it carom back past the top of the key.
The Spartans, however, were able to pull
ahead slowly behind 11 points from forward
George Puou and eight from Owens to take a
30-20 halftime lead.
"We didn't establish any inside game," Stan

ford Coach Mike Montgomery' said. "We just
were not very patient. We were very stand
aroundish in the first half."
The Stanford team that came out for the
second half resembled the impressive squad
that played in Richmond, Va., last weekend
more than the sluggish one that played the
first half last night. The Cardinal quickly took
off on a 13-2 run that put it ahead 33-32 with
13:51 to play.
"We got more aggressive, which got us on
the move a little bit," Montgomery said.
Wright served notice immediately that the
Cardinal had come to play in the final 20
minutes. On Stanford's first possession, he
scored on a layup. He then powered in an
other inside shot while drawing a foul from
Puou, whom he pointed and jawed at on his
way to the foul line.
"I just got fed up with it," Wright said. "In
the first half, I felt there were some calls that
should have been made. But in the second
half I just decided to go strong to the basket."
And for the first 13 minutes of the half, it
was very different. Behind the scoring of
Lichti, who led Stanford with 23 points, and
the rebounding of forward Greg Butler, who
finished with a team-high 11 boards, the Card
inal moved out to a 50-44 lead.
It was about then that Berry made the move
that may have turned the tide back to San Jose
State. He took the Spartans out of their zone
and into a tight man-to-man, with Scott, Evans
and sixth man Anthony Perry putting suffocat
ing pressure on the Stanford guards.
"We wanted to see if we could tire out their
guards," Berry said. "We wanted to give them
a different look defensively. They were start
ing to find the holes in our zone."
"The man hurt them a lot," Perry said.
"We're much quicker than them, and they
didn't move their feet that well."
Perry also hurt Stanford down the stretch,
scoring all nine of his points in a five-minute
stretch that left San Jose State with a 58-54
lead with 2:43 left.
The game then became a free-throw

shooting contest, and the Spartans won it
decisively. While Stanford hit 3-of-6, San Jose
State buried 14 in a row from the line to ice
the victory.
"You've got to shoot them under pressure,
and we did," Berry said.
"Beating a Pac-10 team means a lot," Scott
said. "It's a great first win for us."
Card notes
The low overall statistics obscured two fine
shooting performances. Stanford's Taylor went 4-
for-7 from three-point range and scored 15 points,
while the Spartans' Evans hit 3-of-4 from the field
and all 10 of his free throws for a team-high 16.
The officials were fairly whistle-happy last night,
calling 55 fouls. After a close call in the second half
gave him his fourth foul, Lichti was hit with a techni
cal as well. "The guy (who called the foul) had his
back to me, and I was yelling at hirti," Lichti said.
"Then another ref came over and called a T on me.
It was unfortunate, and hopefully it won't happen
again. It wasn't very smart on my part."
