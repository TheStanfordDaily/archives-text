# Expert says arms treaty cheating is exaggerated
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Allegations of cheating by both the
United States and the Soviet Union on
existing arms treaties between the two
superpowers "don't stand up to
scrutiny" and are causing a
"compliance crisis," according to
Gloria Duffy, a fellow at the Center for
International Security and Arms Con
trol here.
"The charges (of non-compliance)
are greatly exaggerated," said Duffy at
a presentation in Terman Auditorium
last night focusing on the super
powers' compliance record with nu
clear arms treaties. "Most of the
charges involve gray areas. There are
almost no black-and-white cases" of

treaty violations by either the United
States or the Soviets, she said.
Since 1983, the United States has
made an increasing number of charges
of Soviet cheating, now totaling 18 spe
cific allegations, according to Duffy.
The Soviets have retaliated with 22
charges of U.S. cheating. This lack of
trust by the two countries over past
treaties seriously curtails the possibili
ties of striking new arms agreements in
the near future, she said.
The Reagan administration's official
position is that the United States can
not continue to abide by older arms
agreements such as the second strate
gic arms limitation treaty (SALT II) be
cause of the Soviet Union's alleged
breaches in the treaty provisions, she
said.

Duffy cited the administration's line
of reasoning as one of the major fac
tors behind the administration's viola
tion of the unratified SALT II treaty
Friday. By adding one more B-52
bomber to the U.S. Air Force, the
United States has now surpassed the
limits of the treaty by one system. By
breaking the limits imposed by SALT 11,
the United States has become the first
country ever to "formally, publically
repudiate a nuclear arms control
treaty," she said.
Despite the numerous allegations
made by the two superpowers,
however, Duffy said the general ten
dency has been toward compliance by
both sides. Most of the current dis
crepancies are results of ambiguous
data, uncertain evidence or vague
treaty provisions, she said.
The one clear Soviet violation was
the construction of a large radar instal
lation in Siberia that could be used as
part of a defensive system, a use
prohibited by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missle Treaty, she said.
As a result of ambiguous treaty wor
ding, the Soviet Union uses "marginal
compliance" â€” compliance which is
based on the USSR's interpretation of
the treaties, according to Duffy.
The United States has made "no ab
solutely clear" treaty violations at this
point, she said, noting that the deploy
ment of the B-52 bomber violated only
the SALT II agreement, which was
never ratified by Congress.
Within three years, however, tests of
the President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative program could vio
late the ABM treaty, according to Duffy.
She added modernization of U.S. radar
installations in Greenland and England
is also a growing cause of concern.
Duffy criticized the Reagan adminis
tration's "dismantling of past achieve
ments" in arms control treaties. She
said the administration has rejected the
traditional view that the United States
and the Soviet Union should
renegotiate treaties in order to take ac
count of new technology.
