# Smith Player of the Year; Rush 1st team All Pac-10
## 
### CHRIS CRADER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team came up with a
win yesterday despite not playing a match. The All-Pacific 10
Conference teams were announced, and the Cardinal
placed two players each on the first and second teams.
The selections were highlighted by the choice of Teresa
Smith as the Pac-10 Player of the Year. Joining her on the
first team was setter Wendi Rush, while Barbra Fontana and
Nancy Reno were choosen for the second team.
These results are impressive considering that the Card
inal plays in the Pac-10, generally regarded as the second
toughest volleyball conference in the country, following
only the Pacific Coast Athletic Association. Six representa
tives from each of the two conferences qualified for the
NCAA tournament, more than from any other league. This
shows teams only in the middle of the standings in the two
conferences are still among the best in the country.
Smith, a junior outside hitter from Playa Del Rey, was
rather surprised by the result. "1 didn't really think about it
at all this year," she said.
She must not have, because she was certainly one of the
front-runners. Smith was the only player to be named con
ference Player of the Week twice this year, and she posted
some impressive statistics. Smith had a .354 hitting
percentage with 495 kills and 82 service aces, all team highs.
She totaled 339 digs, second on the team, and was third in
blocks with 81. She was also the most consistent passer on
the team this year.
When asked about her improvement from last year, Smith
said, "I got a lot of individual attention during the off
season. I trained really hard, and (playing in) the Olympic
Festival helped my confidence a lot."

"1 am preparing myself before the game better," she
added. "I'm thinking about our opponents more."
Rush, a junior setter, was third on the team in digs with
338 and was fourth in blocks with 73- Rush finished the reg
ular season with 12.31 assists per game, third in the Pac-10,
and was second on the team in service aces with 31.
In addition to her fine setting and defense, Rush also pro
vided offense at key times. She had a hitting percentage of
.342, second on the team, and used the dump to get many
side-outs in crucial situations.
Stanford's two second-team representatives also posted
impressive statistics. Fontana, a senior outside hitter, led the
team in digs with 398 and was second in kills with 385. The
team co-captain is also known as an excellent passer and a
tough server.
Reno, the junior middle blocker, was second on the team
in blocks with 114 and third in aces (28) and kills (349).
Reno also recorded 228 digs, the fourth best total on the
team.
The players joining Smith and Rush on the first team are
Lisa Ettesvold, Ann Boyer and Lori Zeno, all from UCLA, and
Tammy Webb from Arizona State.
On the second team were Fontana, Reno, Teri Kramer
and Michele Krebsbach, both from Oregon, Regina Stahl
from Arizona State and Leslie Brewer from UCLA.
In other awards announced simultaneously, Debbie
Brown of Arizona State was Coach of the Year and
Krebsbach was Freshman of the Year.
Smith continues a tradition of Stanford conference award
winners. Kim Oden was West Coast Athletic Association
Most Valuable Player in 1983 and 1984, and when the Card
inal switched to the Pac-West conference last year, Oden
was again league MVP.
