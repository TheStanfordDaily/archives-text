# University of Sydney soccer meets Stanford in exhibition

### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Goodday mate. And you thought the soccer season
was over.
Well you were wrong. Perhaps the most interest
ing confrontation of the season is on tap for today.
The University of Sydney, currently touring the
United States, is in the Bay Area to take on the Stan
ford men's soccer team at 2:15 p.m. on Maloney
Field.
Stanford ended its official season three weeks ago
with a 3-2 loss to U.S. International University. It was
a forgettable end to a disappointing 6-11-4 season.
"It seemed like we were going to play really hard
and salvage something for the season," sophomore
fullback Luke Garrot said.'We thought we'd play
well, and it was a nightmare. The killer attitude right
from the start of the game has been missing. It's very
hard to tell with this team what's going to happen to
morrow.
We'd get two goals down and lose concentration.
Then we'd have a really hard time closing down our
marks. One breaks down and someone has to leave
their man to go to the ball. That leaves someone un
marked. USIU scored their goals that way," he added.
The Cardinal has had plenty of time to relax after a
season-ending schedule that saw it play four games
in six days. The past three weeks have been kick-back
time for the players.
' Practices have been three times a week. Thev've

been very light and refreshing. They've been good
for us, since we didn't finish so well. Everyone has
been in good spirits. It's fun going to practice again,
and now the season is going to end," Garrott said.
The Aussies, unlike Stanford students, have
finished finals, and this jaunt through the United
States is like an extended vacation. From all accounts,
the Americans have been treating them very well in
their travels.
"We played two games against Hawaii in Honolulu
and won one 2-1 and drew the other 3-3 Then after
that we went to San Luis Obispo and played Califor
nia Polytechnical school. We lost 3-0, but we had a
great time there and they looked after us well," Syd
ney right midfielder Lachlan Barker said.
Barker is a second-year chemistry major at Sydney
â€” and the social officer for the team. You see, in
Australia, all the university clubs get a subsidy from
the school, and then they're on their own.
They have a manager, a secretary, a treasurer
Wait, you say, what the heck is a social officer?
"I just make sure everyone gets extremely social
and chases the women and such," Barker said.
Apparently, the hosts here at the Farm have been
rather good to the Aussies as well. We went to the
Stanford Pub Monday night. We watched the football
game and had a teriffic time of it. We slept in the
wrong dorm last night because we couldn't find the
one we were supposed to be in,' Barker said.
"It's a great campus. We spent all day Monday
touring around. If the post-game party is as good as

the way we've been treated so far, it's going to be
quite a blowout."
In fact, the Aussies are so independent they didn't
even bring their coach along.
"The captain of our team is John Demappia, and
he's coaching us right now. We don't have a full-time
coach like you do in America. Everyone likes to play,
including the coach, and he wasn't one of the 16 who
made the trip," left wing Anthony Lewis said.
Sydney's leading scorer is the team manager, Keith
Tuffley. He's the right fullback, a fact that may give
you an idea of the Aussies' style of play.
"We play a very boisterous type of game. Hustling
the ball all the time and a guy breathing down his
throat all the time," Barker said
"We play solidy and fairly. It's a fast, bustling style.
Everyone is an attacker," added Lewis.
Everyone on the Australian club will play. The 16
who made the trip will rotate in and out, giving
everyone a lot of game time. "You have to give every
one a go. The boys are relaxed and looking forward
to the match," Barker said.
Sydney was quite successful in its season this past
winter, which is summer here. The team finished
second in its inter varsity competetion, which is a
week-long tournament that brings together all the
varsity clubs around the nation. Much of the
remainder of the club's season is comprised of com
petitions organized with local club teams near the

Sophomore fullback Chris Illick will be among those in action for the Stan
ford men's soccer team today as the squad takes on the University of Sydney
at Maloney Field. The Cardinal will rely on youth in the match, with only
one senior, Jim Cole, in action against the Aussies.
Stanford Coach Sam Koch is not
taking Sydney lightly by any means.
Stanford lost to Cal-Poly SLO 4-1 ear
lier this season, and Cal Poly s match
with Sydney was closer than the 3-0
score may indicate.
"They're gonna be tough. They're
like an English team. When the game
starts, they're ready to play. They'll
definitely give us a run for our
money," Koch said.
Stanford will have the services of
only one senior, Jim Cole. The Card
inal will be as fit as it has all season
after the three-week layoff. Mike Moss
mer, Chris Porch, Jerry Maldonado and
Garrott all are ready to play, though
Mossmer is still nursing a groin injury.
Chris Dechet may play sparingly.
"You'll see a lot of youngsters. Chris
Seiple and Jeff Rona will see a lot of
playing time. The key for us is to come
out strong at the start. Defensively we
will work on our marking and closing
them down sooner, and offensively we
hope to move the ball better in and
out. If we do it, I'll be very pleased,"
Koch said.
