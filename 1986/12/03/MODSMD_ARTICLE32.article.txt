# Frustration, anger and intensity
## 
### 
Some years ago, drifting back into the days of
K.C. & the Sunshine Band, Cheetos and Wacky-
Packs, I deliberately dropped a large cement
block on my sister's foot. I didn't really mean to
inflict serious pain. It was kind of a pre-pubescent
experiment on gravity and its effect on heavy ob
jects.

As I hypothesized, the object fell downward
most noticeably. My sister, meanwhile, did not ap
preciate my creative analysis of acceleration. In
stead of thanking me for my physics contribution,
she responded in turn by striking me with a
whiffle ball bat.
Fortunately, seconds before someone lost an
eye, my mother interrupted the turbulence and
reprimanded us both for our display of hostility.

Before long, without fanfare, notice or even ex
tended invitation, Nietzsche entered the room,
hurling my mother aside while handing us Sugar
Daddies — the lollipop of the 70s.
"Keep up the good work," he said softly.
"Never internalize anything, my children — just
say no." He paced the room, his hands wildly ges
ticulating. "Just say no to internalization," he
reiterated. "Otis Wilson never does, neither
should you."
He laughed demonically and lunged toward
my stuffed turtle, planting a left forearm in the
nape of its neck. "You see," he screamed. "It's that
easy."
He parted with these words. I sat bewildered.
Non sequiturs ran through my head. Is Otis Wil
son my sister? Is Nietzsche a middle linebacker?
Did Scooby really eat his snacks?
These thoughts and others synapsed through
out my tiny skull. Was Nietzsche correct in rhap
sodizing non-internalization or was he just an un
coordinated nihilist who merely envies late hits?
Well, Nietzsche's words had some positive
merit in sports, 1 surmised. Regardless of the
sport, much of its particular worth lies in the
emotion it generates for fan and participant alike.
Fans love to see intensity, anger and frustration.

Players and managers often provide most wil
lingly, sometimes excessively, a la Chicago's Otis
Wilson and Green Bay's Charles Martin.
In baseball, Earl Weaver is blessed with
Nietzsche's spirit. In one incident, after being
thrown out in the first game of a doubleheader.
Weaver questioned the validity of the umpire's ac
tion and his mental state while exchanging
scorecards at home for the second game. The
same umpire, Ron Luciano, ejected Weaver once
more before a ball was even thrown.
Billy Martin, former manager of many teams,
enjoyed arguing, fighting and swearing in gen
eral. In his spare time, he relished pummeling
marshmallow salesmen.
The National Hockey League has its share of
oven belligerence. At times, referees find them
selves wrestling with difficult addition and sub
traction problems: What do you get when you add
a game misconduct to a misconduct and a five
minute spearing, minus two minutes of cross
checking? Courses are now being offered in
"penalty minute dot-product strategies."
In one game between the Minnesota North
Stars and the Chicago Black Hawks, two players
were hauled off to the penalty box for fighting
and other dirty little deeds. As the officials seated

their guests, who were separated by 10 yards of
scoring table, the Black Hawk leaped onto the
scorer's table and began hobbling after the North
Star, sending Cokes, notepads and seated officials
flying in various directions.
The on-ice officials jumped into the penalty
box and tackled the skate-dancer. Five to 10
minutes elapsed before the Black Hawk player
could be restrained and escorted out of the arena.
Then there's tennis. Hie Nastase, Jimmy Con
nors and John McEnroe are all hall of fame
Nietzsche material. The tantrum triumvirate has
thrilled many with its soul-searching diatribes
about poor officiating and poor play.
Finally, how about football, a game where
anger and frustration may lead to the aforemen
tioned late and unjust hits? For every cheap
shotter like Otis Wilson, there are fair and just hit
ters like Mike Singletary, Kenny Easley, Ronnie
Lott and, dare I say it, Dick Butkus of Bears fame.
Butkus epitomized football intensity at its best.
He played mean, hungry and determined. He
worshiped Nietzsche's words. Said former Rams
great Deacon Jones, "Butkus didn't want to put
people in the hospital, he wanted to put them in
the cemetery."
Nietzsche scares me.

my stuffed turtle, planting a left forearm in the
nape of its neck. "You see," he screamed. "It's that
easy."
He parted with these words. I sat bewildered.
Non sequiturs ran through my head. Is Otis Wil
son my sister? Is Nietzsche a middle linebacker?
Did Scooby really eat his snacks?
These thoughts and others synapsed through
out my tiny skull. Was Nietzsche correct in rhap
sodizing non-internalization or was he just an un
coordinated nihilist who merely envies late hits?
Well, Nietzsche's words had some positive
merit in sports, 1 surmised. Regardless of the
sport, much of its particular worth lies in the
emotion it generates for fan and participant alike.
Fans love to see intensity, anger and frustration.

Players and managers often provide most wil
lingly, sometimes excessively, a la Chicago's Otis
Wilson and Green Bay's Charles Martin.
In baseball, Earl Weaver is blessed with
Nietzsche's spirit. In one incident, after being
thrown out in the first game of a doubleheader.
Weaver questioned the validity of the umpire's ac
tion and his mental state while exchanging
scorecards at home for the second game. The
same umpire, Ron Luciano, ejected Weaver once
more before a ball was even thrown.
Billy Martin, former manager of many teams,
enjoyed arguing, fighting and swearing in gen
eral. In his spare time, he relished pummeling
marshmallow salesmen.
The National Hockey League has its share of
oven belligerence. At times, referees find them
selves wrestling with difficult addition and sub
traction problems: What do you get when you add
a game misconduct to a misconduct and a five
minute spearing, minus two minutes of cross
checking? Courses are now being offered in
"penalty minute dot-product strategies."
In one game between the Minnesota North
Stars and the Chicago Black Hawks, two players
were hauled off to the penalty box for fighting
and other dirty little deeds. As the officials seated

their guests, who were separated by 10 yards of
scoring table, the Black Hawk leaped onto the
scorer's table and began hobbling after the North
Star, sending Cokes, notepads and seated officials
flying in various directions.
The on-ice officials jumped into the penalty
box and tackled the skate-dancer. Five to 10
minutes elapsed before the Black Hawk player
could be restrained and escorted out of the arena.
Then there's tennis. Hie Nastase, Jimmy Con
nors and John McEnroe are all hall of fame
Nietzsche material. The tantrum triumvirate has
thrilled many with its soul-searching diatribes
about poor officiating and poor play.
Finally, how about football, a game where
anger and frustration may lead to the aforemen
tioned late and unjust hits? For every cheap
shotter like Otis Wilson, there are fair and just hit
ters like Mike Singletary, Kenny Easley, Ronnie
Lott and, dare I say it, Dick Butkus of Bears fame.
Butkus epitomized football intensity at its best.
He played mean, hungry and determined. He
worshiped Nietzsche's words. Said former Rams
great Deacon Jones, "Butkus didn't want to put
people in the hospital, he wanted to put them in
the cemetery."
Nietzsche scares me.
