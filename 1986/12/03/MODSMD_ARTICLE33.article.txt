# Band tells of successful adventure to the Far East
## 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
Stanford Coach Jack Elway, com
menting on the Band's seats as well as
its performance at the Coca Cola Bowl
last weekend, said that the Band could
stand behind the football team any
time.
After a month of controversy, the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band headed for Japan,
where, as requested by the game's
Japanese organizers, it spelled out
such inoffensive words as Coca Cola,
JAL (Japanese Air Line) and the initials
of the Japanese broadcasting network.
"I think it was a lot of fun for the
Band as a whole," said Band Manager
Jeff Stevens.
Band members were greatly im
pressed with the hospitality of the
Japanese peeople.
"It was just phenomenal," said Assis
tant Manager Todd Olson, adding that
total strangers would treat Band mem
bers to an expensive dinner.
"I thought that they (the Japanese
people) would be not quite as outgo
ing as they were," said Dollie Lisa Lar
ragoite. "I was suprised that they were
really friendly. They bent over back
wards for us."
"It's really hard to be deaf, dumb
and blind," Band member Chris
Schroeder said regarding the language
barrier. "Even with that, the people
themselves were wonderful.
"It's just fascinating to me how

people can live that close together, in
such a huge city, without some of the
problems we have in America,"
Schroeder said. He added that there is
very little crime in Japan and that
people feel safe on the street and do
not even lock their bicycles.
The Band arrived in Tokyo last
Thursday afternoon. It rehearsed all
day Friday and Saturday. At night. Band
members were free to explore Tokyo
night life.
Saturday night the Band played a
concert and on Sunday it played — but
did not actually march — at the Coca
Cola Bowl. On Monday it was loaded
onto buses and taken to see Japan's Mt.
Fuji.
Before leaving, Band members were
required to attend a one-hour seminar
on Japanese culture and customs. As a
result, Olson said, "We knew how to
have a good time in Tokyo without of
fending anyone. We were actually
quite well received."
According to Band members, the
highlight of the trip seemed to have
been the football game itself.
"It was great because the team won,"
said Stevens."The crowd was just
amazing. They were completely
captive."
"(The Japanese fans) were just out of
control. They would do anything you
asked them to," Olson said. He ex
plained that the crowd would wave
their pompons on cue whenever the
Dollies held up a sign and that, at one
point, they formed a wave that lasted

for 10 to 15 minutes.
The Band was very well received at
the game, and at the end both Band
members and football players were
asked to sign autographs. Some were
given gifts.
"It was really neat to see a crowd
that was so excited about what we
were doing," said Stevens.
"It (the whole Japan trip) was worth
it just to see how happy we made
pet >ple at that game," said Larragoite.
Larragoite and the four other
Dollies, in addition to last year's
Dollies, performed with the Band and
also appeared on a Japanese talkshow
and at VIF cocktail parties.
The Band's unique style was high
lighted in contrast to the Arizona band,
with which it rehearsed and per
formed throughout the week.
"The Arizona band was a crackup,"
said Drum Major Brian Pike. "We
referred to them as repressed."
Pike added that although the Arizona
band marched with precision, the Stan
ford Band "oozed" in and out of
formations."They (the Arizona band)
didn't think much of our style," Pike
said.
"They certainly didn't have as much
fun as we did. They were out there to
put on a show and march ... but they
weren't having much fun," said Olson.
There were some problems with the
trip, however.
"A free trip to Tokyo has its draw
backs. They (the Japanese manage
ment) took advantage of the fact, and

we were pimped," said Pike.
Practicing four songs for eight
hours, waiting many long hours for
meetings that were eventually can
celled and continual show changes
were among the frustrations Stevens
cited. "We did a lot of running around
for no reason and a lot of sitting."

There was "a lot of 'hurry up and
wait' on this trip," added Schroeder.
Whatever the frustration that was at
tributed to the Japanese management,
the plane flight to Japan was not as bad
as was feared. The entire back cabin of
the plane, where the Band sat, broke
out into a pillow fight somewhere over

the Pacific Ocean.
"The best part about it was that the
stewardesses were laughing, and a
couple of them even threw pillows
too," Schroeder said.
Overall, Schroeder said, "It was kind
of fun to wake up in the morning and
realize it was still yesterday."

The Band returned from the Orient with a large dose of jet lag and a larger collection of stories about their ad
ventures in Tokyo, not all of which were about the Japanese. Band members found their Arizona peers just as
perplexing as the citizens of their host country.

Whatever the frustration that was at
tributed to the Japanese management,
the plane flight to Japan was not as bad
as was feared. The entire back cabin of
the plane, where the Band sat, broke
out into a pillow fight somewhere over

the Pacific Ocean.
"The best part about it was that the
stewardesses were laughing, and a
couple of them even threw pillows
too," Schroeder said.
Overall, Schroeder said, "It was kind
of fun to wake up in the morning and
realize it was still yesterday."

The Band returned from the Orient with a large dose of jet lag and a larger collection of stories about their ad
ventures in Tokyo, not all of which were about the Japanese. Band members found their Arizona peers just as
perplexing as the citizens of their host country.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway, com
menting on the Band's seats as well as
its performance at the Coca Cola Bowl
last weekend, said that the Band could
stand behind the football team any
time.
After a month of controversy, the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band headed for Japan,
where, as requested by the game's
Japanese organizers, it spelled out
such inoffensive words as Coca Cola,
JAL (Japanese Air Line) and the initials
of the Japanese broadcasting network.
"I think it was a lot of fun for the
Band as a whole," said Band Manager
Jeff Stevens.
Band members were greatly im
pressed with the hospitality of the
Japanese peeople.
"It was just phenomenal," said Assis
tant Manager Todd Olson, adding that
total strangers would treat Band mem
bers to an expensive dinner.
"I thought that they (the Japanese
people) would be not quite as outgo
ing as they were," said Dollie Lisa Lar
ragoite. "I was suprised that they were
really friendly. They bent over back
wards for us."
"It's really hard to be deaf, dumb
and blind," Band member Chris
Schroeder said regarding the language
barrier. "Even with that, the people
themselves were wonderful.
"It's just fascinating to me how

people can live that close together, in
such a huge city, without some of the
problems we have in America,"
Schroeder said. He added that there is
very little crime in Japan and that
people feel safe on the street and do
not even lock their bicycles.
The Band arrived in Tokyo last
Thursday afternoon. It rehearsed all
day Friday and Saturday. At night. Band
members were free to explore Tokyo
night life.
Saturday night the Band played a
concert and on Sunday it played — but
did not actually march — at the Coca
Cola Bowl. On Monday it was loaded
onto buses and taken to see Japan's Mt.
Fuji.
Before leaving, Band members were
required to attend a one-hour seminar
on Japanese culture and customs. As a
result, Olson said, "We knew how to
have a good time in Tokyo without of
fending anyone. We were actually
quite well received."
According to Band members, the
highlight of the trip seemed to have
been the football game itself.
"It was great because the team won,"
said Stevens."The crowd was just
amazing. They were completely
captive."
"(The Japanese fans) were just out of
control. They would do anything you
asked them to," Olson said. He ex
plained that the crowd would wave
their pompons on cue whenever the
Dollies held up a sign and that, at one
point, they formed a wave that lasted

for 10 to 15 minutes.
The Band was very well received at
the game, and at the end both Band
members and football players were
asked to sign autographs. Some were
given gifts.
"It was really neat to see a crowd
that was so excited about what we
were doing," said Stevens.
"It (the whole Japan trip) was worth
it just to see how happy we made
pet >ple at that game," said Larragoite.
Larragoite and the four other
Dollies, in addition to last year's
Dollies, performed with the Band and
also appeared on a Japanese talkshow
and at VIF cocktail parties.
The Band's unique style was high
lighted in contrast to the Arizona band,
with which it rehearsed and per
formed throughout the week.
"The Arizona band was a crackup,"
said Drum Major Brian Pike. "We
referred to them as repressed."
Pike added that although the Arizona
band marched with precision, the Stan
ford Band "oozed" in and out of
formations."They (the Arizona band)
didn't think much of our style," Pike
said.
"They certainly didn't have as much
fun as we did. They were out there to
put on a show and march ... but they
weren't having much fun," said Olson.
There were some problems with the
trip, however.
"A free trip to Tokyo has its draw
backs. They (the Japanese manage
ment) took advantage of the fact, and

we were pimped," said Pike.
Practicing four songs for eight
hours, waiting many long hours for
meetings that were eventually can
celled and continual show changes
were among the frustrations Stevens
cited. "We did a lot of running around
for no reason and a lot of sitting."

There was "a lot of 'hurry up and
wait' on this trip," added Schroeder.
