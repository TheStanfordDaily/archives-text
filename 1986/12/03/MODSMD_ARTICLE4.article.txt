# Senate backs new course
## Speakers Bureau reviews regulations after Daniloff 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night passed a
resolution urging the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (CUS) to endorse in
its meeting today an alternative West
ern Culture Program class developed
by History Prof. Clay Carson.
The bill came in response to rumors
that CUS members have decided not to
recommend the course because of
their misgivings about interrupting the
"continuity" of the Western Culture se
quence, according to senior Steve
Phillips, former chair of the Black Stu
dent Union.
In other business, the senate dis
cussed new funding procedures for
the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
The creation of discontinuity in the
Western Culture sequence is one of
the primary purposes of this alterna
tive program, Phillips said. "We don't
want to continue bad things," he said.
Senator Vivian Wu, co-sponsor of the
proposal, said that the new course will
still cover authors found in other
spring quarter courses in the eight
normal Western Culture tracks, such as

Freud, Virginia Woolf and Marx. The
course, which would focus on the con
tributions of minorities and women in
the United States, is a response to
criticism that the Western Culture Pro
gram overlooks the historic contribu
tions of those groups.
According to Senator Stacey Leyton,
the other co-sponsor of the bill, the
CUS is forgetting that students strongly
supported the idea of the course last
spring. "If they go back on this issue,
we will bring some pressure on them
again," she said. Wu said many of the
CUS members are new since the body
discussed the issues last spring.
The resolution will remind CUS that
students still are concerned about
reorganizing Western Culture, Leyton
added.
Under the current proposal, stu
dents from any Western Culture track
can choose to take the course in the
spring, Phillips said.
The senate passed the proposal in an
unanimous voice vote with a very lim
ited amount of discussion.
During the presentation of new
business, Graduate Senator Bob Grif
fin, a member of the Rules Committee,

proposed changes in the senate's by
laws for awarding the Speakers Bureau
funds.
According to Senator Lena
Slachmuijlder, a member of the com
mittee, journalist Nicholas Daniloffs
speech on Nov. 20 led the committee
to more closely examine procedures
for approving speakers.
Under the first of the new proposals,
only the senate as a body can accept or
reject funding requests by the
Speakers Bureau.
The second Rules Committee pro
posal requires that any honorarium re
quests exceeding $2,500 "must also be
accompanied by documentation
showing the speaker has received an
honorarium in excess of this amount
from at least one other source."
During its last meeting, the senate
initially rejected the request by the
bureau for $5,715 and then later alloca
ted reduced funds through the Budget
and Finance Committee.
The new proposals will prevent any
further "end-runs around the senate"
said Larry Bloch, deputy senate chair,
and as a result the Budget and Finance
Committee no longer has the power to
grant funds to the Speakers Bureau, he
said.
Bloch said these new proposals will
set precedents for the Speakers
Bureau. The bureau turns over people
every year, and at the beginning they
can be "had by slimy agents," he said.
These proposals will force the
bureau to come to the senate with
documentation, Bloch added.

Griffin also introduced to the senate
a Nov. 21 article from the the San Jose
Mercury News which he said demon
strated that the Speakers Bureau was
paying exhorbitant prices for its
speakers.
According to the article, Daniloff
"defended his high fee by arguing that
he's only been paid for two of the 30
speaking engagements he's honored."
Griffin questioned why the Speakers
Bureau was one of only two hosts
which had paid Daniloff an
honorarium.
One member of the Speakers
Bureau said one should look at this

revelation with a grain of salt."
"I don't want to make assumption
about 28 other speaking engagements
until 1 know for sure that they did not
pay," the member said.
According to Speakers Bureau mem
ber Coco Patel, the new proposals
would streamline the senate's opera
tion, but not affect the bureau directly.
Patel, however, said that Daniloffs
visit has changed the Speakers
Bureau's approach to paying
honorariums. Referring to the new
revelations in the Mercury News arti
cle, he said "Up to now, we had no rea
son to doubt the speakers ''

recommend the course because of
their misgivings about interrupting the
"continuity" of the Western Culture se
quence, according to senior Steve
Phillips, former chair of the Black Stu
dent Union.
In other business, the senate dis
cussed new funding procedures for
the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
The creation of discontinuity in the
Western Culture sequence is one of
the primary purposes of this alterna
tive program, Phillips said. "We don't
want to continue bad things," he said.
Senator Vivian Wu, co-sponsor of the
proposal, said that the new course will
still cover authors found in other
spring quarter courses in the eight
normal Western Culture tracks, such as

Freud, Virginia Woolf and Marx. The
course, which would focus on the con
tributions of minorities and women in
the United States, is a response to
criticism that the Western Culture Pro
gram overlooks the historic contribu
tions of those groups.
According to Senator Stacey Leyton,
the other co-sponsor of the bill, the
CUS is forgetting that students strongly
supported the idea of the course last
spring. "If they go back on this issue,
we will bring some pressure on them
again," she said. Wu said many of the
CUS members are new since the body
discussed the issues last spring.
The resolution will remind CUS that
students still are concerned about
reorganizing Western Culture, Leyton
added.
Under the current proposal, stu
dents from any Western Culture track
can choose to take the course in the
spring, Phillips said.
The senate passed the proposal in an
unanimous voice vote with a very lim
ited amount of discussion.
During the presentation of new
business, Graduate Senator Bob Grif
fin, a member of the Rules Committee,

proposed changes in the senate's by
laws for awarding the Speakers Bureau
funds.
According to Senator Lena
Slachmuijlder, a member of the com
mittee, journalist Nicholas Daniloffs
speech on Nov. 20 led the committee
to more closely examine procedures
for approving speakers.
Under the first of the new proposals,
only the senate as a body can accept or
reject funding requests by the
Speakers Bureau.
The second Rules Committee pro
posal requires that any honorarium re
quests exceeding $2,500 "must also be
accompanied by documentation
showing the speaker has received an
honorarium in excess of this amount
from at least one other source."
During its last meeting, the senate
initially rejected the request by the
bureau for $5,715 and then later alloca
ted reduced funds through the Budget
and Finance Committee.
The new proposals will prevent any
further "end-runs around the senate"
said Larry Bloch, deputy senate chair,
and as a result the Budget and Finance
Committee no longer has the power to
grant funds to the Speakers Bureau, he
said.
Bloch said these new proposals will
set precedents for the Speakers
Bureau. The bureau turns over people
every year, and at the beginning they
can be "had by slimy agents," he said.
These proposals will force the
bureau to come to the senate with
documentation, Bloch added.

Griffin also introduced to the senate
a Nov. 21 article from the the San Jose
Mercury News which he said demon
strated that the Speakers Bureau was
paying exhorbitant prices for its
speakers.
According to the article, Daniloff
"defended his high fee by arguing that
he's only been paid for two of the 30
speaking engagements he's honored."
Griffin questioned why the Speakers
Bureau was one of only two hosts
which had paid Daniloff an
honorarium.
One member of the Speakers
Bureau said one should look at this

revelation with a grain of salt."
"I don't want to make assumption
about 28 other speaking engagements
until 1 know for sure that they did not
pay," the member said.
According to Speakers Bureau mem
ber Coco Patel, the new proposals
would streamline the senate's opera
tion, but not affect the bureau directly.
Patel, however, said that Daniloffs
visit has changed the Speakers
Bureau's approach to paying
honorariums. Referring to the new
revelations in the Mercury News arti
cle, he said "Up to now, we had no rea
son to doubt the speakers ''
