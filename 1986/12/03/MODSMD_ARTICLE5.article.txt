TOKYO — Wandering the streets of this Japanese capital
is a lot like wandering the streets of any extremely large city
in the United States or Western Europe. There are lots of
people, lots of taxis on crowded streets, lots of tall buildings
and lots of stores looking to take your hard-earned dollars
— which buy fewer and fewer yen each day.
What makes Tokyo's Ginza district unique is not its de
partment stores and shops, but its signs. On top of every
building is an enormous, colorful neon sign, doing all sorts
of light tricks.

Reporter's Notebook

Technology is what has made Japan the No. 2 economic
power in the world. So it's not surprising that's what
Japanese think of in terms of judging American universities.
In conversations with Japanese, the mention of Stanford
University brought instant recognition. "Oh, you go to Stan
ford? You are very smart," or words to that effect. Absolutely
no mention of being the first university to have a football
team in the AP Top 20 and a band on probation at the same
time.
In a small bar with geisha girls pouring Cutty Sark and
water while Japanese businessmen loosened their ties and
took the microphone to sing for do-it-yourself videos, the
name was enough for an innocent abroad to get a refill of
scotch from a foursome of customers and discussion in bro
ken English — which was still much better than the Ameri
can's Japanese — of the merits of certain schools.
"There are three universities in America that are famous

in Japan," one confided. "Harvard, Mazza..., uh, Mazzac
hooz..uh, MIT, and Stanford University. Three famous.
Like Tokyo University, Osaka University- and Kyoto Univer
sity in Japan." Then he poured another scotch and water.
Stanford will likely become more famous in Japan when a
new overseas studies center opens in Kyoto in 1988. Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and Prof. Thomas Heller, di
rector of the Overseas Studies Program, were scheduled to
meet with Kyoto University officials in Kyoto on Monday to
discuss that center. It will be Stanford's first in Japan, and
will emphasize technical fields and include internships.
Koji Kokimori, a translator for NDC Corp. in Chiba, about
50 kilometers from here, explained that Stanford is well
known in Japan because of the strength of its engineering
departments and its West Coast location.
There are 1,000 members of the Japan Stanford Associa
tion scattered throughout the country, 300 of whom found
their way to Tokyo Olympic Stadium Sunday to watch the
Cardinal defeat Arizona 29-24. At a typical Stanford tailgater,
complete with Budweiser and the Stanford Band, some of
the group, which includes 150 Americans working in Japan,
100 professors who taught at Stanford and "a lot of business
school graduates," talked about the reputations of American
universities here.
"UCLA is very popular among the young, probably be
cause it represents the whole Southern California mys
tique," said Ted Emmons, noting that Bruin sweatshirts and
other items are status symbols and widely available. "The
Ivies are well-known to the older generation. MIT and Stan
ford are the best known among technical universities."
"More and more, people are hearing about Stanford,"
said Koji Sasaki, the director of the association. "More and
more, it's becoming acknowledged as one of the best uni
versities."
