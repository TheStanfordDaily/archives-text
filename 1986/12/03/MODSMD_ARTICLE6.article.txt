# Admiral recalls his Vietnam experience
## 
### CHRISTOPHER SAIGAL Staff writer 
"Hostages eat our nation alive
They make us make crazy decisions
as a nation based on one or two
people," Adm. James Stockdale, a
former prisoner of war in Vietnam,
said last night in a presentation in
Eucalypto lounge.
Stockdale, a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution, spoke
about his experiences in the Vietnam
War and the politics of hostage
taking. According to Stockdale, the
United States is very sensitive to
hostage-taking, "one of the worlds
oldest sports.
"If there is anything to learn from
this, it is that governments and
people are not perfect," said
Stockdale, adding that nations are
susceptible to "greed and pride."
Fourteen months after the start of
United States involvement in the Viet
nam War, Stockdale was shot down in
an airplane, breaking his arm and
back. He was taken prisoner, tortured
and put into prison, where he lived
in isolation for four years, two of
them in leg irons.
vStockdale described the mental
survival mechanisms of a prisoner in
solitary. "You think you are going to

go crazy, but no such luck," he said.
At first, he said, a prisoner is de
pressed by his imprisonment, but,
"when you learn how powerful and
resourceful your mind and body are,
things get better."
At first, "you start doing memory
puzzles," said Stockdale, adding that
he, for example, tried to remember
every summer vacation he had taken.
"You get a deep perception of
memory and lose your internal men
tal static," he said. "America seemed
noisy when I got back — people
talked about things with no practical
significance." He said that this state of
mind could explain why many
people who were political prisoners
become writers.
Eventually, Stockdale said,
prisoners need to communicate with
someone else. He recounted how an
underground community rose up
among the prisoners in solitary cells.
Stockdale said, "The growth of the
prison society was like the growth of
civilization We all started out with
nothing, after being tortured.... We
developed communication and
laws." The code prisoners used to
communicate required only one
sound, a knock. A five letter by five
letter matrix was used. If prisoners
were caught communicating, they

were tortured again, so secrecy was
vital, Stockdale said.
Discussing the support prisoners
gave one another, Stockdale said his
experience made him more struck
by the goodness of human nature
than the evil." One of his strongest
memories, he said, was when a group
message was communicated by the
other prisoners: "We love you, we

are with you to the end."
One of the most important func
tions the group communication
served was to "uncork the guilt" of
prisoners who revealed classified in
formation under torture, he said.
Stockdale said he didn't "see his
torturers as monsters, but as
primitive, mad, young boys."
