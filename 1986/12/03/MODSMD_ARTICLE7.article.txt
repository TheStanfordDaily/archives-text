# New course will focus on STDs

National experts on sexually trans
mitted diseases will lecture next quar
ter in a new Human Biology- course
that will be open to the general public
as well as Stanford students.
"There is no class anywhere like
this," said Sylvia Cerel Brown, a third
year medical student and teaching as
sistant for the new course, which is en
titled "Biosocial Aspects of Sexually
Transmitted Diseases."
The course is the brainchild of
Brown, who, along with Dr. Gary
Schoolnik, assistant professor of
microbiology', put together a speaking
schedule that includes leading re
searchers and policy-makers in the
field of STDs.
The course will try to give students a
basic understanding of the biology,
epidemiology and social and behav
ioral aspects of the diseases, she said.
"For our society, the biggest medical
dangers over the next decade or two
are STDs," said Craig Heller, director
of the Human Biology Program.
The course is "bringing in people
that are real experts in the field," Hel
ler said. "It's a unique oppportunity."
Brown said the class would be open
to the public because "it would be a
shame for only 25 people to have
access to the class. We would like the

Stanford community to take advantage
of the opportunity."
Because the new class combines sci
entific perspectives with social and po
litical perspectives, it is ideally suited
to Human Biology, he added
Guest lecturers include Dr. Ward
Gates, from the National Centers for
Disease Control, who will talk about
national public policy on STDs, Dr.
King Holmes of the University of Wash
ington, who will discuss STD research
methods and problems, and Prof. Allan
Brandt of Harvard Medical School,
who has written a book on the social
history of venereal disease in the
United States.
Brown said that although experts on
AIDS will lecture — including Dr. Tom
Quinn of Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine — the class will not simply
focus on the disease.
"AIDS is important in terms of
public health ... but with a class like
this, it's important to not let AIDS take
over," Brown said. "Understanding the
precedents of other STDs helps you
understand AIDS."
Other guest speakers will address
the role of the media regarding STDs,
prostitution and STDs, legal issues
raised by STDs and homosexual
lifestyles and STDs.
Brown said the course will probably
be more up to date than published ma
terial on the subject: "They (the guest
speakers) know what's happening
before it's published."
The cost of bringing such distin
guished speakers amounted to $5,000.
The Human Biology Program, Cowell
Health Center, the Feminist Studies
Program and the office of the dean of
Student Affairs financed the course,
Brown said.
According to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, there is an important
need for education about STDs. "We've
had stuff about STDs in our health
literature for years, but that doesn't
mean it's effective," he said.
"It's not as though these things

(STDs) are remote. It's very germane
for a college population — a popula
tion that is very sexually active," he
said. "In a sense it's a community
health issue."
In addition to learning the specific
facts about STDs, students will also
learn from experts what sort of ques
tions to ask when faced with the issue,
Lyons said.
The course, to be held Tuesday and
Thursday afternoons winter quarter,
will be offered for two or four units.
Students who take the course for

four units must complete and present
in class a research project, and Brown
said students can make a contribution
to the field because the research on
STDs is developing so quickly. "The
area is hot enough — it's not all writ
ten. 1 would like to see papers go
beyond class," she said.
Brown is one of 34 medical students
nationwide chosen as a SmithKline
Beckman Corporation Medical Per
spective Fellow by the National Fund
for Medical Education. Brown said she
used her $3,300 grant to help develop
the new course.
