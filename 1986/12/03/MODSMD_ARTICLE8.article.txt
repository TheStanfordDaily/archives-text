U.S. reportedly set arms prices
JERUSALEM — Prices for U.S. arms that Israel helped transfer to Iran un
der a secret Reagan administration initiative this year were set by the
Americans, not by Israelis, according to an Israeli source knowledgeable
about the program.
The source, who spoke on condition that he not be further identified
and not quoted directly, also said Israel knew of only one Swiss account
into which the Iranians, by direct bank transfer, paid for the arms.
That version of events contradicts that given by U.S. Attorney General Ed
win Meese in a press conference last week and also contradicts statements
by President Reagan in an interview published this week by Time maga
zine.
And it came amid apparently growing concern here over repeated ad
ministration suggestions that Israel, despite its official denials, knowingly
helped divert money acquired in the Iranian arms deal to the rebels,
known as contras, fighting the government of Nicaragua.
Reagan told Time that "another country was facilitating those sales of
weapons systems (to Iran). They then were overcharging and were appar
ently putting the money into bank accounts of the leaders of the contras. It
wasn'r us funneling money to them. This was another country."
While Reagan did not name the country, Meese last week said Israeli rep
resentatives had marked up $12 million worth of arms by as much as 250
percent, repaying the Central Intelligence Agency the true value of the
weapons and depositing the surplus into numbered Swiss bank accounts
controlled by the Nicaraguan rebels.
Bush expected to deny guilt
WASHINGTON — Vice President George Bush will declare his in
nocence of any illegalities and his confidence in President Reagan's hand
ling of national-security affairs when he makes his first speech today on the
burgeoning arms-to-Iran and contras' aid scandal, close associates said yes
terday.
Confronting what some see as a crisis for his undeclared presidential
candidacy from the most serious controversy to engulf the administration
in six years, Cabinet colleagues and longtime political associates said Bush
will hope that a conspicuous display of loyalty will be rewarded by Repub
lican primary voters in 1988.
Bush's speech to a luncheon of the American Enterprise Institute, a con
servative think-tank, will emphasize "the administration's concern and
commitment to take all legal actions necessary to put this behind us and
restore credibility to the National Security Council," according to his press
secretary, Marlin Fitzwater.
Fitzwater said Bush will also discuss his own and his staffs role in the
controversial secret operations but "not extensively," because of the on
going investigations by the Justice Department, a special prosecutor, con
gressional committees and a bipartisan group of "wise men" named by the
president.
Economic indicators rise in Oct.
WASHINGTON — The government said yesterday its main barometer of
future economic activity posted its best advance in three months, but
private analysts said the 0.6 percent October increase was not enough to
sway them from the belief that economic prospects remain sluggish.
The Commerce Department said the October rise in die Index of
Leading Indicators followed a 0.2 percent September increase and a
decline of 0.2 percent in August.
In another weak assessment of the economic performance, the Labor
Department said productivity in the non-farm segment of the economy
limped along at a 0.2 percent annual rate of increase in the July-September
quarter.
This gain in productivity, which measures the efficiency with which
goods and services are produced, was less than half the 0.5 percent in
crease in the spring quarter and dramatically lower than the 4.3 percent
rise in the first three months of the year.
The October advance in the leading index was the largest monthly gain
since a 1 percent rise in July, but private analysts contended the increase
was swayed by special factors that did not reflect underlying strength.
Black activists slain in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Masked gunmen killed a prominent
black physician and his wife, both leading anti-apartheid activists, the South
African government's Bureau for Information reported yesterday.
The killings appeared to be the latest in a two-year series of political as
sassinations, none of which have been solved.
The bureau said that Dr. Fabian Ribeiro and his wife, Florence, both in
their 50s, were gunned down Monday evening at the kitchen door of their
house in the black ghetto township of Mamelodi outside Pretoria, the
South Africa capital.
The bureau said the two gunmen were black and armed with ,45-caliber
revolvers, but neighbors who witnessed the shooting — and gave chase
until they were fired upon — said the men were white and wore knitted ski
masks.
India religious tensions mount
NEW DELHI, India — Police used tear gas to disperse mobs in several
sections of the Indian capital yesterday as tension between Hindus and
Sikhs mounted in the wake of the killing of 22 mostly Hindu bus pas
sengers in Punjab state Sunday by Sikh terrorists.
The historic Chadni Chowk area in the old section of city was placed un
der curfew last night after bands of Hindus threatened an important Sikh
shrine. The Press Trust of India news agency reported that more than 1,500
persons were arrested. Most businesses remained closed yesterday as a
protest over the incident, in which six Sikh terrorists excuted Hindu pas
sengers on a crowded public bus near Dasuya in Punjab.
Meanwhile, the government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, under in
creasing pressure in Parliament to remove the moderate Sikh Akali Dal
government in Punjab, ordered the arrest of three Sikh leaders who have
frequently appeared with militant Sikh factions. Parkash Singh Badal, a rich
landlord and former Punjab chief minister; Gurcharan Singh Tohra, the
elected leader of the Sikhs' temple management committee, and Kuldip
Singh Wadala, a state legislator, were all arrested under the national secur
ity act on charges of "supporting terrorism and advocating violence."
Weapons tested at UC-Berkeley
BERKELEY — A small nuclear reactor on the UC-Berkeley campus has
been used to test missile components, drawing the ire of residents
opposed to the nuclear arms race.
Charles Schwartz, a professor in the Berkeley Physics Department, con
tended yesterday that such tests contradict past statements by university of
ficials that the reactor would not be used for defense work.
In the past, it's been repeatedly stated that this facility was not only
super-safe, but it was only used for academic, training and research
purposes," he said. As a member of the faculty, I'm both embarrassed and
outraged by what's going on here."
George Leitmann. associate dean for Academic Affairs in the College of
Engineering, said unhersity policies bar classified research work, but don't
proscribe weapons components testing. He said components testing at the
reactor is a "perfectly routine matter."
"We don't generally advertise everything we do. but on the other hand,
we don't hide it." Leitmann said.
Schwartz said that through the office of Rep Ron Dellums (D-Calif) he
checked the items recently tested and found that the components were
from the Trident 2. an intercontinental missile being developed as the next
phase in the nuclear arms race
He said the reactor tests were done for Lockheed, which has a contract to
work on parts of the missile system
