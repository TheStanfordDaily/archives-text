# Reagan calls for investigation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, struggling
with the worst scandal of his presidency, announced
yesterday that his administration has asked for an in
dependent counsel to investigate clandestine U.S.
arms sales to Iran and the diversion of profits to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
"If illegal acts were undertaken," Reagan said in a
brief speech from the Oval Office, "those who did so
will be brought to justice."
Immediately after Reagan's remarks, Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese told a press conference that he
would quickly ask a special three-judge panel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals here to name an independent
counsel to take over the investigation that he has su
pervised for the last week and a half.
A preliminary draft of the Department of Justice's
application for an independent counsel listed as

many as a dozen federal laws that might have been
violated by administration officials in implementing
the Iranian arms sales and diverting profits to the
contras.
The laws range from defrauding the government
of profits earned from the sale of U.S. property to
conspiring to violate federal laws.
Meese's formal request for an independent coun
sel could come as soon as today, Department of
Justice officials said, but the appeals court panel will
probably need at least 10 more days to appoint a
counsel.
Reagan pledged to cooperate fully with the inde
pendent counsel and with congressional investiga
tions of the arms sales and their link to the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras. He endorsed
proposals by several members of Congress to estab

lish a special Watergate-style committee to look into
the matters.
In his fourth televised appearance to try to explain
the Iranian arms sales, Reagan vowed to disclose all
the facts of the clandestine operation to the American
public. "If acts in implementing my policy were
taken without my authorization, knowledge or con
currence," he said, "this will be exposed.
Reagan also announced the appointment of Frank
Carlucci, deputy secretary of defense for the first two
years of his administration, as his national security
adviser. Vice Adm. John Poindexter resigned from
that job last week as Meese disclosed that Poindexter
was one of the few administration officials who knew
about the link between the Iran arms sales and the
contras.
