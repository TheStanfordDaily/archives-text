# Navy: B1 bombs

### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Air Force,
citing major problems with crucial
components of its new B-1B strategic
bomber, has withheld more than $250
million in payments to companies that
produce systems for it, Pentagon offi
cials said yesterday.
The Air Force has discovered
serious problems with the plane's
electronic defense equipment, consid
ered critical to the bomber's mission
to penetrate enemy territory in
wartime, officials told a House inves
tigative panel yesterday.
The supersonic bomber, a corner
stone of President Reagan's program to
upgrade the nation's nuclear forces, is
also troubled by defects in its terrain
following radar, flight controls and
missile-launching system and has per
sistent problems with fuel leaks, ac
cording to officials.
The problems have prompted the
Air Force to deny more than $250 mil
lion in progress payments since last
spring to several companies, Gen.
Lawrence Skantz, commander of the

Air Force Systems Command, said after
"It's behind, and it's going to be be
hind for some period of time," Thomas
Cooper, the Air Force's assistant secre
tary for Research, Development and
Logistics, told the subcommittee.
"There is a major problem with the
electronic-countermeasures equip
ment: the receiving and jamming
devices," Cooper said.
The electronic-countermeasures sys
tem is critical to the B-18, the nation's
most sophisticated bomber, which was
developed for low-level, high-speed
penetration of enemy defenses. It was
the capability of that equipment that
Reagan used as one of his major selling
points in persuading Congress five
years ago to revive the plane, which
President Carter had canceled.
The problems could severely
threaten the capability of the B-18,
which along with the "Stealth"
advanced-technology bomber is ex
pected to be a key leg of America's
defense forces until the mid-19905.
