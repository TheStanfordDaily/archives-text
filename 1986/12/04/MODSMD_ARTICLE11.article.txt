## 
### 
WASHINGTON — While saying
that "mistakes were made" and that
"our credibility has been
damaged," Vice President Bush yes
terday defended President Reagan's
rationale for secretly selling arms to
Iran and praised his handling of the
scandal involving the diversion of
profits from those sales to aid the
contras in Nicaragua.
In his first speech addressing the
month-old controversy, Bush
denied prior knowledge of illicit ac
tivities. He called for the various in
vestigations to proceed swiftly and
to "let the chips fall where they
may."
Bush's policy and political ad
visers, mindful of the importance of
the speech to his presidential
aspirations, said afterward they
thought he had passed a difficult
political test. In the words of one,
he "walked a fine line of pledging
allegiance to the president, yet es
tablishing an element of indepen
dence, in tone, if not substance,"

through his willingness to say that
the administration has erred. In his
public comments on the scandal,
Reagan has struck a more defiant
chord than Bush did yesterday,
and has refused to acknowlege that
mistakes were made.
The errors Bush conceded yes
terday were limited to the National
Security Council staff s diversion of
funds from Iran to the rebels fight
ing the Nicaraguan government.
Bush said he had no knowledge of
that operation, despite the fact that
he sits on the NSC and that his na
tional security aide, Donald Gregg,
has been linked to American
backed supply operations to the
contras.
Bush defended the policy on the
basis of the strategic importance of
Iran and the need to establish ties
to a successor to the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
