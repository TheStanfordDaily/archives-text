# CIR report: 'What has been the net impact of U.S. business on apartheid?'

### 
Editor's note: This is the third of four dis
cussion papers prepared by the Commission
on Investment Responsibility. The papers
address tlx.' proper role for U.S. companies
in South Africa The final paper will be
printed in The Daily during the first week of
January.
In the late winter and early spring of
1987, nearly all of the 64 South Africa
related companies now in Stanford's
portfolio will be facing shareholder resolu
tions calling on them to implement a disin
vestment program in order to move toward
withdrawal from South Africa. In the nor
mal course of events, the CIR will make a
recommendation on each resolution to the
Board of Trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR), which
then will vote Stanford's shares on the
resolution and perhaps communicate di
rectly with management to explain or rein
force Stanford's position. In order to vote
for such a resolution, Stanford policy re
quires that the trustees conclude that the
company s activities cause "substantial so
cial injury' and that the shareholder pro
posal would "eliminate or materially
reduce the substantial social injury."
Consequently, it is crucial to analyze the
effect of U.S. business being in South Africa.
What is its net impact on apartheid? Some
claim that American companies there con
stitute a "progressive force" that is moving a
bad situation in a positive direction. Others
assert that American companies there are
contributing to the continuation of apart
heid, thereby causing "substantial social in
jury." Still others take a middle ground,
saying that the more progressive companies
are having a positive impact while others
are not.
What are the factors underlying these dif
ferent viewpoints? That is the focus of this
discussion paper. In the first section, we lay
out the commonly voiced "positive factors"
— the ones at the positive end of the scale
measuring the impact of American compan
ies in South Africa. (These factors tend to
require a relatively complex line of reason
ing, so the second section is considerably
longer than the first.) After laying out both
sides, the natural question is the net bal
ance — are American companies in South
Africa a net positive force or a net negative
force? We draw no final conclusions regard
ing the net balance in this paper, but invite
you to communicate your conclusions to
the CIR.

Positive Factors
(1) American companies in South Africa
provide jobs for blacks Unemployment
among blacks in South Africa perennially is
high. Therefore any employment provided
by American companies is beneficial. (Of
the 10 million members of the black labor
force, between 20 and 25 percent are un
employed [5;12;15, p. 144], American com
panies now employ approximately 72,000
blacks, or about 0.7 percent of the total
black labor force. [9, p. 3]
(2) The progressive employment practices
of many American companies in South
Africa benefit blacks in the workplace.
Through the affirmative action programs of
the Sullivan Principles, many American
companies in South Africa have elevated
some blacks to a higher status within the
workplace and have provided a model for
other companies to emulate. ("Sullivan sig
natories, on average, pay significantly
higher minimum wages, and they fill a
higher proportion of the more skilled and
responsible positions with blacks" as
compared with U.S. companies that are
non-signers of the Sullivan Principles! 10,
p. 2].)
(3) The progressive social programs spon
sored by many American companies in
South Africa benefit blacks outside the
workplace. In carrying out the Sullivan Prin
ciples, many American companies also have
acted to improve the quality of blacks' lives
(both employees and others) outside the
work environment in such areas as housing,
transportation, schooling, recreation and
health facilities. Some of the most
noteworthy programs have come in the
area of education. According to the Ninth
Report on the Signatory Companies to the
Sullivan Principles [2, p. 15], e.g. in 1984,
Sullivan signatory companies contributed a
total of 3,638,806 rand in educational assis
tance (in the form of bursaires) to 9,025 stu
dents, adopted 332 schools representing a
total enrollment of 232,178 pupils, and
donated a total of 14,010,424 rand and
12,409 employee days to various educa
tional institutions in South Africa. (The ap
proximate value of one rand in 1984 was
$0.67). From 1977 to 1983, Sullivan sig
natories spent about $70-80 milion to
implement the principles [3, p. 6). This fig
ure does not include contributions to com
munity projects by American companies
who have not signed the Sullivan Principles.
(4ySome American companies lobby the
South African government against apart

heid. Since March of 1985, some American
companies have taken a more public
posture in suggesting ways that Pretoria can
dismantle apartheid. The American Cham
ber of Commerce (AmCham) presented the
government with a far-reaching list of pro
posed reforms [1] and recently sponsored
two ads in South African newspapers calling
for significant changes. In September 1985,
the chief executive officers of 80 U.S. com
panies with operations in South Africa
formed the U.S. Corporate Council on
South Africa, whose goal is to work with the
South African business community to ad
dress the need for basic social and political
reform in the country. The group has taken
out newspaper ads in the United States call
ing for major reforms in South Africa.
Negative Factors
(1) Under South African law, American
companies provide direct support to the
South African government. Any U.S. busi
ness activity in South Africa involves a sub
stantial degree of support for the South
African government in reinforcing apart
heid through (i) the payment of taxes, (ii)
laws that require secretly selling goods to
the government upon demand, and (iii) a
law that requires secretly assisting the gov
ernment in providing security for "key
points" upon demand. Some companies
also have openly made direct and indirect
sales to the military or police.
There is no publicly available information
on the value of taxes paid by American com
panies to the South African government.
However, the CIR has found two publica
tions where attempts have been made to
develop rough estimates. Focusing just on
corporate income taxes (now 50 percent of
taxable income), the Investor Responsibility
Research Center (IRRC) [8, p. 7] developed
year-by-year estimates from 1980 to 1984
that averaged $78 million per year, but
David Hauck of the IRRC recendy informed a
representative of the CIR that he now feels
that these estimates were too low, perhaps
by a substantial amount. (Note that even this
$78 million average annual figure roughly
equals the total amount spent over a seven
year period, 1977 to 1983, by Sullivan sig
natories to implement the Sullivan Prin
ciples.) In what appears to be a more
detailed study for the period 1977-83, a
former CIR member, Rob Schecter [13].
considers both corporate income taxes and
a wide variety of other taxes (property tax,
sales tax, undistributed profits tax and many
others) that American companies in South

Africa must pay. Schecter estimates that
total taxes paid during the period studied
closely approach an average of $1 billion
per year, with about a third of this total
being corporate income taxes. However,
Schecter's report does not provide enough
documentation to permit independent verifi
cation of his estimates, so his figures should
not be viewed as authoritiative either. It
does seem clear that the taxes paid have
been substantial. It also appears that
average annual U.S. coporate income taxes
paid perhaps have fallen roughly in the
range from nearly $100 million to $300 mil
lion, and that all other taxes paid have been
of the same order of magnitude.
Several different laws, including the Na
tional Supplies Procurement Act, require
companies with operations in South Africa
to supply specified goods and services to
the government. According to the IRRC [8,
p. 3], this particular act "gives any cabinet
minister extensive powers to order com
panies to provide the state with goods and
services whenever he deems it necessary or
expedient for the security of South Africa."
When so ordered, companies may also be
required by law to keep the order secret.
The national Key Points Act states that the
South African Minster of Defense may
declare any place or area, including a com
pany's facilities, to be a "key point" if
damage to it would be harmful to South
Africa's security. When a company is desig
nated a key point, the owner is required to
provide security for the area against disrup
tions and to cooperate with South African
authorities in this endeavor. Moreover, the
owner is required to keep this designation
secret. It is likely that American petroleum
companies, and perhaps other strategic
companies, have been designated national
key points. [8, pp. 6-7; 14, p. 20]
(2) The participation of American com
panies within the framework of apartheid
conveys the wrong message about its
legitimacy. The ramifications of apartheid
are pervasive throughout South Africa. Any
business conducted there must be done
within the framework of apartheid, includ
ing the forms of support for entrenching
apartheid described for the preceding fac
tor. The various forms of partnership be
tween the South African government, and
the American companies there signal an ac
ceptance of apartheid that has placed on it a
stamp of legitimacy, thereby reinforcing the
