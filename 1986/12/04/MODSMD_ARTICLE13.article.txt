## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Raising credibility 
### 
Prestige plays an important role in presidential
politics; an administration's projection of integrity and
power can dictate the tempo and effectiveness of
domestic and foreign policy. President Reagan's action
Tuesday on the Iran-Nicaragua arms controversy, al
though overdue, was a welcome first step in repairing
the serious damage the crisis has inflicted on Reagan and
the country's image and credibility.
By requesting that an independent prosecutor look
into the case, Reagan has gone a long way toward al
leviating concerns that the administration was covering
up important information regarding the diversion of mil
lions of dollars to the Nicaraguan insurgents from U.S.
arms sales to Iran.
Reagan must go further, however, and assure the
public that all information pertinent to the case will be
provided. The president should pledge — now, before
the independent probe commences — that he will not
invoke executive privilege to withhold any facts.
In addition, Reagan's request that the House and Sen
ate consolidate their inquiries into a single committee
and his disregard of calls to reconvene Congress are ef

fective methods of limiting the amount of partisan
positioning that could needlessly cloud the issues.
Although the president's declarations should help
create an appropriate atmosphere for untangling the
arcane web of intrigue that surrounds the deals, prob
lems still remain — chief among them is the issue of his
administration's forthrightness.
Some key officials have already discussed the situation
openly. Vice President Bush ended his silence on the
issue yesterday, an indication that some members of the
administration are beginning to recognize the impor
tance and absolute necessity of forthrightness. However,
Vice Adm. John Poindexter's refusal to testify yesterday at
a closed hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee
shows that some members of the administration remain
unwilling to talk. Reagan must exert all his influence to
get his officials, both current and past, to provide infor
mation.
In his statement, Bush said, "We must take our lumps
and move forward." Indeed, only an immediate and total
revelation of the facts will lead to the conclusion of the
controversy.
