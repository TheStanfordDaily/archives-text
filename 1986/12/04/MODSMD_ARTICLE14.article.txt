# Zulu chief is a tool of imperialism

### 
South Africa, referred to as "Azania" by South
African revolutionaries and their supporters, is a na
tion dominated by U.S. imperialism. The back
breaking labor of the Azanian people is accumulated
as wealth in America. The fact that Azanians are kept
at starvation's edge, subjected to every manner of
human degradation and terrorized by the white set
tler regime, has lead many Azanian people to attempt
to break the chains of their enslavement. Thus, South
Africa is a nation on the edge of revolution against
imperialism.
Chief Gatsha Buthelezi is the chief minister of the
so-called homeland of Kwa-Zulu, "representing"

UPRISING

seven million Zulus, and is head of the Zulu-based
movement Inkatha, which claims a membership of
one million. Buthelezi has been visiting the United
States for the past two weeks and in the course of his
stay has met with President Ronald Reagan and
leading U.S. businessmen and has received an
honorary degree from Boston University. Today, But
helezi will be meeting with the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR), members of the Stanford
Board of Trustees and other University notables.
These visits by Buthelezi are an expression of the
efforts of South African counter-revolutionaries and
the developing neo-colonial elite to build a united
front as broad as possible internally and internation
ally to combat the rising tide of anti-imperialist revo
lution in Azania.
Buthelezi serves the very necessary role of being a
black in favor of U.S. imperialism. Buthelezi's actions
in support of U.S. imperialism include his opposition
to the divestment movement, his arguments for
greater U.S. investment (and thus domination), his
support of the government-initiated homelands
policy and his proposal to merge the Kwa-Zulu and

Natal homelands. Additionally, he argues against viol
ent opposition to apartheid and encourages patience
on the part of the oppressed.
Finally, as unrest has intensified, his support for
U.S. imperialism has necessitated military action
against other less reactionary forces as well as the
revolutionaries. These armed attacks are also part of
building the united front against revolution. Inkatha's
harassment of the United Democratic Front and the
African National Congress represents an attempt to
scare away the less resolute and win away fearful and
opportunistic individuals in these anti-apartheid or
ganizations. Inkatha's death list of the leaders of the
Azanian People's Organization (AZAPO) and the as
sassinations of some of these leaders reflect the fact
that AZAPO, as part of the Black Consciousness Move
ment (BCM), represents the anti-imperialist forces
that Buthelezi's united front is commissioned to
destroy.
During his visit, Buthelezi has said in response to
anti-apartheid protesters who are hostile to him that
it is not politically correct to attack him because
"Nelson Mandela himself doesn't criticize me." This
could very well be an empty, bragging posture. And
he could be trying to call forth a revolutionary image
to legitimize his subservience to U.S. imperialism,
and thus build up his united front. But even if it were
the case that an alleged revolutionary did not
criticize Buthelezi, this would not make Buthelezi
any less contemptible. It would only cast doubt on
the aims of the revolutionary in question.
Many people have become sidetracked in their at
tacks on Buthelezi and focus primarily on his opposi
tion to divestment and sanctions. This is becoming a
more serious error as events unfold in South Africa.
For while at one point divestment was a progressive
demand, it no longer serves in that role. It is quite
clear that large U.S. firms have been able to pull out
of South Africa, and even right-wingers like Califor
nia Governor George Deukmejian support divest
ment. Feeling pressure from Azanian and domestic

critics, the U.S. ruling circles have made a retreat.
Nonetheless, in retreating they have retrenched
themselves. Although a company may formally leave
South Africa, the economic relation of control and
domination is maintained, but increasingly staffed by
black lieutenants. (This process has gone on before
in other countries as they were transformed from
formal colonial to neo-colonial status.)
In attacking Buthelezi our goal of solidarity with
the Azanian people's struggle against imperialism
must be kept in the forefront of our minds. "Washing
our hands of the blood of apartheid" by divesting no
longer benefits the most progressive forces. If we are
truly committed to assisting the liberation of Azania,
we must support those forces that are fighting to
create an Azania free of imperialist domination,
American or Soviet.
As of now, it appears that AZAPO is the principal
representation of these forces. We hear the black
youth of the townships, known as the "comrades,"
who mandated "Black Christmas" last year, bran
dished whips stolen from government forces while
demanding that other students boycott the racist edu
cation, placed burning tires, called "necklaces,"
around the necks of black traitors, and who make the
townships "ungovernable." These courageous
people are part of the BCM. They are, and will be
even more gp in the future, labeled "terrorists." But,
regardless of the hypocritical slanders dished out by
the real terrorists, these are the people who will free
Azania. And it is up to us to support them any way we
can.
Today at 1:30 p.m., the black overseer of Azanian
enslavement meets with the trustees and the CIR at
Bowman Alumni House. Uprising will be there both
to oppose Buthelezi and to support the revolution in
Azania. If you agree with us, join us.
Uprising is an anti-imperialist organization that is
tr)>ing to understand and combat class divisions, rac
ism, sexism and the oppression of gays and lesbians.
