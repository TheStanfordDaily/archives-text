# Buthelezi offers part of the story
## 
### 
Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, chief mini
ster of the Kwa-Zulu homeland and his
Inkatha organization, will speak today
to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) in a private
meeting. Originally, Buthelezi had re
quested that the University sponsor the
meeting, but it declined for political
reasons and the CIR took it on subse
quently. In hosting Buthelezi and ap
parently not inviting a representative
of any other legitimately recognized

BSU & SOSA

South African anti-apartheid organiza
tion, the CIR, which operates under the
aegis of the University, has chosen to
hear only one side of the divestment
debate. The validity of Buthelezi's per
spective has been questioned by many
people, and thus to hear only his ver

sion of the situation in South Africa
misrepresents the truth of how most
South Africans feel about divestment,
takes an active role in its mis
representation and seems to contradict
the ClR's stated commitment to
dialogue about the issue.
Buthelezi and Inkatha are often held
up by opponents of divestment as
models of progressive behavior. This
description has been refuted by
several sources. Wellings and Sutcliffe
write that "for all its progressive rheto
ric, the positions which Inkatha
assumes on specific concrete issues —
stayaways, forced removals, boycotts,
rent strikes and so on — are anything
but progressive." In addition, accord
ing to a poll taken in 1985 among ur
ban Africans, urban blacks do not see a
future under Buthelezi as in any way
preferable to one under South African
President Botha. These facts seem to
contradict an assessment of Buthelezi
and Inkatha as progressive.

The CIR itself, in a recently pub
lished position paper (Daily, Nov. 21),
wrote that Buthelezi and Inkatha
"solidly favor increased investment by
foreign companies that adhere to cer
tain responsibility standards." To ap
prove of increased foreign investment
in South Africa is hardly a progressive
stance. Furthermore, the CIR contrasts
Inkatha's support of investment with
the positions of the United Democratic
Front, Bishop Tutu, trade unions, the
Azanian People's Organization, the
African National Congress, the South
African Council of Churches, the Labor
party- and the majority of urban blacks,
all of whom support disinvestment and
think that disinvestment will actually
help in pressuring the government to
end apartheid. From this information
one may conclude that Buthelezi's
views are not close to being represen
tative of the opinion of the majority of
black South Africans.
And who will receive the miseduca

tion that Buthelezi offers? Will this talk
be used as an excuse to students for
Stanford's refusal to divest? By not of
fering a speaker who accurately
represents the position of the majority
of South African blacks, the CIR not
only contributes to miseducation but
also contradicts its stated dedication to
dialogue on the divestment issue. As
stated before, Buthelezi is an impor
tant figure in South Africa, and thus his
visit provides an excellent opportunity
for dialogue. To neglect this opportu
nity and to hear only Buthelezi's per
spective passes up this opportunity, a
chance that may not soon recur. We
therefore hope the CIR will follow But
helezi's visit with dialogue with repre
sentatives of other legitimate South
African anti-apartheid groups.
