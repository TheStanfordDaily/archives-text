The recent story on the University of lowa and
lowa City was conceivably the most biased and ill
researched article that I have ever read in this paper
(Daily, Dec. 2). While the writer obviously must have
done some research, as he did quote lowa students, I
believe that, in the future, your readers would appre
ciate a more professional attitude toward your jour
nalistic endeavors.

It's true that people from the West Coast might see
many parts of lowa as backward — having lived in
lowa for two years after growing up in Portland, Ore.,
I am definitely in a position to know this. lowa City,
however, is the last place in lowa anyone could con
sider a hick town, as the story seemed to suggest.
The article talks about the writer's big night on the
town in lowa City, at such "local hot spots" as Round
Table Pizza and Burger King Give me a break lowa
City is a college town — in one eight-block radius it
has easily five times the number of fun restaurants

and bars as Palo Alto and Menlo Park put together.
This article also poked fun at the "original" names
connected with the University of lowa, such as "lowa
City" and the "lowa Memorial Union." Look around
— Stanford University boasts both "Memorial
Church" and "Memorial Auditorium," not to mention
the "Stanford Bookstore." How often does one
criticize our school's originality?
Additionally, the article seemed to be centered
around the question of whether or not people in
lowa know about Stanford. (Apparently suggesting
that anyone who doesn't know about Stanford is
really a hick. Please, school pride is one thing, but
egotism is another.) Perhaps the writer should con
sider the number of people at Stanford who know
much about lowa — let me tell you, it's pretty small. I
don't know how many times I've been asked, "lowa
— that's in the East, isn't it?" Even more common is,
"Do you live on a farm?"
Now, I'm not suggesting that Stanford students
should know anything about lowa — lowa probably
directly affects very few Stanford lives. The converse,
however, is probably true, too — as much as some
would like to think Stanford is the center of the uni
verse, our school probably directly affects very few

lowans. Why, therefore, should these lowa students
know much about a school in California, when Cali
fornia students know so little about an entire state in
the Midwest?
Sadly, even after writing an entire article about
lowa City, the writer himself seems to be one of
these ill-informed Stanford students. The article
closed with a play on words about our "Farm," and
the farms on which "most students" at the University
of lowa grew up. I'm sure the writer meant to be
witty, but knowing that numerous lowa students
come from substantial cities such as Dubuque, Cedar
Rapids and Des Moines, in addition to the large
percentage of lowa students from the Chicago area,
I'm afraid the little pun just doesn't cut it.
I'm sorry if I'm being a little too strong — I really
don't mean to be overly harsh Stanford is a great
place, and lowa can seem a bit backwards. However,
in the future, please bear in mind that a little more
research and a slightly more open-minded attitude
might make future attempts at journalism a bit more
professional
