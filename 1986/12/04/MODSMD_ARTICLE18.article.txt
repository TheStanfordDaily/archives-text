Branner is nice;
Flo Mo is, too
Charlie Gofen's most recent en
deavor (Daily, Dec. 2) exhibited some
amazingly unsound attitudes, and it
engaged in mass "dorm libel." We
refer, of course, to his deification of
"The Branner Experience" and all it
entails.
We should start off by saying that
we have nothing against Branner and
that the problem lies in the character
Gofen assigns it. In essence, Flo Mo
loses because it is sensitive to the
problem of sexism, while Branner
wins because it plays pranks and
parties 'til 4 a.m. Flo Mo students go
to class (Gofen mentions SLE, some
thing he obviously knows very little
about) while Branner produces IM
gods. Ignoring the distortion of facts
for a moment, what does this say
about Gofen's attitudes toward Res
Ed? That Branner also brings "riveting
speakers'' is almost an addendum to a
picture of the dorm as a hard-partying,
high status, concentrated group for
socially adept frosh.
And then there are the facts. Who
needs this either/or attitude? Consider
some reality: Paloma sent two teams
to the IM football playoffs this year
(with a contingent of SLE players); Flo
Mo parties are creative and extremely
well attended (Paloma credits itself
with a wine tasting, an ice cream
social and a carefully considered
screw-your-roommate semi-formal)
and Flo Mo spirit at football games
was anything but dull. Meanwhile,
SLE's presence only adds to the
dorm's strong intellectual atmosphere,
an atmosphere encouraged by the
broad range of programming our
large size allows us.
All this is not to fall into the trap of
setting up some kind of dorm compe
tition; the point is that Gofen's lousy
freshman experience shouldn't set the
standard for the "ideal frosh living
arrangement."

Decision deserves
reconsideration
We wish to register our disappoint
ment with the decision to close the
Stanford campus in Vienna and note
the lack of wider consultation with
both students and faculty before the
decision was made.
It is our conviction that an attempt
should have been made to restructure
the program in order to increase
student interest and to make the
progran more viable for the late
1980s.
We hope the administration will
reconsider the decision before it
becomes an irrevocable fact.
