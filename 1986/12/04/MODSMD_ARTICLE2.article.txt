# Pub's future hopeful
## 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
Although the 'specifics of manage
ment are still uncertain, the future of
Stanford's on-campus pub "looks
good," according to student or
ganizers.
The pub, Cardinal Sin, was opened
on a trial basis for two weeks earlier
this quarter. Vip Tolat, vice president
of the Graduate Students Association
(GSA), said the trial run was successful.
The GSA planned and operated Card
inal Sin with assistance from Tresidder
Union Food Service and Saga Corpora
tion.
"We were hoping to break even, and
we did," Tolat said. "The pub was not
supposed to be a profit-making
venture." Tolat said he and Larry Les
sard, chair of the GSA's Pub Commit
tee, were "about 80 percent done with
a cost analysis" of the operation.
One purpose of the trial period was
"to see if a need exists" for an on
campus pub, Tolat said. "People liked
having a place to go to have some
cheap drinks and a good time," he
said.
But Tolat said the specifics of the
pub's. future management* are
"uncertain.
"Larry and I don't have the time to
ran and time is running OCT to hire a
management team," he said. Other
GSA members or an independent man
agement team may take over operation
of the pub in the future, according to
Tolat.
Lessard said that if the pub were
managed by members of the GSA, it
would probably be open only one
night per week.
If a student manager or management
team were hired, however, Cardinal
Sin would be open four or five nights
per week, Tolat said.
COP member Carey White said he
thinks looking for a student manage
ment team "is the right way to go.
Maybe some students from the Busi
ness School or some undergraduates
would want to do it,"he said.
White also mentioned the possibility
of the pub receiving ASSU funding. "If
they (the organizers of the pub) need
it bad enough, then we'll come
through," he said.
This quarter, the 24 employees of
the pub were paid minimum wage, ac
cording to Tolat. To continue operat
ing the pub, the GSA "is going to need
some kind of subsidies," he said.
