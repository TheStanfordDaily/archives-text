## Stan Getz blows a cool jazz note 
### MONICA SIMMS 
After 40 years of playing the tenor
sax, Stan Getz knows what jazz is all
about.
He has toured the world with some
of history's most talented jazz artists in
cluding Woody Herman, Benny Good
man, Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie.
He has been ranked among the
country's top jazz musicians in several
polls including Down Beat,
Metronome and Playboy. His distinct
sound and expertise have earned him
recognition as one of the world's finest
jazz musicians.
Getz is now sharing his years of ex
perience with students at Stanford.
Since January, he has been the artist-in
residence in the Music Department's
Jazz Program.
Thursday morning, Getz guest
lectured a music history class that met
in Campbell Recital Hall. He told the
35 students, "Jazz is really the story of
this country, this great democracy. It
was created 80 years ago by blacks who
were a very oppressed people, provid
ing them with an open means of ex
pression.
"1 never tell my guys what to play or
how to play it. Like in a democracy,
they have the freedom to express
themselves."
Getz paused for a moment. Wearing
a blue and white striped rugby shirt
and tan chinos, and full of energy
despite his years (which will number
60 in February), he suddenly grinned.
"They can play it however they
want," he said, "as long as it's my way!"
Everyone in the room laughed, includ
ing Getz.
But there is some truth to the joke.
People who have worked with him in
the past agree that Getz is one of the
best jazz musicians in the world, but
say he is very stubborn and difficult to
work with.

A few years back, Bruce Lundvall,
president of the Blue Note label, and
the former president of Columbia
Records, said Getz "can be a pain in
the ass, because he won't compromise
at a time when some jazz artists are
scoring, and scoring big In the com
mercial marketplace."
Recently Jerome Reese, a writer for
Musician magazine, also gave Getz's
personality less-than-raVe reviews.
"I have a friend who used to play
with Getz in the 705," he said. "He says
Stan is very moody, a very prickly char
acter. Recently, Getz tried to record
with Chet Baker.... The two just
couldn't get along."
In some ways, Getz is a perfectionist,
which may explain why he has had dif
ficulty working with musicians in the
past. "Music is my life," he said, "and I
have always been driven by a taut inner
spring which has propelled me almost
compulsively to reach for perfection in
music, often — in fact, mostly — at the
expense of everything else in my life."
Reese said, "It's amazing that some
one who has such problems in his per
sonal relations makes such great
music. But he does." He added that, in
recent years, Getz has been making
some of the best recordings in his
career.
Getz has made dozens of albums, in
cluding his first, "The Long Island
Sound"; "Getz/Gilberto," which
featured his 1964 Grammy award win
ning song, "The Girl from Ipanema";
and "Pure Getz," recorded in 1982 on
the Concord label. His most recent al
bum, "Voyage," was recorded this year
in Menlo Park on the Blackhawk label.
Mark Rowland, West Coast editor of
Musician, which is owned by Billboard
magazine, said "Voyage" has been on
the charts for seven weeks and is fi
nally dropping off.
"It's not a spectacular showing, but
it's not a poor one either. You have to

remember," Rowland said, "his tradi
tional jazz style is not as commercial as
fusion or rock.
"During the '60s, Getz experi
mented with modern jazz musicians
like Chick Corea, Dave Holland and
Jack Dejohnette, which caused quite a
stir in the jazz community.
"But in the 70s, he decided to go
back to the old Stan Getz. Since then,"
Rowland said, "he's been playing bet
ter than ever."

Getz said he wants to spend the next
few years developing the jazz program
at Stanford. He said the program,
which is in its second year now, is
coming along, but "more slowly than I
had hoped. I think it'll go, but it's
gonna take a lot of work."
Getz also has plans to open a jazz
club in Palo Alto. In 1958, he opened a
club in Copenhagen called the

Montmartre.
"In the '60s and 70s, it was the club
in Scandinavia," said Reese. "Lots of fa
mous jazz artists recorded live there,
like Chet Baker and Dexter Gordon."
Reese said it is still the most popular
club in Scandinavia, and one of the
most popular clubs in Europe.
Getz is also working on his autobi
ography. He said it is coming along
slowly, and he is not sure when it will
be finished.
"It's a bad time, right now," he said
grimly, referring to his progress on the
book. "My dog is ill, and I'm afraid he
may die soon." Getz's dog, James, is 14
years old and, true to the adage, is one
of Getz's best friends.
Getz livened up as he recounted the

time when, while living in San Fran
cisco a few years ago, he was taking a
shower and heard James fighting in the
street with another dog. Getz looked
out of the bathroom window and saw
his Labrador entangled with a large
German shepherd.
Without even thinking, Getz ran
outside and pried James from the
other dog, receiving scrapes and
bruises all over his completely naked
body, much to the astonishment of
several neighbors.
Getz's blue eyes sparked as he
laughed for a moment. Then he
stopped. His countenance fell, and he
said seriously, "It's a bad time now. But
I'm still working on the book, and I'm
still working on my music. I guess I'll
keep working on my music as long as I
love it. As long as I'm physically able."
A stubborn man, that Getz.

street with another dog. Getz looked
out of the bathroom window and saw
his Labrador entangled with a large
German shepherd.
Without even thinking, Getz ran
outside and pried James from the
other dog, receiving scrapes and
bruises all over his completely naked
body, much to the astonishment of
several neighbors.
Getz's blue eyes sparked as he
laughed for a moment. Then he
stopped. His countenance fell, and he
said seriously, "It's a bad time now. But
I'm still working on the book, and I'm
still working on my music. I guess I'll
keep working on my music as long as I
love it. As long as I'm physically able."
A stubborn man, that Getz.
Lucky for us.
After 40 years of playing the tenor
sax, Stan Getz knows what jazz is all
about.
He has toured the world with some
of history's most talented jazz artists in
cluding Woody Herman, Benny Good
man, Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie.
He has been ranked among the
country's top jazz musicians in several
polls including Down Beat,
Metronome and Playboy. His distinct
sound and expertise have earned him
recognition as one of the world's finest
jazz musicians.
Getz is now sharing his years of ex
perience with students at Stanford.
Since January, he has been the artist-in
residence in the Music Department's
Jazz Program.
Thursday morning, Getz guest
lectured a music history class that met
in Campbell Recital Hall. He told the
35 students, "Jazz is really the story of
this country, this great democracy. It
was created 80 years ago by blacks who
were a very oppressed people, provid
ing them with an open means of ex
pression.
"1 never tell my guys what to play or
how to play it. Like in a democracy,
they have the freedom to express
themselves."
Getz paused for a moment. Wearing
a blue and white striped rugby shirt
and tan chinos, and full of energy
despite his years (which will number
60 in February), he suddenly grinned.
"They can play it however they
want," he said, "as long as it's my way!"
Everyone in the room laughed, includ
ing Getz.
But there is some truth to the joke.
People who have worked with him in
the past agree that Getz is one of the
best jazz musicians in the world, but
say he is very stubborn and difficult to
work with.

A few years back, Bruce Lundvall,
president of the Blue Note label, and
the former president of Columbia
Records, said Getz "can be a pain in
the ass, because he won't compromise
at a time when some jazz artists are
scoring, and scoring big In the com
mercial marketplace."
Recently Jerome Reese, a writer for
Musician magazine, also gave Getz's
personality less-than-raVe reviews.
"I have a friend who used to play
with Getz in the 705," he said. "He says
Stan is very moody, a very prickly char
acter. Recently, Getz tried to record
with Chet Baker.... The two just
couldn't get along."
In some ways, Getz is a perfectionist,
which may explain why he has had dif
ficulty working with musicians in the
past. "Music is my life," he said, "and I
have always been driven by a taut inner
spring which has propelled me almost
compulsively to reach for perfection in
music, often — in fact, mostly — at the
expense of everything else in my life."
Reese said, "It's amazing that some
one who has such problems in his per
sonal relations makes such great
music. But he does." He added that, in
recent years, Getz has been making
some of the best recordings in his
career.
Getz has made dozens of albums, in
cluding his first, "The Long Island
Sound"; "Getz/Gilberto," which
featured his 1964 Grammy award win
ning song, "The Girl from Ipanema";
and "Pure Getz," recorded in 1982 on
the Concord label. His most recent al
bum, "Voyage," was recorded this year
in Menlo Park on the Blackhawk label.
Mark Rowland, West Coast editor of
Musician, which is owned by Billboard
magazine, said "Voyage" has been on
the charts for seven weeks and is fi
nally dropping off.
"It's not a spectacular showing, but
it's not a poor one either. You have to

remember," Rowland said, "his tradi
tional jazz style is not as commercial as
fusion or rock.
"During the '60s, Getz experi
mented with modern jazz musicians
like Chick Corea, Dave Holland and
Jack Dejohnette, which caused quite a
stir in the jazz community.
"But in the 70s, he decided to go
back to the old Stan Getz. Since then,"
Rowland said, "he's been playing bet
ter than ever."

Getz said he wants to spend the next
few years developing the jazz program
at Stanford. He said the program,
which is in its second year now, is
coming along, but "more slowly than I
had hoped. I think it'll go, but it's
gonna take a lot of work."
Getz also has plans to open a jazz
club in Palo Alto. In 1958, he opened a
club in Copenhagen called the

Montmartre.
"In the '60s and 70s, it was the club
in Scandinavia," said Reese. "Lots of fa
mous jazz artists recorded live there,
like Chet Baker and Dexter Gordon."
Reese said it is still the most popular
club in Scandinavia, and one of the
most popular clubs in Europe.
Getz is also working on his autobi
ography. He said it is coming along
slowly, and he is not sure when it will
be finished.
"It's a bad time, right now," he said
grimly, referring to his progress on the
book. "My dog is ill, and I'm afraid he
may die soon." Getz's dog, James, is 14
years old and, true to the adage, is one
of Getz's best friends.
Getz livened up as he recounted the

time when, while living in San Fran
cisco a few years ago, he was taking a
shower and heard James fighting in the
street with another dog. Getz looked
