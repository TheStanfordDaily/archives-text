Mistletoe. Eggnog. Plastic trees.
Grandparents who never seem to
realize that you stopped growing three
years ago. Giving your father another
bottle of cologne: the things that make
the Christmas season special.
For Stanford students, one more
item must be added to this list: Secret
Santas, a tradition every bit as sacred as
the ceremonial lighting of the Advent
candles.
Being a Secret Santa entails drop
ping a slip of paper with your name
into a participating RA's hat, and then
drawing a name, usually belonging to a
member of the opposite sex, once the
hat is full. You deliver gifts to that per
son every day for week. At the end of
the week, you reveal yourself and a
friendship, if not more, is established
or at least greatly fortified.
To remain anonymous until the ap
propriate time, the undercover St.
Nicks must enlist the services of
friends to deliver the gifts for them.
These helpers are called "elves" in
serious Santa circles, and their role in
the grand scheme is paramount â€”
without them, dorms would be
teeming with gift-laden Cardinal stu
dents, donning white beards, deliver
ing their goodies at three in the morn
ing to avoid being identified.
By performing the deliveries, the
elves allow the Santas to please their
Santa-ees without ruining their own
night's sleep, something any good
Santa will avoid with final exams just a
few carols away.
Since the elves are often visible to
the ones receiving the gifts, the Santas
must be careful in choosing them. A
thoughtful Santa will use an elf who
lives on a different hall to distract the
focus of anyone trying to discover his
or her identity.

The gifts themselves are often the
most interesting aspect of the whole
program. They range from the cute
and sincere to the gross and bizarre,
but they are always given with the
warmest intentions of holiday cheer.
One of the most common gifts from
Santas involve poems of extremely
dubious artistic merit. They are invari
ably arranged in a simple rhyme
scheme, and more often than not
begin with some bastardization of the
old "Roses are red, violets blue"
theme.
Door decorations, often including
Christmas lights, are also a favorite
among Santas, and they serve the
added purpose of promoting the over
all Yuletide atmosphere in the dorm.
Other gifts are often much less taste
ful, but they convey a concern for one's
fellow mankind just the same. For ex
ample, legend has it that last year one
eager Santa snuck into a dormmate's
room, stole two pairs of her under
wear, froze them in blocks of ice, then
hung them over her door the next day.
Ho, ho, ho.
Some gifts have great comic value,
even if they have little else. Toyon RA
Lori Adams remembers last year, when
her roommate's Santa delivered, on
consecutive days, a cinder block, a
trashed bicycle, a live rooster and a
seven-year-old boy. The spirit of giving
abounds.
Frequently, Santas use the occasion
as an opportunity to embarrass their
recipients. They might have an elf or
group of elves present a gift during
dinner, a ceremony that usually in
cludes physical displays of affection.
Another public gift that is a favorite
among creative Santas is getting the
professor of a recipient's class to call
the person forward and do something
acutely embarrassing to him or her,
