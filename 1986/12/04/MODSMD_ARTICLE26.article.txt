# Salubrious Santas spread secretly

Mistletoe. Eggnog. Plastic trees.
Grandparents who never seem to
realize that you stopped growing three
years ago. Giving your father another
bottle of cologne: the things that make
the Christmas season special.
For Stanford students, one more
item must be added to this list: Secret
Santas, a tradition every bit as sacred as
the ceremonial lighting of the Advent
candles.
Being a Secret Santa entails drop
ping a slip of paper with your name
into a participating RA's hat, and then
drawing a name, usually belonging to a
member of the opposite sex, once the
hat is full. You deliver gifts to that per
son every day for week. At the end of
the week, you reveal yourself and a
friendship, if not more, is established
or at least greatly fortified.
To remain anonymous until the ap
propriate time, the undercover St.
Nicks must enlist the services of
friends to deliver the gifts for them.
These helpers are called "elves" in
serious Santa circles, and their role in
the grand scheme is paramount —
without them, dorms would be
teeming with gift-laden Cardinal stu
dents, donning white beards, deliver
ing their goodies at three in the morn
ing to avoid being identified.
By performing the deliveries, the
elves allow the Santas to please their
Santa-ees without ruining their own
night's sleep, something any good
Santa will avoid with final exams just a
few carols away.
Since the elves are often visible to
the ones receiving the gifts, the Santas
must be careful in choosing them. A
thoughtful Santa will use an elf who
lives on a different hall to distract the
focus of anyone trying to discover his
or her identity.

The gifts themselves are often the
most interesting aspect of the whole
program. They range from the cute
and sincere to the gross and bizarre,
but they are always given with the
warmest intentions of holiday cheer.
One of the most common gifts from
Santas involve poems of extremely
dubious artistic merit. They are invari
ably arranged in a simple rhyme
scheme, and more often than not
begin with some bastardization of the
old "Roses are red, violets blue"
theme.
Door decorations, often including
Christmas lights, are also a favorite
among Santas, and they serve the
added purpose of promoting the over
all Yuletide atmosphere in the dorm.
Other gifts are often much less taste
ful, but they convey a concern for one's
fellow mankind just the same. For ex
ample, legend has it that last year one
eager Santa snuck into a dormmate's
room, stole two pairs of her under
wear, froze them in blocks of ice, then
hung them over her door the next day.
Ho, ho, ho.
Some gifts have great comic value,
even if they have little else. Toyon RA
Lori Adams remembers last year, when
her roommate's Santa delivered, on
consecutive days, a cinder block, a
trashed bicycle, a live rooster and a
seven-year-old boy. The spirit of giving
abounds.
Frequently, Santas use the occasion
as an opportunity to embarrass their
recipients. They might have an elf or
group of elves present a gift during
dinner, a ceremony that usually in
cludes physical displays of affection.
Another public gift that is a favorite
among creative Santas is getting the
professor of a recipient's class to call
the person forward and do something
acutely embarrassing to him or her,
like reading a special Christmas
message or giving a girl a flower.
"Some professors won't do it (give a
Secret Santa message), but a lot of
them really get into it,"says Adams.
"It's hilarious to watch, a spectacle."
Some gifts solicit a more favorable
reaction than others, especially when
the gift is from male to female. For in
stance, upon receiving a red rose from
her Santa, one student was heard to
say, "Oooh — what a stud!"
The major financial beneficiary of
the Secret Santa syndrome is the Stan
ford Bookstore. Within, three tables
are lined up along the aisle with stock
ings, gift bags and small gifts to provide
the Santas with a convenient source of
cute presents.
Lois Kleinkauf, the buyer for the
Bookstore, anticipates the need for
such knickknacks in July, when she or
ders for the Christmas season. She also
tries to provide merchandise to match
the limited budgets of the Santas.
Kleinkauf notes that Secret Santas
mean big business: Tuesday's sales
were about one-third higher than the
daily average. Any afternoon during
the Santa weeks will find the
Bookstore crowded with undercover

agents of goodwill searching for the
perfect gifts to fill the stockings.
The Bookstore candy counter in par
ticular attracts many Santas. Strategi
cally located in the middle of the store,
the counter is ringed by various small
sweets that make perfect stocking stuf
fers. Obviously, the Secret Santas feel
the need to prepare stomachs for the
onslaught of sweet and fattening foods
that inevitably comes with the holiday
season.
The Secret Santa season allows stu
dents to do something nice for some
one else, in turn making them feel
good about themselves. Furthermore,
receiving gifts can mean the difference
between sanity and total collapse
during preparation for finals.
Not everyone, however, appreciates
the value of Secret Santa-ing. Says non
participant freshman Jacek Majewski,
"Bah, hum bug."
Most students, on the other hand,
feel Secret Santas are wonderful and
are excited about participating.
Proponent Sid Heaton summed up the
majority sentiment about the program:
"When your last mid-term is the
morning after the KA 'Nar Bight Final,'
and your roommate mourns the death
of collegiate social conscience until 2
a.m., what you really need is a good
dose of your Secret Santa, the fresh
man says.
