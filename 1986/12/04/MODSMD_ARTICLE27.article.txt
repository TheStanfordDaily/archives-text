# Mission: to protect and serve

"Calling Q-l. Please come in. A
group of people have entered the am
phitheater. I think they have some
booze. Check it out. Over."
Q-l gulps down the remnants of his
coffee, grabs the radio on which he
received the message and jumps into
his waiting car. It's midnight, and there
is very little traffic on the campus
roads.
Earlier in the evening he had con
firmed that the car's equipment was in
place. Now, as he races toward Stan
ford's Frost Amphitheater, the sight of
the shotgun, standing by the front seat,
seems somehow reassuring.
Being a deputy patrolman with the
Stanford Police Department is not an
easy job. It involves late hours, abnor
mally large doses of caffeine and all the
stress that goes with the responsibility
of protecting a community. But it is a
job that Q-l, alias Theodore "Ted"
Hopgood, says he loves.
He should know. He has been with
the police department at Stanford for
13 years.
"I have seen so many kids go
through this school," he reflects.
"They're like my kids. It's my duty to
stop them from straying."
Sergeant Christopher Lefferts con
firms Hopgood's deep sense of com
mitment to the community. "He cares a
lot and will do anything you ask him
to."
There are many frustrations that go

with the job. Officer Harris Kuhn talks
of the public ridicule to which police
officers are often subjected.
We tend to feel very isolated within
the community," he says.
Lefferts confirms this, saying police
officers are often hated because they
issue driving tickets. Yet, he says, "We
do it because we care about saving
lives."
Hopgood accepts the public distaste
for his profession with grace.
"Sometimes when I'm out having a
drink at a bar, I run into someone I've
given a ticket to. And he sneers, Here's
a cop.' I just burn inside but keep
smiling," he says.
Hopgood began his career as a mili
tary policeman. In September 1966, he
left the army and joined Lockheed
Missiles and Space Company, Inc. Hop
good is tight-lipped when he talks
about his job at Lockheed, saying he
was involved with "high priority secur
ity."
In 1973, he entered a police
academy. He recalls that he was one of
the oldest people in his class. "I had to
go through all the basic training, and
believe me, the strenuous exercise
hurt like hell." Yet he has never
regretted his decision.
He remembers the high spots of his
career, such as when he saved a baby
from crib death by giving him on-the
spot resuscitation. His dark brown eyes
crinkle as he breaks into a broad grin.
"The baby is alive and well, and I
sometimes see him on campus."

Not all his experiences have been so
happy. He takes a deep breath and
lowers his voice as he remembers one
particular automobile accident. "Three
kids cut off in the prime of their lives.
And there was nothing I could do.
That's something you live with forever,
the memory never fades."
But Hopgood is not depressed for
long. His familiar grin returns when he
talks about his family. His eldest son,
Mark, has followed his father's
footsteps and has joined the army. His
daughter, Opal, is a working mother in
New York and is currently, "on a cruise
somewhere in the Caribbean."
Although Hopgood tries to leave his
work at the office, it does sometimes
intrude into his family.
Working on shifts means "you have
to be available all 24 hours. Special
events in the family often have to take a
back seat. But you do have a job to do,
and that's what's important," he says.
According to Hopgood, a police offi

cer must have good judgment. A good
officer must be able to sense when
someone he's stopped is going to
become belligerent. This is especially
true among teenage males trying to
show off in front of their girlfriends, he
says. At this point, Hopgood usually
turns tough so he can quell a possible
confrontation.
Yet his friend Kuhn says, "Ted rarely
insults suspects. He has no airs and is
very human."
Sohaila Abdulali, a journalism
graduate student, recalls an encounter
with Hopgood. She had entered a one
way street from the wrong side when
she was asked to pull over by the
police car behind her. Her consterna
tion was further compounded by the
fact that she could not immediately
find her license.

you've just done because you know
