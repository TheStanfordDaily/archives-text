Changing of the guard
While Stanford prepares for a temporary change in
leadership during President Kennedy's winter quar
ter sabbatical, the University of Notre Dame in South
Bend, Indiana is girding for a more long-term pass
ing of power.
Notre Dame President Rev. Theodore Hesburgh is
stepping down next May after a 35-year tenure
during which both Notre Dame and Hesburgh rose
to national prominence and respect.
Succeeding Hesburgh as president of Notre Dame
is probably roughly akin to following Knute Rockne
as the coach of the Fighting Irish football team.
But Hesburgh's designated successor is taking
things in stride.
"I don't intend to replace a legend," says the Rev.
Edward A Malloy, who will officially become Notre
Dame's president after next spring's commencement
exercises. "I'm not going to try to be Father Hes
burgh. I'm just going to be myself and surround
myself with the kind of people who can make it go."
Observers speculate that Malloy's leadership style
will contrast sharply with that of Hesburgh.
Father Hesburgh is described as "a forceful and
charismatic personality who rules with a strong and
confident hand." He is lauded for being decisive,
venturesome and imaginative. Some Notre Dame fac
ulty members, however, criticize him for making uni
lateral decisions.
Father Malloy, by contrast, is a theologian, who is
described most often as "friendly, thoughtful, low
key, and even-tempered, with a wry sense of humor.
He is said to be a good listener and is well-liked, es
pecially by students. It is expected that his presidency
will be marked by a more deliberative, consultative
style.
"I suspect his style will differ in the sense that it
will be slower-moving in his concern to be open to
discussion and know what everyone wants before
making a decision," says the Rev. Richard Mcßrien,
chairman of Notre Dame's Theology Department.
Father Malloy was chosen from a group of five can
didates, all priests. Notre Dame bylaws stipulate that
the university's president must be a member of the
Indiana province of the Congregation of the Holy
Cross. Father Hesburgh tried to retire five years ago
but was asked to stay on when board members found

no Holy Cross priest with the necessary experience
for the job.
Soon thereafter, five priests, including Malloy,
were selected to be readied for the presidency and
were placed in responsible administration positions.
Currently the university's associate provost, Malloy
attended Notre Dame on a basketball scholarship
(one of his high school teammates was current
Georgetown basketball Coach John Thompson) and
still plays full-court games with students twice a
week.
Malloy says he would like to "establish a listening
mode" after he takes over leadership of the univer
sity.
"I use the image of a peripatetic presidency — I
want to walk around and mingle as much as I can,"
he explains. "I see this as a prime oportunity for es
tablishing a collegial, cooperative style and building
on the good will that exists and has been manifest in
the reaction to my appointment."
A ray of Pope
Stanford gets Dr. Ruth. Arizona State gets the Pope.
Pope John Paul II will celebrate a Mass in ASU's
Sun Devil Stadium as part of his visit to the southern
and western United States next September, accord
ing to a story in the ASU State Press student newspa
per.
The stadium was approved as the site of the Mass
by the local Catholic diocese and a Vatican delega
tion, mainly because of its size, according to Robert
Ellis, associate vice president for University Relations.
"I would guess you would have to have a large
place for a Mass of that kind," Ellis said. "There are
not many places (in the area) to do that."
The stadium holds about 71,000 people for foot
ball games and can accomodate more if the playing
field is used for seating.
Arizona State has graciously offered to lease the
stadium to the Vatican at its standard rental rate.
The prospect of the Pope's visit has been greeted
with enthusiasm by local Christian, Moslem and
Jewish leaders.
"Obviously, I'm delighted that he's coming," says
ASU English prof. John Evans, a member of the New
man Center (Catholic) Parish. "The visit would dem
onstrate Pope John Paul's pastoral concern for the

Catholics of Arizona and give him an opportunity to
express his affection for everyone in the area —
Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jews and agnostics."
The former president of the Islamic Cultural Cen
ter in Tempe, Rauf Diab, also lauded the visit.
"We welcome his visit," Diab said. "We have lots of
respect for the pope. Where Catholicism and Islam
have gotten along well is in the area of Israel and the
Palestinians. The Church has really been supportive
of a settlement and the rights of the Palestinians.
Rabbi Barton Lee, director of the Hillel Union of
Jewish Students at ASU, wasn't particularly excited
about the Pope's views on Israel and the Palestinians,
but he still approved of the Pope's visit.
"I hope he enjoys our Arizona sunshine," Lee said.
"He should be welcome, and the people should en
joy his visit."
No doubt the Pontiff will bask in the Arizona sun,
but he'll certainly be no Sun Devil.
Religion and Politics
Meanwhile, back at Notre Dame, Jerry Falwell
came a-visiting.
Rev. Falwell spoke at Notre Dame early last month
and predicted that religious involvement in political
issues is "here to stay."
Falwell, leader of the Virginia-based Liberty Foun
dation group, also said that fundamentalist Christians
are now part of the mainstream. He compared the
Moral Majority's activism to black civil rights leaders
of the 19605, noting that many of the civil rights
leaders were ministers.
"Now, the black church is accepted. By the end of
the 1980s, we'll be seen in the same way," he said.
Falwell said no political candidate could claim
God's support.
"To claim that God tells someone to run for office
is incredible," he said. "I've never heard His voice —
I've read his Bible, but I've never heard His voice."
Falwell's speech was well-received by the crowd of
500, some of whom waited two hours in 12 degree
weather to hear him.
The only heckling came when Falwell, in describ
ing a Liberty University athlete, said the star football
player "is a white boy, that's pretty unusual to see
