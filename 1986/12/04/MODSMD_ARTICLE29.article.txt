## Soviet team examines U.S. 
### CALISA COLE 
A Soviet research team distributed a questionnaire to
Stanford taculrv in October as part of a project concerned
with Soviet studies courses in the United States.
Political Science and History Prof Alexander Dallin said
the questionnaire did not ask the kind of questions that
would "invite a balanced view."
He added that the researchers met with some scholars in
person, which may provide them with a more complete
picture. *
The two-man research team visited Stanford and other
campuses around the country to question scholars about
the teaching of Soviet studies in the United States.
Using an opinion poll as a basis for study is uncommon
among Soviet scholars, and "shows thev are trying to learn
from the Americans," Dallin said.
The questionnaire, which indicated that a program on
"Soviet Studies in the U.S-A is underway, was circulated at
colleges, including Stanford, UC-Berkeley and Columbia
University.
One of 10 questions on the questionnaire asked if the
study of the Soviet Union and Russia in the United States
could be a negative influence on American-Soviet relations.
Another question inquired about prejudice toward the So
viet Union bv American scholars.

The questionnaire mentioned the "conservative tide in
the United States" and asked if it would influence how So
viet studies courses are taught in American universities. The
final question asked if "positive understanding .. leading to
mutually satis factors- relations" between the United States
and the Soviet Union is possible, and how it can be
promoted.
George Breslauer, associate professor of political science
at Berkeley, said the quality of responses to the poll would
determine its value to the Soviets.
"If people are conscientious, and (the researchers) get 60
to 70 responses, they could get a good view of currents of
thought among U.S. Sovietologists," Breslauer said. "But if
they're looking to see what is going to influence the
(Reagan) administration, they probably won't find that out.
"Their findings will be restricted by how many people
respond, and how seriously they take it,"he added.
Dallin noted that some scholars might not complete the
questionnaire because they are of Russian descent, or be
cause they don't consider the poll to be a "promising or
worthwhile enterprise."
During their month-long tour of the United States, the
two Soviets visited Columbia, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins,
Stanford, Berkeley, the Center for the Study of Soviet Inter
national Behavior in Santa Monica, and Princeton, among
other institutions.
