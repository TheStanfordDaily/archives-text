# Stanford may alter grad. student aid

### LORI SILVER 
In response to the new tax laws
going into effect Jan. 1, the Financial
Aids Office is considering changing
its policies to help graduate students
shoulder the burden of increased
taxes, according to Elizabeth
Traugott, vice provost and dean of
Graduate Studies.
Traugott and Chris Griffith, assis
tant director of Graduate Residences,
spoke to approximately 20 graduate
students in Crothers Memorial
Lounge last night on increases in
graduate student taxes and priorities
for graduate student housing.
Traugott said it was "a little
premature" to make any definite
promises concerning a change in fin
ancial aid policy, but a decision
would be made in "a few weeks.
"We would like to help in covering
the tax, but all kinds of concerns have
to be worked through," she said.
"We have to think of the trade-offs.
If we start covering taxes for students
here, we might possibly lower the
number of incoming students
The new tax law will have the
greatest impact on graduate students
who are teaching assistants and resi

dent assistants, Traugott said. Be
cause the Internal Revenue Service
views TAs and RAs as receiving
money for a service which is not a re
quired part of their education,
graduate students in these positions
will face a great increase in taxes.
"Everyone would like their taxes
paid, and we certainly would like to
pay them but it's very complicated,"
Traugott said.
Traugott said the major question is
the extent to which the University
will cover graduate student taxes.
"We're looking at all kinds of pos
sibilities. We're looking at trying to
help with the taxes, and we're
looking to departments," she said.
One solution under consideration
is raising graduate student stipends
in order to increase student incomes
enough to cover the taxes.
But this solution would have many
negative side effects including lower
ing income to the departments and
reducing the number of graduate stu
dents, according to Traugott.
Because there is only a fixed
amount of grant money coming in, if
we raise the stipend, there will be
less money to spend over a certain
number of students. The effect could

possibly be a reduction of new stu
dent intake," she said.
Traugott stressed that the Univer
sity wanted to maintain the maximum
number of graduate students without
"wiping out department programs."
Reiterating information contained
in a Nov. 10 memo to all master's, en
gineering and doctoral students,
Traugott stated that all students on
fellowships which were offered prior
to Aug. 17, 1986 are tax-exempt for
this academic year.
The University has already set up. a
special assistance program to meet

the needs ot students who will have
problems paying the new taxes, ac
cording to the Nov. 10 memo. Stu
dents who fall into this category
should first contact their department
or the Graduate Awards Office.
Griffith also fielded questions con
cerning priority for graduate student
housing at the meeting.
Students complained that first year
graduate students are placed at the
top of the housing list reguardless of
when their applications are submit
ted. Griffth said she will check on the
issue.
