# X-mas tree drive begins
## 
### JOHN SHAW 
Inviting all Stanford students to come and "share the
spirit," the Stanford Volunteer Network will launch a
Christmas tree donation drive on Dec. 18 as pan of its
Holiday Sharing Drive.
The volunteer network has already completed two of
the three events scheduled for this year's drive: a collec
tion and distribution of holiday gift boxes for families in
East Palo Alto and an annual fast, co-sponsored with the
Stanford International Development Organization. The
proceeds of the fast will go to various international de
velopment projects such as OXFAM America and to the
Ecumenical Hunger Program, one of several group proj
ects sponsored by the network.
Both programs proved to be successful. Nearly 95 per
cent of the dormitories on campus as well as many aca
demic departments submitted gift boxes and hundreds
of people participated in the fast.
The Christmas tree donation drive is scheduled to take
place on Dec. 18, between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Members of
the Stanford community are being encouraged to bring
their decorated trees to the lawn of Owen House before
Christmas break, instead of throwing them out. The trees
will be used to light up the homes of those who cannot
afford their own trees.

Megan Swezev. volunteer coordinator at the Public
Service Center, predicts the Volunteer Network "will
receive every single tree on campus.... Why shouldn't
we?"
The Volunteer Network, a student organization
founded in 1984, was designed to promote community
service and to serve as a liason to outside public service
groups by organizing community projects. The organiza
tion is run by 10 student directors, who work with 12
group project leaders and a community service repre
sentative from each dormitory on campus.
According to Swezev, a recent alumna who worked for
the network as an undergraduate, the network is a place
where "people can find ways to make public service fit
into their academic and career g0a15.... It is one of the
only times in life when most people will be able to have
this type of fulfilling experience — to be able to get off
campus and really get involved in the community."
For Swezev, the network is one of the few places at
Stanford where "people can come up with their own
idea and watch it happen." People with busy schedules
can take on smaller projects, which are most rewarding.
Swezev said.
Senior Tern Pitts, group project director for the net-
work, said the network offers a chance
to make real changes and help people
in the community. Pitts said he is com
mitted to improving the image of
public service at Stanford.
Upcoming events include a blood
drive on Jan. 12,1987 and a showing of
a speech Martin Luther King made at
Stanford in the 1960s later that week.
