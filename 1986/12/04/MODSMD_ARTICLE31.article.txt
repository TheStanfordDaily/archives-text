## Depleted Card faces Mountaineers Stanford, without Sebolt and Asforis, will rely on three freshmen again 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
After emerging from last weekend's
UNLV/7-UP Desert Classic with a tourn
ament championship and a modest 2-0
start, the Stanford women's basketball
team may be serving notice that losing
records are now only history.
Unfortunately, injuries, another
plague of Stanford's past, continue to
haunt the Cardinal in the present as the
team takes its perfect record to West
Virginia tonight without the services of
forwards Evon Asforis and Sue Sebolt.
During Saturday's championship
game against UNLV, Asforis, the 6-foot
-2 sophomore who led the Cardinal in
rebounding last year, sprained the
same knee that underwent surgery last
season. Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer believes Asforis will be sidelined
for at least two weeks.
Sebolt, a starter for most of last
season, strained a back muscle during
last weekend's action and has been in
too much pain to make the trip.
Injuries to key personnel have
crippled the Cardinal attack in recent
seasons, but this year's team has a great
deal of depth at all positions, a fact that
was certainly evident during the 68-54
victory over the Lady Rebels.
Freshman Katy Steding, filling in for
the injured Asforis, scored 11 points
and pulled down 11 rebounds for the
Cardinal before fouling out.
After only two collegiate appear
ances, VanDerveer says the 6-0 forward
is one of the best rebounders on the
team.

"Katy's my garbage collector," Van-
Derveer said. "She always happens to
be in the right place at the right time.
It's not chance. She has a knack for
being in the right position to grab
those rebounds."
Steding, however, will need some
team support in the rebounding de
partment when the Cardinal squares
off against West Virginia tonight. The
Lady Mountaineers are led by 6-8 cen
ter Georgeann Wells, the first woman
ever to dunk in a basketball game.
Steding will be helped out inside by
junior Kami Anderson and sophomore
center Jill Yanke. Anderson, a 6-0 for
ward, was named the Most Valuable
Player at the UNLV tournament. She
scored 31 points in the two games to
lead the team. She also had 10
rebounds in the tournament.
Yanke, who at 6-5 is the Cardinal's
tallest player, scored 20 points at Las
Vegas but brought down only 4
rebounds in the two games. She was in
foul trouble throughout the final game
against UNLV.
In addition to Steding, Stanford has
benefited from the strong play of two
other freshmen already in this young
season. 5-7 guards Jennifer Azzi and
Stacy Parson came off the bench to play
key roles in the UNLV victory when
several starters got into foul trouble.
Azzi had 13 points, four assists and
two steals against the Rebels â€” a per
formance that was good enough to
earn her All-tournament honors. Par
son scored 11 points in the final. Both
will likely see increased playing time
with Sebolt out of action.

West Virginia won its first game of
the season, demolishing Salem College
(Va.) 95-68 last Saturday. The Lady
Mountaineers were led in scoring by
senior guard Alexis Basil, who poured
in 20 points.

Card notes
Redshirt freshman Emily Wagner, who
suffered a knee injury last year and is suffer
ing from a stress fracture this season, hopes
to find out soon whether or not she will be
able to play this season.

Stanford center Jill Yanke pulled down just four rebounds in the UNLV/7-
UP Invitational last weekend, partly because she was in foul trouble most of
the tournament.

against UNLV Saturday and will miss tonight's game against West Virginia.
