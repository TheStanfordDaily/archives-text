# From dreams to nightmares and back again

### 
Jet lag is not a pretty thing. Neither is the international
date line. Combine the two and you have the stuff of a
nightmare. Rod Serling: "Submitted for your approval. A 41-
hour Monday."
So, it was Monday here, Tuesday in Japan and the middle
of next week in Eastern Orthodox countries that still follow
the Julian calendar, when my phone rang. It was daylight
outside, and my watch said it was quarter past midnight.

"Domino's Pizza, can you hold?" I answered instinctively.
It was then I wished I hadn't ordered that pepperoni and
sausage with thick crust while reading an Erik Eselius
column.
"Hi, pardner," a gruff voice answered. "How'd you like
that goddamn football game Sunday? Intensity, no let
downs."
I had awoken to a Jack Elway postgame interview. I didn't
know whether this was good or bad. I didn't know what day

it was. I reached for my notebook.
"Thanks for returning my call, coach," I said, trying
desperately to remember what I had meant to ask him.
"You didn't call me, pardner," he replied. "I called you. I
understand your intramural football season is over, and I
was wondering if you'd want to take a few reps at corner
back before the Gator Bowl. Alan Grant sprained his ankle,
and we just might need someone."
Sure, I'd been recruited for college football out of high
school. Two schools: Grinnell College in Grinnell, lowa — a
Division 111 school that was 1-9 that year — and the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia — for lightweight ball
with a 158-pound weight limit. But that was back in my
prime, 8.R.F.5.8. (Before Roble Food Service and Beer).
"Coach, I couldn't even cover an out pattern in the end
zone in a damn B-League quarterfinal game Monday. Our
season's over only because we lost 6-0. I promise never to
write another 'Toi Cook blew his coverage and cost Stanford
a touchdown' line ever again. Besides, 5.2 in the 40 does not
9 Pac-10 defensive back make."
"They did here a couple of years ago. And you forgot
something: Toi Cook hasn't blown any coverages this year.
This year he's got seven interceptions, blinding speed and
All-Pac-10."
Then my call-waiting kicked in, and I had to leave Coach
Elway.
"Thanks for calling The Stanford Daily, the Peninsula's

largest morning paper," I answered. Then I realized I was
still in bed. Alone. No hangover. Good signs.
"John, Mike McGee here. I'm the AD at USC, and was
wondering what to do with Ted Tollner."
"Gee, I don't know. How about dinner, a movie and danc
ing at "Mom's"?
"No. I mean should I fire him or not. All these alums are
sCreamihg for his head."
"Well, let's see. Tollner won the Rose Bowl two years ago.
He went 7-4 this year. The Trojans are playing on New Year's
Day at the Citrus Bowl. And they beat an 8-3 Stanford team
that's Gator Bowl-bound. He's a class act who waits until
he's in the bathroom to unzip his pants. And then, at your
last home game, the students and alums booed Tollner as
he introduced the seniors."
"Yes, they did."
"Fire him."
"But everything you said is positive."
"Yep. It's obvious that you guys don't deserve anyone
with the class and talent Tollner has. Let him to go where
he's appreciated."
"But who should I hire to replace him?"
"For totally classless, tasteless students and alumni.
Hmmmm. I think Joe Kapp is still unemployed."
I had no sooner hung up the phone when it rang again. It
was Chris Horpel, the Stanford wrestling coach.
"John, why doesn't anyone at this school show up for

wrestling meets? At lowa they get 12,000 people. Here, we
get 12, if we count the guys' girl friends. What are we doing
wrong?"
"Well, coach, you've got one of the best intercollegiate
sports to work with. That's the start. All you've got to do is
get people out there to see it for themselves. The sport will
sell itself."
"How do we do that? We're in California, where windsurf
ing is more popular than wrestling."
"First, remember this is a terrible place to try to draw. An
8-3 football team drew only 35,000 for its last home game.
That's a crowd for a spring game in the Big Ten or Texas.
What you need is a gimmick. The word wrestling' is big. All
you need are fliers with a picture of Cyndi Lauper with Hulk
Hogan and the time of your next match."
"But that's got nothing to do with our sport."
"I know it, and you know it. They don't. They show up ex
pecting the Hulkster, and they get real wrestling. They're
reasonably intelligent, so they appreciate the sport and get
hooked. Instant fans."
The way the morning (or maybe it was evening) was
going, I was waiting for the next unexpected call. And,
knowing my editor told me he needed more copy, it obvi
ously came. How an editor got in my dream is beyond me.
Anyway, I picked up the phone.
