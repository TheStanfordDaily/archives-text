# Rested soccer team gives Aussies the boot
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Yesterday was just what the doctor
ordered for the ailing Stanford men's
soccer team. The Cardinal notched a
convincing 4-0 victory over the Univer
sity of Sydney in an exhibition at
Maloney Field.
Stanford started off strong and

dominated play from the opening kick
off. One of the Cardinal's problems
this season has been lethargy in the
opening minutes of the match. This
was not the case against Sydney.
"I'm very pleased," Stanford Coach
Sam Koch said. "They did a good job
and came out and played hard, which
is not an easy thing to do with a three
week layoff. I talked to them before the

game on how we wanted to approach
this game, and I was happy with their
attitude."
Koch indicated that the game was
important despite the fact that it was an
exhibition. "Whenever you go out and
represent your school, you have to
take it seriously," he said.
"We were tired the last few games of
the year, and today the legs were there

the whole game and everybody played
a lot," Koch added. "It was a good, pos
itive note to get us going for next year.
We really needed it."
Positive indeed. The first half was
not even 20 minutes old when Stan
ford struck for its first goal. Sopho
more fullback David Thorpe played an
excellent cross to the top of the penalty
area, where midfielder Juan Garcia
pounded a shot at the Aussie goalie,
who was unable to control it. It trickled
outside the right post, where junior
Brian Mahaffey ran the ball down and
put it into the upper lefthand corner
with 17:13 gone in the half.
Then at the 37:42 mark, Mark Cis
neros, who had been in the game only
a few minutes, dropped a cross onto
the chest of freshman Chris Porch at
the far post. Porch volleyed it off the
bounce past the diving goalie for a 2-0
Stanford lead.
Jim Cole, the only senior playing in
the game, produced the other two
Stanford goals, both in the second half.
The first came on a penalty kick at the
50:47 mark. The free shot was awarded
when Cole went down in a heap after
being tripped in the 18-yard area.
"I pushed the ball by him (the Syd
ney defender) to try to beat him to the
endline, and he cut me down. There
was no question it was a foul," Cole
said.
Cole s second goal came on a
rebound after a Stanford free kick.
Chris Dechet touched the ball to Luke
Garrott, whose shot dribbled away
from the goalie. Cole pounced on it to
produce the final score of 4-0 at 72:28.
"When we have a free kick and I
know somebody's going to shoot, the
defender never goes in with you, and it
usually works once or twice a season,"
Cole said.
"I figured, What would (senior
goalkeeper Tom) Austin do?' He'd
have it bounce off his shin or some
thing, so I thought I'd be there," he

added jokingly about his senior
teammate who didn't play.
Cole may have played his final game
for Stanford. He has received an offer
to play professional soccer for the San
Jose Earthquakes when their outdoor
season begins in the spring. If he
chooses not to play with the
Earthquakes, he will play in the Card
inal's spring season.
"I'll play with the Earthquakes time
permitting. I have to concentrate on
graduating first," Cole said.
Cole has seen a lot of changes in the
Stanford soccer program in his four
years on the Farm.
"The team's gone through a lot of
changes with the two different
coaches. With the previous coach
(Nelson Lodge), we had a lot of indi
viduals with a lot of talent who didn't
play as a team. This year we had people
with less talent that played together,"
Cole said.
"We played as well against the
ranked teams this season as just about
any year since I've been here. We
scared them just as much. It was a great
year, and I had a good time with these
guys," he added.
The Aussies were definitely not in
playing shape for yesterday's contest.
Their season ended three months ago.
"They fought hard but were a bit out
of shape, as we were because of our
layoff," sophomore halfback Kevin
Woodhouse said. "We were just in a
little bit better shape. It was a fun
game. We touched it around well at
times."
With an exhibition against Argentina
coming up next month and a spring
season to look forward to, Koch is
happy with the development of his
team as a unit this year. "The chemistry
of this team is amazing," he said. "It's
going to take time for us to perform at
the top level we're capable. We have a
lot of work to do, but we'll be ready in
the fall."

the year, and today the legs were there

the whole game and everybody played
a lot," Koch added. "It was a good, pos
itive note to get us going for next year.
We really needed it."
Positive indeed. The first half was
not even 20 minutes old when Stan
ford struck for its first goal. Sopho
more fullback David Thorpe played an
excellent cross to the top of the penalty
area, where midfielder Juan Garcia
pounded a shot at the Aussie goalie,
who was unable to control it. It trickled
outside the right post, where junior
Brian Mahaffey ran the ball down and
put it into the upper lefthand corner
with 17:13 gone in the half.
Then at the 37:42 mark, Mark Cis
neros, who had been in the game only
a few minutes, dropped a cross onto
the chest of freshman Chris Porch at
the far post. Porch volleyed it off the
bounce past the diving goalie for a 2-0
Stanford lead.
Jim Cole, the only senior playing in
the game, produced the other two
Stanford goals, both in the second half.
The first came on a penalty kick at the
50:47 mark. The free shot was awarded
when Cole went down in a heap after
being tripped in the 18-yard area.
"I pushed the ball by him (the Syd
ney defender) to try to beat him to the
endline, and he cut me down. There
was no question it was a foul," Cole
said.
Cole s second goal came on a
rebound after a Stanford free kick.
Chris Dechet touched the ball to Luke
Garrott, whose shot dribbled away
from the goalie. Cole pounced on it to
produce the final score of 4-0 at 72:28.
"When we have a free kick and I
know somebody's going to shoot, the
defender never goes in with you, and it
usually works once or twice a season,"
Cole said.
"I figured, What would (senior
goalkeeper Tom) Austin do?' He'd
have it bounce off his shin or some
thing, so I thought I'd be there," he

added jokingly about his senior
teammate who didn't play.
Cole may have played his final game
for Stanford. He has received an offer
to play professional soccer for the San
Jose Earthquakes when their outdoor
season begins in the spring. If he
chooses not to play with the
Earthquakes, he will play in the Card
inal's spring season.
"I'll play with the Earthquakes time
permitting. I have to concentrate on
graduating first," Cole said.
Cole has seen a lot of changes in the
Stanford soccer program in his four
years on the Farm.
"The team's gone through a lot of
changes with the two different
coaches. With the previous coach
(Nelson Lodge), we had a lot of indi
viduals with a lot of talent who didn't
play as a team. This year we had people
with less talent that played together,"
Cole said.
"We played as well against the
ranked teams this season as just about
any year since I've been here. We
scared them just as much. It was a great
year, and I had a good time with these
guys," he added.
The Aussies were definitely not in
playing shape for yesterday's contest.
Their season ended three months ago.
"They fought hard but were a bit out
of shape, as we were because of our
layoff," sophomore halfback Kevin
Woodhouse said. "We were just in a
little bit better shape. It was a fun
game. We touched it around well at
times."
With an exhibition against Argentina
coming up next month and a spring
season to look forward to, Koch is
happy with the development of his
team as a unit this year. "The chemistry
of this team is amazing," he said. "It's
going to take time for us to perform at
the top level we're capable. We have a
lot of work to do, but we'll be ready in
the fall."

The only senior on the field yesterday for Stanford, Jim Cole, scored two goals to lead the Cardinal to a 4-0
whitewashing of the University of Sydney at Maloney Field.
Yesterday was just what the doctor
ordered for the ailing Stanford men's
soccer team. The Cardinal notched a
convincing 4-0 victory over the Univer
sity of Sydney in an exhibition at
Maloney Field.
Stanford started off strong and

dominated play from the opening kick
off. One of the Cardinal's problems
this season has been lethargy in the
opening minutes of the match. This
was not the case against Sydney.
"I'm very pleased," Stanford Coach
Sam Koch said. "They did a good job
and came out and played hard, which
is not an easy thing to do with a three
week layoff. I talked to them before the

game on how we wanted to approach
this game, and I was happy with their
attitude."
Koch indicated that the game was
important despite the fact that it was an
exhibition. "Whenever you go out and
represent your school, you have to
take it seriously," he said.
"We were tired the last few games of
the year, and today the legs were there

the whole game and everybody played
a lot," Koch added. "It was a good, pos
itive note to get us going for next year.
