# Stanford to host sailing NCAAs
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
For the first time since it rose
to national prominence, the
Stanford sailing team will not
have to travel thousands of miles
next season when it is competes
in the national championships.
Instead, the Cardinal will en
joy something of a home-field
advantage, because Stanford has
been chosen as the host of the
1988 Intercollegiate Dinghy and
Team Racing Championships.
The regatta, which decides the
top school in each of the two
most competitive divisions of
college sailing, is usually held at
the end of May. No specific dates
have been set for the Stanford
event.
Sixteen schools from the six
national districts will qualify for
the dinghy championships
through a series of local elimina
tions held in the months before
the national regatta The dinghy
division involves teams of two,
which compete against all other
schools in each race. Thirty-two
races will be held to determine
the final winner.
Twelve schools drawn from
the same districts will compete
in the team racing champion-
ships. In team racing, each school
races against the other schools one at a
time. Each team is made up of three
boats sailed by pairs of sailors. Team
racing is more complex than dinghy
racing because the total score from all
three boats on each side determines
the winning school, so much more
strategy is involved.
Both compet/ions will be held in
Stanford's fleet >>112 Flying Junior class
sailboats. The sailing program cur
rently owns 15 be ats of that class, but
hopes to replace Tiany of them with
new Flying Juniors by the time of the
intercollegiate championship.
The races for both divisions will be
held in the area of Southampton
Shoals off Richmond. The sailing
team's regular practice area, a muddy
creek off Seaport Boulevard in Red
wood City, is too small for Stanford to
use for the national regatta.
While Stanford is hosting the dinghy
and team racing divisions, UC-Santa
Cruz will stage the women's division
championships nearby.
