# Stanford offense in able hands of Rush
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
The scene is the set of a television
commercial. A tall young lady in a vol
leyball sweatsuit walks on stage and
begins to speak. "Do you know me?"
she asks. "Our offense literally rests in
my hands. I don't get many flashy kills,
however, and I don't always have the
eye-opening statistics, but without me
no one would."
The above scene is fictitious, but is
entirely possible. The person is a setter
and is one of the most important keys
to a successful volleyball team. The
Stanford women's team is fortunate to
have perhaps the best setter in the
country in Wendi Rush.
"1 have one of the most difficult
roles on the court," she said, "but.it
looks the easiest. You're involved in
every play. You can make things hap
pen."
The 5-foot-10 junior has been
making things happen ever since she
took up volleyball in the sixth grade. At
Rim of the World High School in Lake
Arrowhead, she was a three-time Cali
fornia player of the year while leading
her team to three consecutive state Di
vision II titles.
Rush also played field hockey and
ran track in high school but always
knew volleyball was the sport for her.
"It's a great oppurtunity for a free edu
cation," she said.
At Stanford, she has used her talents
to earn not only her education but also
a lot of respect. Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said: "I wouldn't trade Wendi for
any other setter."
Shaw is not alone in his assessment.
Rush came out of high school as the
No. 1 prospect in the country and was
recruited by more than 50 schools. She
decided on Stanford to follow in the
footsteps of her sister, Kari, and be
cause of Stanford's successful blend of
school and sports.
"The program gives the players an
opportunity to excel in academics and
volleyball and have a social life, too,"
she said.
The transition from"the finest high
school setter in the land," according to
Volleyball Monthly, to a top collegiate
player has not been all easy, though.
Rush is taking 20 units this quarter and
said, "You have no free time," due to
practicing in the evening.
"Night practice breaks up your study

time too much," she added.
Rush is considering majoring in psy
chology and pursuing a career involv
ing children, in therapy or teaching.
Senior co-captain Barbra Fontana
thinks Rush is well qualified. "She is
down to earth, really concerned with
people," Fontana said.
Shaw agrees. "She's sensitive; she
cares about other people," he said.
Of course, volleyball could be a part
of her life for years to come. She has an
interest in playing with the national
team, and Shaw thinks it is possible if
she works hard. "The national team is
in need of a setter," he said. "She has
the potential to be that person."
Fontana echoed his thoughts. "If she
puts her mind to it, she has a great shot
of playing for the national team," she
said.
Rush is not decided yet, though. "I
want to leave my options open," she
said. "I want to be the best I can be, but
there are a lot of other things to do."
Right now, though, she is in the
midst of a stellar career at Stanford. As
one of two setters on the court her
freshman year, she was named to Vol
leyball Monthly's Honorable Mention
All-America team and set a record with
73 digs in the NCAA tournament that
year.
Last year, as a sophomore, Rush got
to switch back to a 5-1 system, where
she is the only setter. "I definitely like a
5-1 better," she said.
According to Fontana, "The 5-1 has
been good; it makes for a more consis
tant match. It gives the setter a lot more
confidence.
As the sole setter, Rush was really
able to show her talents. Despite a
midseason ankle injury, she was a
CVCA first-team All-America and made
Volleyball Monthly's second team.
This year, as a consensus first-team
preseason pick, she has led the Card
inal to a 21-9 record, a No. 11 national
ranking and Stanford's sixth con
secutive postseason appearance. She
was also on the All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence first team, which was announced
Tuesday.
"Wendi has improved steadily 1 ' over
the last three years, Shaw said. "Her set
selection has been really good this
year."
Her improvement can be attributed
to a strong work ethic. "She works
hard in practice," Shaw said.
Fontana concurs. "She has a good at

titude. She's a real go-getter. She is al
ways going hard, always pushing."
Rush has her own views of the
reasons for her success. "A lot of
people can set, but I've been trained in
the mental aspects of setting. My club
provided a good base of fundamental
skills and stressed the mental part. Vol
leyball is a very mental game," she
said. "I'm also lucky to have the option
of many great hiters."
Rush has been helpful in other ways
as well. Freshman setter Lara Asper was
recruited by almost all major volleyball
programs, and could have started for
most, but came to Stanford. "That

(Rush's being here) was one of the
main reasons I chose to go here," she
said.
"I think she understands you need
to be a smart setter," Asper added.
"She looks at the block (on the other
side of the net) more. One of the most
important things is to get hitters one
on-one (with opposing blockers) as
much as possible."
Rush is especially appreciated by a
former opponent turned teammate:
Barbra Fontana. "I played against her at
Junior Olympics about eight years
ago," Fontana said. "I think it's neat I fi
nally got a chance to play with her."

A three-time all-state performer in high school, Wendi Rush has lived up to
her billing while at Stanford. After earning honorable mention All-America
honors as a freshman, Rush was named to the CVCA first-team All-
America squad last year as a sophomore.
