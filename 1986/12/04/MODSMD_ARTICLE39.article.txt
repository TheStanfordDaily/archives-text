## Nataraja: Culinary hideaway on University 
### MARY MORTON TED HUTMAN Staff writers 
Nataraja
117 University Ave.
321-6161
The general ignorance of the Stan
ford population to the existence and
the quality of Nataraja attests to the the
ory that the best place to hide some
thing is right under one's nose.
Entering off the Avenue, just past
one of Palo Alto's croissant connec
tions, and a Macintosh demo center
ablaze with screen green light, we
moved with relief into Nataraja's sooth
ing mellow atmosphere.
The soft, even lighting illuminates a
single room upholstered in warm
earthy colors, and accented by Indian
drum and sitar music, and decorative

murals. The gently rambling Indian
music adds to both the comfort and the
pleasurable sense of otherworldliness.
Once seated in a spacious booth, we
ordered a bottle of Taj Mahal beer, one
of India's finest brews and the only In
dian beer offered here. As appetizers,
Nataraja's samosas are essential: tri
angles of pastry stuffed plump with
spicy potatoes and peas, served with
fresh cucumber chutney.
These instantly appease even the
most enraged hunger. We also ap
petized with a basket of vegetable
pakoras, lightly fried pieces of potato,
eggplant, cauliflower and bell pepper.
After prolonged deliberation and a
thorough study of the menu, which in
cludes a representative selection of
vegetable dishes, curries and tandoor
specialities, we ordered the Bombay
Curry and the Tandoori Combination.
Our choices were brought in several

bowls, from which the waiter skillfully
spooned a truly aesthetic plate of In
dian colors: tandoori pieces with
spiced orange, chicken in a green
Bombay-style curry and a mound of
saffron rice between the two.
We had both paratha bread, multi
layered and buttered, and the tradi
tional nan. Both were baked in the tan
door clay oven, and had the wonderful
unleavened texture.
The Tandoori Combination was
tasteful, tasty and authentic (we
watched our meat roast in the tandoori
oven behind a large cracked tinted
glass at the end of the room). But the
rather small pieces of chicken, fish,
beef and lamb shish kebab were a bit
dry.
The Bombay Curry was nice and
wet, with a distinct fresh taste. Blended
with the superb rice or a wad of nan, it
provided the rich Indian taste for

which we had come.
Neither dish was particularly spicy in
that tear-rolling, nose-blowing way
which adds a heightened physiological
dimension to eating. However, we
were later informed that such in
vigorating flavoring can be requested.
In the Indian conception of a perfect
meal, every possible taste must be
equally addressed and satisfied. Hence
the attention to spice, and the neces
sary allusion of the sweet at the end of
every meal.
We ordered a dish of kulfi, similar to
ice cream, which comes sliced and
cool. Each piece melts on the tongue
into sweet milky nuttiness. Very good.
The gulab jamun, which consists of
warm milk dumplings, slightly
browned and soaking in rose-flavored
sugar syrup, was somehow soul sooth
ing in a mystical sense.
