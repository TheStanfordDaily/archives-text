# Sen. Hatch forum canceled
## 
### 
A symposium on Attorney General
Edwin Meese and his views of the
Constitution scheduled for today has
been canceled because Sen. Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah), one of the partici
pants in the debate, has to fly to
Washington, D C., to attend special
meetings of the Senate Intelligence
Committee.
Entitled "The Attorney General
and the Constitution, or Mr. Meese
Meet Mr. Madison," the symposium
will probably not be rescheduled,
according to History Prof. Jack
Rakove. It was to be held at 7:30 p.m.
at the Law School, and was to feature
Law Prof. Paul Brest, Rakove and
Hatch.
Law Dean John Hart Ely, a noted

constitutional scholar, was sched
uled to moderate the event.
According to Rakove, the event
was canceled because "we decided
there wouldn't be much of a debate
without (Hatch) there."
Hatch, in the past, has been sup
portive of Meese's argument that the
U.S. Supreme Court is far more ac
tivist and assertive than the constitu
tion allows or its authors intended.
Hatch, himself, has often been men
tioned as a possible appointee to the
Supreme Court.
Brest and Rakove dissent from
Meese's view.
"It would have been a great event.
Unfortunately it went by the boards,"
Rakove said.

The theme of the symposium,
which was designed to compare
Meese's and James Madison's inter
pretations of the Constitution, has
been a topic of much public debate
during the last year-and-a-half.
The debate on Meese's and
Madison's differing viewpoints
began after Meese addressed the
American Bar Association in July
1985, Rakove said. In that speech,
Meese charged the judicial branch
with interpreting the Constitution in
defiance of the original intent,
Rakove said.
The symposium was to have been
sponsored by the Stanford Law
School and the American Studies
Program.
