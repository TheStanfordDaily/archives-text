# CUS endorses new core class
## Fac Sen to hear W. Culture proposal 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Staff writer 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) will recommend to the
Faculty Senate that an alternative West
ern Culture course be offered on a
one-time basis this spring quarter.
The course, designed by History
Prof. Clay Carson, will emphasize the
contributions of minorities and
women to Western Culture and will in
clude works by blacks, Hispanics,
Asians and feminists.
The CUS voted 8-2 in favor of recom
mending that the course be instituted
on a one-time basis, said CUS Chair
man Marsh McCall. Although a final
document has not yet been drafted,
McCall said the CUS will also recom
mend limiting the course to no more
than 100 students, all of whom must
come from the current Western Cul
ture tracks. The course will not be
open to upperclassmen who have

already fulfilled the Western Culture
requirement.
The course cannot be officially ap
proved until the committee presents
the recommendation to the Faculty
Senate, which will vote on whether to
institute the course.
"As far as I'm concerned, it's quite
inaccurate to say it's a certitude that
this will happen," said McCall.
Amanda Kemp, chair of the Black
Student Union (BSU), was happy with
the committee's decision. "It was a vic
tory for all of us who worked so hard
for it," she said.
Kemp and approximately 20 stu
dents representing student minority
organizations and the ASSU came to
the CUS meeting yesterday. Although
the meeting was closed, McCall agreed
to allow students in on the condition
that they present a letter specifying
their intentions at the meeting.
After a vote, the committee agreed to
permit the students to distribute letters
and petitions in support of the course
and to speak at the meeting for 10
minutes. They were not allowed to be
in the room when the vote was taken.
The letters were written by the stu
dent groups in response to a rumor
that the committee was not in favor of
the course. Kemp said prior to the
meeting, several committee members
told students in the BSU they did not
think the CUS would recommend the
course.
"Reaction to the rumor was in fact
reaction to fact," said McCall. The CUS
had not committed to recommending
the class before the meeting yesterday.
"There was no mandate at any point
that (the recommendation) had been

set in place," he said.
Nevertheless, "It's a little stepping
stone ... and an important (one) to
us," said Kemp. Although she said she
is pleased with the committee's deci
sion, Kemp pointed out that it was not
an end to the groups' push for "real
change" in the Western Culture Pro
gram.
"We want every (Western Culture)
track to take a significant lix)k at what it
means to be (a minority)," she said.
McCall said the CUS recommenda
tion "in no way makes ... any state
ment about the future direction of the
Western Culture Program." It is not in
tended by the committee to be a re
commendation for a world culture
program or for any radical change in
the current Western Culture Program.
It "is intended to be a help in creat
ing a broad dialogue about the best
ways to improve ... the current West
ern Culture Program," said McCall.
