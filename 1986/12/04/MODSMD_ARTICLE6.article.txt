# French protesters block classroom doors

PARIS — Stanford students here have had a dif
ficult time getting to class for the past two weeks,
not so much due to faulty alarm clocks or slow
Metro trains as to large crowds of striking stu
dents marching in the streets and occupying uni
versity buildings.
"I got to the Sorbonne yesterday and couldn't
get in because the grevistes (strikers) weren't let
ting people in," junior Daralyn Durie said. She
stayed to witness a confrontation between the
strikers and the students trying to get to class until
protestors began breaking windows and the
unarmed building guards showed up. "When (the
non-strikers) started carrying in poles — batter
ing rams — I decided it was time to leave."
Program participants here have witnessed such
incidents since a day-long protest rally on Nov. 27
when, by the French newspaper Le Monde's es
timates, 200,000 Parisian university and lycee
(secondary school) students filled the streets
from the heart of the Latin Quarter to the bar
ricades of the National Assembly, where the Deva
quet proposal was scheduled for debate.
"I've never seen that many people in the streets
outside of a soccer stadium," junior Flavio Fefer
man said. "Something like this would never hap
pen in the (United) States. It's a real chance to see
a different kind of student movement."
The movement comes in response to reforms
proposed by the minister of Research and Higher
Education, Alain Devaquet. These proposals
would restrict access to French universities in an

attempt to reduce chronic overcrowding.
Currently, anyone who passes the Bac
calauraute Exam i.s, in a place In
the university of his choice. The new measures
would establish two tests, one for graduation and
the other for college entrance.
Students who pass this entrance exam would
then be admitted to a university in their region of
France, where they would pay fees and earn a di
ploma specifically from that institution, rather
than from the French system as a whole.
At least five Parisian campuses are occupied
night and day by student strikers now, including
the Sorbonne, where students voted 68 percent
in favor of protesting at the campus. Unarmed
guards employed by Devaquet's ministry to
protect university buildings and students have
taken no action to evict the strikers. In Lyon, the
largest university city after Paris, one campus had
to lock its doors to avoid problems.
Strikers' attempts to block entrance to univer
sities appear successful, and most students are
prevented from attending a majority of their
classes. Professors at some universities have also
stopped giving lectures, in support of student
protests.
According to French student estimates, 60 out
of 70 lycees have held strikes, as well.
Stanford students have been surprised at the
size and age range of this movement, as well as its
political influence.
The day after last Thursday's march of 200,000
students in Paris and over 300,000 students in the
provinces, the prime minister pulled the Deva

quet proposals off the floor of the Assembly, the
country's legislative body, and sent it back to be
rewrittenlfi the Committee of Cultural Affairs.
However, the strikers refuse to return to class
until the proposals are completely abandoned
and student proposals are considered.
Nanterre University student Jean-Luc
Tutakowski said, "We feel this sense of fraternity,
this party atmosphere, because for the first time
in a long while, we're together and forceful. We
realize our power."
In the meantime, Stanford program partici
pants are getting their education in the streets as
they wait for classes to start again.
"This is like being in a giant poli-sci lab," junior
Kim Leach said. "I'm actually getting to test out all
the theory about French politics that I learned in
our orientation course."
Feferman analyzed the conflict's ramifications
for the co-habitation of power between Socialist
President Francois Mitterand and rightist Prime
Minister Jacques Chirac, saying, "They're both
trying to politicize the issue. The law is a chance
to assert rightist rule, if it goes. And it's the
socialists' first big chance to attack the govern
ment. Either one could rise a lot in popularity."
French students are outraged not at the possi
bility of increased competition — something they
are used to — but at the apparent break with
France's egalitarian tradition.
They claim that decentralizing the university
system would create a hierarchy of schools, with
only a few — like the Sorbonne and the Grandes
Ecoles, which prepare students for the more tech

nical fields — occupying the top rung. Flyers
being handed out express fears that the proposals
wf!l institutionalize existing Inequalities rather
than improve the quality of education and job
prospects for students meeting the new require
ments.
"The birth of the university system was closely
linked with the birth of the Republic at the time of
the French Revolution. By taking away the demo
cratic aspect of the one, this law endangers the
other. This has to do with the basis of the state,"
said Olivier Barberousse, a history major at Paris
I, and a member of the student committee there
charged with writing counter proposals to the
Devaquet reforms.
He said the proposed law has provided a
strong issue for students to mobilize against, but
that the movement really expresses the dissatis
faction of left-leaning students with the right-wing
government that took control last march after the
appointment of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac.
Leila Zaimi, a modern letters major at the Sor
bonne, placed herself on the militant extreme of
this movement by helping block the entry of stu
dents trying to attend class in opposition to the
strike. She recalled one morning when the con
flict between strikers and non-strikers became
heated. A group of right-wing students came into
the courtyard behind the blockade. While some
of the strikers were sandwiched between two ad
vancing groups, she retreated up a staircase and
heard later that two students had suffered minor
