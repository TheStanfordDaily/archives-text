# Study assesses writing skills
## Students get a C 
### LAURA CORSER 
Students' writing achievement rates
a C average, according to the latest
report on the writing ability of
America's youth, released yesterday by
the Educational Testing Service (ETS)
at a Washington, D.C., news conference.
The report is compiled each year for
the National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) and analyzes the
writing of students in primary and sec
ondary schools. The C rating reflects
an ability to master basic skills as well
as an inability to incorporate these
skills into effective vehicles for ideas,
according to the report.
The report was co-authored by Ar
thur Applebee and Judith Langer, pro
fessors in the Stanford School of Edu
cation, and Ina Mullis, associate direc
tor of NAEP.
According to Langer, the report
shows that "we clearly need to go
beyond the basics if we want our
youngsters to succeed in school and in
society.
"Schools have focused on the basics,
but study after study has now shown
the basics alone are not enough,"
Langer said.
"Broad-based experiences in which
reading and writing tasks are integra
ted into the work throughout the cur
riculum" are necessary, according to
Langer.

Researchers feel that, at present, stu
dents are merely writing enough to do
the job and get by. Langer said she
would like to see students incorporate
more thinking into their writing.
The study involved thousands of stu
dents chosen from the fourth, eighth
and 11th grades in schools across the
United States. The student sampling
was representative of various ethnic,
economic and regional groupings.
Students were asked to answer ques
tions regarding their study habits and
their family background. They were
also asked to complete 11 tasks of
varying difficulty. Tasks included
writing a letter to apply for a job, com
posing an analytic comparison and
contrast, and creating a story.
Each task was graded according to a
standardized scale devised by the co
authors and members of the ETS.
Writing that barely succeeds in ex
pressing its intent represents the bot
tom of the scale and is termed
"minimal." Higher up on the scale is
"adequate" writing and "wonderful
writing" is at the top of the scale, ac
cording to Langer. The report found
most writing fell between minimal and
adequate.
For instance, when asked to write a
comparison and contrast analysis, only
25 percent of 11th graders were capa
ble of producing "adequate" writing.
A response judged minimal reads: "I
have been experence (sic) at cleaning
house. I've also work (sic) at a pool be
for (sic)." That which is judged
adequate' reads, "I would enjoy and
appreciate this job very much. I would
even work overtime to clean up, if it's
needed."
Looking at each grade level studied,
students in all three levels appear to
have difficulties with persuasive and
analytic writing. "Even at grade 11,
relatively few students were able to
provide adequate responses to analytic
writing tasks, and fewer still were able
to muster arguments to persuade
others to accept their points of view,"
the report reads.
