Arms deal hurts U.S. credibility
LONDON — The unfolding Iran arms scandal has seriously damaged
America's credibility among its closest European allies and resurrected
questions about America's effectiveness as the acknowledged leader of the
Western alliance.
For many Europeans, the episode has reinforced the disturbing percep
tion of recent months that President Reagan has somehow let American
foreign policy slip dangerously out of control.
In general, European disquiet about Reagan's conduct of foreign policy
is not new. His lack of enthusiasm for — and eventual violation of — the
second strategic arms limitation agreement, his attempts to block the par
ticipation of European companies in the Soviet gas trans-Siberian pipeline
project and his decisions to invade Grenada and bomb Libya all added a
degree of tension between Washington and its alliance partners.
But the image of disarray conveyed by the Iran arms issue is viewed on
this side of the Atlantic as far more than differences of policy.
"Hasenfus, Libya disinformation, Reykjavik, Iran, SALT II — they all add
up to a great weakening in the confidence of American foreign policy," said
Sir James Eberle, director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in
London.
The chain of unpredictable, unconventional incidents within the space
of a few months has already revived questions in Europe about the wisdom
of political overdependence on the United States.
French Premier Jacques Chirac, for example, in a major speech Tuesday
in Paris, called for a Western European charter of security principles to
safeguard the European members of the Atlantic alliance.
Nir previously worked for Bush
JERUSALEM — The man who coordinated Israel's pan in the Reagan ad
ministration's U.S. arms-to-Iran program for the last 11 months is a wealthy
former television journalist who may owe his selection for the job to pro
fessional help he gave a year earlier to Vice President George Bush's task
force on combating terrorism.
Amiram Nir, 36, has refused to comment publicly on his role in the Iran
arms affair. But he has nonetheless emerged in recent days as a key, and
controversial, figure.
Critics here have branded him an ambitious "amateur" whose ill
considered actions — including a trip with U.S. officials to Tehran last May,
disguised as a member of the flight crew — contributed to the ultimate ex
posure of the sensitive program.
More seriously, a news report here yesterday quoted "authoritative U.S.
officials" as saying that Lt. Col. Oliver North, the National Security Council
aide fired last week for his part in the affair, had told U.S. investigators that
he fully briefed Nir on the diversion of Iranian arms money to the Un
supported Nicaraguan rebels.
The report in the English-language Jerusalem Post brought a quick
denial from a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who, along
with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
issued a government statement last week insisting that Israel knew nothing
of the connection with the contra rebels.
Mrs. Mandela assaulted by crowd
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Winnie Mandela was attacked outside the
Supreme Court building here yesterday by a small, largely black, crowd ap
parently enraged at her support for a convicted murderer.
Mandela, wife of the jailed leader of the banned African National
Congress, Nelson Mandela, was leaving the court after attending the trial of
Lindi Mangaliso, who has been found guilty of murdering her wealthy hus
band, Victor, in Cape Town's black township of Guguletu.
The mob cornered Mandela near the court's back entrance and pelted
her with tin cans, litter and handfuls of sand from a nearby building site.
The crowd surged behind Mandela as she attempted to flee, jostling her
and repeatedly throwing sand grabbed from a heap on the pavement
before she escaped in a car that drew up next to her.
Police brought dogs to the scene to control the crowd, which had been
waiting for Mangaliso to be led from the entrance to the cells below the
court.
Mangaliso last week was found guilty of murdering her husband through
hired killers in December 1984.
Aquino names cabinet member
MANILA, Philippines — Philippines President Corazon Aquino named a
new minister for local governments yesterday in a continuing revamping of
her 9-month-old government.
Appointed to replace Aquilino Pimentel in the powerful Minister of Local
Governments was 68-year-old Jaime Ferrer, a former chairman of the
Philippines watchdog commission on elections.
Ferrer was immediately sworn into office by Aquino in ceremonies at
the palace.
The president retained Pimentel on the Cabinet, reappointing him presi
dential adviser on national affairs. Aquino said she would soon announce
other changes in her Cabinet, including the appointment of a new minister
for labor.
"The process of renewal of our government shall be a continuing one in
keeping with our desire to force a government sensitive to national con
cerns and truly responsive to the needs of the people," the president said.
Aquino has been in close consultation with labor and business leaders to
find a new labor minister acceptable to both labor and the business com
munity. Augusto Sanchez, the present labor minister, has been the object of
complaints for suspected leftist leanings.
N. Koreans oppose succession
PYONGYANG, North Korea — North Korean leader Kim 11-sung seeks to
ensure that his son will succeed him in a smooth transfer of power but his
plan is far from receiving unanimous support among the Pyongyang lead
ership, and the 74-year-old leader's death could trigger a serious crisis,
foreign diplomats here say.
Feverish efforts have been underway for nearly six years to build a per
sonality cult around Kim Jong-il, 44, with the "dear leader" hailed as the of
ficial "guide" for the nation's 20 million people on matters relating to edu
cation. journalism, cinema, arts and literature.
Kim Jong-il's portrait frequently hangs beside his father's in public
places and private homes, and propaganda efforts center on conveying the
image of a stable regime where the succession question has been smoothly
resolved.
But the anempt to engineer the first dynastic transfer of power within a
communist state could be blocked by senior officials who would prefer to
see a more collective form of leadership, analysts say.
Western and East European diplomats, as well as residents who have had
the rare opportunity of hearing North Korean officials speak frankly, say
that a section of the party and the army, the pro-Peking old guard among
them, fiercely opposes Kim Jong-il.
If these elements feel they have sufficient backing when the time comes,
they could try to block his accession to power, the diplomats say.
Urban concerns unaddressed
SAN ANTONIO, Texas — Leaders of America's cities ended a four-day
meeting here yesterday amid widespread warnings that pressing urban
concerns will remain unaddressed unless President Reagan quickly
resolves the widening controversy over the administration's arms sales to
Iran.
The most dire word came from Sen. Joseph Biden, (D-Del ), a likely 1988
presidential candidate, who told the National League of Cities convention
that Reagan must put this to rest and do it quickly" because America can
not tolerate another failed presidency."
