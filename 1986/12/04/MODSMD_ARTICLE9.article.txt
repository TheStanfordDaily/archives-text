# Area man behind Iran arms deal

### 
WASHINGTON — California businessman Albert
Hakim has emerged as the suspected financial mas
termind of a secret operation to aid Nicaraguan
rebels with millions of dollars in profits from the sale
of U.S. arms to Iran, sources familiar with the investi
gation of the operation said yesterday.
Hakim, a resident of Los Gatos, about 15 miles
south of Stanford, was enlisted in the Iran arms net
work by a business associate, retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard Secord, according to the sources.
Secord in turn served Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North,
a staff member of the White House National Security
Council until he was fired last week, as the
"operational head" of the clandestine weapons ship
ments, the sources said. They stressed that they knew
of nothing so far to indicate any illegal acts on
Hakim's part.
"North's two biggest functionaries were Secord,
who handled operational details, and Hakim, who
handled the financial details," one source said.
Hakim, 51, is a former Iranian entrepreneur of
Jewish descent and a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Attempts to reach Hakim for comment were un
successful, and Richard Janis, Hakim's Washington at
torney, would not comment on Hakim's activities and
said that he would not provide any information on
his client's business career or personal history.
Secord refused to comment through his attorney.
A Swiss finance company to which Hakim has fin
ancial ties reportedly provided the banking channels
used to funnel profits from the arms sales to the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, according to
the sources. They identified the company as Com
pagnie de Services Fiduciaires S.A. of Geneva, also
known as CSF.
U.S. government sources said funds from CSF ac
counts in Switzerland were transferred to accounts in
the Cayman Islands and Panama. Contra sources and
congressional investigators said the airlift operation
to supply the contras drew its funds principally from
the Panama account, but they had no information on
the uses of the Cayman Islands funds.
The Times of London, quoting sources with knowl
edge of the transactions, said $18 million from the

Iranian arms sales was paid into CSF s account in the
Cayman Islands.
FBI agents have begun questioning U.S. govern
ment officials about their knowledge of Hakim and
his international business dealings, and other in
quiries have been made by staff investigators for the
Senate and House intelligence committees, the
sources said.
Sources said North, Secord and Hakim together
know many of the details of the Iran operation, some
of them unknown even to each other. Among the
three of them, these sources said, they know more
about the operation than Vice Adm. John Poindexter,
North's boss as President Reagan's national security
adviser before he resigned on the same day that
North was fired, and Robert McFarlane, whom Poin
dexter replaced as national security adviser exactly a
year ago.
Hakim is chief executive of Stanford Technology
Trading Corp., which handles defense-related and
non-defense scientific work from offices in San Jose,
Vienna, Va. and overseas.
