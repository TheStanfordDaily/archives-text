# U.S. monitored supply of contras
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The senior U.S.
military adviser in El Salvador closely
monitored a clandestine air resupply
network to contras fighting the govern
ment of Nicaragua and maintained reg
ular contact with crew members about
how the operation was run, a far
greater role than the U.S. government
has acknowledged, according to
records from the secret flights and
crew members.
The adviser, Army Col. James Steele,
was instructed by Edwin Corr, the U.S.
ambassador in San Salvador, to "keep
track" of the controversial supply oper
ation when it started this year in a per
iod in which Congress had banned any
U.S. military assistance to the contras,
according to a knowledgeable source.
A senior U.S. Embassy official in San
Salvador denied yesterday, as embassy
officials have repeatedly, any direct
knowledge of or participation in the
weapons air drops.
Steele "was very careful not to cross
the line" between observing the opera
tion and running it, according to the
knowledgeable source. But crew mem
bers said they considered Steele to
have had influence in the operation,
and newly acquired documents con
tain repeated references to consulta

tions with Steele, who headed the U.S.
Military Group in El Salvador for two
years until his recent reassignment.
The operation ended after
Nicaraguan soldiers shot down one of
the CI23K Fairchild cargo planes on
Oct. 5, leading to the deaths of three
crewmen, the capture of cargo-handler
Eugene Hasenfus and intense scrutiny
by Congress and the media. Con
gressional investigators are now ex
amining whether the resupply opera
tion was financed with profits from the
sale of U.S. arms to Iran, which were
diverted through a Swiss bank account.
The documents obtained by The
Washington Post include financial ac
counts, internal correspondence and
decoded messages between suburban
Washington and the operations base in
San Salvador, where retired Air Force
Col. Robert Dutton was overseeing
many payroll and logistical aspects of
the operation. Dutton is an employee
of the Stanford Technology Interna
tional Trading Group Inc., a Virginia
based corporation partially owned by
retired major general Richard Secord,
who played a key role in the resupply
missions flown out of Ilopango air
base near the Salvadoran capital, ac
cording to crew members.
