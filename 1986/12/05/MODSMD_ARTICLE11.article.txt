# 2 Israelis killed in campus protest

### 
JERUSALEM — Two Palestinian
students were killed and at least 11
were wounded yesterday when Is
raeli troops opened fire on demon
strators at the occupied West Bank's
second-largest university, military
and university officials reported.
The incident at Bir Zeit Univer
sity, about 20 miles north of
Jerusalem, was believed to be the
bloodiest campus clash in the terri
tory since Israel captured it from
Jordan in the Six-Day War of 1967.
The trouble started yesterday
morning at a military roadblock set
up to check documents of students
and faculty members entering the
campus. But from that point on, ver
sions of events given by the army
and by university officials differ
radically.
According to an army spokes
man, the military had information
that "radical elements in the
Palestine Liberation Organization
who want to push this situation to
extremes" planned some kind of
protest action. The university,
which hgs about 2,500 students, is
considered a -liotbed of Palestinian
nationalism.

The spokesman said that a Bir
Zeit professor, identified by col
leagues as Saleh Abdel Jawad, got
out of his car, which was in a long
line at the roadblock, and sat in the
middle of the street in protest.
Other students and faculty joined
him, and soon the sit-in grew to 200
people.
Army reinforcements called to
disperse the crowd were stoned, ac
cording to the military, and
responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets. They arrested the professor.
About an hour later, the army
spokesman said, students already
on campus began stoning a military
lookout post nearby while their
compatriots, using rocks and scrap
stockpiled ahead of time, blocked
roads in the area, apparently to
keep army reinforcements at bay.
Outnumbered soldiers, unable in
any other way to repulse the new at
tacks by students throwing rocks
and pieces of scrap metal, followed
standing orders that allow them to
open fire in what the spokesman
described as "a life-threatening sit
uation."
