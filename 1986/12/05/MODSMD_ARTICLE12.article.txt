## Briefly 
### 
An era comes to an end next
week at The Daily, when long-time
ASSU Typesetting night manager
Mike Hale puts out his final issue of
the newspaper.
Mike is leaving The Daily to
become an editor at the Times
Tribune.
1 pay tribute to him in my final
column because his work here —
which largely goes unrecognized
outside The Daily — has had a tre
mendous effect on the staff and on
our product.
Also, he has paid for an in
credible number of 3 a.m. meals at
the Creamery, and I have a recur
ring nightmare in which he
demands to be reimbursed.
As a typesetter and layout artist,
Mike has worked efficiently and
creatively. In this area, among
others, his talents will be greatly
missed.
The former roommate of film
critic Steve Vineberg, Mike has also
taken over Cinemascope duties in
recent years, carrying on a Daily
tradition by writing insightful, cyni
cal blurbs of movie analysis.
Mike's contribution to the paper
has gone far beyond his job. He is
an adviser, and he is a friend.
Reporters and editors consult him
on everything from story ideas to
writing style to staff management.
Those who can brave the late-night
life often share a meal with him

after the paper has been rolled.
On rare occasions Mike will lead
the staff in singing meal orders to
Ova or Dee, the good-natured
waitresses at Denny's.
Finally in the list of contributions,
Mike has played a key role on The
Daily's IM football and softball
squads, and, like a barroom Saint
Bernard, he has helped many a
drunken editor home on a
weekend night.
Of course Mike does have his
faults. He gives his trademark sigh
of impatience whenever picky
editors ask him to make small cor
rections, he has no FM radio in his
car, he sleeps all day every day, and
he loves teen sex movies. When a
large group of us saw the forget
table "Savage Streets" (starring
Linda Blair; theme song: "Justice for
all, justice for all, you get what you
get, when you're breakin' the
lawl"), Mike was the only one who,
a la Roger Ebert, came out of the
theater smiling.
Above all, Mike has been a source
of stability at The Daily, which has
seen quite a few crises in recent
years. Unruffled in the midst of
chaos, he munches a Corner Pocket
pizza, shares stories and jokes, and
always guides hectic nighttime pro
duction with a calm hand.
We bid the creator of Dead Man's
Curve goodbye. The Daily will not
be the same without him.
