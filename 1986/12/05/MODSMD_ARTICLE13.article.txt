# Students propose arts theme house
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
Students interested in establishing
an arts theme house met last night to
discuss submitting a proposal to Resi
dential Education if more students
show support for the idea.
"I want to incorporate performing
arts, visual arts and literary arts into the
arts theme â€” basically anything that is
creative," said sophomore Susan
Jancso, who organized the meeting
held in Cardenal lounge.
Students interested in a new theme
house must submit a written proposal
by Jan. 15, according to guidelines rec
ommended by the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies. Sophomores,
juniors and seniors would be eligible
for assignment to the arts theme
house.
In order to be accepted, the pro
posal must show that the number of
students requesting priority assign
ment would fill the house. In addition,
another 25 percent would have to re
quest priority to safeguard against
vacancies caused by students going
overseas or stopping out.
"You have to show the University
that it's worthwhile," said Jancso, add
ing that she hopes more students will
attend another meeting tonight. Only
three students attended last night's
meeting.
Residential Education assists stu
dents wishing to establish new theme

houses, according to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson.
"We help identify interested faculty
and help the students in writing up a
proposal so they'll have a better
chance of success," he said.
An arts theme house would have to
replace a current house because there
is no unused space on campus for
housing, according to Robinson.
"It's a zero-sum game. The new
theme house would have to go into an
already-existing facility, one that's
already occupied by another group,"
he said.
"That's always difficult. But if we're
going to have a fluid and exciting Res
Ed program, there has to be a way to
change things around," Robinson said.
Jancso said she does not have a par
ticular house targeted for restructur
ing, but she has several ideas for the
proposed theme house.
"I'd like to have a large space that
can either be turned into a perfor
mance area with stage and seating or
used as a gallery space. And practice
rooms would be good," she said.
Theme houses originated at Stan
ford in the late 19605. There are five
academic and three ethnic theme
houses on campus now.
The Columbae, Synergy and Terra
student cooperatives were also theme
houses at one time, Robinson said.
"That themes come and go is not a
bad thing," he said. "Their times come
and go."
