## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper A 						capital decision 
### 
A New Mexico man saved five people's lives last week,
but he won't be hailed as a national hero or invited to a
Rose Garden reception with President Reagan.
Outgoing New Mexico Governor Toney Anaya
commuted the sentences of all five men on his state's
death row, and for this courageous decision, he will
probably receive more derision than support.
While Anaya's action will only make a small dent in the
total of 1,789 men and women currently sentenced to die
in the United States, it is still a commendable one.
The death penalty is wrong.
Proponents of capital punishment rationalize by
saying it will lower the number of violent crimes, but this
has not clearly been the case. Most murders are commit
ted in the heat of the moment when the killer would give
little thought to the ramifications of his actions.
When a government begins to justify killing its own
citizens, it takes the first step on the road to fascism. At
torney General Edwin Meese advocates increasing the
number of crimes punishable by the death penalty.
Where does it stop? The United States condemns other
nations for human rights violations, but it shows the
same disregard for human life.
The death penalty is brutal and insensitive. Proponents
claim it's painless, but Stephen Morin, who endured
while Texas executioners searched 40 minutes for a vein
in which to shoot his lethal injection, would probably

disagree if he were still alive. Morris Macon, a mentally
retarded man executed in Virginia, might feel the same
way.
It's hypocritical as well as morally wrong to punish
murderers by murdering them. Our criminal justice sys
tem seeks to educate and reform through the use of
punishment, but dead men can not be reformed or ed
ucated.
There are considerations of a more practical nature
that also reveal capital punishment as senseless. Courts
make mistakes, but there is no way these errors can be
rectified once the accused is executed. A recent study
commissioned by the American Civil Liberties Union
found that 343 people sentenced to die in the 20th cen
tury had actually been innocent, and 25 of those were ex
ecuted nonetheless.
The death penalty has also been found to have a racial
bias. Someone killing a white man is six times more
likely to be executed than the murderer of a non-white.
However, with Chief Justice Rose Bird slated to be
replaced by conservative nominee Malcolm Lucas, Cali
fornia will likely see a rapid increase in the number of
government-sponsored executions. This is what the
people of California want.
Perhaps they should consider a 1985 New York Times
editorial, which asked, "How popular would capital
punishment be if each person favoring it were asked to
throw the switch?"
