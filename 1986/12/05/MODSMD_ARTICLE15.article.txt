# Porno study threatens a free press
## 
### 
Thomas Jefferson said he would rather have
newspapers without government than government
without newspapers. Obviously, he was a strong
believer in a free press. To ensure such an idea, it is
necessary that our freedom of the press and of
speech, whether pornographic or not, continues to
be protected by the First Amendment against any
government regulation.

Last May, Attorney General Edwin Meese and his
commission published a study concluding that a
causal relationship does indeed exist between
sexually violent or degrading pornography and vio
lence toward women. Granted, pornography is
morally and ethically wrong; however, the implica
tions of this study for increased governmental regula
tion diminution of our freedom
! within society serious political issues that
i need to btf&dtiressed. The Meese commission made
an overstated and rather rash conclusion that was not
based on sound scientific research methods. The
results of this study are now being used as an excuse
by law-makers and anti-pornography activists to sup
press sexually oriented material and to justify making
new laws and regulations to censor pornography,
which otherwise should be protected by the First
Amendment.
One major reason why the findings of this study
should not be supported is simply that they are not
representative of good social science research. The
primary fault of the study is confusing correlation
with cause. Many other causal variables related to
violence toward women were not addressed, let
alone controlled, in this study. For example, level of
education or socioeconomic status are other possi
ble variables affecting the outcome. Perhaps even the
violent material on television should have been
studied as an alternative cause of violence toward
women rather than pornography. Two of the re
search scientists who collected data for the Meese
study, Judith Becker and Ellen Levine, denied that
there was any causal link between pornography and
sex crimes. They also said the commission was
biased in its conclusion since it ignored contradic
tory evidence.
Another fault of the study was its operationaliza
tion of pornographic material; that is, the majority of
the pornographic material used in the study was ex
tremely violent, and since not all pornographic ma
terial is that violent, the pornography used in the
study was not representative of all types of pornogra
phy. An additional factor that reduces the credibility
of the Meese study is the fact that in 1970, a presiden
tial panel researching the same subject found no
such link between violence and sexually explicit ma

terial, and they even went so far as to recommend a
repeal of the federal obscenity laws.
When analyzing the psychological behaviors of
people, it is sometimes difficult to establish temporal
precedence between the attitude and the behavior.
In criticizing the commission's conclusion that por
nography causes violence, we must ask if it is possi
ble that the causal relationship could be reversed,
thereby making the conclusion invalid? Perhaps
people who commit violent sex crimes tend to read
more pornographic material (and this explains the
positive correlation) rather than the other way
around. I think more research, however, is definitely
needed before any conclusions of causal relation
ships can be made.
The issue of consumer rights with regard to gov
ernment regulation is of great importance. A mature
adult living in a free society should have the choice
of unrestricted access to pornographic material if he
so desires. But the Meese commission is now calling
for Congress to amend federal obscenity laws and for
the Federal Communications Commission to impose
sanctions against cable and satellite television pro
grams that transmit obscene programs. Supporters of
the First Amendment should fight back because this
is a blatant censorship. If the government is allowed
to pursue this route of censorship and regulation, the
entire institution of the media faces a major threat. By
regulating the consumption or even the production
of pornography, our government will be condoning
censorship.
If Congress is put in charge of these regulatory ac
tions of censorship, such difficult questions as what
actually constitutes a pornographic work or where is
the line drawn on what is obscene or offensive will
create much disagreement. Congressional regulation
of pornographic materials will have serious contro
versial implications for where the future boundaries
will be drawn in restricting certain productions of
the media and not others. Is the government to be
given the right to decide what is and what is not
proper viewing material for grown adults capable of
making that choice themselves? No, government in
tervention with the rights of a free press should not
be tolerated.
When economically analyzing this controversial
issue of pornography, it is important to remember
that we do live in a free, capitalistic society. The pro
duction and sale of pornography is a multi-billion
dollar industry pursued by entrepreneurs for pure
capital gain. When all pornography sales from
magazines to movies are added up, it comes to an
amazing $8 billion a year. If the pornography indus
try is regulated, it will not only infringe on the rights
of a free press, but it will also infringe on the right to
pursue a capital venture within a free country such as
the United States. I believe that privately owned (as
opposed to government-owned) industries have the
right to pursue their own free enterprise without

government regulation.
New media technologies have contributed to a
proliferation of diverse material in the pornography
industry. Previously, most pornographic material ap
peared only in magazines and cinemas; now pornog
raphy is becoming very commonplace in people's
own living rooms through cable and satellite televi
sion and VCRs. Pornography, then, is no longer
something that people seek out at newsstands or
movie houses; it now comes right to their homes and
is obtainable with little effort at all. It seems that the
video media may be functionally displacing
magazines as a source for sexually explicit material.
To restrict pornography would be indirectly to
restrict the prevalence and growth of these new tech
nologies. For there are some people who subscribe
to cable television just so they can receive the
Playboy channel. As with non-pornographic material,
pornography is making use of these new channels of
media with increasing numbers. Again, the First
Amendment guarantees the rights of the people to
have unlimited access to these new channels of
media developed by technology.
In analyzing the issue of pornography, I can see
five reasons why pornography should be left to free
reign without government regulation. Preventing
government regulation of pornography ensures the
continuation of our rights of free speech and of free
press under the First Amendment without fear of
censorship, and also ensures an unregulated envi
ronment for private industries to pursue capital
goals. The fact that pornography remains free of cen
sorship, not the mere existence of pornography it
self, indirectly affects the improvement and expan
sion of the media institution. By preventing censor
ship policies that could impede future programming
of the media as well as impede the media's grasp and
experimentation with new technologies, the media
are thus left to expand in any way they choose with
out government regulation. The point here is not that
pornography is good and that it should be continued
per se, but that it just should not be restricted be
cause, in doing so, many of the fundamental prin
ciples of our democracy would be put in jeopardy.
Furthermore, because the conclusion reached by
the Meese commission was not completely valid
scientifically, we cannot be confident that pornogra
phy is the single culprit attributable to violence
toward women. In support of an unregulated media,
I cite in conclusion the declaration made in August
1985 by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals: "Under
the First Amendment, the government must leave to
the people the evaluation of ideas One of the
things that separates our society from others is our
absolute right to propagate opinions that the govern
ment finds wrong or even hateful."

more pornographic material (and this explains the
positive correlation) rather than the other way
around. I think more research, however, is definitely
needed before any conclusions of causal relation
ships can be made.
The issue of consumer rights with regard to gov
ernment regulation is of great importance. A mature
adult living in a free society should have the choice
of unrestricted access to pornographic material if he
so desires. But the Meese commission is now calling
for Congress to amend federal obscenity laws and for
the Federal Communications Commission to impose
sanctions against cable and satellite television pro
grams that transmit obscene programs. Supporters of
the First Amendment should fight back because this
is a blatant censorship. If the government is allowed
to pursue this route of censorship and regulation, the
entire institution of the media faces a major threat. By
regulating the consumption or even the production
of pornography, our government will be condoning
censorship.
If Congress is put in charge of these regulatory ac
tions of censorship, such difficult questions as what
actually constitutes a pornographic work or where is
the line drawn on what is obscene or offensive will
create much disagreement. Congressional regulation
of pornographic materials will have serious contro
versial implications for where the future boundaries
will be drawn in restricting certain productions of
the media and not others. Is the government to be
given the right to decide what is and what is not
proper viewing material for grown adults capable of
making that choice themselves? No, government in
tervention with the rights of a free press should not
be tolerated.
When economically analyzing this controversial
issue of pornography, it is important to remember
that we do live in a free, capitalistic society. The pro
duction and sale of pornography is a multi-billion
dollar industry pursued by entrepreneurs for pure
capital gain. When all pornography sales from
magazines to movies are added up, it comes to an
amazing $8 billion a year. If the pornography indus
try is regulated, it will not only infringe on the rights
of a free press, but it will also infringe on the right to
pursue a capital venture within a free country such as
the United States. I believe that privately owned (as
opposed to government-owned) industries have the
right to pursue their own free enterprise without

government regulation.
New media technologies have contributed to a
proliferation of diverse material in the pornography
industry. Previously, most pornographic material ap
peared only in magazines and cinemas; now pornog
raphy is becoming very commonplace in people's
own living rooms through cable and satellite televi
sion and VCRs. Pornography, then, is no longer
something that people seek out at newsstands or
movie houses; it now comes right to their homes and
is obtainable with little effort at all. It seems that the
video media may be functionally displacing
magazines as a source for sexually explicit material.
To restrict pornography would be indirectly to
restrict the prevalence and growth of these new tech
nologies. For there are some people who subscribe
to cable television just so they can receive the
Playboy channel. As with non-pornographic material,
pornography is making use of these new channels of
media with increasing numbers. Again, the First
Amendment guarantees the rights of the people to
have unlimited access to these new channels of
media developed by technology.
In analyzing the issue of pornography, I can see
five reasons why pornography should be left to free
reign without government regulation. Preventing
government regulation of pornography ensures the
continuation of our rights of free speech and of free
press under the First Amendment without fear of
censorship, and also ensures an unregulated envi
ronment for private industries to pursue capital
goals. The fact that pornography remains free of cen
sorship, not the mere existence of pornography it
self, indirectly affects the improvement and expan
sion of the media institution. By preventing censor
ship policies that could impede future programming
of the media as well as impede the media's grasp and
experimentation with new technologies, the media
are thus left to expand in any way they choose with
out government regulation. The point here is not that
pornography is good and that it should be continued
per se, but that it just should not be restricted be
cause, in doing so, many of the fundamental prin
ciples of our democracy would be put in jeopardy.
Furthermore, because the conclusion reached by
the Meese commission was not completely valid
scientifically, we cannot be confident that pornogra
phy is the single culprit attributable to violence
toward women. In support of an unregulated media,
I cite in conclusion the declaration made in August
1985 by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals: "Under
the First Amendment, the government must leave to
the people the evaluation of ideas One of the
things that separates our society from others is our
absolute right to propagate opinions that the govern
ment finds wrong or even hateful."

Thomas Jefferson said he would rather have
newspapers without government than government
without newspapers. Obviously, he was a strong
believer in a free press. To ensure such an idea, it is
necessary that our freedom of the press and of
speech, whether pornographic or not, continues to
be protected by the First Amendment against any
government regulation.

Last May, Attorney General Edwin Meese and his
commission published a study concluding that a
causal relationship does indeed exist between
sexually violent or degrading pornography and vio
lence toward women. Granted, pornography is
morally and ethically wrong; however, the implica
tions of this study for increased governmental regula
tion diminution of our freedom
! within society serious political issues that
i need to btf&dtiressed. The Meese commission made
an overstated and rather rash conclusion that was not
based on sound scientific research methods. The
results of this study are now being used as an excuse
by law-makers and anti-pornography activists to sup
press sexually oriented material and to justify making
new laws and regulations to censor pornography,
which otherwise should be protected by the First
Amendment.
One major reason why the findings of this study
should not be supported is simply that they are not
representative of good social science research. The
primary fault of the study is confusing correlation
with cause. Many other causal variables related to
violence toward women were not addressed, let
alone controlled, in this study. For example, level of
education or socioeconomic status are other possi
ble variables affecting the outcome. Perhaps even the
violent material on television should have been
studied as an alternative cause of violence toward
women rather than pornography. Two of the re
search scientists who collected data for the Meese
study, Judith Becker and Ellen Levine, denied that
there was any causal link between pornography and
sex crimes. They also said the commission was
biased in its conclusion since it ignored contradic
tory evidence.
Another fault of the study was its operationaliza
tion of pornographic material; that is, the majority of
the pornographic material used in the study was ex
tremely violent, and since not all pornographic ma
terial is that violent, the pornography used in the
study was not representative of all types of pornogra
phy. An additional factor that reduces the credibility
of the Meese study is the fact that in 1970, a presiden
tial panel researching the same subject found no
such link between violence and sexually explicit ma

terial, and they even went so far as to recommend a
repeal of the federal obscenity laws.
When analyzing the psychological behaviors of
people, it is sometimes difficult to establish temporal
precedence between the attitude and the behavior.
In criticizing the commission's conclusion that por
nography causes violence, we must ask if it is possi
ble that the causal relationship could be reversed,
thereby making the conclusion invalid? Perhaps
people who commit violent sex crimes tend to read
more pornographic material (and this explains the
positive correlation) rather than the other way
around. I think more research, however, is definitely
needed before any conclusions of causal relation
