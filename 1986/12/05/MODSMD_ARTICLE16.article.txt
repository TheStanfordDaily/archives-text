A recent story about lowa contained some unwar
ranted and unfair comments (Daily, Nov. 24). In his
article, the writer ridicules lowans for their
stereotypes of Stanford. In the process, he
stereotypes lowans as boring, unimaginative farmers,
proving that he is just as ignorant as his portrayal of
the people he interviews.

First of all, the story presents only one side of the
issue. It gives no indication of how many people
were interviewed, or, of those interviewed, how
many did in fact have a clear conception of Stanford
University. Instead, its writer selectively uses quotes
in order to ridicule and belittle lowans as ignorant.
The story then goes on to generalize that "when
someone mentions the Farm, the first tiling they
probably think of is the place they grew up." If the
writer were truly concerned with presenting lowans'
perceptions of Stanford, he would have presented
both sides equally and perhaps asked some lowans
attending Stanford for their input. Instead, he is more
interested in ridiculing lowans and making "good
print."
Secondly, why do lowans "owe a longer look at
Stanford'? Since they are not on the West Coast,
lowans receive far less exposure to Stanford than do
Californians. Many people in lowa are content to
study in the Midwest or would prefer not to spend a

fortune traveling to and attending a big name school.
This is not to say lowans don't have the academic
skills necessary to attend Stanford. On the contrary,
the Chronicle of Higher Education shows that the
state of lowa has led the nation for the past two years
with its SAT and ACT scores. Government studies
also rank lowa's public education system among the
top three in the country.
So, the rest of the country isn't any smarter or less
ignorant than Iowa; it's just that many lowans prefer
to stay in state for their education. What makes the
writer think that Stanford is so important that lowans
"owe a longer look" at it? Perhaps some Stanford stu
dents, especially the reporter, owe a longer look at

lowa. Many students in my dorm couldn't point to
the state of lowa on a map, let alone the University of
lowa. Others commented, "Oh yeah, isn't that where
they grow potatoes?"
This ignorance is tolerable, even at the best univer
sity in the country'. The unjustified attack on the Uni
versity of lowa and the state of lowa, however, is not.
Just because lowans don't bow down and worship
Stanford University, they are portrayed as simple
minded and inferior. The reporter ridicules the lowa
band and its conservative nature compared to the
Stanford Band. He also labels the football team as

"bloodthirsty" and belittles its victory against a 2-8
Purdue team. He portrays lowa's unimaginative and
boring nightlife as consisting of "Burger King, Pizza
Hut and Rocky Rococco's." On the contrary, the Uni
versity of lowa has a very active nightlife, with
numerous bars and nightclubs on campus. What's
more, a social ritual called "dating" exists at lowa,
which is something I have yet to witness at Stanford.
After criticizing lowans for their ignorance and
stereotypes, the writer goes on to display his own. He
portrays virtually all lowans as farmers, saying that
"the Farm here is Dad's." I've lived in lowa all my life
and never even been on a farm. At my house, we
even have indoor plumbing. Compared to California,
there are a lot of farmers in lowa. This doesn't mean,
however, that the people here are any better or
smarter. The article rightfully states that some of
lowans' stereotypes about Stanford might "make
Donald Kennedy cringe." Yet I wonder how Herbert
Hoover, a native lowan, would respond to these
ridicules and stereotypes. Or perhaps the writer of
the story has never heard of Herbert Hoover.
Don't get me wrong I love Stanford as much as
anyone. In my opinion and in the opinion of U.S.
News 8c World Report, Stanford is the best univer
sity in the country. This fact, however, doesn't justify
the elitist and condescending attitude expressed in
the story At a university that claims to be diverse and
globally minded, I was disappointed to read such a
slanted and narrow-minded article.

Stanford Band. He also labels the football team as

"bloodthirsty" and belittles its victory against a 2-8
Purdue team. He portrays lowa's unimaginative and
boring nightlife as consisting of "Burger King, Pizza
Hut and Rocky Rococco's." On the contrary, the Uni
versity of lowa has a very active nightlife, with
numerous bars and nightclubs on campus. What's
more, a social ritual called "dating" exists at lowa,
which is something I have yet to witness at Stanford.
After criticizing lowans for their ignorance and
stereotypes, the writer goes on to display his own. He
portrays virtually all lowans as farmers, saying that
"the Farm here is Dad's." I've lived in lowa all my life
and never even been on a farm. At my house, we
even have indoor plumbing. Compared to California,
there are a lot of farmers in lowa. This doesn't mean,
however, that the people here are any better or
smarter. The article rightfully states that some of
lowans' stereotypes about Stanford might "make
Donald Kennedy cringe." Yet I wonder how Herbert
Hoover, a native lowan, would respond to these
ridicules and stereotypes. Or perhaps the writer of
the story has never heard of Herbert Hoover.
Don't get me wrong I love Stanford as much as
anyone. In my opinion and in the opinion of U.S.
News 8c World Report, Stanford is the best univer
sity in the country. This fact, however, doesn't justify
the elitist and condescending attitude expressed in
the story At a university that claims to be diverse and
globally minded, I was disappointed to read such a
slanted and narrow-minded article.
