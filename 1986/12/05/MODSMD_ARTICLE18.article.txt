Smokers; Don't
poison others
I am writing in response to Chris
Adamson's editorial on smokers
(Daily, Dec. 2).
Adamson seemed to quote facts
only when they were useful. Yes,
scientific studies have been done that
show AIDS cannot be transmitted
through casual contact. And the Easter
Bunny probably does not exist. But
studies have also shown that in
cidences of cancer and other illness
are higher in people who live and/or
work with people who smoke heavily.
In addition, while the Bill of Rights
does protect your right to inflict harm
to your body, it does not give you the
right to harm others.
Enough of the illnesses that
smoking can cause. Born with severe
asthma, I was not expected to live
long. As a result, I was in and out of
hospitals often during my childhood.
However, due to modern medicine
and a competitive spirit, I managed to
become a somewhat successful col
lege athlete in, of all places, Los An
geles. Yet, even now, when in a room
with smokers, I begin to wheeze and
become weak. Is it truly immoral of
me to ask people to stop smoking
when they are so obviously affecting
my health? Or do they have the right
to ruin my health so that they can
enjoy smoking?
Before the laws requiring smoking
sections in public places such as
restaurants and airplanes, life was very
difficult indeed. Still, tell me you've
never been in a large public room
where the smoke was so thick that the
other side was lost in the haze. Tell
me you've never been on an airplane
where a thick haze of smoke was
encroaching on the non-smoking
section. I lived through third stage
smog alerts in Los Angeles where the
air was never as thick as in those
situations. Perhaps, as you say, lung
cancer is in the atmosphere waiting
for me anyway, but being forced to sit
next to a smoker in a confined space
(such as an airplane) is totally unac
ceptable.
I do agree with you on one point: It
everyone's choice to do harm to
themselves and"the rest of the world
has no right to pass judgment on their
self-destructiveness." But a line must

be drawn when this choice begins to
affect other people. Chris, please feel
free to poison your body in whatever
way you may wish, but don't inflict
your bad habits on me.

Health isn't only
whine vs. smokers
In "Smokers vs. Non-smokers"
(Daily, Dec. 2), Chris Adamson pred
icates his entire argument on the
assumption that "the premier whine"
of non-smokers is that they are being
exposed to a health risk. From my
experience, this is seldom the case. If
you've ever sat downwind of a
campfire you know that smoke can be
very irritating to the eyes and lungs.
Some people are simply more
physiologically sensitive to smoke
than others, and the smoke from a
nearby cigarette is plenty to cause
them serious discomfort. My little
brother doesn't have any respiratory
problems, but whenever my mom lit
up in the car, he would start coughing
involuntarily and insist that she put it
out.
A small amount of smoke can be
sensed by one's taste buds and olfac
tory nerve, and, whether it is particu
larly offensive on its own, it can ruin a
meal. If I sit down to a pizza, I don't
particularly want the smell of Lucky
Strikes mixed in.
No, I am not appalled by the arrest
of five businessmen who wouldn't
stop smoking in a non-smoking sec
tion on a plane. Did they consider the
comfort of those around them? What
about the woman with emphysema
behind them? Do they or you know
anything about the risks of combus
tion in aircraft?
What I do find appalling is the
columnist's shallow analysis and
flippant attitude. Even in a casual
article, 1 think one should take more
time to understand an issue. And I
find such statements as, "If someone
exhales smoke in your face, you have
every reason to want to assault them
physically," to be downright immature
no matter what the tone of the piece.

I do agree with you on one point: It
everyone's choice to do harm to
themselves and"the rest of the world
has no right to pass judgment on their
self-destructiveness." But a line must

be drawn when this choice begins to
affect other people. Chris, please feel
free to poison your body in whatever
way you may wish, but don't inflict
your bad habits on me.

Health isn't only
whine vs. smokers
In "Smokers vs. Non-smokers"
(Daily, Dec. 2), Chris Adamson pred
icates his entire argument on the
assumption that "the premier whine"
of non-smokers is that they are being
exposed to a health risk. From my
experience, this is seldom the case. If
you've ever sat downwind of a
campfire you know that smoke can be
very irritating to the eyes and lungs.
Some people are simply more
physiologically sensitive to smoke
than others, and the smoke from a
nearby cigarette is plenty to cause
them serious discomfort. My little
brother doesn't have any respiratory
problems, but whenever my mom lit
up in the car, he would start coughing
involuntarily and insist that she put it
out.
A small amount of smoke can be
sensed by one's taste buds and olfac
tory nerve, and, whether it is particu
larly offensive on its own, it can ruin a
meal. If I sit down to a pizza, I don't
particularly want the smell of Lucky
Strikes mixed in.
No, I am not appalled by the arrest
of five businessmen who wouldn't
stop smoking in a non-smoking sec
tion on a plane. Did they consider the
comfort of those around them? What
about the woman with emphysema
behind them? Do they or you know
anything about the risks of combus
tion in aircraft?
What I do find appalling is the
columnist's shallow analysis and
flippant attitude. Even in a casual
article, 1 think one should take more
time to understand an issue. And I
find such statements as, "If someone
exhales smoke in your face, you have
every reason to want to assault them
physically," to be downright immature
no matter what the tone of the piece.
