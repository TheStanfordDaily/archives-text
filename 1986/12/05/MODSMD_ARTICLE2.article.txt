Yesterday's visit by South African Gatsha Buthelezi, a
noted opponent of divestment, does not signal a change in
the policies of the Commission on Investment Responsibil
ity, said CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier. Rather, Buthelezi's
arguments provide a new perspective in the divestment
debate, Hillier said.
Buthelezi, chief minister of the Kwa-Zulu homeland in
South Africa, spoke out against divestment by U.S. institu

based in Washington, D.C., "To many of his black critics,
Buthelezi is an extension of the South African government,
rather an opponent of it."
Members of the student protest groups Stanford Out of

and greeted Buthelezi by chanting "Buthelezi, Botha's
lackey," referring to South African President Pieter Botha. A
sign read, "You can't hide, we know you're on apartheid's
side."
Demonstrators worried that Buthelezi's visit signaled a
shift in administration policy of selective divestment based
on a company's record of race relations in South Africa.
"Having Chief (Gatsha) Buthelezi appear as a guest of CIR
is ominous and should be criticized strongly," Emeritus An
thropology Prof. St Claire Drake told a group of 35
protesters.
"It is insulting and a repudiation of a lot of work and ef

and administrators," Drake said. "I believe this is a precur-
