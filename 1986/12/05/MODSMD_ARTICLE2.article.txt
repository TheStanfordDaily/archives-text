# CIR: Buthelezi talk will not change policy

Yesterday's visit by South African Gatsha Buthelezi, a
noted opponent of divestment, does not signal a change in
the policies of the Commission on Investment Responsibil
ity, said CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier. Rather, Buthelezi's
arguments provide a new perspective in the divestment
debate, Hillier said.
Buthelezi, chief minister of the Kwa-Zulu homeland in
South Africa, spoke out against divestment by U.S. institu
tions holding stock in South Africa and U.S. sanctions against
the pro-apartheid government of South Africa. Speaking to
members of the CIR and other trustees at Bowman Alumni
House, Buthelezi also advocated a policy of non-violence.
Buthelezi is a well-known opponent of the African Na
tional Congress (ANC), the major opposition party to the
South African government.
"It is truth that Buthelezi is a controversial figure," Hillier
said. "It is incumbent upon us to listen to all viewpoints crit
cally, to enlist a broad range of viewpoints."
According to the Investor Responsibilty Research Center,
based in Washington, D.C., "To many of his black critics,
Buthelezi is an extension of the South African government,
rather an opponent of it."
Members of the student protest groups Stanford Out of
South Africa and Uprising demonstrated outside Bowman
and greeted Buthelezi by chanting "Buthelezi, Botha's
lackey," referring to South African President Pieter Botha. A
sign read, "You can't hide, we know you're on apartheid's
side."
Demonstrators worried that Buthelezi's visit signaled a
shift in administration policy of selective divestment based
on a company's record of race relations in South Africa.
"Having Chief (Gatsha) Buthelezi appear as a guest of CIR
is ominous and should be criticized strongly," Emeritus An
thropology Prof. St Claire Drake told a group of 35
protesters.
"It is insulting and a repudiation of a lot of work and ef
fort toward a policy of divestment in South Africa by faculty
and administrators," Drake said. "I believe this is a precur-

sor to change in policy," he added.
According to Hillier, the CIR did not
invite Buthelezi to Stanford. "He asked
if he could come," Hillier said.
In his address to the CIR, Buthelezi
said sanctions and divestment by uni
versities would destroy the South
African economy.
"I respect Americans for feeling a
conscience streak," he said. "But, my
own feeling is if you withdraw, you
remove the only leverage you have
I see it as a matter that affects the
whole south continent."
Reform is on the way in South Africa,
but a timetable cannot be set because
"we are living in an area of great ten
sion and black-on-black violence," he
said.
Buthelezi said he advocates the
release of ANC leader Nelson Mandela
and other prominent black leaders in
South Africa because South Africa's
government will not be seen as
legitimate until all black political
prisoners have been released.
He said that a future government
should provide for racial equality, but
that nothing will be accomplished until
a policy of compromise and non
violence is adopted.
"I think one-man-one-vote is a
cherished ideal of all black South
Africans," Buthelezi said. "But I've said
in many speeches, if whites don't com

promise, if blacks don't compromise,
they'll destroy each other."
According to Drake, if the CIR were
sincere in its efforts, it would have
invited Leon Sullivan, the author of the

Sullivan Principles, to present the op
posing viewpoint. The Sullivan Prin
ciples are a code that rates companies
by their racial policies in South Africa.
Buthelezi's visit "is just legitimizing

him," Drake said. "He has no business
being in the alumni house here. He
has business being at the White House,
though, because he is in the same
camp as Reagan."
