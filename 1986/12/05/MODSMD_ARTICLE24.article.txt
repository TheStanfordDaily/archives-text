## Traditional procession celebrates Christmas 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
Christmas traditions abound in
America: candy canes, lights, trees,
stockings, the Grinch, the Sears cata
log.
Stanford students can experience a
less familiar Christmas tradition
tonight, as the Mexican-American com
munity of Stanford celebrates its tradi
tional "Posada," a festive reenactment
of Joseph and Mary 's journey through
Bethlehem.
Stanford's fourth annual Gran
Posada, co-sponsored by El Centro
Chicano and Casa Zapata, will begin at
7 p.m. at Casa Zapata and wind its way
around campus to Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
At the I-Center, a traditional Mexican
Christmas play, the "Pastorela," will be
performed, and Mexican refreshments
will be offered.
Both events are open to the public.
This is the first year that the Posada
will go around to dormitories on
campus, according to junior Marai
Meier, El Centro Chicano student co
ordinator and Casa Zapata resident.
Meier said the program is an effort to
make students from outside the
Mexican-American community feel
welcome at the event.

"Our whole purpose in going to
dorms is outreach," she explained.
"Most of us have experienced this (the
Posada) at home, and we want to let
others share in our celebration."
The Posada (which is Spanish for
"inn") is meant to reenact Joseph and
Mary's travels through Bethlehem in
search of an inn.
The tradition in Mexico, according
to Meier, is that the procession goes
from house to house, stopping at each
house to sing a song "asking to be let
in." Like Joseph and Mary, the group
is turned away and keeps going on.
The procession eventually "ends up at
someone's house where there is a big
party," Meier said.
The Stanford Posada will go from
dorm to dorm, beginning at Casa
Zapata in Stern Hall, moving to Wilbur
Hall, to Branner Hall, back past Stern
Hall, through White Plaza to Florence
Moore Hall and finally to the I-Center.
The candlelight procession will in
clude children from the Barrio Assis
tance program dressed as Joseph and
Mary and other characters. There will
also be strolling mariachi musicians.
At each stop along the way, the
procession will sing a verse of the
traditional Posada song, "asking to be
let in."
The party at the end of the Posada,

according to Meier, is primarily "a so
cial celebration, even though it has a
religious theme, too."
Food at the party (for which dona
tions will be requested) will include
tamales, chocolate and pandulce
(Mexican sweet bread).
The party will include all those who
took pan in the procession, plus over
50 children from the Palo Alto Barrio
Assistance program, Meier said. The
children will have their annual
Christmas party at El Centro Chicano in
Old Union during the Posada, and will
then join the celebration at the I-
Center.
Part of that celebration will be the
performance of the Pastorela. The Pas
torela (Spanish for "shepherd's song"),
is a traditional play about the Nativity,
including "Joseph, Mary, angels, devils
and shepherds," according to Meier.
"It's very much like street theater,"
she said. "It's traditionally done by the
people of the village; they go from
street to street, and end up at the
(local) church."
The Pastorela, a mix of singing,
dancing and acting, will be performed
at 8 p.m. by the Ballet Folklorico of
Stanford, a division of the University
Dance Department.
It will be "mostly in English," ac
cording to Meier.
