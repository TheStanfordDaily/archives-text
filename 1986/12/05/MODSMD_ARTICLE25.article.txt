God rest ye merry programmers
Caroling elves from the Kappa Sigma fraternity and Kappa Alpha Theta sorority brought holiday cheer to
folks sequestered in LOTS Wednesday night. The group originally set out in hopes of caroling for University
President Donald Kennedy at the Lou Henry Hoover House, only to find he was still in Japan, according to
sophomore Andy Weng, a Kappa Sig pledge. Leaving Kennedy's house, the happy holiday harmonizers
"decided to go wish some cheer to the people working on programs in LOTS," Weng said.
