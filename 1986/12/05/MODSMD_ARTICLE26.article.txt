Love and Rockets — "Express"
Review for pop listeners: xy-squared

(x+2Xx2)
Two-review total: 8. Mean: 4. Range: 2.
SD: 1.
Love and Rockets is a British under
ground band that has somehow found
its way onto an American label and into
The Wherehouse, which means it has
melody and some fairly upbeat tunes
without drowning it out with effects
and feedback. Its sound is a combina
tion of '60s psychedelia complete with
harmonies and modern punk-derived
guitar and synthetic effects, which
make for dancable, intelligent songs
like "Ball of Confusion" and "Yin and
Yang the Flowerpot Man." In an at
tempt to completely befuddle our au
dience, we've written two separate
reviews of the band's "Express" album.
Review for pop listeners
Pluses: There is an effort to bring in
melody. If you get this album, you can
break away from the trendy pop crowd
and get in with the trendy under
ground crowd. You can sing along with
it and even hum it to yourself over
lunch.
Minuses: There is a guitar, and it
doesn't sound like Bruce
Springsteen's. The guitar is wired for
ultra-fuzz, ultra-static, ultra-feedback.
The vocals are often deep and eerie
and could drive your children bananas
as they sing "Alcohol is your yoga,
baaaybeee."

It may seem a wee bit strange to the
uninitiated to combine these two
releases, but when you think about it,
what's the difference between review
ing five records by The Boss and
reviewing six records either by Bruce
or by the Durannies? Quantitatively not
much. And quality-wise, too, they have
a lot in common.
As you may know, Roger Taylor and
Andy Taylor left Duran Duran for soon

to-be prolific solo and guest star
careers, leaving John Taylor, Nick
Rhodes and Simon Leßon to carry on
with the mantle of the Terrific Three.
As you may not know, Bruce
Springsteen's new five-album set does
not feature the E Street Band at all,
since Bruce was dissatisfied with the
quality of the Band's concert perfor
mances. Instead, Bruce got together on
a New Jersey baseball diamond with
pals Phil Collins, Kiki Dee, Mel Tillis,
Danny "Partridge Family" Bonaduce
(who plays a mean bass in real life,
too) and the aforementioned un
employed Taylors. With Bruce's family
and neighbors as an audience, the
group duplicated the 10-year history of
Springsteen live with the E Street
Band, meeting Bruce's demanding
standards. Not surprisingly, then, the
results are extremely enjoyable, and
the bonus full-color, 172 page booklet
of photos documenting the event com
pliments the music quite well.
On "Notorious," Duran Duran con
tinue their tradition of wailing away

about anything that sounds even
remotely mystical. Simon's voice has
never been more annoyingly grating,
and John's guitar has never been less
absent. Conversely, those of you put off
by Bruce's scratchy, heartfelt vocalizing
will greatly appreciate his new release.
He does a wild, helium-induced "TV
Commercial Theme" medley that will
have you in stitches. Also a pleasant
surprise is side eight, composed en
tirely of 10 years' worth of audience
applause, yells for more and the sound
of lighters being lit. In addition,
Bruce's guitar, which he endearingly
calls "Ol' Wanda Beth" (a cut on side
two is devoted to it), is given plenty of
room to shine, particularly on the top
notch acoustic rendition of "Roller
coaster (of Love)."
Meanwhile, back with Duran
squared, the fellows seem to have
really lost their magic touch for turn
ing a clever synthesizer riff, a sultry
female moan and a couple of nifty
drum fills into a peppy disco/new
wave nugget to be treasured by
generations of teens. Instead, they wal
low miserably in their all-too-rapidly
approaching late-20s and subsequent
unoriginality. Perhaps they look back
wistfully on the days when they turned
down a chance to star in a cartoon se
ries.
Overall, "Notorious" isn't the
hoped-for reprieve from the current
Duran Duran of pathetic pop that
began with "The Reflex" and plowed
through "The Wild Boys," "A View to a
Kill" and other atrocities. Its only
redeeming feature is the possibility of
happenin' 12-inch remixes of the faster
cuts, which are disappointingly few
and far between. But don't let this ruin
your holiday season, because "Live
1975-85" succeeds beyond any expec
tations, with its only clunker being
Bruce and wife Julianne's Christmas
time reading of The Beatles'
"Revolution 9." But even that makes
for interesting music with which to
stuff stockings. "Live 1975-85" is worth
every penny of its $39-99 list price. But
shop around; I got my copy from this
guy in the parking lot of Tower
Records for only six bucks.

melody and some fairly upbeat tunes
without drowning it out with effects
and feedback. Its sound is a combina
tion of '60s psychedelia complete with
harmonies and modern punk-derived
guitar and synthetic effects, which
make for dancable, intelligent songs
like "Ball of Confusion" and "Yin and
Yang the Flowerpot Man." In an at
tempt to completely befuddle our au
dience, we've written two separate
reviews of the band's "Express" album.
Review for pop listeners
Pluses: There is an effort to bring in
melody. If you get this album, you can
break away from the trendy pop crowd
and get in with the trendy under
ground crowd. You can sing along with
it and even hum it to yourself over
lunch.
Minuses: There is a guitar, and it
doesn't sound like Bruce
Springsteen's. The guitar is wired for
ultra-fuzz, ultra-static, ultra-feedback.
The vocals are often deep and eerie
and could drive your children bananas
as they sing "Alcohol is your yoga,
baaaybeee."
Review for underground listeners

It may seem a wee bit strange to the
uninitiated to combine these two
releases, but when you think about it,
what's the difference between review
ing five records by The Boss and
reviewing six records either by Bruce
or by the Durannies? Quantitatively not
much. And quality-wise, too, they have
a lot in common.
As you may know, Roger Taylor and
Andy Taylor left Duran Duran for soon

to-be prolific solo and guest star
careers, leaving John Taylor, Nick
Rhodes and Simon Leßon to carry on
with the mantle of the Terrific Three.
As you may not know, Bruce
Springsteen's new five-album set does
not feature the E Street Band at all,
since Bruce was dissatisfied with the
quality of the Band's concert perfor
mances. Instead, Bruce got together on
a New Jersey baseball diamond with
pals Phil Collins, Kiki Dee, Mel Tillis,
Danny "Partridge Family" Bonaduce
(who plays a mean bass in real life,
too) and the aforementioned un
employed Taylors. With Bruce's family
and neighbors as an audience, the
group duplicated the 10-year history of
Springsteen live with the E Street
Band, meeting Bruce's demanding
standards. Not surprisingly, then, the
results are extremely enjoyable, and
the bonus full-color, 172 page booklet
of photos documenting the event com
pliments the music quite well.
On "Notorious," Duran Duran con
tinue their tradition of wailing away

about anything that sounds even
remotely mystical. Simon's voice has
never been more annoyingly grating,
and John's guitar has never been less
absent. Conversely, those of you put off
by Bruce's scratchy, heartfelt vocalizing
will greatly appreciate his new release.
He does a wild, helium-induced "TV
Commercial Theme" medley that will
have you in stitches. Also a pleasant
surprise is side eight, composed en
tirely of 10 years' worth of audience
applause, yells for more and the sound
of lighters being lit. In addition,
Bruce's guitar, which he endearingly
calls "Ol' Wanda Beth" (a cut on side
two is devoted to it), is given plenty of
room to shine, particularly on the top
notch acoustic rendition of "Roller
coaster (of Love)."
Meanwhile, back with Duran
squared, the fellows seem to have
really lost their magic touch for turn
ing a clever synthesizer riff, a sultry
female moan and a couple of nifty
drum fills into a peppy disco/new
wave nugget to be treasured by
generations of teens. Instead, they wal
low miserably in their all-too-rapidly
approaching late-20s and subsequent
unoriginality. Perhaps they look back
wistfully on the days when they turned
down a chance to star in a cartoon se
ries.
Overall, "Notorious" isn't the
hoped-for reprieve from the current
Duran Duran of pathetic pop that
began with "The Reflex" and plowed
through "The Wild Boys," "A View to a
Kill" and other atrocities. Its only
redeeming feature is the possibility of
happenin' 12-inch remixes of the faster
cuts, which are disappointingly few
and far between. But don't let this ruin
your holiday season, because "Live
1975-85" succeeds beyond any expec
tations, with its only clunker being
Bruce and wife Julianne's Christmas
time reading of The Beatles'
"Revolution 9." But even that makes
for interesting music with which to
stuff stockings. "Live 1975-85" is worth
every penny of its $39-99 list price. But
shop around; I got my copy from this
guy in the parking lot of Tower
Records for only six bucks.
