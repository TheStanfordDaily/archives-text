# Singer Billy Joel is
## true entertainment 
### MARY SUNGAILA 
The Coliseum is pitch-black ex
cept for the aisle lights and the
lighters held aloft by the capacity
crowd. The audience's anticipation
mounts, and all eyes focus in the di
rection of the shrouded stage. In
the stage entrance doorway, the sil
houette of a short, somewhat stocky
zoot-suited man appears. A moment
later, a spotlight beams, now down
on him, now positioned at stage
left, his fingers thrilling the crowd
with his expert piano laying,
heartfelt lyrics and melodic voice.
The man in question is Billy Joel,
and this dramatic entrance was only
the beginning of his truly entertain
ing concert at the Oakland
Coliseum last Monday night. The
reciprocal affection between Joel
and his widely varying audience
was much in evidence, with fre
quent interaction taking place be
tween crowd and star. After his
opening number, Joel catered to
the audience's locality and per
formed an impromptu version of "I
Left My Heart in San Francisco." He
joked with his fans and mimicked a
Vegas-style lounge singer with his
cordless microphone ("I'm still not
used to these things," he said) and
performed improvisational ver
sions of several songs, facing the
crowd and playing piano with his
hands behind his back.
Joel paced his songs to match the
audience's energy, and the lighting
similarly matched the mood of each
song perfectly. Alternately pulsing
to the beat or spotlighting Joel and
the various band members, the
lighting was always appropriate.
The dramatic blackouts between
songs were occasionally foregone,
resulting in some beautiful segues,
as when "Italian Restaurant"
became "Vienna Waits for You" and
then "Allentown." The elegantly
moody "Italian Restaurant" was the
high point of the evening, with
Joel's voice matching the demands
of the tune perfectly.
Indeed, Joel's voice was in rare
form the entire evening, while his

fingers were equally nimble on the
piano keys. A girl next to this
reviewer squealed, "He sounds just
like the record!" I must add that
Joel sounded better than his
records, because his witty im
provisations made the songs even
more enjoyable. The undulating
melodies of the a capella "For the
Longest Time" spotlighted the
entire band's vocal talents, and
Mark Rivera's soulful alto sax solo
during "Italian Restaurant" was an
other highlight of the show.
Along with the pure entertain
ment of the evening, Joel offered
some social comments through his
music; he played a mind-blowing
rendition of "Goodnight Saigon,"
his look at the Vietnam War. The
chilling helicopter sound effects
before and after the song echoed
throughout the hall, seemingly
making the war a reality and creat
ing an air-raid atmosphere in the
vast Coliseum.
As an introduction to his first
single from his new "The Bridge"
album, Joel cried, "Those who
believe the good times are either
behind 'em or ahead of 'em ... I
don't believe them. I think they're
right now." Upon which he broke
into the song, assured that the audi
ence would agree with him.
Surprisingly though, Joel didn't
promote his new album heavily, in
stead thrilling the crowd with old
favorites. Judging by what new
songs were played, however, Joel
seems to be reaching out into a
decidedly more jazzy pop style.
Finally, after two-and-a-half hours
of solid entertainment, Joel reluc
tantly left the stage. While many
songs went unsung, the audience
had another fine performance by
which to remember him. In those
few hours, he bridged the gap be
tween pop, rock and jazz, between
young and old, with his artful
musicianship and insight into
human nature. Joel is a guaranteed
box-office draw who doesn't cheat
the audience of any of their concert
dollar. He is a true, top-notch enter
tainer.
