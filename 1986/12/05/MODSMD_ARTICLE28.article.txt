Adam's Kib (1949)
Castro, San Francisco
Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, a
husband and wife screenwriting team,
came up with an inspired plot idea for this
Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn movie:
The stars play husband-and-wife lawyers
who argue opposite sides of a case of at
tempted murder It's a prize comedy.
Trac\ and Hepburn had already made five
lilms together (and would make three
more), and their teamwork glistened with
wit and finesse; furthermore, they had
never before had so sharp a script to play.
(Three years later, Gordon and Kanin
wrote a still better one for them — "Pat
arid Mike ) George Cukor directed, seam
lessly, Cole Porter wrote the (mediocre)
theme song, Amanda,' and a number of
buoyantly talented people provided sup
port for the stars — David Wayne, Tom
Kwell, Judy Holliday and Jean Hagen
(Ewell and Holliday play the plaintiff and
defendant in the court case.)
Plays Monday with "Woman of the
Year."

Woman of the Year (1942)
Castro, San Francisco
The first screen meeting of Katharine
I iepburn and Spencer Tracy, and you can
see instantly why they became such a
beloved couple. The delight one takes in
their parry and thrust may explain why
movie buffs tend to remember only the
good parts of this picture and forget the
contrived working out of the story (which
casts Hepburn as a political columnist and
I racy as a sportswriter on the same paper)
and the infuriating way in which he —
with the help of a male director, George
Cukor, and two male screenwriters, Ring
I ardner Jr. and Michael Kanin — succeeds
in putting her down.
Plays Monday with "Adam's Rib."

Last Tango in Paris (1973)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bernardo Bertolucci's study of a neu
rotic sexual relationship between a
middle-aged man — a one-time
Bohemian whose wife has just committed
suicide —■ and a young French bourgeoise
may be the greatest film of the last 20
years. No one has ever explored sexuality
in movies in as intimate and unrelenting a
manner. Bertolucci and Marlon Brando,
who plays the tragic hero, are surely the
most amazing director-actor combination
since D.W. Griffith and Lillian Gish; to
describe what Brando does for this movie
would require searching for new super
latives With Maria Schneider, Jean-Pierre
Leaud, Maria Michi and Massimo Girotti;'
screenplay by Bertolucci and Franco Ar
calli; photographed by Vittorio Storaro;
music by Gato Barbieri. The paintings in
the opening credits are by Francis Bacon.
Plays tonight and tomorrow with "9 1/2
Weeks."

La Cage Aux Foiies (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto

The script is the cleverest variation yet
on the oft-tried comic theme of the parent
who pretends to be something he is not
for the good of his child. Ugo Tognazzi
plays Renato, whose son has just become
engaged to the daughter of a reactionary,
highly placed government official The
girl s parents naturally wish to meet their
intended in-law, but that poses a delicate
problem: Renato is an avowed
homosexual who lives with his long-time
lover, Albin, played by Michel Serrault
(who gives a magnificent comic perfor
mance). The direction (by Edouard
Molinaro) is sloppy, and the stage origins
are uncomfortably clear in the structure of
some of the scenes; but these flaws seem
terribly unimportant when Serrault is on
screen. When he walks, every movable
part of his body flutters through a series of
carefully prearranged poses, he gets more
comic mileage out of his clothing than al
most any other actor ever has.
Plays Monday as a benefit for the Aris
Project, a support service for victims of
AIDS in Santa Clara County.

Diva(l9B2)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot by
Phillipe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a movie.
Beinix's chief virtue, aside from his dex
terity, is his determination not to take him
self seriously: The witty, freewheeling way
in which he has put the picture together,
making his camera double back on itself
with tantalizing self-consciousness, seems
to be based on the careless assumption
that this little thriller about stolen tapes is
inconsequential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
designs declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre Leaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy An Luu, who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilhelminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Hamme adapted a
novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir Cosma
supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Black Orpheus."
— S.V.
Running Scared
Hacienda, Sunnyvale
Gregory Hines and Billy Crystal play a
pair of Chicago cops who, after 16 years
on the force, decide to retire and open a
bar in Key West; that's when their luck
changes and everyone in the city seems to
be gunning for them. This isn't a bad joke,
but the screenwriters, Gary DeVore and
Jimmy Huston, don't have any other ideas,
so they try to pad this one out to an hour
and a half. The two stars don't bring much
out in each other, and the dialogue makes
them both look bad. Darlanne Fluegel,
Steven Bauer, Joe Pantoliano. Dan Hedaya
and "L A. Law" 's Jimmy Smits (as a villain)
co-star. There's hardly a scene in this

picture you haven't seen in a dozen other
cop movies; the climax has a specific
source — DePalma's "Scarface." It's got a
nifty setting, though: the see-through State
of Illinois Building with its pink and silver
decor. Directed by Peter Hyams.

Marius (1931)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Marcel Pagnol set his three most famous
plays in Marseilles; taken together, they
tell the story of a young woman who loses
the man she loves to the sea and, pregnant
with his child, marries another man. The
plays are melodrama, certainly, but they
are sweetened with Pagnol's humor and
his Renoir-like attention to character
detail. Alexander Korda directed this film
of the first play in the series; he didn't
make much of a contribution, but the
writing and the acting are often beautiful.
Orane Demazis, who's a little like Piaf and
a little like a working class Claudette Col
bert, plays Fanny, the heroine; Pierre Fres
nay is Marius, the sailor; Raimu is Cesar,
Marius' father; Charpin is Panisse, the
older man who adores Fanny; and Alida
Raaffi is Fanny's mother, Honorine.
There's a memorable — almost magical
— scene in which Marius tells Fanny he
loves her but he's leaving her, and she
tries desperately to get him to stay.
Plays Sunday with "Fanny."

Fanny (1932)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Marc Allegret directed the second film
in the Marcel Pagnol trilogy, and it's a lot
less affecting than "Marius,"' though it has
wonderful passages of dialogue and a
magnificent performance by the great
comic actor Raimu. In this part of the
story, Fanny (Orane Demazis, who gets to
be a bit much) marries Panisse (Charpin),
and he adopts her child by Marius (Pierre
Fresnay).
Plays Sunday with "Marius."

Miss Julie (1950)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
August Strindberg wrote his famous
one-act in 1888, at the height of the
naturalist movement in literature, as an
experiment, and it was one of the plays
that hurtled the theater into the modern
age. This Swedish movie version, adapted
and directed by Alf Sjoberg, is intelligent
and beautifully made, and it comes very
close to getting Strindberg's sexual iono
sphere on the screen, though it dilutes the
strength of the astonishingly compact play
by adding a lengthy (and somewhat
melodramatic) flashback. Anita Bjork is
excellent as Julie, the heiress tumbled off
her pedestal when she sleeps with her
valet (Ulf Palme, in a commanding perfor
mance).
Plays Monday with Sjoberg's "The Road

to Heaven.'

Dreamchlld (1989)
York, San Francisco
Gavin Millar directed and Dennis
("Pennies from Heaven ) Potter wrote this
fairy tale with an adult sensibility. Alice
Hargreaves (Coral Browne) arrives in
New York in 1932 to celebrate the centen
ary of the birth of the Rev. Charles
Dodgson (lan Holm, in flashbacks), a.k.a.
Lewis Carroll. She was the real-life Alice of
Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" books,
and her arrival in the New World triggers
her ambivalent recollections of her rela
tionship with Dodgson. The movie puts us
inside the old Alice's thought processes, as
she imagines herself as a child with
Dodgson and, in the movie's most in
spired moments, with his Wonderland
creatures. Through her filtered visions of
her past, we see Dodgson's tremendous
love for her as a child, and his terribly ap
prehensive genius and wit. The movie is
beautifully crafted, subtle and intelligent;
Millar is most assured with the transitions
from fantasy to reality to imagined reality.
The filmmakers stumble a bit with a 1932
romance subplot. Browne and lan Holm
have never been better, and Amelia
Shankley is enchanting as the precocious
young Alice; the creatures are from Jim
Henson's muppet shop.
Plays tomorrow with "Out of Africa."
— Steve Warrick
Sweet Smell of Success (1956)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
As J.J., the vicious gossip columnist, and
Sidney Falco, the desperately ambitious
publicity agent, Burt Lancaster and Tony
Curtis do some of the best work of their
respective careers. (Curtis has probably
never been better — not even in "Some
Like It Hot.") The film is superb and
supremely entertaining; Alexander Mack
endrick, a tight, controlled, underrated di
rector, provides exactly the right scorched
urban milieu for the extravagant, mock
poetic dialogue by Clifford Odets and
Ernest Lehman (out of Lehamn's
novelette) — certainly Odets' most suc
cessful dialogue since his heyday with the
Group Theatre in the mid-'3os. ("What's
this kid got?" J.J. asks about the earnest
young hero, played by Martin Milner.
"Integrity. Acute. Like indigestion," Sidney
replies.) Milner and Susan Harrison are
insipid as the young lovers, but nothing
else in the movie rates that description.
With Sam Levene and, memorably, Bar
bara Nichols as Rita, the cigarette girl; shot
by James Wong Howe; jazz music scored
by Elmer Bernstein and played by the
Chico Hamilton Quintet.
Plays Tuesday with "The Bad and the
Beautiful."

Raintree County (1958)
Castro, San Francisco
An MGM Civil War epic, weighing in at
two-and-three-quarter hours, with preten
sions — it's like a cross between "Gone
With the Wind" and "Giant," and it's pretty

calamitous. Montgomery Clift plays a
Northern schoolteacher who marries a
Southern belle (.Elizabeth Taylor, who
doesn't sound very Southern but is un
deniably a belle) and then learns that she's
crazy. The story, adapted by Millard Kauf
man from Ross Rockridge's only novel, is
really Looney Tunes; it requires Taylor,
who has arson and a murderedfather and
some racial identity confusion t* her past,
to have fits of amnesia, catatonia and hys
teria and then drown herself in» swamp.
This isn't her subtlest perform*ice, but
she certainly isn't boring, and ntither is
the movie. This was Clift's first a®irjg as
signment after the accident that disfigured
him, and he's painfully ineffectual md al
most asexual. Eva Marie Saint plays the
blonde he should have married, Nigel
Patrick (who is extremely irritating)plays
a randy professor, Lee Marvin (the most
entertaining performer in the picture) is
the local bad boy, and you can alsot.ee
Rod Taylor, Agnes Moorehead, Ipm
Drake, Walter Abel, Russell Collins *id
(believe it or not) DeForrest Kelley. Id
ward Dmytryk directed.
Plays Sunday with "A Place in the Sun."

A Place in the Sun (1951)
Castro, $an Francisco
George Stevens made this second film
version of Theodore Dreiser's "An Ameri
can Tragedy"; the first, by Josef von
Sternberg in 1931, was picketed by
Dreiser because he claimed it distorted
the vision of his novel, and chances are he
wouldn't have been too happy with this
one, either. (He died in 1945.) Dreiser
wrote a novel about a shrewd social clim
ber, an American urban variant on
Stendhal's Julien Sorel, who drowns the
pregnant mistress preventing his prog
ress. It's difficult to figure out the point of
view in the Michael Wilson-Harry Brown
screenplay; puzzling or not, however, it's a
very powerful film, and if you saw it when
you were young enough you'll probably
remember the love scenes between
Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor for
the rest of your life. These two give such
touching performances that you can't buy
the film's conclusion at all; you may walk
away believing that their romance is the
only morality. Shelley Winters, whining
and looking shockingly unattractive
(considering what she looked like in ear
lier pictures) plays the doomed girl,
Raymond Burr is the D.A., Anne Revere is
Clift's mother, and the stunning black-and
white photography is by William Mellor.
Plays Sunday with "Raintree County."
