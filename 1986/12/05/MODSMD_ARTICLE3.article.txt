# County OKs library land use plan
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
The Santa Clara County Planning Commisssion
decided yesterday that the proposed site for the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library conforms to the
county's guidelines for the use of University land,
moving the library one step closer to final approval
and construction.
The commission's 4-2 decision came after consid
ering arguments both for and against the proposal.
Samuel Brain, a senior physical science research
associate in the Department of Radiology, presented
a letter to the commission outlining two main objec
tions to the proposed site of the library. Brain
represented a coalition of Stanford community resi
dents opposed to the site in the foothills west of
campus near the Dish.
The first objection states: "The hill on which (the

library) is to be built is one of the few remaining
pieces of undeveloped land in the area. It is a favorite
haunt of runners, hikers, birdwatchers and is impor
tant for the physical and spiritual well-being of resi
dents of Stanford and the surrounding community."
Brain said the coalition also objects to the library's
size and scope, arguing that the library will encour
age too much traffic and tourism and thus will not
comply with the County General Plan on University
land use.
"Uses of the Ronald Reagan Library will not be
primarily for research purposes," he said, citing fig
ures estimating the ratio of tourists to scholars visit
ing the library would be 99.5 percent to 0.5 percent.
Brain said, "The museum use of the library far out
weighs the scholastic use and is incompatible with
the Santa Clara County General Plan statements on al
lowable uses of University Land/Academic Reserve."
Presenting the case favoring the proposed location

of the library, Charles Palm, head archivist at the
Hoover Institution and campus liason for the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation, discounted the
museum aspect of the library. He noted that the pro
posed 10,500 square-feet of exhibit space would be
less than 10 percent of the total floorspace in the li
brary.
Palm said the proposed museum section of the li
brary will be "understated" and that the exhibits
would be documentary in nature with an emphasis
on the substance of administration policies.
The commission also heard criticism from the
Loma Prieta Chapter of the Sierra Club, which has
over 12,000 members in Santa Clara County. In a let
ter read before the commission, the Loma Prieta
chapter stated that the land in question was classified
as a State Fish and C/ame Refuge in the 1920s and that
the "Academic Preserve/Open Space"
classification offers only secondary
consideration to wildlife.
The chapter said the County General
Plan does not take this into account
and that the proposed library site
should be reconsidered.
Palm said last night that he "was
pleased that the commission voted the
way they did. I think they accepted our
case."
Brain, however, said, "I'm disap
pointed." But he added: "We will con
tinue to pursue opposition to the pres
ent siting of the Reagan Library.... The
community is against it and we're
going to make this clear to the Plan
ning Commission."
