## 1-2 Stanford hosts Apple 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
In the first three games of the Mike
Montgomery era at Stanford, the Card
inal's progress can best be described
as two steps forward and one step
back.
Stanford opened its season in en
couraging fashion. The Cardinal played
well in both of its games in last
weekend's Richmond Invitational,
losing to then-No. 6 (now No. 10)
Georgia Tech 67-65 and beating Rice
72-52.
But on Tuesday against San Jose
State, Stanford showed some of the im
patience and uncertainty expected of a
young team with a new coach, shoot
ing just 23 percent from the field in the
first half in a 72-63 loss to the Spartans.
"We have to try to find out what will
make us come out fired up,"
Montgomery said. "We're not satisfied
with this particular effort."
It is too early to tell what kind of
team will be playing in Maples Pavilion
this year, but if three games are any in
dication, it will be a team that does not
give up.
Against Georgia Tech, Stanford
rallied from a 16-point deficit in the
final nine minutes to pull within one
before losing. The Cardinal trailed San
Jose State by 10 at the half but came
back to take a six-point lead with seven
minutes to play before going cold
again.
"I think the group has got some
heart," Montgomery said. "That's al
ways something you're not sure
about."
One thing that Cardinal fans who

turn out for tonight's 6:35 opening
game of the Apple Invitational between
Stanford and Columbia can be sure
about is that the Cardinal will be
playing a different style of basketball
than it did under former coach Tom
Davis, now at lowa.
"The biggest differences are the
pressing and the substitutions," point
guard Terry Taylor said. "When you're
not pressing and substituting all the
time, it's a lot easier to get yourself into
the flow of the game."
The trademarks of the Davis system
— the manic full-court defensive pres
sure, the revolving-door substitutions
and the rolling bounce-pass — will be
the most obvious changes, but there
are some more subtle differences as
well between Davis and Montgomery.
"It's the amount of flexibility
allowed, approaching teams differently
with different personalities," said
guard Novian Whitsitt, the team's only
senior this year. "Coach Davis' system
is very structured, and he's not very
responsive to changes. He likes to use
the same system regardless of the op
ponent. Coach Montgomery is much
more flexible."
Montgomery not only adjusts to the
opponents' style, he gets the most out
of his own players as well. And at Stan
ford, that means keeping Todd Lichti
and Howard Wright on the floor as
much as possible. Last year, both Lichti
and Wright played less than 30 minutes
per game, but they have averaged 34
and 32 respectively so far this season.
The two sophomores have
responded by leading the team in
scoring, with Lichti averaging 16.7
points and Wright 13.0.

Junior forward Greg Butler had a good night on the boards against San Jose State Tuesday
night, even though the Cardinal dropped the game 72-63. A 7-footer, Butler pulled down 11
rebounds and led the team in that category.
