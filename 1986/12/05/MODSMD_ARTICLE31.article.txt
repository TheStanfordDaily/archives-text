# UAB best of other three teams
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
At yesterday's Apple Invitational press conference, all
three visiting coaches — Gene Bartow of Alabama-
Birmingham, Paul Smith of Hawaii Pacific and Wayne Szoke
of Columbia — said the things that visiting coaches usually
say, about how thrilled they are to be here and how much
respect they have for the other coaches and their fine pro
grams.
So when Szoke made a refreshingly candid and
humorous observation about the reason for his team's invi
tation, it was one of the highlights of the afternoon.
"In the three years I've been here, we've played in seven
tournaments, and we always play the home team in the first
round," Szoke said. "Everyone stands up and says how
happy they are to have us here. I'm not sure how to take
that.
"I think there are two reasons for this," Szoke continued
with a smile. "One, Columbia has a decent academic reputa
tion, and the home school will want to identify with that. But
the main reason is that they feel it's the easiest team in the
draw. If they get upset in the first round, it'll screw up the
whole tournament, and they'll lose a whole lot of money."
Stanford (1-2) meets the 1-1 Lions in the tournament
opener at 6:35 p.m. UAB takes on Hawaii Pacific at 8:35. The
losers will play tomorrow night at 6:35, with the winners
meeting for the tournament title at 8:35.
In the five years that Stanford has hosted a tournament, it
has never failed to reach the final game, and Columbia does
not figure to end that streak. The Lions go 6-foot-6, 6-5 and
6-2 across the front line. Their starting five is averaging only
eight rebounds per game. Stanford center Howard Wright is
averaging 9.3.
The one player who figures to give the Cardinal trouble is
forward Sean Couch. The 6-2 senior has scored 28 points in
each of the Lions' two games. One might think a 6-2 forward
may subsist solely on a leather diet, but Couch doesn't mind
playing amid the tall timber.
