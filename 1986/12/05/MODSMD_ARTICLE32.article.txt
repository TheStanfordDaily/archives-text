# Klass: Pac-10 Player of Year
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
ft was a fitting end to a Stanford
senior's career and just another honor
for one of Stanford's most distin
guished coaches.
The Pacific-10 coaches announced
yesterday the unanimous selections of
senior Craig Klass as Pacific 10 Confer
ence Player of the Year and Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti as the Pac-10
Coach of the Year.
The honors did not come as a
surprise, as the Cardinal recently com
pleted a perfect 33-0 regular season
and Sunday captured the NCAA cham
pionships for the second year in a row.
It was the second year in a row that
Klass has won the Pac-10 Player of the
Year award. Last season, he scored 59
goals on his way to the honor. This

year, Klass scored a whopping 87
goals, tying him with junior teammate
Erich Fischer for a new Cardinal
single-season scoring record.
"I voted for him," Dettamanti said.'"l
think he deserved it. He has really led
the team this year. He plays the tough
est position on the team. If we had to
pick a team MVP, he would probably
be it."
"We couldn't have won it (the NCAA
title) without him," senior David Im
bernino said. "He was very consistent
throughout the season. He was always
mentally prepared for each game."
Klass was a little less sure.
"I'm a little surprised," Klass said. "I
thought there were other players on
our team who had a chance, with Erich
and Imbo. But it's great to get recogni
tion — that's a benefit of playing on a
team that's so successful."
Klass, a three-time All-America who
hails from Walnut Creek, has a good
shot at making the 1988 U.S. Olympic
Team. He is widely regarded as the
best hole man in collegiate water polo.
"He and Jody Campbell (1978-1981)
are the top two hole men we
(Stanford) have ever had," Dettamanti
said. "The top three hole men to ever
play collegiate water polo have been
(Pepperdine's) Terry Schroeder,
Campbell and Craig. He is right up
there with those guys."
Winning the Pac-10 Coach of the
Year honor has been the rule rather
than the exception since Dettamanti
began coaching at Stanford in 1977. He
has now won the award seven times
and is regarded as one of the top
coaches in the nation.
"He is Stanford water polo," Imber
nino said. "He developed us into the
players that we are. He's just a great
coach. Dante is able to take raw talent
and develop people into great water
polo players."
Dettamanti, who first coached at Oc
cidental and UC-Santa Barbara, has
won five NCAA titles (1978,1980, 1981,
1985, 1986) since he started coaching
at Stanford, and since 1977 he has
piled up a remarkable 252-38-6 record.
"It's (the award) a reflection on our
success at Stanford," Dettamanti said.
"It just means we have dominated the
Pac-10 Conference, and it's the tough
est conference in the country."
