# 70 teams at Stanford for rugby tournament
## 
### 
In the biggest national rugby tournament of the
fall, Stanford will play host to over 70 teams in the
"Stanford 10-A-Sides" tournament, featuring some of
the top club and college teams in California. There
will be four divisions of play, and the Stanford men's
rugby team will field four squads, while the women's
team will also compete.
In the A division, the national champion Old Blues
will compete, along with other strong teams such as
the Monterey Rugby Club, the Bay Area Touring Side
(BATS), Palo Alto X's and O's (PAXO), the San Jose
Seahawks and the San Francisco Rugby Club.
The B division will be comprised of college first
string teams and club second teams. Stanford's first
side will play in this division, as will California, San

Jose State and Santa Clara.
The C and D divisions will be made up primarily of
second and third teams from colleges and clubs, as
well as some weaker club teams. Stanford will have
one team in the C division and two in the D level.
There will be one division in the women's tourna
ment, with eight to 10 teams, including the Stanford
women's rugby team.
The host team expects to do well in the B division.
"We've been playing pretty well," club President
Marty Hartigan said. "This is the first time we've had a
chance to play other colleges, and we're looking for
ward to it.
"We had a good week of practice; I have high
hopes for the club," Hartigan added. "I'm pretty

confident. We should do pretty well."
With over 800 rugby players expected, the Stan
ford tournament is the largest event of the fall in the
country. "I don't know of any other 10-a-side tourna
ment in the area," sophomore Hartigan said.
Ten-a-sides is much different from traditional
rugby, which is played with 15 players. In this
weekend's action, the squads will be made up of five
forwards and five back?.
"It's a different sort of game," Hartigan said. "It's
much more open and more exciting."
"Ten-a-sides is a lot of fun," flanker Will Wall said.
"You get to do a lot more running, and it's more ex
citing to watch. You can break open and it's a lot
easier to score."
