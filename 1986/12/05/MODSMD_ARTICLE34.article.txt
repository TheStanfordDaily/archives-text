# W. Virginia beats Card
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Common experience teaches us
that success is not an effortless
stroll to the top, but more often like
a series of two paces up followed by
a one-step drop.
After posting impressive wins in
its first two appearances this season,
the Stanford women's basketball
team dropped a notch last night by
losing to the tenacious Lady Moun
taineers of West Virginia, 73-65.
According to Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer, the Cardinal may have,
in fact, plunged all the way to the
basement.
"The intensity that we showed
against UNLV was not there," she
said. "The team out there did not
have any hustle or scrap. We were
stagnant on offense, and on defense
we were just standing around."
West Virginia, on the other hand,
was anything but lethargic.
The shorter, and perhaps less
talented Lady Mountaineers out
hustled the Cardinal in every phase
of the game.
"It seemed as though we never
came up with the loose balls," Van-

Derveer said. "Even when we
tipped the ball, it would end up in
their hands. They were just working
harder."
Defensively, Stanford could not
control West Virginia's talented
outside shooting game led by
senior guard Alexis Basil, who fired
in a game-high 26 points.
"Basil would just bomb away
from the perimeter and can it," Van-
Derveer said. "We couldn't even
think of playing zone (defense).
When we did, we lost control in a
hurry."
Not all was gloomy for the Card
inal, however, as senior guard Erica
Mueser gave her usual inspired
performance and was rewarded
with five steals and 16 points to lead
Stanford.
The Cardinal will attempt to
return to winning ways tonight as it
concludes its two-game road trip
against the Pittsburgh Panthers in
Altoona, Penn.
"Pittsburgh has more variety on
offense, but they don't have the
pure outside shooters like West Vir
ginia. They're a real competitive
team, so we're going to have to
come back with more intensity."

Sophomore forward Evon Asforis, who scored 17 points in Stanford's
first game of the year against Cleveland State, did not make the trip to
West Virginia with the rest of the women's basketball team and missed
Stanford's 73-65 loss last night. Asforis sprained a knee last Saturday
against UNLV.
