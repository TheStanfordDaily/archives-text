# Stanford fencing hosts S.F. State
## 
### 
It has been a long time since the
Stanford fencing team has met San
Francisco State — five years, in fact.
The reunion takes place tomorrow
at 1 p.m. in Roble Gym.
"We don't know much about
them," Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst
said. "We should be stronger than
they are. They're a club team, but
they have a professional fencing
master. We should have an edge in
technique on them — I'm expec
tiong that we should beat them, but
they could have some suprises in
store for us."
That's on the men's side,
however. The Stanford women's

team has competed against S.F.
State every season and nearly lost to
a strong Gator contingent last year.
The Cardinal women's squad is 2-
0 this year and playing well, espe
cially senior captain Holly Taylor,
who is 7-1 in her matches.
The men's team, 1-1 this season,
may be hurting somewhat, as senior
co-captain Steve Levitan has a se
vere case of tendinitis in his knee
and may be sidelined for the match.
Levitan, the No. 1 player on the
sabre team, has a perfect 6-0 record
this year. "It's very likely that he's
not going to be able to fence this
weekend," Hurst said.
