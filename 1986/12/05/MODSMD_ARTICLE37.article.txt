# Cardinal goes to NCAAs
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
The world of collegiate women's
volleyball is finally getting down to
serious business, and Stanford is finally
getting a chance to prove it can win
when it has to.
Unlike many schools that had to win
their final regular season games to
keep their season alive, the Cardinal
has been assured of a playoff spot for
the latter half of its 29-game schedule,
after jumping out in front of most of its
Pacific 10 Conference rivals early. Now,
ranked No. 11 in the nation with a 20-9
record, the team cannot afford any of
the concentration or communication
lapses that were the villians in many of
its losses.
Stanford, seeded No. 3 in the West
Region, will play at No. 6-seed Oregon
tomorrow night. When the Ducks last
hosted the Cardinal, they handed the
spikers one of their two conference
losses in a match in which Stanford
won the first two games. A little over a
month later, Stanford played the role
of impolite host, winning easily in four
games. The Ducks, No. 15 in the na
tion, are 22-11.
Senior Barbra Fontana said the team
has not forgotten that loss, a failure that
cost it the Pac-10 championship. The
co-captain said she feels that if each
team plays to the best of its ability,
Stanford should win. "We're more
talented than they are," she said.
While both of its conference losses
came in road matches, Stanford has
shown, especially in its first two games
at Oregon and against tough crowds at
Arizona and Arizona State, that home
court advantages can be overcome. Ac
cording to Fontana, though, playing on
McArthur Court will definitely help the
Ducks. "Anytime a team plays at home,
they play a lot better," she said.
After a couple months of games

where the outcome, in essence, could
not affect the team's season, the ques
tion arises whether Stanford can raise
its game to the level required in a
must-win situation. Over the past few
weeks, both team member Teresa
Smith and Stanford Coach Don Shaw
have said they do not think this would

be a problem. Co-captain Brooke Hah
ner, however, has said she is worried
about the squad's ability to avoid men
tal lapses in the big games. Fontana
agreed with Smith and Shaw. "I think
we'll be ready," she said. 'We've had
really good practices all week."
This is the single-elimination NCAA

tournament, however, and, even
though the Cardinal has made the final
four each of the last four years, noth
ing is going to come easy.
"All of the teams are qualified to win
the games they're playing," Fontana
said. "It's not going to be a cakewalk by
any means."
