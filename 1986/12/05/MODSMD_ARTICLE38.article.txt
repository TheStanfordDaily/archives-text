### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
Coming off a solid week of work
outs, the Stanford men's swimming
team will hope to test its endurance
against an overmatched University of
Pacific tomorrow noon at DeGuerre
pool.
The Cardinal will enter the meet
after a morning workout regimen and
will hope to assess "how fast we swim
tired," sophomore Dave Schraven said.
"Right now we're more concerned
with workouts. Now's the time when
we're getting into shape — a lot of
guys are broken down," said Schraven,
who hails from Buffalo, New York.
"Personally, I like to see how fast I
can swim tired.
"Working out all year, sometimes
you forget how to compete, and this
gives us a chance to step up on the
blocks as well," he added.
Most of the Cardinal swimmers will

swim in off events, a strategy that
allows the team a new perspective on
their regular races, according to Stan
ford Asst. Coach Ted Knapp.
We want to use it (the meet) as a
tool to investigate some of our second
ary strengths," Knapp said. "It's a
variety-spice-of-life-type thing. We're
approaching this as an extension of
workout."
limes are not important — we're
not doing anything special to create
times," senior breaststroker Sam
McAdam said.
Olympian Pablo Morales, whom
Sports Illustrated called the "soul of
American swimming" will swim the
200 individual medley. Knapp added
that long course and 400 individual
medley specialist Jeff Kostoff will enter
a shorter freestyle event and a possible
relay.
The Stanford women's swlmmming
team will also compete in dual meet
action against UOP.
