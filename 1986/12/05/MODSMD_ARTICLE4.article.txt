# Animal protesters sentenced

### KRISTIN BARENDSEN Staff writer 
Seven animal rights activists, who pleaded not guilty to
charges of trespassing during an April 24 demonstration at
Stanford, were sentenced yesterday to one year's court
probation and their choice of a $200 fine, 24 hours in jail or
three days of community service.
During the trial, the court heard testimony from the seven
protesters, who were among 19 arrested for illegally oc
cupying the fifth floor of Jordan Hall for three hours in a
protest against animal research.
According to Deputy District Attorney Karyn Sinunu, four
Stanford staff members testified that the demonstration
forced them to cease all experimentation for the day,
causing losses of time valued at over $2,000. Three Stanford
police officers who assisted in the arrests were also called as
witnesses, Sinunu said.
In addition, two photographs published by The Daily at
the time of the protest were subpoenaed by the court and
submitted as evidence, Sinunu said.
The jury found the activists not guilty of intent to disrupt
business, but guilty of trespassing.
During their year of probation, the activists must not be
convicted of a crime or be arrested in any protest. However,
their option of three days community service can be com
pleted in work for the animal rights cause, according to
Sinunu.
Two of the seven convicted chose to serve 24 hours in jail.
Sharon Proietti, a Palo Alto resident, said she chose jail
because civil disobedience is carrying the pain and suffer
ing of others on your shoulders. Jail is a small inconveni
ence compared to what the animals must bear.
Proietti said that she was satisfied with the outcome of the
trial. The Judge (Patricia Bamattre-Manoukian) was won
derful, and she commended us on our behavior. Several
jurors hugged us. One even asked to be on our mailing list.
I went to Stanford to report a crime and got arrested in

stead," clinical psychologist Jean Baird, one of the seven ar
rested, said during a court recess. Baird, who also chose to
serve jail time, was also arrested at Stanford Nov. 10 and said
she will plead not guilty to the charges again.
A court date for those arrested in the Nov. 10 demonstra
tion has not yet been decided, according to Sinunu.
Sinunu characterized the trial as "emotional" and said the
defendants "have a worthy cause" but "victimized the
wrong place." According to Sinunu, the defendants were
largely uninformed about specific Stanford practices. None
of them had conducted independent research of Stanford
policies or tried to obtain reports, and only one had toured
the animal research facility, she added.
"I can't find any dirt on Stanford," Sinunu concluded.
"Stanford is innocent of abuse and torture of animals."
After the court recessed Tuesday, Elliot Katz, founder of
In Defense of Animals (IDA), outlined the group's "six
points," or goals for changing animal research policies. Katz
said the IDA demands cessation of all psychological experi
ments on animals, on the grounds that such experiments
are "frivolous" and "not applicable to humans."
He said IDA also calls for increased funding for the devel
opment of non-animal technologies to be used as alternate
research tools and for unscheduled access to the labs by
"qualified personnel."
In response to IDA's demands, Dr. Thomas Hamm, direc
tor of the Division of Laboratory Medicine at Stanford, said
Stanford's policies will remain unchanged by the protesters'
actions.
"The vast majority of the public are in favor of biomedical
research. All that's changing is the escalation of illegal activi
ties (by animal rights activists). The people that genuinely
care are being hurt by the extremists."
Hamm said non-animal alternatives are used whenever
possible by all researchers. "Every scientist tries to use non
animal models. It is the simplest, cheapest, easiest way.
Using an animal system is the extreme case because of the
great expense."
