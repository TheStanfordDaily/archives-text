# Card drug tests set for Tuesday

### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
One of the great things about having
an 8-3 football season is the chance to
compete in the Gator Bowl Dec. 27.
For Stanford, it v/ill be the first
postseason appearance in eight years
and the first ever in the Jacksonville,
Fla., bowl.
Also included in that expenses-paid
trip to sunny northeast Florida is the
NCAA-mandated requirement that
players submit to drug testing. Twenty
two starters and 14 randomly selected
reserves will be tested by the NCAA
appointed testers next Tuesday. The
test was originally scheduled for Tues
day of this week, but the team had just
returned from Tokyo after its 29-24 vic
tory over Arizona. The test was
postponed.
Testing will be for substances
banned at the Olympic Games, includ
ing performance-improving drugs like
anabolic steroids and amphetamines,

marijuana and commonly used legal
drugs like caffeine.
Fullback Brian Morris is not happy
with the testing proviso. Morris, a
former ASSU senator, has been looking

events, but said yesterday the outlook
is not good. "I think time Is a little

the law," he said.
The rule was passed at the NCAA
convention in January and imple
mented this season. The NCAA is not
testing all sports, but it can test a team
anytime and as often as it chooses after
the team qualifies for postseason play,
according to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger. Twenty of the 36 football teams
playing in bowl games are scheduled
to be tested, Geiger said.
Stanford opposed the decision at the
convention, but Geiger said the Uni
versity intends to abide by the NCAA
decision. "It's the law of the land, and
we lost the vote," he said. "Counsel
thinks there might be some loopholes,
but it's very iffy, very risky. The NCAA's
probably in pretty good position on
this.
