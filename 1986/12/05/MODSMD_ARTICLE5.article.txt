# Card drug tests set for Tuesday
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
One of the great things about having
an 8-3 football season is the chance to
compete in the Gator Bowl Dec. 27.
For Stanford, it v/ill be the first
postseason appearance in eight years
and the first ever in the Jacksonville,
Fla., bowl.
Also included in that expenses-paid
trip to sunny northeast Florida is the
NCAA-mandated requirement that
players submit to drug testing. Twenty
two starters and 14 randomly selected
reserves will be tested by the NCAA
appointed testers next Tuesday. The
test was originally scheduled for Tues
day of this week, but the team had just
returned from Tokyo after its 29-24 vic
tory over Arizona. The test was
postponed.
Testing will be for substances
banned at the Olympic Games, includ
ing performance-improving drugs like
anabolic steroids and amphetamines,
as well as street drugs like cocaine and
marijuana and commonly used legal
drugs like caffeine.
Fullback Brian Morris is not happy
with the testing proviso. Morris, a
former ASSU senator, has been looking
into legal channels through which to

overturn the NCAA decision to test ath
letes participating in postseason
events, but said yesterday the outlook
is not good. "I think time Is a little
short for it,"he said.
"1 haven't been getting positive feed
back from lawyers. The time isn't right
with the atmosphere in the country re
garding drugs. And the way the law is
written, it's within the framework of
the law," he said.
The rule was passed at the NCAA
convention in January and imple
mented this season. The NCAA is not
testing all sports, but it can test a team
anytime and as often as it chooses after
the team qualifies for postseason play,
according to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger. Twenty of the 36 football teams
playing in bowl games are scheduled
to be tested, Geiger said.
Stanford opposed the decision at the
convention, but Geiger said the Uni
versity intends to abide by the NCAA
decision. "It's the law of the land, and
we lost the vote," he said. "Counsel
thinks there might be some loopholes,
but it's very iffy, very risky. The NCAA's
probably in pretty good position on
this.
"I don't condone use of the sub
stances being banned, but I think we
need to operate on the basis of shared
responsibility. We need to intrinsically
know the difference between right and
wrong. I think colleges should be con
cerned with education on and correct
ing the problem, not on playing cops
and robbers," Geiger said.
Morris and tailback Kevin Scott
originally didn't sign the NCAA waiver
agreeing to submit to testing when
practice began in August, but did so
just before the Cardinal's first game
Sept. 14 at Texas. The two would have
been ineligible to play this season had
they not signed, despite the NCAA posi
tion that the testing is voluntary.
Morris, a senior majoring in eco
nomics who is planning to attend law
school next year, said that while legal
action before Tuesday is almost cer
tainly out of the question, he hopes to
talk to team members and issue a state
ment by then.
"A lot of players oppose it as well,
but I think it's futile to try to fight it
now," Morris said. "I don't think it
dawned on people 'til now. We were
too concerned with the season, too

concerned with getting into a bowl
game."
Morris lauded the University's hand
ling of the matter. "Stanford's been
very good," he said. "I'm happy with
how they've acted in this matter. They
don't have testing, and they've sup
ported the players."
