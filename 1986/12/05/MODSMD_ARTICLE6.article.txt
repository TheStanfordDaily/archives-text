# Wessells defends Vienna decision

### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norman Wessells yesterday defended
the decision to close the Vienna
campus — one of several Over
seas Studies issues addressed at
the Faculty Senate's last meeting of the
quarter.
Wessells, who also announced the
opening of a new campus in Mexico
and the future relocation of overseas
centers in Italy and Israel, said faculty
criticism of the academic quality of the
Vienna program dated back to the mid
-19605.
He cited declining student enroll
ments, from 107 students in 1981-82 to
54 last year, as evidence of a weak pro
gram. "Students have been speaking
with their feet with respect to Vienna,"
he said.
Fifteen students are currently study
ing in Vienna, with an eight-course
curriculum, he added.

Carolyn Lougee admitted, however,
students were not consulted enough
before the Vienna overseas campus
was closed. "Participation in the formal
processes of consultation was not ade
quate in the minds of many students.
We have to learn that lesson and be
careful to have broader consultation,"
she said.
The Overseas Studies Central Europe
panel, which recommended closing
the Vienna center, consulted with
various faculty members before
recommending the move, Wessells
said.
The major issue that led to the
panel's decision was Vienna's "highly
problematical curriculum offerings,"
he said.
According to Wessells, the panel
found there was "little hint" that there
could be significant improvement in
the academic program there.
Budget constraints and calls to
branch out to Asia and Latin America
made it impossible to support the
existing program in Europe, he added.
Efforts to reform the Vienna pro
gram in the past have failed, Wessells
said. "Vienna has had many chances,"
he said.
Wessells said the Overseas Studies
Office will explore future opportuni
ties in Austria. "We do value our links
with Austria," he said.
In addition to Vienna, Wessells said
the Florence, Italy, campus might be in
danger of closing. The lease on the
current Florence villa residence
expires in 1988, and an overseas
studies panel for Florence will be
looking for another facility in that city
or posssibly Rome, Wessells said.
"If we can find the right situation in
Florence, the Italian program will
remain there," he said.
Because funding will expire this
year, the small overseas center in
Haifa, Israel, will be relocated in Haifa
or elsewhere in Israel next year or the
following year, he said.
In a related topic, English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz said he was "worried
about the pre-professional, technical
direction of Overseas Studies," with stu
dents in Berlin — and soon in Japan —
working in internships with multi
national corporations. He charged
overseas programs are "becoming
mini-business schools."
Lougee responded that there are stu

dents currently involved in humanities
internships in the Berlin program, and
that opportunities in non-technical in
ternships will be expanded there.
Wessells also cited one of two pro
grams to be set up in Japan, the Kyoto
Program in Japanese Studies, which he
said will allow students to study
Japanese language and culture in
Kyoto.
In other overseas developments,
Wessells announced the creation of a
new center in Chapas, Mexico, which
will focus on the study of public health.
The new programs in Japan and
Latin America represent "a broadening
of our view of what overseas should
be" and reflect the increase in minority
student enrollment since the 19605,
Wessells said.
The senate also, for the first time, ap
proved guidelines for ethnic and
theme houses at Stanford in the annual
report of the Subcommittee on Resi
dential Education and Advising. The
subcommittee also affirmed the policy
of allowing freshmen to live in ethnic
theme houses.
Proposals for new theme houses, the
report said, must prove that the theme
appeals to a wide range of faculty
members and students and that it at
tracts a number of students equal to
the spaces in the house plus 25 per
cent, to ensure against vacancies.
The next Faculty Senate meeting on
Jan. 15 will discuss the new Western
Culture core course proposed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
earlier this week.
