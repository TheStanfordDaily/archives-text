Norman Wessells yesterday defended
the decision to close the Vienna
campus â€” one of several Over
seas Studies issues addressed at
the Faculty Senate's last meeting of the
quarter.
Wessells, who also announced the
opening of a new campus in Mexico
and the future relocation of overseas
centers in Italy and Israel, said faculty
criticism of the academic quality of the
Vienna program dated back to the mid
-19605.
He cited declining student enroll
ments, from 107 students in 1981-82 to
54 last year, as evidence of a weak pro
gram. "Students have been speaking
with their feet with respect to Vienna,"
he said.
Fifteen students are currently study
ing in Vienna, with an eight-course
curriculum, he added.

Carolyn Lougee admitted, however,
students were not consulted enough
before the Vienna overseas campus
was closed. "Participation in the formal
processes of consultation was not ade
quate in the minds of many students.
We have to learn that lesson and be
careful to have broader consultation,"
she said.
The Overseas Studies Central Europe
panel, which recommended closing
the Vienna center, consulted with
various faculty members before
recommending the move, Wessells
said.
The major issue that led to the
panel's decision was Vienna's "highly
problematical curriculum offerings,"
he said.
According to Wessells, the panel
found there was "little hint" that there
could be significant improvement in
the academic program there.
