Student march ends violently
PARIS — A protest march by more than 200,000 students against an edu
cation bill of Premier Jacques Chirac ended yesterday night in a violent
confrontation, with riot police firing tear gas and swinging batons at rock
throwing and taunting demonstrators.
The violence, which was seen live on national television by millions of
French viewers, erupted after student leaders reported that they had failed
in a meeting to persuade Chirac's two education ministers to withdraw the
bill on university reform that has angered students throughout the country
and provoked the long day of protest.
Chirac's office announced that the prime minister would meet with the
education ministers and other top advisers today to discuss the legislation.
It was not clear how many people were hurt in the clashes with police.
But ambulances and police vans could be seen and heard rushing to and
from the scene. Sounds of tear-gas grenades being fired reverberated
through the fashionable neighborhood on the left bank of the Seine River.
So did the hoarse chanting of students.
On television, viewers saw the kind of clashes that had not been seen in
France since the student uprisings of 1968. Swinging their batons, hel
meted riot police with shields charged into the students while students
bent low to pick up rocks and toss them at the chargers before scurrying
away.
Speakes quits White House post
WASHINGTON — White House spokesman Larry Speakes announced
yesterday that he will resign from his post to become senior vice president
for communications of Merrill Lynch & Co., the giant Wall Street invest
ment house.
Speakes, who was thrust into the White House post March 30, 1981,
when White House press secretary James Brady was seriously wounded in
the assassination attempt on President Reagan, has served as chief spokes
man longer than any other person since World War 11, with the exception
of James Haggerty, who was the presidential spokesman during the two
terms of the Eisenhower administration.
Although Brady has retained the title of press secretary, Speakes became
chief spokesman and was given the title of principal deputy press secretary.
The 47-year-old Mississippian, whose annual White House pay was
$75,100, is expected to make a six-figure salary in the executive position
with Merrill Lynch.
Speakes said that he would begin working for Merrill Lynch Feb. 1,
leaving the period until then to work with a successor, who has not been
named.
Shortly after Speakes announced his resignation, the unrelated
departures of two other White House figures — drug abuse adviser Carlton
Turner and White House physician T. Burton Smith — were also an
nounced.
Meese delayed bringing in FBI
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin Meese waited five days after
the first offer of help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and four
days after the discovery of a key document indicating the possibility of
wrongdoing before bringing the bureau into the investigation of funds
from Iranian arms sales that were diverted to assist the Nicaraguan contras.
FBI Director William Webster said yesterday that Meese turned down his
routine offer of FBI help on Nov. 21, hours after President Reagan in
~ strutted Meese to.find out all the facts behind the clandestine sale of U.S.
arms to the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The next day, Meese and his aides found a crucial National Security
Council document that quickly led them to discover that funds from the se
cret Iranian arm sales had been diverted to the contras. Webster said he did
not learn of Meese's discovery of that document on Nov. 22 until the attor
ney general announced it at his Nov. 25 news conference at the White
House.
Asked about how details of the FBI investigation are being handled now,
Webster said he was getting a daily briefing and that information is also
passed on to Meese's deputies who are supervising the legal aspects of the
probe.
33 arrested in Egyptian plot
CAIRO, Egypt — Egyptian authorities disclosed yesterday that four army
officers and more than two dozen civilians have been arrested for plotting
to overthrow the government of President Hosni Mubarak in a move to
create a fundamentalist Islamic state here.
It was the first time that army officers have been publicly implicated by
officials in a plot to overthrow the government since the late Anwar Sadat
was assassinated by military members of the outlawed Islamicjihad, a Mos
lem extremist organization that advocates establishing an Iranian-style gov
ernment in Egypt.
A statement by the public prosecutor's office said the 33 people accused
in yesterday's indictment had links to Islamic Jihad, which has survived
concentrated government attempts to wipe it out and recently appears to
have become more active in this country.
One senior official indicated that investigators had uncovered evidence
of a plot to assassinate Mubarak and other high-ranking officials, as well as
plans to take over radio and television stations to announce the creation of
an Islamic state.
Attack blamed on government
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Black nationalist leader Winnie Man
dela accused the South African government yesterday of instigating the at
tack by blacks who pelted her with garbage outside a Cape Town court
house this week.
Mandela said that the government was seeking to discredit her and the
anti-apartheid movement and that it would probably escalate such inci
dents to create the impression of political divisions within the black com
munity.
South Africa's white-led minority government wants people here and
abroad to believe that most of the political violence here is due to black po
litical rivals fighting each other, Mandela told reporters at her home in
Soweto, the black satellite city outside Johannesburg.
About 200 angry blacks had thrown garbage, sand and soft drink cans at
Mandela Wednesday outside the supreme court building in Cape Town,
where she had gone to attend a pre-sentencing hearing for Lindi Man
galiso, a friend who was convicted last month of hiring two men to kill her
own husband in 1984.
Weinberger seeks to calm allies
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger yester
day sought to calm allied fears that the Iranian arms scandal could cripple
the Reagan presidency, and to clear up confusion over U.S. arms-control
goals following the Reykjavik summit.
At a NATO meeting here, Weinberger emphasized to his fellow defense
ministers that President Reagan had good reasons for originally seeking to
improve relations with Iran, that he has taken appropriate steps to end the
crisis, and that he is "still in charge," U.S. and European officials said.
As the first Reagan Cabinet officer to travel abroad since the Iranian con
troversy erupted last month, Weinberger assumed responsibility for assur
ing the allies that the scandal would not prevent Reagan from continuing to
exert strong leadership within the alliance.
Weinberger also assured the allies that the United States had the same
priorities as they do in arms-control negotiations with the Soviet Union.
Specifically, he agreed that a communique to be issued today would em
phasize the goal of achieving partial cuts in nuclear weapons as a first step
toward more radical reductions later, U.S. and British officials said.

own husband in 1984.
Weinberger seeks to calm allies
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger yester
day sought to calm allied fears that the Iranian arms scandal could cripple
the Reagan presidency, and to clear up confusion over U.S. arms-control
goals following the Reykjavik summit.
At a NATO meeting here, Weinberger emphasized to his fellow defense
ministers that President Reagan had good reasons for originally seeking to
improve relations with Iran, that he has taken appropriate steps to end the
crisis, and that he is "still in charge," U.S. and European officials said.
As the first Reagan Cabinet officer to travel abroad since the Iranian con
troversy erupted last month, Weinberger assumed responsibility for assur
ing the allies that the scandal would not prevent Reagan from continuing to
exert strong leadership within the alliance.
Weinberger also assured the allies that the United States had the same
priorities as they do in arms-control negotiations with the Soviet Union.
Specifically, he agreed that a communique to be issued today would em
phasize the goal of achieving partial cuts in nuclear weapons as a first step
toward more radical reductions later, U.S. and British officials said.

Student march ends violently
PARIS — A protest march by more than 200,000 students against an edu
cation bill of Premier Jacques Chirac ended yesterday night in a violent
confrontation, with riot police firing tear gas and swinging batons at rock
throwing and taunting demonstrators.
The violence, which was seen live on national television by millions of
French viewers, erupted after student leaders reported that they had failed
in a meeting to persuade Chirac's two education ministers to withdraw the
bill on university reform that has angered students throughout the country
and provoked the long day of protest.
Chirac's office announced that the prime minister would meet with the
education ministers and other top advisers today to discuss the legislation.
It was not clear how many people were hurt in the clashes with police.
But ambulances and police vans could be seen and heard rushing to and
from the scene. Sounds of tear-gas grenades being fired reverberated
through the fashionable neighborhood on the left bank of the Seine River.
So did the hoarse chanting of students.
On television, viewers saw the kind of clashes that had not been seen in
France since the student uprisings of 1968. Swinging their batons, hel
meted riot police with shields charged into the students while students
bent low to pick up rocks and toss them at the chargers before scurrying
away.
Speakes quits White House post
WASHINGTON — White House spokesman Larry Speakes announced
yesterday that he will resign from his post to become senior vice president
for communications of Merrill Lynch & Co., the giant Wall Street invest
ment house.
Speakes, who was thrust into the White House post March 30, 1981,
when White House press secretary James Brady was seriously wounded in
the assassination attempt on President Reagan, has served as chief spokes
man longer than any other person since World War 11, with the exception
of James Haggerty, who was the presidential spokesman during the two
terms of the Eisenhower administration.
Although Brady has retained the title of press secretary, Speakes became
chief spokesman and was given the title of principal deputy press secretary.
The 47-year-old Mississippian, whose annual White House pay was
$75,100, is expected to make a six-figure salary in the executive position
with Merrill Lynch.
Speakes said that he would begin working for Merrill Lynch Feb. 1,
leaving the period until then to work with a successor, who has not been
named.
Shortly after Speakes announced his resignation, the unrelated
departures of two other White House figures — drug abuse adviser Carlton
Turner and White House physician T. Burton Smith — were also an
nounced.
Meese delayed bringing in FBI
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin Meese waited five days after
the first offer of help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and four
days after the discovery of a key document indicating the possibility of
wrongdoing before bringing the bureau into the investigation of funds
from Iranian arms sales that were diverted to assist the Nicaraguan contras.
FBI Director William Webster said yesterday that Meese turned down his
routine offer of FBI help on Nov. 21, hours after President Reagan in
~ strutted Meese to.find out all the facts behind the clandestine sale of U.S.
arms to the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The next day, Meese and his aides found a crucial National Security
Council document that quickly led them to discover that funds from the se
cret Iranian arm sales had been diverted to the contras. Webster said he did
not learn of Meese's discovery of that document on Nov. 22 until the attor
ney general announced it at his Nov. 25 news conference at the White
House.
Asked about how details of the FBI investigation are being handled now,
Webster said he was getting a daily briefing and that information is also
passed on to Meese's deputies who are supervising the legal aspects of the
probe.
33 arrested in Egyptian plot
CAIRO, Egypt — Egyptian authorities disclosed yesterday that four army
officers and more than two dozen civilians have been arrested for plotting
to overthrow the government of President Hosni Mubarak in a move to
create a fundamentalist Islamic state here.
It was the first time that army officers have been publicly implicated by
officials in a plot to overthrow the government since the late Anwar Sadat
was assassinated by military members of the outlawed Islamicjihad, a Mos
lem extremist organization that advocates establishing an Iranian-style gov
ernment in Egypt.
A statement by the public prosecutor's office said the 33 people accused
in yesterday's indictment had links to Islamic Jihad, which has survived
concentrated government attempts to wipe it out and recently appears to
have become more active in this country.
One senior official indicated that investigators had uncovered evidence
of a plot to assassinate Mubarak and other high-ranking officials, as well as
plans to take over radio and television stations to announce the creation of
an Islamic state.
Attack blamed on government
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Black nationalist leader Winnie Man
dela accused the South African government yesterday of instigating the at
tack by blacks who pelted her with garbage outside a Cape Town court
house this week.
Mandela said that the government was seeking to discredit her and the
anti-apartheid movement and that it would probably escalate such inci
dents to create the impression of political divisions within the black com
munity.
South Africa's white-led minority government wants people here and
abroad to believe that most of the political violence here is due to black po
litical rivals fighting each other, Mandela told reporters at her home in
Soweto, the black satellite city outside Johannesburg.
About 200 angry blacks had thrown garbage, sand and soft drink cans at

where she had gone to attend a pre-sentencing hearing for Lindi Man
