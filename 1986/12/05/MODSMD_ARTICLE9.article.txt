# Congress to investigate Iran
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — House and Senate leaders
agreed yesterday to form separate Watergate-style
select committees to investigate the secret sale of
arms to Iran and subsequent diversion of profits to
the Nicaraguan contras.
The two investigating committees are expected to
be created as a first order of business when the 100 th
Congress convenes Jan. 6, congressional leaders said.
The announcement of the new committees came
as the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence com
pleted a fourth day of closed hearings on the Iran
arms operation, and the chairman of the committee,
Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.), said the panel
will expand the scope of its investigation.
Durenberger said the committee staff is issuing
subpoenas around the country for documents on the
Iran operation and that the committee's witness list
"has expanded" and might soon include all senior of
ficials on the National Security Council with the ex
ception of President Reagan and Vice President Bush.
Potential witnesses could thus include White
House chief of staff Donald Regan as well as top
Cabinet officials.
Durenberger, expressing frustration at the refusal

of two recently departed administration officials to
testify before the committee this week, urged Reagan
to give the intelligence panel the information it re
quires to fully understand the details of the Iranian
arms and contra-aid operations.
"I am just concerned about the fact that the
country needs to put this behind it as soon as possi
ble," said Durenberger. "The president is in the best
position to do that at this point in time. Both on the
Iran side and particularly on the side of the Central
American connection, the president can find the
answers to those questions far more readily than we
can."
Vice Adm. John Poindexter, who resigned last
week as Reagan's national security adviser, and Lt.
Col. Oliver North, a key deputy to Poindexter,
invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self
incrimination, refusing to answer questions from the
committee.
Reagan yesterday defended the decisions by Poin
dexter and North to invoke the Fifth Amendment,
saying, "It is not new or unusual, it's happened many
times before, that when there is going to be an inde
pendent counsel starting an investigation, that indi

viduals that have no access to files or papers or time
for preparation for questions, have done just exactly
the same thing, so that they then can be witnesses for
the investigation."
The formation of the special investigating commit
tees in the House and Senate followed days of dicker
ing among congressional leaders over whether
Congress should be called back into special session
this month to create the committees or wait until Jan
uary.
The two committees are to be created by separate
resolutions in each House. The last such select inves
tigating committee was a Senate panel created to in
vestigate the Watergate scandal under the leadership
of the late Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.).
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and
Democratic leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), who will
become majority leader when the Senate reconvenes
in January under Democratic control, agreed yester
day on an 11 -member committee of six Democrats
and five Republicans, plus one non-voting ex officio
member from each party. They said they would an
nounce the membership by Dec. 15.
