A Special Invitation 112 rom the Alumni
Association and the Athletic Department
Dear Stanford F<x)tball Fan:
The Cardinal needs you at the Gator Bowl on December 27! Don't miss this opportunity to enjoy one of the
greatest highlights in Stanford sports history — the first-ever appearance by a Pac-10 team in the 42-year history of
the Gator Bowl and the first meeting of Athletic Coast Conference champion Clemson University Tigers and
Stanford Cardinal.
We have organized two fine booster tour packages for you to choose from — a deluxe four-night stay at the filmed
Amelia Island Plantation Resort or a super-economy special at the downtown Jacksonville Hilton.
Come join us for the Gator Bowl and cheer on the Stanford Red. Thank you for your support!
