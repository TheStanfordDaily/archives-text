AMERICANS, ISRAEL & PEACE
I he peoples of the United States and Israel share common ideals, values,
and spiritual roots. Both countries are committed to democracy, justice, and
freedom. WE AFFIRM OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE STATE OF
ISRAEL and its right to live within secure borders free from threats or acts of
violence. It is essential for the Congress and the Administration to continue the
bi-partisan policies which will enhance Israel's economic recovery and military
security. These policies are beneficial to Americans and Israelis and to all lovers
of freedom.
In light of this consensus, we commemorate the November 29, 1947,
United Nations resolution which lead to the establishment of the state of Israel.
That resolution reflected the high ideals and fundamental principles of the
U.N., sadly neglected in recent years. The Arab rejection of the November
29th resolution has led to a continued state of war in the Middle East. We call
on Israel's neighbors to end their rejectionist policies and join the process
which makes peace a reality: a process which requires compromise by both
parties to succeed.
Peace between Israel and her neighbors, as reflected in the Camp David
Accords, must encompass normal diplomatic and commercial relations, the end
of hostile propaganda, and the termination of political and economic warfare.
There must be mutual understanding and respect by all peoples who live in the
region of the Middle East, particularly by Israel and the Palestinians. When
these goals are realized, Israel and her neighbors will enjoy harmony,
prosperity, and peace.
