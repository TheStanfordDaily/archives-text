NASTY ELVES
WILL
MAKE YOU
THEIR PREY
(Sung to the tune of "Santa Claus
is Coming to Town")
Didn't call SURE
'Cause you're too shy?
You better do it now, I'm telling
you why.
Nasty elves will make you their
prey.
They know when you're alone,
This threat is not a fake!
The evil elves are bad, not good.
So call SURE for goodness' sake!
A friendly SURE escort
Will drive you home at night
In his little cart, he'll take you
home tonight.
So evil elves won't make you
their prey.
