YES VIRGINIA, THERE IS
A PROGRAM BOARD
If there's one thing the ASSU does, it spends money. And it gives
money away, too. For good causes. People ask for maney, and we
have lists that we check to make sure they deserve it. We just
check the list once, no more. Look at all the money we gave away
this quarter. And there's still PLENTY left. Happy Hannukah.
