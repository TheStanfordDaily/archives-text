# Iran witnesses refuse testimony

WASHINGTON â€” In an atmosphere of high ex
pectation and continuing mystery, two of President
Reagan's former assistants most closely identified
with the clandestine Iran weapons scheme refused to
testify in public before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee yesterday, invoking their Fifth Amend
ment protections against self-incrimination.
Vice Adm. John Poindexter, Reagan's former na
tional security adviser, and his one-time assistant, Lt.
Col. Oliver North, appeared before a nationally
televised hearing for the first time. They answered no
questions about the secret arms shipments to Iran or
the diversion of money to aid the contra rebels fight
ing the government of Nicaragua that are the focus of
the most serious crisis of the Reagan presidency.
Speaking in a quavering voice and biting his lip,
North, a decorated officer who appeared in his
Marine Corps uniform, told Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-

Ind ): "I don't think there's another person in
America that wants to tell this story as much as I do,
sir." But North said he "respectfully and regretfully"
would not answer questions about the secret
schemes, in order to protect his constitutional rights.
He would not even say whether he was fired by
Reagan or had resigned.
On die other side of Capitol Hill, retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, appearing at a closed
hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Intelli
gence, also invoked his constitutional protection
against self-incrimination and refused to testify about
his role in the Iranian arms deal. Secord has been
linked both to those events and to the private net
work that was set up to help the contras.
Meanwhile, a House Foreign Affairs Committee
source said the White House is seeking to limit the
panel's access to key documents on the Iran and

Nicaraguan scheme, allowing only two staff mem
bers, selected by the White House, to review the
papers. "They're stonewalling," the source said.
"They're appealing to the Republicans for help. We 11
probably get some very limited access to some very
limited documents."
North, who the administration has said was the
only person who knew "precisely about the Iran
operations, was a target of praise and scorn by law
makers who hailed his patriotism but criticized his
silence.
North and Poindexter promised future coopera
tion with the Congress, but their Fifth Amendment
vows, and those taken by others elsewhere,
generated new debate about the problems of un
covering the full story of the Iran affair.
