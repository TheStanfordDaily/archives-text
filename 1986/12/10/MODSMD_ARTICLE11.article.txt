WASHINGTON — Profiteering by
arms brokers and middlemen substan
tially reduced the amount of money
from the secret Iranian arms sales that
was available to provide military assis
tance to the Nicaraguan contras, mem
bers of the Senate Intelligence Com
mittee said yesterday.
Chairman Dave Durenberger (R-
Minn.), whose committee has held
more than a week of closed hearings
on the matter, told reporters that the
panel has been unable to substantiate
Attorney General Edwin Meese's claim
that between $10 million and $30 mil
lion in profits from U.S. arms sales to
Iran went directly to the anti-Sandinista
guerrillas.
In fact, Durenberger said no
evidence has been found so far that the
contras received any cash from the
transaction. He said officials of the
Central Intelligence Agency have told
the panel that the military supplies
received by the contras from U.S.
sources over the last year did not
reflect a large infusion of money from
Iranian arms sales.
"The CIA witnesses who are respon
sible for that have gone over with us

the amounts and the kinds of lethal
equipment, and it is they who come to
the conclusion that they couldn't see
the evidence of any substantial sums of
money," he said.
The testimony of those officials is
consistent with the recent statements
of contra leader Adolfo Calero, who
said that the amount of military aid
provided to the Nicaraguan resistance
through private U.S. channels over the
last year amounted to far less than $10
million.
When asked if middlemen could
have pocketed some of the money,
Durenberger replied: "There is a
markup, if you will, over cost. The
various parties in this have shared in
that markup as payment for these
services A lot of brokers, as we
might call them, were involved in this
process along the way — obviously
they were compensated to some
degree."
Sen. William Cohen (R-Maine), a
member of the committee, added that
there is evidence that profits earned by
these middlemen were excessive.
