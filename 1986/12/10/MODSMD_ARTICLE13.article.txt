# Japan campus indicates new focus

### DIANE BISGEIER Staff writer 
Plans for an overseas campus in Kyoto, Japan, mark
a new effort by the University to shift its overseas
focus from Western Europe to other parts of the
world, including the Far East and Latin America.
There seemed to be a general consensus that
Stanford, by having all its overseas programs in West
ern Europe, was simply not in touch with preparing
students for the contemporary world," said Law Prof.
Thomas Heller, director of the Overseas Studies Pro
gram. The increased importance of the Pacific Basin
made the idea of not operating there a serious weak
ness."
The desire to expand the University's overseas
focus led to a series of faculty meetings last year.
Plans to open a Japan campus resulted, and an addi
tional program in Latin America is anticipated to
begin in the near future, according to Heller. The
Kyoto campus may open as early as 1988.
The Japan program, announced in Kyoto last week
by University President Donald Kennedy and Kyoto
University President Yasunori Nishijima, will consist

of one six-month term that involves three months of
study at Kyoto University and a three-month intern
ship with a Japanese corporation. Another nine
month program will consist solely of study at Kyoto
University and, according to Heller, is for "people
who are concentrating in Japanese studies." The
nine-month program will concentrate more on cul
tural aspects of Japan, while the six-month program
will place more emphasis on U.S.-Japanese relations
and will be more "institutionally focused," Heller
said.
In addition, the language requirement for the
longer program will be one to two years of Japanese,
while the six-month program will require only two
quarters of "survival Japanese" to take part.
Heller, who became director of Overseas Studies
in September 1985, added that the program has no
connection to the closing of the Vienna campus, an
nounced earlier this month. "This was done
beforehand. We started planning for this last year.
When I took this job, it was made clear that we had to
move our programs and re-evaluate opportunites
outside of Western Europe. So it's not a direct cause,
but a response to the increasing importance of Japan

and its influence on Stanford.''
This year there are 160 Japanese students enrolled
at Stanford, a record high. "The move is responsive
to changed geopolitical and economic conditions,"
said Heller.
The nine-month program is planned to run on a
consortium basis with Brown, Yale and Harvard uni
versities, and at least one American faculty member
will be present each year. Additionally, members of
the Stanford business and enginering faculty will in
struct in the six-month program. "We've still got a
long way to go in setting this thing up," said Heller,
who emphasized the need to raise funds and find a
good site for the campus. Although land is expensive
and scarce in Japan, the cost for the students will
remain the same as for other overseas programs.
"We wanted autonomy in setting up the curricu
lum," said Heller. "No national university in Japan
has ever dealt with American students before,
however, so Japanese facilities would be difficult to
use. We did not want to invade the province of
Japanese universities per se, and don't want to be on
their land or in their buildings, because it would
generate political complications."
