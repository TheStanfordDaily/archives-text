# Transplant recipient earns wings
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
When Stanford sophomore Andrew
Craze landed the Cessna 150 he was
piloting Monday, he not only earned
his solo pilot's license, he became the
first known heart-transplant recipient
ever to earn his wings.
Craze received a heart transplant at
the Stanford University Medical Center
July 10, 1983.
A member of the Stanford Flying

Club since October 1985, Craze has
been training for his solo license in a
Cessna 152 Aerobat under the tutelage
of senior instructor Robert Peterson.
"The major hassle was getting a
medical authorization," said Craze.
In order to qualify for the medical
certificate required to earn the license,
Craze had to be examined by a Federal
Aviation Administration physician in
Los Altos. Subsequently, the FAA asked
him for all his medical records and had
him take a cardiac stress test at the

Medical Center.
Bert Postma, the director of the Stan
ford Flying Club, said that Craze went
about getting the medical authoriza
tion himself.
"Many think that when you have a
heart transplant you can't do very
much," Postma said. He added that this
was not the case with Craze, who he
termed "an excellent pilot."
Unlike other solo pilots who have
their medical certificates reviewed
every 24 months, Craze will need to

have his reviewed every six months.
The license is issued for life, subject to
the review of the certificate.
During the course of the two-hour
test, Craze made three takeoffs and
landings.
As a solo pilot, he is now permitted
to fly alone in a limited radius from the
airport. He is not allowed to carry pas
sengers, however.
Craze plans to continue his flying so
he can earn his private pilot's license.
