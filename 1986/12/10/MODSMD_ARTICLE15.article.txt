# Paris classes go on amid student unrest

### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
Despite recent student unrest in
Paris, the University of Paris is still
in session and Stanford students are
attending classes, Deputy Director
of Overseas Studies Nancy Padgett
said yesterday.
The student demonstrations,
which began three weeks ago in
respoase to university reform legis
lation introduced by the French
government, have periodically
prevented Stanford students from
attending their classes at French
universities.
The proposed reforms, which
opponents claimed threatened the
French tradition of free, egalitarian
higher education, were withdrawn
from consideration Monday by the
French Prime Minister Jacques
Chirac in response to the violent
demonstrations.
Thomas Heller, director of Stan
ford's Overseas Studies Program,
discounted the effects of the
protests on Stanford students in
France. "The French first semester
is often less organized (than the
second). The real academic push
begins after New Year's," said Hel
ler, terming the classroom time lost

to the demonstrations as dispen
sable.
Heller also pointed out that many
students do a significant amount of
their work outside of the classroom
in researching papers. This work
could be continued despite disrup
tions in the universities, he said.
Heller and Padgett described a
less disrupted situation than Stan
ford students studying in France,
who said last week that they were
not attending classes because of the
protests.
Junior Daralyn Durie said last
week that she could not attend class
at the Sorbonne last Wednesday be
cause strikers "weren't letting
people in."
The proposed university reforms
included measures that opponents
said would establish a hierarchy
among French universities, creating
competition among applicants for
admission.
Heller noted the difference be
tween the French system and the
one in place in the United States.
"Stanford students would be some
what more removed from the
causes (of the protests)... because
this situation is quite delimited to
France," he said.
