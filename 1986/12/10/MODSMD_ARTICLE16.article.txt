Times were when sexually transmitted diseases were
as simple as syphilis, gonorrhea, condoms and penicillin,
but no longer. The problem of sexually transmitted
diseases is a changing one. The rapid spread of new
diseases and the fact that more traditional diseases have
become resistant to older forms of treatment are clear
signs that this issue is by no means resolved.
Fortunately, however, Stanford's Human Biology Pro
gram is currently taking steps to help find solutions to
this deadly serious problem. By developing its first-ever
class on the subject, the program is enlightening stu
dents and giving sexually transmitted diseases the atten
tion they merit from the academic world.
The Hum Bio Program has always been innovative at
Stanford. It is not surprising that the program, the first of
its kind in the country, is leading the pack in addressing a
problem that threatens society as much as poverty or un
employment, but that political and academic leaders of
ten overlook.
Political science departments across the country offer
a multitude of courses on the impact and possible solu
tions of unemployment, but until now no biology depart
ment has had the imagination to design a course explor
ing the social, medical and moral issues related to
sexually transmitted diseases.
This lack of attention seems foolish when one realizes
that AIDS, a sexually transmitted disease, will cost
thousands of lives and will serve as a severe financial
burden to both government agencies and the insurance
industry. The rapid spread of chlaymydia, a sexually
transmitted disease that has only recently been identi
fied, also demands that more emphasis be placed on this

issue. Chlaymydia, which can result in hospitalizaton,
permanent damage to reproductive organs or sterility,
will infect approximately three million people this year.
The Hum Bio Program here has had the vision to
realize that one-page flyers and army training films are
not enough in the face of a problem that has continued
to evolve and worsen over time. It is heartening to find
that the program is willing to take a scholarly look at
sexually transmitted diseases, which most people mis
takenly write off as something merely to be avoided like
a flu bug or fatty foods.
Finally, the academic world is inviting undergraduates
to consider the biological and political aspects of a prob
lem that — directly or indirectly, through higher taxes
and medical costs — affects every member of society.
While the new class will undoubtedly be immensely
successful, it will perform an even greater service to stu
dents here if it is used in conjunction with Residential
Education's attempts at spreading practical information
about sexually transmitted diseases. Practical as well as
scholarly attention will keep Stanford a leader in the field.
Hopefully, Res Ed will look upon the new class as a
valuable resource of information and interested stu
dents. Instructors and especially students involved in the
course could be invaluable in designing dorm out-reach
programs that communicate necessary information in a
cogent manner.
The Daily recognizes the Hum Bio Program's capacity
for imagination and ingenuity and congratulates the pro
gram for again leading the nation in providing educa
tional opportunities where before there were none.
