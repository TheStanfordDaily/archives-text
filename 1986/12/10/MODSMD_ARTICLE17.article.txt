Last week's visit to Stanford by South African Gatsha
Buthelezi, chief minister of the Kwa-Zulu homeland and
outspoken opponent of divestment, sparked the ex
pected light protests from students involved in the di
vestment movement, especially Stanford Out of South
Africa.
But Buthelezi's visit also proved to be a missed oppor
tunity for the Commission on Investment Responsibility
to hold a meaningful discussion of both sides of the di
vestment issue.
Demonstrators and SOSA members' complaints about
the meeting, where Buthelezi spoke out against divest
ment to members of the CIR and other trustees, are in
one aspect well-founded. By neglecting to include any
opposing viewpoints in this meeting — SOSA recom
mended Leon Sullivan, author of the Sullivan Principles
— the CIR violated its role as mediator in the divestment
debate. To hold a meeting in which only the anti
divestment stance is represented makes the CIR appear
biased in its choice of information sources.
The demonstrators who supported SOSA in its protest
of Buthelezi's visit, however, also took an unreasonable
position in the issue. The idea that Buthelezi should not
have been allowed to visit simply because of his views

bears the mark of the same oppression that makes apart
heid so abhorrent. Every individual in this country, citi
zen and visitor alike, has the freedom to speak out with
his or her opinion. Buthelezi is no exception. To protest
what someone says is one matter, but to protest his
right to say it and the motives of those who allow it to be
said is quite another. This does not belong at an aca
demic institution.
Instead of creating more friction between SOSA and
the CIR, the two groups should have acted together last
week. Buthelezi's visit could have prompted a much
needed and informative forum, allowing the CIR and
trustees to examine both sides of the issue simultane
ously. If the CIR and SOSA had worked together before
Buthelezi's visit, the Stanford community could have
benefited from an open discussion of the issues in
volved in divestment.
Now that the meeting is over, however, SOSA and CIR
can consider coordinating their efforts to hold a forum
next quarter in which guests discuss their ideas on di
vestment. With more open communication, the new year
might see a resolution to better promote divestment
debate at Stanford.
