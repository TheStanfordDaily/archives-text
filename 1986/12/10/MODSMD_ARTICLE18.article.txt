Secretary of Education William Bennett hit a sore spot
last week when he attacked the nation's colleges and uni
versities for being too soft on drugs.
Citing leniency among college administrators, Bennett
declared that colleges "must eliminate any trace of insti
tutional approval or tolerance of drug use on campuses."
Bennett is right that there is too little concern about
drug use at American universities, but his hard-line ap
proach misses the point. What is needed is not rigid con
demnation, but rather improved efforts to educate stu
dents about the effects and potential dangers of drugs.
Like it or not, drug use is here to stay. No matter how
many college presidents take Bennett's advice and make
"clear and unequivocal" denunciations of drugs, stu
dents will continue to use, abuse and experiment with
controlled substances.
Given the reality of drug use, the most sensible avenue
for community concern should be an expansion of drug
education programs. Providing students with objective

and readily available information about drugs would
substantially reduce ignorant experimentation and
abuse.
Although Stanford's apparatus for educating students
about drugs is growing, it remains inadequate to the
needs of a large college campus. Currently, Cowell Stu
dent Health Center provides drug counseling to students
who seek it, and the Office of Residential Education en
courages dorms to sponsor drug awareness programs.
The ASSU is planning to co-sponsor a Drug Awareness
Week this spring. As part of the week's events, speakers
will be brought to campus, and drug awareness pro
grams will be given in the dorms.
That such an event is being planned is an encouraging
sign. However, more is needed.
Instead of leaving drug education to the initiative of
dorms and individuals, Res Ed should actively sponsor
drug programs in student residences on a frequent and
systematic basis.
