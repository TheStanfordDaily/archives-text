# I.G. deals with a changing world
## 
### 
The phone rang. As I rolled over to pick it up, I
caught sight of the clock: It was 3 a.m. "Hello?" I said.
"Lyons is dead,'' droned a gloomy female voice.
The Invisible Girl, of course.
"Grief, grief; sorrow, sorrow," she chanted.
" What do you mean, Lyons is dead?"
"I mean, we drove past it twice because the light
was off. They were taking out the curved banquettes
even as we watched. No more paisley carpeting. No
more pyramid breakfasts. No more, never, never, no
more," she sighed.

"You know. I believe I would have lived if you had
waited until tomorrow morning to tell me this."
"It wasn't even that late, and every place in this vil
lage was closed There was a huge crowd of people at
Denny's and anyway Denny's is gross and they don't
take credit cards and the Creamery is always freezing
and they don't even have phones in the booths any
more "
"1.G.. what is this really about?"
"Why do you always think everything I say is about
something else? Lyons is dead, that's all, and I think
it's a shame and a scandal, OK?"
"Because it's 3 a.m. and something else is bugging
you. Out with it."

"Why do Christmas carols make me feel sad?" said
I.G.
"What?"
"I was sitting in Burger King this afternoon,
waiting for the Marguerite, and they had a Christmas
carol tape going around and I just felt so sad.
She went on. "You know, we were driving up to
the Glas-Haus XXX-mas, and Cattrine said Christmas
carols make her feel all sparkly inside, like she was
walking through the snow."
Cattrine wears black all the time and has big black
hair and listens to dirges, and I found the idea of her
in the snow rather charming.
"Lots of people feel sad at Christmas, I.G. Don't
worry about it."
"Christmas carols, you know, they just make me
think of being little and watching the yule log on tele
vision and Bing Crosby and Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer ... man ... life was so easy then."
"I thought so."
"What?" she said suspiciously.
"This is really about Dead Week. In the immortal
words of Stephen Orel, You have to study. You don't
like to study. Hence, you are depressed.' "
"Wrong. Man, you are worse than Armand."
"Well, look, it's 3 a.m. Why don't you just spell it
out for me?"
"OK Change, Gwen Why do things have to
change? I was perfectly happy with things the way
they were. Sometimes it seems that just when I'm get
ting used to something ... just when I've got it
figured out ... it changes. The season ends. Classes
end. Lyons is closed. It depresses me."
"Everything that lives changes."
"That doesn't mean I have to like it," she said.
"OK. But things have been changing all quarter
and you haven't been depressed by it. I still say it's
about Dead Week. How are your finals going?"

"Don't ask."
There was a pause.
"All right. So how are your finals going, then?"
"Very well, thank you," I lied.
"You know why they call it Dead Week, don't you?
Not because of any moratorium on assignments or
anything. Hah. A reading period it is not. It's because
of the mental state of the student body. Death. The
end. Imminent destruction."
"Oh, cut that out," I said. "You sound like Cotton
Mather. It's not really Dead Week." Death is perman
ent, and Dead Week is nothing if not temporary."
I love I.G. but you have to be harsh with her
sometimes, for her own good. I've noticed some
thing about Dead Week though. People do go crazier
than ever, before and even during it. Julia and
Madeleine's roommate went to DVB two nights in a
row. Bee threw a carton of frozen milk against the
wall and growled at it. Gem watched two straight
hours of "Loveboat." And parties spring up all over
campus. Sometimes ... late at night... when I'm in a
particularly fanciful mood ... I think ... gee,
wouldn't it be nice if we really did have a — a
reading period — before finals?
"Where am I supposed to go when I get hungry
late at night now?" the Invisible Girl said plaintively.
"Denny's or the Creamery, I suppose. Who knows,
maybe they're only remodeling ... drastically ... ot
maybe there will be something new and better. You
never know."
"Endings are sad," she said. "Even when they're
happy. And change is sad. Even when it's good. Why
do you think they call them finals?' "

waiting for the Marguerite, and they had a Christmas
carol tape going around and I just felt so sad.
She went on. "You know, we were driving up to
the Glas-Haus XXX-mas, and Cattrine said Christmas
carols make her feel all sparkly inside, like she was
walking through the snow."
Cattrine wears black all the time and has big black
hair and listens to dirges, and I found the idea of her
in the snow rather charming.
"Lots of people feel sad at Christmas, I.G. Don't
worry about it."
"Christmas carols, you know, they just make me
think of being little and watching the yule log on tele
vision and Bing Crosby and Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer ... man ... life was so easy then."
"I thought so."
"What?" she said suspiciously.
"This is really about Dead Week. In the immortal
words of Stephen Orel, You have to study. You don't
like to study. Hence, you are depressed.' "
"Wrong. Man, you are worse than Armand."
"Well, look, it's 3 a.m. Why don't you just spell it
out for me?"
"OK Change, Gwen Why do things have to
change? I was perfectly happy with things the way
they were. Sometimes it seems that just when I'm get
ting used to something ... just when I've got it
figured out ... it changes. The season ends. Classes
end. Lyons is closed. It depresses me."
"Everything that lives changes."
"That doesn't mean I have to like it," she said.
"OK. But things have been changing all quarter
and you haven't been depressed by it. I still say it's
about Dead Week. How are your finals going?"

"Don't ask."
There was a pause.
"All right. So how are your finals going, then?"
"Very well, thank you," I lied.
"You know why they call it Dead Week, don't you?
Not because of any moratorium on assignments or
anything. Hah. A reading period it is not. It's because
of the mental state of the student body. Death. The
end. Imminent destruction."
"Oh, cut that out," I said. "You sound like Cotton
Mather. It's not really Dead Week." Death is perman
ent, and Dead Week is nothing if not temporary."
I love I.G. but you have to be harsh with her
sometimes, for her own good. I've noticed some
thing about Dead Week though. People do go crazier
than ever, before and even during it. Julia and
Madeleine's roommate went to DVB two nights in a
row. Bee threw a carton of frozen milk against the
wall and growled at it. Gem watched two straight
hours of "Loveboat." And parties spring up all over
campus. Sometimes ... late at night... when I'm in a
particularly fanciful mood ... I think ... gee,
wouldn't it be nice if we really did have a — a
reading period — before finals?
"Where am I supposed to go when I get hungry
late at night now?" the Invisible Girl said plaintively.
"Denny's or the Creamery, I suppose. Who knows,
maybe they're only remodeling ... drastically ... ot
maybe there will be something new and better. You
never know."
"Endings are sad," she said. "Even when they're
happy. And change is sad. Even when it's good. Why
do you think they call them finals?' "

The phone rang. As I rolled over to pick it up, I
caught sight of the clock: It was 3 a.m. "Hello?" I said.
"Lyons is dead,'' droned a gloomy female voice.
The Invisible Girl, of course.
"Grief, grief; sorrow, sorrow," she chanted.
" What do you mean, Lyons is dead?"
"I mean, we drove past it twice because the light
was off. They were taking out the curved banquettes
even as we watched. No more paisley carpeting. No
more pyramid breakfasts. No more, never, never, no
more," she sighed.

"You know. I believe I would have lived if you had
waited until tomorrow morning to tell me this."
"It wasn't even that late, and every place in this vil
lage was closed There was a huge crowd of people at
Denny's and anyway Denny's is gross and they don't
take credit cards and the Creamery is always freezing
and they don't even have phones in the booths any
more "
"1.G.. what is this really about?"
"Why do you always think everything I say is about
something else? Lyons is dead, that's all, and I think
it's a shame and a scandal, OK?"
"Because it's 3 a.m. and something else is bugging
you. Out with it."

"Why do Christmas carols make me feel sad?" said
I.G.
"What?"
"I was sitting in Burger King this afternoon,
waiting for the Marguerite, and they had a Christmas
carol tape going around and I just felt so sad.
She went on. "You know, we were driving up to
the Glas-Haus XXX-mas, and Cattrine said Christmas
