# NCAA tests 36 football players

### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
In accordance with its tougher stand
on drugs in collegiate athletics, the
NCAA implemented its mandated drug
testing yesterday morning and tested
36 randomly selected Stanford football
players for foreign substances.
The 36 players, chosen from the 60-
member traveling squad, were tested
in the Stanford Stadium locker room.
Of those tested, only two starters, de
fensive back Toi Cook and offensive
lineman Kurt Josephson, were not se
lected.
The Stanford football team learned
Friday in a team meeting who would
be tested.
Exactly when the test results would
be available is uncertain. The NCAA
orginally said the results will be kept
secret. Recently, however, as pointed
out by Stanford senior defensive nose
guard Eric Volta, the names of two
North Dakota State players were

publicized after the players tested posi
tive.
Passed last January and imple
mented this year, the NCAA drug
testing guidelines require all major
sports teams entering post-season ac
tion to take a mandatory drug test that
will be sensitive to substances such as
anabolic steroids, amphetamines, mar
ijuana and cocaine.
The NCAA also will be legally
allowed to retest any playoff-bound
athlete at any point prior to the playoff
competition.
An athlete tested positive for a speci
fied illegal substance is ineligible. The
team, however, is not disqualified from
the post-season game, an amendment
that was added last summer.
Some questions have been raised
about the accuracy of the NCAA drug
test. According to Dennis Clark of the
Stanford Medical Center's Clinical
Chemistry Department, the NCAA uses
the most accurate test available â€” gas
chromotography mass spectrography,
which breaks down urine into all its
component parts, including any illicit
substances present.
If someone were to allege that a
mistake occurred in the testing, then
"the people in the industry retain
urine samples for six to 12 months. If
someone tests positive, they can
reanalyze the urine," according to
Clark.
Though abiding by the NCAA drug
testing decision, Stanford has not
openly applauded the NCAA approach
to the drug problem. Cardinal senior
fullback Brian Morris, who authored a
waiver that expresses the football
team's opposition to the drug-testing
program, has been outspoken in oppo
sition to the testing.
The Stanford football team waiver
signed by all 36 players tested
recognizes drug abuse as a "pressing
problem" but finds fault with the
"quick-fix" approach of drug testing.
"Only through education, counsel
ing and rehabilitation programs can
the (drug) problem be solved."
