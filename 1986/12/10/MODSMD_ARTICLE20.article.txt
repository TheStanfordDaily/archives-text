# The 						NIH's record is bad
## 
### 
Why is it that statements by Thomas Hamm, director of
Stanford's Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine, must al
ways be followed by a truth squad? He and Medical School
Associate Dean David Mendelow (Daily, Dec. 2), with a
swagger not quite warranted by either their grasp on or
rendition of the truth, take off in high dudgeon after a
recent editorial (Daily, Nov. 17) on lab animals.
The Daily had questioned the effectiveness of the NIH
(National Institutes of Health) as a safeguard for animals. As
examples, it cited violations at the University of Pennsylva
nia and Columbia University. Taking indignant exception,
the two authors confidently assert: "[The NIH] inspected the
... two schools' programs, discovered deficiencies and
suspended their research funding" (italics mine).

The NIH discovered nothing. And it was only because of
and after an animal rights break-in at the Penn Head Injury
Lab, the seizure of the researchers' videotapes and exposure
of the films on national television, in such columns as James
Kilpatrick's and before Congress, that a countrywide storm
of protest and a four-day sit-in at Secretary of Health and
Human Welfare Margaret Heckler's office that Heckler fi
nally turned off the spigot.

tapes revealed the lab committing such atrocities as bashing
in, time and again, with a force of up to 1,000 Gs, the heads
of only partially anesthetized baboons in obvious agony. All
this went on with a running commentary of blood-chillingly
callous jocularity among the researchers, who — among
other atrocities — performed an electro-cautery on a con
scious monkey and spilled acid on a desperately struggling
animal ("It's gonna eat your balls off," says one of the ex
perimenters.)
Noteworthy comment by the NlH's director, James Wyn
gaarden: "This is considered to be one of the best laborato
ries in the world." (Science magazine, June 22, 1984).
Nor did the NIH ever initiate an investigation at Colum
bia. There too, animal rightists entered the lab.
What they found were monkeys in small wire cages piled
on top of one another, in which an accumulation of urine,
feces and monkey chow randomly tossed in had collected in
the metal trays below the grill floor, so that the monkeys
had to pick their food out of their own excrement. When the
monkeys in the top cages moved, urine from the trays above
spilled onto the monkeys below. The stench was in
describable.
The animal activists took photos and presented them to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, charged with enforcing
the Animal Welfare Act, and the press. Columbia, with the
goods held on it, for the first time did not sign the obliga
tory NIH animal welfare assurance certificate, thus trigger
ing the funding cutoff — for conditions the NIH had
tolerated for years. (In the year since, the USDA has neither
replied nor, presumably, taken any action.)
Stanford, in one of the least publicized developments in
its history, ran afoul of NIH guidelines in 1981 and lost its

accreditation. Since then, the NIH has nearly doubled its
contributions, to an estimated $135 million for fiscal 1986.
Hamm and Mendelow, either inexcusably uninformed or
brazenly spreading disinformation, conclude: "In contrast
to the Daily's assertion, the NIH is quite effective in monitor
ing animal research."
The Daily, having suggested that Stanford's own Labora
tory Care Panel might profit from the inclusion of a member
chosen by and representing the animal welfare community,
brings the two down hard on it. After all, they say, the panel
already includes, in addition to other solid citizens, a past
president of a humane society (who, they fail to mention,
represents neither that society nor the humane community
at large, of which they have been specifically and formally
notified) — all reassuringly appointed by President Ken
nedy, the head of an institution that derives almost half its
annual income from the research conducted by the Medical
School. He must, therefore, suffer from a certain reluctance
to pick types likely to put too much of a crimp into this
lucrative arrangement.
The authors dispute The Daily's figure of an annual 70-80
million animals used nationally and cite an Office of Tech
nology Assessment report estimate the 1983 number at
"only 17-22 million." The same report, however, admits that
some estimates range "to upward of 100 million"and cau
tions that "all these data are unreliable" for several reasons.
One of them is that reporting is mandated only for animals
covered under the only piece of legislation protecting lab
animals, the federal Animal Welfare Act, which excludes
some $Q,percent of all research Hamm himself ad-,
mits that at no given time can even Stanford accurately give
the number of animals under its roofs'
The only important law that protects animals — the state
anti-cruelty statutes, under which you and I can be brought
to justice for mistreating our dogs and cats, specifically ex
empts laboratory animals (cf. Penal Code 599 c), and there is
nothing the biomedical establishment fights more viciously
than any meaningful attempt at changing that.
Knowing all of this full well, the authors nevertheless for
ward the bankrupt claim that "there are more laws ...
protecting... laboratory animals than ... pets and wildlife."
The survey they cite to demonstrate the majority of the
public is gung-ho in their support was conducted by the
Foundation for Biomedical Research, an organization
deserving of a chapter unto itself. Financed by a coalition of
royally contributing institutions, it was founded solely to
combat such revelations as the Penn tapes and to "fund a
major effort against the anti-vivisectionists." To this end it
solicited the aid of none other than — hold on to your hats
— the cosmetics industry, because, in the words of one of
its organizers, "it has a superb record for getting its message
to the public, and we very much need the experience of its
advertising personnel in helping us to go about our task." A
survey conducted by this exalted outfit rates all the
credibility of one conducted by the Rev. Jerry Falwell to
prove that most of the public believes in creationism.
"It is critical to have at hand accurate information when
confronting the important questions involved in this
debate," say Hamm and Mendelow. "Readers concerned
with this important issue deserve accurate reportage." The
authors should be suitably grateful to The Daily and this arti
cle for having provided it.
