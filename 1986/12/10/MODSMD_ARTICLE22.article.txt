# How to live through Dead Week
## 
### 
What follows here are actual events involving ac
tual people. In order to protect my friends, however,
I've decided to change their names around.
Dec. 1,1985
According to my Stanford calendar, today is the
first day of Dead Week, but I can't deal with that
sobering reality just yet. The Big Game weekend is
still fresh on my mind.
All the madness broke out with a pre-rally party in
Bobby and Phreddie's room. I'd be lying if I said al
cohol was not the focus of the party. Just out of con
trol — all kinds of drinks all over the place, B-52's
Rock Lobster blaring out of the speakers, people
trying to coordinate their dance moves....
I made the mistake of walking into the room with a

couple of limes and a new bottle of tequila. Instantly,
tequila became a communal property and, after
having several shots of my own, I had the dubious
honor of introducing Ed, Pernell and Frank to the
shot world.
By the time the rally bus arrived, I was left with an
empty bottle and defective brain. I don't remember
much about what happened in the rally bus, but I can
still hear Phreddie yelling, "Beat the weenies! Beat,
beat the weenies!"
The madness continued into the Big Game: The
first 23 points of the game were scored by the Card
inal; the last 21 by the Golden Bears. All this hap
pened only a week ago. And now I have a 10-page
paper due Tuesday, a Russian History final Wednes
day and a lab report due Friday.
Dec. 2,1986
There's something wrong with getting up at 5 a.m.
to deliver Christmas presents. But then again, other
than Secret Santa activites, what else is really worth
doing during Dead Week? Tiptoeing along the hall
way, I walk over to Micky's room and put down my

presents: a Stanford shot glass and "Joe Cool" shades.
It's 5:15 a.m. I have the 10-page paper due in less
than 12 hours. I've done the research. I've done a lot
of thinking. Now, all I have to do is write it.
Dec. 3,1985
After throwing my backpack on my bed, I head
over to Micky's room to see whether she has left any
message for me. Sure enough — "Dear Santa, I ex
pected a bottle of tequila to go with the shot glass."
No problem, Micky. Just wait 'til tomorrow morn
ing. Your math professor will be handing you a
nicely wrapped gift in class.
Dec. 4,1986
"You're crazy, man. Who would give a bottle of te
quila for a Christmas present?" asks Scott, who appar
ently has heard about the gift Micky had accepted this
morning in her calculus class.
"Well, I would. See you later, Scott."
I have no time to think about the tequila bottle
right now. My Russian History exam is tomorrow.
Dec. 5,1986
The feeling's always the same. Another history
exam has just ended. For two hours straight, I wrote
and wrote and wrote, grinding out as many facts as I
could.
There were about 15 people in the room, but we
were acting all alike — eyes riveted on to the blue
book, hands moving like machines, pencils spitting
out facts and theories and garbage.
"This can't be real education. What's more inane
than scribbling down words after words in a hurry
just to show only a fraction of your knowledge?" asks
a voice inside me.
"Probably flunking the test," replies another voice.
Dec. 6,1985
Grades don't reflect knowledge.
Dec. 7,1985
I'd like to use football terminology to describe my
situation. It was 2nd-and-45 before noon today. I had
started the day by taking 90 minutes to finish my
brunch in the dining hall. Then, two solid hours of
reading in the Braun Music Library made it 3rd-and
-20. And now it's 3rd-and-25: I've just received a delay
of game penalty — I'm sitting by The Claw, enjoying
the great weather. Pretty soon, I'll be launching a Hail
Mary.
Dec. 8,1985
Judging from what I see in Naranja, I just can't
believe end-quarter exams start tomorrow. Bruce is

cranking up The Who; Spike is sleeping in his room;
Bobby, Kirby and Phreddie are just being Bobby,
Kirby and Phreddie; Ducky, Cataline, Micky, Maria
and Larry are playing jacks with keys; and I'm just get
ting overwhelmed by peer pressure.
I go back to my room to grab my jacket. I've got to
get away.
"Hey, man. Where are you going? Don't you have a
morning final tomorrow?" asks Bruce as I walk past
his room.
"To the Flicks, man. I don't want to be over
prepared.''
Dec. 9,1985
When I found out that my last exam would be on
Tuesday, I started going around asking, "Does
anybody want to party with me Tuesday night?" I
wasn't too successful at the time.
But now that the calculus final is over, all the fresh
men are rushing into my room for some margaritas
and daiquiries. Scary. It's only Monday.
Dec. 10,1985
People become so much more interesting during
finals week. Just an hour ago, Maria and Catalina sud
denly started throwing salad at each other in the
dining hall. Outside, in the hallway, Bruce is pitching
plastic golf balls. And I'm making a "scream tape"
with Larry and Scott. In honor of most students' men
tal state during finals week, we're going to record
primal screams from songs like "Won't Get Fooled
Again" and "Revolution," and we're going to crank it
up at midnight.
Dec. 11,1985
Before I leave for the airport, I've got to put some
thing down on the "New Year's Resolution" board,
but nothing as dramatic as Gerald's last year. His New
Year's resolution was "to quit drinking beer." After
thinking for a while, I write: "To join the society of
ralphs and give Bobby, Phreddie and Kirby... an op
portunity to blackmail me 20 years later." Whenever
they were in a bad shape, when they were more
relaxed than ever before, I was there with my
camera. It's only fair to give them a chance.
"Ready to go?" asks Spike.
"Hell, yeah!" I say. Time to say goodbye to finals
and all the hassles. We're just going to blast
Springsteen and cruise down to SFO.
