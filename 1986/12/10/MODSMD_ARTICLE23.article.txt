Congratulations,
water polo team
When the Stanford men's water
polo team left for Long Beach two
weeks ago, it had two objectives in
mind: to complete an undefeated
season, and in doing so, to capture the
NCAA title for a second straight year.
When the game clock reached zero
last Sunday night, both goals had been
realized. California had dropped to
defeat, 9-6. The Stanford team, cham
pionship plaques in hand, returned to
its hotel to an enthusiastic welcome
from family and friends.
It can be more than a little in
toxicating to complete a season like
this one. Playing 36 games, losing not
one; not even falling behind in more
than three. It's enough to test anyone's
modesty.
In this case, however, the pride of
the players in their own achievement
seemed to be matched by a gratitude
toward that which stood by them on
their way to the top. Be it from
coaches, friends, family, fans or faith,
it was this guidance that had
combined with work and skill to
produce pride which, through
humility, became greatness.
Purity of motive is always attractive.

In an era of too much mediocrity and
compromise, there is something
irresistible about effort and ability so
skillfully driven that it completely
escapes defeat. This is the pursuit of
excellence at the highest level, the
way it reads in motivational books.
This is the stuff that legends are made
of. That which only happens in
movies. And the fact that it happened
right here, this year, on our campus,
rightfully makes us feel damn good.
Emotions that through hours of study
or debate never surface can be in a
two-second handshake wonderfully
clear. This is good. This is the way it
should be. And this is part of what
makes Stanford great.
Poet Robert Service wrote of "the
simple things, the true things, the
silent men who do things." A century
later, the strength of those words is
undiminished.
Hats off to Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti and men's polo '86. You've
done a great service for our school.
You've shown us what hard work,
commitment and skill can produce.
You've demonstrated qualities that
make winners far beyond the pool.
And you've reminded us that the
greatest inspiration of all is neither
complex nor out of reach.
It's just doing it right.
