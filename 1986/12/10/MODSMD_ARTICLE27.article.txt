## Clemson retains Southern touch 
### TRACY FURUTANI Editorial staff 
It is the South of Margaret Mitchell, not Tennessee
Williams.
You've been driving all day, leaving Atlanta just
after lunch. Now you're heading northeast on 1-85.
It's a clear Southern winter day, about 60 degrees.
The Blue Ridge Mountains, off in the distance to your
left, pace your journey.
You cross the Georgia/South Carolina border a
couple hours later. The sign says to turn off onto
State Route 28, putting you on a collision course with
the southern Appalachians.
Thirty minutes later, you top a slight rise and there,
in the valley below, caught in the late afternoon sun,
are the magnolias and bougainvilleas surrounding
the broad plantation and the lake.
"Clemson University, established 1893," reads the
gate. A marker tells you that when Thomas Green
Clemson died in 1886, he left behind 25,000 acres of
these foothills for the purpose of creating a scientific
institution.
"It should afford thorough instruction in
agriculture and the natural sciences connected there
with," read Clemson's will. "It should combine, if
practicable, physical and intellectual education."
The university does its level best to fulfill Clem
son's wishes; most of the 12,000 students are major
ing in either agricultural sciences or engineering.
"I'm kind of an outcast," says junior Freddie Lash
ley. "I'm in liberal arts."
She hails from North Carolina, which makes her
another kind of outcast: the out-of-state student. As
you might guess, most of the Clemson student body
******4 w*. M ' ywmla--

is from within South Carolinian borders. Associate
Dean of Student Life Kirk Brague admits that this
makes Clemson a "little parochial."
Not that schoolwork suffers. While the university
makes no pretense of belonging to the Ivy League, its
students, for the most pan, are drawn from the top 10
percent of their high school classes. The difference
between Clemson and Stanford, according to Brague,
is the amount of pressure people are under to per
form.
"The pressure is not so great here; people aren't
slitting their throats over grades," he explains.
"We're a fairly laid-back school, even compared with
fellow universities in the South."
The Southern influence is pervasive through the
university. "We're primarily a white school," says
Brague. "If you took away the football team, you'd
definitely notice that there were fewer black stu
dents."
Strangely appropriate for a school located on John
C. Calhoun's old plantation. Calhoun, you recall from
high school history, was the firebrand senator from
South Carolina who argued for Southern secession
in the years before the War Between the States. Clem
son was Calhoun's son-in-law, which is how he ac
quired this prime piece of real estate.
And with its plantation past, you might expect the
scions of wealthy Southern families to attend.
Though most of the students seem to be from upper
middle class backgrounds, says Lashley, the editor of
the Clemson student literary magazine, true South
ern belle and beau types are few.
"I have a friend who's an an dealer," she contin
ues. "He tells me that you can't sell the expensive an
here like you can at Duke."

The typical Clemson student is also religious.
Indeed, there are 22 religious organizations on
campus, the largest claiming a membership of 200.
But religion seems to be the only non-athletic big
draw in the school.
"They (the Clemson students) don't want to get in
volved in something not directly related to course
work," adds Lashley. "Last year, they had a pro-life
demonstration, and you'd expect at a place like this
that it'd draw a big crowd. Thirty people showed
up It takes a lot to get students to show up."
Some of the apathy can be attributed to the rural
nature of the school. "(The social life) could be bet
ter," says Brague. "There's not a lot of bars in town;
some nightclubs." Since the drinking age in the state
went up to 21, parties have suffered, he notes.
"A lot of the students go home," which com
pounds the social life problem, continues Brague.
"We're kind of a suitcase college." For entertainment,
students go to Greenville, 25 miles away, or, for
weekends, wander to Atlanta. Quite a large contin
gent of Clemsonites roam or ski, depending on the
season, the Blue Ridge Mountains.
However, this rusticity and easy-going atmosphere
evaporates like sweat on a pig's brow when football
comes to town. Football is the Mason-Dixon line of
South Carolina. "The people in South Carolina divide
allegiances between the two major universities,
Clemson and the University of South Carolina (at Co
lumbia)," explains Brague.
The fans of the university's football team are rather
partial to the home team in a manner similar to the
partisanship displayed by South American soccer

fans. The Clemson stadium has earned
the moniker "Death Valley" from other
teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference
for the ferocity with which the fans
support Clemson.
" 'Course, the biggest thing that ever
happened around here was when we
won the national championship back
in '81," recalls Brague. "We've got the
sixth largest college stadium in the
country in a university of 12,000 and a
town of less than 20,000, but we
manage to fill it."
"A lot of people think that football is
overemphasized here," counters Lash

ley. "Around campus, you never see a
whole lot of people wearing orange
(the school color)." She concedes that
on home game days, orange over
whelms the campus.
Football aside, Clemson University
fills a niche for students from rural
areas who would be adversely affected
by going to college in a large institu
tion or urban setting.
"Clemson has a very homey kind of
atmosphere," which reassures these
students, Brague concludes. "At the
same time, we're broadening their ex
posure to cultural events."
More to the point, "Clemson carries
a little better name than U. of South
Carolina," says junior Mack McGill.
"It's away from Columbia, it's in the
state, and it's pretty inexpensive."
It is the South of Margaret Mitchell, not Tennessee
Williams.

are the magnolias and bougainvilleas surrounding
the broad plantation and the lake.
"Clemson University, established 1893," reads the
gate. A marker tells you that when Thomas Green
Clemson died in 1886, he left behind 25,000 acres of
these foothills for the purpose of creating a scientific
institution.
"It should afford thorough instruction in
agriculture and the natural sciences connected there
with," read Clemson's will. "It should combine, if
practicable, physical and intellectual education."
The university does its level best to fulfill Clem
son's wishes; most of the 12,000 students are major
ing in either agricultural sciences or engineering.
"I'm kind of an outcast," says junior Freddie Lash
ley. "I'm in liberal arts."
She hails from North Carolina, which makes her
another kind of outcast: the out-of-state student. As
you might guess, most of the Clemson student body
******4 w*. M ' ywmla--

is from within South Carolinian borders. Associate
Dean of Student Life Kirk Brague admits that this
makes Clemson a "little parochial."
Not that schoolwork suffers. While the university
makes no pretense of belonging to the Ivy League, its
students, for the most pan, are drawn from the top 10
percent of their high school classes. The difference
between Clemson and Stanford, according to Brague,
is the amount of pressure people are under to per
form.
"The pressure is not so great here; people aren't
slitting their throats over grades," he explains.
"We're a fairly laid-back school, even compared with
fellow universities in the South."
The Southern influence is pervasive through the
university. "We're primarily a white school," says
Brague. "If you took away the football team, you'd
definitely notice that there were fewer black stu
dents."
Strangely appropriate for a school located on John
C. Calhoun's old plantation. Calhoun, you recall from
high school history, was the firebrand senator from
South Carolina who argued for Southern secession
in the years before the War Between the States. Clem
son was Calhoun's son-in-law, which is how he ac
quired this prime piece of real estate.
And with its plantation past, you might expect the
scions of wealthy Southern families to attend.
Though most of the students seem to be from upper
middle class backgrounds, says Lashley, the editor of
the Clemson student literary magazine, true South
ern belle and beau types are few.
"I have a friend who's an an dealer," she contin
ues. "He tells me that you can't sell the expensive an
here like you can at Duke."

The typical Clemson student is also religious.
Indeed, there are 22 religious organizations on
campus, the largest claiming a membership of 200.
But religion seems to be the only non-athletic big
draw in the school.
"They (the Clemson students) don't want to get in
volved in something not directly related to course
work," adds Lashley. "Last year, they had a pro-life
demonstration, and you'd expect at a place like this
that it'd draw a big crowd. Thirty people showed
up It takes a lot to get students to show up."
Some of the apathy can be attributed to the rural
nature of the school. "(The social life) could be bet
ter," says Brague. "There's not a lot of bars in town;
some nightclubs." Since the drinking age in the state
went up to 21, parties have suffered, he notes.
"A lot of the students go home," which com
pounds the social life problem, continues Brague.
"We're kind of a suitcase college." For entertainment,
students go to Greenville, 25 miles away, or, for
weekends, wander to Atlanta. Quite a large contin
gent of Clemsonites roam or ski, depending on the
season, the Blue Ridge Mountains.
However, this rusticity and easy-going atmosphere
evaporates like sweat on a pig's brow when football
comes to town. Football is the Mason-Dixon line of
South Carolina. "The people in South Carolina divide
allegiances between the two major universities,
Clemson and the University of South Carolina (at Co
lumbia)," explains Brague.
The fans of the university's football team are rather
partial to the home team in a manner similar to the
partisanship displayed by South American soccer

fans. The Clemson stadium has earned
the moniker "Death Valley" from other
teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference
for the ferocity with which the fans
support Clemson.
" 'Course, the biggest thing that ever
happened around here was when we
won the national championship back
in '81," recalls Brague. "We've got the
sixth largest college stadium in the
country in a university of 12,000 and a
town of less than 20,000, but we
manage to fill it."
"A lot of people think that football is
overemphasized here," counters Lash

ley. "Around campus, you never see a
whole lot of people wearing orange
(the school color)." She concedes that
on home game days, orange over
whelms the campus.
Football aside, Clemson University
fills a niche for students from rural
areas who would be adversely affected
by going to college in a large institu
tion or urban setting.
"Clemson has a very homey kind of
atmosphere," which reassures these
students, Brague concludes. "At the
same time, we're broadening their ex
posure to cultural events."
More to the point, "Clemson carries
a little better name than U. of South
Carolina," says junior Mack McGill.
"It's away from Columbia, it's in the
state, and it's pretty inexpensive."
It is the South of Margaret Mitchell, not Tennessee
Williams.
You've been driving all day, leaving Atlanta just

It's a clear Southern winter day, about 60 degrees.
The Blue Ridge Mountains, off in the distance to your

You cross the Georgia/South Carolina border a
