# Gator retains Midas touch

### TRACY FURUTANI Editorial staff 
The world transforms in the eight
hour drive from the quiet beauty of the
Blue Ridge Mountains to Jacksonville
— "Florida's Business City on Florida's
First Coast," according to the Gator
Bowl Media Guide put out by the
Gator Bowl Association, the booster
committee for the game.
They make sure you understand the
point of the Gator Bowl — "Big busi
ness — you bet!" concludes a section
entitled "The Gator Bowl Association
— An Economic Fact."
"But that's the way it's supposed to
be — the Gator Bowl Football Classic,
like all other Bowl games, was founded
to bring new dollars into the local eco
nomy," the pamphlet says.
Perhaps that's why the game seems
like just another event in what is
termed "Gator Bowl Week "
There's a Gator Bowl Regatta.
There's a Gator Bowl Invitational col
legiate golf competition. There's a
Gator Bowl Challenge Cup golf tourna
ment. There's a Gator Bowl Junior Ten
nis Competition, a Gator Bowl 10K
run, a citywide Gator Bowl Hoedown
and a Gator Bowl Basketball Tourna
ment. And, of course, there's a Gator
Bowl Queen — for completeness'
sake, Ashley Gillrup of the University
of Florida.
And, last year, according to the
guide, "Gator Bowl Week (took) a
major step forward ... with the addi
tion of a Gator Bowl Parade to the
lineup of activities.
"(This) event will take on a major
league look its first year out with over
80 units being viewed by thousands
along the parade route and 8.5 million
on television in 60 markets,"the guide
continues.
Clemson, a town of 8,000, is prob
ably not a market.
Nonetheless, in two weeks, 25,000
Clemson fans will drive down 1-26 and
95 for what they remember the main
point of Gator Bowl Week to be —
Clemson grinding opponents into the
dirt, like on New Year's Day, 1949,
when it defeated Missouri, 24-23.
Since then, Clemson has fared so-so.

Overall, it's 2-2 in Gator Bowls.
Fortunately, Tiger fans are better
storytellers than the Gator Bowl Asso
ciation, which seems to think the his
tory of the Gator Bowl consists of lis
ting the dates the Gator Bowl Stadium
was expanded.
Not that thai isn't exciting. Why,
when the stadium first opened in 1925,
it was Compared unfavorably to "Pa
Perkins' back pasture lot." But then, it
seated only 7,500, so what could you
expect?
Since then, though. Gator Bowl
Stadium has been a hotbed of expan
sionism. In 1929, the media guide tells
us, the stadium's capacity jumped to
14,000; in 1948, 36,000; in 1957, 42,000;
in 1960, 48,000. The north end of the
stadium was closed in 1965, bringing
seating to a whopping 60,000, then in
1967 — check this out — the south
end zone was closed for a total capacity
of 65,000 plus.
Last year, some costly renovation
brought the stadium's holding ability'
to 82,000 bodies, second only to the
Rose Bowl's 102,000 among bowl
stadia. But with a rate of increase of
1,250 seats per year, the Gator Bowl
should eclipse the Pac-10/Big Ten
pretender by the year 2006.
Naturally, the press guide glosses
over some of the more mundane mo
ments of Gator Bowl history, such as
the moment in the 1978 game when
Ohio State Coach Woody Hayes
punched out Clemson's Charlie
Baumann after Baumann intercepted
an Ohio State pass in the closing
minutes of the game. This incident led
to Hayes' dismissal after 28 years of
coaching the Buckeyes, but that prob
ably won't increase the game's market
share in Paducah — which explains
why it's not in the press guide.
To be fair, the guide'does devote a
whole page to recounting the 1984
game, when Oklahoma State defeated
South Carolina with a 25-yard touch
down pass with 1:04 left in the fourth
quarter. To put the game's excitement
into perspective, the guide concludes
that it was also the eighth straight
Gator Bowl sellout.
Given its history, the Gator Bowl's
string of sellouts should continue.

Rose Bowl's 102,000 among bowl
stadia. But with a rate of increase of
1,250 seats per year, the Gator Bowl
should eclipse the Pac-10/Big Ten
pretender by the year 2006.
Naturally, the press guide glosses
over some of the more mundane mo
ments of Gator Bowl history, such as
the moment in the 1978 game when
Ohio State Coach Woody Hayes
punched out Clemson's Charlie
Baumann after Baumann intercepted
an Ohio State pass in the closing
minutes of the game. This incident led
to Hayes' dismissal after 28 years of
coaching the Buckeyes, but that prob
ably won't increase the game's market
share in Paducah — which explains
why it's not in the press guide.
To be fair, the guide'does devote a
whole page to recounting the 1984
game, when Oklahoma State defeated
South Carolina with a 25-yard touch
down pass with 1:04 left in the fourth
quarter. To put the game's excitement
into perspective, the guide concludes
that it was also the eighth straight
Gator Bowl sellout.
Given its history, the Gator Bowl's
string of sellouts should continue.
The world transforms in the eight
hour drive from the quiet beauty of the
Blue Ridge Mountains to Jacksonville
— "Florida's Business City on Florida's
First Coast," according to the Gator
Bowl Media Guide put out by the
Gator Bowl Association, the booster
committee for the game.
They make sure you understand the
point of the Gator Bowl — "Big busi
ness — you bet!" concludes a section
entitled "The Gator Bowl Association
— An Economic Fact."
"But that's the way it's supposed to
be — the Gator Bowl Football Classic,
like all other Bowl games, was founded
to bring new dollars into the local eco
nomy," the pamphlet says.
Perhaps that's why the game seems
like just another event in what is
termed "Gator Bowl Week "
There's a Gator Bowl Regatta.
There's a Gator Bowl Invitational col
legiate golf competition. There's a
Gator Bowl Challenge Cup golf tourna
ment. There's a Gator Bowl Junior Ten
nis Competition, a Gator Bowl 10K
run, a citywide Gator Bowl Hoedown
and a Gator Bowl Basketball Tourna
ment. And, of course, there's a Gator
Bowl Queen — for completeness'
sake, Ashley Gillrup of the University
of Florida.
And, last year, according to the
guide, "Gator Bowl Week (took) a
major step forward ... with the addi
tion of a Gator Bowl Parade to the
lineup of activities.
"(This) event will take on a major
league look its first year out with over
80 units being viewed by thousands
along the parade route and 8.5 million
on television in 60 markets,"the guide
continues.
Clemson, a town of 8,000, is prob
ably not a market.
Nonetheless, in two weeks, 25,000
Clemson fans will drive down 1-26 and
95 for what they remember the main
point of Gator Bowl Week to be —
Clemson grinding opponents into the
dirt, like on New Year's Day, 1949,
when it defeated Missouri, 24-23.
Since then, Clemson has fared so-so.

Overall, it's 2-2 in Gator Bowls.
Fortunately, Tiger fans are better
storytellers than the Gator Bowl Asso
ciation, which seems to think the his
tory of the Gator Bowl consists of lis
ting the dates the Gator Bowl Stadium
was expanded.
Not that thai isn't exciting. Why,
when the stadium first opened in 1925,
it was Compared unfavorably to "Pa
Perkins' back pasture lot." But then, it
seated only 7,500, so what could you
expect?
Since then, though. Gator Bowl
Stadium has been a hotbed of expan
sionism. In 1929, the media guide tells
us, the stadium's capacity jumped to
14,000; in 1948, 36,000; in 1957, 42,000;
in 1960, 48,000. The north end of the
stadium was closed in 1965, bringing
seating to a whopping 60,000, then in
1967 — check this out — the south
end zone was closed for a total capacity
of 65,000 plus.
Last year, some costly renovation
brought the stadium's holding ability'
to 82,000 bodies, second only to the
Rose Bowl's 102,000 among bowl
stadia. But with a rate of increase of
1,250 seats per year, the Gator Bowl
should eclipse the Pac-10/Big Ten
pretender by the year 2006.
