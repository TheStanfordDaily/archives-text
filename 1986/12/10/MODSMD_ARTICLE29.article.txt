# Bug eyes calories of Wilbur diners

### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
My girlfriend currently resides in
one of the Wilbur residences. Recently,
I've been noticing that she has in
creased her girth along with her knowl
edge this quarter. Could you find out
how many calories Wilbur Food Ser
vice feeds all the unfortunate and un
susf)ecting Wilburites at a meal? How
many does that work out to per per
son?

I spent a good bit of time this week
pursuing this weighty matter with Lois
Ohms, assistant manager of the Univer
sity Food Service and Test Kitchen
Dietician.
Ohms gave me a week's worth of
sample menus broken down into their
nutritive content. From them, I deter
mined that the average patron of Food
Service is getting about 2,800 calories a
day. The recommended daily allow
ance as calculated by the U.S. Deptart
ment of Agriculture is 2,800 calories
for males 18 to 22 and 2,000 calories
for women 18 to 22.
Looking specifically at last
Thursday's dinner at Wilbur, about

705,422 calories were served up by the
hashers (that's 671 meals at 1,051
calories each).
University-wide, at least 8 million
calories are served each day.
How, you ask, does this compare
with the rest of the world? I'll tell you.
According to the statistical data put
out by the Food and Agriculture Or
ganization of the United Nations for
the years 1975-1977, the world's
average caloric intake was 2,571
calories. The average in the United
States was 3,578 calories; the average
in Ethiopia was 1,793 calories.
Obviously, Stanford students are
making up the difference in their
caloric intake with Fro Yo.
If you feel like you're making too
much progress on your "Freshman
10," there are a few ways to refuse
delivery of Food Service calories
(assuming that your caloric intake is
strictly what you're getting at meals
and not at the Co Po).
• Drink skim milk. Surprisingly, whole
milk has nearly twice the calories of
skim milk. Have a glass at each meal,
and that tends to add up.
• Eat less red meat. Ohms' law is that a
red meat, a white meat (chicken, fish
