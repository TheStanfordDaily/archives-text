# Bug eyes calories of Wilbur diners
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
My girlfriend currently resides in
one of the Wilbur residences. Recently,
I've been noticing that she has in
creased her girth along with her knowl
edge this quarter. Could you find out
how many calories Wilbur Food Ser
vice feeds all the unfortunate and un
susf)ecting Wilburites at a meal? How
many does that work out to per per
son?
— Slim at Stern
I spent a good bit of time this week
pursuing this weighty matter with Lois
Ohms, assistant manager of the Univer
sity Food Service and Test Kitchen
Dietician.
Ohms gave me a week's worth of
sample menus broken down into their
nutritive content. From them, I deter
mined that the average patron of Food
Service is getting about 2,800 calories a
day. The recommended daily allow
ance as calculated by the U.S. Deptart
ment of Agriculture is 2,800 calories
for males 18 to 22 and 2,000 calories
for women 18 to 22.
Looking specifically at last
Thursday's dinner at Wilbur, about

705,422 calories were served up by the
hashers (that's 671 meals at 1,051
calories each).
University-wide, at least 8 million
calories are served each day.
How, you ask, does this compare
with the rest of the world? I'll tell you.
According to the statistical data put
out by the Food and Agriculture Or
ganization of the United Nations for
the years 1975-1977, the world's
average caloric intake was 2,571
calories. The average in the United
States was 3,578 calories; the average
in Ethiopia was 1,793 calories.
Obviously, Stanford students are
making up the difference in their
caloric intake with Fro Yo.
If you feel like you're making too
much progress on your "Freshman
10," there are a few ways to refuse
delivery of Food Service calories
(assuming that your caloric intake is
strictly what you're getting at meals
and not at the Co Po).
• Drink skim milk. Surprisingly, whole
milk has nearly twice the calories of
skim milk. Have a glass at each meal,
and that tends to add up.
• Eat less red meat. Ohms' law is that a
red meat, a white meat (chicken, fish
or turkey) and an equally attractive
vegetarian alternative are availabe at
every meal. Red meat is much higher
in calories than the other entrees. •
• Eat salad. A cup of lettuce has only 8
calories. Likewise for a stalk of broc
coli.
• Try a low-cal dressing. Regular salad
dres.%ing is very high in calories. Three
tablespoons of French dressing have
254 calories!
• Avoid breading, sauces and syrups.
Ohms says you can get fewer calories
by scraping the breading off foods,
avoiding fruits in syrup and skipping
some sauces.
• Have fruit for dessert. An orange has
71 calories. A piece of yellow cake with
chocolate icing has 233
• Avoid fats. Satchel Paige, who at the
age of 59 was the oldest man to pitch in
a major league baseball game, had six
"master's maxims" to longevity. The

first of these was to "avoid fried meats,
which angry up the blood." I don't
know if he was right, but fried foods
absorb lots of high calorie fat.
Bon Appetit!
Dear Bug Me,
All the Stanford libraries I have been
to take counts of people entering and
sometimes leaving. Just how many
people enter Stanford libraries?
— Book 'em Dano
Actually, not all the libraries keep a
count of the number of patrons who
go through the door. Most do,
however, and it is done with either a
turnstile (as is the case at Meyer Li
brary) or with a human who has a
counter at the "portal" (like at Green
Library).
Bureaucracies keep many statistics.
The University library system is a very
large bureaucracy, perhaps the largest
on campus to my mind, and it keeps
many statistics. Librarians can tell you
how many books are checked out

every year, how many books are taken
off the shelf but not checked out and
how many reference questions are
asked. I fear that I was counted
repeatedly as a reference question in
researching this inquiry, although I
don't feel I have a satisfactory answer
to report.
You see, bureaucracies compile
those statistics that serve its purposes.
Not all the libraries need to know how
many people are going through their
doors. For Green, which does, the sta
tistics seem to indicate how many
people need to be hired to count
people coming in through the door.
I was able to find out, however, that
in the last year 526,751 people entered
Green and 689,312 people entered
Meyer.
Apparently, knowing the total ag
gregate usage of the Stanford libraries
is not of use to the infomaniacs who
run them.
If it weren't Dead Week, I'd compare
Stanford library usage with that of the
Third World, but I'm just too busy.
