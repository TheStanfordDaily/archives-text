# Prop. 63 fosters national debate

WASHINGTON — U.S. English
language patriots won a coup last
month in California when voters
adopted Proposition 63, amending
the state constitution to make English
the state's official language, despite op
position from most state lawmakers
and civil rights groups.
The largest state in the union and a
national pacesetter, California passed
the measure Nov. 4 by a 3-to-l
majority. The ammendment ordered
the legislature to "make no laws which
diminish the role of English."
California joins six other states with
official language statutes, but political
analysts and linguists say the California
law will have unprecedented effects.
Unlike similar measures in Virginia,
Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky
and Georgia — which date as far back
as the 1920s and are largely symbolic
— the California law invites an ava
lanche of lawsuits by permitting "any

individual or business to sue to en
force the law."
California also becomes the first
state to welcome official English by
popular vote and to garner nationwide
attention, said Jeffery Nunberg, a lin
guist at the Stanford Center for the
Study of Language and Information.
"California is definitely leading a
trend ... with a need to assert funda
mental apple pie and motherhood
values," said Stanford English Prof.
Shirley Heath, a linguistics expert.
U.S. English, an organization that at
tracted 200,000 members in less than
four years, calls itself one of the na
tion's fastest growing citizen-action
groups. Buoyed by the 73-to-27 percent
mandate in California, it will continue
its two-pronged strategy: targeting
Florida, Texas and others on the state
level and lobbying Congress for a
federal ammendment, said Stanley Dia
mond, California director of the group.
