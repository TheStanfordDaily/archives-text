# Prop. 63 fosters national debate

### MARY K. McDEVITT 
WASHINGTON — U.S. English
language patriots won a coup last
month in California when voters
adopted Proposition 63, amending
the state constitution to make English
the state's official language, despite op
position from most state lawmakers
and civil rights groups.
The largest state in the union and a
national pacesetter, California passed
the measure Nov. 4 by a 3-to-l
majority. The ammendment ordered
the legislature to "make no laws which
diminish the role of English."
California joins six other states with
official language statutes, but political
analysts and linguists say the California
law will have unprecedented effects.
Unlike similar measures in Virginia,
Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky
and Georgia — which date as far back
as the 1920s and are largely symbolic
— the California law invites an ava
lanche of lawsuits by permitting "any

individual or business to sue to en
force the law."
California also becomes the first
state to welcome official English by
popular vote and to garner nationwide
attention, said Jeffery Nunberg, a lin
guist at the Stanford Center for the
Study of Language and Information.
"California is definitely leading a
trend ... with a need to assert funda
mental apple pie and motherhood
values," said Stanford English Prof.
Shirley Heath, a linguistics expert.
U.S. English, an organization that at
tracted 200,000 members in less than
four years, calls itself one of the na
tion's fastest growing citizen-action
groups. Buoyed by the 73-to-27 percent
mandate in California, it will continue
its two-pronged strategy: targeting
Florida, Texas and others on the state
level and lobbying Congress for a
federal ammendment, said Stanley Dia
mond, California director of the group.
This isn't the first time California has
served as a political laboratory for the
nation. In the past decade, Americans
— after a California introduction —
have embraced property tax reform,
toxic waste clean-up and Ronald
Reagan.
But political experts predict few
states will follow California's lead with
-| official English because none share its
unique demographic future.
Asians and Hispanics today comprise
j about one quarter of the state's popula
tion, and the continuing stream of
newcomers from Asia and Latin
America has brought predictions of a
| Hispanic-Asian majority by 2030.
j The country is adjusting to a wave of
j "new immigrants" from the Pacific
Basin who are "linguistically and cul
turally different... (and) very identifia
ble," said Ron Wakabayashi, national
director of the San Francisco-based

Japanese citizen league. The citizen
league is one of the many ethnic and
civil rights groups that think the pro-
English movement will foster racism.
"California is a border state, and
frankly, there is some mistrust, back
lash and fear" of the newcomers, said
Edward Chen, staff counsel for the
American Civil Liberties Union. "And
Proposition 63 plays on that.
"The hidden message (involves)
protecting our culture, way of life and
perhaps color," Chen said.
Chen and Wakabayashi said Califor
nians adopted the controversial initia
tive as a symbolic gesture with the
good-natured intent of transferring the
English language to the population.
They passed the "innocuous
sounding" measure with a "why-not at
titude," Wakabayashi said. "Voters
really didn't study this intitiative."
The underpinnings ot the national
movement are dangerous and xenop
hobic, he said.
No one knows yet how the Califor
nia State Legislature will translate the
amendment into practical terms. But

analysts agree the changes could be
both far reaching and costly.
Bilingual and trilingual ballots in
San Francisco and Los Angelos and
state bilingual education may be the
first programs lost to the movement.
Assemblyman Frank Hill, a Republi
can from Whittier and one of the prin
ciple backers of Proposition 63, is ex
pected to have a key role in putting the
law into effect. He told the Los Angeles
Times only days after the election that
he will ask the legislature to require
that driver's tests, welfare applications,
state university student-aid forms and
other state services be made available
solely in English. Only public health,
safety and justice services appear ex
empt from English-only reform.
Several groups against the measure
are joining under Californians United
to educate the public about the issues,
Chen said. Critics assail the English
measure as too broad, counter
productive, unnecessary and demean
ing. Some say they are preparing to
fight the law on constitutional grounds.

State and local governments will
soon be tied up in costly litigation as
proponents challenge non-English
state practices and opponents file
counter suits questioning the constitu
tional legality of the law itself, said
John Transvina, legislative attorney for
the Mexican-American Legal Defenses
and Educational Fund.
Transvina and Heath predict the offi
cial English law will not hold up under
legal scrutiny. State supreme court
rulings in lowa and Nebraska in the
1920s overruled state language
statutes, citing the due process clause
of the 14th amendment.
Gerda Bikales, executive director of
U.S. English said official English is not
only legal but urgently needed to
protect our national language and cul
tural unity.
"If we leave it to some laissez-faire
policy, we can expect other languages
will gain recognition as quasi-formal
languages of government and will rival
English like in Sri Lanka and Cypress,"
she said.

are joining under Californians United
to educate the public about the issues,
Chen said. Critics assail the English
measure as too broad, counter
productive, unnecessary and demean
ing. Some say they are preparing to
fight the law on constitutional grounds.

State and local governments will
soon be tied up in costly litigation as
proponents challenge non-English
state practices and opponents file
counter suits questioning the constitu
tional legality of the law itself, said
John Transvina, legislative attorney for
the Mexican-American Legal Defenses
and Educational Fund.
Transvina and Heath predict the offi
cial English law will not hold up under
legal scrutiny. State supreme court
rulings in lowa and Nebraska in the
1920s overruled state language
statutes, citing the due process clause
of the 14th amendment.
Gerda Bikales, executive director of
U.S. English said official English is not
only legal but urgently needed to
protect our national language and cul
tural unity.
"If we leave it to some laissez-faire
policy, we can expect other languages
will gain recognition as quasi-formal
languages of government and will rival
English like in Sri Lanka and Cypress,"
she said.
WASHINGTON — U.S. English
language patriots won a coup last
month in California when voters
adopted Proposition 63, amending
the state constitution to make English
the state's official language, despite op
position from most state lawmakers
and civil rights groups.
The largest state in the union and a
national pacesetter, California passed
the measure Nov. 4 by a 3-to-l
majority. The ammendment ordered
the legislature to "make no laws which
diminish the role of English."
California joins six other states with
official language statutes, but political
analysts and linguists say the California
law will have unprecedented effects.
Unlike similar measures in Virginia,
Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky
and Georgia — which date as far back
as the 1920s and are largely symbolic
— the California law invites an ava
lanche of lawsuits by permitting "any

individual or business to sue to en
force the law."
California also becomes the first
state to welcome official English by
popular vote and to garner nationwide
attention, said Jeffery Nunberg, a lin
guist at the Stanford Center for the
Study of Language and Information.
"California is definitely leading a
trend ... with a need to assert funda
mental apple pie and motherhood
values," said Stanford English Prof.
Shirley Heath, a linguistics expert.
U.S. English, an organization that at
tracted 200,000 members in less than
four years, calls itself one of the na
tion's fastest growing citizen-action
groups. Buoyed by the 73-to-27 percent
mandate in California, it will continue
its two-pronged strategy: targeting
Florida, Texas and others on the state
level and lobbying Congress for a
federal ammendment, said Stanley Dia
mond, California director of the group.
This isn't the first time California has
served as a political laboratory for the
nation. In the past decade, Americans
— after a California introduction —
have embraced property tax reform,
toxic waste clean-up and Ronald
Reagan.
But political experts predict few
states will follow California's lead with
-| official English because none share its
unique demographic future.
Asians and Hispanics today comprise
j about one quarter of the state's popula
tion, and the continuing stream of
newcomers from Asia and Latin
America has brought predictions of a
| Hispanic-Asian majority by 2030.
j The country is adjusting to a wave of
j "new immigrants" from the Pacific
Basin who are "linguistically and cul
turally different... (and) very identifia
ble," said Ron Wakabayashi, national
director of the San Francisco-based

Japanese citizen league. The citizen
league is one of the many ethnic and
civil rights groups that think the pro-
English movement will foster racism.
"California is a border state, and
frankly, there is some mistrust, back
lash and fear" of the newcomers, said
Edward Chen, staff counsel for the
American Civil Liberties Union. "And
Proposition 63 plays on that.
"The hidden message (involves)
protecting our culture, way of life and
perhaps color," Chen said.
Chen and Wakabayashi said Califor
nians adopted the controversial initia
tive as a symbolic gesture with the
good-natured intent of transferring the
English language to the population.
They passed the "innocuous
sounding" measure with a "why-not at
titude," Wakabayashi said. "Voters
really didn't study this intitiative."
The underpinnings ot the national
movement are dangerous and xenop
hobic, he said.
No one knows yet how the Califor
nia State Legislature will translate the
amendment into practical terms. But

analysts agree the changes could be
both far reaching and costly.
Bilingual and trilingual ballots in
San Francisco and Los Angelos and
state bilingual education may be the
first programs lost to the movement.
Assemblyman Frank Hill, a Republi
can from Whittier and one of the prin
ciple backers of Proposition 63, is ex
pected to have a key role in putting the
law into effect. He told the Los Angeles
Times only days after the election that
he will ask the legislature to require
that driver's tests, welfare applications,
state university student-aid forms and
other state services be made available
solely in English. Only public health,
safety and justice services appear ex
empt from English-only reform.
