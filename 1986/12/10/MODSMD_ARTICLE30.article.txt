## The 						Grinch that is Christmas 
### 
The Grinch hated Christmas! The
whole Christmas season! Now, please
don 7 ask why. No one quite knows the
reason. It could he his head wasn't
screwed on Just right. It could be, per-
Ixtps, that his shoes were too tight. But I
think the most likely reason of all may
have been that his heart was two sizes
too small.
With these immortal words, begins
one of the traditions that makes
Christmas worth waiting for — the
greatest of the many memorable works
by one Theodor S. Geisel. I prefer to
call him that, rather than to admit that a
man known to the world as Dr. Suess is
responsible for a highlight of my
Christmas season, another reading and
another viewing of "How the Grinch
Stole Christmas." But — I have to face
facts — that yellow-green, sinister resi
dent of Mt. Crumpit who put up with
Christmas for 53 years puts everything
in perspective for another year's
holiday festivities.
Who can unwrap a gift without
remembering the Grinch imagining
overzealous, underdeveloped brats
screeching about their toys? Who can
sing a Christmas carol and not think of
the Grinch shuddering at the off-key
droning emanating from the town
below? Who can dig into a turkey with

out recalling the reformed Grinch car
ving the "roast beast?"
Now, this is not to suggest I have
been completely duped by this high
tech Scrooge, who, after all, has more
in common with a furry bowling pin
than the reality of Christmas. "The
Grinch" only makes its impact when
taken in with the other great Christmas
masterpieces. Dickens' "A Christmas
Carol," Handel's "Messiah" and O.
Henry's "The Gift of the Magi" round
out a complete Christmas — humor,
music, drama, and, most of all, lots of
sincere holiday spirit.
Take away any of these, and you
have a sub-par Christmas. Take away
the Grinch, though, and you have no
holiday at all. Some examples of what
makes him special:
• Who could forget the Grinch's visit to
Cindy Lou's house? "He slithered and
slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
around the whole room, and he took
every present.... And he stuffed them
in bags. Then the Grinch very nimbly,
stuffed all the bags, one by one up the
chimbly!" Rhymes that would have
made Shakespeare jealous.
• Another memorable moment comes
when the old buzzard Grinch con
scripts his beleaguered dog, Max, into
service as his reindeer. "The Grinch

simply said, 'If I
can t find a rein
deer, I'll make one
instead!' So he
called his dog, Max.
Then he took some
red thread and he
tied a big horn on

the top of his head." This just can't be a
children's story.
If I dare push my luck by mention
ing the Bard not once but twice in the
same column with Dr. Seuss, I may as
well go all the way from the ridiculous
to the truly sublime by quoting Hamlet
on the Christmas season: "The nights
are wholesome; then no planets strike.
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to
charm, so hallow'd and so gracious is
the time."
Hamlet is half right. All the traditions
have their roots in the goodness and
cheer of the holidays; but it is the hyp
notic and timeless charm of the
Christmas works of art that makes the
season unbeatable.
You can have "Star Trek IV," eggnog
and New Year's Day parades. Give me a
fire in the fireplace, a little Massachu
setts snow and a stack of books topped
by "The Grinch."
