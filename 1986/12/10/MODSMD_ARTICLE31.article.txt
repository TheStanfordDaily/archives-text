Outside a blanket of stars covered the clear December
sky, while inside Memorial Church a similar constellation of
lighted candles illuminated the faces of hundreds of
celebrants of Midnite Mass.
Traditionally a Christmas morning celebration, Midnite
Mass was held'last Sunday at Stanford before students scat
tered around the world for the holidays.
Although not a Catholic, I and the many people of other
faiths were made welcome by Father Russell Roide, who
opened the Mass by saying, "We gather as a community of
friends We welcome people not only from the Catholic
community but also people from all faiths."
The unity of the evening was perhaps best symbolized
when everyone extinguished their individual candles and
held hands. The human chains extended through pews and
across aisles, and, for a moment, concerns of Dead Week
and exams were put aside.
Just as Stanford brings together students from varied
backgrounds and gives them a common denominator, so
too did the idea of fellowship transcend the boundaries of
the different faiths of the students and visitors in a nearly full
Memorial Church. The service itself exemplified this diver
sity as it included song, dance, readings and prayer.
While I did not undergo anything so extreme as a conver
sion to Catholicism, I was touched by the spirit of the event.

There will be much violence
committed in the name of re
ligion this Christmas season
in India, Northern Ireland
and the Middle East, but this
event celebrated love, not
hatred.
Christmas signifies the end
of the fall quarter. For most
freshmen, it is their first quar-

ter away from home and the successful first step of a long
journey. For seniors, it signals the beginning of the end of
their college careers, All came together Sunday morning to
reflect on their lives here and the approaching holidays.
Yuppie-dom took a back seat to thoughtfulness as Father
Thomas Finsterbach spoke of building friendships and the
"hundreds of people who have withdrawn" from relation
ships, in favor of other activities.
As the Mass wound down and the last strains of "Angels
We Have Heard On High" were played, visitors filtered
back out into the cold, starlit night, perhaps remembering
the words of one speaker, who said "the faint light of dawn
grows to the light of the perfect day."
Merry Christmas Stanford, may it be a peaceful one.
