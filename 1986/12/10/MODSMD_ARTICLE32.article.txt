Home for the holidays.
That whole notion sounded pretty cheesy to me when I
was a little kid growing up in Portland, Ore. Home for the
holidays. Big deal. Of course I was going to be home for the
holidays — 1 was home every day after school, too, munch
ing on Cheerios while 1 watched reruns of Mission
Impossible and Addams Family before digging into my
phonics workbook (though looking back now, I can't quite
recall what phonics was all about).
I've always loved Christmas, but when I was a kid it wasn't
because I was home; it was because 1 was out of school for
at least two weeks, and maybe it might snow half an inch or
so, and for sure I was getting the Fisher-Price airport set I
had asked Santa for, and Grandma was coming with those
special holiday cookies.
Home for the holidays means more to me now. School is
no longer two blocks away. My older brother and I have
both moved off to college, he on the East Coast and I in Cali
fornia, which sometimes seems a world apart from Oregon.
This past summer my family moved to Washington, D.C.,
after 20 years in Portland. My little brother decided to stay in
Portland to finish his last two years of high school. So the
whole family is spread out now, and there really isn't a
home for the holidays.
That was one of the first things I thought about when we
decided to move: What was going to happen at Christmas?
Eventually we decided to rendezvous in Portland for the
holidays. I think that was partly to accomodate my little
brother's schedule of basketball practices and games. But
more than that, 1 think we're going to Portland because
none of us could imagine spending Christmas elsewhere.
It wouldn't really be home, and it just wouldn't be the
same. Perhaps we're all just creatures of habit, scared to try
Christmas elsewhere. I don't think that's it, though. I think
the fact is that Christmas and home are linked inseparably
and for us, Portland is home.
It's hard to put my finger right on what it is about home at
Christmas that's so great. I know there's something
remarkably comfortable and stable about home during the
holidays. Being home at Christmastime is one of those
eperiences that year after year — like my birthday or the
end of finals week — always makes me feel warm and fuzzy
all over.
A big part of it, I think, is that during the holidays, home is
where the memories are for me. Christmas this year is in
separably linked to Christmas last year and all the
Christmases before that.
Every Christmas starts a little film of past Christmases
flashing before my eyes.
I can see my brothers and me, just out of the bathtub
(with hair smelling like Johnson and Johnson baby sham
poo), wearing our fuzzy jumpsuit pajamas with the footies
attached, gathering excitedly around the television to watch

the Grinch or Charlie Brown
Christmas for the fifth or sixth
consecutive year.
I can see my family going out
every year in search of a tree, wan
dering around freezing for a
couple hours before finally fin
ding one that pleased everyone

(though Mom and Dad were the only ones who really
needed to be pleased, since they were paying for it). And
then every year the tree mysteriously grew two feet between
the time we cut it and the time we tried to stand it up in the
living room, and the diameter of the bottom of the tree was
invariably twice that of the opening in the stand. So we all
swore a little under our breaths ("Crap! Not again"), got out
the saw and knives and started to saw and whittle until the
tree was finally standing.
Now I sleep in on Christmas Day, but I remember when I
was younger (before I became a sleep-deprived, narcoleptic
college student) my brothers and I would go to bed around
seven on Christmas Eve so we could get up about four the
next morning and tear downstairs to see what Santa had left
for us.
One of my favorite things to do was to turn off all the
lights in the house except those on the Christmas tree, and
then just bask in the tree's glow. I still love that.
Christmas has always been full of constants. Mom will
make her holy trinity of holiday foods — coffee cakes, plum
puddings and fruitcakes — and send them out to everyone
we've ever known even passingly. And my little brother and
I will hop in the car and distribute the foodstuffs to all cor
ners of the city — we're just glad to get the plum puddings
out of the house before she tries to make us eat them.
Mrs. Lamberton from across the street will bring over a
huge can of spritz cookies, and the McCormicks a few
houses away will drop by with a box of incredible
homemade fudge, and the next-door neighbor, Mrs. Kelly
(an Irishwoman who is quite possibly the fastest-speaking
individual I've ever known), will come over with even more
homemade candy. And my brothers and I will scarf down
every crumb within a day or two of the food's arrival in the
house.
And we will have a big Christmas dinner, then go to mid
night Mass, where we'll see dozens of families and friends
together for the only time of the year — college students
back from school, married children back with spouses and
kids of their own, grandparents visting from far away.
All those things happened last year; with any luck, they'll
all happen this year; and I hope they'll happen next year.
With the move and all, everything will be a little different
now. But it will still be home. And it will still be Christmas.
And it will be wonderful.
