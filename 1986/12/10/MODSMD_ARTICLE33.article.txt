# Hand of kindness
## 
### 
in aouui America, a man Knocks on a tew doors in his
apartment complex and shoots whoever answers. He then
has dinner at a nearby restaurant and, as an after-dinner
overture, shoots the other diners.
What's ultimately more frightening, though, than acts of
random senseless violence such as this are acts of random
senseless kindness. These acts occur with alarming fre-

quency around Christmas, and you should take the proper precautions.
For instance, my boss works for the U.S. Geological Survey. He studies the age
of coastal faults by analyzing proteins in fossilized shells. Ergo, he needs a steady
supply of fossil shells. Ergo, he scours the California coast often for new material.
Some collection sites are windswept beaches, pleasantly warm. The kind of
place where, after knocking a few shells out of the cliff, you say, "What the hell,"
lay down on the beach and tan.
Long Beach is not one of those sites.
Long Beach is the port of Los Angeles, and, like all good ports, has a large con
centration of industry and crime.
With this in mind, my boss was picking shells out of the side of a beach cliff late
one December evening.
As he reached for a sample bag, he noticed feet, four of them, clad in what in
polite company are known as steel-tipped dungkickers.
Their owners turned out to be two very grim-looking, very large Latino men.
They stared at him and his bags full of shells and his equipment for a while, and
he, for the lack of any decisive action, stared back.
"Hey man, what're you doing," said one of them.
My boss explained about shell collecting for his project.
"They pay you to do that?" asked the other incredulously. "Shoot, if that's all,
we know some places you'd like." With that, they led him to another part of the
beach. They presented him with one of the best fossil localities on the coast.
They offered to help him pry some shells out of the cliff face while he
catalogued, and, after they were done, the two amateur paleontologists stepped
into their Impala, waved goodbye and left him dumbfounded.
Truly, a wonder of science.
