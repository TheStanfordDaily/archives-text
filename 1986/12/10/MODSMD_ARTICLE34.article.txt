# The 						conundrum of eggnog
## 
### 
Eggnog is mysterious. Surprisingly,
not many people know much about it;
even curiouser, a lot who do, don't like
it. I've always believed that if more
people knew the story of eggnog it
would be a lot more popular.
Most people think nog is made of
milk, cream, sugar and eggs. This isn't
true. Though these ingredients are
listed on the side of most eggnog car
tons, don't believe it for a minute —
it's all a big hoax.
Eggnog is really produced on a
small family-owned farm in upstate
Vermont. You've heard of Holstein
cows? Well, nog cows are infinitely
more rare, and much more valuable.
In fact, there are only three known nog
cows in the United States — and all of
them are owned by the same family in
Vermont.
This family has a nog monopoly.
Their cows produce the stuff 365 days
a year, and the greedy owners store
all the nog up and flood the market
with it at the holiday season. This ex

plains why nog is only available from
November to January — these people
are just waiting for us to go nog-crazy
all year, and they've got their timing
down pat.
I went up to this nog farm once. I
just wanted to look at the nog cows,
maybe scoop up a few blades of nog
grass and plant them in my back yard.
No such luck. The place was crawling
with security guards, and as soon as I
got within 100 yards of the place, they
were all over me. I had to settle for a
visit to the gift shop in town, the one
place in the world where they sell nog
year round.
Nobody's ever been able to figure
out what it is about these cows that
makes them give eggnog instead of
milk. Some people think it's the grass
they eat; this theory might have been
proved by a courageous New
Hampshire farmer who snuck on to
the grounds in June of '72. But nobody
knows, because that old farmer was
never heard from again. Some say he

still walks
through the
fields every
New Year's
Eve, drink
ing eggnog
and singing
"Auld Lang
Syne."

And then there's the historical ap
proach. Down through time, societies
in which nog was revered as a magical
elixir have consistently fared better
than nogless societies. Successful
nogacious societies include the Holy
Roman Empire, the Ming Dynasty, the
Ottoman Empire and certain parts of
New England during the Kennedy ad
ministration.
But all this academic and critical
posing detracts from the true phenom
enon — eggnog itself. Eggnog has
stood the test of time, and has survived
the changing tastes of a number of
cultures. It has endured.
