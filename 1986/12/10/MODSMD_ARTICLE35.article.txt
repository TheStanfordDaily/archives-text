# Whistlestop tour on the fat train
## 
### 
During the Christmas season both
here on the Farm and at home, amid
the frenetic prancing of Jack Frost, esc
alated Walgreen shopping and biotic
Secret Santas, there exists a stable, vir
tually immovable object.
It kind of lies there, languidly,
stupidly and somewhat disgustingly,
much akin to an anesthetized sea cow
watching "Love Connection."
I'm talking about none otter (sic and
sick) than the Christmas season body
decay, an inevitable fatty force that
leaves few unmolested.
For the Stanford student, the De
cember deteriorations creep in
around the beginning of Dead Week.
Ole Saint Nick is really Mr. Coffee in
cognito.
The hallowed week of Dead Week,
in all its splendor and glory, gradually
works you over. You find yourself
doing a lot of scratching, nothing
strained, mind you, just general
scratching. You have no clothes — a
dirty, naked mess.
As the pain and uncleanliness
mounts, as you slowly begin to
resemble a bipedal hairball, a thought
occurs to you: when was the last time I
moved my body over 10 yards without
panting? You stare blankly.
Gamely promising to exercise "the

next day," you attempt some pre
conditioning by jogging to the dinner
line. "Here, I'll punch the card today,"
you tell the checker. "I'm exercising,
you see."
After your momentarily aerobic
forearm meal-card extension (a bigger
mouthful than chicken chalupa), you
crabwalk to the silverware, yodeling
"Let's Get Physical." Others glare at
first, then they recognize your brave
Christmas season workout. "Just trying
to stay trim," they surmise both ap
provingly and a bit enviously.
Tray in hand, you leap frog to the
nearest table as your left ventricle
begins to clot. You make it, barely.
Instead of physically eating your
food and wasting precious study time,

you directly apply the food to your
thighs, hips and stomach and buttocks,
ladling extra peanut broccoli casserole
upon your buttocks.
Finished, you ask someone politely
for a piggyback ride to your room.
Your dormmate, once more realizing
your bodily demise, grants your des
perate wish.
Finally, the dance of the sugarplum
bluebooks transpires. At this point, the
very thought, not to mention execu
tion, of exercise nauseates you. You
would sooner vice-grip your pinkie for
a KBr pellet (chemistry humor) than
attempt a deep-squat, let alone just
squatting.
You lie comatose in your room. Car
bohydrates, starches and fats sip egg-

nog and discuss
energy con
sumption atop
your navel. You
try to sleep but
remember that
you took a

Vivarin only a half hour ago. Wide
awake, fat and trembling, you hal
lucinate that giant piles of Play-do and
whale blubber thumbwrestle for your
hand in marriage.
To be frank, you're an unstable,
amorphous blob, who has expanded
faster than magic rocks. Peanut Brittle
can run a swifter 40-yard dash.
The fat train nevers stops during
Christmas. Peace.
