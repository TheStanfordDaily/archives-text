# The 						hit and myth of Santa
## 
### 
The world was a different place at six.
I was the same height as the neighbor's German shepherd
and showered about as often.
If gum fell in the dirt, I removed the large granules and
popped it back into my trap.
My shin sleeves did double-duty as handkerchiefs and
dinner napkins.
And, who cared if President Nixon was having trouble
with his Watergate? Did I complain on television when I
couldn't tinkle?
Simply put, things were simple and stoic
Aye, but there was a rub in my loutish existence. It came
deep in the heart of yet another harsh Massachusetts winter,
and it produced a rift between me and my mindless fanta
sies that to this day has not been fully mended.
At six, I threw fond illusions of Santa Claus over the snow
bank and faced the snow-bitten reality of the holiday season.
Sure, it was hard, and I was young. But then again, what
kind of a budding realist would I have been if I denied the
truth my three brothers had so explicitly demonstrated.
I'll never totally forgive them, nor will I ever forget my
oldest brother Ed spurring on my other brothers with his
fraternal frankness. "Hell, ruin the kid's Christmas — as
long as it's good for a laugh!" he would encourage them.
Acting in the spirit of the world's great triumvirates —
Caesar, Cassius and Marc Antony — the Father, the Son and
the Holy Ghost — or closer to home, Moe, Larry and Curly
— my brothers enacted a plan to liquidate Santa.
Their assault on my belief in the fat red one began with
jeering laughter and snide contemptuous looks at me
whenever I mentioned Big Jolly — and I don't mean Wayne
Shannon.
When this failed, they resorted to out-and-out telling me,
"Hey jerk, Santa Claus is about as far away from reality as
you are from sprouting a chest hair." I was crushed. My
chest is still as bald as a squash.
However, after a few days of weathering, I decided that
their view was slush and once again stridently supported die
aura that was Santa.
This blatant insolence would not do for my brothers. Bar-

ring all pleasant illusions, they
came after me. Billy circled right.
Lee circled left, and Ed, the
oldest, went straight for the
numbers. He arrived there first,
for I had dropped to my knees in
hopeless abandon.
My days of sanguinity had
ended. I would now be shown
the way.

With armlocks applied to various regions of my youthful
form, they dragged me down the hall into my mother's
bedroom. "Just what did these maladjusted molesters have
in mind?" I wondered.
My head was forced to the floor, and I was commanded to
open my eyes. "Holy Matriarch," I shrieked, seeing an array
of gifts neatly arranged under the bed and labeled: to Eric
— from Santa Claus.
I fell awestruck into a lifeless, unimaginative, hanging
stare. At my wits end, I said weakly, "Santa doesn't bring
every present, but he brings me some." They laughed and
walked off, disgusted with the apparent stupidity of their
sibling.
Debates fast and furious occurred over the next few days
until I was convinced I had come up with a piece of
evidence that would stifle their barbed criticism
forevermore. I had received a letter from Santa Claus, and
— talk about authenticity — the return address was the
North Pole.
I approached my brothers with rooster-like cockiness.
"Eat this, I taunted. They snatched the letter. Six
eyes scanned the envelope. Three mouths began to laugh.
"What's so funny?" I shot.
"This," they chimed, pointing at the stamp! I took a long
look, and the realizations came swiftly — no more Santa, no
more visions of sugarplumbs, no more hoofprints on the
roof.
The letter was postmarked Cleveland. The fat red one was
a fake.
