# I-Center offers Holiday House during break
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
Is there life on campus during
Christmas break?
Those students who will be staying
at Stanford after final exams can take
heart. Bechtel International Center's
Holiday House is offering a variety of
excursions and events every day of this
year's Chistmas break.
Those who wander through the I-
Center's doors can also enjoy coffee,
tea and cookies, watch television, play
games or just sit by the fire with a book
from the center's library. A Christmas
tree, decorations, music and a student
host will welcome all visitors.
"Our objective is to provide a warm
and friendly environment for students
staying on campus," said Susan Whit

tlesey, program coordinator of the I-
Center.
Starting with a tree-trimming Satur
day, Dec. 20 and ending with a trip to
Ano Nuevo Beach and State Park Mon
day, Jan. 5, a number of activities have
been planned by the I-Center or
ganizers. These include trips to San
Francisco, suppers, films and tours of
various local points of interest.
According to Whittlesey, popular
events of Holiday House in the past
have been the NASA and SLAC tours,
the trip to Ano Nuevo and the New
Year's Eve party.
Sunday suppers — sit-down dinners
prepared by students from a particular
country — are also favorite events,
during not only the holidays but also
the regular school year. Up to 50
people can attend one of the suppers,

which usually sell out, Whittlesey said.
In the past, Holiday House has
served about 300 students, she said. Of
those 300, about two-thirds have been
foreign, and one-third, American. Whit
tlesey said she expected even more
people to participate this year, since
Christmas break is shorter than usual.
According to Whittlesey, the
program has had a better response in
each of the four years she has been
here. The I-Center started Holiday
House about five years ago, she said.
Whittlesey said she feels that new
students, who are overwhelmed by the
work load during the regular year
become involved with the center
through Holiday House.
"During the year you know (the cen
ter) is there, and if you have time, you
go over, but they keep us busy here

academically," said Awetu Simesso, a
graduate student host from Ethiopia.
Holidays enable students to enjoy the
service of the I-Center more."
However, according to Marianne
Pripps-Huertas, a graduate student
from Puerto Rico who coordinated
Holiday House last year, "The regulars
who come here most of the time do
not generally participate (in Holiday
House).
"People who would not undertake
(excursions) on their own feel
protected in a group," she added.
Holiday House has not been without
problems, however, according to both
Whittlesey and Pripps-Huertas. Trans
portation always limits the number of
people who can go on trips, they said.
"Most people want to go precisely
because they don't have cars. A lot of

people do not want to drive even if
they have their own transportation,"
Pripps-Huertas explained.
"We need some good soul to donate
a van or bus," she said.
Another problem, said Pripps-
Huertas, is the difficulty of getting
people to pay on time for some of the
trips that Holiday House coordinates.
People deciding to go at the last min
ute is another common dilemma.
The participation of American stu
dents in I-Center programs is some
thing Whittlesey said she encourages.
"American students are international
students, they just happen to be in
their own country," she explained.
Pripps-Huertas said she would like
to expand trips offered to students
through Holiday House to include
places especially important in Califor

nia history, such as the missions.
"It is important for people who are
one day going to leave here (to see
these places)," she said, adding that
such excursions would be fun as well
as educational.
Overall, the I-Center and Holiday
House in particular "provide a very ne
cessary service to foreign students,"
said Simesso. "It's a home-type place
when you don't go anywhere as a
foreign student, a family of sorts."
During Simesso's first year here,
when he did not know many people
and his mobility was limited, Holiday
House provided activities for his little
brother and him during Christmas. He
signed up for dinner and caroling.
"We're like Denny's — we're open
365 days of the year," Pripps-Huertas
said.

House in particular "provide a very ne
cessary service to foreign students,"
said Simesso. "It's a home-type place
when you don't go anywhere as a
foreign student, a family of sorts."
During Simesso's first year here,
when he did not know many people
and his mobility was limited, Holiday
House provided activities for his little
brother and him during Christmas. He
signed up for dinner and caroling.
"We're like Denny's — we're open
365 days of the year," Pripps-Huertas
said.
Is there life on campus during
Christmas break?
Those students who will be staying
at Stanford after final exams can take
heart. Bechtel International Center's
Holiday House is offering a variety of
excursions and events every day of this
year's Chistmas break.
Those who wander through the I-
Center's doors can also enjoy coffee,
tea and cookies, watch television, play
games or just sit by the fire with a book
from the center's library. A Christmas
tree, decorations, music and a student
host will welcome all visitors.
"Our objective is to provide a warm
and friendly environment for students
staying on campus," said Susan Whit

tlesey, program coordinator of the I-
Center.
Starting with a tree-trimming Satur
day, Dec. 20 and ending with a trip to
Ano Nuevo Beach and State Park Mon
day, Jan. 5, a number of activities have
been planned by the I-Center or
ganizers. These include trips to San
Francisco, suppers, films and tours of
various local points of interest.
According to Whittlesey, popular
events of Holiday House in the past
have been the NASA and SLAC tours,
the trip to Ano Nuevo and the New
Year's Eve party.
Sunday suppers — sit-down dinners
prepared by students from a particular
country — are also favorite events,
during not only the holidays but also
the regular school year. Up to 50
people can attend one of the suppers,

which usually sell out, Whittlesey said.
In the past, Holiday House has
served about 300 students, she said. Of
those 300, about two-thirds have been
foreign, and one-third, American. Whit
tlesey said she expected even more
people to participate this year, since
Christmas break is shorter than usual.
According to Whittlesey, the
program has had a better response in
each of the four years she has been
here. The I-Center started Holiday
House about five years ago, she said.
Whittlesey said she feels that new
students, who are overwhelmed by the
work load during the regular year
become involved with the center
through Holiday House.
"During the year you know (the cen
ter) is there, and if you have time, you
go over, but they keep us busy here

academically," said Awetu Simesso, a
graduate student host from Ethiopia.
Holidays enable students to enjoy the
service of the I-Center more."
However, according to Marianne
Pripps-Huertas, a graduate student
from Puerto Rico who coordinated
Holiday House last year, "The regulars
who come here most of the time do
not generally participate (in Holiday
House).
"People who would not undertake
(excursions) on their own feel
protected in a group," she added.
Holiday House has not been without
problems, however, according to both
Whittlesey and Pripps-Huertas. Trans
portation always limits the number of
people who can go on trips, they said.
"Most people want to go precisely
because they don't have cars. A lot of

people do not want to drive even if
they have their own transportation,"
Pripps-Huertas explained.
"We need some good soul to donate
a van or bus," she said.
Another problem, said Pripps-
Huertas, is the difficulty of getting
people to pay on time for some of the
trips that Holiday House coordinates.
People deciding to go at the last min
ute is another common dilemma.
The participation of American stu
dents in I-Center programs is some
thing Whittlesey said she encourages.
"American students are international
students, they just happen to be in
their own country," she explained.
Pripps-Huertas said she would like
to expand trips offered to students
through Holiday House to include
places especially important in Califor

nia history, such as the missions.
"It is important for people who are
one day going to leave here (to see
these places)," she said, adding that
such excursions would be fun as well
as educational.
Overall, the I-Center and Holiday
House in particular "provide a very ne
cessary service to foreign students,"
said Simesso. "It's a home-type place
when you don't go anywhere as a
foreign student, a family of sorts."
During Simesso's first year here,
when he did not know many people
and his mobility was limited, Holiday
House provided activities for his little
