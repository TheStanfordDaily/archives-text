### CHRISTOPHER SAIGAL 
A Stanford class for beginning scuba divers received an
unexpected lesson Saturday when it became involved in the
rescue of a diver who was critically injured by a shark.
Frank Gallo, an experienced 27-year-old diver, was spear
fishing 150 yards from the shore of Monastery Beach near
Carmel when he was attacked by a great white shark feeding
in the same area. Gallo managed to push away from the
shark and get to the surface, where his diving companions
then placed him on an air mattress.
"We heard a call for help from the north end of the
beach," said Mike Donovan, assistant director of sailing at
Stanford. While the group used its portable radio to call the
Coast Guard, Sharon Williams-Donovan, head of Stanford's
scuba program, and Tony Valerio, a volunteer assistant with
the class who is also a paramedic, left the class to help Gallo.
Valerio stayed with the mauled diver until he was put in an
ambulance.
"Tony pumped him with two liters of saline because his
blood pressure had dropped, and his heartbeat was fast,"
said Donovan. Gallo suffered a punctured lung and injuries
to his rib cage, right shoulder, jaw and neck. One of the
neck wounds was one centimeter away from a major artery,
according to Donovan. Gallo was taken in critical condition

to Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, where
he was in surgery for about three hours.
Donovan, who recently spoke to Gallo in the hospital,
said he is "chipper, although he is sore and has a lot of
healing to do."
The incidence of shark attacks is as rare as "lightning
striking a person," according to Donovan. He said the attack
was unusual because "the person was submerged, rather
than on the surface, and because it happened in a kelp bed.
Attacks rarely occur near kelp." In addition, "Man is not the
preferred diet of the great white," according to Donovan.
Donovan emphasized that shark attacks are rare, noting
that there have been only three attacks, including Gallo's,
since 1952 in the greater Monterey area.
The beginning scuba class held when the attack occured
was about to make its qualifying dives when the incident oc
curred. Donovan praised the group for its "cool
headedness" and said everyone did what they were
supposed to do in the case of a diving accident.
Donovan said of the group's reaction, "First there was the
concern and emotional feeling, then we regrouped, had
lunch, got updated on on Frank s condition ... and went
from emotional feelings to intellectually discussing the at
tack."
