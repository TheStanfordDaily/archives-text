# Fire damages Hurlburt

### DIANE BISGEIER Staff writer 
A fire at Hurlburt House yesterday
caused an estimated 15,000 to $10,000
in damage and forced the Palo Alto
Fire Department temporarily to close a
section of Mayfield Avenue.
The fire was traced to an electric
blanket that had been left on in a
second-floor room, resulting in a fire
that set off the sprinkler system at 11:17
a.m.
"Fortunately we have a sprinkling
systemed building, and the fire was
confined to one room," said Stanford
Fire Marshal Raymond Gamma. "The
only items lost were the carpeting and
the bed with some items, such as cur
ling irons, underneath it. The
sprinklers kept the fire down," said
Gamma.
Sophomore Steve Sutherland, who
was in the room next door when the
fire started, said he "started smelling
something funny. Sprinklers were
going when 1 checked the room."
Sutherland said the sprinkler-water
dripping from the top of the door was
black. "There was a lot of smoke."
Stanford Police Officer Chris Lefferts
said, "Apparently when a mattress
burns it causes quite a lot of smoke.
The smell of smoke Is hard to get out,
so it's difficult to estimate the damage
due to smoke," he added. The mattress

Palo Alto firemen responded yesterday to a fire in Hurlburt House. No one
was injured in the fire — caused by an electric blanket that was left on in one
of the rooms in the house — but the incident caused an estimated $5,000 to
$10,000 in damages.
was thrown out of a window by
firefighters.
After inspection of the electric
blanket, firefighters determined that it
had been left on and had a short in
its wiring. Most of the damage costs
will be in repainting, recarpeting and
making electrical repairs, said Gamma,
adding that smoke probably caused
more damage than the fire.
Richard Daniels, facilities adminis

trator for Housing and Food Services,
explained that the Row facilities office
will coordinate and have responsibility
for the restoration after the cause is
confirmed by the fire marshal.
Residential Adviser Annie Jenney
arrived after the fire had been extin
guished. "All I was concerned about
was the safety of the kids," she said. "I
was thankful that it happened during
the day when no one was there." Jen
ney added that the two occupants of
the room, sophomores Jeanne Ander
son and Pia Keagey, will temporarily
have to stay in the piano room until the
damages are repaired.
