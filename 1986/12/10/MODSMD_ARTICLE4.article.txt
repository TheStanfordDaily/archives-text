A fire at Hurlburt House yesterday
caused an estimated 15,000 to $10,000
in damage and forced the Palo Alto
Fire Department temporarily to close a
section of Mayfield Avenue.
The fire was traced to an electric
blanket that had been left on in a
second-floor room, resulting in a fire
that set off the sprinkler system at 11:17
a.m.
"Fortunately we have a sprinkling
systemed building, and the fire was
confined to one room," said Stanford
Fire Marshal Raymond Gamma. "The
only items lost were the carpeting and
the bed with some items, such as cur
ling irons, underneath it. The
sprinklers kept the fire down," said
Gamma.
Sophomore Steve Sutherland, who
was in the room next door when the
fire started, said he "started smelling
something funny. Sprinklers were
going when 1 checked the room."
Sutherland said the sprinkler-water
dripping from the top of the door was
black. "There was a lot of smoke."
Stanford Police Officer Chris Lefferts
said, "Apparently when a mattress
burns it causes quite a lot of smoke.
The smell of smoke Is hard to get out,
so it's difficult to estimate the damage
due to smoke," he added. The mattress
