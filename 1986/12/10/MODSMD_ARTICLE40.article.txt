# Stanford salary and tuition rates to outpace inflation
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Stanford salaries next year will increase one percent
more than inflation, which is projected at 3 5 percent for
1987-88, according to a University long-range financial
forecast that also projects tuition rates at 2 percent above
inflation.
"Next year, we'll be in pretty good shape," Provost
James Rosse told the Faculty Senate last Thursday.
Over the last 15 years, Stanford has had the highest
rate of increase in faculty salaries among comparable in
stitutions nationally, averaging about one percent an
nually above inflation, Rosse said last week.
"We hope to continue that, and push for more if at all
possible," he said.
Past studies have shown salaries and wages to account
for nearly three-fourths of the University's costs, accord
ing to University News Director Bob Beyers.
Rosse emphasized that the tuition rate estimate at 2
percent over inflation is tentative: "This is only an as
sumption, not a prediction."

The tuition projection will be examined "quite in
tensively" over the next couple of months until a deci
sion is required in February, he said.
In forecasting the inflation rate, the University con
sulted its own academic economists and outside experts,
and this year's predictions produced "an unusual degree
of uniformity of views" on a 3 5 percent inflation rate in
1987-88, he said.
The financial forecast estimates inflation increasing to
4 percent and 4.5 percent in subsequent years after 1987-
88.
In his presentation of the forecast to the senate, Rosse
said the University is currently in the middle of a two
year effort to redesign and decentralize its budget
process.
According to Rosse, academic programs may get
started "on a shoestring, without the string itself being
entirely in view."
Academic and administrative computing, the major
source of University expenditure in the last two years,
will need "a significant injection of funds," he said.
