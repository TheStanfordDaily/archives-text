## Cardinal takes on Tigers in Gator Bowl showdown 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Going to a bowl game can make a
football player's life a little hectic this
time of the quarter. Problems like
practice and finals in the same week,
budgeting time to study Clemson and
Clemenceau, Jacksonian Democrats
and Jacksonville, Fla.
But no one on the Cardinal is going
to complain in the least. "Coach Elway
said if you have a final or you have to
study for a final, you're excused from
practice," fullback Brian Morris said.
"He said he'll take any excuse next
week. I'm hopeful everyone's prepar
ing this week, going to the library
every night and taking advantage of the
week off."
Stanford is 8-3 and going to the
Gator Bowl Dec. 27, its first bowl game
since the 1978 Bluebonnet Bowl, to
face Atlantic Coast Conference cham
pion Clemson, a 7-2-2 team just five
years removed from the national
championship.
Clemson, though, didn't finish the
regular season impressively. If a tie is
like kissing your sister, the Tigers are
downright incestuous. They are cur
rently riding a two-game tying streak,
following a 17-17 draw with Maryland
in the conference finale Nov. 15 with a
21-21 deadlock against intrastate foe
South Carolina Nov. 22.
Clemson finished 5-1-1 in the ACC,
the loss coming to Peach Bowl-bound

North Carolina State, 27-3. The Tigers
other loss was to the other Peach Bowl
team, Virginia Tech, 20-14 in the
season opener.
The Tigers started the year by
touting tailback Kenny Flowers for the
Heisman Trophy. Flowers finished the
year as a second-stringer. Terrence
Flagler took over the tailback spot and
finished the year with 1,176 yards,
averaging 6.5 yards per carry and
scoring 10 touchdowns. Flowers didn't
have a bad year either, running for 528
yards. *
Quarterback Rod Williams hasn't
posted impressive numbers, but he
hasn't had to throw much. He is
averaging only 16 passes a game, com
pleting 48 percent for 101 yards per
game. His best game came against
Wake Forest, when he completed 13 of
18 for 193 yards.
Williams' worst game was a 2-of-10
effort for 12 yards against Virginia, but
he didn't have to be good that day.
Flagler carried 30 times for 210 yards
in that contest, and also ran for 209
yards on 22 carries against Wake For
est.
The Tigers offense, obviously, tilts
heavily to the running game. Clemson
is averaging 273 yards per game on the
ground. Wide receiver Ray Williams,
Rod Williams' favorite target and no re
lation, has caught only 19 passes as a
result.


Pacific 10 Conference Offensive Player of the Year Brad Muster (25) amassed
108 yards on the ground against Arizona in the Coca-Cola Bowl in Tokyo,
and also caught four passes for 27 yards. Quarterback Greg Ennis (10), sub
bing for John Paye in the second half, was 5 for 7 passing for 75 yards, threw
for a touchdown and ran for another.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway and staff
are doing what a college football staff
does on a week off — recruiting. As a
result, the game plan will wait until
practice begins again next week.
Offensively, the question mark for
the Cardinal is quarterback John Pave.
Calcium deposits and a slight separa
tion of his right shoulder have wor
sened all season to the point where he
had to leave the Cardinal's regular
season finale against Arizona and allow
sophomore Greg Ennis to finish up.
"It hasn't been too good," Paye said.
"It hasn't healed the way I want it to.
It's kind of frustrating. I got hit once in
the Arizona game, and the arm
tightened up. Two or three days later it
got very painful. If I had to practice
today (Monday), I couldn t. Its not
career-threatening yet, but I feel it can't
respond the way I d like. I ve been in a
panic the last month and a half. I had
minor surgery on it this summer — I
might have to have major surgery on
it."
The Clemson defense is allowing
only 104 yards per game rushing while

giving up 206 yards through the air,
making Paye's status all the more im
portant. Morris, though, doesn't see a
problem. "Arizona was a good running
defense, and we were able to run the
ball against them," he said.
The most prominent name on the
Clemson defense is that of defensive
tackle Michael Dean Perry, whose big
— make that very big — brother
William was the nose guard on Clem
son's 1981 national championship
team and has since achieved fame as
the Chicago Bears' "Refrigerator."
While the trip to Jacksonville is Stan
ford's first, Clemson has been to the
Gator Bowl four times, most recently
in 1978 against Ohio State. That game
is remembered not for the 17-15 Tiger
win, but for the punch that legendary
Buckeye Coach Woody Hayes threw at
Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman
after Bauman's game-clinching inter
ception of An Schlichter. Hayes was
fired after the incident.
The Tigers last bowl victory was
their biggest — a 22-15 triumph over
Nebraska in the 1982 Orange Bowl to
clinch the national championship. Fol
lowing a stint on probation, the Tigers
returned to bowl competition, losing
20-13 to Minnesota in the Indepen
dence Bowl last year.

Rod Williams' favorite target and no re
lation, has caught only 19 passes as a
result.


Pacific 10 Conference Offensive Player of the Year Brad Muster (25) amassed
108 yards on the ground against Arizona in the Coca-Cola Bowl in Tokyo,
and also caught four passes for 27 yards. Quarterback Greg Ennis (10), sub
bing for John Paye in the second half, was 5 for 7 passing for 75 yards, threw
for a touchdown and ran for another.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway and staff
are doing what a college football staff
does on a week off — recruiting. As a
result, the game plan will wait until
practice begins again next week.
Offensively, the question mark for
the Cardinal is quarterback John Pave.
Calcium deposits and a slight separa
tion of his right shoulder have wor
sened all season to the point where he
had to leave the Cardinal's regular
season finale against Arizona and allow
sophomore Greg Ennis to finish up.
"It hasn't been too good," Paye said.
"It hasn't healed the way I want it to.
It's kind of frustrating. I got hit once in
the Arizona game, and the arm
tightened up. Two or three days later it
got very painful. If I had to practice
today (Monday), I couldn t. Its not
career-threatening yet, but I feel it can't
respond the way I d like. I ve been in a
panic the last month and a half. I had
minor surgery on it this summer — I
might have to have major surgery on
it."
The Clemson defense is allowing
only 104 yards per game rushing while

giving up 206 yards through the air,
making Paye's status all the more im
portant. Morris, though, doesn't see a
problem. "Arizona was a good running
defense, and we were able to run the
ball against them," he said.
The most prominent name on the
Clemson defense is that of defensive
tackle Michael Dean Perry, whose big
— make that very big — brother
William was the nose guard on Clem
son's 1981 national championship
team and has since achieved fame as
the Chicago Bears' "Refrigerator."
While the trip to Jacksonville is Stan
ford's first, Clemson has been to the
Gator Bowl four times, most recently
in 1978 against Ohio State. That game
is remembered not for the 17-15 Tiger
win, but for the punch that legendary
Buckeye Coach Woody Hayes threw at
Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman
after Bauman's game-clinching inter
ception of An Schlichter. Hayes was
fired after the incident.
The Tigers last bowl victory was
their biggest — a 22-15 triumph over
Nebraska in the 1982 Orange Bowl to
clinch the national championship. Fol
lowing a stint on probation, the Tigers
returned to bowl competition, losing
20-13 to Minnesota in the Indepen
dence Bowl last year.
Going to a bowl game can make a
football player's life a little hectic this
time of the quarter. Problems like
practice and finals in the same week,
budgeting time to study Clemson and
Clemenceau, Jacksonian Democrats
and Jacksonville, Fla.
But no one on the Cardinal is going
to complain in the least. "Coach Elway
said if you have a final or you have to
study for a final, you're excused from
practice," fullback Brian Morris said.
"He said he'll take any excuse next
week. I'm hopeful everyone's prepar
ing this week, going to the library
every night and taking advantage of the
week off."
Stanford is 8-3 and going to the
Gator Bowl Dec. 27, its first bowl game
since the 1978 Bluebonnet Bowl, to
face Atlantic Coast Conference cham
pion Clemson, a 7-2-2 team just five
years removed from the national
championship.
Clemson, though, didn't finish the
regular season impressively. If a tie is
like kissing your sister, the Tigers are
downright incestuous. They are cur
rently riding a two-game tying streak,
following a 17-17 draw with Maryland
in the conference finale Nov. 15 with a
21-21 deadlock against intrastate foe
South Carolina Nov. 22.
Clemson finished 5-1-1 in the ACC,
the loss coming to Peach Bowl-bound

North Carolina State, 27-3. The Tigers
other loss was to the other Peach Bowl
team, Virginia Tech, 20-14 in the
season opener.
The Tigers started the year by
touting tailback Kenny Flowers for the
Heisman Trophy. Flowers finished the
year as a second-stringer. Terrence
Flagler took over the tailback spot and
finished the year with 1,176 yards,
averaging 6.5 yards per carry and
scoring 10 touchdowns. Flowers didn't
have a bad year either, running for 528
yards. *
Quarterback Rod Williams hasn't
posted impressive numbers, but he
hasn't had to throw much. He is
averaging only 16 passes a game, com
pleting 48 percent for 101 yards per
game. His best game came against
Wake Forest, when he completed 13 of
18 for 193 yards.
Williams' worst game was a 2-of-10
effort for 12 yards against Virginia, but
he didn't have to be good that day.
Flagler carried 30 times for 210 yards
in that contest, and also ran for 209
yards on 22 carries against Wake For
est.
The Tigers offense, obviously, tilts
heavily to the running game. Clemson

ground. Wide receiver Ray Williams,
