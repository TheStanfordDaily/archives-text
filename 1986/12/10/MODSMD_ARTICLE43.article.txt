# NCAA testing violates rights
## 
### 
Yesterday, 34 young men, mem
bers of the Stanford football team,
were told by the NCAA's official
drug testers to drop their pants, put
their hands behind their heads and
produce two urine samples for test
ing by the NCAA. The above
scenario of men attempting to hit
little jars without aiming would be
very funny, if it weren't for real.

"Someone's going to get it on the
leg,'' senior Brian Morris said Mon
day. Morris was joking about the sit
uation, but it was a bitter kind of
joking. The humor surrounding the
whole drug-testing issue reminds
me of the two months I spent study
ing this summer in Krakow, Poland.
Humor that is bitingly funny, yet
resigned to accept the dictates of a
power that one has no control over.
Comparing the NCAA to a com
munist, totalitarian government
may stretch the point. The NCAA
rule, after all, was passed by a vote
of member schools in a most demo
cratic fashion. Two things to note,

though. There were no athletes
allowed to vote on the issue. And
there will be no athletic directors

tested.
Much to Stanford's credit, the
University has refused to imple
ment its own drug testing of ath
letes, and Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said, "If something were to
happen, we would prosecute this
on behalf of the student."
Opposition to the edict has led
diver Simone LeVant to refuse to
sign the waiver allowing the NCAA
to test. While the NCAA says the pro
gram is voluntary, LeVant has not
been permitted to compete this
year for failing to do so.
"Many people disagreed with my
way of going about it," she said.
"They thought it was extreme. 1
don't want to be a pan of this."
LeVant has kept her scholarship
this year despite not being able to
compete, and as a senior needn't
worry about next year. Geiger said,
though, that should athletes in the
future refuse to sign the waiver and
be ineligible to compete, he could
not guarantee their scholarships.
"That's not an issue 1 can decide by
myself," he said. "1 think that's a
University question, not an athletic
director question."
Why is the NCAA suddenly testing
