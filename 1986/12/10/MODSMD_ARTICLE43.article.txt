# NCAA testing violates rights
## 
### 
Yesterday, 34 young men, mem
bers of the Stanford football team,
were told by the NCAA's official
drug testers to drop their pants, put
their hands behind their heads and
produce two urine samples for test
ing by the NCAA. The above
scenario of men attempting to hit
little jars without aiming would be
very funny, if it weren't for real.

"Someone's going to get it on the
leg,'' senior Brian Morris said Mon
day. Morris was joking about the sit
uation, but it was a bitter kind of
joking. The humor surrounding the
whole drug-testing issue reminds
me of the two months I spent study
ing this summer in Krakow, Poland.
Humor that is bitingly funny, yet
resigned to accept the dictates of a
power that one has no control over.
Comparing the NCAA to a com
munist, totalitarian government
may stretch the point. The NCAA
rule, after all, was passed by a vote
of member schools in a most demo
cratic fashion. Two things to note,

though. There were no athletes
allowed to vote on the issue. And
there will be no athletic directors

tested.
Much to Stanford's credit, the
University has refused to imple
ment its own drug testing of ath
letes, and Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said, "If something were to
happen, we would prosecute this
on behalf of the student."
Opposition to the edict has led
diver Simone LeVant to refuse to
sign the waiver allowing the NCAA
to test. While the NCAA says the pro
gram is voluntary, LeVant has not
been permitted to compete this
year for failing to do so.
"Many people disagreed with my
way of going about it," she said.
"They thought it was extreme. 1
don't want to be a pan of this."
LeVant has kept her scholarship
this year despite not being able to
compete, and as a senior needn't
worry about next year. Geiger said,
though, that should athletes in the
future refuse to sign the waiver and
be ineligible to compete, he could
not guarantee their scholarships.
"That's not an issue 1 can decide by
myself," he said. "1 think that's a
University question, not an athletic
director question."

for drugs like steroids, amphetamines,
marijuana and cocaine? Some would
say to preserve the integrity of compe
tition, others go so far as to claim to
help the poor, misguided soul ad
dicted to drugs. The real answer,
though, is probably neither.
Testing for steroids and am
phetamines, drugs that improve per
formance, is perhaps defensible on
fair-competition grounds. *But mari
juana and cocaine improving perfor
mance? Doubtful.
"If they have to test, I wish they'd
limit it to (steroids and am
phetamimes)," Geiger said, "not this
P.R. game with street drugs. I don't
think everyone favors drug testing for
the P.R. thing, but it's definitely pan of
it."
"The problem is it's a volatile issue,"
LeVant said. "People aren't going to see
the civil side of it, they just see the drug
side. The problem for Stanford to com
bat is it looks bad publicly to oppose
testing, like they support drug use.
That's not the case at all."
"I'm not trying to cover up for

anyone," Morris said. "I'm not condon
ing drug use or abuse."
The problem comes down to
whether athletes, because of their ex
tracurricular activity for which they
receive financial aid in many cases,
should be forced to be tested for drugs
while the rest of us aren't. Already, stu
dents receiving federal financial aid
must sign a statement that they have
registered for the draft. Students not
on financial aid do not. Women, of
course, need not register. What is to
prevent a country in an anti-drug hys
teria from requiring drug tests of
federal financial-aid recipients?
"A lot of people don't have sympathy
for us because we're on scholarship,"
Morris said. "What's to stop them from
testing students before exams? It may
seem far-fetched, but testing athletes
seemed pretty far-fetched 10 or 15
years ago. It's exactly like registration
for the draft, except they're testing us
for drugs."
Morris pointed out that with all the
NCAA's posturing about being con
cerned about improving academics,
"They're making us miss all of our
morning classes the Tuesday of Dead
Week, less than a week before finals
start." Testing was scheduled for 9:30
a.m. yesterday.

Morris' efforts to fight the testing
legally bore little fruit, but LeVant said
she will meet tomorrow with a lawyer
from the American Civil Liberties Un
ion, which is considering taking her
case.
The current sentiment in favor of
drug testing is pan of a larger senti
ment in favor of more government in
tervention in our private lives. The
Meese Commission reflects an effort to
restrict what we can read. I don't read
magazines that graphically portray vio
lence against women, but Playboy
publishes football and basketball
previews that are important to my job,
not to mention articles on drug testing
which have now become important.
Any restriction of pornography begs
the question of whose definition
should be used.
Government support of drug testing
and the NCAA's implementation of it
continues this trend of restricting indi
vidual liberties so some in our society
can feel more secure. They hope that
by these actions no one will read por
nography, no one will engage in
homosexual activity, and no one will
use illegal drugs. To quote Benjamin
Franklin: "Those who would sacrifice
liberty to achieve security deserve nei

limit it to (steroids and am
phetamimes)," Geiger said, "not this
P.R. game with street drugs. I don't
think everyone favors drug testing for
the P.R. thing, but it's definitely pan of
it."
"The problem is it's a volatile issue,"
LeVant said. "People aren't going to see
the civil side of it, they just see the drug
side. The problem for Stanford to com
bat is it looks bad publicly to oppose
testing, like they support drug use.
That's not the case at all."
"I'm not trying to cover up for

anyone," Morris said. "I'm not condon
ing drug use or abuse."
The problem comes down to
whether athletes, because of their ex
tracurricular activity for which they
receive financial aid in many cases,
should be forced to be tested for drugs
while the rest of us aren't. Already, stu
dents receiving federal financial aid
must sign a statement that they have
registered for the draft. Students not
on financial aid do not. Women, of
course, need not register. What is to
prevent a country in an anti-drug hys
teria from requiring drug tests of
federal financial-aid recipients?
"A lot of people don't have sympathy
for us because we're on scholarship,"
Morris said. "What's to stop them from
testing students before exams? It may
seem far-fetched, but testing athletes
seemed pretty far-fetched 10 or 15
years ago. It's exactly like registration
for the draft, except they're testing us
for drugs."
Morris pointed out that with all the
NCAA's posturing about being con
cerned about improving academics,
"They're making us miss all of our
morning classes the Tuesday of Dead
Week, less than a week before finals
start." Testing was scheduled for 9:30
a.m. yesterday.

Morris' efforts to fight the testing
legally bore little fruit, but LeVant said
she will meet tomorrow with a lawyer
from the American Civil Liberties Un
ion, which is considering taking her
case.
The current sentiment in favor of
drug testing is pan of a larger senti
ment in favor of more government in
tervention in our private lives. The
Meese Commission reflects an effort to
restrict what we can read. I don't read
magazines that graphically portray vio
lence against women, but Playboy
publishes football and basketball
previews that are important to my job,
not to mention articles on drug testing
which have now become important.
Any restriction of pornography begs
the question of whose definition
should be used.
Government support of drug testing
and the NCAA's implementation of it
continues this trend of restricting indi
vidual liberties so some in our society
can feel more secure. They hope that
by these actions no one will read por
nography, no one will engage in
homosexual activity, and no one will
use illegal drugs. To quote Benjamin
Franklin: "Those who would sacrifice
liberty to achieve security deserve nei
ther."
Yesterday, 34 young men, mem
bers of the Stanford football team,
were told by the NCAA's official
drug testers to drop their pants, put
their hands behind their heads and
produce two urine samples for test
ing by the NCAA. The above
scenario of men attempting to hit
little jars without aiming would be
very funny, if it weren't for real.

"Someone's going to get it on the
leg,'' senior Brian Morris said Mon
day. Morris was joking about the sit
uation, but it was a bitter kind of
joking. The humor surrounding the
whole drug-testing issue reminds
me of the two months I spent study
ing this summer in Krakow, Poland.
Humor that is bitingly funny, yet
resigned to accept the dictates of a
power that one has no control over.
Comparing the NCAA to a com
munist, totalitarian government
may stretch the point. The NCAA
rule, after all, was passed by a vote
of member schools in a most demo
cratic fashion. Two things to note,

though. There were no athletes
allowed to vote on the issue. And
there will be no athletic directors

tested.
Much to Stanford's credit, the
University has refused to imple
ment its own drug testing of ath
letes, and Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said, "If something were to
happen, we would prosecute this
on behalf of the student."
Opposition to the edict has led
diver Simone LeVant to refuse to
sign the waiver allowing the NCAA
to test. While the NCAA says the pro
gram is voluntary, LeVant has not
been permitted to compete this
year for failing to do so.
"Many people disagreed with my
way of going about it," she said.
"They thought it was extreme. 1
don't want to be a pan of this."
LeVant has kept her scholarship
this year despite not being able to
compete, and as a senior needn't
worry about next year. Geiger said,
though, that should athletes in the
future refuse to sign the waiver and
be ineligible to compete, he could
not guarantee their scholarships.
"That's not an issue 1 can decide by
myself," he said. "1 think that's a
University question, not an athletic
director question."

for drugs like steroids, amphetamines,
marijuana and cocaine? Some would
say to preserve the integrity of compe
tition, others go so far as to claim to
help the poor, misguided soul ad
