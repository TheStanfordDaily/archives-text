# Card surprises UAB in Apple
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
In this young season, the large
majority of the Bay Area college basket
ball attention has gone to either highly
regarded California or upstart Univer
sity of San Francisco. But if Stanford
continues to play the way it did in win
ning last weekend's Apple Invitational,
that situation will change in a hurry.
The Cardinal put on a basketball
clinic in Saturday's final, demolishing
Alabama-Birmingham 99-80. Friday's
76-66 victory over Columbia was just as
convincing if not as impressive. The
two wins gave Stanford its second title
in the three years the tournament has
been sponsored by Apple.
The memory of losing its own tourn
ament to Richmond last year was a
motivating factor for the Cardinal. "We
remembered watching Richmond get
the trophies last year," tournament
MVP Howard Wright said. "We didn't
want it to happen again."
Stanford's brilliant performance
against UAB had the crowd of 4,635
roaring in delight from the opening tip
until freshman Stuart Thomas fed
freshman walk-on David Morales for a
layup at the final buzzer. A 55-point
rampage in the first half put the Card
inal up by 24, and that lead was ex
tended as high as 27 midway through
the second half.
The Cardinal shot 62 percent while
holding the Blazers to 42 percent. Stan
ford dominated the high-flying UAB
front line on the boards by a 39-27
count. And the Cardinal committed just
10 turnovers despite intense defensive
pressure from the quick UAB guards.

"Fourteen players got significant
playing time and committed 10 turn
overs against full-court pressure for 40
minutes," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "That's pretty
doggone good."
Individual statistics do not always
tell the story, but in this case they come
pretty close. Just remember that all of
these numbers were recorded in the
same game.
First, the Stanford starters:
• Wright — 4 of 5 from the floor, 15
points and six rebounds. He also
played suffocating defense on UAB for
ward Larry Rembert, holding the
talented freshman to two points and
one rebound in 15 undistinguished
minutes.
• Todd Lichti — 16 points, seven
rebounds and 2 for 2 from the three
point line. He was named to the all
tournament team.
• Greg Butler — 12 points on 5 of 7
shooting, including eight of Stanford's
first 13. Another all-tournament selec
tion, Butler played a strong game after
being ejected against Columbia for hit
ting Lions' center Guido Casparis. "I
thought there might be a chance that
they would try to intimidate me," Butler
said. "Either way, I knew I'd have to
keep my cool."
• Guards Terry Taylor and Scott
Meinert — 4 for 6 from the field, nine
assists and only one turnover in a
combined 52 minutes. Of Taylor,
Montgomery said, "He doesn't have to
shoot again the rest of the season if he
runs the club like that."
The reserves weren't bad either:

Sophomore center Howard Wright was named the Apple Tournament MVP for his play this
weekend. Wright totaled 26 points in two games and led the Stanford squad with 17 rebounds,
including 11 Friday night against Columbia.
• Bryan McSweeney — 5 for 5 from
the field, 6 for 6 from the line for 16
points. In short, a perfect night.
McSweeney also pulled down four
rebounds and dished out three assists
in his 19 minutes of action. "He's a
great athlete," Montgomery said of the
6-foot-7 sophomore forward. "And this
should give him a lot of confidence."
• Eric Reveno — 4 of 6 shooting to
go with four free throws without a
miss. The 6-8 junior also had six
rebounds.
"Obviously, Mike had them ready to
play, UAB Coach Gene Bartow said.
"We were a step slow and got blown
out. It wasn't real fun."
It wasn't all that fun for Stanford in
the opening minutes against Columbia,
as the Ivy Leaguers kept the game
close. But with the score tied at 19 with
eight minutes left, Taylor hit a three
pointer to ignite a 21-5 Cardinal spurt
to end the half.
Stanford figured to have its way un
der the boards, and it did, out-rebound
ing Columbia 52-21. Wright led the
way with 11, and McSweeney and But
ler contributed seven each. "They're a
lot bigger and stronger than we are,
and they took advantage of that," Co
lumbia Coach Wayne Szoke said.
Butler was a little overzealous in
showing the Cardinal's strength. With
16:24 to play, the 6-11 junior forward
was clobbered as he powered up a

shot inside. While walking to the foul
line, Butler exchanged words with
Casparis. Casparis then made a motion
for Butler to come at him, and Butler
obliged, knocking him to the floor
with a flick jab. Butler was hit with a
technical foul and ejected.
"I know I got hit with an elbow, and
afterwards 1 got hit again," Casparis
said. "That's all I remember."
"They said something to me, and I
overreacted," Butler said. "It was one
of those things that happen in the heat
of battle. I apologize for it now."
Columbia forward Sean Couch came
into the tournament averaging 28
points per game, but got just half of
that on 6-of-17 shooting against Stan
ford. The following night, however, he
busted loose for 30 in the Lions' 89-62
blowout of Hawaii Pacific in the con
solation game, hitting 13 of 17 shots on
a variety of short jumpers and creative
drives.
The Lions' win over the Sea Warriors
was surprisingly easy, considering
Hawaii Pacific's performance the previ
ous night against UAB. The rainmaking
jumpers of guard Fred Jones led the
Sea Warriors to a 45-41 halftime lead,
Jones' 17 first-half points got the
Stanford student section into the game.
The students chanted, "Sit down,
Gene," whenever Bartow left the
bench and "Go fish," in reference to
the Sea Warriors' dolphin mascot.
Hawaii Pacific could not take advan
tage of the support, however, as UAB
blew the game open down the stretch
to record a 93-75 win. Jones was held
to eight in the second half.

"I know I got hit with an elbow, and
afterwards 1 got hit again," Casparis
said. "That's all I remember."
"They said something to me, and I
overreacted," Butler said. "It was one
of those things that happen in the heat
of battle. I apologize for it now."
Columbia forward Sean Couch came
into the tournament averaging 28
points per game, but got just half of
that on 6-of-17 shooting against Stan
ford. The following night, however, he
busted loose for 30 in the Lions' 89-62
blowout of Hawaii Pacific in the con
solation game, hitting 13 of 17 shots on
a variety of short jumpers and creative
drives.
The Lions' win over the Sea Warriors
was surprisingly easy, considering
Hawaii Pacific's performance the previ
ous night against UAB. The rainmaking
jumpers of guard Fred Jones led the
Sea Warriors to a 45-41 halftime lead,
Jones' 17 first-half points got the
Stanford student section into the game.
The students chanted, "Sit down,
Gene," whenever Bartow left the
bench and "Go fish," in reference to
the Sea Warriors' dolphin mascot.
Hawaii Pacific could not take advan
tage of the support, however, as UAB
blew the game open down the stretch
to record a 93-75 win. Jones was held
to eight in the second half.
In this young season, the large
majority of the Bay Area college basket
ball attention has gone to either highly
regarded California or upstart Univer
sity of San Francisco. But if Stanford
continues to play the way it did in win
ning last weekend's Apple Invitational,
that situation will change in a hurry.
The Cardinal put on a basketball
clinic in Saturday's final, demolishing
Alabama-Birmingham 99-80. Friday's
76-66 victory over Columbia was just as
convincing if not as impressive. The
two wins gave Stanford its second title
in the three years the tournament has
been sponsored by Apple.
The memory of losing its own tourn
ament to Richmond last year was a
motivating factor for the Cardinal. "We
remembered watching Richmond get
the trophies last year," tournament
MVP Howard Wright said. "We didn't
want it to happen again."
Stanford's brilliant performance
against UAB had the crowd of 4,635
roaring in delight from the opening tip
until freshman Stuart Thomas fed
freshman walk-on David Morales for a
layup at the final buzzer. A 55-point
rampage in the first half put the Card
inal up by 24, and that lead was ex
tended as high as 27 midway through
the second half.
The Cardinal shot 62 percent while
holding the Blazers to 42 percent. Stan
ford dominated the high-flying UAB
front line on the boards by a 39-27
count. And the Cardinal committed just
10 turnovers despite intense defensive
pressure from the quick UAB guards.

"Fourteen players got significant
playing time and committed 10 turn
overs against full-court pressure for 40
minutes," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "That's pretty
doggone good."
Individual statistics do not always
tell the story, but in this case they come
pretty close. Just remember that all of
these numbers were recorded in the
same game.
First, the Stanford starters:
• Wright — 4 of 5 from the floor, 15
points and six rebounds. He also
played suffocating defense on UAB for
ward Larry Rembert, holding the
talented freshman to two points and
one rebound in 15 undistinguished
minutes.
• Todd Lichti — 16 points, seven
rebounds and 2 for 2 from the three
point line. He was named to the all
tournament team.
• Greg Butler — 12 points on 5 of 7
shooting, including eight of Stanford's
first 13. Another all-tournament selec
tion, Butler played a strong game after
being ejected against Columbia for hit
ting Lions' center Guido Casparis. "I
thought there might be a chance that
they would try to intimidate me," Butler
said. "Either way, I knew I'd have to
keep my cool."
• Guards Terry Taylor and Scott
Meinert — 4 for 6 from the field, nine
assists and only one turnover in a
combined 52 minutes. Of Taylor,
Montgomery said, "He doesn't have to
shoot again the rest of the season if he
runs the club like that."
The reserves weren't bad either:

Sophomore center Howard Wright was named the Apple Tournament MVP for his play this
weekend. Wright totaled 26 points in two games and led the Stanford squad with 17 rebounds,
including 11 Friday night against Columbia.
• Bryan McSweeney — 5 for 5 from
the field, 6 for 6 from the line for 16
points. In short, a perfect night.
McSweeney also pulled down four
rebounds and dished out three assists
in his 19 minutes of action. "He's a
great athlete," Montgomery said of the
6-foot-7 sophomore forward. "And this
should give him a lot of confidence."
• Eric Reveno — 4 of 6 shooting to
go with four free throws without a
miss. The 6-8 junior also had six
rebounds.
"Obviously, Mike had them ready to
play, UAB Coach Gene Bartow said.
"We were a step slow and got blown
out. It wasn't real fun."
It wasn't all that fun for Stanford in
the opening minutes against Columbia,
as the Ivy Leaguers kept the game
close. But with the score tied at 19 with
eight minutes left, Taylor hit a three
pointer to ignite a 21-5 Cardinal spurt
to end the half.
Stanford figured to have its way un
der the boards, and it did, out-rebound
ing Columbia 52-21. Wright led the
way with 11, and McSweeney and But
ler contributed seven each. "They're a
lot bigger and stronger than we are,
and they took advantage of that," Co
lumbia Coach Wayne Szoke said.
Butler was a little overzealous in
showing the Cardinal's strength. With
16:24 to play, the 6-11 junior forward
was clobbered as he powered up a

shot inside. While walking to the foul
line, Butler exchanged words with
Casparis. Casparis then made a motion
for Butler to come at him, and Butler
obliged, knocking him to the floor
with a flick jab. Butler was hit with a
technical foul and ejected.
"I know I got hit with an elbow, and
afterwards 1 got hit again," Casparis
said. "That's all I remember."
"They said something to me, and I
