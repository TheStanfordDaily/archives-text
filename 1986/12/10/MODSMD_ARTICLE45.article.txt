# Near perfect first-half play
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Mike Montgomery has only coached 10 halves of basket
ball at Stanford, but in Saturday's first half against Alabama-
Birmingham, he brought the Cardinal as close if not closer
to roundball perfection than former coach Tom Davis did in
his 234 halves at the helm.
The Cardinal led the Blazers 55-31 after 20 incredible
minutes that saw Stanford shoot 67 percent from the floor,
hold IJAB to 40 percent, out-rebound the Blazers 19-9 and
commit just three turnovers. The score would have been 57-
31 if Howard Wright's spike tip at the buzzer had not been
called offensive goaltending.
And it wasn't a bunch of pushovers that Stanford left in its
wake. It wasn't Humpty Dump Tech. Or Bemidji State. Or
even Columbia. This was UAB. You know, coached by Gene
Bartow. Six straight NCAA tournament appearances. One of
the best freshman classes in the nation.
"I'd like to say we could have played better in the first
half, but I can't," Montgomery said. "The concentration level
was super. The shots were falling, but they were shots we
can make. We went inside when we could and ran when we
could. It was the best half of basketball I've seen in awhile."
If Wright wasn't dominating the defensive boards, Eric
Reveno was. If Reveno wasn't throwing in a jump-hook,
Greg Butler was. If Butler wasn't canning an open 18-footer,
Scott Meinert or Todd Lichti was. Meanwhile, Bryan
McSweeney was doing it all â€” scoring, rebounding and
playing tough defense.
"There wasn't much we could have done better," Reveno
said. "Once one guy starts playing well, it catches on."
When UAB tried a full-court zone press, Stanford beat it
by passing to its big men at half court. When the Blazers
used man-to-man pressure, guards Terry Taylor and Meinert
beat it with sure ballhandling.
Once the Cardinal had the ball in the forecourt, it per
formed major surgery on the Blazers' man-to-man defense.
Stanford moved the ball swiftly, either freeing its perimeter
shooters for wide-open jumpers; hitting Lichti underneath
as he rolled off picks inside; or pounding the ball in to the
low post to draw fouls. UAB committed 14 fouls in the half,
and Stanford shot 89 percent from the line.
