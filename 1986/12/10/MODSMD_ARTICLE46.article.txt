# Stanford moves on in NCAAs

### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. â€” For the Stanford
women's volleyball team, this
weekend was a case of some good
news and some highly unexpected
news.
The good news was that the Card
inal won its NCAA tournament first
round match at the University of
Oregon impressively, by scores of 15-
9, 15-7, 10-15, 15-4. The surprising
news is that the Cardinal does not
now have to face UCLA as expected
because the seventh-ranked Bruins
were upset Saturday night by Loyola
Marymount.
The 1-15, 9-15, 15-8, 15-12. 16-14
victory by the Lions has to be the big
gest upset of this year's tournament
as LMU has not made an appearence
in the top-20 all year and had to beat
the Bruins at UCLA. Loyola
Marymount was led by sophomore
hitter Leslie Wohlford with 16 kills,
and improved to 24-7 on the year.
UCLA finished at 31-10.
It would normally be great news
that the Cardinal does not have to
face the Bruins, a team that has made
the final four in 14 of the last 15
years. This means, however, that
Stanford must play a tough LMU team.

The Cardinal now travels to the
west regional at Brigham Young,
where it will play the Lions tomor
row. Also playing will be BYU and
Arizona State, and the two winners
will face each other on Friday for a
trip to the final four at the University
of the Pacific on December 18 and
20.
Stanford should not be given as
stern a test by the Lions as UCLA
would have provided, but it cannot
afford to look beyond LMU. "I know
almost nothing about Loyola
Man-mount," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "1 don't think they know
anything about us either," he said.
In the Cardinal's match against
Oregon, Pac-10 Player of the Year
Teresa Smith once again was the
team leader in kills, tallying 24. Nancy-
Reno and Barbra Fontana were not
far behind, however, with 21 and 20
respectively. Defensively, Laura
Olesen led the way with seven blocks
(three solo), and Wendi Rush had 18
digs, edging Fontana, who had 17.
The most telling statistics were on
Oregon's side, though. National kills
leader Teri Kramer, who broke an
Oregon record by producing 703
kills this year, was held to a .151 hit
ting rate, while Michele Krebsbach,
fourth nationally in kills, hit -.029.

Junior Teresa Smith continued her outstanding season against Oregon in
the first round of the NCAA Women's Volleyball Championships Satur
day. Smith, the Pacific 10 Conference Player of the Year, recorded 24 kills
and a .488 hitting percentage against the Ducks to lead Stanford to a
four-game victory.
