# Women's basketball splits on Eastern trip
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
The Stanford women's basketball
team tasted defeat for the first time this
season during last week's two-game
Eastern road swing. However, it
learned a basic but essential lesson
about collegiate athletics.
Success is directly proportional to
the amount of intensity a team displays
in the competitive arena.
Completely outhustled in last
Thursday's 73-65 loss to the West Vir
ginia Mountaineers, the Cardinal
responded the next evening in Pitts
burgh with some outhustling of its
own, dropping the Panthers 59-49.
An impressive Cardinal defense that
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
called "pathetic"' against the Moun
taineers, limited a potent Panther of
fense to less than 50 points.
"We showed a higher level of inten
sity than we did against West Virginia,"
VanDerveer said. "We weren't getting
outhustled to the loose balls against
Pittsburgh ."
A combination of youth and experi
ence led the defensive rejuvenation
against the Panthers.
Senior guard Erica Mueser, as she
has done the entire season, was a stal

wart on defense, while 6-foot freshman
Katv Steding, filling in once again for
the injured Evon Asforis, pulled down
a season-high 14 rebounds.
VanDerveer said she still believes
that the Cardinal has a way to go before
it reaches the high level of overall play
and consistent intensity needed to
remain successful throughout the
season.
The sudden rash of injuries certainly
hasn't helped.
Asforis, who sprained a knee against
UNLV over a week ago, remains doubt
ful for this Saturday's game against San
Jose State.
"I think the loss of Evon hurt us a
lot," VanDerveer said after Stanford's
loss to West Virginia. "She plays hard
and with a lot of the enthusiasm and in
tensity we need."
Senior Sue Sebolt is still nursing a
sore back muscle sustained during the
same tournament that claimed Asforis.
A disappointing injury claimed yet
another starter in last week's action as
freshman phenom Jennifer Azzi dis
located a finger during the first five
minutes of the Pittsburgh game. Van-
Derveer believes her gifted point
guard will be out for at least two
weeks.
