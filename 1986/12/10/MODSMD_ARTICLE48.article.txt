# Landis: minor leagues to special teams
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The dream to play professional ball
and then return to school and graduate
from Stanford with a master's degree is
imagined by few. Senior Craig Landis
not only dared to imagine but is now
reaching that goal.
After five years of minor league
baseball play and making it one step
away from the majors, Landis ended
his professional baseball career and
pursued an academic path with the
hope of graduating this June with a co
terminal major in economics and food

research.
More surprisingly, Landis, 6-feet-2
and 200-pounds, is a starting special
teams member for the Stanford foot
ball team. At the age of 27, he is the
oldest member of the squad.
Landis halted his baseball career as
a right fielder in 1983, when he was of
fered admission to Stanford. "1 didn't
like my situation at the end of my pre
vious (baseball) season. I took some
classes at Santa Barbara City College
during my 1982-83 season and really
enjoyed the classes I took," said Landis,
who at the time was playing in the At
lanta Braves organization, making it all

the way to the Richmond AAA farm
club.
Landis' father, "Jungle" Jim Landis,
did make it to the major leagues,
playing several seasons as an outfielder
for the Chicago White Sox, but the
younger Landis had other goals.
"I was thinking 1 wanted to go back
to school — and Stanford was rny first
choice. It has the best academics,"
Landis said.
Although he graduated from Vintage
High School in Napa with a 3 8 GPA,
Landis felt academically unsure. "I had
some doubts about competing at Stan
ford. I didn't know what level it was.

And I didn't want to only play football;
academics was the reason why 1 was
coming back," he said.
This last football season for Landis
has been his most rewarding. "I
thought 1 played fairly well this year. 1
played really well the first seven or
eight games," said Landis, who has
made eight tackles this season. He then
pulled a calf muscle which hampered
his play. "I've had to play at about 70
percent. Now my performance is OK,
but I'll be ready for the bowl game," he
said.

Senior special teams member and defensive back Craig Landis spent five
years in the minor leagues before joining the Stanford football team in 1983
as a 23-year-old freshman. .
Landis plays on all special teams,
helping both cover and return kicks,
tackling and blocking for returner
Thomas Henley. "Playing special teams
is a little different. You can't really sim
ulate a game situation in practice. And
it's not a really prestigious position,"
said Landis, who had been an All-
America quarterback in high school.
The 1985 football season was Landis'
debut as a starting player. He was
forced to redshirt in 1983 after losing
one year of eligibility because he had
signed a letter-of-intent with UCLA
after graduation from high school.
After being named an All-America for
baseball in high school, Landis was the
No. 1 draft choice of the San Francisco
Giants for free agent selections.
After playing little football in 1984, "I
knew my professional baseball career
was over. I was ready to play football,
have fun, and go to school,'' said
Landis, who was named honorable
mention Pacific 10 Conference All-
Academic and second team Academic
All-American in 1985.
Looking ahead to the bowl game,
Landis is feeling positive. "It was a
pleasant surprise. At the beginning of
the season, I thought we'd be pretty
good. Now we've had the chance to
travel to Japan, and we'll play in the
bowl game," he said.
Landis feels good about graduating
and ending his football career. "It was

my best year — a good way to finish up
my sports career. Now I'm ready to get
out of school, start working," he said.
After working this summer for a stock
broker, Landis plans to enter the
banking or financial investment mar
ket. "I've started interviewing, but I'm
really not sure," Landis said.
"I'm really looking forward to my
next step, I'm positive. But I think I will
miss football, especially after this year.
I had forgotten how fun it can be when
you're winning. Nice things are said
about the team, we travel places, and
we get little rewards," Landis said.
The best thing, Landis observed, has
been this recognition of the team. "Jhe
players are being rewarded. We've
pulled together to win," he said. Landis
attributes this unification of the team to

experience. "VX'e worked hard in the
past, have gotten used to (Stanford
Coach Jack) Elway's techniques, and
we have some really good athletes, he
said.
This team unity was a new feeling
for Landis, who sees baseball as a very
individual sport. "In baseball the team
doesn't really matter. If you do well in
dividually, you might move up. I had to
be concerned about myself," he said.
However, football is based on the
team. "In fooball you have a job in
your own area. If everyone does his as
signment well, all falls into place,"
Landis said.
Landis is happy about his decision to
leave baseball and attend Stanford.
"For me, it worked out well. I wanted
to be in the major leagues, so I cared

more how 1 did rather than the team.
Now 1 have no aspirations to go on. 1
simply want the team to do well. Win
ning is the end," Landis said.
At first Landis found it a little
awkward switching careers at the age
of 23. "1 felt kind of on the outside. But
now I can't really feel that there is an
age gap,' he said.
Now Landis finds he has become
very close with the players on the
team. "I've really enjoyed the guys.
They are the best group — maybe lx--
cause of their dedication, maybe be
cause this is Stanford. I have a lot of
respect for them. They excel in school,
football — they are good human
beings," Landis said. "And sports have
to end sometime in your life. I couldn't
have gone to a better school."

cause this is Stanford. I have a lot of
respect for them. They excel in school,
football — they are good human
beings," Landis said. "And sports have
to end sometime in your life. I couldn't
have gone to a better school."
The dream to play professional ball
and then return to school and graduate
from Stanford with a master's degree is
imagined by few. Senior Craig Landis
not only dared to imagine but is now
reaching that goal.
After five years of minor league
baseball play and making it one step
away from the majors, Landis ended
his professional baseball career and
pursued an academic path with the
hope of graduating this June with a co
terminal major in economics and food

research.
More surprisingly, Landis, 6-feet-2
and 200-pounds, is a starting special
teams member for the Stanford foot
ball team. At the age of 27, he is the
oldest member of the squad.
Landis halted his baseball career as
a right fielder in 1983, when he was of
fered admission to Stanford. "1 didn't
like my situation at the end of my pre
vious (baseball) season. I took some
classes at Santa Barbara City College
during my 1982-83 season and really
enjoyed the classes I took," said Landis,
who at the time was playing in the At
lanta Braves organization, making it all

the way to the Richmond AAA farm
club.
Landis' father, "Jungle" Jim Landis,
did make it to the major leagues,
playing several seasons as an outfielder
for the Chicago White Sox, but the
younger Landis had other goals.
"I was thinking 1 wanted to go back
to school — and Stanford was rny first
choice. It has the best academics,"
Landis said.
Although he graduated from Vintage
High School in Napa with a 3 8 GPA,
Landis felt academically unsure. "I had
some doubts about competing at Stan
ford. I didn't know what level it was.

And I didn't want to only play football;
academics was the reason why 1 was
coming back," he said.
This last football season for Landis
has been his most rewarding. "I
thought 1 played fairly well this year. 1
played really well the first seven or
eight games," said Landis, who has
made eight tackles this season. He then
pulled a calf muscle which hampered
his play. "I've had to play at about 70
percent. Now my performance is OK,
but I'll be ready for the bowl game," he
said.

Senior special teams member and defensive back Craig Landis spent five
years in the minor leagues before joining the Stanford football team in 1983
as a 23-year-old freshman. .
Landis plays on all special teams,
helping both cover and return kicks,
tackling and blocking for returner
Thomas Henley. "Playing special teams
is a little different. You can't really sim
ulate a game situation in practice. And
it's not a really prestigious position,"
said Landis, who had been an All-
America quarterback in high school.
The 1985 football season was Landis'
debut as a starting player. He was
forced to redshirt in 1983 after losing
one year of eligibility because he had
signed a letter-of-intent with UCLA
after graduation from high school.
After being named an All-America for
baseball in high school, Landis was the
No. 1 draft choice of the San Francisco
Giants for free agent selections.
After playing little football in 1984, "I
knew my professional baseball career
was over. I was ready to play football,
have fun, and go to school,'' said
Landis, who was named honorable
mention Pacific 10 Conference All-
Academic and second team Academic
All-American in 1985.
Looking ahead to the bowl game,
Landis is feeling positive. "It was a
pleasant surprise. At the beginning of
the season, I thought we'd be pretty
good. Now we've had the chance to
travel to Japan, and we'll play in the
bowl game," he said.
Landis feels good about graduating
and ending his football career. "It was

my best year — a good way to finish up
my sports career. Now I'm ready to get
out of school, start working," he said.
After working this summer for a stock
broker, Landis plans to enter the
banking or financial investment mar
ket. "I've started interviewing, but I'm
really not sure," Landis said.
"I'm really looking forward to my
next step, I'm positive. But I think I will
miss football, especially after this year.
I had forgotten how fun it can be when
you're winning. Nice things are said
about the team, we travel places, and
we get little rewards," Landis said.
The best thing, Landis observed, has
been this recognition of the team. "Jhe
players are being rewarded. We've
pulled together to win," he said. Landis
attributes this unification of the team to

experience. "VX'e worked hard in the
past, have gotten used to (Stanford
Coach Jack) Elway's techniques, and
we have some really good athletes, he
said.
This team unity was a new feeling
for Landis, who sees baseball as a very
individual sport. "In baseball the team
doesn't really matter. If you do well in
dividually, you might move up. I had to
be concerned about myself," he said.
However, football is based on the
team. "In fooball you have a job in
your own area. If everyone does his as
signment well, all falls into place,"
Landis said.
Landis is happy about his decision to
leave baseball and attend Stanford.
"For me, it worked out well. I wanted
to be in the major leagues, so I cared

more how 1 did rather than the team.
Now 1 have no aspirations to go on. 1
simply want the team to do well. Win
ning is the end," Landis said.
At first Landis found it a little
awkward switching careers at the age
of 23. "1 felt kind of on the outside. But
now I can't really feel that there is an
age gap,' he said.
Now Landis finds he has become
very close with the players on the
team. "I've really enjoyed the guys.
They are the best group — maybe lx--
cause of their dedication, maybe be
cause this is Stanford. I have a lot of
respect for them. They excel in school,
football — they are good human
beings," Landis said. "And sports have
to end sometime in your life. I couldn't
have gone to a better school."
