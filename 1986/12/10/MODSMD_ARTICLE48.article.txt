# Landis: minor leagues to special teams
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The dream to play professional ball
and then return to school and graduate
from Stanford with a master's degree is
imagined by few. Senior Craig Landis
not only dared to imagine but is now
reaching that goal.
After five years of minor league
baseball play and making it one step
away from the majors, Landis ended
his professional baseball career and
pursued an academic path with the
hope of graduating this June with a co
terminal major in economics and food

research.
More surprisingly, Landis, 6-feet-2
and 200-pounds, is a starting special
teams member for the Stanford foot
ball team. At the age of 27, he is the
oldest member of the squad.
Landis halted his baseball career as
a right fielder in 1983, when he was of
fered admission to Stanford. "1 didn't
like my situation at the end of my pre
vious (baseball) season. I took some
classes at Santa Barbara City College
during my 1982-83 season and really
enjoyed the classes I took," said Landis,
who at the time was playing in the At
lanta Braves organization, making it all

the way to the Richmond AAA farm
club.
Landis' father, "Jungle" Jim Landis,
did make it to the major leagues,
playing several seasons as an outfielder
for the Chicago White Sox, but the
younger Landis had other goals.
"I was thinking 1 wanted to go back
to school â€” and Stanford was rny first
choice. It has the best academics,"
Landis said.
Although he graduated from Vintage
High School in Napa with a 3 8 GPA,
Landis felt academically unsure. "I had
some doubts about competing at Stan
ford. I didn't know what level it was.

And I didn't want to only play football;
academics was the reason why 1 was
coming back," he said.
This last football season for Landis
has been his most rewarding. "I
thought 1 played fairly well this year. 1
played really well the first seven or
eight games," said Landis, who has
made eight tackles this season. He then
pulled a calf muscle which hampered
his play. "I've had to play at about 70
percent. Now my performance is OK,
but I'll be ready for the bowl game," he
said.
