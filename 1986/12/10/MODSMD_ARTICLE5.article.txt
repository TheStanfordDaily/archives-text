# Trustees approve Green renovations

### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The University Board of Trustees
yesterday approved what will become
Green Library's biggest renovation
project since the opening of its east
wing in 1980.
The $6-7 million project is intended
to make the west wing of Green Li
brary safer in an earthquake. About
600,000 volumes will be dislocated by
the construction, which will begin in
June 1987, according to Joan Krasner,
acting director for Administrative
Services at University Libraries.
The Green Library central collection
contains 1.5 million volumes, exclud
ing maps, government documents and
special collections, Krasner said.
In other action, the trustees:
• Deferred divestment action on
Champion Spark Plug and USX after re
ceiving new information from both
firms.
• Gave the go-ahead to Information
Technology Systems to spend $4.75
million to replace its largest
mainframe computer.
• Received a $10 million pledge to
fund construction of a four-story bio
logical sciences building to be com
pleted in September 1989.
• Approved the design for the new
$73 9 million children's hospital.
The west wing of Green was con
structed in 1918 and contains seven
levels of books. The shelves hold
primarily older collections in the
humanities, including materials on re

ligious studies, philosophy and
librarianship, Krasner said. Also lo
cated there are some government doc
uments and some recent periodicals.
At present, there is minimal, if any,
seismic bracing provided for these
stacks, the trustees were told. Users are
safe in the areas of Green that will be
reconstructed, Krasner said. But, she
said, "users are probably not as safe in
there as in the east wing, otherwise this
project would not have been going."
As part of the project, steps will be
taken to control the temperature,
humidity and incoming sunlight in the
west wing. Environmental conditions
currently speed the decomposition of
books in the $25 million collection.
The trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR) also
postponed divestment action on Stan
ford's $1.2 million investment in USX,
formerly U.S. Steel, and its $123,000 in
vestment in Champion Spark Plug.
The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR), an advisory group of
students, faculty and administrators,
recommended divestment from USX
recently.
In a report to the trustees, the SCIR
said it was encouraged by a Nov. 25
commitment from USX to use
every means available to bring its
South African affiliates into clear com
pliance with the standards expected of
American corporations there.
The SCIR asked the company to
bring its partners into full compliance
