# Trustees approve Green renovations
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The University Board of Trustees
yesterday approved what will become
Green Library's biggest renovation
project since the opening of its east
wing in 1980.
The $6-7 million project is intended
to make the west wing of Green Li
brary safer in an earthquake. About
600,000 volumes will be dislocated by
the construction, which will begin in
June 1987, according to Joan Krasner,
acting director for Administrative
Services at University Libraries.
The Green Library central collection
contains 1.5 million volumes, exclud
ing maps, government documents and
special collections, Krasner said.
In other action, the trustees:
• Deferred divestment action on
Champion Spark Plug and USX after re
ceiving new information from both
firms.
• Gave the go-ahead to Information
Technology Systems to spend $4.75
million to replace its largest
mainframe computer.
• Received a $10 million pledge to
fund construction of a four-story bio
logical sciences building to be com
pleted in September 1989.
• Approved the design for the new
$73 9 million children's hospital.
The west wing of Green was con
structed in 1918 and contains seven
levels of books. The shelves hold
primarily older collections in the
humanities, including materials on re

ligious studies, philosophy and
librarianship, Krasner said. Also lo
cated there are some government doc
uments and some recent periodicals.
At present, there is minimal, if any,
seismic bracing provided for these
stacks, the trustees were told. Users are
safe in the areas of Green that will be
reconstructed, Krasner said. But, she
said, "users are probably not as safe in
there as in the east wing, otherwise this
project would not have been going."
As part of the project, steps will be
taken to control the temperature,
humidity and incoming sunlight in the
west wing. Environmental conditions
currently speed the decomposition of
books in the $25 million collection.
The trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR) also
postponed divestment action on Stan
ford's $1.2 million investment in USX,
formerly U.S. Steel, and its $123,000 in
vestment in Champion Spark Plug.
The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR), an advisory group of
students, faculty and administrators,
recommended divestment from USX
recently.
In a report to the trustees, the SCIR
said it was encouraged by a Nov. 25
commitment from USX to use
every means available to bring its
South African affiliates into clear com
pliance with the standards expected of
American corporations there.
The SCIR asked the company to
bring its partners into full compliance

or sell its South African holdings, ac
cording to University News Service. It
requested a progress report by March
31, 1987.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier said
the action "was not unreasonable.
"Part of what Stanford is trying to do
is get in touch with companies before
(divestment) action is finalized ... to
urge them to change their policies. In
both of these cases, there's hope at
least that Stanford's intervention has
made a significant difference."
In the case of Champion Spark Plug,
the SCIR asked the CIR to review a Nov.
3 recommendation that the University
divest.
Hillier, who attended the SCIR
meeting, said the trustees committee
ordered the re-evaluation because it
learned Champion had received a
rating of II in the soon-to-be-public
Sullivan Principles ratings.
A II rating means a company is
making progress in implementing the
priniciples. The six points of the Sul
livan Principles require participating
U.S. companies to follow a set of anti
discrimination and affirmative action
guidelines for their black employees.
Hillier said the CIR correctly reacted
to the new evidence. "A main reason
that we (the CIR) recommended di

vestment was that (Champion s) Sul
livan history had been dismal, he said.
The new Information Technology
Service IBM 3090 will be the largest of
ITS' four mainframe computers, ac
cording to Ron Clemens, assistant di
rector for technical services at ITS.
The computer will be used mainly
for administrative computing tasks,
Clemens said. Its primary users will be
student services offices in Old Union,
the Office of Development and the
Controller's Office, Clemens said.
The computer it replaces also
handles more electronic mail than any
of Stanford's other mainframe com
puters, Clemens said.
"If you're at Stanford, you're
touched administratively ... and much
of that goes through 3084," Clemens
said. The IBM 3084 is being replaced
because it is becoming obsolete.
Clemens said the computer will
arrive next Wednesday. "It's our
Christmas computer, and we're getting
it early. Like most complicated
Christmas presents, we're getting it
early to put it together," Clemens said.
The new biology building is the
second building scheduled for com
pletion as part of the University's $250
million redevelopment of its science
and engineering facilities.
It will be located adjacent to Herrin
Research Laboratory and Herrin Hall. It
will house 14 laboratories, three class
rooms, administrative offices and stu
dent services.

The new Information Technology
Service IBM 3090 will be the largest of
ITS' four mainframe computers, ac
cording to Ron Clemens, assistant di
rector for technical services at ITS.
The computer will be used mainly
for administrative computing tasks,
Clemens said. Its primary users will be
student services offices in Old Union,
the Office of Development and the
Controller's Office, Clemens said.
The computer it replaces also
handles more electronic mail than any
of Stanford's other mainframe com
puters, Clemens said.
"If you're at Stanford, you're
touched administratively ... and much
of that goes through 3084," Clemens
said. The IBM 3084 is being replaced
because it is becoming obsolete.
Clemens said the computer will
arrive next Wednesday. "It's our
Christmas computer, and we're getting
it early. Like most complicated
Christmas presents, we're getting it
early to put it together," Clemens said.
The new biology building is the
second building scheduled for com
pletion as part of the University's $250
million redevelopment of its science
and engineering facilities.
It will be located adjacent to Herrin
Research Laboratory and Herrin Hall. It
will house 14 laboratories, three class
rooms, administrative offices and stu
dent services.
The University Board of Trustees
yesterday approved what will become
Green Library's biggest renovation
project since the opening of its east
wing in 1980.
The $6-7 million project is intended
to make the west wing of Green Li
brary safer in an earthquake. About
600,000 volumes will be dislocated by
the construction, which will begin in
June 1987, according to Joan Krasner,
acting director for Administrative
Services at University Libraries.
The Green Library central collection
contains 1.5 million volumes, exclud
ing maps, government documents and
special collections, Krasner said.
In other action, the trustees:
• Deferred divestment action on
Champion Spark Plug and USX after re
ceiving new information from both
firms.
• Gave the go-ahead to Information
Technology Systems to spend $4.75
million to replace its largest
mainframe computer.
• Received a $10 million pledge to
fund construction of a four-story bio
logical sciences building to be com
pleted in September 1989.
• Approved the design for the new
$73 9 million children's hospital.
The west wing of Green was con
structed in 1918 and contains seven
levels of books. The shelves hold
primarily older collections in the
humanities, including materials on re

ligious studies, philosophy and
librarianship, Krasner said. Also lo
cated there are some government doc
uments and some recent periodicals.
At present, there is minimal, if any,
seismic bracing provided for these
stacks, the trustees were told. Users are
safe in the areas of Green that will be
reconstructed, Krasner said. But, she
said, "users are probably not as safe in
there as in the east wing, otherwise this
project would not have been going."
As part of the project, steps will be
taken to control the temperature,
humidity and incoming sunlight in the
west wing. Environmental conditions
currently speed the decomposition of
books in the $25 million collection.
The trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR) also
postponed divestment action on Stan
ford's $1.2 million investment in USX,
formerly U.S. Steel, and its $123,000 in
vestment in Champion Spark Plug.
The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR), an advisory group of
students, faculty and administrators,
recommended divestment from USX
recently.
In a report to the trustees, the SCIR
said it was encouraged by a Nov. 25
commitment from USX to use
every means available to bring its
South African affiliates into clear com
pliance with the standards expected of
American corporations there.
The SCIR asked the company to
bring its partners into full compliance

or sell its South African holdings, ac
cording to University News Service. It
requested a progress report by March
31, 1987.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier said
the action "was not unreasonable.
"Part of what Stanford is trying to do
is get in touch with companies before
(divestment) action is finalized ... to
urge them to change their policies. In
both of these cases, there's hope at
least that Stanford's intervention has
made a significant difference."
In the case of Champion Spark Plug,
the SCIR asked the CIR to review a Nov.
3 recommendation that the University
divest.
Hillier, who attended the SCIR
meeting, said the trustees committee
ordered the re-evaluation because it
learned Champion had received a
rating of II in the soon-to-be-public
Sullivan Principles ratings.
A II rating means a company is
making progress in implementing the
priniciples. The six points of the Sul
livan Principles require participating
U.S. companies to follow a set of anti
discrimination and affirmative action
guidelines for their black employees.
