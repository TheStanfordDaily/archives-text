## After 20 years, a 'Voyage Home' for 'Star Trek' 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
OK, the good news is that "Star Trek
IV: The Voyage Home" is better than all
the previous "Star Trek" movies. The
bad news is that the first three films
weren't so great to begin with.
However, "IV" has enough humor,
charm and appealing characters to
make it a fun and enjoyable film.
This has definitely been a banner
year for "Star Trek." The original tele
vision series celebrated its 20th an
niversary, and Paramount recently an
nounced that "Star Trek" will appear
once again as a new television series
with a new cast and will be under the
supervision of the original series'
creator, Gene Roddenberry. In addi
tion, the third movie sequel, "Star Trek
IV: The Voyage Home" has opened to
enthusiastic reviews and grossed about
$26 million in its first five days of
release.
How did a 1966 television series that
was pronounced dead after three years
come to have such enormous
popularity? It's hard to say, but all I
know is that when I was a kid, I used to
really enjoy watching the adventures of
the Enterprise crew. I'm not sure why I
enjoyed it so much, because whenever
I manage to catch an old episode
nowadays, I feel kind of silly to see that
I was once drawn in by such hokey
plots, corny dialogue and preachy
messages, but I guess these elements
were all part of the show's long-lasting
appeal.
If anything, "The Voyage Home" em
bodies some of the elements that con
tributed to the series' success, includ
ing that of focusing on human relation
ships and thrusting present-day social
issues into the context of a science
fiction story. Leonard Nimoy, who
plays the pointy-eared Mr. Spock, also
directed the film and is chiefly respon
sible for its reverence to the spirit of
the television series.
The plot of "The Voyage Home" is
the most absurd of the "Trek" movies,
but it also turns out to be the most en

tertaining. The film opens with a space
probe (which looks a lot like a glowing
soccer ball attached to a huge sausage)
approaching 23rd-century Earth, trying
to communicate by emitting strange
noises, and, as a result, wreaking havoc
with the Earth's oceans.
Admiral Kirk (William Shatner),
Spock and the rest of the crew are re
turning to earth in the Klingon ship
they commandeered in "Star Trek III"
when they become aware of the im
minent danger to Earth from the
probe. In his characteristic logical
manner, Spock deduces that the probe
is not trying to communicate with
humans but it trying to contact another
life-form on earth, namely, humpback
whales.
It turns out that humpback whales
are extinct in the 23rd-century; they've

long since been killed off. The big
problem is that the probe will destroy
the earth unless it can communicate
with these creatures. It is therefore up
to Kirk and the crew, of course, to go
back in time to find some humpback
whales and bring them back to the fu
ture, in order to save Earth.
With a running time of about two
hours, "The Voyage Home" takes a
while to take off and even longer to
end. There is simply too much old
business to resolve from the dreary
"Star Trek III," concerning Spock's
return to life, the crew's disobedience
and Kirk's court-martial. The time
spent on tying up loose ends is where
the film wanders off course from its
entertaining moments.
The film's real entertainment comes
in the middle of the picture, when Kirk

and the gang face the trials and tribula
tions of trying to kidnap a pair of
humpback whales in 20th-century San
Francisco. Now, we've all seen the
films (like "Back to the Future" and
"Peggy Sue Got Married," to name a
few) where the characters go back in
time and encounter comic difficulties
in trying to adjust to the strange era. In
"The Voyage Home," however, the
humor comes more from the charac
ters than the situations.
The strength of the "Star Trek" se
ries and movies has always been its
emphasis on character rather than spe
cial effects. "The Voyage Home" is par
ticularly successful at making the char
acters look like real people who joke
with each other, fast-talk their way out
of predicaments, and who really seem
like they've been through a lot to
gether.
After having endured the portentous
life-and-death perils of the first three
films, all the actors are looking more
relaxed and comfortable, and gener
ally look like they're having a good
time. It's fun to watch them have fun,
particularly with Shatner and Nimoy,
who play off each other like a futuristic
Hope and Crosby with Kirk acting as a
fast-talking straight man and with
Spock providing most of the humor
with his ill-fated attempts to master
20th-century profanity.
It's to the credit of Shatner and
Nimoy that their scenes together come
off so well. For once, Shatner doesn't
come across as pretentious and tight
lipped as he did in the first three films.
Here, he's more at ease and comes
across with more natural charm and
wit. Although Nimoy also directed, he
wisely doesn't let Spock dominate the
film, but when Spock does show up,
Nimoy makes those moments count.
The other members of the crew are
utilized to expert comic advantage, the
standouts of which are Dr. McCoy (De
Forest Kelley) equating 20th-century
medical techniques to those of the
Spanish Inquisition, and Chekhov
(Walter Koenig) walking the streets of
modern-day San Francisco, asking

people if they know where he can find
"nuclear wessels."
The light, comic atmosphere of the
film is unfortunately weighed down by
the heavy-handed "save the whale"
message personified by a spunky,
pretty humpback whale expert uncon
vincinglv played by Catherine Hicks.
Now, there's nothing wrong with
saving the whales, but there's no need
to go overboard with the teary-eyed
sermonizing this film delivers. On the
other hand, if there wasn't a message, I
guess it wouldn't be a "Star Trek" film,
so, as a result, we're constantly hit over
the head by Hicks' overacted tes
timonials to her affection for the
whales and by the whales' implied im

portance to the survival of the world.
Although director Nimoy seems to
be good when working with actors, his
efforts fall somewhat short of the scope
required for a big screen director. The
special effects in the film aren t that
spectacular, and the two chase scenes
in the film are clumsily directed and
lack suspense. On the positive side, he
has enough familiarity with the actors
here to bring out the best in them.
Although it didn't please me all that
much at times, "The Voyage Home' is
a sure-fire crowd pleaser. It's not a
great movie — it doesn't exactly boldly
go where no man has gone before —
but it's an entertaining one. Go see it
and enjoy yourself.
