# Two challenging plays wrap up fall season
## 
### JULIET JOHNSON 
Last week in the Nitery, the Drama
Department presented the double bill
of "Hanjo" and"The Only Jealousy of
Emer," its final plays for fall quarter.
"Hanjo," an adaptation of a Japanese
play from the Middle Ages, and"The
Only Jealousy of Emer," written by
William Yeats in the Oriental style, of
fer an interesting East-West contrast.
"Hanjo" was originally written in the
Noh style of drama, described by direc
tor Claudia Orenstein as "slow,
stylized, and ritualistic ... an experi
ence akin to that of Zen meditation."
The play was modernized by
Japanese playwright Yukio Mishima

and tells the story of a young woman
driven mad by a one-time love who
does not return. The woman, Hanako
(Lynn Koontz), now lives with Jitsuko
(Dana Leslie Goldstein), an artist who
finds Hanako beautiful in her grief.
The conflict develops when Yoshio
(Christopher Madden) returns to claim
Hanako's love. This enragesjitsuko, for
in Hanako she has the perfect work of
art and the only person she has ever
loved. However, when the two lovers
finally reunite, Hanako no longer
recognizes Yushio. She has waited for
him so long she cannot admit to her
self that her waiting is over.
Further, Yoshio is out of place in Jit
suko's art studio; he is an ordinary man

intruding upon the illusions of the two
women. He leaves, and it seems that
Hanako will continue to wait forever.
"Hanjo" has a particularly Eastern
quality. The traditional Japanese
fragility of beauty and thought, the
philosophical themes, come through
even in this 20th-century adaptation.
However, sometimes its slow-moving
grace became monotonous instead of
captivating, a fault of the playwright
more than the production.
Goldstein developed Jitsuko as an
especially intriguing character, ex
pressing an artistic passion that occa
sionally seemed to border on mad
ness. She provided an excellent foil to
Koontz, soft-spoken and serene as

Hanako. The two women worked so
well together that the intrusion of Mad
den as Yoshio appeared quite
awkward, as was certainly intended.
Madden, though, lacked the intensity
that a man in his situation would dis
play. This flaw was unfortunately mag
nified by the feeling that Yoshio was
out of place from the start.
But despite its minor weak points,
"Hanjo" was for the most part an inter
esting and enjoyable performance of a
fairly difficult play.
In"The Only Jealousy of Emer,"
Yeats achieves an alternate effect to
"Hanjo," attempting to write a tradi
tional Oriental play without his West
ern viewpoint being obvious.

A speaker (Jeff Soesbe) introduces
the drama in the manner of a Greek
chorus, having nothing to do with the
story but presenting the ideals and
conflicts present within. The play
begins with Emer (Gina Schmeling)
standing at the side of her husband
Cuchulain, who is at the brink of death
by drowning.
Eithne Inguba (Cheryce Kramer)
enters as well, the newest mistress of
the dying man. Emer persuades her to
kiss Cuchulain, as she is the one he will
most likely awake for. Eithne does this,
and the body awakens. It is not Cuc
hulain, but a water-spirit (Harry Mort)
come to bargain for Cuchulain's life.
The spirit will only release Cuchulain if
Emer will renounce his love forever.
Emer, understandably, is reluctant to
do this because she had tolerated her
husband's mistresses over the years in
the faith that he would eventually
return to her. Things become more
complex when the spirit produces the
real Cuchulain (Randy Scheiber), and
another woman, Fand of the Sidhe
(Hope McCarthy) comes to tempt him.
Only if Emer renounces Cuchulain's
love can the spirit resurrect him and
break Fand's power. Ultimately Emer
does renounce her husband's love,
and Cuchulain awakes to be comforted
by Eithne, who claims to have saved
him.
The play was at times confusing, a
condition that was exacerbated by
some uninspired performances.
Kramer, as Eithne, completely lacked
emotion as she supposedly attempted
to revive her dying lover, and was
drastically overshadowed by Schmel
ing as Emer. Soesbe's introduction and
conclusion to the play sounded too
staged, as if he didn't really care about
the characters, and the percussion in

serted at critical moments was annoy
ing rather than dramatic.
Ho|->e McCarthy (Fand) spoke well
enough, but her dancing reminded
one less of a fain - and more of a truck
driver. Her attempts to seduce Cuc
hulain weren't very believable. She
lacked the lithe, other-worldly pres
ence that a fairy should present, ad
mittedly a formidable task but not an
impossible one.
Excellent performances were turned
in, however, by Schmeling and Mort.
Schmeling presented Emer as a strong
woman torn by indecision, expertly
displaying the wife's inner turmoil.
Mort, as the water-spirit, was easily
the most powerful character in the
play. As soon as he began to speak, the
spirit's strength and determination
dominated the stage. His persuasion,
designed to affect Emer, convinced the
audience that Emer must decide to
recant her love.
An interesting aspect of "The Only
Jealousy of Emer"' was the makeup and
masks worn by the actors. Overstated
and dramatic, they enhanced the
Oriental atmosphere of the play.
But overall the play did not seem to
have as much of the Eastern feeling as
"Hanjo," mostly due to the difference
in playwrights. Yeats, it seems, did not
entirely overcome his Western back
ground in writing "Emer." His theme
was muddled in the action and conflict
that characterize much Western
writing.
These two plays contrasted and
complemented each other well, and
were unusual choices for the final pro
duction of the quarter. The Drama De
partment did well in selecting these in
teresting, artistically challenging pro
ductions, a trend that hopefully will
continue this winter.

art and the only person she has ever
loved. However, when the two lovers
finally reunite, Hanako no longer
recognizes Yushio. She has waited for
him so long she cannot admit to her
self that her waiting is over.
Further, Yoshio is out of place in Jit
suko's art studio; he is an ordinary man

intruding upon the illusions of the two
women. He leaves, and it seems that
Hanako will continue to wait forever.
"Hanjo" has a particularly Eastern
quality. The traditional Japanese
fragility of beauty and thought, the
philosophical themes, come through
even in this 20th-century adaptation.
However, sometimes its slow-moving
grace became monotonous instead of
captivating, a fault of the playwright
more than the production.
Goldstein developed Jitsuko as an
especially intriguing character, ex
pressing an artistic passion that occa
sionally seemed to border on mad
ness. She provided an excellent foil to
Koontz, soft-spoken and serene as

Hanako. The two women worked so
well together that the intrusion of Mad
den as Yoshio appeared quite
awkward, as was certainly intended.
Madden, though, lacked the intensity
that a man in his situation would dis
play. This flaw was unfortunately mag
nified by the feeling that Yoshio was
out of place from the start.
But despite its minor weak points,
"Hanjo" was for the most part an inter
esting and enjoyable performance of a
fairly difficult play.
In"The Only Jealousy of Emer,"
Yeats achieves an alternate effect to
"Hanjo," attempting to write a tradi
tional Oriental play without his West
ern viewpoint being obvious.

A speaker (Jeff Soesbe) introduces
the drama in the manner of a Greek
chorus, having nothing to do with the
story but presenting the ideals and
conflicts present within. The play
begins with Emer (Gina Schmeling)
standing at the side of her husband
Cuchulain, who is at the brink of death
by drowning.
Eithne Inguba (Cheryce Kramer)
enters as well, the newest mistress of
the dying man. Emer persuades her to
kiss Cuchulain, as she is the one he will
most likely awake for. Eithne does this,
and the body awakens. It is not Cuc
hulain, but a water-spirit (Harry Mort)
come to bargain for Cuchulain's life.
The spirit will only release Cuchulain if
Emer will renounce his love forever.
Emer, understandably, is reluctant to
do this because she had tolerated her
husband's mistresses over the years in
the faith that he would eventually
return to her. Things become more
complex when the spirit produces the
real Cuchulain (Randy Scheiber), and
another woman, Fand of the Sidhe
(Hope McCarthy) comes to tempt him.
Only if Emer renounces Cuchulain's
love can the spirit resurrect him and
break Fand's power. Ultimately Emer
does renounce her husband's love,
and Cuchulain awakes to be comforted
by Eithne, who claims to have saved
him.
The play was at times confusing, a
condition that was exacerbated by
some uninspired performances.
Kramer, as Eithne, completely lacked
emotion as she supposedly attempted
to revive her dying lover, and was
drastically overshadowed by Schmel
ing as Emer. Soesbe's introduction and
conclusion to the play sounded too
staged, as if he didn't really care about
the characters, and the percussion in

serted at critical moments was annoy
ing rather than dramatic.
Ho|->e McCarthy (Fand) spoke well
enough, but her dancing reminded
one less of a fain - and more of a truck
driver. Her attempts to seduce Cuc
hulain weren't very believable. She
lacked the lithe, other-worldly pres
ence that a fairy should present, ad
mittedly a formidable task but not an
impossible one.
Excellent performances were turned
in, however, by Schmeling and Mort.
Schmeling presented Emer as a strong
woman torn by indecision, expertly
displaying the wife's inner turmoil.
Mort, as the water-spirit, was easily
the most powerful character in the
play. As soon as he began to speak, the
spirit's strength and determination
dominated the stage. His persuasion,
designed to affect Emer, convinced the
audience that Emer must decide to
recant her love.
An interesting aspect of "The Only
Jealousy of Emer"' was the makeup and
masks worn by the actors. Overstated
and dramatic, they enhanced the
Oriental atmosphere of the play.
But overall the play did not seem to
have as much of the Eastern feeling as
"Hanjo," mostly due to the difference
in playwrights. Yeats, it seems, did not
entirely overcome his Western back
ground in writing "Emer." His theme
was muddled in the action and conflict
that characterize much Western
writing.
These two plays contrasted and
complemented each other well, and
were unusual choices for the final pro
duction of the quarter. The Drama De
partment did well in selecting these in
teresting, artistically challenging pro
ductions, a trend that hopefully will
continue this winter.
Last week in the Nitery, the Drama
Department presented the double bill
of "Hanjo" and"The Only Jealousy of
Emer," its final plays for fall quarter.
"Hanjo," an adaptation of a Japanese
play from the Middle Ages, and"The
Only Jealousy of Emer," written by
William Yeats in the Oriental style, of
fer an interesting East-West contrast.
"Hanjo" was originally written in the
Noh style of drama, described by direc
tor Claudia Orenstein as "slow,
stylized, and ritualistic ... an experi
ence akin to that of Zen meditation."
The play was modernized by
Japanese playwright Yukio Mishima

and tells the story of a young woman
driven mad by a one-time love who
does not return. The woman, Hanako
(Lynn Koontz), now lives with Jitsuko
(Dana Leslie Goldstein), an artist who
finds Hanako beautiful in her grief.
The conflict develops when Yoshio
(Christopher Madden) returns to claim
Hanako's love. This enragesjitsuko, for
