# Dance comes alive with Hubbard St.

The Hubbard Street Dance Company from Chicago dis
played its signature blend of show-stopping, high-kicking
style and balletic athleticism to an enthusiastic, responsive
audience last Tuesday evening in Memorial Auditorium.
Drawing from a variety of influences, including musical
theater, jazz and ballet, the program reflected the surprising
versatility and individuality of the dancers. It offerred an ar
ray of dance styles in its six selections, most notably in the
aerobics-infused "Line Drive," a series of steamy tangos
suggestively titled "Cobras in the Moonlight" and the
humorous grand finale "The '405."
The choreography maximized the unique qualities in
each dancer by playing on the physical and stylistic diversity
within the 15-member troupe while still maintaining a sense
of overall group cohesiveness. The dancers ranged
markedly in height, physique, training and experience
(from classical ballet to flamenco). The combination of jazz,
ballet and period dance styles, along with a uniformly high
quality of dancing and an emphasis on individual personal
ity expressed in tailor-made works marks this company as
one-of-a-kind.
The opening "Line Drive" integrated several short intro
ductory solos into an overall high-energy piece for the full
company. Almost a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the fitness
craze of the 1980s, this upbeat work humorously and grace
fully incorporated sit-ups and push-ups, emphasizing the
purely athletic dimensions of dance.
In contrast "Full Moon," set to music by Aaron Copeland,
attempted a storyline of sorts but primarily showcased the
company's ballet and moody jazz influences, interspersed
with the wit of modern dance. This popularization of con

temporary dance styles was a consistent feature of the even
ing's program.
"Cobras in the Moonlight" initially created an aura of nos
talgia and bygone Hollywood glamour through the dramatic
use of two visibly manned spotlights on an otherwise dark
and misty stage reminiscent of a '40s movie studio.
However, the piece quickly unfolded into an unmistakably
contemporary statement. The four tangos "represented a
journey toward the loss of the anima ... the feminine princi
ple," according to the program notes.
Beginning with a traditional tango in which the man led
the woman, the piece traced a transition of conflict ending
with a tango by a seemingly male couple (one of the dan
cers was actually a woman dressed as a man). Drop-dead
dancing and costumes, plus a pervasive sense of urgency,
characterized the first two tangos. The latter half of the piece
offered comic insight into the duality of male and female
aspects within the self: A shadowy third figure to the dancing
couple intrusively assumed both the male and female roles
of the tango interchangeably, causing confusion and blur
ring the identities of the established couple. With the elimi
nation of the female element in the last tango (although one
of the "men" was a woman in disguise), the transition was
complete.
Complete with top hats and canes, the final piece, "The
'405," provided a fun swing into the past. Centering on the
petite powerhouse Kitty Skillman, the piece generated an
infectious energy which the audience caught most willingly.
This fitting finale to an evening of pure entertainment
brought the house to its feet. Great music and clean techni
cal precision enhanced the appeal of a company that
thoroughly enjoyed itself onstage.
