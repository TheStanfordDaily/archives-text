# The
						few, the proud and Clint Eastwood

### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Clint Eastwood: the man, the myth, the receding
hairline. For 20 years, an international star and for 15
of those years, one of the most talented American
filmmakers as well. His latest film, "Heartbreak
Ridge," is a riot. In it Eastwood plays Sgt. Tom High
way, a tough, leather-faced old bastard of a Marine,
the worst nightmare of every young trainee come
true.
"Heartbreak Ridge" lost its official support from
the U.S. Department of Defense last week, but this is
hardly cause for concern among filmgoers. The
Defense Department was probably upset that
Eastwood didn't drop a "Top Gun" into their laps; too
bad for them. (Interestingly enough, rank-and-filers
in the Marine Corps have told the press that they see
little wrong with "Heartbreak Ridge." Evidently
Eastwood tells it like it is.)
"Heartbreak Ridge" is mostly vulgar good fun and
little else. It's not first-rate, groundbreaking
Eastwood, and so it's a bit of a letdown after 1984's
"Tightrope" and last year's "Pale Rider." But what
vulgar good fun it is. What little plot there is tends to
meander, and as a result, the film works best as a
character study.
In some ways Tom Highway fits in well with previ
ous Eastwood characters. The last individualist in a
society with no time for individualists, Eastwood on

film is "the all-American anti-hero," as one essay
memorably put it. Highway, like Dirty Harry Cal
lahan, is an anachronism, a Tyrannosaurus Rex who's
survived long enough to find himself overrun by
warm-blooded mammals.
Specifically Highway belongs to an older breed of
military man, the gung-ho soldier who values indi
vidual courage over obedience to rules. Having seen
combat in the Korean War (he was one of the few
survivors of a battle named Heartbreak Ridge), the
Dominican Republic and Vietnam, Highway is utterly
out of sorts in today's peacetime armed forces. For
get about having guts, his superiors tell him, just
obey the rules and fill out the proper forms. Plunked
down in a modern world he doesn't understand,
Highway responds in two ways, by swearing at
people or beating them up. As a result he ends up in
jail a lot. His superiors can only shake their heads
and hope to drum him out of the forces.
Eastwood is sophisticated enough to make High
way both a hero and a bit of a joke, too. Underneath
Eastwood's tight-lipped grimace lies a faint smile; he
knows not to take his character too seriously. Even
physically he seems like a caricature, all craggy
features and raspy voice, a slab of granite in fatigues.
Eastwood and writer James Carabatsos poke fun at
Highway in other ways, too. Trying to get back to
gether with his wife (Marsha Mason), he secretly
reads women's fashion magazines, grappling with ar
ticles like "The Big Commitment and You" and

"Sensitive Communication in a Relationship."
The basic training scenes, where Highway whips
his reconnaissance team into shape, form the core of
"Heartbreak Ridge." The young recruits learn that
the blustering Highway is really on their side,
protecting them from incompetent commanding offi
cers. Of the recruits, one Stitch Jones (Mario van
Peebles) is the standout. A grudging respect develops
between Jones and Highway, and there's a real inter
play between van Peebles and Eastwood, thanks to
the rude wit of their verbal sparring matches. Jones is
delighted with Highway because he can't believe
there can be someone so unhip.
"Heartbreak Ridge" does have problems. As a
whole it lacks tension, and some of the directing is
even sloppy, lacking the sharpness of earlier
Eastwood films. The subplot involving Highway and
his ex-wife never amounts to much. The movie's
climax is the 1983 invasion of Grenada, mildly excit
ing (Eastwood snaps to attention as a director here)
but of dubious veracity.
Even in its weak moments though, the film can
depend on the wicked dialogue of writer Carabatsos,
who shows a real ingenuity in coming up with
profane insults. Not many of them can be repeated
here, but one of my favorite lines came when
Eastwood rasps out, "You oughta be a poster child
for a prophylactic," to someone he dislikes. With
dialogue like that, "Heartbreak Ridge" has a lot going
for it.
