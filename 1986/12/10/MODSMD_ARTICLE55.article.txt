Bringing Up Baby (1938)
Castro, San Francisco
Katharine Hepburn (as a daffy heiress),
Gary Grant (as a paleontologist) and twin
leopards, one of which responds to a
chorus of I Can't Give You Anything But
Love, Baby,' star in this Howard Hawks
classic — everyone's favorite screwball
comedy. Some sequences are so hilarious
that you chuckle over them in private for
years, though it isn't easy to explain why to
someone who hasn't seen the movie. Dud
ley Nichols and Hagar Wilde wrote the
script, which is performed by a tip-top cast
including May Robson, Charles Ruggles,
Walter Catlett, Fritz Feld, Jonathan Hale
and Barn, Fitzgerald.
Plays Tuesday with "Holiday."

Holiday (1938)
Castro, San Francisco
Directed by George Cukor, this film
version of Philip Barry's hit comedy of the
late '20s features Can- Grant as Johnny
Case, who wants adventure, and Katharine
Hepburn as Linda Seton, the rebellious
kid sister of Johnny's stuffy fiancee (Doris
Nolan) — and it may well be the warmest
of all the comedies of this epoch. Donald
Ogden Stewart's screenplay improved on
the elegant stage dialogue, and although
one keeps wondering how Grant could
ever have chosen Doris Nolan over Hep
burn, even for an instant (it's the central
flaw of most comedies in this genre), the
rest of the acting is superlative. Lew Ayres,
as Hepburn's alcoholic brother, probably
never got to be this sensitive and touching
again, and F.dward Everett Horton and
Jean Dixon are grand as Grant's best
friends. Grant is wonderful, and as for
Hepburn, she surpasses one's greatest ex
pectations. Has any American actress ever
given a more complex and affecting comic
performance?
Plays Tuesday with Bringing Up Baby."

The Awful Truth (1937)
Castro, San Francisco
This comedy about divorce is one of the
funniest films of the Depression years,
though it isn't often revived. Cary Grant
and Irene Dunne, whose shrillness has
been toned down by the director, Leo
McCarev, play the quarrelling couple, and
Ralph Bellamy (who first appears singing
"Home on the Range" to himself) and
Cecil Cunningham play the second
fiddles. Dunne's costumes are terrific, es
pecially the hat she wears in court.(It
resembles a crushed vase.) Vina Delmar's
screenplay, based on an Arthur Richman
play, has a beautiful, symmetrical
structure.
Plays tomorrow with "Penny Serenade."

E.T.(1980)
Memorial Auditorium
Steven Spielberg's film begins where
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind"
peaked — with the descent of an alien

craft — and gets better and better from
there Like The Black Stallion," to which
screenwriter Melissa Matheson also con
tributed, F. T." offers emotional compen
sation in the form of a special, blessed
friendship to a young protagonist who has
lost a father: Elliott (Henry Thomas),
whose father has run off with his mistress,
establishes a bond with a sweetly
benevolent extra-terrestrial The domestic
scenes are extraordinary, and flawlessly
acted by Thomas, Robert MacNaughton as
his brother, Drew Barrvmore as his kid

sister and Dee Wallace as his childish
spacy mother. It's an absolutely entrancing
movie, perfectly expressing Spielberg's
unique brand of romanticism and cul
minating in one of the most strangely
moving denouements a director has ever
brought off.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.

The Shop Around the Corner (1940)
Castro, San Francisco
Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart
are adversaries who become lovers in one
of the best comedies ever made in this

country. Samson Raphaelson drew his
screenplay from a Nikolaus Laszlo play set
in a department store in Budapest, and
Ernst Lubitsch directed Stewart and Sul
lavan are superbly matched, and they
make triumphant sense out of the conflict
and development of the relationship by
resisting the temptation to sentimentalize
the characters. We can see exactly what
each of them sees in the other at the out
set — why each is infuriated and infuriat
ing Frank Morgan, as the shopkeeper
whose wife is cheating on him with one of

his clerks, gives his most touching perfor
mance; the cast also includes Joseph
Schildkraut, Sara Hatlen, Felix Bressart
and William Tracy.
Plays Monday with "The Mortal Storm."

Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year
2000 (1976)
Red Victorian, San Francisco
Too few people know this ineffably
sweet post-'6os comedy by the Swiss di
rector Alain Tanner — a unique movie
about a group of radicals whose non
conformity binds them. (The closest

equivalent in theme, if not in mood,
among American films would be John
Sayles' "Return of the Secaucus Seven ")
Miou-Miou is a cashier who undercharges
her customers; Raymond Bussieres is a
retired trainman she befriends; Jacque
Denis is an inventive history teacher; Jean-
Luc Bideau is a one-time political organi
zer who now specializes in roulette; Roger
Jenaly is a primitive painter and a gar
dener; Rufus runs a school in his green
house; Myriam Meziere is into Eastern
thought and Dominique Labourier is into
organic farming. Pan of what makes the
movie so charming is that this octet is
naturally non-conformist; the picture
validates any point of view that affirms life.
The sparkling script, which sustains an as
tonishingly high level of imagination, is by
Tanner and John Berger.
Plays tonight with "The American
Friend."

Beauty and the Beast (1946)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Jean Cocteau directs what is perhaps the
greatest of all fairy tale films. Josette Day,
appropriately, is Beauty, and Jean Marais is
her superb Beast. His castle, with live
heads in bas-relief on the walls and hands
that grow out of tables to pour wine for
his guests, is a cross between Gustave
Dore and Salvador Dali.
Plays Saturday with "Peter Pan."

Dog Day Afternoon (1975)
Telegraph, Berkeley
Al Pacino gives a great American perfor
mance as a man who robs a bank, holds
hostages against the entry of the police
and becomes a pop hero in the process.
Not many roles test an actor's range as
much as this one: The character is both
tragic and complexly funny. If you want to
know why Pacino was generally consid
ered the best young American actor in the
first half of the '70s, this is the movie to
see. Sidney Lumet, the director, is in his
element — New York comedy/drama —
and directs a fine cast (Charles Durning,
Chris Sarandon, John Cazale and others)
with a great deal of drive. Frank Pierson
wrote the script.
Plays next Thursday, Dec. 18, with
"Cruising."

Dinner at Eight (1933)
Castro, San Francisco
As a low-down married pair — a couple
of scramblers with enough money to force
their way into high society —Jean Harlow
and Wallace Beery steal this high-sheen
comedy-drama away from John Bar
rymore, Lionel Barrymore, Marie Dres
sier, Billie Burke, Lee Tracy, Edmund
Lowe, Madge Evans and Jean Hersholt.
Frances Marion and Herman J.
Mankiewicz did a stylish, professional job
of adapting a popular play by George S.
Kaufman and Edna Ferber, and George
Cukor directed it, smoothly and without

pretensions. This is a surprisingly endur
ing example of the kind of star-studded,
multi-plotted, draw ing-rixim extravaganza
MGM prided itself on being able to put
out at the rate of two or three a year
during the '30s.
Plays Sunday with "Grand Hotel."

Local Hero (1983)
UC Theatre, Berkeley
Utterly charming That clever mini
malist comic actor, Peter Riegert, plays an
oil company executive who flies to Scot
land to buy up a village so his firm can set
up a refinery on the land — and the vil
lage turns out to be almost as magical as
Brigadoon. Living in a breathtaking
landscape, under a showplace sky where
meteor showers erupt and the aurora
borealis makes guest appearances, the
citizens have established an entirely
peaceful, laissez-faire society where a very
strange mix of people co-exist har
moniously. The Scottish writer-director,
Bill Forsyth, keeps his camera at a discreet
distance, so that what happens up on
screen seems peculiarly self-contained,
and the unrushed scenes snap back at you
with a delayed comic spring. The cast is
impeccable; among its gems are Denis
Lawson, Peter Capaldi, and especially Burt
Lancaster. He's only in a few scenes, but
he embodies the quirkily benevolent
spirit of the movie.
Plays Tuesday with "Turtle Diary".

The Big Sleep (1946)
Castro, San Francisco
Raymond Chandler's slick, fast-paced
detective novel pales beside this film ver
sion, directed by Howard Hawks and
featuring dialogue by William Faulkner,
Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett. The
plot is tied in knots no one has ever
succeeded in untangling; the story goes
that when the screenwriters ran into trou
ble, they called Chandler up and he
couldn't figure the damn thing out either.
But the preposterous tortuousness of the
story is as much a part of the fun as the
double entendres between Humphrey
Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and Martha
Vickers' turn as Bacall's infantile, las
civious kid sister. Bogart's impersonation
of Chandler's private eye hero Philip
Marlowe may not have met Chandler's
standards (inexplicably, he preferred Dick
Powell in "Murder, My Sweet"), but no
one else has ever complained.

The Palm Beach Story (1942)
Telegraph, Berkeley
Claudette Colbert loves her husband,
architect Joel McCrea, but he doesn't make
enough money to support them, so, prac
tical woman that she is, she sets out to find
a millionaire willing to share his wealth
with her. Quite by chance — on a train
where the members of the Ale & Quail
Club are enjoying their drunken conven
tion — she meets the rich, eccentric, be

spectacled John D. Hackensacker 111
(played by Rudy Vallee), who courts her
while his sister (Mary Astor) chases
McCrea, who has dogged his wife's steps.
This comedy, written and directed by
Preston Sturges, is one of the funniest
movies ever made. With a trainload of
Sturges regulars: William Demarest,
Robert Warwick, Torben Meyer, Jimmy
Conlin, Vic Potel, Robert Greig, Franklin
Pangborn, Robert Dudley, Esther Howard,
Al Bridge et al.
Plavs tonight with "Sullivan's Travels."

Sullivan's Travels (1941)
Telegraph, Berkeley
Iconoclast though he was, the great
writer/director Preston Sturges was not
immune to sentimentality; it mars much of
this movie, which many critics neverthe
less consider his most important (possibly
because Joel McCrea plays a movie direc
tor in it with some Sturgesian characteris
tics). "Sullivan's Travels" isn't an easy film
to forget, however — it's one of a kind,
and some of it is genuinely moving. John
L. Sullivan, the filmmaker-hero, decides to
drop his career as a supplier of crowd
pleasers in favor of making socially con
scious dramas. In order to research his
subject — the life of the hobo — Sullivan
sets out to impersonate one. McCrea's co
star is Veronica Lake; this is the picture
that made her a star, and you'll understand
why. The Sturges repertory cast includes
William Demarest, Eric Blore, Robert War
wick, Franklin Pangborn, Porter Hall,
Robert Grieg, Torben Meyer and Jimmy
Conlin.

McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971)
York, San Francisco
Robert Altman directed the best Ameri
can film of 1970, M*A*S*H, but no one was
prepared for the poetic, allusive Western
he put out the following year — a film so
subtle and delicately textured it suggests
an American Renoir. The style is muted
restlessness, and the lighting (by Vilmos
Zsigmond) and design, rich yet subdued,
call to mind Vermeer or certain Japanese
painters. Amid the drenched greens of a
rainy frontier landscape, a handsome,
gentle-faced stranger comes to town — a
figure out of myth — and brings it to life
by opening a whorehouse. Warren Beatty
(as the whoremaster) and Julie Christie
(as the madam) give exquisite perfor
mances; the first-rate supporting cast in
cludes Rene Auberjonois, Keith Carradine,
Shelley Duvall, Hugh Millais and John
Schuck.
Plays tomorrow with "The Grey Fox."
