Senior Atul Gawande is an accomplished and in
volved student by any standard.
He is majoring in biological sciences and political
science and plans to write an honors thesis in each
field. He is a published researcher, a teaching assis
tant, a resident assistant and is politically active. Now,
Gawande can add a Rhodes Scholarship to his list of
achievements.
Gawande and 31 other students from 24 colleges
won Rhodes Scholarships and will receive fees and
living expenses for two years of study at Oxford Uni
versity. The Rhodes Scholarship Trust announced
this year's winners Saturday.
While he has been at Stanford, Gawande has been
"basically studying political theory ... the idea of

man as a part of society. Medicine is about improving
man, and the two fields do complement each other
because in a sense a better man makes a better soci

Since December 1983, Gawande has been doing
research on vision disorders under the direction of
Michael Marmor, professor of surgery. The research
will form the basis of Gawande's honor thesis in biol

According to Marmor, Gawande is "an outstanding
and unusual student who combines scholarship and
achievement in diverse fields. He's able to bring his
interest in politics to bear on the scientific issues he
works with."
Gawande is doing independent research for his
honors thesis in political science on socio-biology
and its political implications.
Gawande, a native of Athens, Ohio, is a teaching as

sistant for a professor in biological sciences and
teaches a course on "Scientific Philosophy and Bio-
Ethics." Before that, he taught two biology laboratory
classes.
Gawande is a member of Amnesty International
and takes part in the organization's urgent action net
work, a letter-writing campaign to free prisoners of
conscience. He also writes letters on behalf of the Na
tional Organization of Women, of which he is a mem
ber. In addition, he finds time to review rock albums
for The Daily and serve as a resident assistant at
Roble Hall.
Gawande will begin studying politics and
philosphy at Oxford in October.
