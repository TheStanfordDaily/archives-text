University President Donald Ken
nedy will leave his office during winter
quarter, but he won't be gallivanting
off to exotic, warm places while we
remain here in the rain.
Kennedy's two-and-a-half-month
"sabbatical" will essentially be a
working vacation in preparation for
February's announcement of the
University's Centennial fundraising
campaign and for Stanford's more dis
tant future.
"What I really want to have is a quar
ter in which 1 get a chance to do some
relaxed contemplation and thinking
about the longer-range future and
fixing of the Centennial campaign," he
said.
"Both from the point of view of
timing and my own need to change

pace, the winter quarter of this year
seemed perfect."
Kennedy, Stanford's president since
1980, decided last fall to take a leave to
work on the Centennial.
He stressed that it won't be a vaca
tion, although some of his work may
be done in vacation spots.
"It's really not a personal holiday, it's
a change of pace and change of time
constant," he said. "I will confess,
however, that I find that sometimes 1
comtemplate things better on skis than
1 do sitting around. So I would be
surprised if I didn't get a dozen days of
skiing in this winter. It would be a
record for me â€” about seven is the
most I manage in a normal year."
The Centennial that Kennedy will be
contemplating and planning for is actu
ally several events occurring in a chain
over the next five vears.

The Centennial celebration opened
in November 1985 on the 100 th an
niversary of the signing of the Univer
sity's founding grant. Next May, the
centennial of the laying of the Univer
sity's cornerstone will be celebrated,
and 1991 will mark the centennial of
the opening of the University.
In addition to the various celebra
tions, the capital campaign will be a
central component of the Centennial
years. This type of fundraising Is not
new, according to Kennedy. Since 1982
there have been plans to get "new re
sources that will support the growth
and improvement of the University,"
he said.
During his sabbatical, Kennedy will
work with a small group of staff on
planning for Stanford's future, project
