# The 						hundred-year leave

### ALYSIA ANDRIKOPOULOS 
University President Donald Ken
nedy will leave his office during winter
quarter, but he won't be gallivanting
off to exotic, warm places while we
remain here in the rain.
Kennedy's two-and-a-half-month
"sabbatical" will essentially be a
working vacation in preparation for
February's announcement of the
University's Centennial fundraising
campaign and for Stanford's more dis
tant future.
"What I really want to have is a quar
ter in which 1 get a chance to do some
relaxed contemplation and thinking
about the longer-range future and
fixing of the Centennial campaign," he
said.
"Both from the point of view of
timing and my own need to change

pace, the winter quarter of this year
seemed perfect."
Kennedy, Stanford's president since
1980, decided last fall to take a leave to
work on the Centennial.
He stressed that it won't be a vaca
tion, although some of his work may
be done in vacation spots.
"It's really not a personal holiday, it's
a change of pace and change of time
constant," he said. "I will confess,
however, that I find that sometimes 1
comtemplate things better on skis than
1 do sitting around. So I would be
surprised if I didn't get a dozen days of
skiing in this winter. It would be a
record for me — about seven is the
most I manage in a normal year."
The Centennial that Kennedy will be
contemplating and planning for is actu
ally several events occurring in a chain
over the next five vears.

The Centennial celebration opened
in November 1985 on the 100 th an
niversary of the signing of the Univer
sity's founding grant. Next May, the
centennial of the laying of the Univer
sity's cornerstone will be celebrated,
and 1991 will mark the centennial of
the opening of the University.
In addition to the various celebra
tions, the capital campaign will be a
central component of the Centennial
years. This type of fundraising Is not
new, according to Kennedy. Since 1982
there have been plans to get "new re
sources that will support the growth
and improvement of the University,"
he said.
During his sabbatical, Kennedy will
work with a small group of staff on
planning for Stanford's future, project
ing what the University might look like
in 2010 and then deciding what the
University can do now — and where it
can channel funds raised during the
Centennial — to alter that projection
for the better.
The priorities of the campaign are
already outlined, Kennedy said. "When
you establish priorities for a campaign,
you're really saying, 'What are the first
things 1 would spend a bunch of
money on if 1 just got it?' " he ex
plained. "And so we've determined the
campaign will concentrate on three
areas."
The first of these areas of concentra
tion, he said, is undergraduate educa
tion, with special attention to be paid
to financial aid, support for indepen
dent study and residential education. A
new residence is planned to eliminate
the unguaranteed year.
The second area of concentration
will be the building of a strong faculty,
especially in the humanities.
The final area of campaign concen
tration will be the proposed
redevelopment of the science on
campus into a combined science and
engineering quadrangle. The building
of such a quadrangle, Kennedy
believes, "would really permit us to do
good science in those eight depart
ments that are at the core of our excel
lence in science."

Kennedy said he will also work on
announcements for the events to come
.in the Centennial celebration. He will
prepare speeches to deliver to the
press and other interested people in
February and the months ahead.
"What I shall have to say will have to
do with Stanford's ambitions — what
kind of institution we want to be, and
what kind of priorities we've set for
this campaign in order to accomplish
those things," he explained.
While Kennedy is away, current Uni
versity Provost James Rosse will serve
as acting president.
Kennedy said Stanford students
should call Rosse "President Rosse"
during the winter quarter.
"He is really going to be the presi
dent, and he is so terrific at his job and
such a great academic leader for this
place that there's no reason for him to
be anything less than a full president,"
said Kennedy. "He's going to move
into this office, and he's going to do
the job in every way."
Kennedy calls his leave a "nice
chance for redefinition of roles" and
does not plan to "haunt" the campus
during his sabbatical. He does not even
plan to attend any Board of Trustee
meetings. He will "really uncouple,"
he said, though he added that he might
be seen running on campus or attend
ing an occasional baseball game at
Sunken Diamond.
As part of this "uncoupling," Ken
nedy said he won't use his time off to
get a different perspective on present
controversial issues on campus. He

said he has confidence that current
"hot" issues — University investment
in South Africa, the Western Culture
Program and the Reagan Library,
among others — will all continue to
receive attention under the influence
of the "very able" Rosse just as if Ken
nedy were still president.
Kennedy explained his reluctance to

dwell on current issues during his
leave.
"I'm going to try to take the longest
range view, and that's why the focus is
on 2010," he said. "I really want to try
to look at the forces that are shaping
us, both the ones that derive from the

ernment policy ... and internal ones;
then, based on our own traditions and
ambitions, decide where those
(forces) are taking us and decide what
we need to do to produce a better uni
versity in 2010, and to take advantage
of opportunities that are present now
that won't be present later.
"So, I don't plan to work on any cur
rent controversies," he said. "This is a
time in which you refuse to permit the
urgent to preempt the important focus
on the long range.''

Kennedy said he doesn't anticipate
that the University will change under
Rosse's leadership in any way that will
make it hard for him to integrate back
into the presidency upon his return in
April.
Kennedy said he regards the quarter
as an "investment in my future as presi
dent here. If anything, it's a signal of
my happiness in the job, and my wish
to prepare myself to do it better."
He said he does not know when he
will step down from the presidency.
"Certainly no time soon," he said, but
he confessed that if and when he ever
does leave Stanford he might return to
work for the federal government. He
was chairman of the Food and Drug
Administration in the Carter adminis

tration.
"I might take an appointed office in
the government somewhere — I
suppose I really mean federal; that's
where my experience is — if I thought
that there were some job that I could
do well in a finite time," he said.
"When you're my age and happily
situated and you're looking toward the
last years of your professional life, the
question that begins to ask itself is, 'Am
I going to do one more job after this
one?' And I frankly don't know the an
swer to that."
Kennedy smiled when asked if there
are any drawbacks to taking a sabbati
cal right now. "1 don't know about
them yet; I may discover some," he
said.

timing and my own need to change

pace, the winter quarter of this year
seemed perfect."
Kennedy, Stanford's president since
1980, decided last fall to take a leave to
work on the Centennial.
He stressed that it won't be a vaca
tion, although some of his work may
be done in vacation spots.
"It's really not a personal holiday, it's
a change of pace and change of time
constant," he said. "I will confess,
however, that I find that sometimes 1
comtemplate things better on skis than
1 do sitting around. So I would be
surprised if I didn't get a dozen days of
skiing in this winter. It would be a
record for me — about seven is the
most I manage in a normal year."
The Centennial that Kennedy will be
contemplating and planning for is actu
ally several events occurring in a chain
over the next five vears.

The Centennial celebration opened
in November 1985 on the 100 th an
niversary of the signing of the Univer
sity's founding grant. Next May, the
centennial of the laying of the Univer
sity's cornerstone will be celebrated,
and 1991 will mark the centennial of
the opening of the University.
In addition to the various celebra
tions, the capital campaign will be a
central component of the Centennial
years. This type of fundraising Is not
new, according to Kennedy. Since 1982
there have been plans to get "new re
sources that will support the growth
and improvement of the University,"
he said.
During his sabbatical, Kennedy will
work with a small group of staff on
planning for Stanford's future, project
ing what the University might look like
in 2010 and then deciding what the
University can do now — and where it
can channel funds raised during the
Centennial — to alter that projection
for the better.
The priorities of the campaign are
already outlined, Kennedy said. "When
you establish priorities for a campaign,
you're really saying, 'What are the first
things 1 would spend a bunch of
money on if 1 just got it?' " he ex
plained. "And so we've determined the
campaign will concentrate on three
areas."
The first of these areas of concentra
tion, he said, is undergraduate educa
tion, with special attention to be paid
to financial aid, support for indepen
dent study and residential education. A
new residence is planned to eliminate
the unguaranteed year.
The second area of concentration
will be the building of a strong faculty,
especially in the humanities.
The final area of campaign concen
tration will be the proposed
redevelopment of the science on
campus into a combined science and
engineering quadrangle. The building
of such a quadrangle, Kennedy
believes, "would really permit us to do
good science in those eight depart
ments that are at the core of our excel
lence in science."

Kennedy said he will also work on
announcements for the events to come
.in the Centennial celebration. He will
prepare speeches to deliver to the
press and other interested people in
February and the months ahead.
"What I shall have to say will have to
do with Stanford's ambitions — what
kind of institution we want to be, and
what kind of priorities we've set for
this campaign in order to accomplish
those things," he explained.
While Kennedy is away, current Uni
versity Provost James Rosse will serve
as acting president.
Kennedy said Stanford students
should call Rosse "President Rosse"
during the winter quarter.
"He is really going to be the presi
dent, and he is so terrific at his job and
such a great academic leader for this
place that there's no reason for him to
be anything less than a full president,"
said Kennedy. "He's going to move
into this office, and he's going to do
the job in every way."
Kennedy calls his leave a "nice
chance for redefinition of roles" and
does not plan to "haunt" the campus
during his sabbatical. He does not even
plan to attend any Board of Trustee
meetings. He will "really uncouple,"
he said, though he added that he might
be seen running on campus or attend
ing an occasional baseball game at
Sunken Diamond.
As part of this "uncoupling," Ken
nedy said he won't use his time off to
get a different perspective on present
controversial issues on campus. He

said he has confidence that current
"hot" issues — University investment
in South Africa, the Western Culture
Program and the Reagan Library,
among others — will all continue to
receive attention under the influence
of the "very able" Rosse just as if Ken
nedy were still president.
Kennedy explained his reluctance to

dwell on current issues during his
leave.
"I'm going to try to take the longest
range view, and that's why the focus is
on 2010," he said. "I really want to try
to look at the forces that are shaping
us, both the ones that derive from the

then, based on our own traditions and
ambitions, decide where those
(forces) are taking us and decide what
we need to do to produce a better uni
versity in 2010, and to take advantage
of opportunities that are present now
that won't be present later.
"So, I don't plan to work on any cur
rent controversies," he said. "This is a
time in which you refuse to permit the
urgent to preempt the important focus
on the long range.''

Kennedy said he doesn't anticipate
that the University will change under
Rosse's leadership in any way that will
make it hard for him to integrate back
into the presidency upon his return in
April.
Kennedy said he regards the quarter
as an "investment in my future as presi
dent here. If anything, it's a signal of
my happiness in the job, and my wish
to prepare myself to do it better."
He said he does not know when he
will step down from the presidency.
"Certainly no time soon," he said, but
he confessed that if and when he ever
does leave Stanford he might return to
work for the federal government. He
was chairman of the Food and Drug
Administration in the Carter adminis

tration.
"I might take an appointed office in
the government somewhere — I
suppose I really mean federal; that's
where my experience is — if I thought
that there were some job that I could
do well in a finite time," he said.
"When you're my age and happily
situated and you're looking toward the
last years of your professional life, the
question that begins to ask itself is, 'Am
I going to do one more job after this
one?' And I frankly don't know the an
swer to that."
Kennedy smiled when asked if there
are any drawbacks to taking a sabbati
cal right now. "1 don't know about
them yet; I may discover some," he
said.
University President Donald Ken
nedy will leave his office during winter
quarter, but he won't be gallivanting
off to exotic, warm places while we
remain here in the rain.
Kennedy's two-and-a-half-month
"sabbatical" will essentially be a
working vacation in preparation for
February's announcement of the
University's Centennial fundraising
campaign and for Stanford's more dis
tant future.
"What I really want to have is a quar
ter in which 1 get a chance to do some
relaxed contemplation and thinking
about the longer-range future and
fixing of the Centennial campaign," he
said.
