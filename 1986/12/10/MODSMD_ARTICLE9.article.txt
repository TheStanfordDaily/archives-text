Soviets warn U.S. on Nicaragua
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union warned the United States yesterday
against taking a direct military role in the Nicaraguan civil war and charged
that recent U.S. moves in Central America were "extremely serious."
The warning was issued by Boris Pyadashev, a senior Foreign Ministry of
ficial, at a news briefing. He was commenting on reports that U.S. helicop
ters transported Honduran troops to a border region where Nicaraguan
government forces had crossed the frontier in pursuit of American-backed
rebel forces.
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, cited Nicaraguan charges that U.S.
planes had bombed two Nicaraguan border towns over the weekend and
accused Washington of engaging in "international terrorism." U.S. officials
have denied any such American raid.
Pyadashev said, "We assess the situation around Nicaragua as extremely
serious. We cannot exclude the possibility that the United States will take
further risky steps."
U.S. officials, he said, are escalating tension in Central America in an at
tempt to divert attention from the political uproar over secret arms ship
ments to Iran.
"It is quite possible they will use weapons," he said. "We warn the
United States against such steps and urge it to put aside such plans and in
tentions."
Washington, he said, is "playing with fire."
Swiss to investigate U.S. fraud
WASHINGTON — The United States has formally asked Swiss authorities
for help in an investigation into possible criminal offenses involving the
use of two Swiss bank accounts that are believed to have been used to fun
nel proceeds from secret arms sales to Iran to Nicaraguan rebels, a Swiss
official said Monday.
Swiss government spokesman Achille Casanova said the formal U.S. re
quest came Monday following an informal one last week. He declined to
say what criminal offenses were cited, but other Swiss sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the request was believed to be referring to
alleged fraud.
The Washington Post, in yesterday's editions, reported that the criminal
investigation involved three Americans, who are believed to have used the
two Swiss bank accounts. The Post identified two of the three as Lt. Col.
Oliver North, a former National Security Council aide fired last month, and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, whom Secretary of State George
Shultz identified Monday as a participant in the clandestine arms sale deals.
The New York Times, in yesterday's editions, reported that the Justice
Department and congressional investigators were looking into Secord's
participation in the secret diplomacy with Iran, his efforts to funnel arms to
the Nicaraguan rebels and whether he used his diplomatic acitivities to fur
ther his private business dealings in the Middle East
SEC broadens Boesky probe
WASHINGTON — The government investigation of Wall Street
speculator Ivan Boesky is ranging beyond insider trading to focus on a
wide range of corporate takeover activities, including possible illegal col
laboration by groups of investors in takeover bids, according to sources
familiar with the probe.
The broader investigation could lead to action against stock speculators
known as arbitrageurs and other investors who might not be in jeopardy
under federal insider trading sanctions, sources said.
Investigators are examining whether wealthy investors acted together to
buy significant stakes in companies before disclosing their actions to the
public and the companies, according to the sources.
Critics of takeovers have complained that such secret collaboration by
professional traders often accelerates the takeover process by concentrat
ing a major bloc of a company's stock in the hands of a relatively few
traders and investors before the market is aware of their actions. When the
investors do disclose their purchases, the stock price typically soars, creat
ing windfall profits if the company is sold, or if the company buys back the
stock at higher prices.
SEC rules require public disclosure of large stock purchases to alert
companies and investors to major investment moves. A deliberate violation
of the rules could lead to criminal charges, attorneys said.
Soviet dissident dies in prison
MOSCOW — Anatoly Marchenko, a prominent Soviet human rights ac
tivist who recently was pressured by the KGB to emigrate to Israel, has died
in prison at the age of 48, a friend said yesterday.
Marchenko's wife, Larisa Bogoraz, was informed of the death in a
telegram that arrived at noon yesterday.
The dissident, who spent 20 years in prison and internal exile, was a
member of the disbanded Helsinki Watch Group that tried to monitor So
viet compliance with the 1975 accord on human rights. He also wrote the
harrowing dissident chronicle "My Testimony" about his labor camp expe
riences.
Ms. Bogoraz has said she believed Marchenko began a hunger strike
Aug. 4 to protest the authorities' refusal to allow her to visit him. She spec
ulated during an interview in November that authorities had begun force
feeding him.
In a letter dated Aug. 4 that made its way to a Western human rights or
ganization and was released in October, Marchenko wrote of beatings and
repeated terms in a cold isolation cell. He said his treatment amounted to
"an assembly line to annihilation."
Philippine truce draws closer
MANILA, Philippines — The government and rebels resolved a dispute
over weapons yesterday, removing the last obstacle to a truce in the com
munist insurgency that has plagued the archipelago since 1969.
Spokesmen for President Corazon Aquino and the rebel National Demo
cratic Front said the 60-day cease-fire would begin at noon today (8 p.m.
yesterday PST) as scheduled.
Both sides said the agreement provides that armed guerrillas will not en
ter "population centers" and soldiers will not confiscate rebel weapons
during security patrols.
One of Aquino's first acts after becoming president last February was to
free political prisoners, including some former communist leaders, as part
of a "national reconciliation" that also involved seeking a cease-fire with
the rebels.
She said there was no reason for them to continue fighting because Pres
ident Ferdinand Marcos, against whom they rebelled, had fled the country.
More than 2,000 people have been killed in "insurgency-related inci
dents" under the Aquino government, according to the military.
Court to rule on creationism
SHREVEPORT, La. — The latest battle over teaching creationism in
public schools, which the Supreme Court tikes up today, began one even
ing in 1978, when Bill Keith of Shreveport came home to find his wife in
tears. Their 13-year-old son's science teacher, she explained, had ridiculed
the youth for saying that he did not believe "we came from monkeys" but
that God created man.
"That set something off," Keith said in an interview "I was mad. I said to
myself that if I ever have a chance to do something about it, I would.
That chance came three years later when Keith, then a state senator,
sponsored a law requiring that if Louisiana schools teach the theory of
evolution they also teach "creation science "
A U.S. district court judge, without ordering a full trial, struck down the
law last year as a violation of the First Amendment's required separation of
church and state The judge said creation science inevitably means teaching
the existence of a divine creator, which is in effect teaching a religious
belief A three judge panel of the Sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed

Philippine truce draws closer
MANILA, Philippines — The government and rebels resolved a dispute
over weapons yesterday, removing the last obstacle to a truce in the com
munist insurgency that has plagued the archipelago since 1969.
Spokesmen for President Corazon Aquino and the rebel National Demo
cratic Front said the 60-day cease-fire would begin at noon today (8 p.m.
yesterday PST) as scheduled.
Both sides said the agreement provides that armed guerrillas will not en
ter "population centers" and soldiers will not confiscate rebel weapons
during security patrols.
One of Aquino's first acts after becoming president last February was to
free political prisoners, including some former communist leaders, as part
of a "national reconciliation" that also involved seeking a cease-fire with
the rebels.
She said there was no reason for them to continue fighting because Pres
ident Ferdinand Marcos, against whom they rebelled, had fled the country.
More than 2,000 people have been killed in "insurgency-related inci
dents" under the Aquino government, according to the military.
Court to rule on creationism
SHREVEPORT, La. — The latest battle over teaching creationism in
public schools, which the Supreme Court tikes up today, began one even
ing in 1978, when Bill Keith of Shreveport came home to find his wife in
tears. Their 13-year-old son's science teacher, she explained, had ridiculed
the youth for saying that he did not believe "we came from monkeys" but
that God created man.
"That set something off," Keith said in an interview "I was mad. I said to
myself that if I ever have a chance to do something about it, I would.
That chance came three years later when Keith, then a state senator,
sponsored a law requiring that if Louisiana schools teach the theory of
evolution they also teach "creation science "
A U.S. district court judge, without ordering a full trial, struck down the
law last year as a violation of the First Amendment's required separation of
church and state The judge said creation science inevitably means teaching
the existence of a divine creator, which is in effect teaching a religious
belief A three judge panel of the Sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed

Soviets warn U.S. on Nicaragua
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union warned the United States yesterday
against taking a direct military role in the Nicaraguan civil war and charged
that recent U.S. moves in Central America were "extremely serious."
The warning was issued by Boris Pyadashev, a senior Foreign Ministry of
ficial, at a news briefing. He was commenting on reports that U.S. helicop
ters transported Honduran troops to a border region where Nicaraguan
government forces had crossed the frontier in pursuit of American-backed
rebel forces.
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, cited Nicaraguan charges that U.S.
planes had bombed two Nicaraguan border towns over the weekend and
accused Washington of engaging in "international terrorism." U.S. officials
have denied any such American raid.
Pyadashev said, "We assess the situation around Nicaragua as extremely
serious. We cannot exclude the possibility that the United States will take
further risky steps."
U.S. officials, he said, are escalating tension in Central America in an at
tempt to divert attention from the political uproar over secret arms ship
ments to Iran.
"It is quite possible they will use weapons," he said. "We warn the
United States against such steps and urge it to put aside such plans and in
tentions."
Washington, he said, is "playing with fire."
Swiss to investigate U.S. fraud
WASHINGTON — The United States has formally asked Swiss authorities
for help in an investigation into possible criminal offenses involving the
use of two Swiss bank accounts that are believed to have been used to fun
nel proceeds from secret arms sales to Iran to Nicaraguan rebels, a Swiss
official said Monday.
Swiss government spokesman Achille Casanova said the formal U.S. re
quest came Monday following an informal one last week. He declined to
say what criminal offenses were cited, but other Swiss sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the request was believed to be referring to
alleged fraud.
The Washington Post, in yesterday's editions, reported that the criminal
investigation involved three Americans, who are believed to have used the
two Swiss bank accounts. The Post identified two of the three as Lt. Col.
Oliver North, a former National Security Council aide fired last month, and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, whom Secretary of State George
Shultz identified Monday as a participant in the clandestine arms sale deals.
The New York Times, in yesterday's editions, reported that the Justice
Department and congressional investigators were looking into Secord's
participation in the secret diplomacy with Iran, his efforts to funnel arms to
the Nicaraguan rebels and whether he used his diplomatic acitivities to fur
ther his private business dealings in the Middle East
SEC broadens Boesky probe
WASHINGTON — The government investigation of Wall Street
speculator Ivan Boesky is ranging beyond insider trading to focus on a
wide range of corporate takeover activities, including possible illegal col
laboration by groups of investors in takeover bids, according to sources
familiar with the probe.
The broader investigation could lead to action against stock speculators
known as arbitrageurs and other investors who might not be in jeopardy
under federal insider trading sanctions, sources said.
Investigators are examining whether wealthy investors acted together to
buy significant stakes in companies before disclosing their actions to the
public and the companies, according to the sources.
Critics of takeovers have complained that such secret collaboration by
professional traders often accelerates the takeover process by concentrat
ing a major bloc of a company's stock in the hands of a relatively few
traders and investors before the market is aware of their actions. When the
investors do disclose their purchases, the stock price typically soars, creat
ing windfall profits if the company is sold, or if the company buys back the
stock at higher prices.
SEC rules require public disclosure of large stock purchases to alert
companies and investors to major investment moves. A deliberate violation
of the rules could lead to criminal charges, attorneys said.
Soviet dissident dies in prison
MOSCOW — Anatoly Marchenko, a prominent Soviet human rights ac

in prison at the age of 48, a friend said yesterday.
Marchenko's wife, Larisa Bogoraz, was informed of the death in a
telegram that arrived at noon yesterday.
The dissident, who spent 20 years in prison and internal exile, was a
member of the disbanded Helsinki Watch Group that tried to monitor So
viet compliance with the 1975 accord on human rights. He also wrote the
