Have you ever worn a pair of
high heels and awoken the
next day with aching ankles,
knees or lower back? Have
you worn high heels all day,
then put on jogging or
aerobics shoes, only to feel
your legs throb after exercis
ing?
Extended wear of high heels
may cause adaptive shorten
ing of the calf muscles. When
you put on athletic shoes, flat
shoes, or go barefoot, you will
feel a tight, irritating sensa
tion. Ankle and knee pain can
be prevented through extra
stretching of the calf muscles
before activities such as run
ning, aerobics, or any other
physical or athletic endeavor.
In addition, high heels tend
to throw your body forward,
causing you to compensate
somewhere else. This often
causes increased curvature of
the lower back (bordosis). In

turn, this may allow the
muscles of the lower back to
shorten and become tight or
may lead to an injury from a
malaignment of the vertebrae.
If you wear high heels, you
should stretch and strengthen
your lower back and ab
dominal muscles, and should
attempt to maintain proper
posture.
Cramps in the feet may be
due to shoes which are too
tight and to an abnormal dis
tribution of weight on your
feet. Stretching your toes and
arch of the foot may prevent
cramping.
Strengthening muscles of
the lower leg may help
prevent some strains and
sprains associated with
wearing high heels. If you
have questions about the best
types of stretching exercises
to counteract the effects of
high heels, call the Physical
Therapy Department at
Cowell, 723-3195.
