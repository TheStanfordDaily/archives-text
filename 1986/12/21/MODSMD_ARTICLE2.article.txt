## Nutritional mazes 
### 
It is difficult to open a news
paper or magazine without
reading about a new dietary
guideline or controversy in
the area of nutrition. In
creased media attention un
doubtedly has to do with
increasing awareness of the
role nutrition plays in general
well-being and disease pre
vention.
In a year each person
consumes over a thousand
meals. An activity so popular
deserves a lot of attention.
The problem is knowing what
to believe and how to make
healthful decisions as the
debates rage on.
Nutritional concerns have
changed. In the early part of
the century, major problems
involved vitamin and mineral
deficiencies contributing to
scurvy, beriberi and rickets.
Protein deficiencies were also
common.
Areas of concern in the con
temporary American diet have
to do with overabundance,
characterized by excessive
calories, excessive salt, ex
cessive fat, and excessive
sugar.
The shift is largely due to
the abundance of processed
foods we consume, and to the
popularity of meats and high
fat dairy products like cheese
and ice cream.
Although meats and dairy
products offer high-quality
protein and other valuable
nutrients, these foods are
consumed in such large
amounts and with such fre
quency that we are
"overdosing." The extra
protein and fat from these
foods contribute to obesity,

and even heart disease and
cancer in many people.
Processed foods are another
major dietary problem for
most Americans. It's not only
hot dogs, potato chips, and
canned foods that are the
processed-foods culprits, but
healthy-sounding foods like
granola bars, fruit rolls, and
"natural" soft drinks. The
manufacturing process almost
always includes adding fat,
sugar, salt, or some combina
tion of these substances to the
food. Processing can also
mean that certain nutrients,
like fiber and vitamins, are
taken out of the food.
Many of the excesses are
hidden in the foods we eat.
For example, only half the fat
in meat can be trimmed away.
The rest is marbled through
out. The fat in many baked
products is equally invisible,
as is the fat in cheese. A good
test for hidden fats is whether or
not the food leaves a greasy resi
due on your fingers or your
plate. Croissants, pizza, and
sweet rolls are only a few of
the foods that contain hidden
fat. Canned sauces, ketchup
and salad dressing are a few of
the foods that contain hidden
sugar.
As dietary habits have
shifted toward high protein
and highly processed foods,
they have moved away from
the foods high in complex car
bohydrates. Such foods in
clude fruit, vegetables, beans,
rice, potatoes and whole grain
breads and cereals. These
foods are good sources of fi
ber and many other nutrients.
