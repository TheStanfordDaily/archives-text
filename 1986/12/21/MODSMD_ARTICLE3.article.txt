# The 						blues: winter time, anytime
## 
### 
Doug Daher
About this time of year,
many Stanford students begin
to feel emotionally low — a re
action sometimes called the
Winter Quarter Blues.
For freshmen, this can fol
low their first trip home for
the holiday. A fresh look at
families, old girlfriends and
boyfriends, or a younger
sibling taking over the
domain, all contribute to a list
less feeling that emerges on
return to school.
For other students simply
being in the middle of the
school year, realizing that it is

only half over, also contri
butes to the blues.
Other sources of this feeling
may include the possibility of
leaving Stanford in the spring,
pressures of career and finan
cial decision-making, or the
complexities of relationships.
Winter quarter blues is an
other term for depression.
But what is depression?
Characterized by low energy,
apathy, feeling down, being
"in the pits" or "bummed
out," it is a time of turning in
ward usually with a sense of
great isolation. It is a mood. It
can be a temporary condition,

or it can be something more
severe and prolonged that
may require professional help
to assure its relief.
Milder moods pass quickly
(moments to hours to days).
Often support from friends
and family is very effective in
alleviating bad feelings. The
more depressed a person
gets, the harder it is to remain
objective. Talking to someone
can help to become more ob
jective by having them point
out a pattern in relationships,
re-evaluate a routine or exam
ine an expectation.
Increasing activity and exer
cising without dwelling upon
what is distressful is also help
ful. Coping strategies
developed over the years can
be relied upon. Taking a look
at what has worked in the past
is usually effective in lifting
moods of depression.
Sometimes the depression
comes on for no apparent rea
son and may have other per
sistent physical symptoms.
Sore throats, swelling of
glands, a lingering cold,
mononucleosis or other viral
illnesses, and anemia are asso
ciated with feelings of depres
sion.
Depression can also appear
after a death, the break up of a
family, or injury. Such depres
sions may be initially severe as
the individual deals with
his/her grief. These types of
depressions tend to be time
limited and responsive to
warmth and support.
Of greater concern,
however, is when depression
descends for weeks as a mood
that cannot be lifted by one's
self or others. This kind of de
pression can happen to
anyone. It may be a reflection
of a more profound response
to a loss, or a manifestation of
a kind of depression that runs
in families.
Clinical depressions are of
ten cyclic, but are depressions
of severe intensity that may be
a one time occurrence.
The symptoms of clinical
depressions are:
• low energy
• loss of appetite
• weight loss
• poor concentration
• preoccupation with feelings
of sadness or hopelessness
• various physical symptoms

• lowered self-esteem or self
blame
• suicidal thoughts
Most people have experi
enced suicidal thoughts.
However these thoughts
usually are transitory — brief
moments of despair that
reflect the futility of the mo
ment. When the thoughts per
sist and are associated with
the previously mentioned
symptoms, the danger is real
and such thoughts or state
ments must be taken
seriously.
As a friend or roommate,
any observation of biological
or psychological changes,
withdrawal from friends, state
ments such as "I don't belong
at Stanford," "I'd be better off
gone," or the giving away of
personal articles are cues to
act upon. Set up a support
network of friends, and as a
group suggest a visit to Cowell
for the individual. This shows
caring by other people.
It is important to recognize
that depression is on a con
tinuum, and that timing, in
tensity and symptomatology
are clues that can help charac
terize the severeity of the de
pression. The milder
depressions, the Winter Quar
ter Blues respond to support,
whether from friends or coun
selors. The more severe
depressions require profes
sional help and perhaps
medication.
Such a depression can be
treated and it is important to
seek out treatment from a
trained professional just as
one would for a severe physi
cal illness. Counseling can be
of benefit all along the con
tinuum and early recognition
and treatment can do much to
alleviate emotional pain.

Such a depression can be

seek out treatment from a

one would for a severe physi

of benefit all along the con

and treatment can do much to
alleviate emotional pain.

About this time of year,
many Stanford students begin
to feel emotionally low — a re
action sometimes called the
Winter Quarter Blues.
For freshmen, this can fol
low their first trip home for
the holiday. A fresh look at
families, old girlfriends and
boyfriends, or a younger
sibling taking over the
domain, all contribute to a list
less feeling that emerges on
return to school.
For other students simply
being in the middle of the
school year, realizing that it is

only half over, also contri
butes to the blues.
Other sources of this feeling
may include the possibility of
leaving Stanford in the spring,
pressures of career and finan
cial decision-making, or the
complexities of relationships.
Winter quarter blues is an
other term for depression.
But what is depression?
Characterized by low energy,
apathy, feeling down, being
"in the pits" or "bummed
out," it is a time of turning in
ward usually with a sense of
great isolation. It is a mood. It
can be a temporary condition,

or it can be something more
severe and prolonged that
may require professional help
to assure its relief.
Milder moods pass quickly
(moments to hours to days).
Often support from friends
and family is very effective in
alleviating bad feelings. The
more depressed a person
gets, the harder it is to remain
objective. Talking to someone
can help to become more ob
jective by having them point
out a pattern in relationships,
re-evaluate a routine or exam
ine an expectation.
Increasing activity and exer
cising without dwelling upon
what is distressful is also help
ful. Coping strategies
developed over the years can
be relied upon. Taking a look
at what has worked in the past
is usually effective in lifting
moods of depression.
Sometimes the depression
comes on for no apparent rea
son and may have other per
sistent physical symptoms.
Sore throats, swelling of
glands, a lingering cold,
mononucleosis or other viral
illnesses, and anemia are asso
ciated with feelings of depres
sion.
Depression can also appear
after a death, the break up of a
family, or injury. Such depres
sions may be initially severe as
the individual deals with
his/her grief. These types of
depressions tend to be time
limited and responsive to
warmth and support.
Of greater concern,
however, is when depression
descends for weeks as a mood
that cannot be lifted by one's
self or others. This kind of de
pression can happen to
anyone. It may be a reflection
of a more profound response
to a loss, or a manifestation of
a kind of depression that runs
in families.
Clinical depressions are of
ten cyclic, but are depressions
of severe intensity that may be
a one time occurrence.
The symptoms of clinical
depressions are:
• low energy
• loss of appetite
• weight loss
• poor concentration
• preoccupation with feelings
of sadness or hopelessness
• various physical symptoms

• lowered self-esteem or self
blame
• suicidal thoughts
Most people have experi
enced suicidal thoughts.
However these thoughts
usually are transitory — brief
moments of despair that
reflect the futility of the mo
ment. When the thoughts per
sist and are associated with
the previously mentioned
symptoms, the danger is real
and such thoughts or state
ments must be taken
seriously.
As a friend or roommate,
any observation of biological
or psychological changes,
withdrawal from friends, state
ments such as "I don't belong
at Stanford," "I'd be better off
gone," or the giving away of
personal articles are cues to
act upon. Set up a support
network of friends, and as a
group suggest a visit to Cowell
for the individual. This shows
caring by other people.
It is important to recognize
that depression is on a con
tinuum, and that timing, in
tensity and symptomatology
are clues that can help charac
terize the severeity of the de
pression. The milder
depressions, the Winter Quar
ter Blues respond to support,
whether from friends or coun
selors. The more severe
depressions require profes
sional help and perhaps
medication.
Such a depression can be
treated and it is important to
seek out treatment from a
