# Arson blamed for San Juan fire

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico â€” Justice
Secretary Hector Rivera Cruz said yes
terday the Dupont Plaza Hotel fire was
"arson," but there is no evidence that
an "explosive device or bomb" was
used in the blaze that killed 95 persons
on New Year's Eve.
He revealed no evidence about how
the fire started, or how it spread with
such extraordinary speed through the
lower two floors of the hotel.
"We have determined the point of
origin where the fire began and how it
spread," he announced this afternoon
at a press conference from a hotel bal
cony overlooking the Dupont's out
door pool and sundeck.
"We have concluded this was an ar
son, an incendiary fire, and we have to
conclude also that we did not find
evidence of (an) explosive device or
bomb related with this fire."
Puerto Rican police said they
received a telephoned bomb threat
against the hotel about two hours
before the blaze, but that officers sent
to investigate were turned away by the
hotel's security guards, who said all
was normal at the Dupont.
Guests have reported hearing as
many as three blasts during the blaze,

which began about 3:15 p.m. Dec. 31,
when the Dupont was fully occupied
by guests at the peak of the holiday
vacation season. Andrew Vita, leader of
a U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (ATF) arson investigation
unit, said the sounds reported by the
witnesses "are consistent with the
movement of fire without an explosive
device."
Cruz said some physical evidence
recovered from the gutted lower two
floors of the 21-story, oceanside hotel
will undergo chemical analysis by ATF.
The bureau has a laboratory for such
work in Rockville, Md.
"(At) this moment, our investigation
has established that the basic cause of
the fire was arson, using incendiary
substances to start it,"he added. "We
dismiss an explosive device or bomb."
Cruz refused to offer any details of
the findings of the four-day search for
clues, saying, "We need to protect the
investigation and cannot offer details
on the specific point in the building
that was the point of arson, or what (is)
witnesses' testimony, or other
evidence because our -responsibility is
to establish the responsibility for this
act."

However, the ATF team has concen
trated its search for evidence in the
northeast corner of the hotel, the loca
tion of a ballroom where hotel
employees of a Teamsters Union local
met and voted to strike the Dupont at
midnight that night after talks on a new
work contract broken down.
Guests and others have said the fire
broke out in the ballroom a few
minutes after the employees took their
strike vote and left.
Three small fires had hit the hotel
during Christmas week. Leaders of

Teamsters Local 901 have denied
making threats or acting against the
hotel or its management.
Cruz said the investigation will focus
now on "determining which person or
persons participated in this arson."
Cruz said he was clamping a tight lid
on any findings to avoid tipping off
possible defendants.
The Puerto Ricans also are being as
sisted by the FBI and the U.S. attorneys
office here.
