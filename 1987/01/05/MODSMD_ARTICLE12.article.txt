### 
Juan Valenzuela, noted dancer and senior lecturer in
drama and dance at Stanford, died Dec. 9 of an apparent
heart attack in his home in Palo Alto. He was 67.
Valenzuela had taught in the Department of Drama and
the Division of Dance since the fall of 1974. Immediately
before coming to Stanford he taught dance at the Institute of
American Indian Arts in Sante Fe, N.M.
Valenzuela was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, of Spanish
and Aztec-Yaqui descent. He was educated in Salt Lake City.
After service in the Army in World War 11, Valenzuela began
the professional study of dance. His teachers included Jose
Limon, William Christiansen, Katherine Dunham and Martha
Graham.
Valenzuela performed with several professional compan
ies including the Graham company and danced in many
Broadway musicals. In later years, his attenion focused upon

the uses of dance in training actors and the use of move
ment in elementary education.
His ability to integrate movement, music, math and lan
guage made him a highly original, creative and unique
teacher of young people. This work led to his appointment
as a movement specialist for the National Endowment of the
Arts (NEA). He won special recognition for his children's
book, "I am Magic."
After completing his assignment with the NEA, Valenzuela
continued to work with elementary children and educators
as a consultant to Peninsula schools. He most recently was
working with students at Arundel School in San Carlos. His
students there danced in a program with the Children's
Dance Theatre of Salt Lake City in May at Stanford.
He is survived by a sister, Maria Kapp, of Salt Lake City,
and by three brothers, George and Rueben, of Salt Lake City,
and Miguel, of Tempe, Arizona.
