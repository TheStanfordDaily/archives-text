A spring break trip to Central America is in the works for
a group of students who want to help rebuild the University
of El Salvador, which was damaged by a major earthquake
last fall.
The trip is still in the planning stages, according to Stan
ford Lutheran Pastor Herb Schmidt, who, along with Acting
Dean of the Chapel Tom Ambrogi, met with administrators
of the Salvadoran university in November.
The Stanford students working on the project are also in
volved in the national sanctuary - movement to provide shel
ter and support for Latin American refugees, according to
Schmidt. As many as 15 of them could go on the trip, he
said.
The proposal calls for an orientation period, to be con
ducted this quarter, with information about the political,
economic and social situation in El Salvador. During the
trip, students would meet with human rights organizations
such as "The Comadres" (Mothers of the Disappeared) and
visit villages being repopulated, Schmidt said.
Helping Salvadoran students on short-term rebuilding
projects will be the main purpose of the trip, according to
Schmidt.
Up to 80 percent of the structures in San Salvador, the
capital, were either damaged or destroyed when the
earthquake hit El Salvador Oct. 10, 1986.
The University of El Salvador, located in San Salvador, had

33,000 students enrolled at the time. Over 70 percent ot the
University buildings were destroyed in the earthquake.
Teachers and students have returned to campus and are
holding classes outdoors After classes, they work together
to construct temporary classrooms made of frames covered
with plastic sheets, according to Schmidt.
Schmidt said he does not think the trip could be danger
ous for Stanford students. For North Americans traveling in
Central America, "El Salvador is probably one of the safest
places to be," he said.
If the spring trip proves productive, the Stanford students
would investigate a possible summer trip involving more
students, Schmidt said.
Schmidt and Ambrogi also presented the Salvadoran ad
ministrators with a request by Stanford students to establish
a sister relationship with students at the national school.
A sister relationship means "that we would be supportive
to their struggles" and also might include the initiation of
student exchanges, according to Schmidt.
A letter sent to all Stanford faculty shortly before winter
break asking for donations towards earthquake relief raised
more than $1,000, according to Schmidt.
"We expect a few more thousand (dollars) to come in,'
Schmidt said.
Schmidt and Ambrogi originally went to El Salvador in
November on invitation to participate in an international
peace conference sponsored by the national union of Salva
doran workers and some religious, academic and human
rights groups.
