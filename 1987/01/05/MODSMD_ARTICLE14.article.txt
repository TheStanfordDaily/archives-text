Carnegie contributes $150,000

To support college graduates inter
ested in careers in public service, the
Carnegie Corporation of New York has
contributed $150,000 to the John
Gardner Fellowship Program, a joint
public service fellowship for graduat
ing seniors from both Stanford and the
University of California-Berkeley.
The Carnegie Corporation is a
philanthropic foundation created in
1911 by Andrew Carnegie. The corpo
ration currently commits between $25
million and $35 million annually to
grants used for research and educa
tion.
The six Gardner fellows, three from
each campus, are chosen each spring
from a variety of fields on the basis of
academic excellence and commitment
to the cause of public and voluntary
sector service.
Stanford's 1986-87 recipients, Donna
Anderson, Elizabeth Butler and Troy
Eid, began their 11-month fellowships
in September.
Anderson is working as an aide to
Doris Ward, a member of the San Fran
cisco Board of Supervisors. Butler is

working with Sara Rosenhlum, direc
tor of the Children's Defense Fund's
Health Division in Washington, D.C.
Eid is serving as a special assistant to
Mark Fowler, chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, Wash
ington, D.C.
Fellows take part in a range of activi
ties such as drafting legislation, writing
speeches and analyzing public
policies.
The fellowship, established in 1985
with funding from the Walter and Elise
Haas Fund, honors Stanford and
Berkeley alumnus John Gardner,
former president of the Carnegie Cor
poration and former secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
Spray to be used against moths
Stanford groundskeepers began this
month to try to end an infestation of

the tussock moth near the Biological
Sciences Building by spraying with an
emulsion containing highly refined pe
troleum.
The infestation, which began about
five years ago, has damaged trees and
plants near the building and is spread
ing to the area around the Stanford
Oval near the quadrangle, according to
Herb Fong, manager of grounds.
Because of the proximity to the Biol
ogy Department, with its dozens of lab
oratories, researchers there asked that
biocides normally used to counter
moths and caterpillars not be used.
The biologists fear that any chemical
weapon could contaminate experi
ments in the laboratories.
Reliance on natural predators of the
moths also failed. The result of these
measures was to worsen the infesta
tion, Fong said.
The idea for using dormant oil came
from Carl Koehler of the University of
California-Berkeley, a scientist who is
consulting with Stanford. The oil smot
hers the insect by clogging its breath
ing openings.
According to Fong, the moth is
brown, about three-quarters of an inch
long. The caterpillar is more colorful:
orange-yellow with tufts of black hair
curled over its back.
Currently the insect is in its egg mass
stage, Fong said, and the oil will kill the
eggs.

The oil emulsion will be sprayed on
the trees and branches in the area.
Friedman receives Japanese award
Milton Friedman, senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution, was
decorated with the Grand Cordon of
the Order of the Sacred Treasure by
the Japanese Consul General in San
Francisco.
"Dr. Friedman has dedicated himself
to contributing his knowledge in the
area of Japan's economic development
and economic policy decisions. His
widely recognized contributiuons in
the field of economics cover many top
ics, including pricing, monetary supply
and international economics," noted
the Japan Information News Service.

Upon receiving the commendation,
Friedman commented: "Japan and the
United States are two great countries
that have common interests — both
economic and political. I accept this
award as an indication of the effective
ness of our cooperation in the past and
as a sign of the continued cooperation
in the future. It is a great honor that I
shall treasure."
The award honors individuals for
their contribution to Japanese political,
economic and social thought.
Free cancer screening offered
Free screening for skin cancer will
be offered Saturday, Jan. 10, at the Der
matology Clinic in the Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center.

Dr. Chung-Hong Hu, director of the
Dermatology Clinic and associate pro
fessor of dermatology in the School of
Medicine, said the screening will con
sist of preliminary examination of the
skin and is not considered complete
diagnosis. Individuals with moles or
other skin conditions that look suspici
ous will be advised to have more thor
ough examinations, including
biopsies.
The examinations will take about 15
minutes, Hu said, and people will be
examined in the order in which they
arrive at the clinic. There will be no
need to make appointments.
There will be a full staff of six faculty
members as well as residents and
nurses on hand for the screening
p.m.

Free cancer screening offered
Free screening for skin cancer will
be offered Saturday, Jan. 10, at the Der
matology Clinic in the Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center.

Dr. Chung-Hong Hu, director of the
Dermatology Clinic and associate pro
fessor of dermatology in the School of
Medicine, said the screening will con
sist of preliminary examination of the
skin and is not considered complete
diagnosis. Individuals with moles or
other skin conditions that look suspici
ous will be advised to have more thor
ough examinations, including
biopsies.
The examinations will take about 15
minutes, Hu said, and people will be
examined in the order in which they
arrive at the clinic. There will be no
need to make appointments.
There will be a full staff of six faculty
members as well as residents and
nurses on hand for the screening

Carnegie contributes $150,000

To support college graduates inter
ested in careers in public service, the
Carnegie Corporation of New York has
contributed $150,000 to the John
Gardner Fellowship Program, a joint
public service fellowship for graduat
ing seniors from both Stanford and the
University of California-Berkeley.
The Carnegie Corporation is a
philanthropic foundation created in
1911 by Andrew Carnegie. The corpo
ration currently commits between $25
million and $35 million annually to
grants used for research and educa
tion.
The six Gardner fellows, three from
each campus, are chosen each spring
from a variety of fields on the basis of
academic excellence and commitment
to the cause of public and voluntary
sector service.
Stanford's 1986-87 recipients, Donna
Anderson, Elizabeth Butler and Troy
Eid, began their 11-month fellowships
in September.
Anderson is working as an aide to
Doris Ward, a member of the San Fran
cisco Board of Supervisors. Butler is

working with Sara Rosenhlum, direc
tor of the Children's Defense Fund's
Health Division in Washington, D.C.
Eid is serving as a special assistant to
Mark Fowler, chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, Wash
ington, D.C.
Fellows take part in a range of activi
ties such as drafting legislation, writing
speeches and analyzing public
policies.
The fellowship, established in 1985
with funding from the Walter and Elise
Haas Fund, honors Stanford and
Berkeley alumnus John Gardner,
former president of the Carnegie Cor
poration and former secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
Spray to be used against moths
Stanford groundskeepers began this
month to try to end an infestation of

the tussock moth near the Biological
Sciences Building by spraying with an
emulsion containing highly refined pe
troleum.
The infestation, which began about
five years ago, has damaged trees and
plants near the building and is spread
ing to the area around the Stanford
Oval near the quadrangle, according to
Herb Fong, manager of grounds.
Because of the proximity to the Biol
ogy Department, with its dozens of lab
oratories, researchers there asked that
biocides normally used to counter
moths and caterpillars not be used.
The biologists fear that any chemical
weapon could contaminate experi
ments in the laboratories.
Reliance on natural predators of the
moths also failed. The result of these
measures was to worsen the infesta
tion, Fong said.
The idea for using dormant oil came
from Carl Koehler of the University of
California-Berkeley, a scientist who is
consulting with Stanford. The oil smot
hers the insect by clogging its breath
ing openings.
According to Fong, the moth is
brown, about three-quarters of an inch
long. The caterpillar is more colorful:
orange-yellow with tufts of black hair
curled over its back.
Currently the insect is in its egg mass
stage, Fong said, and the oil will kill the
eggs.

The oil emulsion will be sprayed on
the trees and branches in the area.
