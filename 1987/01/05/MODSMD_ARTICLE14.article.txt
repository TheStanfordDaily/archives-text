Carnegie contributes $150,000

To support college graduates inter
ested in careers in public service, the
Carnegie Corporation of New York has
contributed $150,000 to the John
Gardner Fellowship Program, a joint
public service fellowship for graduat
ing seniors from both Stanford and the
University of California-Berkeley.
The Carnegie Corporation is a
philanthropic foundation created in
1911 by Andrew Carnegie. The corpo
ration currently commits between $25
million and $35 million annually to
grants used for research and educa
tion.
The six Gardner fellows, three from
each campus, are chosen each spring
from a variety of fields on the basis of
academic excellence and commitment
to the cause of public and voluntary
sector service.
Stanford's 1986-87 recipients, Donna
Anderson, Elizabeth Butler and Troy
Eid, began their 11-month fellowships
in September.
Anderson is working as an aide to
Doris Ward, a member of the San Fran
cisco Board of Supervisors. Butler is

working with Sara Rosenhlum, direc
tor of the Children's Defense Fund's
Health Division in Washington, D.C.
Eid is serving as a special assistant to
Mark Fowler, chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, Wash
ington, D.C.
Fellows take part in a range of activi
ties such as drafting legislation, writing
speeches and analyzing public
policies.
The fellowship, established in 1985
with funding from the Walter and Elise
Haas Fund, honors Stanford and
Berkeley alumnus John Gardner,
former president of the Carnegie Cor
poration and former secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
Spray to be used against moths
Stanford groundskeepers began this
month to try to end an infestation of

the tussock moth near the Biological
Sciences Building by spraying with an
emulsion containing highly refined pe
troleum.
The infestation, which began about
five years ago, has damaged trees and
plants near the building and is spread
ing to the area around the Stanford
Oval near the quadrangle, according to
Herb Fong, manager of grounds.
Because of the proximity to the Biol
ogy Department, with its dozens of lab
oratories, researchers there asked that
biocides normally used to counter
moths and caterpillars not be used.
The biologists fear that any chemical
weapon could contaminate experi
ments in the laboratories.
Reliance on natural predators of the
moths also failed. The result of these
measures was to worsen the infesta
