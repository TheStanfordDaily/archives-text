Stanford fans had to swallow identifying with a fero
cious, red, winged creature that the Gator Bowl or
ganizers assumed was the school's mascot. They had to
endure cold, steel benches on an even colder, overcast
afternoon only a dozen miles from north Florida's sup
posedly "sunny" beaches.
They had to hold their own amid the throng of Clem
son rooters, who outnumbered the Stanford faithful by
about 20-1. They had to live with the fact that two starters
were at home after flunking their drug tests and other
key players were out with injuries. And worst of all, they
had to watch as the mighty Cardinal fell to the Clemson
Tigers 27-21, despite a near-miraculous come-from
behind effort.
A pretty dismal picture. Or so it would seem, until one
remembers back to September, when most Cardinal fans
were settling in for another 5-6, mediocre season and a
few long afternoons in the stadium entertained only by
the Band. A 5-0 start suggested something was different
about this Cardinal team, a team with great bowl
prospects. Not even tough losses to Washington and USC
and a forgettable outing in Big Game could derail Stan
ford. After each loss, the team promptly picked itself up,
pummeling helpless opponents all three times.
Something was different about this team.
The team earned top-20 ratings in all of the major
polls at one time or another. The Cardinal raised a few
eyebrows in parts of the country where football is life it

self and Stanford University simply the one-time home of
the Denver Broncos' quarterback.
The Gator Bowl bid, Stanford's first bowl invitation in
eight years, was the season's crowning achievement. The
invitation to the Jacksonville, Fla., game meant a lot of
things to a lot of people, from the millions who watched
the game on television, to those few fortunate students
who made their way to Jacksonville to support the team,
to the 95 student-athletes who made it possible. "It will
be good for recruiting, it's a chance to reconnect with
alumni, a chance for a lot of people (in Florida) who
don't get to Stanford very often, and most of all it's a
reward for the players — it's a wonderful chance for
them," said University President Donald Kennedy, who
spent the first days of his winter sabbatical rooting on the
team in Jacksonville.
It was a moment in the spotlight for the entire Univer
sity, its alumni and its irrepressible band — which South
eastern football fans will doubtless not forget for a long
time. But most deserving of that spotlight, as Kennedy
pointed out, is the group of students who never quit
even when the Cardinal fans became frustrated, who
rekindled interest in the Stanford football program, and
who have shown that uncompromising academics and
excellent athletics can combine to create a winning,
classy football program. The season ended with a tough
loss, but the season itself was a big gain. Our hats are off
to the 1986 Cardinal.
Bowl games are fun. Let's do it again next year.
