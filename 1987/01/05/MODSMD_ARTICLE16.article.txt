W. Culture authors
not Anglo-Saxon
In his viewpoint on the Western
Culture Program (Daily, Dec. 3),
Joseph Green uses the expression
"white, Anglo-Saxon culture." He
seems to mean by this the culture that
the Western Culture Program requires
students to study.
Being of Anglo-Saxon extraction
myself, I find that choice of term
rather flattering. It would be nice to
believe that fellow Anglo-Saxons
wrote the Bible, the "Iliad," the
"Aenied," the "Inferno" and the
"Prince," "Candide," "Faust," the
Communist Manifesto and "Beyond
Good and Evil." But alas, they didn't.
The bitter truth is that of the more
than 30 authors on the core list, only
seven either were or wrote in English.

Daily headline
on Israel incorrect
An article appeared on page 2, the
Update section (Daily, Dec. 5), which
grossly misrepresented the facts of the
event.
First of all, the headline read, "2
Israelis killed ..while the first line
of the article read, "Two Palestinian
students were killed " Herein lies
a fundamental contradiction, for the
vast majority of Palestianians are not
Israelis and vice versa. Who then was
killed? The same day's edition of the
San Francisco Chronicle provides a
much more balanced view of the
event on page 23. According to that
newspaper, the two students who
were killed were from the Gaza Strip,
one of three occupied territories
administered by Israel. Residents of
this territory are not citizens of Israel
and are therefore not referred to as
Israelis but as Palestinians.
Secondly, and perhaps more impor
tantly, the Daily article states,
"versions of events given by the army

and by university officials differ radi
cally." However, the remainder of the
article was devoted solely to the ver
sion given by the army! In each of the
remaining paragraphs, there appeared
phrases such as, "according to an
army spokesman," "according to the
military," and"the army spokesman
said." What happened to the version
of events given by university officals,
which the Chronicle not only also
described as being "widely different"
from the army version but also in
cluded in their article in order to
provide a more balanced report of the
incident?
This sense of balance was missing
in The Daily's article. I hope that in
the future Daily wire editors pay more
attention to their reporting, for the
student newspaper is often the only
source of international news for much
of the Stanford student population.
You have a responsibility to provide
us with balanced reporting.

Chappie sales pitch
childish, insulting
On Sunday, Dec. 7,1 finally met the
Stanford Chaparral. I was most
unimpressed by the staffs ridiculous
selling tactics. Just what do they think
the Stanford student body is? Have we
truly presented ourselves as a collec
tion of immature minds that will be
amused by a person dancing around
in a painted box? I mean, really, Stan
ford is a serious university, not a
daycare center for children.
Let me relate the exact details of my
encounter with the Stanford Chapar
ral. As I left the Christmas Fair at
Tresidder, the happy atmosphere of
holiday shopping was completely
shattered by the inane screams of a
Chaparral staff member high up in a
tree who threatened to jump to his
death if no one bought a copy of his
so-called humor magazine. The next
thing I knew, I was surrounded by
other Chaparral members, who
harassed me for at least five minutes

with feeble sales pitches and dumb
gags.
When I finally extricated myself
from these people, they told me that
because I was blonde and hadn't
bought a Chaparral, my hair would
turn into spaghetti. As I mounted my
bike, they taunted me by saying I
would have a bike accident and that a
thousand screaming monkies would
hide under my bed and give me the
"heebie-jeebies."
All I can say is that this was an
unpleasant, harrowing experience. It
ruined my day. I can comfort myself
that the Chaparral is just a conglomer
ate of the worst, silliest minds on
campus and therefore no real threat
to my person. Nevertheless, I don't
appreciate them telling me that my
mind will turn into cheescake if I
don't buy their infantile publication.

Branner isn't a
white theme dorm
As current residents of Branner
Hall, we are extremely offended by
Joeseph Green's passing reference to
Branner as a white theme house
("Western Culture must fight divi
sions," Daily, Dec. 3).
It is inconceivable to us that Bran
ner Hall could be considered a white
theme house by anyone. According to
Housing Center statistics, 26 percent
of Branner freshmen consider them
selves members of minority groups.
Given that, Green's remark is insult
ing. Branner Hall is racially no differ
ent from the other all-freshman dor
mitories and is clearly not a white
theme house.

Daily headline
on Israel incorrect
An article appeared on page 2, the
Update section (Daily, Dec. 5), which
grossly misrepresented the facts of the
event.
First of all, the headline read, "2
Israelis killed ..while the first line
of the article read, "Two Palestinian
students were killed " Herein lies
a fundamental contradiction, for the
vast majority of Palestianians are not
Israelis and vice versa. Who then was
killed? The same day's edition of the
San Francisco Chronicle provides a
much more balanced view of the
event on page 23. According to that
newspaper, the two students who
were killed were from the Gaza Strip,
one of three occupied territories
administered by Israel. Residents of
this territory are not citizens of Israel
and are therefore not referred to as
Israelis but as Palestinians.
Secondly, and perhaps more impor
tantly, the Daily article states,
"versions of events given by the army

and by university officials differ radi
cally." However, the remainder of the
article was devoted solely to the ver
sion given by the army! In each of the
remaining paragraphs, there appeared
phrases such as, "according to an
army spokesman," "according to the
military," and"the army spokesman
said." What happened to the version
of events given by university officals,
which the Chronicle not only also
described as being "widely different"
from the army version but also in
cluded in their article in order to
provide a more balanced report of the
incident?
This sense of balance was missing
in The Daily's article. I hope that in
the future Daily wire editors pay more
attention to their reporting, for the
student newspaper is often the only
source of international news for much
of the Stanford student population.
You have a responsibility to provide
us with balanced reporting.

Chappie sales pitch
childish, insulting
On Sunday, Dec. 7,1 finally met the
Stanford Chaparral. I was most
unimpressed by the staffs ridiculous
selling tactics. Just what do they think
the Stanford student body is? Have we
truly presented ourselves as a collec
tion of immature minds that will be
amused by a person dancing around
in a painted box? I mean, really, Stan
ford is a serious university, not a
daycare center for children.
Let me relate the exact details of my
encounter with the Stanford Chapar
ral. As I left the Christmas Fair at
Tresidder, the happy atmosphere of
holiday shopping was completely
shattered by the inane screams of a
Chaparral staff member high up in a
tree who threatened to jump to his
death if no one bought a copy of his
so-called humor magazine. The next
thing I knew, I was surrounded by
other Chaparral members, who
harassed me for at least five minutes

with feeble sales pitches and dumb
gags.
When I finally extricated myself
from these people, they told me that
because I was blonde and hadn't
bought a Chaparral, my hair would
turn into spaghetti. As I mounted my
bike, they taunted me by saying I
would have a bike accident and that a
thousand screaming monkies would
hide under my bed and give me the
"heebie-jeebies."
All I can say is that this was an
unpleasant, harrowing experience. It
ruined my day. I can comfort myself
that the Chaparral is just a conglomer
ate of the worst, silliest minds on
campus and therefore no real threat
to my person. Nevertheless, I don't
appreciate them telling me that my
mind will turn into cheescake if I
don't buy their infantile publication.

Branner isn't a
white theme dorm
As current residents of Branner
Hall, we are extremely offended by
Joeseph Green's passing reference to
Branner as a white theme house
("Western Culture must fight divi
sions," Daily, Dec. 3).
It is inconceivable to us that Bran
ner Hall could be considered a white
theme house by anyone. According to
Housing Center statistics, 26 percent
of Branner freshmen consider them
selves members of minority groups.
Given that, Green's remark is insult
ing. Branner Hall is racially no differ
ent from the other all-freshman dor
mitories and is clearly not a white
theme house.

W. Culture authors
not Anglo-Saxon
In his viewpoint on the Western
Culture Program (Daily, Dec. 3),
Joseph Green uses the expression
"white, Anglo-Saxon culture." He
seems to mean by this the culture that
the Western Culture Program requires
students to study.
Being of Anglo-Saxon extraction
myself, I find that choice of term
rather flattering. It would be nice to
believe that fellow Anglo-Saxons
wrote the Bible, the "Iliad," the
"Aenied," the "Inferno" and the
"Prince," "Candide," "Faust," the
Communist Manifesto and "Beyond
Good and Evil." But alas, they didn't.
