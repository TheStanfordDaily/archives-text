# Reagan misunderstands SDI

### 
"With Star Wars, 5 percent of incoming missiles can
get through. Well, that will be enough to break up
lunch."
— Actor Dudley Moore
On March 3, 1983, President Reagan proposed his
Strategic Defense Initiative to the nation. With irre
pressible optimism, the president unveiled his
remarkable "vision of the future," a defense shield

JOHN WELNER

that would ultimately render nuclear weapons
"impotent and obsolete." He proudly invoked the
"great talents" of our scientists and the moral
strength of our "human spirit." Yet three years after
Reagan's elegant words, "Star Wars" has failed to
become the solution to the world's nuclear dilemma.
Initially buried in cliches of American "know-how"
and Western moral superiority, SDI is now emerging
as a superficial, irresponsible attempt to address
chronic international instability with a simple,
"magic" solution. The limitations of Reagan's plan
certainly do not imply that the Pentagon should aban
don space weapons altogether, but they do indicate
that in order to develop a rational foreign policy, our
leaders must learn to separate myth from reality — to
distinguish fantasies from technological and political
possibilities.
For example, Reagan's view that "Star Wars" will
provide an impenetrable shield for the people of
America could not be further from the truth. Today's
technology simply cannot guarantee that every nu
clear warhead in a Soviet attack would be
neutralized. Recognizing this limitation, scientists
and policy-makers have begun to view SDI as merely

a method to ensure that some of our missiles survive.
Even Lt. General Abrahamson, the director of the SDI
program, concedes that the function of "Star Wars" is
"defensive deterrence," not the protection of Ameri
can cities. As Newsweek reporter Larry Martz can
didly writes, "With the possible exception of Ronald
Reagan, nobody believes that all the Soviet missiles
would be shot down."
Unfortunately, the promise of increased deter
rence also proves to be a myth. Since the president's
initial proposal, more than 7,000 scientists through
out the country have publicly rejected the feasibility
of SDI as even a partial defense of our nation's arse
nal. Furthermore, space weapons research drains
our military of resouces necessary to ensure the se
curity of today's nuclear forces. Funds devoted to de
signing a "Star Wars umbrella" could be better spent
developing our more elusive delivery systems, such
as submarines and mobile missiles. The Pentagon
could deploy these systems in the near future, and
even "Star Wars" enthusiasts concede that modern
submarines "can be counted on to survive a Soviet at
tack." By limiting our military options to his ques
tionable program, the president can only succeed in
undermining the deterrence of our forces.
Regardless of these shortcomings, many policy

makers justify "Star Wars" as a valuable "bargaining
chip." Soviet fear of Americas economic and techno
logical capabilities could translate into significant ad
vantages for the United States in an arms pact. At tne
Reykjavik summit, however, the president obstinately
rejected this option. When Gorbachev offered a
shocking, unprecedented proposal to eliminate all
nuclear weapons, Reagan declined because the So
viet leader required that research on "Star Wars"
remain within the "laboratory" for 10 years. Tragi
cally, most scientists believe that Gorbachev's
demands would not have significantly affected our
plans for SDI development. A more informed presi
dent might have grasped the situation and struck a
historic bargain.
Clearly, the Reagan administration has misun
derstood and mishandled SDI. Not only has the pres
ident disregarded the system's shortcomings as a
shield and a deterrent, he has dismissed its value as a
negotiating tool because of his unfamiliarity with the
research schedule. A better understanding of the
technology involved in SDI would certainly help the
present administration develop a more rational
foreign policy and prevent tragic disappointments
such as Reykjavik from occurring

out the country have publicly rejected the feasibility
of SDI as even a partial defense of our nation's arse
nal. Furthermore, space weapons research drains
our military of resouces necessary to ensure the se
curity of today's nuclear forces. Funds devoted to de
signing a "Star Wars umbrella" could be better spent
developing our more elusive delivery systems, such
as submarines and mobile missiles. The Pentagon
could deploy these systems in the near future, and
even "Star Wars" enthusiasts concede that modern
submarines "can be counted on to survive a Soviet at
tack." By limiting our military options to his ques
tionable program, the president can only succeed in
undermining the deterrence of our forces.
Regardless of these shortcomings, many policy

makers justify "Star Wars" as a valuable "bargaining
chip." Soviet fear of Americas economic and techno
logical capabilities could translate into significant ad
vantages for the United States in an arms pact. At tne
Reykjavik summit, however, the president obstinately
rejected this option. When Gorbachev offered a
shocking, unprecedented proposal to eliminate all
nuclear weapons, Reagan declined because the So
viet leader required that research on "Star Wars"
remain within the "laboratory" for 10 years. Tragi
cally, most scientists believe that Gorbachev's
demands would not have significantly affected our
plans for SDI development. A more informed presi
dent might have grasped the situation and struck a
historic bargain.
Clearly, the Reagan administration has misun
derstood and mishandled SDI. Not only has the pres
ident disregarded the system's shortcomings as a
shield and a deterrent, he has dismissed its value as a
negotiating tool because of his unfamiliarity with the
research schedule. A better understanding of the
technology involved in SDI would certainly help the
present administration develop a more rational
foreign policy and prevent tragic disappointments
such as Reykjavik from occurring
