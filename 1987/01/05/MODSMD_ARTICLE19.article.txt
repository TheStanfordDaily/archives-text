# Iran probe may reveal more U.S. corruption
## 
### 
The Iran controversy has provoked media comparisons to
Watergate, with much of the furor revolving around such
questions as who knew and when, whether a White House
coverup took place and whether the president is guilty by
commission or only by negligence. But the underlying is
sues in the present case may be far more serious, even aside
from the implications of ransoming hostages and of arming
the Iran-Iraq war, Lt. Col. Oliver North and his associates
broke at least three U.S. laws, the Boland Amendment
(prohibiting U.S. military aid to the contras), the Neutrality
Act and the Arms Export Control Act. This month, the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee is expected to investigate alle
gations that associates of the "North network" participated
in cocaine smuggling in the course of providing private aid
to the Nicaraguan contras.

SUSAN HARRISON

The network comprised North, fellow National Security
Council Adviser Robert Owen and retired generals Richard
Secord and John Singlaub, who were key participants in
raising funds for the contras while the Boland Amendment
was in effect, and a shadowy consortium of U.S. mer
cenaries, Cuban exiles and underworld figures who
procured and delivered the military supplies. Increasing
evidence suggests that the planes with which the network
carried weapons to contra contact points in Honduras and
Costa Rica didn't come back empty.
Instead, claim lawyers for a Washington-based law firm
which is privately investigating contra-related illegalities, a
partnership between Colombian "cocaine lords" and the
North network allowed the contra backers to make $10,000
to $25,000 a planeload from the use of their bases as trans
shipment points. Attorney Dan Sheehan of the Christie In
stitute estimates that one ton of cocaine, with a street value
of more than a half billion dollars, entered the United States
per week through this channel.
Reports of the cocaine-contra connection have been cir
culating for years, but the State Department has denied or
downplayed them, while an FBI investigation has
proceeded rather slowly and quietly. The administration has
presumably not been interested in information suggesting
that its "Nicaraguan freedom fighters" are fighting on the
other side of its "war on drugs." The Christie Institute,
which successfully sued Kerr-McGee in the Karen Silkwood
case, is one of a number of private groups attempting to fill
this investigative gap. (According to a recent report by the
Center for Constitutional Rights, 25 such groups opposing
Central America policies have been burglarized and had
their files stolen in the last two years.)
The Christie Institute turned up evidence on cocaine traf
ficking while investigating a lawsuit on the 1984 La Penca
bombing. The United Nicaraguan Opposition (the ClA
reorganized central contra organization) unsuccessfully
tried to kill Eden Pastora at the press conference in La
Penca, Costa Rica, where Pastora renounced the contra
movement because of its ties to the CIA and to the National
Guard of former Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza.
Christie is now bringing a lawsuit on behalf of two U.S. jour
nalists injured in the bombing. The 30 defendants are all
members of the contra network, including Secord and

Owen of the NSC, who are accused of supplying weaponry.
In addition to bringing the La Penca case to court, Christie
has presented a three-year record of "contragate" legal vio
lations to Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), who is pressing for a
Senate investigation. Among the allegations in this record
are:
• Members of the contra network had a plan to kill Lewis
Tambs, the U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica, for a $1 million
bounty offered by a Colombian cocaine dealer. Tambs had
formerly been the ambassador to Colombia and had urged
that government to take strong anti-drug measures. Part of
the contra network's intent may have been to blame the San
dinistas, the leftist ruling party in Nicaragua, for the murder
and provoke a U.S. military strike on Nicaragua.
• Jorge Ochoa, the largest exporter of cocaine from Colom
bia, was one of the two major suppliers of weekly cocaine
shipments that passed through contra hands on the way to
Miami. Ochoa is the major suspect in the 1985 murder of a
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agent in Mexico and the
murder of a DEA witness in Louisiana in 1986.
• International arms trafficker Ted Shackley coordinated the
procurement of automatic weapons, ammunition and ex
plosives for the contra network. Shackley was deputy direc
tor fo the CIA until 1982, when he was forced to resign be
cause of his connections to illegal private sales of arms to
Libya.

Increasing evidence suggests
that the planes with which the
network carried weapons to
contra contact points in
Honduras and Costa Rica
didn't come back empty.

• The La Penca bombing was carried out by Amac Galil, the
international terrorist who murdered former Chilean Am
bassador to the United States Orlando Letelier in 1976.
• Several investigations of illegal military support to the
contras (prior to the Iran scandal) were blocked by the U.S.
Department of Justice under Attorney General Edwin
Meese.
While the»present controversy and ensuing investigations
proceed, the contras continue to carry out their war against
the Nicaraguan government. Their tactics include the
destruction of public works projects and the killing of teach
ers, medics and agricultural advisers in order to increase
public dissatisfaction with the Sandinistas. Perhaps the bla
tant cynicism that is revealed, as the contra aid network is in
vestigated, will lead the U.S. public and lawmakers to
question the administration's motives in supporting this ter
rorism.

Department of Justice under Attorney General Edwin

While the»present controversy and ensuing investigations
proceed, the contras continue to carry out their war against
the Nicaraguan government. Their tactics include the
destruction of public works projects and the killing of teach

public dissatisfaction with the Sandinistas. Perhaps the bla
tant cynicism that is revealed, as the contra aid network is in

The Iran controversy has provoked media comparisons to
Watergate, with much of the furor revolving around such
questions as who knew and when, whether a White House
coverup took place and whether the president is guilty by
commission or only by negligence. But the underlying is
sues in the present case may be far more serious, even aside
from the implications of ransoming hostages and of arming
the Iran-Iraq war, Lt. Col. Oliver North and his associates
broke at least three U.S. laws, the Boland Amendment
(prohibiting U.S. military aid to the contras), the Neutrality
Act and the Arms Export Control Act. This month, the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee is expected to investigate alle
gations that associates of the "North network" participated
in cocaine smuggling in the course of providing private aid
to the Nicaraguan contras.

SUSAN HARRISON

The network comprised North, fellow National Security
Council Adviser Robert Owen and retired generals Richard
Secord and John Singlaub, who were key participants in
raising funds for the contras while the Boland Amendment
was in effect, and a shadowy consortium of U.S. mer
cenaries, Cuban exiles and underworld figures who
procured and delivered the military supplies. Increasing
evidence suggests that the planes with which the network
carried weapons to contra contact points in Honduras and
Costa Rica didn't come back empty.
Instead, claim lawyers for a Washington-based law firm
which is privately investigating contra-related illegalities, a
partnership between Colombian "cocaine lords" and the
North network allowed the contra backers to make $10,000
to $25,000 a planeload from the use of their bases as trans
shipment points. Attorney Dan Sheehan of the Christie In
stitute estimates that one ton of cocaine, with a street value
of more than a half billion dollars, entered the United States
per week through this channel.
Reports of the cocaine-contra connection have been cir
culating for years, but the State Department has denied or
downplayed them, while an FBI investigation has
proceeded rather slowly and quietly. The administration has
presumably not been interested in information suggesting
that its "Nicaraguan freedom fighters" are fighting on the
other side of its "war on drugs." The Christie Institute,
which successfully sued Kerr-McGee in the Karen Silkwood
case, is one of a number of private groups attempting to fill
this investigative gap. (According to a recent report by the
Center for Constitutional Rights, 25 such groups opposing
Central America policies have been burglarized and had
their files stolen in the last two years.)
The Christie Institute turned up evidence on cocaine traf
ficking while investigating a lawsuit on the 1984 La Penca
bombing. The United Nicaraguan Opposition (the ClA
reorganized central contra organization) unsuccessfully
tried to kill Eden Pastora at the press conference in La
Penca, Costa Rica, where Pastora renounced the contra
movement because of its ties to the CIA and to the National
Guard of former Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza.
Christie is now bringing a lawsuit on behalf of two U.S. jour
nalists injured in the bombing. The 30 defendants are all
members of the contra network, including Secord and

Owen of the NSC, who are accused of supplying weaponry.
In addition to bringing the La Penca case to court, Christie
has presented a three-year record of "contragate" legal vio
lations to Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), who is pressing for a
Senate investigation. Among the allegations in this record
are:
• Members of the contra network had a plan to kill Lewis
Tambs, the U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica, for a $1 million
bounty offered by a Colombian cocaine dealer. Tambs had
formerly been the ambassador to Colombia and had urged
that government to take strong anti-drug measures. Part of
the contra network's intent may have been to blame the San
dinistas, the leftist ruling party in Nicaragua, for the murder
and provoke a U.S. military strike on Nicaragua.
• Jorge Ochoa, the largest exporter of cocaine from Colom
bia, was one of the two major suppliers of weekly cocaine
shipments that passed through contra hands on the way to
Miami. Ochoa is the major suspect in the 1985 murder of a
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agent in Mexico and the
murder of a DEA witness in Louisiana in 1986.
• International arms trafficker Ted Shackley coordinated the
procurement of automatic weapons, ammunition and ex
plosives for the contra network. Shackley was deputy direc
tor fo the CIA until 1982, when he was forced to resign be
cause of his connections to illegal private sales of arms to
Libya.

Increasing evidence suggests
that the planes with which the
network carried weapons to
contra contact points in
Honduras and Costa Rica
didn't come back empty.

• The La Penca bombing was carried out by Amac Galil, the
international terrorist who murdered former Chilean Am
bassador to the United States Orlando Letelier in 1976.
• Several investigations of illegal military support to the
contras (prior to the Iran scandal) were blocked by the U.S.
Department of Justice under Attorney General Edwin
