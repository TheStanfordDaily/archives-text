Senior defensive tackle Tony Leiker and redshirt sopho
more offensive tackle John Zentner were suspended by the
NCAA from the Dec. 27 Gator Bowl after testing positive for
banned substances when the NCAA conducted testing Dec.
9.
Neither the NCAA nor the University would comment on
the results of the testing, though Zentner and Leiker both
admitted to using anabolic steroids. The drugs are chemi
cally similar to natural hormones, including testosterone,
and are used to increase strength.
Zentner issued a brief statement admitting to using
steroids for a few weeks this summer. Leiker was un
available for comment at his Silver Lakes, Kan., home.
Neither could be reached for comment on campus last
night. Stanford Coach Jack Elway has also declined to com
ment.
University President Donald Kennedy released a state
ment reaffirming the University's policy of keeping drug-test
results confidential. "Earlier this year, we made — and an
nounced — a decision not to discuss, in any way, the results
of drug testing performed on Stanford students.
"The reason is that any statement on that subject, even
where all results have been negative, sets a precedent for fu
ture disclosures and thus affect the rights of our students to
keep such matters strictly private."
Leiker and Zentner were among 20 players on the 20
bowl teams tested who tested positive for banned sub
stances, the most prominent being Oklahoma linebacker
Brian Bosworth, the Butkus trophy winner, who admitted
usujg steroids to rehabilitate a knee injury.
Bdnned substances include street drugs like marijuana
and cocaine, performance-enhancing drugs like am
phetamines and steroids and common drugs like caffeine.
Players testing positive for marijuana were not banned from
competing because second-hand smoke — from someone
using marijuana in the same room as a player — could
result in a positive test.
Prolonged steroid use can result in sterility and has been
suggested as contributing to the death of otherwise healthy
users.
Leiker had received All-Pacific 10 Conference recognition
this season, finishing with 60 tackles and seven sacks. He
was also named an honorable mention All-American by the
Associated Press and received Ail-Pac-10 academic honors.
Zentner was a starter at right tackle this season, his
second after redshirting in 1984.
