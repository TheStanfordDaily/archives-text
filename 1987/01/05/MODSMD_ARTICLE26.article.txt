Cadillac Desert" is an extraordinary
book. It is the big, vivid, biased and

None of this is to say that we shouldn't
have gone out and tried to civilize the
arid West by building water projects
and dams. It is merely to suggest that
we overreached ourselves.... The cost
of all this was a vandalization of both
our national heritage and our eco
nomic future. '

polemical result of six years' research
by Mark Reisner into the history of
water resource development in the
United States. Funded in part by an
Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship,
Reisner began his project in 1979 and
set off on a mind-boggling journey
through the books, articles, memoran
dums, speeches, letters and interviews

that comprise the substance of
America's history west of the 100 th
meridian. It often must have been
frustrating research, and "Cadillac Des
ert," though lively and compelling, is
also highly disturbing.
Reisner begins his book with
portraits of two rollicking adventurers:
mountain man Jedidiah Smith and
John Wesley Powell, who in 1869 was

the first white man to explore the
length of the Colorado River. Through
out the book, Reisner refers to Powell's
Jeffersonian musings about the devel
opment of the American West, and
Powell is as close to the book's hero as
any character. The second chapter
focuses on California history, specifi
cally the growth of Los Angeles and the

Imperial Valley. And if Powell's egali
tarian spirit seems prophetic to Reis
ner, then its antithesis is the atmos
phere of corruption in which Los An
geles developed. Men of the question
able character of Harrison Gray Otis,
Harry Chandler and William Mulhol
land are clearly the villains of Reisner's
history. The chronicle of the bitter sub
terfuges over the water of the Owens
Valley and the shameless manipula
tions for Imperial Valley land are
shocking.
Chapters three through 12 deal with
the Bureau of Reclamation. Reisner
treats the bureau's history more or less
chronologically, and he must have
been conscious that this methodology
would serve to emphasize the conclu
sions he works toward â€” namely that
what begins as a good idea quickly
degenerates through greed and tech
nological hubris. And thus the book's
most disturbing implications label the
bureau as a parable for modern times.
In Reisner's history, the word
"solution" is time and again simply a
transition to a bigger problem.
The Reclamation Bureau was charac
terized early on with undeniable suc
cess. Reisner's account of the construc
tion of the Hoover Dam is stirring and
accurate in its conclusions about the
dam's political and ideological effects.
The Grand Coulee Dam is another of
the bureau's initial achievements. Reis
ner argues that the electrical output
from Grand Coulee was the foundation
that eventually enabled the United
States to bury the Axis powers in a
storm of war machinery. The dam, for
better or worse, also provided the
titanic amounts of energy required by
the Hanford uranium enrichment
facility, the source of plutonium for the
Manhattan project.
After World War 11, however, the line

between success and failure for the
bureau became increasingly blurred.
Often it found itself in competition
with the Army Corps of Engineers,
which was clumsily struggling to em
ploy vast numbers of returning veter
ans. Reisner argues that when a bu
reaucracy's survival depends on con
tinual construction, often the first con
siderations ignored are cost
effectiveness and environmental
viability. Mike Strauss, bureau commis
sioner in 1952, told his staff, 1 don't
give a damn whether a project is
feasible or not. I'm getting the money
out of Congress, and you'd damn well
better spend it."
"Cadillac Desert'' becomes more
disturbing as its narrative approaches
contemporary issues. Much of the
book after the installation of the

Hoover Dam deals with instance after
instance of pork-barreling politicians.
The names include Ronald Reagan,
Jerry Brown, Barry Goldwater, Alan
Cranston, Frank Church and many
others. There is also an unsettling
number of abuses of federal irrigation
laws by giant agribusiness concerns.
Standard Oil, Tenneco, Prudential,
Southern Pacific and J. G. Boswell are
among the worst offenders in what
amounts, Reisner asserts, to the second
largest experiment with socialism in
United States history, behind only the
defense industry.
Reisner determines that the worst
problems are not the abuses of the past
or present, but the catastrophes inevi
table in the future: empty groundwater
aquifers, the massive debt resulting
from prestidigitation with cost

efficiency studies, the likely silting-up
of giant reservoirs and, worst of all,
the increasing salinity of farmlands, of
which the problems at Kesterson res
ervoir and Kern County in the San Joa
quin Valley are only mild foretastes.
"None of this," Reisner writes, "is to
say that we shouldn't have gone out
and tried to civilize the arid West by
building water projects and dams. It is
merely to suggest that we overreached
ourselves." In the end, passionate
biases aside, Reisner reveals that his
monumental effort is not a call to revo
lution. He suggests that such an oppor
tunity may already be past, and he ad
vocates conservatism and self
awareness. "The cost of all this," he
concludes, "was a vandalization of
both our national heritage and our
economic future."
