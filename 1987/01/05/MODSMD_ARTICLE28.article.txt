## Card beats UCLA for first time 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
At times, the Stanford women's bas
ketball team plays like it belongs
among the nation's elite. Other times,
it mirrors the frustrated squads of past
losing seasons.
In a game that was even more un
even than the 72-59 score would indi
cate, the USC Trojans preserved Stan

ford's tie with its past, while continuing
their perennial dominance over the
Cardinal.
The Cardinal (7-4 overall) fell to 1-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference. The
Trojans evened their conference
record to 1-1, rebounding after a stun
ning 102-85 loss to Berkeley in their
Pac-10 opener.
Junior college transfer Monica Lamb
and forward Cherie Nelson headed an

unstoppable inside game that gave
USC control of the contest by the end
of the first half.
Nelson and the 6-foot-6 Lamb
dominated the boards at both ends of
the court as the Ladies of Troy sprinted
to a comfortable 38-22 halftime lead.
Nelson's 10 rebounds helped give USC
a decided advantage in this category,
21-11.
Lamb's 15 points in the second half
kept Stanford at a safe distance for the
remainder of the contest. She finished
with a game-high 25 points while Nel
son pulled down a phenomenal 20
rebounds for the Trojans.
"The score really didn't reflect how
bad it was," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "We didn't have the con
sistent inside scoring that they did.
When our (inside) people don't play
well, we don't win."
The Cardinal didn't win against the
Trojans for the 11th consecutive time.
However, Stanford did manage to halt
a 14-game losing streak against another
southern California foe Friday night at
Maples Pavilion.
Freshman guard Jennifer Azzi
buried two free throws with three
seconds left to give the Cardinal 62-60
win over the UCLA Bruins. Azzi
finished with eight points, eight assists
and five steals.
Jill Yanke also helped break the
UCLA jinx by scoring a season-high 18
points to pace the Cardinal to its first
ever Pac-10 victory.
Over the Christmas break, Stanford
added three other wins against San
Jose State, Rice and Nebraska by scores
of 94-43, 78-67 and 68-65, respectively.
Probably the Cardinal's most im
pressive showing, however, came in a
losing effort.
In the championship game of the in
augural Lucky/Cardinal Basketball
Classic, Stanford lost to the Virginia
Cavaliers, 69-66, but undoubtedly
gained some recognition by battling
down to the wire with the seventh
ranked team in the nation.
A quick Cavalier unit, headed by
tournament MVP Donna Holt, main
tained a slight lead for most of the con
test. But the talented Cavs threatened
to break open the contest with 13:34
left to play when Holt hit a four-foot
jumper to give Virginia a seemingly in
surmountable 49-39 lead.
But the 5-foot-7 Azzi, a native of Oak
Ridge, Tenn., commanded a Cardinal
charge that brought Stanford back
within one at 55-54. The freshman's
spectacular one-arm, slingshot assists
delighted the 500 fans in attendance.

Sophomore forward Evon Asforis, who has spent much of the season
injured, had an excellent outing in Stanford's 62-60 win against UCLA at
home, finishing second in rebounds.
ginia leading 69-66, Stanford forward
Kami Anderson released a 12-foot
jumper just as teammate Erica Mueser
was knocked down by a Cavalier

Anderson's shot shredded the net,
but instead of counting the basket and
the simultaneous foul on Mueser, ref

eree Larry Sheppard disallowed the
basket, saying the foul occurred before
the shot.
After the game, Virginia Coach
Debbie Ryan praised the young and
feisty Cardinal team.
"Stanford definitely wasn't playing

that they had the capability of playing
us tough. They are a great team and of

entire game."

level."
In the fourth game, Nebraska
charged to an 11-2 lead, and the crowd
began to get ready for the following
match, which featured host UOP. The
Cardinal refused to go down easy,
though. The spikers closed to 14-6,
then fought off five match points and
moved to 14-10.
For match point number six,
however, Stanford blockers were
called in the net, and Nebraska became
the first team not from California or
Hawaii to reach the NCAA final.
The second semifinal held little
drama. Texas was only able to stay on
the court for 75 minutes against top
ranked UOP but nearly managed to
win a game. Pacific's 15-6, 15-1, 16-14
victory sent it into the final with an al
most perfect record in postseason,
having dropped only one game.
The most impressive thing about the
Tigers, a team that had a 15-1 game
record in the post season playing four
teams in the top seven, is that they have
no seniors. The Cardinal can have
hope, however, as it loses only two
outside hitters, the same position UOP
was in after last season.

Sophomore forward Evon Asforis, who has spent much of the season
injured, had an excellent outing in Stanford's 62-60 win against UCLA at
home, finishing second in rebounds.
ginia leading 69-66, Stanford forward
Kami Anderson released a 12-foot
jumper just as teammate Erica Mueser
was knocked down by a Cavalier
defender.
Anderson's shot shredded the net,
but instead of counting the basket and
the simultaneous foul on Mueser, ref

eree Larry Sheppard disallowed the
basket, saying the foul occurred before
the shot.
After the game, Virginia Coach
Debbie Ryan praised the young and
feisty Cardinal team.
"Stanford definitely wasn't playing
over their heads," she said. "We knew
that they had the capability of playing
us tough. They are a great team and of
course they are well-schooled. They
scouted us well and played tough the
entire game."

night. We just didn't play up to their
level."
In the fourth game, Nebraska
charged to an 11-2 lead, and the crowd
began to get ready for the following
match, which featured host UOP. The
Cardinal refused to go down easy,
though. The spikers closed to 14-6,
then fought off five match points and
moved to 14-10.
For match point number six,
however, Stanford blockers were
called in the net, and Nebraska became
the first team not from California or
Hawaii to reach the NCAA final.
The second semifinal held little
drama. Texas was only able to stay on
the court for 75 minutes against top
ranked UOP but nearly managed to
win a game. Pacific's 15-6, 15-1, 16-14
victory sent it into the final with an al
most perfect record in postseason,
having dropped only one game.
The most impressive thing about the
Tigers, a team that had a 15-1 game
record in the post season playing four
teams in the top seven, is that they have
no seniors. The Cardinal can have
hope, however, as it loses only two
outside hitters, the same position UOP
was in after last season.
Plus next year's Final Four won't be
in the Spanos Center.
At times, the Stanford women's bas
ketball team plays like it belongs
among the nation's elite. Other times,
it mirrors the frustrated squads of past
losing seasons.
In a game that was even more un
even than the 72-59 score would indi
cate, the USC Trojans preserved Stan

ford's tie with its past, while continuing
their perennial dominance over the
Cardinal.
The Cardinal (7-4 overall) fell to 1-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference. The
Trojans evened their conference
record to 1-1, rebounding after a stun
ning 102-85 loss to Berkeley in their
Pac-10 opener.
Junior college transfer Monica Lamb
and forward Cherie Nelson headed an

unstoppable inside game that gave
USC control of the contest by the end
of the first half.
Nelson and the 6-foot-6 Lamb
dominated the boards at both ends of
the court as the Ladies of Troy sprinted
to a comfortable 38-22 halftime lead.
Nelson's 10 rebounds helped give USC
a decided advantage in this category,
21-11.
Lamb's 15 points in the second half
kept Stanford at a safe distance for the
remainder of the contest. She finished
with a game-high 25 points while Nel
son pulled down a phenomenal 20
rebounds for the Trojans.
"The score really didn't reflect how
bad it was," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "We didn't have the con
sistent inside scoring that they did.
When our (inside) people don't play
well, we don't win."
The Cardinal didn't win against the
Trojans for the 11th consecutive time.
However, Stanford did manage to halt
a 14-game losing streak against another
southern California foe Friday night at
Maples Pavilion.
Freshman guard Jennifer Azzi
buried two free throws with three
seconds left to give the Cardinal 62-60
win over the UCLA Bruins. Azzi
finished with eight points, eight assists
and five steals.
Jill Yanke also helped break the
UCLA jinx by scoring a season-high 18
points to pace the Cardinal to its first
ever Pac-10 victory.
Over the Christmas break, Stanford
added three other wins against San
Jose State, Rice and Nebraska by scores
of 94-43, 78-67 and 68-65, respectively.
Probably the Cardinal's most im
pressive showing, however, came in a
losing effort.
In the championship game of the in
augural Lucky/Cardinal Basketball
Classic, Stanford lost to the Virginia
Cavaliers, 69-66, but undoubtedly
gained some recognition by battling
down to the wire with the seventh
ranked team in the nation.
A quick Cavalier unit, headed by
tournament MVP Donna Holt, main
tained a slight lead for most of the con
test. But the talented Cavs threatened
to break open the contest with 13:34
left to play when Holt hit a four-foot
jumper to give Virginia a seemingly in
surmountable 49-39 lead.
