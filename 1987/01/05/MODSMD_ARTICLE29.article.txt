# Stanford faces USC; goes .500 over break
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
There is one word that describes
Stanford's six basketball games
during winter break: symmetric. The
Cardinal won three and lost three,
moving its overall record to 7-5. It
won a blowout and lost a blowout. It
won one down the stretch and lost
one down the stretch. It held on to
one game despite blowing most of a
big lead and lost a game in which it
almost came back from a big deficit.
Stanford plays USC tonight at the
Los Angeles Sports Arena. The
Trojans are currently 0-3 in Pacific 10
Conference play, 5-6 overall. The
Cardinal is 1-2 in the Pac-10. The
Trojans may be without the services
of forward Derrick Dowell, the
team's leading scorer and
rebounder. Dowell, suffering from
the flu and back spasms, did not
practice yesterday. He is averaging
almost 23 points per game.
Dec. 21: Stanford 73, Oregon 71
The Cardinal's Pac-10 opener was
not pretty, but it was dramatic, as
Eric Reveno sent the 4,875 Maples
Pavilion fans home happy by hitting
a jump-hook with two seconds left.
A jumper by Oregon's Anthony
Taylor tied the game at 71 with 18
seconds left. Stanford ran the clock
under 10, then point guard Terry
Taylor penetrated the Ducks' zone
defense and dished the ball to
Reveno.
"When you play well for most of
the game, you want the ball at the
end,' said Reveno, who scored a
career-high 16 points on 7-for-ll
shooting.
Reveno's heroics should not have
been necessary, but nine straight
Oregon points turned a 66-59 Stan
ford lead into a 68-66 deficit. It was
the third of three seven-point advan
tages the Cardinal squandered on
the night.
Todd Lichti led Stanford with 21
points, but game scoring honors
went to Taylor, who scored 22. Greg
Butler added 17 for the Cardinal

Dec. 23: Oregon State 70, Stan
ford 66
A sluggish first half and clutch
OSU shooting down the stretch
made Stanford the first Pac-10 team
to lose a home game
The Cardinal managed to hit 50
percent of its shots in the first 20
minutes, but only took 18 because of
11 turnovers "Oregon State was the
aggressor, and we were back on our
heels," Stanford Coach Mike

Montgomery said. "They're quick,
and they got after us. We were stand
ing around, waiting for something to
happen."
Despite its problems, Stanford was
down only 30-24 at the half because
of a 38 percent shooting perfor
mance by OSU. A determined
second-half effort got the Cardinal
back into the game, but the Beavers,
especially guard Eric Knox, began to

rebounds.
find their shooting eyes, turning a
close game into a 67-58 OSU advan
tage.
Stanford still refused to give up,
however. A jumper by Taylor and
consecutive three-pointers by Lichti
and Novian Whitsitt brought the
Cardinal to within 68-66 with 22
seconds left.
The Cardinal tried to force the
Beavers into a turnover or a 10-second
violation with a full-court press, but
after nearly throwing the inbounds
pass away, Oregon State moved the
ball crisply around the court, laying it
in at the buzzer.
Dec 27: Stanford 83, Western
Washington 6l
The 2,821 Stanford fans who came to
Maples Pavilion after the disappointing
Gator Bowl loss got just what they
wanted: a blowout to vent their frustra
tions. The Cardinal jumped out to a 37-
21 halftime lead against the NAIA
Vikings and cruised the rest of the way.
Eleven different Stanford players
scored, led by Lichti with 19 and Butler
with 14.
Dec. 29: Stanford 57, Massachu
setts 51
Massachusetts' most famous basket
ball alumnus is nicknamed "Doctor J,"
but it was masonry rather than
medicine that the Minutemen were
practicing in the first half against the
Cardinal at the Palm Beach Hurricane
Classic, laying enough bricks to redo
the entire Stanford Quad if it ever
needs it.
While the Minutemen mortared
their way to a 30-12 halftime deficit by
shooting 14 percent from the field,
tournament host Miami must have
been wondering why it had scheduled
itself to play Yale. The Hurricanes
found out why in the second half, as

the Minutemen unleashed a barrage of
three-pointers (nine) that brought
them as close as four.
Whitsitt and Howard Wright each
scored 12 points to pace the Cardinal.
Lichti was held to six, ending a streak
of 35 games in which he had scored in
double figures.
Dec 30: Miami 71, Stanford 58
The Cardinal seemed to have a good
chance to add the Hurricane Classic
championship to its Apple Invitational
title because not only would Miami en
ter the game with a 2-6 record but the
Hurricanes were also expected to be
without highly-touted and highly
controversial center Tito Horford, who
was nursing an injured ankle.
Unfortunately, Stanford found out
why Horford, whose mysterious
departures from both Louisiana State
and Houston have left trails of confu
sion and NCAA investigations, has
caused so much fuss.
The 7-foot-l freshman scored 19
points, grabbed 13 rebounds and held
the Cardinal's inside players — Wright,
Reveno and Butler — to 13 points, all
by Wright. The Stanford trio did
combine for 19 rebounds, though, 10
by Wright.
Lichti bounced back from his off
night against Massachusetts to score a
season-high 25 points and earn a spot
on the all-tournament team. The MVP
was Miami's Eric Brown, who tallied 24
against the Cardinal.
Jan. 2: UCLA 95, Stanford 75
The Cardinal's Pauley Pavilion goose
egg remained intact, as Stanford lost its
22nd straight on the Bruins' home
floor. UCLA simply outmanned Stan
ford to win its first Pac-10 game while
dropping the Cardinal to 1-2.
Not surprisingly, Reggie Miller led
UCLA with 23 points. The surprise was
the 22-point, nine-rebound perfor
mance of freshman forward Trevor
Wilson.
Wright led Stanford with 16 points
and nine boards.

While the Minutemen mortared
their way to a 30-12 halftime deficit by
shooting 14 percent from the field,
tournament host Miami must have
been wondering why it had scheduled
itself to play Yale. The Hurricanes
found out why in the second half, as

the Minutemen unleashed a barrage of
three-pointers (nine) that brought
them as close as four.
Whitsitt and Howard Wright each
scored 12 points to pace the Cardinal.
Lichti was held to six, ending a streak
of 35 games in which he had scored in
double figures.
Dec 30: Miami 71, Stanford 58
The Cardinal seemed to have a good
chance to add the Hurricane Classic
championship to its Apple Invitational
title because not only would Miami en
ter the game with a 2-6 record but the
Hurricanes were also expected to be
without highly-touted and highly
controversial center Tito Horford, who
was nursing an injured ankle.
Unfortunately, Stanford found out
why Horford, whose mysterious
departures from both Louisiana State
and Houston have left trails of confu
sion and NCAA investigations, has
caused so much fuss.
The 7-foot-l freshman scored 19
points, grabbed 13 rebounds and held
the Cardinal's inside players — Wright,
Reveno and Butler — to 13 points, all
by Wright. The Stanford trio did
combine for 19 rebounds, though, 10
by Wright.
Lichti bounced back from his off
night against Massachusetts to score a
season-high 25 points and earn a spot
on the all-tournament team. The MVP
was Miami's Eric Brown, who tallied 24
against the Cardinal.
Jan. 2: UCLA 95, Stanford 75
The Cardinal's Pauley Pavilion goose
egg remained intact, as Stanford lost its
22nd straight on the Bruins' home
floor. UCLA simply outmanned Stan
ford to win its first Pac-10 game while
dropping the Cardinal to 1-2.
Not surprisingly, Reggie Miller led
UCLA with 23 points. The surprise was
the 22-point, nine-rebound perfor
mance of freshman forward Trevor
Wilson.
Wright led Stanford with 16 points
and nine boards.
There is one word that describes
Stanford's six basketball games
during winter break: symmetric. The
Cardinal won three and lost three,
moving its overall record to 7-5. It
won a blowout and lost a blowout. It
won one down the stretch and lost
one down the stretch. It held on to
one game despite blowing most of a
big lead and lost a game in which it
almost came back from a big deficit.
Stanford plays USC tonight at the
Los Angeles Sports Arena. The
Trojans are currently 0-3 in Pacific 10
Conference play, 5-6 overall. The
Cardinal is 1-2 in the Pac-10. The
Trojans may be without the services
of forward Derrick Dowell, the
team's leading scorer and
rebounder. Dowell, suffering from
the flu and back spasms, did not
practice yesterday. He is averaging
almost 23 points per game.
Dec. 21: Stanford 73, Oregon 71
The Cardinal's Pac-10 opener was
not pretty, but it was dramatic, as
Eric Reveno sent the 4,875 Maples
Pavilion fans home happy by hitting
a jump-hook with two seconds left.
A jumper by Oregon's Anthony
Taylor tied the game at 71 with 18
seconds left. Stanford ran the clock
under 10, then point guard Terry
Taylor penetrated the Ducks' zone
defense and dished the ball to
Reveno.
"When you play well for most of
the game, you want the ball at the
end,' said Reveno, who scored a
career-high 16 points on 7-for-ll
shooting.
Reveno's heroics should not have
been necessary, but nine straight
Oregon points turned a 66-59 Stan
ford lead into a 68-66 deficit. It was
the third of three seven-point advan
tages the Cardinal squandered on
the night.
Todd Lichti led Stanford with 21
points, but game scoring honors
went to Taylor, who scored 22. Greg
Butler added 17 for the Cardinal

Dec. 23: Oregon State 70, Stan
ford 66
A sluggish first half and clutch
OSU shooting down the stretch
made Stanford the first Pac-10 team
to lose a home game
The Cardinal managed to hit 50
percent of its shots in the first 20
minutes, but only took 18 because of
11 turnovers "Oregon State was the
aggressor, and we were back on our
heels," Stanford Coach Mike

Montgomery said. "They're quick,
and they got after us. We were stand
ing around, waiting for something to
happen."
Despite its problems, Stanford was
down only 30-24 at the half because
of a 38 percent shooting perfor
mance by OSU. A determined
second-half effort got the Cardinal
back into the game, but the Beavers,
especially guard Eric Knox, began to

find their shooting eyes, turning a
close game into a 67-58 OSU advan
tage.
Stanford still refused to give up,
however. A jumper by Taylor and
consecutive three-pointers by Lichti
and Novian Whitsitt brought the
Cardinal to within 68-66 with 22
seconds left.
The Cardinal tried to force the
Beavers into a turnover or a 10-second
violation with a full-court press, but
after nearly throwing the inbounds
pass away, Oregon State moved the
ball crisply around the court, laying it
in at the buzzer.
Dec 27: Stanford 83, Western
Washington 6l
The 2,821 Stanford fans who came to
Maples Pavilion after the disappointing
Gator Bowl loss got just what they
wanted: a blowout to vent their frustra
tions. The Cardinal jumped out to a 37-
21 halftime lead against the NAIA
Vikings and cruised the rest of the way.
Eleven different Stanford players
scored, led by Lichti with 19 and Butler
with 14.

Massachusetts' most famous basket
ball alumnus is nicknamed "Doctor J,"
but it was masonry rather than
medicine that the Minutemen were
practicing in the first half against the
Cardinal at the Palm Beach Hurricane
Classic, laying enough bricks to redo
the entire Stanford Quad if it ever
needs it.
