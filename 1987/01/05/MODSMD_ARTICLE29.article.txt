# Stanford faces USC; goes .500 over break
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
There is one word that describes
Stanford's six basketball games
during winter break: symmetric. The
Cardinal won three and lost three,
moving its overall record to 7-5. It
won a blowout and lost a blowout. It
won one down the stretch and lost
one down the stretch. It held on to
one game despite blowing most of a
big lead and lost a game in which it
almost came back from a big deficit.
Stanford plays USC tonight at the
Los Angeles Sports Arena. The
Trojans are currently 0-3 in Pacific 10
Conference play, 5-6 overall. The
Cardinal is 1-2 in the Pac-10. The
Trojans may be without the services
of forward Derrick Dowell, the
team's leading scorer and
rebounder. Dowell, suffering from
the flu and back spasms, did not
practice yesterday. He is averaging
almost 23 points per game.

The Cardinal's Pac-10 opener was
not pretty, but it was dramatic, as
Eric Reveno sent the 4,875 Maples
Pavilion fans home happy by hitting
a jump-hook with two seconds left.
A jumper by Oregon's Anthony
Taylor tied the game at 71 with 18
seconds left. Stanford ran the clock
under 10, then point guard Terry
Taylor penetrated the Ducks' zone
defense and dished the ball to
Reveno.
"When you play well for most of
the game, you want the ball at the
end,' said Reveno, who scored a
career-high 16 points on 7-for-ll
shooting.
Reveno's heroics should not have
been necessary, but nine straight
Oregon points turned a 66-59 Stan
ford lead into a 68-66 deficit. It was
the third of three seven-point advan
tages the Cardinal squandered on
the night.
Todd Lichti led Stanford with 21
points, but game scoring honors
went to Taylor, who scored 22. Greg
Butler added 17 for the Cardinal

A sluggish first half and clutch
OSU shooting down the stretch
made Stanford the first Pac-10 team
to lose a home game
The Cardinal managed to hit 50
percent of its shots in the first 20
minutes, but only took 18 because of
11 turnovers "Oregon State was the
aggressor, and we were back on our
heels," Stanford Coach Mike

Montgomery said. "They're quick,
and they got after us. We were stand
ing around, waiting for something to
happen."
Despite its problems, Stanford was
down only 30-24 at the half because
of a 38 percent shooting perfor
mance by OSU. A determined
second-half effort got the Cardinal
back into the game, but the Beavers,
especially guard Eric Knox, began to
