# Card rally fails; Gator Bowl lost
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — With 1:43
remaining in the 42nd Gator Bowl,
Greg Ennis stood 71 yards away from
becoming another Stanford quarter
back legend.
Starting in place of John Paye, who
had undergone shoulder surgery five
days before and hadn't made the trip,
Ennis had brought Stanford back from
a 27-0 halftime deficit to within six
points. Now, with the ball on the Stan
ford 29-yard line, the Cardinal needed
one more touchdown against a reeling
Clemson defense to win its fifth
straight bowl game.
Eight years ago, in Stanford's last
bowl appearance, quarterback Steve
Dils found his team trailing 22-0 to
Georgia in the Bluebonnet Bowl. Dils
directed the Cardinal to 25 points in
the space of only six-and-a-half
minutes and a 25-22 win to gain his
place in Stanford lore.
On first down, Ennis fired incom
plete to wide receiver Jeff James. On
second down, he overthrew tight end
Eric Snelson over the middle. On third
down, James ran his pattern at the first
down marker, but was forced to come
back to make the catch for a six-yard
gain, setting up fourth-and-four.
"I was supposed to go past the
stick," James said, "but Greg was
flushed from the pocket, so I'm
supposed to come back for it. I had to
come back for the ball or else it's a
possible pick."
On fourth down, Ennis looked to
throw to James again on the right side.
His pass, like Stanford's comeback,
came up just short, and the 27-21 vic
tory was Clemson's.
"That was a simple hitch," James
said. "Greg was pressured and threw
off his back foot."

Though the Cardinal lost its first
bowl game since the 1952 Rose Bowl
against Illinois, its second-half effort
kept the 80,104 fans in the Gator Bowl
and a CBS national television audience
interested until the end.
Thomas Henley gave Stanford excel
lent field position on its second pos
session of the half when he returned a
Bill Spiers punt 29 yards to the Clem
son 41. Nine plays later, running back
Brad Muster went one yard for the first
Stanford score.
Trailing by 20 points as the fourth
quarter began, Stanford went 80 yards
in 16 plays to close the gap to 27-13.
Ennis completed 6-of-7 passes on the
drive, including a 13-yard flare to
Muster for the score.
Stanford then saw Williams play
Santa Claus two days late, as his pass
for tight end Jim Riggs was deflected
into the hands of cornerback Toi Cook,
who returned it to the Clemson 21.
Three plays later, Henley broke clear
on a slant pattern with touchdown
written all over it, but Ennis' throw was
behind him and intercepted by corner
back Delton Hall.
"I have to say I think there was a
great possibility (it would have been a
touchdown)," Henley said. "All I saw
was end zone."
Ennis and Muster combined for the
Cardinal's final score on a 37-yard tail
back streak pattern with 2:50 to play.
Using its timeouts on defense, Stanford
got the ball back with 1:43 left, but
there were to be no miracles.
That Stanford wbuld lose by only a
touchdown seemed unlikely at
halftime — the Cardinal was
thoroughly dominated in the first 30
minutes. Stanford's first three drives
were a chorus-line offense — one-two
three-kick — and the Cardinal had

only three first downs and 57 yards of
total offense in the first half. The
Tigers, meanwhile, rolled to 15 first
downs, 291 yards and 27 points.
"I guess we were all a little in awe of
it all in the first half," linebacker David
Wyman said. "None of us was ready to
play a ballgame. We were a bunch of
wide-eyed little kids, and we didn't
come out to play."
"Other things happened besides
Greg being nervous," fullback Brian
Morris said. "He may have rushed
some throws, but everything that could
happen bad did. Three plays before a
punt is not enough time for Greg to get
in synch. We never got a chance to
show what we could do out there."
Clemson opened by showing that it
could run the ball, especially an option
that Stanford hadn't seen much of all
year. The result was the coaches'
dream of establishing the run to set up
the pass.
"It was an outstanding win for Clem
son," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"They're a fine football team."
"They established the running game
so well, we got trapped by the play
action," Wyman said. "That was the
problem."
Tailbacks Terrence Flagler and
Kenny Flowers spearheaded the Clem
son running game, Flagler leading all
rushers with 82 yards on 12 carries and
Flowers adding 67 yards on 14 tries.
But it was quarterback Rod Williams
who earned player-of-the-game honors
for the Tigers, completing 12-of-19
passes for 135 yards.
For Stanford, the comeback was led
by Muster, who scored all three Card
inal touchdowns, rushed for 70 yards
on 17 carries, caught four passes for 53
yards, and was named player of the
game for the Cardinal.
The game may have been Muster's
final one in a Stanford uniform. Having
redshirted as a freshman, Muster is on
schedule to graduate in June but could
return next fall for a final season.
Muster remained undecided about his
future, but all speculation has him re
turning for a fourth season. "1 haven't
even thought about it," Muster said. If
he were to return, Muster would be a
leading contender for the Heisman
Trophy next season.
Clemson Coach Danny Ford had
seen his team play consistently incon
sistent football all season long, and he
went into halftime knowing a 27-point
lead wasn't safe. "1 told our guys at
halftime that they were either going to
do one of two things — we were either
going to set an NCAA record of being
ahead at halftime and losing, or we'll

go out and score a bunch of points and
win going away. It came awfully close
to being the first one.
"We're mighty grateful to win. I
hope we learned a lesson in this one
today in that when you have somebody
down, you can't let him back up. I can
relate this to a Clint Eastwood movie
we saw last night, 'Heartbreak Ridge.'
They shot a guy, but he was still alive.
So they shot him again to make sure he
was dead. We wounded Stanford in the
first half, but we didn't kill them. We let
them live, and they came back tough,

within a whisker of winning."
Stanford was playing without All-
Pacific 10 Conference defensive tackle
Tony Leiker and offensive tackle John
Zentner. Both were suspended by the
NCAA after testing positive for banned
substances Dec. 9. Both have admitted
use of anabolic steroids, drugs that are
used to increase strength. Neither
made the trip here.
Stanford was also without corner
back Alan Grant, who was out with a
sprained ankle. Pat Kelly played most
of the game, with Rick Theder taking

over at safety and moving Walt Harris
to cornerback on occasion.
After Stanford held the Tigers to no
gain on their first possession, Clemson
marched 80 yards in 13 plays to take a
7-0 lead, with a 34-yard pass from Wil
liams to Ricardo Hooper over Kelly's
coverage setting up a five-yard run by
fullback Chris Lancaster.
The Tigers scored again on their
next possession, with Williams
opening the second quarter with a
one-yard sneak to cap a 12-play, 74-
yard drive. On the next Clemson pos

session, Flagler burst 29 yards off left
tackle to key a drive that culminated in
a 22-yard field goal by David Treadwell
to extend the lead to 17-0.
On the ensuing kickoff, Stanford's
Thomas Henley was hit by Reggie Har
ris at the Cardinal 16 and fumbled.
Tyler Grimes recovered for Clemson
and set up a 14-yard reverse by wide
receiver Ray Williams to make it 24-0. A
46-yard field goal by Treadwell that
barely cleared the crossbar with two
seconds remaining in the half com
pleted the Clemson scoring.


Junior defensive tackle Joe Lortie (77), who started in place of senior Tony
Leiker, had to face the likes of Clemson quarterback Rodney Williams (13) in
Stanford's Gator Bowl defeat. Williams, a sophomore, was named Clemson's

player of the game for his performance, which included 12 of 19 passing for
135 yards and one rushing touchdown. Williams carried the ball 16 times for
18 yards. His longest run went for 14 yards.
