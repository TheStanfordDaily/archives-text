# Card rally fails; Gator Bowl lost
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — With 1:43
remaining in the 42nd Gator Bowl,
Greg Ennis stood 71 yards away from
becoming another Stanford quarter
back legend.
Starting in place of John Paye, who
had undergone shoulder surgery five
days before and hadn't made the trip,
Ennis had brought Stanford back from
a 27-0 halftime deficit to within six
points. Now, with the ball on the Stan
ford 29-yard line, the Cardinal needed
one more touchdown against a reeling
Clemson defense to win its fifth
straight bowl game.
Eight years ago, in Stanford's last
bowl appearance, quarterback Steve
Dils found his team trailing 22-0 to
Georgia in the Bluebonnet Bowl. Dils
directed the Cardinal to 25 points in
the space of only six-and-a-half
minutes and a 25-22 win to gain his
place in Stanford lore.
On first down, Ennis fired incom
plete to wide receiver Jeff James. On
second down, he overthrew tight end
Eric Snelson over the middle. On third
down, James ran his pattern at the first
down marker, but was forced to come
back to make the catch for a six-yard
gain, setting up fourth-and-four.
"I was supposed to go past the
stick," James said, "but Greg was
flushed from the pocket, so I'm
supposed to come back for it. I had to
come back for the ball or else it's a
possible pick."
On fourth down, Ennis looked to
throw to James again on the right side.
His pass, like Stanford's comeback,
came up just short, and the 27-21 vic
tory was Clemson's.
"That was a simple hitch," James
said. "Greg was pressured and threw
off his back foot."

Though the Cardinal lost its first
bowl game since the 1952 Rose Bowl
against Illinois, its second-half effort
kept the 80,104 fans in the Gator Bowl
and a CBS national television audience
interested until the end.
Thomas Henley gave Stanford excel
lent field position on its second pos
session of the half when he returned a
Bill Spiers punt 29 yards to the Clem
son 41. Nine plays later, running back
Brad Muster went one yard for the first
Stanford score.
Trailing by 20 points as the fourth
quarter began, Stanford went 80 yards
in 16 plays to close the gap to 27-13.
Ennis completed 6-of-7 passes on the
drive, including a 13-yard flare to
Muster for the score.
Stanford then saw Williams play
Santa Claus two days late, as his pass
for tight end Jim Riggs was deflected
into the hands of cornerback Toi Cook,
who returned it to the Clemson 21.
Three plays later, Henley broke clear
on a slant pattern with touchdown
written all over it, but Ennis' throw was
behind him and intercepted by corner
back Delton Hall.
"I have to say I think there was a
great possibility (it would have been a
touchdown)," Henley said. "All I saw
was end zone."
Ennis and Muster combined for the
Cardinal's final score on a 37-yard tail
back streak pattern with 2:50 to play.
Using its timeouts on defense, Stanford
got the ball back with 1:43 left, but
there were to be no miracles.
That Stanford wbuld lose by only a
touchdown seemed unlikely at
halftime — the Cardinal was
thoroughly dominated in the first 30
minutes. Stanford's first three drives
were a chorus-line offense — one-two
three-kick — and the Cardinal had
