# Ennis starts for hurt Paye

### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — For the time
being, Stanford's memories of the 1986
Gator Bowl will be somewhat bitter: vi
sions of Clemson roaring to a 27-0 first
half lead behind a deafening partisan
crowd — a lead that proved to be in
surmountable.
The disappointment will eventually
fade for most of the Cardinal players.
But sophomore quarterback Greg En
nis, who in his first collegiate start
made nobody forget John Paye yet al
most rallied Stanford to victory in the
second half, will remember two plays
vividly for a long time to come.
"I'm going to have nightmares about
this game," said Ennis, who became
the starting quarterback when John
Paye underwent shoulder surgery Dec.
22.
Those nightmares will revolve
around a fourth-quarter interception
and a fourth-down incompletion on
Stanford's final drive.
Ennis threw just one interception in
the game — but it was a huge misfire.
The Cardinal had cut the Clemson lead
to 27-14 when cornerback Toi Cook in
tercepted a Tiger pass and returned it
16 yards to the Clemson 21 with 7:31
remaining in the fourth quarter.
On third-and-nine, Clemson's free
safety blitzed, leaving Stanford receiver
Thomas Henley with one-on-one
coverage. Henley beat cornerback Del
ton Hall on a quick slant over the
middle, but Ennis threw behind his
receiver, and Hall stepped in to inter
cept and halt the Cardinal drive.
"He (Henley) had six points, and I
threw behind him, and it was picked,"
Ennis explained matter-of-factly, speak
ing as though he still could not believe
he had missed his target on the play. "I
didn't set my feet, and I didn't deliver
the ball like I should have Thomas
beat him inside. I just didn't get it to
him."
Ennis got another chance with 3:18
left in the game, and this time he made
the most of it. The Clemson defense,
knowing that Stanford had to score
quickly, dropped back into a prevent
defense as the Cardinal started from its
own 43-yard line.
Ennis did not panic. Rather, he led
Stanford down the field in three plays,
using just 28 seconds to put the ball in
the end zone. Ennis capped the drive
with an impressive 37-yard strike to
running back Brad Muster over the
middle.
When the Cardinal held on defense
and forced Clemson to punt with less
than two minutes remaining on the
clock, Ennis was back out on the field
with a chance to cap the greatest come
back in Gator Bowl history.
But the Cardinal rally came up just
short as Ennis' fourth-and-four pass
from the Stanford 35 bounced well
short of wide receiver Jeff James. "That
was a simple hitch call," James said of
the critical play. "Greg got pressured
and had to throw it quickly."
So instead of becoming the hero,
Ennis left people wondering whether a
Stanford team with Paye could have

won the game. How much had the
Cardinal missed its senior quarter
back?
"He (Pave) was our starting quarter
back, and any time you miss your
starters, you're not playing with pos
sibly your best people," Muster said.
"John's a great competitor, but 1 think
it was more of a team failure in the first
half rather than any one individual."
James did not want to use Paye's ab
sence as an excuse. "1 don't want to say
that we didn't miss John Paye, but Greg
did as well as you could expect, "James
said. "I don't think John could have
played any better or got any more
done today."
Considering his college playing ex
perience was very limited prior to the
Gator Bowl, Ennis' performance was
very respectable in many ways. His
teammates cited his composure and
his ability to read the Clemson
defenses.
"He didn't make any bad decisions
today like you would expect," James
said. "He was confident and taking
charge. Several times he made his own
calls, and they were very good calls."
For the game, Ennis was 20 of 40 for
168 yards. It was not the numbers that
disappointed the 6-fcxit-2 sophomore.
Rather, it was the location of the in

completions that disturbed Ennis.
Many of his passes landed far short of
the intended receiver, and others
sailed too far. "I was really tight," he
said. "1 wasn't following through like 1
should have."
Though others suggested that he
had been put in a very difficult situa
tion, Ennis accepted no excuses. "I've
said all week I'm my own worst critic,
and if I had to grade my performance
today it wouldn't be passing. What 1
consider a good game is a win."
Ennis' teammates were far less criti
cal. "1 thought he played a decent
game," Henley said. "Some things he
didn't do too well, but Greg's a great
athlete. He's got a future in front of
him, and he'll pick up the pieces."
"He didn't spoil my confidence in
him," Muster said of Ennis. "He did
everything we asked him to do. He got
us three touchdowns."
Surrounded by a pack ot reporters
for almost an hour after the game, En
nis repeated the same phrase time and
again. "I've been wanting to start here
ever since I got here," he said. "1 just
wish 1 would have taken better advan
tage of it."
Judging by his teammates' com
ments, Ennis should get another

that we didn't miss John Paye, but Greg
did as well as you could expect, "James
said. "I don't think John could have
played any better or got any more
done today."
Considering his college playing ex
perience was very limited prior to the
Gator Bowl, Ennis' performance was
very respectable in many ways. His
teammates cited his composure and
his ability to read the Clemson
defenses.
"He didn't make any bad decisions
today like you would expect," James
said. "He was confident and taking
charge. Several times he made his own
calls, and they were very good calls."
For the game, Ennis was 20 of 40 for
168 yards. It was not the numbers that
disappointed the 6-fcxit-2 sophomore.
Rather, it was the location of the in

completions that disturbed Ennis.
Many of his passes landed far short of
the intended receiver, and others
sailed too far. "I was really tight," he
said. "1 wasn't following through like 1
should have."
Though others suggested that he
had been put in a very difficult situa
tion, Ennis accepted no excuses. "I've
said all week I'm my own worst critic,
and if I had to grade my performance
today it wouldn't be passing. What 1
consider a good game is a win."
Ennis' teammates were far less criti
cal. "1 thought he played a decent
game," Henley said. "Some things he
didn't do too well, but Greg's a great
athlete. He's got a future in front of
him, and he'll pick up the pieces."
"He didn't spoil my confidence in
him," Muster said of Ennis. "He did
everything we asked him to do. He got
us three touchdowns."
Surrounded by a pack ot reporters
for almost an hour after the game, En
nis repeated the same phrase time and
again. "I've been wanting to start here
ever since I got here," he said. "1 just
wish 1 would have taken better advan
tage of it."
Judging by his teammates' com
ments, Ennis should get another
chance.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — For the time
being, Stanford's memories of the 1986
Gator Bowl will be somewhat bitter: vi
sions of Clemson roaring to a 27-0 first
half lead behind a deafening partisan
crowd — a lead that proved to be in
surmountable.
The disappointment will eventually
fade for most of the Cardinal players.
But sophomore quarterback Greg En
nis, who in his first collegiate start
made nobody forget John Paye yet al
most rallied Stanford to victory in the
second half, will remember two plays
vividly for a long time to come.
"I'm going to have nightmares about
this game," said Ennis, who became
the starting quarterback when John
Paye underwent shoulder surgery Dec.
22.
Those nightmares will revolve
around a fourth-quarter interception
and a fourth-down incompletion on
Stanford's final drive.
Ennis threw just one interception in
the game — but it was a huge misfire.
The Cardinal had cut the Clemson lead
to 27-14 when cornerback Toi Cook in
tercepted a Tiger pass and returned it
16 yards to the Clemson 21 with 7:31
remaining in the fourth quarter.
On third-and-nine, Clemson's free
safety blitzed, leaving Stanford receiver
Thomas Henley with one-on-one
coverage. Henley beat cornerback Del
ton Hall on a quick slant over the
middle, but Ennis threw behind his
receiver, and Hall stepped in to inter
cept and halt the Cardinal drive.
"He (Henley) had six points, and I
threw behind him, and it was picked,"
Ennis explained matter-of-factly, speak
ing as though he still could not believe
he had missed his target on the play. "I
didn't set my feet, and I didn't deliver
the ball like I should have Thomas
beat him inside. I just didn't get it to
him."
Ennis got another chance with 3:18
left in the game, and this time he made
the most of it. The Clemson defense,
knowing that Stanford had to score
quickly, dropped back into a prevent
defense as the Cardinal started from its
own 43-yard line.
Ennis did not panic. Rather, he led
Stanford down the field in three plays,
using just 28 seconds to put the ball in
the end zone. Ennis capped the drive
with an impressive 37-yard strike to
running back Brad Muster over the
middle.
When the Cardinal held on defense
and forced Clemson to punt with less
than two minutes remaining on the
clock, Ennis was back out on the field
with a chance to cap the greatest come
back in Gator Bowl history.
But the Cardinal rally came up just
short as Ennis' fourth-and-four pass
from the Stanford 35 bounced well
short of wide receiver Jeff James. "That
was a simple hitch call," James said of
the critical play. "Greg got pressured
and had to throw it quickly."
So instead of becoming the hero,
Ennis left people wondering whether a
Stanford team with Paye could have

won the game. How much had the
Cardinal missed its senior quarter
back?
"He (Pave) was our starting quarter
back, and any time you miss your
starters, you're not playing with pos
sibly your best people," Muster said.
"John's a great competitor, but 1 think
it was more of a team failure in the first
half rather than any one individual."
James did not want to use Paye's ab
sence as an excuse. "1 don't want to say
that we didn't miss John Paye, but Greg
did as well as you could expect, "James
said. "I don't think John could have
played any better or got any more
