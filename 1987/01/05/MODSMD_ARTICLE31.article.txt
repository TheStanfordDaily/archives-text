# Clemson fans leave trail of paw prints

### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Northern Florida
turned orange last weekend.
But that's nothing unusual when Clemson
University brings its traveling football show to
town. More than 40,000 Clemson rooters —
with banners flying, faces painted and stuffed
tigers in hand, all in a distinct shade of orange
— made the seven- or eight-hour drive south to
Jacksonville to watch their team take on Stan
ford in the Gator Bowl.
"We're super, super good fans," said Clem
son rooter Cricket Davidson, who made the
eight-hour drive from Waltersboro, S C., to see
the game. "We're very congenial, and all or
ange."
"We're crazy,'' said Kenny West of Anderson,
SC.
"We're very dedicated," stated Greenville,
S.C., native Ben Busbee.
"We really like to get out, have a party and
have a good time," declared Kenny West of An
derson.
Every Clemson fan had a different way of de
scribing the Tigers' rabid following, but, for
Stanford, the orange wave all added up to one
big problem — Cardinal fans were outnum
bered about 20-1. In fact, it seemed at least half

of those wearing cardinal red were members of
the Stanford Band, which, by marching in the
Gator Bowl parade and playing at rallies and
receptions for alumni as well as performing at
halftime of the game, was easily the most visible
part of the Stanford contingent.
"This city looks like the world's largest
mobile Exxon sign," said University President
Donald Kennedy, referring to the Clemson
Tiger mascot, which was almost as common a
sight in Jacksonville as a South Carolina car
complete with Clemson bumber stickers, ban
ners, paw print decals and an orange and black
striped tail hanging from the bumper.
"I've never seen so many cars run over by
animals," Kennedy said at a Stanford alumni
reception in the Jacksonville Hilton.
But such extreme enthusiasm is standard in
football-mad South Carolina, where a loss to a
rival can set off state-wide mourning and where
the yearly Clemson-University of South
Carolina football game is mandated by state
law.
"I don't think there is another group of fans
that takes it more seriously," said Anderson
native Dale Riley, sitting in the stands before
kickoff. "I've been in South Carolina seven or
eight years, and I've become a Clemson fan — I
can't help but be."
The presence of thousands of South Carolina

license plates had Blacksburg, S.C., native
George Putman wondering who was left at
home. "Everyone from South Carolina is down
here," he said. "We had to get somebody from
North Carolina to come down and watch the
state while we came down to the ballgame."
Some Clemson faithful say the Tigers'
popularity stems from the team's great success
— including a national championship in 1982
— in recent seasons.
But others say the unusual level of support
results from the fact that Clemson graduates
generally come from and spend their lives in
South Carolina, where they, raise their families
as fervent Tiger fans.
About the only thing Clemson fans could not
get excited about was Stanford, an unlikely op
ponent in a land of heated rivalries. For Clem
son, a team that is used to playing Southeastern
teams with names like the Dawgs, Tar Heels,
Gamecocks and 'Gators — matchups that are al
most as important as life itself in the Southeast
— playing Stanford for the first time ever was
more a novelty than a matchup the Tigers had
awaited all year.
"I just know that you all are the Cardinals,"
said 1984 Clemson graduate Beverly Trousdale,
missing a subtlety that Gator Bowl organizers
and souvenier salesmen had trouble with all
week.

"It's not just a team that's across the state,'
said Busbee. "We're much more familiar with
Georgia, North Carolina, Florida State."
Almost every Clemson fan who knew any
thing about Stanford before the game uttered
the same first two words when asked about
impressions of Stanford: "John Elway."
What may join the legendary quarterback in
the minds of Clemson fans long after memories
of the Tigers' 27-21 victory have faded is the
Stanford Band. The Band performed in its usual
manner, shocking and delighting Clemson fans,
some of whom were disappointed that the
Band did not repeat some of the antics that
earned it a suspension earlier in the season.
"I was disappointed I wasn't mooned," said
Molly Wannamaker, a Simpsonville, S.C., native.
"I read all about getting mooned and having
beer and donuts for breakfast, and I was a little
disappointed."
Clemson fans had read in the papers all week
about the Stanford Band, and they expected a
little of the misbehavior that made it a big story
as far away from Stanford as the rural hills
around Clemson, S C. A column in the the Jack
sonville Journal said questions about Stanford's
Band outnumbered questions about the team
by 10-1.
Stanford Band Manager Jeff Stevens sensed
the media interest in the group soon after arriv

ing in Jacksonville 36 hours before the game.
"Everyone's really wondering what the Stan
ford Band is all about," he said. "We've stirred a
lot of interest."
Despite not witnessing any questionable an
tics, Clemson fans were impressed. Ive never
seen anything like it," said Jim Wannamaker. 1
thought they'd spell out some dirty words. They
were a little more conservative than 1 d read in
the paper."
The Band marched the morning before the
game in the Gator Bowl parade, shaking hands
with spectators and running over pedestrian
walkways. At halftime of the game, the Band of
fered a musical review of 1986, featuring events
ranging from the Iran arms deals to the Band's
own encounter with controversy.
Several members of the Clemson band
hesitatingly said they prefer their flag-wielding :
precision-marching style to Stanford s free
spirited, sometimes irreverent performances.
Clemson, they said, is a conservative school that
would not tolerate such lack of discipline.
"God forbid the Clemson band ever got like
that," said Molly Wannamaker, a long-time
Clemson fan. "I could see all the alumni now,
falling over one at a time.
"It's a different kind of entertainment," she
said, "the difference between vaudeville and an
opera."
