# Elway leads Denver win
## 
### 
DENVER (AP) — John Elway, operating on a wobbly left
ankle, fired a 48-yard scoring pass to Vance Johnson on the
final play of the third quarter, lifting the injury-riddled Den
ver Broncos to a 22-17 NFL playoff victory over the New Eng
land Patriots yesterday.
With the victory, the Broncos advanced to the American
Conference championship game against the Cleveland
Browns next Sunday in Cleveland.
Elway, whose first-period penalty cost the Broncos a pos
sible touchdown, scrambled 22 yards for a second-quarter
score, directed a time-consuming third-period drive for a
field goal, then hit Johnson for the game-winner.
Johnson raced toward the end zone, beating cornerback
Ernest Gibson and hauling in Elway's long heave at the goal
line for a 20-17 lead.
Three minutes earlier, Tony Eason had thrown his second
TD pass to Stanley Morgan for a 17-13 Patriots' lead. That
score came on a well-executed flea-flicker, with fullback
Mosi Tatupu taking a handoff, passing backward to Eason,
who then found Morgan 45 yards downfield for the TD.
The Broncos offense was able to control the ball on the
ground in the second half, and the defense protected the
three-point lead with a trio of stands in the final quarter. On
the Pats' last possession, defensive end Rulon Jones sacked
Eason in the end zone for a safety with 1:37 left.
Elway left the game late in the first half with a sprained
ankle after being sacked, but it was retaped at intermission,

and he returned to action. Three other Denver starters,
however, did not return.
Elway's ill-advised penalty came late in the opening per
iod. He ran three yards for what he felt was a touchdown,
but when the official signalled the ball down just short of
the goal line, he angrily spiked the ball, drawing a delay-of
game penalty. The Broncos, pushed back fo the 6-yard line,
had to settle for a Rich Karlis field goal.
The Patriots, who won three road games to capture the
AFC title a year ago, joined last year's Super Bowl opponent,
the Chicago Bears, on the sideline for the remainder of the
playoffs. The Bears were defeated by Washington on Satur
day.
Elway, fighting wildness early in the game, had con
secutive completions of 39 yards to Steve Sewell and 21
yards to Steve Watson as Denver drove inside the Patriots'
10-yard line. Elway's penalty stymied that series, but Karlis
kicked a 27-yard field goal.
\ Denver's winning score came on another long drive, of
86 yards.
With less than two minutes left, Irving Fryar fielded a punt
at the New England 1-yard line and returned it only to the
10, and Eason was sacked on the next play by an onrushing
Jones for the safety.
After the safety, the Patriots tried an onside kick from
their own 20. Denver got the ball and ran out the clock.
