EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) â€” The New York Giants
moved within a game of their first Super Bowl by
demolishing the San Francisco 49ers 49-3 yesterday as
Phil Simms passed for four touchdowns, Joe Morris ran
for 159 yards and linebacker Carl Banks led a defense
that shut down one of the NFL's top offenses.
Except for the first three minutes, when San Fran
cisco's Jerry Rice fumbled away a sure touchdown, the
Giants were totally dominant, winning their 15th game in
17 starts and 10th straight to move into the NFC title
game here against Washington next Sunday.
The 46-point victory margin was the largest in an NFL
playoff game since the merger of the NFL and American
Football League in 1970. The most lopsided game before
this was Washington's 51-7 victory over the Los Angeles
Rams in 1983.
The Giants rolled to a 28-3 halftime lead with two
touchdowns in the final 50 seconds, then scored three
more in the third quarter. In the second half, San Fran
cisco was forced to go with quarterback Jeff Kemp in
stead of Joe Montana. Montana left with a concussion

when Jim Bun ran into him just before the half. On the
play, Lawrence Taylor picked off a pass and returned it
34 yards for a touchdown.
Morris, held to just 14 yards on 13 carries when the
Giants beat the 49ers 21-17 in San Francisco last month,
carried 24 times for his 159 yards, including a 45-yard TD
scamper midway through the second period and a 2-yard
TD run in the third.
Simms, who was 9 of 19 for 136 yards before being
relieved by Jeff Rutledge with 12:29 to play, threw TD
passes of 24 yards to Mark Bavaro in the first quaner, 15
yards to Bobby Johnson in the second, and 29 yards to
Zeke Mowatt and 28 yards to Phil McConkey in the third.
San Francisco, meanwhile, could hardly move at all as
linebackers Banks and Harry Carson shut down the run,
and a zone d .'fense limited the 49ers to short routes.
The loss was the worst suffered by the 49ers since Bill
Walsh took over in 1979 and the worst for San Francisco
since a 56-7 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in 1958.
New York, meawhile, has outscored St. Louis, Green
Bay and San Francisco 133-47 in its last three games.
