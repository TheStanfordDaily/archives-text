# Spikers lose in NCAA semis
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff Writer 
It's an old saying that all good things
must end, and the Stanford women's
volleyball team found out just how true
it is. The underdog Cardinal's im
probable run at the national champi
onship fell short in a 15-7, 2-15, 10-15,
10-15 loss to the Nebraska Cornhus
kers in the semifinals at the University
of the Pacific in Stockton. Stanford
finished 24-10 and placed third in the
nation.
The llth-ranked Cardinal reached
the Final Four for the fifth consecutive
year by winning the West Regional at
Brigham Young. Stanford first defeated
unranked Loyola Marymount 15-8, 15-
7, 15-11 and came back the following
night to beat No. 2 BYU in the regional
final.
The 15-12, 15-13, 15-12 Stanford vic
tory was the Cougars' first loss since
Oct. 4, and it left the 2,000 fans at Smith
Fieldhouse stunned and silent.
Stanford was expected to reach the
regional, but LMU only made it by
virtue of an upset of UCLA. The Lions
had run out of tricks, however, and
Stanford was able to advance to the
regional final against BYU.
The matchup marked the second
consecutive year Stanford and BYU
met in the West regional final, but the
situations were completely different.
This time, the Cougars, riding a 25-
match win streak were the hosts and
heavy favorites. The result was the
same as last year, though, as they lost,
finishing fifth nationally with a 40-3
record.
The match was very tight through
out, with the Cardinal coming through
when it needed to in winning each of
the three games. Everyone contributed
heavily for Stanford. Middle blocker
Nancy Reno, setter Wendi Rush and
outside hitter Teresa Smith, all juniors,
made the all-tournament team, along

with junior setter Mariliisa Salmi,
senior outside hitter Sari Virtanen and
sophomore middle bicker Dylann
Duncan, all from BYU.
Other Cardinal players also posted
impressive statistics: Laura Olesen hit
500 for the tournament with 25 kills
and a team-high 10 blocks, Brook Bin
ley chipped in nine digs, and Lara
Asper excelled with 13 digs off the
bench. Asper also received two sets in
the final and produced two key kills,
one to end game two and the other to
set-up match point.
The heart of the team, though, was
the pair of senior co-captains, Barbra
Fontana and Brooke Hahner. In their
four years on the Farm, they never
finished below third nationally and
had a record of 94 wins, 27 losses.
The duo came through again as Fon
tana posted 29 kills and a tournament
high 27 digs, while Hahner took advan
tage of BYU's preoccupation with stop
ping Smith by hitting .500 in the final.
"I thought all the hitters helped out
tonight," Reno said. "They can't really
key on anyone."
She added, "We've been in this spot
before. I think it helped."
Cougar coach Elaine Michaelis also
had something to say about her team's
loss. "It's a bit of a disappointment.
That last loss of the season is hard to
take," she said.
"I think that they just had a nice team
effort tonight," she continued. "They
(Stanford) set a good match, passed
well and dug a lot of balls. They served
real tough. Anytime they can pass as
well as that, you can have a strong
middle. It's just good, quick offense if
you get that pass."
After one last good pass was turned
into Smith's 14th kill of the night, it was
off to Stockton for Stanford. Unfortun
ately, the A.G. Spanos Center in Stock
ton is not kind to the Cardinal. The last

Brooke Hahner, Nancy Reno and Barbra Fontana all performed well for
Stanford in postseason play. Reno, a junior, was named to the Western
Regional All-Tournament team, while Fontana recorded 29 kills and a
tournament high 27 digs for the Cardinal.
