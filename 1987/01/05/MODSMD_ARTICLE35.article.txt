# Refrigerator causes chemical scare

A faulty refrigerator containing about 300 un
known chemicals led to a three-hour evacuation of
the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building on Friday.
No chemicals spilled or exploded, and there were
no injuries.
Twenty people were evacuated while the chemi
cals, only three of which were identified, were trans
ferred to a different refrigerator. The chemicals
belong to a laboratory supervised by Chemistry Prof.
Paul Wender.
None of the containers was leaking or broken, ac
cording to Jon Moldestad, assistant safety director for
the Department of Health and Safety. Moldestad as
sisted Wender in transferring the chemicals to a dif
ferent refrigerator.

"There was no life-threatening hazard," Moldestad
told the University News Service.
Moldestad said the building was evacuated by the
fire department, which was called in case one of the
chemicals exploded or caught fire. Seventeen fire
fighters and seven pieces of equipment stood by
while the chemicals were moved.
Among the chemicals suspected of being in the
refrigerator were compounds known as monomers,
Moldestad said. If not chilled, monomers can
combine and form more complex molecules. That
process generates heat and pressure that can cause
the chemical's container to explode.
Such explosions have occurred on several occa
sions at Stanford, Moldestad said.
Alain Decleve, director of Health and Safety, said
refrigerator failure is common and that the chemicals
in the Mudd Building could probably have been

dealt with more easily had an inventory list been
available.
Decleve said the Chemistry Department is in the
process of compiling such lists, which would be
posted outside of all its laboratories. The process is
sometimes difficult, he said, because chemicals have
been accumulating in the department's laboratories
for 30 years.
Decleve said another problem with storage of
chemicals on campus is inadequate refrigerators,
many of which do not contain safeguards necessary
for storing chemicals.
"The Department of Chemistry has already made
tremendous efforts to address that (the lack of inven
tory lists and unsafe refrigerators), and it is unfortun
ate that this incident occurred in an area where they
haven't caught up yet," Decleve said.
