# Children's Hospital to offer unique care
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
When construction is completed
on the new Children's Hospital at
Stanford some time in 1989, the
facility will rank as one of the most
unique pediatric centers in the
country.
"We expect to be a major con
tributor to pediatric medicine," said
Diarmuid McGuire, director of
community affairs for the
Children's Hospital.
The new hospital, which will
house 125 patient beds, will better
meet the changing needs and ad
vances in pediatrics, McGuire said.
"We need a new hospital because
medicine has changed dramatically
within the past 15 to 20 years
We need more sophisticated diag
nostic equipment. We need more
advanced therapeutic systems," he
said.
The current children's hospital
has 60 beds and is involved in clini
cal care, research and teaching,
McGuire said.
"All of the things that we're doing
now, we will be able to do better,"
he said, noting that the hospital's
staff of doctors will still be
composed of faculty members at
the Stanford Medical School.
The new building will consoli
date operations at the current
hospital with the neonatal intensive
care unit and delivery suite at the

Stanford University Hospital, ac
cording to Lawrence Crowley,
board chairman of the new hospi
tal.
That combining of facilities will
create "a true perinatal center at
Stanford, Crowley said.
The building will feature facilities
for parents to stay with their
children at the hospital, including
single-patient rooms equipped with
a bed for one parent.
"We've developed a philosophy
here over a long period of time as
treating the child as part of the fam
ily," said McGuire, noting that the
new building will allow "a parent
(to) stay with the child 24 hours a
day."
A parent may stay with the child
at the present site, but roll-away
beds must be brought into the
rooms, McGuire said.
"The whole idea is to make the
experience for the child less threat
ening," Crowley said.
The physical design of the build
ing will reflect this attitude, accord
ing to Langston Trigg, project direc
tor of the new hospital.
"It's not a huge slab like most in
stitutions are," said Trigg, calling
the new facility "extremely unique
architecturally."
The building, with three levels
above ground and one below, will
feature a downward sloping front
and a large courtyard at its center.
It will be near Stanford Hospital.
