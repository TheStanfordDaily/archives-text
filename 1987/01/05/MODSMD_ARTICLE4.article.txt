# Students reflect on Poland experiences
##

In July 1986, a group of Stanford students
who participated in the first-ever Overseas
Studies program in Poland had a frank discus
sion of the Polish government's policies with a
leading Communist Party official.
A few weeks later, at a house in the moun
tains, some of the same students sipped tea and
talked politics with Polish students involved in
opposition to the government.
"The program gave me a totally different per
spective on communist societies and also on
our own society," said junior Lea Schuster.
"It's a prime opportunity to see an Eastern
Bloc country," said sophomore Jenny Polanski.
l'he program was held in cooperation with
the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. The his
toric city, once the capital of Poland, escaped

bombing in World War II and retains an old
world flavor. The Jagiellonian is Poland's oldest
university.
The 25 students took courses in East-West
and church-state relations in Poland, the an and
literature of Poland and the Polish working
class. They lived in a dormitory with Western
Europeans, a few East Germans and other
Americans, and received full academic credit
for their studies. All of the lecturers were
Polish, but they taught in English. Some stu
dents also took an introductory language
course.
Students found the courses interesting and
fairly demanding, but agreed that they learned
the most through their daily observations of life
in Poland and by interacting with Poles.
A few of the students went to lunch with a
Polish acquaintance and will never forget the
experience. "It was really moving after she

opened up to us about what it was like to live
under martial law," said Polanski. The Polish
woman "described in detail her friends being
dragged off the streets after having done noth
ing and being imprisoned for months without
knowing why."
Another Pole, befriended by Chip Atterbury,
"said he feels trapped like an animal" in
Poland. Despite the dissatisfaction eagerly ex
pressed by many Poles, "they are very patriotic
â€” not about the government, but about
Poland," Schuster said. Many of the Polish
people, especially students, were thrilled to
meet Americans, Stanford students reported.
Better understanding
The program particularly helped students
gain a better understanding of the dimensions
of international politics, according to many of

the participants.
"There's a lot more depth to my understand
ing of the Soviet Union now," said Atterbury, a
senior majoring in international relations.
"Before my trip, I thought of the Communist
Bloc as one big monolith."
Atterbury, who will enter the military after
graduation, said that many Americans have an
"ignorant" view of "a big bloc out to get them."
The truth, he discovered, "is so much better
than the propaganda," he said.
"I had a lot of stereotypical ideas about the
Eastern Bloc, such as not considering Poland as
a separate state," said senior Marcie Fay. Her
preconceptions were "not upheld" after visit
ing Poland.
The students also had a unique opportunity
to view firsthand the effects of the Solidarity
trade union on the Polish consciousness. "I
realized how alive the Solidarity spirit is," said

Polanski.
Some students managed to attend an emo
tional Catholic Mass held for the illegal trade
union. The Mass, attended by more than 500
Poles, featured political speeches and the sing
ing of the Solidarity anthem, as well as the tradi
tional church rites. Solidarity banners were
hanging at the altar and the particapants held
their fingers in the"V" sign for victory and
freedom. The event brought several students
"to the point of tears," according to Schuster.
Students found daily life in Poland full of
contradictions, a curious blend of Western and
Eastern European elements. There were long
lines for food and vodka, and sometimes basic
supplies were sold out. The open market for
used books was highly popular due to the scar
city of published literature; gasoline was ra-
