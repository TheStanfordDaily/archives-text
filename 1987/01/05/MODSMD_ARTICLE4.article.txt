# Students reflect on Poland experiences
## 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
In July 1986, a group of Stanford students
who participated in the first-ever Overseas
Studies program in Poland had a frank discus
sion of the Polish government's policies with a
leading Communist Party official.
A few weeks later, at a house in the moun
tains, some of the same students sipped tea and
talked politics with Polish students involved in
opposition to the government.
"The program gave me a totally different per
spective on communist societies and also on
our own society," said junior Lea Schuster.
"It's a prime opportunity to see an Eastern
Bloc country," said sophomore Jenny Polanski.
l'he program was held in cooperation with
the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. The his
toric city, once the capital of Poland, escaped

bombing in World War II and retains an old
world flavor. The Jagiellonian is Poland's oldest
university.
The 25 students took courses in East-West
and church-state relations in Poland, the an and
literature of Poland and the Polish working
class. They lived in a dormitory with Western
Europeans, a few East Germans and other
Americans, and received full academic credit
for their studies. All of the lecturers were
Polish, but they taught in English. Some stu
dents also took an introductory language
course.
Students found the courses interesting and
fairly demanding, but agreed that they learned
the most through their daily observations of life
in Poland and by interacting with Poles.
A few of the students went to lunch with a
Polish acquaintance and will never forget the
experience. "It was really moving after she

opened up to us about what it was like to live
under martial law," said Polanski. The Polish
woman "described in detail her friends being
dragged off the streets after having done noth
ing and being imprisoned for months without
knowing why."
Another Pole, befriended by Chip Atterbury,
"said he feels trapped like an animal" in
Poland. Despite the dissatisfaction eagerly ex
pressed by many Poles, "they are very patriotic
â€” not about the government, but about
Poland," Schuster said. Many of the Polish
people, especially students, were thrilled to
meet Americans, Stanford students reported.
Better understanding
The program particularly helped students
gain a better understanding of the dimensions
of international politics, according to many of

the participants.
"There's a lot more depth to my understand
ing of the Soviet Union now," said Atterbury, a
senior majoring in international relations.
"Before my trip, I thought of the Communist
Bloc as one big monolith."
Atterbury, who will enter the military after
graduation, said that many Americans have an
"ignorant" view of "a big bloc out to get them."
The truth, he discovered, "is so much better
than the propaganda," he said.
"I had a lot of stereotypical ideas about the
Eastern Bloc, such as not considering Poland as
a separate state," said senior Marcie Fay. Her
preconceptions were "not upheld" after visit
ing Poland.
The students also had a unique opportunity
to view firsthand the effects of the Solidarity
trade union on the Polish consciousness. "I
realized how alive the Solidarity spirit is," said

Polanski.
Some students managed to attend an emo
tional Catholic Mass held for the illegal trade
union. The Mass, attended by more than 500
Poles, featured political speeches and the sing
ing of the Solidarity anthem, as well as the tradi
tional church rites. Solidarity banners were
hanging at the altar and the particapants held
their fingers in the"V" sign for victory and
freedom. The event brought several students
"to the point of tears," according to Schuster.
Students found daily life in Poland full of
contradictions, a curious blend of Western and
Eastern European elements. There were long
lines for food and vodka, and sometimes basic
supplies were sold out. The open market for
used books was highly popular due to the scar
city of published literature; gasoline was ra-
tioned. Some elements of Polish life
are "so removed from the everyday
American experience," said Atterbury.
On the other hand, an Eddie Murphy
movie was showing in one Krakow
theater, and nightclubs played the
music of New York and London. Polish
jazz could be heard in the cities and a
Gdansk drama group was presenting
"Fiddler on the Roof."
"Life in Poland isn't really grey and
depressing all the time," said Schuster.
Fay said she was surprised "you could
go listen to a jazz band while eating ice
cream at a sidewalk cafe." The Polish
people are "more worried about basic
things in life, like getting enyugh food
on the table and trying to stay happy in
the middle of a terrible situation,"
Polanski said.
Krakow is "a lot different from any
Western European campus because
the life is so different," Schuster said.
An impressive history
Students also noted that Poland is
extremely rich in history. Krakow has
some fine examples of Italian-inspired
architecture, as well as the dull grey
apartment blocks familiar to visitors of
Moscow. Even a Holiday Inn in Krakow
revealingly points to a period when

U.S.-Polish relations were somewhat
better. Krakow's Wawel Castle, where
Polish kings once lived, looms above
the Vistula River. Museums, theaters
and a wedding palace add to the cul
tural vitality of the city. The pervasive
ness of the Catholic Church also gives a
lesson in Poland's unique history.
Students also got impressions of
some of the repressive elements of
communist societies, such as censor
ship and the police presence. "The
more time you spend in Poland, the
more you start to feel the presence of
the milijea," Schuster said, referring to
the military police.
Schuster said she saw movies and
noticed censorship, especially of any
negative analogy to communist
societies. "They don't like to remind
their people of what condition they are
living under."
A series of field trips was set up to
complement the classroom learning.
The most moving was a trip to the con
centration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau,
where hundreds of thousands of Poles,
most of them Jewish, were murdered
by the Nazis. "It was really a powerful
experience," said Polanski.
Most agreed there is no substitute
for actually seeing the camp."I wish
everyone could see the rows and rows
of the remains of barracks" where the
Nazis held those destined for the gas
chambers and ovens, Polanski said.
"It really hit me for the first time
how many poeple had been killed,"

Schuster said.
"I was walking around the same
grounds and I felt a kind of guilt be
cause I could just walk out," added At
terbury.
Other trips included visits to the
massive Nowa Huta steelworks, which
benefits the Soviet Union while
causing severe pollution in Krakow;
the Catholic church in Czestochowa,
the holiest shrine in Poland and the
site of pilgrimages to see the Black
Madonna icon; the beautiful Tatry
mountain range in southern Poland;
and the only remaining practicing
Jewish synagogue in Krakow.
The Stanford group spent three days
in Warsaw, touring museums, parks
and the controversial Palace of Culture,
a gift from the Soviet Union. Warsaw,
which was left 98 percent destroyed
after World War 11, gave the students a
profound sense of the effect of the war
on Poland. The Poles "think about
World War II all the time; we never
do," said Schuster.
Beyond Western Europe
The initiation of the Poland program
is pan of an effort to "begin to have
such opportunities for Stanford stu
dents outside Western Europe," ac
cording to Law Prof. Tom Heller,
director of Overseas Studies.
Poland was chosen from the
countries of Eastern Europe because
academic and political discourse is

"much more open" there, Heller said.
In additon, Stanford was able to exploit
informal contacts previously made
with Polish academia by political sci
ence Prof. Jan Triska and others.
"There is a rich history of Polish aca
demic culture to hook up with," Heller
said.
"Poland is the only country in the
Soviet Bloc where you could begin to
have this sort of program," said Nor
man Davies, a visiting professor from
the University of London who directed
the program for Stanford. Davies, who
is often considered the leading Polish
history scholar in the West, is elated
with Stanford's success in starting a
program in Poland because of the
"importance of such exchanges for the
people living in these closed
societies."
The program means a lot to Stan
ford, but "for the (Jagiellonian) Univer
sity in Krakow, the exchange is their
lifeblood," Davies said. "We are doing
a great deal for international under
standing, and we are keeping countries
like Poland afloat with these contacts."
(Before leading the trip, Davies filed
a $3 million defamation suit against 31
professors in the History Department
after being rejected for a permanent
appointment. The University now is
searching for a faculty director for the
program.)
Davies said the Polish authorities are
very enthusiastic about maintaining the
Stanford program. Jagiellonian officials
allowed Stanford to "negotiate its own
terms and suit the courses to its stu
dents' needs," he added.
"The Polish end of it was fantastic,"
said senior Ceci Evangelista.
Heller, who visited Krakow during
the summer to observe the program,
said he was "enormously impressed
with what seemed to be a normal aca
demic experience in a completely dif
ferent environment. To see students
talking openly about labor and politics
and Solidarity in Poland was un
believable."
Because many students expressed a
desire to have a visit to the om
nipresent Soviet Union incorporated
into the Poland program, Heller said
Overseas Studies would try to arrange
such a tour in the future. Most impor
tant, an attempt will be made to hold
the program in the spring rather than
the summer, so Stanford students may
have closer contact with Polish stu
dents.
Heller hopes some students will at
tend the program in Berlin winter

quarter, then spend spring in Krakow,
followed by a trip to the Soviet Union.
But for now, the summer program
in Poland will go on, and administra
tors believe it can attract enough inter
est. "My hope is that Stanford will build
its strength in East European studies"
and consequently sustain the Poland
program, Heller said.
It is important to introduce Stanford
students to "a part of the world that
hardly figures on the Stanford map at
all," Davies said. Stanford and other
American universities have been
"actively turning their backs on Eastern
European studies," he added.

An enthusiastic Polanski said she will
recommend the program to anyone
even remotely interested. "1 really
hope Stanford can keep it going It was
a great experience," she said.
The students who participated this
year have been working with Overseas
Studies to improve the program and
have been holding discussions on the
Krakow experience in University
residences.
"The program is only going to get
better and better," said Polanski.
