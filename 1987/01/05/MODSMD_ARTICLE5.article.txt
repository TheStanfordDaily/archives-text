# Overseas Studies looks to expand
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Last year was a busy one in Stan
ford's Overseas Studies office. The
decision was made to close the pro
gram in Vienna, Austria, and new
programs in Poland, Japan and
Mexico were either planned or im
plemented. And while some have
criticized the changes made in the
programs, Director Thomas Heller
defends each and says that Overseas
Studies will move in the same di
rection in 1987.
Heller cited the "de-Western
Europeanization" of overseas study
opportunities as a priority he has
had since becoming director of
Stanford's program in September
1985. The summer program in
Krakow, Poland, the planned
campus in Kyoto, Japan, and the
program in Chiapas, Mexico, this
summer are all results of the desire
to "open up opportunities outside
of Europe," according to Heller, a
law professor.
This drive toward establishing
campuses outside of Europe has

been the "most exciting develop
ment" in Stanford's Overseas
Studies Program, according to
Nancy Padgett, deputy director of
Overseas Studies.
Padgett said she hopes to see the
program in Krakow become part of
regular overseas offerings.
"We might like to see students
study in Berlin during winter quar
ter and then spend spring quarter
in Poland," she said.
Those involved with the Over
seas Studies Program also hope to
see a campus in Latin America
within the next three years, accord
ing to Padgett. A summer program
focusing on health and develop
ment in Chiapas, Mexico, is pan of
those plans, Padgett said, though a
permanent location for the campus
is still not definite.
' We're keeping an open mind, al
though we are ruling out areas that
are politically unstable," she said.
According to Heller, the future
campus in Latin America will likely
be a combination of field work and
classroom studies. "We're ex
perimenting this summer with the

field work," he said.
Heller said he has also tried to
decentralize control over the plan
ning and implementation of over
seas programs since taking over as
director. A new administrative
structure was established in 1985,
when Heller became director of the
program. Committees were set up
to look at Stanford programs in
various regions of the world. At
present, six committees exist.
Besides regional committees, there
is a Subcommittee on Foreign Lan
guages and the Program Committee
of Overseas Studies. Seven faculty
members and two students sit on
PCOS.
