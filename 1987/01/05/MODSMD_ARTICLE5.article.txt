# Overseas Studies looks to expand
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Last year was a busy one in Stan
ford's Overseas Studies office. The
decision was made to close the pro
gram in Vienna, Austria, and new
programs in Poland, Japan and
Mexico were either planned or im
plemented. And while some have
criticized the changes made in the
programs, Director Thomas Heller
defends each and says that Overseas
Studies will move in the same di
rection in 1987.
Heller cited the "de-Western
Europeanization" of overseas study
opportunities as a priority he has
had since becoming director of
Stanford's program in September
1985. The summer program in
Krakow, Poland, the planned
campus in Kyoto, Japan, and the
program in Chiapas, Mexico, this
summer are all results of the desire
to "open up opportunities outside
of Europe," according to Heller, a
law professor.
This drive toward establishing
campuses outside of Europe has

been the "most exciting develop
ment" in Stanford's Overseas
Studies Program, according to
Nancy Padgett, deputy director of
Overseas Studies.
Padgett said she hopes to see the
program in Krakow become part of
regular overseas offerings.
"We might like to see students
study in Berlin during winter quar
ter and then spend spring quarter
in Poland," she said.
Those involved with the Over
seas Studies Program also hope to
see a campus in Latin America
within the next three years, accord
ing to Padgett. A summer program
focusing on health and develop
ment in Chiapas, Mexico, is pan of
those plans, Padgett said, though a
permanent location for the campus
is still not definite.
' We're keeping an open mind, al
though we are ruling out areas that
are politically unstable," she said.
According to Heller, the future
campus in Latin America will likely
be a combination of field work and
classroom studies. "We're ex
perimenting this summer with the

field work," he said.
Heller said he has also tried to
decentralize control over the plan
ning and implementation of over
seas programs since taking over as
director. A new administrative
structure was established in 1985,
when Heller became director of the
program. Committees were set up
to look at Stanford programs in
various regions of the world. At
present, six committees exist.
Besides regional committees, there
is a Subcommittee on Foreign Lan
guages and the Program Committee
of Overseas Studies. Seven faculty
members and two students sit on
PCOS.

According to Heller, the goal of the
committees is "to bring in a wide
range of student and faculty involve
ment." But many have criticized the ex
tent to which student opinion has been
consulted.
When the decision to close the
Vienna campus was made in Novem
ber, both student representatives on
the PCOS voted against the closure.
Students who had attended the campus
protested the decison and said they
had never been informed that the pro
gram was in danger of being closed
and no one had asked for their
opinions or concerns.
Senior Karen Anderson, one of two
student representatives on the PCOS,
said less attention is given to practical
student concerns than to faculty con
cerns.
"The problem with the process is
that it is very faculty-oriented," Ander
son said. "But it's run for the students,
and that shouldn't be forgotten."
At a Faculty Senate meeting in De
cember, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Carolyn Lougee defended the
decision to close the Vienna campus,
but admitted that student opinion was
not widely enough consulted and sug
gested that student input be given
more consideration in the future.

Both Heller and Anderson agree that
pan of the problem stems from the an
nual turnover of student representa
tives. While most faculty members
return to their seats on the committees
year after year, new student represen
tatives are selected every year.
"It's a very definite problem," An
derson said. "Our first meeting was the
Vienna closure, and I came in there not
having had the background informa
tion that other members had."
Providing opportunities "that em
phasize the global dimensions of the
academic and professional careers for
which students are preparing them
selves" is also a priority for Overseas
Studies programs, according to Heller.
Heller noted that internship pro
grams for students in engineering or in
humanities and sciences already exist
in Berlin, and that internships will also
likely be part of the program in Japan.
Heller said he would like to see intern
ship opportunities in Austria and
hopes to encourage students at the Ox
ford campus to do honors work in En
glish or history.
But not everyone has supported this
drive toward internships.
"There is a certain degree of pre
professionalism in the program, and
that may be reflected in the closure of
the Vienna campus," Anderson said.
"There's a real strong concern with the
reputation of Stanford abroad."
L.iglish Prof. Ronald Rebholz ex
pressed concern over the "pre

professional, technical direction of
Overseas Studies."
"Especially in the Japan program —
and I fear in the Berlin program —
Overseas Studies appears to be prepar
ing students for work in a multina
tional corporation," Rebholz said. "It's
turning into some kind of 'pre
business' experience, and I don't think
it's appropriate for undergraduates."
Business Prof. Charles Holloway said
he believes the direction to be taken in
Kyoto is a "good direction, even
though it is more on the technical side,
because it allows graduate students as
well as undergraduate students to par
ticipate."
While "de-Western Europeaniza
tion" is one goal of Overseas Studies, a
re-evaluation of the campuses to
remain in Western Europe is also a
priority, according to Heller. "We want
to try and get away from the idea that
the centers in Western Europe are

areas that contain exclusively the arti
facts of Europe," he said.
Heller emphasized the importance
of focusing on the contemporary situa
tion in Europe."The refocusing on our
activities in Europe really involves
looking more at how the historical di
mension contributes to contemporary
activities," Heller said.
But the contemporary emphasis
received criticism when the decision
to close the Vienna program was made
last year. Some criticized the commit
tee that made the decision with dis
counting history and cultural tradi
tions.
Senior Joel Bosch questioned the
overall direction of Stanford's Over
seas Studies Program.
Heller is "looking toward the larger,
more dynamic cities," Bosch said.
"He's trying to create the power
brokers of the future in international
affairs."

the centers in Western Europe are

areas that contain exclusively the arti
facts of Europe," he said.
Heller emphasized the importance
of focusing on the contemporary situa
tion in Europe."The refocusing on our
activities in Europe really involves
looking more at how the historical di
mension contributes to contemporary
activities," Heller said.
But the contemporary emphasis
received criticism when the decision
to close the Vienna program was made
last year. Some criticized the commit
tee that made the decision with dis
counting history and cultural tradi
tions.
Senior Joel Bosch questioned the
overall direction of Stanford's Over
seas Studies Program.
Heller is "looking toward the larger,
more dynamic cities," Bosch said.
"He's trying to create the power
brokers of the future in international
affairs."
Last year was a busy one in Stan
ford's Overseas Studies office. The
decision was made to close the pro
gram in Vienna, Austria, and new
programs in Poland, Japan and
Mexico were either planned or im
plemented. And while some have
criticized the changes made in the
programs, Director Thomas Heller
defends each and says that Overseas
Studies will move in the same di
rection in 1987.
Heller cited the "de-Western
Europeanization" of overseas study
opportunities as a priority he has
had since becoming director of
Stanford's program in September
1985. The summer program in
Krakow, Poland, the planned
campus in Kyoto, Japan, and the
program in Chiapas, Mexico, this
summer are all results of the desire
to "open up opportunities outside
of Europe," according to Heller, a
law professor.
This drive toward establishing
campuses outside of Europe has

been the "most exciting develop
ment" in Stanford's Overseas
Studies Program, according to
Nancy Padgett, deputy director of
Overseas Studies.
Padgett said she hopes to see the
program in Krakow become part of
regular overseas offerings.
"We might like to see students
study in Berlin during winter quar
ter and then spend spring quarter
in Poland," she said.
Those involved with the Over
seas Studies Program also hope to
see a campus in Latin America
within the next three years, accord
ing to Padgett. A summer program
focusing on health and develop
ment in Chiapas, Mexico, is pan of
those plans, Padgett said, though a
permanent location for the campus
is still not definite.
' We're keeping an open mind, al
though we are ruling out areas that
are politically unstable," she said.
According to Heller, the future
campus in Latin America will likely
be a combination of field work and
classroom studies. "We're ex
perimenting this summer with the

field work," he said.
Heller said he has also tried to
decentralize control over the plan
ning and implementation of over
seas programs since taking over as
director. A new administrative
structure was established in 1985,
when Heller became director of the
program. Committees were set up
to look at Stanford programs in
various regions of the world. At
present, six committees exist.
Besides regional committees, there
is a Subcommittee on Foreign Lan
guages and the Program Committee
of Overseas Studies. Seven faculty
members and two students sit on
PCOS.

According to Heller, the goal of the
committees is "to bring in a wide
range of student and faculty involve
ment." But many have criticized the ex
tent to which student opinion has been
consulted.
When the decision to close the
Vienna campus was made in Novem
ber, both student representatives on
the PCOS voted against the closure.
Students who had attended the campus
protested the decison and said they
had never been informed that the pro
gram was in danger of being closed
and no one had asked for their
opinions or concerns.
Senior Karen Anderson, one of two
student representatives on the PCOS,
said less attention is given to practical
student concerns than to faculty con
cerns.
"The problem with the process is
that it is very faculty-oriented," Ander
son said. "But it's run for the students,
and that shouldn't be forgotten."
At a Faculty Senate meeting in De
cember, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Carolyn Lougee defended the
decision to close the Vienna campus,
but admitted that student opinion was
not widely enough consulted and sug
gested that student input be given
more consideration in the future.

Both Heller and Anderson agree that
pan of the problem stems from the an
nual turnover of student representa
tives. While most faculty members
return to their seats on the committees
year after year, new student represen
tatives are selected every year.
"It's a very definite problem," An
derson said. "Our first meeting was the
Vienna closure, and I came in there not
having had the background informa
tion that other members had."
Providing opportunities "that em
phasize the global dimensions of the
academic and professional careers for
which students are preparing them
selves" is also a priority for Overseas
Studies programs, according to Heller.
Heller noted that internship pro
grams for students in engineering or in
humanities and sciences already exist
in Berlin, and that internships will also
likely be part of the program in Japan.
Heller said he would like to see intern
ship opportunities in Austria and
hopes to encourage students at the Ox
ford campus to do honors work in En
glish or history.
But not everyone has supported this
drive toward internships.
"There is a certain degree of pre
professionalism in the program, and
that may be reflected in the closure of
the Vienna campus," Anderson said.
"There's a real strong concern with the
reputation of Stanford abroad."
L.iglish Prof. Ronald Rebholz ex
pressed concern over the "pre

professional, technical direction of
Overseas Studies."
"Especially in the Japan program —
and I fear in the Berlin program —
Overseas Studies appears to be prepar
ing students for work in a multina
tional corporation," Rebholz said. "It's
turning into some kind of 'pre
business' experience, and I don't think
it's appropriate for undergraduates."
Business Prof. Charles Holloway said
he believes the direction to be taken in
Kyoto is a "good direction, even
though it is more on the technical side,
because it allows graduate students as
well as undergraduate students to par
ticipate."
While "de-Western Europeaniza
tion" is one goal of Overseas Studies, a
re-evaluation of the campuses to
remain in Western Europe is also a
priority, according to Heller. "We want
to try and get away from the idea that
the centers in Western Europe are

areas that contain exclusively the arti
facts of Europe," he said.
Heller emphasized the importance
of focusing on the contemporary situa
tion in Europe."The refocusing on our
