# Prof. explores quake mystery
## 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
A research team led by Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback has
begun drilling a hole into the San Andreas Fault that will
help to predict earthquakes and may end a 15-year-old sci
entific debate.
Drilling of the 31 mile deep hole, the largest ever drilled
in the United States for research purposes, began in mid-
December near San Bernadino. When completed in the
spring, it will be an "ultra-quiet observatory" from which
scientists will monitor seismic activity, according to Zoback.
The ability to observe the lower layers of the earth's crust
during small quakes will make it easier to predict future
quakes, according to Brian Coyle, research associate to
Zoback.
The team of researchers also hopes to resolve a debate
over the amount of stress that is being produced as two
plates of the earth's crust move past one another along the

fault. Measurements of stress are important because when
enough stress accumulates to overcome the frictional resis
tance between the plates, the plates slip suddenly and an
earthquake occurs. In the past scientists have been unable
to measure the levels of stress satisfactorily.
The typical method of measuring stress is through heat
levels. Stress generates heat, and so scientists think there
should be significant amounts of heat in the rocks of the
fault. Yet more than 100 temperature measurements taken
from previous drilling expeditions along the fault have re
corded heat measurements no greater than those six miles
away from the fault. This implies that the levels of stress are
not unusually high along the fault, a fact that is confusing to
scientists.
Because the new hole is so deep, the researchers will be
able actually to measure the stress between the plates in
stead of estimating it by using the heat levels.
; If they find that the levels of stress
are higher along the fault than else
where, they may have to change the
models that are presently used to help
predict earthquakes, according to
Coyle. They will also want to find an
explanation for the missing heat. One
possibility is that fluid moving through
the rocks is conducting heat away from
the fault, according to another of
Zoback's research associates, Dan
Moos.
- If, on the other hand, the team dis
covers low stress levels, the models
will not have to be changed. Low stress
would probably mean that stress had
been relieved through fractures in the
rocks in the fault, according to Coyle. If
this is the concludion, the prediction
model will be refined, but not changed
in a major way, because the theory that
stress generates heat in the fault will
still be valid.
"Whatever we find out, it will help
us in predicting earthquakes because
we will understand the phenomenon
better," said Coyle. "The better our
model of what happens when an
earthquake occurs, the better our
chances of predicting."
The area where the hole is being
drilled has not experienced a major
earthquake since 1720. The lower parts
of the plates have already shifted signif
icantly, and thus this area is especially
likely to produce a major quake soon,
according to Zoback.
The project, which is being funded
by the National Science Foundation, is
proceeding without problems, accord
ing to a note sent from the site by
Zoback.
