# Prof. explores quake mystery

A research team led by Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback has
begun drilling a hole into the San Andreas Fault that will
help to predict earthquakes and may end a 15-year-old sci
entific debate.
Drilling of the 31 mile deep hole, the largest ever drilled
in the United States for research purposes, began in mid-
December near San Bernadino. When completed in the
spring, it will be an "ultra-quiet observatory" from which
scientists will monitor seismic activity, according to Zoback.
The ability to observe the lower layers of the earth's crust
during small quakes will make it easier to predict future
quakes, according to Brian Coyle, research associate to
Zoback.
The team of researchers also hopes to resolve a debate
over the amount of stress that is being produced as two
plates of the earth's crust move past one another along the

fault. Measurements of stress are important because when
enough stress accumulates to overcome the frictional resis
tance between the plates, the plates slip suddenly and an
earthquake occurs. In the past scientists have been unable
to measure the levels of stress satisfactorily.
The typical method of measuring stress is through heat
levels. Stress generates heat, and so scientists think there
should be significant amounts of heat in the rocks of the
fault. Yet more than 100 temperature measurements taken
from previous drilling expeditions along the fault have re
corded heat measurements no greater than those six miles
away from the fault. This implies that the levels of stress are
not unusually high along the fault, a fact that is confusing to
scientists.
Because the new hole is so deep, the researchers will be
able actually to measure the stress between the plates in
stead of estimating it by using the heat levels.
