Reagan has polyps removed
WASHINGTON — Doctors removed four polyps from President
Reagan's colon yesterday during a routine examination for a recurrence of
the cancer that was detected and removed 18 months ago, the White House
said.
The polyps appeared non-cancerous, according to a statement issued by
Army Col. John Hutton, the White House physician. He said they were
similar to growths found during previous examinations, and that there was
no sign of new malignancies.
The president, who will be 76 years old next month, entered the Be
thesda Naval Medical Center yesterday for the colonoscopic examination
and surgery today to relieve discomfort caused by an enlarged prostate
gland.
"Four small, scattered, benign-appearing polyps were found and
removed," Hutton said. He said the growths were no greater than two mil
limeters, or less than one-tenth of an inch.
Discovery of additional polyps is not considered unusual, and polyps of
the size that have been found in the president are not likely to be can
cerous.
Hutton said the polyps would be examined under the microscope to de
termine if they are malignant, and the results would be available today. A
polyp in the colon is a growth of tissue from the intestinal wall into the nor
mally hollow area through which wastes pass.
Similar examinations of the president's colon have been conducted
since he underwent the colon cancer surgery July 13, 1985. On Jan. 17,
1985, three "very small" polyps were removed and were determined to be
"clinically benign." Last June 20, two small polyps were removed and were
also found to be benign. Such routine check-ups are to be carried out
every six months for the rest of the president's life.
In addition to the colonoscopy, Reagan underwent a cardio-vascular ex
amination, including a stress test, chest X-rays and a pulmonary function
test, which measures the performance of the lungs.
"All were normal," said Hutton.
Peace talks stall in Philippines
MANILA, Philippines — The euphoria that followed last month's signing
of the first truce in the Philippines' 18-year communist insurgency has
given way to a new mood of frustration and pessimism, as peace talks
aimed at ending the guerrilla war have bogged down before ever really
starting.
The government of President Corazon Aquino is now at loggerheads
with communist rebels over exactly what the two sides should be discuss
ing. A rebel spokesman said yesterday that prospects for a settlement to the
insurgency were "dimmer than at any time in the past."
A collapse of the peace talks — which almost everyone here expects —
would likely mean a full-scale resumption of the war, which both sides
want to avoid. But without some visible progress over seemingly intrac
table issues such as power-sharing, neither side will find much political
value in continuing the fragile truce when it expires early next month.
Antonio Zumel, representative of the National Democratic Front, which
is negotiating for the communists, said yesterday that on the eve of a re
sumption of the peace talks, the two sides remain "poles apart." He said, "A
consensus is developing in our forces that a ceasefire should only be ex
tended if we have obtained substantial progress in our talks."
Much the same view was voiced by armed forces chief of staff Gen. Fidel
Ramos, who told reporters recendy that extension of the truce likely would
depend on progress in the next phase of the talks.
1988 budget goes to Congress
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration today will submit a record
$1.02 trillion 1988 budget proposal to its first Democratic-controlled
Congress amid recommendations from the chairmen of the House and
Senate budget committees that the president combine tax increases and
spending cuts to reduce the nation's deficit.
But Reagan budget officials yesterday soundly rejected any tax increases,
saying the president will "hang tough" on his budget, which includes
spending cuts in agriculture, transportation, education and other areas to
help reduce the deficit. At the same time the Reagan budget calls for signifi
cant increases in military spending, foreign aid and space programs.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.), striking a
conciliatory tone on NBC News' "Meet the Press" yesterday, said congres
sional leadership is ready "to sit down with him (Reagan) and see how we
can balance this."
But Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller, appearing
on NBC as well as CNN's "Newsmaker Sunday," said there is little room for
compromise as far as Reagan is concerned. Miller said he expects the presi
dent to "hang tough."
"He is not going along with a tax increase, and he's not going along with
a big cut in defense," Miller said. "He's not going to touch Social Security.
And he wants to get the deficit down. And for those who would say, 'Let's
have a compromise,' they're voiding one of those things."
It is that approach, according to some congressional leaders, that could
leave Reagan's budget proposal "dead on arrival" at Capitol Hill as the
president faces a Democratic-run House and Senate for the first time of his
administration.
Israel strikes Lebanese villages
JERUSALEM — Israeli helicopter gunships delivered what an army
spokesman characterized as a warning to militant Shia Moslems in south
ern Lebanon yesterday, attacking houses in two villages that the army com
mand said belonged to guerrilla fighters of the Hezbollah movement.
The action follows what Israeli military sources confirm was at least a
partial cease-fire in actions against the pro-Iranian organization during ear
lier negotiations aimed at freeing American and Israeli hostages believed
to be held by Hezbollah (Party of God) in Lebanon.
Yesterday's attacks were a direct reprisal for a daring raid last week,
during which Hezbollah guerrillas overran an outpost of the mostly Chris
tian, Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia at Braachit, the sources
said. Six South Lebanon Army men and two Hezbollah fighters were killed
in that earlier action, during which the attackers also captured an armored
troop carrier before being driven off by South Lebanon Army reinforce
ments.
Israeli military sources said yesterday's raids in Qabrikha and Khirbet
Silim, neighboring villages about five miles north of Braachit, were based
on intelligence information that the guerrillas responsible for last week's
attack came from there.
France says Libya bombed Chad
PARIS — Libya resumed bombing attacks yesterday on southern Chad
for the first time in a year, the French Defense Ministry said.
u the target was the village of Arada, south of the line that France has
held for the past three years to prevent advances by Libyan-backed rebels
from northern Chad.
Observers said that the bombing would be viewed by France as a
provocation. France has so far declined to send troops supporting Chadian
President Hissene Habre across the separation line to the north.
Earlier, the Chadian government in N'Djamena said that 784 Libyan sol
diers were killed and 81 taken prisoner as government troops regained
control of the strategic town of Fada in the northeast
Chad's embassy in Paris said the Libyans had launched a new bid to win
back the oasis town of Zouar, which fell into pro-government hands only
last week.
But the offensive was beaten back, with 41 Libyans killed and 10 taken
prisoner. Libya's official news agency denied that Libyan troops were di
rectly involved in the clashes.
Libya also denied reports that Libyan aircraft had bombarded Fada, kil
ling several civilians. On Saturday, Chad accused the Libyans of launching a
"wild and blind bombardment "of the area.
