# 9 dead, 150 hurt in train crash
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — An Amtrak passenger train en
route from Washington to Boston with an estimated
350 persons aboard derailed outside Baltimore yes
terday after sideswiping three Conrail engines, kill
ing at least nine persons and injuring 150 others,
authorities said.
Many of the passengers were trapped for several
hours in the wreckage before they could be freed,
authorities said, and the death toll was expected to
rise as more bodies were recovered from the
damaged cars. A temporary morgue was set up at the
site, officials said.
The accident — the third worst in Amtrak history
— occurred at 1:30 p.m. EST near Chase, Md., about
10 miles east of the Baltimore city limits and about 20
miles north of the Baltimore station. Amtrak train No.
94, the "Colonial," entered the same track at the
same time as the three coupled Conrail engines,
Amtrak officials said. Both trains were moving
northbound.
"The injuries apparently were very severe," said
Sgt. Earl Bredenburg, a spokesman for the Maryland
State Police. Many of the injured were flown by
medivac helicopters to city hospitals, including the
University of Maryland Shock Trauma Unit.

"The first three cars were really a mess," Breden
burg said. "They were totally destroyed. I'm told they
still haven't been able to find the engineer."
Baltimore County police spokesman Jay Miller
later said one of the dead was the Amtrak engineer.
All 12 passenger cars on the Amtrak train jumped
the track and its two locomotives were "heavily
damaged," according to Clifford Black, a spokesman
for \mtrak. "The side of one (Conrail) engine hit
against the head end of the Amtrak engine," Black
said. "The first five cars of the Amtrak train went on
their sides and the last seven, although derailed,
remained upright."
Black said that the train was about half full, which
would mean about 350 passengers were aboard,
"although it's an unreserved train, therefore we don't
have a manifest."
While no official cause of the accident was re
ported, Black said that there were indications that the
Conrail engines may have run a stop signal. "A pre
liminary report indicates the freight locomotives en
tered the mainline track, on which the Colonial was
traveling, having passed a stop signal," he said.
The weather was clear at the time of the accident.
The exact speed of the Amtrak train could not be de

termined, but trains in this stretch of the heavily
traveled northeast corridor between Washington and
New York frequently exceed 100 mph, Amtrak offi
cials said.
Bredenburg also said that there was a fire at the
scene of the wreck, which was quickly extinguished.
"There were some reports that a house caught fire —
there was definitely a fire, whether it was a house or
not, we don't know, but it's out now, he said.
The train originates in Newport News, Va., on
weekdays. On Sundays, it starts in Washington,
Amtrak officials said. The "Colonial divides at New
Haven, Conn., with one train going on to Boston and
the other continuing to Springfield, Mass., officials
said.
Officials from the National Transportation Safety
Board, which investigates transportation accidents,
were sent to the scene.
The nine fatalities made Sunday's wreck Amtrak's
third worst accident since its inception in May 1971.
The worst killed 11 people in Salem, 111., June 10,
1972. The second worst, Oct. 2, 1977, killed 10
people in a truck stalled on a railroad crossing near
Tampa, Fla.
