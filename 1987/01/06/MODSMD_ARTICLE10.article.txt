WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan,
who will turn 76 in a month, under
went prostate surgery yesterday in
what the White House and his doctors
described as a routine operation that
showed "no suspicions of cancer."
Reagan, who was conscious through
out the hour-long operation, did some
paperwork and received an intelli
gence report not long afterwards, al
though spokesmen said he would
remain at Bethesda Naval Hospital for
several days.
His wife, Nancy, waited in a nearby
suite, and her press secretary, Elaine
Crispen, said, "There were a lot of
hugs and kisses and hand-holding" be
tween Reagan and the first lady before
and after the surgery.
Army Col. John Hutton, the presi
dential physician, said in a brief state
ment: "The (prostate operation) proce
dure went very smoothly. There was
nothing out of the ordinary."
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes had reported earlier that an

overnight examination of four small
polyps removed Sunday from Reagan's
colon showed themselves to be
"benign, as expected."
Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman said the
first lady was to have dinner at the sub
urban Maryland hospital with her hus
band and then return to the White
House late last night.
White House Chief of Staff Donald
Regan visited the president at the
hospital shortly before the operation
"to transact a couple of items of busi
ness and wish him well," Speakes said.
He said he did not know what the
items were.
The spokesman said Reagan signed
correspondence after the operation
and that he planned to work on his
budget presentation to Congress.
A White House announcement said
the president received antibiotics
before entering the hospital and
during the procedure and Would con
tinue to receive them for a few weeks.
The announcement also said Reagan

provided a pint of blood before the op
eration, for use in the event a transfu
sion was needed, but it was not used.
The announcement said 23 grams,
or slightly less than an ounce of tissue,
was removed from the president's
prostate. He said preliminary testing
was done by microscopic examination
of a frozen section.
Reagan is believed to be suffering
from an enlarged prostate, a common
ailment in older men.
The surgery was performed to
relieve what a spokesman described as
"mild, recurring discomfort." The
president had a similar operation 20
years ago.
"No complications were encoun
tered (in surgery). The president's
general condition is excellent,"
Speakes quoted Dr. Oliver Beahrs, one
of the physicians in attendance, as
saying.
Hutton said the operation "began at
8:15 (a.m. EST) and took about an
hour. It was a very routine tran

surethral resection." Reagan had taken
a spinal anesthetic before the opera
tion.
Prostate tissue removed during the
surgery yesterday will be examined in
the laboratory, but Hutton said a
"preliminary view of all specimens
shows no suspicion of cancer."'
Sunday's colon examination was a
follow-up to surgery the president un
derwent in July 1985, in which a malig
nant polyp was removed from the
president's lower intestine.
A computerized X-ray examination
of his internal organs is scheduled for
today, but Hutton said all tests so far
showed no evidence of a recurrence of
the cancer.
The prostate is a sex gland sur
rounding the urethra at the base of the
bladder. A transurethral involves the"
insertion of a small, flexible
ment into the penis and through the*
urethral canal, which passes through)
the prostate to the bladder.
