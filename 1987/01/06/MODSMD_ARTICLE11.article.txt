Mass named Oxford visiting prof.
Stanford History Prof. Jeffrey Mass has been appointed
visiting professor of Japanese at Oxford University, effective
Jan. 1, for a three-year period, with the possibility of
renewal.
No American previously has been awarded the honor,
which carries with it permanent visiting status with all the
privileges usually associated with the rank.
Although the title denotes visiting status, Mass will be on
duty at both Oxford and Stanford. In the past, such profes
sorships have been granted only to persons with no other
university affiliations. At present, there are only two such
professorships at Oxford; the other scholar is a Middle East
specialist without other academic affiliation. In 1984, Mass
was senior associate at St. Anthony's College, Oxford.
Mass has been at Stanford since 1973, when he came as an
assistant professor after serving as a lecturer at Yale, where
he received his doctorate. He has gained the reputation of
being the most productive scholar in premodern Japanese
history in North America and Europe. He is now completing
the manuscript for his seventh book.
Efron wins math institute presidency
t
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron has been elected president
of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics for the year starting
in July.
Jhe IMS, as its name implies, concentrates on the theoret
ical aspects of statistics. It is centered in the United States,
but has a worldwide membership of about 3,000 statis
ticians.
Prof.: Sanctions rarely work
Economic sanctions have become America's preferred
foreign policy weapon, yet they rarely produce even modest

results and may defeat their own purposes, according to In
ternational Law Prof. John Barton.
"You can practically count on the fingers of one hand
how many times sanctions have worked," he said. "They are
a public relations gesture (that) says this government
deserves condemnation,' (but) doesn't do a darn thing to ac
turally get that government to change in the short run."
No other country has imposed economic sanctions nearly
as often as the United States. Alone or with allies, the United
States has imposed sanctions more often in the past 20 years
than have all the other nations and international organiza
tions in the world combined in the past 70 years.
But as sanctions have been used more and more often
with each decade, they have become less and less effective.
Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott of the Institute for Inter
national Economics analyzed the use of sanctions between
1914 and 1984. Defining "success" merely as a case in which
sanctions made a "modest contribution to a goal that was
partly realized," they found that the "success" rate plunged
from 75 percent prior to 1973 to 28 percent since then.
As sanctions have become more common, countries
simply have learned to work around them, they explain.
Why then are sanctions still used? "There aren't very
many arrows in the quiver of statecraft," said Political Sci
ence Prof. Stephen Krasner. "There's diplomatic posturing,
explicit armed conflict, covert activity, and economic pres
sure. Sanctions are the best aomong a bad set of alterna
tives."
Museum displays photos from 1800s
"In a New Light: 19th-century Photographs from the
Hochberg-Mattis Collection" will be on exhibit until Feb. 15
at the Stanford Museum of Art.
This selection form the collection of Judith Floch
berg and Michael Mattis features calotype prints from
photography's pioneer days, the 1840 sand 1850s,
and albumen prints from the following two decades.
Both European and American old masters are
represented. Among the former are William Henry
Fox Talbot, the English inventor of the negative
positive process, and his colleague, the Rev. Calvart
Richard Jones; Capt. Linneus Tripe, a British army of
ficer who made photographs in India; and eminent
French photographers of the 1840 sand 1850s:
Maxime DuCamp, Gustave LeGray, Auguste
Salzmann, Charles Marville and Nadar.
Americans in the exhibit include those who
photographed the Civil War and the explorations of
the West that followed the war: George Barnard,
Timothy O'Sullivan, Carleton Watkins and Eadveard
Muybridge. The young American John Greene, who
has figured prominently in recent histories of pho
tography, is represented by his austere landscapes of
Egypt and Algeria.

The Stanford Museum is open Tuesday through
Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday and Sunday
from 1 to 5 p.m.. Admission is free.
Prof, to speak on Newton
Roger Hahn, history professor at University of
California-Berkeley, will speak on "Sir Isaac New
ton's Reputation" at 3 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 11, in Cub
berley Auditorium, Stanford.
The lecture, sponsored by the Associates of the
Stanford University Libraries, is free and open to the
public. A reception in the Louis R. Lurie Rotunda im
mediately follows the talk.
Hahn was one of the major organizers of the 17th
International Congress of History of Science that was
held last year in Berkeley. His field of interest is the
history of 18th-century science. He is an authority on
astronomer and mathematician Pierre Simon
Laplace, on whose biography he is now working.
The Hahn lecture marks the opening of an exhibit
on the occasion of the tercentenary of the publica
tion of Newton's "Principia" in the Louis R. Lurie
Rotunda of Green Library. The exhibit is titled "From
Motion's Simple Laws," and it presents a detailed
look at the sources and consequences of one of the

most important books in the scientific tradition, Isaac
Newton's "Philosophiae naturalis principia mathe
matical first published in 1687. With this work, New
ton was able to provide a unified theory of terrestrial
and celestial motion, and its publication provided a
point of departure for the development of classical
physical science.
Prof, studies shifting currency rates
Fluctuations of international markets will have the
greatest effects on firms that operate or sell in only a
few countries, according to Eugene Flood, assistant
professor at the Stanford Business School. Large,
diversified firms that have operations throughout the
world are less likely to have to worry about hedging
because they are likely to deal in a variety of cur
rencies that will offset one another.
Flood, who will teach two courses dealing with in
ternational finance issues this year, has been studying
the effects of exchange rates on the prices of goods.
While variations in exchange rates can have an effect
on both domestic and foreign markets, he said, the
exact effect will depend on individual characteristics
of the product being traded.
