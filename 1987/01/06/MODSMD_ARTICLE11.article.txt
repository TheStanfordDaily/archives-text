Mass named Oxford visiting prof.
Stanford History Prof. Jeffrey Mass has been appointed
visiting professor of Japanese at Oxford University, effective
Jan. 1, for a three-year period, with the possibility of
renewal.
No American previously has been awarded the honor,
which carries with it permanent visiting status with all the
privileges usually associated with the rank.
Although the title denotes visiting status, Mass will be on
duty at both Oxford and Stanford. In the past, such profes
sorships have been granted only to persons with no other
university affiliations. At present, there are only two such
professorships at Oxford; the other scholar is a Middle East
specialist without other academic affiliation. In 1984, Mass
was senior associate at St. Anthony's College, Oxford.
Mass has been at Stanford since 1973, when he came as an
assistant professor after serving as a lecturer at Yale, where
he received his doctorate. He has gained the reputation of
being the most productive scholar in premodern Japanese
history in North America and Europe. He is now completing
the manuscript for his seventh book.

Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron has been elected president
of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics for the year starting
in July.
Jhe IMS, as its name implies, concentrates on the theoret
ical aspects of statistics. It is centered in the United States,
but has a worldwide membership of about 3,000 statis
ticians.
Prof.: Sanctions rarely work
Economic sanctions have become America's preferred
foreign policy weapon, yet they rarely produce even modest

results and may defeat their own purposes, according to In
ternational Law Prof. John Barton.
"You can practically count on the fingers of one hand
how many times sanctions have worked," he said. "They are
a public relations gesture (that) says this government
deserves condemnation,' (but) doesn't do a darn thing to ac
turally get that government to change in the short run."
No other country has imposed economic sanctions nearly
as often as the United States. Alone or with allies, the United
States has imposed sanctions more often in the past 20 years
than have all the other nations and international organiza
tions in the world combined in the past 70 years.
But as sanctions have been used more and more often
with each decade, they have become less and less effective.
Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott of the Institute for Inter
national Economics analyzed the use of sanctions between
1914 and 1984. Defining "success" merely as a case in which
sanctions made a "modest contribution to a goal that was
partly realized," they found that the "success" rate plunged
from 75 percent prior to 1973 to 28 percent since then.
As sanctions have become more common, countries
simply have learned to work around them, they explain.
Why then are sanctions still used? "There aren't very
many arrows in the quiver of statecraft," said Political Sci
ence Prof. Stephen Krasner. "There's diplomatic posturing,
explicit armed conflict, covert activity, and economic pres
sure. Sanctions are the best aomong a bad set of alterna
tives."
