# Kidney transplants renewed
## 
### JEFFREY A. SEINFELD 
After a 13-year pause, the Stanford Medical Center re
opened its kidney transplant program, performing two
successful operations late last month.
Both operations "went just fine," according to Clinical
Nurse Specialist Peggy Deveney.
The operations concluded two months of organiza
tional efforts on the part of Deveney and others, espe
cially transplant surgeon Dr. Stuart Flechner.
The first transplant recipient, Trudy Ekalook, has been
released from the hospital and has returned to her home
in Alaska. Her operation on Dec. 15 involved a living
related donor (LRD). Ekalook's mother, Sharleen Ritche
donated her kidney for the transplant.
Flechner said the operation and a second transplant
on New Year's Eve, went flawlessly. The second
transplant patient may require more recovery time,
however, because he received a cadaver donation and
runs a greater risk that his body will reject the foreign or
gan.
Neither Flechner nor Deveney anticipate any prob
lems, though, because of improved techniques, longer
lasting grafts and the great sophistication in immuno
suppressive therapy that have been developed recently.
Flechner was recruited by the Medical Center last Sep
tember to rejuvenate Stanford's renal transplant pro-

The center, which pioneered West Coast kidney
transplants in 1960, stopped operations in 19 7 3 because
of space and financial consideratons.
The new program comes after two years of planning
by the Medical Center. Most of the crucial organization
has occurred within the last few months, however, after
Flechner and Deveney joined the faculty. Both veterans
of renal surgery, Flechner came from the University of
Texas Medical School at Houston and Deveney from the
University of California-San Francisco.
Since their arrival, they have developed of a system of
monitoring patients and of administering immuno
suppressive medications, established policies and proce
dures, trained the nursing staff and recruited patients.
The training of the nursing staff continues. Deveney
will lead at least two more all-day seminars this month
on the subjects of "N-Stage" (care of physical needs),
psychological skills and understanding a patient's social
economic condition, all of which are crucial in the field
of medicine, but which have unique aspects in renal sur
gery, she said.
Patient recruitment, too, is an ongoing job and has
become "the majority" of Deveney's role, she said. Be
cause the program is new and there are similar pro
grams of equal merit at IJCSF and the Pacific Medical
Center, Deveney is working to spread the word about
the new program here.
