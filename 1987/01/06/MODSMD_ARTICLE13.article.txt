Stanford may have lost the battle on the playing field
during the 1986 Gator Bowl, but it won at least one vic
tory — that of maintaining confidentiality concerning
the results of drug testing and showing dissatisfaction
with the NCAA's faulty policy.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association maintains
it instituted drug testing in order to protect the athlete
from the dangers of drug use. Suspension from post
season play was included to provide an efficient enforce
ment mechanism.
As a result of testing positive for anabolic steroids, two
Stanford linemen were not allowed to participate in the
game against Clemson. Prolonged use of steriods — le
gal perscription drugs that are used to enhance strength
— can result in sterility and has been suggested as con
tributing to the death of otherwise healthy users. The
NCAA, therefore, banned the substances.
The University should be applauded for consistently
refusing to divulge the names of the players who tested
positive to banned substances when the NCAA tested in
early December. In a press release, University President
Donald Kennedy summed up Stanford's reasoning on

the subject, stating: "Any statement on that subject ...
sets a precedent for future disclosures and thus affects
the rights of our students to keep such matters strictly
private."
The athlete receives his punishment in the exclusion
from the post-season competition. Media attention
serves no more purpose than to embarass and humiliate.
Stanford is certainly not alone in trying to keep the
names of its suspended players confidential. However,
by not allowing the suspended players to travel with the
team, the NCAA ensured that the names of those who
tested positive would be divulged. Unfortunately, the
names of the athletes who tested positive could be seen
on the pages of every sports page and magazine in the
country.
The drug testing put the University in a tough place —
it is not reasonable to believe the names of con
spicuously missing startin'g players will be overlooked.
The names of the Stanford athletes who tested positive
are well known. It is admirable that the University did
not waver from its policy of confidentiality, showing the
NCAA its disapproval of drug testing as a way of combat
ing drug use in athletics.
