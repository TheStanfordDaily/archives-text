Vienna closure
makes no sense
to this student
I've been confused. Living as I am
in a city as intellectually dead as
Vienna, this was to be expected. Thus,
I'd like to thank Overseas Studies
Director Thomas Heller and other
responsible individuals for enlighten
ing me.
I heartily agree that Vienna is totally
devoid of any cultural offerings.
Opera, theater, symphony, museums
and the like just leave me cold. Con
sidering my University of Vienna
classes in international law and the
history of the Austro-Hungarian
empire, Stanford classes in Eastern
European politics, in art and drama,
events such as the ongoing Helsinki
follow-up conference and the recent
elections, and visits to such blase
places as the United Nations, it is
obvious that Vienna is intellectually
dead and politically irrelevant. I must
really be stupid. To think that if only I
had waited I could have gone to an
intellectual hotbed like Caracas is
really a blow. I am so glad that future
Stanford students will be spared my
fate.
Berlin is now the center for Central
and Eastern European studies. This is
marvelous. The center there has
always offered such great classes in ..
the two Germanys! Oh, and let us not
forget those engineering classes so
vital to an understanding of this
region. Moreover, Berlin has such
great access to ... uh ... East Berlin.
Wow. Who needs easy weekends in
Hungary and Czechoslovakia or great
accessibility to Poland and Rumania
from this European backwater
anyway? After all, once you've seen
one Eastern Bloc country you've seen
them all. Why, in Berlin all one needs
is a small fortune and great patience
to get an overnight visa for the Ger
man Democratic Republic.
I should have known. I've lived in
Berlin, and it really is a great place.
Forget pre-war history — Berlin has
none — but it does have more bars

per square meter than any other city
in Europe. I'm glad to see that Over
seas Studies has its priorities straight
on what it wants Stanford students to
experience. Kudos to Heller and
company for closing the program in
this dead and thirsty city.
Now let's see if I have it straight.
The Stanford center in Vienna is
closing, and the Florence and Tours
programs are fading fast. Now, if I
remember correctly, Western culture
is passe, so this is good. And as the
humanities are merely remnants of a
dead past, the people who really
deserve to study overseas are budding
Japanese-speaking businessmen,
German-speaking engineers and
Spanish-speaking pre-meds.
Oh, but we still have Oxford. Well, I
suppose we still need some foreign
language training among natives in
non-tradition-bound centers of
cultures so radically different from
our own. The program in Poland, in
which I took part, really needs work. I
trust in Heller and friends to effec
tively neutralize the threat of an open,
enjoyable and stimulating exposure to
a truly foreign culture and political
system for primarily English-speaking
social science students. May I suggest
a fluency requirement in Polish? That
would be sure to weed out some of
the intellectual rot. But don't listen to
me. I'm just a student.

Abducted relief
workers need
Stanford support
On Dec. 1,1986, five earthquake
relief workers associated with
FEDECOOPADES, the federation of
Agricultural Cooperatives of El Sal
vador, were seized by armed, non
uniformed men reported to be from
the National Police in El Salvador.
Four of the workers, Edelvina .
Vasques, Adela Margarita Naverette,
David Roland Oliva and Felipe
Ramirez, were eating their midday
meal in a restaurant in San Salvador

when they were taken by force to an
unknown location. The fifth worker,
Celso Antionio Rivas, director of
FEDECOOPADES relief warehouse in
San Jacinto, was seized after armed,
non-uniformed police surrounded the
relief warehouse. He is also being
held in an unknown location.
In June 1986, Michael Stone, a
graduate of Stanford's Latin American
Studies Program and a volunteer for
PASMAC, the Palo Alto-Stanford Medi
cal Aid Committee for Central
America, visited the FEDECOOPADES
project and returned with a report of
the tremendous effort
FEDECOOPADES has made toward
resettlement of thousands of families
displaced due to the ongoing war in
El Salvador. PASMAC, a registered
student organization here at Stanford,
committed to provide $10,000 worth
of medical aid to the health care
project within FEDOCOOPADES. The
detention of the FEDOCOOPADES
workers last month has deeply af
fected PASMAC volunteers. We are
concerned for the lives of these dedi
cated workers!
Persons captured by the security
forces in El Salvador can be held
incommunicado for up to 15 days.
Americas Watch and other human
rights organizations have reported
that this is the time when people are
most frequently tortured.
We urge the members of the Stan
ford community to respond to this
urgent matter by telegramming Salva
doran President Jose Duarte and
demanding the release of the five
FEDOCOOPADES workers who were
involved in humanitarian aid to vic
tims of the October earthquake.
Telegram the U.S. Embassy in San
Salvador and ask your representative
there to investigate the detention of
the FEDECOOPADES workers. West
ern Union's number is 1-800-325-
6000. BAUD'S number is 1-800-523-
7660. Both these organizations will
send your telegrams as soon as your
message is received.
Please call! Let the security forces
and the government of EI Salvador
know that the world is watching.
