# Don't change program in Florence
## 
### 
I am disturbed by rumors that major changes are
envisioned for the Overseas Studies Program in Italy.
I am especially disturbed because 1 feel these
changes may be inspired more by a desire for change
itself than by any realistic appraisal of the situation. It
is understandable that a new director of the Overseas
Studies Program would want to make changes, but 1
would urge him "not to fix something that ain't
broke."'

GUELFO FRULLA

The Florence share in the success of the Overseas
Studies Program as a whole is indisputable. One
need only ask the students and faculty who have
been there and are familiar with it.s achievements.
Since its inception in 1960. it has been blessed by a
superb staff, beginning with Italian Prof. Giuseppe
Mammarella, the director and an outstanding scholar
and administrator, and by such gifted and devoted
teachers as Maria Fossi Todorov (one of the curators
of the Uffizi Gallery), Professor D'Alimonte and lan
guage instructors Franca Celli and Lucia Benini. I
don't know what effect the rumored changes would
have on this team, but it would be a great loss if it
were broken up after 26 years of devoted service.
I am not here concerning myself with the question
of whether or not the Villa Salviatino, the present lo
cation of the campus, or any villa, is a gix>d idea. That
is an administrative problem involving economic and
other factors (hat I am not fully privy to. I am inc lined
to feel that the villa should not be dropped until we
are sure that the alternatives to it make sense.
And what are those alternatives? One of the recom
mendations in the air suggests that Stanford under
graduates in Italy could, with a little souped-up lan
guage tutoring, be able to engage in focused pro
grams taught in Italian or to engage in graduate level

university study in Italy. Such recommendations
ignore the fundamental gap in language preparation
between undergraduates in Italian and those in
French, Spanish and German.
In contrast to French. Spanish or German, Italian is
generally unsustained by any language preparation
prior to university-level course work. This lack of
Italian study at the high school level ( which is partic
ularly true of California and the West, where most
Stanford students come from) means that Italian
studies are outpaced by other language-culture
literature programs with a broad secondary base.
Hence, Stanford students entering the overseas pro
grams in these other languages have a great head
start. Those in Italian must start from scratch and go
abroad with only one year of study in the language.
It is in this context that I respond to the incredible
proposal made by Political Science Prof. Philippe
Schmitter, chairman of the Mediterranean Studies
Committee, to send our students to a private institu
tion in Florence in order to develop their conversa
tional skills in Italian. By this means he proposes to
ready the Italy students for focused programs or
graduate-level university study. Does Prof. Schmitter
really believe that Berlitzing our students in this way
will achieve what our own splendid staff at the
Florence center could not achieve? The proposal not
only ignores reality, it ignores the splendid language
instruction the Florence staff has, for 26 years, been
offering.
Rumors that the Italian program would be
changed have already resulted in severe damage to
the Italian program at Stanford. There was this year
an unheard of 17 percent drop in enrollment in our
home campus Italian courses! This is a hard blow to
Italian studies just when the number of Italian profes
sors has been tripled to prepare for the newly ap
proved doctoral program in Italian. It is an especially
hard blow since the changes in the overseas program

have not been carefully defined nor — dare I say it?
— even thought through. It seems to me that the
Overseas Studies Office should know what it is doing
before it lets out such damaging rumors.
Finally, I would like to say a word about the value
of the Stanford campus in Italy and its program in
general. Florence, the city, is not only the cradle of
humanism but also of democracy. Her belief in indi
vidual dignity, her trust in checks and balances, her
achievements in coping with the meaning of respon
sible citizenship, have made this unique city an ideal
place for undergraduates to come to an understand
ing of their historic democratic roots. Her achieve
ments in literature and art hardly need emphasizing.
We need this legacy today more than ever. We in
creasingly hear criticism from faculty and students
that the Stanford Overseas Studies Program is devel
oping in the direction of preprofessional technical
school, or even as an adjunct of the multi-national
corporations. Florence is a reminder that the past
exists as well as the present and that the past has
something to teach us about how to live in the pres
ent. It is also a reminder that the heart and the head
must be joined and not separated. There is an in
creasing apprehension that the direction of the Stan
ford Overseas Studies Program undervalues such
ideals and is given instead to a hardheaded in
strumentalism. That direction leaves a lot out of ac
count — Dante, for example.
I hope changes in the Florence program will go
slowly or be arrested, at least until a new dean of Un
dergraduate Studies has had time to study the
proposals. I say this because it is generally believed
that Dean Carolyn Lougee intends to step down at the
end of the year.
