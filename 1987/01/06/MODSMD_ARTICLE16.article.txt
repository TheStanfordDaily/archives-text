# Stanford labs are 'dirty'
## 
### 
In the article "Animal Protesters Sentenced" (Daily, Dec.
5), Karyn Sinunu, the Santa Clara County deputy district at
torney, was quoted saying those who protested the use of
animals at Stanford's laboratories were "emotional" and
"were Targely uninformed about specific Stanford
practices."
That the defendants were emotional would be perfectly
understandable. After all, the issue of torture and killing
(even in the name of "benevolence") is an emotional issue.
1 cannot argue as to the knowledge of the defendants of
"specific Stanford practices," but it is clear that the district

AVI MAGIDOFF

attorney knew little or nothing of those either and had
never conducted an independent investigation of Stanford's
policies — as she apparently expected the defendants to do.
Yet she stated that she "can't find any dirt on Stanford —
Stanford is innocent of abuse and torture of animals."
One can only wonder why the local district attorney's of
fice could find no "dirt" on Stanford, and since they
couldn't, I'd like to set the record straight as to Stanford
practices.
In 1984 Stanford reported the use of some 25,000 animals
(not including mice, rats, birds or farm animals such as pigs,
sheep or horses), none of whom, claimed the University,,
had undergone "experiments or tests involving pain or
distress without administration of appropriate anesthetic
analgesic or tranquilizer drugs." Had any animal undergone
painful experimentation without pain relieving drugs, the
University would have had to report the purpose of the ex
periment. Rather than do that, Stanford claims that no ex
periments involving unrelieved pain or distress take place
on its campus.
But that does not conform with papers published by Stan
ford's researchers and faculty. Psychiatry Prof. Seymour
Levine, for example, conducted an experiment in "fear con
dition." Twelve squirrel monkeys were given electric foot
shocks immediately following a flash of light. Blood samples
were taken while the light was flashing so as to indicate
(through Cortisol levels) the degree of fear the monkeys
developed in anticipation of the upcoming shock. The
monkeys were obviously not anesthetized when
electrocuted through the grid floor 10 times a day, since the
purpose of the experiment was to cause them pain and to
induce fear that was to be associated with the light flash
(Psychneuroendocrin 1985; 10(2): 125-134). Levine also
electroshocks malnutritioned rat pups separated from their
mothers and deprives rats of food and water for one to
three days and then injects them with toxic lithium-chloride
before allowing them access to food. But since Stanford
does not even report on its use of rodents, these atrocities
demonstrate only the level of cruelty involved in such ex
periments but not the systematic lying of the animal re
searchers.
Psychiatry Profs. Jack Barchas and Richard Thompson,
supported by the Office of Naval Research, conduct experi
ments in "fear conditioning" too. They utilize rabbits: A tone
is sounded just prior to the delivery of an electric shock to
the face of the rabbit through a steel wire implanted under
the skin around the left eye. The fear eventually associated
with the tone, in anticipation of a shock, is measured by
monitoring the decrease in the rabbits' heart rate. Again, no

anesthesia is applied (Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Be
havior; 19: 379-382).
Pathology Prof. Steven Kareh drowns rabbits by flushing
their lungs with water for a period of 30 minutes, then dis
sects the lungs and heart in order to compare tissue damage
created by fresh water vs. damage created by salt water. The
rabbits are anesthetized only to the point of eliminating
pain reflexes associated with pinching, and in spite of the
anesthesia the drowned rabbits coughed vigorously. Thirty
minutes worth of drowning are a nightmare not easily
wiped away with light anesthesia. It is also interesting to
note that over 140,000 people drown annually worldwide,
supplying the data Karch is interested in (Arch Pathol Lab
Med 1985; 109: 176-178, Am J Emerg Med 1986; 4: 4-0).
As for "dirt," it would seem as if the district attorney has
never heard of Physiology Prof. Julian Davidson. Davidson is
particularly interested in"the relationship of the ejaculator
mechanism to the mechanisms underlying the penile
reflexes of the supine [lying face up] rat." Thus he restrains
rats in a plastic cylinder and retracts their penile sheath with
a wooden "applicator," observing how the applied pressure
causes erection, ejaculation, "quick flips" (rapid movement
of the penis toward the abdomen), and "long flips" (gradual
sustained flexing of the penis). Some of the rats have their
spinal cord cut first to ensure that there is no involvement of
the central nervous system in the erection process; some
have a local anesthetic rubbed onto the tip of the penis to
render it less sensitive to stimulation; and some are ad
ministered aphrodisiacs (Physiol & Beav, 29: 973-978, Brain
Res 1985; 342(1): 128-34, Physiol & Behav; 37; 47-52, and
more and more ...).
But even in the area of cardiovascular research, Stanford's
pride and joy, one finds that not all experiments bear a
direct relationship to life-saving heart transplants and other
critical procedures. D.D. Harrison, under a contract with
NASA, has immobilized animals continuously for periods of
at least two months in order to study the "effect of
prolonged weightlessness on cardiovascular decondition
ing and whether such effects are cumulative or reversible."
One can only imagine how the permanently restrained
animal goes to the bathroom and what an awful mess it must
live in (NTIS 86/45: 22-23).
At the University of Florida, proposals for experiments
such as Karch's and Harrison's, which involve drowning and
long-term restraint (immobilization), have been rejected on
the grounds of inhumaneness. At Stanford, however, such
experiments continue to take place unabated.
Bernard Shaw said that he who does not hesitate to
vivisect (experiment on animals) would not hesitate to lie
about it, and that is exactly what Stanford is doing. It is as
tonishing that the D.A. was not able to find documentation
supporting the claims of the animal advocates, as one can
easily retrieve the information proving that Stanford lies
when filing and submitting animal-related forms (in effect
breaking the law) and that frivolous research does take
place on the Stanford campus.
Perhaps the might of a financial giant such as Stanford has
immobilized the distinguished local authorities to the point
of self-censorship. That is a sad state of affairs indeed. It
would be a great pity to think that it must take an outsider,
3,000 miles away from Stanford's, to expose the truth be
hind its laboratory d x>rs.

ministered aphrodisiacs (Physiol & Beav, 29: 973-978, Brain
Res 1985; 342(1): 128-34, Physiol & Behav; 37; 47-52, and
more and more ...).
But even in the area of cardiovascular research, Stanford's
pride and joy, one finds that not all experiments bear a
direct relationship to life-saving heart transplants and other
critical procedures. D.D. Harrison, under a contract with
NASA, has immobilized animals continuously for periods of
at least two months in order to study the "effect of
prolonged weightlessness on cardiovascular decondition
ing and whether such effects are cumulative or reversible."
One can only imagine how the permanently restrained
animal goes to the bathroom and what an awful mess it must
live in (NTIS 86/45: 22-23).
At the University of Florida, proposals for experiments
such as Karch's and Harrison's, which involve drowning and
long-term restraint (immobilization), have been rejected on
the grounds of inhumaneness. At Stanford, however, such
experiments continue to take place unabated.
Bernard Shaw said that he who does not hesitate to
vivisect (experiment on animals) would not hesitate to lie
about it, and that is exactly what Stanford is doing. It is as
tonishing that the D.A. was not able to find documentation
supporting the claims of the animal advocates, as one can
easily retrieve the information proving that Stanford lies
when filing and submitting animal-related forms (in effect
breaking the law) and that frivolous research does take
place on the Stanford campus.
Perhaps the might of a financial giant such as Stanford has
immobilized the distinguished local authorities to the point
of self-censorship. That is a sad state of affairs indeed. It
would be a great pity to think that it must take an outsider,
3,000 miles away from Stanford's, to expose the truth be
hind its laboratory d x>rs.

In the article "Animal Protesters Sentenced" (Daily, Dec.
5), Karyn Sinunu, the Santa Clara County deputy district at
torney, was quoted saying those who protested the use of
animals at Stanford's laboratories were "emotional" and
"were Targely uninformed about specific Stanford
practices."
That the defendants were emotional would be perfectly
understandable. After all, the issue of torture and killing
(even in the name of "benevolence") is an emotional issue.
1 cannot argue as to the knowledge of the defendants of
"specific Stanford practices," but it is clear that the district

AVI MAGIDOFF

attorney knew little or nothing of those either and had
never conducted an independent investigation of Stanford's
policies — as she apparently expected the defendants to do.
Yet she stated that she "can't find any dirt on Stanford —
Stanford is innocent of abuse and torture of animals."
One can only wonder why the local district attorney's of
fice could find no "dirt" on Stanford, and since they
couldn't, I'd like to set the record straight as to Stanford
practices.
In 1984 Stanford reported the use of some 25,000 animals
(not including mice, rats, birds or farm animals such as pigs,
sheep or horses), none of whom, claimed the University,,
had undergone "experiments or tests involving pain or
distress without administration of appropriate anesthetic
analgesic or tranquilizer drugs." Had any animal undergone
painful experimentation without pain relieving drugs, the
University would have had to report the purpose of the ex
periment. Rather than do that, Stanford claims that no ex
periments involving unrelieved pain or distress take place
on its campus.
But that does not conform with papers published by Stan
ford's researchers and faculty. Psychiatry Prof. Seymour
Levine, for example, conducted an experiment in "fear con
dition." Twelve squirrel monkeys were given electric foot
shocks immediately following a flash of light. Blood samples
were taken while the light was flashing so as to indicate
(through Cortisol levels) the degree of fear the monkeys
developed in anticipation of the upcoming shock. The
monkeys were obviously not anesthetized when
electrocuted through the grid floor 10 times a day, since the
purpose of the experiment was to cause them pain and to
induce fear that was to be associated with the light flash
(Psychneuroendocrin 1985; 10(2): 125-134). Levine also
electroshocks malnutritioned rat pups separated from their
mothers and deprives rats of food and water for one to
three days and then injects them with toxic lithium-chloride
before allowing them access to food. But since Stanford
does not even report on its use of rodents, these atrocities
demonstrate only the level of cruelty involved in such ex
periments but not the systematic lying of the animal re
searchers.
Psychiatry Profs. Jack Barchas and Richard Thompson,
supported by the Office of Naval Research, conduct experi
ments in "fear conditioning" too. They utilize rabbits: A tone
is sounded just prior to the delivery of an electric shock to
the face of the rabbit through a steel wire implanted under
the skin around the left eye. The fear eventually associated
with the tone, in anticipation of a shock, is measured by
monitoring the decrease in the rabbits' heart rate. Again, no

anesthesia is applied (Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Be
havior; 19: 379-382).
Pathology Prof. Steven Kareh drowns rabbits by flushing
their lungs with water for a period of 30 minutes, then dis
sects the lungs and heart in order to compare tissue damage
created by fresh water vs. damage created by salt water. The
rabbits are anesthetized only to the point of eliminating
pain reflexes associated with pinching, and in spite of the
anesthesia the drowned rabbits coughed vigorously. Thirty
minutes worth of drowning are a nightmare not easily
wiped away with light anesthesia. It is also interesting to
note that over 140,000 people drown annually worldwide,
supplying the data Karch is interested in (Arch Pathol Lab
Med 1985; 109: 176-178, Am J Emerg Med 1986; 4: 4-0).
As for "dirt," it would seem as if the district attorney has
never heard of Physiology Prof. Julian Davidson. Davidson is
particularly interested in"the relationship of the ejaculator
mechanism to the mechanisms underlying the penile
reflexes of the supine [lying face up] rat." Thus he restrains
rats in a plastic cylinder and retracts their penile sheath with
a wooden "applicator," observing how the applied pressure
causes erection, ejaculation, "quick flips" (rapid movement
of the penis toward the abdomen), and "long flips" (gradual
sustained flexing of the penis). Some of the rats have their
spinal cord cut first to ensure that there is no involvement of
the central nervous system in the erection process; some
have a local anesthetic rubbed onto the tip of the penis to
render it less sensitive to stimulation; and some are ad
ministered aphrodisiacs (Physiol & Beav, 29: 973-978, Brain
Res 1985; 342(1): 128-34, Physiol & Behav; 37; 47-52, and
