# CIR action was improper
## 
### 
The recent visit to Stanford of a controversial South
African leader, Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, was given exten
sive front-page coverage in the Dec. 5 Daily. The
headline over the article revealed a colleague's reaction
to some remarks I made at a protest rally: "CIR: Buthelezi
talk will not change policy.' The Daily reported me as
having said the invitation to the chief was "ominous" and
a repudiation of a lot of work and effort toward a policy

of divestment in South Africa by faculty and administra
tors. The CIR chairman's response as reported was not
reassuring. The chairman said that the visit "did not sig
nal change in policy" but that "Buthelezi's arguments
provide a new perspective in the divestment debate."
Unless a change was being considered, what conceivable
purpose could the views of an outspoken opponent of
divestment, disinvestment and economic sanctions have
in being invited to speak to Stanford's Committee on In
vestment Responsibility? Unless there was doubt about
the present policy, why are new perspectives needed?
The situation is even more "omintrus" than I thought it
was when I made my remarks. During this past year, I
was one of the two professors who presented a petition
signed by over 200 faculty members to the Stanford
Board of Trustees, asking that the present policy of
Selective divestment be changed to one of total divest
ment, the selling off of all stocks in the portfolio of com
panies doing business in South Africa. A number of uni
versities have decided upon such action. Later I attended
two meetings sponsored by the Special Committee on
Investment Responsiblity that advises the Board of Trus
tees on this matter. The trustees had already adopted the
recommendation that Stanford divest itself of holdings in
firms not complying with the Sullivan Principles of fair
play for black workers. SCIR was seriously considering
arguments for total divestment, not arguments against
selective divestment, especially since Sullivan had set a
deadline after which he would support such a policy of
conditions had not drastically changed in South Africa. At
both meetings, I suggested that SCIR invite the Rev. Leon
Sullivan to the campus to explain his most recent deci
sion and the expected outcome of such total divestment
disinvestment.
SCIR was also discussing probable impact of Uni

versity divestment on corporate disinvestment from
South Africa, this, in turn, being related to the recent
congressional decision to vote for sanctions and to
override President Reagan's veto of their action. 1 was
shocked when a concerned student informed me that
the trustees' committee was inviting selected individuals
to come to a meeting at Alumni House to listen to Chief
Buthelezi's anti-divestment and anti-disinvestment
propaganda that his right-wing sponsors are touring him
around the country to spread, and which included a
photo opportunity session at the White House with the
president. Unless the SCIR was in the process of rethink
ing its commitments, why would he be invited? And had
they tried to get Sullivan to visit us?
1 owe the SCIR an apology. Its report reveals that I was
misinformed. Buthelezi was not a guest of the trustees'
SCIR, but was a guest of our faculty-student CIR! That
makes the action even more ominous, and I'd like to
redirect my criticism to that committee. It has a recently
appointed chairman whose knowledge of CIR history
may not have prepared him for coping with the pres
sures from many directions that the committee faces.
The Daily reports that he said the committee did not
invite Buthelezi to the campus, but that the chief asked if
he could come. Who, then, did invite him to Stanford
after he asked, and who steered him to CIR? 1 made very
clear in my remarks that I did not oppose a visit to Stan
ford by Buthelezi but only his sponsorship by a commit
tee with a historic policy of supporting divestment. I said
that his campus sponsorship should have been by the
Hoover Institution since the New York Times reported
that his mission here is to warn Americans that any form
of divestment and economic sanctions will be disastrous
for blacks and will help to open the door to Soviet
penetration in South Africa through providing new op
portunities for the African National Congress to increase
its influence.
Under the leadership of the previous chairman, Politi
cal Science Prof. Richard Brody, ClR's meticulous and ex
haustive research and patient dignified relations with
SCIR had played the major role in convincing the Board
of Trustees that a policy of selective disinvestment was
both ethical and wise. Seeking "new perspectives" from
Buthelezi does not strike me as the proper role for CIR.
