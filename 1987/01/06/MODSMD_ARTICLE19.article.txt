# Iran crisis will blow over
## 
### 
Maybe it's the weather out here. Or maybe it's lingering
indigestion from Thanksgiving dinner. Whatever it is, I
predict the Iran crisis will blow over: The President,
damaged as he has been, will regain his popularity.
Future historians will no doubt dutifully record Mr.
Reagan as one of the worst U.S. presidents. His peculiar
blend of incompetence and ignorance will mark, in future
high school text books, the nadir of the U.S. presidency.

But — and this is the point of my article — I have a
feeling the American people will be far more forgiving.
They have too much invested in the Reagan presidency to
back out now.
A month ago, on the front page of the New York Times,
there they all were: Uncle Ronnie, grim, but tough and
bravely forcing a smile; Aunt Nancy, calm, kind, looking
straight at you as though to impart the wisdom of time: "If
you can hold your head while all about ..and there was
Cousin Rex, the dog, snuggled into Aunt Nancy's arms for
warmth and safety. You could just picture him, tearing
around the White House, knocking over china, snapping at
Don Regan's trousers; and you could see Aunt Nancy pick
ing him up, whispering: "Everthing's OK ... just a storm."
I used to think that President Reagan was simply tapping
into the impulse to bully, to beat up on the weak and
defenseless. This is a natural impulse. I have felt it in myself.
Americans felt it at the 1984 Olympics when, in the absence
of Cuban boxers, the U.S. team mauled the Panamanians.
When we sent troops to Granada, dropped bombs on Libya,
mined harbors in Nicaragua, we were, essentially, proving
how tough we were. It feels good to be tough.
Bully is unreliable, however. The bully's basic weakness
ultimately shows through, and his supporters turn on him
with his own ruthlessness. At first, in the Iran crisis, I
thought the American people were finally turning on Presi
dent Reagan. I expected him to be pounded, relentlessly.
But that picture on the front page of the Times is making
me rethink some things. There they all are, Uncle Ron, Aunt
Nancy, Cousin Rex, earnest, friendly, now more than ever
like so many other families in America, the families going
through bankruptcy, foreclosures, layoffs, the drought. It
was impossible not to feel sorry for them. Doesn't everyone
make mistakes? Did they really deserve all this? Weren't they
trying their best?
"They": Ron and Nancy, a nice couple, friends, neighbors,
a part of the family really. But which part?
Last September when the president and Mrs. Reagan ap

peared together on national television to speak out against
drugs it was clear which part they were playing. It was not
the part of mom and dad: Nobody's parents are that out of
touch. Their syrupy talk was the talk of your aunt and uncle,
people whose moralizing you can tolerate because it has no
power over you: You don't have to listen, you can tune it
out, it's just Aunt and Uncle Reagan at it again.
The separation of rhetoric and reality has always been the
essence of the Reagan presidency. Even before the "shovel
brigade" set to work on the Daniloff deal, the Reykjavik
bumbling and the Libya "disinformation" campaign, the
president's words and actions stood in stark opposition to
each other on almost every major issue. His pledge to
reduce government spending and balance the U.S. budget
are but the two most obvious examples.
What the Iran crisis will show, I believe, is that a lot of
Americans like it that way — no matter what the conse
quences. The chance to have a president who's part of the
family, whom you can ignore and like at the same time, is
simply tot) precious to waste. Carter's preaching, Nixon's
whining, Johnson's bluster forced you to pay attention; the
Great Communicator's one and only message is: "It's OK.
You don't have to listen. You can tune out. It's just me
again."

'The bully's basic weakness
ultimately shows through,
and his supporters turn on
him with his own ruthless
ness.'

After President Reagan leaves the White House, I doubt if
America will ever again be able to indulge in the apathy his
message has induced: Our economic problems are too
great, the world is too fragile. But for now, in the mid-'Bos, is
anyone really ready to listen, to wake up? 1 do not think so.
Iran was an alarm clock that went off too soon.
Chief of Staff Don Regan will probably get fired: CIA Di
rector William Casey may well step down; George Bush has
lost the '88 nomination. But for Uncle Ronnie and Aunt
Nancy the storm will pass. Rex will wag his tail again.
