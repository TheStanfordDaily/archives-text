A paroled sex offender, suspected of attacking a female
Stanford student last month, has been charged with assault
with attempt to rape, Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said yesterday.
The suspect, Abel Emanuel Adams, 29, of Fairfield, is still
in custody, and preliminary hearings will begin within the
next few weeks, Herrington said. Adams does not fit the des
cription of the man reported to have attempted two sexual
assaults Nov. 1 near the Dish, he added.
While walking west of Halm Drive between Arboretum
Road and the Hoover Pavilion at approximately 12:20 a.m.
on Dec 20, the student was grabbed by her assailant dis
guised in a ski mask. The student screamed, fought back and
escaped.
Herrington said the student, whose name will not be
released by the police, was saved by her ability to fight off
her attacker.
A passerby, and later the victim, notified the police.
Adams was arrested when he returned to his car around
2:30 a.m. with a ski mask in his pocket, Herrington said.
Adams was later identified by the victim.
Stanford police have been working on the case with both
the Palo Alto Police Department and the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's Office.
Herrington said to help prevent similar assaults from hap
pening simple precautionary measures can be taken:
• Riding a bicycle at night is less dangerous than walking.
The woman becomes less of a stationary target.
• Bikers should stay along the edges of the road where it is
better lit. There is the additional danger of riding a bicycle
at night with poor lighting conditions around campus.
• If a student must walk alone at night, she or he should
look at the different maps in the back of every phone book
that show where heavy foot traffic occur?. The police defutrr
ment issues these maps every year to show which University
thoroughfares are the best lit at night.
• Every woman should carry a whistle to scare away poten
tial assailants. Women can wear them around their neck or
carry one on a key chain.
Herringon cited pocketbooks, book bags and keys as
weapons that can be effectively used during an attack.
