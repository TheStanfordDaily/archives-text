Closet fascists
So Uprising and SOSA are declaring
not only "Stanford out of South
Africa" but now Buthelezi out of
Stanford." It is amazing that one does
not even need to study history to
understand it clearly: The radical left
is composed of closet fascists. These
self-appointed custodians of moral

high ground are (again) telling us that
we don't need to hear diverse opions
because they already know what is
right and wrong.
At least there is something honest
about right-wing dictators â€” they
admit that they live for wealth and
power. The Daniel Ortegas and Mik
hail Gorbachevs of the world,
however, operate behind the lie of

pcisunai oacriiice lor ui>_ will of the
people," while they feed on its blood,
sweat and tears as parasitically as any
dictator ever has. See through the
facade! This is what SOSA, Uprising
and their ilk really stand for.
