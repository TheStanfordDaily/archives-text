## Forum looks at seven sins, personal failure 
### TRACY FURUTANI Editorial staff 
The title of the forum is intriguing:
Seven Deadly Sins — A Contempo
rary Perspective." The list of topics
looks as though it would make for a
rather Rabelasian class; the initial class
meeting is titled "Introduction to Sin,"
with subsequent meetings covering
"Lust,'' "Sloth" and Gluttony" among
others. Then you notice a line at the
bottom of the sheet: "Sponsored by Ec
umenical Ministries at Stanford."
"First of all, we have no intention of
practicing the sins," said the Rev. Tom
Finsterbach, the first lecturer in the se
ries. "We thought that it would be in
poor taste and that it would leave stains
on the carpet."
Finsterbach, the campus minister at
the Newman Center, will present the
introductory lecture tomorrow. In that
lecture, he will present an overview of
the class and discuss the rationale for
the forum, he said.
There are two reasons for doing this
particular series, according to Finster
bach. Failure is a taboo topic, he said,
and so people bury failures deep
within themselves. "Eventually, these

failures come out and express them
selves in unexpected ways," he said.
"This is also the home of the rajahs
of rationalism," he continued. Often,
people will try to rationalize
destructive behavior rather than come
to terms with it, he said.
The ultimate goal of the forum is to
make people aware of how they deal
with their shortcomings, Finsterbach
said. "Of course," he added, "a lot of
people who are the biggest
rationalizers, if they go a level or two
deeper, really know what they are
doing."
The following weeks will cover
manifestations of each of the seven
deadly sins at Stanford.
•Jan. 14: "Pride," Lincoln Moses,
professor of statistics.
•Jan. 21: "Envy," Tim Kidney, direc
tor, Newman Center.
•Jan. 28: "Lust," Cari Lenahan, mar
riage, family and child counselor.
•Feb. 4: "Sloth," Russ Roide, campus
minister, Newman Center.
• Feb. 11: "Gluttony," Carolyn
Roberts, interim assistant dean,
Memorial Church.
•Feb. 18: "Covetousness," Catherine
Milton, director, Public Service Center.

•Feb. 25: "Anger," Doug Daher, psy
chologist, Student Health Services.
This is the third year of the EMS
Forum program, originally called the
Stanford Christian Association.

"We have no inten
tion ofpracticing
the sins We
thought that it
would be in poor
taste and that it
would leave stains
on the carpet."

In past years, various topics of social
and theological significance were cho
sen by EMS without much regard for
continuity. "I think that the purpose of
all of them is to discuss, learn and
share theological issues," noted the
Rev. Byron Bland, the campus minister
for the United Campus Christian Mini
stry. "It's a time for us to look more
deeply into ourselves and our
spirituality."
But this year, Bland said, the plan
ners have picked a theme for each
quarter and planned lectures around
that theme.
For instance, Bland said, last quarter
the theme "Money, Sex and Power'
was chosen, and topics such as the
profit motive and sexuality were dis
cussed.
"Somehow or other the idea of
seven deadly sins' came up (this quar
ter), and we bought it," Bland said.
The reason for picking a theme is to
increase the number of faculty and staff
speakers at the forum, Bland ex
plained. In addition, a theme provides
continuity from week to week, increas
ing attendance, which has been averag
ing between 25 and 50 people per
lecture. Approximately 60 to 80 per
cent of the audience is students, Bland
commented.
Ecumenical Ministries at Stanford is
a religious organization composed of
ministers from the Catholic Newman
Center, Episcopal Fellowship, Lutheran
Campus Ministry and United Campus
Christian Ministry. "We feel that work
done (through EMS) is very effective,"
Bland noted.
Besides the forum, EMS also spon
sors diverse programs such as the
Candlelight Prayer Service in Memorial
Church Tuesdays at 10 p.m. and, with
the Latin American Studies program,
the International Perspectives on Peace
series at the I-Center Tuesdays at noon.

selves in unexpected ways," he said.
"This is also the home of the rajahs
of rationalism," he continued. Often,
people will try to rationalize
destructive behavior rather than come
to terms with it, he said.
The ultimate goal of the forum is to
make people aware of how they deal
with their shortcomings, Finsterbach
said. "Of course," he added, "a lot of
people who are the biggest
rationalizers, if they go a level or two
deeper, really know what they are
doing."
The following weeks will cover
manifestations of each of the seven
deadly sins at Stanford.
•Jan. 14: "Pride," Lincoln Moses,
professor of statistics.
•Jan. 21: "Envy," Tim Kidney, direc
tor, Newman Center.
•Jan. 28: "Lust," Cari Lenahan, mar
riage, family and child counselor.
•Feb. 4: "Sloth," Russ Roide, campus
minister, Newman Center.
• Feb. 11: "Gluttony," Carolyn
Roberts, interim assistant dean,
Memorial Church.
•Feb. 18: "Covetousness," Catherine
Milton, director, Public Service Center.

•Feb. 25: "Anger," Doug Daher, psy
chologist, Student Health Services.
This is the third year of the EMS
Forum program, originally called the
Stanford Christian Association.

"We have no inten
tion ofpracticing
the sins We
thought that it
would be in poor
taste and that it
would leave stains
on the carpet."

In past years, various topics of social
and theological significance were cho
sen by EMS without much regard for
continuity. "I think that the purpose of
all of them is to discuss, learn and
share theological issues," noted the
Rev. Byron Bland, the campus minister
for the United Campus Christian Mini
stry. "It's a time for us to look more
deeply into ourselves and our
spirituality."
But this year, Bland said, the plan
ners have picked a theme for each
quarter and planned lectures around
that theme.
For instance, Bland said, last quarter
the theme "Money, Sex and Power'
was chosen, and topics such as the
profit motive and sexuality were dis
cussed.
"Somehow or other the idea of
seven deadly sins' came up (this quar
ter), and we bought it," Bland said.
The reason for picking a theme is to
increase the number of faculty and staff
speakers at the forum, Bland ex
plained. In addition, a theme provides
continuity from week to week, increas
ing attendance, which has been averag
ing between 25 and 50 people per
lecture. Approximately 60 to 80 per
cent of the audience is students, Bland
commented.
Ecumenical Ministries at Stanford is
a religious organization composed of
ministers from the Catholic Newman
Center, Episcopal Fellowship, Lutheran
Campus Ministry and United Campus
Christian Ministry. "We feel that work
done (through EMS) is very effective,"
Bland noted.
Besides the forum, EMS also spon
sors diverse programs such as the
Candlelight Prayer Service in Memorial
Church Tuesdays at 10 p.m. and, with
the Latin American Studies program,
the International Perspectives on Peace
series at the I-Center Tuesdays at noon.

The title of the forum is intriguing:
Seven Deadly Sins — A Contempo
rary Perspective." The list of topics
looks as though it would make for a
rather Rabelasian class; the initial class
meeting is titled "Introduction to Sin,"
with subsequent meetings covering
"Lust,'' "Sloth" and Gluttony" among
others. Then you notice a line at the
bottom of the sheet: "Sponsored by Ec
umenical Ministries at Stanford."
"First of all, we have no intention of
practicing the sins," said the Rev. Tom
Finsterbach, the first lecturer in the se
ries. "We thought that it would be in
poor taste and that it would leave stains
on the carpet."
Finsterbach, the campus minister at
the Newman Center, will present the
introductory lecture tomorrow. In that
lecture, he will present an overview of
the class and discuss the rationale for
the forum, he said.
There are two reasons for doing this
particular series, according to Finster
bach. Failure is a taboo topic, he said,
and so people bury failures deep
within themselves. "Eventually, these

failures come out and express them
selves in unexpected ways," he said.
"This is also the home of the rajahs
of rationalism," he continued. Often,
people will try to rationalize
destructive behavior rather than come
to terms with it, he said.

make people aware of how they deal
