# WHAT KIND OF A FUTURE STANFORD?
## 
### 
During the Winter Quarter Prof. Robert B. Textor will
be offering a Practicum in Ethnographic Futures Research
as Anthropology 269 A (69A for undergrads) and ill so as
Education 212 A. The practicum will provide intensive
training in an interviewing approach adapted from
ethnography (see p. 250 of catalog), which over the years
has resulted in Stanford students' sharing authorship of a
number of publications, e.g., Austria 2(X)5: Projected
Sociocultural Effects of the Microelectronic Revolution.
You may work alone or join one of the two coordinated
teams. One team will interview a sample of Stanford
students, professors, and administrators, non-directively
eliciting alternative scenarios emlxxlying their images and
preferences as to what the Stanford "culture" can, might,
should, or should not like 25 years from now. The second
team will similarly interview executives, planners, and
scientists in Bay Area biotech industries concerning their
industry's possible impact upon the world. Both teams will
publish their results, and all participating students will be
listed as co-authors.
The course is open to juniors, seniors, and grad students
from any major. Previous interviewing experience is not
necessary. Flexible credit arrangements are possible. If you
are interested in interview methods, cultural analysis,
education, broad-scale planning, and/or public policy, you
can find out more about the course at our initial meeting on
Wed. Jiui 7 at 7:00 PM in the Anthropology Department,
Building 110, Rmm 111 J.
