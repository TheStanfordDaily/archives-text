Beer and shaving cream
Not to frighten off any potential columnists, but...
"Several Sigma Chi fraternity little sisters' will be dis
ciplined for dousing a student columnist with beer and
shaving cream because he criticized fraternities in the Uni
versity of Miami newspaper," according to The Associated
Press.
Apparently, the columnist was attacked by a group of
"more than 25 women affiliated with the fraternity" in his
dorm room soon after his controversial column was pub
lished. He was floored and "several (women) tried un
successfully to strip him while one took pictures."
The attackers will probably "face probation on university
charges of disorderly conduct," added the report.
Familiar strains
Not only at Stanford do important university offices and
services operate on limited hours. The complaints of In
diana University senior Andrea Elger in The Indiana Daily
Student sound all too familiar:
"After a chilly walk to the Student Building to pick up a
transcript this afternoon, I was quite perturbed to discover
that the Registrar's office closes at 4 p.m.," Elger wrote in a
letter to the editor.
"Don't try to speak to a financial aid counselor during the
noon hour — they all close up shop and head for Hardee's.
No one even bothers to answer the phone between noon
and 1 p.m.
"Then there's the Main Library, which insists on closing
its doors on hardworking students at midnight and doesn't
even open them on Sunday until 1 p.m.
"Even the IU Bookstore deprives hundreds of visiting par
ents and siblings of Hoosier apparel and paraphernalia on
Sundays."
Student television
For many fledgling student projects, there's nothing like a
vote of confidence from the school newspaper.
University of Pennsylvania students have set up a televi
sion studio that broadcasts programs campus-wide, much in
the way SUNet does locally. The difference is that UTV, the
Penn station, has been experimenting with programs for en
tertainment.
One such experimental program, according to the Daily
Pennsylvanian, is a talk show called "Nite Riot," "which
aspires to emulate the vastly successful Late Night with
David Letterman' and The Tonight Show.' "
Scheduled to begin at 10:30 p.m., the show is finally un
derway six minutes late when the newspaper visited the
production.
"The studio explodes.... The show's guests, two sets of

iwins and two members of the Without a Net' comedy im
provisation group, are shoved into a corner. They are in
structed not to budge from their spots until they are intro
duced.
"(.lay) Rosen (the host), now pale and nervous, looks like
he is about to pass out in the corner...
"The set itself is stark, with five chairs arranged in a semi
circle. A dark blue curtain provides the backdrop for the
two blackboards.
"Rosen starts the show with a Carsonesque monologue.
But his comedy relies mainly on the run-of-the-mill Whar
ton jokes. It really doesn't go anywhere, but the audience —
twins, Without a Netsters, techies — are commanded to
squeal with glee at each of his mildly amusing jokes. They
do. Rosen looks shocked.
The title of the article? "UTV show is on the spot trying to
be funny on the air." And keep those cards and letters com
ing.
Bum steer
Bill Hinch is bummed.
And understandably so. A couple months ago an orange
and white statue of a steer (nicknamed "Bevo") disappeared
from the top of Hinch's bookstore in downtown Austin,
Texas.
"It (the statue) was there when I left the store at about
12:45 Friday night," Hinch said in an article in The Daily
Texan, the University of Texas student newspaper. "It wasn't
there when I got there Saturday morning. I guess it was
taken sometime around 3 o'clock in the morning.
"I called the police when I saw what had happened and I
told him, I need to report a stolen steer.' He thought I
meant a real one. Then I told him it had been stolen off the
top of the building. I think he was a little surprised, and it
took a while for us to get the story straight."
Suspicion was immediately directed at students from
Texas A&M, UT's archrival.
And the Aggies issued an unabashed mea culpa.
"Yep, we got him," said Senior Cadet Mason Hogan of
Texas A&M. He said some freshman corps members took
the bookstore steer, covered it with "some anti-T.U." graffiti
and brought it back to the A&M campus for the bonfire rally
before the UT-A&M game on Thanksgiving Day.
"1 know for sure there's some stuff like Bevo sucks' writ
ten on him, and there's a line in our fight song that talks
about cutting the horns off T.U.," Hogan said. "I'd have to
say that if his horns are still on, it's a freak accident."
As for Hinch, he just wants his steer back, regardless of Its
condition.
All our advertising says 'Look for the steer on the drag,' "
Hinch said. "Now there's no steer.
1 don't know what we're going to do," he said. "We'd just
like to get him back. We're hoping he doesn't end up barbe
cued on top of a bonfire."

diana University senior Andrea Elger in The Indiana Daily
Student sound all too familiar:
"After a chilly walk to the Student Building to pick up a
transcript this afternoon, I was quite perturbed to discover
that the Registrar's office closes at 4 p.m.," Elger wrote in a
letter to the editor.
"Don't try to speak to a financial aid counselor during the
noon hour — they all close up shop and head for Hardee's.
No one even bothers to answer the phone between noon
and 1 p.m.
"Then there's the Main Library, which insists on closing
its doors on hardworking students at midnight and doesn't
even open them on Sunday until 1 p.m.
"Even the IU Bookstore deprives hundreds of visiting par
ents and siblings of Hoosier apparel and paraphernalia on
Sundays."
Student television
For many fledgling student projects, there's nothing like a
vote of confidence from the school newspaper.
University of Pennsylvania students have set up a televi
sion studio that broadcasts programs campus-wide, much in
the way SUNet does locally. The difference is that UTV, the
Penn station, has been experimenting with programs for en
tertainment.
One such experimental program, according to the Daily
Pennsylvanian, is a talk show called "Nite Riot," "which
aspires to emulate the vastly successful Late Night with
David Letterman' and The Tonight Show.' "
Scheduled to begin at 10:30 p.m., the show is finally un
derway six minutes late when the newspaper visited the
production.
"The studio explodes.... The show's guests, two sets of

iwins and two members of the Without a Net' comedy im
provisation group, are shoved into a corner. They are in
structed not to budge from their spots until they are intro
duced.
"(.lay) Rosen (the host), now pale and nervous, looks like
he is about to pass out in the corner...
"The set itself is stark, with five chairs arranged in a semi
circle. A dark blue curtain provides the backdrop for the
two blackboards.
"Rosen starts the show with a Carsonesque monologue.
But his comedy relies mainly on the run-of-the-mill Whar
ton jokes. It really doesn't go anywhere, but the audience —
twins, Without a Netsters, techies — are commanded to
squeal with glee at each of his mildly amusing jokes. They
do. Rosen looks shocked.
The title of the article? "UTV show is on the spot trying to
be funny on the air." And keep those cards and letters com
ing.
Bum steer
Bill Hinch is bummed.
And understandably so. A couple months ago an orange
and white statue of a steer (nicknamed "Bevo") disappeared
from the top of Hinch's bookstore in downtown Austin,
Texas.
"It (the statue) was there when I left the store at about
12:45 Friday night," Hinch said in an article in The Daily
Texan, the University of Texas student newspaper. "It wasn't
there when I got there Saturday morning. I guess it was
taken sometime around 3 o'clock in the morning.
"I called the police when I saw what had happened and I
told him, I need to report a stolen steer.' He thought I
meant a real one. Then I told him it had been stolen off the
top of the building. I think he was a little surprised, and it
took a while for us to get the story straight."
Suspicion was immediately directed at students from
Texas A&M, UT's archrival.
And the Aggies issued an unabashed mea culpa.
"Yep, we got him," said Senior Cadet Mason Hogan of
Texas A&M. He said some freshman corps members took
the bookstore steer, covered it with "some anti-T.U." graffiti
and brought it back to the A&M campus for the bonfire rally
before the UT-A&M game on Thanksgiving Day.
"1 know for sure there's some stuff like Bevo sucks' writ
ten on him, and there's a line in our fight song that talks
about cutting the horns off T.U.," Hogan said. "I'd have to
say that if his horns are still on, it's a freak accident."
As for Hinch, he just wants his steer back, regardless of Its
condition.
All our advertising says 'Look for the steer on the drag,' "
Hinch said. "Now there's no steer.
1 don't know what we're going to do," he said. "We'd just
like to get him back. We're hoping he doesn't end up barbe
cued on top of a bonfire."
Beer and shaving cream
Not to frighten off any potential columnists, but...
"Several Sigma Chi fraternity little sisters' will be dis
ciplined for dousing a student columnist with beer and
shaving cream because he criticized fraternities in the Uni
versity of Miami newspaper," according to The Associated
Press.
Apparently, the columnist was attacked by a group of
"more than 25 women affiliated with the fraternity" in his
dorm room soon after his controversial column was pub
lished. He was floored and "several (women) tried un
successfully to strip him while one took pictures."
The attackers will probably "face probation on university
charges of disorderly conduct," added the report.
