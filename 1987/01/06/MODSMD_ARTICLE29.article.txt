## Mastery of USC again Hoopsters win 64-58

LOS ANGEI.ES (AF) — Todd Lichti and Novian Whilsitt
scored 17 points each last night to lead Stanford to a 64-58
Pacific-10 Conference basketball victory over cold-shooting
USC.
Whitsitt scored seven of his points during a 14-0 Stanford
surge over a period of 4:42 that gave the Cardinal a 59-49
lead with 5:13 remaining in the game. The Trojans were not
closer than three points after that.
Freshman Bob Erbst led Southern Cal, which made only
one-third of its field goal attempts, with a career-high 15
points. Derrick Dowell added 12 points and pulled down a
game-high nine rebounds for the Trojans.
Dowell, playing with the flu, was held well below his 23.4
scoring average and was not a factor when the game was on
the line late in the second half.
1-reshman Chris Munk added eight points for the Trojans.
Munk, the highly touted forward from the Bay Area, had
hoped to play for the Cardinal this year but chose USC after
he was not admitted at Stanford.
Stanford led at halftime 32-29, but Southern Cal was on
top 49-45 when the Cardinal began its decisive blitz.
The Trojans scored seven straight points after Stanford's
explosion to make it 59-56. "They were extremely fast,"
Whitsitt said. I think that was the best pressure we've faced
all year."
The Cardinal made five of seven free throws in the late
going to clinch the victory.
The scoring of Whitsitt and Lichti offset a deficiency at the
center position. Sophomore Howard Wright scored just two
points on the evening, and junior Eric Reveno, in foul trou
ble most of the game, tallied only four off of the bench.
Stanford, which has not lost to USC since the 1983-84
season, raised its Pac 10 record to 2-2 and its overall mark to
8-5. The Trojans fell to 0-4 in conference plav and 5-7 over
all.
The Cardinal will return home today and will host Pac-10-
leading Washington Thursday at 7:35 p.m. Washington State
■will be at Maples Pavilion Saturday. "We've been on the road
for nine days now, and we haven't seen Stanford for
awhile," Whitsitt said. "It will be nice to get home."
