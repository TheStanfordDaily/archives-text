# Boz not welcome at Oklahoma now

NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — All-
American Brian Bosworth, the Univer
sity of Oklahoma linebacker whose
fierce style and flamboyant personality
made him a national celebrity, has
played his last game for the Sooners,
•Coach Barry Switzer said yesterday.
Even before he was banned by the.
NCAA from participating in the Orange
Bowl on New Year's Day because of
steroid use, it was widely speculated
that "The Boz" would pass up his
remaining year of eligibility for No. 3
Oklahoma and turn professional.
Switzer gave no reason for his deci
sion, but his short statement follows
Bosworth's latest controversial action
-— walking the sidelines before a na
tional television audience wearing a T
shirt that, using the NCAA initials, read
"National Communists Against Ath
letes'' as well as "Welcome to Russia."
Oklahoma Athletic Director Donnie
Duncan said he discussed Bosworth's
actions with Switzer after the Orange
Bowl, but said he did not direct Swit
zer to take any action concerning Bos
worth.
"We had a tremendous game on the
field with a tremendous group of kids.
I thought that should have been the
focus," Duncan said. "Obviously, Brian
has his own personal views. 1 don't
want those confused with the univer
sity's views."
Switzer issued a three-sentence
-statement yesterday indicating that
Bosworth no longer had the option of
returning for a final year. The usually
outspoken Bosworth could not be lo
cated for comment.
He did not return telephone calls
left with the athletic office.
"After having discussions today with

Brian Bosworth, I have decided it
would be in the best interests of the
University of Oklahoma football pro
gram that he forgo his senior season of
eligibility in 1987," Switzer said in the
statement issued by the school's sports
information office.
"Brian is one of the greatest players
to have ever performed for the
Sooners. 1 am sure his future with the
National Football League will parallel if
not exceed his career accomplish
ments at the University of Oklahoma."
The Sooner coach had no additional
comment, his office said.
University of Oklahoma President
Frank Horton said he supported Swit
zer's decision.
Bosworth finished fourth in the bal
loting for the Heisman Trophy, was a
finalist for the Lombardi Award and
won the Butkus Award for the second
year in a row this season, 112 ie was the
Big Eight defensive player of the year
and an All-America for the second con
secutive year.
Bosworth, of Dallas, led the 11-1
Sooners in tackles this season and was
the standout performer in a defense
that led the nation in rushing defense,
passing defense, scoring defense and
total defense.
He did not play in Oklahoma's Or
ange Bowl victory over Arkansas after
being banned from the game by the
NCAA because anabolic steroids were
found in his system.
Bosworth held a news conference in
Miami, criticizing the NCAA for ban
ning players from bowl games for
using the muscle-building steroids fie
said he used steroids under a doctor's
care months earlier to help recover
from shoulder injuries.
