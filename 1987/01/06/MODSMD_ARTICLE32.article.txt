# Card spikers make All-America teams
## Smith first team, Rush second team 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
keeps piling up the honors. After concluding
its season with a third-place national finish,
two players, Teresa Smith and Wendi Rush,
were selected during break to the Russell Ail-
American first and second teams, respectively.
The two 12-player teams were selected by
the Collegiate Volleyball Coaches Association
and represent the best players throughout the
cc mntry.
Smith, a six-foot junior outside hitter made
her first-ever All-America team. This year she
tallied 563 kills, a .340 hitting percentage and
87 service aces, all team highs.
The Los Angeles native also had 379 digs
and 89 total blocks, both third on the team.
Furthermore, she was the team s best passer
and main gun in pressure situations.
"I think it was great (that she made the first
team)," Rush said. "She had a good season."
Smith was earlier named the Flayer of the
Year this season in the Pacific 10 Conference,
the second toughest in women's volleyball. As
she was after receiving that award, she said
she was surprised by her latest recognition. "I
actually didn't think about it," she said.
I was really excited," she added.
"(Stanford coach Don Shaw) told us the day
of the Nebraska match (at the Final Four). I
was really psyched to play."
Rush's selection to the second team marked
her third consecutive year of honors. As a
freshman she was an honorable mention All-
American, according to Volleyball Monthly,
and last year she was named to the CVCA's
first team.
The 5-10 junior setter from Cedar Glen ran

the Cardinal offense all year, and her 13 0"' as
sists per game average put her in the top five
nationally. She finished second on the team
with 394 digs and fourth with 84 total blocks.
"1 don't really understand why she got
second team this year after first team last
year," Smith said. "1 think she deserved first
team. We all knew she had a great season."
Rush took the decision in stride, though.
"It's an honor to be on either team," she said.
"There are a lot of good players (in the
country)."
Junior setter Mariliisa Salmi from Brigham
Young was named the Player of the Year after
leading the Cougars to a 40-3 record, their
best ever. "She is definitely a great player,"
Smith said. "I was impressed (at the West
Regional.)"
Joining Smith and Salmi on the first team
Were seniors Karen Dahlgren (Nebraska), Lisa
Ice (San Jose State), Eva Murray (Texas), Sari
Virtanen (BYU) and Tammy Webb (Arizona
State); junior Suzanne Eagye (Hawaii); sopho
mores Mary Eggers (Illinois), Kris Morton
(San Diego State) and Elaina Oden (Pacific);
and freshman Tara Cross (Long Beach State).
The second team was composed of seniors

(UCLA), Ellen Hensler (Penn State), Charlotte
Mitchel (UC-Santa Barbara), Enid Schonewise
(Nebraska) and Wendy Stammer (Louisiana
State); juniors Rush, Reydan Ahuna (Hawaii),
