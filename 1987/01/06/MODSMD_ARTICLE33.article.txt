# Fendick captures tennis tournament
## Defeats freshman Green in singles final 
### 
The powers that be in the collegiate
tennis world seem not to have learned
their lesson about Stanford's Patty Fen
dick.
Last season, Fendick was ranked No.
4 in the NCAA preseason women's ten
nis poll despite being considered the
top player by Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan. Fendick proved the pollsters
wrong by winning the NCAA singles
championship last May in Austin,
Texas.
Nevertheless, the Stanford senior
was seeded only third at last weekend's
Mitsubishi-Desert Princess National
Collegiate Tennis Classic in Cathedral
City. The pre-tournament press release
listed her among the "possible win
ners."
Once again, Fendick made a mock
ery of the rankings, capturing the
women's singles title Sunday by defeat
ing Lisa Green, her freshman
teammate, 6-3, 7-6. Fendick won the
second-set tie-breaker 7-3.
Fendick lost three straight games in
the second set to fall behind 6-5, but
then won a game to tie the set before
winning the tie-breaker.
Fendick met many familiar faces en
route to winning the championship. In
the quarterfinals, she defeated Califor
nia's Karen Shin 6-4, 6-1. Last year at
the NCAAs, Fendick humiliated Shin 6-
0, 6-0.
The Stanford All-American's tough
est challenge came in the semifinals
against USC's Caroline Kuhlman when
she prevailed 6-1, 3-6, 7-5. Kuhlman
was the No. 1 player for most of the
1986 season. She was undefeated until

the NCAA championships, when Fen
dick defeated her twice in the span of a
week.
Even though Fendick won the title,
Green's performance had to be the
highlight of the tournament for Stan
ford followers. The native of San Jose
figured to have a difficult time cracking
the Cardinal's lineup when the team's
season starts next month. But her suc
cess in Cathedral City showed why she
was the No. 3 recruit in the nation last
year.
Green defeated Maeve Quinlan,
USC's No. 3 singles player last season,
4-6, 6-3, 6-1 in the quarterfinals and
knocked off Clemson's Ingelise
Driehuis 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 in the semifinals
before losing to Fendick.
On the men's side in the tourna
ment, top-seeded Richey Reneberg of
Southern Methodist University
defeated Andrew Sznaidjer of Pep
perdine 6-1, 6-2 Sunday to win the
singles championship.
Reneberg, a junior from Houston,
needed just 53 minutes to defeat
Sznaidjer, the Canadian national men's
champion who was playing in his first
collegiate tournament.
Stanford's Patrick McEnroe ad
vanced to the quarterfinals before
losing to UCLA's Tim Triguiero 1-6, 6-3,
6-1.
In doubles action, Fendick and
Stephanie Savides advanced to the
semifinals with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over a
USC pair.
Green and Kay Tittle also moved
into the semifinals with a straight-set
victory over a Trinity tandem.
