Dallas Comegys scored 22 points as
seventh-ranked DePaul remained un
beaten, routing Furman 81-64 last

Southern Conference, were no match
for the Blue Demons, who moved to
11-0.
Comegys had 18 points in the first
half, mostly on passes from guard
Terence Greene. Furman, 6-4, tried
zone and man-to-man defenses, but
DePaul was too tall and too quick.

the game at 13:57 of the second half

landed on a teammate, striking his
lower back on the court.

jump shot by guard Kevin Edwards
pushed the advantage to 24 with less
than five minutes remaining.
Edwards scored 16 points, and
Greene had 12. Furman guard Shawn
Reid collected 19 points, including five
field goals from three-point range.

DePaul made the biggest leap in yes

last week's No. 15 ranking.
