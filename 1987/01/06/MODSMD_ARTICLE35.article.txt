# Pre-game signaled Gator Bowl doom
## Stanford was in trouble from the outset 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Stanford should have
known things would not go right for it in the
42nd Gator Bowl here. Just before game time, five
parachutists from the Army's Golden Knights
team were set to drift into the stadium carrying
the American flag, state flags and banners from
both schools.
All landed near the 50-yard line save one —
carrying a Stanford banner — who missed the
stadium wide right. He landed safely in the
parking lot.
Who says football coaches are oblivious to
everything but football? Stanford Coach Jack El
way certainly knew that there was something spe
cial happening two days before the Dec. 27 game.
Speaking of his practice schedule, he said, "We
tapered off on Thursday." Did tapering off in
clude Midnight Mass and Christmas dinner? Elway
didn't say.
Jacksonville may have been painted orange by
tens of thousands of Clemson fans who evacuated
the state of South Carolina, but one member of
the Stanford group received recognition at the
pregame luncheon. Philip Geiger, the seven
week-old son of Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, received a Gator Bowl sweatshirt as the
youngest member of an official traveling party in
Gator Bowl history. Philip redshirted this past
season.
Among thousands of illustrious alumni, Stan
ford can claim one U.S. president and two current
Supreme Court justices. Clemson, however,
boasts one former Miss Universe — Shawn
Weatherly, who led the Gator Bowl parade.
At the luncheon, Elway and Clemson Coach

Danny Ford both received keys to the city of Jack
sonville, use of a Mazda car or truck for one year
and a seven-day cruise package with their wives
to Disney World and the Bahamas. And one can
picture Elway diagramming plays while waiting in
line at Epcot Center.
Ford on Clemson fans: "We hope you enjoy
Clemson, because when Clemson goes some
place, they enjoy it. They come in 30-, 40-, 50,000-
strong, and you know they've been here when
they leave.' Whoever had the paw-print conces
sion in Jacksonville is now very rich.
For Stanford students from Los Angeles who
were homesick for a good, old-fashioned quarter
back controversy next season after John Paves
graduation, don't look to the Cardinal. "Starting
into next season, Greg Ennis will be our No. 1
quarterback," Elway said.
Football is perhaps a bit more serious in the
South. So is sportswriting. The Gator Bowl press
room at the Sheraton St. John's Place came com
plete with a fully stocked bar. Perhaps an induce
ment to Elway to hang out with the writers a little
longer.
What's in a name? Would a Cardinal by any
other name be a color? Or a bird? For the
souvenir manufacturer who plastered a mean
looking redbird on everything with the Stanford
name, the error probably ended up being costly.
Stanford souvenirs were being marked down as
the weekend wore on. At least they didn't bring
back the Indian.
Question Ford's scouting report. He said at a
pregame press conference that Stanford might
have an edge in the kicking game. Stanford kicker
David Sweeney finished the year 4-of-15 on Field
goal attempts.

Greg Ennis, who made his first collegiate start in the Gator Bowl, will be the Cardinal's No. 1
quarterback next season, according to Stanford Coach Jack Elway.
