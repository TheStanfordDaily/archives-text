## Hard rock meets responsibility in Cinderella 
### LIZ GOODMAN 
MTV has a way of making instant
rock stars. Turn it on, and you are in
nundated with faces you'd never seen a
month earlier, see altogether too much
of this month, and by next month
(probably when you can no longer
stand them anyway) they've disap
peared. With tons of air play, even the
most meagerly talented can become
household names overnight, though
most don't have what it takes to hold
anyone's interest for long.
But every once in a while something
worthwhile does come along, and with
the help of MTV, artists can be spared
perhaps years of senseless struggle to
be catapulted instantly into the
limelight.
Such is the case for the hard rock
quartet Cinderella. They were un
known a year ago and suddenly, now
that they're all over the videowaves (in
the upbeat "Shake Me" and the ballad
"Nobody's Fool," both of which feature
two evil stepsisters as recurring vil
lainesses), their debut album "Night
Songs" has sold well over the platinum
mark (one million copies), and they've
just completed a national tour as the
opening act for David Lee Roth.
Sure, their story has been likened to
that of a fairytale (having also had the
good fortune of being discovered
during their club days by Jon Bon Jovi,
who brought Cinderella to the atten
tion of his record label, Polygram
Records). But something about these
guys leaves you with the feeling that
they would have gone straight to the
top anyway. The help of Bon Jovi and
MTV just speeded things up a little.
"MTV has been great to us," said
vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Tom
Keifer, "since the guys who made our

videos did a really good job - they even
made LIS look good."
With long dark hair, dark glasses,
many dark layers of clothing and a web
of bracelets and rings, the very pale,
very tall and very thin Keifer is a strik
ing, if not eerie, figure, a natural for
rock video stardom.
But Keifer and the other band mem
bers, drummer Fred Coury, lead
guitarist Jeff Laßar and bassist Eric Brit
tingham, are not the flamboyant, overly
image-conscious rock star-types.
Seemingly very down to earth, Keifer is
first and last a musician, with a subtle
sense of humor and very definite
opinions — especially when it comes
to drug abuse.

'He (Bon Jovi)
helped us out a lot.
We're very appre
ciative.'

"I think you should be honest with
your fans, but I don't think they have to
know everything about your personal
life. If you have a drug problem keep it
to yourself," said Keifer.
If you've watched MTV recently, you
may have seen the RAD (Rock Against
Drugs) ad campaign, wherein various
rock performers warn viewers against
the dangers of drug abuse. The ads,
which are filmed in a very straightfor
ward manner, mark a signifcant change
in the image of rock music, which has
been heavily associated with drug use
since the late '60s. The times, they are

a-changin', and Cinderella is in the
forefront of these changes.
"We're doing a spot for MTV (as part
of the RAD campaign) when we get to
Hollywood because I feel really
strongly about that Whether you do
drugs or not, 1 don't think you have to
preach about it in your music," added
Keifer. "1 don't like bands who have it
in every other word of their music. I
think it's a bad influence on kids.
There's enough out there that would
make them take drugs already. They
don't need their idols to tell them to
do it too.
"I think it's important not to make a
big issue out of that," Keifer continued.
"A lot of bands use drugs as a gimmick
... the party band, the crazy guys, the
druggies, and a lot of them really aren't
that way."
Accordingly, Cinderella is a band
that has never needed to rely on gim
micks, even to break out of its lim
ited hometown music scene in
Philadelphia.
"Philly isn't really the rock and roll
capital of the world," said Keifer. "It's
not heavy stuff coming out of there. It
was hard for us to find work. There
was really only one club that we played
at and that's where Jon saw us — at the
Empire rock club.
"He (Bon Jovi) helped us out a lot.
We're very appreciative of that fact but
I think we did a little work of our own
too," said Keifer. "We had our
homework done before the teacher
came and graded it."
The result of their "homework" was
the release of "Night Songs," the music
that is a synthesis of hard rock, high
caliber songwriting and the subtleties
of more blues-like, '70s-style influen
ces.
"I grew up in the '70s. I've always

been into that kind of sound," ex
plained Keifer. "It's still what I listen to.
I like all of those originating bands —
the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin,
Aerosmith, Humble Pie and Nazareth.
That's what I think has influenced my
singing, writing and playing," said
Keifer.

Keifer drew from slightly different
influences, however, when choosing
the name Cinderella. "I don't like
really obvious names like The Baby
Killers,' really heavy names. I always
liked names like 'Kiss' or 'Sweet.' I
think using lighter-sounding words is a
more 'round-the-corner approach."

'Round-the-corner approach or not,
Cinderella certainly get its point
across. If you were among the unfor
tunates who missed their recent show
here, you have one more chance to
catch them in concert; they will be the
opening act for Bon Jovi at the Cow
Palace on January 24.

limelight.
Such is the case for the hard rock
quartet Cinderella. They were un
known a year ago and suddenly, now
that they're all over the videowaves (in
the upbeat "Shake Me" and the ballad
"Nobody's Fool," both of which feature
two evil stepsisters as recurring vil
lainesses), their debut album "Night
Songs" has sold well over the platinum
mark (one million copies), and they've
just completed a national tour as the
opening act for David Lee Roth.
Sure, their story has been likened to
that of a fairytale (having also had the
good fortune of being discovered
during their club days by Jon Bon Jovi,
who brought Cinderella to the atten
tion of his record label, Polygram
Records). But something about these
guys leaves you with the feeling that
they would have gone straight to the
top anyway. The help of Bon Jovi and
MTV just speeded things up a little.
"MTV has been great to us," said
vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Tom
Keifer, "since the guys who made our

videos did a really good job - they even
made LIS look good."
With long dark hair, dark glasses,
many dark layers of clothing and a web
of bracelets and rings, the very pale,
very tall and very thin Keifer is a strik
ing, if not eerie, figure, a natural for
rock video stardom.
But Keifer and the other band mem
bers, drummer Fred Coury, lead
guitarist Jeff Laßar and bassist Eric Brit
tingham, are not the flamboyant, overly
image-conscious rock star-types.
Seemingly very down to earth, Keifer is
first and last a musician, with a subtle
sense of humor and very definite
opinions — especially when it comes
to drug abuse.

'He (Bon Jovi)
helped us out a lot.
We're very appre
ciative.'

"I think you should be honest with
your fans, but I don't think they have to
know everything about your personal
life. If you have a drug problem keep it
to yourself," said Keifer.
If you've watched MTV recently, you
may have seen the RAD (Rock Against
Drugs) ad campaign, wherein various
rock performers warn viewers against
the dangers of drug abuse. The ads,
which are filmed in a very straightfor
ward manner, mark a signifcant change
in the image of rock music, which has
been heavily associated with drug use
since the late '60s. The times, they are

a-changin', and Cinderella is in the
forefront of these changes.
"We're doing a spot for MTV (as part
of the RAD campaign) when we get to
Hollywood because I feel really
strongly about that Whether you do
drugs or not, 1 don't think you have to
preach about it in your music," added
Keifer. "1 don't like bands who have it
in every other word of their music. I
think it's a bad influence on kids.
There's enough out there that would
make them take drugs already. They
don't need their idols to tell them to
do it too.
"I think it's important not to make a
big issue out of that," Keifer continued.
"A lot of bands use drugs as a gimmick
... the party band, the crazy guys, the
druggies, and a lot of them really aren't
that way."
Accordingly, Cinderella is a band
that has never needed to rely on gim
micks, even to break out of its lim
ited hometown music scene in
Philadelphia.
"Philly isn't really the rock and roll
capital of the world," said Keifer. "It's
not heavy stuff coming out of there. It
was hard for us to find work. There
was really only one club that we played
at and that's where Jon saw us — at the
Empire rock club.
"He (Bon Jovi) helped us out a lot.
We're very appreciative of that fact but
I think we did a little work of our own
too," said Keifer. "We had our
homework done before the teacher
came and graded it."
The result of their "homework" was
the release of "Night Songs," the music
that is a synthesis of hard rock, high
caliber songwriting and the subtleties
of more blues-like, '70s-style influen
ces.
"I grew up in the '70s. I've always

been into that kind of sound," ex
plained Keifer. "It's still what I listen to.
I like all of those originating bands —
the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin,
Aerosmith, Humble Pie and Nazareth.
That's what I think has influenced my
singing, writing and playing," said
Keifer.

Keifer drew from slightly different
influences, however, when choosing
the name Cinderella. "I don't like
really obvious names like The Baby
Killers,' really heavy names. I always
liked names like 'Kiss' or 'Sweet.' I
think using lighter-sounding words is a
more 'round-the-corner approach."

'Round-the-corner approach or not,
Cinderella certainly get its point
across. If you were among the unfor
tunates who missed their recent show
here, you have one more chance to
catch them in concert; they will be the
opening act for Bon Jovi at the Cow
Palace on January 24.

Video has transformed the members of the rock group Cinderella into stars, but don't be deceived by appearances.
Underneath all that make-up and hair are musicians with little interest in gimmicks or drugs. From 1-r: Jeff Laßar,

MTV has a way of making instant

(probably when you can no longer

peared. With tons of air play, even the
most meagerly talented can become
household names overnight, though
most don't have what it takes to hold
anyone's interest for long.
