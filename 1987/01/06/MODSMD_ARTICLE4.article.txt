Six humanities and sciences faculty' mem
bers were presented the Dean's Award for
Distinguished Teaching at ceremonies held
Dec. 11. The awards were presented by Nor
man Wessells, dean of Humanities and
Sciences.
This year's recipients are Chemistry Prof.
Michael Payer, Philosophy Asst. Prof. Eckart
Forster, History Assoc. Prof. Harold Kahn,
Classics and History Prof. Sabine MacCor
mack, English Prof. Ronald Rebholz and
Communication Assoc. Prof. Kristine Samuel
son.
The Dean's Award, now in its 11th year,
was developed to honor excellence in all
types of teaching: undergraduate, graduate,
post-doctoral, large or small lecture courses,
seminars, doctoral or honors guidance and
curricular development.
Recipients are selected by a faculty com
mittee. Comments from both faculty and stu
dents are considered in the selection
process, including statistical information on

course ratings by students.
"The evaluation includes a lot of faculty
analysis — firsthand knowledge by people
observing their peers," Wessells said. "It is
really wonderful that way. You get an in
sider's view of how people perform."
The award carries a permanent increase in
base salary for all recipients and a research
award of $2,000 to $3,000 for non-tenured
winners.
Forster said he was "delighted" to receive
the award. Forster, who teaches across the
curriculum in philosophy — from great
works of Western culture to a number of
other advanced courses — said he planned to
use the money "to hire a research assistant
for a couple of hours a week and to buy lots
of books."
Forster earned his doctorate at Oxford in
1982 and has taught at Stanford since 1983. A
Rhodes scholar, he has also won the Ernest
Walker Prize in Philosophy and a 1985 re
search fellowship from the American Council
of Learned Societies.
Harold Kahn, a scholar of Chinese history
was praised by Wessells for being "very high

on content with a wonderful style of teach
ing."
Kahn is known for his "famous detailed let
ters of recommendation" for students, and he
was praised by a colleague as a teacher who,
"cares deeply about his students as people,
not just as intellectual artifacts," Wessells said.
MacCormack was lauded by History De
partment Chairman Paul Robinson. He said
MacCormack, "represents the Stanford ideal:
a fusion of intellectual and pedagogical cal
lings, a person for whom the life of scholar
ship and the life of teaching don't entail sepa
rate modes of discourse."
Rebholz, who received the Dean's Award
in 1976, is the first faculty member to receive
this award twice. Rebholz, a Rhodes scholar,
has taught at Stanford since 1961. He has
been a Wilson and Danforth fellow, and he
won the Dinkelspiel Award for contributions
to undergraduate education at Stanford in
1981.
Other award recipients, Samuelson and
Fayer also recieved high praise from the
