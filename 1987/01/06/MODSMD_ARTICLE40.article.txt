### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has
awarded the University a challenge grant of $650,000 toward
the Humanities Center and the special collections in Jewish
studies.
Each II of an NEH challenge grant must be matched with
$3 in private donations. Stanford's challenge grant must he
matched by almost $2 million in private contributions to
total $2.6 million.
"It begins to get fairly sizable when you add the match
ing dollars," said Mort Sosna, associate director of the
Humanities Center.
Income from the Humanities Center's share of the grant
will support faculty fellow positions, according to Sosna.
"Endowment funds for humanities programs are difficult
to raise, particularly for fellowships. Faculty fellows are the
principal reason for having this center. That's one of the
reasons why this grant is so important," Sosna said.
The money toward the Jewish studies collections will be
divided into three portions if the funds are matched, accord
ing to Director of University Libraries David Weber.
Part of the funds will go toward the establishment of the
position of a collection curator who "will assure sound de
velopment and management of that collection for decades,"
Weber said.
The income from the endowment will also support con

senation treatment of books in the Salo Baron collection,
according to Weber.
"The physical preservation of these materials is critical tor
supporting the teaching and research in Jewish studies,
Weber said.
The income will also go toward a book fund for future ac
quisitions, Weber said.
"The grant is a very critical support in building a long
term sound library program and helping the Jewish studies
faculty," Weber said.
The Stanford Development Office will work to raise the
matching funds for the NEH grant, according to Sosna.
"We'll be working with them to identify potential
donors," Sosna said.
Stanford's NEH grant was announced on Dec. 11, along
with challenge grants to 40 other educational institutions
totaling $14.2 million.
Stanford received one other NEH challenge grant, in
1978. By 1982, the University matched the $1.5 million en
dowment with $4.5 million in private donations.
NEH Chairman Lynne Cheney announced the recent chal
lenge grant.
"The humanities programs of these grant winners have
often served as a connecting link between what our society
is today and what it has been, one that helps us understand
the present by examining the past through museum exhibi
tions, college courses, scholarly research and library pro
grams," she said.
