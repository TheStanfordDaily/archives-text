# Petition assailing library site to go before trustees
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
Before beginning his quarter-long sabbatical,
University President Donald Kennedy agreed to
convey to the University Board of Trustees a pe
tition of 3,500 signatures presented to him by a
group challenging the planned site for the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
The petition organizers, the Stanford Area
Residents to Guarantee Open Space (ARGOS).
submitted the protest to Kennedy on Dec. 12,
after the trustees refused to accept the petition
at their December meeting.
But it is unlikely that the petition will per
suade the board to reverse its decision on the
library site.
"I don't see any point to (the petition)," said
Charles Palm, University archivist and represen
tative of the Ronald Reagan Foundation on
campus. "We've already made the site selection
and design decision," he said.
There has already been a public discussion
of the issue, and the community overwhelm
ingly supported the construction of the library.
Palm said. Eighty percent of the letters to a
committee chaired by acting University Presi
dent James Rosse supported the library as a
source of research, he added.
Petition organizers, however, in explaining

why the petition is only now being submitted,
said that when the issue was publicly discussed,
"ommunity members were not aware that the
ibrary would approximate the inner quad in
.ize.
Petition organizer Laura Esserman, a resident
urgeon at Stanford Hospital, said "opposition
o the library w ill continue to grow in conjunc
ion with community awareness of the scope of
the project.
"As it is currently envisioned the library
museum complex will permanently and un
necessarily mar the beauty and tranquility of
Stanford's golden fcxnhills," she added
Esserman criticized the facility for not
meeting the "low intensity academic use" re
quirement for structures in the fix>thills, and
she noted that 99.5 percent of the visitors will
be tourists, not scholars.
The design and dimensions of the complex
"far outstrip the needs of a pure academic
facility. Esserman said, citing the library's two
tiered. 300-space parking lot as an example of
this public orientation.
Since the bulk of traffic w ill be non-campus
visitors, a site closer to the freeway would be
"infinitely preferable to one which adds to the
traffic of our already congested campus roads,
she added.
A study of traffic patterns at other presiden

tial libraries show that there are 1,000 tourists
for every scholar visiting the library, according
to Sam Brain, a petition organizer and re
searcher in radiology at Stanford Hospital.
"A tourist attraction should not be on land
reserved for academic needs," he said.
Palm defended the academic value of the li
brary and called it a rich addition to the aca
demic atmosphere on the campus. For eight
years of U.S. history, it will contain the
definitive documents on public policy, he said.
Scholars will be able to explore issues such as
national defense, economics and national
health policy, which have marked the Reagan
era, he said.
Palm added that the Reagan Library archives
will be larger than the entire Hoover Institution
archives, which consist of 4,000 different collec
tions. While the Hoover Archives have 32,000
linear feet of materials, the Reagan Library will
have 40,000 linear feet â€” equivalent to
80,000,000 sheets of paper.
While Esserman said she did not challenge
the academic resources of the library, she
asked "how a catering kitchen, a 350 seat
auditorium, a 100 seat movie theater, four
meeting rooms, a presidential suite and a
museum facility - satisfy - an academic purpose.
Since its presentation of the petition, ARGOS

has also sent a letter to the county planning
commission to reconsider its December deci
sion that the Reagan Library is consistent with a
low-intensity usage of the land.
In the December hearing, the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission ruled by a vote of
4-2 that the library design was consistent with
academic low intensity use of the land.
Esserman said ARGOS requested a second
hearing because of inaccuracies in the library
representatives' report and because the com
missioners on the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission never had a chance to review the
information ARGOS presented.
While library representatives said that the
facility was consistent with neighboring
structures, specifically the Center for Behav
ioral Sciences, the library will be 15 times
larger than its neighbor, and it will be visible
from the road, Brain said.
The lighting and security requirements of the
library will also be inconsistent with the open
spaced character of the land, he added
Palm said the library designers are working
with members of the community to iron out the
details of construction, such as minimizing the
effect of the library's light on night observation
at the student observatory. Library planners are
also meeting with representatives of the

Homeowner's Association on ways to preserve
the rural nature of the library's access road, he
said.
The next stage in the construction process is
the creation of an environmental impact report,
which will comprehensively examine the ef
fects of the library on traffic, wildlife and the
neighboring areas.
Esserman said the next stage in ARGOS fight
against the library site would be to unite with
other organizations concerned about the foot
hills site into one large umbrella group.
Groups that have formed to combat the pro
posed library site include ARGOS, the Stanford
Foothills Residence Group and the Committee
for Green Foothills.
The petitioners are not the only critics of the
library. Plans for an auditorium, included in the
library- complex design, have been attacked in
the Faculty Senate
All the other presidential libraries have
modest conference and lecture series," Palm
noted in defense of the auditorium.
"We want to include space for such confer
ences ... (suitable for) five or six events a
year, Palm said. These might include two
scholarly conferences related to the library
holdings and visits by the former president
