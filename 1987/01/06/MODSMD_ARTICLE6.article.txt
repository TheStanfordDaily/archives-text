# Suspended player criticizes NCAA
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Senior defensive tackle Tony Leiker, one of two
Stanford football players suspended from the
Dec. 27 Gator Bowl for using banned substances,
said yesterday that he was disappointed with the
incident and the way it was handled by the NCAA.
"I kind of don't want to talk about it," Leiker
said. "It was something bad in my life, and 1 want
to put it behind me and get on with my life. I
agree with getting tough on drugs, but I disagree
with the way the NCAA went about it."
Leiker and third-year sophomore offensive
tackle John Zentner both admitted to using
anabolic steroids for a brief time over the sum
mer. Zentner could not be reached for comment
last night.
Steroids are used by athletes to improve
strength, but possible side effects include sterility,
and the synthetic hormones have been linked to
the deaths of otherwise healthy athletes.
Leiker reiterated a statement he issued to the
Times Tribune before the game, saying, "I took
steroids for a short time this summer. Conse
quently, the NCAA has ruled me ineligible to play
in the Gator Bowl. 1 admit I made a mistake. I
apologize to the people I know I disappointed."
A player who declined to be identified said he
understood Leiker's motivation for taking
steroids. "A team comes down here with an offen
sive line bigger than an NFL team, you know
they're cheating, you know they're taking some
thing. You want him to go out and win for you
against those guys. I think Tony thought he had to

hold up his part for the team against those guys.
He didn't want to let the team down."
The player referred to an article that appeared
in Sports Illustrated two years ago in which a
former NFL lineman who had used steroids wrote
of widespread use throughout the league. "You
read that story in Sports Illustrated. You know
how many guys use them."
Leiker, who was named to the All-Pacific 10
Conference first team and honorable mention All-
America by the Associated Press, stands a good
chance of being drafted by an NFL team.
"I'm glad we won eight games this year," Leiker
said. "I'm glad the team went to a bowl game. I'm
pissed I got caught and couldn't play. I just want
to get on with my life now."
The Stanford team was tested by the NCAA on
Dec. 9. Of 36 teams that played in bowls, only 20
were tested. The legislation passed by the NCAA
last January provided for random testing of ath
letes involved in postseason competition. Twenty
two starters and 14 reserves were tested from
Stanford.
The results were supposed to be kept con
fidential to protect athletes from public scrutiny,
but speculation about why Leiker and Zentner did
not travel to the game in Jacksonville, Fla., eventu
ally forced both to issue statements admitting to
being banned from the game and having used
steroids.
Stanford was one of a handful of schools to
have voted against the drug testing, which in
cluded street drugs like marijuana and cocaine,
performance-enhancing drugs like steroids and
amphetamines, and common drugs like caffeine.
