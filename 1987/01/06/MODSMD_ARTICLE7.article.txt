# University responds to reformed tax laws
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
In response to the new tax laws that went into
effect Jan. 1, the University is making several one
time only adjustments to help students during
1987 and is investigating political avenues for
long-term resolutions, according to Dean of
Graduate Studies Elizabeth Traugott.
On Dec. 22, graduate research assistants and
teaching assistants received their last paycheck —
two weeks earlier than the normal Jan. 7 pay date.
According to Accounting Officer Chris Cannel
los, the University decided to make the payment
before 1987 so that it would not be affected by the
new tax laws. He said this one-time only change
exemplifies the University's approach to the taxa
tion issue: "We're taking it as it comes," he said.
The next deadline for action is on Jan. 22 when
graduate TAs and RAs will receive their first 1987
paychecks, Cannellos said. On that date, the Uni
versity must definitively decide how RA and TA
stipends will be affected by the tax laws.
Another item of interest to the University is
whether the new tax laws will exempt multi-year
awards made before August 17, 1986. The Univer
sity hopes to use National Science Foundation
grants, federally funded fellowships lasting for
three years, as a test case for the status of these
grants.
The University's long-term objective is to seek
the resolution of the nebulous tax issues in the

students' favor at the federal and state level, said
Traugott.
There is no way to preserve tax exemption on
graduate students' stipends, hut Congress may
change its stance and exempt tuition reduction
given to RAs and TAs, she said.
Traugott said the taxation of stipends was dis
cussed extensively during the creation of the
1986 tax reform laws. Since it affects students at
public and private universities equally, it is con
sistent with the ideals of the reform act, she said.
Private universities, however, may be able to
change Congress' mind on taxing tuition reduc
tions, she said. This addition to the tax laws ap
peared at the end of the congressional session,
and it was not clear that the congressmen were
fully aware of the ramifications of the issue, she
said.
Unlike the taxes on a stipend, this tax provision
"makes a fundamental distinction between
private and public universities," she said. Because
the tuition costs at private universities are gener
ally far higher than at state universities, the tax
burden on graduate students at private univer
sities will become far greater.
Traugott said private universities will try to
promote a legislative amendment this year that
will rectify the situation.
The next stage will be to lobby state
legislatures, she said, and prevent the unfavorable
tax laws from entering into the state legislative
system.
