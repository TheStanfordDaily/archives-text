Missile fired at Navy helicopter
WASHINGTON — A Navy helicopter flying a routine surveillance mis
sion in the Persian Gulf was fired upon unexpectedly yesterday as it ap
proached a merchant ship, the Pentagon said yesterday.
The attack, which involved the firing of a single surface-to-air missile, oc
curred about 7:30 a.m. EST as the chopper flew over Persian Gulf waters to
the northwest of the United Arab Emirates.
The helicopter took immediate evasive action upon spotting the missile
and the missile "passed within about 500 feet," the Pentagon said. <
The chopper immediately returned to its ship, the destroyer O'Bannon,
without further incident.
The helicopter, an SH-2 Seasprite anti-submarine chopper, had been dis
patched from the O'Bannon to ascertain the identity and national flag of the
merchant ship.
Such surveillance is conducted routinely by the handful of ships kept by
the Navy in the Persian Gulf.
The Pentagon, in a prepared statement, said it did not know the identity
of the merchant ship nor did it know the type of missile that was fired.
As the toll on commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf has mounted,
there have been reports that commercial ships have taken to arming them
selves with surface-to-air missiles.
Lawyers fight for hotel access
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Lawyers representing the Dupont Plaza Hotel
and victims' families fought yesterday over access to the luxury hotel where
evidence is sought in the New Year's Eve fire that killed 96 people.
Hotel employees gave videotaped depositions to company lawyers yes
terday. Investigators say the fire that raged through the lower floors of the
20-story luxury, beachfront hotel was caused by arson, but they are not
sure who set the blaze or how it started.
The hotel, owned by a Delaware company, filed a petition in District
Court yesterday asking it be notified before any private party is allowed to
visit the premises.
"We are very concerned that critical evidence of this crime be preserved
and therefore, we are asking all the authorities and the courts to make sure
access to the hotel be restricted until all the evidence is secure," said Bruce
Shulman, the hotel's director.
The premises are under the control of state and federal authorities, who
have restricted entry. Guests have not been allowed to return to their
rooms and have been told their possessions will be shipped to them later.
But John Coale, a Washington lawyer who said he represents nine
families of people who died in the fire, said he planned to file a motion to
seal the hotel "so we can have our experts there also."
Andrew Vita, head of a special 30-member team from the Treasury De
partment's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said yesterday: "Our
site investigation will continue through the day ... and probably be con
cluded at the end of the day tomorrow.
"We have found no physical evidence of an explosive device or bomb. I
think that is clear," Vita said, adding that tests conducted on material flown
to the team's suburban Washington laboratory should provide more clues.
Witnesses at the hotel's pool and nearby beach have testified they heard
explosions at about the time of the fire, which destroyed the casino, lobby
and ballroom on the first two floors and spread smoke through the build
ing.
Authorities have refused to name any suspects in the fire, although Gov.
Rafael Hernandez Colon said arson was thought a possibility from the start
because of hotel management's dispute with the Teamsters Union.
The union has denied involvement in the fire.
Reformers rebuke students
PEKING — More than 500 Peking University students yesterday burned
copies of a state-run newspaper that harshly criticized pro-democracy
demonstrations, as reform-minded officials spoke out against student activ
ism.
Students standing in circles burned hundreds of copies of the Peking
Daily and cheered as they tossed the flaming papers into the air during an
hour-long protest near the school cafeteria, where posters advocating
democracy have been put up.
Conservatives in the Communist Party and government have harshly
criticized students protests which have been staged in at least 10 cities, but
yesterday high-ranking officials belonging to the reform-minded circle
around top leader Deng Xiaoping spoke out for the first time.
"Creating movements' does nothing to help the construction of a demo
cratic government," Bao Tong, a senior official in Prime Minister Zhao
Ziyang's office, wrote in a commentary in the People's Daily newspaper.
Students in dormitories tossed copies of the Peking Daily, some of which
were on fire, out of windows and one student let down a flaming streamer
made of copies of the newspaper that had written on it, "To hell with the
Peking Daily."
"There won't be any more demonstrations because exams have started,
and now we (government and students) are even. It's about 1-1," one stu
dent said.
Student posters have expressed anger at the Peking Daily, a propaganda
arm of the city government, saying it had been less accurate in accounts of
protests than other state-run media.
Workers protest Aquino official
MANILA, Philippines — Hundreds of militant workers barricaded the
Labor Ministry building here for the second day yesterday to protest against
the appointment of Franklin Drilon as the new labor minister in the
Philippines Cabinet.
Anti-riot police and firetrucks stood guard a few yards from the site
while workers began a march on the presidential palace to ask President
Corazon Aquino to revoke the appointment.
The president announced Saturday that Drilon, 41, a lawyer, would
succeed Augusto Sanchez. Sanchez, a human-rights lawyer before he was
drafted into Aquino's government, appeared to have displeased manage
ment over his pro-labor policies.
Workers belonging to the left-leaning May One Movement, pointing to
Drilon's previous work as an attorney for several business establishments,
called the new minister "a stooge of big business."
Business leaders have been reluctant to make any new moves to perk up
the economy and the selection of Drilon appears to be a concession by
Aquino to get industry support, political analysts here feel.
Workers surrounded the Labor Ministry building and blocked the main
road with huge red streamers and placards expressing support for the
ousted Sanchez, the fifth official in Aquino's cabinet to receive his walking
papers in two months.
Deukmejian urges self-reliance
SACRAMENTO — George Deukmejian began his second term as Califor
nia governor yesterday with an inaugural address stressing individual self
reliance and the limits on how much government can do for citizens.
Although the Republican governor avoided former Gov. Jerry Brown's
"era of limits'" slogans, which Deukmejian ridiculed throughout his first
term, the dominant theme of Deukmejian's inaugural was remarkably
similar to that of his Democratic predecessor in saying that Californians
must lower their expectations of what government can do for them.
"If the people relv only on Washington and Sacramento to meet every
need, provide even- service, tackle even, problem and determine even.'
goal, then surely we will fail to climb every mountain and California will
have squandered its greatest gift, the initiative, talent and spirit of free
citizens standing on their own." Deukmejian said.
Addressing an estimated 3.000 supporters from the Capitol steps, the Re
publican governor listed schools, highways, toxic cleanup programs and
tax simplification among his top priorities for the coming year.

Workers protest Aquino official
MANILA, Philippines — Hundreds of militant workers barricaded the
Labor Ministry building here for the second day yesterday to protest against
the appointment of Franklin Drilon as the new labor minister in the
Philippines Cabinet.
Anti-riot police and firetrucks stood guard a few yards from the site
while workers began a march on the presidential palace to ask President
Corazon Aquino to revoke the appointment.
The president announced Saturday that Drilon, 41, a lawyer, would
succeed Augusto Sanchez. Sanchez, a human-rights lawyer before he was
drafted into Aquino's government, appeared to have displeased manage
ment over his pro-labor policies.
Workers belonging to the left-leaning May One Movement, pointing to
Drilon's previous work as an attorney for several business establishments,
called the new minister "a stooge of big business."
Business leaders have been reluctant to make any new moves to perk up
the economy and the selection of Drilon appears to be a concession by
Aquino to get industry support, political analysts here feel.
Workers surrounded the Labor Ministry building and blocked the main
road with huge red streamers and placards expressing support for the
ousted Sanchez, the fifth official in Aquino's cabinet to receive his walking
papers in two months.
Deukmejian urges self-reliance
SACRAMENTO — George Deukmejian began his second term as Califor
nia governor yesterday with an inaugural address stressing individual self
reliance and the limits on how much government can do for citizens.
Although the Republican governor avoided former Gov. Jerry Brown's
"era of limits'" slogans, which Deukmejian ridiculed throughout his first
term, the dominant theme of Deukmejian's inaugural was remarkably
similar to that of his Democratic predecessor in saying that Californians
must lower their expectations of what government can do for them.
"If the people relv only on Washington and Sacramento to meet every
need, provide even- service, tackle even, problem and determine even.'
goal, then surely we will fail to climb every mountain and California will
have squandered its greatest gift, the initiative, talent and spirit of free
citizens standing on their own." Deukmejian said.
Addressing an estimated 3.000 supporters from the Capitol steps, the Re
publican governor listed schools, highways, toxic cleanup programs and
tax simplification among his top priorities for the coming year.

Missile fired at Navy helicopter
WASHINGTON — A Navy helicopter flying a routine surveillance mis
sion in the Persian Gulf was fired upon unexpectedly yesterday as it ap
proached a merchant ship, the Pentagon said yesterday.
The attack, which involved the firing of a single surface-to-air missile, oc
curred about 7:30 a.m. EST as the chopper flew over Persian Gulf waters to
the northwest of the United Arab Emirates.
The helicopter took immediate evasive action upon spotting the missile
and the missile "passed within about 500 feet," the Pentagon said. <
The chopper immediately returned to its ship, the destroyer O'Bannon,
without further incident.
The helicopter, an SH-2 Seasprite anti-submarine chopper, had been dis
patched from the O'Bannon to ascertain the identity and national flag of the
merchant ship.
Such surveillance is conducted routinely by the handful of ships kept by
the Navy in the Persian Gulf.
The Pentagon, in a prepared statement, said it did not know the identity
of the merchant ship nor did it know the type of missile that was fired.
As the toll on commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf has mounted,
there have been reports that commercial ships have taken to arming them
selves with surface-to-air missiles.
Lawyers fight for hotel access
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Lawyers representing the Dupont Plaza Hotel
and victims' families fought yesterday over access to the luxury hotel where
evidence is sought in the New Year's Eve fire that killed 96 people.
Hotel employees gave videotaped depositions to company lawyers yes
terday. Investigators say the fire that raged through the lower floors of the
20-story luxury, beachfront hotel was caused by arson, but they are not
sure who set the blaze or how it started.
The hotel, owned by a Delaware company, filed a petition in District
Court yesterday asking it be notified before any private party is allowed to
visit the premises.
"We are very concerned that critical evidence of this crime be preserved
and therefore, we are asking all the authorities and the courts to make sure
access to the hotel be restricted until all the evidence is secure," said Bruce
Shulman, the hotel's director.
The premises are under the control of state and federal authorities, who
have restricted entry. Guests have not been allowed to return to their
rooms and have been told their possessions will be shipped to them later.
But John Coale, a Washington lawyer who said he represents nine
families of people who died in the fire, said he planned to file a motion to
seal the hotel "so we can have our experts there also."
Andrew Vita, head of a special 30-member team from the Treasury De
partment's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said yesterday: "Our
site investigation will continue through the day ... and probably be con
cluded at the end of the day tomorrow.
"We have found no physical evidence of an explosive device or bomb. I
think that is clear," Vita said, adding that tests conducted on material flown
to the team's suburban Washington laboratory should provide more clues.
Witnesses at the hotel's pool and nearby beach have testified they heard
explosions at about the time of the fire, which destroyed the casino, lobby
and ballroom on the first two floors and spread smoke through the build
ing.
Authorities have refused to name any suspects in the fire, although Gov.
Rafael Hernandez Colon said arson was thought a possibility from the start
because of hotel management's dispute with the Teamsters Union.
The union has denied involvement in the fire.
Reformers rebuke students
PEKING — More than 500 Peking University students yesterday burned
copies of a state-run newspaper that harshly criticized pro-democracy
demonstrations, as reform-minded officials spoke out against student activ
ism.
Students standing in circles burned hundreds of copies of the Peking
Daily and cheered as they tossed the flaming papers into the air during an
hour-long protest near the school cafeteria, where posters advocating
democracy have been put up.
Conservatives in the Communist Party and government have harshly
criticized students protests which have been staged in at least 10 cities, but
yesterday high-ranking officials belonging to the reform-minded circle
around top leader Deng Xiaoping spoke out for the first time.
"Creating movements' does nothing to help the construction of a demo
cratic government," Bao Tong, a senior official in Prime Minister Zhao
Ziyang's office, wrote in a commentary in the People's Daily newspaper.
Students in dormitories tossed copies of the Peking Daily, some of which
were on fire, out of windows and one student let down a flaming streamer
