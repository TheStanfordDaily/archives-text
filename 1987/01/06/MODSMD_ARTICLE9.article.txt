# Budget encounters opposition
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan proposed the
nation's first trillion-dollar budget yesterday and ran
into immediate congressional skepticism over his
plans to trim the deficit and cut dozens of domestic
programs while still adding billions to Pentagon
spending.
The $1,024 trillion budget for the 1988 fiscal year
— an increase of 0.9 percent over estimated spend
ing for this year — renewed the attack on the soaring
budget deficits that have bedeviled the country
during the Reagan presidency.
But Reagan held firm against any general tax in
crease to reduce the red ink. Rep. Jim Wright CD-
Texas), who will become speaker of the House, last
month proposed increasing taxes on the wealthy to
combat the deficit, but found little support.
Reagan, saying his plan would "put the worst of the
deficit problem behind us," proposed a $42 billion
package of cuts of domestic programs, sales of
federal assets and higher user fees, even though
many of these ideas had been proposed in his previ
ous budgets and rejected by Congress.
Reagan did ask for one major new program, $1 bil
lion to help find new careers for workers who have
lost jobs in import-battered industries. He also
sought $500 million to combat the disease AIDS and
$1 billion more to modernize the nation's air traffic
control system.
The federal deficit Reagan projects for fiscal 1988

would be just under the $108 billion in red ink
allowed by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing
law.
Put on the chopping block are farm commodity
programs, Amtrak rail service, college student loans,
food stamps, housing programs and mass transit —
all targeted for either deep cuts or elimination.
Farm programs would come in for some of the
deepest cuts of all with commodity programs, which
include support payments for wheat, corn and milk,
cut to less than $21.3 billion, from $25.3 billion this
year.
The proposed changes would reduce government
farm target prices by 10 percent next year, while the
current maximum that an individual farmer can
receive would be cut from $250,000 to $50,000.
Reagan proposed eliminating Amtrak rail subsidies
entirely and selling the corporation's Washington-
New York-Boston line.
The budget sought an increase in defense spend
ing authority to $312 billion, up from the $292.9 bil
lion for the current fiscal year. While this would be
the smallest military increase yet sought by Reagan, it
is certain to meet widespread congressional opposi
tion as still being far too generous to the military.
The new budget calls for $1.7 trillion in military
outlays over the next five years, a figure Reagan said
represented what is "minimally necessary to main
tain national security."

After he doubled the total national debt to more
than $2 trillion during his first six years in office,"
Reagan said the country had finally turned the corner
in its battle to get the deficit under control. He cited
progress under the year-old Gramm-Rudman law,
which seeks to eliminate annual deficits by 1991. ;
Although the law has been partially invalidated by'
the Supreme Court, Reagan told Congress its targets
should be heeded anyway.
But Democrats, who now control both chambers''
of Congress for the first time since Reagan entered
the White House in 1981, indicated that the new'*
Reagan budget will face the same struggle that its'"
predecessors encountered.
Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), the new Senate
majority leader, criticized the budget, contending ]
that it would slash education aid by 25 percent over'
the next five years while allowing defense spending'
to grow by $20 billion a year.
The administration's budget is based on a White
House forecast that the economy will grow by 3-2
percent in 1987 and by 3.7 percent in 1988, increas*-' 1
ing tax revenues along with it. That is considerably
higher than private forecasts, which expect growth
this year to be about 2.5 percent, very close to the''
lackluster performance in 1986.

WASHINGTON — President Reagan proposed the
nation's first trillion-dollar budget yesterday and ran
into immediate congressional skepticism over his
plans to trim the deficit and cut dozens of domestic
programs while still adding billions to Pentagon
spending.
The $1,024 trillion budget for the 1988 fiscal year
— an increase of 0.9 percent over estimated spend
ing for this year — renewed the attack on the soaring
budget deficits that have bedeviled the country
during the Reagan presidency.
But Reagan held firm against any general tax in
crease to reduce the red ink. Rep. Jim Wright CD-
Texas), who will become speaker of the House, last
month proposed increasing taxes on the wealthy to
combat the deficit, but found little support.
Reagan, saying his plan would "put the worst of the
deficit problem behind us," proposed a $42 billion
package of cuts of domestic programs, sales of
federal assets and higher user fees, even though
many of these ideas had been proposed in his previ
ous budgets and rejected by Congress.
Reagan did ask for one major new program, $1 bil
lion to help find new careers for workers who have
lost jobs in import-battered industries. He also
sought $500 million to combat the disease AIDS and
$1 billion more to modernize the nation's air traffic
control system.
The federal deficit Reagan projects for fiscal 1988

would be just under the $108 billion in red ink
allowed by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing
law.
Put on the chopping block are farm commodity
programs, Amtrak rail service, college student loans,
food stamps, housing programs and mass transit —
all targeted for either deep cuts or elimination.
Farm programs would come in for some of the
deepest cuts of all with commodity programs, which
include support payments for wheat, corn and milk,
cut to less than $21.3 billion, from $25.3 billion this
year.
The proposed changes would reduce government
farm target prices by 10 percent next year, while the
current maximum that an individual farmer can
receive would be cut from $250,000 to $50,000.
Reagan proposed eliminating Amtrak rail subsidies
entirely and selling the corporation's Washington-
New York-Boston line.
The budget sought an increase in defense spend
ing authority to $312 billion, up from the $292.9 bil
lion for the current fiscal year. While this would be
the smallest military increase yet sought by Reagan, it
is certain to meet widespread congressional opposi
tion as still being far too generous to the military.
The new budget calls for $1.7 trillion in military
outlays over the next five years, a figure Reagan said
represented what is "minimally necessary to main
tain national security."

After he doubled the total national debt to more
than $2 trillion during his first six years in office,"
Reagan said the country had finally turned the corner
in its battle to get the deficit under control. He cited
progress under the year-old Gramm-Rudman law,
which seeks to eliminate annual deficits by 1991. ;
Although the law has been partially invalidated by'
the Supreme Court, Reagan told Congress its targets
should be heeded anyway.
