# Congress creates Iran committees
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The 100 th
Congress convened under full Demo
cratic control yesterday as both houses
cleared the way for select committees
to probe the Iran-contra scandal and
braced for a major clash with President
Reagan over budget priorities for fiscal
1988.
The Senate, with Democrats in com
mand for the first time since Reagan
took office, passed legislation creating
an 11-member investigative panel.
To overcome Republican anxiety
that the probe could drag into next
year's presidential campaign, the Sen
ate agreed to aim for a final report by
Aug. 1 but reserved the right to extend
the deadline to Oct. 30, as proposed
earlier by Democrats, if a majority of

the Senate decides that more time is
needed.
A dispute over scope of the inquiry
was resolved when Sen. Daniel Inouye
(D-Hawaii), who will be chairman of
the special panel, agreed under ques
tioning from vice chairman Warren
Rudman (R-N.H.) to confine probes
into private funding of the Nicaraguan
contras to situations involving "direct
or indirect government involvement."
In the House, Democratic and Re
publican leaders got unanimous agree
ment to bring the resolution creating a
15-member House committee to a vote
Wednesday. A compromise version of
the resolution, including an Oct. 30
termination date, was hammered out

by a bipartisan group of House leaders
on Monday.
Both houses ushered in new leader
ship, as determined earlier by party
caucuses.
In the House, where Democrats
slightly expanded their majority in last
November's elections, Rep. Jim Wright
(D-Tex.) was elevated from majority
leader to speaker, succeeding Thomas
(Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.), who retired
from the House. In the Senate, where
Democrats ended six years of Republi
can rule after winning a 55-to-45
majority in the November elections,
Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) took over
as majority leader from Sen. Robert
Dole (R-Kan.) who will serve as
minority leader.

With Reagan on the defensive from
the Democratic takeover and the furor
over the sale of arms to Iran and appar
ent diversion of profits to aid the
rebels fighting the government of
Nicaragua, the administration received
little encouragement, even from
Republicans, about prospects for the
record $1 trillion budget he sent to
Congress Monday.
"I don't think the budget has a
prayer," said Dole on "CBS Morning
News," suggesting that it includes
some "smoke and mirrors," as Demo
crats have charged. "I think it's a start
ing point; that's about all that can be
said for it,"he added.
