For the past decade, one of the raging
debates about South Africa has been the
role of American business there. Would U.S.
companies with operations in South Africa
be a more progressive force against apart
lii'id by staying there or by withdrawing?
(There are different modes of withdrawal,
ranging from complete disassociation to a
paper transfer of ownership while main
taining a close business association, but we
do not attempt to make this important dis
tinction here.)
Some shareholders and others have fer
vently advocated withdrawal — largely on
moral grounds. However, until recently,
most American companies have resisted
these urgings. Then, in the last couple of
years, an exodus has begun, largely on eco
nomic grounds.
Approximately 20 percent of the Ameri
can companies there two years ago now
have withdrawn, and such giants as IBM,
General Motors, Coca-Cola and Eastman
Kodak have recently announced their inten
tion to disinvest. What should the remain
ing companies do? That is the focus of this
discussion paper. In the first section, we lay
out the commonly voiced rationale for not
withdrawing. Then we turn to the com
monly voiced rationale supporting
withdrawal. (Since the latter rationale tends
to be more intangible, and so requires
more explanation, the second section is
considerably longer than the first.)
Rationale for not moving toward U.S.
withdrawal
Withdrawal would hurt rather than
help blacks
1. If American companies were to leave
South Africa, it would hurt rather than help
blacks there because some blacks would
lose jobs and suffer from a deteriorating
economy. [ 9,12 J
2. The investors buying the assets of

withdrawing American companies would
tend to be less progressive, thereby un
doing many if not all of the affirmative ac
tion programs of the American companies.
3- The withdrawal of American compan
ies would remove a badly needed source of
assistance for improving the quality of life
for blacks outside the work environment.
[1]
4. South Africa's blacks (and the blacks in
neighboring countries that are highly de
pendent economically on South Africa)
would be most affected by disinvestment
while white South Africans would suffer
little.[ 7 ]
5 If withdrawal results in simply leaving
the company's assets in the hands of an
other white power group, then the "moral
statement" of withdrawal becomes an act
with immoral consequences. The focus
should be on how to help empower black
South Africans (economically, politically
and educationally) rather than how to best
express moral outrage.
6. A strong South African economy has
improved the condition of blacks more
than any other factor. The ever-increasing
need for skilled labor must include blacks.
[7]
7. The best ways that American compan
ies in South Africa can help blacks there are
a) to contribute to a strong, growing eco
nomy that provides economic benefits for
all, and b) to accompany this with strong af
firmative action that can help raise blacks
toward assimilation into white society.
Withdrawal would have political dis
advantages
1. The withdrawal of American compan
ies would remove a strong voice of reason
calling for the dismantling of apartheid.
[ 10,8 ]
2. Withdrawal as a means of exerting eco
nomic pressure is likely to be futile and un
productive. Capital markets are intensely
competitive and increasingly international;
withdrawal by an American company will
have no real effect on the South African eco
nomy since the physical plant and the per
sonnel will remain in South Africa. Further
more, South Africa has a highly developed
economy and is not especialy vulnerable to
economic pressure. [ 7]
3. Sanctions historically have been
remarkably unsuccessful as a means of in
ternational persuasion. Although
withdrawal as a form of sanction may bring
economic suffering to a country, it is
unlikely to produce political reform. [ 7 ]

4. Withdrawal of key American industries
may encourage South Africa to build its
own replacement industries (as happened
following the arms embargo), which would
further strengthen its economy and bolster
its independence. [ 7 ]
5. Because of strong pressures on Ameri
can companies in South Africa to disinvest,
they may be forced to sell at fire-sale prices
to white South Africans, which has both
economic and political benefits for the
South African government.
6. By leaving behind American capital
and technology in South Africa, the
withdrawal of American companies may
have the effect of strengthening the
Afrikaner bourgeoisie. [ 7 ]
7. If American companies in South Africa
attempt to pressure the South African gov
ernment into reform by threatening to
withdraw or actually withdrawing, the
result may be to push the government into
a more rigid stance instead.
8. Although American companies in
South Africa pay substantial taxes to the
South African government, disinvesting
would simply result in the new owners
paying those same taxes.
Rationale for moving toward U.S.
withdrawal
Despite their positive efforts, Ameri
can companies generally have had a
net negative Impact in South Africa
(See preceding discussion paper [ 6 ] for
details and documentation for this subsec
tion.)
1. To evaluate the net impact of American
companies in South Africa, first note that
their commendable positive efforts out
lined in the preceding discussion paper
[ 6 ] are very limited in scope. They employ
only a tiny fraction (0.7 percent) of the
black labor force, mostly at the unskilled
labor level. Averaged over the black popula
tion of South Africa, their per capita expen
ditures for affirmative action and social pro
grams to help blacks have totaled less than
$1 per year. Their lobbying efforts with the
South African government also have had
minimal impact. [ 9, pl 6 ]
2. To prepare now for tallying the
negative end of the scale, note that apart
heid is the central issue, not jobs or social
programs. Every black South African suffers
from apartheid. Apartheid is the law, and
,the positive efforts of American companies
in South Africa do nothing to change its
structure. On the other hand, the presence

of American companies has reinforced
apartheid in a variety of ways (detailed
below), thereby harming all 24 million
South African blacks while benefiting a
relatively tiny number.
3. Taxes paid to the South African govern
ment by all American companies (direct
support for apartheid) have dwarfed the
companies' expenditures to help blacks.
The effect of disinvestment of future tax rev
enues for the South African government is
complex and depends on circumstances,
but the common effect may well be a sub
stantial reduction in these revenues. For ex
ample, consider the common situation
where South Africans use their available
capital to purchase the assets and continue
the operations of a withdrawing American
company rather than using this capital for
other productive purposes that would
generate additional taxes of a comparable
magnitude. Even though the South Africans
purchasing the company will continue to
pay the company's taxes, the net result is a
reduction in total tax revenues of a compa
rable magnitude. Furthermore, the
withdrawal of American know-how may
also reduce the company's future profits
and taxes. Finally, because of the multiplier
effect of money, the long-run economic im
pact of disinvestment could even reduce
total tax revenues by far more than previ
ously paid by the company.
4. Several different laws require compan
ies with operations in South Africa to supply
specified goods and services to the govern
ment. Even when it is voluntary, "refusing
to do business with the South African
police, military and other government
agencies charged with enforcing aparthied
also is generally rejected by American com
panies." [ B,pi2 ]
5. Other laws (e.g, the National Key
Points Act) require American companies in
South Africa to cooperate with the govern
ment in other ways as well. In a June 1984
survey of black South African workers, 91
percent of the workers — including 100
percent of those employed by U.S. compan
ies — said that employers "work with and
support the government.'' [ 14, p3 ].
6. The various forms of partnership be
tween the South African government and
American companies there signal an accep
tance of apartheid that has placed on it a
stamp of legitimacy, thereby reinforcing the
faith of South African whites in the validity
of their policies. Admiration for the United
States makes this impact particularly

pronounced.
7. The capital and advanced technology
provided by U.S. business have reinforced
the economic and military status quo in
South Africa, thereby enabling the South
African government to entrench apartheid
more firmly.
8. With their capital-intensive, high tech
approach, American companies in South
Africa employ a disproportionately small
number of blacks. Therefore, U.S. invest
ment has quite consistently served to sup
port the South African government's central
goal of industrializing white South Africa,
generally through replacing black workers,
in order to reinforce apartheid ( separation
of the races).
9. Since the South African economy is
dominated by the state sector, which con
trols some 60 percent of South Africa's fixed
capital, the support provided to the South
African economy by American companies is
nearly tantamount to support for the state,
the enforcer of apartheid.
10. Even the relatively progressive
practices of some American companies in
South Africa may actually have the effect of
extending apartheid by making it more
tolerable. These practices are commen
dable, but the greater good is the ending of
apartheid as soon as possible.
There is a strong moral case for
withdrawal
1. A consensus is developing, both inter
nationally and within the United States, that
apartheid is so antithetical and inimical to
fundamental human values that it should
not in any way be condoned, let alone sup
ported. Many public and private organiza
tioas are attempting to express this univer
sal moral conviction by disassociating them
selves from all connections with apartheid,
however indirect, that might lend it support
in any way. They argue that if one is a partic
ipant in a continuing situation where
morally abhorrent behavior is occurring,
and one has exhausted all efforts to
ameliorate or positively reform the situa
tion and has failed, the only honorable al
ternative left is to decide no longer to par
ticipate in the situation. This argument is
now being made by an increasing number
of American companies doing business in
South Africa as they divest themselves of
their South African operations.
2. The South African situation is unique
because the system of apartheid involves a
singularly abhorrent systematic violation of
human rights. [ 4 ] Foreign companies

doing business there are forced into pro
viding substantial support for apartheid,
whether they recognize and condone this
or not. [ 6 ] Therefore, South Africa must be
regarded as an exception to the general
rule of business as usual for American cor
porations with foreign operations.
3. When one is an unintentional con
tributor (net negative impact) to substantial
social injury, it is appropriate to provide any
reasonable redress that is requested by the
injured party. Most leaders of the blacks
(the injured party) are requesting American
corporate divestment. [ 5 ]
4. Blacks (the vast majority of the people
of South Africa) are denied any part in the
participatory or democratic process of their
country. Those who have a voice are
morally bound to speak for the oppressed
who have no voice. We at Stanford have a
voice through our investments; the com
panies we invest in who do business in
South Africa have a voice as well. It is in
cumbent upon us to use our voice to
denounce apartheid as an unreformable
evil by announcing our intention to disas
sociate ourselves from South Africa until
apartheid is dismantled.
5. Inconsistency between public
pronouncements and private practice in
evitably leads to a loss of both integrity and
credibility. To denounce South Africa's
apartheid policies publicly while continu
ing privately to profit from doing business
within the framework of apartheid in South
Africa is inconsistent and hypocritical.
Withdrawal sends a powerful message
1. The withdrawal of American-compan
ies from South Africa as a statement (in
part) of their opposition to aparthied con
veys a powerful symbolic message — a
message of support for the oppressed
blacks of South Africa and a message of con
demnation of the government which con
tinues to enforce apartheid. Even the lim
ited withdrawal recently announced by
General Motors and IBM (withdrawing
their capital while continuing to sell thier
products and services there through licens
ing and distribution agreements) has been
described by knowledgeable observers as
having "unquestioned symbolic impor
tance" and being "mind-boggling in its im
plications." [ 11 ] History teaches us that
powerful messages have powerful impacts.
2. Apartheid is one of the great moral
abominations of this century. It is essen
