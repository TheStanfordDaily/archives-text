The Dec. 19 racial attack in Howard Beach, N.Y., that
resulted in the death of a black man has come as an un
settling shock to most of us.
We would like to believe that we have come a long
way since the lynch mobs and Jim Crow laws of the pre
civil rights era. We like to believe that racism, if it still
exists, survives only in small pockets here and there.
After all, we and our friends aren't racist.
But the tragic truth is that racism, in all its ugliness and
violence, still exists throughout America.
Much of the rhetoric surrounding the Howard Beach
attack portrays it as a horrendous, but relatively isolated,
incident. This simply is not the case. It is merely one of
many racist actions and reflects the extreme end of a
continuum of racist attitudes.
Just five years ago, a black transit worker was beaten to
death in Brooklyn by white youths. Three years ago, a
charge that a black minister had been harassed by two
white police officers prompted a congressional hearing
on police brutality in Harlem. The rancorous hearing
ended in chaos.
Similar stories are repeated elsewhere. Racism, long a

strong undercurrent in Chicago, has figured heavily in
the city's politics ever since Harold Washington was
elected mayor. Recent news reports of racially motivated
incidents on college campuses and the black-against
white brawl over the World Series are just the publicized
incidents. Like the proverbial iceberg, what you see is
not all there is.
It is true that racial discrimination is no longer legal,
schools are desegregated, and affirmative action pro
grams offer minorities a chance to do what they couldn't
do before. Racism, by and large, has been legislated out
of America. Making a law, however, is far easier than en
forcing it, and racism has yet to leave the American soul.
It is virtually impossible to legislate attitudes, and an
ingrained belief in white superiority and black inferiority
does not disappear in one or two generations.
As long as someone holds racist feelings, there is the
potential for racism to take form in laws or erupt in vio
lence.
The tragedy of Howard Beach serves as a reminder
that we have a long way to go before Martin Luther King
Jr.'s dream of racial equality and harmony is realized.
