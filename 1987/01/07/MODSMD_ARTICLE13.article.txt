Sbultz' return
raises questions
In a recent letter (Daily, Dec. 3),
Profs. Michael Weinrich, William
Hofmann and Jeffery Kocsis pointed
out die contradiction between Stan
ford's requirement that incoming
students be of good moral character
and the University's position on di
vestment. An even greater contradic
tion will arise when Secretary of State
George Shultz returns to his endowed
professorship at Stanford.
Shultz reportedly knew of the U.S.
arms sales to Iran from the beginning,
yet he not only kept silent but contin
ued to tell our allies that the United

States opposed selling arms to terror
ist states. Last October, when the
Reagan administration was caught in a
deliberate attempt to mislead the
press about Libya, State Department
Press Secretary Bernard Kalb resigned
in protest, but Shultz defended this
disinformation tactic as a means of
getting at Libya's Col. Khadafi. Shultz
repeatedly condemns terrorism, yet
he wholeheartedly supports U.S.-
backed rebels who torture and mur
der civilians in Nicaragua and Angola.
After the news broke that profits
from the Iran arms sales had been
diverted to the contras, it was clear
that President Reagan either must
have known about the transaction or
is hopelessly unware of what his
subordinates are doing. Following the
revelations, Reagan issued a series of
contradictory statements — ranging

from denials to blaming Israel and the
press — that made a mockery of truth.
Yet Shultz rushed to his defense. "I
think the president has been giving
magnificent leadership," he said. "I
am proud to be a part of the presi
dent's efforts."
The statement is revealing. Sultz has
no direct hand in diverting funds to
the contras, but he fervently supports
policies that made such an illegal act
almost inevitable. Shultz shares
Reagan's view of the world as an arena
for East-West struggle in which gov
ernments that resist U.S. domination
must be crushed. Like other ad
minstration zealots, he regards the
people of Africa, Asia and Central
America as no more than expendable
surrogates in a continuing cold war
with the Soviet Union. Shultz will
undoubtedly return to Stanford as an

honored elder statesman. But rather
than offer him uncritical admiration, a
university community that requires
high moral standards of its students
should look closely at the policies and
methods Shultz has advocated, and
give thought to the human suffering
they have caused.
