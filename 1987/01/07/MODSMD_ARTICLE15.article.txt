# Honesty, enthusiasm and teaching
## 
### 
I teach history at Menlo-Atherton
High School every other week for 50
minutes. I have discovered through
this and other teacher-student relation
ships in which I have been involved
that teaching at any level is tremen
dously challenging. Excellent teaching
requires intellectual, physical and
emotional freshness, an ability to ac
knowledge when one is not fresh, and
a capacity to seek and accept support.

If a teacher is unable to remain vital,
his teaching and the student both suf
fer. Conversely, the positive interac
tions of teaching are heightened when
the teacher is able to be honest about
his needs, receive support for them,
and thus avoid the possibility of a pupil
blaming himself for the teacher's bad
mood. Each teaching situation involves
a different emphasis on the emotional,
intellectual and physical elements of
instruction. I am not attempting to pos
tulate a formulaic approach to teach
ing; rather, I am addressing the effort
and honesty that are necessary for high
quality instruction.
Two years ago I volunteered at Bel
lehaven Child Development Center in
East Menlo Park with 3- to 5-year-olds.
The primary focus of the center is to
help the children develop social skills.
The kids stay at the center while their
parents are at work during the day and
participate in various activities. I
worked there eight to 10 hours a week.
The intellectual aspect of my work at
Bellehaven was less overtly mind
oriented than my studies here. This is
not to say that it did not require
thought to remember to kneel down
and make eye contact with the children
rather than towering over them, to try
to ask them rather than order them to
do things, and to remember to have
them try to answer their own questions
instead of immediately furnishing the
answer. Rather, I found it more physi
cally and emotionally draining than in
tellectually taxing to keep up with,
relate to and attempt to teach 28 kids

with two or three other adults.
When I had not slept much or was
going through a hard time emotion
ally, I tended to be less patient with the
kids, to snap at them more, to dismiss
the child who drooled all over me as a
pain, and to simply play with the
children who were my favorites. I
would be able to tell when I was acting
out my feeling of being overwhelmed
both by listening to how I sounded and
by watching the kids' reaction to me. A
child would not understand why a fail
ure to put his cot away would elicit a
sharp word on my part rather than a
request to please do it (which was how
I ususally responded).
At these times I had to learn to be
honest, to recognize that I needed
help, tell the other teachers, make ap
propriate adjustments and thus avoid
the children blaming themselves for
the negative feedback they might
receive, which would stem largely
from my own mood.
This not only helped me when I felt
down, but allowed me, when I was
well rested and emotionally clean, to
experience particularly rewarding in
teractions with the kids because I had
previously been honest about my own
needs. The positive dynamics, such as
when a child would wash her hands
and show me proudly, or would share
the toys where before he would take
them all to himself, were made pos
sible by the kids, by my recognition
that I felt overwhelmed, and by my ac
tions in dealing with my emotions.
This spring I worked full time as a
teacher's aide at my old elementary
school in Brookline, Mass. I worked
with kindergarteners through sixth
graders in the classroom and was a
recess monitor for the whole school
(K-8). The work was exhausting. I had
trained for a marathon for two months
before working there, and still I had to
go home and take a nap every day after
school. I read many sixth-grade
stories. My task in evaluating the
stories was to make comments that
would be appropriate for the students
and would help the children both im
prove their stories and emerge with a
more positive feeling about writing
creatively than when they started. This
skill of constructive criticism and en
couragement is different from reading,
analyzing and critiquing an article
about the Middle East, a type of activity
in which one often engages here at
Stanford.

Sixth-grade stories, while often in
teresting and exciting, can also be hard
to wade through. My comments on
stories were more severe when I was
tired, when I had already read many
stories that day, or when I was emo
tionally occupied. At this point 1 found
myself in a similar position as when I
would feel unable to cope at Bel
lehaven. The same combination of
stepping outside myself and owning
my feelings, combined with the look of
distress on the sixth grader's face,
allowed me to recognize my inability
to deal with the situation at hand.
I would have to tell the child that it
was not good for either of us for me to
read the story at that point. I would ask
the teacher for help, go on to some
thing else, and would then later return
to the 15th paper with the same fresh
ness that 1 brought to the first one. In
this way I felt that I had options and
had avoided turning away a sixth
grader from attempting to write
creatively in the future. The classroom
aspect at Pierce, the school in
Brookline, combined emotional and
intellectual factors.
The recess field was a different story;
it drained me physically and emotion
ally. Each day for two hours I would
run, settle fights, play soccer and gen
erally try to keep an eye on approxi
mately 100 kids at a time. Before 1
started recess I had heard about how
difficult the eighth graders were to
deal with. I went to recess, saw gawky
13-year-olds with high voices who
were unsure of themselves, and won
dered what the big deal was.
When I got into the same argument
for the 22nd time with the eighth
graders about going in to class, 1 un
derstood exactly how many teachers
could turn them off, label the students
obnoxious punks, and give up on
them. I too did this several times. As in
the classroom and at Bellehaven, I was
more prone to this attitude when I felt
overloaded in any way. I was able to
recognize what was going on both by
stepping outside myself and by watch
ing kids' reactions to my behavior.
I had to identify my distress, to seek
support from other recess aides, and to
continue to deal with eighth graders
for whom they were (insecure 13-year
olds) rather than as what I labeled
them (brats whose only goal was to an
tagonize me). By the end of the year
the eighth graders and I got along.
They went into class without a hassle,

and we felt a mutual bond grounded in
respect. I have since seen former
eighth graders at the high school and
we enjoy each other in a way that prob
ably would not have been possible had
I not been open with the other recess
aides and the kids about my needs.
Compared with Pierce and Bel
lehaven, my work at Menlo-Atherton is
much less intense. The kids are in an
Advanced Placement class, I go once
every two weeks, and 1 have no dis
cipline problems. We discuss chapters
in Richard Hofstadter's "The American
Political Tradition." While the experi
ence is less involved, the same
dynamics that existed during my previ
ous experiences occur here. Although
it is tempting to simply lecture, to give
the kids the answers, and to ignore the
students who do not talk, it is ulti
mately unhelpful for the pupils and
does not involve high quality teaching
on my part.
Thus I attempt to bring out kids who
do not participate and try to show, not
tell, the students both the information
and the manner in which Hofstadter
develops his argument. Though the
setting is different from my other expe
riences and the stress is more on the
intellectual dimension, I draw on my
previous knowledge of what is appro
priate and use the same skills I ac
quired at Bellehaven and refined at
Pierce.
I have not taught at a university, but I
have attended one as a student.
Though in a much more strictly intel
lectual form, the same challenge of
remaining enthusiastic, arid receiving
support when one is not, applies to
professors here as it does to kindergar
ten, sixth-grade and high school teach
ers all over the world. While this uni
versity setting differs greatly from a
day-care center in East Menlo Park and
pedagogy increasingly stresses
"intellectual'' over emotional and
physical growth as one progresses
through academia, the stakes for the
teacher and the student remain the
same. A second grader is as likely to
blame himself when his teacher is not
nice without explanation as a college
student is prone to turn off a subject
when a teacher has taught too long and
conveys no enthusiasm for the ma
terial.
