# Soviets superior in Europe
## 
### 
In two recent viewpoints (Daily, Nov. 4 and 21), Hugh Gusterson has expressed
his beliefs on the immorality of nuclear weapons. 1 do not wish to argue this
point. I do, however, want to set the record straight on several inaccuracies in
Gusterson's second viewpont.
In this column Gusterson states that the Soviets do not have an overwhelming
superiority in conventional forces over NATO, and thus nuclear weapons are not
needed to deter a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. He bases this assertion on
the fact that NATO has 240,000 anti-tank missiles to defeat 18,000 Warsaw Pact
tanks. He goes on further to assert that "many of the Warsaw Pact tanks are very
old and unreliable." These assertions clearly show that Gusterson is uninformed
about Soviet weapons and the realities of modern warfare.

KURT WEBBER

First of all, Gusterson is absolutely wrong when he states that "you do not fight
tanks with tanks — you fight tanks with anti-tank missiles." Professional soldiers
know without a doubt that the best anti-tank weapon is another tank. Anti-tank
guided missiles (ATGMs) are not as effective as tanks for several reasons. First,
both ground- and vehicle-mounted ATGMs are highly vulnerable to artillery fire
and the Soviets have an absolute, overwhelming superiority to NATO in this area
(over 12 to 1). Soviet doctrine calls for extremely heavy artillery bombardments
during an attack to suppress ATGMs. With their heavy armor, tanks would be al
most unaffected by this artillery fire. Secondly, tanks fire high velocity "Sabot"
kinetic energy rounds that will defeat any armor while ATGMs use chemical en
ergy' (shaped charge) rounds that will not necessarily defeat the "Chobham" type
armor on the new Soviet tanks (T-64s and T-80s). Finally, there are several other
limitations —- such as minimum arming distance, blast signature and long flight
time — that make ATGMs less effective than tanks. ATGMs can be effective when
used in conjunction with tanks and other weapon systems; however, Gusterson's
assertion that NATO's superiority in ATGMs is sufficient to counteract the Soviets'
superiority in tanks is incorrect.
Gusterson is also in error when he states that "many of the Warsaw Pact tanks
are old and unreliable." The first echelon Soviet forces that will face NATO — the
15 divisions of the Group Soviet Force Germany and the five divisions of the
Central Army Group in Czechoslovakia — are equipped with the latest equip
ment, T-64 and 5-80 tanks and the BMP 1981 infantry fighting vehicle. Many of the
follow-on forces from the Northern Army Group in Poland and from the Western
Military District of the Soviet Union are similarly equipped. Those Soviet and
Warsaw Pact units not so equipped still have the T-62 tank, which may be old but
is proven in battle and very reliable.
Finally, Gusterson has failed to mention the Soviet's overwhelming superiority
in chemical warfare. The Soviets are very well-trained and prepared to conduct
chemical warefare while NATO is woefully unprepared. Soviet doctrine calls for
the use of chemical weapons in the attack, and it is estimated that more than 25
percent of their artillery rounds and aerial bombs have chemical warheads. (One
only has to look at Southeast Asia and Afghanistan to see that the Soviets are not
averse to using chemical weapons.) At this time, NATO does not have a credible
offensive chemical warfare capability to deter Soviet use of chemical weapons.
Thus it is NATO's nuclear weapons that provide this deterrent.
Statistics can be misleading, and the conclusions that Gusterson derives from
the statistics he quotes are incorrect, particularly when considered against the
above facts of which he is either unaware or which he chooses to ignore. Those
who are knowledgeable about the situation know without a doubt the Warsaw
Pact has overwhelming conventional superiority over NATO and represents a
threat to Western Europe. Those who are familiar with history realize that there is
another threat to Western Europe posed by well-intentioned but unrealistic indi
viduals like Gusterson, who — like Neville Chamberlain in 1936 — would
weaken NATO to such an extent that a bloody war would become inevitable.

First of all, Gusterson is absolutely wrong when he states that "you do not fight
tanks with tanks — you fight tanks with anti-tank missiles." Professional soldiers
know without a doubt that the best anti-tank weapon is another tank. Anti-tank
guided missiles (ATGMs) are not as effective as tanks for several reasons. First,
both ground- and vehicle-mounted ATGMs are highly vulnerable to artillery fire
and the Soviets have an absolute, overwhelming superiority to NATO in this area
(over 12 to 1). Soviet doctrine calls for extremely heavy artillery bombardments
during an attack to suppress ATGMs. With their heavy armor, tanks would be al
most unaffected by this artillery fire. Secondly, tanks fire high velocity "Sabot"
kinetic energy rounds that will defeat any armor while ATGMs use chemical en
ergy' (shaped charge) rounds that will not necessarily defeat the "Chobham" type
armor on the new Soviet tanks (T-64s and T-80s). Finally, there are several other
limitations —- such as minimum arming distance, blast signature and long flight
time — that make ATGMs less effective than tanks. ATGMs can be effective when
used in conjunction with tanks and other weapon systems; however, Gusterson's
assertion that NATO's superiority in ATGMs is sufficient to counteract the Soviets'
superiority in tanks is incorrect.
Gusterson is also in error when he states that "many of the Warsaw Pact tanks
are old and unreliable." The first echelon Soviet forces that will face NATO — the
15 divisions of the Group Soviet Force Germany and the five divisions of the
Central Army Group in Czechoslovakia — are equipped with the latest equip
ment, T-64 and 5-80 tanks and the BMP 1981 infantry fighting vehicle. Many of the
follow-on forces from the Northern Army Group in Poland and from the Western
Military District of the Soviet Union are similarly equipped. Those Soviet and
Warsaw Pact units not so equipped still have the T-62 tank, which may be old but
is proven in battle and very reliable.
Finally, Gusterson has failed to mention the Soviet's overwhelming superiority
in chemical warfare. The Soviets are very well-trained and prepared to conduct
chemical warefare while NATO is woefully unprepared. Soviet doctrine calls for
the use of chemical weapons in the attack, and it is estimated that more than 25
percent of their artillery rounds and aerial bombs have chemical warheads. (One
only has to look at Southeast Asia and Afghanistan to see that the Soviets are not
averse to using chemical weapons.) At this time, NATO does not have a credible
offensive chemical warfare capability to deter Soviet use of chemical weapons.
Thus it is NATO's nuclear weapons that provide this deterrent.
Statistics can be misleading, and the conclusions that Gusterson derives from
the statistics he quotes are incorrect, particularly when considered against the
above facts of which he is either unaware or which he chooses to ignore. Those
who are knowledgeable about the situation know without a doubt the Warsaw
Pact has overwhelming conventional superiority over NATO and represents a
threat to Western Europe. Those who are familiar with history realize that there is
another threat to Western Europe posed by well-intentioned but unrealistic indi
viduals like Gusterson, who — like Neville Chamberlain in 1936 — would
weaken NATO to such an extent that a bloody war would become inevitable.
