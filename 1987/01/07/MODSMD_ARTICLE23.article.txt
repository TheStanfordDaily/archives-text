Dear Bug Me,
Whatever happened to Shaun Cassidy? There
used to he a picture of him clipped out of
Dynamite Magazine on every sixth-grade
female's locker. Is he doing Shakespeare off
Broadway? Is he singing on the Iran-Iraq front?
Any chance that the Concert Network might bring
Shaun to Stanford, perhaps starting a "comeback
tour"?
— The Hardy Boys
Strange as it may seem, you're not that far off
base.
Hack in 1978, Time Magazine dubbed Shaun
the "squeaky-clean teen dream."
He has since been replaced in those teen fan
magazines by the likes of Sean Penn, Matthew
Hroderick and Ralph Macchio (who are all several
years older than Shaun when he was at peak form
at the age of 19).
1 lave the tastes of adolescent females changed
to include older men? This I don't know.
What 1 do know is that Shaun's career took him
to Broadway after his glorious tenure on the tele
vision series "The Hardy Boys."
The agency that is handling Shaun's film ap
pearances gave me the run-down on him and it
includes extensive work in the theater.
Shaun appeared on Broadway in "Mass Ap
peal," "Barefoot in the Park" at the Aspen
Playwriters Conference and"The Subject Was
Roses," for which he won the Connecticut Critics
Circle Award.
Besides "Hardy Boys," Shaun's television
credits include the series based on the movie
"Breaking Away" and an upcoming episode of
"Murder, She Wrote" that will be aired on Feb. 8.
Mark your calendar now.
Aficionados of Shaun's career will be pleased
to know that he is working on a new album, as
well as a film with MGM. Quite struck by this ap
parent windfall in Shaun's career, I asked for the
specifics of these projects. The representative of
Shaun's agency, however, said that Shaun did not
wish to reveal that information at this time and
that I could not identify by name anyone at the
agency.
Does that sound a little like "Mission
Impossible"?
I immediately phoned MGM and spoke with
publicist Rob Pennington. He said that, as far as

he knew, Shaun was not cast in any feature films
scheduled for production in the very near future.
Shaun's agency said that he has no current
plans to go on tour.
"He's emphasizing on motion pictures," the
agency representative said.
Shaun is married and has a son and a daughter.
Dear Bug Me,
/ have seen in comic strips that characters who
are exposed to radiation sometimes glow in the
dark. Is it possible for somebody to absorb enough
radiation to glow in the dark?
— Adam Bomb
I hate to dash your career hopes as a potential
nightlight, but you just won't glow.
"Radiation can fluoresce material with certain
kinds of properties," said Senior Health Physicist
John Holmes of the University's Department of
Risk Management. But unless you are painted
with something fluorescent you won't glow in the
dark.
You see, radiation is not intrinsically fluores
cent. Perhaps if you live near a nuclear reactor

you have seen a blue light originating from the
facility. Holmes said that this is Cerenkov radia
tion, which is caused by electrons momentarily
moving faster than the speed of light for the
medium they are in.
Radiology Prof. Kendric Smith agreed that ir
radiated individuals will not glow. Smith likened
the phenomenon to that of a go-go dancer danc
ing under a fluorescent light. Turn off the light
and the dancer doesn't glow. For a person to
glow there would have to be a constant source of
radiation and something in the body present to
absorb the radiation and fluoresce.
Unless, as Holmes suggested, you "dip your
head in a nuclear reactor," this won't occur.
Dear Bug Me,
Is it true that there are few brick buildings at
Stanford (and California in general) because
they are not earthquake-resistant? Is there some
reason why most of the new buildings on campus
are of concrete construction?
— Fallon Stone
"No buildings are earthquake-proof," said Ge

ology Prof. Jim Gere, "but there are degrees of
resistance."
Under California's Uniform Building Code,
brick buildings in the state must have steel rein
forcements to make them safe. Generally, these
reinforcements consist of steel bars that run
through buildings of brick and concrete construc
tion. Since we are in earthquake zone 4, which
has the state's highest incidence of earthquakes,
all new construction in this area must conform to
the highest standards.
At Stanford, all buildings — brick and concrete
— are steel-reinforced. Those brick structures
that survived the horrible 1906 quake were sub
sequently reinforced. In the case of the History
Corner, the building was taken down and the
sandstone blocks were attached to a metal frame.
With respect to newer campus construction,
the tendency is to build reinforced concrete
buildings. Gere said that when the big one comes
the newer buildings will not fall down, but they
will sustain damage.
"We can't make a building completely
earthquake prtxjf or you wouldn't want to live in
it.... It would be like a bank vault," Gere said.
I don't know about you, but I can think of
worse places than a bank vault to be in when we
set a new Richter record.
Dear Bug Me,
Why do 7-Eleven stores (or any other similar
type store) hat e locks on the front doors if they are
open for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year?
— Convenience Store Bandit
This is a frequently asked question to the Bug
Me column, but as a public service to discourage
criminals, I include it this week.
I spoke with Rigo Bolanos, the area sales
manager for the Southland Corporation, who had
a straightforward answer. Locks are on the doors
in case there is an emergency at one of the stores.
Bolanos said that occasionally there is a power
outage, a storm, or someone drives their car into
the side of one of Southland's 7-Eleven stores.
The store must then be closed as it can't be
operated and, of course, they don't want anyone
to steal any Slurpees while it is closed.
Bolanos said that "without exception" 7-Eleven
stores have locks on the doors.
Send me those questions you're been thinking
of before you have to cram for midterms. Mail
them to The Daily or send them by electronic mail
on Othello to "BUG—ME."

Strange as it may seem, you're not that far off
base.
Hack in 1978, Time Magazine dubbed Shaun
the "squeaky-clean teen dream."
He has since been replaced in those teen fan
magazines by the likes of Sean Penn, Matthew
Hroderick and Ralph Macchio (who are all several
years older than Shaun when he was at peak form
at the age of 19).
1 lave the tastes of adolescent females changed
to include older men? This I don't know.
What 1 do know is that Shaun's career took him
to Broadway after his glorious tenure on the tele
vision series "The Hardy Boys."
The agency that is handling Shaun's film ap
pearances gave me the run-down on him and it
includes extensive work in the theater.
Shaun appeared on Broadway in "Mass Ap
peal," "Barefoot in the Park" at the Aspen
Playwriters Conference and"The Subject Was
Roses," for which he won the Connecticut Critics
Circle Award.
Besides "Hardy Boys," Shaun's television
credits include the series based on the movie
"Breaking Away" and an upcoming episode of
"Murder, She Wrote" that will be aired on Feb. 8.
Mark your calendar now.
Aficionados of Shaun's career will be pleased
to know that he is working on a new album, as
well as a film with MGM. Quite struck by this ap
parent windfall in Shaun's career, I asked for the
specifics of these projects. The representative of
Shaun's agency, however, said that Shaun did not
wish to reveal that information at this time and
that I could not identify by name anyone at the
agency.
Does that sound a little like "Mission
Impossible"?
I immediately phoned MGM and spoke with
publicist Rob Pennington. He said that, as far as

he knew, Shaun was not cast in any feature films
scheduled for production in the very near future.
Shaun's agency said that he has no current
plans to go on tour.
"He's emphasizing on motion pictures," the
agency representative said.
Shaun is married and has a son and a daughter.
Dear Bug Me,
/ have seen in comic strips that characters who
are exposed to radiation sometimes glow in the
dark. Is it possible for somebody to absorb enough
radiation to glow in the dark?
— Adam Bomb
I hate to dash your career hopes as a potential
nightlight, but you just won't glow.
"Radiation can fluoresce material with certain
kinds of properties," said Senior Health Physicist
John Holmes of the University's Department of
Risk Management. But unless you are painted
with something fluorescent you won't glow in the
dark.
You see, radiation is not intrinsically fluores
cent. Perhaps if you live near a nuclear reactor

you have seen a blue light originating from the
facility. Holmes said that this is Cerenkov radia
tion, which is caused by electrons momentarily
moving faster than the speed of light for the
medium they are in.
Radiology Prof. Kendric Smith agreed that ir
radiated individuals will not glow. Smith likened
the phenomenon to that of a go-go dancer danc
ing under a fluorescent light. Turn off the light
and the dancer doesn't glow. For a person to
glow there would have to be a constant source of
radiation and something in the body present to
absorb the radiation and fluoresce.
Unless, as Holmes suggested, you "dip your
head in a nuclear reactor," this won't occur.
Dear Bug Me,
Is it true that there are few brick buildings at
Stanford (and California in general) because
they are not earthquake-resistant? Is there some
reason why most of the new buildings on campus
are of concrete construction?
— Fallon Stone
"No buildings are earthquake-proof," said Ge

ology Prof. Jim Gere, "but there are degrees of
resistance."
Under California's Uniform Building Code,
brick buildings in the state must have steel rein
forcements to make them safe. Generally, these
reinforcements consist of steel bars that run
through buildings of brick and concrete construc
tion. Since we are in earthquake zone 4, which
has the state's highest incidence of earthquakes,
all new construction in this area must conform to
the highest standards.
At Stanford, all buildings — brick and concrete
— are steel-reinforced. Those brick structures
that survived the horrible 1906 quake were sub
sequently reinforced. In the case of the History
Corner, the building was taken down and the
sandstone blocks were attached to a metal frame.
With respect to newer campus construction,
the tendency is to build reinforced concrete
buildings. Gere said that when the big one comes
the newer buildings will not fall down, but they
will sustain damage.
"We can't make a building completely
earthquake prtxjf or you wouldn't want to live in
it.... It would be like a bank vault," Gere said.
I don't know about you, but I can think of
worse places than a bank vault to be in when we
set a new Richter record.
Dear Bug Me,
Why do 7-Eleven stores (or any other similar
type store) hat e locks on the front doors if they are
open for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year?
— Convenience Store Bandit
This is a frequently asked question to the Bug
Me column, but as a public service to discourage
criminals, I include it this week.
I spoke with Rigo Bolanos, the area sales
manager for the Southland Corporation, who had
a straightforward answer. Locks are on the doors
in case there is an emergency at one of the stores.
Bolanos said that occasionally there is a power
outage, a storm, or someone drives their car into
the side of one of Southland's 7-Eleven stores.
The store must then be closed as it can't be
operated and, of course, they don't want anyone
to steal any Slurpees while it is closed.
Bolanos said that "without exception" 7-Eleven
stores have locks on the doors.
Send me those questions you're been thinking
of before you have to cram for midterms. Mail
them to The Daily or send them by electronic mail
on Othello to "BUG—ME."
