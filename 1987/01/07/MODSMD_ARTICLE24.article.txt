### 
Employers will be hiring
about an equal number of col
lege graduates this year as in
1986, according to a survey of
230 business and industrial com
panies nationwide conducted by
Victor R. Lindquist, director of
placement at Northwestern Uni
versity.
According to The Chronicle of
Higher Education, the report's
major findings also include the
following:
• The average starting salaries
for graduates with bachelor's
and master's degrees will be up
2.1 percent.
• Engineers still earn the highest
average salary among graduates
with bachelor's degrees —
128,932 a year.
• The demand for graduates
with bachelor's degrees in engi
neering is down for the second
straight year — except in chemi
cal engineering, where it is up
17 percent.
• Undergraduates who majored
in chemistry will receive the
largest salary increase — a 6 per
cent jump over last year's to an
annual level of $27,048.
• Job offers have dropped 12
percent, but acceptances have
increased 25 percent.
• Drug tests are now the sixth
leading "qualifier" used in
screening job candidates, be
hind verification of education,
verification of past employment,
physical examinations, personal
references and faculty refer
ences. One-third of the respon
dents now test for drugs, with
another 19 percent expecting to
start in the next 12 months.
