## Xmas films: Murphy, Ford and Audrey II Wild and weird 'Little Shop' 
### CHIP CATALANO 
"Little Shop of Horrors" is definitely a Saturday night,
good-time movie. From beginning to end this comedy
musical never lets up on the fun. It's filled with great charac
ters, good music, and ... well, the best on-screen perfor
mance by a vegetable that I've ever seen.
Director Frank Oz (the man behind Miss Piggy) describes
the movie best as "basically the simple story of a boy, a girl
and a man-eating plant." It's based on an off-Broadway stage
musical that in turn was inspired by a cheap 1960 film made
in only two days and a night. Nevertheless, the 1986 film ver
sion is anything but cheap. Oz has put together a well-done
and classy production.
Rick Moranis plays the boy of the story, Seymour Krel
born, who works in a flower shop on Skid Row and is
secretly in love with a blonde salesgirl named Audrey (Ellen
Green). The only trouble is that Audrey has a boyfriend, a
sadistic biker whom she doesn't have the guts to leave. Steve

Martin is hilarious as the biker who represents the only ob
stacle to Seymour's love for Audrey. That is, until Seymour
comes across the plant of his dreams, or so it seems.
Not since Yoda in"The Empire Strikes Back" have movies
had such a green and appealing character. Few screen per
sonalities seen today, except for maybe Eddie Murphy, have
the wit and brashness of this vegetable. Seymour names the
plant Audrey II and cares for it in his basement bedroom by
feeding it blood. Where the blood comes from is Seymour's
problem. No problem, right?
Moranis as Seymour is impossible to dislike. An added
suprise is the fact that Moranis can sing and unexpectedly
contributes a great deal to the music in the film.
As advertised, John Candy, Jim Belushi and Bill Murray ap
pear in the film during brief cameos. Although Candy and
Belushi contribute nothing noticeable, Murray is funny just
to look at, and his short scene is the most hilarious in the
film. If you're looking for a fun and mindless movie, "Litle
Shop of Horrors" is a good $5 bet.
