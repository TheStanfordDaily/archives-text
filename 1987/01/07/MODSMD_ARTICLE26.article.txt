# 'Coast'-ing along with Harrison Ford
## 
### CHIP CATALANO 
After seeing "The Mosquito Coast,'' I
was left with the suspicious feeling that
the $5 I used for a ticket would have
been better spent buying a copy of the
Paul Theroux novel on which the
movie is based.
The movie, despite a script based on
a critically acclaimed novel, complete
with exotic settings and a complex
main character, simply isn't very in
volving. This is especially surprising
since Harrison Ford is on-screen
through most of the movie, trying to
keep us interested. (Ford has starred in
five of the top 10 money-making
movies of all time, the "Star Wars" tril
ogy- and the two Indian" Jones movies.
He is an extremely likeable actor; just
think of him in "Witness' or "Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom" )

Ford plays Allie Fox, an idealistic
family man disillusioned with modern
day America. No longer able to bear
watching an America overcome by
mediocrity, the threat of nuclear war,
foreign products and religious
fanaticism, Fox uproots his family and
takes them on a permanent vacation to
the jungles of Central America. In an
area known as the Mosquito Coast, Fox
plans on starting from scratch to build
his own visionary civilization, a private
Utopia.
Ford is very convincing as Allie Fox.
Even Fox's most outlandish behavior
seems credible, thanks to Ford's
portrayal of the character. Neverthe
less, Fox's idealism isn't enough to sus
tain an entire movie. Unfortunately,
"The Mosquito Coast" has little else to
offer. Fox's family of six exists only to
follow his orders and is involved in
very little dialogue. Fox's wife (Helen
Mirren) doesn't even have a name

other than the title "Mother."
We learn early in the movie that Fox
has said the reason he left Harvard was
to get an education. This is a promising
start. My immediate reaction was to
think, "Hey, I'm gonna like this guy."
But the movie remains limited in its
ability to explore Fox's head. Perhaps if
I had read the book, I would have ap
preciated "The Mosquito Coast" more.
This, however, begs the question: If
you need the book to enjoy the movie,
what's the movie for?
In recent interviews Harrison Ford
has declined to comment on how he
thinks the film turned out except to say
that it's faithful to the book. And Paul
Theroux himself has publicly ap
proved the movie, by no means the
usual thing for an author to do. Maybe
the movie is faithful to the book. Yeah,
and maybe I should go read it to see if
I liked the movie.
