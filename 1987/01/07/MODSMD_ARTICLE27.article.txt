# 'Golden Child' disappoints
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
When a celebrity as talented and
popular as Eddie Murphy comes to
the screen, all he has to do is be him
self and fans will come flocking to
see him. Sadly, the makers of "The
Golden Child" didn't have the sense
to let Eddie Murphy be himself. In
stead they squeezed him into the
character of Chandler Jerard, a role
that stifles Murphy's humor.
It's as if writer Dennis Feldman
and director Michael Ritchie made a
James Bond film and then suddenly
decided to put Eddie Murphy in the
lead role to get a few extra laughs. In
some ways, their idea worked. They
made a comic adventure movie, but
when I go to an Eddie Murphy
movie, I want to see Eddie Murphy,
not an adventurer who seeks a spe
cial dagger and fights a clay-model
devil. Why didn't they let this movie
evolve out of Murphy's comic
genius, which has led to his great
successes in the past? (After all, what
was "Beverly Hills Cop" but an ex
tension of his stand-up comedy act?)
Instead, they waste his talent in a
role that doesn't require him to be
very funny.
Murphy defies his bland character
and is often funny nonetheless, but
he could have been a lot better if he
weren't burdened with this movie's
hackneyed plot (yet another in the
"Raiders of the Lost Ark" mold).
Though miscast as an adventurer, he
does manage to be himself at points,
and these moments are truly great.
When he travels to the cold moun
tains of Tibet to see an honorary
monk, the monk nonchalantly wipes
his nose on his jacket. Murphy says
in reaction: "Beuer get that booger
off your jacket before it freeze up,
fall off and kill somebody."
Other times, Murphy's comic tal
ent is shackled by the plot and spe
cial effects. He isn't even in the first
10 minutes of the movie because the
cumbersome plot must unfold, and

during the last 10 minutes he's busy
rescuing the Golden Child and has
no time to be funny. An actor like Ar
nold Schwarzenegger who has noth
ing going for him but his brawn
needs a good plot complete with
plenty of special effects to make his
movies sell tickets, but Eddie
Murphy's comic flair is enough to
propel his movies. He doesn't need
to fight a cartoony skeletal devil with
a luminous dagger; just give him a
microphone and let him tell jokes â€”
that's the only magic his audiences
ask of him.

Why didn't they
just let this movie
evolve out of
Murphy's comic
genius, which has
led to his great
successes in the
past?

My frustration with "The Golden
Child" is that it typifies the genre of
movies that become so preoccupied
with selling a name (Clint Eastwood,
Paul Newman and Robert Redford
come to mind) that the very qualities
which make each "name" actor great
are ignored. Redford was terribly
miscast in "Out of Africa," to the
point where he looked like a bad ac
tor. He's not. Similarly, "The Golden
Child" takes Murphy completely out
of his element.
How can he be a funny, street
smart black wiseguy when half the
characters in the movie can't even
understand him and the woman who

does (Charlotte Lewis) has abso
lutely no sense of humor? I don't
know if it's to sell more tickets or just
plain had casting, hut this movie tries
to make Eddie white. For
tunately Murphy can't do it. His sassy
street-talk remains and still amuses.
For example, to a magic empress
who addresses him from behind a
curtain, Murphy says, "Honey, I wish
you'd stop hiding behind that curtain
and come out, because your sil
houette is kicking!'' To the Devil
(Charles Dance), he says, "Nice
jacket, sort of has a Morris Day-feel
to it, it's smokin." These scenes are
among the most memorable because
Murphy is so funny. The problem is
that the filmmakers don't trust
Murphy's talent enough, they don't
dare him to be original, and as a
result "The Golden Child" gives
Murphy's humor short shrift.
The movie.is filled with crowd
pleasing tricks that have nothing at
all to do with Murphy. At one point,
the Golden Child makes a Pepsi can
dance to the tune of "Puttin' On the
Ritz." It's not funny, it's not good
dancing, and worst of all it takes
even more screen time away from
Murphy. Later Charles Dance turns
into a skeleton with horns and big
ears that flies and attacks Murphy. It
looks like the same skeleton used in
the old "Sinbad the Sailor" movies.
Fantasy adventures amuse me. I
like "Raiders," "Star Wars" and
"Goldfinger," but "The Golden
Child" tries to be every one of these
and more, so much so that the plot
appears to be a greatest hits version
of blockbuster movies. The
crammed-in action almost excludes
Murphy from his own movie. We
don't see much of Murphy in this
picture, but what we do see is pure
comic genius. A bad Eddie Murphy
movie is like a bad Shakespeare play,
it's still good. Like any other genius,
Murphy may not always be great, but
he's never mediocre, even when he's
surrounded by mediocrity.
