# 'Crimes' stumbles on-screen
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
A proliferation of stage-plays-turned-to-movies has hit
the screen in recent years. A few that spring to mind are
A Soldier's Story," "Agnes of God," '"Night Mother" and
Children of a Lesser God." Some of these movies have
been good, worthwhile efforts, but most of them have
done nothing more than demonstrate that the transition
from stage to screen is a difficult one.
"Crimes of the Heart" is the latest entry into the stage
to-screen arena, and while there are occasional flashes of
comic brilliance from the combined superstar talents of
Diane Keaton, Jessica Lange and Sissy Spacek, "Crimes"
is unable to transcend the barriers of the inherent transi
tional problems that weigh down a play during its
metamorphosis into a movie.
Beth Henley wrote the screenplay adaption of "Crimes
of the Heart" from her 1981 Pulitzer prize-winning play.
It's a mystery to me how and why the play won the Pulit
zer, but, nevertheless, it's a black comedy about the ec
centric antics of three Southern sisters and their colorful
ways of handling life, death and men. The movie version
doesn't differ too much from the play, and it tells the
story of the three sisters — Lenny (Keaton), Meg (Lange)
and Babe (Spacek) — who reunite in their hometown
after the youngest sister, the ditzy Babe, shoots her hus
band because she "didn't like his looks." While Meg and
Lenny help their sister with her defense, we watch them

as they relive old memories, bicker and behave like
wacked-out goofballs.
The movie successfully manages to capture the flavor
of the stage play, but this isn't always a good thing. I saw a
stage production of "Crimes of the Heart" and what
made it so good was that the play's overdrawn characters
and eccentric chattiness make it ripe material for the
exaggerated conventions of the theater. Film is a differ
ent medium, and some of the things that are done on the
overexpressive, claustrophobic confines of the stage
aren't necessarily appropriate for the screen, which is si
multaneously more intimate and more expansive than
theater.
With the filmed production of "Crimes of the Heart,''
the result is a movie that should have remained a play.
Much of the broad, black humor that worked so well on
stage doesn't fare as well on the screen. Although direc
tor Bruce Beresford tries to make creative use of the
camera, he doesn't manage to expand the material
enough to break it out of its theatrical origins; it's not a
movie that can stand on its own.
The film's saving grace is the acting. Although I've
never seen three performances so self-consciously
geared for Oscar nominations, the trio of Keaton, Lange
and Spacek — particularly Spacek — works into a finely
crafted ensemble of irresistible nuttiness. The three
actresses never let you forget that they're just acting, but
they are engaging, funny and fascinating to watch.
