# Roth's new band a triumph
## 
### LIZ GOODMAN 
It goes without saying that David Lee
Roth is an outrageous personality â€”
spontaneous, full of seemingly limit
less energy, even witty. Like him or
loathe him, you have to admit that Roth
is a truly unique performer. He could
hold his own in concert even with a
bunch of monkeys as back-up
musicians.
But Roth knew exactly what he was
doing when he assembled his current
band, the one featured on his "Eat 'Em
and Smile" album. Roth brought to
gether musicians who could also stand
alone, without him, so when star and
band performed together Dec. 12 at

the Cow Palace, it was a first-class con
cert.
If any musician ever deserved more
attention and recognition, it was
guitarist Steve Vai. He's spent years
perfecting his craft, but up until now
has had only a very small cult following
who really appreciated his talent. Now
working with Roth, Vai has an opportu
nity to show an attentive world that he
really can play the guitar better with it
behind his head than most people can
with the instrument in front of them.
Equally talented is bassist Billy
Sheehan, who has rightfully been des
cribed by some critics as the
"premiere rock bass player." Instead of
Sheehan and Vai each playing the stan
dard solo during the concert, the audi
ence was treated to a sort of guitar duel
between the two outstanding
performers. Drummer Greg Bissonette
is also a high-quality musician, having
played with various jazz groups before
his entry into the David Lee Roth band.
The band performed some older

songs like "Panama," "Jump," "Ain't
Talking About Love" and "Ice Cream
Man," but most of the music was from
"Eat Em and Smile." During these
songs Roth and his bandmates seemed
to be truly enjoying themselves, and
the party atmosphere that Roth exudes
seemed to really transmit to the audi
ence.
Though the huge lights that spelled
out "David Lee Roth" at the end of the
concert may have been a bit excessive,
such extravagance wasn't at all out of
character for a Roth performance. On
his own, Roth had an opportunity to do
things his own way, and he pulled off a
much tighter presentation than anyone
expected.
Roth chose to avoid any petty refer
ences during his show his to his
former band, who, following Roth's ex
ample, shall remain nameless. You
may notice that no comparisons were
made in this article between the two.
In all honesty, there is no comparison.
