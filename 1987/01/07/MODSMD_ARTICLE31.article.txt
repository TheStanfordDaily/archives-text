## Muster decides to remain for last year Redshirt junior will not join professional ranks 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Stanford running back Brad Muster said yes
terday that he will return next year for his final
year of eligibility, ending speculation on
whether or not the fourth-year junior would
make himself eligible for this spring's National
Football League draft
A senior academically, Muster has completed
the requirements for an economics major and
could graduate with his class in June. Because
he redshirted as a freshman, Muster has only
used three years of eligibility and can return
next year for his fourth season. The NFL allows
a player to be drafted the spring his class
graduates.
"I have my friends here, and I don't think I'm
ready to leave this atmosphere," Muster said. "I
think the team's going to be good next year,
and I don't feel like leaving yet. I still have
everything ahead of me."
"I'm obviously thrilled to have him back for
another year," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"It's a real boon to our program."
Muster rushed for 1,123 yards this season in
12 games, including back-to-back efforts of 37
carries for 190 and 38 carries for 183 yards
against Washington State and UCLA He caught
65 passes for 618 yards. Muster led Stanford in
scoring with 96 points on 16 touchdowns, in
cluding three in the 27-21 Gator Bowl loss to
Clemson.
Muster was named the Offensive Player of
the Year in the Pacific 10 Conference and was
named first-team All-America by Eastman
Kodak, and he is now one of the leading candi

dates for the Heisman Trophy next season.
"You think he is, and I think he is," Elway
said, "but I don't think he thinks he is. All 1 can
say is, if he's not, I should go into the insurance
business or something."
"I'd say it played a minor role in my deci
sion," Muster said. "It's nice to get that kind of
attention, but I don't think personal awards in
fluenced me that much. Maybe subconsciously,
but the people around me are what's impor
tant."
Joe Wooley, a scout for the Philadelphia
Eagles who is at Stanford for Saturday's East-
West Shrine Game, said Muster is a blue-chip
player, but didn't know where he would have
been drafted this year had he turned profes
sional. "From the little I've seen of him, he's a
very fine prospect," Wooley said, "but we
haven't evaluated him at all because he's a
junior. I can't speculate at all on where he'd
g°;"
"I've heard from some reliable sources be
tween late first round and third round," Muster
said. "But Coach Elway said with a good year
next year it could be even higher. The money
would be better too."
Quarterback John Paye was believed to be a
first-round selection after his junior season, but
a shoulder injury that required surgery last
month likely dropped his value with NFL teams.
By returning next season, Muster runs the risk
of himself being injured, hurting or even end
ing his chances at a pro career.
"With the injury factor, you want to say, 'Take
the money now,'" Muster said. "But what it
comes down to is: Is the money that important?
I thought about it and I said no. Before I

decided, I heard some guys say I'd be dumb to
stay and not take the money, but the program's
getting a lot better under Coach Elway, and I
want to be a part of it."
Three members of the Cardinal offensive
line — center Andy Sinclair, guard Andy Papat

hanasiou and tackle John Zentner — will return
next year, and tackles Jeff Marchin and Robbie
Coffin, guard John Mahoney and rec|j>hirt fresh
man Mike Kohlmoos are expected to fill in ably.
Tight ends Eric Snelson and Jim Price will also
return.

Muster said he hadn't decided what to do
academically with an extra year. Graduating on
time and pursuing a master's degree is one pos
sibilty, he said, as is completing a second major.
"I'm definitely going to take advantage of the
opportunity," he said.

graduates.
"I have my friends here, and I don't think I'm
ready to leave this atmosphere," Muster said. "I
think the team's going to be good next year,
and I don't feel like leaving yet. I still have
everything ahead of me."
"I'm obviously thrilled to have him back for
another year," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"It's a real boon to our program."
Muster rushed for 1,123 yards this season in
12 games, including back-to-back efforts of 37
carries for 190 and 38 carries for 183 yards
against Washington State and UCLA He caught
65 passes for 618 yards. Muster led Stanford in
scoring with 96 points on 16 touchdowns, in
cluding three in the 27-21 Gator Bowl loss to
Clemson.
Muster was named the Offensive Player of
the Year in the Pacific 10 Conference and was
named first-team All-America by Eastman
Kodak, and he is now one of the leading candi

dates for the Heisman Trophy next season.
"You think he is, and I think he is," Elway
said, "but I don't think he thinks he is. All 1 can
say is, if he's not, I should go into the insurance
business or something."
"I'd say it played a minor role in my deci
sion," Muster said. "It's nice to get that kind of
attention, but I don't think personal awards in
fluenced me that much. Maybe subconsciously,
but the people around me are what's impor
tant."
Joe Wooley, a scout for the Philadelphia
Eagles who is at Stanford for Saturday's East-
West Shrine Game, said Muster is a blue-chip
player, but didn't know where he would have
been drafted this year had he turned profes
sional. "From the little I've seen of him, he's a
very fine prospect," Wooley said, "but we
haven't evaluated him at all because he's a
junior. I can't speculate at all on where he'd
g°;"
"I've heard from some reliable sources be
tween late first round and third round," Muster
said. "But Coach Elway said with a good year
next year it could be even higher. The money
would be better too."
Quarterback John Paye was believed to be a
first-round selection after his junior season, but
a shoulder injury that required surgery last
month likely dropped his value with NFL teams.
By returning next season, Muster runs the risk
of himself being injured, hurting or even end
ing his chances at a pro career.
"With the injury factor, you want to say, 'Take
the money now,'" Muster said. "But what it
comes down to is: Is the money that important?
I thought about it and I said no. Before I

decided, I heard some guys say I'd be dumb to
stay and not take the money, but the program's
getting a lot better under Coach Elway, and I
want to be a part of it."
Three members of the Cardinal offensive
line — center Andy Sinclair, guard Andy Papat

hanasiou and tackle John Zentner — will return
next year, and tackles Jeff Marchin and Robbie
Coffin, guard John Mahoney and rec|j>hirt fresh
man Mike Kohlmoos are expected to fill in ably.
Tight ends Eric Snelson and Jim Price will also
return.

Muster said he hadn't decided what to do
academically with an extra year. Graduating on
time and pursuing a master's degree is one pos
sibilty, he said, as is completing a second major.
"I'm definitely going to take advantage of the
opportunity," he said.
