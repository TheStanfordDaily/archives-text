# Stanford wins Rose Bowl... Rose Bowl Regatta, that is
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
While other Stanford students were finishing their vaca
tions this past weekend, four members of the Stanford
sailing team began the new quarter with an impressive vic
tory over 21 other schools at the Rose Bowl Regatta in Long
Beach.
The regatta, one of the West Coast's biggest, drew com
peting teams from as far away as the East and the Far East.
Several top-ranked schools traveled across the country to
sail in the Southern California event, while one team from
Japan came all the way across the Pacific.
By topping all entrants, the Stanford squad reaffirmed its
position as one of the top American sailing teams.
USC and UC-Irvine hosted the regatta, which took place in
light winds last Friday and Saturday. The races were held on
Alamitos Bay near Long Beach.
The Cardinal was represented by juniors Dan Buckstaff
and Kathleen Mallery, who sailed to victory in the A-
Division, and junior Drew Gashler and senior Kristen
Boyles, who captured the win in B-Division.
Most collegiate regattas are similarly split into two divi
sions to make the size of the fleet manageable. Each school's
score is the total of its A-Division and B-Division scores, so
each two-person team contributes to its school's success.

Together, the two Cardinal teams scored an overall vic
tory for Stanford, finishing 22 points ahead of second-place
Orange Coast College, and 47 points ahead of third-place
UC-Irvine. USC took fourth place, while the highly ranked
team from Navy could only manage a fifth-place finish. The
Japanese team, racing in an unfamiliar event, finished
eighth.
The Cardinal performance was marked by strong, coasis
tent races, according to Stanford Coach Blake Middleton.
Repeatedly, the two teams would start behind many boats,
working their way up to the top of the pack and solid
finishes, Middleton said.
"Neither team had any really big mistakes. Both of them
were very consistent, always finishing in the top three or
four. By being more consistent than their competition, our
teams piled up a very big lead," he said.
Team members were also pleased with their perfor
mance.
"It was a really good regatta. The conditions were right
for us, and once we got going we were sailing fast. After a
while, we just concentrated on beating OCC, and that
helped us build up our lead," Gashler said.

The A-Division team of Dan Buckstaff and Kathleen Mallery, both juniors, led Stanford to victory in the Rose Bowl
Regatta over break. The B-Division boat of junior Drew Gashler and senior Kristen Boyies also won their race in the
competition, which featured 22 schools.
and Cruising magazine. Because two of
those coaches were at the Rose Bowl
Regatta, the Stanford team hopes to
move higher in the upcoming
rankings.
"I was very impressed by our suc
cess, and I think the rankers were im
pressed too. We beat several strong
East Coast teams, including Navy and
Tufts, and that means a lot to people in
other collegiate sailing programs,"
Middleton said.
Middleton also emphasized the dra
matic scale of the latest Cardinal vic
tory.
"Most people don't realize that
sailing isn't one-on-one, like football.
When our two-man dinghy teams race
in big regattas like this one, they race
against all the other teams, in every
race. So winning a big event like the
Rose Bowl regatta is like having an un
defeated season in some other sports,"
Middleton said.
The sailing team's season continues
throughout this quarter and the next,
according to Middleton. At this point,
he thinks the team will do even better
in 1987 than it did in the 1986 season.
