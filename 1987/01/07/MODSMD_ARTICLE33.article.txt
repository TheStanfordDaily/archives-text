# Wrestlers meet Simon Fraser
## 
### 
Minus senior All-American Scott Wiggen and freshman
John Lisle, the Stanford men's wrestling squad has little
chance of defeating Simon Fraser in today's dual meet (2:30
p.m. at Maples Pavilion). The squad is already forfeiting
three out of 10 weight classes going into the meet because
of illness and injury.
But Stanford head coach Chris Horpel is still expecting
good individual performances from his wrestlers, despite
the absence of key team members. Junior Terry Mclntyre,
competing in the 190-pound division, is undefeated this
season with a record of 5-0, while senior Kurt Kassulke is 4-
1 in the heavyweight class.
The loss of Wiggen, who suffered a rib injury last Saturday
in Stanford's loss to Oregon State, is a big blow to the Card
inal, which will also miss the services of Lisle. Lisle, who
usually fills the 126-pound spot for Stanford, has been out
for the last week with strep throat and the flu.
Wiggen, in the 150-pound division, is expected to be back
in action against Humboldt State next week, but will miss
this weekend's Doc Peterson Open. Stanford Asst. Coach
Doug Perkins will take part in the tournament, which is
open to anyone. Perkins was an Ail-American for the Card
inal in 1983.

This season's wrestling team numbers only 13, the small
est squad Horpel has ever had. The team lost a large num
ber of wrestlers to graduation, and many of its members are
freshmen.
"We haven't been able to fill the smallest class (118-
pounds) this year," Horpel said. "The freshmen are doing
really well, but aren't competing consistently. Not only is it a
young team, it's also a small team. When we have injuries,
we have to forfeit weight classes."
Because the team lacks experience and depth, Horpel is
more concerned with individual outings. "The team perfor
mance is not great," he said, "but the individual perfor
mances are good. There's nothing I can do about the dual
meets."
Without Wiggen, Stanford (1-4) will be relying on
Mclntyre and Kassulke, who are first and third respectively
in team points. Mclntyre, who Horpel describes as a
surprise right now," has compiled 34 points this season.
Wiggen follows close behind with 32 and Kassulke has 22
and 1/2.
Still, having relinquished three of 10 weight divisions,
Stanford will be hard pressed today against Simon Fraser,
usually the Canadian national champion.

One of the few seniors on an unusually small Stanford wrestling squad, Dan Opalski will be competing for the Card
inal in the 142-pound weight division as Stanford takes on Simon Fraser University of Canada today. Stanford has a
1-1 record against Simon Fraser in past meets.
