SAN DIEGO (AP) — Despite contro
versy and cries by some athletes that
■ they were treated unfairly, the NCAA's
new drug-testing program is "a great
success," officials declared yesterday.
"We believe we have the most com
prehensive and effective testing pro
gram of any sports organization in the
United States today," Walter Byers,
NCAA executive director, said at a news
conference during the 81st annual
j NCAA convention. "Its objectives are
j very clear — to ensure clean champi
| onship competition and protect the
I health and welfare of the student-
I athlete."

Appearing with Byers were John
Toner of the University of Connecticut,
who heads the NCAA drug-testing com
mittee, and Dr. Don Catlin, head of the
UCLA laboratory and one of two ex
perts who conducted the tests that led
to 21 football players being disquali
fied from bowl games, most for
anabolic steroids use.
Urine tests have been done on 1,050
athletes since the program was
launched in November at the cross
country championships and only about
3 percent have tested positive, Toner
said.
Most of the 21 disqualified football

players tested positive for anabolic
steroids, a bulk-building substance that
has been linked to cancer, sterility and
anti-social behavior. Several disquali
fied players, including Oklahoma
linebacker Brian Bosworth and
Louisiana State defensive end Roland
Barbay, said they had been given the
steroids by physicians for medicinal
purposes. NCAA officials said they
doubted very much that a physician
would prescribe anabolic steroids.
The disqualification of some players,
Byers said, "is a sad aspect of the pro
gram."
