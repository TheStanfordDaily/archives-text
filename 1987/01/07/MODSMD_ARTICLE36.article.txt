# Sports fan's New Year's resolutions
## 
### 
An impish, pint-size cherub threw open my
door, leapt upon my bed, brandished a large
pacifier and smothered me with a used diaper.
"I want promises, changes," shouted the New
Year neonatal newt, pressing its beak against my
face. I shuddered as the toddler undid its swad
dling clothes only to reveal a tattoo of Bob
Barker, promising the same if its demands were
not met. It's a cruel, driven baby.

Goaded by the vision of this epidermal
moastrosity, I stammered out my solemn vows. I
promised to exercise a few times during the quar
ter; I promised to study harder (too many tran
script consonants last quarter, more vowels
needed); I promised to be a better person — I
swore to watch all the Perry Como specials. For a
momemt, 1 was one with daisies, butterflies,
maize and Burl Ives.
With these tender and pithy parcels of

foresight, the baby New Year — very much
moved by my confessions — asked if there was
anything it could do for me.
I smiled and acknowledged that I could use
some sort of transition into a sports topic. "Yes,
yes indeed," offered the small babe, who chewed
on its pacifier contemplatively. "How about the
sports world? It could probably use some
change." 1 nodded slowly.
"May 1 help you form a list of suggestions?" I
asked, politely gesturing to the baby to tuck in its
umbilical cord "After all, you're only seven days
old," I added.
A firm handshake and Oreo break later, our
task was set. We started with the National Football
League. We both agreed that video replays should
only be a device for television analysts, not
referees. The change: Pay the officials more
money and make their occupation full-time in
stead of part-time. The baby New Year burped its
approval.
"How about the Jim McMahon and Mike Ditka
feud?" inquired the baby, who amassed a fair
share of sports knowledge in its brief earthly stay.
I concurred. There must be change here. After
brief deliberation, we decided that we are tired of
the whole scenario and Jim and Mike should fre

quent Farrells on a weekly basis to work out their
differences.
For the best interests of the Bay Area, we con
cluded that the San Francisco 49ers should just
stay home next year during the playoffs. The pain
was too excruciating. Just say no.
"On to the NBA!" wailed the pile of animated
blubber, who began to drool on my new Chuck
Taylor hightops. We started to get annoyed with
each other. But we had a mission, a quest to
banish Ralph Sampson to the CBA.
Constantly "misunderstood" by the media and
public, Sampson should perhaps find a new
league so that fans don't have to perpetually
wonder why a 7-foot-4 center with extraordinary
physical gifts suffers so miserably both on and off
the court.
It's also high time for Lariy Bird to do some
thing about his hair. A part to the side, a little
shampoo and — i<oila — people will forget that
he's from French Lick, Ind. Mark Gastineau, to
skip back to the NFL, could profit from a little
shearing as well.
I glanced up from the scroll of suggestions to
gaze at the petite troll. It had a pained look of dis
dain, a casual yet pouting expression. Instantly, I
knew I had forgotten Danny Ainge.
By all means, Ainge should plan for an im

promptu Mormon retreat. He's been fairly docile
thus far, but the playoffs grow near and, frankly, 1
fear overexposure.
But enough of the winter prime-time sports.
Sports like baseball, pro wrestling and tennis all
need a resolution or two.
Baseball should resolve simply to be more ex
citing, thank you. Bring back the Old Time antics
such as when Chicago general manager Bill
Veeck passed along the strategy to send a midget
up to plate, sharply reducing the strike zone.
Pete Ueberroth and company should legalize
the spitball, give Kansas City's Steve Balboni a
toupee during televised games and forcibly retire
Pete Rose.
Wrestling could do without the advertisements
of a seething, well-oiled Hulk Hogan, who could
pass for a muscular slip 'n' slide with an ego prob
lem — Freudian and otherwise.
In tennis, fans should be allowed to yell and
create general havoc during competition, a stellar
guarantee to weed out the weak of heart. Loud,
staccato cries of "Don't miss" and "Your shoes are
muddy" would throw the best off their mark.
With a small yawn, the stunted one got up and
started for the door. "Remember your words,"
the babe said rosily. I grimaced and waved. I hate
resolutions. Peace.

fear overexposure.
But enough of the winter prime-time sports.
Sports like baseball, pro wrestling and tennis all
need a resolution or two.
Baseball should resolve simply to be more ex
citing, thank you. Bring back the Old Time antics
such as when Chicago general manager Bill
Veeck passed along the strategy to send a midget
up to plate, sharply reducing the strike zone.
Pete Ueberroth and company should legalize
the spitball, give Kansas City's Steve Balboni a
toupee during televised games and forcibly retire
Pete Rose.
Wrestling could do without the advertisements
of a seething, well-oiled Hulk Hogan, who could
pass for a muscular slip 'n' slide with an ego prob
lem — Freudian and otherwise.
In tennis, fans should be allowed to yell and
create general havoc during competition, a stellar
guarantee to weed out the weak of heart. Loud,
staccato cries of "Don't miss" and "Your shoes are
muddy" would throw the best off their mark.
With a small yawn, the stunted one got up and
started for the door. "Remember your words,"
the babe said rosily. I grimaced and waved. I hate
resolutions. Peace.

An impish, pint-size cherub threw open my
door, leapt upon my bed, brandished a large
pacifier and smothered me with a used diaper.
"I want promises, changes," shouted the New
Year neonatal newt, pressing its beak against my
face. I shuddered as the toddler undid its swad
dling clothes only to reveal a tattoo of Bob
Barker, promising the same if its demands were
not met. It's a cruel, driven baby.

Goaded by the vision of this epidermal
moastrosity, I stammered out my solemn vows. I
promised to exercise a few times during the quar
ter; I promised to study harder (too many tran
script consonants last quarter, more vowels
needed); I promised to be a better person — I
swore to watch all the Perry Como specials. For a
momemt, 1 was one with daisies, butterflies,
maize and Burl Ives.
With these tender and pithy parcels of

foresight, the baby New Year — very much
moved by my confessions — asked if there was
anything it could do for me.
I smiled and acknowledged that I could use
some sort of transition into a sports topic. "Yes,
yes indeed," offered the small babe, who chewed
on its pacifier contemplatively. "How about the
sports world? It could probably use some
change." 1 nodded slowly.
"May 1 help you form a list of suggestions?" I
asked, politely gesturing to the baby to tuck in its
umbilical cord "After all, you're only seven days
old," I added.
A firm handshake and Oreo break later, our
task was set. We started with the National Football
League. We both agreed that video replays should
only be a device for television analysts, not
referees. The change: Pay the officials more
money and make their occupation full-time in
stead of part-time. The baby New Year burped its
approval.
"How about the Jim McMahon and Mike Ditka
feud?" inquired the baby, who amassed a fair
share of sports knowledge in its brief earthly stay.
I concurred. There must be change here. After
brief deliberation, we decided that we are tired of
the whole scenario and Jim and Mike should fre

quent Farrells on a weekly basis to work out their
differences.
For the best interests of the Bay Area, we con
cluded that the San Francisco 49ers should just
stay home next year during the playoffs. The pain
was too excruciating. Just say no.
"On to the NBA!" wailed the pile of animated
blubber, who began to drool on my new Chuck
Taylor hightops. We started to get annoyed with
each other. But we had a mission, a quest to
banish Ralph Sampson to the CBA.
Constantly "misunderstood" by the media and
public, Sampson should perhaps find a new
league so that fans don't have to perpetually
wonder why a 7-foot-4 center with extraordinary
physical gifts suffers so miserably both on and off
the court.
It's also high time for Lariy Bird to do some
thing about his hair. A part to the side, a little
shampoo and — i<oila — people will forget that
he's from French Lick, Ind. Mark Gastineau, to
skip back to the NFL, could profit from a little
shearing as well.
I glanced up from the scroll of suggestions to
gaze at the petite troll. It had a pained look of dis
dain, a casual yet pouting expression. Instantly, I
knew I had forgotten Danny Ainge.
By all means, Ainge should plan for an im

promptu Mormon retreat. He's been fairly docile
thus far, but the playoffs grow near and, frankly, 1
fear overexposure.
