# Bio-warfare almost a reality, scholar says

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
A four-pound bomb that dispersed deadly anthrax spores
— created by British scientists and produced in the United
States during World War II — made bacteriological warfare
a near reality, History Prof. Barton Bernstein said in an inter
view yesterday.
"Had the war gone on beyond August, to January or
February of 1946, the U.S. probably would have used some
form of biological warfare," Bernstein said. He said the
plant for the bomb's manufacture was probably in Vigo
County, Ind.
Lord Cherwell, Britain's chief science adviser, informed
Prime Minister Winston Churchill in a "most secret"
memorandum on Feb. 25, 1944, that "any animal breathing
in minute quantities of these N (anthrax) spores is ex
tremely likely to die suddenly but peacefully within a
week," according to a recent article Bernstein wrote regard
ing the Allies' plans.
It is most likely the spores are equally lethal to human
beings, Bernstein added. No prevention, treatment or cure

has yet been discovered, he stated in the article.
Bernstein estimated that 106 anthrax bombs could
destroy life in a one-square-mile area. The projectile drops
to the ground and splatters, scattering the spores.
< Bernstein's article is published in the January-February
issue of the "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists." He said the
article is an outgrowth of an initial broader investigation
into why gas warfare was not employed during World War II
and that he found "no scholarship on biological warfare."
In a telephone interview, Vigo County Historian Dorothy
Clark said: "Yes, we had a plant just south of Terre Haute
that was very secret.... People called it a 'poison plant.' "
Bernstein said he was unsure whether the workers in the
plants knew what they were manufacturing. Only a half
dozen to a few dozen top British officials and a few top U.S.
government and army officials knew of the plans, he said.
The main American plant was to produce 50,000 bombs
per month by late summer in 1944 and to have completed a
quarter-million bombs by the end of that year, he said.
"Another U.S. plant, due to start operating in late 1944,
also apparently in Indiana, was scheduled for about 625,000
bombs monthly, with part of that supply available to Britain

in early 1945," Bernstein wrote in his article.
Production of the anthrax bomb in Britain was strongly
discouraged because it would have been "dangerously vul
nerable to German bombing," he said. The British govern
ment first began investigating biological warfare in 1934 by
putting out "secret feelers to the Medical Research Council
about doing research on the problem."
Bernstein said that the research was not made public in
order to keep it secret from the Germans, but also because
Hitler "ironically" prohibited research in biological warfare.
Secrecy prevented any negative scrutiny, he said.
According to Bernstein, many of the British documents
are still classified and, as a result, much is still unknown.
The closest Churchill ever came to launching the anthrax
bombs was in mid-1944, according to Bernstein, but
"fortunately there were some production delays, and Chur
chill — then pushing strongly for gas warfare and intolerant
of moral constraints on Britain's conduct of the war — did
not have the option of using anthrax."
He said a bombing plan was being organized by the
British military against six German
cities: Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Aac
hen, Stuttgart and Wilhelmshafen. If
launched, it would have killed half the
population in these areas.
Churchill's reluctance to use the
anthrax bombs was due more to the
fear of German retaliation than to
moral scruples, Bernstein said.
"Had he possessed anthrax bombs
in 1944, there is no evidence that
moral concerns — as distinguished

from fears of German retaliation or of
U.S. opposition — would have
deterred him from using them, even
though initiating biological war, as
Churchill understood, would have
meant crossing a new moral threshold,
reaching even beyond the horrors of
poison gas and certainly beyond the
bombing of noncombatant," he stated.
By 1945, "any weapon was deemed
acceptable," Bernstein said.
But, by then, Germany was close to
surrendering and the bomb was no
longer necessary, he said.
Bernstein said a major question
raised by his discoveries is "the role of
morality and deterrence in the arms

race." He said it is interesting to spec
ulate whether the British would have
used the anthrax bomb had they
known the Germans did not have an
equivalent counterattack.
Bernstein also said he is investigat
ing whether any American scientist or
Western scientist refused to work on
biological weaponry research after
World War 11. He has only found one
scientist so far, he said.
Bernstein said he plans to write a
short book of approximately six chap
ters, beginning with World War II and
focusing on the A-bomb, radiological
warfare, gas, biological warfare and the
issue of radiation from the bomb itself.

order to keep it secret from the Germans, but also because
Hitler "ironically" prohibited research in biological warfare.
Secrecy prevented any negative scrutiny, he said.
According to Bernstein, many of the British documents
are still classified and, as a result, much is still unknown.
The closest Churchill ever came to launching the anthrax
bombs was in mid-1944, according to Bernstein, but
"fortunately there were some production delays, and Chur
chill — then pushing strongly for gas warfare and intolerant
of moral constraints on Britain's conduct of the war — did
not have the option of using anthrax."
He said a bombing plan was being organized by the
British military against six German
cities: Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Aac
hen, Stuttgart and Wilhelmshafen. If
launched, it would have killed half the
population in these areas.
Churchill's reluctance to use the
anthrax bombs was due more to the
fear of German retaliation than to
moral scruples, Bernstein said.
"Had he possessed anthrax bombs
in 1944, there is no evidence that
moral concerns — as distinguished

from fears of German retaliation or of
U.S. opposition — would have
deterred him from using them, even
though initiating biological war, as
Churchill understood, would have
meant crossing a new moral threshold,
reaching even beyond the horrors of
poison gas and certainly beyond the
bombing of noncombatant," he stated.
By 1945, "any weapon was deemed
acceptable," Bernstein said.
But, by then, Germany was close to
surrendering and the bomb was no
longer necessary, he said.
Bernstein said a major question
raised by his discoveries is "the role of
morality and deterrence in the arms

race." He said it is interesting to spec
ulate whether the British would have
used the anthrax bomb had they
known the Germans did not have an
equivalent counterattack.
Bernstein also said he is investigat
ing whether any American scientist or
Western scientist refused to work on
biological weaponry research after
World War 11. He has only found one
scientist so far, he said.
Bernstein said he plans to write a
short book of approximately six chap
ters, beginning with World War II and
focusing on the A-bomb, radiological
warfare, gas, biological warfare and the
issue of radiation from the bomb itself.
A four-pound bomb that dispersed deadly anthrax spores
— created by British scientists and produced in the United
States during World War II — made bacteriological warfare
a near reality, History Prof. Barton Bernstein said in an inter
view yesterday.
"Had the war gone on beyond August, to January or
February of 1946, the U.S. probably would have used some
form of biological warfare," Bernstein said. He said the
plant for the bomb's manufacture was probably in Vigo
County, Ind.
Lord Cherwell, Britain's chief science adviser, informed
Prime Minister Winston Churchill in a "most secret"
memorandum on Feb. 25, 1944, that "any animal breathing
in minute quantities of these N (anthrax) spores is ex
tremely likely to die suddenly but peacefully within a
week," according to a recent article Bernstein wrote regard
ing the Allies' plans.
It is most likely the spores are equally lethal to human
beings, Bernstein added. No prevention, treatment or cure

has yet been discovered, he stated in the article.
Bernstein estimated that 106 anthrax bombs could
destroy life in a one-square-mile area. The projectile drops
to the ground and splatters, scattering the spores.
< Bernstein's article is published in the January-February
issue of the "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists." He said the
article is an outgrowth of an initial broader investigation
into why gas warfare was not employed during World War II
and that he found "no scholarship on biological warfare."
In a telephone interview, Vigo County Historian Dorothy
Clark said: "Yes, we had a plant just south of Terre Haute
that was very secret.... People called it a 'poison plant.' "
Bernstein said he was unsure whether the workers in the
plants knew what they were manufacturing. Only a half
dozen to a few dozen top British officials and a few top U.S.
government and army officials knew of the plans, he said.
The main American plant was to produce 50,000 bombs
per month by late summer in 1944 and to have completed a
quarter-million bombs by the end of that year, he said.
"Another U.S. plant, due to start operating in late 1944,
also apparently in Indiana, was scheduled for about 625,000
bombs monthly, with part of that supply available to Britain

in early 1945," Bernstein wrote in his article.
Production of the anthrax bomb in Britain was strongly
discouraged because it would have been "dangerously vul
nerable to German bombing," he said. The British govern
ment first began investigating biological warfare in 1934 by
putting out "secret feelers to the Medical Research Council
about doing research on the problem."
