# Drell: Diplomacy holds key to safety
## 
### KRISTIN BARENDSEN Staff writer 
"The path to a safer world will be
paved not by a better laser or atomic
accelerator, but by diplomacy," Sidney
Drell,'co-director of the Stanford Cen
ter for International Security and Arms
Control, told a near-capacity crowd at
Terman Auditorium last night.
According to Drell, the short-term
solution to the arms control crisis is
"to make deterrence work, ...
(although) deterrence violates a
deeply ingrained human instinct to
defend ourselves against destruction."
Drell said: "Since the dawn of the
nuclear age every president, upon en
tering the White House, has looked for
something better than deterrence ...
only to face the reality that deterrence
cannot be avoided in a heavily armed
nuclear world." He added, however,
that deterrence is "morally repugnant"
and n<x acceptable as an end in itself.
In the long term, the United States
must completely abandon nuclear
weapons because "history shows that
we have used even,' weapon that we
have invented," he said.
According to Drell, the solution to
the nuclear problem is particularly dif
ficult to solve since it is unique to our
age, having no historical precedent.
Never before has man been faced with
the possible destruction of his world if
a country defends itself against its ad
versary. he said. "It's not man vs. na
ture but man vs. man."
Drell pointed out the difficulties of
developing an effective defense against
nuclear war Creating a perfect defense
system has been compared to putting a
man on the moon, he said. He added,
however, that "the problem is not
solely a technological challenge. The
ni(x>n didn't mind being landed on. It
couldn't run away or hide or develop
countermeasures to outwit us.

"We should be realistic in assessing
the enormously difficult challenge to
achieving an effective defensive system
in the face of enemy counter
measures," Drell said.
He added that "whatever we build,
(the Soviets) will get there." Drell cited
examples of current defense measures
that are easily foiled by better offensive
equipment.
Drell said that he sees no prospect
of achieving an effective defensive sys
tem unless the Soviet offensive threat
is constrained.
Deterrence can be accomplished
only through the cooperation of tech
nology and diplomacy, he said. The
problem is primarily a political chal
lenge to limit forces and to develop
technology capable of defeating these
limited forces, he stated.
According to Drell, the United States
and the Soviet Union should operate
within the strictest interpretations of
the Anti-Ballistic Missle (ABM) treaty
because it is the "one restraint for our
uncertain future" and "our only secur
ity." If the two superpowers stay solely
within the bounds of existing treaties,
then technology can be 100 |>ercent
perfect in these limitations and offense
and defense would be equalized, he
said.
Both superpowers, however, are
currently in violation of the radar bans
in the ABM treaty, according to Drell
He described the Soviet violation as
"blatant" and the United States' viola
tion as "more ambiguous."
Drell said: "It may sound trite, but
we have no alternative but to continue
to m.ike sensible treaty restraints with
patience, good faith and firmness The
government and citizens must step
back and remember the danger of a
nuclear war. There is no silver bullet."
Drell quoted Albert Einstein on the
destructive potential of the accelerated

atom: "The politics are much harder
than the physics."
In the question-and-answer period
following his speech, Drell said that
the problem with a defensive posture
toward arms is that it would trigger an
offensive arms race.
Responding to a question about No
vember's summit meeting between
President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, Drell quipped,
"Why didn't the two leaders take a
break and ask their experts for advice
when the argument became so in
volved? Probably they both know less
about arms control than anybody in
this r(X)m They have other things on

their minds."
When asked about the possible nu
clear threat a small nation might pose
if it aquired nuclear weapons, Drell
said that he couldn t think of a "less
likely way for a small nation to attack
the United States than bv building
ICBMs."
Drell's speech was the fifth in a se
ries of arms control lectures spon
sored by the Stanford Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control.
The next speaker, Prof. Arnold
Horelick of UCLA, is scheduled to ap
pear on Jan. 27 to present his lecture
entitled "Soviet perspective on Arms
Control."

is constrained.
Deterrence can be accomplished
only through the cooperation of tech
nology and diplomacy, he said. The
problem is primarily a political chal
lenge to limit forces and to develop
technology capable of defeating these
limited forces, he stated.
According to Drell, the United States
and the Soviet Union should operate
within the strictest interpretations of
the Anti-Ballistic Missle (ABM) treaty
because it is the "one restraint for our
uncertain future" and "our only secur
ity." If the two superpowers stay solely
within the bounds of existing treaties,
then technology can be 100 |>ercent
perfect in these limitations and offense
and defense would be equalized, he
said.
Both superpowers, however, are
currently in violation of the radar bans
in the ABM treaty, according to Drell
He described the Soviet violation as
"blatant" and the United States' viola
tion as "more ambiguous."
Drell said: "It may sound trite, but
we have no alternative but to continue
to m.ike sensible treaty restraints with
patience, good faith and firmness The
government and citizens must step
back and remember the danger of a
nuclear war. There is no silver bullet."
Drell quoted Albert Einstein on the
destructive potential of the accelerated

atom: "The politics are much harder
than the physics."
In the question-and-answer period
following his speech, Drell said that
the problem with a defensive posture
toward arms is that it would trigger an
offensive arms race.
Responding to a question about No
vember's summit meeting between
President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, Drell quipped,
"Why didn't the two leaders take a
break and ask their experts for advice
when the argument became so in
volved? Probably they both know less
about arms control than anybody in
this r(X)m They have other things on

their minds."
When asked about the possible nu
clear threat a small nation might pose
if it aquired nuclear weapons, Drell
said that he couldn t think of a "less
likely way for a small nation to attack
the United States than bv building
ICBMs."
Drell's speech was the fifth in a se
ries of arms control lectures spon
sored by the Stanford Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control.
The next speaker, Prof. Arnold
Horelick of UCLA, is scheduled to ap
pear on Jan. 27 to present his lecture
entitled "Soviet perspective on Arms
Control."

The United States needs to concentrate on diplomacy and not "a better laser
or atomic accelerator" in order to ensure a safer world, according to Sidney
Drell, co-director of the Stanford Center for International Security and
Arms Control. Speaking at Terman Auditorium last night, Drell also said
deterrence offers a short-run solution to the arms control crisis.
"The path to a safer world will be
paved not by a better laser or atomic
accelerator, but by diplomacy," Sidney
Drell,'co-director of the Stanford Cen
ter for International Security and Arms
Control, told a near-capacity crowd at
Terman Auditorium last night.
According to Drell, the short-term
solution to the arms control crisis is
"to make deterrence work, ...
(although) deterrence violates a
deeply ingrained human instinct to
defend ourselves against destruction."
Drell said: "Since the dawn of the
nuclear age every president, upon en
tering the White House, has looked for
something better than deterrence ...
only to face the reality that deterrence
cannot be avoided in a heavily armed
nuclear world." He added, however,
that deterrence is "morally repugnant"
and n<x acceptable as an end in itself.
In the long term, the United States
must completely abandon nuclear
weapons because "history shows that
we have used even,' weapon that we
have invented," he said.
According to Drell, the solution to
the nuclear problem is particularly dif
ficult to solve since it is unique to our
age, having no historical precedent.
Never before has man been faced with
the possible destruction of his world if
a country defends itself against its ad
versary. he said. "It's not man vs. na
ture but man vs. man."
Drell pointed out the difficulties of
developing an effective defense against
nuclear war Creating a perfect defense
system has been compared to putting a
man on the moon, he said. He added,
however, that "the problem is not
solely a technological challenge. The
ni(x>n didn't mind being landed on. It
couldn't run away or hide or develop
countermeasures to outwit us.

"We should be realistic in assessing
the enormously difficult challenge to
achieving an effective defensive system
in the face of enemy counter
measures," Drell said.
He added that "whatever we build,
(the Soviets) will get there." Drell cited
examples of current defense measures
that are easily foiled by better offensive
equipment.
Drell said that he sees no prospect
of achieving an effective defensive sys
tem unless the Soviet offensive threat
is constrained.
