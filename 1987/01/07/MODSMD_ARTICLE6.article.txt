# Foreigners set record high in enrollment

### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
The number of foreign students enrolled at Stanford
climbed to a record high of 2,187 this fall, according to sta
tistics released yesterday by Bechtel International Center.
The total is slightly higher than last year's of 2,154 and the
previous all-time high of 2,155 in 1983.
Overall, Stanford's foreign students come from 98
countries, while four students are not listed as affiliated with
any nation.
Marcia Makino, assistant director for foreign student
advising at Bechtel, said this year's slight increase is consis
tent with the past. "There hasn't been a very big fluctuation
in the number of foreign students in several years," she said.
But Makino noted that the increase in Asian students has
been a continuing trend. That group had the largest in
crease over last year, up from 884 to 960.
"More and more Asians are coming to Stanford and to
other universities in the U. 5.," she said.
While Canada sent the most foreign students to Stanford
(220, down from 224 last year), the next five largest contin
gents came from Asian countries.
The numbers of students from other regions dropped
from last year while some rose slightly.
Those areas with decreasing representation were the
Americas, down from 471 to 444; the Middle East and North
ern Africa, which dropped from 199 to 179; and Africa,
down from 60 to 45.
In addition to Asia, those regions that increased were
Europe, up from 482 to 497; and the Pacific Basin, which
rose from 52 to 57.
Economic as well as political factors have affected the
changes in regional representation, Makino said. "For exam
ple, when oil-producing countries had large dollar reve
nues during the '70s, a number of their students were com
ing here to study. But now that the foreign currency is not as
readily availiable, enrollment of students from the Middle
East and Mexico has decreased."
She added: "The (new anti-American) government in Iran
is no longer funding study in the U.S., and that has affected
our numbers too."
Makino attributed the increase in Asian enrollment to
several factors. "Economic growth in Asia and the rising
demand for high technology there is the main reason for
die increase in the number of Asian students coming to the
U. 5.," she said. "New programs in (the People's Republic of)
China encouraging study in the West has contributed as
well."
Engineering continued to be the most popular school for
foreign students at Stanford, with 877 enrolled there, up 36
from last year.
Enrollment in other schools
remained relatively stable, with 518 in
Humanities and Sciences, 149 in the
Graduate School of Business, 86 in
Education, 71 in Earth Sciences, 55 in
the School of Medicine and 17 in the
School of Law.
There were 155 undeclared students
and one in graduate special programs.
Twenty-four percent of the Univer
sity's graduate students are foreigners,
or 1,625 of 6,700.
The number of foreign undergradu
ites was 304 (4 6 nercent of the under

graduate population), while 214 were
postdoctoral students (38 percent).
There were 33 non-matriculated
foreign students and 11 were here with
attendence permits.
Women number 490, or 22.4 per
cent, of the foreigners enrolled here,
and 680, or 31 1 percent, of the foreign
students were married.
The countries ranking in the top 10
for number of students attending
classes here were Canada with 220; the
Republic of Korea, 158; Taiwan, 157;
Japan, 148; India, 147; the People's
Republic of China, 132; Great Britain,
112; Mexico, 77; Hong Kong, 72; and
the Federal Republic of Germany with
68.
