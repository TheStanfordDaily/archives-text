# Weeklong King events planned
## 
### KACEY FITZPATRICK 
Beginning Monday, a weeklong
series of events — including a stu
dent rally, films, lectures, an exhibit
and a memorial service on the Stan
ford campus — will he held as part
of the University's commemoration
of the birthday of Martin Luther
King Jr.
King's birthday is observed on
Jan. 19 as an official federal holiday.
No classes will be held that day.
The Black Student Union (BSU)
will hold its annual Martin Luther
King Jr. rally at noon that day in
White Plaza. The Rev. Jesse Jackson
is scheduled to speak at the event.
Following the rally, a memorial
service in Memorial Church will be
held featuring Acting Dean of the
Chapel Thomas Ambrogi, the Stan
ford Gospel Choir and possibly
Jackson. The service will take place
at 4 p.m.
According to BSU Chair Amanda
Kemp, the focus of the student rally
this year will be racism and educa
tion. "Rev. Jackson will address the
situation of the rise of racism on
elite campuses across the nation.
The deficiencies that exist here at
Stanford and at other elite institu
tions, in regards to color, is seen as
the unfinished business of the King
legacy," she said.
"Jesse Jackson was one of King's
closest advisers, and King was a
type of mentor to him, I think,"
Kemp said, adding that the appear
ance of Jackson is a major event.
The BSU is working on getting .in
honorarium of several thousand
dollars for Jackson. He has asked
for more than the amount paid to
either Nicholas Daniloff or Dr. Ruth

Westheimer, both of whom spoke
on campus in November. Daniloff
received $8,500, and Westheimer
was paid $7,500.
Among the other planned activi
ties will be a playing of
"Dimensions of a Life" — a non
stop audio presentation of King's
legendary sermons, as well as less
famous speeches such as those in
which he speaks out against the
Vietnam war.
According to Rachel Bagby, who
worked on the King Com
memorative Committee and has
heard the presentation, "It's pretty
powerful. I can listen for only about
an hour at a time.
Also available for viewing will be
many pictures, documents and arti
facts from the civil rights move
ment. Included in the display will
be photos from private collections
and the National Archives of
Congress, as well as parts of un
published works and early student
writings.
The exhibit was put together by
History Prof. Clay Carson, director
of the Matrin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project. The exhibit runs from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, Jan. 12-16 in the
Aspen Room of Tresidder Union.
David Garrow, a professor at City
College of New York, and June Jor
dan, director of the Poetry Center
and Creative Writing at State Uni
verstiy of New York-Stony Br<x)k,
will close the commemoration in a
program at 7 30 p.m. Jan. 20 in
Kresge Auditorium Garrow will ap
proach King historically, while Jor
dan will address the contemporary
movements that have grown out of
the King movement.
