Voting Rights Act strengthened
WASHINGTON — In an abrupt reversal of earlier statements, the Justice
Department issued new regulations yesterday that will strengthen the
Voting Rights Act, giving the government broader authority to reject local
election changes that lead to discriminatory voting results.
The regulations, which will go into effect Feb. 5, allow department civil
rights lawyers to reject proposed election changes simply on the basis of
discriminatory results, rather than having to prove that local officials in
tended to discriminate against blacks or other minorities.
Last August, Assistant Attorney General William Reynolds, who heads the
Civil Rights Division, said the department would no longer consider
whether election plans have discriminatory results in its decisions on
whether to approve thousands of such changes.
Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, nine states and sections of seven
others are required to obtain "pre-clearance" from the department before
making election changes including redistricting, residence requirements,
polling places and rules for runoff elections.
Reynolds' comments touched off a vigorous protest from civil-rights
groups and from a bipartisan group of influential legislators who charged
that his interpretation violated the intent of Congress, which voted by a
wide margin in 1982 to strengthen the act.
The 1982 amendments broadened the law's use of a "results test" by out
lawing election changes that have the practical effect of discriminating
against minorities by diluting their voting strength, even if no dis
criminatory intent can be shown.
In issuing the new regulations, the department acknowledged that it had
received comments expressing "apprehension" that Reynolds' plan would
lead to "weakened" enforcement.
It said critics "should be reassured that this is not the case. The Congress
in extending the Voting Rights Act in 1982 and the Supreme Court in its
decisions (on pre-clearance) ... have made it clear that (pre-clearance) is
the keystone of the Voting Rights Act and that vigorous enforcement of it
should continue."
Stiff prison term urged for spy
WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors, urging that Israeli spy Jonathan
Pollard be sentenced to a substantial prison term, depicted him yestery as a
money-driven operative addicted to the high life who did far more damage
to national security than previously disclosed.
In an unusually detailed sentencing memorandum filed in U.S. District
Court, U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova said that Pollard's refusal to
cooperate with authorities once he was detected in November 1985 en
abled three of his Israeli co conspirators to escape beyond the reach of U.S.
law enforcement.
Moreover, in supplying the Israelis with more than 1,000 classified docu
ments, the former civilian intelligence analyst for the Navy has exposed
sources of U.S. intelligence and analysts, making them vulnerable to addi
tional espionage attempts, DiGenova said.
Pollard, who pleaded guilty June 4 to conspiring to deliver national
defense information to a foreign government, faces maximum punishment
of life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
China hardens line on protests
PEKING — China's most authoritative newspaper yesterday toughened
its position on student unrest, blaming Unnamed Communist Party officials
- -for failing to fight the spread of Western ideas,
Diplomats said an editorial appearing in People's Daily, the leading
Communist Party newspaper, marked a shift by top leader Deng Xiaoping
and his colleagues closer to the tough line taken by party critics of the
recent student demonstrations.
The diplomats said Deng and his reformist allies in the party leadership
are likely to halt the free-wheeling discussion among academics and others
of new cultural, economic and political ideas, which the Communist Party
had encouraged this past spring.
At the same time, they said, Deng appears determined to push ahead
with the economic reforms he initiated that from time to time have come
under attack from people usually called "conservatives."
When student demonstrators first took to the streets four weeks ago to
call for freedom and democracy, the authorities seemed to take a con
ciliatory position. They have tried both conciliation and threats since then.
By speaking with more than one voice, government and party officials
seemed to indicate that they were divided. On Dec. 30, a senior education
official speaking at a press conference adopted a largely moderate line, de
scribing the student demonstrators as young and inexperienced.
People's Daily said that some people wanted to lead China toward
capitalism and "some of our comrades have turned a blind eye to all
this— Now it's time for them to wake up."
Few of the student protesters have talked about capitalism, but many
admire Western democratic ideas and have advocated freedom of the
press.
Many of the students also say the Chinese leaders are divided between
reformers, such as Deng, and conservatives, and they have said so in
posters pasted on campus bulletin boards.
People's Daily attempted to refute this idea by declaring that the more
than 200 members of the party's Central Committee, which includes the
country's leading officials, are united.
Yesterday's editorial could not have been published without clearance
by some of the highest among those leaders, including Deng, diplomats
said.
People's Daily said that the recent student demonstrations, "although
nothing terrifying ... are serious major events," adding that they are "the
inevitable outcome of the weakness of some comrades in fighting the
spread of bourgeois liberalization."
Air Force seeks B-1B corrections
WASHINGTON — The Air Force, struggling with major problems that of
ficials say have weakened the capability of its new B-1B strategic bomber, is
seeking more than $600 million to correct some of the plane's defects, ac
cording to Pentagon officials.
Air Force officials said they need $420 million to find and repair prob
lems with the plane's electronic-defense equipment, one of the key com
ponents of the bomber, which is intended to serve as a cornerstone of
President Reagan's program to upgrade the nation's nuclear forces.
In addition, the Air Force has asked for money to extend the aircraft's
testing program by almost four years in an effort to identify and correct a
series of problems that include flight control, terrain-following radar and
missile-launching systems, Pentagon budget officials said yesterday.
Reagan recovery on schedule
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's recovery from prostate surgery
Monday continued to go "very well" yesterday, as he got out of bed to meet
with his top advisers, spoke to reporters from his hospital window and
phoned the new leaders of Congress to offer his congratulations.
He also got gtxxl news thai final laboratory tests on nearly an ounce of
tissue removed from his enlarged prostate found no evidence of cancer.
Army Col. John Hutton, the president's physician, said in a statement yes
terday that Reagan is "recovering very well from surgery. He feels gcxxi
and has not complained of any pain His vital signs are all in the normal
range and are stable and strong. There is no evidence of post-operative in
fection. His physicians are impressed and extremely pleased by the presi
dent's resilience and condition."
Four small benign, or non-cancerous, colon growths were removed, but
Reagan faced one final hurdle yesterday. A CAT scan, or computerized X
ray study, to look for signs of cancer that might have spread from the
original colon tumor to other sites was scheduled for early yesterday even
ing, Hutton's statement said.

Air Force seeks B-1B corrections
WASHINGTON — The Air Force, struggling with major problems that of
ficials say have weakened the capability of its new B-1B strategic bomber, is
seeking more than $600 million to correct some of the plane's defects, ac
cording to Pentagon officials.
Air Force officials said they need $420 million to find and repair prob
lems with the plane's electronic-defense equipment, one of the key com
ponents of the bomber, which is intended to serve as a cornerstone of
President Reagan's program to upgrade the nation's nuclear forces.
In addition, the Air Force has asked for money to extend the aircraft's
testing program by almost four years in an effort to identify and correct a
series of problems that include flight control, terrain-following radar and
missile-launching systems, Pentagon budget officials said yesterday.
Reagan recovery on schedule
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's recovery from prostate surgery
Monday continued to go "very well" yesterday, as he got out of bed to meet
with his top advisers, spoke to reporters from his hospital window and
phoned the new leaders of Congress to offer his congratulations.
He also got gtxxl news thai final laboratory tests on nearly an ounce of
tissue removed from his enlarged prostate found no evidence of cancer.
Army Col. John Hutton, the president's physician, said in a statement yes
terday that Reagan is "recovering very well from surgery. He feels gcxxi
and has not complained of any pain His vital signs are all in the normal
range and are stable and strong. There is no evidence of post-operative in
fection. His physicians are impressed and extremely pleased by the presi
dent's resilience and condition."
Four small benign, or non-cancerous, colon growths were removed, but
Reagan faced one final hurdle yesterday. A CAT scan, or computerized X
ray study, to look for signs of cancer that might have spread from the
original colon tumor to other sites was scheduled for early yesterday even
ing, Hutton's statement said.

Voting Rights Act strengthened
WASHINGTON — In an abrupt reversal of earlier statements, the Justice
Department issued new regulations yesterday that will strengthen the
Voting Rights Act, giving the government broader authority to reject local
election changes that lead to discriminatory voting results.
The regulations, which will go into effect Feb. 5, allow department civil
rights lawyers to reject proposed election changes simply on the basis of
discriminatory results, rather than having to prove that local officials in
tended to discriminate against blacks or other minorities.
Last August, Assistant Attorney General William Reynolds, who heads the
Civil Rights Division, said the department would no longer consider
whether election plans have discriminatory results in its decisions on
whether to approve thousands of such changes.
Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, nine states and sections of seven
others are required to obtain "pre-clearance" from the department before
making election changes including redistricting, residence requirements,
polling places and rules for runoff elections.
Reynolds' comments touched off a vigorous protest from civil-rights
groups and from a bipartisan group of influential legislators who charged
that his interpretation violated the intent of Congress, which voted by a
wide margin in 1982 to strengthen the act.
The 1982 amendments broadened the law's use of a "results test" by out
lawing election changes that have the practical effect of discriminating
against minorities by diluting their voting strength, even if no dis
criminatory intent can be shown.
In issuing the new regulations, the department acknowledged that it had
received comments expressing "apprehension" that Reynolds' plan would
lead to "weakened" enforcement.
It said critics "should be reassured that this is not the case. The Congress
in extending the Voting Rights Act in 1982 and the Supreme Court in its
decisions (on pre-clearance) ... have made it clear that (pre-clearance) is
the keystone of the Voting Rights Act and that vigorous enforcement of it
should continue."
Stiff prison term urged for spy
WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors, urging that Israeli spy Jonathan
Pollard be sentenced to a substantial prison term, depicted him yestery as a
money-driven operative addicted to the high life who did far more damage
to national security than previously disclosed.
In an unusually detailed sentencing memorandum filed in U.S. District
Court, U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova said that Pollard's refusal to
cooperate with authorities once he was detected in November 1985 en
abled three of his Israeli co conspirators to escape beyond the reach of U.S.
law enforcement.
Moreover, in supplying the Israelis with more than 1,000 classified docu
ments, the former civilian intelligence analyst for the Navy has exposed
sources of U.S. intelligence and analysts, making them vulnerable to addi
tional espionage attempts, DiGenova said.
Pollard, who pleaded guilty June 4 to conspiring to deliver national
defense information to a foreign government, faces maximum punishment
of life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
China hardens line on protests
PEKING — China's most authoritative newspaper yesterday toughened
its position on student unrest, blaming Unnamed Communist Party officials
- -for failing to fight the spread of Western ideas,
Diplomats said an editorial appearing in People's Daily, the leading
Communist Party newspaper, marked a shift by top leader Deng Xiaoping
and his colleagues closer to the tough line taken by party critics of the
recent student demonstrations.
The diplomats said Deng and his reformist allies in the party leadership
are likely to halt the free-wheeling discussion among academics and others
of new cultural, economic and political ideas, which the Communist Party
had encouraged this past spring.
At the same time, they said, Deng appears determined to push ahead
with the economic reforms he initiated that from time to time have come
under attack from people usually called "conservatives."
When student demonstrators first took to the streets four weeks ago to
call for freedom and democracy, the authorities seemed to take a con
ciliatory position. They have tried both conciliation and threats since then.
By speaking with more than one voice, government and party officials
seemed to indicate that they were divided. On Dec. 30, a senior education
official speaking at a press conference adopted a largely moderate line, de
scribing the student demonstrators as young and inexperienced.
People's Daily said that some people wanted to lead China toward
capitalism and "some of our comrades have turned a blind eye to all
this— Now it's time for them to wake up."
Few of the student protesters have talked about capitalism, but many
admire Western democratic ideas and have advocated freedom of the
press.
Many of the students also say the Chinese leaders are divided between
reformers, such as Deng, and conservatives, and they have said so in
posters pasted on campus bulletin boards.
People's Daily attempted to refute this idea by declaring that the more
than 200 members of the party's Central Committee, which includes the
