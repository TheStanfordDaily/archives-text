# Train's alarms may have failed
## 
### 
A shrill whistle designed to alert train crews that
they have passed signals telling them to slow down
had been silenced with pieces of tape on the Conrail
locomotive that ran in front of an Amtrak passenger
train near Baltimore Sunday, killing 15 people,
sources close to the investigation said yesterday.
Federal investigators are also looking into whether
v a signal box inside the locomotive cab that is
supposed to display lights telling the crew whether
the track is clear was defective. A source cautioned
that no final determination had been made about the
cab signals despite widespread rumors among Con
rail officials and employees that the devices were not
operating. Rules say no locomotive may leave a ter

minal in the Northeast Corridor with a faulty cab sig
nal and that any failure en route must be reported to
the dispatcher immediately.
This means that two of the three separate safety
signal systems used by Conrail may have been out of
operation. The third safety mechanism — signal
lights above the track — were malfunctioning, ac
cording to the Conrail engineer. A fourth safety
feature — automatic speed control — is used on
Amtrak passenger trains but not Conrail freight
locomotives.
The whistle is perhaps the least important of the
four systems because it essentially duplicates the
function of the cab signal lights. Train crew members

sometimes silence or muffle the whistle to avoid the
annoyance, according to some engineers.
The Conrail engineer has told representatives of
the United Transportation Union that he did not tape
the whistle, union officials said. A Conrail spokesman
said the company would not comment on any aspect
of the crash investigation.
At least a dozen of the approximately 170 persons
injured in the wreck remained hospitalized yester
day, including one person reported to be in critical
condition at the University of Maryland Shock
Trauma Center.
