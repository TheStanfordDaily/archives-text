# Dems oust Aspin from chair
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — House Democrats, locked in a
fierce ideological struggle over the direction of their
party's defense policy, narrowly voted yesterday to
oust a leading moderate voice — Rep. Les Aspin of
Wisconsin — as chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
The dramatic and surprising 130-124 vote was a
major victory for liberals who complained that Aspin
had not stood strongly enough against President
Reagan's policies during his two years as chairman.
Ironically, many of those same liberals had been
Aspin's key supporters in his successful 1985 drive to
unseat chairman Melvin Price (D-Ill.), who was then
80 and considered too frail to provide vigorous lead
ership.
Aspin's initial defeat, however, does not necessar
ily portend a liberal takeover of the chairmanship.
While the crucial votes in the secret ballot apparently
came from liberals, it was conservative Rep. Marvin
Leath (D-Texas), who engineered the drive against
Aspin.
As Democrats take control of both houses of
Congress for the final two years of the Reagan
presidency, the vote highlights tension within the
Democratic party over defense issues.
Liberals see the next two years as their best chance

at curbing the president's military buildup of the last
six years and rearranging his spending priorities,
while conservatives hope to change what they fear
are perceptions that their party is weak on defense.
Aspin himself will have a chance to regain the
chairmanship later this month in what is shaping up
to be a four-way race for the job.
He conceded that many of the votes against him
may have reflected strong dissatisfaction with his
style of leading the committee. Many liberals had
complained that Aspin, whose own ascension to the
chairmanship had been a rare breach of the House
seniority system, had broken faith with them by
taking the committee too far in a conservative direc
tion. They were particularly bitter over the chair
man's support for the MX missile and the Nicaraguan
rebels, known as contras.
Aspin said yesterday's vote, a decision on whether
to retain Aspin that did not pit him against other can
didates, was "a good device to send a message. It was
sent and received. It's a message about dealing with
other members of the House."
However, even some of Aspin's supporters said the
vote may have been more than symbolic and sugges
ted that it may already be too late for him to rebound.
"When you know it's that close, it's too late to send

a signal," said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who told
reporters he had voted for Aspin."... If Aspin stays in
(the race), he pretty much guarantees Leath wins.
Other committee members who have said they
will definitely join the race are Rep. Charles Bennett
(D-Fla), the most senior member of the committee
after Price, and Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-Mass.),
who said he hopes to pick up votes from liberals and
moderates.
Aspin, who was a Pentagon analyst during the
Johnson administration, has a grasp of the intricacies
of the military establishment that few on Capitol Hill
can rival. However, many critics have complained
that he had not been bold enough in staking out a
Democratic alternative to Reagan's defense policies.
The turmoil among Democrats occurs at a time
when leaders of the newly Democratic Congress are
poised to battle Reagan on issues that range from
funding for his space-based strategic defense initia
tive, known as "Star Wars," to establishing new arms
control policies.
The Armed Services Committee, traditionally one
of the most conservative in Congress, is likely to fig
ure at the center of many of these crucial debates.
