PARIS — French warplanes attacked
Libyan air defense and radar installa
tions in northern Chad yesterday.
Soviet-made MiG fighter-bombers of
Col. Moammar Khadafi's air force
struck back hours later with a raid on
Chadian government forces.
The French Defense Ministry said
the French raid was in retaliation for a
weekend Libyan air attack on the
government-held southern half of the
divided African nation, a former
French colony.
A ministry statement gave no details
of the midday French raid on the im
portant desert base at Ouadi-Doum,
saying only that it had "neutralized"
the Libyan radar installations.
Chad's ambassador in Paris, Ahmed

Allam-Mi, said Libyan MiGs attacked a
government post in southern Chad
hours after the French operation. He
provided no information on damage to
the post.
Allam-Mi criticized the French raid
as "too timid" and asserted that the
Libyans could replace the destroyed
radar equipment "within a few hours."
French Defense Minister Andre
Giraud said in a television interview
that the Libyans struck the Chad gov
ernment post four hours after the
French raid, but he said the Libyan
strike "was probably prepared prior to
the French action."
Allam-Mi confirmed the Libyan at
tack on the government outpost at
Kouba Oulanga, 40 miles south of a
line held by French forces.

Giraud said the French attack was
designed to show Libya the "accuracy
and effectiveness" of the French super
sonic Jaguar fighter-bombers without
escalating the conflict into an all-out
war between France and Libya.
There have been suggestions in the
French press that Libya's weekend raid
on southern Chad was meant to test
France's willingness to directly engage
its forces in the fighting between
forces loyal to the Chadian govern
ment of President Hissene Habre on
one side and Libyan troops and their
Chadian rebel allies on the other.
Chad borders Libya, and Libya
claims a sector of northern Chad.
It was the second time in less than a
year that French forces attacked Ouadi-
Doum, 550 miles north of the Chadian

capital, N'Djamena. Washington es
timates that several thousand Libyan
troops are stationed in northern Chad
supported by a few Chadian rebel
tribesmen.
French Premier Jacques Chirac said
Tuesday the weekend Libyan air raid
"could not remain without a response
from France." He said, however, that
France "does not intend to develop a
campaign in northern Chad."
Government forces last week ap
peared to be making headway in taking
strategic Libyan-controlled points in
the northern half of the landlocked na
tion.
Defense Minister Giraud said the
war in Chad "must not take the form of
a conflict" between France and Libya.
