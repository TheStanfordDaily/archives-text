# Zeta Psi seeks to regain housing
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Members of the Zeta Psi fraternity, a group which
lost University recognition and housing privileges in
the fall of 1981, are meeting with Fraternal Affairs Ad
viser Joe Pisano to discuss moving back into their
former residence at 353 Campus Drive.
"We understand that it's a privilege, and we feel we
are deserving,' Zeta Psi President Casey McGannon
said. "Working with Joe and our alumni, we have a
good idea now where we're going."
McGannon and Pisano have been discussing a peti
tion to regain University housing priveleges. McGan
non said he hopes to set up a preliminary meeting
with the Undegraduate Housing and Advising Com

mittee as soon as members to that committee are ap
pointed.
At the preliminary meeting, the fraternity' plans to
submit a list of things we've done, which we feel
shows our commitment to the fraternal community,"
McGannon said A later meeting will be scheduled
"to show our progress and how we've met with our
obligations,' he said.
While members of the fraternity are eligible to
submit a petition to Residential Education this year,
Pisano said he is doubtful a petition submitted before
next January will be successful.
The Zeta Psi fraternity last petitioned for housing
priveleges in February, 1982, when the group
regained University recognition, according to
McGannon. But because the fraternity's judicial body

and executive council had been created only shortly
before the petition was submitted, the fraternity was
told to wait two years to allow time for observation,
McGannon said.
According to Pisano, an interim report from the
fraternity was not submitted when requested. Pisano
said he recommends that the fraternity submit its in
terim report this month and ask to petition for
housing next January.
The purpose of the current discusions is "just
talking about what it is they're going to have to do to
get their house back," Pisano said. "It isn't as if it's up
to me, but 1 can certainly anticipate the things that
will be looked for."
