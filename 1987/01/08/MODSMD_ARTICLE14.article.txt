# Stanford astronomer finds starry arches

### MICHAEL WOLFE 
Applied Physics Prof. Vahe Petrosian,
working with others, has discovered
three unexplained starry arches
around distant galxxies, which might
provide clues to some of today's
greatest cosmological problems,
"This is potentially a very important
discovery and could have significant
implications," Petrosian said yesterday.
"This find could give us information
about the evolution or origins of the
universe."
Petrosian, chairman of the
Astronomy Department, teamed up
with Roger Lynds, an astronomer from
the National Optical Astronomical Ob
servation Center, to conduct an un
related experiment and accidentally
found the strange arches. They are lo

cated in a large cluster of galaxies five
billion light-years from Earth, nearly
halfway to the edge of the known uni
verse.
The two astronomers were conduct
ing experiments concerning galaxy
surface brightness when they chanced
upon the arches. When analyzing
pictures taken with Kitt Peak's four
meter telescope, the two saw the
bright arches, located around the
brightest galaxies of the cluster.
However, the astronomers' efforts
wertj thwarted by unclear skies.
Petrosian said: "We're frustrated be
cause we have very insufficient data be
cause of the Arizona weather."
The galaxies involved are much
larger than our own Milky Way galaxy
and are receding from the Earth at ap
proximately 40 percent of the speed of

light. Unlike the Milky Way, they are el
liptically shaped.
According to Petrosian, the galaxies
involved are in the center of the
cluster, making it unlikely that the
arches are there by chance. It is un
known how they are associated with
the clusters.
Because the arches are approxi
mately five billion light years away and
therefore existed five billion years ago,
they could give indications about the
origins of the universe, said Petrosian.
The three arches differ from one an

other. One looks as if it is a part of a
perfect circle, another looks as if it is
beaded with galaxies.
Currently the composition of the
arches is a mystery and will remain a
mystery until more data can be collec
ted, Petrosian said.
Petrosian and Lynds plan to collect
further data using spectroscopy;
however, it could be another six
months before the two astronomers
can gain access to the Kitt Peak Obser
vatory again. They will also use a very
large array radio telescope to collect
the needed information.
According to Petrosian, bits of stellar
matter around galaxies have been ob
served before.
