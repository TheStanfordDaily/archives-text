## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Reagan's fiscal folly 
### 
While a 75-year-old President Reagan may not live to
see the effects of his unparalleled splurge of deficit
spending, it may prove to be even more damaging to his
legacy, and to the country, than the Iran-contra scandal
or other foreign policy fiascos.
The recently released budget is the first in U.S. history
to call for over $1 trillion in outlays, yet Reagan is
predicting a deficit of merely $107.8 billion — just under
the Gramm-Rudman target.
This deficit estimate is a combination of wishful think
ing, shortsightedness and political gamesmanship that is
unpardonable. The budget also continues Reagan's un
precedented peacetime military buildup while cutting
back on funds for students, food stamp recipients and
low-income pregnant mothers.
The spending plan is based on projected growth of 35
percent in the economy, although that is far ahead of last
year's increase and more than experts predict this year.
According to Lawton Chiles, chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, the deficit will actually be $27 billion
higher when realistic growth figures are used.

Reagan also plans to cut the deficit by selling federal
assets. These sales are symptomatic of the live-for-today
attitude that led to the burgeoning deficit in the first
place and will prove to be nothing more than a one-time
panacea.
The sales are necessary, though, because Reagan
refuses to raise taxes yet somehow believes he can in
crease revenues by $23 billion. This unrealistic hope
places the onus of responsibility on Congress to come
up with a more workable plan.
Reagan can then blame Congress when it either raises
taxes, increases the deficit or makes even deeper cuts.
Meanwhile, he has covered himself by claiming to have
met the Gramm-Rudman targets, although in reality he
has simply sent Congress an unreasonable budget.
In six years, Reagan has overspent more than the pre
vious 39 presidents combined. With the government
over $2 trillion in the red and service on the debt com
prising 14 percent of the budget, it was time for the pres
ident to lead the United States out of this fiscal morass.
Instead, Americans received more budgetary double talk
and obfuscation.
