Stanford must come to terms with the fact that it is defi
cient in creating a positive living and learning environment
for students of color, it was just 19 years ago, after the death
of Martin Luther King Jr., that the University reluctantly
began to admit Third World students, and it still doesn't
have a grasp of the culture, concerns and history of people
of color. Reflective of Stanford's ignorance and insensitivity
is the fact that the approval of the proposed alternative West
ern Culture class focusing on people of color is in doubt.

Colleges across the country are admitting that their insti
tutions get an 'F' when it comes to giving students of color
the kind of education for which they are paying large sums
of money.
A report on minority life and education at Brown Univer
sity in 1986 found that "racism is inherent in American soci
ety and therefore exists in the University community." The
members of the Visiting Committee which prepared the
report concluded that "universities appeared to accept their
social responsibility by inviting the presence of minority
students but not by embracing their experience. Diversity
was still measured by numbers and percentages rather than
by revising the map of the white majority's intellectual ter
rain."
Paul E. Gray, the president of MIT, wrote that a recent
report on his school "carries a clear and disturbing
message: that the environment for living and learning at MIT
poses special problems for black students." That study
pointed out that:
"Feelings of isolation, insecurity about the admissions se
lection process and the perception that non-minority stu
dents believed lower standards were used in the admission
of minority students were all described as major concerns.
Minority students expressed anxiety over the level of self
help required by the Institute as well as about their families'
ability to provide financial assistance. Many minority stu
dents reported that having to work often resulted in greater
pressure on them. The feeling that a less than supportive en
vironment exists was voiced strongly."
The above descriptions sound painfully similar to our
everyday reality at Stanford. We concur with MlT's Dean for
Student Affairs Shirley Mcßay in her assessment that the fin
dings for her school are typical of most predominantly
white schools in the United States. Confirming the reports'
findings is a recent article in The New York Times showing
that "experts in race relations say [recent racial incidents]
seem part of a growing pattern of bigotry and animosity
toward minority students at predominantly white schools."

Standing in opposition to this trend are America's people
of color, whose history has been one of struggle against rac
ism and oppression. It was Third World students who
fought recalcitrant administrations to change discriminatory
admissions policies and modify myopic curricula. At UC-
Berkeley and San Francisco State, the students had to go on
strike and shut down the universities for several months to
win their ethnic studies departments and the right to have a
say in the content and development of the curriculum.
The existence of Afro-American studies and the pitifully
small number of ethnic studies classes here can be directly
traced to the civil rights movement and the struggles of
black and other Third World students in the late '60s and
early '70s.
Carrying on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and our
student forebears, the Black Student Union and other stu
dents of color have consistently opposed the Western Cul
ture Program as the most blatant and egregious example of
institutional racism at Stanford. As the report on Brown Uni
versity said, institutional racism "is evident more by what is
neglected than by what is taught ... by what it elects to in
clude in the research it supports and the courses it offers, a
university implies something about what is worth knowing."
That is why we have struggled, particularly in the past two
years, to develop an alternative to the Western Culture Pro
gram that focuses on the experiences and history of people
of color and women in America. We think those things are
worth learning. In fact, they are essential to know if one is to
truly understand the country in which we live. The class is a
modest — very modest — first step in breaking down the
structural deficiencies of Stanford. Sadly, its approval is in
jeopardy. Members of the Faculty Senate are apparently un
convinced that the University has major shortcomings. "If it
ain't broke," said English Prof. William Chace, "don't fix it."
In the eyes of George Wallace, Ronald Reagan and others
who opposed the civil rights movement, the policies of
segregation were not broke. Fortunately, Martin Luther King
Jr. and other courageous and enlightened people saw that
the South (and indeed all of America) was in dire need of
repair. That repair job is uncompleted.
History has created conditions that are both ironic and
appropriate for resolving the fate of the alternative class.
The Faculty Senate will decide whether or not to approve
the class on King's birthday, Jan. 15. The class is in the tradi
tion of everything King fought for, and it is sponsored by the
editor of the Martin Luther King Jr. papers. The outcome of
the vote will reflect and reveal Stanford's perception of
reality, its awareness of its own shortcomings and its willing
ness to make things better. We will closely follow the
proceedings.

white schools in the United States. Confirming the reports'
findings is a recent article in The New York Times showing
that "experts in race relations say [recent racial incidents]
seem part of a growing pattern of bigotry and animosity
toward minority students at predominantly white schools."

Standing in opposition to this trend are America's people
of color, whose history has been one of struggle against rac
ism and oppression. It was Third World students who
fought recalcitrant administrations to change discriminatory
admissions policies and modify myopic curricula. At UC-
Berkeley and San Francisco State, the students had to go on
strike and shut down the universities for several months to
win their ethnic studies departments and the right to have a
say in the content and development of the curriculum.
The existence of Afro-American studies and the pitifully
small number of ethnic studies classes here can be directly
traced to the civil rights movement and the struggles of
black and other Third World students in the late '60s and
early '70s.
Carrying on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and our
student forebears, the Black Student Union and other stu
dents of color have consistently opposed the Western Cul
ture Program as the most blatant and egregious example of
institutional racism at Stanford. As the report on Brown Uni
versity said, institutional racism "is evident more by what is
neglected than by what is taught ... by what it elects to in
clude in the research it supports and the courses it offers, a
university implies something about what is worth knowing."
That is why we have struggled, particularly in the past two
years, to develop an alternative to the Western Culture Pro
gram that focuses on the experiences and history of people
of color and women in America. We think those things are
worth learning. In fact, they are essential to know if one is to
truly understand the country in which we live. The class is a
modest — very modest — first step in breaking down the
structural deficiencies of Stanford. Sadly, its approval is in
jeopardy. Members of the Faculty Senate are apparently un
convinced that the University has major shortcomings. "If it
ain't broke," said English Prof. William Chace, "don't fix it."
In the eyes of George Wallace, Ronald Reagan and others
who opposed the civil rights movement, the policies of
segregation were not broke. Fortunately, Martin Luther King
Jr. and other courageous and enlightened people saw that
the South (and indeed all of America) was in dire need of
repair. That repair job is uncompleted.
History has created conditions that are both ironic and
appropriate for resolving the fate of the alternative class.
The Faculty Senate will decide whether or not to approve
the class on King's birthday, Jan. 15. The class is in the tradi
tion of everything King fought for, and it is sponsored by the
editor of the Martin Luther King Jr. papers. The outcome of
the vote will reflect and reveal Stanford's perception of
reality, its awareness of its own shortcomings and its willing
ness to make things better. We will closely follow the
proceedings.

Stanford must come to terms with the fact that it is defi
cient in creating a positive living and learning environment
for students of color, it was just 19 years ago, after the death
of Martin Luther King Jr., that the University reluctantly
began to admit Third World students, and it still doesn't
have a grasp of the culture, concerns and history of people
of color. Reflective of Stanford's ignorance and insensitivity
is the fact that the approval of the proposed alternative West
ern Culture class focusing on people of color is in doubt.

Colleges across the country are admitting that their insti
tutions get an 'F' when it comes to giving students of color
the kind of education for which they are paying large sums
of money.
A report on minority life and education at Brown Univer
sity in 1986 found that "racism is inherent in American soci
ety and therefore exists in the University community." The
members of the Visiting Committee which prepared the
report concluded that "universities appeared to accept their
social responsibility by inviting the presence of minority
students but not by embracing their experience. Diversity
was still measured by numbers and percentages rather than
by revising the map of the white majority's intellectual ter
rain."
Paul E. Gray, the president of MIT, wrote that a recent
report on his school "carries a clear and disturbing
message: that the environment for living and learning at MIT
poses special problems for black students." That study
pointed out that:
"Feelings of isolation, insecurity about the admissions se
lection process and the perception that non-minority stu
dents believed lower standards were used in the admission
of minority students were all described as major concerns.
Minority students expressed anxiety over the level of self
help required by the Institute as well as about their families'
ability to provide financial assistance. Many minority stu
dents reported that having to work often resulted in greater
pressure on them. The feeling that a less than supportive en
vironment exists was voiced strongly."
The above descriptions sound painfully similar to our
everyday reality at Stanford. We concur with MlT's Dean for
Student Affairs Shirley Mcßay in her assessment that the fin
dings for her school are typical of most predominantly
white schools in the United States. Confirming the reports'
findings is a recent article in The New York Times showing
