# Hypocrisy in Nicaragua
## 
### 
What amazes me most about this Iran-contra fiasco that
keeps unfolding on the front pages is its scope. More than a
simple scandal, it's a showcase of Reagan administration
hypocrisies.
By playing fast and loose with the Constitution, Lt. Col.
North and company have displayed a striking contempt for
the law. They have violated numerous statutes, including a
congressional ban on aiding the contras that was in effect at
the time, and laws prohibiting arms sales to Iran.

In a broader sense, the White House has demonstrated
contempt for the basic principles of democracy. Congress
said no to contra aid — twice — and the American public
had the right to expect that its representatives' decision
would not be systematically subvened by Reagan's dis
gruntled advisers.
Considering all the benefits Reagan has reaped by invok
ing the ideals of democracy — it's hard to criticize a presi
dent who wins landslides, even if he is just an old movie ac
tor — we can only say of the current scandal that it couldn't
have happened to a nicer bunch of guys.
The Iran-contra affair highlights other hypocrisies as well.
Consider the light it sheds on all the Reagan bluster about
deploring state-sponsored terrorism. An administration that
sells weapons to a fanatical hostage-taking regime and then
uses the money to help a band of thugs brutalize Nicaraguan
civilians sounds more than a bit hypocritical when it decries
the evils of "state-sponsored terrorism."
If anything good can come from the present mess, it will
come from forcing us all to take a hard look at the appalling
cynicism of U.S. policy toward Nicaragua.
Last fall President Reagan finally succeeded in goading
Congress into approving a $100 million "humanitarian aid"
package for the contra forces in Central America. U.S. sup
port for the contras, however, dates back at least five years.
In that time we have trained them, supplied them, in
structed them and apologized for them.
The White House has been rather fickle when it comes to
justifying its policy in Central America. At first, Reagan said
we had to oppose the Sandinistas to keep them from run
ning guns to the rebels in El Salvador. When they stopped
doing that, the president said supporting the contras would
pressure the Sandinistas into signing a regional peace plan.
After Nicaragua signed a draft of the contradora treaty,
Reagan took refuge in the familiar folds of Cold War rheto
ric and said we had to help the contras because the Sandi
nistas were undemocratic totalitarians bent on carrying out
an international Soviet plot.
The fact remains, however, that the Sandinista govern
ment is the legitimate government of Nicaragua. It came to
power in 1979 with an overwhelming popular mandate by
overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza, and in 1984 the
Sandinistas won the freest election in the country's history.

Despite the disruptions of war, Nicaragua still affords more
civil liberties than do neighboring Guatemala and El Sal
vador, both U.S. allies.
The contra operation got its start around 1980 when
former Somoza national guardsmen took up arms in a coun
terrevolution. Since then the contras have managed to at
tract thousands of teenage recruits from northern
Nicaragua, formerly a ripe recruiting area for the guardia
One of the more cynical aspects of American foreign
policy, which is often overlooked, is that while U.S. support
of the contras encourages these youths to fight and die,
America has no intention of seeing the contras through to
victory. U.S. policy, as stated by an undersecretary of state
who appeared here last year, is merely to "put pressure on
the Sandinistas."
The strength of popular support for the contras can be
gauged by the fact that all their bases are across the border
in Honduras or Costa Rica and that they have never been
able to control any territory in Nicaragua.
Nevertheless, Ronald Reagan has hailed the contras as the
"moral equivalent of the founding fathers" and at one point
proclaimed, "I'm a contra too."
Let's take a look at what our president's "brethren" have
been up to. In 1983, 50 or so contras opened fire on a bus
full of civilians, killing 10. That same year, they entered the
village of Pantasma and summarily executed three citizens,
and they went on a murdering, robbing and raping spree in
the town of Jalapa. In 1985, contra death squads murdered
15 Hondurans and an undetermined number of Salvadorans
and Nicaraguans living in Honduras.
A March 1985 "Americas Watch" report concluded that
the contras rely on "the deliberate use of terror," while the
independent Washington Office in Latin America cited 28
murders, rapes and instances of torture committed by the
contras.
A CIA manual that surfaced in 1984 gives some clue to the
nature of our government's humanitarian aid to the contras.
The manual, a primer used to instruct contra officers, con
tained pointers on how to assassinate people, commit black
mail and commit terrorism. One section noted that "armed
propaganda improves the behavior of the population."
I'm not entirely sure what "armed propaganda" means,
but it all sounds a lot like state-sponsored terrorism to me.
Terrorists commit wanton acts of violence to attract atten
tion to their cause and to establish a reputation for ruthless
ness. U.S. policy toward Nicaragua fits this definition of ter
rorism all too well.
The Reagan administration is supporting the contras'
brutality in order to destabilize the Sandinista government,
to make an example of Nicaragua for the benefit of any
other Latin American nations thinking about experimenting
with socialism. Our message: Don't mess with us. Our
"cause": preserving American hegemony in the region. Our
tactics: terrorism, sabotage and random violence against the
civilian population.
Almost exactly a year ago, President Reagan was denounc
ing Col. Khadafi's "state-sponsored terrorism'' as the
"criminal outrages of an outlaw regime." In 1987 we are
beginning to discover that it is the U.S. regime that is full of
criminals, and our policy that has been an outrage.
