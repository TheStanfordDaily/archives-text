Reinterpretation
of new tax law
brings good news
We are very pleased to announce
that a continuing review and careful
interpretation of the tax laws shows
that teaching and research assistants
whose appointments for the 1986-87
academic year were both 1) made
before Aug. 17, 1986, and 2) exempt
from tax under prior law, remain
exempt on both stipend and tuition
remission for the duration of the
1986-87 academic year. These students
therefore will not have tax withheld.
This revises the interpretation of the
new tax law in earlier tax memos to
the University community, which
indicated that all assistantships would
be subject to tax beginning Jan. 1,
1987.
Those individuals who were taxable
under 1986 tax law will continue to
have tax withheld from their stipends
as before. As stated in a previous tax
memo, withholding on tuition for
these individuals will not start until
more than $5,250 in tuition is used
from an assistantship source; this
amount remains exempt under the
Employees Educational Assistance Act.
The details are as follows. Under
the old tax law (IRS sections 117 a and
117b), the amount received for re
search and teaching assistants whose
appointments were in fulfillment of
degree requirements were exempt
from tax on both stipend and remis
sion tuition because, for tax purposes,
those assistantships were treated as
fellowships. The reason was that, to
the extent assistantships provided

teaching and research services, the
same services were required of all
candidates for the degree whether or
not they were compensated. Although
the law has changed, effective Jan. 1,
1987, the effective date provisions of
the Tax Reform Act provide that any
scholarships and fellowships granted
before Aug. 17, 1986, are governed by
the old law. It is our understanding
that virtually all graduate financial aid
for the 1986-87 academic year was
granted before the cutoff date,
whether called fellowships or assis
tantships. Those awards remain ex
empt as to both stipend and tuition
remission if they would have been
exempt under the old law.
Any student who is unsure about
the date of his or her award should
check with the department administra
tor or the Financial Aids Office. If
further clarification is needed, the
Graduate Awards Office in 590-209
should be contacted.
We expect to receive clarification
about the way multi-year awards will
be treated for tax purposes before the
end of spring quarter. In any event,
we are working hard to help mitigate
some of the effect of the Tax Reform
Act for all graduate students in aca
demic 1987-88.
Happy New Year!

Donations help
AIDS victims
From January to June of 1984,1 had
the great privilege and pleasure of
carpooling with three fellow members

of the Stanford community: a graduate
student in computer science, a libra
rian of great wit and intelligence and a
young statistician dividing her time
between a heart disease prevention
program and an AIDS care project.
During our daily trips we had the
luxury of conversation, and our
dialogue often turned to the issues
surrounding AIDS: the biological
aspects of the epidemic, the epidemic
of hatred and fear directed toward the
victims, the failure of institutionalized
religion to administer to the sick and
the helplessness of the dispropor
tionately large number of ethnic AIDS
victims. All of us resolved to help end
the tragedy in whatever ways we
could. In a cruel twist of irony, this
last year one of the original hardwork
ing idealists from my carpool was lost
to AIDS.
I mention this for several reasons,
not the least of which is to demon
strate that there are many people near
to us as 1987 begins who have had
some human connection with victims
of AIDS, either through the Stanford
community, volunteer work, or our
families and friends. The second
reason I mention this is the giving
many of us do at this time of the year
United Way is a fairly traditional
way to provide donations. However,
none of the United Way listings this
year are devoted to AIDS research,
assistance to AIDS patients or vital
public education about AIDS. Setting
aside the possible reasons for omit
ting the AIDS organizations (note:
public opinion surveys rate AIDS as
the chief health concern of
Americans), let me suggest a solution
to others who are in my position and
wish to help end this disease.
After discussing the dilemma with

Lowell Price and Margarita Ibarra,
Stanford community organizers for
this year's campaign, I found that the
easiest way to donate to an AlDS
related agency is accomplished by
completing a form called the United
Way Donor Designation, which asks
the contributor for the name and
address of the chosen agency. Ques
tions about which agencies to contrib
ute to and requests for Donor Desig
nation forms may be directed to Ms.
Ibarra at University Events and
Services.
I urge everyone to join me in spe
cifically designating AIDS-related
agencies as beneficiaries of their
United Way contributions. Further, 1
urge those of you who are courageous
spirits to donate some of your time
during the holidays to help per
sonally. This past year has seen a
tremendous collaboration of assis
tance in the way of education,
fundraising and services on the part of
the Stanford community to help end
AIDS. We have not turned the corner
just yet, so let us redouble our efforts
in 1987.
