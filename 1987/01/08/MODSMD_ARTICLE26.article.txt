### TRACY FURUTANI Editorial staff 
The beginning of a traditional (i.e. Julian/Gregorian
calendar) year somehow always demands a retrospective, a
insightful re-examination of the previous 12 months — es
pecially in the finer newspapers. Loaded with the pithy and
the witty, these sorts of essays are sure circulation-boosters
as readers weepily pore over the assorted memories. For in
stance:
Stanford, as seen through the eye, ear, nose and throat of
The Daily, had an interesting year, son of.
The University divested from companies doing business
with South Africa, sort of. The Western Culture Program was
the subject of intense scrutiny and revision, sort of. The foot
ball team had a banner year, son of.
You get the idea.
The sad fact about these pieces is that they are limited to
one year. Not an awful lot can happen in one year, especially
if one is limited to events occuring in a certain few thousand
acres in Northern California.
Instead, let's travel through time and pick up some inter
esting baubles along the way.
Distasteful cartoons
The comic strip to the right, while not particularly jocular,
nonetheless produced a large brouhaha.
The cartoon appeared on Oct. 2,1979, and scarcely had it
seen the light of day before The Daily had its first bona fide
controversy of the year.
"Your humor ought not to insult any group of human
beings," wrote one professor in the letters column. "The
recent cartoons ... ridicule all P.E. majors. Substitute 'Poles,'
blacks' or 'women' in the cartoons, and you will immedi
ately realize how distasteful they are.
" 'Tain't funny," he concluded.
Which, of course, brought a predictable response.

"To compare the ridicule of Poles, blacks and women
with that of P.E. majors is an argument of improper associa
tion," thundered the response from the president of GASP
(Group to Amuse Sour Pusses).
"Since the University has no P.E. major, it is hard to imag
ine who could be personally offended by these cartoons,"
was the thrust of his argument. "If the professor is
righteously defending an otherwise unknown oppressed
group that has not yet found its public voice, I suggest that
he take up the cause of short people, to which I have been
devoted for some time."
Which, of course, brought the predictable responses of
"Yeah, I support your fight for the rights of short people"
and "I'm a proud P.E. major." The entire controversy lasted
about a month, about average for a letters war.
Kalis pell Curse
A Stanford junior tried to enter what he thought was his
Palo Alto home in the early morning hours of Feb. 5, 1908.
Unfortunately, it wasn't.
All he succeeded in doing was awakening the residents,
one of whom shot him to death with a .22 caliber rifle.
The inquest brought out some interesting associations.
The student was exactly a block away from his actual
home; he had missed his street in the dark.
The dead student was an electrical engineering major; the
man who shot him was the Uriiversity's chief engineer.
Finally, the student was from Kalispell, Mont. "A peculiar
fact connected with the tragedy is ... that two Stanford stu
dents, who were drowned last summer, were also from
Kalispell," The Daily said.
There's a riot going on
The trouble always begins with beer. The beer in early
December, 1905, was kept in Mullen's Hall, a Palo Alto
tavern.
So when AB. Cox and several of his friends walked into
the bar after a long day of classes to sample some of that
beer, they weren't really expecting what they were walking

into — such as a haymaker.
After a brief, but widespread, tussle, the contestants
hastily departed before the arrival of the local gendarmes.
Nonetheless, the chief of police recognized Cox the next
day and arrested him. The Stanford sophomore was taken
into custody for disturbing the peace — a charge for which
he was formally acquitted the following day.
"The affair in Palo Alto last Tuesday night was unfortun
ate, but the aftermath of the affair is especially to be
regretted," opined a Daily Palo Alto editorial, which la
mented the fact that Stanford students were blamed for in
stigating the fight. "In fact the story of the students con
cerned places the blame on the (Chief of Police's) deputies
— and the word of the students should not be questioned
when pitted against the riff-raff of the town.
.. It (the fight) seems to have been caused by the scum
of Palo Alto, hired by Mullen, proprietor of the hall. These
men (the deputies), excluding the chief of police, are
known to be a set of ruffians who were totally unfit for such
a task.
So imagine the mood of campus administrators, coming
off of this affair, when they heard about the beer in Encina
Hall (then a dormitory). Apparently, the upperclassmen

were engaging in some upperclass hijinks, specifically "the
tubbing of a freshman," when, with all the beer and what,
this to-do also to-did and degenerated into a "riot."
Two men were suspended from the University, and this
fray attracted the notice of the Alumnus, the predecessor of
the Stanford Observer.
"The writer of the principal editorial in the recent issue of
the Alumnus displays lamentable ignorance in regard to the
conditions which prevail in Encina Hall — ignorance almost
as dense as that of the Student Affairs Committee," went one
Daily editorial, written by Editor in Chief Ben Allen.
"Even the so-called riot, which so effectively called the at-"
tention of the public to the painful fact that the inmates of
the Hall are guarded by a drunken thug, was tame in com
parison to the 'rough-houses' which in the past took place in
the Hall without exciting either public comment or official
displeasure," he continued.
"And it might be well to further inform the committee
that the truly representative occupants of Encina pay cash
rental for their rooms," hazarded Allen.
And hazard it was, for Allen was called on the carpet
