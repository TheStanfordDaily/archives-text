### TRACY FURUTANI Editorial staff 
The beginning of a traditional (i.e. Julian/Gregorian
calendar) year somehow always demands a retrospective, a
insightful re-examination of the previous 12 months — es
pecially in the finer newspapers. Loaded with the pithy and
the witty, these sorts of essays are sure circulation-boosters
as readers weepily pore over the assorted memories. For in
stance:
Stanford, as seen through the eye, ear, nose and throat of
The Daily, had an interesting year, son of.
The University divested from companies doing business
with South Africa, sort of. The Western Culture Program was
the subject of intense scrutiny and revision, sort of. The foot
ball team had a banner year, son of.
You get the idea.
The sad fact about these pieces is that they are limited to
one year. Not an awful lot can happen in one year, especially
if one is limited to events occuring in a certain few thousand
acres in Northern California.
Instead, let's travel through time and pick up some inter
esting baubles along the way.
Distasteful cartoons
The comic strip to the right, while not particularly jocular,
nonetheless produced a large brouhaha.
The cartoon appeared on Oct. 2,1979, and scarcely had it
seen the light of day before The Daily had its first bona fide
controversy of the year.
"Your humor ought not to insult any group of human
beings," wrote one professor in the letters column. "The
recent cartoons ... ridicule all P.E. majors. Substitute 'Poles,'
blacks' or 'women' in the cartoons, and you will immedi
ately realize how distasteful they are.
" 'Tain't funny," he concluded.
Which, of course, brought a predictable response.

"To compare the ridicule of Poles, blacks and women
with that of P.E. majors is an argument of improper associa
tion," thundered the response from the president of GASP
(Group to Amuse Sour Pusses).
"Since the University has no P.E. major, it is hard to imag
ine who could be personally offended by these cartoons,"
was the thrust of his argument. "If the professor is
righteously defending an otherwise unknown oppressed
group that has not yet found its public voice, I suggest that
he take up the cause of short people, to which I have been
devoted for some time."
Which, of course, brought the predictable responses of
"Yeah, I support your fight for the rights of short people"
and "I'm a proud P.E. major." The entire controversy lasted
about a month, about average for a letters war.
Kalis pell Curse
A Stanford junior tried to enter what he thought was his
Palo Alto home in the early morning hours of Feb. 5, 1908.
Unfortunately, it wasn't.
All he succeeded in doing was awakening the residents,
one of whom shot him to death with a .22 caliber rifle.
The inquest brought out some interesting associations.
The student was exactly a block away from his actual
home; he had missed his street in the dark.
The dead student was an electrical engineering major; the
man who shot him was the Uriiversity's chief engineer.
Finally, the student was from Kalispell, Mont. "A peculiar
fact connected with the tragedy is ... that two Stanford stu
dents, who were drowned last summer, were also from
Kalispell," The Daily said.
There's a riot going on
The trouble always begins with beer. The beer in early
December, 1905, was kept in Mullen's Hall, a Palo Alto
tavern.
So when AB. Cox and several of his friends walked into
the bar after a long day of classes to sample some of that
beer, they weren't really expecting what they were walking

into — such as a haymaker.
After a brief, but widespread, tussle, the contestants
hastily departed before the arrival of the local gendarmes.
Nonetheless, the chief of police recognized Cox the next
day and arrested him. The Stanford sophomore was taken
into custody for disturbing the peace — a charge for which
he was formally acquitted the following day.
"The affair in Palo Alto last Tuesday night was unfortun
ate, but the aftermath of the affair is especially to be
regretted," opined a Daily Palo Alto editorial, which la
mented the fact that Stanford students were blamed for in
stigating the fight. "In fact the story of the students con
cerned places the blame on the (Chief of Police's) deputies
— and the word of the students should not be questioned
when pitted against the riff-raff of the town.
.. It (the fight) seems to have been caused by the scum
of Palo Alto, hired by Mullen, proprietor of the hall. These
men (the deputies), excluding the chief of police, are
known to be a set of ruffians who were totally unfit for such
a task.
So imagine the mood of campus administrators, coming
off of this affair, when they heard about the beer in Encina
Hall (then a dormitory). Apparently, the upperclassmen

were engaging in some upperclass hijinks, specifically "the
tubbing of a freshman," when, with all the beer and what,
this to-do also to-did and degenerated into a "riot."
Two men were suspended from the University, and this
fray attracted the notice of the Alumnus, the predecessor of
the Stanford Observer.
"The writer of the principal editorial in the recent issue of
the Alumnus displays lamentable ignorance in regard to the
conditions which prevail in Encina Hall — ignorance almost
as dense as that of the Student Affairs Committee," went one
Daily editorial, written by Editor in Chief Ben Allen.
"Even the so-called riot, which so effectively called the at-"
tention of the public to the painful fact that the inmates of
the Hall are guarded by a drunken thug, was tame in com
parison to the 'rough-houses' which in the past took place in
the Hall without exciting either public comment or official
displeasure," he continued.
"And it might be well to further inform the committee
that the truly representative occupants of Encina pay cash
rental for their rooms," hazarded Allen.
And hazard it was, for Allen was called on the carpet
before the "dense" Student Affairs Committee.
According to a Daily article, "at the close of the confer
ence the members of the committee expressed an opinion
to the effect that the editorial was vicious, unfair and in
clined to obstruct the work of the committee in their efforts
to establish harmony in the big dormitory."
The upshot of that conference was that Allen was
suspended from the University. Allen refused some condi
tions the committee had given him which, in effect, would
have been a complete retraction of his editorial.
Apparently, his statement about "paying cash rental" hit
the committee in the craw, for that was one of the only two
sentences to which the suspension letter specifically
referred.
Allen appealed the suspension and, a month later, was un
conditionally reinstated, somewhat cynically. "When Allen
was suspended ... it was understood by the committee that
he would be permitted to return at the expiration of a short
period, if he so desired," reported The Daily.
Home is where you have your beer.
Lion around
Though journalistic attacks on the administration are
dealt with in an extreme degree, the authorities seem to be
less vindictive over the dynamiting of fraternity icons.
For 10 years, the white concrete lion had guarded the en
trance to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house and had thus been
the target of many painting raids. The lion was always
repainted white after each raid.
But then came the night of the greatest raid ever, one

from which the affectionately named Leo would never
recover. At 3:17 a.m. PST, Mar 4, 1957, an explosive device
was placed between Leo's paws and detonated.
"Small pieces of Leo were scattered over a 50-foot area
but most of him just sort of fell apart' in place," reported
The Daily. And this was no panty-waist bomb: ' The explo
sion shattered seven windows in the post office across the
street and three in the fraternity house."
Federal investigators were on the scene to examine the
damage to federal property.
Everyone else, though, seemed to be quite nonchalant
about the matter. In fact, the University spokesman
"explained that the explosive was undoubtedly of the con
ventional type. He declared, 'this was not the test of a new
And l.jgr, wr^|
Take Senator Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). A leader
in the Senate, he defeated an up-and-coming congressman,
charges of liberalism and old age and the broad conserva
tive shift of the nation to win re-election last year.
But that is Alan Cranston today. Fifty-two years ago, he was
merely a Stanford student, being amused by it all and
writing letters to The Daily.
Setting the scenario: During the early half of this century,
there was a traditional dance in late April called "The
Masque Ball." The formal ball was presided over by an
elected King and Queen. This election took place over the
course of the last two weeks before the ball.
In 1935, 20 women and 22 men ran for Queen and King,
respectively. "The first and only campus-wide free vote will
take place at all living groups Monday noon," said The Daily.

"After this vote, the stragglers will be eliminated, and the
leaders of each sex will fight it out on a cash basis...
Yes, politicos, this is just about the only election where
you could legitimately buy your way into office. Votes cost a
penny, the proceeds benefited Stanford's Convalescent
Home for Children.
Among the candidates for Queen were illuminaries such
as Backy "Committee of Five" Butts, Nancy "Fancy" Pet-
Nancy "I Like You Too" Pollock and Helen "Them
There Eyes" Ramming, while the males could boast of King-
lohnnv "220 feet" Mottram, "Two Gun" Dick Kelley,
and lack "I'll Be Hard to Handle" Walton
Underlying all the fun and frivoloity was the dark under
current of class: back then, there were two sets of women —
the ones who had the pull ojahe latest into
the sororities, and the oneslio £lnßT&sJk>rity /omen
looked down on the "Hall tmKwas rat a little
on sides. B J M
Runror had it mat a was in the
lead after the initial round of free balloting, but that "the
girls from the halls are unknown quantities, though several
dark horse rumors have convulsed the fillies at the Lagunita
and Roble stables," according to The Daily.
And, into the second day of buying votes, the Row candi
date had a commanding 1,500 penny ($l5) lead over the
nearest Hall contender.
Then a miraculous thing happened. "Coming out of 11
o'clock classes, students were mildly interested in a plane
doing a bit of smoke writing in the skies," said a Daily edito
rial. "When the writing became legible enough for everyone
to interpret, it became apparent that here was a drama in the
making — the would-be queen telling the world how to
spell her name." The Daily applauded this action.
The name was that of Ramming, and this Hall queen can

didate pulled ahead of the Row's Pettigrew by a mere $1.40
with one day of purchasing to go.
The next day, the headlines said it all: Sorority Backers
Combine To Avert Rising Vote For Hall Women.
"The sorority pool that elected Pettigrew was effected at
3:10, five minutes before the polls closed, when Row back
ers of the five candidates, fearful of Hall victory and the
high-pressure support given by Helen Ramming s backers,
swung over to the Alphi Phi candidate, and in doing so, she
picked up about $815, doubling Ramming's final vote tally
and denying the Halls the crown.
"I know of nothing more encouraging to hypocrisy and
class snobbery than the masked ball queen contest, wrote
one disgruntled observer. .. To mask social snobbery be
hind the thin veil of charity is a thing in which 1 don t think
Stanford women should indulge.
Enter Alan Cranston.
"(The previous writer) based his letter upon the assump
tion that the means do not justify the ends, wrote Cranston.
"If he is right... everything connected with the Masque Ball
Queen Contest was wrong. Instead of adopting a clever
means of raising money for the Convalescent Home, Stan
ford should merely have canvassed the halls and houses
and come off with a quarter of the sum actually raised.
He pointed out that The Daily was wrong in shooting the
publicity plane. "The greatest showmen in the world, from
P.T. Barnum to Adolf Hitler, have known that publicity
money is seldom wasted," he continued.
But another letter-writer stole the show that day.
"And if you must pan somebody or something, get after
the election committee for commercially tallying the vote in
dollars and cents (gently, though, and with a smile); or get
after the female element for dropping hairpins on the Quad
and messing things up." And that was all she wrote.

For 10 years, the white concrete lion had guarded the en

But that is Alan Cranston today. Fifty-two years ago, he was
merely a Stanford student, being amused by it all and
writing letters to The Daily.
Setting the scenario: During the early half of this century,
there was a traditional dance in late April called "The
Masque Ball." The formal ball was presided over by an
elected King and Queen. This election took place over the
course of the last two weeks before the ball.
In 1935, 20 women and 22 men ran for Queen and King,
respectively. "The first and only campus-wide free vote will

And, into the second day of buying votes, the Row candi

Then a miraculous thing happened. "Coming out of 11

The name was that of Ramming, and this Hall queen can

with one day of purchasing to go.
The next day, the headlines said it all: Sorority Backers

The sad fact about these pieces is that they are limited to
one year. Not an awful lot can happen in one year, especially
if one is limited to events occuring in a certain few thousand
acres in Northern California.
Instead, let's travel through time and pick up some inter
esting baubles along the way.
Distasteful cartoons
The comic strip to the right, while not particularly jocular,
nonetheless produced a large brouhaha.
The cartoon appeared on Oct. 2,1979, and scarcely had it
seen the light of day before The Daily had its first bona fide
controversy of the year.
"Your humor ought not to insult any group of human
beings," wrote one professor in the letters column. "The
recent cartoons ... ridicule all P.E. majors. Substitute 'Poles,'
blacks' or 'women' in the cartoons, and you will immedi
ately realize how distasteful they are.
" 'Tain't funny," he concluded.
Which, of course, brought a predictable response.

"To compare the ridicule of Poles, blacks and women
with that of P.E. majors is an argument of improper associa
tion," thundered the response from the president of GASP
(Group to Amuse Sour Pusses).
"Since the University has no P.E. major, it is hard to imag
ine who could be personally offended by these cartoons,"
was the thrust of his argument. "If the professor is
righteously defending an otherwise unknown oppressed
group that has not yet found its public voice, I suggest that
he take up the cause of short people, to which I have been
devoted for some time."
Which, of course, brought the predictable responses of
"Yeah, I support your fight for the rights of short people"
and "I'm a proud P.E. major." The entire controversy lasted
about a month, about average for a letters war.
Kalis pell Curse
A Stanford junior tried to enter what he thought was his
Palo Alto home in the early morning hours of Feb. 5, 1908.
Unfortunately, it wasn't.
All he succeeded in doing was awakening the residents,
one of whom shot him to death with a .22 caliber rifle.
The inquest brought out some interesting associations.
The student was exactly a block away from his actual
home; he had missed his street in the dark.
The dead student was an electrical engineering major; the
man who shot him was the Uriiversity's chief engineer.
Finally, the student was from Kalispell, Mont. "A peculiar
fact connected with the tragedy is ... that two Stanford stu
dents, who were drowned last summer, were also from
Kalispell," The Daily said.
There's a riot going on
The trouble always begins with beer. The beer in early
December, 1905, was kept in Mullen's Hall, a Palo Alto
tavern.
So when AB. Cox and several of his friends walked into
the bar after a long day of classes to sample some of that
beer, they weren't really expecting what they were walking

into — such as a haymaker.
After a brief, but widespread, tussle, the contestants
hastily departed before the arrival of the local gendarmes.
Nonetheless, the chief of police recognized Cox the next
day and arrested him. The Stanford sophomore was taken
into custody for disturbing the peace — a charge for which
he was formally acquitted the following day.
"The affair in Palo Alto last Tuesday night was unfortun
ate, but the aftermath of the affair is especially to be
regretted," opined a Daily Palo Alto editorial, which la
mented the fact that Stanford students were blamed for in
stigating the fight. "In fact the story of the students con
cerned places the blame on the (Chief of Police's) deputies
— and the word of the students should not be questioned
when pitted against the riff-raff of the town.
.. It (the fight) seems to have been caused by the scum
of Palo Alto, hired by Mullen, proprietor of the hall. These
men (the deputies), excluding the chief of police, are
known to be a set of ruffians who were totally unfit for such
a task.
So imagine the mood of campus administrators, coming
off of this affair, when they heard about the beer in Encina
Hall (then a dormitory). Apparently, the upperclassmen

were engaging in some upperclass hijinks, specifically "the
tubbing of a freshman," when, with all the beer and what,
this to-do also to-did and degenerated into a "riot."
Two men were suspended from the University, and this
fray attracted the notice of the Alumnus, the predecessor of
the Stanford Observer.
"The writer of the principal editorial in the recent issue of
the Alumnus displays lamentable ignorance in regard to the
conditions which prevail in Encina Hall — ignorance almost
as dense as that of the Student Affairs Committee," went one
Daily editorial, written by Editor in Chief Ben Allen.
"Even the so-called riot, which so effectively called the at-"
tention of the public to the painful fact that the inmates of
the Hall are guarded by a drunken thug, was tame in com
parison to the 'rough-houses' which in the past took place in
the Hall without exciting either public comment or official
displeasure," he continued.
"And it might be well to further inform the committee
that the truly representative occupants of Encina pay cash
rental for their rooms," hazarded Allen.
And hazard it was, for Allen was called on the carpet
before the "dense" Student Affairs Committee.
According to a Daily article, "at the close of the confer
ence the members of the committee expressed an opinion
to the effect that the editorial was vicious, unfair and in
clined to obstruct the work of the committee in their efforts
to establish harmony in the big dormitory."
The upshot of that conference was that Allen was
suspended from the University. Allen refused some condi
tions the committee had given him which, in effect, would
have been a complete retraction of his editorial.
Apparently, his statement about "paying cash rental" hit
the committee in the craw, for that was one of the only two
sentences to which the suspension letter specifically
referred.
Allen appealed the suspension and, a month later, was un
conditionally reinstated, somewhat cynically. "When Allen
was suspended ... it was understood by the committee that
he would be permitted to return at the expiration of a short
period, if he so desired," reported The Daily.

The sad fact about these pieces is that they are limited to
one year. Not an awful lot can happen in one year, especially
if one is limited to events occuring in a certain few thousand
acres in Northern California.
Instead, let's travel through time and pick up some inter
esting baubles along the way.
Distasteful cartoons
The comic strip to the right, while not particularly jocular,
nonetheless produced a large brouhaha.
The cartoon appeared on Oct. 2,1979, and scarcely had it
seen the light of day before The Daily had its first bona fide
controversy of the year.
"Your humor ought not to insult any group of human
beings," wrote one professor in the letters column. "The
recent cartoons ... ridicule all P.E. majors. Substitute 'Poles,'
blacks' or 'women' in the cartoons, and you will immedi
ately realize how distasteful they are.
" 'Tain't funny," he concluded.
Which, of course, brought a predictable response.

"To compare the ridicule of Poles, blacks and women
with that of P.E. majors is an argument of improper associa
tion," thundered the response from the president of GASP
(Group to Amuse Sour Pusses).
"Since the University has no P.E. major, it is hard to imag
ine who could be personally offended by these cartoons,"
was the thrust of his argument. "If the professor is
righteously defending an otherwise unknown oppressed
group that has not yet found its public voice, I suggest that
he take up the cause of short people, to which I have been
devoted for some time."
Which, of course, brought the predictable responses of
"Yeah, I support your fight for the rights of short people"
and "I'm a proud P.E. major." The entire controversy lasted
about a month, about average for a letters war.
Kalis pell Curse
A Stanford junior tried to enter what he thought was his
Palo Alto home in the early morning hours of Feb. 5, 1908.
Unfortunately, it wasn't.
All he succeeded in doing was awakening the residents,
one of whom shot him to death with a .22 caliber rifle.
The inquest brought out some interesting associations.
The student was exactly a block away from his actual
home; he had missed his street in the dark.
The dead student was an electrical engineering major; the
man who shot him was the Uriiversity's chief engineer.
Finally, the student was from Kalispell, Mont. "A peculiar
fact connected with the tragedy is ... that two Stanford stu
dents, who were drowned last summer, were also from
Kalispell," The Daily said.
There's a riot going on
The trouble always begins with beer. The beer in early
December, 1905, was kept in Mullen's Hall, a Palo Alto
tavern.
So when AB. Cox and several of his friends walked into
the bar after a long day of classes to sample some of that
beer, they weren't really expecting what they were walking

into — such as a haymaker.
After a brief, but widespread, tussle, the contestants
hastily departed before the arrival of the local gendarmes.
Nonetheless, the chief of police recognized Cox the next
day and arrested him. The Stanford sophomore was taken
into custody for disturbing the peace — a charge for which
he was formally acquitted the following day.
"The affair in Palo Alto last Tuesday night was unfortun
ate, but the aftermath of the affair is especially to be
regretted," opined a Daily Palo Alto editorial, which la
mented the fact that Stanford students were blamed for in
stigating the fight. "In fact the story of the students con
cerned places the blame on the (Chief of Police's) deputies
— and the word of the students should not be questioned
when pitted against the riff-raff of the town.
.. It (the fight) seems to have been caused by the scum
of Palo Alto, hired by Mullen, proprietor of the hall. These
men (the deputies), excluding the chief of police, are
known to be a set of ruffians who were totally unfit for such
a task.
So imagine the mood of campus administrators, coming
off of this affair, when they heard about the beer in Encina
Hall (then a dormitory). Apparently, the upperclassmen

were engaging in some upperclass hijinks, specifically "the
tubbing of a freshman," when, with all the beer and what,
this to-do also to-did and degenerated into a "riot."
Two men were suspended from the University, and this
fray attracted the notice of the Alumnus, the predecessor of
the Stanford Observer.
"The writer of the principal editorial in the recent issue of
the Alumnus displays lamentable ignorance in regard to the
conditions which prevail in Encina Hall — ignorance almost
as dense as that of the Student Affairs Committee," went one
Daily editorial, written by Editor in Chief Ben Allen.
"Even the so-called riot, which so effectively called the at-"
tention of the public to the painful fact that the inmates of
the Hall are guarded by a drunken thug, was tame in com
parison to the 'rough-houses' which in the past took place in
the Hall without exciting either public comment or official
displeasure," he continued.
"And it might be well to further inform the committee
that the truly representative occupants of Encina pay cash
rental for their rooms," hazarded Allen.
And hazard it was, for Allen was called on the carpet
before the "dense" Student Affairs Committee.
According to a Daily article, "at the close of the confer
ence the members of the committee expressed an opinion
to the effect that the editorial was vicious, unfair and in
clined to obstruct the work of the committee in their efforts
to establish harmony in the big dormitory."
The upshot of that conference was that Allen was
suspended from the University. Allen refused some condi
tions the committee had given him which, in effect, would
have been a complete retraction of his editorial.
Apparently, his statement about "paying cash rental" hit
the committee in the craw, for that was one of the only two
sentences to which the suspension letter specifically
referred.
Allen appealed the suspension and, a month later, was un
conditionally reinstated, somewhat cynically. "When Allen
was suspended ... it was understood by the committee that
he would be permitted to return at the expiration of a short
period, if he so desired," reported The Daily.

Lion around
Though journalistic attacks on the administration are
dealt with in an extreme degree, the authorities seem to be
less vindictive over the dynamiting of fraternity icons.
For 10 years, the white concrete lion had guarded the en
trance to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house and had thus been
the target of many painting raids. The lion was always
repainted white after each raid.
But then came the night of the greatest raid ever, one

from which the affectionately named Leo would never
recover. At 3:17 a.m. PST, Mar 4, 1957, an explosive device
was placed between Leo's paws and detonated.
"Small pieces of Leo were scattered over a 50-foot area
but most of him just sort of fell apart' in place," reported
The Daily. And this was no panty-waist bomb: ' The explo
sion shattered seven windows in the post office across the
street and three in the fraternity house."
Federal investigators were on the scene to examine the
damage to federal property.
Everyone else, though, seemed to be quite nonchalant
about the matter. In fact, the University spokesman
"explained that the explosive was undoubtedly of the con

Take Senator Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). A leader
in the Senate, he defeated an up-and-coming congressman,
charges of liberalism and old age and the broad conserva
tive shift of the nation to win re-election last year.
But that is Alan Cranston today. Fifty-two years ago, he was
merely a Stanford student, being amused by it all and
writing letters to The Daily.
Setting the scenario: During the early half of this century,
there was a traditional dance in late April called "The
Masque Ball." The formal ball was presided over by an
elected King and Queen. This election took place over the
course of the last two weeks before the ball.
In 1935, 20 women and 22 men ran for Queen and King,
respectively. "The first and only campus-wide free vote will
take place at all living groups Monday noon," said The Daily.

"After this vote, the stragglers will be eliminated, and the
leaders of each sex will fight it out on a cash basis...
Yes, politicos, this is just about the only election where
you could legitimately buy your way into office. Votes cost a
penny, the proceeds benefited Stanford's Convalescent
Home for Children.
Among the candidates for Queen were illuminaries such
as Backy "Committee of Five" Butts, Nancy "Fancy" Pet-
Nancy "I Like You Too" Pollock and Helen "Them
There Eyes" Ramming, while the males could boast of King-
lohnnv "220 feet" Mottram, "Two Gun" Dick Kelley,
and lack "I'll Be Hard to Handle" Walton
Underlying all the fun and frivoloity was the dark under
current of class: back then, there were two sets of women —

the sororities, and the oneslio £lnßT&sJk>rity /omen

Runror had it mat a was in the
lead after the initial round of free balloting, but that "the
girls from the halls are unknown quantities, though several
dark horse rumors have convulsed the fillies at the Lagunita
and Roble stables," according to The Daily.
And, into the second day of buying votes, the Row candi
date had a commanding 1,500 penny ($l5) lead over the
nearest Hall contender.
Then a miraculous thing happened. "Coming out of 11
o'clock classes, students were mildly interested in a plane
doing a bit of smoke writing in the skies," said a Daily edito
rial. "When the writing became legible enough for everyone
to interpret, it became apparent that here was a drama in the
making — the would-be queen telling the world how to
spell her name." The Daily applauded this action.
The name was that of Ramming, and this Hall queen can

didate pulled ahead of the Row's Pettigrew by a mere $1.40
with one day of purchasing to go.
The next day, the headlines said it all: Sorority Backers
Combine To Avert Rising Vote For Hall Women.
"The sorority pool that elected Pettigrew was effected at
3:10, five minutes before the polls closed, when Row back
ers of the five candidates, fearful of Hall victory and the
high-pressure support given by Helen Ramming s backers,
swung over to the Alphi Phi candidate, and in doing so, she
picked up about $815, doubling Ramming's final vote tally
and denying the Halls the crown.
"I know of nothing more encouraging to hypocrisy and
class snobbery than the masked ball queen contest, wrote
one disgruntled observer. .. To mask social snobbery be
hind the thin veil of charity is a thing in which 1 don t think
Stanford women should indulge.
Enter Alan Cranston.
"(The previous writer) based his letter upon the assump
tion that the means do not justify the ends, wrote Cranston.
"If he is right... everything connected with the Masque Ball
Queen Contest was wrong. Instead of adopting a clever
means of raising money for the Convalescent Home, Stan
ford should merely have canvassed the halls and houses
and come off with a quarter of the sum actually raised.
He pointed out that The Daily was wrong in shooting the
publicity plane. "The greatest showmen in the world, from
P.T. Barnum to Adolf Hitler, have known that publicity
money is seldom wasted," he continued.
But another letter-writer stole the show that day.
"And if you must pan somebody or something, get after
the election committee for commercially tallying the vote in
dollars and cents (gently, though, and with a smile); or get
after the female element for dropping hairpins on the Quad
and messing things up." And that was all she wrote.
The beginning of a traditional (i.e. Julian/Gregorian

The Daily. And this was no panty-waist bomb: ' The explo

damage to federal property.

Take Senator Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). A leader
in the Senate, he defeated an up-and-coming congressman,
charges of liberalism and old age and the broad conserva
tive shift of the nation to win re-election last year.
But that is Alan Cranston today. Fifty-two years ago, he was
merely a Stanford student, being amused by it all and
writing letters to The Daily.
Setting the scenario: During the early half of this century,
there was a traditional dance in late April called "The
Masque Ball." The formal ball was presided over by an
elected King and Queen. This election took place over the
course of the last two weeks before the ball.
In 1935, 20 women and 22 men ran for Queen and King,
respectively. "The first and only campus-wide free vote will
take place at all living groups Monday noon," said The Daily.

"After this vote, the stragglers will be eliminated, and the
leaders of each sex will fight it out on a cash basis...
Yes, politicos, this is just about the only election where
you could legitimately buy your way into office. Votes cost a
penny, the proceeds benefited Stanford's Convalescent
Home for Children.
Among the candidates for Queen were illuminaries such
as Backy "Committee of Five" Butts, Nancy "Fancy" Pet-
Nancy "I Like You Too" Pollock and Helen "Them
There Eyes" Ramming, while the males could boast of King-
lohnnv "220 feet" Mottram, "Two Gun" Dick Kelley,
and lack "I'll Be Hard to Handle" Walton
Underlying all the fun and frivoloity was the dark under
current of class: back then, there were two sets of women —

lead after the initial round of free balloting, but that "the
girls from the halls are unknown quantities, though several
dark horse rumors have convulsed the fillies at the Lagunita
and Roble stables," according to The Daily.
And, into the second day of buying votes, the Row candi
date had a commanding 1,500 penny ($l5) lead over the
nearest Hall contender.
Then a miraculous thing happened. "Coming out of 11
o'clock classes, students were mildly interested in a plane
doing a bit of smoke writing in the skies," said a Daily edito
rial. "When the writing became legible enough for everyone
to interpret, it became apparent that here was a drama in the
making — the would-be queen telling the world how to
spell her name." The Daily applauded this action.
The name was that of Ramming, and this Hall queen can

didate pulled ahead of the Row's Pettigrew by a mere $1.40
with one day of purchasing to go.
The next day, the headlines said it all: Sorority Backers
Combine To Avert Rising Vote For Hall Women.
"The sorority pool that elected Pettigrew was effected at
3:10, five minutes before the polls closed, when Row back
ers of the five candidates, fearful of Hall victory and the
high-pressure support given by Helen Ramming s backers,
swung over to the Alphi Phi candidate, and in doing so, she
picked up about $815, doubling Ramming's final vote tally
and denying the Halls the crown.
"I know of nothing more encouraging to hypocrisy and
class snobbery than the masked ball queen contest, wrote
one disgruntled observer. .. To mask social snobbery be
hind the thin veil of charity is a thing in which 1 don t think
Stanford women should indulge.
Enter Alan Cranston.
"(The previous writer) based his letter upon the assump
tion that the means do not justify the ends, wrote Cranston.
"If he is right... everything connected with the Masque Ball
Queen Contest was wrong. Instead of adopting a clever
means of raising money for the Convalescent Home, Stan
ford should merely have canvassed the halls and houses
and come off with a quarter of the sum actually raised.
He pointed out that The Daily was wrong in shooting the
publicity plane. "The greatest showmen in the world, from
P.T. Barnum to Adolf Hitler, have known that publicity
money is seldom wasted," he continued.
But another letter-writer stole the show that day.
"And if you must pan somebody or something, get after
the election committee for commercially tallying the vote in
dollars and cents (gently, though, and with a smile); or get
after the female element for dropping hairpins on the Quad
and messing things up." And that was all she wrote.
The beginning of a traditional (i.e. Julian/Gregorian
calendar) year somehow always demands a retrospective, a
insightful re-examination of the previous 12 months — es
pecially in the finer newspapers. Loaded with the pithy and
the witty, these sorts of essays are sure circulation-boosters
as readers weepily pore over the assorted memories. For in
stance:
Stanford, as seen through the eye, ear, nose and throat of
The Daily, had an interesting year, son of.
The University divested from companies doing business
with South Africa, sort of. The Western Culture Program was
the subject of intense scrutiny and revision, sort of. The foot
ball team had a banner year, son of.
You get the idea.
The sad fact about these pieces is that they are limited to
one year. Not an awful lot can happen in one year, especially
if one is limited to events occuring in a certain few thousand
acres in Northern California.
Instead, let's travel through time and pick up some inter
esting baubles along the way.
Distasteful cartoons
The comic strip to the right, while not particularly jocular,
nonetheless produced a large brouhaha.
The cartoon appeared on Oct. 2,1979, and scarcely had it
seen the light of day before The Daily had its first bona fide
controversy of the year.
"Your humor ought not to insult any group of human
beings," wrote one professor in the letters column. "The
recent cartoons ... ridicule all P.E. majors. Substitute 'Poles,'
blacks' or 'women' in the cartoons, and you will immedi
ately realize how distasteful they are.
" 'Tain't funny," he concluded.
Which, of course, brought a predictable response.

"To compare the ridicule of Poles, blacks and women
with that of P.E. majors is an argument of improper associa
tion," thundered the response from the president of GASP
(Group to Amuse Sour Pusses).
"Since the University has no P.E. major, it is hard to imag
ine who could be personally offended by these cartoons,"
was the thrust of his argument. "If the professor is
righteously defending an otherwise unknown oppressed
group that has not yet found its public voice, I suggest that
he take up the cause of short people, to which I have been
devoted for some time."
Which, of course, brought the predictable responses of
"Yeah, I support your fight for the rights of short people"
and "I'm a proud P.E. major." The entire controversy lasted
about a month, about average for a letters war.
Kalis pell Curse
A Stanford junior tried to enter what he thought was his
Palo Alto home in the early morning hours of Feb. 5, 1908.
Unfortunately, it wasn't.
All he succeeded in doing was awakening the residents,
one of whom shot him to death with a .22 caliber rifle.
The inquest brought out some interesting associations.
The student was exactly a block away from his actual
home; he had missed his street in the dark.
The dead student was an electrical engineering major; the
man who shot him was the Uriiversity's chief engineer.
Finally, the student was from Kalispell, Mont. "A peculiar
fact connected with the tragedy is ... that two Stanford stu
dents, who were drowned last summer, were also from
Kalispell," The Daily said.
There's a riot going on
The trouble always begins with beer. The beer in early
December, 1905, was kept in Mullen's Hall, a Palo Alto
tavern.
So when AB. Cox and several of his friends walked into
the bar after a long day of classes to sample some of that
beer, they weren't really expecting what they were walking

into — such as a haymaker.
After a brief, but widespread, tussle, the contestants
hastily departed before the arrival of the local gendarmes.
Nonetheless, the chief of police recognized Cox the next
day and arrested him. The Stanford sophomore was taken
into custody for disturbing the peace — a charge for which
he was formally acquitted the following day.
"The affair in Palo Alto last Tuesday night was unfortun
ate, but the aftermath of the affair is especially to be
regretted," opined a Daily Palo Alto editorial, which la
mented the fact that Stanford students were blamed for in
stigating the fight. "In fact the story of the students con
cerned places the blame on the (Chief of Police's) deputies
— and the word of the students should not be questioned
when pitted against the riff-raff of the town.
.. It (the fight) seems to have been caused by the scum
of Palo Alto, hired by Mullen, proprietor of the hall. These
men (the deputies), excluding the chief of police, are
known to be a set of ruffians who were totally unfit for such
a task.
So imagine the mood of campus administrators, coming
off of this affair, when they heard about the beer in Encina
Hall (then a dormitory). Apparently, the upperclassmen

were engaging in some upperclass hijinks, specifically "the
tubbing of a freshman," when, with all the beer and what,
this to-do also to-did and degenerated into a "riot."
Two men were suspended from the University, and this
fray attracted the notice of the Alumnus, the predecessor of
the Stanford Observer.
"The writer of the principal editorial in the recent issue of
the Alumnus displays lamentable ignorance in regard to the
conditions which prevail in Encina Hall — ignorance almost
as dense as that of the Student Affairs Committee," went one
Daily editorial, written by Editor in Chief Ben Allen.
"Even the so-called riot, which so effectively called the at-"
tention of the public to the painful fact that the inmates of
the Hall are guarded by a drunken thug, was tame in com
parison to the 'rough-houses' which in the past took place in
the Hall without exciting either public comment or official
displeasure," he continued.
"And it might be well to further inform the committee
that the truly representative occupants of Encina pay cash
rental for their rooms," hazarded Allen.
And hazard it was, for Allen was called on the carpet
before the "dense" Student Affairs Committee.
According to a Daily article, "at the close of the confer
ence the members of the committee expressed an opinion
to the effect that the editorial was vicious, unfair and in
clined to obstruct the work of the committee in their efforts
to establish harmony in the big dormitory."
The upshot of that conference was that Allen was
suspended from the University. Allen refused some condi
tions the committee had given him which, in effect, would
have been a complete retraction of his editorial.
Apparently, his statement about "paying cash rental" hit
the committee in the craw, for that was one of the only two
sentences to which the suspension letter specifically
referred.
Allen appealed the suspension and, a month later, was un
conditionally reinstated, somewhat cynically. "When Allen
was suspended ... it was understood by the committee that
he would be permitted to return at the expiration of a short
period, if he so desired," reported The Daily.
Home is where you have your beer.
Lion around
Though journalistic attacks on the administration are
dealt with in an extreme degree, the authorities seem to be
less vindictive over the dynamiting of fraternity icons.
For 10 years, the white concrete lion had guarded the en
trance to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house and had thus been
the target of many painting raids. The lion was always
repainted white after each raid.
But then came the night of the greatest raid ever, one

from which the affectionately named Leo would never
recover. At 3:17 a.m. PST, Mar 4, 1957, an explosive device
was placed between Leo's paws and detonated.
"Small pieces of Leo were scattered over a 50-foot area
but most of him just sort of fell apart' in place," reported
The Daily. And this was no panty-waist bomb: ' The explo

damage to federal property.
