The Happy Cooker
447 California Avenue
853-9584
The Happy Cooker is a nice place to go when you don't
have the time, the stomach, or the money to eat at Hobee's
or Late for the Train. Equally convenient and at least as
reasonable, The Happy Cooker dares not to be a comfy
cozy-California commune. In fact, it seems to want to be a
Provencal Inn, but it's not that either.
Though it's open until 3 p.m., it's very morning-oriented.
Serving breakfast all day, the restaurant always feels like
morning. The reflection of the heat lamp off the chrome
counter onto the ceiling spreads the dark orange glowing
warmth of sunrise. The florescent lights are as harsh as the
first sunlight through the first-cracked blinds. There's the
orange-yellow color motif; there's the floral-woodsy, white
on-beige wall paper; there's everything but the old red
rooster.
The rest of the decor is distinctly alliterative: Parisian
prints, lily lamps and porcelain plates in curio cabinets. On

the table there is pleasantly no plastic. Instead, there are yel
low wooden handles on the silverware, so it matches the
yellow, orange, brown plaid cloths. And, wouldn't you
know, there are harsh angular salt and pepper shakers with
chrome baron heads, resting on crystal ball bottoms.
The omelettes are especially good. They come with all the
combinations of the regular ingredients, and Linguisa, too.
Three eggs go into them so they are substantial. They are
cooked through, which is so important, but not overly done,
which is more important. They range in price from $3 95 to
$5 95, and they come with a choice of home fries or hash
browns. The home fries have more kick. Also with the
omelettes, you can choose between Hollandaise, Spanish
and Mornay sauces. We found the Hollandaise sauce to be
glutinous and salty. (It rather ruined the Eggs Benedict.)
There are many capable pancakes and one successful
French toast. And The Happy Cooker can substitute for the
hardcores in a pinch and otherwise. To encourage the in
dustrious to break fast there during the week, they offer a
$2.85 special every weekday except holidays.
They're open for lunch, but that's best left for another
day. Judging from a small but very fresh salad bar and an ex
cellent breakfast, we'd say it's worth a try.
