The seascape between Stinson
Beach and Point Reyes offers pleasure,
and a trip there is an adventure. The
hour-and-a-half drive between Stan
ford and this rugged, unspoiled stretch
of coastline serves as a separational
period that represents a leaving be
hind and a striving toward. It lays the
foundation for a heightened enjoy
ment of sand, surf and escape.
The Marin shore can be reached via
Mount Tamalpais and the Muir Woods

It's worth getting behind on work or
budget, because it's therapy and a
treatment.

through Mill Valley from Kentfield-San
Anselmo. Both approaches are star
tlingly beautiful. Both ways are relent
lessly winding, carsickness-inducing
releases. They exaggerate the thrill of
arriving at last to sit on the coarse sand,
to resolve the rocking and winding
with the waves. We walk, play, sleep,
(dream), anything but study, until the
sun sets over the ridge on Point Reyes.
Now it's dinner time.

We retreat back to the generations
old Olema Inn. It's a French
countryside auberge that's rurally ele
gant yet rather urbanly, urbanely
stylish. It's a nice comfortable charm
ing place to stay, but by no means
cheap.
We sit in the homey bar area while
our table was prepared. Amidst a pow
erful up-to-date drinkers' bar, lighted
vases, big filled stately bookcases, high

backed smoking chairs and dark
stained cocktail tables, we worship
very fresh oysters on the half-shell and
some hearty heating Cabernet.
At our table, we enjoy spiced Italian
"pizza-bread" and sturdy sourdough
under whipped butter. The appetizers
may be the highlight of the day. We
have a generous serving of warm duck
in a salad with pears and greens, lubr
icated with a pear-ginger and walnut
oil dressing. This is so good that a des
cription here can only demean the ex
perience. We also try the Poached

Manila Clams and Marconi Cove Mus
sels with ginger, garlic, green onions
and cilantro. This is served light, warm,
Chinese style, seafood-juice broth that
restores all the subtleties that are
otherwise cooked out.
The various entrees enjoyed at the
table are all excellent and worthy of at
tention. I list them for information and
inspiration: grilled filet of Norwegian
Salmon-California; sauteed boned
local baby steelhead with caper-dill
sauce; poached filet of local Rose cod-
Cajun style; spinach and egg fettucine

prepared with endless clams, mussels,
prawns, scallops, crab, sole, white
wine, creme fraiche, sun-dried
tomatoes and herbs. We wash it all
down with a recent Glenoc Chardon
nay.
This day feels like a weekend away.
Far away. It's worth getting behind on
work or budget, because it's a therapy
and a treatment. It improves the quality
of life for more than just the half-day it
occupies. It stays with you as a part of a
world larger than that of books and
bursars.
