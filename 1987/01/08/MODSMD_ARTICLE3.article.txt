## Women's team captain reacts to drug testing 
### JULIE WIDMAN Senior staff writer 
Simone LeVant, captain of Stanford's women's
diving team, filed suit against the NCAA Tuesday
at Santa Clara County Superior Court in response
to the NCAA's new rule that athletes or teams in
volved in postseason competition submit to drug
tests.
According to Levant's attorney, Susan Harriman
of San Francisco's Keker and Brockett, LeVant is
the first person she knows of to challenge the
NCAA rule, passed last January. Harriman, along
with attorney Robert Van Nest, was hired by the
American Civil Liberties Union to represent
LeVant.
LeVant is challenging the constitutionality of
the rule under California law, said Harriman. The
mandatory drug testing violates the right to
privacy, the right to be free from unreasonable
search and seizure and due process of law, she
added.
LeVant is seeking two kinds of relief, according
to Harriman. Tuesday in court she will ask for a
temporary restraining order which will permit
her to compete in diving meets while the case is
going on.
In addition, she is seeking a preliminary injunc
tion which would stop enforcement of the drug
testing procedure. Such an injunction would have
ramifications beyond just Levant's case by declar
ing the rule unconstitutional, said Harriman.
In addition, LeVant, who learned about the test
from a pamphlet describing the procedure and
from talking to other student athletes "who had
undergone it, described it as "embarrassing and
degrading."

The test requires the athlete to urinate into a
cup in the view of a NCAA official, according to
Harriman. The athlete must also drink fluids if
she or he is unable to produce the required
amount of urine.
Stanford football tailback Kevin Scott who took
the urine drug test along with other members of
the team prior to the Gator Bowl said he found
the experience "a little embarrassing" and added
that some players had to "drink juice and wait
around for about half an hour" until they could
complete the test.
"If a football player found (the test) degrading
and humiliating, any woman athlete would find it
much worse," asserted Harriman.
LeVant refused in October to sign the consent
form requiring her to take the drug test and was
subsequently barred from competing this year.
So far she has missed one meet in November and
one currently underway in Texas and has placed
her athletic scholarship in jeopardy, she said.
LeVant said she decided to approach the ACLU
with her case because she felt "(drug testing) was
wrong. There are invasion of privacy laws, and I
thought that something could be done.
"A lot of people didn't think they had a course
of action," she said, explaining what she thinks
motivates other athletes to acquiesce to the test.
She added that many people also do not have the
money or time and are not willing to make the
sacrifices that a lawsuit demands.
LeVant is optimistic about the outcome of the
case. "I don't know much about law, but obvi-
ously the ACLU would not be inter
ested if (the suit) didn't have a
chance."
Drug testing rules of other organiza
tions have been challenged in court
before, according to Harriman, and
most of those cases have been success
ful. "Simone has a pretty good case,"
she said.
LeVant said she is against drug abuse
but "not at the expense of people's in

dividual rights."
LeVant said she had spoken to Stan
ford Athletic Director Andy Geiger and
Faculty Athletic Representative Jack
Friedenthal before approaching the
ACLU, but both men said they could
not do anything to help her.
The Athletic Department refused to
comment about the LeVant case, but in
the past, both Geiger and Friedenthal
have been outspoken in their dislike of
the drug testing rule.

from talking to other student athletes "who had
undergone it, described it as "embarrassing and
degrading."

The test requires the athlete to urinate into a
cup in the view of a NCAA official, according to
Harriman. The athlete must also drink fluids if
she or he is unable to produce the required
amount of urine.
Stanford football tailback Kevin Scott who took
the urine drug test along with other members of
the team prior to the Gator Bowl said he found
the experience "a little embarrassing" and added
that some players had to "drink juice and wait
around for about half an hour" until they could
complete the test.
"If a football player found (the test) degrading
and humiliating, any woman athlete would find it
much worse," asserted Harriman.
LeVant refused in October to sign the consent
form requiring her to take the drug test and was
subsequently barred from competing this year.
So far she has missed one meet in November and
one currently underway in Texas and has placed
her athletic scholarship in jeopardy, she said.
LeVant said she decided to approach the ACLU
with her case because she felt "(drug testing) was
wrong. There are invasion of privacy laws, and I
thought that something could be done.
"A lot of people didn't think they had a course
of action," she said, explaining what she thinks
motivates other athletes to acquiesce to the test.
She added that many people also do not have the
money or time and are not willing to make the
sacrifices that a lawsuit demands.
LeVant is optimistic about the outcome of the
case. "I don't know much about law, but obvi-
ously the ACLU would not be inter
ested if (the suit) didn't have a
chance."
Drug testing rules of other organiza
tions have been challenged in court
before, according to Harriman, and
most of those cases have been success
ful. "Simone has a pretty good case,"
she said.
LeVant said she is against drug abuse
but "not at the expense of people's in

dividual rights."
LeVant said she had spoken to Stan
ford Athletic Director Andy Geiger and
Faculty Athletic Representative Jack
Friedenthal before approaching the
ACLU, but both men said they could
not do anything to help her.
The Athletic Department refused to
comment about the LeVant case, but in
the past, both Geiger and Friedenthal
have been outspoken in their dislike of
the drug testing rule.
Only 13 out of 78 schools in the
NCAA's major conference do not have
their own drug testing program
