## Husky Washington next challenge for Stanford 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
The schedule says that Stanford has
already played two Pacific 10 Confer
ence basketball games at Maples
Pavilion, but the Cardinal's real Pac-10
home opener comes tonight, when it
meets Washington at 7:35. The Huskies
are currently tied for the Pac-10 lead
with Washington State at 2-0. Stanford
is tied for fourth at 2-2.
In its first two league home games,
Stanford played without two of the pri
mary home-court advantages — a band
and a boisterous student section —
while beating Oregon on Dec. 21 and
losing to Oregon State two days later.
The Cardinal then split road games in
Los Angeles, topping USC last Monday
after being pummeled by UCLA the
previous Friday.
"I would rather have not had games
then (during winter break), but we had
to get them in with the conference
tournament (March 5-8)," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
Montgomery, who was accustomed
to rabid student backing during his
eight years at Montana, is looking for
similar support from Stanford fans. "I
hope the students come out and see
what this team is all about," he said.
Second-year Washington Coach
Andy Russo remembers his first trip to
Maples Pavilion well. In that game, a
70-69 Husky win, one Stanford backer
tried to use seismology to help the
Cardinal by bouncing on Maples'
flexible floor.
"We've got to make sure that big fat
guy under the basket isn't there to
stomp up and down and shake the
floor when we're on the foul line,"
Russo said. "That's the first guy I'll be
looking for."
The second guy Russo will likely be
seeking is Stanford forward Todd
Lichti. The 6-foot-4 sophomore leads
the Cardinal in scoring (17.2 points per
game), field goal percentage (53 per
cent), free throw percentage (84 per
cent) and minutes played (32 minutes
per game). Lichti is also second on the
team in rebounding and assists, trailing
center Howard Wright in the former

category and point guard Terry Taylor
in the latter.
According to Montgomery, Stan
ford's main problem has been incon
sistency, but one area in which the

Cardinal has generally performed well
is shooting. Stanford is hitting 49 per
cent of its shots from the floor, and not

threat heading into tonight's game with Washington.
