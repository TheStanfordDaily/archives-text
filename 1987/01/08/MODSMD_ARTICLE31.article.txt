# Wrestlers battle to a tie
## McIntyre remains undefeated at 6-0-0 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Of the six individual matches in yesterday's dual meet
between the Stanford and Simon-Fraser wrestling teams,
the Cardinal won five, but the performance was only
good for a 23 23 tie at Maples Pavilion.
Almost as much scoring occurred off of the mat as on
yesterday. Four of the 10 weight divisions were forfeited
— three by Stanford. Still, the Cardinal turned an almost
certain loss into a near-victory.
"I didn't think we had a chance," Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel said. "My team wrestled extremely well."
Horpel's team has been lacking a 118-pound wrestler
all season, and against Simon-Fraser, once again, the
Cardinal had to forfeit in the lightest weight division.
Horpel indicated that throughout his nine-year coaching
stint at Stanford he has had trouble finding athletes to
wrestle in the 118 class.
"Each year I've been recruiting lots of 118-pounders,
but we just haven't had any accepted," said Horpel,
noting that walk-ons have not been able to fill the void
either. "For us, it's just a weight class that's too small."
Illness and injury forced the Cardinal to forfeit in the

126- and 150-pound divisions, also, against Simon-Fraser.
Freshman John Lisle, Stanford's regular at 126, has been
battling the flu and was unable to compete yesterday.
Lisle will also miss the Doc Petersen Open Saturday in
Chico.
Scott Wiggen, an All-America at 150, suffered a rib in
jury last Saturday against Oregon State. He, too, will miss
Saturday's tournament. "It's not a serious injury. It's
about a week recovery time," Horpel said, predicting
that Wiggen will be ready for next Thursday's home
match against Humboldt State.
Stanford's wrestlers who were able to compete yester
day performed in a near-perfect fashion.
The Cardinal picked up a win in the 134-pound divi
sion when Brian Veit decisioned Simon-Fraser's Brad
Fawcett, 6-2. Geoff Baum of Stanford won by forfeit at
142, and Steve Yarbrough (158) decisioned Chris Wilson,
7-2.
Eric Harber was the only Stanford wrestler in action
yesterday to lose. Harber was decisioned 14-5 by Simon-
Fraser's Jeff Marsh in the 167-pound match.

Stanford's Brian Veit found all the leaks in Brad Fawcett's game as he decisioned the Simon-Fraser wrestler 6-2
yesterday in the 134-pound match at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal continued to do well in
the upper weight classes. Ron Perry
(177) outpointed Scott Bianco, 11-6. In
the 190-pound division, Stanford's
Terry Mclntyre upped his dual-meet

record to 6-0-0 with a 13-4 thrashing of
John McDonald. Heavyweight Kurt Kas
sulke also recorded a victory for the
Cardinal, easily decisioning David
Benetau, 13-2.
The tie pushed Stanford's overall
record to 1-4-1. In matches with
Simon-Fraser over the years, the Card
inal is now 1-1-1.
Horpel was more than pleased with

the tie, considering the circumstances.
"Tying is a nice fringe benefit," he said.
"I'm not really working on winning
dual meets because of the forfeits."
Horpel's squad should be back at
full strength for the dual meet with
Humboldt. The 4:30 p.m. match has
been moved from Maples to Roble
Gym.

Horpel was more than pleased with

the tie, considering the circumstances.
"Tying is a nice fringe benefit," he said.
"I'm not really working on winning
dual meets because of the forfeits."
Horpel's squad should be back at
full strength for the dual meet with
Humboldt. The 4:30 p.m. match has
been moved from Maples to Roble
Gym.
