# Paye's stay: from All-USA to dismay
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
This wasn't the way the storybook was
supposed to end.
The Stanford Cardinal was in Jacksonville, Fla.,
for the Gator Bowl, its first postseason appear
ance in eight years. Quarterback John Paye wasn't
there.
Paye was in Grass Valley with his grandparents,
watching the game on television. And a boyhood
dream of leading the Cardinal onto the field of a
bowl game was left unfulfilled when he under
went surgery on his right shoulder five days ear
lier.
Paye had developed bone spurs on his right
shoulder that required a half-inch to be shaved
off his collarbone, and also had a rotator cuff in
jury that needed arthroscopic surgery. A three
inch scar on top of his shoulder and the dreams
of what might have been are reminders of the op
eration.
Paye took a hit in the third quarter of the last
game of the regular season against Arizona in
Tokyo and was forced to give way to sophomore
Greg Ennis when he couldn't continue. The next
day, Paye couldn't lift his arm above his head.
With two weeks off before practice resumed for
the Gator Bowl, Paye had hoped the pain would
subside and he would be able to throw again.
Paye saw four doctors in that time. An or
thogram (X-ray with injected dye) proved incon
clusive. Four doctors, four concurring opinions.
"It was the same deal,'' Paye said. "They told me
I'd have to have surgery to clean out the joint and
do an arthroscope on the rotator cuff.
"No doctor was going to tell me I couldn't play.
I knew the decision was up to me. All the doctors,
my family, the people around me wanted me to
play. I wanted to play. But there was no avoiding 1
had to have surgery to see how bad it was. I felt it
would be stupid to keep throwing if my shoulder
continued to hurt every time I threw."
The injury dated back to last year's game at
USC, when Paye suffered a partially separated
shoulder in a 30-6 loss. But Paye surprised every
one when he returned the next week to spark a
21-point second-half comeback to beat No. 19
Arizona 28-17. He didn't miss a game all season.
Paye underwent minor surgery over the sum
mer, but doctors told him he would have no
problem during the season. There had been talk
of redshirting this year, but it wasn't publicized.
And when, with Paye at the helm, Stanford
opened 4-0 for the first time since 1952, it ap
peared the injury was as much a part of the past as
losing Stanford football seasons.

It wasn't. Against California, Pave was unable to
throw deep consistently, and an abysmal effort by
the Cardinal gave the 1-9 Bears the biggest upset
in Big Game history by a 17-11 count. The next
week against Arizona, Pave pulled himself in the
third quarter and let Ennis finish up the 28-23 vic
tory.
And it was Ennis who came up short against
Clemson in the 27-21 defeat. Pave could do noth
ing but look on, unable even to fly to Jacksonville
to be on the sideline because of a reaction to the
anesthesia that had him in bed for two days and
feeling sick for a week.
"1 was very upset," Paye said. "I started to think
there was a problem at the beginning of the
season, and I complained to the doctors that the
arm hurt. I was thinking about redshirting, but 1
was told by the team doctors that it was all right
— I'd experience pain, but I wouldn't do any
more damage. It turned out I had a problem with
the AC joint.
"I was very hesitant to go into the season with a
banged-up shoulder. I didn't want to do more
damage to my arm. All throughout my athletic
career I heard 'Don't throw with a sore arm.' "
By the time he finished high school at Menlo
School in his hometown of Atherton, that athletic
career and that right arm had brought him na
tional attention. He was named Offensive Player
of the Year by USA Today, Quarterback of the
Year by Blue Chips Magazine, first-team All-
America by Parade Magazine and USA Today.
And he was going just a few miles down El
Camino Real to play football for Stanford. He had
a 3.75 GPA at Menlo, a well-respected prep
school. His father, John, had played football at
Stanford 20 years earlier. And John Paye Jr. was
ready to succeed the graduated John Elway and
continue the tradition of great Stanford quarter
backs.
"Once I signed the letter of intent with Stan
ford," Paye said, "I went to all the spring
practices. I wanted to pick up the offense as
quickly as I could. I spent all summer working
out with the players. I wanted to start. And after
three games, I beat out Steve Cottrell."
Cottrell was a good backup to Elway for three
years, and in 1983 he became the backup to Paye
until an ankle injury ended his season. Paye
started the final eight games, played all of the final
four and completed 51 percent of his passes for
1,941 yards, almost four times as many as Elway
had as a freshman.
But the team was a different story. A win over
No. 19 Arizona was the only one in a 1-10 season,
the worst in Stanford history. But Paye wasn't dis
couraged.

"The class 1 came in with had a lot of talented
players," he said. "The heart of the team this year
was my class and Dave Wyman's class (redshirts
from the previous year). I knew we'd be good. I
had no second thought about it."
Paye's sophomore year was his most injury
plagued. First, he broke the index finger of his
throwing hand when he hit a helmet in the Card
inal's fourth game against Arizona State. Return
ing five weeks later against USC, Paye was tackled
out-of-bounds and suffered a strained tendon that
caused him to miss the next game. He returned
off the bench against Cal, coming in with Stanford
trailing 10-0 and leading the Cardinal to a 27-10
victory. Paye finished completing 52 percent of
his passes for only 848 yards in six games.

Paye's 1985 season proved his best. He com
pleted a school record 67 percent of his passes
for 2,589 yards, an average of 235 yards per game.
He threw for over 300 yards in three games, in
cluding a 408-yard effort against Oregon, third
best in Stanford history. And he didn't miss a
game despite the shoulder separation against
use.
In 1986, Paye completed 62 percent of his
passes for 2,261 yards in leading the Cardinal to
its first bowl game in eight years and an 8-3
regular-season record. He finished second in
career passing yardage with 7,669 yards, behind
only Elway. He is also second to Elway with 715

completions in 1,198 attempts.
Paye's athletic activity wasn't over when football season
ended. An All-State basketball point guard at Menlo, Paye
became only the second player in NCAA Division I to start as
a freshman in football and basketball, sharing the position
with sophomore Keith Ramee. Paye started 33 games in
three years, finishing his career with a modest 4.0 points
per-game scoring average.
The only thing he didn't do in athletics at Stanford was
play baseball. Out of high school Paye had been drafted by
the San Francisco Giants but knew his future lay in football.
Paye's goals were modest coming to Stanford. "Probably
to go to the Rose Bowl," he said. "Other than that, all I was
trying to do was improve every day to become the best
quarterback I could be. I want to play pro football. My
whole experience here has been good. I've been able to
play football and basketball — my two favorite sports — at
the major college level."
But playing a varsity sport every quarter has had its draw
backs. Apart from being a member of the Theta Delta Chi
house, Paye hasn't had much opportunity to experience
Stanford off the field or out of the classroom, where he has
maintained a 3.01 GPA in economics.
"I'm kind of excited," he said. "These will be the first two
quarters I'll have no other commitments besides school. I
want to take some classes where I have to put in some time
and study some exciting things."

Paye was selected for the East-West Shrine Game to be
played at Stanford Stadium on Saturday and is participating
in many of the charitable activities that the college all-star
teams are, like a visit Tuesday to the Shriners' Hospital for
seriously burned children.
Like most seniors as graduation draws nearer, Paye said
he'll think well of his time at Stanford. "The biggest thing is
the community-type atmosphere," he said. "Everyone is
here to help you. I haven't met too many teachers that have
been unfair. They do everything they can to help students. I
think that just goes along with the athletic program. I think
the perfect example is when a player has a career-ending in
jury, he's still on scholarship."
Paye said his academic career may include business or
law school after getting his bachelor's degree, "but that's at
least two years down the road. All along, I've prepared for
life after football. I've been able to go to good schools. I'll
have a degree from Stanford, but this season makes me
think about that as right now. It makes me really appreciate
the sport a lot more. I'll really miss it when I'm not able to
play again."
Paye was spoken of as a first-round choice in the National
Football League draft after his junior season, before the in
jury. "It hurt me quite a lot, I feel," he said. "There are a lot
of doubts about my arm. The only thing I'm worried about
is having the shoulder heal so I'm able to throw without
pain. I'm not really worried about where I'll be drafted, just
rehabilitating the shoulder and being able to throw. I think
if I'm able to do that, I'll be able to compete for a job. I have
confidence."
And hope that the end to this chapter isn't the end of the
story.

The Stanford Cardinal was in Jacksonville, Fla.,
for the Gator Bowl, its first postseason appear
ance in eight years. Quarterback John Paye wasn't
there.
Paye was in Grass Valley with his grandparents,
watching the game on television. And a boyhood
dream of leading the Cardinal onto the field of a
bowl game was left unfulfilled when he under
went surgery on his right shoulder five days ear
lier.
Paye had developed bone spurs on his right
shoulder that required a half-inch to be shaved
off his collarbone, and also had a rotator cuff in
jury that needed arthroscopic surgery. A three
inch scar on top of his shoulder and the dreams
of what might have been are reminders of the op
eration.
Paye took a hit in the third quarter of the last
game of the regular season against Arizona in
Tokyo and was forced to give way to sophomore
Greg Ennis when he couldn't continue. The next
day, Paye couldn't lift his arm above his head.
With two weeks off before practice resumed for
the Gator Bowl, Paye had hoped the pain would
subside and he would be able to throw again.
Paye saw four doctors in that time. An or
thogram (X-ray with injected dye) proved incon
clusive. Four doctors, four concurring opinions.
"It was the same deal,'' Paye said. "They told me
I'd have to have surgery to clean out the joint and
do an arthroscope on the rotator cuff.
"No doctor was going to tell me I couldn't play.
I knew the decision was up to me. All the doctors,
my family, the people around me wanted me to
play. I wanted to play. But there was no avoiding 1
had to have surgery to see how bad it was. I felt it
would be stupid to keep throwing if my shoulder
continued to hurt every time I threw."
The injury dated back to last year's game at
USC, when Paye suffered a partially separated
shoulder in a 30-6 loss. But Paye surprised every
one when he returned the next week to spark a
21-point second-half comeback to beat No. 19
Arizona 28-17. He didn't miss a game all season.
Paye underwent minor surgery over the sum
mer, but doctors told him he would have no
problem during the season. There had been talk
of redshirting this year, but it wasn't publicized.
And when, with Paye at the helm, Stanford
opened 4-0 for the first time since 1952, it ap
peared the injury was as much a part of the past as
losing Stanford football seasons.

It wasn't. Against California, Pave was unable to
throw deep consistently, and an abysmal effort by
the Cardinal gave the 1-9 Bears the biggest upset
in Big Game history by a 17-11 count. The next
week against Arizona, Pave pulled himself in the
third quarter and let Ennis finish up the 28-23 vic
tory.
And it was Ennis who came up short against
Clemson in the 27-21 defeat. Pave could do noth
ing but look on, unable even to fly to Jacksonville
to be on the sideline because of a reaction to the
anesthesia that had him in bed for two days and
feeling sick for a week.
"1 was very upset," Paye said. "I started to think
there was a problem at the beginning of the
season, and I complained to the doctors that the
arm hurt. I was thinking about redshirting, but 1
was told by the team doctors that it was all right
— I'd experience pain, but I wouldn't do any
more damage. It turned out I had a problem with
the AC joint.
"I was very hesitant to go into the season with a
banged-up shoulder. I didn't want to do more
damage to my arm. All throughout my athletic
career I heard 'Don't throw with a sore arm.' "
By the time he finished high school at Menlo
School in his hometown of Atherton, that athletic
career and that right arm had brought him na
tional attention. He was named Offensive Player
of the Year by USA Today, Quarterback of the
Year by Blue Chips Magazine, first-team All-
America by Parade Magazine and USA Today.
And he was going just a few miles down El
Camino Real to play football for Stanford. He had
a 3.75 GPA at Menlo, a well-respected prep
school. His father, John, had played football at
Stanford 20 years earlier. And John Paye Jr. was
ready to succeed the graduated John Elway and
continue the tradition of great Stanford quarter
backs.
"Once I signed the letter of intent with Stan
ford," Paye said, "I went to all the spring
practices. I wanted to pick up the offense as
quickly as I could. I spent all summer working
out with the players. I wanted to start. And after
three games, I beat out Steve Cottrell."
Cottrell was a good backup to Elway for three
years, and in 1983 he became the backup to Paye
until an ankle injury ended his season. Paye
started the final eight games, played all of the final
four and completed 51 percent of his passes for
1,941 yards, almost four times as many as Elway
had as a freshman.
But the team was a different story. A win over
No. 19 Arizona was the only one in a 1-10 season,
the worst in Stanford history. But Paye wasn't dis
couraged.

"The class 1 came in with had a lot of talented
players," he said. "The heart of the team this year
was my class and Dave Wyman's class (redshirts
from the previous year). I knew we'd be good. I
had no second thought about it."
Paye's sophomore year was his most injury
plagued. First, he broke the index finger of his
throwing hand when he hit a helmet in the Card
inal's fourth game against Arizona State. Return
ing five weeks later against USC, Paye was tackled
out-of-bounds and suffered a strained tendon that
caused him to miss the next game. He returned
off the bench against Cal, coming in with Stanford
trailing 10-0 and leading the Cardinal to a 27-10
victory. Paye finished completing 52 percent of
his passes for only 848 yards in six games.

Paye's 1985 season proved his best. He com
pleted a school record 67 percent of his passes
for 2,589 yards, an average of 235 yards per game.
He threw for over 300 yards in three games, in
cluding a 408-yard effort against Oregon, third
best in Stanford history. And he didn't miss a
game despite the shoulder separation against
use.
In 1986, Paye completed 62 percent of his
passes for 2,261 yards in leading the Cardinal to
its first bowl game in eight years and an 8-3
regular-season record. He finished second in
career passing yardage with 7,669 yards, behind
only Elway. He is also second to Elway with 715

years on the Farm, the Stanford quarterback said, "My whole experience here has been good."
completions in 1,198 attempts.
Paye's athletic activity wasn't over when football season
ended. An All-State basketball point guard at Menlo, Paye
became only the second player in NCAA Division I to start as
a freshman in football and basketball, sharing the position
with sophomore Keith Ramee. Paye started 33 games in
three years, finishing his career with a modest 4.0 points
per-game scoring average.
The only thing he didn't do in athletics at Stanford was
play baseball. Out of high school Paye had been drafted by
the San Francisco Giants but knew his future lay in football.
Paye's goals were modest coming to Stanford. "Probably
to go to the Rose Bowl," he said. "Other than that, all I was
trying to do was improve every day to become the best
quarterback I could be. I want to play pro football. My
whole experience here has been good. I've been able to
play football and basketball — my two favorite sports — at
the major college level."
But playing a varsity sport every quarter has had its draw
backs. Apart from being a member of the Theta Delta Chi
house, Paye hasn't had much opportunity to experience
Stanford off the field or out of the classroom, where he has
maintained a 3.01 GPA in economics.
"I'm kind of excited," he said. "These will be the first two
quarters I'll have no other commitments besides school. I
want to take some classes where I have to put in some time
and study some exciting things."

Paye was selected for the East-West Shrine Game to be
played at Stanford Stadium on Saturday and is participating
in many of the charitable activities that the college all-star
teams are, like a visit Tuesday to the Shriners' Hospital for
seriously burned children.
Like most seniors as graduation draws nearer, Paye said
he'll think well of his time at Stanford. "The biggest thing is
the community-type atmosphere," he said. "Everyone is
here to help you. I haven't met too many teachers that have
been unfair. They do everything they can to help students. I
think that just goes along with the athletic program. I think
the perfect example is when a player has a career-ending in
jury, he's still on scholarship."
Paye said his academic career may include business or
law school after getting his bachelor's degree, "but that's at
least two years down the road. All along, I've prepared for
life after football. I've been able to go to good schools. I'll
have a degree from Stanford, but this season makes me
think about that as right now. It makes me really appreciate
the sport a lot more. I'll really miss it when I'm not able to
play again."
Paye was spoken of as a first-round choice in the National
Football League draft after his junior season, before the in
jury. "It hurt me quite a lot, I feel," he said. "There are a lot
of doubts about my arm. The only thing I'm worried about
is having the shoulder heal so I'm able to throw without
pain. I'm not really worried about where I'll be drafted, just
rehabilitating the shoulder and being able to throw. I think
if I'm able to do that, I'll be able to compete for a job. I have
confidence."
And hope that the end to this chapter isn't the end of the
story.

ance in eight years. Quarterback John Paye wasn't
there.
Paye was in Grass Valley with his grandparents,
watching the game on television. And a boyhood
dream of leading the Cardinal onto the field of a
bowl game was left unfulfilled when he under
went surgery on his right shoulder five days ear
lier.
Paye had developed bone spurs on his right
shoulder that required a half-inch to be shaved
off his collarbone, and also had a rotator cuff in
jury that needed arthroscopic surgery. A three
inch scar on top of his shoulder and the dreams
of what might have been are reminders of the op
eration.
Paye took a hit in the third quarter of the last
game of the regular season against Arizona in
Tokyo and was forced to give way to sophomore
Greg Ennis when he couldn't continue. The next
day, Paye couldn't lift his arm above his head.
With two weeks off before practice resumed for
the Gator Bowl, Paye had hoped the pain would
subside and he would be able to throw again.
Paye saw four doctors in that time. An or
thogram (X-ray with injected dye) proved incon
clusive. Four doctors, four concurring opinions.
"It was the same deal,'' Paye said. "They told me
I'd have to have surgery to clean out the joint and
do an arthroscope on the rotator cuff.
"No doctor was going to tell me I couldn't play.
I knew the decision was up to me. All the doctors,
my family, the people around me wanted me to
play. I wanted to play. But there was no avoiding 1
had to have surgery to see how bad it was. I felt it
would be stupid to keep throwing if my shoulder
continued to hurt every time I threw."
The injury dated back to last year's game at
USC, when Paye suffered a partially separated
shoulder in a 30-6 loss. But Paye surprised every
one when he returned the next week to spark a
21-point second-half comeback to beat No. 19
Arizona 28-17. He didn't miss a game all season.
Paye underwent minor surgery over the sum
mer, but doctors told him he would have no
problem during the season. There had been talk
of redshirting this year, but it wasn't publicized.
And when, with Paye at the helm, Stanford
opened 4-0 for the first time since 1952, it ap
peared the injury was as much a part of the past as
losing Stanford football seasons.

It wasn't. Against California, Pave was unable to
throw deep consistently, and an abysmal effort by
the Cardinal gave the 1-9 Bears the biggest upset
in Big Game history by a 17-11 count. The next
week against Arizona, Pave pulled himself in the
third quarter and let Ennis finish up the 28-23 vic
tory.
And it was Ennis who came up short against
Clemson in the 27-21 defeat. Pave could do noth
ing but look on, unable even to fly to Jacksonville
to be on the sideline because of a reaction to the
anesthesia that had him in bed for two days and
feeling sick for a week.
"1 was very upset," Paye said. "I started to think
there was a problem at the beginning of the
season, and I complained to the doctors that the
arm hurt. I was thinking about redshirting, but 1
was told by the team doctors that it was all right
— I'd experience pain, but I wouldn't do any
more damage. It turned out I had a problem with
the AC joint.
"I was very hesitant to go into the season with a
banged-up shoulder. I didn't want to do more
damage to my arm. All throughout my athletic
career I heard 'Don't throw with a sore arm.' "
By the time he finished high school at Menlo
School in his hometown of Atherton, that athletic
career and that right arm had brought him na
tional attention. He was named Offensive Player
of the Year by USA Today, Quarterback of the
Year by Blue Chips Magazine, first-team All-
America by Parade Magazine and USA Today.
And he was going just a few miles down El
Camino Real to play football for Stanford. He had
a 3.75 GPA at Menlo, a well-respected prep
school. His father, John, had played football at
Stanford 20 years earlier. And John Paye Jr. was
ready to succeed the graduated John Elway and
continue the tradition of great Stanford quarter
backs.
"Once I signed the letter of intent with Stan
ford," Paye said, "I went to all the spring
practices. I wanted to pick up the offense as
quickly as I could. I spent all summer working
out with the players. I wanted to start. And after
three games, I beat out Steve Cottrell."
Cottrell was a good backup to Elway for three
years, and in 1983 he became the backup to Paye
until an ankle injury ended his season. Paye
started the final eight games, played all of the final
four and completed 51 percent of his passes for
1,941 yards, almost four times as many as Elway
had as a freshman.
But the team was a different story. A win over
No. 19 Arizona was the only one in a 1-10 season,
the worst in Stanford history. But Paye wasn't dis
couraged.

"The class 1 came in with had a lot of talented
players," he said. "The heart of the team this year
was my class and Dave Wyman's class (redshirts
from the previous year). I knew we'd be good. I
had no second thought about it."
Paye's sophomore year was his most injury
plagued. First, he broke the index finger of his
throwing hand when he hit a helmet in the Card
inal's fourth game against Arizona State. Return
ing five weeks later against USC, Paye was tackled
out-of-bounds and suffered a strained tendon that
caused him to miss the next game. He returned
off the bench against Cal, coming in with Stanford
trailing 10-0 and leading the Cardinal to a 27-10
victory. Paye finished completing 52 percent of
his passes for only 848 yards in six games.

Paye's 1985 season proved his best. He com
pleted a school record 67 percent of his passes
for 2,589 yards, an average of 235 yards per game.
He threw for over 300 yards in three games, in
cluding a 408-yard effort against Oregon, third
best in Stanford history. And he didn't miss a
game despite the shoulder separation against
use.
In 1986, Paye completed 62 percent of his
passes for 2,261 yards in leading the Cardinal to
its first bowl game in eight years and an 8-3
regular-season record. He finished second in
career passing yardage with 7,669 yards, behind
only Elway. He is also second to Elway with 715

years on the Farm, the Stanford quarterback said, "My whole experience here has been good."
completions in 1,198 attempts.
Paye's athletic activity wasn't over when football season
ended. An All-State basketball point guard at Menlo, Paye
became only the second player in NCAA Division I to start as
a freshman in football and basketball, sharing the position
with sophomore Keith Ramee. Paye started 33 games in
three years, finishing his career with a modest 4.0 points
per-game scoring average.
The only thing he didn't do in athletics at Stanford was
play baseball. Out of high school Paye had been drafted by
the San Francisco Giants but knew his future lay in football.
Paye's goals were modest coming to Stanford. "Probably
to go to the Rose Bowl," he said. "Other than that, all I was
trying to do was improve every day to become the best
quarterback I could be. I want to play pro football. My
whole experience here has been good. I've been able to
play football and basketball — my two favorite sports — at
the major college level."
But playing a varsity sport every quarter has had its draw
backs. Apart from being a member of the Theta Delta Chi
house, Paye hasn't had much opportunity to experience
Stanford off the field or out of the classroom, where he has
maintained a 3.01 GPA in economics.
"I'm kind of excited," he said. "These will be the first two
quarters I'll have no other commitments besides school. I
want to take some classes where I have to put in some time
and study some exciting things."

Paye was selected for the East-West Shrine Game to be
played at Stanford Stadium on Saturday and is participating
in many of the charitable activities that the college all-star
teams are, like a visit Tuesday to the Shriners' Hospital for
seriously burned children.
Like most seniors as graduation draws nearer, Paye said
he'll think well of his time at Stanford. "The biggest thing is
the community-type atmosphere," he said. "Everyone is
here to help you. I haven't met too many teachers that have
been unfair. They do everything they can to help students. I
think that just goes along with the athletic program. I think
the perfect example is when a player has a career-ending in
jury, he's still on scholarship."
Paye said his academic career may include business or
law school after getting his bachelor's degree, "but that's at
least two years down the road. All along, I've prepared for
life after football. I've been able to go to good schools. I'll
have a degree from Stanford, but this season makes me
think about that as right now. It makes me really appreciate
the sport a lot more. I'll really miss it when I'm not able to
play again."
Paye was spoken of as a first-round choice in the National
Football League draft after his junior season, before the in
jury. "It hurt me quite a lot, I feel," he said. "There are a lot
of doubts about my arm. The only thing I'm worried about
is having the shoulder heal so I'm able to throw without
pain. I'm not really worried about where I'll be drafted, just
rehabilitating the shoulder and being able to throw. I think
if I'm able to do that, I'll be able to compete for a job. I have
confidence."
And hope that the end to this chapter isn't the end of the
story.
