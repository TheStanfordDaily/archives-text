## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
The Lady Aztec marks the
beginning of the sparse winter
season for the Stanford women's
golf team. After yesterday's first
round of play, the Cardinal finds
itself in a fifth-place tie with
Arizona State at 316.
San Jose State shot a sizzling
299 to lead the tournament. USC
is a full 10 strokes off the lead at
309. U.S. International University
trails the Trojans by a stroke, and
San Diego State, the host school,
is next with a score of 312.
Stanford senior Kathleen
McCarthy, coming off a victory in
the Cardinal's last tournament
— the USIU Intercollegiate Nov.
17-19 — struggled to an
opening-round 80 yesterday.
The top individual perfor
mances for Stanford came from
junior Kay Cornelius and sopho
more Clare Dolan, who both
fired 775. Despite being only
four shots off the lead, the two
have 10 players ahead of them at
76 or better.
Dana Lofiand and Anne Jones
of SJSU share the individual lead
with Cathy Mockett of USC and
Pam Wright of ASU at 73. Karen
Engberg shot 74 and is alone in
fifth place.
Cardinal senior Adrienne Gil
martin and junior Trish
McGonigle will be trying to
rebound in today's second
round. As did McCarthy, the pair
suffered through a tough
opening round, each finishing at
82.
