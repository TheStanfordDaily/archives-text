# Stanford at Washington in key Pac-10 matchup
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
The conference season is barely un
derway, yet the Stanford women's bas
ketball team has already reached a cri
tical juncture in its schedule.
Tonight in Seattle the Cardinal will
square off against the Washington
Huskies in a conference showdown
with definite postseason ramifications.
The 8-2 Huskies currently share
second place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence with a 1-0 mark. With a win over
UCLA and a loss to USC last week, Stan
ford (7-4 overall) has posted a 1-1 con
ference mark and shares the fourth
spot in the Pac-10 with three other
teams.

More than likely, at least the top two
teams from the league will reccivc
NCAA tournament bids. Depending on
overall records, a third or even fourth
team may receive an invitation for
postseason action.
Washington boasts a fine offensive
attack and outstanding rebounding
ability. Forwards Yvette Cole and Lisa
Oriard are the two primary reasons the
Huskies this year lead the conference
in margin of victory (19.7 points) and
rebounding (12.7).
Cole averages 15.4 points a game for
Washington, including a career-high 27
points last Wednesday against Okla
homa as the Huskies upset the No. 21
Sooners in the championship game of

the Seattle Times Classic. The 6-foot-1
Oriard has pitched in a hefty 14.6
points an outing this year.
According to Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer, the Cardinal's inside play
has lacked consistency this season, so it
may find it difficult matching the inside
strength of the Huskies.
This task will fall mostly on the
shoulders of 6-0 freshman Katy Steding
who has certainly been no disappoint
ment this season.
Steding leads the team in rebound
ing at a clip of 8.3 boards per game.
And at 10.5 points a contest, she is also
one of three Cardinal players scoring
in double figures this year.
