# Card swimmers endure holiday pain and cheer
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
While a majority of the Stanford student body played
board games with relatives and organized New Year's
Eve carpools for holiday spirits, the Cardinal men's swim
team endured a week-long stretch of high-intensity
workouts where eating, breathing, sleeping and, of
course, swimming were the popular activities.
Affectionately referred to as "uninterrupted training"
by Stanford Coach Skip Kenney, the workout regimen
commenced bright and early on Dec. 27. From then on,
the team came to know chlorine and pain well.
"It's really survival the first couple days, a time when
we come together as a team and get our butts kicked,"
senior Pablo Morales said. "It gives Skip the opportunity
to let off some steam. He's antsy to get at us."
"I look forward to Christmas training," Kenney ad
mitted. "I get the chance to dream up some new things
to really challenge the swimmers."
For the first few days, the time when Kenney
determines who's been bad and who's been good during
the abbreviated break, the swimmers are, indeed, tested.
"Easily the most intense work I've ever had," freshman
Ricky Gould said. "By the end of the week, I was abso
lutely dead."
The Christmas training session is truly a rare bird. In a
completely unique, temporal situation, the team has no
other commitments besides everyday, physiological
functions. There is no place to hide from Skip Kenney.
"Skip's pushy, but you got to have that," senior Jeff
Kostoff said. "He makes sure that there are no other op
tions available. When there's no options, you might as
well make the best of it."
Freshman Hank Wise, like the others, was unduly im
pressed by the water workouts. "By far and away, it was
the hardest I've ever worked at anything. You go to the
pool, and it's your business."

As one might expect, the early wake-up call raised the
loudest groans. "Kurt Kroesche and I would get up at
around 6:30, and we wouldn't say anything to each other
for about an hour. We sat there (at the breakfast table).
We wouldn't talk,'' Wise recalled. "You wake up about a
half an hour through practice."
Practice promptly started in DeGuerre Pool at 7:30
a.m. and ended at 10 a.m., about which time the swim
mers retired to one of the eating and sleeping daytime
intervals. Before long, the team was back for another two
to three hours in the afternoon, this time swimming
various and sundry intervals. The squad also lifted
eights on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday.
The most spectacular of all the swimming drills was
the annual New Year's Day 5,000-meter swim, the equiva
lent of one hour's worth of high-intensity, timed swim
ming. The post-New Year's Eve event was won by junior
backstroker Sean Murphy.
Despite the emphasis on conditioning, the No. 1 goal
is "developing the team chemistry and unity," Kenney
said. "The fact that the team cares about each other
outside the pool is what is more important. It's a chance
to learn about the guys on the team."
"1 really got a lot closer to the team," Wise said. "It's
really an intense time to get together with the guys,
become a team, as it were."
On the final evening, the men's and women's teams
joined forces for a Gong Show. Top acts included a per
formance by the freshmen on the men's team, who sang
"The 10 Days of Training." Captains Sam McAdam, Kos
toff and Morales delighted onlookers with a sparkling
rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen while
Kroesche and Wise conducted an impromptu interview
on the "missing link," as played by Wise, who sported a
Speedo and monkey mask.
"The captains did a great job this year," Kenney said.
"The best Christmas training we've had. It's amazing how
much they look forward to so much pain."

"It's really survival the first couple days, a time when
we come together as a team and get our butts kicked,"
senior Pablo Morales said. "It gives Skip the opportunity
to let off some steam. He's antsy to get at us."
"I look forward to Christmas training," Kenney ad
mitted. "I get the chance to dream up some new things
to really challenge the swimmers."
For the first few days, the time when Kenney
determines who's been bad and who's been good during
the abbreviated break, the swimmers are, indeed, tested.
"Easily the most intense work I've ever had," freshman
Ricky Gould said. "By the end of the week, I was abso
lutely dead."
The Christmas training session is truly a rare bird. In a
completely unique, temporal situation, the team has no
other commitments besides everyday, physiological
functions. There is no place to hide from Skip Kenney.
"Skip's pushy, but you got to have that," senior Jeff
Kostoff said. "He makes sure that there are no other op
tions available. When there's no options, you might as
well make the best of it."
Freshman Hank Wise, like the others, was unduly im
pressed by the water workouts. "By far and away, it was
the hardest I've ever worked at anything. You go to the
pool, and it's your business."

As one might expect, the early wake-up call raised the
loudest groans. "Kurt Kroesche and I would get up at
around 6:30, and we wouldn't say anything to each other
for about an hour. We sat there (at the breakfast table).
We wouldn't talk,'' Wise recalled. "You wake up about a
half an hour through practice."
Practice promptly started in DeGuerre Pool at 7:30
a.m. and ended at 10 a.m., about which time the swim
mers retired to one of the eating and sleeping daytime
intervals. Before long, the team was back for another two
to three hours in the afternoon, this time swimming
various and sundry intervals. The squad also lifted
eights on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday.
The most spectacular of all the swimming drills was
the annual New Year's Day 5,000-meter swim, the equiva
lent of one hour's worth of high-intensity, timed swim
ming. The post-New Year's Eve event was won by junior
backstroker Sean Murphy.
Despite the emphasis on conditioning, the No. 1 goal
is "developing the team chemistry and unity," Kenney
said. "The fact that the team cares about each other
outside the pool is what is more important. It's a chance
to learn about the guys on the team."
"1 really got a lot closer to the team," Wise said. "It's
really an intense time to get together with the guys,
become a team, as it were."
On the final evening, the men's and women's teams
joined forces for a Gong Show. Top acts included a per
formance by the freshmen on the men's team, who sang
"The 10 Days of Training." Captains Sam McAdam, Kos
toff and Morales delighted onlookers with a sparkling
rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen while
Kroesche and Wise conducted an impromptu interview
on the "missing link," as played by Wise, who sported a
Speedo and monkey mask.
"The captains did a great job this year," Kenney said.
"The best Christmas training we've had. It's amazing how
much they look forward to so much pain."
