# Sullivan Principles
## 4 Stanford stocks did not sign 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Four companies in Stanford's portfolio of South Africa
related stocks have not signed the Sullivan Principles, ac
cording to information contained in the 1985-86 report on
compliance with the principles.
The report, made public last month, also gives the lowest
rating possible — "needs to become more active" — to
three firms in which Stanford owns stock.
In previous divestment decisions, the Board of Trustees
and the Commission on Investment Responsibility (CIR)
have attached great weight to a company's adherence to the
Sullivan Principles, a code of racial behavior for American
companies with operations in South Africa.
The CIR, in each of its four divestment recommendations
accepted by the Board of Trustees, has cited a poor Sullivan
performance or a lack of participation as a major reason for
action. This fall, those companies in the Stanford portfolio

with the lowest Sullivan ratings received the ClR's highest
priority for further investigation.
And a six-week delay in the release of the 1985-86 ratings
has wreaked havoc on the ClR's fall schedule, according to
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier. Using the new ratings as a
guide, the CIR had hoped to evaluate 22 firms by December.
As a result of the delay in the release of the ratings, the CIR
has given the trustees no divestment recommendations
since early November.
Stanford owns about $1.3 million worth of stock in the
four non-signatory companies, according to Dec. 15 figures,
the latest the University Treasurer's Office will provide. The
total includes $774,788 in McDonnell Douglas; $352,000 in
Timken Co.; $114,125 in Clark Equipment; and $49,875 in
Schlumberger Ltd.
The trustees voted in November to sell the Schlumberger
shares, but the Treasurer's Office said the process has been
slow because the University owned
about $4 million worth of shares.
The University owns a total of ap
proximately $2.5 million of stock in the
three companies that received the
lowest rating: Goodyear Tire & Rub
ber, Ingersoll-Rand and Ogilvy Group.
Stanford owns $173.9 million worth
of shares in South Africa-related com
panies. The University has divested of
stock worth approximately $4.8 mil
lion since May 1985.
In addition, Hewlett-Packard's 1985-
86 rating declined one category —
from the best possible, "making good
progress," to "making progress."
However, the Sullivan report warns:
"A downward shift does not necessar
ily imply that a company is applying
less effort to implement the principles
... but it does imply that the signatory
has not kept pace with some of its
peers. It is difficult and possibly unfair
to judge a company on its rating in any
single year; the pattern of its ratings
over several years is more important."
The Sullivan Principles were formu
lated by the Rev. Leon Sullivan in 1977.
