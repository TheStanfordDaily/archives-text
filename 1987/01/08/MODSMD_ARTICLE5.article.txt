# Library's critics appeal to county
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
Three organizations opposed to
the current site of the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library have sent a letter
to the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission asking it to reconsider
its ruling that the library was consis
tent with the "low intensity use" of
the site.
In their joint letter to the commis
sion, the Committee for Green Foot
hills, the Stanford Foothills
Residence Group and Stanford Area
Residents to Guarantee Open Space
(ARGOS) requested a rehearing be
cause the "staff report on which you
based your decision contained ...
significantly erroneous, incomplete
and misleading findings."
The commission, on - Dec. 4, ruled
by a 4-2 vote that the library was
suitable for the "low intensity use of
the academic reserve and open
space land."
According to Bob Sturdivant, chief
planning officer for the Santa Clara
County Planning Office, the commis
sion will not address the decision to
rehear until its Feb. 5 meeting.
Sturdivant said the commission
has a "very wide latitude in its abil
ity to rehear cases. As rehearings
happen so seldom, there is no spe
cific criteria which the board must
follow, he said.
According to Dr. Laura Esserman,
member of ARGOS, the groups are

pursuing a rehearing because a
negative ruling by the commission
would cause a major slowdown in
the library's construction.
With a reversal of the commis
sion's decision, the University will
have to to amend its general plan
and present a new proposal, he said.
Then the committee would probably
not reach its new decision until this
November, he said.
According to Charles Palm, Uni
versity archivist and representative
of the Reagan Library, this appeal is
comparable to "asking for a new
election after you've lost it."
Palm said that people concerned
about the impact of the library
should wait until the University sub
mits to the county an Environmental
Impact Report (EIR), which will
comprehensively examine the effect
of the library on the wildlife, the
plant life, the traffic and the neigh
boring area.
The letter states that the library
will have a "negative impact on the
viewshed, watershed, wildlife habitat
and recreation opportunities," and
will detract from"the open spaced
character of the land."
The library's size and the public
orientation of its facilities are also in
consistent with neighboring centers
such as the Center for Advance Study
in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS)
and the National Bureau of Eco
nomic Research which, unlike the
Reagan Library, are "designed as

private study centers for scholarly re
search," the letter said.
According to Palm, the University
is preparing a land-use report, which
will preserve the whole area's open
spaced character.
With regard to the library's size,
Palm said the footprint of the build
ing is 47,000 square feet, while the
footprint for CASBS and its sur
rounding buildings is 45,600 square
feet.
According to Esserman, the defini
tion of a footprint is the area con
tained by a complex. This definition
would raise the f<x>tprint of the li
brary to 146,000 square feet, she
said.
The letter also argues that the li
brary will bring as many as 300,000
tourists a year to the area, dramati
cally increasing traffic on the access
roads.
It will not be "low profile," as its
front section will have a highly
visible second story with no aca
demic use, according to the letter
