# Stanford fights student loan debt

### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
As government financial aid for col
lege students shifts from grants and
scholarships to loans, the Stanford Fin
ancial Aid Office must find alternative
funding sources to alleviate the student
debt burden.
"We've monitored it very closely for
a number of years," said Roberta
Johnson, associate director of Financial
Aid. She emphasized the "great com
mitment" of the University to buck the
national trend of rising student
debts."Students who were seniors in
1985-86 graduated with a mean debt of
less than $9,000," she said.
A recent congressional report
focused on the increased importance
of loans in federal and state financial
aid packages and the burden imposed
on students to repay them. In the last
10 years, loans have replaced non
repayable funds, such as Pell Grants
and scholarships, as the primary form
of college aid.
The rapid escalation in tuition costs
and the stricter requirements for gov
ernment aid have left the average stu
dent at a private institution $8,950 in
debt at graduation. The report, entitled
"Student Loans: Are They Overburden
ing a Generation?" notes the replace
ment of grants by loans in assistance
for students from low-income families
while pointing out the negative affects
debt can have on a student's academic
and personal plans.
According to the report, a quarter of
students graduating from private uni

versities owe $10,000-115,000 and
many incur a bigger debt in graduate
school.
Johnson said the statistics in the
report, which show almost half of fin
ancial aid coming from loans, are
"certainly not true for Stanford." The
Financial Aid Office has redoubled its
efforts in the past 10 years to maintain
the University's need-blind admissions
policy while not putting the student
too much in the red, she said.
The University, which supplies fin
ancial aid to approximately 65 percent
of students, offers aid packages made
up of University assistance and "self
help" programs. According to Johnson,
the "self-help" segment consists of em
ployment and loans and represents a
quarter of the whole package while the
University and other grant sources
make up the rest.
She said there "had been a drop" in
the /lumber of Pell Grants at Stanford
and there were "indications that the
decline in Pell Grants" would con
tinue.
In 1975-76, grants made up 80.3 per
cent of total financial aid in the United
States while loans accounted for only
16.9 percent, the report said. But in
1985-86, grants dipped to 47.8 percent
while loans rose to 48.8 percent of
total aid.
The Guaranteed Student Loan Pro
gram, which provides students with
federally subsidized loans, has also
grown stricter and deemed many stu
dents from middle class families in
