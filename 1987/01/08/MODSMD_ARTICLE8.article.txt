# Grads get tax loophole

### MONIQUE SCHEER Staff writer 
A letter released yesterday by the
Dean of Graduate Studies (see page 4)
announced a new interpretation of the
1987 tax code by which graduate stu
dents with teaching and research assis
tantships appointed before August 17,
1986, will remain exempt from taxes
through winter and spring quarters of
1987.
The new interpretation of the tax
code was made by Stanford and other
private research universities similarly
affected by the new tax law. Columbia
University, the University of Chicago
and MIT are among the institutions
providing a "united front" in support
of the interpretation, said the dean,
Elizabeth Traugott.
If students appointed assistantships
were required to complete their
degrees prior to August 17,1986 and if
they were exempt frc r i taxes last year,
then the new tax law will not affect
them this academic year. According to
Traugott, virtually all graduate students
who now have fellowships and assis
tantships at Stanford fall in this cate
gory.
There are "no guarantees" the Uni
versity's interpretation will hold, but it
is supported by a number of organiza
tions, she said. The Internal Revenue
Service promised to provide
guidelines, but she added: "There has
been no statement from the IRS on any
(tax-related) issue."
"There are a large number of people
doing the same kind of thing," she
said. "And there is reasonable safety in
numbers."
In the 1987-88 academic year,
however, the tax code will be en
forced. At that time, scholarships and
fellowships, less "course-related ex
penses," will be taxed, as will stipends
from all teaching and research assis
tantships, regardless of whether they
are required Tuition awards will prob
ably not be taxed, since most fall below
the amount of $5,250, which is not sub
ject to taxation under the new law.
Whether multi-year fellowships
awarded before the cutoff date will be
exempt from taxation next year is still
unclear. Traugott stated in her letter
that the University expects to resolve
this question by spring quarter.
Stanford is already responding on
several fronts to the effects the tax law
will have next year. University officials
are working with the Council of
