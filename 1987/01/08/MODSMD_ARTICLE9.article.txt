China admits Vietnam fighting
PEKING — The Chinese government yesterday confirmed reports from
Hanoi that new fighting has broken out along the Sino-Vietnamese border,
with both sides reporting casualty levels among the highest since a
monthlong war in 1979.
The official New China News Agency said the fighting began Monday
morning on the border near Laoshan, in the Chinese province of Yunnan.
The agency said that, as of last night in Peking, the fighting was continuing.
On Monday, the news agency said, Chinese frontier guards "wiped out
200 Vietnamese troops while repulsing their attacks," and yesterday morn
ing, "a Vietnamese company was annihilated."
Hanoi radio had said earlier that Vietnamese troops killed or wounded
nearly 500 Chinese soldiers.
There was no independent corroboration of these casualty figures.
Foreign correspondents are not permitted to visit the border areas where
fighting has taken place. However, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
did not directly deny the report of 500 Chinese casualties.
The spokesman, Ma Yuzhen, described the Hanoi report as "sheer boast
ing" and "rumors."
Ordinarily, when the Chinese government wishes to label something
untrue, the Foreign Ministry labels it a "sheer fabrication," but Ma carefully
avoided that wording.
A Western diplomat said yesterday that he was "mystified" why fighting
had broken out now. The Soviet Union, which supplies Vietnam with mili
tary equipment and financial aid, has been trying to improve its own rela
tions with China and, in the process, has been looking for ways to reduce
Sino-Vietnamese tension.
A West European analyst here theorized that Vietnam may be using the
skirmishes to show the Soviet Union that it will not be pressured into an
unfavorable settlement with China.
Chamoun wounded in attack
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Assassins wounded former President Camille
Chamoun and 35 other people and killed three bodyguards and a passerby
with a remote-controlled car bomb as his motorcade drove through Beirut
yesterday.
Chamoun, 86, a Christian who was the architect of the first U.S. military
peacekeeping mission in the Middle East and now serves as Lebanon's
finance minister, suffered minor shrapnel wounds in the face and both
hands, police said.
The 9:30 a.m. blast tore out a hole 6 feet deep and 14 feet wide and
hurled Chamoun's gray, bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz about 60 feet off the
road in the Mattahen industrial district of Christian East Beirut.
"But it (Chamoun's car) miraculously landed on its wheels and he
survived along with his driver," a police spokesman said.
It was the fifth time in 19 years that assassins tried in vain to kill
Chamoun, a respected political figure to whom Christian government offi
cials and militia commanders turn for advice in times of crisis.
"God is protecting us," Chamoun said in an interview broadcast by the
Christian Voice of Lebanon radio.
He made no accusations, and no group claimed responsibility for the
bombing.
The station taped the interview after Chamoun left Hotel Dieu hospital,
where his wounds were bandaged and where President Amin Gemayel,
like Chamoun a Maronite Catholic, rushed to see him.
The three slain bodyguards were in an escort Mercedes that took the
brunt of the explosion, the police spokesman said. A pedestrian also died.
Five other vehicles in the motorcade were unscathed, but 26 other cars
in the immediate area were destroyed, the spokesman said.
Police said a blue Peugeot 504 car laden with 165 pounds of explosives
blew up as Chamoun's motorcade passed, en route to a meeting of the
Lebanese Front, police said. The front is a coalition of rightist Christian
groups involved in Lebanon's civil war, now in its 12th year.
At a news conference in his East Beirut home later, Chamoun called the
attempt to kill him was "an act of terrorism." He urged "Western nations to
do something on the ground against terrorism."
Deng may get tough on students
PEKING — China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping has called for the
ouster of "big shots" within the Communist Party who have advocated
Western-style democracy, a pro-communist Hong Kong newspaper
revealed yesterday.
The usually well-informed Wen Wei Po said Deng proposed dealing
harshly with such wayward communists at a high-level party meeting held
to consider the current student unrest in China.
Since the student demonstrations began over four weeks ago, Deng has
made no public statements. But a front-page editorial in Tuesday's People's
Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, indicates that
Chinese authorities are toughening their position on the student unrest.
In yesterday's report in the Hong Kong newspaper, which has direct con
nections with Peking, Deng said, "Anyone who thought that he could
simply ignore party principles and discipline and insisted on pursuing
bourgeois liberalism must depart from the party ranks."
The newspaper said Deng proposed strengthening party leadership in
the fields of ideology, culture, theory and education. Analysts said his
remarks indicated that a number of high-level officials in research in
stitutes, the party propaganda department, the state education commission
and the culture ministry could now be in trouble and in danger of bring
fired.
Analysts said Deng apparently hardened his view of the student demon
strators calling for democracy, and of party officials who shared their views,
toward the end of December. This came after major demonstrations had
erupted Dec. 20 and 21 in Shanghai and a relatively small demonstration
had occurred Dec. 23 in Peking.
A Western diplomat said analysts now have two theories about where
Deng's tougher position will lead.
One theory is that the Chinese leader is preparing a crackdown in which
pro-democracy officials and students will come under much heavier pres
sure. The other is that Deng is trying to make sure that conservative offi
cials critical of the demonstrators and fearful of any political liberalization
do not get out in front of him.
No one doubts, however, that Deng is capable of leading a crackdown
when he considers it necessary.
The Peking University campus was reported to be quiet last night, with
many students now preparing for examinations. But some students at the
university spoke of organizing a small demonstration today at Tiananmen
Square in the center of the city, ostensibly to honor the late premier Chou
En-lai.
Japanese internment challenged
SAN FRANCISCO — The U.S. District Court was urged yesterday to hear a
challenge to a World War II Japanese-American detainment order, even
though the man who filed the petition died two months ago.
The family of Minoru Yasui, his lawyer and former prisoners of all 10 of
the U.S. internment centers during World War II made the emotional re
quest at a press conference.
Yasui, 70, died on Nov. 12, 1986, and the government filed a motion to
dismiss his case. But his lawyer, Peggy Nagae, filed a 16-page response with
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, asking that the case
be heard.
"The government has never admitted it was wrong,' said the Seattle
woman. "Lower courts have said there was government misconduct. The
whole thrust of this is to undercut the factual foundation of the precedent
set by the Supreme Court (wartime) cases."
Yasui became a symbol for the 110,000 Japanese-Americans imprisoned
during World War II when he challenged his internment 45 years ago, and
again sought to have the case reopened in 1983

blew up as Chamoun's motorcade passed, en route to a meeting of the
Lebanese Front, police said. The front is a coalition of rightist Christian
groups involved in Lebanon's civil war, now in its 12th year.
At a news conference in his East Beirut home later, Chamoun called the
attempt to kill him was "an act of terrorism." He urged "Western nations to
do something on the ground against terrorism."
Deng may get tough on students
PEKING — China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping has called for the
ouster of "big shots" within the Communist Party who have advocated
Western-style democracy, a pro-communist Hong Kong newspaper
revealed yesterday.
The usually well-informed Wen Wei Po said Deng proposed dealing
harshly with such wayward communists at a high-level party meeting held
to consider the current student unrest in China.
Since the student demonstrations began over four weeks ago, Deng has
made no public statements. But a front-page editorial in Tuesday's People's
Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, indicates that
Chinese authorities are toughening their position on the student unrest.
In yesterday's report in the Hong Kong newspaper, which has direct con
nections with Peking, Deng said, "Anyone who thought that he could
simply ignore party principles and discipline and insisted on pursuing
bourgeois liberalism must depart from the party ranks."
The newspaper said Deng proposed strengthening party leadership in
the fields of ideology, culture, theory and education. Analysts said his
remarks indicated that a number of high-level officials in research in
stitutes, the party propaganda department, the state education commission
and the culture ministry could now be in trouble and in danger of bring
fired.
Analysts said Deng apparently hardened his view of the student demon
strators calling for democracy, and of party officials who shared their views,
toward the end of December. This came after major demonstrations had
erupted Dec. 20 and 21 in Shanghai and a relatively small demonstration
had occurred Dec. 23 in Peking.
A Western diplomat said analysts now have two theories about where
Deng's tougher position will lead.
One theory is that the Chinese leader is preparing a crackdown in which
pro-democracy officials and students will come under much heavier pres
sure. The other is that Deng is trying to make sure that conservative offi
cials critical of the demonstrators and fearful of any political liberalization
do not get out in front of him.
No one doubts, however, that Deng is capable of leading a crackdown
when he considers it necessary.
The Peking University campus was reported to be quiet last night, with
many students now preparing for examinations. But some students at the
university spoke of organizing a small demonstration today at Tiananmen
Square in the center of the city, ostensibly to honor the late premier Chou
En-lai.
Japanese internment challenged
SAN FRANCISCO — The U.S. District Court was urged yesterday to hear a
challenge to a World War II Japanese-American detainment order, even
though the man who filed the petition died two months ago.
The family of Minoru Yasui, his lawyer and former prisoners of all 10 of
the U.S. internment centers during World War II made the emotional re
quest at a press conference.
Yasui, 70, died on Nov. 12, 1986, and the government filed a motion to
dismiss his case. But his lawyer, Peggy Nagae, filed a 16-page response with
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, asking that the case
be heard.
"The government has never admitted it was wrong,' said the Seattle
woman. "Lower courts have said there was government misconduct. The
whole thrust of this is to undercut the factual foundation of the precedent
set by the Supreme Court (wartime) cases."
Yasui became a symbol for the 110,000 Japanese-Americans imprisoned
during World War II when he challenged his internment 45 years ago, and
again sought to have the case reopened in 1983

China admits Vietnam fighting
PEKING — The Chinese government yesterday confirmed reports from
Hanoi that new fighting has broken out along the Sino-Vietnamese border,
with both sides reporting casualty levels among the highest since a
monthlong war in 1979.
The official New China News Agency said the fighting began Monday
morning on the border near Laoshan, in the Chinese province of Yunnan.
The agency said that, as of last night in Peking, the fighting was continuing.
On Monday, the news agency said, Chinese frontier guards "wiped out
200 Vietnamese troops while repulsing their attacks," and yesterday morn
ing, "a Vietnamese company was annihilated."
Hanoi radio had said earlier that Vietnamese troops killed or wounded
nearly 500 Chinese soldiers.
There was no independent corroboration of these casualty figures.
Foreign correspondents are not permitted to visit the border areas where
fighting has taken place. However, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
did not directly deny the report of 500 Chinese casualties.
The spokesman, Ma Yuzhen, described the Hanoi report as "sheer boast
ing" and "rumors."
Ordinarily, when the Chinese government wishes to label something
untrue, the Foreign Ministry labels it a "sheer fabrication," but Ma carefully
avoided that wording.
A Western diplomat said yesterday that he was "mystified" why fighting
had broken out now. The Soviet Union, which supplies Vietnam with mili
tary equipment and financial aid, has been trying to improve its own rela
tions with China and, in the process, has been looking for ways to reduce
Sino-Vietnamese tension.
A West European analyst here theorized that Vietnam may be using the
skirmishes to show the Soviet Union that it will not be pressured into an
unfavorable settlement with China.
Chamoun wounded in attack
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Assassins wounded former President Camille
Chamoun and 35 other people and killed three bodyguards and a passerby
with a remote-controlled car bomb as his motorcade drove through Beirut
yesterday.
Chamoun, 86, a Christian who was the architect of the first U.S. military
peacekeeping mission in the Middle East and now serves as Lebanon's
finance minister, suffered minor shrapnel wounds in the face and both
hands, police said.
The 9:30 a.m. blast tore out a hole 6 feet deep and 14 feet wide and
hurled Chamoun's gray, bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz about 60 feet off the
road in the Mattahen industrial district of Christian East Beirut.
"But it (Chamoun's car) miraculously landed on its wheels and he
survived along with his driver," a police spokesman said.
It was the fifth time in 19 years that assassins tried in vain to kill
Chamoun, a respected political figure to whom Christian government offi
cials and militia commanders turn for advice in times of crisis.
"God is protecting us," Chamoun said in an interview broadcast by the
Christian Voice of Lebanon radio.
He made no accusations, and no group claimed responsibility for the
bombing.
The station taped the interview after Chamoun left Hotel Dieu hospital,
where his wounds were bandaged and where President Amin Gemayel,
like Chamoun a Maronite Catholic, rushed to see him.
The three slain bodyguards were in an escort Mercedes that took the
brunt of the explosion, the police spokesman said. A pedestrian also died.
Five other vehicles in the motorcade were unscathed, but 26 other cars
in the immediate area were destroyed, the spokesman said.
Police said a blue Peugeot 504 car laden with 165 pounds of explosives
