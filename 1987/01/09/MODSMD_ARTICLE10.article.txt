# Train ran through 'slow' signals
## 
### 
The engineer of the Conrail train
that rolled into the path of a high
speed Amtrak train, killing 15 persons,
ran at a steady 60 miles per hour
through two signals telling him to slow
down, sources close to the investiga
tion said Wednesday.
The engineer threw on his brakes
about a half mile before Sunday's fatal
impact when he realized he was ap
proaching a stop signal, the sources
said.
The trip of the Conrail freight
locomotive described by investigators
seemed troubled from the beginning,
with no working locomotive radio and
two disabled safety mechanisms in the
cab. Three outside signals indicating
speed limits, however, were working
properly, the investigators said.

If the engineer had heeded the sig
nals he claims to have seen, he would
have had time to bring his train to a
stop before sliding onto the main line
in front of the Amtrak train, they said.
The engineer, Ricky Gates, 39, was
interviewed extensively by federal in
vestigators Wednesday. He was un
available for comment, but his lawyer,
Stephen Tully, said Wednesday night
that Gates responded properly to the
signals and was not at fault.
Amtrak resumed normal service
north from Washington Wednesday for
the first time since the crash, the worst
in Amtrak history. Of the 170 injured in
the crash, at least 12 remained hospi
talized.
Tully said Gates told investigators
that one of the signals, located almost

two miles from the crash site, gave him
a false reading, telling him he was clear
to proceed through the switch where
the two trains collided.
Investigators said a preliminary
check of the signal system showed that
the signal actually instructed Gates to
slow down to 30 mph and be prepared
to stop at the point where his tracks
merged with the tracks the other train
was on. They said the Conrail train
should have been traveling no more
than 15 mph when it approached a
final signal — known as the "home sig
nal" — 384 feet before the tracks
merge.
Investigators said that even if Gates
had gotten the instructions he said he
saw on the first signal, he should have
slowed to 45 mph. At that speed, they

said, he would have been able to stop
in time when he saw the home signal's
stop instruction nearer the switch.
A locomotive simulator, they said,
indicated that the Conrail locomotive,
a General Electric 836, and the two
identical locomotives coupled to it,
would have slid 2,150 feet if the emer
gency brakes were applied at 60 mph.
That is almost exactly what actually
happened. Although tests have not yet
been run on stopping distances for that
type of locomotive at 45 mph, a test on
a different type of locomotive placed
its stopping distance at a considerably
shorter distance than 800 feet.
"There's no question he could have
stopped (at 45 mph)," said an inves
tigator.
