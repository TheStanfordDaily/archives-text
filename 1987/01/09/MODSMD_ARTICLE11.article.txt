# Vienna vote postponed
## Hoover cites 'Reagan connection' 
### DAN DE LUCE BAIE NETZER Senior staff writers 
The Faculty Senate postponed voting yesterday on a mo
lion to form an ad hoc committee for the oversight of Stan
ford s Overseas Studies Program and to review the decision
to close the Vienna campus.
Earlier in the meeting, English Prof. Ronald Rebholz cited
the Hoover Institution's Annual Report as evidence of "a
politically driven ideological agenda." Rebholz quoted
Hoover Director Glenn Campbell who wrote in the report
that the University can boast' of a "Reagan connection"
with the Board of Trustees' approval of the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library.
1 he motion for a committee to review Overseas Studies
policy and the decision to close the Vienna campus came
following a short speech by Political Science Prof. Emeritus
Kurt Steiner, who protested the closure of the Vienna pro
gram and cited the 1982 Inkles Report, calling for senate
overview of the Overseas Studies Program.
The oversight function of the senate has been all too
dormant," Steiner said. "I think the important thing is that
the issue doesn't get away from us."
Steiner and four other faculty members had earlier dis
tributed a document to members of the Faculty Senate in
which they criticized the closure of the Vienna program and
suggested alternatives to the program's closure.
"I certainly hope that this decision is not irrevocable be
cause it is being implemented before it is seriously consid
ered," Steiner said.
Steiner's recommendation for the formation of an ad hoc
committee followed a presentation to the senate by Law
Prof. Thomas Heller, director of the Overseas Studies Pro
gram, on developments in the Overseas Studies Program.
The creation of a committee might serve only to transfer
the function of the current Overseas Studies Program Com
mittee to a Faculty Senate Committee, Heller told the senate.
Herbert Lindenberger, professor of comparative
literature and English, made the motion to establish an ad

hoc committee to review the decision to close the Vienna
program as well as to provide an overview of current Over
seas Studies policy.
The motion, proposed after lengthy discussion, was
tabled for action at a future meeting because of time con
straints that would not allow for full debate.
Lindenberger said after the meeting that he proposed an
ad hoc committee because, at present, the Overseas Pro
gram Committee is "administrative" in nature, instead of
reporting directly to the senate.
Heller said, however, that "the objectives stated in the
Inkles Report are the same objectives of the program com
mittee."
Lindenberger, who has not come out for or against the
Vienna closure, replied that a senate committee would con
duct its business differently than a committee under the
dean of Humanities and Sciences.
Steiner also criticized as inadequate the Overseas Studies
office proposal to replace the existing Vienna center with a
quaner in Berlin and an internship in Austria. "We feel that
the proposition of having students go for one quarter to
Berlin and then to Vienna for some kind of internship is
academically hardly viable," Steiner said.
Industrial Engineering Prof. James Adams said it is diffi
cult to close "something where you live." He said: "I think if
we closed Stern Hall, we'd find a lot of people loved it."
Heller said the decision to close the Vienna program was
based on "priority determination on the basis of scarce re
sources."
In earlier senate discussion, Rebholz asked Provost James
Rosse, acting president of the University, to comment on
Campbell's introductory remarks in Hoover's annual report,
which included the statement: .. (with the approval of the
Reagan library) it is not only the Hoover Institution that can
boast of a Reagan connection,' but also the entire Univer
sity."
Rosse said he had not yet seen the report and added: "I
believe, I hope, that Glenn Campbell was speaking as an in
dividual when he said those things."
