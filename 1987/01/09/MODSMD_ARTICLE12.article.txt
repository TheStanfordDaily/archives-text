## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Ease loan crunch 
### 
Financially speaking, 1987 is not a great time to be in
college.
Rapidly rising tuition costs and a sharp decline in the
availability of government grants are forcing ever
growing numbers of college students to borrow heavily
in order to pay for their schooling, according to a con
gressional report issued last week.
The report, prepared by the College Board on behalf
of Congress' Joint Economic Committee, points out that
federal grants to students have declined 62 percent
during the last 10 years, while the cost of a college edu
cation has gone up as much as 25 percent for the same
period.
These factors, the report argues, have conspired to
triple student borrowing since 1976. Noting that the
average student at a private university currently
graduates $8,950 in debt, the report warns that rising
debt may soon lead to a financial "overburdening" of
college graduates.
Ever-growing numbers of graduates are beginning
their adult lives several thousand dollars in debt — an
unacceptable situation. Unless something is done
quickly, increasing debt burdens may begin to constrain
the career and lifestyle choices of America's college
graduates.
At Stanford, the proportion of tuition that students on
financial aid must borrow is slightly less than levels at
comparable private universities. Nevertheless, graduat
ing seniors on financial aid last year were heavily in debt
when they left Stanford.
Considering possible solutions to the student debt
problem, it is tempting to argue simplv that the govern

ment should offer more money to students in the form
of grants and scholarships, which do not have to be paid
back.
Admittedly, in the short term, greater federal aid
would probably reduce the proportion of college costs
students currently finance through loans. In the long
run, however, more federal aid to students could lead to
even higher tuition costs. Unfortunately, if the govern
ment makes more money available to students, univer
sities will find that they can also up the ante and charge
more in tuition.
Boston University President John Silber has suggested
a plan that would, if implemented, greatly mitigate the
burden of paying back loans. Silber proposes that the
rate at which graduates must repay their federal student
loans be pegged to their incomes. Under Silber's plan, a
graduate would have to pay a small percentage of his
income annually until the loan is paid off.
Such a system would significantly ease the repayment
burden for new graduates without large or steady
incomes. Although Silber's plan does not address the
root causes of growing student debt, namely rising tui
tion costs and declining availability of government
grants, it could, if implemented, significantly reduce the
hardship of paying off that debt.
As a first step, Stanford should use its position and in
fluence as a major university to push for the establish
ment of an income-contingent loan payback plan.
Beyond that, the University, and the nation as a whole,
owes it to future generations of graduates to search for a
lasting solution to the growing problem of student debt.
