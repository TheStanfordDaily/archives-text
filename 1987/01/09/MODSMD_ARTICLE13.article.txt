New Mexico's
Anaya is no hero,
just a politician
I am writing in response to a recent
editorial (Daily, Dec. 5) that con
cerned former New Mexico Governor
Toney Anaya's decision to commute
the sentences of five men on death
row, or as the editorial states, "A New
Mexico man saved five people's lives."
Anaya has been quoted as saying
that he received assistance in making
his decision from the ACLU, religious
leaders, and members of his family
and cabinet. But did he bother to

consult with the families of the victims
of these five men, whose loved ones
were indubitably murdered, raped,
tortured or any other such heinous
and abhorrent crime to be found
guilty of such a penalty?
Then the editorial says that Anaya
should be hailed as a national hero.
How about spineless coward of the
year? Anaya used his authority as
governor to commute the death sen
tences only after he had been voted
out of office. I wonder how many
votes he would have received from
the people of New Mexico, who voted
75 percent in favor of the death
penalty, if he made his decision
before the election.
