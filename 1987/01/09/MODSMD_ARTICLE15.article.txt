# Revolution will stop apartheid

### 
UPRISING

On Thursday, Dec. 4, the UPRISING-sponsored
rally against Chief Buthelezi and in support of the
revolution in Azania (South Africa) revealed a
profound development in progressive politics. Al
though The Daily, for whatever reasons, chose not to
report on the essence of the event, let it be revealed
to the Stanford community that at this rally a group of
students and workers raised the banner of the
enemies of U.S. imperialism in South Africa: the used

tire. Holding up these unlit replicas of the burning
"necklaces," which Azanians used to ring the necks
of collaborators with the regime, more than a dozen
people formed an angry corridor that the chief was
hurried through by his thugs to chants of "necklace,
necklace" and "Buthelezi, Botha's lackey."
Predictably, many people, including the San Fran
cisco Chronicle's editorial staff (see Dec. 6 issue),
The Stanford Daily (as evidenced by the censorship),
campus divestment activists and even the professor
whom we invited were unhappy about the message
of our rally. So now, it is out in the open: There is a
split in the anti-apartheid movement. On one side,
there are those who are opposed to apartheid. On
die other, there are those who are opposed to the in
ternational economic relations that give rise to it.
This split is not just some petty theoretical squabble,
but in fact, these differing world views lead to differ
ing conceptions of strategies and tactics.
For those of us committed to supporting the
liberation of Azania, it is essential both to oppose U.S.
and Soviet imperialism (and their lackeys and fifth
columns) and to support groups that will make the
most thorough-going revolution. For this we are
criticized by our anti-apartheid friends from two
principal angles.
First, some argue that apartheid must end by
peaceful means, that otherwise a "torrent of blood
shall flow. We would call this argument naive if an
Azanian made it. But when someone benefiting from
Azanian degradation makes it, this is just downright
imperialist.
From the perspective of the oppressed, their daily
experience is one fraught with violence from the sys
tem. It is not necessary to be whipped or shot to be a
victim of violence. To be starved, disease-ridden,
ghettoized and culturally repressed is violence. To
engage in back-breaking manual labor to the exclu-

sion of the development of that which makes us
human — our minds — is violent. So when these
"champions of peace" say they want peace, they are
really saying that while it troubles their conscience
that the system from which they benefit is violent, the
violence of the oppressed fighting back is un
bearable. For this violence would cause the blood of
their class counterparts in Azania to flow.
But our upholders of the docility of the oppressed
passionately try to convince us that they are trying to
help alleviate the violence of their system by making
appeals to the consciences of the immediate ex
ploiters. The oppressed, however, increasingly in
unison say, "We don't want condescending saviors or
crumbs from the banquet table or pity from our
masters. We want control over our lives, and if you
want to help us get control, fine, but if you don't, get
out of the way before history rolls over you."
The second criticism is a little bit more "left"
sounding. This argument asserts that support of spe
cific revolutionary groups is divisive; to do so is not
to respect the right of self-determination. Well, obvi
ously, none of us (we hope) feels that Botha, for ex
ample, even though he is South African, should be
part of Azanian self-determination. And the same for
Buthelezi. So, where do we draw the line?
Our friends say we must neutrally support anyone
opposing the government. But this position is clearly
flawed because in any social upheaval there are many
forces opposed to the status quo, but not all want to
fundamentally transform relations of exploitation.
On the basis of that position, should we support the
Progressive Federal Party that is pro-British and
American imperialism? Should we blanketly support
the United Democratic Front which contains groups
that are not fundamentally opposed to imperialist
domination? Should we support the African National
Congress that is dominated by people who are for
Soviet imperialism?
These are touchy questions for two reasons. One,
some of these groups are allied to oppose the gov
ernment, and two, the victories of these different
groups would benefit, or at least not fundamentally
hurt, certain classes and strata here.
We can understand this situation through histori
cal analogy by looking back on the struggle of the
Chinese people against Japanese imperialism. It is
clear that even though Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomin
tang (KMT) was allied with Mao's Communist Party,
given the pro-U.S. line of the KMT it would have been
imperialist for American progressives to have sup-

ported it. So, obviously the most progressive thing to
do was to have supported Mao.
Likewise, in South Africa, for the committed anti
imperialist, for someone committed to the fighting
back of the oppressed, for someone not living in the
fantasy of ruling classes voluntarily relinquishing
power, there is an alternative: Support the Azanian
People's Organization (AZAPO), which is part of the

Black Consciousness Movement (BCM). It is anti-U,S.,
-U.K., -Soviet, and not supported by China. It is com
mitted to arming the masses for revolutionary war.
With Steve Biko as their example, the Azanian youth
in the BCM must and will overthrow imperialist
domination and take power. And some of us, al
though removed in space, will support them.
Our violent, non-violent friends will clench their
fists in ironic rage at us as their class position of ben
efactor of the oppressed is undermined. Those who
argue for imperialistic neutrality toward all anti
government forces will charge us with "paternalism,"
knowing that neutrality and inertia is on the side of
those who would sell out the people.
Yes, we will alienate many, maybe even a majority
of Americans. (Although a recent Gallup Poll shows
that almost 60 percent of Americans feel violence will
be necessary to topple apartheid.) But that is not pri
mary to us. Although those living in the belly of the
beast who came over to the side of its enemies on
Thursday were not large in number, the increase
over the day before was enormous and the impact on
the morale of Azanians and other struggling people
around the world was immeasurable. And even
though we riay never constitute a majority of
Americans, the overwhelming majority of the world's
people are on our side.
Uprising is an anti-imperialist organization that is
trying to understand and combat class divisions, rac
ism, sexism and the oppression of gays and lesbians.
