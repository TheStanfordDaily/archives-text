# Star Wars does deter nuclear war

John Welner's recent viewpoint (Daily, Jan. 5) on
the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), while appear
ing to be a coolly rational, impartial examination of
the facts, is in reality a smoothly crafted polemic
against the initiative. Though Welner claims that the
alleged "limitations of Reagan's plan certainly do not

W. ROB LEAKE

imply that the Pentagon should abandon space weap
ons altogether," from the tone of the rest of the arti
cle it seems that nothing would please Welner more
than scrapping such plans. Feigning an objective
stance to strengthen an argument, while not com
mendable, is forgivable However, his highly biased
and selective presentation of "facts" is not.
Contrary to the article's claim, SDl's "promise of
increased deterrence has not already been proven a
myth The article cites as evidence the "fact" that
"more than 7,000 scientists throughout the country
have publicly rejected the feasibility of SDI," con
veniently neglecting to mention that more than
10,000 other scientists believe that SDI is attainable,
and that research and testing should continue. Does
a minority opinion (or even a majority opinion) in
the scientific community prove something to be a
myth? Apparently Welner believes so.
SDI has already shown us its deterrent value. Most
analysts concur that it was SDI that brought the
Soviets back to the bargaining table in Geneva,
where negotiations continue today. There is less
chance of conflict if both sides are still talking, so the
President's initiative has already increased deter
rence.
Another falsify is the article's claim that the presi

dent "has dismissed its (SDI s] value as a negotiating
tool because of his unfamiliarity with the research
schedule," and that at Reykjavik, "a more informed
president might have ... struck a historic bargain."
While I'm not one to argue that Reagan is one of our
more informed presidents, in this instance (for a
change), he was completely on top of things. While
confining SDI to the laboratory for 10 years might
not hurt it technologically, it would be its death
politically. Congress has never and would not ever
fund a program that does not produce tangible,
risible results, results that research alone could not

provide. Congressmen need flashy tests and
demonstrations, which would have been prohibited
under Soviet leader Gorbachev's proposal. Gorba
chev and Reagan both comprehended that a 10-year
hiatus on testing would undoubtedly kill the Ameri
can SI)I program, while leaving the Soviets' own ef
fort, already ahead of ours in many areas, completely
untouched. Some "historic bargain."
