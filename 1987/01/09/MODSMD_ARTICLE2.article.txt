# Vienna decision criticized
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
A group of five University staff and
faculty members have sent the Faculty
Senate a 12-page memorandum with
41 pages of supporting documentation
that criticizes the closure of Stanford's
program in Vienna, Austria, and sug
gests alternatives to shutting down the
program.
Peter Frank, Germanic collections
curator for University Libraries, Ger
man Studies Prof. Walter Lohnes,
Drama Prof. Douglas Russell, Political
Science Prof. Emeritus Kurt Steiner
and Sociology Prof. Nancy Brandon
Tuma distributed the document to sen
ate members on Monday. Steiner
referred to the document at yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting and called for a
senate committee to review the deci
sion to close the Vienna program.
"We hope that the statement will
lead to reconsideration of the decision
to close the Vienna Center and to a
suspension of its implementation
while longer range plans are consid
ered," the letter states.
The document evaluates the role of
the Vienna program in developing re
lations between Austria and Stanford,
the reasons given for the closure of the
Vienna program, the process used to
review the program and alternatives to
closing the center in Vienna.
According to the letter, the Stanford
center in Vienna is perceived by
Austrian authorities as a cooperative
enterprise between Stanford and
Austria and has been of major impor
tance in developing relations between
that country and the University.

Authors of the memorandum in
clude in their documentation a copy of
a December letter from Austria's
Foreign Minister, Peter Jankowitsch, to
University President Donald Kennedy
"I should like to underscore the
high priority Austria attaches to the ...
activities of the Vienna Stanford Cen
ter," Jankowitsch wrote. "The Austrian
authorities are ready to examine
closely and to discuss the suggestions
put forward by Law Prof. Thomas Hel
ler, director of Overseas Studies,
during his recent stay in Vienna."
Also attached to the memorandum is
a copy of a telegram from Austria's
minister for science and research,
Heinz Fischer, to Kennedy.
"From conversations with Prof. Hel
ler we had the impression that ... the
development of a new program, con
sonant with the desires of the students
and the goals of Stanford University,
rather than a deletion without substi
tute was being contemplated," Fischer
wrote.
In 1976, the presence of the center
in Vienna was instrumental in helping
Stanford receive an endowed visiting
Austrian professorship over other uni
versities, according to the letter. The
endowment hafc continued over the
past 10 years.
Authors of the letter contend that the
Vienna program closure will likely
damage Stanford's potential to be a
major U.S. center of Central European
studies. The decision to close the cen
ter comes at a time when the Univer
sity has provided money to create a
Center for European Studies and in
which a Swiss visiting professorship is
