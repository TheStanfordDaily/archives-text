## The 						most dangerous game comes to Stanford residences Squirtguns erase unwary dormmates in Assassin contest 
### KATHY LACHENAUER 
It was 6 o'clock in the evening.
Sophomore Tamar Dorfman was sit
ting in a packed Stern Dining Hall
when she realized the time was right.
Within the next five minutes Dorfman
would murder two fellow Stanford stu
dents.
Her first victim, sophomore Paula
Pickering, a close friend, was too ab
sorbed with eating the salad on her
plate to notice the pistol clutched in
Dorfman's hand beneath the table Not
wanting to kill a best friend, Dorfman
pretended to enjoy her chicken nug
gets as she sat deliberating.

7 hope that stu
dents reflect on
what they 're doing
and ask themselves
what is the point of
the game and the
need to annihilate
each other.'

Finally, she decided the opportunity
was too perfect to resist. She acted
without a second's delay. The pistol
went from beneath the table to Picker
ing's forehead.
"Sorry, Paula, it's nothing personal,
but I have to kill you now," were
Dorfman's final words before she shot
her victim in cold blood.
Water trickled down from Picker
ings forehead. But she accepted her
deatli by squirt gun without qualms be
cause she knew that her assassination
was all in the spirit of the dorm game.

Last quarter Twain House was one of
about half a dozen dorms on campus
to play Assassin. The Twain game
typified how the thriller spy contest is
played throughout Stanford. About 50
of Twain's residents participated, and
some were dead set on winning and
claiming the $35 prize as well as all the
glory.
One such player was junior Chuck
Gerardo, a member of the gymnastics
team. Gerardo, known as the Rambo
man in the dorm, had blown away five
Twain players while eluding Pickering
all week.
Gerardo escaped Pickering's daily
murder attempts because his shots in
defense were more accurate than Pick
ering's attacks.
That night in the dining hall,
Gerardo sat eyeing Pickering, not real
izing that she had just been killed.
Meanwhile, Dorfman was able to
sneak up and blast him from behind.
"No fair! Your're supposed to
Rambo your victims dead," Gerardo
protested when he realized that
Dorfman's sly maneuvers had gotten
the best of him.
According to Gerardo and other
Twain players, the essence of the Assas
sin game is to "kill, kill, kill fellow
dormmates."
The destructive nature of Assassin
bothers Alice Supton, assistant dean of
Residential Education.
"I hope that students reflect on what
they're doing and ask themselves what
is the point of the game and the need
to annihilate each other," Supton said.
Residential Education places no re
strictions on playing Assassin, and Sup
ton said "decisions (concerning the
game) should be made at the dorm
level." But Supton said some resident
fellows felt the game was antagonistic
to what should go on in a house com
munity.
According to Robin Hensley, pro
gram coordinator for Residential Edu
cation, resident assistants were also
concerned about the violent implica
tions of Assassin. In fact, some sugges
ted showing films on gun control in
the dorms, she said.
Even winners of Assassin were not
fully in favor of the game. According to
senior Andrew Myers, one of two sur
viving Twain players when the game

'Sorry, it's nothing
personal, but I
have to kill you
now."

was finally called a tie, the contest got
really tiring. Myers said one morning
he left the dorm at 6 o'clock and didn't
come back until 11 that night because
he was so afraid of being shot. Other
players refused to eat in their dorms
and climbed through windows to
avoid running into their would-be kil
lers.
Despite the burdens placed on de
termined players and the worries ex
pressed by Residential Education,
sophomore Dan Culhane, Twain's so
cial chairman, hoped to play Assassin

again. He encouraged other dorms to
try the game and make it an "undying"
Stanford tradition. Here are Cuihane's
rules:
• All assassinations must be made
with the regulation squirt gun pro
vided by the dorm social chairperson.
• An assassination occurs when a
victim is hit with water from the assas
sin's pistol without any legal witnesses
"seeing" the action.
• "Seeing" means viewing the actual
act as it happens. It does not mean
being in the room but not actually
seeing the murder happen.
• A witness is a live player only.
Note: witnesses will start to be killed.
• If someone attempts an assassina
tion and misses his intended victim,
the victim may shoot his assailant. The
assassin who was shot may not attempt
a murder for one hour after being hit.
• A student's own dorm room, and
all bathrooms are off limits.
• A student who has been assas
sinated must sign a death certificate,
which the social chairperson gives all
players. All deaths are final.
