### MONIQUE SCHEER Staff writer 
The stone that the builder rejected
is now the cornerstone.
— Psalm 118
The Stanford Hillel Foundation
dedicated its newly renovated li
brary yesterday in a short ceremony
marked by prayer, song, wine and
cheese. What was once a deteriorat
ing student apartment on the
ground floor of Old Union is now a
cozy library that will be much more
useful to Hillel and the Stanford
community.
Rabbi Ari Cartun, executive direc
tor of Hillel, presided over the ser
vice, which included affixing the
mezuzah to the doorpost of the
room and dedicating the newly
built ark that houses three holy
scrolls.
The former two-room apartment
has been home to Hillel's collection
of 3,000 books for some time, but
now it will also be a study hall,
meeting room and place for wor
ship.
The staff at Hillel welcomes the
expansion of the library.
"It was used before, but now it
will be much easier to use than ever
before," said Sally Wieder, the Hil
lel librarian.
Wieder recalled the difficulty she
and others working in the library
had in the previously cramped
quarters. Before the renovation, the
two rooms of the apartment formed
a long, narrow corridor Filled with
books and old easy chairs, Wieder
said.
The Hillel newspaper was
produced in an office that used to
be the bathroom, where a free
standing bathtub served as a desk.
The floor of the rooms was uneven
and badly water damaged; accord
ing to Cartun, "They looked like
something out of Berlin after World
War II."
The renovation process got rid of
all the interior walls that separated
the library from the old bathroom
office and two adjacent storage
closets, creating a much more spa
cious room. New furniture has
been ordered, Cartun said.
The entire process was achieved
through a great deal of cooperation
and was completed in a relatively
short period of time.
Plans began to take shape during
the summer, Hillel Program Direc
tor Jocelyn Reisman said. An
anonymous donation of $10,000

made the work possible, but a great
deal of volunteer time was also put
in by students.
Beginning in November, students
spent "whole days of working to
gether" to clean and paint the walls,
Reisman said. After one month of
work, the library was nearly
finished.
The room is no longer long and
narrow, but open and freshly
painted, with new carpet on its
reconstructed floor. The ark hold
ing the torah stands, appropriately,
in the east corner of the library,
where its brightly lit cabinets await
some finishing and decorative
artwork.
The scrolls it holds have an inter
esting history of their own, accord
ing to Cartun.

What was once a
deteriorating stu
dent apartment
on the ground
floor of Old Un
ion is now a
cozy library that
will be much
more useful to
Hillel.

In the late 19305, when the Nazis
occupied Czechoslovakia, they col
lected artifacts from the Jewish
families they imprisoned, intending
to set up a "Museum to the Dead
Race" in Prague.
After the Nazi surrender at the
end of World War 11, Westminster
Synagogue in London took the
1,500 scrolls from Prague, repaired
them and distributed them on
"permanent loan" throughout the
world. The ark in the Hillel library
houses one of these precious, 200-
year-old scrolls.
"A library within Hillel is some
what of an unusual thing," Wieder
said, noting that Stanford's group is
one of few in the country with a li
brary of its own. All the books in the
library pertain to Judaism — its
doctrine, history and outstanding
leaders. The library is independent of
the University, funded entirely through
Hillel. which derives the bulk of its rev

enue from donations and fund-raising
efforts.
"And it is open to anybody," Wieder
noted.
The most frequent visitors to the li
brary have traditionally been students.
Senior Steve Simon has seen the li
brary grow from being "a quiet little
place' to a more popular "stxial gath

ering place for students. There is al
ways a pot of coffee ready in the
evenings, and although students come
to study there, "they always end up
socializing," he said.
Study hall hours at the Hillel library
are Sunday through Thursday, H-ll
p.m. Coffee and tea are available for
free.
