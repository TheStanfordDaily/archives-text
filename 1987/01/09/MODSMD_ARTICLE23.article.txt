# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

Computer literate
According to an in-house survey conducted at Rider Col
lege, students who use computers receive higher grades
than students who peck out their research papers on
typewriters, The Chronicle of Higher Education reports.
Papers written on word processors garnered an average
grade of 3.1 on the four-point scale. Typewritten papers
received an average of 2.6.
Over a college career, using a computer could mean the
difference between making the dean's list or hovering
above academic probation, said Thomas Simonet, a com
munication professor at Rider.
The study said computer-produced papers looked nicer,
were longer, and showed improved sentence structure and
idea organization.
Bring home the bacon
A two-year survey at UC-Berkeley suggests that most stu
dents still believe in a traditional marriage, in which the
husband brings home the bacon and the wife stays home
with the kids.
1 wo-thirds of the men and half of the women interviewed
said the husband's career comes first and most men said
they were unwilling to do laundry or cook dinner, The Daily
Californian reported. Only two of the 120 men interviewed
said they would be willing to relocate for their wife's job.
"Missing... from both the women and men is a sense that
joint incomes increasingly are necessary in order to main
tain a middle-class life style," the report of the survey said.
Like father, like son
"Mom and Dad might not have been such good kids after
all," according to the Indiana Daily Student, the Indiana Uni
versity newspaper.
Studies done by institutions including lU's Kinsey In
stitute for Sex, Gender and Reproduction show that sexual
habits of college students vary little from year to year.
Moreover, contrary to what most college students prob
ably think (and what their parents would undoubtedly like
them to think), the parents of today's college students were
probably just as promiscuous in college as their children
are now.
The difference is in perceptions of sex, suggests William
Yarber, professor of applied health science at lU.
"(Sex) just wasn't talked about or accepted or even
allowed by social norms (in past years)," Yarber said.
Older people may deny it. Stats show that parents don't
want their kids to know that they did it.
"Young people think that their generation invented cer

tain things," he said. ' We always think that things arc more
liberal than the older generations before us
But things really haven't changed that much over the
years.
About 25 percent of all college students surveyed in 1938
believed premarital sex was all right for both men and
women.
A 1938 book "Youth and Sex. written by free lance jour
nalists Dorothy Bromley and Florence Britten, disclosed
that college women who wished to remain virgins shared
many of the problems today s studentsface.
"The sexual mores are changing, Bromley and Britten
wrote. The terms "necking" and "petting" were already ob
solete on campuses in 193H, and there was more
widespread acceptance of the naturalness of sexual inti
macy.
"The Kinsey Report on Male Sexuality, issued in 1948,
sparked a torrent of other studies proving that college stu
dents were engaging in premarital sex.
G.M. Gilbert, professor of psychology at Princeton, noted
in a 1948 article titled "Sex on Campus," that college men
also faced dilemmas. Many debated whether to remain vir
gins or to give in to their desires. According to Gilbert, the
majority chose the latter.
Many college students today look at the 1960s as a time of
free and open sex. But statistics compiled in an Oxford Uni
versity survey show that sex is much more open today than
two decades ago.
In 1971, 37 percent of all college males were virgins. In
1984, the percentage was 28.
Similarly, in 1971, 56 percent of college women were vir
gins, while in 1984 only 43 percent were virgins.
Although researchers 50 years ago uncovered sexual
promiscuity on campus, many older adults are reluctant to
discuss details of sex in their college years.
Dorothy Fisk, an IU undergraduate in the 40s, said stu
dents then were less wild than they are in the 80s.
"Times have changed for the worse," she said. "(It was)
nothing like today."
Winter wonderland
The rain comes down. The reading and problem sets as
sociated with a 20-unit load begin to make themselves felt.
Warm memories of Christmas and the holidays fade quickly.
Basically, it's winter quarter and you're depressed as all
hell.
But don't worry. Really, don't get any more depressed
about it than you already are.
You see, it's just natural to be depressed during the win
ter months. Or so say doctors quoted in an article in The

Daily Pennsylvanian, the University of Pennsylvania paper.
According to the article, medical studies show that de
pression is common during this time of year for biological
and psychological reasons.
Peter Whybrow, chairman of Penn's Medical School Psy
chology Department, recently conducted a study of 100 nor
mal individuals in northern New England. He surveyed the
subjects for 15 months and found that in the winter, people
tend to nap more, crave carbohydrates, gain weight and be
less active than normal.
Whybrow said the behavioral changes can be thought of
as a human parallel to animal hibernation, in which the
body attempts to store energy for the spring.
"This behavior is probably very normal," he said. "What is
abnormal is modern society's view that everyone should be
the same all year round. But why should we? The tempera
ture changes, the seasons change; why shouldn't our bodies
change too?"
Nor are biological changes the only factors that spawn
winter depression in people, according to Richard Friend,

director of the Psychology Resource Center in Philadelphia.
Friend said psychological expectations that accompany the
holiday season can cause people to become depressed
rather than happy.
Larry Minter, director of the Humanistic Psychology Cen
ter in Philadelphia, offered the following advice to people
who are experiencing general depression:
• Encourage yourself to be active. Depressed people tend
to be inactive, but Minter advised resisting this inertia. He
added that physical activity is helpful in combating
depresive inactivity.
• Become more social. Social withdrawal often accom
panies depression. Minter said he believes it is important to
get involved with your friends, because social support helps
counteract depression.
• Talk with people to get perspective. Negative thoughts,
according to Minter, become exaggerated when the de
pressed person is alone. Therefore, it is important to talk
things over with others in order to get a perspective to help
solve personal problems.

Whybrow said the behavioral changes can be thought of
as a human parallel to animal hibernation, in which the
body attempts to store energy for the spring.
"This behavior is probably very normal," he said. "What is
abnormal is modern society's view that everyone should be
the same all year round. But why should we? The tempera
ture changes, the seasons change; why shouldn't our bodies
change too?"
Nor are biological changes the only factors that spawn
winter depression in people, according to Richard Friend,

director of the Psychology Resource Center in Philadelphia.
Friend said psychological expectations that accompany the
holiday season can cause people to become depressed
rather than happy.
Larry Minter, director of the Humanistic Psychology Cen
ter in Philadelphia, offered the following advice to people
who are experiencing general depression:
• Encourage yourself to be active. Depressed people tend
to be inactive, but Minter advised resisting this inertia. He
added that physical activity is helpful in combating
depresive inactivity.
• Become more social. Social withdrawal often accom
panies depression. Minter said he believes it is important to
get involved with your friends, because social support helps
counteract depression.
• Talk with people to get perspective. Negative thoughts,
according to Minter, become exaggerated when the de
pressed person is alone. Therefore, it is important to talk
things over with others in order to get a perspective to help
solve personal problems.

holding three holy scrolls.
Computer literate
According to an in-house survey conducted at Rider Col
lege, students who use computers receive higher grades
than students who peck out their research papers on
typewriters, The Chronicle of Higher Education reports.
Papers written on word processors garnered an average
grade of 3.1 on the four-point scale. Typewritten papers
received an average of 2.6.
Over a college career, using a computer could mean the
difference between making the dean's list or hovering
above academic probation, said Thomas Simonet, a com
munication professor at Rider.
The study said computer-produced papers looked nicer,
were longer, and showed improved sentence structure and
idea organization.
Bring home the bacon
A two-year survey at UC-Berkeley suggests that most stu
dents still believe in a traditional marriage, in which the
husband brings home the bacon and the wife stays home
with the kids.
1 wo-thirds of the men and half of the women interviewed
said the husband's career comes first and most men said
they were unwilling to do laundry or cook dinner, The Daily
Californian reported. Only two of the 120 men interviewed
said they would be willing to relocate for their wife's job.
"Missing... from both the women and men is a sense that
joint incomes increasingly are necessary in order to main
tain a middle-class life style," the report of the survey said.
Like father, like son
"Mom and Dad might not have been such good kids after
all," according to the Indiana Daily Student, the Indiana Uni
versity newspaper.
Studies done by institutions including lU's Kinsey In
stitute for Sex, Gender and Reproduction show that sexual
habits of college students vary little from year to year.
Moreover, contrary to what most college students prob
ably think (and what their parents would undoubtedly like
them to think), the parents of today's college students were
probably just as promiscuous in college as their children
are now.
The difference is in perceptions of sex, suggests William
Yarber, professor of applied health science at lU.
"(Sex) just wasn't talked about or accepted or even
allowed by social norms (in past years)," Yarber said.
Older people may deny it. Stats show that parents don't
want their kids to know that they did it.
"Young people think that their generation invented cer

tain things," he said. ' We always think that things arc more
liberal than the older generations before us
But things really haven't changed that much over the
years.
About 25 percent of all college students surveyed in 1938
believed premarital sex was all right for both men and
women.
A 1938 book "Youth and Sex. written by free lance jour
nalists Dorothy Bromley and Florence Britten, disclosed
that college women who wished to remain virgins shared
many of the problems today s studentsface.
"The sexual mores are changing, Bromley and Britten
wrote. The terms "necking" and "petting" were already ob
solete on campuses in 193H, and there was more
widespread acceptance of the naturalness of sexual inti
macy.
"The Kinsey Report on Male Sexuality, issued in 1948,
sparked a torrent of other studies proving that college stu
dents were engaging in premarital sex.
G.M. Gilbert, professor of psychology at Princeton, noted
in a 1948 article titled "Sex on Campus," that college men
also faced dilemmas. Many debated whether to remain vir
gins or to give in to their desires. According to Gilbert, the
majority chose the latter.
Many college students today look at the 1960s as a time of
free and open sex. But statistics compiled in an Oxford Uni
versity survey show that sex is much more open today than
two decades ago.
In 1971, 37 percent of all college males were virgins. In
1984, the percentage was 28.
Similarly, in 1971, 56 percent of college women were vir
gins, while in 1984 only 43 percent were virgins.
Although researchers 50 years ago uncovered sexual
promiscuity on campus, many older adults are reluctant to
discuss details of sex in their college years.
Dorothy Fisk, an IU undergraduate in the 40s, said stu
dents then were less wild than they are in the 80s.
"Times have changed for the worse," she said. "(It was)
nothing like today."
Winter wonderland
The rain comes down. The reading and problem sets as
sociated with a 20-unit load begin to make themselves felt.
Warm memories of Christmas and the holidays fade quickly.
Basically, it's winter quarter and you're depressed as all
hell.
But don't worry. Really, don't get any more depressed
about it than you already are.
You see, it's just natural to be depressed during the win
ter months. Or so say doctors quoted in an article in The

Daily Pennsylvanian, the University of Pennsylvania paper.
According to the article, medical studies show that de
pression is common during this time of year for biological
and psychological reasons.
Peter Whybrow, chairman of Penn's Medical School Psy
chology Department, recently conducted a study of 100 nor
mal individuals in northern New England. He surveyed the
subjects for 15 months and found that in the winter, people
tend to nap more, crave carbohydrates, gain weight and be
less active than normal.
Whybrow said the behavioral changes can be thought of
