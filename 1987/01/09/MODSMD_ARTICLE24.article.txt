Albert Schweitzer in his essay, Renunciation of Thought, wrote: "The organized political,
social and religious associations of our time are at work to induce individual man not to
arrive at his convictions by his own thinking but to take as his own such convictions as
they keep ready made for him." â€” "His self confidence is also diminished through the
pressure exercised upon him by the huge and daily increasing mass of knowledge. He is
no longer in a position to take in all the new discoveries that are constantly announced;
he has to accept them as fact although he does not understand them. This being his rela
tion to scientific truth he is tempted to acquiece in the idea that in matters of thought his
judgement cannot be trusted.
Possibly humans are willing to follow the instruction of institutional leaders blindly as it
appears to offer the greatest maximization of worldly opportunity. Yet do we really wish
to be robots, regurgitating on command the data the institutions have given us? And, do
undergraduate students of physics wish to accept blindly the postulates of quantum me
chanics that renounce cause and effect asking them to accept and undeterminably
world, a situation both Einstein and Schroedinger found untenable?
In the following article I call upon your innate love of reason to commence the casting out
of a current Rube Goldberg physics that on reflection makes little sense. Consider: that
the current physics would have you believe light does not have a single identity, rather it
is sometimes particle and sometimes wave; that there is one field theory to describe the
world of macro bodies (gravity) and three different field theories (electromagnetism, nu
clear and weak fields) needed to describe micro bodies; that matter itself has no expla
nation and we must incorporate vague terms such as mass, quantum number, charge,
and.undeterminability. You can buy into this abstraction or you can think, and when you
do you will begin to recognize the folley and the following work presented by this writer
will start to make sense.

PART I - AN ERROR PHYSICISTS
MIGHT RATHER HIDE
It is not possible in this short article to both tear down and
reconstruct a full picture of a new physics that could replace our
current system. In recognition that human nature is such that often
we are unable to accept a new idea until we can discern an error
in a previously held conviction, part 1 is written to discredit current
dogma without providing new structure to replace it. In part 3 the
reader is provided with some of the building blocks of the new the
ory. However, pragmatic considerations do not allow herein a
complete discussion of all adjustments in physical law for a fully
harmonious system.
Magnetic field strength can be determined by measuring the force
on an electron beam (or current carrying wire) that is placed within
a magnetic field. The experimental derived formula is:
F <r BIL Sin 0
where, F = force
B = magnetic field strength
I = current flow
L = beam or wire length in the field
d = the angle the current flow makes with the magnetic
lines of force.
When d is 90 degrees F cc BIL. In 1856 Wilhelm Weber and
Rudolph Kohlrausch measured the proportionality constant in this
equation and found it to be equal to 1/c, where c was the velocity
of light. Following this measurement the magnetic force equation
was written:
F = BIL/c
For a while the finding of the velocity of light in the magnetic force
equation was a great mystery to physicists. However, not long
thereafter this confusion was felt to be unmuddled by Maxwell.
Maxwell's equations showed the velocity of light was the neces
sary speed of propogation for electric and magnetic fields to main
tain a steady state. Vet propogation of electromagnetic waves at
the speed of light was not the cause for the velocity of light in the
denominator of the magnetic force equation, rather it was a con
sequence of it.
Why then does a velocity term show up in the denominator of the
magnetic force equation? Assume an electron beam is turned on
and fires 3x 10 20 electrons/sec into space. 3x 10 20 elecetrons/sec
is the current in the beam, since current equals charges/sec. Fur
ther assume that the velocity of the electrons in this beam is
3xl0 9 cm/sec (10% the speed of light). Then in 1 second 3xl0 20
electrons are spread out along a line in space 3x 10 9 cm long.
Now let us further assume 10 cm of this beam passes at right
angles to the magnetic lines of force through a magnetic field. The
number of beam electrons (charges) in the magnetic field will be
given by the concentration of electrons in the beam (charges/cm)
times the length (in cm) of the beam running through the field. We
have defined the length of the beam in the field (10 cm) and we

can calculate the electron concentration in the beam by dividing
the current (charges/sec) by velocity (cm/sec) to obtain
charges/cm. Substituting values we obtain:
# of electrons in the magnetic field (v = 3xl0 9 cm/sec) equals
[3xl0 20 electrons/sec (l)/3x 10 9 cm/sec (v)] x 10 cm
10 1 Electrons
If we hold the beam intensity (I) constant, but assume the electron
velocity in the beam is now 6xl0 9 cm/sec (twice the initial
velocity), we find the number of electrons passing through our 10
cm magnetic field has become half as great.
# of electrons in the magnetic field (v = 6 x 10 9 cm/sec) equals
|3x 10 20 electrons/sec (l)/6x10 9 cm/sec (v)] x 10 cm (L) =
.sxl0 12 electrons
Physicists concluded the force on a beam moving through a mag
netic field was proportional to current intensity and beam length
within the magnetic field, since both effected the number of
moving electrons within the magnetic field at any instant.
However as has been shown above, for a given current intensity
the faster electrons travel in the beam the more spread out the
electrons become, and the fewer in a given length (L) of the beam.
That is, if the force on the beam is proportional to those terms
(intensity and beam length within the field) that increase the num
ber of electrons in the field, this same force should be inversely
proportional to velocity, which decreases the number of electrons
in the beam interval within the field. The proportionality constant
Wilhelm Weber and Rudolph Kohlrausch calculated as needed in
the denominator of the magnetic force equation was electron
velocity and this velocity was found to equal the velocity of light.
What difference does it make why a term is present as long as it is
accounted for? An electron moving at the speed of light creates
major problems for physicists. We mention two.
1. If electrons move at the speed of light they must be a form of
electromagnetic radiation. This has dire consequences for
quantum mechanics.
2. According to special relativity a particle, such as an electron,
cannot move at the speed of light at which speed it would ac
quire infinite mass. Experiments in accelerators thought to con
firm this theory would need to be re-evaluated. For physicists
who might read this article we offer a clue. What constitutes a
particle needs to be re-examined along with the abstract con
cept of mass.
An electron traveling at the speed of light is traveling 137 times
faster than the assumed orbital velocity of an electron in a ground
state hydrogen atom whose momentum (mass-velocity product)
has been accurately measured. If this electron were also moving
at the speed of light, its mass would need to be 137 times smaller
than currently assumed for its momentum to match the measured
value. The curious reader might ask, hasn't electron mass ever
been directly measured? The answer is no. Masses are never
measured directly, only implied from momentum changes.
However, J.J. Thompson was thought to have successfully mea

sured the electron charge to mass ratio in 1897. When subse
quently Robert Millikan measured electron charge 14 years later it v
was believed the electron mass could be calculated.
The problem was that J.J. Thompson began by comparing force
equations for electric and magnetic fields not knowing that the
magnetic field force equation required an electron velocity term in
its denominator. His conclusions would have been quite different
had he known. This raises a third problem for physicists. All cur
rent particle physics rests on J.J. Thompson's experiment and
subsequent deduction.
In light of the problems physicists would face if the error in the in
terpretation of the magnetic field force equation were commonly
known, it might be preferred this mistake in our physics remain
hidden.
PART 2 - BACKGROUND ON
GENERAL RELATIVITY
In Part 1 we delineated an error in the magnetic field force equa
tion and suggested electrons travel at the speed of light. Is it pos
sible to consider an electron moving at the speed of light similar to
electromagnetic radiation, and if this is true would not the electron
be a form of electromagnetic radiation? Before exploring this pos
sibility we need to provide the reader with a brief understanding of
general relativity theory.
General relativity was advanced by Albert Einstein as a field the
ory superseding the Newtonian law of gravity and is now accepted
by modern science as a more correct interpretation for observed
macro world events. Its geometric statement of space, curved
spacetime, can be described easily by an illustration.
Picture yourself on a flat golf green about to putt a ball far from the
hole. We add to your difficulty by making this golf green friction
less at the moment you putt, i.e. when you putt, if your direction is
not perfect the ball will continue past the hole and run on until off
the green on the other side. This green is analagous to a perfectly
flat space, where a body floats forever in a straight line uni
nfluenced by the space through which it moves.
Now let us change the topography of the green on which you
would putt. We retain its characteristic to turn frictionless at the in
stant you strike your ball, but shape it like a funnel with the golf
hole designating the center. We additionally make the funnel's
curvature steepest nearest the hole and decrease the curvature
as we move further from center allowing it to become almost flat at
large distances. As you putt your ball on this second green we will
assume you have lined up your putt poorly so that the ball does
not move in a straight line toward the hole. In this scenario three
alternatives are possible. You could have putted your ball slowly
allowing for the curvature of the funnel shaped green to correct for
your misdirected putt, thus bringing it to the hole. Next, you could
have putted your ball fast, so fast that the ball's speed carried it
past the hole allowing it to move to areas where the funnel was al
most flat and, thereafter, to continue on its outward journey ex
periencing negligible effects from the funnel's curvature. Lastly,
you could have putted your ball at an intermediate speed, a speed
that caused your ball to move past the hole, but not sufficiently
fast to escape the highly curved sections of the funnel. This ball
would continue to fall around the hole without ever dropping in.
Einstein described space similar to this funnel shaped golf green,
with the topography of space dependent on the distribution of mat
ter and energy contained within it. In our solar system the sun
represents a large center hole in the funnel, the planets, while also
creating their own smaller holes, additionally are golf balls falling
at intermediate speed around the central sun hole. The planets
closest the sun, where the sun's tunnel is steepest, have orbits
that are highly curved. Those planets far from the sun move in the
more open orbits characteristic of the sun's funnel at greater dis
tance.
Time enters the picture when we consider the speed at which you
putt your ball. The ball curves less when you putt fast across the
funnel green. Actually the ball's rate of fall as it crosses any point
on the funnel is independent of speed. With more speed the ball
moves much further for a given quantity of fall and its path
becomes straighter.
Einstein, in describing how a body would move through space,
needed to account for both where in the funnel the body was and
at what rate of speed the body was moving relative to any holes in
its vicinity. His simultaneous accounting for both was to stipulate a
body moves through spacetime and it is spacetime, not space that
is curved.
A second illustration may clarify Einstein's concept further. A
baseball pitcher throws a ball to his catcher. The ball moves
through the spacetime curvature present a few feet above the
earth s surface. Here it is not the sun, but the earth that is the
major contributor to the spacetime curvature in which the ball
travels. If the ball is thrown slowly, the pitcher will have to give it a
slight upward arc to allow it to cross the plate within the strike
zone. If the ball is thrown fast, it will appear to move in a perfectly
straight line, although we know, if the catcher moved much further
back, the ball would eventually fall to the ground no matter how
fast a mortal pitcher could throw it. We cannot describe the ball's
motion in terms of only space geometry. If we said only space was
curved, the curve of the ball on its flight would be independent of
velocity. A fast ball and a slow ball would both curve equally
(travel along the same arc) on the way to the catcher, although the
fast ball would arrive sooner. The fusion of space and time into a
spacetime continuum was first put forth by the German math
matician Hermann Minkowski in 1907 shortly after reading his
former pupil s paper on special relativity. Einstein's great achieve
ment, and the one he was most proud of, was to recognize the
ability to describe gravitational fields in terms of the curvature of
spacetime.
Einstein s causality for the relative motion of a body in space dif
fered from the Newtonian concept developed more than 200
years earlier. In Newtonian mechanics all space was flat and a
gravitational attraction, such as provided by the sun, acted at a
distance and held the planets in their orbits. It was as if there was
an invisible rope between the sun and the planets that prevented
the planets from leaving the solar system. For Newton, a pull from
the sun caused the planets to change direction or accelerate. In
general relativity theory the planets did not experience an ac
celeration in moving around the sun, rather they moved in straight
lines in curved spacetime. To an observer outside our solar sys
tem (an observer in a different spacetime) the orbital path of the
planets would appear accelerated, since relative to the observer
they were.
We say the planets are in different spacetimes, in that the
curvature of their respective spacetimes is dependent on how far
each is from a central field (the sun). Spacetime is most curved
nearest the sun and least curved far from it. Those planets closer
to the central field undergo faster frequencies of orbit than those
planets farther from it. We can define spacetime curvature in
terms of the frequency of orbit observed; Spacetime curvature, at
a point in space, is given by the frequency of orbit an entity located
at said point and under the influence of a field experiences, as de
termined by an observer not under the influence of the field.
Before we leave this part we note how Einstein's general relativity
theory effects the path of light through spacetime. Newtonian
gravity could not exert a force on the massless entity light
(F = GminWr 2 ) and, therefore, could not curve its path. If,
however, spacetime is curved, then light which has finite velocity
must be effected when traveling through it. Predicting starlight's
curvature when passing near the sun was one of the proofs of
general relativity theory. In weak fields this curvature is so slight
as to go unnoticed owing to lights remarkable speed. In part 3 we
look at what happens to light when it is captured in highly curved
spacetimes where enormous frequencies of orbit are manifested.
PART 3 - THE PROTON AND THE ELECTRON
There is a single hypothesis on which the following is based: "All
forms of energy are equivalent."
This equivalence of energy hypothesis is not new. It was used by
Louis DeÃŸroglie in 1924 and resulted in his receiving a Nobel
Prize in physics. DeÃŸroglie combined Planck's energy equation,
E = hf (where h is Planck's constant and 112 is wave frequency),
with Einstein's mass/energy equation, Eo = moc 2 (where Eo is rest
energy, mo rest mass and c the velocity of light), and the electro
magnetic wave equation, k = c/f, to obtain the matter wave equa
tion, X = h/mv. Below we conduct a slightly different combination
of these same equations.
If spacetime is curved, then displacements in spacetime can be
represented by curved lines, and velocity, given as the change in
displacement with time (Av/At) should be expressible in terms of
curved spacetime. We find velocity can alternatively be expressed
geometrically as v = 7rDf, where v, the velocity of a body, is given
by the circumference of a circle times the frequency or number of
revolutions per second of the body moving around the circle. Here
displacement is given by a circle circumference times the number
of such circumferences transversed in unit time. The geometrical
expression (v = 7rDf) for velocity is familiar. It is a variation on the
formula, v = rw, where v (velocity) is given by the radius (r) of a
circle times the angular velocity (w) in radians per unit time. It is in
teresting to note that for linear (straight line) motion the velocity
formula, v = 77-Df, requires 7tD go to infinity and 112 go to zero.
We now take the above geometric formula for velocity and substi
tute it into Einstein's equation for the rest energy of a particle.
Eo = moc 2 where mo equals rest mass and c equals the
velocity of light.
Eo = moc x c
Eo = m o c x 7rDf, where v = c = irDf.
Here rest energy is defined by a particle of mass mo traveling at
the speed of light in a circle of circumference nD and making 112 rev
olutions per second. We could begin here to call this particle a
photon, since only photons are said to be capable of moving at the
velocity of light.
Readers familiar with the constraints imposed by special relativity
may be uncomfortable with a particle, described in terms of its rest
mass, traveling at the speed of light. Furthermore, there is the
confusion of calling this particle a photon, when photons are said
to have zero rest mass. These apparent contradictions will be
cleared up as we proceed and the dubious reader is asked to bear
with us a little while.
We have a new energy equation, Eo = moC7rDf. In looking at this
equation we quickly note that this equation contains simultane
ously particle (given by mo or moc) and wave (given by 112) compo
nents. When mo is the rest mass of a proton, we can calculate Eo
employing Einstein's equation, Eo = moc 2 . Calling on our hypothe
sis (all forms of energy are equivalent) we substitute this value for
Eo into the photon energy equation, E = hf. Knowing E and h we
obtain a value for 112. We now have values for mo, E (we no longer
differentiate between Eo and E), and 112 which we can substitute into
our new equation (E = moC7rDf) to obtain a value for nD. In doing
this, we obtain a value for nD of 1.32 x 10 13 cm, which we define to
be the circumference of a photon we assign to be a proton. We
also state this value to be the wavelength of a proton.
Since E = hf and E = moC7rDf, h, a constant, must equal moC7rD.
As E decreases 112 must decrease, since the term moCxrD is a con
stant. If 112, the revolutions per second made by a photon moving at
a constant velocity c decreases, then rrD, the circle circumference
must increase. However, as it is necessary that moC7rD stay con
stant, the term moc must now be decreased. Since c is a constant,
only mo can decrease. We decrease mo by dividing it by a new
term 6, and our energy equation becomes:
E = mo/0 x C7rDf or E = moC7rDf/0
In place of the constant mass term mo, we have a new variable
mass term mo/0, that depends on 7rD, the photon orbit. At large
ttD values, 0 is large and m o /0 is small. E will reach a maximum
value for a 0 of 1. 0 is 1 when the photon orbit is equal to
1.32x10" 13 cm, the proton circumference or proton wavelength.
For photons moving in almost straight line paths (7tD very large),
such as the path light takes near the surface of the earth, 0 will be
very large and mo/0 will be close to zero. This is consistent with
our inability to measure effective masses for photons moving in
flat spacetimes. A photon acquires a measureable effective mass
only when in a tight orbit, where it undergoes rapid orbital frequen
cies relative to an observer.
It is important to recognize that the equation, E = moCn-Df/0, while
defining the energy of a photon is additionally defining the energy

of a particular spacetime curvature, where ttD is the orbit of the
curvature, 112 the frequency, and moc/0 the effective momentum.
Up to this point we have, by virtue of deriving a new energy equa
tion, only been able to discern light's dual nature and predict zero
photon effective mass in flat spacetimes. It is in what follows we
gain empirical support that the new equation is consistent with a
model of an electron as electromagnetic radiation as proposed in
part 1.
It was shown that as energy decreased in the new equation,
E = moC7rDf/0, frequency was decreased an equal amount and
this could occur only by increasing the orbit term ttD. For instance,
if E was cut to 1/2 its initial value, 112 would drop to 1/2 its initial value
causing 77-D to double. In order to maintain a constant moC7rD(h) it
was then found necessary to add the 0 term, which would in this
case take on the value 2. What if we keep dropping the value of E
until which time 112 was decreased to the point where 7rD had in
creased, becoming the value 3.32xlo*Â®cm? This ttD value is
2.515x10 5 larger than the derived photon orbit describing the
proton. For this value of ttD the term 0 would need to equal
2.515 x 10 5 . We also note, that the radius of a circle of orbit size
3.32x10" B cm would be 5.29x10" 9 cm, a value equal to the dis
tance of a ground state electron from the proton field in a hydro
gen atom. In our equation this would predict a new effective mass
(given by mo/0) or a new orbital momentum (given by moc/0),
where mo remains the proton rest mass. We find the orbital mo
mentum predicted by the equation, for a photon 5.29x1CF 9 cm
from the proton field, exactly matches the observed orbital mo
mentum of a ground state hydrogen electron.
Predicted Electron Orbital Momentum = m o c/0
where,
m 0 = m p = rest proton = 1.67x10" 24 g
c = velocity of light = 3.0 x 10 10 cm/sec
0 = electron orbit/proton orbit = 2.515 x 10 5
moc/0 = 1. cm/sec
Observed Electron Orbital Momentum = m o v_
" C
where,
m e = rest mass electron = 9.1 x 1 Cf 28 8
v e = orbital velocity electron = 2.19x10 B cm/sec
m e v e = 1-99x10" 19 g.cm/sec
The importance of the foregoing is our ability to predict electron
orbital momentum from working with a proton. The only connec
tion with the electron was in allowing the orbit of a photon, describ
ing a proton, to increase to the point it coincided with an orbit
whose radius was equal to the electron's distance from the proton.
From the above we might conclude the electron and the proton
are photons, or electromagnetic energy, in different orbits.
However, the electron described by our new equation while
matching the observed orbital momentum of a ground state
electron, does not match up with current accepted values for
electron mass and electron orbital velocity. The electron predicted
by our new equation has an effective mass given by mo/0
(mo = proton rest mass, 0 = 251,500), or 6.64x10 30 g, a value of
137 times less than the current assumed electron mass. And, our
predicted electron has an orbital velocity equal to the speed of
light, a value 137 times greater than the assumed electron orbital
velocity. It is here we propose the problem was in J.J. Thompson's
calculation of electron mass. As shown in Part 1, this mass value
rested on a faulty interpretation of the magnetic field equation.
In terms of momentum, the new equation can be written:
E = pvrDf/0 where p/0 is effective particle momentum
We began with the geometric formula for velocity (v = 7rDf and
c = 7rDf when v = c). The nD term in this expression implies circu
lar orbits. However, we could have written, v = orbit size times fre
quency (and c = orbit size times frequency when v = c). If we
equate orbit size to wavelength (X), as did Bohr, we can rewrite
our equation once more;
E = pXf/0 = p77"Df/0 when X = ttD
It is appropriate to now define 0. 0 is the actual photon orbit
divided by the minimum photon orbit, where the minimum photon
orbit is the proton circumference or the proton wavelength
(1.32x10" 13 cm).
PART 4 - SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES
WITH ROHR THEORY
It might be inferred that our proposition for a reordering of contem
porary physics is way out in left field compared with current the
ory. Actually, our work is closely tied to early work in quantum
theory and it is only with the advent of quantum mechanics, with
its faithful underminability requirement, that we diverge from
modern theory.
In 1913, Niels Bohr provided science with a mathematical descrip
tion for the position of radiation spectral lines in a hydrogen atom.
In Bohr's theory, the electron was thought to be a particle traveling
in a circle (or elipse, if we include Sommerfeld's contribution). Ac
cording to Bohr Theory, the electron could have only certain
values for its angular momentum, which was given by:
I
L = nh/27r
Where
L = angular momentum
n = principle quantum number
h = Planck's constant
27t = circle circumference divided by circle radius
Bohr Theory worked well to explain some of the spectral lines of
the hydrogen atom. Unfortunately, Bohr Theory did not define all
the observed spectra. For example, between n = 1 and n=2, there
were other lines Bohr Theory could not account for. To accommo
date the spectra of more complex atoms, and even the spectra of
the hydrogen atom, quantum mechanics was born. In quantum
mechanics an electron has a probability associated with its posi

tion and it is said to be undeterminable where the electron might
be at any moment. A very convenient theory when you are trying
to explain the unexpected, such as why unaccountable spectral
lines show up.
Let us rearrange the Bohr equation above:
L = nh/27r or pr = nh/27r, where p equals electron momentum
p277f =nh and h = p7rD/n
If we now multiply this h term by frequency, we obtain:
E = hf = p-n-Df/n
We now compare this equation with our equation developed in
Part 3:
E = p\f/0 = p7rDf/0 for circular orbits where A = ttD
The equations look almost identical, but there are two distinct dif
ferences. The first is that n and 0 are not identical, the second con
cerns the interpretation each is accorded.
In the Bohr equation, n is a whole number minimum value is 1.
Bohr said n was 1 when the electron was in its ground state orbit,
7iD = 3.32x1CT B cm (r = 5.29x10" 9 cm). In the new equation, oisa
whole number whose minimum value is also 1. However, our
derivation showed 0 is 1 when the photon orbit was equal to the
circumference of a proton, a value we derived to be 1.32 x 10~ 13 cm
(r = .21 x KPcm). When the electron is in the ground state orbit of
a hydrogen atom, 0 has a value of 251,500.
Why is there a discrepancy between the values of n and 0 in
Bohr's and our theory? Bohr looked at the electron and proton as
distinct entitles, unrelated except for their apparent attraction.
Bohr observed the spectral lines of a hydrogen atom and des
cribed them in terms of the possible electron orbits. The lowest or
bit became n =1. He had no reason to believe there was a lower
orbit.
In part 3 we derived an energy equation based on the geometry of
spacetime and linked this geometrical expression to a proton. We
then found when we allowed the orbit of our geometrical expres
sion for energy to increase, from the size of a proton to which it
had been fitted to the size of the electron orbit, that the effective
momentum term (p/0) in the geometrical equation (E = pAf/0)
matched precisely with the ground state hydrogen electron orbital
momentum. While Bohr's equation with its large unity value for n
could not account for intermediate spectral lines, the new equa
tion with its much smaller 0 unity has no problem describing inter
mediate spectral lines. It should be noted, if Bohr Theory had
been able to explain all spectral lines, non-causal quantum me
chanics would not have been born.
More importantly, we differ from Bohr Theory in basic concept. For
Bohr, the electron was a particle in orbit. In the Bohr atom, one
could literally pluck the electron out of its orbit. In our proposed
theory, the electron is not a little sphere revolving around a central
point, rather the entire orbit describes the particle we call an
electron. It is not a particle in a box we discern, it is the box. More
precisely, the orbit describes a spacetime curvature (a frequency
of orbit) existing at the orbit. For instance, the planet Mercury or
bits the sun in 88 days, while the Earth requires 365 days to com
plete its orbit. The frequency of orbit of the planet Mercury, by
reason it can complete its orbit in less time, is greater than the fre
quency of orbit of planet Earth. We say spacetime is more curved
in Mercury's orbit. Similarly the electron's spacetime has a
curvature that results in a particular frequency of orbit. This fre
quency of orbit is given by a photon moving in the orbit we state to
be the electron's distance from the proton field. A proton's
spacetime has greater curvature and is represented by a photon
moving in an orbit the circumference of which is the proton.
Bohr Theory postulated the centripetal force required to make a
hydrogen electron move in an orbit is provided by the proton. Ac
cording to the laws of physics, all accelerated charges must
radiate electromagnetic waves. Since the Bohr particle-like
electron, in orbit around the proton was accelerating, it should
radiate electromagnetic waves. In that it didn't exhibit observable
radiation, Bohr maintained that certain orbits, given by his equa
tion for whole numbers of angular momentum, were special. Bohr
electrons were not governed by physical law for accelerated
charges when in these special orbits.
In the new theory there is no centripetal force acting on the
electron. The electron is described by a photon moving in orbital
or circular spacetime similar to the planets. All accelerated
charges must radiate electromagnetic waves, but our photon de
scribing an electron is not accelerating, it is moving in a straight
line in circular spacetime.
In the late 1920'5, Bohr and Einstein began a series of debates or
dialogues on quantum mechanics, Bohr siding with the new the
ory and Einstein diametrically opposing it. The scientific conflict
between these two illustrious men may have prevented either
man from attempting the incorporation of the other's work into
their own. The author feels if either had conducted this amalgama
tion of theories, the energy equation derived in Part 3 would have
been conceived.
â€¢
Our new equation has been put forth as a photon energy equa
tion. Alternatively, the new equation represents the energy associ
ated with curved spacetime, where protons and electrons are
manifested as distinct highly curved spacetimes. A neutron, while
not presented here, can be similarly shown to consist of two parti
cles, each twice the orbital size of a proton, describing two highly
curved but opposing spacetimes curvatures.
For want of a brief description of matter we provide the following;
Matter is the aggregation of highly curved spacetimes.
All the work herein has been drawn from a few sections in the au

We close with a reflection provided by Albert Einstein. "Concepts
that have proved useful in the constitution of an order of things
readily win such an authority over us that we forget their earthly
origin and take them to be changeless data. Such concepts then
become stamped as necessities of thought, as given a priori; so
that the path of scientific progress becomes impassable for a long
period."
