Albert Schweitzer in his essay, Renunciation of Thought, wrote: "The organized political,
social and religious associations of our time are at work to induce individual man not to
arrive at his convictions by his own thinking but to take as his own such convictions as
they keep ready made for him." â€” "His self confidence is also diminished through the
pressure exercised upon him by the huge and daily increasing mass of knowledge. He is
no longer in a position to take in all the new discoveries that are constantly announced;
he has to accept them as fact although he does not understand them. This being his rela
tion to scientific truth he is tempted to acquiece in the idea that in matters of thought his
judgement cannot be trusted.
Possibly humans are willing to follow the instruction of institutional leaders blindly as it
appears to offer the greatest maximization of worldly opportunity. Yet do we really wish
to be robots, regurgitating on command the data the institutions have given us? And, do
undergraduate students of physics wish to accept blindly the postulates of quantum me
chanics that renounce cause and effect asking them to accept and undeterminably
world, a situation both Einstein and Schroedinger found untenable?
In the following article I call upon your innate love of reason to commence the casting out
of a current Rube Goldberg physics that on reflection makes little sense. Consider: that
the current physics would have you believe light does not have a single identity, rather it
is sometimes particle and sometimes wave; that there is one field theory to describe the
world of macro bodies (gravity) and three different field theories (electromagnetism, nu
clear and weak fields) needed to describe micro bodies; that matter itself has no expla
nation and we must incorporate vague terms such as mass, quantum number, charge,
and.undeterminability. You can buy into this abstraction or you can think, and when you
do you will begin to recognize the folley and the following work presented by this writer
will start to make sense.

PART I - AN ERROR PHYSICISTS
MIGHT RATHER HIDE
It is not possible in this short article to both tear down and
reconstruct a full picture of a new physics that could replace our
current system. In recognition that human nature is such that often
we are unable to accept a new idea until we can discern an error
in a previously held conviction, part 1 is written to discredit current
dogma without providing new structure to replace it. In part 3 the
reader is provided with some of the building blocks of the new the
ory. However, pragmatic considerations do not allow herein a
complete discussion of all adjustments in physical law for a fully
harmonious system.
Magnetic field strength can be determined by measuring the force
on an electron beam (or current carrying wire) that is placed within
a magnetic field. The experimental derived formula is:
F <r BIL Sin 0
where, F = force
B = magnetic field strength
I = current flow
L = beam or wire length in the field
d = the angle the current flow makes with the magnetic
lines of force.
When d is 90 degrees F cc BIL. In 1856 Wilhelm Weber and
Rudolph Kohlrausch measured the proportionality constant in this
equation and found it to be equal to 1/c, where c was the velocity
of light. Following this measurement the magnetic force equation
was written:
F = BIL/c
For a while the finding of the velocity of light in the magnetic force
equation was a great mystery to physicists. However, not long
thereafter this confusion was felt to be unmuddled by Maxwell.
Maxwell's equations showed the velocity of light was the neces
sary speed of propogation for electric and magnetic fields to main
tain a steady state. Vet propogation of electromagnetic waves at
the speed of light was not the cause for the velocity of light in the
denominator of the magnetic force equation, rather it was a con
sequence of it.
Why then does a velocity term show up in the denominator of the
magnetic force equation? Assume an electron beam is turned on
and fires 3x 10 20 electrons/sec into space. 3x 10 20 elecetrons/sec
is the current in the beam, since current equals charges/sec. Fur
ther assume that the velocity of the electrons in this beam is
3xl0 9 cm/sec (10% the speed of light). Then in 1 second 3xl0 20
electrons are spread out along a line in space 3x 10 9 cm long.
Now let us further assume 10 cm of this beam passes at right
angles to the magnetic lines of force through a magnetic field. The
number of beam electrons (charges) in the magnetic field will be
given by the concentration of electrons in the beam (charges/cm)
times the length (in cm) of the beam running through the field. We
have defined the length of the beam in the field (10 cm) and we

can calculate the electron concentration in the beam by dividing
the current (charges/sec) by velocity (cm/sec) to obtain
charges/cm. Substituting values we obtain:
# of electrons in the magnetic field (v = 3xl0 9 cm/sec) equals
[3xl0 20 electrons/sec (l)/3x 10 9 cm/sec (v)] x 10 cm
10 1 Electrons
If we hold the beam intensity (I) constant, but assume the electron
velocity in the beam is now 6xl0 9 cm/sec (twice the initial
velocity), we find the number of electrons passing through our 10
cm magnetic field has become half as great.
# of electrons in the magnetic field (v = 6 x 10 9 cm/sec) equals
|3x 10 20 electrons/sec (l)/6x10 9 cm/sec (v)] x 10 cm (L) =
.sxl0 12 electrons
Physicists concluded the force on a beam moving through a mag
netic field was proportional to current intensity and beam length
within the magnetic field, since both effected the number of
moving electrons within the magnetic field at any instant.
However as has been shown above, for a given current intensity
the faster electrons travel in the beam the more spread out the
electrons become, and the fewer in a given length (L) of the beam.
That is, if the force on the beam is proportional to those terms
(intensity and beam length within the field) that increase the num
ber of electrons in the field, this same force should be inversely
proportional to velocity, which decreases the number of electrons
in the beam interval within the field. The proportionality constant
Wilhelm Weber and Rudolph Kohlrausch calculated as needed in
the denominator of the magnetic force equation was electron
velocity and this velocity was found to equal the velocity of light.
What difference does it make why a term is present as long as it is
accounted for? An electron moving at the speed of light creates
major problems for physicists. We mention two.
1. If electrons move at the speed of light they must be a form of
electromagnetic radiation. This has dire consequences for
quantum mechanics.
2. According to special relativity a particle, such as an electron,
cannot move at the speed of light at which speed it would ac
quire infinite mass. Experiments in accelerators thought to con
firm this theory would need to be re-evaluated. For physicists
who might read this article we offer a clue. What constitutes a
particle needs to be re-examined along with the abstract con
cept of mass.
An electron traveling at the speed of light is traveling 137 times
faster than the assumed orbital velocity of an electron in a ground
state hydrogen atom whose momentum (mass-velocity product)
has been accurately measured. If this electron were also moving
at the speed of light, its mass would need to be 137 times smaller
than currently assumed for its momentum to match the measured
value. The curious reader might ask, hasn't electron mass ever
been directly measured? The answer is no. Masses are never
measured directly, only implied from momentum changes.
However, J.J. Thompson was thought to have successfully mea

sured the electron charge to mass ratio in 1897. When subse
quently Robert Millikan measured electron charge 14 years later it v
was believed the electron mass could be calculated.
The problem was that J.J. Thompson began by comparing force
equations for electric and magnetic fields not knowing that the
magnetic field force equation required an electron velocity term in
its denominator. His conclusions would have been quite different
had he known. This raises a third problem for physicists. All cur
rent particle physics rests on J.J. Thompson's experiment and
subsequent deduction.
In light of the problems physicists would face if the error in the in
terpretation of the magnetic field force equation were commonly
known, it might be preferred this mistake in our physics remain
hidden.
PART 2 - BACKGROUND ON
GENERAL RELATIVITY
In Part 1 we delineated an error in the magnetic field force equa
tion and suggested electrons travel at the speed of light. Is it pos
sible to consider an electron moving at the speed of light similar to
electromagnetic radiation, and if this is true would not the electron
be a form of electromagnetic radiation? Before exploring this pos
sibility we need to provide the reader with a brief understanding of
general relativity theory.
General relativity was advanced by Albert Einstein as a field the
ory superseding the Newtonian law of gravity and is now accepted
by modern science as a more correct interpretation for observed
macro world events. Its geometric statement of space, curved
spacetime, can be described easily by an illustration.
Picture yourself on a flat golf green about to putt a ball far from the
hole. We add to your difficulty by making this golf green friction
less at the moment you putt, i.e. when you putt, if your direction is
not perfect the ball will continue past the hole and run on until off
the green on the other side. This green is analagous to a perfectly
flat space, where a body floats forever in a straight line uni
nfluenced by the space through which it moves.
Now let us change the topography of the green on which you
would putt. We retain its characteristic to turn frictionless at the in
stant you strike your ball, but shape it like a funnel with the golf
hole designating the center. We additionally make the funnel's
curvature steepest nearest the hole and decrease the curvature
as we move further from center allowing it to become almost flat at
large distances. As you putt your ball on this second green we will
assume you have lined up your putt poorly so that the ball does
not move in a straight line toward the hole. In this scenario three
alternatives are possible. You could have putted your ball slowly
allowing for the curvature of the funnel shaped green to correct for
your misdirected putt, thus bringing it to the hole. Next, you could
have putted your ball fast, so fast that the ball's speed carried it
past the hole allowing it to move to areas where the funnel was al
most flat and, thereafter, to continue on its outward journey ex
periencing negligible effects from the funnel's curvature. Lastly,
you could have putted your ball at an intermediate speed, a speed
that caused your ball to move past the hole, but not sufficiently
fast to escape the highly curved sections of the funnel. This ball
would continue to fall around the hole without ever dropping in.
Einstein described space similar to this funnel shaped golf green,
with the topography of space dependent on the distribution of mat
ter and energy contained within it. In our solar system the sun
represents a large center hole in the funnel, the planets, while also
creating their own smaller holes, additionally are golf balls falling
at intermediate speed around the central sun hole. The planets
closest the sun, where the sun's tunnel is steepest, have orbits
that are highly curved. Those planets far from the sun move in the
more open orbits characteristic of the sun's funnel at greater dis
tance.
Time enters the picture when we consider the speed at which you
putt your ball. The ball curves less when you putt fast across the
funnel green. Actually the ball's rate of fall as it crosses any point
on the funnel is independent of speed. With more speed the ball
moves much further for a given quantity of fall and its path
becomes straighter.
Einstein, in describing how a body would move through space,
needed to account for both where in the funnel the body was and
at what rate of speed the body was moving relative to any holes in
its vicinity. His simultaneous accounting for both was to stipulate a
body moves through spacetime and it is spacetime, not space that
is curved.
A second illustration may clarify Einstein's concept further. A
baseball pitcher throws a ball to his catcher. The ball moves
through the spacetime curvature present a few feet above the
earth s surface. Here it is not the sun, but the earth that is the
major contributor to the spacetime curvature in which the ball
travels. If the ball is thrown slowly, the pitcher will have to give it a
slight upward arc to allow it to cross the plate within the strike
zone. If the ball is thrown fast, it will appear to move in a perfectly
straight line, although we know, if the catcher moved much further
back, the ball would eventually fall to the ground no matter how
fast a mortal pitcher could throw it. We cannot describe the ball's
motion in terms of only space geometry. If we said only space was
curved, the curve of the ball on its flight would be independent of
velocity. A fast ball and a slow ball would both curve equally
(travel along the same arc) on the way to the catcher, although the
fast ball would arrive sooner. The fusion of space and time into a
spacetime continuum was first put forth by the German math
matician Hermann Minkowski in 1907 shortly after reading his
former pupil s paper on special relativity. Einstein's great achieve
ment, and the one he was most proud of, was to recognize the
ability to describe gravitational fields in terms of the curvature of
spacetime.
Einstein s causality for the relative motion of a body in space dif
fered from the Newtonian concept developed more than 200
years earlier. In Newtonian mechanics all space was flat and a
gravitational attraction, such as provided by the sun, acted at a
distance and held the planets in their orbits. It was as if there was
an invisible rope between the sun and the planets that prevented
the planets from leaving the solar system. For Newton, a pull from
the sun caused the planets to change direction or accelerate. In
general relativity theory the planets did not experience an ac
celeration in moving around the sun, rather they moved in straight
