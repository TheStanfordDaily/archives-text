## Students dance with famous group 
### 
Tonight and tomorrow night promise to be exciting for
anyone at Stanford interested in dance. For the first time
ever, the Lively Arts at Stanford is bringing together Stanford
dance students and community dancers in a major dance
company's production.
The company is the Nikolais Dance Theater, founded and
led by the acclaimed choreographer Alwin Nikolais. Audi
tions were held for local dancers Nov. 24, and 14 Stanford
dance students, as well as eight community members, were
fortunate enough to be selected into the program.
During the past week they have worked with Raul
Trujillo, a member of the Nikolais company, learning the
dance "Sanctum," a selection from the Nikolais company's
repertoire. The students will also work with Nikolais him
self before the piece is performed on campus tonight and
tomorrow night.
The Nikolais Dance Theater and its founder are world
renowned. Nikolais has worked as a choreographer for
more than 40 years; he began his career in 1940, when he
and his teacher were commissioned to create a ballet for

such patrons as surrealist painter Salvador Dali. It was in the
late '40s, however, that Nikolais began to truly make a name
for himself as director of the Henry Street Playhouse in New
York City. There he set to work formulating theories about
dance and developing a unique aesthetic.
Nikolais and his company, founded at the Henry Street
Playhouse, achieved international acclaim during their 1968
season at the Theater De Champs Elysee in Paris, where
Nikolais' artistic innovations attracted both fervent admira
tion and angry derision. The company's performances were
so controversial that flstfights broke out in the audience
among supporters and critics of the troupe.
Nikolais and the company have won further fame by ap
pearing on television countless times, originally on "The
Steve Allen Show," way back when. Nikolais has created
works for every major American television network, the
BBC, CBC, and for Swedish, French and German television,
as well.

A group dance from "Sanctum," the piece Stanford students will perform tonight and tomorrow night with the
acclaimed Nikolais Dance Theater.
Nikolais has won numerous awards
both here and abroad. In 1985 he
received the Samuel H. Scripps Dance
Festival Award for his lifelong contri
butions to modern dance, and the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
recently honored him with a three
year grant to develop and create new
choreographic pieces.

Nikolais often dis
guises the body
with light and
fabrics

What is it about Nikolais' work that
distinguishes him so? He takes many
risks in his pieces, often placing his
dancers within a larger theatrical con
text. He utilizes costumes, sets, slides,
lighting and narrative to create a "total
theater," a mixed-media approach
which has been widely imitated. And
yet he always retains sight of the basic

human element, which is the founda
tion of every successful dance produc
tion.
Indeed, it is with the human form
that Nikolais has shown the most strik
ing originality. He often works in an

abstract form, disguising the body with
light and fabrics, to the point where
fabric becomes an extension of the
body. He has encased his dancers in
sacks, thereby creating new organic
forms, another of his innovations that
has been greatly copied.

It is Nikolais' insistence upon
originality, what he refers to as "the
original gesture," that makes him
unique in the world of dance. His ideas
are often bizarre in their originality,
and so are distinctly recognizable as
belonging to him; choreographers in
fluenced by him are often forced to
defend themselves against charges of
plagiarism because his influence is so
noticeable.
For all his artistry, though, Nikolais
is no ivory tower artist, as his works
have been praised for the fact that they
never fail to intrigue the audience. He
offers everyone something to relate to,
and yet his works are not so immedi
ately accesible that they could ever be
called simplistic. He strikes a welcome
balance between that which is enter
taining and that which is challenging
and mysterious, a commendable feat
for any artist who wishes his works to
be seen by the public.
Only one piece will be repeated in
Memorial Auditorium tonight and the
next evening, "Sanctum," so both
nights' audiences can see members of
the Stanford community as well as stu
dents on stage. The Nikolais Dance
Theater has a record of going over very
well with audiences, and it will not be
too surprising if this weekend's
Memorial Auditorium performances
conclude with standing ovations.
A reception for students will be held
following tonight's performance.
