## Students dance with famous group 
### 
Tonight and tomorrow night promise to be exciting for
anyone at Stanford interested in dance. For the first time
ever, the Lively Arts at Stanford is bringing together Stanford
dance students and community dancers in a major dance
company's production.
The company is the Nikolais Dance Theater, founded and
led by the acclaimed choreographer Alwin Nikolais. Audi
tions were held for local dancers Nov. 24, and 14 Stanford
dance students, as well as eight community members, were
fortunate enough to be selected into the program.
During the past week they have worked with Raul
Trujillo, a member of the Nikolais company, learning the
dance "Sanctum," a selection from the Nikolais company's
repertoire. The students will also work with Nikolais him
self before the piece is performed on campus tonight and
tomorrow night.
The Nikolais Dance Theater and its founder are world
renowned. Nikolais has worked as a choreographer for
more than 40 years; he began his career in 1940, when he
and his teacher were commissioned to create a ballet for

such patrons as surrealist painter Salvador Dali. It was in the
late '40s, however, that Nikolais began to truly make a name
for himself as director of the Henry Street Playhouse in New
York City. There he set to work formulating theories about
dance and developing a unique aesthetic.
Nikolais and his company, founded at the Henry Street
Playhouse, achieved international acclaim during their 1968
season at the Theater De Champs Elysee in Paris, where
Nikolais' artistic innovations attracted both fervent admira
tion and angry derision. The company's performances were
so controversial that flstfights broke out in the audience
among supporters and critics of the troupe.
Nikolais and the company have won further fame by ap
pearing on television countless times, originally on "The
Steve Allen Show," way back when. Nikolais has created
works for every major American television network, the
BBC, CBC, and for Swedish, French and German television,
as well.
