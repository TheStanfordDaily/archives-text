# A
						'Morning After' to be forgotten

"The Morning After" would seem
to have a lot going for it. Although
I've never been particularly fond of
Jane Fonda's monotonous perfor
mances, I've always liked the easy
going affability that Jeff Bridges proj
ects in his acting. With Sidney Lumet
("Dog Day Afternoon," "Network"
and"The Verdict") at the helm as di
rector, one would think that a film
with these two stars would prove to
be an interesting concoction. But the
only thing interesting about "The
Morning After" is how flat it is. A hap
hazard screenplay by one James
Hicks slipped into the mix, and the
resulting movie is rather curiously a
suspense thriller with no suspense
and no thrills.
It looks like Jane Fonda was
purposely trying to find a movie that

would show people she could act as
well as do leg lifts. It also appears
that she was trying to find a vehicle
that would shed her indelible on
screen image as the type of woman
who's always aware of her prin
ciples, who's always fighting for a
cause and who's always in control of
her life and her emotions.
Fonda has played this same role
over the years in such films as
"Julia," "Coming Home," "The China
Syndrome" and "Agnes of God." Her
performances, while good, lack a
sense of risk or of danger and seem
bland in retrospect.
"The Morning After" is Fonda's
first real attempt to shake her estab
lished image, and she gets an 'A' for
effort. She plays Alex Sternbergen, a
fading actress and alcoholic whose
life and emotions are wildly out of
control. Unfortunately, Fonda tries
too hard in playing the bewildered

drunk and, as a result, turns in a per
formance that's both overacted and
overmannered. Stick to aerobics
videos, Jane.
The movie is not all Fonda s fault,
though. She should have read Hicks'
screenplay more carefully before
she signed on the dotted line. It
starts out on an interesting enough
premise: A hungover Alex wakes up
one morning next to a stiff who has a
knife protruding from his chest.
Since she blacked out, Alex can't re
member what happened the night
before, how she got there, or if she
killed the guy.
It's from this point that writer
Hicks apparently ran out of ideas of
what to do with this setup. What fol
lows are a bunch of unconvincing
plot twists and phony coincidences
involving Fonda's chance meeting

Jeff Bridges and Jane Fonda may look intense in the above scene from"The Morning After," but there's
almost no chemistry between the two. In fact, there's almost no chemistry anywhere in this movie.
