# A 						'Morning After' to be forgotten
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
"The Morning After" would seem
to have a lot going for it. Although
I've never been particularly fond of
Jane Fonda's monotonous perfor
mances, I've always liked the easy
going affability that Jeff Bridges proj
ects in his acting. With Sidney Lumet
("Dog Day Afternoon," "Network"
and"The Verdict") at the helm as di
rector, one would think that a film
with these two stars would prove to
be an interesting concoction. But the
only thing interesting about "The
Morning After" is how flat it is. A hap
hazard screenplay by one James
Hicks slipped into the mix, and the
resulting movie is rather curiously a
suspense thriller with no suspense
and no thrills.
It looks like Jane Fonda was
purposely trying to find a movie that

would show people she could act as
well as do leg lifts. It also appears
that she was trying to find a vehicle
that would shed her indelible on
screen image as the type of woman
who's always aware of her prin
ciples, who's always fighting for a
cause and who's always in control of
her life and her emotions.
Fonda has played this same role
over the years in such films as
"Julia," "Coming Home," "The China
Syndrome" and "Agnes of God." Her
performances, while good, lack a
sense of risk or of danger and seem
bland in retrospect.
"The Morning After" is Fonda's
first real attempt to shake her estab
lished image, and she gets an 'A' for
effort. She plays Alex Sternbergen, a
fading actress and alcoholic whose
life and emotions are wildly out of
control. Unfortunately, Fonda tries
too hard in playing the bewildered

drunk and, as a result, turns in a per
formance that's both overacted and
overmannered. Stick to aerobics
videos, Jane.
The movie is not all Fonda s fault,
though. She should have read Hicks'
screenplay more carefully before
she signed on the dotted line. It
starts out on an interesting enough
premise: A hungover Alex wakes up
one morning next to a stiff who has a
knife protruding from his chest.
Since she blacked out, Alex can't re
member what happened the night
before, how she got there, or if she
killed the guy.
It's from this point that writer
Hicks apparently ran out of ideas of
what to do with this setup. What fol
lows are a bunch of unconvincing
plot twists and phony coincidences
involving Fonda's chance meeting

Jeff Bridges and Jane Fonda may look intense in the above scene from"The Morning After," but there's
almost no chemistry between the two. In fact, there's almost no chemistry anywhere in this movie.
with a bigoted hick (Bridges), who
turns out to be an ex-cop and who
helps her get to the truth of the matter.
Bridges has proven in the past that
he's particularly adept at playing good
ol' boys, so this role is no real stretch
for him. Actually, however, his charac
ter of Turner Kendall is one of his least
down-to-earth roles (even less so than
his alien in "Starman'). Aside from
being a racist, Turner is also a book
collector and an amateur archeologist.
He also has the uncanny ability to pop
out of the shadows and appear from
around corners, always in the nick of
time to save our befuddled heroine.
One might have thought the mis
matched pairing of Fonda and Bridges
would be interesting casting, but this
movie does nothing more than show
just how mismatched these stars are.
There is no chemistry generated be
tween them, and nothing they say or
do makes you care about them, their
plight or their movie.
<jn the basis of "Network" alone,
I've come to expect a lot from director
Lumet, but maybe I'm expecting too
much. Many of his recent movies (like
the impotent "Power") have been dis
satisfying duds. "The Morning After" is
definitely not his comeback film,

Jane Fonda tries a change of pace in"The Morning After," playing an
alcoholic has-been actress. She should have stuck to aerobics instructing.
