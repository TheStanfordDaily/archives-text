## Wyman recipient of Pop Warner award Joins Henley to play in Shrine Game 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Stanford linebacker David Wyman, who will
play for the West squad in tomorrow's East-West
Shrine Game at Stanford Stadium (noon starting
time), was named Wednesday as the winner of
the 1986 Glenn "Fop"' Warner Memorial Award,
given to the top senior in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
The Cardinal's Thomas Henley will join Wyman
on the West roster as a wide receiver.
The 6-foot-2, 235-pound Wyman earlier had
been named to several All-America teams, includ
ing The Sporting News' first team and the
honorable mention squads of the Associated
Press, United Press International and The Football
News. He was also a member of the All Pac-10 first
team.
Wyman became the 38th recipient of the "Pop"
Warner Award, which is named for the former
Cardinal coach, and the fifth player from Stanford
to be so honored. F.ach of the other four Cardinal
players to win the award played on offense: quar
terbacks Jim Plunkett, Guy Benjamin and John El
way, and wide receiver Ken Margerum.
Wyman led the Cardinal with 169 tackles this
season. His finest performance came in Stanford's
seventh game of the season. Against USC, Wyman
collected a career-high 27 tackles and intercepted
a Trojan pass as well.
Wyman's career almost came to an end during
the second-to-last game of his junior season.
Playing at Arizona, he suffered a severe knee in

jury that forced him to miss Big Game in 1984 and
the entire 1985 season.
Following a redshirt season of rehabilitation,
Wyman returned to his aggressive style of play
this season and, as a fifth-year senior, became the
acknowledged leader of a defensive unit that was
in large part responsible for the Cardinal's suc
cess.
Henley began his Stanford career as a running
back in 1983. After gaining 698 yards rushing in
three seasons, he was moved to wide receiver last
spring, and this season he caught 28 passes for
431 yards, good for All Pac-10 honorable mention
honors.
The 5-11, 183-pound native of Ontario made
his greatest impact as a return specialist, where
he earned first-team All Pac-10 laurels. Henley
broke the oldest mark in the Stanford record
book when he returned a punt 92 yards for a
touchdown against Oregon.
Tomorrow's game, which benefits the crippled
and burned children in Shriners' hospitals, marks
the 62nd East-West game. Several of this year's
top collegiate players will be on the field as this is
being considered one of the most talent-laden
groups of seniors in recent years to play in the
game.
Among the players whom pro scouts will be
watching besides Wyman and Henley are guard
Jeff Bregel and safety Tim McDonald of USC, de
fensive tackle Reggie Rogers of Washington, run
ning backs D.J. Dozier (Penn State) and Terrence
Flagler (Clemson), center Gregg Rakoczy of
Miami and ASU quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst.
