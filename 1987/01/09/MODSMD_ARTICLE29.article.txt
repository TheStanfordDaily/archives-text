# Card rallies behind Lichti for win over Washington
## Stanford 3-2 in Pac-10 following 82-77 victory 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
There may be times this season when Stan
ford will be lacking in size or quickness, but
one thing the Cardinal will never come up
short in is heart.
Facing a big first-half deficit and an even
bigger Washington front line, Stanford rallied
to post an 82-77 victory over the Huskies last
night at Maples Pavilion.
The win moved Stanford into a fifth-place
tie in the Pacific 10 Conference with a 3-2
record, 9-5 overall. Washington fell to 2-1 in
the Pac-10, 8-6 overall.
Todd Lichti shook off a cold first half to lead
Stanford with 24 points, 18 in the second
stanza. Lichti started the game at forward, but
played most of the second half at guard. His
forward spot was taken by sophomore Bryan
McSweeney, who responded with 13 points,
including six straight in the game's final two
and a half minutes that turned a tie game into
a 77-71 Stanford lead.
For the first 19 minutes, however, it didn't
look like any second-half heroics would make
a difference, as the Huskies simply dominated
the Cardinal inside.
They may not be Ralph Sampson and
Akeem Olajuwon, but Washington's center
power forward combination of 7-foot Chris
Welp and 6-10 Phil Zevenbergen are as close
to the Twin Towers as anything the Pac-10 has
to offer.
The Husky pair constantly outmuscled the
back line of Stanford's 1-2-2 zone to score 26
points on 12-of-17 shooting, leading Washing
ton to a 41-28 lead with 1:30 to go in the first
half.
A blowout seemed imminent, but the Card
inal got back into the game by scoring seven
consecutive points to close within six at the
half. "As big a key as anything was the end of
the first half," Stanford Coach Mike

Montgomery said. "We were at the point
where it could have been a breaking point.
The second half brought two major differ
ences from the first — the Stanford defense
and Lichti. The Cardinal came out of its zone
and played aggressive man-to-man, pressur
ing the Huskies' guards and fronting Welp
and Zevenbergen to deny the pass into the
low post.
"In the first half, they threw the ball inside
at will and got easy hoops," said point guard
Terry Taylor, who scored 10 points and
dished out 10 assists before fouling out. "The
guards had to sag in and try to deflect the ball.
That's why I got five fouls."
Zevenbergen still scored 11 points in the
second half to finish with a game-high 25, but
was forced to shoot from the outside. Welp
tallied only seven of his 19 in the final 20
minutes before fouling out with 37 seconds to
The biggest factor in the second half,
however, was Lichti. The 6-4 sophomore hit
only two of seven shots in the first half for a
measly six points. But the second half was his.
Montgomery wanted to get his star going
early, and Lichti responded, opening the
second half with a play specifically designed
to get him the ball down low. It worked for
two free throws.
Lichti then snatched a rebound, one of his
game-high 12, and started a fast break that
resulted in a Taylor three-pointer. After an
other Washington miss, Lichti buried an 18-
footer from the left side. In just 3:13 of basket
ball, Stanford had rattled off 14 straight points
and led 42-41.
The Huskies nosed back in front 59-56 with
8:35 left, but Lichti again sparked a Cardinal
rally. First, he hit a free throw. After a Zeven
bergen basket, Lichti fed Wright for a layup
and followed two Washington free throws
with a three-pointer that brought Stanford to
within one.

Then he brought the house down.
After deflecting a pass, Lichti ran the ball
down and managed to tiptoe down the left
sideline. Reaching full speed near midcourt
with two Huskies on his heels, Lichti veered
toward the basket and threw down a thun
derous two-handed dunk.
It was 64-63 Stanford, time out Washington,
and 5,842 people in a frenzy.
"When they took the time out, that gave us
an extra pump of adrenaline," Montgomery
said.
For the half, Lichti hit five of six from the
floor, seven of eight from the line and yanked
down eight rebounds. "He's got enough tal
ent that he can score at any time,'
Montgomery said. "He really went to work."
Welp tied the game at 71 with three
minutes left, but then it was McSweeney who
went to work. His jumper, two free throws
and layup on consecutive possessions staked
Stanford to a six-point lead with 1:27 to go.
Washington never got closer than three.
Known normally for his rebounding and
defense, McSweeney was looking for his shot
last night. "Coach told me this week he
wanted me to be more of an offensive threat,"
McSweeney said. "It's always fun to play of
fense. My high school coach would laugh if he
heard I was a defensive player."
The Cardinal will try to make a sweep of the
Washington schools when it hosts Washington
State tomorrow at 7:35 p.m. The Cougars are
currently 2-1 in the Pac-10, 6-5 overall, after
being blasted last night, 92-58, at California.
Although Washington State does not figure
to stay near the top of the Pac-10 for long, it
does boast a victory over UCLA this year. "That
was a big, big win for Washington State,"
Montgomery said.
Like the Huskies, the Cougars also boast a
strong front line, with forwards Brian Quin
nett (17.9 points per game) and Joe Wallace
(16.7) and center Dwayne Scholten (14.3).

The Husky pair constantly outmuscled the
back line of Stanford's 1-2-2 zone to score 26
points on 12-of-17 shooting, leading Washing
ton to a 41-28 lead with 1:30 to go in the first
half.
A blowout seemed imminent, but the Card
inal got back into the game by scoring seven
consecutive points to close within six at the
half. "As big a key as anything was the end of
the first half," Stanford Coach Mike

Montgomery said. "We were at the point
where it could have been a breaking point.
The second half brought two major differ
ences from the first — the Stanford defense
and Lichti. The Cardinal came out of its zone
and played aggressive man-to-man, pressur
ing the Huskies' guards and fronting Welp
and Zevenbergen to deny the pass into the
low post.
"In the first half, they threw the ball inside
at will and got easy hoops," said point guard
Terry Taylor, who scored 10 points and
dished out 10 assists before fouling out. "The
guards had to sag in and try to deflect the ball.
That's why I got five fouls."
Zevenbergen still scored 11 points in the
second half to finish with a game-high 25, but
was forced to shoot from the outside. Welp
tallied only seven of his 19 in the final 20
minutes before fouling out with 37 seconds to
The biggest factor in the second half,
however, was Lichti. The 6-4 sophomore hit
only two of seven shots in the first half for a
measly six points. But the second half was his.
Montgomery wanted to get his star going
early, and Lichti responded, opening the
second half with a play specifically designed
to get him the ball down low. It worked for
two free throws.
Lichti then snatched a rebound, one of his
game-high 12, and started a fast break that
resulted in a Taylor three-pointer. After an
other Washington miss, Lichti buried an 18-
footer from the left side. In just 3:13 of basket
ball, Stanford had rattled off 14 straight points
and led 42-41.
The Huskies nosed back in front 59-56 with
8:35 left, but Lichti again sparked a Cardinal
rally. First, he hit a free throw. After a Zeven
bergen basket, Lichti fed Wright for a layup
and followed two Washington free throws
with a three-pointer that brought Stanford to
within one.

Then he brought the house down.
After deflecting a pass, Lichti ran the ball
down and managed to tiptoe down the left
sideline. Reaching full speed near midcourt
with two Huskies on his heels, Lichti veered
toward the basket and threw down a thun
derous two-handed dunk.
It was 64-63 Stanford, time out Washington,
and 5,842 people in a frenzy.
"When they took the time out, that gave us
an extra pump of adrenaline," Montgomery
said.
For the half, Lichti hit five of six from the
floor, seven of eight from the line and yanked
down eight rebounds. "He's got enough tal
ent that he can score at any time,'
Montgomery said. "He really went to work."
Welp tied the game at 71 with three
minutes left, but then it was McSweeney who
went to work. His jumper, two free throws
and layup on consecutive possessions staked
Stanford to a six-point lead with 1:27 to go.
Washington never got closer than three.
Known normally for his rebounding and
defense, McSweeney was looking for his shot
last night. "Coach told me this week he
wanted me to be more of an offensive threat,"
McSweeney said. "It's always fun to play of
fense. My high school coach would laugh if he
heard I was a defensive player."
The Cardinal will try to make a sweep of the
Washington schools when it hosts Washington
State tomorrow at 7:35 p.m. The Cougars are
currently 2-1 in the Pac-10, 6-5 overall, after
being blasted last night, 92-58, at California.
Although Washington State does not figure
to stay near the top of the Pac-10 for long, it
does boast a victory over UCLA this year. "That
was a big, big win for Washington State,"
Montgomery said.
Like the Huskies, the Cougars also boast a
strong front line, with forwards Brian Quin
nett (17.9 points per game) and Joe Wallace
(16.7) and center Dwayne Scholten (14.3).
There may be times this season when Stan
ford will be lacking in size or quickness, but
one thing the Cardinal will never come up
short in is heart.
Facing a big first-half deficit and an even
bigger Washington front line, Stanford rallied
to post an 82-77 victory over the Huskies last
night at Maples Pavilion.
The win moved Stanford into a fifth-place
tie in the Pacific 10 Conference with a 3-2
record, 9-5 overall. Washington fell to 2-1 in
the Pac-10, 8-6 overall.
Todd Lichti shook off a cold first half to lead
Stanford with 24 points, 18 in the second
stanza. Lichti started the game at forward, but
played most of the second half at guard. His
forward spot was taken by sophomore Bryan
McSweeney, who responded with 13 points,
including six straight in the game's final two
and a half minutes that turned a tie game into
a 77-71 Stanford lead.
For the first 19 minutes, however, it didn't
look like any second-half heroics would make
a difference, as the Huskies simply dominated
the Cardinal inside.
They may not be Ralph Sampson and
Akeem Olajuwon, but Washington's center
power forward combination of 7-foot Chris
Welp and 6-10 Phil Zevenbergen are as close
to the Twin Towers as anything the Pac-10 has
to offer.

back line of Stanford's 1-2-2 zone to score 26
