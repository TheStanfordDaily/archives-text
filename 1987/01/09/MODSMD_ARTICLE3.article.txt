# Jackson speech plans finalized
## Reverend to receive $8,000 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
The Black Student Union is working
to raise an $8,000 honorarium for the
Rev. Jesse Jackson for his speech
Thursday in commemoration of the
late Martin Luther King Jr.
"We think that someone of his stat
ure would significantly have an impact
on the campus understanding of what
King's dream was about and how King
fits in with what's going on on the
campus today," Black Student Union
Chair Amanda Kemp said.
According to Kemp, funding for
Jackson's speech differs from funding
of earlier talks by Dr. Ruth Westheimer
and Nicholas Daniloff because Jack
son's speech will receive monetary
support from many campus groups.
Westheimer and Daniloff each spoke
on campus last November and
received $7,500 and $8,500,
respectively.

The Speakers Bureau plans to con
tribute "about four or five thousand
dollars" to Jackson's honorarium, ac
cording to Meg Richman, director of
the Speakers Bureau.
"We can definitely give at least
$2,500," said Richman, noting that a
proposal by the Speakers Bureau to
contribute more than $2,500 requires
approval by the ASSU Senate. The next
ASSU Senate meeting is scheduled for
Tuesday.
COP member Carey White said he
expects the senate to approve the pro
posal.
"The senate will look at the proposal
pretty carefully, but they'll realize that
it will be a great event," White said.
Contrary to published news reports,
Jackson never asked for an
honorarium, according to senior Steve
Phillips, former chair of the BSU.
