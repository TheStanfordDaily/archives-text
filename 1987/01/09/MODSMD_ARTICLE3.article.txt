# Jackson speech plans finalized
## Reverend to receive $8,000 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
The Black Student Union is working
to raise an $8,000 honorarium for the
Rev. Jesse Jackson for his speech
Thursday in commemoration of the
late Martin Luther King Jr.
"We think that someone of his stat
ure would significantly have an impact
on the campus understanding of what
King's dream was about and how King
fits in with what's going on on the
campus today," Black Student Union
Chair Amanda Kemp said.
According to Kemp, funding for
Jackson's speech differs from funding
of earlier talks by Dr. Ruth Westheimer
and Nicholas Daniloff because Jack
son's speech will receive monetary
support from many campus groups.
Westheimer and Daniloff each spoke
on campus last November and
received $7,500 and $8,500,
respectively.

The Speakers Bureau plans to con
tribute "about four or five thousand
dollars" to Jackson's honorarium, ac
cording to Meg Richman, director of
the Speakers Bureau.
"We can definitely give at least
$2,500," said Richman, noting that a
proposal by the Speakers Bureau to
contribute more than $2,500 requires
approval by the ASSU Senate. The next
ASSU Senate meeting is scheduled for
Tuesday.
COP member Carey White said he
expects the senate to approve the pro
posal.
"The senate will look at the proposal
pretty carefully, but they'll realize that
it will be a great event," White said.
Contrary to published news reports,
Jackson never asked for an
honorarium, according to senior Steve
Phillips, former chair of the BSU.

Jesse Jackson will speak at a student rally at noon on Jan. 19 in White Plaza. The annual BSU Â«*dly will be one of the
final activities in a weeklong Stanford commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr.
Based on Jackson's stature and histori
cal significance and on what Stanford
has paid other speakers, the BSU ar
ranged to pay Jackson an $8,000
honorarium.
Sponsors of the speech include the
President's Office, Stanford-in-
Government and Memorial Church, as
well as the BSU and the Speakers
Bureau.
Jackson's speech is one of many
events planned for next week to com
memorate the birthday of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
Jackson's visit coincides with a Fac
ulty Senate vote on the proposed al
ternative Western Culture class that
focuses on women and minorities in
the United States.
"We re concerned that the Faculty
Senate won't approve the class. We
want Jesse Jackson to comment on
moving toward a rainbow curricula
that recognizes that we're living in a
society that is majority non-white,
majority female, majority poor,
majority non-Christian and majority
non-English-speaking,'' Kemp said.
King befriended Jackson back in the
mid-1960s when Jackson was a student
at the Chicago Theological Seminary.
King was establishing "Operation
Breadbasket," an organization that
pressured Atlanta businessmen to stop
discriminatory hiring practices,
promote black workers based on merit
and do more business with black
owned firms.
King chose Jackson to run the local
division in Chicago. The two worked
together closely until King was assas
sinated in 1968.
In recent years, Jackson became best

known for his campaign for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination in 1984.
He strongly advocated a covenant with
the Democratic party that would pro
vide full parity for all elements of the
"rainbow coalition, - ' a group
composed of members of all ethnic
classes.
Jackson finished third in the race be
hind Walter Mondale and Gary Hart.
"He's probably the most significant
speaker that we have had this year.
He's a newsmaker. He is somebody
that can cause real change in America,"
White said.
According to History Prof. Clay Car
son, director of the Martin Luther King
Jr. Papers Project: "He's a major figure
on the national scene.
"It's always useful for students to see
a media figure in person so they can
draw their own conclusions about that
person," Carson said.
"Rev. Jackson continues to be a voice
of conscience within the Democratic
Party. He and his rainbow coalition
wield enormous influence," said Sub
odh Chandra, co-chairman of the Stan
ford Democrats.
"Nowadays we don't hear much
from the current administration and
media about the underclass and
minorities. People tend to think that is
sues of race ... and the civil rights
movement are issues of the past. That's
not true. They're very much issues of
the present," Chandra said.
Twelve hundred tickets for Jackson's
speech will be distributed free to Stan
ford students at White Plaza this Tues
day between 11 "a.m. and 1 p.m. Two
hundred tickets will be free to mem
bers of the public who pick them up
between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. this Wed
nesday. Three hundred tickets will be
reserved by the BSU, according to
Richman.
