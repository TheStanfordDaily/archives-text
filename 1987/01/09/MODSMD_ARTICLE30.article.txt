# Women hoops routed at UW

### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Cold, winter rains are pretty
much the norm in the Pacific
Northwest this time of year.
Nothing, however, could have
prepared the Stanford women's
basketball team for the torrential
downpour it experienced last
night in Seattle, Wash.
In a Pacific 10 Conference
matchup which figured to be
close, the Washington Huskies
did a rain dance on the Cardinal,
86-59.
The 27-point washout, Stan
ford's second consecutive loss,
dropped the Cardinal to 1-2 in
the Pac-10 and 7-5 overall.
The 9-2 Huskies, on the other
hand, have won eight con
secutive games and now sit atop
the Pac-10 alongside Oregon
with a 2-0 record. Even more im
pressive, last night's victory was
Washington's 33rd straight win
at home.
The Huskies dominated play from
the outset and, by the beginning of the
second half, had the game well under
control. Four minutes into this stanza,
Washington had already established a
22-point advantage.
Junior Lisa Oriard scored a game
high 15 points to head Washington's
balanced scoring attacks which saw
four Huskies scoring in double figures.
The freshman trio of Amy Mickelson,
Jackie Myers and Traci Thirdgill added
strong support off the bench by
scoring 11, nine and six points,
respectively. All three have received
extensive playing time this season â€” a
fact directly attributable to Washing
ton's 20 point average margin of vic
tory this year.

As a team, Stanford shot an ice-cold
39 percent from the field, but received
impressive individual performances
from sophomores Jill Yanke and Evon
Asforis, who both made four of seven
field goal attempts. Freshman Katy
Steding led Stanford scorers with 13
points and pulled down eight
rebounds to head the Cardinal in that
category as well.
Stanford will try to rebound from
this loss when it completes its two
game road swing tomorrow night

against Washington State.
The 7-3 Cougars have yet to win a
conference game this year but will cer
tainly be no walkover. Last Saturday,
Washington State played the Huskies
tough, losing by a respectable 79-71

count.
The Cardinal will have to contend
with guard Cathy Gonzales if it wishes
to break its current losing skid. The 5-
10 sophomore is scoring 17.9 points
per game for the Cougars.

Center Jill Yanke was one of only three Stanford players to shoot over 50
percent last night in the Cardinal women's basketball team's 86-59 loss at
Washington. The team shot just 39 percent on the night, though Yanke hit
4-of-7 from the floor.
