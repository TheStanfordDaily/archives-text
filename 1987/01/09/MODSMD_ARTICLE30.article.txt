# Women hoops routed at UW

Cold, winter rains are pretty
much the norm in the Pacific
Northwest this time of year.
Nothing, however, could have
prepared the Stanford women's
basketball team for the torrential
downpour it experienced last
night in Seattle, Wash.
In a Pacific 10 Conference
matchup which figured to be
close, the Washington Huskies
did a rain dance on the Cardinal,
86-59.
The 27-point washout, Stan
ford's second consecutive loss,
dropped the Cardinal to 1-2 in
the Pac-10 and 7-5 overall.
The 9-2 Huskies, on the other
hand, have won eight con
secutive games and now sit atop
the Pac-10 alongside Oregon
with a 2-0 record. Even more im
pressive, last night's victory was
Washington's 33rd straight win
at home.
