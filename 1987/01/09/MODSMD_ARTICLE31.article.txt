Coming off an intensive
holiday workout schedule, the
Stanford men's and women's
swimming teams will shift back
to more competitive gears,
traveling to Berkeley for the Cal
Invite held toda\. tomorrow and
Sunday.
The meet marks an end to a
lengthy layover and provides the
Cardinal men with an opportu
nity to learn to race," Stanford
Men's Coach Skip Kenney said.
We'll find out where we are in
our training
Besides the Golden Bears,
none of the other men's teams will be a top-20 school, Stan
ford Asst. Coach Ted Knapp said. Chico State, UC-Davis,
Hayward, Hawaii and Air Force will be among a host of West
Coast schools.
While the competition may be somewhat lacking, the
NCAA format of the meet will help the Cardinal prepare for
NCAAs this spring in Austin, Texas. According to Knapp,
each event will have preliminaries and finals. The 200-meter
events, normally excluded in dual-meet competition, will
also be added, which "gives guys the chance to swim their
event twice," Knapp said.
Extra swimming opportunity has, indeed, been a recur
rent theme for the men of late. Many of the swimmers may
enter a little broken after the "swim vacation," but the

strong performances turned in during the final days of
Christmas training are a positive sign for Knapp.
"Looking back on it (Christmas training), we had a lot
more intensity than we should have. We didn't quite get the
quality we wanted," Knapp said. "We later cut down the
yardage a little, and the guys bounced back real good."
Knapp hopes to see seniors Jeff Kostoff, Pablo Morales
and freshman John Witchell qualify for the NCAAs this
weekend. The current NCAA qualifying procedure allows a
swimmer to qualify for all his respective events with only
one NCAA qualifying swim, a new rule that relieves some of
the pressure at season's end. Presently, only juniors Anthony
Mosse and Sean Murphy have qualified for NCAAs.
Freshman freestyle standout, Lunn Lestina, may not com
pete due to a sore shoulder.
The Cardinal women trained long hours as well over the
break and, thus, will not be in top form. "We just came off
intense training also," junior Jennifer Pokluda said. "We're
pretty torn down."
