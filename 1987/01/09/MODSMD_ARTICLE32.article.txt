"If you're looking for exciting enter
tainment, take a look at the women's
gymnastics team," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina said. "We're so much
better than last season, and we're
excited."
Last year was somewhat of a chal
lenge for the Cardinal, which finished
the season in Fifth place at the NCAA
West Regional. This winter should be
different. "Our ultimate goal is to
finish in the top two in the regionals,"
Sardina said^

Stanford squad, one of the largest in
the country, have the depth and ability

prominence.

record for uneven parallel bars with an
impressive score of 9.7,

talented. "Dina Amoroso doesn't seem
to have a weakness," Sardina said.
"Susan Banta is g(x>d on several pieces
of equipment and was a top-ranked

that could place in the NCAAs this season.
returns from a two-year hiatus in Paris, as does Beth Pope,
who redshirted in 1986 due to a knee injurs'.
Others to watch include co-captains Alison McGann and
Cheryl Doo, the MVPs from 1985 and 1986, respectively.
"Cheryl is a good tumbler and great to watch," Smith said.
"Alison is one to watch because she's so graceful.
"Sheri Evenson is a fantastic vaulter and is doing fabulous
tricks on the floor," he added. "Beth Pope's vault is out
rageous, and Jinny Rhee has powerful bars."
Uneven bars is probably the event to watch this season.
"There are a lot of high-quality tricks to see and high power
routines," Smith said. "On bars watch everybody."
The spirit this year is clearly different than last season. Ac
companying the optimism is a sense of improvement. From
the daily aerobics exercises to the organization of the pro
gram, change seems to be a buzz word this year.
Sardina noted two ingredients in his recipe for success.
"No. 1, we have good talent. No. 2, Sam Shaw joined the
coaching staff."

Shaw, a former All-America and NCAA vaulting champion
in 1974 and 1976, comes to Stanford after coaching club
teams.
Also joining the staff is Smith, a fifth-year senior majoring
in Urban Studies and a four-year competitor on the Cardinal
men's squad. In addition, choreographer Nancy Roach, part
of the Olympic team staff, also begins her first year at Stan
ford.
Another change this year is season tickets for women's
gymnastics. The first home meet is Jan. 23, when the Card
inal hosts Alberta, and Sardina hopes that the team can at
tract a good crowd for the meet and for the remaining com
petitions.
Sardina's goals for the season are surprising. Unlike most
coaches, Sardina's primary drive is not for victories. "My
goal is that I want to give anyone who wants to participate in
the program a chance.
"If anyone in the gym is working hard, it is part of the
educational process. We owe it to those young people to
give them the opportunity to compete," Sardina added.
"We're not concerned with wins and losses," he contin
ued. "We want to give everyone some experience. Winning
is working up to your potential. When we put our best team
on the floor, we will compete with any team in the nation."

returns from a two-year hiatus in Paris, as does Beth Pope,
who redshirted in 1986 due to a knee injurs'.
Others to watch include co-captains Alison McGann and
Cheryl Doo, the MVPs from 1985 and 1986, respectively.
"Cheryl is a good tumbler and great to watch," Smith said.
"Alison is one to watch because she's so graceful.
"Sheri Evenson is a fantastic vaulter and is doing fabulous
tricks on the floor," he added. "Beth Pope's vault is out
rageous, and Jinny Rhee has powerful bars."
Uneven bars is probably the event to watch this season.
"There are a lot of high-quality tricks to see and high power
routines," Smith said. "On bars watch everybody."
The spirit this year is clearly different than last season. Ac
companying the optimism is a sense of improvement. From
the daily aerobics exercises to the organization of the pro
gram, change seems to be a buzz word this year.
Sardina noted two ingredients in his recipe for success.
"No. 1, we have good talent. No. 2, Sam Shaw joined the
coaching staff."

Shaw, a former All-America and NCAA vaulting champion
in 1974 and 1976, comes to Stanford after coaching club
teams.
Also joining the staff is Smith, a fifth-year senior majoring
in Urban Studies and a four-year competitor on the Cardinal
men's squad. In addition, choreographer Nancy Roach, part
of the Olympic team staff, also begins her first year at Stan
ford.
Another change this year is season tickets for women's
gymnastics. The first home meet is Jan. 23, when the Card
inal hosts Alberta, and Sardina hopes that the team can at
tract a good crowd for the meet and for the remaining com
petitions.
Sardina's goals for the season are surprising. Unlike most
coaches, Sardina's primary drive is not for victories. "My
goal is that I want to give anyone who wants to participate in
the program a chance.
"If anyone in the gym is working hard, it is part of the
educational process. We owe it to those young people to
give them the opportunity to compete," Sardina added.
"We're not concerned with wins and losses," he contin
ued. "We want to give everyone some experience. Winning
is working up to your potential. When we put our best team
