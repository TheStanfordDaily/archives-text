abilities.'" Combine this with the words
"talent" and "enthusiasm," and a
picture of the Stanford women's gym
nastics team — which opens its season

"If you're looking for exciting enter
tainment, take a look at the women's
gymnastics team," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina said. "We're so much
better than last season, and we're
excited."
Last year was somewhat of a chal

the season in Fifth place at the NCAA
West Regional. This winter should be
different. "Our ultimate goal is to
finish in the top two in the regionals,"

to have a weakness," Sardina said.
"Susan Banta is g(x>d on several pieces
of equipment and was a top-ranked
high school athlete last year.
"The sleeper is Marietta Frey," he
added "Look for her on the uneven
bars."
