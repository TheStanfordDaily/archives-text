# Men's gymnastics in rebuilding year
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Sometimes you have to go a long
way to travel a very short distance.
This philosophy can be seen
clearly in the plans of Stanford
Men's Gymnastics Coach Sadao
Hamada as he leads his team into its
first real meet of the season tomor
row at UC-Davis. It will be a season
where the program will continue to
be among the nation's best,
knowing all along, however, that all
its work will really be in prepara
tion for a serious run at the NCAA
championship next year.
The Cardinal made a similar run
last winter behind the leadership of
two of the nation's top collegiate
gymnasts, John Louis and Randy Be
sosa. Louis ended up the season
and his Stanford career as the NCAA

individual champion. Besosa had a
disappointing NCAA championship
but was among the country's top
five competitors throughout Stan
ford's dual-meet schedule and for a
few weeks was No. 1.
In addition to Louis, the Cardinal
also lost co-captain Gary Smith to
graduation. However, with Besosa
coming back and with as many
strong freshman as any team in the
nation the outlook was good for
this winter.
But, thought Hamada, what if Be
sosa redshirts, the freshmen are
given a year of experience and
everyone is brought back for the
1987-1988 year?
This seemed a surer, if more con
fusing, way to the top and so, bar
ring phenomenal progress by the

gymnasts in these early weeks, Besosa
will be redshirting Meanwhile, led by
juniors Chuck Gerardo and Mike Mat
zek, this edition of Cardinal gymnastics
will be fighting for a ranking in the na
tion's top-10 schools and a berth in the
NCAAs in April at UCLA
According to Hamada, all this means
the program will be taking a step back,
but it could also mean a step from No.
3 in the nation last year to No. 1 in the
nation next year. For now, the Cardinal
is concerned with tomorrow's six-team
meet and the three weeks of training
which will follow until the competitive
season really gets underway Feb. 1.
"By then we need to be at about 90
percent, and we must maintain that
and progress to around 95 percent un
til the NCAAs,' Hamada said. ' Right
now we are at about 70 percent.
Hamada said the team isn't quite
where he thought it would be at this
point due in great pan to injuries to
Matzek and two of the freshmen, Con
rad Voorsinger and Adam Forman. For
man's injured shoulder has kept him
out of the gym for some time, but Mat
zek and Voorsinger will be competing
tomorrow, though not at full strength.

Stanford's sophomores Andy Ropp
and Scott Schaffer both "look good"
according to thc'r coach, although
Schaffer did not train for this meet,
after coming back from Christmas
break "out of shape.''
The competition will be stiff at
Davis. Besides last year's NCAA
champion Arizona State Sun Devils, a
much-improved Fullerton State is also
expected to give an impressive effort.
Rounding out the field will be Davis,
San Jose State and California.
Both the Sun Devils and Bears have
had their top gymnasts leave school to
commit themselves full time to train
ing for the 1988 Summer Olympics.
Dan and Dennis Hayden, whose thrill
ing routines epitomized ASU's dazzling
championship performance last
spring, are both now members of the
U.S. National Team.
Cal's John Omori, while not on the
national team, also expects to be in the
running for an Olympic appearance at
Seoul, South Korea, and so gave up his
final year of eligibility.
Nevertheless, the Sun Devils boast
excellent specialists in most events.
Fullerton's new prize is Li Xiao Ping,
the world pommel horse champion
and a member of China's national
team.

Sometimes you have to go a long
way to travel a very short distance.
This philosophy can be seen
clearly in the plans of Stanford
Men's Gymnastics Coach Sadao
Hamada as he leads his team into its
first real meet of the season tomor
row at UC-Davis. It will be a season
where the program will continue to
be among the nation's best,
knowing all along, however, that all
its work will really be in prepara
tion for a serious run at the NCAA
championship next year.
The Cardinal made a similar run
last winter behind the leadership of
two of the nation's top collegiate
gymnasts, John Louis and Randy Be
sosa. Louis ended up the season
and his Stanford career as the NCAA

individual champion. Besosa had a
disappointing NCAA championship
but was among the country's top
five competitors throughout Stan
ford's dual-meet schedule and for a
few weeks was No. 1.
In addition to Louis, the Cardinal
also lost co-captain Gary Smith to
graduation. However, with Besosa
coming back and with as many
strong freshman as any team in the
nation the outlook was good for
this winter.
But, thought Hamada, what if Be
sosa redshirts, the freshmen are
given a year of experience and
everyone is brought back for the
1987-1988 year?
This seemed a surer, if more con
fusing, way to the top and so, bar

will be redshirting Meanwhile, led by
juniors Chuck Gerardo and Mike Mat
zek, this edition of Cardinal gymnastics
will be fighting for a ranking in the na
tion's top-10 schools and a berth in the
NCAAs in April at UCLA
According to Hamada, all this means
the program will be taking a step back,
but it could also mean a step from No.
3 in the nation last year to No. 1 in the
nation next year. For now, the Cardinal
is concerned with tomorrow's six-team
meet and the three weeks of training
which will follow until the competitive
season really gets underway Feb. 1.
"By then we need to be at about 90
percent, and we must maintain that
and progress to around 95 percent un
til the NCAAs,' Hamada said. ' Right
now we are at about 70 percent.
Hamada said the team isn't quite
where he thought it would be at this
point due in great pan to injuries to
