# Men's gymnastics in rebuilding year

Sometimes you have to go a long
way to travel a very short distance.
This philosophy can be seen
clearly in the plans of Stanford
Men's Gymnastics Coach Sadao
Hamada as he leads his team into its
first real meet of the season tomor
row at UC-Davis. It will be a season
where the program will continue to
be among the nation's best,
knowing all along, however, that all
its work will really be in prepara
tion for a serious run at the NCAA
championship next year.
The Cardinal made a similar run
last winter behind the leadership of
two of the nation's top collegiate
gymnasts, John Louis and Randy Be
sosa. Louis ended up the season
and his Stanford career as the NCAA

individual champion. Besosa had a
disappointing NCAA championship
but was among the country's top
five competitors throughout Stan
ford's dual-meet schedule and for a
few weeks was No. 1.
In addition to Louis, the Cardinal
also lost co-captain Gary Smith to
graduation. However, with Besosa
coming back and with as many
strong freshman as any team in the
nation the outlook was good for
this winter.
But, thought Hamada, what if Be
sosa redshirts, the freshmen are
given a year of experience and
everyone is brought back for the
1987-1988 year?
This seemed a surer, if more con
fusing, way to the top and so, bar

Junior Chuck Gerardo is considered to be a challenger for the national
title in the pommel horse. He will also be one of the most talented all
around performers on the team this year.
