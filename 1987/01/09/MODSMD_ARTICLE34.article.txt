# Card falls to sixth in San Diego
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
The Lady Aztec may as well be called
the Lady Spartan. The San Jose State
women are tearing up Singing Hills
Country Club to the tune of 602 and a
12-stroke lead. Their closest competi
tor after two rounds is USC at 614. The
Stanford women's golf team dropped a
notch into a sixth-place tie with host
San Diego State at 630.
U.S. International University
remained in third place with a 308 yes
terday for a 618 total. USC shot a very
respectable 305 in the second round
but was unable to gain any ground on
SJSU, which stayed hot with a 303 after
shooting 299 in the first round. Arizona
State is in fourth at 620, and UCLA is
fifth with a score of 625.
Senior Kathleen McCarthy was the
story of the day for the Cardinal as she
battled to a three-over-par 75 to give
her a 155 total. She is tied for the team
lead with junior Kay Cornelius, who
followed up her opening-round 77
with a 78 yesterday. Both, however, are
still 10 shots off the individual lead.
"Kathleen scored well. She shot a
very consistent round of scrambling,"
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin said. "She
had to work really hard today
(yesterday). Nothing came easy to her
in either the first or second round.
"She wasn't striking the ball well
from tee to green. She had to make a
lot of up-and-downs," Baldwin added.
Baldwin indicated that Cornelius
saw a few chances go by the board yes
terday. "Kay had a very average
round," he said. "She didn't get into a
whole lot of trouble but missed a few
opportunities. A few more birdie putts
and the 78 could have been as low as
73."
Sophomore Clare Dolan struggled
yesterday after an opening-round 77.

She ballooned to an 88 and fell com
pletely out of contention in the individ
ual competition.
"Clare has been out for a whole year
with tendonitis in her wrist. A couple
of swing problems started to go wrong -
on the third hole after she knocked it
stiff on the first two, and it was down
hill from there," Baldwin said.
The battle for the individual lead is
up in the air. SJSU's Dana Lofland was
the only player to make par yesterday
with a 72. That score combined with a
73 the day before leaves her just a
stroke ahead of ASU's Pam Wright, who
fired back-to-back 735. At 148 is Spar
tan Anne Jones, and a stroke behind
her are USC's Cathy Mockett and Helen
Alfredsson of USIU.
This tightly knit group has made the
individual race more of a contest than
the battle for the team crown.
"San Jose State is playing tremen
dous golf," Baldwin said. "This is a dif
ficult course, and they're having a
whale of a tournament.
"The pair of 315s we shot are not up
to our capabilities," he added. "These
five players we have are excellent.
We're hoping to fire it up tomorrow
(today). If we play a little better, we're
hoping to slip into third or fourth
place. If the five all play well we can do
it."
The Singing Hills Country Club,
which has two 18-hole courses, is
owned by Stanford graduate Steve
Horrell, a member of the athletic
board. Baldwin did not hesitate in
giving the tournament course a fine
review.
"As well as being difficult, it is a gor
geous golf course. It's down in a little
canyon right off Interstate 8," he said.
So far that little canyon has been an
abyss for everyone except San Jose
State.

whale of a tournament.
"The pair of 315s we shot are not up
to our capabilities," he added. "These
five players we have are excellent.
We're hoping to fire it up tomorrow
(today). If we play a little better, we're
hoping to slip into third or fourth
place. If the five all play well we can do
it."
The Singing Hills Country Club,
which has two 18-hole courses, is
owned by Stanford graduate Steve
Horrell, a member of the athletic
board. Baldwin did not hesitate in
giving the tournament course a fine
review.
"As well as being difficult, it is a gor
geous golf course. It's down in a little
canyon right off Interstate 8," he said.
So far that little canyon has been an
abyss for everyone except San Jose
State.

Missed birdie putts cost Stanford junior Kay Cornelius a better second round
yesterday at the Lady Aztec in San Diego. Cornelius is at 155, 10 shots off
the lead heading into today's final round.
The Lady Aztec may as well be called
the Lady Spartan. The San Jose State
women are tearing up Singing Hills
Country Club to the tune of 602 and a
12-stroke lead. Their closest competi
tor after two rounds is USC at 614. The
Stanford women's golf team dropped a
notch into a sixth-place tie with host
San Diego State at 630.
U.S. International University
remained in third place with a 308 yes
terday for a 618 total. USC shot a very
respectable 305 in the second round
but was unable to gain any ground on
SJSU, which stayed hot with a 303 after
shooting 299 in the first round. Arizona
State is in fourth at 620, and UCLA is
fifth with a score of 625.
Senior Kathleen McCarthy was the
story of the day for the Cardinal as she
battled to a three-over-par 75 to give
her a 155 total. She is tied for the team
lead with junior Kay Cornelius, who
followed up her opening-round 77
with a 78 yesterday. Both, however, are
still 10 shots off the individual lead.
"Kathleen scored well. She shot a
very consistent round of scrambling,"
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin said. "She
had to work really hard today
(yesterday). Nothing came easy to her
in either the first or second round.
"She wasn't striking the ball well
from tee to green. She had to make a
lot of up-and-downs," Baldwin added.
Baldwin indicated that Cornelius
saw a few chances go by the board yes
terday. "Kay had a very average
round," he said. "She didn't get into a
whole lot of trouble but missed a few
opportunities. A few more birdie putts
and the 78 could have been as low as
73."
Sophomore Clare Dolan struggled
yesterday after an opening-round 77.

She ballooned to an 88 and fell com
pletely out of contention in the individ
ual competition.
"Clare has been out for a whole year
with tendonitis in her wrist. A couple
of swing problems started to go wrong -
on the third hole after she knocked it
stiff on the first two, and it was down
hill from there," Baldwin said.
The battle for the individual lead is
up in the air. SJSU's Dana Lofland was
the only player to make par yesterday
with a 72. That score combined with a
73 the day before leaves her just a
stroke ahead of ASU's Pam Wright, who
fired back-to-back 735. At 148 is Spar
tan Anne Jones, and a stroke behind
her are USC's Cathy Mockett and Helen
Alfredsson of USIU.
This tightly knit group has made the
individual race more of a contest than
the battle for the team crown.
"San Jose State is playing tremen
dous golf," Baldwin said. "This is a dif
ficult course, and they're having a
whale of a tournament.
"The pair of 315s we shot are not up
to our capabilities," he added. "These
five players we have are excellent.
We're hoping to fire it up tomorrow
(today). If we play a little better, we're
hoping to slip into third or fourth
place. If the five all play well we can do
it."
