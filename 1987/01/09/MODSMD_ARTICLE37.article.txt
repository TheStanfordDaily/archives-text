Cox to step down
Allan Cox, dean of the School of
Eanh Sciences for the last seven years,
announced he will relinquish his ad
ministrative responsibilities June 30 to
concentrate on research and teaching.
The dean is known around the
world as one of the pioneers on
paleomagnetism and a major con
tributor to plate tectonics theory. He is
also a co-author of a new geologic time
scale.
Next summer Cox plans to return to
Western China, where he spent the
summer of 1986 studying the tectonic
history of the Tarim craton.
After serving as vice provost during
the current quarter, Cox said, he will
"return to intensive and terminal
deaning" during the spring quarter but
plans to be on sabbatical next year,

"catching up on science and preparing
a course or two."
In a message to faculty and staff, Cox
said the status of the school is "very
good, moving rapidly to excellent." He
is impressed with the "quality of our
faculty and a growing feeling of mutual
pride and potential for collaboration.
At all levels from our newest addition
to our act've (if not hyperactive)
emeriti, our faculty are doing creative,
world-class research while maintaing
quality teaching programs."
In his letter of resignation, Cox
stated, "I happen to think that Stanford
is the most exciting university in the
world today."
He added that "at this stage in my
life, I feel I'm at a watershed where I
need to decide whether I am an ad
ministrator or a scientist and teacher."
Cox earned his three degrees at the
Univeristy of California-Berkeley, and

began his professional career with the
U.S. Geological Survey. He became a
Stanford professor of geophysics in
1967 and dean of the School of Earth
Sciences in 1979. He holds an
endowed chair, the Cecil and Ida
Green professorship of geophsyics.
He is a member of the National
Academy of Sciences, the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences and the
American Philosophical Society.
Recycling project begun
A curbside recycling project has
been launched in Stanford's faculty
and staff housing areas by Peninsula
Sanitary Service and the Stanford
Recyling Center.
Campus households whose garbage
collection is handled by the Peninsula
Sanitary Service have received a set of
three stackable recycling containers

for aluminum cans, newspapers and
glass.
Every Thursday, a specially designed
truck will collect the materials at the
curb. The service began yesterday.
The Recycling Center is no longer
under the direction of the ASSU, but it
is still entirely student run. Center co
managers, Adam LaVergue and Mary
Foxon, work closely with Peninsula
Sanitary, Stanford Operations and
Maintenance and Palo AJto Recycling to
increase the volume of waste recycled
at Stanford.
Poxon said that center staffers are
implementing an office recycling pro
gram, starting with a pilot project in a
few buildings winter quarter. The proj
ect is aimed at increasing the volume
of paper, including computer paper,
that is recycled.
Siegman receives award
Anthony Siegman, professor of elec
trical engineering, will receive the
1987 Frederic Ives Medal of the Optical
Society of America.
The Ives Medal, established in 1929
and presented annually, is the society's
highest award for overall distinction in
optics.
Siegman was cited for his "many
contributions to the field of quantum
electronics," particularly his research
on unstable resonators and mode
locked lasers, as well as for his contri
butions to the education of a genera
tion of optical scientists.
