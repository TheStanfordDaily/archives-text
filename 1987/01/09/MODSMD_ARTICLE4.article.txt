# Labs to be inspected for safety next week
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Stanford laboratories will be reviewed next
week to check whether an agreement reached
last March regarding the storage and use of hazar
dous chemicals on campus is being met, Palo Alto
Fire Chief Robert Wall said Wednesday.
Wall speculated that Stanford had "not com
pletely fulfilled" requirements that were to be
met by Jan. 1. Citing temporary laboratories and
independent research as distinguishing charac
teristics, Wall said he "understands that the nature
of the university creates more work for compli
ance (than private industry).
"Should we find they are negligent, we will
notify the district attorney," Wall said, adding,
however, that he does not feel he will find any
substantial violations.
"I know there is now an ongoing process of

upgrading (safety precaution.') at Stanford," Wall
said.
The March agreement was .-ached after Santa
Clara County Deputy District Attorney Jem' Nad
ler conducted a probe into Stanford's compliance
with county health and safety ordinances regard
ing hazardous material.
Nadler, chief of Santa Clara County's environ
mental crimes unit, launched the investigation
after a series of potentially dangerous incidents
early in the first three months of 1986 including
three spills, two leaks and an explosion of im
properly stored chemicals — raised concern
about safety in Stanford laboratories.
In a related incident, last Friday the Seely G.
Mudd Chemistry Building was evacuated when
unidentified chemicals had to be removed from a
faulty refrigerator.
In the March probe, however, "There were no
serious violations, and we decided not to prose
cute," Nadler said.

According to Nadler, a meeting was then called
in which Stanford agreed to:
• Fulfill the requirements of the Hazardous Ma
terials Safety Ordinance, which requires that the
county Health Department be supplied with in
ventory lists of hazardous materials, as well as
hazardous materials management plans detailing
precautions and use of potentially dangerous
chemicals.
• Post inventory lists outside the door of each lab
oratory in which hazardous materials are used.
• Participate in an inspection program conducted
by the Palo Alto Fire Department.
The Palo Alto Fire Department took the task of
monitoring Stanford's compliance with the agree
ment because, even though responsibility for
monitoring compliance rests with the county
health office, "They are understaffed and do not
have the manpower to properly supervise the sit
uation," Nadler said.
"It is the firemen who lav their lives on the

line," he added, noting that they "want to be sure
requirements are met."
Wall had complained during the course of the
March probe that, since 1980, his department had
found Stanford to be in violation of the state fire
code "in some of the chemical storage buildings
and labs," according to a March article in the San
Jose Mercury News.
In addition to the agreement, Wall had asked
Stanford to submit inventories of hazardous ma
terials to his office, "but to my knowledge that
hasn't been done yet," he said Wednesday.
Stanford has also not yet completed posting in
ventories outside laboratory doors, but that job is
"90 percent complete," according to Stanford
Health and Safety Director Alain Decleve, who
called it "a difficult and tedious task."
According to Decleve, the University has been
installing "life safety boxes" to meet the require-
ment. The metal containers name the
hazards present in a laboratory —
flammable, biological, radiological or
other — and contain lists of the hazar
dous materials used there and people
familiar with the laboratory who can
be contacted in an emergency.
Stanford has submitted only some of
the inventory lists and hazardous ma
terials management plans required by
ordinance, according to the county's
Office of Hazardous Materials, but
"timelines are continually moved back
and we don't expect total compliance

before two or three years," said Bob
Holston, the agency's environmental
health sanitarian responsible for the
Stanford area.
Holston called the progress in the
last year "significant," saying, "It always
should be done faster than it is accom
plished, but we have to have realistic
expectations.
"The original deadline was over a
year ago, but it was very unrealistic and
we're working on completing the most
important tasks first," he said.
Wall and Nadler agreed that the law
is cumbersome. Nadler called it a real
burden," while Wall said, "Meeting the
requirements is a real chore, it is not
an easy thing to do."
