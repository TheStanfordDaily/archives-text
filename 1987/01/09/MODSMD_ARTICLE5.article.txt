# Room reassignment causes complaints

### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
Difficulties with rescheduling rooms
for classes are causing frustration for
many professors this quarter.
Although receiving room assign
ments is difficult at the begining of
every quarter, the problem has been
even more aggravated than usual this
quarter, according to many faculty
members interviewed yesterday.
The problem of room assignments
falls into two catagories: the need to
find larger rooms for overflowing
classes, and the need to initially find
rooms for sections.
According to Prof. James Sheehan,
chairman of the History Department,
"There is always trouble at the start of
each quarter for various reasons;
classes are larger then expected, etc.
But I have a feeling that there was a sig
nificantly larger amount (of trouble)
this quarter than usual."
One professor claimed he has been
waiting over a month to receive room

assignments for his sections. History
Prof. Barton Bernstein said: "I've been
seeking room assignments for my sec
tions for over four-and-one-half
weeks.''
Bernstein blamed the problems on
lack of coordination in the Registrars
Office. "Clearly there are enough
rooms," he said.
He added that room scheduling
problems are affecting his teaching. "1
feel a slight strain because I realize that
people are uncomfortable," he said of
his overflowing classroom.
Alistair Murray, who is in charge of
Course and Classroom Coordination
for the Registrars Office, denied that
this quarter's crunch is any more
serious than usual."There is always a
problem with scheduling a room at
Stanford," he said.
"There is a shortage of suitable
rooms," he added. "Many classes need
seminar rooms, and there just aren't
enough. Also a lot of rooms aren't un
der central control. They are con
trolled by the departments, so depart
ments without rooms have greater
problems."
Murray savs that people in his de

partment are working daily toward
finding solutions to the problem. Al
though Murray said that "it would be
good having more personnel
available," he did not feel that more
people in his office would necessarily
solve the crisis.
Murray advised that students, faculty
and administrators alike learn to be pa
tient.
