# Sex becomes just a game for Residential Education

"Sexploration," an interactive game designed
to give students practice making decisions
about personal relationships and sex, has been
recently developed and intnxluced at Stanford,
according to Alice Supton, assistant dean of Res
idential Education.
The goals of the game are to provide stu
dents with creative and fun ways to explore
sexual issues and attitudes, said Douglas Daher.

Services
The game addresses problems beyond those
targeted by the Contraceptive Peer Counseling
program, operated by the Cowell Student

Health Center and established in the 19705.
"The choice of birth control is simple
compared to deciding whether you are going
to be sexually active or not," said John Dorman,
a physician and associate director of Cowell
Because of the existence of sexually trans
mitted diseases, it is especially important that
students have practice talking about their
sexual history and experience before becom
ing sexually involved," Supton said.
Daher said he found that although freshmen
seem well informed about health in general,
they are not about sex In one trial run of the
game, for example, all five students on a team
puzzled over the word "fornication."
The game is played in teams whose members

answer sexual trivia questions, engage in role
playing and discuss values in relationships and
sex The three types of questions are identified
by colored squares tin the game board.
There are six paths on which the players can
move their tokens: drugs and ajcohol, contra
ceptives, pregnancy, abortion, relationships
and sexually transmitted diseases.
At least once in a game, members of each
team are required to switch male and female
roles in a role-playing situation in order to give
each sex empathy for the point of view of the
other sex, Daher said.
The winner of the game must complete the
board and have collected a certain number of
colored chips, awarded every time a question is

answered or completed, in each category.
"Just for talking about (the role-playing and
values questions) you get a token. There is no
right answer." Supton said.
Instead of advocating any particular set of
values, the game is designed to encourage the
players to examine their own values. People
need to be reflective. That's what we're trying
to encourage,'' said Daher
The game can be checked out by RAs or stu
dent groups for students to play in their
residences or other university settings Two
game boards are currently available for student
use.
The idea for the game was originally con
ceived in the winter of 1985 by Daher, Supton,

Dorman and Doryn Davis-Chervin, director of
health promotion at Cowell.
At each step, different people contributed
their expertise to the development of the game.
In addition to the contributions of the Stanford
officials, Supton said seniors Bill I.evine and
Laura Wedemeyer spent internships develop
ing the basic structure of and questions for the
game.
Daher said he tested the game in a freshman
residence last year, sparking a revision of the
game board
The game is copyrighted in the name of the
Board of Trustees, and there is a possibility of
marketing the game to a wider audience, ac
cording to Supton and Daher.
