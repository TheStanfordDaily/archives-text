Dow Jones rises above 2,000
NEW YORK — Continuing a historic stock market rally, the Dow Jones
industrial average breached a psychological milestone yesterday by closing
above 2,000 points for the first time in its 102-vear history.
The widely followed index of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks closed at
2,002.25, a gain of 8.30 points and its fourth consecutive record close. Since
Jan. 1, the Dow index has gained more than 105 points.
"Its a milestone because round numbers intrigue everyone," said New
ton Zinder, chief market analyst for the E.F. Hutton & Co. financial house.
William LeFevre, market strategist for the Hartford, Conn.-based invest
ment firm of Advest, added, "This will bring a lot of little investors into the
market, because the publicity associated with it focuses a lot of attention on
the Dow."
Precisely because milestone numbers attract so much attention, their
crossings have often created an atmosphere of some instability. Many
professionals expect the market to pull back today and to undergo a
greater reversal later this quarter that could pare 15 percent off the Dow in
dex, dropping it back to about 1,700. Sentiment on Wall Street is that the
market would then turn upward again, at least until the Dow industrial in
dex reaches 2,500.
House approves Clean Air Act
WASHINGTON — The House, moving quickly to send a strong message
to President Reagan, voted overwhelmingly yesterday for an $18 billion bill
to clean up the nation's lakes and rivers.
The Clean Water Act, which was approved by large majorities last year by
both houses of Congress but vetoed by Reagan, now goes to the Senate,
where Republican and Democratic sponsors predict passage next week.
"This is not a partisan effort to embarrass anyone," said Rep. James
Howard (D-N.J.), who chaired the house panel that approved the legisla
tion.
"We are simply maintaining a commitment to cleaning up the environ
ment It is not partisan to want clean water."
Rep. John Hammerschmidt (R-Ark.), who also helped draw up the legis
lation, said the proposal was reintroduced because it enjoys broad, biparti
san support and because it is "environmentally responsive and fiscally re
sponsible."
Earlier this week, Reagan offered a compromise, $12 billion clean water
proposal to Congress. However, Democratic and Republican officials
denounced the proposal as inadequate, saying the anti-pollution funds
should not be cut back any further.
Yesterday, the White House criticized the House's 406-8 vote as fiscally
irresponsible.
"It's a fiscal issue, it's a spending issue pure and simple," said spokesman
Albert Brashear. "They (Congress) just can't have it both ways. They can't
deal with deficits of that size and then pass a bill which is way over budget."
Brashear said Reagan's counterproposal was "a good-faith compromise,"
and stressed that — apart from the differences in funds earmarked for
wastewater treatment plants — both bills offered the same environmental
regulatory provisions.
Brashear would not speculate on whether Reagan would veto the legisla
tion a second time, but House and Senate sponsors have predicted that
they have enough votes to override one.
ANC issues appeal to whites
LUSAKA, Zambia— South Africa's main black nationalist movement, the
outlawed African National Congress, issued a strong appeal to whites yes
terday to join it in forming "a massive democratic coalition" to end apart
heid and establish a new non-racial society in which basic freedoms would
be guaranteed.
In a major policy presentation to mark its 75th anniversary, the ANC
made a number of democratic commitments it had not spelled out fully
before. It said it stands for a multi-party democracy in which there would
be freedom of speech, assembly, association, language, religion and the
press, and no arbitrary arrests pr detentions without charges.
It also took a more conciliatory line on its conditions for negotiating
with the government of South African President Pieter Botha, saying it
would "seize any opportunity" to do so if the administration accepted the
need to create a democratic society. Previously the ANC had said it was only
willing to negotiate a "transfer of power" after winning a guerrilla war.
The 22-page statement was phrased in conspicuously moderate language
and seemed aimed at countering an intensified campaign by the Botha gov
ernment to portray the ANC as an organization of communist terrorists.
It also seemed designed to sweeten the organization's image in the
United States ahead of a scheduled meeting in Washington, Jan. 28, be
tween its president, Oliver Tambo, and U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz.
Although relations with the Reagan administration have been strained
because of the administration's policy of "constructive engagement," or
quiet efforts to persuade Pretoria to abandon apartheid, the ANC is placing
great store by the Shultz meeting. It regards it as a major diplomatic
breakthrough in its quest for greater international recognition.
KGB admits official misconduct
MOSCOW — In an extraordinary step, the KGB disclosed yesterday that
one of its senior officers in the Ukraine had been fired for plotting to cover
up the misdeeds of local party and government officials.
The admission of misconduct, written by KGB Chairman Viktor
Chebrikov, was displayed on the front page of the newspaper Pravda, the
main organ of the Communist Party Central Committee.
Publication of Chebrikov's words signaled that not even the once
sacrosanct Committee on State Security — the secret police, or KGB, its ini
tials in Russian — is immune from criticism under the anti-corruption cam
paign of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
It also fits in with Gorbachev's campaign ofglasnost, or openness, which
has resulted in the open discussion of problems that in the past were swept
under the rug.
The KGB chairman's account involved the unjustified arrest and two
week detention of a Soviet journalist who had been exposing official
wrongdoing in the Voroshilovgrad area of the Ukraine.
Chebrikov's disclosure that a local KGB man had been responsible for
the journalist's treatment contrasted with past accounts of how it was often
necessary to call in the KGB to deal with corruption when the local police
failed to do the job.
Western diplomats said that officials of the feared KGB had not come un
der public criticism since the 19505, when Lavrenti Beria was denounced,
and later executed, for his terror tactics. The 'diplomats said the self
criticism in Chebrikov's article was without precedent.
The KGB chief said in Pravda that officials of the Ukrainian division of the
KGB committed "violations of socialist legality" by persecuting a journalist.
Reagan returns to White House
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, feeling "great" but walking stiffly,
left Bethesda Naval Medical Center and returned to the White House yes
terday where he will continue his recovery from prostate surgery.
Cheering White House staffers, led by Vice President George Bush,
greeted Reagan as he arrived on the South Lawn before noon after a short
helicopter ride from the hospital in suburban Maryland.
Holding hands with first lady Nancy Reagan and smiling broadly, the
president walked more than 100 feet to his residence.
"I feel great," Reagan, who will turn 76 next month, told reporters as he
left the hospital
When asked if he was ready to go back to work, the president
responded, "Of course. I haven't stopped
On the South Lawn. Reagan briefly joked with reporters Asked what he
planned for an encore, he responded, an appendectomy."

outlawed African National Congress, issued a strong appeal to whites yes
terday to join it in forming "a massive democratic coalition" to end apart
heid and establish a new non-racial society in which basic freedoms would
be guaranteed.
In a major policy presentation to mark its 75th anniversary, the ANC
made a number of democratic commitments it had not spelled out fully
before. It said it stands for a multi-party democracy in which there would
be freedom of speech, assembly, association, language, religion and the
press, and no arbitrary arrests pr detentions without charges.
It also took a more conciliatory line on its conditions for negotiating
with the government of South African President Pieter Botha, saying it
would "seize any opportunity" to do so if the administration accepted the
need to create a democratic society. Previously the ANC had said it was only
willing to negotiate a "transfer of power" after winning a guerrilla war.
The 22-page statement was phrased in conspicuously moderate language
and seemed aimed at countering an intensified campaign by the Botha gov
ernment to portray the ANC as an organization of communist terrorists.
It also seemed designed to sweeten the organization's image in the
United States ahead of a scheduled meeting in Washington, Jan. 28, be
tween its president, Oliver Tambo, and U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz.
Although relations with the Reagan administration have been strained
because of the administration's policy of "constructive engagement," or
quiet efforts to persuade Pretoria to abandon apartheid, the ANC is placing
great store by the Shultz meeting. It regards it as a major diplomatic
breakthrough in its quest for greater international recognition.
KGB admits official misconduct
MOSCOW — In an extraordinary step, the KGB disclosed yesterday that
one of its senior officers in the Ukraine had been fired for plotting to cover
up the misdeeds of local party and government officials.
The admission of misconduct, written by KGB Chairman Viktor
Chebrikov, was displayed on the front page of the newspaper Pravda, the
main organ of the Communist Party Central Committee.
Publication of Chebrikov's words signaled that not even the once
sacrosanct Committee on State Security — the secret police, or KGB, its ini
tials in Russian — is immune from criticism under the anti-corruption cam
paign of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
It also fits in with Gorbachev's campaign ofglasnost, or openness, which
has resulted in the open discussion of problems that in the past were swept
under the rug.
The KGB chairman's account involved the unjustified arrest and two
week detention of a Soviet journalist who had been exposing official
wrongdoing in the Voroshilovgrad area of the Ukraine.
Chebrikov's disclosure that a local KGB man had been responsible for
the journalist's treatment contrasted with past accounts of how it was often
necessary to call in the KGB to deal with corruption when the local police
failed to do the job.
Western diplomats said that officials of the feared KGB had not come un
der public criticism since the 19505, when Lavrenti Beria was denounced,
and later executed, for his terror tactics. The 'diplomats said the self
criticism in Chebrikov's article was without precedent.
The KGB chief said in Pravda that officials of the Ukrainian division of the
KGB committed "violations of socialist legality" by persecuting a journalist.
Reagan returns to White House
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, feeling "great" but walking stiffly,
left Bethesda Naval Medical Center and returned to the White House yes
terday where he will continue his recovery from prostate surgery.
Cheering White House staffers, led by Vice President George Bush,
greeted Reagan as he arrived on the South Lawn before noon after a short
helicopter ride from the hospital in suburban Maryland.
Holding hands with first lady Nancy Reagan and smiling broadly, the
president walked more than 100 feet to his residence.
"I feel great," Reagan, who will turn 76 next month, told reporters as he
left the hospital
When asked if he was ready to go back to work, the president
responded, "Of course. I haven't stopped
On the South Lawn. Reagan briefly joked with reporters Asked what he
planned for an encore, he responded, an appendectomy."

Dow Jones rises above 2,000
NEW YORK — Continuing a historic stock market rally, the Dow Jones
industrial average breached a psychological milestone yesterday by closing
above 2,000 points for the first time in its 102-vear history.
The widely followed index of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks closed at
2,002.25, a gain of 8.30 points and its fourth consecutive record close. Since
Jan. 1, the Dow index has gained more than 105 points.
"Its a milestone because round numbers intrigue everyone," said New
ton Zinder, chief market analyst for the E.F. Hutton & Co. financial house.
William LeFevre, market strategist for the Hartford, Conn.-based invest
ment firm of Advest, added, "This will bring a lot of little investors into the
market, because the publicity associated with it focuses a lot of attention on
the Dow."
Precisely because milestone numbers attract so much attention, their
crossings have often created an atmosphere of some instability. Many
professionals expect the market to pull back today and to undergo a
greater reversal later this quarter that could pare 15 percent off the Dow in
dex, dropping it back to about 1,700. Sentiment on Wall Street is that the
market would then turn upward again, at least until the Dow industrial in
dex reaches 2,500.
House approves Clean Air Act
WASHINGTON — The House, moving quickly to send a strong message
to President Reagan, voted overwhelmingly yesterday for an $18 billion bill
to clean up the nation's lakes and rivers.
The Clean Water Act, which was approved by large majorities last year by
both houses of Congress but vetoed by Reagan, now goes to the Senate,
where Republican and Democratic sponsors predict passage next week.
"This is not a partisan effort to embarrass anyone," said Rep. James
Howard (D-N.J.), who chaired the house panel that approved the legisla
tion.
"We are simply maintaining a commitment to cleaning up the environ
ment It is not partisan to want clean water."
Rep. John Hammerschmidt (R-Ark.), who also helped draw up the legis
lation, said the proposal was reintroduced because it enjoys broad, biparti
san support and because it is "environmentally responsive and fiscally re
sponsible."
Earlier this week, Reagan offered a compromise, $12 billion clean water
proposal to Congress. However, Democratic and Republican officials
denounced the proposal as inadequate, saying the anti-pollution funds
should not be cut back any further.
Yesterday, the White House criticized the House's 406-8 vote as fiscally
irresponsible.
"It's a fiscal issue, it's a spending issue pure and simple," said spokesman
Albert Brashear. "They (Congress) just can't have it both ways. They can't
deal with deficits of that size and then pass a bill which is way over budget."
Brashear said Reagan's counterproposal was "a good-faith compromise,"
and stressed that — apart from the differences in funds earmarked for
wastewater treatment plants — both bills offered the same environmental
regulatory provisions.
Brashear would not speculate on whether Reagan would veto the legisla
tion a second time, but House and Senate sponsors have predicted that
they have enough votes to override one.
