# Dems fight to replace Aspin
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — As Democratic contenders with
sharply conflicting views on national defense
plunged into a bruising campaign for chairmanship
of the House Armed Services Committee, party
leaders yesterday issued a routine endorsement of
the panel's most senior member, Rep. Charles Ben
nett of Florida, for the job.
A day after House Democrats ousted moderate
chairman Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, at least four
congressmen, including both Aspin and Bennett,
launched efforts to win the prized post.
The outcome of the race is important not only be
cause the chairman will head one of the most power
ful committees in Congress, but because he will be
the House Democrats' most prominent spokesman
on defense issues.
"There are a lot of knives out on all sides,'' said
Rep. Leon Panetta of California.
Some House Democrats worried that the swirl of
dissension could weaken their voice on defense
policy at a time when President Reagan is expected to
be more vulnerable to challenge.
"It is not in the interest of our country or our party
to have all this turmoil," said Bennett.
House Democrats will not vote for a new chairman
for about two weeks, after the House returns from a
brief recess. That sets the stage for a period of non
stop intense ramnaienine bv the four leading candi

dates, which include conservative Marvin Leath of
Texas and liberal Rep. Nicholas Mavroules of Massa
chusetts.
The process was under way within minutes of
Wednesday's 124-130 secret ballot vote of no confi
dence for Aspin's two-year reign.
An aide said the deposed chairman was on the
telephone until midnight trying to recoup lost sup
port, and up again prowling the House corridors yes
terday.
In pressing his bid, Bennett was citing his nearly
four decades of House seniority. House leaders in
the Steering and Policy Committee, an arm of the
House leadership, reportedly voted 16-11 in a closed
session to formally endorse Bennett for the job.
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas) called the en
dorsement the "traditional thing ... an aa of cour
tesy" because of Bennett's seniority. But the gesture
was not considered to have crucial weight in the
race.
Wright is believed by some on Capitol Hill to be
sympathetic to his fellow Texan, Leath, whose insur
gent campaign against Aspin led to the chairman's
downfall Wednesday. Wright said he was "not greatly
surprised" at the turn of events, but added that he
would be "fair and evenhanded" in the race for the
new chairman.
Leath said that more than 50 other House Demo

crats, both liberal and conservative, were actively
helping him. His appeal is his reputation as a consen
sus maker and his promise to attempt to break
down a lot of the polarization that had developed
over the years." Aspin was criticized for his leader
ship style and for taking the committee in a more
conservative direction than some liberal members
could accept.
Even though the Armed Services Committee runs
to the conservative side, there is a decidedly liberal
bent to House Democrats as a group. Leath acknowl
edged, "I am conservative, and I expect that I always
will be." But he said that when serving on another
key House committee, the Budget Committee, We
learned we could agree with each other, we found
that liberals and conservatives could agree on any
thing."
At least some liberals, however, tried to keep the
race focused on some of the major issues that divide
them from conservatives.
Mavroules said his history of opposition to the MX
missile was a "significant factor" to be considered by
Democrats in choosing a new Armed Services chair
man. He said the race was wide open and that no can
didate could be confident of a majority. "It's not over
by a long shot, I promise you."

new chairman.
Leath said that more than 50 other House Demo

crats, both liberal and conservative, were actively
helping him. His appeal is his reputation as a consen
sus maker and his promise to attempt to break
down a lot of the polarization that had developed
over the years." Aspin was criticized for his leader
ship style and for taking the committee in a more
conservative direction than some liberal members
could accept.
Even though the Armed Services Committee runs
to the conservative side, there is a decidedly liberal
bent to House Democrats as a group. Leath acknowl
edged, "I am conservative, and I expect that I always
will be." But he said that when serving on another
key House committee, the Budget Committee, We
learned we could agree with each other, we found
that liberals and conservatives could agree on any
thing."
At least some liberals, however, tried to keep the
race focused on some of the major issues that divide
them from conservatives.
Mavroules said his history of opposition to the MX
missile was a "significant factor" to be considered by
Democrats in choosing a new Armed Services chair
man. He said the race was wide open and that no can
didate could be confident of a majority. "It's not over
by a long shot, I promise you."
