# Israeli minister calls for probe
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — An Israeli Cabinet
minister has called for an investigation
of allegations, which continued to
mount yesterday, that Israel's role in
the Iran arms deal and efforts to supply
the rebels in Nicaragua was much
deeper than officials here have main
tained.
According to a draft report of the
Senate Select Committee on Intelli
gence, new details of which were pub
lished here yesterday, Israel's attempt
to open contacts between the United
States and Iran began with a meeting
between an Israeli official, two Israeli
weapons dealers and an Iranian arms
merchant in late 1984, at least four
months before the White House re
quested Israeli help in doing so.
The confidential report directly con
tradicts Israeli claims that the Reagan

administration's Iran connection was
an American initiative in which Israel
became involved only after it was
asked for its help in April 1985 in a
meeting here between then-Prime
Minister Shimon Peres and National
Security Council consultant Michael
Ledeen.
An investigation and white paper
responding to the allegations were
called for yesterday by Amnon
Rubinstein, head of the small left-of
center Shinui party. While he has little
political leverage, his statement
marked the first time a member of Is
rael's coalition goverment has called
for such a probe.
Rubinstein said he believed the
denials of government leaders such as
Peres, who is now foreign minister,
and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. But

he said it was possible that either these
leaders "didn't get the right informa
tion" from subordinates, or Reagan ad
ministration officials — whose tes
timony before the committee is the
basis for much of the information in
the draft — had decided "that Israel
was going to be made a scapegoat."
If accurate, the report's claim adds
support to the view expressed consis
tently in the draft that the Iran arms af
fair was initiated and kept alive at criti
cal moments by Israeli officials and
arms merchants whose interests in the
matter may have differed from those of
the United States.
The four men who the report says
met in late 1984 — diplomat David
Kimche, who was then director gen
eral of the Israeli Foreign Ministry; Is
raeli weapons dealers Yaacov Nimrodi

and Al Schwimmer and Iranian arms
merchant Manucher Ghorbanifar —
later became the main actors in estab
lishing the secret arms-for-hostages ex
change that began the following fall.
These details were among several
new pieces of information from the
confidential draft reported yesterday
by Erel Ginai, the Washington corre
spondent for the Yediot Ahronot news
paper.
Kimche has denied the draft's ac
count and other Israeli officials yester
day stuck to previous statements
denying Israel had initiated the affair
and calling allegations in the draft
report "baseless" and "distorted."
Kimche was not available for com
ment yesterday.
