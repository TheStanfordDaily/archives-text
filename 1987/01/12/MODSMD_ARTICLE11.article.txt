# California reverses trend, cuts support for public education

The austerity of education provisions in Gov. George
Deukmejian's recently proposed 1987-88 California budget
signals a serious decline in the state's commitment to public
education, University scholars said yesterday.
I he governor s budget, made public Thursday, proposes
a 4 percent increase in state education spending for fiscal
1987-88, down from a 10 percent increase last year, accord
ing to Education Prof. Michael Kirst. The proposed budget
also advocates phasing out special educational programs for
gifted students, urban schools and minorities by the 1988-89
sch(X)l year.
Calling the proposed 4 percent increase in education
spending "budget gimmickry," Kirst said the governor's
budget actually reduces resources available to education.
"When you figure in inllation and the fact that 2 percent
of that 4 percent is just to pay for increased number of
pupils â€” about 100,000 every year ... you see a real cut in
real resources," he said.
Kirst, a former president of the California Board of Educa
tion, said the governor's budget proposal is a reversal of a
four-year trend in state government toward greater support
of public education.
Deukmejian ran for office "as an 'education' governor ...
[and] his first four budgets were very good," he said.
In contrast, Kirst noted, "this budget is a dramatic policy
shift.... He (Deukmejian) is shifting his stance toward fiscal
conservatism."

According to Kirst, the governor's policy shift can be at
tributed to a combination of constitutional limits on state
spending and recent declines in state tax revenues.
Kirst explained that the 1979 Gann Amendment to the
state constitution limits spending "according to population
growth, plus or minus the national consumer price index.
He argued that the amendment "has not adequately taken
into account growth in the need for government services."
The amendment's "unreasonable restrictions," combined
with a "drop in tax funds due to a sloughing off of Southern
California's defense industry," have led to a money crunch
in the state government, Kirst said.
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin offered a different per
spective, arguing that the leanness of the governor's educa
tion budget reflects "a certain concern about the sluggish
growth of the national economy."
"Last year saw very modest (economic) growth," Boskin
said. "There is concern that the state not get into a budget
deficit."
Kirst predicted that California will face tight educational
budgets "for at least three or four more years."
"This is not going to be a one-year belt-tightening," he
said of the governor's proposed budget."It looks like it's
going to be a long-term policy for the rest of the
(Deukmejian) administration.
"The only way out is to amend the constitution (to get rid
of the Gann Amendment), but if the governor opposes it, it
won't pass," Kirst said.
Deukmejian's budget proposes to
cut all funding for programs aimed at
gifted students, urban schools and
minority students. Money saved as a
result of these cuts would be used to
reduce the size of elementary school
classes.
Although Kirst agreed that there

exists "a need to rethink categorical al
lotment and direct some funds to re
ducing class size," he predicted that
the governor's proposal to eliminate
special programs would never pass the
state legislature.
Education Prof. Milbrey McLaughlin
said that in making such "categorical
distinctions" within the education
budget, Deukmejian "misses the larger
point" that the "base budget for educa
tion in California is way too low."
