### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
Friday's historic Dow Jones rally
past the 2,000 mark represents just
another day at the stock market, indi
cating continued economic growth
but not the beginning of an era, ac
cording to economics professors
here.
"The number 2,000 is usually
thought of as a barrier. I don't think
of it as significant, just more good
news," said Economics Prof. John
Taylor.
John Shoven, chairman of the Eco
nomics Department, said the 2,000
breakthrough is long overdue.
"It's about time," Shoven said,
noting that the Dow Index first
crossed the 1,000 mark back in 1972.
The Dow Jones industrial average
closed Friday at 2,002.25 after
gaining 8.30 points. The final figure
was the first above 2,000 in the mar
ket's 102-year history.
On the New York Stock Exchange,
194.5 million shares traded hands, as
rising stocks outnumbered losers by
more than two-to-one.
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin
said the Dow index should periodi
cally reach all-time highs, as the

stock market is meant to grow
through time.
The market's upswing mostly
reflects declining interest rates, Bos
kin said, adding that lower interest
rates mean a higher value for future
income, including the value of
stocks.
The stock market is not showing
speculative excesses but reflects the
growing value of U.S. companies,
Shoven said.

Economics professors generally
agree that the 2,000 landmark can be
taken as an indicator that the eco
nomy is improving. Whether or not
this improvement will continue,
however, appears more difficult to
predict.
"Professionals are no better able
to predict the market than the man
on the street," Economics Prof.
