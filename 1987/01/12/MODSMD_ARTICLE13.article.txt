### 
For all the hullabalcx) about high tech that surrounds
this place, there are a few aspects of Stanford that remain
entrenched in the Stone Age. Despite noble attempts at
computerization, long lines still await students at
registration. Although the books themselves are logged
into Socrates, checking out tomes at University libraries
is a tiresome chore. And lately, the simple task of attend
ing classes has been complicated by yet another chronic
Stanford problem: inefficient room assignment.
The quarterly migration of flocks of students and pro
fessors from one room to another in the quest for a
suitable learning environment is ridiculous and dis
ruptive. University administrators should take immediate
steps to improve the situation.
It goes without saying that cramped teaching quarters
hamper the educational process. One professor
remarked that his overflowing room adversely affects his
teaching, because he finds it difficult to lecture effec
tively when he knows that his students are
"uncomfortable." Particularly in humanities classes,
room assignments for sections — among the most per
sonal of learning experiences at Stanford — are
sometimes delayed for weeks into the quarter. Addition
ally, the crowded aisles and obstucted doorways that are
commonplace in many popular classes at the beginning
of the quarter could create huge problems in an emer
gency situation.
University administrators say there is a "shortage of

suitable rooms," especially small seminar rooms. They
also point out that the room assignment system is "not
under central control," so departments without their
own rooms have greater problems. While these are valid
points, the University can take some steps that may help
solve the problem.
Computerizing the whole process would be a start.
The University should have each room and its capacity
on a computer file, where it can be easily retrieved. That
way, when the Registrar's Office receives estimates of
class size, it can simply enter the estimates, and the com
puter will match them with the appropriate rooms. Of
course, this means that departments would have to make
fairly accurate predictions, but that shouldn't be too
much of a problem.
Departments such as history' and political science,
which have more rooms than they can use, could per
haps set aside a block of classrooms that they would al
ways need, and simply put all their other rooms into the
general University pool. If this is not feasible, the depart
ments should let the University know midway through
the quarter which rooms they plan to utilize in the up
coming quarter. Either suggestion would free up more
rooms for use by different departments.
Whatever the particulars of the solution, it is clear that
a modernization of the process is in order. The presence
of a favorable learning climate is central to Stanford's
existence.
