# Toney Anaya is no hero

A few things at Stanford are unfortunately immutable and
inviolate. The Post Office lines are unreasonably long. It
rains winter quarter. Tresidder pizza is inedible. And at least
once a quarter The Stanford Daily prints an editorial con
demning the death penalty with the same stale, faulty
reasoning we have all heard before.
The latest attack on the death penalty (Daily, Dec. 5)
lauded (fortunately, by now former) New Mexico Gov.
Toney Anaya's decision to commute the sentences of all five
men on the state's death row to life imprisonment. The
Daily praised Anaya and implied that he should "be hailed
as a national hero" or "invited to a Rose Garden reception
with President Reagan." I see no rational reason to honor a
man who thumbs his nose at his constituents, allows his reli
gion to interfere with his political duties, and double
crosses the victims' family members who waited years for
the justice system to provide retribution.

In a criminal justice system that is based on rehabilitation,
the death penalty must not be used capriciously and should
be reserved for only the most heinous and detestable
crimes. The New Mexico legislature enacted the death
penalty by a wide margin in 1979. Since then, only five
people have been condemned to death row and none has
been executed. All five were there for the hideous crimes
for which the death penalty was created. The Daily states: "A
New Mexico man saved five people's lives last week." The
Daily neglected to identify these five individuals and explain
their sordid crimes.
William Wayne Gilbert was on death row for the handgun
murders of Kenn and Noel Johnson in their Albuquerque
home. Mrs. Johnson was forced at gunpoint to sexually
abuse herself while her husband watched. Gilbert then bru
tally murdered them both. Gilbert is also serving con
secutive life sentences for the murders of his wife Carol, and
a model, Barbara McMullen. Thank you, Gov. Anaya.
Michael Anthony Guzman was sentenced to death on
April 5, 1981, for the stabbing murder of Julie Ann Jackson, a
19-year-old university student. Guzman abducted Jackson
and her 21-year-old friend Colene Bush and took them to
Tijeras Canyon. He locked Bush in the trunk of the car while
he raped and stabbed Julie Jackson. He finished by stabbing
Colene Bush more than 30 times. Thank you, Gov. Anaya.

I see no reason to honor a
man who thumbs his nose at
his constituents, allows his
religion to interfere with his
political duties, and double
crosses the family members of
victims.

Richard Reynaldo Garcia's death sentence was for the kil
ling of correctional officer Louis Jewett Jr. during a fight in
the maximum security unit of the state prison on Feb. 26,
1981 What should society do with a man who kills a prison
guard while already serving time in maximum security?
Thank you. Gov. Anaya.
Joel Lee Compton is on death row for the Feb. 24, 1983,
murder of Albuquerque policeman Gerald Cline. Cline was
shot in the chest at point-blank range in a premeditated am
bush Yolanda Cline, his wife of 12 years, is left behind along
with their three young children. Mrs. Cline cried when she
heard Gov. Anaya's decision and exclaimed. And it's just
not fair, not fair at all Mrs. Cline had planned on attending

the execution. She said, "I wanted to be there, too — a wit
ness for Gerry."
Toney Anaya stated that he consulted with a public
defender, the American Civil Liberties Union and a repre
sentative from the Catholic Church before reaching his deci
sion. He apparently chose not to consult the family or
friends of the victims. Thank you, Gov. Anaya.
Finally, Edward Lee Adams was sentenced to die for
raping and strangling 80-year-old Ola Temple in her home
on Jan. 31, 1986. Mr. Adams had been paroled 19 days ear
lier for a previous burglary and rape conviction. Thank you,
Gov. Anaya.
The Daily described Toney Anaya's decision to commute
these sentences as courageous. Had Gov. Anaya offered his
personal savings to compensate the victims of future crimes
committed by the people he saved, that would be coura
geous. It would also be courageous if Gov. Anaya had
agreed to personally serve a life sentence as an accessory to
the crime if any of the "fabulous five" ever killed again,
either on parole or by murdering a prison guard. He did
not. He was on his way out of office and had nothing to lose.
At least Rose Bird had the fortitude to face the electorate
with her convictions and let it decide. Toney Anaya's deci
sion was a slap in the face of every voter in New Mexico.

Mexico.

Toney Anaya did not commute the sentences based on
the individual merits of the five cases. It was instead a uni
lateral temporary repeal of the death penalty — the voters,
the courts and the legislature be damned. Although Gov.
Anaya's action was within his legal power, he abused that
power. The result already being discussed in the 1987
legislature is a broader death penalty law or constitutional
limitations on the right of future governors to commute
death sentences — neither of which is a particularly good
idea.
Being Roman Catholic is considered by many to be a poli
tical liability becuase many voters feel a candidate will be
unable to reconcile differences between church and state.
John Kennedy and Geraldine Ferraro both encountered op
position as their religion became a critical campaign issue.
Toney Anaya, a staunch Roman Catholic, has done little to
remove this prejudice by overturning sentences based
solely on the dictates of his conscience. Mario Cuomo may
face some tough questions if he campaigns for president in
New Mexico.
Toney Anaya's decision to indiscriminately commute the
sentences of everyone on death row was ill-conceived, arro
gant and wrong. Even death penalty opponents should
agree that for the legislature to adopt the death penalty, the
legal system to carry out that mandate responsibly, the ap
peals process to exhaust thoroughly the possibility of error,
and then ultimately to have the governor, through the
stroke of a pen, wipe out the entire process is wrong. Toney
Anaya is not a hero.
The mystery of this debacle is not why Toney Anaya made
such a dramatic gesture. His entire term as governor was
controversial. While some Stanford students were declaring
their dorm a sanctuary for Central American refugees,
Toney Anaya declared the entire state of New Mexico a sanc
tuary. With the exception of Santa Fes liberal arts and crafts
population, New Mexico is a fairly conservative state. The
mystery is how Toney Anaya got elected in the first place.
