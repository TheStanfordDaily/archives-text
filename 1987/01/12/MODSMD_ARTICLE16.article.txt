Pressure needed
for divestment
During Dead Week last quarter, the
Stanford Board of Trustees held their
regular meeting. At that meeting, it
divested Stanford of no South Africa
related stock, voting on two compan
ies that were on its agenda.
The board's continued weak and
apathetic response to the international
divestment movement contrasts
sharply with the South African govern
ment's recently heightened repression
of the non-white South African
people. While thousands more people
are jailed and harassed and tortured,
hundreds of them children 15-years
old and younger, the Stanford Board
of Trustees has decided to sit back, do
nothing, and contemplate the com
plexities of the issue. 1 for one have
had enough of the board's eternal
patience with apartheid and its
beneficiaries.
The board's patience with apart
heid's beneficiaries, however, doesn't
surprise me much, since many of its
members are closely allied with some
of those benefitting corporations. A
couple of the more blatant examples
are John Young, president of Hewlett-
Packard, and William Timkin, chair of
Timkin Corporation, one of four
non-Sullivan signatories in Stanford's
portfolio.
The board's tolerance for the rac
ism in South Africa is itself a form of
racism. The events in New York sur
rounding the death of a black man at
the hands of a group of racist whites
in Howard Beach and the subsequent
racism of the white authorities after
the attack suggest that the problem of
racism is still a critical one for our
own country as well.
South Africa is perhaps unique in
the severity of its institutionalized
racism, but it is not unique in the
existence of that racism up to the
present. Perhaps the most public
example in the Stanford community
today is the required Western Culture
sequence, which focuses largely upon
the history and writings of European
men. Constrast this with the one
quarter requirement for the "other"
90 percent of human experience. It

seems to me that divestment is not
simply a moral issue, it is also an issue
that challenges our tolerance for
racism, at home and in South Africa.
One thing that is clear to me is that
the Board of Trustees will not keep
the issue of divestment alive unless
the students and faculty maintain
pressure. This has been historically
proven. The issue has been raised
periodically by students and faculty
for the past 20 years, often very vo
cally; yet it is only in the past year,
during a relatively long period of
continuous community protest, that
the board has taken any action. I think
the prognosis is clear for any student
who supports the international push
for divestment: Here at Stanford you
will have to fight and fight hard for it.

CIR never refused
Sullivan visit
In The Daily's and other
newspapers' coverage of Chief But
helezi's presentation to the CIR, Prof.
St. Clair Drake alleges that the 1985-86
Commission on Investment Responsi
bility (CIR) refused to meet and dis
cuss divestment and/or disinvestment
with the Rev. Leon Sullivan. As chair of
the CIR last year, I can state categori
cally that no such meeting was offered
to us, nor would we have refused
such a meeting if one would have
been offered. Apart from the simple
and compelling fact that a university is
built on the free exchange of ideas
and information, the CIR would have
found a meeting with Sullivan espe
cially attractive because we were
engaged in the process of developing
policy recommendations in an area —
disinvestment — on which Rev. Sul
livan has had much to say. For both of
these reasons we would have
welcomed the opportunity to meet
with him and discuss his views: the
opportunity was never presented to
us. Prof. Drake is completely wrong
on the facts.
Last year, CIR spent about five
months crafting and debating policy
recommendations on disinvestment.
As part of that process we met with
Profs. Joel Samoff and David Aber
nethy to discuss their recommen-

dations on the subject. Those familiar
with the work of these scholars and
with Rev. Sullivan's views on the
subject of disinvestment will find a
reflection of these ideas in our report
to the Trustee's Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR). Our
report recommended that the Univer
sity use its channels of communication
with corporations doing business in
South Africa to urge them to give
serious consideration to the threat of
disinvestment as a weapon in the
struggle for political and economic
justice in South Africa. We also recom
mended that the University continue
to study the moral and political bases
of the policy of disinvestment. The
current CIR is engaged in that study;
the meeting with Chief Buthelezi was
a part of that "continuing" study.
Meeting with Buthelezi signifies noth
ing more "ominous" than a willing
ness to listen to a black South African
leader with a perspective on a subject
being considered by the CIR.

Overseas study

I am writing to express my full
agreement with Prof. Guelfo Frulla,
who in his letter to the Stanford com
munity (Campus Report, Jan. 7) urges
the administration to take a hard look
before radically changing the overseas
programs.
My husband and I have just come
back from three months in Tours and
found that the program there works
remarkably well. The staff is efficient,
competent, very hard-working and
sympathetic — in sum, outstanding in
every way. The students on the whole
are quite happy there, love Tours and
profit from their stay. When I asked
them if they had any complaints or if
they felt certain things should be
changed, they answered negatively.
The only suggestion made by some
students was that a longer preparation
in the French language would have
helped them get more out of the
program and France.

seems to me that divestment is not
simply a moral issue, it is also an issue
that challenges our tolerance for
racism, at home and in South Africa.
One thing that is clear to me is that
the Board of Trustees will not keep
the issue of divestment alive unless
the students and faculty maintain
pressure. This has been historically
proven. The issue has been raised
periodically by students and faculty
for the past 20 years, often very vo
cally; yet it is only in the past year,
during a relatively long period of
continuous community protest, that
the board has taken any action. I think
the prognosis is clear for any student
who supports the international push
for divestment: Here at Stanford you
will have to fight and fight hard for it.

CIR never refused
Sullivan visit
In The Daily's and other
newspapers' coverage of Chief But
helezi's presentation to the CIR, Prof.
St. Clair Drake alleges that the 1985-86
Commission on Investment Responsi
bility (CIR) refused to meet and dis
cuss divestment and/or disinvestment
with the Rev. Leon Sullivan. As chair of
the CIR last year, I can state categori
cally that no such meeting was offered
to us, nor would we have refused
such a meeting if one would have
been offered. Apart from the simple
and compelling fact that a university is
built on the free exchange of ideas
and information, the CIR would have
found a meeting with Sullivan espe
cially attractive because we were
engaged in the process of developing
policy recommendations in an area —
disinvestment — on which Rev. Sul
livan has had much to say. For both of
these reasons we would have
welcomed the opportunity to meet
with him and discuss his views: the
opportunity was never presented to
us. Prof. Drake is completely wrong
on the facts.
Last year, CIR spent about five
months crafting and debating policy
recommendations on disinvestment.
As part of that process we met with
Profs. Joel Samoff and David Aber
nethy to discuss their recommen-

dations on the subject. Those familiar
with the work of these scholars and
with Rev. Sullivan's views on the
subject of disinvestment will find a
reflection of these ideas in our report
to the Trustee's Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR). Our
report recommended that the Univer
sity use its channels of communication
with corporations doing business in
South Africa to urge them to give
serious consideration to the threat of
disinvestment as a weapon in the
struggle for political and economic
justice in South Africa. We also recom
mended that the University continue
to study the moral and political bases
of the policy of disinvestment. The
current CIR is engaged in that study;
the meeting with Chief Buthelezi was
a part of that "continuing" study.
Meeting with Buthelezi signifies noth
ing more "ominous" than a willing
ness to listen to a black South African
leader with a perspective on a subject
being considered by the CIR.

Overseas study
is worthwhile
I am writing to express my full
agreement with Prof. Guelfo Frulla,
who in his letter to the Stanford com
munity (Campus Report, Jan. 7) urges
the administration to take a hard look
before radically changing the overseas
programs.
My husband and I have just come
back from three months in Tours and
found that the program there works
remarkably well. The staff is efficient,
competent, very hard-working and
sympathetic — in sum, outstanding in
every way. The students on the whole
are quite happy there, love Tours and
profit from their stay. When I asked
them if they had any complaints or if
they felt certain things should be
changed, they answered negatively.
The only suggestion made by some
students was that a longer preparation
in the French language would have
helped them get more out of the
program and France.

Pressure needed
for divestment
During Dead Week last quarter, the
Stanford Board of Trustees held their
regular meeting. At that meeting, it
divested Stanford of no South Africa
related stock, voting on two compan
ies that were on its agenda.
The board's continued weak and
apathetic response to the international
divestment movement contrasts
sharply with the South African govern
ment's recently heightened repression
of the non-white South African
people. While thousands more people
are jailed and harassed and tortured,
hundreds of them children 15-years
old and younger, the Stanford Board
of Trustees has decided to sit back, do
nothing, and contemplate the com
plexities of the issue. 1 for one have
had enough of the board's eternal
patience with apartheid and its
beneficiaries.
The board's patience with apart
heid's beneficiaries, however, doesn't
surprise me much, since many of its
members are closely allied with some
of those benefitting corporations. A
couple of the more blatant examples
are John Young, president of Hewlett-
Packard, and William Timkin, chair of
Timkin Corporation, one of four
non-Sullivan signatories in Stanford's
portfolio.
The board's tolerance for the rac
ism in South Africa is itself a form of
racism. The events in New York sur
rounding the death of a black man at
the hands of a group of racist whites
in Howard Beach and the subsequent
racism of the white authorities after
the attack suggest that the problem of
racism is still a critical one for our
own country as well.
South Africa is perhaps unique in
the severity of its institutionalized
racism, but it is not unique in the
existence of that racism up to the
present. Perhaps the most public
example in the Stanford community
today is the required Western Culture
sequence, which focuses largely upon
the history and writings of European
men. Constrast this with the one
quarter requirement for the "other"
90 percent of human experience. It

seems to me that divestment is not
simply a moral issue, it is also an issue
that challenges our tolerance for
racism, at home and in South Africa.
