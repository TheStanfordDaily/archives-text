# Zeta Psi housing possible
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff 
Zeta Psi fraternity members will not
be affected by the 10-year moratorium
on fraternity housing in their attempt
to regain on-campus housing, accord
ing to Joe Pisano, fraternal affairs advi
ser.
The current moratorium affects
housing for new fraternities and was
put into effect when the Board of Trus
tees "amended the ban on sororities in
1977," Pisano said.
Because the issue with the Zetes is
regaining housing rather than getting
housing for the first time, the fraternity
is exempt from the moratorium.
"At the time (1977), it wasn't clear
what impact new fraternities would
have on campus. The board didn't
want to commit new housing or make
housing permanently unavailable to
fraternities," Pisano said.
At the same time, the trustees also
established a task force on fraternities
and sororities, which was to issue a
report recommending changes to
ameliorate problems with Greek
housing. That report is still pending.
According to Diana Conklin, assis
tant dean of Residential Education, the
rehousing agreement between the
University and the Zetes was made
before the task force began working
on the fraternity report in 1983. The
Zetes lost housing in 1981.
"Stipulations from that particular
agreement supercede the general
housing freeze," Conklin said.
Pisano said that while the task force's
report has not been completed, Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons should
respond this year to preliminary
recommendations made by the task
force in May 1984. Lyons "will set
about trying to make plans to imple
ment the recommendations" of the
task force, Pisano said.
The Zeta Psi fraternity lost University
recognition and housing privileges in
the fell of 1981 following an incident in
which a 20-year-old woman from Mills
College was thrown into a concrete
pond at the Zeta Psi residence.
The Delta Upsilon fraternity, which
lost its campus housing last year, faces
a process similar to the Zete's quest for
rehousing. Both fraternities have been
given broad-based guidelines by the
Committee on Student Services' Sub
committee on Residences, which lists
â€¢ criteria by which they will be granted
housing, Pisano said.
"Students are free to interpret and
address these criteria the way they
want," said Pisano.
The DUs will be able to petition for
recognition as a fraternity in 1989 and
rehousing in 1991, Pisano said, adding
that these dates were established "by
design" to occur after all of the frater
nity members living in the house last
year have graduated from Stanford.
Although the moratorium on
housing continues to be in effect,
Pisano anticipates that it will be lifted
by the time the DUs seek housing.
