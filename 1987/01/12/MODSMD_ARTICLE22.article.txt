## Strut and fret your hour Campus theater groups are looking for a few good players 
### TRACY FURUTANI Editorial staff 
If the play s the thing, then Stanford
is rich in things this winter.
Three theatrical companies will
begin or continue auditions today for
plays that range in pedigree from the
home-grown to the classic.
The Playwright Forum of Palo Alto
will audition for "Leader from the
Gun,'' while Stanford Savoyards will do
the same for "Princess Ida.' Tryouts for
Ram's Head's "West Side Story" will
conclude tonight.
"In one sense, it's kind of a novel
thing," said playwright John

McDonough, a Stanford graduate, of
the presentation of his work "Leader
From the Gun." The play is being
funded through the Playwright Forum
of Palo Alto, an organization formed
last year by a local playwright to
showcase locally written plays.
"Leader from the Gun concerns a
female swimmer's attempt to get onto
the 1984 U.S. Olympics Swim Team.
Apart from the swimmer's father, "who
should look about 45 years old," the
other characters are "about college
age," according to McDonough.
There are a total of six roles, two
male and four female, in the produc
tion, scheduled for presentation in

Governor's Corner the first weekend
in March.
"It would be nice if it got about 50
people to audition,'' said McDonough,
adding that he realistically expects half
that number in the Elliot Program Cen
ter Dining Room tonight.
In contrast, Stanford Savoyard's pro
duction of the Gilhert and Sullivan
operetta "Princess Ida will require an
order of magnitude more players.
"The play is difficult to produce be
cau: ? it requires 16 principal leads,
said executive producer Rita Taylor. In
addition, the actors must be able to
sing — two tenors and a "very good
soprano" are especially in demand. A
chorus of 20 men and 20 women
round out the players that will be cho
sen tonight and tomorrow night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
In addition to the actors, signups for
the orchestra and the technical crew
are also being held for this lesser
known operetta.

"It's a sort of satire of women's lib
which is a real satire by the time it gets
to us," said Taylor. "It's very funny be
cause (Gilbert and Sullivan's) particu
lar idea of women is very dated."
Still, "since it's not very well known,
we have to work to get audiences," she
conceded.
The show, to be held in Dinkelspiel

Auditorium, is scheduled for the last
weekend in April and the first
weekend in May.
About an equal number of
performers is required for the Ram's
Head production of "West Side Story."
The tale of a romance between a
gang member and a rival gang mem
ber's sister is "a classic, so it's versatile

to an extent," but the play must live up
to certain expected standards, said di
rector Ban Manning.
Already 55 people have trooped
through the first run-through for the
37 parts, according to Manning, and he
expects more tonight when auditions

conclude in Memorial Auditorium.
"Look at it as two hours to dance and
romp on a stage," said Manning to po
tential auditioners. "Just relax and have
A ooorl rime "

The show will be performed in
Memorial Auditorium April 16, 17 and
18, with final performances on April 24
and 25.
Why the seemingly sudden interest
in play production this winter?
"It allows students to see their op
tions beyond graduation. .said
McDonough. "In fact, it allows students
to see their options right now.

From the Gun." The play is being
funded through the Playwright Forum
of Palo Alto, an organization formed
last year by a local playwright to
showcase locally written plays.
"Leader from the Gun concerns a
female swimmer's attempt to get onto
the 1984 U.S. Olympics Swim Team.
Apart from the swimmer's father, "who
should look about 45 years old," the
other characters are "about college
age," according to McDonough.
There are a total of six roles, two
male and four female, in the produc
tion, scheduled for presentation in

Governor's Corner the first weekend
in March.
"It would be nice if it got about 50
people to audition,'' said McDonough,
adding that he realistically expects half
that number in the Elliot Program Cen
ter Dining Room tonight.
In contrast, Stanford Savoyard's pro
duction of the Gilhert and Sullivan
operetta "Princess Ida will require an
order of magnitude more players.
"The play is difficult to produce be
cau: ? it requires 16 principal leads,
said executive producer Rita Taylor. In
addition, the actors must be able to
sing — two tenors and a "very good
soprano" are especially in demand. A
chorus of 20 men and 20 women
round out the players that will be cho
sen tonight and tomorrow night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
In addition to the actors, signups for
the orchestra and the technical crew
are also being held for this lesser
known operetta.

"It's a sort of satire of women's lib
which is a real satire by the time it gets
to us," said Taylor. "It's very funny be
cause (Gilbert and Sullivan's) particu
lar idea of women is very dated."
Still, "since it's not very well known,
we have to work to get audiences," she
conceded.
The show, to be held in Dinkelspiel

Auditorium, is scheduled for the last
weekend in April and the first
weekend in May.
About an equal number of
performers is required for the Ram's
Head production of "West Side Story."
The tale of a romance between a
gang member and a rival gang mem
ber's sister is "a classic, so it's versatile

to an extent," but the play must live up
to certain expected standards, said di
rector Ban Manning.
Already 55 people have trooped
through the first run-through for the
37 parts, according to Manning, and he
expects more tonight when auditions

conclude in Memorial Auditorium.
"Look at it as two hours to dance and
romp on a stage," said Manning to po
tential auditioners. "Just relax and have
A ooorl rime "

The show will be performed in
Memorial Auditorium April 16, 17 and
18, with final performances on April 24
and 25.
Why the seemingly sudden interest
in play production this winter?
"It allows students to see their op
tions beyond graduation. .said
McDonough. "In fact, it allows students
to see their options right now.
