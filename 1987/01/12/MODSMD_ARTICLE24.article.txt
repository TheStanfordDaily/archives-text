# Stanford sinks WSU with subs, 93-76
## Card, 4-2, moves into second place in Pac-10 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
After Saturday night's 93-76 win over Wash
ington State put Stanford into a second-place
tie with California and UCLA in the Pacific 10
Conference, Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery was asked whether he was
surprised by the Cardinal s 4-2 Pac-10 record,
which includes three straight wins.
"No, not really, Montgomery said. "We've
had four home games. I'm a believer in that
you build tradition at home, that you have
confidence at home, you win at home and
then scramble on the road.
The Cardinal will be doing a lot of scram
bling in the coming weeks, as its next five
games will be played away from the friendly
confines of Maples Pavilion. Still, in Saturday's
game and in last Thursday's 82-77 win over
Washington, Stanford showed signs that it
may be able to stay near the top of the league
standings.
Against Washington, the Cardinal showed it
could adjust defensively to a physically larger
opponent and that it has the poise and deter
mination to overcome adversity, rallying from
a 13-point first-half deficit.
And against Washington State, Stanford
showed that it could survive an off shooting
night from its top scorer, Todd Lichti, and that
it could withstand a hot night from an op
ponent, in this case Cougars' forward Joe
Wallace.
Finally, in both games the Cardinal got sig
nificant contributions from its bench. Sopho
more forward Bryan McSweenev scored 13
points against Washington, including six cru
cial ones down the stretch, and on Saturday
reserves Eric Reveno and Scott Meinert were
keys to the Stanford effort.
Reveno, a junior center, scored a career
high 19 points (including three three-point
plays) on seven-of-10 field goal shooting
while Meinert, a sophomore guard, tallied 14
while hitting six of seven from the floor.
Washington State Coach Len Stevens' main
concern coming into the game was stopping
Lichti, a 17.6 points-per-game scorer. The

Cougars managed to hold Lichti to 13,
primarily because the Cardinal sophomore
was busy trying to slow down the taller (6-
foot-7 to Lichti s 6-4), smooth-shooting
Wallace, who scored a game-high 24 points.
"He (Lichti) was the guy we knew we had to
control," Stevens said. "We didn't count on
Meinert and Reveno hurting us like that."
But Stanford's bench does count on hurting
the opposition. "We feel we have to contrib
ute," Reveno said. "We're not just in there to
give people rest; we're in there to get things
done."
"We feel we're really strong through eight,"
Montgomery said. "When I put Rev in, 1 ex
pect him to contribute."
The Cougars stormed to an early 15-7 lead,
but Stanford came back to take a 38-35 advan
tage at the half behind 10 points from Howard
Wright and nine from Reveno.
The Cardinal got a big break early in the
second half when Wallace picked up his
fourth foul on a highly dubious call with 18:50
to play and the score tied at 40. "When Joe
went out, we didn't have the offensive
firepower from the outside," Stevens said.
Washington State did, however, have the
inside firepower of center Dwayne Scholten,
whose eight baskets (in 10 shots) came from a
combined distance of about 12 feet.
Scholten and the defensive play of Brian
Wright on Lichti kept the Cougars in the game
until a Terry Taylor three-pointer touched off
a 15-4 run highlighted by eight Meinert points
that put Stanford up 71-58 with 8:29 left.
Washington State never got closer than nine
the rest of the way.
The Cardinal had its fast break and half
court offense running smoothly in the second
half, largely due to the efforts of Taylor, who
tied Keith Ramee's 1982-83 school record of
12 assists. Taylor would probably have broken
the record, but he was taken out with 6:29 to
go after picking up his fourth foul and did not
return.
"I think I'm getting more confident with
our offense," said Taylor, who has been both
ered by tight man-to-man pressure in previ
ous games. "I'm getting better at knowing

where our players want the ball and getting it
to them."
Taylor did a good job of getting the ball
inside not only to Reveno but also to Wright,
who scored a quiet 18 points and pulled
down a game-high 12 rebounds.
Wright has been troubled lately by a shoot
ing slump and foul trouble, but on Saturday
he hit six of 10 from the field and committed
only two fouls.
"I had a conversation with Kermit
(Washington) this week," Wright said. "1 was
confused why my statistics had been down,
and he told me just to worn 1 about playing
hard on defense and rebounding and that the
other things would take care of themselves."

Card notes
The Stanford Axe Committee went after
Wallace, distributing flyers before the game
calling on Stanford fans to boo the Cougar
forward every time he touched the ball.
The flyers called Wallace "inconsistent,"
accused him of sleeping with "Ripe Cantelope
(sic)" and said he belonged in the YWCA in
stead of the NBA. Wallace seemed unper
turbed by the attention, and if his nine-of-12
shooting and 24 points are any indication, it
would seem that the Axe Committee has a
long way to go if it ever hopes to match the
students at Duke University, the reigning
kings of college basketball abuse.

Todd Lichti powers past Washington State center Dwayne Scholten for a basket Saturday night
at Maples Pavilion. Lichti was held to 13 points, but his teammates picked up the slack in the
Cardinal's 93-76 victory.
