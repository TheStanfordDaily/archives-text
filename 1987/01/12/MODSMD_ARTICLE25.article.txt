## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
You knew something was different.
Stanford linebacker David Wyman
and IJSC guard Jeff Bregel were sit
ting in the same locker room of Stan
ford Stadium after a game munching
on sandwiches and talking football
"The funnest thing is meeting the
guys you've played against — like this
guy. I hated him all season, and we've
been hanging together all week,'
Wyman said.
The occasion was the annual East-
West Shrine Game, a post-season all
star game that's been held since 1925
to raise money for the Shriners'
hospitals for crippled and burned
children. This year, 74,000 people
enjoyed a perfect Saturday afternoon
in the sun and saw the West pull out a
24-21 victory.
For Wyman and Stanford wide
receiver Thomas Henley, it was the
perfect way to play a final game on
the home turf. They got a win, im
pressed the dozens of National Foot
ball League scouts in attendance,
gave the fans an exciting game and,
most important, helped (lie Shriners
give hope to hundreds of kids who
are unable to walk, much less catch a
perfect spiral in stride out of the clear
January sky.
Wyman finished the game with 12
tackles and two votes for Outstanding
Defensive Player. Menlev caught four
passes for 69 yards and a touchdown,
ran the ball once for five yards and
returned two kickoffs for 40 yards, re
ceiving one vote as Outstanding Of
fensive Player.
"I think it was a great game, said
Stanford Coach Jack Elway, an assis
tant to former IJSC Coach Ted 101 l
tier on the West side. I think Thomas
and Wyman played real well. This just
shows what Thomas can do. 1 le s got
all kinds of versatility — returns,
catching the ball, good speed. He had
a heck of a day.
Henley's touchdown came on a ,V<-
yard pass from Colorado State quar
terback Kellv Stouffer with 13 50 to

play in the first half and the West
holding a ~-0 lead thanks to ;i one
yard run b\ Oklahoma fullback Earl
Johnson.
"The other wide receiver and the
tight end ran in routes, Henley said

"Tlit' safet\ hit. and I got behind him.
It was just a simple post pattern. He
(Stouffer) put it in there so beauti
fully, he really has a nice touch All I
had to do was catch the ball.
Stouffer was voted the Outstanding

Offensive Player for his effort — 11-
of-r for 179 yards with two touch
downs and no interceptions. He was
a late addition to the West roster,
