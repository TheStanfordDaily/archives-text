### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
You knew something was different.
Stanford linebacker David Wyman
and IJSC guard Jeff Bregel were sit
ting in the same locker room of Stan
ford Stadium after a game munching
on sandwiches and talking football
"The funnest thing is meeting the
guys you've played against — like this
guy. I hated him all season, and we've
been hanging together all week,'
Wyman said.
The occasion was the annual East-
West Shrine Game, a post-season all
star game that's been held since 1925
to raise money for the Shriners'
hospitals for crippled and burned
children. This year, 74,000 people
enjoyed a perfect Saturday afternoon
in the sun and saw the West pull out a
24-21 victory.
For Wyman and Stanford wide
receiver Thomas Henley, it was the
perfect way to play a final game on
the home turf. They got a win, im
pressed the dozens of National Foot
ball League scouts in attendance,
gave the fans an exciting game and,
most important, helped (lie Shriners
give hope to hundreds of kids who
are unable to walk, much less catch a
perfect spiral in stride out of the clear
January sky.
Wyman finished the game with 12
tackles and two votes for Outstanding
Defensive Player. Menlev caught four
passes for 69 yards and a touchdown,
ran the ball once for five yards and
returned two kickoffs for 40 yards, re
ceiving one vote as Outstanding Of
fensive Player.
"I think it was a great game, said
Stanford Coach Jack Elway, an assis
tant to former IJSC Coach Ted 101 l
tier on the West side. I think Thomas
and Wyman played real well. This just
shows what Thomas can do. 1 le s got
all kinds of versatility — returns,
catching the ball, good speed. He had
a heck of a day.
Henley's touchdown came on a ,V<-
yard pass from Colorado State quar
terback Kellv Stouffer with 13 50 to

play in the first half and the West
holding a ~-0 lead thanks to ;i one
yard run b\ Oklahoma fullback Earl
Johnson.
"The other wide receiver and the
tight end ran in routes, Henley said

"Tlit' safet\ hit. and I got behind him.
It was just a simple post pattern. He
(Stouffer) put it in there so beauti
fully, he really has a nice touch All I
had to do was catch the ball.
Stouffer was voted the Outstanding

Offensive Player for his effort — 11-
of-r for 179 yards with two touch
downs and no interceptions. He was
a late addition to the West roster,

having been named only after Stanford
quarterback John Paye underwent
shoulder surgery three weeks ago, and
he and Henley roomed together
during the week at the Hyatt Palo Alto.
"I was very impressed with
Thomas," Stouffer said. "He's very
quick, runs very disciplined routes and
has good hands. What 1 saw of him all
week really impressed me."
USC defensive back Tim McDonald
was named the Outstanding Defensive
Player. McDonald intercepted a pass by
Michigan State quarterback Dave
Yarema in the end zone to end the first
East scoring threat and finished with
nine tackles.
The West went out to a 21-0 lead
with 8:01 left in the first half when
Stouffer found Long Beach State wide
receiver Charles Lockett streaking
down the right sideline. With 2:56 left
in the half, the East had driven to the
West 1-yard line, but on fourth down
Citadel kicker Greg Davis came on to
kick an 18-yard field goal to make the
halftime score 21-3.
The bizarre part of the game came as
the third quarter started. The East

received the kickoff and marched 60
yards in 15 plays and almost nine
minutes to set up a 24-yard field goal
by Davis to make it 24-6.
Then, a Shrine Game rule designed
to keep the game close allowed the
East, trailing by more than 10 points, to
receive the kickoff. Scott Schwedes of
Syracuse took the kick and returned it
90 yards for a touchdown. Yarema
found Clemson tailback Terrence
Flagler on the two-point conversion to
close to 21-14. The East had scored 11
points in 14 seconds.
"That's tough on a defense," Wyman
said, "especially after a long drive. All
of us were trying to win, and that was
making us mad. It wouldn't have been
so close without that rule."
The turning point nearly came early
in the fourth quarter. McDonald had
apparently intercepted Yarema for the
second time at the goal line and
returned it to midfield, but teammate
Ron Francis of Baylor was called for in
terference on Michigan State wide
receiver Mark Ingram. The East got the
ball on the West 3, setting up a one
yard sneak by Yarema to tie the game
at 21-21.
The West came back on the next
drive, though, as Stouffer drove the

West to the East 2, the key play being a
30-yard pass on third-and-12 to Lockett
to the East 22. Nebraska kicker Dale
Klein came on and hit the 19-yard field
goal to give the West its margin of vic
tory with 6:53 to play.
The East had one final chance to tie,
as Georgia Southern quarterback Tracy
Ham drove the team to the West 35,
but Davis missed a 52-yard field goal
with 32 seconds to play.
Though the result didn't matter in
any standings, the players knew the
NFL was looking on, and the intensity
and will to win was high throughout.
"When you get a bunch of athletes like
this together, as competitive as they
are, there's no way they're going to go
out and not care about winning,"
Wyman said.
