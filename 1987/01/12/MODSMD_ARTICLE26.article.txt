# Stanford women rebound at WSU
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
During the opening stanza of Satur
day night's game against Washington
State, the Stanford women's basketball
team finally erupted from its two-game
dormancy.
Some may conclude that the 42-23
first-half barrage was merely a release
of a vast amount of stored energy that
went unused against Washington two
nights before.
More than likely, though, this sud
den explosion was triggered by a more
ominous source.
The post-game talk given by Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer following
the lackluster 27-point loss to the
Huskies may have had more to do with
the 71-67 win over the Cougars than
any other individual performance.
"I think she had a lot to do with it,"
forward Katy Steding said. "She said
that she would not stand for that kind
of play ever again "
The unwary Washington State
defense, well scouted by VanDerveer
and her coaching staff, stumbled in the
face of the motivated Cardinal offense.
"We knew that they would run a
variation of the 2-3 zone (defense),"

Steding, the freshman phenom, said.
"We knew what sort of offense to run
on them."
The Cardinal exploited the Cougar
defense by feeding the ball to the hot
hands of Steding, Jill Yanke and Charli
Turner, who punished the nets from
the various gaps in the Cougar zone.
Foul trouble in the second half
forced the Cardinal into its version of
the zone defense, one that the Cougar
offense shredded with equal effective
ness.
"In the first half, they couldn't hit
anything," Steding said. "But in the
second half, they were hitting from
everywhere, especially the outside.
And I mean way outside."
Despite guard Penny Bowden's
game-high 21 points, however, the
Cougars just could not overcome Stan
ford's dominant first half.
Steding led a balanced Stanford of
fense with 12 points, followed by
Yanke, Turner and Kami Anderson,
who each added 11 points.
The Cardinal now owns a 2-2 record
in the Pacific 10 Conference and an 8-5
mark for the season. The Cougars fell
to 0-3 in the conference and 7-5 over
all.
