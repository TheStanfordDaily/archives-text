# All-around superior showing by Gerardo

### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Everything taken into consideration,
it was a great way to start off the
season.
That was the general opinion of the
Stanford men's gymnastics team after
its first important competition Saturday
at UC-Davis. The injury-riddled Card
inal entered only five gymnasts into the
six-team contest and still managed a re
spectable showing and provided a
good deal of hope for the future.

"I was very pleased," Stanford Coach
Sadao Hamada said. "I was expecting
an average score of 8.5, but our score
of 261 means an average of about 8.7,
which is excellent for this time of year
with only five gymnasts and the injur
ies."
Stanford's 261.4 placed it in fourth
for the meet, well ahead of San Jose
State and Davis. Three points ahead in
third was California. Cal State-Fullerton
won the meet with a score of 269.05,
Junior Chuck Gerardo was the indi
vidual standout not only for Stanford
but for the entire meet. His 54.9 six
event total gave him the all-around
championship over some fairly im
pressive competition, indicating that
he will be among the NCAA's elite this
season.
Finishing second in the individual
race was Bob Sundstrom of California,
who came in at 54.6.
Placing among the top five in the
single-event finals were Gerardo and
sophomores Andy Ropp and Scott
Schaffer. Gerardo placed in three
events, Ropp in two and Schaffer in
one. Also competing were freshman
Conrad Voorsinger and Charles Loop,
who, according to both Schaffer and
Hamada, proved they could handle
college-level competition very well.
