Although no official team scores were kept, the Stanford
men's and women's swimming teams performed im
pressively, posting strong performances in the Cal Invita
tional at Berkeley this weekend.
In a meet where race experience was the predominant
theme, both teams had several swimmers hovering around
NCAA qualifying times, a particularly strong showing this
early in the season.
Freshman John W itchell and senior tri-captain Jeff Kostoff
of the men s team went one stroke farther as each recorded
NCAA-qualifying times in the 1,650-yard freestyle.
Kostoff, a 19H4 Olympian, qualified in comfortable fash
ion, touching home 1H seconds under the qualifying time.
Witchell, who entered the meet quite fatigued according to
Kostoff, finished five seconds under the NCAA mark.
In the women's team, "everyone was really close, said
sophomore Michelle Donahue, who was "tenths off in both
the 100 and 200-yard backstroke. 19H4 Olympian Susan

Rapp also just missed qualifying in the 100-vard
breaststroke, but she won the 100-yard butterfly.
Most of the swimmers had little time for disappointment
since both teams entered individuals in not only their main
events, but also their "off-events, a practice that helps
develope all the strokes, Donahue said.
One such swimmer in the groove was senior Dave
Louden. Swimming against Cal's Olympic performer Matt
Biondi, Louden nudged out Biondi and others, finishing
first in the 200-yard freestyle.
Olympians Pablo Morales and Anthony Mosse also turned
in strong swims, placing first and second, respectively, in
the 100-yard butterfly. "It was kind of a busy weekend,"
reflected a tired Morales afterwards.
Indeed, the Invitational had the NCAA format of both
preliminaries and finals and, according to senior Sam
McAdam, most swimmers entered five or six events.
The two teams will begin to gear up for the season's dual
meet competition. The Stanford women will face San Jose
State next weekend while the Cardinal men will confront
both Arizona schools in two weeks.
