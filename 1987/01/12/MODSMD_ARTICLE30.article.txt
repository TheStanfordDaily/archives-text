### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Stanford women's golf coach Tim
Baldwin couldn't have asked tor a bet
ter conclusion. Alter two less-than
spectacular rounds on Wednesday and
Thursday, the Cardinal fired a 300
Friday, the third-best round of the
tournament, to finish fifth at the Lady
Aztec Invitational in San Diego.
More important, the round was the
team's third-best of the year and is an
excellent start to the Cardinal's drive
for a berth in the NCAA tournament.
San Jose State continued to eat up
the 5,900-yard, par-72 Singing Hills
Country Club. In completing a sweep
of the three-day tournament, SJSU shot
a final-round 312 to top USC by six
strokes, with Dana Lofland and Anne
Jones sharing the individual title at 222.
Helen Alfredsson of U.S. International
University placed third.
Stanford senior Kathleen McCarthy
posted a final-round 72 — the tourna
ment's best score that was equaled
only once — to capture eigth. Cardinal
junior Kay Cornelius wound up the
tournament with a 74 to land 10th indi
vidually.
"We've played 15 competitive

rounds this year," Baldwin said. "The
final round helped our cause a great
deal and gave us a lot of confidence
that we can play with and beat USC,
ASU, UCLA and SJSU.
"It was a good tournament for Kathy
(McCarthy) with improvement every
round. She's just a great player. She
made about a half-dozen birdies in the
final round. Kay shot a steady final
round and played a typically solid, Kay
Cornelius tournament," he added.
A gutsv performance was turned in
by senior Adrienne Gilmartin, who
shot a closing 76 to come in at 238.
"Adrienne played on a really
severely sprained ankle and did a great
job. Considering her limping around
the golf course, she struck the ball very
well and I'm proud as hell of her,
Baldwin said.
McCarthy, like Baldwin, is excited
about the challenge facing the team in
its attempt to qualify for the NCAA
tournament.
"It's been quite a struggle this year,"
McCarthy said. "The team that we have
is one of the closest knit groups I've
been with. We've got so much spirit on
this team, and I feel closer to these
girls than any other (team) I've been
on."
