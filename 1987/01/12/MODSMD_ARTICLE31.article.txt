# Kassulke third at tourney
## 
### 
Stanford's Kurt Kassulke defeated
Humboldt State's Don Wolf 9-3 in the
consolation finals to take third place in
the heavyweight division of the "Doc
Petersen" Open wrestling tournament.
Due to a demanding recent
schedule, the Cardinal only fielded a
partial squad as Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel gave his wrestlers the option of
taking the weekend off. The Cardinal
finished 14th out of 36 teams.
Former Stanford Ail-American Doug
Perkins — now an assistant with the
Cardinal — finished second at 190
pounds. He lost 9-3 in the finals to Jim
Baumgardner.
Tihamer Toth-fejel, a former All-
America from Lehigh and currently a
Stanford assistant, was third in the 142-
pound division.
