## 
### INGRID WICKELGREN 
If members of the Russian Club and
students returning from the Overseas
Studies Program in Poland get their
way, a Row house without a theme
could become the new Russian-East
European theme house next fall.
According to Jamie Driscoll, presi
dent of the Russian Club, the proposal
has already received support from fac
ulty members in many related aca
demic disciplines.
A letter sent from Alice Supton, assis
tant dean of Residential Education, to
residents of co-ed, upper-class houses
states that "the approval of proposals
for new theme houses may result in a
house which is now an upper class, co
ed, non-theme house being designated
an academic theme house for 1987-
88."
Supton said Res Ed is committed to
finding places for all approved
proposals.
"We think that by being in a residen
tial setting, students can capitalize on
the many different Stanford resources
for studying Russia and Eastern
Europe," Driscoll said.
Driscoll and Hilary La Monte, a

senior majoring in Russian literature,
want the house to include computers
with Russian word processing, Soviet
television programs, Russian Films and
a library.
Topics for the proposed five- to six
unit required house seminar will
range from folk dancing to arms con
trol to Russian intellectual history, La
Monte said.
If approved, the focus of the house
will he on the Russian and Polish lan
guages, hut there will be no language
requirement for house residents, said
Driscoll.
To gain priority points for the house,
students can do Russian courscwork,
attend an overseas program in a Slavic
country, make a proposal for a house
program, help in a community activity
sponsored by the Russian Club or sign
up early, said Driscoll.
"Russian is the only unhoused major
United Nations language on campys,"
Driscoll said. He is requesting that the
new theme house be on the Row and
be a self-op, a student-run house that
hires a cook and does its own cleaning.
Three other student groups are also
developing proposals for new aca

demic theme houses, according to
Supton.
The proposed theme houses are an
arts theme house, a public service
theme house and an international rela
tions theme house, said Supton.
The arts house will encorporate
studio an, art history, music, drama,
dance, creative writing and film into its
theme, said sophomore Susan Jansco.
The proposed house has received a
positive faculty response from these
arts-related departments, she said.
"We want to have space to teach art
classes and put on shows," Jansco said.
The establishment of a theme house
requires a proposal to the associate
dean of Student Affairs. The associate
dean then makes a recommendation
