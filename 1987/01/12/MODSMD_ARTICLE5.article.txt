# Divers disagree on suit
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
A lawsuit recently filed by a Stanford
diver against the NCAA in response to
its new drug-testing rule has met with
reservations from some of her
teammates.
"I'm definitely for overall drug test
ing, so I'm kind of against the suit,"
said Michelle Leighton, a member of
the Stanford women's diving team.
Leslie Kleinheskel, another member
of the team, declined to comment on
the suit specifically but did acknowl
edge that she thought drug tests for
athletes are "a good idea."
Kleinheskel added that the issue of
drug testing "is difficult because I don't
think that people really understand
what is being tested (for)."
Simone LeVant, captain of the Stan
ford women's diving team, filed suit
against the NCAA last Tuesday in an at
tempt to challenge the constitutionality
of the NCAA's new drug-testing rule,
which requires that all teams and ath
letes participating in post-season com
petition submit to drug tests.
LeVant is seeking both to stop en
forcement of the drug tests and to ob
tain a temporary restraining order that
would permit her to compete in diving
meets while the case is under litiga
tion.
Leighton, while acknowledging that
"some of the things they (the NCAA)
test for are really unfair," such as caf
feine or aspirin, said that the tests are
good because they prevent athletes
who take performance-enhancing
drugs from gaining an unfair advantage
in competition.

Despite her disagreement wMh the
suit, however, Leighton said she was
pleased to have LeVant competing
again.
"It's great to have her back, we need
all the bodies we can get,' she said.
The women's diving team has only five
members, including LeVant.
Diving coach Rick Schavone and
other team members were in Texas for
a diving meet and were unavailable for
comment.
