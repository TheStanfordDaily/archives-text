# Unlisted get listed

Approximately 300 students' phone
numbers were inadvertantly listed in
the 1986-87 Stanford Student Directory
despite the students' requests for
privacy, according to University offi
cials.
Although the University made a
mistake in printing these phone num
bers, the resulting harm is probably
not enough to constitute a legal inva
sion of privacy, as the error is not "a
revelation of some aspect of the per
son's inner being," according to Law
Prof. Marc Franklin.
A combination of human negligence
and computer error caused the leak,
said Jack Farrell, assistant registrar.
The directory was proofread once
by workers in the Registrar's Office,
and all information on students re
questing privacy was correctly
suppressed from the computer draft
printout, Farrell said.
After this initial proofreading,
however, the directory's format was
changed to accomodate the new nine
digit ZIP code system, known as "ZIP
+4."
Since the changes made to the direc
tory were aimed at the ZIP code of
each entry, only these changes were
proofread before printing.
All previously entered and formatted

information should have remained
constant despite the revision of the ZIP
code format, Farrell said. Conse
quently, registrar workers neglected to
thoroughly proofread the directory
before it was printed, he said.
"The assumption was made that
privacy would continue to be
protected," Farrell said.
"Unfortunately, something happened
where the information was not
suppressed."
A total of 18,800 directories were
printed before the error was noted,
said senior John Fernandes, who
mananaged the publishing of the
directory. About 17,000 directories
were distributed to students, faculty
and department offices.
An additional 400 directories were
to go on sale at the Stanford Bookstore,
but instead were bought back by the
Registrar's Office in an attempt to
prevent any further spread of the mis
takenly published information, Farrell
said.
Although a handful of students, un
der the management of Fernandes, was
in charge of compiling the directory,
all student names and information
were gathered by the Registar's Office.
At the start of fall quarter, the
Registrar's Office had phone and ad
dress information forms for students to
