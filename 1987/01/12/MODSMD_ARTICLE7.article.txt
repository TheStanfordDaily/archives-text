# Animal rights activists begin protesting at WSU

PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) — A small but vocal
group of animal-rights activists is protesting
against the use of dogs and cats from Spokane
County Animal Shelter for studies at Washing
ton State University's School of Veterinary
Medicine.
"There's a lot of emotion here," said Dr.
Robert Wilson, dean of the Washington State's
vet school.
Some administrators at the vet school feel
that the protesters have gone beyond emotion
and are not fighting a fair fight.
Dr. Gherry Pettit, head of small-animal sur
gery at the vet school, said that the animal
rights activists have cast him in the role of a
"villain" and that he is "uncomfortable" be
cause of it.
But the issues at stake are simple, according
iu lammy Burrell, chairman of the Committee
To End Pound Seizure. "We are not talking
about halting human progress in any way," she
said. "What we are saying is that our former
pets deserve better than this."

Last year the county shelter sold the univer
sity $8,915 worth of animals; 573 dogs at $15
each and 64 cats at $5 each.
All told, the shelter took in 3,176 dogs and
1,106 cats, had 7 85 dogs "redeemed" by
owners and found someone else to adopt 316
of the dogs and 110 of the cats.
The rest were kept for five days and then
either went to the university or were killed with
an injection of sodium pentobarbital.
Without the university contract, the 85 dog
pens and 25 cat cages would be full more often,
according to Marianne Niemczyk, director of
the Spokane County Animal Shelter. The county
would then have to come up with more money
for the drugs used to kill those not claimed in
five days.
A vegetarian herself, Niemczyk finds some
objectors hypocritical. What do they eat for
dinner?" she asked.
Such contracts aren't new, said Pettit, who
graduated from the University of California-
Davis in 1953.

"Historically, what has happened for the last
30 years or more is that schools would go out
to the pounds and contract quietly," Pettit ex
plains.
In the 19705, the vet school asked for a con
tract with Spokane's animal shelter. The issue
was put to the voters in a referendum and was
approved by a four-to-one margin.
In 1978, the city bowed to pressure from its
humane society and the contract moved to the
county.
This year, the county commission listened to
the newly formed committee, then voted two
to-one to continue the contract for another
year.
Commissioner-elect Pat Mummey will take
the place of one of those who voted for it
A terse phone call a week before the Novem
ber election offered her 2,800 votes if she
would agree to vote against the university con
tract, but she refused, she said.
Third-year vet students have a surgical lab
Class that uses seven dogs a semester for each

group of three to four students. Senior vet stu
dents study cats.
Each animal undergoes two surgical proce
dures. In the first, a minor incision is made. The
second is a more serious procedure, after
which the dog is put to death with anesthesia.
Surgery students are entirely responsible for
their lab animals throughout the two weeks
each is at the vet school kennel.
A typical assignment is the shoulder joint; the
goal, to understand the muscles and bones
within, how they work together, how to fix
them when something goes wrong.
"The hardest thing for these students is put
ting these dogs to sleep, Pettit said.
Wilson said many things have changed since
he graduated from the vet school in 1961. In
those days, the operating room was in an
abandoned chicken coop
The noticeable thing is that we are all more
sensitive to recognizing pain in our patients,
says Pettit "When I was in school — one. I
don't think we were as apt to look for it. Two, 1

think we were convinced it was a normal part
of things."
As at many schools, a campus committee with
representatives from many departments must
approve all research that involves animals. The
point is to avoid unnecessary pain and suffer
ing. Agencies that offer grants and journals that
publish research results also check that area,
Pettit said.
All first-year vet students now get a course in
ethics and values. Wilson said. Among the
major lessons, he said, is the message that
"there are a lot of things that are gray."
A few of the animals are used in research and
teaching in radiology and pharmacology.
Videotapes have been a godsend in helping stu
dents learn about drugs and their effects, Pettit
said.
Training vet students in surgical procedures
is crucial, Pettit said. "To study veterinary
medicine without dogs would be like studying
piano for four years without a piano until the
night of your concert."
