Alleged nuclear transport skids
SALISBURY, England — A 20-ton truck, pan of a top-secret military con
voy and thought by anti-nuclear activists to be carrying atomic weapons,
was hauled upright by a crane yesterday after skidding off an icy country
road.
The Ministry of Defense refused to comment on speculation that the
truck's cargo was nuclear weapons.
Soldiers, police and marines launched a big security operation to
recover the truck, which fell on its side Saturday in a field near a Royal Navy
armament depot at West Dean, 12 miles east of Salisbury in western Eng
land.
The area was sealed off and roadblocks were set up.
Eighteen hours after the accident, the ministry said the truck had been
lifted upright. It was towed-away in a 20-vehicle convoy past a small crowd
at a roadblock, which included about 25 protesters shouting, "Nuclear ter
rorist!"
The ministry refused to give any information about the truck, citing se
curity. It said no one was hurt and no danger ever existed for the public.
Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, quoted an uniden
tified expert on nuclear weapons as saying Dean Hill was used for storing
nuclear depth charges to be used against submarines.
The agency quoted the expert as saying the convoy was probably
transporting either nuclear depth bombs used by anti-submarine helicop
ters or nuclear bombs fitted to Sea Harrier jets.
High tech controls ineffective
WASHINGTON — A National Academy of Sciences study has found that
attempts to keep high technology from Soviet bloc nations have not signifi
cantly improved America s national security, but have cost the country
188,000 jobs and $9 billion a year and "are having an increasingly corrosive
effect" on U.S. relations with its allies.
The academy panel recommended ending the Defense Department's
"de facto veto" over technology sales and easing U.S. controls on strategic
exports to match those of the NATO allies.
The committee, headed by former Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Lew Al
len, includes former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird and Bobby Ray Inman,
former director of the National Security Agency and deputy director of the
Central Intelligence Agency. It also includes a number of business execu
tives and academics.
Veteran defense officials and others on the panel questioned Pentagon
estimates that export controls saved the United States billions of dollars in
defense costs.
The benefit to U.S. national security from stringent export controls "is
feasible only in the shrinking number of cases in which the United States is
the only country possessing the technology," according to the study, which
was made available to The Washington Post in the form of a preliminary
draft report.
Export restrictions "have greater potential to damage the U.S. economy
than ... reduce exports to the East Bloc," the draft report said.
"Executive-branch decisions concerning national security export con
trols (should) accord greater importance than they currently do to main
taining U.S. technical strength, economic vigor and allied unity," the study
concluded.
The study sides with American business in a dispute that has split the
Reagan administration, with the Commerce Department and high
technology companies pressing for export controls to be relaxed andahe
Pentagon insisting they be strengthened
Iran's missiles strike Iraq
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Iran launched missile attacks yesterday against
Iraq's capital of Baghdad and the southern port city of Basra. Iraq said it hit
back with a "devastating" air raid on Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's holy
city of Qom.
Fierce ground fighting was reported for a third straight day. Com
muniques from both sides indicated Iran's forces were still on the offen
sive near Basra.
Tehran radio claimed Iranian troops killed or wounded 1,4,000 Iraqi sol
diers and captured 1,000 since the offensive, called Karbala-5, began early
Friday.
An unidentified Iraqi field commander quoted by Iraq's official news
agency said Iran lost 250 tanks in heavy overnight fighting, with Iranian
casualties including at least 5,000 dead.
The claims, monitored in Nicosia, could not be substantiated because
both sides severely restrict foreign correspondents' access to the battle
zones.
Iran had threatened to launch a decisive "final offensive" in the 6-year
old Persian Gulf war before the Iranian new year, or Noruz, on March 21.
The objective appeared to be the capture or encirclement of Basra, Iraq's
second largest city with a population of about 1 million.
Afghan: USSR wants to withdraw
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — A top Afghan guerrilla leader said yesterday he
believes the Soviet Union wants to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan
and may be ready to sacrifice the Afghan Communist government if neces
sary.
Gulbaddin Hekmatyrar, head of the Hezbi-i-Islami guerrilla group and
one of the most hard-line of the insurgent leaders, told The Associated
Press in an interview that Moscow's recent statements about wanting to pull
out of Afghanistan appear genuine.
He also outlined a series of demands for a settlement, including direct
talks with Moscow.
The Soviet-backed Afghan government has called for a six-month cease
fire with the guerrillas beginning next Thursday and proposed forming a
government of national reconciliation to end the eight-year war in Afghani
stan. The Soviet Union has strongly backed the call and said it wants to
remove its forces from its Central Asian neighbor.
Leaders of the seven-party guerilla alliance individually have rejected the
government s proposal and said they will go on fighting until Afghanistan is
free of Soviet control. The leaders, all based in Pakistan, were to meet in
Peshawar today to enable the alliance to present a united response.
Hekmatyrar, in the most optimistic reaction yet by a top guerrilla leader,
said strong signs have emerged that the Soviets want a political settlement.
USSR may eye real elections
MOSCOW — A leading Communist Party theoretician suggested yester
day that elections with two or more candidates would help the Soviet
people learn how to exercise their rights.
Georgi Shakhnazarov, an official in the International Department of the
party's Central Committee who is considered close to the thinking of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, expressed the view in an interview with the
weekly Moscow News.
In remarkably candid language. Shakhnazarov implied that single
candidate elections and the practice of administrative rule from the top
down have eroded public interest in selecting leaders.
"If violations of the democratic order take place for 10 to 15 years and
the democratic system is not applied in full, then it gradually begins to
rust," he said without explaining what 10- or 15-year period he meant.
His interview — in a publication that is printed in French. Spanish.
Arabic and English as well as Russian — seemed designed to stimulate dis
cussion of Gorbachev's frequent calls for greater democratization
Workers in the Soviet Union, he said, have been timid and reluctant
about using rights granted to them by newly passed legislation.
"Administrative methods of government have seemingly alleviated life
not only for those who govern but also for those who are governed," he
said.

remove its forces from its Central Asian neighbor.
Leaders of the seven-party guerilla alliance individually have rejected the
government s proposal and said they will go on fighting until Afghanistan is

Peshawar today to enable the alliance to present a united response.
Hekmatyrar, in the most optimistic reaction yet by a top guerrilla leader,
said strong signs have emerged that the Soviets want a political settlement.
USSR may eye real elections
MOSCOW — A leading Communist Party theoretician suggested yester
day that elections with two or more candidates would help the Soviet
people learn how to exercise their rights.
Georgi Shakhnazarov, an official in the International Department of the
party's Central Committee who is considered close to the thinking of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, expressed the view in an interview with the
weekly Moscow News.
In remarkably candid language. Shakhnazarov implied that single
candidate elections and the practice of administrative rule from the top
down have eroded public interest in selecting leaders.
"If violations of the democratic order take place for 10 to 15 years and
the democratic system is not applied in full, then it gradually begins to
rust," he said without explaining what 10- or 15-year period he meant.
His interview — in a publication that is printed in French. Spanish.
Arabic and English as well as Russian — seemed designed to stimulate dis
cussion of Gorbachev's frequent calls for greater democratization
Workers in the Soviet Union, he said, have been timid and reluctant
about using rights granted to them by newly passed legislation.
"Administrative methods of government have seemingly alleviated life
not only for those who govern but also for those who are governed," he
said.

Alleged nuclear transport skids
SALISBURY, England — A 20-ton truck, pan of a top-secret military con
voy and thought by anti-nuclear activists to be carrying atomic weapons,
was hauled upright by a crane yesterday after skidding off an icy country
road.
The Ministry of Defense refused to comment on speculation that the
truck's cargo was nuclear weapons.
Soldiers, police and marines launched a big security operation to
recover the truck, which fell on its side Saturday in a field near a Royal Navy
armament depot at West Dean, 12 miles east of Salisbury in western Eng
land.
The area was sealed off and roadblocks were set up.
Eighteen hours after the accident, the ministry said the truck had been
lifted upright. It was towed-away in a 20-vehicle convoy past a small crowd
at a roadblock, which included about 25 protesters shouting, "Nuclear ter
rorist!"
The ministry refused to give any information about the truck, citing se
curity. It said no one was hurt and no danger ever existed for the public.
Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, quoted an uniden
tified expert on nuclear weapons as saying Dean Hill was used for storing
nuclear depth charges to be used against submarines.
The agency quoted the expert as saying the convoy was probably
transporting either nuclear depth bombs used by anti-submarine helicop
ters or nuclear bombs fitted to Sea Harrier jets.
High tech controls ineffective
WASHINGTON — A National Academy of Sciences study has found that
attempts to keep high technology from Soviet bloc nations have not signifi
cantly improved America s national security, but have cost the country
188,000 jobs and $9 billion a year and "are having an increasingly corrosive
effect" on U.S. relations with its allies.
The academy panel recommended ending the Defense Department's
"de facto veto" over technology sales and easing U.S. controls on strategic
exports to match those of the NATO allies.
The committee, headed by former Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Lew Al
len, includes former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird and Bobby Ray Inman,
former director of the National Security Agency and deputy director of the
Central Intelligence Agency. It also includes a number of business execu
tives and academics.
Veteran defense officials and others on the panel questioned Pentagon
estimates that export controls saved the United States billions of dollars in
defense costs.
The benefit to U.S. national security from stringent export controls "is
feasible only in the shrinking number of cases in which the United States is
the only country possessing the technology," according to the study, which
was made available to The Washington Post in the form of a preliminary
draft report.
Export restrictions "have greater potential to damage the U.S. economy
than ... reduce exports to the East Bloc," the draft report said.
"Executive-branch decisions concerning national security export con
trols (should) accord greater importance than they currently do to main
taining U.S. technical strength, economic vigor and allied unity," the study
concluded.
The study sides with American business in a dispute that has split the
Reagan administration, with the Commerce Department and high
technology companies pressing for export controls to be relaxed andahe
Pentagon insisting they be strengthened
Iran's missiles strike Iraq
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Iran launched missile attacks yesterday against
Iraq's capital of Baghdad and the southern port city of Basra. Iraq said it hit
back with a "devastating" air raid on Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's holy
city of Qom.
Fierce ground fighting was reported for a third straight day. Com
muniques from both sides indicated Iran's forces were still on the offen
sive near Basra.
Tehran radio claimed Iranian troops killed or wounded 1,4,000 Iraqi sol
diers and captured 1,000 since the offensive, called Karbala-5, began early
Friday.
An unidentified Iraqi field commander quoted by Iraq's official news
agency said Iran lost 250 tanks in heavy overnight fighting, with Iranian
casualties including at least 5,000 dead.
The claims, monitored in Nicosia, could not be substantiated because
both sides severely restrict foreign correspondents' access to the battle
zones.
Iran had threatened to launch a decisive "final offensive" in the 6-year
old Persian Gulf war before the Iranian new year, or Noruz, on March 21.
The objective appeared to be the capture or encirclement of Basra, Iraq's
second largest city with a population of about 1 million.
Afghan: USSR wants to withdraw
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — A top Afghan guerrilla leader said yesterday he
believes the Soviet Union wants to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan
and may be ready to sacrifice the Afghan Communist government if neces
sary.
Gulbaddin Hekmatyrar, head of the Hezbi-i-Islami guerrilla group and
one of the most hard-line of the insurgent leaders, told The Associated
Press in an interview that Moscow's recent statements about wanting to pull
out of Afghanistan appear genuine.
He also outlined a series of demands for a settlement, including direct
talks with Moscow.
The Soviet-backed Afghan government has called for a six-month cease
fire with the guerrillas beginning next Thursday and proposed forming a
government of national reconciliation to end the eight-year war in Afghani
stan. The Soviet Union has strongly backed the call and said it wants to
remove its forces from its Central Asian neighbor.
Leaders of the seven-party guerilla alliance individually have rejected the
government s proposal and said they will go on fighting until Afghanistan is
