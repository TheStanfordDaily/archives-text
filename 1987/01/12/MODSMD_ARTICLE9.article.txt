# Report: Government broke laws

WASHINGTON — In the course of the secret arms
selling operation with Iran, the White House and
Central Intelligence Agency violated several key
statutes and regulations and consistently failed to
monitor the program adequately, according to a set
of conclusions drafted by the staff of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence but later deleted
by the full committee.
The findings, which were dropped last Monday
when the committee voted 7-to-6 not to release its
report, declared that:
• The executive branch did not comply with the In
telligence Oversight Act of 1980, which requires the
president to "fully inform the (House and Senate)
Select Committees in a timely fashion" of foreign in
telligence operations.
• The president did not comply with Executive Or
der 12333 of Dec. 4,1981, the main executive branch
document establishing operating rules for the intelli

gence community. The order designates the CIA as
the agency in charge of covert operations unless the
president orders otherwise. But the Senate inves
tigators concluded that the president failed to for
mally assign responsibility for the covert Iranian
arms shipment to the National Security Council
which played the lead role in the operation.
• The Iran arms program was not based on adequate
prior intelligence assessments. The CIA did not suffi
ciently analyze Israeli motivations in pressing for
American support for the early arms-for-hostages ex
changes with Iran. And the ClA's deep concerns
about the reliability of Iranian arms dealer Manucher
Ghorbanifar, the key middleman in the deals, were
overlooked.
• The program was not adequately monitored. In
September 1985, Charles Allen, a national intelli
gence officer, was given the task of acquiring more
data on the shipment of U.S. arms to Iran, just begun

by Israel. Through various means, Allen soon began
to get "glimpses" of money moving into non-
American accounts in Switzerland from various mid
dlemen.
Allen subsequently became worried about the se
curity of the program and the widespread potential
for embarrassment to the United States from
premature disclosure. But it was only after he ex
pressed these concerns early last October to CIA
Deputy' Director Robert Gates that the top echelons
of the agency began a serious review.
The committee report was also critical of the
prepared statement to the committee of CIA Director
William Casey.
Summing up the Senate committee's conclusions,
a congressional source said: "In this (Iran) case, they
threw all their standard operating procedures and
regulations out the window."
