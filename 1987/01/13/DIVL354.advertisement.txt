Sorry for the
boring ad.
It seems our top
designers were too
busy to come up with
an inspiring graphic.
And maybe that's
our fault.
We've built a
reputation for doing
award-winning ads,
flyer, posters, and
promotions for our
clients. A reputation
so good that we've
simply got too much
work and too few
talented designers to
do it.
So, we're hiring.
If you're dedicated
and talented and want
to get paid good money
for doing great
graphics, pick up an
application from Portia
; Holmes in the
Business Office at
Tresidder Union.
Second floor.
But hurry. The
application deadline is
Monday, January 19.
