# Rationale for arms sale damaged

WASHINGTON — CIA Director
William Casey concluded in a revised
intelligence assessment last spring that
the Soviets were less likely to attack
Iran or have influence in a post-
Khomeini regime than the CIA
believed in 1985, according to in
formed sources.
Casey's amended analysis appears to
have called into question a primary
White House rationale for the secret
sale of U.S. arms to Iran, which Presi
dent Reagan ordered in January 1986
partly to assist Iran against
"intervention by the Soviet Union."
The 1986 CIA assessment, called a
Special National Intelligence Estimate

(SNIE), was issued under Casey's name
and endorsed by the heads of the U.S.
intelligence agencies. As such, it was
intended to represent the best col
lective intelligence judgment of these
agencies.
Casey has taken great pride in the
formal intelligence estimates, having
claimed repeatedly that they help
guide administration policy, according
to informed sources.
The 25-page highly classified docu
ment substantially altered conclusions
reached a year earlier by one of
Casey's national intelligence officers,
Graham Fuller, that there was a great
threat to Iran from its Soviet neighbor.

According to sources, Fuller's paper
also stated that the Iranian government
was weakening; the analysis empha
sized efforts being made by the Soviet
Union to gain influence in Iran.
This revised assessment was issued
to the White House before perhaps the
most dramatic of the arms shipments
to Iran in May 1986, when former na
tional security adviser Robert
McFarlane flew to Tehran with weap
ons in hopes of freeing U.S. hostages
held by Iran-backed Lebanese ex
tremists in Beirut.
One senior administration official
who read the revised estimate said yes
terday,"It essentially said that the Rus

sians are not coming to Iran."
Another source who recently
reviewed the SNIE added, "It said the
Russian threat was not that great, that
the Soviets were not about to jump
into Iran.... The urgency of the Fuller
study had abated."
The Tudeh communist parry, which
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeni had
outlawed in 1983, was inactive in Iran
and seemed to have little influence, the
SNIE concluded.
Some of this assessment was based
on intelligence provided by the Iranian
contacts being used by the NSC in the
arms deal.
