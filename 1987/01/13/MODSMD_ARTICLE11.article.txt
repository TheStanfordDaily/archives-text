# Scholar: Europe must act independently
## East-West division 'unnatural,' speaker says 
### JAY TURO 
Europe must pursue an independent foreign
policy, separate from that of the United States, a
British scholar said in a speech at Galvez House yes
terday.
William Wallace, a visitor from the Royal Institute
of International Affairs in London, said the division of
Europe into East and West factions is "both unnatural
and temporary."
Wallace said the presence of U.S. troops in West
Germany is anachronistic and contrary to the wishes
of most Germans. Increasingly determined German
attempts to reunify their now-divided land will be the
central problem facing Europe as it moves into the
next century, he said.
Wallace said he disagreed with the notion that

Europe could not handle a reunified Germany with
out outside intervention. But, Wallace said, that issue
is "a European one, and as such, to be settled
primarily by Europeans."
The movement within diplomatic circles in both
Eastern and Western Europe is toward conciliation,
and neither Soviet nor American propaganda can
change its course, according to Wallace.
"It is inevitable that Europe will someday pursue
an independent and integrated foreign policy," he
said. "The sooner American policy-makers realize
this, the less destabilizing the situation will be."
Most Western European leaders, including British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, have come to
realize there are significant gains to be made through
closer ties with East European nations, Wallace said.
"English, French and West German diplomats con

sider more and more Hungary and Poland in their
foreign policy deliberations," he said. This approach
to East-West relations puts Europe in a less con
frontational position toward the Soviet Union, ac
cording to Wallace.
America's over-estimation of the Soviet military
threat stems from an outdated foreign policy, Wallace
said. In contrast, the European public views the So
viet Union to be inherently weak politically and to be
losing its grasp on Eastern Europe.
Wallace said he believes Europe should eventually
deal with the United States as an equal in terms of
world political clout. For Wallace, the future will in
volve a reunified Germany and closer ties between
all European nations. It is crucial that American
diplomats realize this and adjust their policies ac
cordingly, Wallace said.
