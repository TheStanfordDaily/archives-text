# Shriner game profits go to charity
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
The near-capacity crowd that
showed up Saturday at Stanford
Stadium for the East-West Shrine Game
is expected to have helped the
Shriners top $10 million in money
raised for charity during the years the
game has taken place.
The East-West Shrine game, which
this year celebrated its 62-year anniver
sary, is a post-season all-star game for
senior college football players from
across the country. The game is held to
raise money for the Shriners' hospitals

for crippled and burned children.
Profits from tickets sold to the esti
mated crowd of 74,000 that attended
the game under sunny skies Saturday
have not yet been computed, but offi
cials estimate they will be close to last
years profits of more than $287,000.
The money earned from this year's
game should put the combined total
raised for the charity in all the 62 years
of the game "substantially over the $10
million mark," according to Dick
Skuse, the Shriners' public relations
representative.
The Shrine Game has been played at
Stanford since 1974 and "except for

the first year, the move to Stanford has
been a great success," Skuse said. In
the last 10 years, crowds have
exceeded 70,000 for every game, ac
cording to Skuse.
"We used to hold the game at
Candlestick, but I think the atmos
phere here at Stanford has been better
for the game," Skuse said. "After all, it
is a collegiate bowl with collegiate
players, and Stanford Stadium and the
surrounding community is better
suited to our needs."
Stanford charges a usage fee for the
stadium, but the Athletic Department
makes no profit from the game, ac

cording to Barbara Sue Lem Mon, assis
tant to the director of the Athletics and
Recreation Department. "It is a com
munity service, and we (Stanford) are
glad to do it," Lem Mon said.
According to Alan Cummings, the
senior associate director of the Athletic
Department, however, the Shriners
pay Stanford a substantial usage fee of
$100,000 for the stadium.
"From the $100,000 flat fee that we
charge the Shriners, after all the indi
rect and direct costs have been sub
tracted, you could say that Stanford
makes a modest net profit," Cummings
said.
