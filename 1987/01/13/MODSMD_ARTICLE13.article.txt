The University Medical Center's
youngest heart transplant recipient,
Baby Andrew, returned home Sat
urday when a biopsy showed his
body would not reject the heart that
was transplanted Dec. 23-
Andrew, whose parents asked
that his full identification not be dis
closed, set the record for being the
youngest infant to receive a heart
transplant as well as for taking the
least amount of time to receive the
donor heart after its removal from
the donor's body.
At seven and one-half hours, the
process took virtually half as long as
the usual time, according to Dr.
Norman Shumway and Dr. Vaughn
Starnes, who performed the opera
tion.
The heart came to Stanford via
military jet, which traveled to Fargo,
N.D., to collect the organ from a
stranded Lear jet.
A team of six physicians, headed
by Dr. Edward Simpson, made the
trip. The military jet was a National

Guard jet summoned by the gover
nor of North Dakota.
Stanford was the site of the first
heart transplant in the United States
in 1968, when Shumway performed
the technique he developed. Since
then, the number of annual
transplants at Stanford has been in
creasing steadily, growing from 41
in 1985 to 63 last year.
Including Baby Andrew, the total
number of transplants performed at
the University is 431 Ot these, 34 of
the recipients have been under 18
years of age.
Before Andrew, two-and-a-half
year-old Elizabeth Craze was the
youngest recipient when she
received her new heart in October
1984.
A four year-old received a heart
at the center Sept. IS after rejecting
the first transplant, and she remains
in the hospital.
According to Ron Goben, associ
ate director of the Medical Center,
Shumway has expressed an interest
in performing neonatal transplants,
which involve patients between six
and eight weeks of age.
