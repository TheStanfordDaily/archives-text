"Sexploration." It is a game about personal relation
ships and sex, and it just might turn out to be one of Resi
dential Education's better programming ideas this year.
Created and recently introduced here at Stanford, the
game offers students the all-too-rare chance to explore
sexual issues intelligently, but more interestingly, it
amuses as it educates.
Too often, attempts at educating students on sex
related issues fail simply because the approach is too
academic or too boring. No one can become enthused
about a one-page flyer on sexually transmitted diseases.
This time, however, the game's creators have managed
to combine education with entertainment, and they are
making it possible for students to understand and even
laugh about issues that unfortunately are clouded in con
fusion and silence.
This light-hearted approach is superior to stuffy tech
nical lectures and the expensive one-time appearance of
a popular sex therapist, such as Dr. Ruth.
That the game has educational potential is clear. In a
trial run, all five students on a team puzzled over the
word "fornication." Even at Stanford, it seems, there are
people who have never spoken openly about sex.

One of the more educational aspects of the game is
the role-playing situation in which players arc required
to switch male and female roles. This exercise is healthy
and offers students the chance to test and improve their
own understanding of the opposite sex.
To win the game a player must correctly answer a set
number of questions in several different categories, but
there are no losers, since everyone who plays has the op
portunity to learn more about himself or herself and
about personal relationships with others.
The origins of the game are interesting, as well. The
idea was originally conceived in winter 1985 by Douglas
Daher, psychologist at Counseling and Psychological
Services; Alice Supton, assistant dean of Residential Edu
cation; John Dorman, associate director of Cowell; and
Doryn Davis-Chervin, director fo health promotion at
Cowell. This interaction between administrators from
different branches of the University is heartening, espe
cially when the result is so positive.
The game is available to resident assistants and student
groups for students to play in their residences or other
University settings. "Sexploration" is a programming
idea that RAs should not let fall into the collection of
missed opportunities at Stanford.
