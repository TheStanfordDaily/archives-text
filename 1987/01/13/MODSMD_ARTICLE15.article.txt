# About college and the real world
## 
### 
On Dec. 19, 1986, I left campus with mixed
feelings. I was relieved to have finished all my finals
without a major catastrophe. As I headed to San Fran
cisco airport, I almost felt like shouting, "Now I'm
done!"
But then I asked myself, "What have I actually done
over the past quarter?" Feelings of relief then began
to get entangled with doubts. I had spent the quarter
visiting old friends, watching the Red Sox-Mets World

Series, meeting new people, reading about human
psychology, learning about optics and quantum me
chanics, playing Frisbee and writing a seven-page
paper on the role of words in Ch'an Buddhism. But
what did it all mean?
I was getting swept away by a flood of questions I
couldn't answer: "Why are you going to college? Are
you really looking for something other than some
vague notions of personal growth and experimenta
tion? Are you just trying to get a job? Didn't you
decide to go to college because all your friends were
doing the same thing and you didn't know any bet
ter?
"Broadening your knowledge is great and every
thing, but does it really matter in the real world? Do
you think you can learn better from books than from
people who actually do the suffering when the the
ory fails?
"You might have done reasonably well on finals.
But so what? Now you know how to use a Taylor se
ries to estimate the cube root of nine to the fourth
decimal place. You've heard about the photoelectric
effect, Compton effect, Schrodinger equation and all
that, but what's the big deal? How many people in
this world would really benefit from your knowl
edge? And are you putting into practice what you've
learned, or are you just writing papers and taking
tests?"
My biggest fear was coming true — the fear of
being irrelevant. On the plane ride from San Fran
cisco to Nashville, I was questioning the relevance of
everything I'd done for the past 11 weeks. Only
around the end of the trip did 1 decide to start enjoy
ing the Christmas break and stop asking questions.
The vacation indeed seemed to be the medicine.

As I got used to going to bed at 2 a.m. and getting up
at noon, I began to drift away from all those un
answered questions. A series of bowl games and
pitchers of beer at a bluegrass bar certainly helped.
Then one night, having become accustomed to a
nocturnal way of life, I couldn't go to bed. So I
decided to turn on the television. After taking a seat
in the comfortable armchair, I realized I'd tuned in to
"Nightline" — of all programs. The topic of the even
ing was the role of college education. One educator
argued that the purpose of college education is to
provide proper perspective, ethics and intuitive un
derstanding of the world. Then, an engineering
major at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute spoke. In a
matter-of-fact tone, he said, "The reality, once again,
is to get a job."
At that moment, all those unanswered questions
came alive once again, and I realized that all pointed
toward a common theme: the relationship between
the college and the real world. Is the college subor
dinate to the real world? Is it totally isolated from the
real world? Or does the college represent the con
science of the real world? Thinking in the framework
of these three models has helped me to resolve some
of those questions about the relevance of my educa
tion.
The first model views the college as a training in
stitution and diploma factory that helps to get stu
dents adequately prepared to work in the real world.
According to this careerist model, the first and
foremost purpose of attending a college is to get a se
cure job after graduation, and it would be quite natu
ral to ask questions like: "What are you doing with
your classics major? How do you get a job with an En
glish major?"
According to the second model, on the other hand,
the college isn't really related to the real world, and
what you learn at college has little relevance. The
main purpose of attending a college is perhaps to
buy some time and put off the huge task of assuming
financial responsibilities, with the hope of enjoying a
fairly carefree lifestyle on your parents' money. All
you have to do is pay some attention to your
academics. If you want to, you can just learn for the
sake of learning. You don't have to care about what's
going on outside the campus. As one freshman in my
dorm once told me, it is perfectly all right to say, "I
don't know what's going on around this world any
more." As for myself, I remember feeling so helpless
and stupid in my freshman year when the issue of di
vestment was raised at a house meeting. The discus
sion was quite intense and emotional, but it seemed

nobody really knew enough about South Africa to
present a convincing argument. It was so weird: I had
quite a bit of knowledge about some dead philosop
hers' works, but I had little idea about the sufferings
of the blacks in South Africa — some of these people
were dying at the time. Before I came to Stanford, I'd
thought college students would be a lot better in
formed about the world than high school kids, but
none of us there at the house meeting seemed to
qualify as a well-informed intellectuals. We all
seemed to have failed to extend our attention to the
world outside the confines of the campus.
Clearly, this ivory-tower image of the college im
plicit in the second model can be also relevant in the
first model: If you work hard to get a well-paying job
after graduation while remaining oblivious to events
and activities outside the domain of your study, you
would be combining the best features of both
models. In contrast to these two models, the third
model does not view the college as a place for self
indulgence. According to this model, college stu
dents are idealists who fight against ignorance and
injustice to purify the real world.
Perhaps, the true relationship between the college
and the real world is a combination of the character
istics of these three models: A college student is
probably a curious mixture of follower, outsider and
vanguard. As for myself, it doesn't seem all that diffi
cult to fulfill the role of a follower and outsider: All I
have to do is confine myself to my field of study, get
reasonably good grades and remain oblivious to the
events tearing the world apart.
But it now seems clear to me that my college edu
cation would be incomplete if I remain content with
merely training myself for future job opportunities.
College education offers invaluable opportunities to
broaden my understanding of the world and prepare
myself to tackle some of the urgent problems that
many people choose to ignore today. If I deny myself
the chance to make the real world a better place than
what I see today, my diploma would amount only to
an exchange coupon for a secure job. And if I leave
most of my beliefs and ideals behind as I enter the
real world, my college education would be just an
exercise in hypocrisy. Now I know it is one thing to
achieve an intellectual understanding and quite an
other to make an emotional commitment. To make
my college education relevant, I'd better take to the
real world what I've learned in college.
