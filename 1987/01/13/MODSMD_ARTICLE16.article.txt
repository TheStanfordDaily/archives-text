# The 						wide world of sports stupidity
## 
### 
First off, yes ... there is a unifying
theme to this column; it isn't just a col
lection of silly quips and quotes that
reflect what a completely silly world
we live in. Well. OK, that's the purpose,
but not the theme. See if you can figure
it out.

My hometown of Detroit has a slight
problem: It is the undisputed murder
capital of the United States. There were
thousands of attempted killings in
Detroit in 1986, and 646 actual mur
ders, 43 of those victims being under
the age of 17. Authorities also estimate
that there are more guns in Detroit
than citizens.
In the midst of all this carnage, the
city leaders embarked on a wonderful
downtown beautification project. Its
centerpiece is a new statue in the
middle of the city, a 30-foot-long, 20-
foot-tall representation . of Joe Louis'
fist.
Well hey, if you ran a city with such a
bad image problem, wouldn't you also
leap at the chance to erect a gigantic
expression of violence? What an idea.
But instead, let's ignore the brutality
of Detroit and concentrate on mere
stupidity: the University of Southern
California The band from that school,
of course, went with the team to the
Citrus Bowl and had the outright
audacity to play All Right Now" when
its team scored.
OK, so the University of Spoiled

Children doesn't get any points for
originality, but then again, the football
team lost badly enough that the band
only had to get out the music for that
song one time during the game, if you
get what I mean.
Yes, I watched most of the football
bowl games over winter break, and I'm
sure I am not the only one who was
unimpressed with the gala Orange
Bowl halftime show. Let's put it this
way: Imagine all the mistakes in all of
last spring's dorm musicals, all hap
pening in just 10 minutes. This was
worse. The lip-synching of the singers
on the field wasn't too annoying; it was
a little worse than an MTV video and a
little better than a dubbed martial arts
movie. Nor was it so bad to see that
when the camera focused on brass
players in the band, they weren't actu
ally blowing into the instruments. In
fan, two trombone players appeared to
be talking to one another while on na
tional TV.
My favorite part was the 10-foot tall
boxes on the four sides of the stage,
each with big playing cards painted on
the side. I guess what was supposed to
happen was that a small puff of smoke
and a flash would bring down the sides
of the box and a scantily clad woman
would strut out. Of course, the smoke
and flash worked, but the sides didn't
fall down, so technicians in orange
work clothes had to run in and knock
down the boxes, all to the surprise of
the Orange Bowl Parade princesses on
the inside. It was all sort of like
Geraldo Rivera's "Capone's Vaults"
scam, except this time the contents
were there but the opening proce
dures weren't.

I won't even mention that in the big
magic trick in the end of the show, you
could see the parade queen being
raised from under the stage. It's all in
the wrists, right?
That show was technical incom
petence at its best; the CBS coverage of
the Gator Bowl displayed verbal in
competence rivaled only by 20 repeti
tions of "She sells sea shells by the sea

Silly moments of
the year in sports.

shore." In the first quarter (which I'm
sure we'd all like to forget), the an
nouncers twice failed to tell the differ
ence between offense and defense,
and three times confused Clemson
with Stanford.
At least these announcers aren't
employed as coaches. Imagine if one
of them became Joe Kapp's replace
ment at Cal: "Uhh ... yeah ... send in
uhh ... Muster to kick a field goal The
bear will not die. Duh " If this hap
pened, we'd get the Axe back for sure,
as long as the new Bears coach could
remember what the Axe l<x>k.s like.
Perhaps most infuriating about the
Gator Bowl coverage was that at
halftime, instead of showing the in
comparable (and only slightly
reformed, we hope) LSJUMB, CBS
opted instead for a pseudo-scholarly
chat about the drug testing that kept
some players out of bowl games. When
I woke up from that, Stanford had
already scored another 14 points.
The whole issue with steroids and

drug testing for athletes has to make
you ask a few questions about society's
penal system. I mean, players get
booted from a football game for using
steroids (a legal perscription drug),
but UC-Berkeley football players who
are implicated in a gang rape are put
on probation and forced to write
(gosh!) a letter of apology. It makes
you wonder what would happen if
these kids did something really
naughty. Like a felony ... you know:
murder, robbery, extortion, forgery,
etc.
Speaking of players suspended for
using steroids, Oklahoma's Brian Bos
worth showed that he harbored no ill
will after being suspended from the
Orange Bowl by wearing a splendid
NCAA T-shirt. Of course, the letter un
der "NCAA'' spelled out "National
Communists Against Athletics." Now
come on, Brian, I'm sure there are a
few Democratic Socialists mixed in
with that crowd too. Give em a chance.
I'm sure you've all figured out that
the point of this article was just a col
lection of the sillier moments of sports
I saw on TV over the winter break.
Trivial? Perhaps. Then again, the
average American spends several
hours a day watching television, much
of it weekend time watching sports. So
you're welcome to dismiss these inci
dents as freak accidents or jokes played
on us by God, but if this nation falls be
cause we can't build halftime show
expkxio-boxes that flop open on cue,
don't say I didn't warn you.

than citizens.
In the midst of all this carnage, the
city leaders embarked on a wonderful
downtown beautification project. Its
centerpiece is a new statue in the
middle of the city, a 30-foot-long, 20-
foot-tall representation . of Joe Louis'
fist.
Well hey, if you ran a city with such a
bad image problem, wouldn't you also
leap at the chance to erect a gigantic
expression of violence? What an idea.
But instead, let's ignore the brutality
of Detroit and concentrate on mere
stupidity: the University of Southern
California The band from that school,
of course, went with the team to the
Citrus Bowl and had the outright
audacity to play All Right Now" when
its team scored.
OK, so the University of Spoiled

Children doesn't get any points for
originality, but then again, the football
team lost badly enough that the band
only had to get out the music for that
song one time during the game, if you
get what I mean.
Yes, I watched most of the football
bowl games over winter break, and I'm
sure I am not the only one who was
unimpressed with the gala Orange
Bowl halftime show. Let's put it this
way: Imagine all the mistakes in all of
last spring's dorm musicals, all hap
pening in just 10 minutes. This was
worse. The lip-synching of the singers
on the field wasn't too annoying; it was
a little worse than an MTV video and a
little better than a dubbed martial arts
movie. Nor was it so bad to see that
when the camera focused on brass
players in the band, they weren't actu
ally blowing into the instruments. In
fan, two trombone players appeared to
be talking to one another while on na
tional TV.
My favorite part was the 10-foot tall
boxes on the four sides of the stage,
each with big playing cards painted on
the side. I guess what was supposed to
happen was that a small puff of smoke
and a flash would bring down the sides
of the box and a scantily clad woman
would strut out. Of course, the smoke
and flash worked, but the sides didn't
fall down, so technicians in orange
work clothes had to run in and knock
down the boxes, all to the surprise of
the Orange Bowl Parade princesses on
the inside. It was all sort of like
Geraldo Rivera's "Capone's Vaults"
scam, except this time the contents
were there but the opening proce
dures weren't.

I won't even mention that in the big
magic trick in the end of the show, you
could see the parade queen being
raised from under the stage. It's all in
the wrists, right?
That show was technical incom
petence at its best; the CBS coverage of
the Gator Bowl displayed verbal in
competence rivaled only by 20 repeti
tions of "She sells sea shells by the sea

Silly moments of
the year in sports.

shore." In the first quarter (which I'm
sure we'd all like to forget), the an
nouncers twice failed to tell the differ
ence between offense and defense,
and three times confused Clemson
with Stanford.
At least these announcers aren't
employed as coaches. Imagine if one
of them became Joe Kapp's replace
ment at Cal: "Uhh ... yeah ... send in
uhh ... Muster to kick a field goal The
bear will not die. Duh " If this hap
pened, we'd get the Axe back for sure,
as long as the new Bears coach could
remember what the Axe l<x>k.s like.
Perhaps most infuriating about the
Gator Bowl coverage was that at
halftime, instead of showing the in
comparable (and only slightly
reformed, we hope) LSJUMB, CBS
opted instead for a pseudo-scholarly
chat about the drug testing that kept
some players out of bowl games. When
I woke up from that, Stanford had
already scored another 14 points.
The whole issue with steroids and

drug testing for athletes has to make
you ask a few questions about society's
penal system. I mean, players get
booted from a football game for using
steroids (a legal perscription drug),
but UC-Berkeley football players who
are implicated in a gang rape are put
on probation and forced to write
(gosh!) a letter of apology. It makes
you wonder what would happen if
these kids did something really
naughty. Like a felony ... you know:
murder, robbery, extortion, forgery,
etc.
Speaking of players suspended for
using steroids, Oklahoma's Brian Bos
worth showed that he harbored no ill
will after being suspended from the
Orange Bowl by wearing a splendid
NCAA T-shirt. Of course, the letter un
der "NCAA'' spelled out "National
Communists Against Athletics." Now
come on, Brian, I'm sure there are a
few Democratic Socialists mixed in
with that crowd too. Give em a chance.
I'm sure you've all figured out that
the point of this article was just a col
lection of the sillier moments of sports
I saw on TV over the winter break.
Trivial? Perhaps. Then again, the
average American spends several
hours a day watching television, much
of it weekend time watching sports. So
you're welcome to dismiss these inci
dents as freak accidents or jokes played
on us by God, but if this nation falls be
cause we can't build halftime show
expkxio-boxes that flop open on cue,
don't say I didn't warn you.

it out.

My hometown of Detroit has a slight

capital of the United States. There were
