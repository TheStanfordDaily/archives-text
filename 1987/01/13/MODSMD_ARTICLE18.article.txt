Chappie salesman
meant no offense;
Daily negligent
I would like to express my outrage
at the recent letter to the editor
("Chappie sales pitch childish, insult
ing," Daily, Jan. 5) — and subsequent
correction (Daily, Jan. 8). I am a mem
ber of the Chaparral and proud of it! 1
am the man who was up in the tree
attracting customers to our sales
location.
However, this was done with all
good intentions. It was meant to be
humorous and to attract attention. I
did not mean to offend or harass
anyone. I did receive some feedback
while I was up there and after I came
down — all positive (some said it was
a unique pitch, others laughed or
smiled, etc.).
Since the aforementioned article
has appeared, however, I have been
approached and harassed by those
who now interpret my actions in a
different light. I am hurt that anyone
would assume 1 intended to harrass or
"harrow" anyone.
With regard to the accusations •
made by the cowardly, anonymous
author of the letter, I know that my
friends on the Chaparral staff would
do no such thing. We (the Chaparral
staff) categorically deny telling anyone
"a thousand screaming monkies"
would hide under their bed and give
them the "heebie-jeebies" or that
their "hair would turn into spaghetti"
or their "mind will turn into
cheesecake."
In addition to taking offense to the
author of these remarks we also feel
that The Daily was negligent in not
verifying the story before publishing
it. Indeed, we always believed it was
Daily policy to contact the author of a
letter to the editor to verify the story
before publishing it. Obviously this
did not take place since the person
whose name appeared with the letter
did not write it, nor does The Daily
even know who did (as was noted in
the correction). Has The Daily ever
heard of journalsitic integrity?! We feel

that the character of the Chappie has
suffered an irreparable blow and that
The Daily is at least in part respon
sible.

Daily coverage
of Jackson's visit
wrongly focused
How wonderful the Rev. Jesse
Jackson will be speaking at Stanford
Thursday to commemorate Martin
Luther Kingjr.'s birthday. How unfor
tunate The Daily has chosen to focus
its brief and somewhat inaccurate
coverage of the event solely on Jack
son's honorarium.
A recent article (Daily, Jan. 9)
focused entirely on the circumstances
surrounding how much money Jack
son's honorarium would be. The Rev.
Jackson today stands in a class by
himself in terms of the positive impact
he and the Rainbow Coalition have
had on this country and people of
color in particular. He is continuing in
the legacy of Dr. King in speaking out
against racism and oppression. He is
deserving of whatever honorarium the
Black Student Union can negotiate.
What the article did not focus on is
the historical significance of Jackson's
visit, or the BSU's accomplishment in
negotiating his visit when he is clearly
one of the most sought-after figures to
address Dr. King's life and everything
he stands for. Regardless of the
honorarium, we should realize and
appreciate the historic nature his visit,
that it was 20 years ago when Dr. King
first spoke at Stanford, and that this
Thursday, on the 20th anniversary of
the BSU, the Rev. Jesse Jackson will
continue that legacy.
