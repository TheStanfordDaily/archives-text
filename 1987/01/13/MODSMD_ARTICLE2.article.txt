# Tresidder director to resign
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior stafF writer 
The director of Tresidder Union will
be leaving her post in 10 days, but the
successor to the sometimes controver
sial job is not expected to be named
for at least nine months, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons said yesterday.
Ellie Oppenheim, who has headed
the student union since 1980, will
resign Jan. 23 to become assistant di
rector of the San Jose Department of
Parks and Recreation.
Lyons said a lengthy nation-wide
search for a replacement is "common
for a position at this level, and we will
take the opportunity to pause and
assess the role of Tresidder in the Uni
versity."
Tresidder has been criticized in
recent years as primarily concerned
with profit-making rather than with
providing a comfortable and functional
student meeting place.
Lyons said he hopes to see an in
terim arrangement to run Tresidder
put in place by the end of next week,
adding that he would like "to see the
planning process on facility changes,
which were initiated by Ellie, con
tinue."
But other recent changes, including
the student manager program, should
be "allowed to be discussed as to
whether those efforts worked," accord
ing to Lyons.
Plans have begun for a two-story ad
dition to the Tresidder balcony to pro
vide offices for student groups, but
those efforts have been stalled since
the fall because of difficulties in obtain
ing funds, Lyons said.
Hiring student managers at Tresid
der also began under Oppenheim last
year and will be one of the issues dis
cussed in five to seven weeks of con
versations with students, student
groups and others involved with the
University. The conversations are
meant "to determine what the direc
tion of Tresidder should be before the
search (for a new head) is begun,"
Lyons said.
Student relations with Tresidder hit
a low point last year when union offi
cials decided to turn over the student
run Coffee House to Saga Foods, and
there was "discontent with Tresidder
for about two years before that," ac
cording to Council of Presidents mem
ber Kim Crawford.
Crawford said, however, that this
year's COP has found Oppenheim to
be "great" in increasing student
decision-making for Tresidder in a
year characterized by a "rebuilding" of
the relationship between the ASSU and
the student union.
"I hope that students will be able to
play a role in the search (for Oppen
heim's replacement)," Crawford said.
