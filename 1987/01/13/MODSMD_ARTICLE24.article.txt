Their labor is fruit, and the whole
campus enjoys the fruits of their labor.
For 17 years, the Dallas family has
sold fresh fruit from a stand next to the
Stanford Bookstore.
Maria Dallas and her husband Tom
began selling fruit at Stanford in 1968.
When Tom died in 1984, Maria retired,
only to reopen the stand about a year
later with her son Paul, a retired pilot.
Paul and Maria have run the stand to
gether ever since. Clearly, it's a labor of
love.
"I love students," Maria says. "1 love
youth, I love life."
The fruit enterprise is the latest in a
long line of Dallas partnerships that
began with Tom and Maria's marriage
in 1941. The couple's story reads like
the script of a Hollywood movie.
Maria met Tom on a boat coming to
the United States from Italy in 1937.
Tom was a refugee of the war that Mus
solini was fighting in Africa, and Maria
was a "very successful (dress) design
er" coming to America with her family.
"He was really pleasant," Maria says

of her first meeting with Tom.
Eventually, the two ended up to
gether in Boston, where Maria de
signed dresses and Tom worked as a
chef in a local restaurant.
But the two didn't tie the knot until
1941.
"He waited three years for me. Then
I realized it was true love," Maria says.
Eventually, not even true love could
persuade Maria to remain in Boston
any longer. The cold weather and at
tendant frustrations made Maria turn
her eyes back to Italy.
"One day I see Tom come in, 1 say
Torn, I'm sick and tired. I think we
should go back to Italy,' " Maria says.
Tom, however, "didn't like Italy"
and proposed that the family go to Cal
ifornia instead.
So Maria and Tom packed their
belongings and their two young sons
(ages 6 and 7 at that point) into their
'38 Packard and headed west.
They settled in San Lorenzo, in the
East Bay. After a time, they opened two
restaurants, one in Palo Alto and the
other in San Francisco.
When they tired of the restaurant
business, they turned to selling fruit.
Originally, they set up shop under

the trees in the middle of White Plaza,
where other merchants now ply their
wares. Again, Maria called for a reloca
tion.
"One day, I said, I'm going over
there,'" she says of her move to the
Bookstore location. "(The manager of
the Bookstore) said, 'Maria, you can
just be here."'
Over time, the Dallas fruit business
"became just like an asset to the
Bookstore," Maria says. But there is no
formal agreement — financial or
otherwise — between the two busi
nesses. The connection is strictly a per
sonal one.
"They (the Bookstore) trust us so
well. We love them, too," Maria says.
Both Maria and Paul seem to draw
energy and inspiration from their
work.
"Students are so nice, which gives
me the hope that we're going to have a
better world," Maria says."The chal
lenge here comes from the students;
they are so intelligent ... everybody is
so cooperative, gentle; everybody says
'Hello.' "
Maria says students who are going
overseas to Italy will stop to ask her
questions, and other student friends
stop to show her the A' they got in a
[ class.
For Paul, talking to students and cus
tomers is "the best part of the job."
"I've found, having some daughters
myself, that nothing comes close (to
Stanford students). These are abso

lutely the most well-educated students
... 1 can hardly think of one or two in
three years that have anything wrong
with them.
"It's really quite a ball, because
you're right here in the middle, in the
main thoroughfare of traffic," he says.
Paul's day begins at 2 a.m., when he
gets up in order to arrive at the Golden
Gate Produce Company in South San
Francisco by 3 a.m. to get that day's
supply of fruit. By 6 o'clock he is back

in Menlo Park to pick up Maria, and the
two are set up at the Bookstore by 8
o'clock.
Paul also picks up and delivers or
ders for several residences on campus,
including Storey House and Casa
Italiana.
Paul worked selling fruit to get him
self through pilot school, and he was
happy to return to the work when he
saw a chance to get his mother back
out of the house.

"She really wasn't doing anything
after my dad died," Paul says. "We
wanted to get her going again."
"1 stopped for about a year," Maria
says."I thought 1 couldn't make it."
But make it she has. And Maria Dal
las sounds as though she couldn't he
happier.
"When I pray, I say God, you are so
good to me,' " she says."I feel so
happy. 1 was happy when I was born. I
was happy all my life."

Still life with vendors and fruit. Maria Dallas has been selling fruit next to the Bookstore for 17 years. Her son Paul
joined her in the business three years ago.
Their labor is fruit, and the whole
campus enjoys the fruits of their labor.
For 17 years, the Dallas family has
sold fresh fruit from a stand next to the
Stanford Bookstore.
Maria Dallas and her husband Tom
began selling fruit at Stanford in 1968.
When Tom died in 1984, Maria retired,
only to reopen the stand about a year
later with her son Paul, a retired pilot.
Paul and Maria have run the stand to
gether ever since. Clearly, it's a labor of
love.
"I love students," Maria says. "1 love
youth, I love life."
The fruit enterprise is the latest in a
long line of Dallas partnerships that
began with Tom and Maria's marriage
in 1941. The couple's story reads like
the script of a Hollywood movie.
Maria met Tom on a boat coming to
the United States from Italy in 1937.
Tom was a refugee of the war that Mus
solini was fighting in Africa, and Maria
was a "very successful (dress) design
er" coming to America with her family.
"He was really pleasant," Maria says

of her first meeting with Tom.
Eventually, the two ended up to
gether in Boston, where Maria de
signed dresses and Tom worked as a
chef in a local restaurant.
But the two didn't tie the knot until
1941.
"He waited three years for me. Then
I realized it was true love," Maria says.
Eventually, not even true love could
persuade Maria to remain in Boston
any longer. The cold weather and at
tendant frustrations made Maria turn
her eyes back to Italy.
"One day I see Tom come in, 1 say
Torn, I'm sick and tired. I think we
should go back to Italy,' " Maria says.
Tom, however, "didn't like Italy"
and proposed that the family go to Cal
ifornia instead.
So Maria and Tom packed their
belongings and their two young sons
(ages 6 and 7 at that point) into their
'38 Packard and headed west.
They settled in San Lorenzo, in the
East Bay. After a time, they opened two
restaurants, one in Palo Alto and the
other in San Francisco.
When they tired of the restaurant
business, they turned to selling fruit.
Originally, they set up shop under

the trees in the middle of White Plaza,
where other merchants now ply their
wares. Again, Maria called for a reloca
tion.
"One day, I said, I'm going over
there,'" she says of her move to the
Bookstore location. "(The manager of
the Bookstore) said, 'Maria, you can
just be here."'
Over time, the Dallas fruit business
"became just like an asset to the
Bookstore," Maria says. But there is no
formal agreement — financial or
otherwise — between the two busi
nesses. The connection is strictly a per
sonal one.
"They (the Bookstore) trust us so
well. We love them, too," Maria says.
Both Maria and Paul seem to draw
energy and inspiration from their
work.
"Students are so nice, which gives
me the hope that we're going to have a
better world," Maria says."The chal
lenge here comes from the students;
they are so intelligent ... everybody is
so cooperative, gentle; everybody says
'Hello.' "
Maria says students who are going
overseas to Italy will stop to ask her
questions, and other student friends
stop to show her the A' they got in a
[ class.
For Paul, talking to students and cus
tomers is "the best part of the job."
"I've found, having some daughters
myself, that nothing comes close (to
Stanford students). These are abso

lutely the most well-educated students
... 1 can hardly think of one or two in
three years that have anything wrong
with them.
"It's really quite a ball, because
you're right here in the middle, in the
main thoroughfare of traffic," he says.
Paul's day begins at 2 a.m., when he
gets up in order to arrive at the Golden
Gate Produce Company in South San
Francisco by 3 a.m. to get that day's
supply of fruit. By 6 o'clock he is back

in Menlo Park to pick up Maria, and the
two are set up at the Bookstore by 8
o'clock.
Paul also picks up and delivers or
ders for several residences on campus,
including Storey House and Casa
Italiana.
Paul worked selling fruit to get him
self through pilot school, and he was
happy to return to the work when he
saw a chance to get his mother back
out of the house.

"She really wasn't doing anything
after my dad died," Paul says. "We
wanted to get her going again."
"1 stopped for about a year," Maria
says."I thought 1 couldn't make it."
But make it she has. And Maria Dal
las sounds as though she couldn't he
happier.
"When I pray, I say God, you are so
good to me,' " she says."I feel so
happy. 1 was happy when I was born. I
was happy all my life."
