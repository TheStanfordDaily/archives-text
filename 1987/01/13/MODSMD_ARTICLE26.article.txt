## Meinert, Reveno star in reserve roles Stanford subs come off bench to help Card into tie for 2nd 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
When Stanford's starting lineup was
introduced before Saturday night's
game against Washington State, the
Maples Pavilion announcer mistakenly
put Scott Meinert at Novian Whitsitt's
off-guard position.
The error was an understandable
one, because Meinert began his Stan
ford career two years ago as a shooting
guard. And on Saturday, it appeared
that he belonged anywhere but on the
sidelines, as the redshirt sophomore
— now the backup point guard behind
Terry Taylor — scored 14 points and
made two crucial steals in the Card
inal's 93-76 win.
The announcer didn't include Eric
Reveno in the Stanford lineup, but ac
cording to Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery, he might as well have.
"Rev, as far as I'm concerned, is a
starter," Montgomery said. "He really
gives us a lift. We've got to get him in
the ballgame."
Reveno got into the ballgame for 23
minutes Saturday night and made the
most of them, scoring a career-high 19
points while shooting seven of 10 from
the floor. He also yanked down four
rebounds.
"If they're gonna play like that all the
time, you think they would be on the
bench?" Washington State Coach Len
Stevens asked after his team had been
unexpectedly victimized.
Easily the most improved player on
the Stanford team this year, Reveno
had on full display the repertoire of
moves he perfected over the summer
— the jump-hook in the lane, the spin

ning baseline jumper and the pump
fake-and-I'll-take-three-on-that-one
jumper that led to three Reveno three
point plays.
"1 know I can do those things,"
Reveno said. "I'm not playing out of
myself."
While Reveno scored nine first-half
points Saturday, Meinert's start was a

little less auspicious. In just four
minutes, Meinert committed one foul
and three turnovers and did not score.
"If anything good did come out of
the first half, it was that I was so upset
with myself after a few of those beauti
ful bounce passes I threw (for turn
overs)," Meinert said. "I didn't know
whether coach was going to put me
back in."
Montgomery had no qualms about
using Meinert again. "Scott's a good
shooter, he's capable of scoring in
bunches, and he knows the game,"
Montgomery said.
Meinert re-entered the game with
about 14 minutes left and Stanford

clinging to a two-point lead, and he
shortly led a spurt that put the Cardinal
in control.
In a space of just three minutes,
Meinert made a steal and a layup, made
another steal that turned into two
Howard Wright free throws, hit two
outside jumpers and converted an
other layup that gave Stanford a 71-58

lead with 8:29 to go. For the game,
Meinert sank six of his seven shots
from the floor.
"When he has his confidence going,
he can do a lot of things," starting point
guard Terry Taylor said.
Meinert didn't do much of anything
during his first two years at Stanford,
playing sparingly his freshman year
(1984-85) and redshirting last year due
to a series of ankle injuries and the fact
that former coach Tom Davis thought
he should be a better defensive player.
But with the graduation of Keith
Ramee, the decision of John Paye not

Sophomore guard Scott Meinert has backed up starter Terry Taylor admirably this season, scoring 14 points and
making two steals in Stanford's 93-76 win over Washington State at home last Saturday. Meinert was six of seven
from the floor.
