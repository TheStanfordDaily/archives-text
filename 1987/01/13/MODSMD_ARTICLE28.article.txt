# Stanford's Elway leads Broncos to Pasadena
## 
### 
CLEVELAND (AP) —John Elway is fi
nally going to the Rose Bowl.
"We're going to Pasadena, the place
I was never able to get to in college,"
the former Stanford quarterback said
Sunday after he and the Denver
Broncos became the AFC champions
by beating the favored Cleveland
Browns 23-20 in overtime. "I didn't
think this would ever happen."
The comeback victory sent the
Broncos into the Super Bowl Jan. 25 at
the Rose Bowl against the New York
Giants, who beat the Washington
Redskins 17-0 Sunday for the NFC title.
It also buried the last of any doubts
about Elway's talent or desire.
The 26-year-old quarterback ran for
20 yards, offsetting an eight-yard sack,
and passed for 78 on a 98-yard drive
that tied the game with 37 seconds
remaining in regulation.
"John got in the huddle, looked at us
and stared," receiver Steve Watson
said. "He was all cool, as cool as he
could be. He smiled at us and said,
'Fellas, if we work hard, good things
are going to happen.' And that's what
happened."
In overtime, Elway hit two long
passes on the Broncos' first possession
to set up Rich Karlis' game-winning,
33-yard field goal.
"There are still going to be critics,
but 1 just have to continue to do the
best that I can," said Elway, who was

unable to lead his college team to the
Rose Bowl and then lost in both of his
NFL playoff appearances before this
year.
"I was expected to walk on water
when I came into this league," Elway
said. "The more I wanted it, the harder
I tried and the worse it seemed to get."
His work this season, however,
earned Elway a trip to the Pro Bowl —
and, now, the Super Bowl.
Elway completed 22 of 38 passes for
244 yards on Sunday, and he
scrambled four times for another 56
yards.
"It really hurts him to hear the
criticism," Denver Coach Dan Reeves
said. "I could see the determination in
his eyes today like I've never seen
before."
Denver trailed 20-13 after Cleveland
scored on a 48-yard pass from Bernie
Kosar to Brian Brennan with 5:43 to
play.
Ken Bell couldn't handle a knuck
leball of a kickoff after Cleveland's go
ahead score, and after fumbling
around for it, teammate Gene Lang
barely managed to fall on it at the Den
ver 2.
It seemed the Broncos' road to the
Super Bowl had reached a dead end.
"The kickoff came down like a
knuckleball," Reeves said. "You can't
blame Kenny."

"After the game last week, I knew
anything was possible," Cleveland cor
nerback Hanford Dixon said of the
Browns' 23-20 double-overtime victory
over the New York Jets. "We still had to
go out and stop them, which we
didn't."

Elway, once an outstanding baseball
prospect who must have been backed
into a corner by a knuckleball before,
shrugged off this one and leaned into
the huddle.
"I just said, 'Let's go,' " he said.
"There wasn't a whole lot said. We
were ready and the crowd was getting
rowdy.
"I knew we had plenty of time to get
it in."

Elway got Denver some room to
operate on the first play, a five-yard
pass to Sammy Winder. It was Reeves'
call.
"I told John to run the fire pass
down and in," Reeves said. "He hit
Sammy on the shoot route. We had to

'We're going to
Pasadena, the
place I was never
able to get to in
college.'
—John Elway

go after it; we had to be aggressive on
that drive."
Then Winder took a pitchout and
ran for three yards and the Broncos
called time to discuss the third-and
two problem at the 10. They barely
solved it as Winder struggled for the
two yards and a first down.
Winder again, for three yards. And
then Elway took over.
He dropped back to pass, but was

rushed out of the pocket and scam
pered for 11 yards on a sore ankle and
another first down to the 26. Back to
pass again, he hit wide receiver Steve
Sewell down the middle for 22 yards to
the Denver 48 and another first down.
That pass "got us good field posi
tion," Reeves said.
Then it was Klway throwing 12 yards
to Steve Watson and another first
down. Denver was in Cleveland terri
tory at the 40.
Elway's next pass to Vance Johnson
fell incomplete and then Elway was
sacked for only the second time in the
game, by nose tackle Dave Puzzuoli for
an eight-yard loss to the 48. The crowd
was ready to pack for Pasadena.
It was third-and-18, the clock was
down to 1:47, and Denver called an
other timeout. Elway and Reeves talked
on the sidelines about what could be
done to save the drive — and the
season.
"Dan said, Just try to get half of it,' "
Elway said.
"We were kind of picking them apart
underneath all day, so I was going to
take a shot downfield."
As 79,915 spectators began a deafen
ing roar, Elway dropped back to pass
and rifled a shot downfield to Mark
Jackson, who grabbed it at the
Cleveland 28. First down.
"Their safeties were playing real
deep, and Mark did a great job of fin

ding the hole for me," Elway said. "I
just put the ball there, plus I had plenty
of time to throw it."
"I guess we were playing more
coverage," Cleveland's All-Pro
linebacker Chip Banks said. "We didn't
try to blitz him."
Elway had the Broncos on the
Browns' 28 with 1:19 showing on the
clock.
He faded to pass again and hit Wat
son in the right side of the end zone,
but the receiver was unable to stay in
bounds.
Nine seconds ticked off the clock.
Elway again went back to pass. Com
plete, to Sewell. Fifty-seven seconds
left.
Second down and 10, Elway, back to
pass again, was flushed from the
pocket. He took off for the right side
and looked like he might cover the
final 14 yards himself. But linebacker
Clay Matthews appeared and knocked
him out of bounds at the five. Only
three seconds elapsed.
Another third-down play, one yard
for the first down, five for the score.
Elway called the play in the huddle:
"Release 66."
The Broncos came to the line, Elway
barked the signals, 39 seconds showed
on the clock.

The ball was snapped, Elway took
three steps back, Jackson made a quick
slant into the end zone, Elway threw a
strike and Jackson went to the ground
to make the catch. Touchdown.
The Broncos had covered 98 yards

on 15 plays in 4:55.
"We didn't think we'd have to go
into overtime, but we've been there
before and we had the opportunities,'.'
said Kosar, whose two first-half inter
ceptions spoiled an otherwise good
day. He finished with 18 completions
in 32 attempts for 259 yards and two
touchdowns.
The Denver defense shut the
Browns down on their one overtime
possession.
The Broncos then took a punt at
their own 25 and needed nine plays to
win it. Elway threw 22 yards to Orson
Mobley and 28 to Watson to move the
ball into range for Karlis.
Elway scrambled away from the pass
rush before completing the pass to
Watson, who took the ball to the
Cleveland 22.
"We were in a zone coverage then,"
Dixon said. "I broke up to cover the
run, and Felix Wright was coming over
the top (to cover Watson)."
Wright got there too late, however,
and four plays later, Karlis ended it

with a kick that barely got inside the
left upright.
It was the Broncos' first playoff vic
tory ever on the road after three losses.
They had not played in an overtime
game previously this season, while
Cleveland had won three overtime
games including the playoff victory
over the Jets.
Cleveland had taken a 7-0 lead on
Kosar's six-yard pass to Herman Fon
tenot in the first quarter, played in 30-
degree weather with occasional snow
flurries and a 14 rnph wind blowing in
off Lake Erie.
A 19-yard Karlis field goal and
Gerald Willhite's one-yard touchdown
run — both set up by Cleveland turn
overs — gave Denver a 10-7 lead, but
Cleveland's Mark Moseley tied it with a
29-yard field goal just before the half.
After field goals by Moseley and
Karlis extended the tie to 13-13, Bren
nan caught a Kosar bomb at the 18-
yard line and ran past fallen safety Den
nis Smith for a 48-yard touchdown
with 5:43 left in regulation.

"I just said, 'Let's go,' " he said.
"There wasn't a whole lot said. We
were ready and the crowd was getting
rowdy.
"I knew we had plenty of time to get
it in."

Elway got Denver some room to
operate on the first play, a five-yard
pass to Sammy Winder. It was Reeves'
call.
"I told John to run the fire pass
down and in," Reeves said. "He hit
Sammy on the shoot route. We had to

'We're going to
Pasadena, the
place I was never
able to get to in
college.'
—John Elway

go after it; we had to be aggressive on
that drive."
Then Winder took a pitchout and
ran for three yards and the Broncos
called time to discuss the third-and
two problem at the 10. They barely
solved it as Winder struggled for the
two yards and a first down.
Winder again, for three yards. And
then Elway took over.
He dropped back to pass, but was

rushed out of the pocket and scam
pered for 11 yards on a sore ankle and
another first down to the 26. Back to
pass again, he hit wide receiver Steve
Sewell down the middle for 22 yards to
the Denver 48 and another first down.
That pass "got us good field posi
tion," Reeves said.
Then it was Klway throwing 12 yards
to Steve Watson and another first
down. Denver was in Cleveland terri
tory at the 40.
Elway's next pass to Vance Johnson
fell incomplete and then Elway was
sacked for only the second time in the
game, by nose tackle Dave Puzzuoli for
an eight-yard loss to the 48. The crowd
was ready to pack for Pasadena.
It was third-and-18, the clock was
down to 1:47, and Denver called an
other timeout. Elway and Reeves talked
on the sidelines about what could be
done to save the drive — and the
season.
"Dan said, Just try to get half of it,' "
Elway said.
"We were kind of picking them apart
underneath all day, so I was going to
take a shot downfield."
As 79,915 spectators began a deafen
ing roar, Elway dropped back to pass
and rifled a shot downfield to Mark
Jackson, who grabbed it at the
Cleveland 28. First down.
"Their safeties were playing real
deep, and Mark did a great job of fin

ding the hole for me," Elway said. "I
just put the ball there, plus I had plenty
of time to throw it."
"I guess we were playing more
coverage," Cleveland's All-Pro
linebacker Chip Banks said. "We didn't
try to blitz him."
Elway had the Broncos on the
Browns' 28 with 1:19 showing on the
clock.
He faded to pass again and hit Wat
son in the right side of the end zone,
but the receiver was unable to stay in
bounds.
Nine seconds ticked off the clock.
Elway again went back to pass. Com
plete, to Sewell. Fifty-seven seconds
left.
Second down and 10, Elway, back to
pass again, was flushed from the
pocket. He took off for the right side
and looked like he might cover the
final 14 yards himself. But linebacker
Clay Matthews appeared and knocked
him out of bounds at the five. Only
three seconds elapsed.
Another third-down play, one yard
for the first down, five for the score.
Elway called the play in the huddle:
"Release 66."
The Broncos came to the line, Elway
barked the signals, 39 seconds showed
on the clock.

The ball was snapped, Elway took
three steps back, Jackson made a quick
slant into the end zone, Elway threw a
strike and Jackson went to the ground
to make the catch. Touchdown.
The Broncos had covered 98 yards

on 15 plays in 4:55.
"We didn't think we'd have to go
into overtime, but we've been there
before and we had the opportunities,'.'
said Kosar, whose two first-half inter
ceptions spoiled an otherwise good
day. He finished with 18 completions
in 32 attempts for 259 yards and two
touchdowns.
The Denver defense shut the
Browns down on their one overtime
possession.
The Broncos then took a punt at
their own 25 and needed nine plays to
win it. Elway threw 22 yards to Orson
Mobley and 28 to Watson to move the
ball into range for Karlis.
Elway scrambled away from the pass
rush before completing the pass to
Watson, who took the ball to the
Cleveland 22.
"We were in a zone coverage then,"
Dixon said. "I broke up to cover the
run, and Felix Wright was coming over
the top (to cover Watson)."
Wright got there too late, however,
and four plays later, Karlis ended it

with a kick that barely got inside the
left upright.
It was the Broncos' first playoff vic
tory ever on the road after three losses.
They had not played in an overtime
game previously this season, while
Cleveland had won three overtime
games including the playoff victory
over the Jets.
Cleveland had taken a 7-0 lead on
Kosar's six-yard pass to Herman Fon
tenot in the first quarter, played in 30-
degree weather with occasional snow
flurries and a 14 rnph wind blowing in
off Lake Erie.
A 19-yard Karlis field goal and
Gerald Willhite's one-yard touchdown
run — both set up by Cleveland turn
overs — gave Denver a 10-7 lead, but
Cleveland's Mark Moseley tied it with a
29-yard field goal just before the half.
After field goals by Moseley and
Karlis extended the tie to 13-13, Bren
nan caught a Kosar bomb at the 18-
yard line and ran past fallen safety Den
nis Smith for a 48-yard touchdown
with 5:43 left in regulation.
CLEVELAND (AP) —John Elway is fi
nally going to the Rose Bowl.
"We're going to Pasadena, the place
I was never able to get to in college,"
the former Stanford quarterback said
Sunday after he and the Denver
Broncos became the AFC champions
by beating the favored Cleveland
Browns 23-20 in overtime. "I didn't
think this would ever happen."
The comeback victory sent the
Broncos into the Super Bowl Jan. 25 at
the Rose Bowl against the New York
Giants, who beat the Washington
Redskins 17-0 Sunday for the NFC title.
It also buried the last of any doubts
about Elway's talent or desire.
The 26-year-old quarterback ran for
20 yards, offsetting an eight-yard sack,
and passed for 78 on a 98-yard drive
that tied the game with 37 seconds
remaining in regulation.
"John got in the huddle, looked at us
and stared," receiver Steve Watson
said. "He was all cool, as cool as he
could be. He smiled at us and said,
'Fellas, if we work hard, good things
are going to happen.' And that's what
happened."
In overtime, Elway hit two long
passes on the Broncos' first possession
to set up Rich Karlis' game-winning,
33-yard field goal.
"There are still going to be critics,
but 1 just have to continue to do the
best that I can," said Elway, who was

unable to lead his college team to the
Rose Bowl and then lost in both of his
NFL playoff appearances before this
year.
"I was expected to walk on water
when I came into this league," Elway
said. "The more I wanted it, the harder
I tried and the worse it seemed to get."
His work this season, however,
earned Elway a trip to the Pro Bowl —
and, now, the Super Bowl.
Elway completed 22 of 38 passes for
244 yards on Sunday, and he
scrambled four times for another 56
yards.
"It really hurts him to hear the
criticism," Denver Coach Dan Reeves
said. "I could see the determination in
his eyes today like I've never seen
before."
Denver trailed 20-13 after Cleveland
scored on a 48-yard pass from Bernie
Kosar to Brian Brennan with 5:43 to
play.
Ken Bell couldn't handle a knuck
leball of a kickoff after Cleveland's go
ahead score, and after fumbling
around for it, teammate Gene Lang
barely managed to fall on it at the Den
ver 2.
It seemed the Broncos' road to the
Super Bowl had reached a dead end.
"The kickoff came down like a
knuckleball," Reeves said. "You can't
blame Kenny."

"After the game last week, I knew
anything was possible," Cleveland cor
nerback Hanford Dixon said of the
Browns' 23-20 double-overtime victory
over the New York Jets. "We still had to
go out and stop them, which we
didn't."

Elway, once an outstanding baseball
prospect who must have been backed
into a corner by a knuckleball before,
shrugged off this one and leaned into
the huddle.
"I just said, 'Let's go,' " he said.
"There wasn't a whole lot said. We

and looked like he might cover the
final 14 yards himself. But linebacker
Clay Matthews appeared and knocked
him out of bounds at the five. Only
three seconds elapsed.
Another third-down play, one yard
for the first down, five for the score.
Elway called the play in the huddle:
"Release 66."
The Broncos came to the line, Elway
barked the signals, 39 seconds showed
on the clock.

The ball was snapped, Elway took
three steps back, Jackson made a quick
slant into the end zone, Elway threw a
strike and Jackson went to the ground
to make the catch. Touchdown.
The Broncos had covered 98 yards

on 15 plays in 4:55.
"We didn't think we'd have to go
into overtime, but we've been there
before and we had the opportunities,'.'
said Kosar, whose two first-half inter
ceptions spoiled an otherwise good
day. He finished with 18 completions
in 32 attempts for 259 yards and two
touchdowns.
The Denver defense shut the
Browns down on their one overtime
possession.
The Broncos then took a punt at
their own 25 and needed nine plays to
win it. Elway threw 22 yards to Orson
Mobley and 28 to Watson to move the
ball into range for Karlis.
Elway scrambled away from the pass
rush before completing the pass to
Watson, who took the ball to the
Cleveland 22.
"We were in a zone coverage then,"
Dixon said. "I broke up to cover the
run, and Felix Wright was coming over
the top (to cover Watson)."
Wright got there too late, however,
and four plays later, Karlis ended it

with a kick that barely got inside the
left upright.
It was the Broncos' first playoff vic
tory ever on the road after three losses.
They had not played in an overtime
game previously this season, while
Cleveland had won three overtime
games including the playoff victory
over the Jets.
Cleveland had taken a 7-0 lead on
Kosar's six-yard pass to Herman Fon
tenot in the first quarter, played in 30-
degree weather with occasional snow
flurries and a 14 rnph wind blowing in
off Lake Erie.
A 19-yard Karlis field goal and
Gerald Willhite's one-yard touchdown
run — both set up by Cleveland turn
overs — gave Denver a 10-7 lead, but
Cleveland's Mark Moseley tied it with a
29-yard field goal just before the half.
After field goals by Moseley and
Karlis extended the tie to 13-13, Bren
nan caught a Kosar bomb at the 18-
yard line and ran past fallen safety Den
nis Smith for a 48-yard touchdown
with 5:43 left in regulation.
CLEVELAND (AP) —John Elway is fi
nally going to the Rose Bowl.
"We're going to Pasadena, the place
I was never able to get to in college,"
the former Stanford quarterback said
Sunday after he and the Denver
Broncos became the AFC champions
by beating the favored Cleveland
Browns 23-20 in overtime. "I didn't
think this would ever happen."
The comeback victory sent the
Broncos into the Super Bowl Jan. 25 at
the Rose Bowl against the New York
Giants, who beat the Washington
Redskins 17-0 Sunday for the NFC title.
It also buried the last of any doubts
about Elway's talent or desire.
The 26-year-old quarterback ran for
20 yards, offsetting an eight-yard sack,
and passed for 78 on a 98-yard drive
that tied the game with 37 seconds
remaining in regulation.
"John got in the huddle, looked at us
and stared," receiver Steve Watson
said. "He was all cool, as cool as he
could be. He smiled at us and said,
'Fellas, if we work hard, good things
are going to happen.' And that's what
happened."
In overtime, Elway hit two long
passes on the Broncos' first possession
to set up Rich Karlis' game-winning,
33-yard field goal.
"There are still going to be critics,
but 1 just have to continue to do the
best that I can," said Elway, who was

unable to lead his college team to the
Rose Bowl and then lost in both of his
NFL playoff appearances before this
year.
"I was expected to walk on water
when I came into this league," Elway
said. "The more I wanted it, the harder
I tried and the worse it seemed to get."
His work this season, however,
earned Elway a trip to the Pro Bowl —
and, now, the Super Bowl.
Elway completed 22 of 38 passes for
244 yards on Sunday, and he
scrambled four times for another 56
yards.
"It really hurts him to hear the
criticism," Denver Coach Dan Reeves
said. "I could see the determination in
his eyes today like I've never seen
before."
Denver trailed 20-13 after Cleveland
scored on a 48-yard pass from Bernie
Kosar to Brian Brennan with 5:43 to
play.
Ken Bell couldn't handle a knuck
leball of a kickoff after Cleveland's go
ahead score, and after fumbling
around for it, teammate Gene Lang
barely managed to fall on it at the Den
ver 2.
It seemed the Broncos' road to the
Super Bowl had reached a dead end.
"The kickoff came down like a
knuckleball," Reeves said. "You can't
blame Kenny."

"After the game last week, I knew
anything was possible," Cleveland cor
nerback Hanford Dixon said of the
Browns' 23-20 double-overtime victory
over the New York Jets. "We still had to
go out and stop them, which we
didn't."

Elway, once an outstanding baseball
prospect who must have been backed
into a corner by a knuckleball before,
shrugged off this one and leaned into
the huddle.
"I just said, 'Let's go,' " he said.
"There wasn't a whole lot said. We
were ready and the crowd was getting
rowdy.
"I knew we had plenty of time to get
it in."

Elway got Denver some room to
operate on the first play, a five-yard
pass to Sammy Winder. It was Reeves'
call.
"I told John to run the fire pass
down and in," Reeves said. "He hit
Sammy on the shoot route. We had to

'We're going to
Pasadena, the
place I was never
able to get to in
college.'
—John Elway

go after it; we had to be aggressive on
that drive."
Then Winder took a pitchout and
ran for three yards and the Broncos
called time to discuss the third-and
two problem at the 10. They barely
solved it as Winder struggled for the
two yards and a first down.
Winder again, for three yards. And
then Elway took over.
He dropped back to pass, but was

rushed out of the pocket and scam
pered for 11 yards on a sore ankle and
another first down to the 26. Back to
pass again, he hit wide receiver Steve
Sewell down the middle for 22 yards to
the Denver 48 and another first down.
That pass "got us good field posi
tion," Reeves said.
Then it was Klway throwing 12 yards
to Steve Watson and another first
down. Denver was in Cleveland terri
tory at the 40.
Elway's next pass to Vance Johnson
fell incomplete and then Elway was
sacked for only the second time in the
game, by nose tackle Dave Puzzuoli for
an eight-yard loss to the 48. The crowd
was ready to pack for Pasadena.
It was third-and-18, the clock was
down to 1:47, and Denver called an
other timeout. Elway and Reeves talked
on the sidelines about what could be
done to save the drive — and the
season.
"Dan said, Just try to get half of it,' "
Elway said.
"We were kind of picking them apart
underneath all day, so I was going to
take a shot downfield."
As 79,915 spectators began a deafen
ing roar, Elway dropped back to pass
and rifled a shot downfield to Mark
Jackson, who grabbed it at the
Cleveland 28. First down.
"Their safeties were playing real
deep, and Mark did a great job of fin

ding the hole for me," Elway said. "I
just put the ball there, plus I had plenty
of time to throw it."
"I guess we were playing more
coverage," Cleveland's All-Pro
linebacker Chip Banks said. "We didn't
try to blitz him."
Elway had the Broncos on the
Browns' 28 with 1:19 showing on the
clock.
He faded to pass again and hit Wat
son in the right side of the end zone,
but the receiver was unable to stay in
bounds.
Nine seconds ticked off the clock.
Elway again went back to pass. Com
plete, to Sewell. Fifty-seven seconds
left.
Second down and 10, Elway, back to
pass again, was flushed from the
pocket. He took off for the right side
and looked like he might cover the
final 14 yards himself. But linebacker
Clay Matthews appeared and knocked
him out of bounds at the five. Only
three seconds elapsed.
