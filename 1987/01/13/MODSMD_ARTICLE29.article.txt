# Card cyclists ready for new racing season
## 
### VIT HENISZ 
The official 1987 Stanford cycling season will not start un
til the gun goes off at the Fresno Time Trial on Feb. 21, but
the 25 riders have already been working out for months.
Practices start in front of the Post Office weekdays at 3:30
p.m. and weekends at 9 a.m. Twenty to 30 riders embark on
rides ranging from short, flat 15-mile jaunts to long coast
rides that can last for up to five hours on Sundays. Many
Stanford students see the team leaving campus in its red
striped jerseys and skin-tight shorts, but few realize what the
practices entail.
A typical training week in January might include a 50-mile
ride to Half Moon Bay on Sunday, an easy 25-mile Hat ride
on Monday, then the all-out sprint workout affectionately
known by team members as "Tuesday Death. Wednesday
brings a 45-mile ride over Skyline Blvd. and back again.
Thursday and Friday are moderate, flat workouts followed
by a mock race on Saturday.
After each week the miles escalate, and the courses
become more and more difficult.
Since its creation, the team has enjoyed considerable suc
cess in the Western Cycling Conference. In 1984, the team
was runnerup in the conference. The next year brought
Stanford cycling a league championship, followed by an
other second place in 1986.
The team's major rivals are Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and
UC-Santa Barbara. Stanford Coach Tim Nicholson looks for a
rejuvinated California team also to offer stiff resistance to
Stanford's quest for another championship.
Two recent Stanford cycling alumnae have continued this
winning tradition in the world of professional cycling. Kath
erine Tobin was recently crowned National Road Champion

year Stanford finished second in the Western Conference Cycling Championships and was state
champion the previous season.

This year three of five women and
15 of 20 men are returning from the
league runner-up squad.
The team will be hurt by the loss of
former Olympic swimmer John Moffet.
Moffet had only picked up bicycle
racing in July, but by October he
finished third in an intrasquad race.
Moffet graduated in December and
joined the prospective 1988 cycling
Olympians in training camp in
Colorado.
Seventeen races stand between the
team and the league championship.
The races are of three varieties. The
time trial is essentially a race against
the clock and one's own pain thresh
old. The riders begin the race at 30-
second intervals and are not allowed to

ride in close formation. No rider may
block wind for another at any time
during the race. This ensures that each
rider has ridden to his individual maxi
mum capability.
Spectators to the sport are probably
most familiar with the fast-paced
criterium format. All the cyclists start
simultaneously and circle a short, often
under one mile, course at least 30
times. Often sprints occur for prizes in
the middle of the race.
Finally, the true nature of the sport is
embodied in the road race. As in
criteriums, all riders start at once, but
instead of circling a closed course they
wander over hill and valley for up to
100 miles before sprinting across the
finish line. This type of race includes
all aspects off the sport: climbing tech
niques, rapid descent, power on flats,
and sprinting.
Anyone interested in joining this
year's team should come to the Post
Office at practice time. The team is es
pecially lacking women this year.
