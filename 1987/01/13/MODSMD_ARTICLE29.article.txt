# Card cyclists ready for new racing season

The official 1987 Stanford cycling season will not start un
til the gun goes off at the Fresno Time Trial on Feb. 21, but
the 25 riders have already been working out for months.
Practices start in front of the Post Office weekdays at 3:30
p.m. and weekends at 9 a.m. Twenty to 30 riders embark on
rides ranging from short, flat 15-mile jaunts to long coast
rides that can last for up to five hours on Sundays. Many
Stanford students see the team leaving campus in its red
striped jerseys and skin-tight shorts, but few realize what the
practices entail.
A typical training week in January might include a 50-mile
ride to Half Moon Bay on Sunday, an easy 25-mile Hat ride
on Monday, then the all-out sprint workout affectionately
known by team members as "Tuesday Death. Wednesday
brings a 45-mile ride over Skyline Blvd. and back again.
Thursday and Friday are moderate, flat workouts followed
by a mock race on Saturday.
After each week the miles escalate, and the courses
become more and more difficult.
Since its creation, the team has enjoyed considerable suc
cess in the Western Cycling Conference. In 1984, the team
was runnerup in the conference. The next year brought
Stanford cycling a league championship, followed by an
other second place in 1986.
The team's major rivals are Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and
UC-Santa Barbara. Stanford Coach Tim Nicholson looks for a
rejuvinated California team also to offer stiff resistance to
Stanford's quest for another championship.
Two recent Stanford cycling alumnae have continued this
winning tradition in the world of professional cycling. Kath
erine Tobin was recently crowned National Road Champion

The Stanford cycling team gets underway next month after a long period of preparation. Last
year Stanford finished second in the Western Conference Cycling Championships and was state
champion the previous season.
