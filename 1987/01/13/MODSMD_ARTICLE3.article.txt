# Rosse will adhere to Kennedy agenda

### JULIE WIDMAN Senior staff writer 
Although James Rosse expects to confront
several issues during his term as acting presi
dent of the University, he does not plan to make
any changes in the Stanford administration,
Rosse said yesterday in an interview with KZSU
and The Daily.
"I'm mainly concerned with putting forth the
agenda Don (University President Donald Ken
nedy) has," Rosse said. Rosse, who normally acts
as vice president and provost, is filling in for
Kennedy this quarter while the president is on
sabbatical.
Rosse noted budget problems, the develop
ment of educational policy, and the impact of
federal legislation on the taxability of student
scholarships and gifts to the university as issues
he will deal with in the coming months.
One of his biggest tasks in the next three
months, according to Rosse, will be launching
the Centennial campaign.
"We see the Centennial as a method of bring
ing to fruition many of the goals we have for the
university," he said.
Through the campaign, Rosse said he hopes to
improve the opportunity for undergraduates to
carry out research projects. That opportunity is
"not what it should be for a university of this
kind," Rosse said.
He also cited as goals additional housing for
undergraduates and the renovation of the Near
West campus area.
Concerning plans to build the Ronald Reagan
Library on campus, Rosse said the university is
unlikely to change its point of view.
The "arena of attention has shifted to the
county," Rosse said, adding that and many of the
concerns now being voiced about the library are
of an environmental rather than academic na
ture.
Regarding Stanford's investments in South
Africa, Rosse stressed the Board of Trustees' re
sponsibility to future students and faculty in con
trolling Stanford assets.

"(The Trustees) do in fact listen to students
and have behaved responsively," he said. He
added that the trustees' response has not been as
great as many students think it should be, which
he attributed the the large number of other mat
ters that take up the board's time.
Rosse called Stanford's Vienna program a
"wonderful, warm environment" and said the
Overseas Studies Program Committee could
have recruited a broader spectrum of opinion
while deliberating its future. But Rosse con
cluded that the committee "probably came to
the right decision" in choosing to close it.
"This program probably had lower productiv
ity academically than other (overseas) opportu
nities,'' he said. "They'had to ask if they were get
ting a good return on their investment."
Rosse said he would like to see a program
focusing on the "sources of Western culture or
U.S. culture," rather than a program labeled
either Western or world culture.
Recalling his deep ambivalence about the
reinstatement of an Area 1 Western culture re
quirement several years ago, Rosse, who was
then chairman of the Committee for Undergrad
uate Studies, said he now supports the program,
citing the favorable response of students and the
"real value in a common (academic) experi
ence" that the program provides.
But he agreed that the program needs to be
re-evaluated and perhaps revitalized.
"I'm very sensitive to the needs of non-
Western groups to find a place in the program,"
he said.
Rosse applauded Stanford women's diving
team captain Simone LeVant for bringing suit
contesting the legality of the NCAA's drug testing
requirement. Although he asserted that the con
troversy is a matter of individual concern, he
said, "I hope (the University) can find ways to
support her."
Agreeing with Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
Rosse said, "The university and the NCAA haven't
