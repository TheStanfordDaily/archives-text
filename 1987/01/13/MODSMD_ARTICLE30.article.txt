EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) —
There are a lot of reasons the New
York Giants are heading to Pasadena,
for Super Bowl XXI against the Denver
Broncos, but maybe none is as impor
tant in Coach Bill Parcells' mind as
what happened at the end of last
season.
The date was Jan. 5, 1986. The place
Chicago. The opponent the Bears. And
the score in the NFC semifinal was 21-
0, and it wasn't in New York's favor.
"Some of you guys wondered in
Chicago last year why I was so mad
after the game," he said vesterdav, the
day after the Giants' NFC title victory
over the Washington Redskins.
"It was real simple. I just never knew
if I was ever going to get another
chance to compete for this. Fortun
ately, I didn't have to wait for this more
than one year. That's what it's about
Parcells said he had a clear message
for his players on that aftern<x>n
I told them basically that when you
get to that stage of the season that you
are on such a fine line that you cannot
afford to make any mistakes," he said.
"You cannot afford to let up for one
play. Every play is important, special
teams, everything. If you give in to
fatigue or give in to the things that af
fect in the course of athletic competi
tion and slow you down, you are going
to low the came "
So far in the two playoff games, the

Giants have outscored San Francisco
and Washington 66-3. They have
posted a 16-2 record this season and
have won 11 consecutive games, in
cluding one against the team that
stands between them and their first
NFL championship in 30 years.
The Giants defeated Denver 19-16
on Nov. 23 at Giants Stadium.
"The thing I remember about that
game is George Martin's play,'' Parcells
said. "It was one of the great plays I've
ever seen in football."
Martin, a defensive end, made a one
hand interception of a John Elway pass
and returned it 78 yards for a touch
down just before halftime. It gave the
Giants a 10-6 lead in a game they could
have been losing 13-3 at the half.
"Elway is an improviser," said Par
cells. "That's good for Denver and bad
for the Giants. They have quick
receivers, and on defense they have
very smart veteran players. They are
well orchestrated."
Parcells and Denver Coach Dan
Reeves are g<xxi friends.
Reeves telephoned Parcells after the
Giants victory, but the coach could not
get to the phone. The two coaches and
their staffs shared information this past
summer about some common oppo
nents, and Parcells is hopeful they can
get together again this year
