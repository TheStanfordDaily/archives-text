# Six Stanford researchers win presidential award
## 
### 
Six researchers at Stanford are among 200 scientists and
engineers who have received Presidential Young Inves
tigator Awards, the National Science Foundation an
nounced.
To date, Stanford has 33 recipients, a total exceeded by
only the University of California-Berkeley. This year's Stan
ford winners are:
• John Cioffi, assistant professor of electrical engineering;
• Aharon Kapitulnik, assistant professor of applied physics;
• Steven Karel, graduate student in chemical engineering;
• Robert Sapolsky, assistant professor of biological sciences;
• Juan Simo, assistant professor of mechanical engineering;
and
• David Ungar, assistant professor of electrical engineering.
Each of the winners can receive up to $100,000 a year for
five years in federal grants and private matching funds.
Universities nominate outstanding faculty members near
the beginning of their careers and, in a few cases such as
Karel's, doctoral candidates.
The awards are meant to encourage researchers to stay at
universities rather than pursue non-academic careers, ac
cording to the NSF. This is particularly important in engi
neering and computer science, where there is a growing
shortage of faculty members.
Thirty-five California scientists won awards this year, com
ing in first over Massachusetts, where 27 researchers
received awards. In California, Berkeley won 12 awards, and
UCLA equaled Stanford with six.
John Cioffi is a Stanford alumnus who received his doc
torate in electrical engineering in 1984. Before joining the
faculty in 1986, he worked in the Signal Processing and

Coding Theory groups at IBM Research in San Jose, design
ing modems and storage disks.
Cioffi is working on digitizing the telephone lines that go
into people's houses.
Aharon Kapitulnik was in Israel when the annoncement
of the award was made. He holds a doctroate from Tel Aviv
University in applied physics.
Kapitulnik specializes in the exploration and threory of
disordered systems and the effects of superconductivity in
those systems.
Steven Karel expects to receive his doctorate in chemical
engineering during this winter quarter. Then he will join
die Chemical Engineering Department at Princeton Un
viversity, where he will continue to work on biochemical
engineering in bacteria.
Robert Sapolsky will be coming to the Biological Sciences
Department at Stanford this month. Since receiving his doc
torate from Rockefeller University, he has been doing post
doctoral work at the Salk Institue in La Jolla.
Sapolosky studies stress. He has found that in rats, stress
leads to brain damage and memory loss, and hopes to use
rats to test drugs tljat may decrease these side effects in
people.
Juan Simo received his doctorate from Berkeley in 1982
and joined the mechanical engineering faculty here in 1985.
He works on computational solid mechanics, a field that
applies mathematics, computing and mechanics to help
people determine how materials will respond to stress.
David Ungar received his doctorate from Berkeley in
1986 and then came to the Stanford Electrical Engineering
Department.
