### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
The Council of Presidents plans to discuss new projects,
including a Provocative Film Series and a community ser
vice fund, at tonight's ASSU Senate meeting.
The COP will also discuss new student-run services, ef
forts to locate a permanent home for the campus pub and a
project intended to bring students and campus workers to
gether "in a celebration of their relationship," according to
a COP newsletter released today.
"This is the do-or-die quarter," said COP member Rudy
Fuentes. The COP and the senate devoted most of their time
last fall to planning. Now. the committee positions have
been filled and student organizations should be running ef
ficiently, Fuentes said.
Currently, the COP is optimistic about its prospects.
' We're growing here at the ASSU, and we want that to be
known," Fuentes said, citing the increased participation of
Stanford undergraduate and graduate students in the ASSU.
According to the newsletter, the COP was elected "to lake
some action. We've got some progress to report. There's a
long way to go, but things are definitely moving.
While COP members sometimes collaborate, they pursue
the bulk of projects individually.
"The issues in the ASSU are so broad that the COP is more

effective when we utilize our individual talents," Fuentes
said.
Fuentes is working on the planned Provocative Film Se
ries and a group of Multicultural Worker Appreciation Days.
The film series will be something between the Tuesday
Films and the Sunday Flicks, according to Fuentes. But
unlike its counterparts, it will include panel discussions, he
said.
Proposed films are "Salvador,'' "The Man" and
"Dreamchild."
The Multicultural Worker Appreciation Days will feature
movies and student performers to entertain the University
working community â€” "from administrators to staff per
sons to blue collar workers," Fuentes said. These events are
an attempt to improve student-worker relations, he added
Ballet Folklorico and the Band may be among the student
performers.
In cooperation with Program Board Director Robin Miller
and ASSU Senator Felix Cuevas, Fuentes is also sponsoring a
community service fund. The Program Board would use the
new $40,000 fund in 198 7 -1988 to support community ser
vice projects that currently are not funded by the program
board because they serve the broader community and not
just the Stanford student body
This new fund w ill be on-the ballot during the general fee
elections in Mav.
