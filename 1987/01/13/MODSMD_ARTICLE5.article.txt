# Court denies Davies tenure information
## Kahn's right to privacy upheld 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The California constitution gives History Prof.
Harold Kahn a right to privacy that outweighs the
right of a former visiting professor to obtain
evidence for a lawsuit, a California appeals court
ruled Friday.
In a $31 million lawsuit against the University,
former Visiting Prof. Norman Davies alleged that
Kahn and 30 unnamed others made "false and
derogatory statements" about him during a Jan.
15, 1986, meeting of the History Department fac
ulty. At. that meeting, the history faculty voted 12-
11 to deny Davies a permanent appointment as a
professor.
Davies, an internationally renowned specialist
on Eastern European history, was a visiting pro
fessor between Sept. 1, 1985, and Aug. 31, 1986.
He also served as director of Stanford's summer
program in Krakow, Poland, and is a tenured pro
fessor of history at the University of London.
After filing the suit on April 30, 1986, Davies
sought a deposition from Kahn. Kahn responded
by filing for a protective order to prevent the
taking of his deposition.
The Sixth District Appellate Court ruled that
private testimony is critical in the professorial ap
pointment process and therefore to "the fostering
of academic excellence."
"Tenure review is one form of the pursuit of
academic excellence.... Excellence cannot be
achieved unless faculty members, without fear of
disclosure, are able to express candid appraisals
of the qualifications of tenure candidates. If
suspect that their views may be aired
in litigation, they unquestionably will be less than
candid in their critiques In such an atmos

phere it is likely that candidates would seldom be
denied tenure; and over a period of time the
quality of the faculty would inevitably
deteriorate."
Kahn said yesterday that he was "gratified" by
the decision. "I hope this means we can put this
behind us and get on with the job of doing his
tory. I feel more comfortable in the library than
the courts."
Former Republican congressman Paul "Pete"
McCloskey, who represented Davies, was out of
town, according to his office.
On Jan. 8, 1986, a University search committee
unanimously recommended that Davies receive a
permanent appointment to the McDonnell Chair
of East European History, an endowed chair that
had been vacant for a number of years.
But one week later, the History Department
faculty voted to deny him the chair, and"From
the bits of information he gathered, Davies appar
ently came to the conclusion that Kahn had per
suaded the History Department to deny the ap
pointment and on non-academic grounds," ac
cording to court documents.
Davies met with Provost James Rosse, who is
now serving as acting president of the University,
in April to ask for an explanation of the decision,
which he received after he filed his suit. The
seven-page explanation "described the topics
presented by the search committee ... (and) also
devoted three pages to a description of the events
of the Jan. 15 meeting," according to the court
documents.
On April 30, Davies filed a suit that accused
Kahn and 30 unnamed persons of making "false
and derogatory statements ... alleging
that [Davies'] scholarship was defec
tive."
In addition, the suit said, Kahn and
others "conspired and acted to inter-

fere with and terminate [Davies'] ad
vantageous business relationship with
Stanford."
A lower court ruled in August that
Davies' case failed to prove either
charge, but said Davies could rewrite

and then refile his suit. The court also
granted Davies permission to take a
deposition from Kahn if his revised
suit proved that he had been wronged.
But the appellate court found that
"in California the fostering of academic
excellence finds support in the consti
tutional right to privacy."
Davies' "interest is only in monetary
damages; it must be remembered that
he has no right to be employed by
Stanford University. Prof Kahn, on the
other hand, has a constitutional right to
privacy which, though not absolute,
bends, if at all, only to a compelling
public need," says the court's decision.

suit proved that he had been wronged.
But the appellate court found that
"in California the fostering of academic
excellence finds support in the consti
tutional right to privacy."
Davies' "interest is only in monetary
damages; it must be remembered that
he has no right to be employed by
Stanford University. Prof Kahn, on the
other hand, has a constitutional right to
privacy which, though not absolute,
bends, if at all, only to a compelling
public need," says the court's decision.

Former visiting professor
The California constitution gives History Prof.
Harold Kahn a right to privacy that outweighs the
right of a former visiting professor to obtain
evidence for a lawsuit, a California appeals court
ruled Friday.
In a $31 million lawsuit against the University,
former Visiting Prof. Norman Davies alleged that
Kahn and 30 unnamed others made "false and
derogatory statements" about him during a Jan.
15, 1986, meeting of the History Department fac
ulty. At. that meeting, the history faculty voted 12-
11 to deny Davies a permanent appointment as a
professor.
Davies, an internationally renowned specialist
on Eastern European history, was a visiting pro
fessor between Sept. 1, 1985, and Aug. 31, 1986.
He also served as director of Stanford's summer
program in Krakow, Poland, and is a tenured pro
fessor of history at the University of London.
After filing the suit on April 30, 1986, Davies
sought a deposition from Kahn. Kahn responded
by filing for a protective order to prevent the
taking of his deposition.
The Sixth District Appellate Court ruled that
private testimony is critical in the professorial ap
pointment process and therefore to "the fostering
of academic excellence."
"Tenure review is one form of the pursuit of
academic excellence.... Excellence cannot be
achieved unless faculty members, without fear of
disclosure, are able to express candid appraisals
of the qualifications of tenure candidates. If
suspect that their views may be aired
in litigation, they unquestionably will be less than
candid in their critiques In such an atmos

phere it is likely that candidates would seldom be
denied tenure; and over a period of time the
quality of the faculty would inevitably
deteriorate."
Kahn said yesterday that he was "gratified" by
the decision. "I hope this means we can put this
behind us and get on with the job of doing his
tory. I feel more comfortable in the library than
the courts."
Former Republican congressman Paul "Pete"
McCloskey, who represented Davies, was out of
town, according to his office.
On Jan. 8, 1986, a University search committee
unanimously recommended that Davies receive a
permanent appointment to the McDonnell Chair
of East European History, an endowed chair that
had been vacant for a number of years.
But one week later, the History Department
faculty voted to deny him the chair, and"From
the bits of information he gathered, Davies appar
ently came to the conclusion that Kahn had per
suaded the History Department to deny the ap
pointment and on non-academic grounds," ac
cording to court documents.
Davies met with Provost James Rosse, who is
now serving as acting president of the University,
in April to ask for an explanation of the decision,
which he received after he filed his suit. The
seven-page explanation "described the topics
presented by the search committee ... (and) also
devoted three pages to a description of the events
of the Jan. 15 meeting," according to the court
documents.
On April 30, Davies filed a suit that accused
Kahn and 30 unnamed persons of making "false
and derogatory statements ... alleging
that [Davies'] scholarship was defec
tive."
In addition, the suit said, Kahn and
others "conspired and acted to inter-

fere with and terminate [Davies'] ad
vantageous business relationship with
Stanford."
A lower court ruled in August that
Davies' case failed to prove either
charge, but said Davies could rewrite

and then refile his suit. The court also
granted Davies permission to take a
deposition from Kahn if his revised
suit proved that he had been wronged.
But the appellate court found that
"in California the fostering of academic
excellence finds support in the consti
tutional right to privacy."
Davies' "interest is only in monetary
damages; it must be remembered that
he has no right to be employed by
Stanford University. Prof Kahn, on the
other hand, has a constitutional right to
privacy which, though not absolute,
bends, if at all, only to a compelling
public need," says the court's decision.
