# University to absorb Pac Bell wiring charges

Don't be surprised by an inside wire repair bill
It's your choice!
In the wake of the breakup of AT&T, Stanford
students have received notices like this with their
Pacific Bell bills, informing them they must
choose an inside wiring plan for their phone. In
actuality, the University is not holding students re
sponsible for the upkeep of telephone wiring in
their residences, and students can save monthly
maintenance charges.
Under a new Federal Communications Com
mission ruling, the telephone wiring industry has
been deregulated. As of Jan. 1, Pac Bell customers
have had the option of either fixing wiring prob
lems themselves, hiring someone else to fix the
wiring for them, paying Pac Bell a monthly 50-
cent charge to get free wiring repair or paying Pac
Bell a $65 per-visit charge to fix the wiring.
Prior to the ruling, the cost of such repairs was
built into the rate structure, and repairs were per
formed free of charge.
"Now (telephone) wiring in your house is like
your electrical wiring," said Pac Bell spokesman
Lou Saviano, noting that now Pac Bell is as re

sponsible for the wiring in one's home as the
electric company.
According to Keith Guy, University director of
Housing Management, it doesn't make sense for
students to pay a monthly fee to Pac Bell since
Stanford "takes the role of landlord.''
Although Pac Bell's relationship is with the stu
dent who receives telephone seryice, Guy said
the University will repair defective wiring in the
student residences. Guy noted, however, that
"anything that the students would cause to hap
pen to their jacks would be their responsibility."
In this case, students might want to pay the
monthly 50-cent charge.
Necessary repairs would probably be per
formed by the University's maintenance staff and
would not be contracted through Pac Bell, Guy
said.
In 1985, Pac Bell received an average of 2,000
reports a day dealing with inside wiring trouble
from its 11 million California customers, accord
ing to Saviano. The most common problems that
occur with the wiring are dampness or distur
bances such as knocking the phone jack with
furniture or, in the extreme, having mice in the
wall tampering with the wiring, Saviano said.
