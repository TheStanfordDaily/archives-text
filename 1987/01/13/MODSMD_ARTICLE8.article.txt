Reagan sets stage for new talks
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, setting the stage for a new round of
superpower arms control talks, promoted the chief U.S. negotiator today
and charged the Soviet Union had "backtracked" from his understandings
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to cut nuclear stockpiles.
Appearing to match a move by the Kremlin, the president announced
that Max Kampelman, who received final instructions in the Oval Office
before flying to Geneva for the resumption of talks on Thursday, will serve
both as head of the U.S. delegation and as State Department counselor.
The Soviets had just named Yuli Vorontsov, the first deputy foreign mini
ster, to replace veteran negotiator Viktor Karpov while also retaining his
policy post. Kampelman, whose appointment requires Senate confirma
tion, would hold the counselor's job in Washington while also conducting
negotiations in Geneva about one-third of the year.
Soviet Ambassador Yuli Dubinin called on Assistant Secretary of State
Rozanne Ridgway last Thursday night to inform her of Vorontsov's assign
ment and to request Kampelman be replaced by someone of higher rank, a
U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, told The Associated Press.
Reagan, at work in the Oval Office for the first time since prostate sur
gery Jan. 5, met for 20 minutes with Kampelman and his principal deputies,
Maynard Glitman and Ronald Lehman, before they flew to Geneva.
Deng shakes up the party
PEKING — The Chinese Communist Party yesterday summarily fired
Fang Lizhi, the physicist and university vice president who had become the
hero of the recent wave of student demonstrations for democracy, saying
that he had "defamed the party's leadership."
In addition, Fang's boss, Guan Weiyuan, was dismissed as president of
the Chinese University of Science and Technology, in Hefei. The part)'
accused him of neglecting "ideological and political work."
The firings were the first official actions to be announced by the regime
in what is expected to be an extensive purge in the wake of the student un
rest. Chinese sources reported last week that Fang would be expelled from
the party, but it was not clear until yesterday that he would lose his job at
the university as well.
Yesterday the capital was awash in speculation that the shakeups being
ordered by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping would reach to the very highest
levels of the party leadership.
The Peking correspondents of two Communist Party newspapers in
Europe reported rumors that Deng had fired his top-ranking aide, party
General Secretary Hu Yaobang. A foreign Communist Party member
working for a Chinese agency also said he heard that Hu had been ousted,
and that an official announcement was to be made today.
Tanjug, the Yugoslav Communist Party newspaper, and l'Unita, the organ
of the Italian Communist Party, said that Hu would be replaced as party
chief by Premier Zhao Ziyang. In turn, they said, Li Ruihuan, the young,
reform-minded mayor of the city c;f Tianjin, will become premier.
Hu, 71, who has served as party general secretary since 1980, was said to
have been forced out in the face of criticism by conservatives in the party.
Deng was said to have sacrificed his top aide in an effort to salvage the gen
eral outlines of his economic reform program and open-door policies.
Waite vies for hostage release
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Anglican Church emissary Terry Waite said upon
returning to Moslem West Beirut yesterday he was optimistic he could help
win the release of Americans and other foreigners held hostage in
Lebanon.
"Signs have been given to me that now is a reasonable time to come
back, and one is able to pursue the contacts and hopefully to be able to try
and work a resolution to the problems we face," Waite told reporters.
Waite, personal envoy of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie,
criticized secret U.S. arms sales to Iran, which the Reagan administration
says were made at least partly in an effort to help win release of Americans
here. Waite said trading arms for lives cheapens human life.
Waite has been credited with helping to win freedom for three
Americans held by Islamic Jihad — the Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian
minister, freed Sept. 14, 1985; the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, a Roman Catholic
priest, freed last July 26; and David Jacobsen, former director of the Ameri
can University Hospital, freed Nov. 2.
Weinberger: Increase spending
WASHINGTON — Higher defense budgets are necessary to meet the
continuing Soviet military buildup and because there is "no prudent way to
scale back American interests around the world," Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told Congress yesterday.
Weinberger's familiar message came during his first appearance on
Capitol Hill before the new 100 th Congress in support of President
Reagan's request for a 7.7 percent increase in military spending at a time
when the administration has proposed to cut many domestic programs.
The requested $312 billion defense budget would amount to an actual 3
percent increase after inflation, the smallest hike sought thus far by Reagan
as part of his program to "rearm America."
Much of the hearing dealt with U.S. military strategy rather than specific
items in the defense budget. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the new committee
chairman, has called a series of hearings to try to outline overall U.S.
defense strategy rather than debate specific weapons.
The administration wants $660 million as a down payment for new
aircraft carriers, which would cost $6.9 billion. It also requested $5.78 bil
lion next year for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally
known, compared with the current SDI budget of $3.5 billion. A separate
request would add $500 million this year to the SDI budget.
Several Republican senators said the administration should consider
deploying elements of a Star Wars shield as soon as possible even if no
complete SDI system is available.
Priest suspended by Vatican
WASHINGTON — The Rev. Charles Curran, the priest-theologian under
Vatican fire for his views on sexual ethics, said yesterday that he had been
suspended from teaching at Catholic University of America but planned to
show up for the start of spring term anyway.
Curran, arguing that his suspension was not proper, said he planned to
be present Thursday to teach a class — at least to a portion of the students
who have signed up for it.
He said he would continue to fight to keep his position as a professor of
moral theology at the school, and he raised the possibility that he might
take the matter to civil court.
Yesterday, the theologian and school officials distributed a letter to him
in which the school's chancellor, Archbishop James Hickey of Washington,
said Vatican condemnation of Curran s relatively liberal views made a
"serious and pressing" case against him — a case warranting suspension.
Curran labeled the suspension unwarranted, contrary to recommen
dations from school officials and indicative of "a lack of appreciation for
the needs and rights of students.
Hickey's letter, dated Friday, informed Curran that he was being
suspended — with pay — pending final resolution of his case.
The theologian, who was on sabbatical all last year as the controversy
came to a head, has been under fire from top church officials for years be
cause of his views on birth control, divorce, homosexuality and other
sexual issues.
After a seven-year investigation and final efforts at negotiations, includ
ing a trip by Curran to Rome last spring, the Vatican told him in August that
his authorization to teach as a Catholic theologian was being revoked.
Hickey then set in motion the procedures for actually removing that
"canonical mission." But those procedures, including hearings b\ a faculty
group and a likely appeal to the school's board of trustees, may well not be
completed for months.

Waite vies for hostage release
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Anglican Church emissary Terry Waite said upon
returning to Moslem West Beirut yesterday he was optimistic he could help
win the release of Americans and other foreigners held hostage in
Lebanon.
"Signs have been given to me that now is a reasonable time to come
back, and one is able to pursue the contacts and hopefully to be able to try
and work a resolution to the problems we face," Waite told reporters.
Waite, personal envoy of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie,
criticized secret U.S. arms sales to Iran, which the Reagan administration
says were made at least partly in an effort to help win release of Americans
here. Waite said trading arms for lives cheapens human life.
Waite has been credited with helping to win freedom for three
Americans held by Islamic Jihad — the Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian
minister, freed Sept. 14, 1985; the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, a Roman Catholic
priest, freed last July 26; and David Jacobsen, former director of the Ameri
can University Hospital, freed Nov. 2.
Weinberger: Increase spending
WASHINGTON — Higher defense budgets are necessary to meet the
continuing Soviet military buildup and because there is "no prudent way to
scale back American interests around the world," Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told Congress yesterday.
Weinberger's familiar message came during his first appearance on
Capitol Hill before the new 100 th Congress in support of President
Reagan's request for a 7.7 percent increase in military spending at a time
when the administration has proposed to cut many domestic programs.
The requested $312 billion defense budget would amount to an actual 3
percent increase after inflation, the smallest hike sought thus far by Reagan
as part of his program to "rearm America."
Much of the hearing dealt with U.S. military strategy rather than specific
items in the defense budget. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the new committee
chairman, has called a series of hearings to try to outline overall U.S.
defense strategy rather than debate specific weapons.
The administration wants $660 million as a down payment for new
aircraft carriers, which would cost $6.9 billion. It also requested $5.78 bil
lion next year for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally
known, compared with the current SDI budget of $3.5 billion. A separate
request would add $500 million this year to the SDI budget.
Several Republican senators said the administration should consider
deploying elements of a Star Wars shield as soon as possible even if no
complete SDI system is available.
Priest suspended by Vatican
WASHINGTON — The Rev. Charles Curran, the priest-theologian under
Vatican fire for his views on sexual ethics, said yesterday that he had been
suspended from teaching at Catholic University of America but planned to
show up for the start of spring term anyway.
Curran, arguing that his suspension was not proper, said he planned to
be present Thursday to teach a class — at least to a portion of the students
who have signed up for it.
He said he would continue to fight to keep his position as a professor of
moral theology at the school, and he raised the possibility that he might
take the matter to civil court.
Yesterday, the theologian and school officials distributed a letter to him
in which the school's chancellor, Archbishop James Hickey of Washington,
said Vatican condemnation of Curran s relatively liberal views made a
"serious and pressing" case against him — a case warranting suspension.
Curran labeled the suspension unwarranted, contrary to recommen
dations from school officials and indicative of "a lack of appreciation for
the needs and rights of students.
Hickey's letter, dated Friday, informed Curran that he was being
suspended — with pay — pending final resolution of his case.
The theologian, who was on sabbatical all last year as the controversy
came to a head, has been under fire from top church officials for years be
cause of his views on birth control, divorce, homosexuality and other
sexual issues.
After a seven-year investigation and final efforts at negotiations, includ
ing a trip by Curran to Rome last spring, the Vatican told him in August that
his authorization to teach as a Catholic theologian was being revoked.
Hickey then set in motion the procedures for actually removing that
"canonical mission." But those procedures, including hearings b\ a faculty
group and a likely appeal to the school's board of trustees, may well not be
completed for months.

Reagan sets stage for new talks
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, setting the stage for a new round of
superpower arms control talks, promoted the chief U.S. negotiator today
and charged the Soviet Union had "backtracked" from his understandings
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to cut nuclear stockpiles.
Appearing to match a move by the Kremlin, the president announced
that Max Kampelman, who received final instructions in the Oval Office
before flying to Geneva for the resumption of talks on Thursday, will serve
both as head of the U.S. delegation and as State Department counselor.
The Soviets had just named Yuli Vorontsov, the first deputy foreign mini
ster, to replace veteran negotiator Viktor Karpov while also retaining his
policy post. Kampelman, whose appointment requires Senate confirma
tion, would hold the counselor's job in Washington while also conducting
negotiations in Geneva about one-third of the year.
Soviet Ambassador Yuli Dubinin called on Assistant Secretary of State
Rozanne Ridgway last Thursday night to inform her of Vorontsov's assign
ment and to request Kampelman be replaced by someone of higher rank, a
U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, told The Associated Press.
Reagan, at work in the Oval Office for the first time since prostate sur
gery Jan. 5, met for 20 minutes with Kampelman and his principal deputies,
Maynard Glitman and Ronald Lehman, before they flew to Geneva.
Deng shakes up the party
PEKING — The Chinese Communist Party yesterday summarily fired
Fang Lizhi, the physicist and university vice president who had become the
hero of the recent wave of student demonstrations for democracy, saying
that he had "defamed the party's leadership."
In addition, Fang's boss, Guan Weiyuan, was dismissed as president of
the Chinese University of Science and Technology, in Hefei. The part)'
accused him of neglecting "ideological and political work."
The firings were the first official actions to be announced by the regime
in what is expected to be an extensive purge in the wake of the student un
rest. Chinese sources reported last week that Fang would be expelled from
the party, but it was not clear until yesterday that he would lose his job at
the university as well.
Yesterday the capital was awash in speculation that the shakeups being
ordered by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping would reach to the very highest
levels of the party leadership.
The Peking correspondents of two Communist Party newspapers in
Europe reported rumors that Deng had fired his top-ranking aide, party
General Secretary Hu Yaobang. A foreign Communist Party member
working for a Chinese agency also said he heard that Hu had been ousted,
and that an official announcement was to be made today.
Tanjug, the Yugoslav Communist Party newspaper, and l'Unita, the organ
of the Italian Communist Party, said that Hu would be replaced as party
chief by Premier Zhao Ziyang. In turn, they said, Li Ruihuan, the young,
reform-minded mayor of the city c;f Tianjin, will become premier.
Hu, 71, who has served as party general secretary since 1980, was said to
have been forced out in the face of criticism by conservatives in the party.
Deng was said to have sacrificed his top aide in an effort to salvage the gen

take the matter to civil court.
Yesterday, the theologian and school officials distributed a letter to him
in which the school's chancellor, Archbishop James Hickey of Washington,
said Vatican condemnation of Curran s relatively liberal views made a
"serious and pressing" case against him — a case warranting suspension.
Curran labeled the suspension unwarranted, contrary to recommen
dations from school officials and indicative of "a lack of appreciation for
the needs and rights of students.
Hickey's letter, dated Friday, informed Curran that he was being
suspended — with pay — pending final resolution of his case.
The theologian, who was on sabbatical all last year as the controversy
came to a head, has been under fire from top church officials for years be
cause of his views on birth control, divorce, homosexuality and other
sexual issues.
After a seven-year investigation and final efforts at negotiations, includ
ing a trip by Curran to Rome last spring, the Vatican told him in August that
his authorization to teach as a Catholic theologian was being revoked.
Hickey then set in motion the procedures for actually removing that
"canonical mission." But those procedures, including hearings b\ a faculty
group and a likely appeal to the school's board of trustees, may well not be
completed for months.
