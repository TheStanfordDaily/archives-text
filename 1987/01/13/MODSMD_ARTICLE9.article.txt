# UPDATE
## U.S. promises not to smear Israel 
### 
JERUSALEM — The Reagan administration has told
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that it does not
hold Israel responsible for the Iran arms affair and is
not seeking to shirk responsibility by blaming Israel
for leading it into the secret exchange of arms for
U.S. hostages.
A spokesman for Shamir said last night that U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Pickering conveyed this con
ciliatory oral message to the prime minister "in the
name of the White House," although not specifically
from President Reagan. An American Embassy official
confirmed that the message had been given at a
meeting between the two men Sunday.
Pickering told Shamir that "the United States has
no intention either to blame Israel or to throw any
responsibility onto Israel" and that America "was not
trying to hide behind Israel in what is its responsibil
ity," said Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman.
The American official added that the ambassador
had sought to "reassure the Israelis that the various
investigations in the United States were designed to
get the facts" about the Iran affair "and not an effort
to make Israel a scapegoat for decisions made by
Washington."

Confirmation of the message follows three days of
press disclosures here alleging that Israeli officials
had initiated the arms-for-hostages exchange, served
as conduits for the secret flow of weapons to Tehran
and pressed reluctant White House aides to continue
with the dealings even after it appeared they were
not succeeding.
It has also been alleged that the idea of tunneling
profits from the arms sales to the anti-Sandinista
rebels in Nicaragua was first proposed by a senior
aide to then Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
The allegations are attributed to a confidential
draft report of the Senate Select Committee on Intel
ligence, detailed portions of which have been dis
closed here by Washington-based Israeli correspon
dents.
Another factor leading up to yesterday's develop
ment was the release by the White House last week of
a memorandum, drawn up in January of last year by
then National Security Adviser John Poindexter,
which characterized the Iran affair as an "Israeli
plan'' designed to promote "moderate" elements in
Tehran.

Israeli officials have repeatedly denied they were
the instigators or promoters of either the Iran arms
scheme or the plan to funnel profits to the
Nicaraguan rebels. But the new disclosures and alle
gations have unleashed a flood of press reports and
criticism here. There even have been suggestions in
the Israeli press that Shamir should cancel a trip to
Washington planned for mid-February because of the
hostile reception he might receive.
Sunday's message was similar to a written one sent
by Reagan to Shamir nearly two months ago reaffirm
ing American support for Israel after Reagan and At
torney General Edwin Meese 111 had accused the Is
raelis publicly of diverting profits from the arms sales
to the Nicaraguan rebels.
This time, the message was oral and not conveyed
in the name of Reagan, but Israeli sources welcomed
it as an indication that the special relationship be
tween the two countries remains intact.
Throughout two months of public disclosures, Is
raeli officials have maintained public restraint, avoid
ing comment when possible and being careful not to
criticize the administration overtly.
