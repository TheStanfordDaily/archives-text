THE END
REPENT NOW! CONFESS YOUR SINS! January 23rd approaches
— ominously soon — and that's the DEADLINE to apply for
SPECIAL FEES ($4OOO-S 100,000) and for PROGRAM BOARD /
PUBLICATIONS BOARD funding ($lOOO-$4000) for 1987-88. After
4:00 p.m. on January 23rd, you might as well be dead.
To make up for your miserable little life, you must:
■ Submit your budget. Fifteen copies of it (And each one must be
written out longhand).
■ Program Board groups must meet with Victor "Hangman" Huang
before you apply or you and your application will ROT IN HELL.
■ Special fee groups get on the ballot by
a) applying on time
getting interviewed by the Senate Appropriations committee and
not getting chewed up, spat out, and crushed underheel.
or
b) gathering zillions of petition signatures and turning in a budget
by February 15 (This is called "Extended Life" and it's a living
HELL).
Last year Prog & Pub Board funding ran up to $184,000. Special Fees
reached nearly $500,000. Money like that can be spent on plenty of
drugs that can cause irreparable heart damage. We're talking kilos of
it. Before Death grabs you with his cold, clamy hands, contact the
embalmer closest to you:
■ Special Fees: Jeff Sloan 326-0221, 725-1463
Carey White 327-8648, 725-1465
■ Program Board: Victor Huang 725-1464
Brian Birney 725-1464
Robin Miller 328-3512
