OBITCHUARY
DECEASED: Lori Ann Abert, beloved fellow executive officer of the As
sociated Students Council of Presidents, Financial Manager, and Senate
Chair. Survived by her assistant, who know more than she did anyway.
Friends request contributions be made to themselves. Barring that, the
Fund for Neurotic Manager would be appropriate.
[ Editor's note: Okay, we finally got rid of the bitch. Now it's your turn.]
Apply to be the ASSU's 1987-88 Adminstrative Manager, in charge of
managing all service projects:
Program Board
Publications Board
Speakers Bureau
Legal Counseling
Course Guide
Elections Commission
Nominations Commission
In return, you get:
• Serious Management Experience. Man, we are not
kidding.
• Control of Resources.
• Money. •
Contact the corpse before January 26 .. . after that, the worms will have
her. By the way, significant compensation (SALARY, MAN. GET IT?
MONEY. LOTS OF IT. FOR A WHOLE YEAR.) is involved ... if you live
that long. You have to work here pretty much every day, though (KNEW
THERE HAD TO BE A DRAWBACK, EH?). Call Death at 325-0724.
