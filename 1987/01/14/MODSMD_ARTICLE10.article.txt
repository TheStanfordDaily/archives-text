# Frenchman abducted in Beirut
## 
### 
PARIS â€” Gunmen kidnapped a
French journalist in Beirut yesterday,
but a colleague slipped out of the
grasp of his abductors and escaped as
they opened fire. Both were covering
the latest attempt by Anglican Church
envoy Terry Waite to free hostages in
Lebanon.
Roger Auque, a 31-year-old free
lance reporter and photographer, was
seized by two gunmen as he stepped
out of his apartment building in West
Beirut, the capital's Moslem sector.
Moments before, on the street
nearby, Paul Marchand, a French
reporter for Radio Monte Carlo,
slipped out of the grasp of his abduc
tors and rushed away as they opened
fire.
"I shouted at Roger: 'Get out of

there! Get out!'" Marchand said later
on French television.
But Auque was unable to escape.
By late yesterday, none of the secret,
extremist organizations operating in
Lebanon had made any claim to re
sponsibility for the incident.
The kidnapping darkened the mood
of Waite's mission. When Waite, a lay
assistant to Robert Runcie, the Arch
bishop of Canterbury, was advised of
what had happened, he said: "I'm very,
very sorry to hear that."
The seizure of Auque was also seen
as a blow to the Middle East policy of
French Premier Jacques Chirac, who
has been trying to repair relations with
Iran as a way of freeing French
hostages. Most of the terrorist groups

holding Western hostages are believed
to be loyal to Iran.
There has been a good deal of skep
ticism in France about the wisdom of
Chirac's policy. Even Jean-Bernard
Raimond, the minister of foreign af
fairs, admitted a few days ago that he
was disappointed with the results.
When news of yesterday's kidnap
ping reached Paris, Chirac was imme
diately criticized by a party on the ex
treme right and a small, moderate left
ist party for dealing with blackmailers.
But most leading politicians withheld
comment.
Counting Auque, six Frenchmen are
missing in Lebanon. In all, 16 foreign
ers, including five Americans, are
believed to be in the hands of ex
tremist Shia Moslem organizations

Marchand, interviewed on French
television after the kidnapping, said
that eight gunmen in two cars, a Volvo
and a Mercedes-Ben, stopped in front
of Auque's apartment building while
Marchand was waiting outside with a
taxi. Two of the gunmen, one armed
with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, the
other with a pistol, grabbed Mar
chand's jacket and shouted at him in
English, "Follow us! Come with us!"
Marchand said that he struggled free
and that the youth with the Kalash
nikov shouted, "I'm going to kill you!"
Shots were fired as Marchand rushed
away. Auque came out of the building
at that moment and was grabbed by the
gunmen.
