# Scholar: Solidarity broadening its tactics
## 
### ERIC RICHARDSON 
The Polish opposition union,
Solidarity, is broadening its tactics to
prevent further "pollution" of Poland
by the Communist government —
"pollution' that is affecting Polish
politics and economy as well as its en
vironment, according to Polish scholar
Irena Grudzinska-Gross.
"What we need to do tomorrow and
today is to force the government to
stop the economic and ecological
catastrophy," said Gross, a professor of
comparative literature at Emory Uni
versity who is also serving as a Mellon
scholar at Harvard University.
"The only way to do that is to partici
pate in economic activity. Solidarity is
trying to introduce the free market into
the Polish economy," she told a crowd
of approximately 45 people at History
Corner yesterday.
Gross, who left her native Poland in
1970 but remains a frequent con
tributor to the underground press
there, noted that pollution levels and
the infant mortality rate in Poland are
now the highest in Europe. The life ex
pectancy of Poles is Europe's lowest,
and Gross said the country's health
structure has "collapsed."
In response to this "general atmos
phere of gloom" and the "non-logical"
activities of the Polish government, a
wider range of economic activity high

lighting future opposition activities is
likely, Gross said.
"Social energy is going to burst out
into the creation of islands of eco
nomic opportunity in Poland," she
said.
"That will somehow create perman
ent islands of freedom within Poland.
These will breed other opportunities."
Asked how Solidarity would
respond to governmental attempts to
suppress this new dissent as it did in
1956 and again in 1981, Gross replied,
"If the government tries to violently
oppress the opposition, it will find out
that the opposition is united against it."
Basing her talk largely on the
publication "Solidarity Weekly," Gross
noted that the Polish opposition has
expanded outside the limits set by
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the
Catholic Church when martial law was
imposed Dec. 13, 1981. Triggered by
the recent amnesty granted to all but
13 of Poland's political prisoners,
younger leaders and former under
ground figures are rising to leading
positions in the Polish opposition, ac
cording to Gross.
"Solidarity must now act in a double
way," she said, referring to the need to
follow two different sets of leaders —
the former underground dissidents
who have surfaced in Solidarity's lead
ership, as well as Lech Walesa.
