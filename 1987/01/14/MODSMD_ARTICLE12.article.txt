The University may be approaching a situation where
one's choice of major is more important than one's draw
number in the quest for good housing.
While it is doubtful that students would ever choose a
major in order to get priority for housing, Residential
Education's push for theme houses could lead to four
residences being set aside for those interested in
Russian-East European Studies, the arts, public service
and international relations.
Res Ed's goal of promoting intellectual discourse and
interaction in the dorms is an admirable one but is not
necessarily furthered by giving residences academic
themes. The University contradicts itself by searching for
diversity in its students, then trying to put those with like
interests in the same house.
A group of, say, math majors would benefit far more
by living with those interested in English or history than
with 50 of their peers. College affords one an opportu
nity to learn from a diverse group of others rather than
simply live with like-minded students.
Clubs exist for those interested in exchanging ideas
with others in their field, but dorms should offer more

variety. Clubs can also sponsor the programming aca
demic theme houses currently offer.
Without themes, dorms could sponsor a more diverse,
and possibly more interesting, mix of academically ori
ented activities without restricting themselves to a partic
ular field. After all, Branner, the residence with perhaps
the most intellectually stimulating program, has no aca
demic theme.
Perhaps Res Ed could establish an in-house speakers
bureau for those residences that have trouble drawing
interesting speakers. This Res Ed suboffice could draw
people from both the University and surrounding com
munities who might be less well-known than those the
Speakers Bureau lures but who would nonetheless be
willing to share their experience and knowledge with a
small group of students.
As it is now, themes seem to be almost foisted on
residences and are litde more than artificial designa
tions. Stanford seems to be doing a little university-style
resume padding by having all these theme houses, in
stead of just letting students determine where they
would like to live and what types of programming they
would like to see.
