# Power and passion's saga
## 
### 
We were playing at Spite and Malice the way that lovers
sometimes do. It was only a card game, but, what can I say,
she was far luckier than I and, more than likely, the better
player. One too many times she had just the cards she
needed to spite me, and the long shunned, ancient, red
beast reared up within me. I threw my cards down and
barked something tight lipped, overly loud and largely in
coherent at her. It was the first time I had ever lost my
temper at a girlfriend, and, in the embarrassed moments
that followed, I was greatly surprised just how easily and
completely she accepted the outburst. But what was really
disturbing was when she later told me just how attractive
she felt I was to her in that moment of rage. The incident in
troduced me to the fact that sexual attraction is a lot more
complicated, misty and somehow darker than I thought.

After the controversy over Dr. Ruth Westheimer's asser
tions last quarter, I really wanted to write a column on
modern sexual morality. I can't imagine a topic more rele
vant to humans in the '80s than trying to come to terms with
our sexuality on a spiritual level in the face of birth control,
communicable diseases, sexual abuse, and the relatively
short-term sexual relationships that have become the norm.
I wanted to jump on the P.C. bandwagon and denounce Dr.
Ruth. I wanted to argue that "no" should always mean no. I
wanted to make some coherent statement about the mini
mum responsibilities that a couple should have for each
other. I can't do it. No one should tell you how to run your
life, particularly your sex life, and I'm sure you don't need
or want me to. But more than that, I don't think any broad
assertion of the kind that Dr. Westheimer or her opponents
are prone to make can encompass the breadth of human
sexual interactions or the deep, spiritual hegira they
sometimes represent.
There are many ways to bump uglies, as a friend of mine
is fond of saying, but the fact is that there are many different
reasons to bump uglies as well. Sex fulfills several diverse
needs in our lives as we progress from adolescence, and not
all of those needs reflect parts of ourselves and others that
we can easily accept. For instance, the standard wimp com
plaint of men in the '80s, which I've often felt myself, is that
women say that they want men who are sensitive and will
respect them as equals, but it's the macho, insensitive jerks
who seem to get all the dates and always seem to have a
girlfriend. Well, I know from my own experience with my
ex-girlfriend that assertiveness, if not raw aggression, was at
tractive to her, and it seems to me that she, at least, was
more comfortable in the submissive role that she was
brought up to expect as a woman's place in a romantic rela
tionship. The fact seemed to bother her less than it did me,
for I was brought up with role models like Alan Alda, and
consequently I've always felt that there should be equality in
all facets of a relationship. Sex, I guess, is not about equality.
Nor is sex always about giving. Acquaintance rape is not
an easy topic and is, quite frankly, one which I have no right
to talk about, since I haven't even had direct secondhand
knowledge of any instance. Nevertheless, I can't help won
dering how it happens. The real problem I have with Dr.
Ruth's assertion last quarter is that it reinforces the idea that
there is some set of conditions which, when met, gives
someone the right to take sex from an unwilling partner. I
think that neither marriage, nor a heavy date, nor "advanced

foreplay" gives anyone that right. And yet some men not
only believe that right exists, but want that right to exist. I
just don't understand it. Watching the news the other night, I
heard that someone recently published a serious scientific
survey that reported that half (half!) the men surveyed said
that they would commit rape if they did not have to face the
consequences. (Half!) There must be some serious desire,
in most men at least, to take what you've been told you can
not have, to assert that kind of power in a relationship.
I was brought up to think that sex was only about procrea
tion and pleasure, but I've come to see that in the emotional
chaos of romance, sex is one place where our darkest
desires can invade reality and show as things about our
selves that we may not like, that we may not be able to ac
cept at all. And yet, as I have asserted before, real growth
begins with self acceptance. We are sexual creatures, and all
of us may have desires and needs that at times do not fit the
egalitarian ideals or the social mores of the culture we live
in, or even those that we personally embrace. Nevertheless,
our sexual identity is an important part (but only a part!) of
who we are, and in this part of our lives, as in all others, it is
only through self-knowledge and self-acceptance that we
can approach some kind of fulfillment.
Sex is not the dark side of love. In the face of the compli
cations of romance, the risks of disease and pregnancy and
the fact that relationships seem so ephemeral these days,
one friend told me she'd rather have her afternoon nap than
get involved with someone, and that may well be right for
her at this time. The media has hyped sex for years, trying to
sell everything from shaving cream to soda pop, and yet the
only thing they've managed to sell us consistently is the idea
that sex should be something superficial and far more fun
than it actually is at times. Nevertheless, there is joy in sex, a
joy deeper than that of impossible fantasies of tan and
depressingly beautiful people cavorting on a beach, a joy
that can face and come to terms with the darknesses and
dangers of sex. The joy of sex is that the elemental act of
sharing and acceptance is sexual.
There is a spiritual side to sexual relationships. I think
that many of us are looking for that commitment, that
nurture, that acceptance, that comfort and that love which,
while not necessarily confined to or even embodied in the
act of sex, I suspect can only be fully realized in a sexual re
lationship. The key, it seems to me, is not striving after
"good sex," but instead trying to find that openness, trust
and understanding that can only come through communica
tion, connection and caring. Maybe it is trite, but perhaps
we, as a culture, have placed too much emphasis on sex and
marriage, and not enough on love and commitment.
Less than a month after my girlfriend had returned to her
home far away from here, I received an incredibly short
note telling me she had been proposed to by another man.
It was the first I knew that we had broken up. She said no to
the other guy, and after the year or so it took for the inevi
table wounds to heal, we are still friends. The chemistry is
gone and our thoughts of marriage long fled, and yet our
care and the commitment to each other as people and as
friends has not changed. I have no answers about acquaint
ance rape, or what people's sex roles should be, or what is
really right or wrong in sexual relationships, or what our so
ciety's response should be toward the threat of AIDS. I'm
not sure any of us do. But I've found that what really lasts
and what really matters is how you relate heart to heart and
soul to soul. Everything else can subside in the span of a
day.
