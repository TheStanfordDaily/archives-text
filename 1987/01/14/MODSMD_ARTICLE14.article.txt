Personal liberty
is best weapon
Kurt Webber gives an admirable
account of the Soviets' overwhelming
superiority in "bullets per capita
aimed at Europe" in his column ap
pearing Wednesday, Jan. 7. In
response to Mr Webber's revelations I
would like to offer the following "So
what!"
Why should the United States arm
to the tooth in order to "defend"
Europeans? Let the people of Europe
defend themselves; they have a long
and glorious history of warfare that
proves their expertise in the arts of
rapine and pillage. If the American
military mission were simply to
protect American borders, then I
would hazard a guess that the savings

generated would be sufficient to build
lavish quarters for all of America's
homeless and send their children to
Harvard (of course, this should be
handled by the private sector).
The free nations of the world (can
you name any?!) have less to fear from
outside military aggression than from
their own ill-appreciation of liberty.
The most effective domestic and
foreign policy the United States could
possibly adopt would be to become a
shining example of a free society, but
I'm afraid prospects are slim.
I will offer a suggestion to those
who possess the State Department
mentality that the United States should
strive to win some global Parker
Brothers game. The notions of
freedom and material well-being can
be potent weapons in the fight to turn
back the red tide of communism
Open up trade to all nations and
remove all tariffs. Open up the bor-

ders to unlimited immigration. Let
America become the fabled land of
promise, then watch the unrest grow
behind the Iron Curtain and in every
dictatorship. Flood repressive
societies with foreign aid consisting of
color televisions, electric orange
juicers, Levi's 501 jeans, and colorful
T-shirts emblazoned with "UCLA" or
"Nebraska Cornhuskers" â€” that will
cause a stir!
Such actions would be far more
effective and far less dangerous than
threats of annihilation The greatest
fear of communists and fascists alike is
that individuals will discover that they
are morally superior to the state and
that their desires for material well
being are both just and attainable
