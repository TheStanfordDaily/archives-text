# Peace in the Middle East
## 
### 
Having read several articles about recent events in Israel
and Lebanon, including increased bombing by Israeli jets of
Palestinian guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon, I
recalled two aphorisms I had learned in high school: "The
only certainty in the universe is that nothing is certain" and
"The more things change, the more they stay the same."
While each contradicts the other paradoxically, both also
seem rather appropriate for the Middle East. I set out to
make some sense of the matter, and the following is the
result.

ISAAC WINER

My memory took me back to last November, recalling the
murder of a young Israeli in Jerusalem. Eliahu Amedi, a 22-
year-old rabbinical student, had been walking through the
Moslem quarter of the Old City when he was abducted and
stabbed to death by three Arab terrorists. The three later ad
mitted to being members of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a splinter group of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO). Yasir Arafat's PLO Fatah wing
in Beirut later claimed responsibility for the attack. The
youth's death incited rioting between Jews and Arabs in the
neighborhood, despite attempts by leaders of both com
munities to prevent conflict.
I wondered how attacking an innocent Jewish student
could serve the interests of Arafat, his PLO, and the Palestin
ian people. What did such a heinous and morally repugnant
act accomplish? What could Arafat stand to gain besides a
continuation of the hatred between the two peoples and a
renewed impasse in movements toward a lasting peace in
the region? Then I realized that I had begun to answer my
own questions. The success of Arafat and his PLO hinges
upon the perpetuation of hatred between Palestinian Arabs
and Jews.
This theory gained credence as I continued reviewing
recent events. On Dec. 11, Palestinian Arab students clashed
with Israeli Defense Force (IDF) troops in the Israeli
occupied territory of the West Bank. The incident occurred
at Bir Zeit University, a center of Palestinian Arab nationalist
activism and site of numerous anti-Israel demonstrations.
The IDF had set up roadblocks outside the university to
check incoming personnel when students staged a sit-down
strike to protest the roadblocks. More students from within
the university left the campus to set up their own
roadblocks and began throwing rocks at Israeli troops that
had amassed outside the campus. The troops fired tear gas
at the students and warning shots in the air, but the students
refused to disperse and continued throwing rocks. Defend
ing themselves, Israeli troops opened fire at the feet of the
students, killing two and wounding 11. Military investiga
tions on campus later found pamphlets distributed by the
PLO praising recent massacres of Israelis and urging stu
dents to "liberate Palestine with [their] blood."
Successful collaboration by Israel and Jordan in adminis
tering the territory, exemplified by the establishment of
Arab-owned banks and the election of Arab mayors in West
Bank towns, as well as attempts by Jordan's King Hussein to
sway West Bank Palestinians away from the PLO and into his
favor have forced Arafat to instigate tensions in the region in
order to regain influence. The recent conflicts between Jews

and Arabs, orchestrated by the PLO, should be seen as an at
tempt by Arafat to hold on to a diminishing following. Pales
tinian Arabs realize that their allegiance to the FT.O has
resulted in little more than continued bloodshed, while
pragmatic acceptance of the Israeli occupation has resulted
in a fruitful economic and social development of Arab
towns. Statistics show that the standard of living of Palestin
ian Arabs in the occupied territory is much higher than that
of Arabs in many of the surrounding countries.
To be sure, Arafat has not played his cards right, but what
I refer to here is more than just the PLO's continued terror
ist effoits in Israel and the Western world. Last year Arafat
missed a golden opportunity to ally with King Hussein, and,
in so doing, he brought the peace process to a screeching
halt. Hussein, by no meaas a friend of Israel, simply under
stood that peace can only be realized by the PLO denounc
ing its terrorist acts and recognizing Israel's legitimate right
to exist as a free and sovereign nation. Arafat refused to ac
cept these terms, and Hussein responded by closing Arafat's
Fatah offices in Jordan. The guerrillas therein were subse
quently forced to leave the country. After having been
kicked out of Lebanon in 1982 by Israel's invasion and out of
Jordan in 1970 and again in 1986 by his own intransigence,
the PLO really was without a home.
But the story does not end here. It picks up again in, of all
places, Lebanon. There, Israel maintains a 10-mile security
zone in southern Lebanon in order to prevent terrorist at
tacks on its northern border. Toward that end it supports
the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a predominantly Christian
force, which patrols the zone. Currently, Palestinian Arab
forces are waging a struggle against the pro-Iranian Shi'ite
Amal militia for control of positions in Beirut and the sur
rounding area. Because the SLA and other Christian forces
also oppose the Shi'ite extremists, they have forged a new
alliance with the Palestinian Arabs, ironically once their arch
enemies. I recalled my aphorism â€” nothing is certain, not
even age-old enmities. As a result of the newly formed
Christian-Palestinian alliance, Christian forces are facilitating
the return to Lebanon of pro-Arafat Palestinian Arab forces,
who are joining the fight against the Shi'ites. The ultimate
aim, however, of the Palestinian Arab return to Lebanon is,
unquestionably, the resumption of terrorist attacks on Is
rael. Some things never change.
While making predictions in such a highly volatile region
is next to impossible, it would seem the Christian militias
have taken a very risky, short-sighted gamble in facilitating
the Palestinian Arab return to Lebanon. Soon enough the
fighting between Palestinian Arabs and Shi'ites will end, and
the age-old conflict between Christians and Moslems will be
reborn. Israel might be forced to make another incursion
into southern Lebanon in order to flush out an excess of
hostile Palestinian guerrillas, and more blood will be shed.
Igniting the tinderbox of tensions between Arab and Jew
within Israel accompanied by the PLO's return to southern
Lebanon might precipitate Arafat's Waterloo. Israel might,
once and for all, rid herself and the Western world of his
terrorist organization. With Israel calling the shots and the
PLO no longer in the way, Palestinian Arab moderates
would be more able to express their views. Compromise
will finally become more possible. Peace would become a
more attainable goal.
