# Diver will compete pending drug test case
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
The Santa Clara County Superior Court yes
terday granted a temporary restraining order
that permits Simone LeVant, captain of the Stan
ford women's diving team, to resume participa
tion in NCAA competition.
LeVant had been barred from competition by
the NCAA since October for refusing to sign a
consent form that required her to submit to a
drug test in the event of post-season competi
tion.
LeVant, who is being represented by the San
Francisco law firm of Keker & Brockett on be
half of the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) of Northern California, alleges that the
NCAA drug testing program is unconstitutional

under the California State Constitution because
it invades her right to privacy.
The temporary restraining order allows
LeVant to participate in NCAA competition
pending a March 11 hearing on the lawsuit.
Susan Harriman, an attorney with Keker &
Brockett, was pleased with Judge Peter Stone's
granting of the restraining order. Although Har
riman acknowledged that the March 11 hearing
will be "a much bigger battle," she said: "The
drug testing program is unconstitutional, and I
think we'll be successful" in proving it.
LeVant, when reached after the hearing yes
terday, said she was pleased with the granting
of the temporary restraining order.
"I'm really happy. I'm glad I can compete,"
she said.
On the March 11 hearing, she said: "We'll just

have to wait and see."
Harriman said the case will probably be ap
pealed by the losing side in the March 11
hearing. "The case is likely to go a lot further
than the Santa Clara County Superior Court,"
she said.
Doug Johnson, director of legislative services
for the NCAA, agreed with Harriman's assess
ment. When reached in Mission, Kan., before
yesterday's hearing, Johnson declined to com
ment on the LeVant case specifically, but did ac
knowledge that if a temporary restraining order
were granted, "the (NCAA) would probably
challenge it."
"If no one has to take it (the drug test), what's
the purpose of having a drug test?" Johnson
asked.
The drug test under question requires that

an athlete urinate into a cup in full view of an
NCAA official. The urine is then tested for traces
of drugs.
This procedure is "humiliating and degrad
ing," according to Harriman. There is "no proof
at all that these athletes are using steroids or il
legal drugs They're (the NCAA) subjecting
these people to gross violations of privacy for
what we think are no justifiable reasons," Har
riman said.
Andy Geiger, Stanford director of athletics,
also faulted the NCAA procedure. "We are
firmly opposed to the use of performance
enhancing and illegal drugs I am not against
all drug testing in principle, but, as 1 have told
our athletes, I am against the procedures
adopted by the NCAA," he said.
Geiger added, "LeVant raises serious issues

that deserve careful consideration by the court
and by the NCAA."
While the LeVant case is currently the only
direct challenge to the NCAA regarding the con
stitutionality of its drug test, a similar case has
arisen at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
In this case, a University of Colorado distance
runner has brought suit against the university,
alleging that its mandatory drug test — to
which he submitted and tested negative — is an
invasion of his constitutional rights.
According to Ben Rich, general counsel to
the University of Colorado, the athlete is a
"token plaintiff' who responded to advertise
ments put out by the ACLU seeking just such a
person. The ACLU, according to Rich, hopes to
make the Colorado case a class action suit.

adopted by the NCAA," he said.
Geiger added, "LeVant raises serious issues

that deserve careful consideration by the court
and by the NCAA."
While the LeVant case is currently the only
direct challenge to the NCAA regarding the con
stitutionality of its drug test, a similar case has
arisen at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
In this case, a University of Colorado distance
runner has brought suit against the university,
alleging that its mandatory drug test — to
which he submitted and tested negative — is an
invasion of his constitutional rights.
According to Ben Rich, general counsel to
the University of Colorado, the athlete is a
"token plaintiff' who responded to advertise
ments put out by the ACLU seeking just such a
person. The ACLU, according to Rich, hopes to
make the Colorado case a class action suit.
