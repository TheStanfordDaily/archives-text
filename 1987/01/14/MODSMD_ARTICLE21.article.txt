## Busy Bug finds 7 percent solution 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
I was driving along Highway 101
last weekend when I noticed one of
those yellow warning signs with a
truck going down an incline. The
words on the sign read "7 Percent
Grade Next 6 Miles." To what does the
7 percent refer?
— Sherlock Holmes
The sign refers to neither the book
"The Seven Percent Solution" nor a
poor score on your driver's test.
Officer Robertson of the California
Highway Patrol in Redwood City told
me that the signs signify the
percentage rise in the highway from a
straightaway. The signs are primarily
used to warn truck drivers that they
will need to downshift.
The signs are used infrequently
throughout the state and Robertson
said that "you won't find (grade signs)
on normal highways."
Tom Hafley, the regional mainte
nance manager for the California De
partment of Transportation, said, "Very
seldom will you ever see a grade sign
unless it is over 6 percent." This is be
cause highways are rarely built with
grades of more than 6 percent, he said.
Both Robertson and Hafley said the
steepest grade they knew of in the area

was on Highway 101 southbound near
San Luis Obispo, which is where you
must have been last weekend, because
it has a 7 percent grade.
And that deduction was elementary,
my dear Watson.
Dear Bug Me,
While waiting in line on registration
day to tell the University that I did not
have my tuition money in hand, I
noticed that my deferment form con
tained no carbon. Yet somehow, the
bottom sheet was a copy of the top
sheet. How does this amazing phenom
enon work?

As I'm sure you know, when you
owe somebody money anything can
happen.
In this case, the University has
amazed you (although not enough for
you to pay them in a timely manner) by
their magical carbonless paper.
Weyerhaeuser is a manufacturer of
carbonless paper and I spoke with
Dave Foreman, one of the company's
enthusiastic district sales managers.
Forsman was more than happy to
discuss with me the virtues of his prod
uct — not of your University bill.
Forsman says that in a two-part form,
the top sheet is called "carbonless
back." It is completely covered with
encapsulated carbon bubbles. These
are then transmitted to the "carbonless

bottom," or the face of the second part
of the form.
To get the encapsulated carbon on
the paper, a trailing-blade coater (or an
emulsified solution) is used.
Producing carbonless paper is an ex
pensive process. Forsman said that
using carbonless paper is twice as
costly as using conventional carbon
paper but that it is "coming on strong."
Apparendy, people are willing to pay

more not to get carbon on their fin
gers.
"The West Coast leads the nation in
carbonless paper," Forsman said. Most
companies are now using carbonless
paper in their business forms, with one
notable exception — Hertz Rent-A-Car.
"I can't believe it," said Forsman, al
though he noted that the cost was
probably a consideration to Hertz be

cause the company must purchase so
many business forms.
Now all we need is some sort of
"inkless paper'' so that you don't get
ink all over your fingers when you
read The Daily.
Dear Bug Me,
How marry Mexican citizens are stu
dents at Stanford this year? I have
noticed there are more and more of us.
Can you give an estimate of how many
Mexicans have studied at Stanford?
— A Mexican friend-seeker
According to a Jan. 7 article in the
Daily, there are 77 students from
Mexico this year.
Marcia Makino, assistant director for
foreign student advising gave me the
figures for Mexican enrollment for the
last 10 years. From them, I found out
that 1,157 Mexicans have studied at
Stanford in the last decade. Mexican
enrollment hit a high in 1982 when
there were 140 Mexican students en
rolled.
Dear Bug Me,
Is the X-ray/metal detector combina
tion at airports really as safe as they
say? Do audio tapes go through with
out picking up hiss? Is film under 1000
ASA really invulnerable? Can cameras
and electronics go through with no
hidden damage?
— Daiid Chang

Most professional photograpers
agree that it is not a good idea to take
film through a metal detector. Accord
ing to Kevin Harris of the Kodak Con
sumer Center in Palo Alto, whether or
not it is safe to take film through a
metal detector has nothing to do with
the ASA of the film. Harris said the key
factors were the quality of the film
(and he said that even if you had new
rolls of Kodak film they might not all
be safe) and the age of the film.
Harris recommends that if you must
travel with film, you should either in
vest in a lead-lined bag that camera
stores sell for this purpose, or hand
your film over to the attendant at the
metal detector so you can go through
without it.
With respect to audio and video
tape, they can go through safely.
Kathy Rae, a sales coordinator for
audio and video tape manufacturer 3M,
said that the equipment at airports
does not create a magnetic field and, as
a result, they are confident to ship their
products by air.
As far as electronics are concerned,
Sony Corp. sales representative Jim
Ferguson suggests that you don't put
electronics through the metal detector
if you don't have to.
By and large, Ferguson said,
electronics are safe. But in some ex
treme cases there is a possibility of
fatigue on weak or thin metal parts,
and some damage might result.

"I can't believe it," said Forsman, al
though he noted that the cost was
probably a consideration to Hertz be

cause the company must purchase so

Now all we need is some sort of
"inkless paper'' so that you don't get
ink all over your fingers when you

Dear Bug Me,
How marry Mexican citizens are stu
dents at Stanford this year? I have
noticed there are more and more of us.
Can you give an estimate of how many
Mexicans have studied at Stanford?
— A Mexican friend-seeker
According to a Jan. 7 article in the
Daily, there are 77 students from
Mexico this year.
Marcia Makino, assistant director for
foreign student advising gave me the
figures for Mexican enrollment for the
last 10 years. From them, I found out
that 1,157 Mexicans have studied at
Stanford in the last decade. Mexican
enrollment hit a high in 1982 when
there were 140 Mexican students en
rolled.
Dear Bug Me,
Is the X-ray/metal detector combina
tion at airports really as safe as they
say? Do audio tapes go through with
out picking up hiss? Is film under 1000
ASA really invulnerable? Can cameras
and electronics go through with no
hidden damage?
— Daiid Chang

Most professional photograpers
agree that it is not a good idea to take
film through a metal detector. Accord
ing to Kevin Harris of the Kodak Con
sumer Center in Palo Alto, whether or
not it is safe to take film through a
metal detector has nothing to do with
the ASA of the film. Harris said the key
factors were the quality of the film
(and he said that even if you had new
rolls of Kodak film they might not all
be safe) and the age of the film.
Harris recommends that if you must
travel with film, you should either in
vest in a lead-lined bag that camera
stores sell for this purpose, or hand
your film over to the attendant at the
metal detector so you can go through
without it.
With respect to audio and video
tape, they can go through safely.
Kathy Rae, a sales coordinator for
audio and video tape manufacturer 3M,
said that the equipment at airports
does not create a magnetic field and, as
a result, they are confident to ship their
products by air.
As far as electronics are concerned,
Sony Corp. sales representative Jim
Ferguson suggests that you don't put
electronics through the metal detector
if you don't have to.
By and large, Ferguson said,
electronics are safe. But in some ex
treme cases there is a possibility of
fatigue on weak or thin metal parts,
and some damage might result.

Dear Bug Me,
I was driving along Highway 101
last weekend when I noticed one of
those yellow warning signs with a
truck going down an incline. The
words on the sign read "7 Percent
Grade Next 6 Miles." To what does the
7 percent refer?
— Sherlock Holmes
The sign refers to neither the book
"The Seven Percent Solution" nor a
poor score on your driver's test.
Officer Robertson of the California
Highway Patrol in Redwood City told
me that the signs signify the
percentage rise in the highway from a
straightaway. The signs are primarily
used to warn truck drivers that they
will need to downshift.
The signs are used infrequently
throughout the state and Robertson
said that "you won't find (grade signs)
on normal highways."
Tom Hafley, the regional mainte
nance manager for the California De
partment of Transportation, said, "Very
seldom will you ever see a grade sign
unless it is over 6 percent." This is be
cause highways are rarely built with
grades of more than 6 percent, he said.
Both Robertson and Hafley said the
steepest grade they knew of in the area

was on Highway 101 southbound near
San Luis Obispo, which is where you
must have been last weekend, because
it has a 7 percent grade.
And that deduction was elementary,
my dear Watson.
Dear Bug Me,
While waiting in line on registration
day to tell the University that I did not
have my tuition money in hand, I
noticed that my deferment form con
tained no carbon. Yet somehow, the
bottom sheet was a copy of the top
sheet. How does this amazing phenom
enon work?
— Carbon Dating Service Member
As I'm sure you know, when you
owe somebody money anything can
happen.
In this case, the University has
amazed you (although not enough for
you to pay them in a timely manner) by
their magical carbonless paper.
Weyerhaeuser is a manufacturer of
carbonless paper and I spoke with
Dave Foreman, one of the company's
enthusiastic district sales managers.
Forsman was more than happy to
discuss with me the virtues of his prod
uct — not of your University bill.
Forsman says that in a two-part form,
the top sheet is called "carbonless
back." It is completely covered with
encapsulated carbon bubbles. These
are then transmitted to the "carbonless

bottom," or the face of the second part
of the form.
To get the encapsulated carbon on
the paper, a trailing-blade coater (or an
emulsified solution) is used.
Producing carbonless paper is an ex
pensive process. Forsman said that
using carbonless paper is twice as
costly as using conventional carbon
paper but that it is "coming on strong."
Apparendy, people are willing to pay

more not to get carbon on their fin
gers.
"The West Coast leads the nation in
carbonless paper," Forsman said. Most
companies are now using carbonless
paper in their business forms, with one
notable exception — Hertz Rent-A-Car.
"I can't believe it," said Forsman, al
though he noted that the cost was
probably a consideration to Hertz be
