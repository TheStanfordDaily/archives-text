## Iggy goes Pop: The return of rock's wild one The ups and downs of the original punk rocker 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Surely the most heartening thing
about 1986 is that it was the year Iggy
Pop finally got airplay on mainstream
rock radio stations. Last October, Iggy
(you can't stand on formality with
someone named Iggy Pop) released
"Blah-Blah-Blah," his first album since
1982, and two tracks, "Cry For Love"
and "Real Wild Child (Wild One),"
have muscled their way onto radio
playlists. Iggy Pop can now be heard
alongside the Pet Shop Boys. Amazing!
But who the hell is Iggy Pop? It's
understandable if you've never heard
of the guy. He's never had a hit single,
hit album or sell-out tour, and hasn't
exactly been flooded with offers to do
Pepsi commercials. But for almost 20
years, Iggy has been rock's wildest
child, the original member of pop
music's lunatic fringe.
Born James Osterberg about 40
years ago, Iggy first achieved notoriety

in-Detroit during the late '60s as lead
singer for a group called the Stooges.
The Stooges are one of those groups
listened to by very few people but lis
tened to by all the right people: The
Ramones, the Sex Pistols and a host of
other punk groups have all saluted the
Stooges' music as a seminal influence.
They weren't calling it punk rock,
death-rock, hardcore or whatever back
in 1969. In fact, no one knew what to
call the Stooges' music, which is why

their albums were quickly shot down
from the lower reaches of the charts.
In 1969, rock fans were still bobbing
their heads to the gentle hippie sounds
of Crosby, Stills & Nash at Woodstock;
they certainly weren't interested in this
... this noise, which sounded
positively prehistoric. The Stooges'
first two albums, "The Stooges" (1969)
and "Fun House" (1970), are probably
Casey Kasem's idea of hell: musically
hard, fast and uncompromising. With
song titles like the immortal "I Wanna
Be Your Dog," it's safe to say that the
Stooges weren't trying to compete with
the Archies.
The Stooges' lyrics expressed the
classic teenage dilemma of nothing to
do and no particular place to go. But
when combined with the primal
screams that Iggy liked to throw into
each song for good measure, their
world view took on distinctly nihilistic,
if not apocalyptic, overtones. From the
vantage point of 1987, it's hard not to
see an off-hand brilliance in these al-

They foreshadow, the. rise of
punk in remarkable detail, and, more
simply, as music they're wonderfully
mind-blowing.
The anarchy of the Stooges' albums
was in fact an extension of their legen
dary concerts, where Iggy did
whatever he could to outrage and
provoke the audience. The goal was to
make something, anything, happen,
and so, lucky concertgoers might get to
see Iggy expose himself, roll around

on shards of broken glass or dive right
into the front rows. (Sometimes the
crowd would catch him, other times
they'd part to make way, with dis
astrous consequences.) These shows
were a long way off from the
Woodstock Nation; on that everyone
could agree.
Unfortunately, despite the group's
wild stage reputation, almost nobody
heard their albums. But one of the few
who did was David Bowie, then still a
weedy young hopeful whose eyes
didn't match color. The albums made
an impression: Young Bowie regarded
Iggy Pop as a major figure in the world
of rock 'n' roll and even wrote a song
("Jean Genie") based on him. By 1973,
the newly famous Bowie was further
ing the cause of punk himself, in the
guise of a spiky-haired freak named
Ziggy Stardust. With his new clout, he
volunteered to produce some Stooges
tapes that had been gathering dust on
the CBS shelves. But even he couldn't
resuscitate the Stooges' career. The
chaotic-sounding album he produced,
"Raw Power," died a spectacular death
and the Stooges broke up. Confronted
with the '70s, Iggy Pop went under
ground.
That would be the end of our story if
it weren't for Bowie's intervention
again, in 1976. Bowie and Iggy were
both serious screw-ups at the time.
Iggy had no band and no record con
tract and was slowly degenerating,
despite attempts to clean himself up at
an L.A. sanitarium. Bowie was riding
high in the charts, but was, by all ac
counts, a half-insane neo-Nazi drug ad
dict. (Rock stars were so much more
fun back in the 70s. Why don't we
have anybody this colorful now?)
Bowie suggested that the two save
themselves and escape decadent L.A,
so they fled to the Turkish sector of
Berlin, of all places.
The resulting albums are the high
points of both singers' careers. The
two Iggy Pop albums that Bowie co
wrote and produced in 1977, "The
Idiot" and "Lust For Life," find Iggy
looking over his shoulder at all the
spectres of his past life. This viewpoint
makes for vaguely chilling lyrics, set to
an ominous, industrial-sounding type
of rock that predicts the rise of the syn
thesizer. But the upswing of these al
bums, as the exhilarating title track on
"Lust for Life" made clear, was that Iggy
was back! Cleaned up! And ready to
show the world what he could really
do!
Things didn't work out quite right,
however. After a great live album, "TV.
Eye" (1978), which effectively sum
marized his entire previous career,

Iggy slid downhill again. Ever the
screw-up, he went back to his old
habits of booze, drugs and womaniz
ing. He still released albums, but the
record companies got smaller and
smaller, and fewer and fewer people
took notice. Despite the fact that young
punk groups fell to their knees at the
sound of his name, it looked like the Ig
was a wash-up.
Bowie helped turn things around
once more. In 1983, he had a huge hit
with "China Girl," a song Iggy had
originally done on "The Idiot," and the
money Iggy received in royalty checks
persuaded him to give one last shot at
cleaning himself up. Happily, he got
healthy and got married. Proving in the
end that you can't keep a good screw
up down, Iggy recorded some new
songs and set about to trying to interest
record companies. Re-enter Mr. Enter
tainment himself, David Bowie,

blandly remodeled for the '80s as a
multi-media charmer and maker of
hits, hits, hits. Said Bowie of Iggys's
"Blah-Blah-Blah" tapes: "I can make it
commercial as hell."
That must be the understatement of
the year. Bowie didn't just make "Blah-
Blah-Blah" commercial, he groomed
and upholstered it to death. All of
Iggy's old rough edges have been
glossed over; in their place we get big
dance beats, synthesizers gone amok
and hits, hits, hits.
But, but. Despite the umpteen coats
of shellac on the music, Iggy's lyrics
are as sharp as ever. "Cry for Love" is
his best, most revealing number here;
it's both an affecting confession ("In
searching for a meaningful
embrace/Sometimes my self-respect
took second place") and a defiant
stance, Iggy's manifesto, if you will
("Status seekers â€” I never cared/Once

I found out/They never dared/To seize
the world and/Shake it upside down").
It's a reminder that even a com
promised Iggy Pop is a welcome an
tidote to the sleek banality of today's
music.
"Winners and losers, which one am
I?" sings Iggy on the closing song of
"Blah-Blah-Blah." During his career
he's been both, and I hope he manages
to stay on top of things this time. "Blah-
Blah-Blah" is a disappointment but it
has its great moments, and now more
than ever we need a figure like Iggy
Pop. The bogeyman of conservative
radio programmers and groups like
the Parents' Music Resource Center
(a.k.a. "The Washington Wives"), he
represents excess, raw energy and a
disarming kind of honesty, all qualities
notably absent from the music of 1987.
Would the Pet Shop Boys ever record a
song called "I Wanna Be Your Dog"? I
think not. Welcome back, Ig.
