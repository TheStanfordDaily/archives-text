## Boesky prompts debate on Wall Street 
### STEVEN LURIE Editorial staff 
The name Ivan Boesky is not easy to
pronounce. And so the relentless Wall
Street wheeler dealer is referred to in
finance circles as "Ivan the Terrible."
The nickname is well deserved:
Boesky is a hard-working and ruthless
broker who works 18 hours a day
while standing most of the time in
front of his 300-line telephone bank.
That is, he used to work that hard.
Now, Boesky is barred from the securi
ties industry because he was indicted
in the biggest scandal to rock Wall
Street in decades. Boesky
(pronounced Bow-ski) must pay a
$100 million penalty f£>r illegally using
insider information for personal profit.
Boesky's declared specialty was the
high-return game known as risk ar
bitrage, the opportunistic buying and
selling of stocks in companies that ap

pear on the verge of being taken over
by other firms. The prices of the stocks
of companies involved in takeover bids
generally surge, allowing arbitragers
the chance to make swift money.
Information is key in arbitrage activi
ties. It is said that on Wall Street,
"knowledge is power is money."
Boeksy hired more than 100
employees to research companies that
seemed likely candidates for mergers,
which have become more common in
the 1980s. Arbitrage based on public
knowledge of acquisition bids has long
been recognized as a legitimate exer
cise in which professional traders
assume much of the risk inherent in
trading stocks.
Boesky, however, illegally used se
cret tips of insider information
supplied by former investment banker
Dennis Levine, who was also indicted
by the Securites and Exchange Com
mission (SEC).

Jack Steele of the USC business
school labels Boesky and his collegues
the "robber barons" of our age.
Boesky, knowing beforehand about
upcoming takeovers, reaped huge and
illegal profits.
The stakes involved are high. During
the merger boom of the 1980s, Boesky
lost and won with apparently equal
ease — but usually seemed to win. In
1984, Boesky collected about $50 mil
lion when Texaco bought Getty and an
additional $65 million when Chevron
purchased Gulf. He was reputed to
have lost $40 million in less than a
week in December 1984 when Phillips
Petroleum fended off corporate raider
T. Boone Pickins. In little more than a
decade, Boesky parlayed the activity of
risk arbitrage into an estimated net
worth of $200 million.
"The Boesky case is clearcut," said
Kenneth Scott, professor of law and
business at Stanford. "He did wrong. In
essence, he stole information from
sources having a duty of confiden
tiality. Rule l4e-3 of the SEC Code of
Federal Regulations states that inside
information cannot be used to trade
for profit of any kind (personal or for a
fund one may be managing)."
Few dispute the legality or gravity of
Boesky's actions. Ambiguity, however,
surrounds the transfer of information.
The securities business generates a
great deal of data that is disseminated
through industry newsletters, reports
and magazines.

Walter Wriston, former chairman of
America's largest bank, Citicorp, ob
served: "I have great trouble in
knowing the difference between in
sider information and a very fine re
search report."
Myron Scholes, a professor at both
the law and business schools, des
cribed the function of information as
"very important to make markets more
efficient. Ideally, the price of, say, a
stock should reflect its value. To gauge
this value, security analysts examine
and distribute data. Information also
should affect prices quickly."
"The price will deviate from value in
cases where information is blocked.
Now what Boesky did was blatantly il
legal. But access to information cannot
be too greatly regulated because one
cannot be reasonably expected to in

vestigate each of one's sources," he
said.
Boesky hurt many citizens by pilfer
ing from funds that thousands of inves
tors had contributed to the market.
Such actions have led some to criticize
the legitimacy of Wall Street's deal
makers, including arbitragers, invest
ment bankers, lawyers and corporate
raiders. Raiders have made huge prof
its through the practice of green mail.
In this practice, one first threatens to
take over a company by buying up
many stock shares which in turn drives
up the price of the shares. Then, one
may resell the stocks at a swift and sub
stantial profit.
Mary Rose Oakar, Democratic repre
sentative from Ohio, stated:
"Corporate America is being held
hostage by the corporate raider.
Profitable companies are being driven
into debt. American jobs are lost, and
American businesses are being taken
overseas, all so that a few enormously
wealthy individuals can add to their
personal fortunes."
Kenneth Scott rebutted: "In
Congress and in the media, people are
trying to make use of the Boesky case
for their own tangential use.... Al
though risk arbitragers interact with
raiders and green mailers, their activi
ties are quite separate. What is happen
ing now is that politicians ... are using
the Boesky affair to cast light upon a
sector of the securities industry that
they do not like."

What will really result from the
Boesky affair?
J.D. Duffie, assistant professor at the
Business School, predicts "less flam
boyance on Wall Street. But basically
only certain areas will be affected.
Banking and Wall Street will not fun
damentaly change."
Duffie notes recent changes: "High
rollers have become more common
on the street. Also, a change has
occured in the ethics of the deal
makers. The current joke is: What is the
conscience of a broker? Answer: a little
voice in his head saying, you might get
caught.' People will and should now
act with more prudence."
Amid the debate and publicity, life
has changed for Ivan Boesky. Once a
multi-millionaire businessman, he
held prestigious positions, such as
trustee of the American Ballet Theater.
Boesky has had to resign his posts, and
he defaulted on a $1.5 million pledge
to Princeton University, where his son
is a junior. Also, Boesky's book
"Merger Mania," subtitled "Arbitrage:
Wall Street's Best Kept Money-Making
Secret," was pulled from distribution.
In the book, Boesky loftily declared,
"There are no esoteric tricks that
enable arbitragers to outwit the sys
tem." Now everyone knows better.
After the scandal, Boesky said, "If my
mistakes launch a process of re
examination of the rules and practices
of our financial marketplace, then per
haps some good will result."

personal fortunes."
Kenneth Scott rebutted: "In
Congress and in the media, people are
trying to make use of the Boesky case
for their own tangential use.... Al
though risk arbitragers interact with
raiders and green mailers, their activi
ties are quite separate. What is happen
ing now is that politicians ... are using
the Boesky affair to cast light upon a
sector of the securities industry that
they do not like."

What will really result from the
Boesky affair?
J.D. Duffie, assistant professor at the
Business School, predicts "less flam
boyance on Wall Street. But basically
only certain areas will be affected.
Banking and Wall Street will not fun
damentaly change."
Duffie notes recent changes: "High
rollers have become more common
on the street. Also, a change has
occured in the ethics of the deal
makers. The current joke is: What is the
conscience of a broker? Answer: a little
voice in his head saying, you might get
caught.' People will and should now
act with more prudence."
Amid the debate and publicity, life
has changed for Ivan Boesky. Once a
multi-millionaire businessman, he
held prestigious positions, such as
trustee of the American Ballet Theater.
Boesky has had to resign his posts, and
he defaulted on a $1.5 million pledge
to Princeton University, where his son
is a junior. Also, Boesky's book
"Merger Mania," subtitled "Arbitrage:
Wall Street's Best Kept Money-Making
Secret," was pulled from distribution.
In the book, Boesky loftily declared,
"There are no esoteric tricks that
enable arbitragers to outwit the sys
tem." Now everyone knows better.
After the scandal, Boesky said, "If my
mistakes launch a process of re
examination of the rules and practices
of our financial marketplace, then per
haps some good will result."

The name Ivan Boesky is not easy to
pronounce. And so the relentless Wall
Street wheeler dealer is referred to in
finance circles as "Ivan the Terrible."
The nickname is well deserved:
Boesky is a hard-working and ruthless
broker who works 18 hours a day
while standing most of the time in
front of his 300-line telephone bank.
That is, he used to work that hard.
Now, Boesky is barred from the securi
ties industry because he was indicted
in the biggest scandal to rock Wall
Street in decades. Boesky
(pronounced Bow-ski) must pay a
$100 million penalty f£>r illegally using
insider information for personal profit.
Boesky's declared specialty was the
high-return game known as risk ar
bitrage, the opportunistic buying and
selling of stocks in companies that ap

pear on the verge of being taken over
by other firms. The prices of the stocks
of companies involved in takeover bids
generally surge, allowing arbitragers
the chance to make swift money.
Information is key in arbitrage activi
ties. It is said that on Wall Street,
"knowledge is power is money."
Boeksy hired more than 100
employees to research companies that
seemed likely candidates for mergers,
which have become more common in
the 1980s. Arbitrage based on public
knowledge of acquisition bids has long
been recognized as a legitimate exer
cise in which professional traders
assume much of the risk inherent in
trading stocks.
Boesky, however, illegally used se
cret tips of insider information
supplied by former investment banker
Dennis Levine, who was also indicted
by the Securites and Exchange Com
mission (SEC).

Jack Steele of the USC business
school labels Boesky and his collegues
the "robber barons" of our age.
Boesky, knowing beforehand about
upcoming takeovers, reaped huge and
illegal profits.
The stakes involved are high. During
the merger boom of the 1980s, Boesky
lost and won with apparently equal
ease — but usually seemed to win. In
1984, Boesky collected about $50 mil
lion when Texaco bought Getty and an
additional $65 million when Chevron
purchased Gulf. He was reputed to
have lost $40 million in less than a
week in December 1984 when Phillips
Petroleum fended off corporate raider
T. Boone Pickins. In little more than a
decade, Boesky parlayed the activity of
risk arbitrage into an estimated net
worth of $200 million.
"The Boesky case is clearcut," said
Kenneth Scott, professor of law and
business at Stanford. "He did wrong. In
essence, he stole information from
sources having a duty of confiden
tiality. Rule l4e-3 of the SEC Code of
Federal Regulations states that inside
information cannot be used to trade
for profit of any kind (personal or for a
fund one may be managing)."
Few dispute the legality or gravity of
Boesky's actions. Ambiguity, however,
surrounds the transfer of information.
The securities business generates a
great deal of data that is disseminated
through industry newsletters, reports
and magazines.

Walter Wriston, former chairman of
America's largest bank, Citicorp, ob
served: "I have great trouble in
knowing the difference between in
sider information and a very fine re
search report."
Myron Scholes, a professor at both
the law and business schools, des
cribed the function of information as
"very important to make markets more
efficient. Ideally, the price of, say, a
stock should reflect its value. To gauge
this value, security analysts examine
and distribute data. Information also
should affect prices quickly."
"The price will deviate from value in
cases where information is blocked.
Now what Boesky did was blatantly il
legal. But access to information cannot
be too greatly regulated because one
cannot be reasonably expected to in

vestigate each of one's sources," he
said.
Boesky hurt many citizens by pilfer
ing from funds that thousands of inves
tors had contributed to the market.
Such actions have led some to criticize
the legitimacy of Wall Street's deal
makers, including arbitragers, invest
ment bankers, lawyers and corporate
raiders. Raiders have made huge prof
its through the practice of green mail.
In this practice, one first threatens to
take over a company by buying up
many stock shares which in turn drives
up the price of the shares. Then, one
may resell the stocks at a swift and sub
stantial profit.
Mary Rose Oakar, Democratic repre
sentative from Ohio, stated:
"Corporate America is being held
hostage by the corporate raider.
Profitable companies are being driven
into debt. American jobs are lost, and
American businesses are being taken
overseas, all so that a few enormously
wealthy individuals can add to their
personal fortunes."
