## One year after funding cuts: four sports varsity, one club 
### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
Four of the five varsity sports teams
that the Athletic Department cut from
its budget last spring have had their
funding restored — but at a greatly
reduced level — and the fifth, the
women's Softball team, will play its up
coming season as a club sport.
Coaches from the men's and
women's fencing teams, the wrestling
team and the women's field hockey
team indicated, however, that they con
sidered the duration and amount of
continued Athletic Department sup
port uncertain.
Althletic Director Andy Geiger had
announced last March that the five var
sity sports would be eliminated from
the Athletic Department budget at the
beginning of their 1986-87 seasons.
The cuts were aimed at reducing a
projected $2.3 million deficit at the
Athletic Department over the next four
years.
The elimination of the five sports
would have saved an estimated
$200,000 to $250,000 a year in operat
ing expenses and another $200,000 in
scholarship aid.
Geiger said that while it is possible
that the teams could be removed from
the Athletic Department budget and
have to become self-sufficient in the fu
ture, it is "not entirely probable" that

such a course of action would be
taken.
Men's and women's fencing coach
Buzz Hurst, however, said he esti
mated that the University could end all
funding fon his teams as early as fall
quarter this year.
Hurst said that if his teams "have to
be self-supporting by fall, there is no
way we can do it."
At the present time, there is "no fat"
in the fencing teams budgets, Hurst
said, noting that this year the fencing
team has received only half of the
funds it had been allocated in previous
years.
Continued funding by the Athletic
Department is essential for the con

tinuation of fencing as a varsity sport,
he said.
According to Hurst, the fencing team
only began to put together a fund
raising program four years ago. Al
though he said the fencing team could
eventually become self-sufficient,
Hurst said he was "not sure we will
have that much time."
And, Hurst said, "If we can't do it
(become self-sufficient), we're toast."
Sheryl Johnson, coach of the field
hockey team, said she did not know
what the Athletic Department "plans to
do with us."
According to Johnson, the field

hockey team has only been allocated a
fraction of what it used to receive. The
Athletic Department provides only
enough funds to cover basic operating
costs such as officiating and confer
ence fees, she said.
Due to the Athletic Department cuts,
the field hockey team has had to raise
funds to purchase new equipment as
well as pay for a trip to the East Coast
to play some of the top-ranked teams
in the nation. In addition, Johnson and
her two assistant coaches work on a vo
luntary basis, she said.
"We have become self-sufficient by
force," Johnson said.
According to wrestling coach Chris
Horpel, the Athletic Department's only
contribution to the wrestling team is to
pay one-third of Horpel's salary. He
added that the University is paying
Horpel the rest of the money called for
by his contract.
"The Athletic Department is paying
no more (to the wrestling program)
than it would have paid if wrestling
had died," Horpel said, noting that the
Athletic Department would have been
obligated to pay his salary for the three
years remaining on his contract
regardless of any budget cuts.
Horpel said the cuts cost the team
AlPAmerica wrestler Dave Lee. Since
the team could no longer afford to pay

assistant coach Dave Schultz, a former
Olympic and world champion
wrestler, he left Stanford for Wiscon
sin, taking Lee with him.
The wrestling team must raise
$36,000 to maintain its current operat
ing budget, Horpel said. Horpel said
he was able to raise $35,000 last year
and was confident the wrestling team
would raise the necessary amount of
money again this year.
The money produced by fund
raising will be sufficient to "have a pro
gram, but it is not good in terms of
having a team that is competitive on
the national level," Horpel said.
"It disturbs me that Andy Geiger
considers wrestling a sport that he may
not continue," he said.
Unlike the other four varsity sports
that had initially been cut from the Ath
letic Department budget, the softball
team has not had its funding restored.
Instead, the team will be classified a
club sport — a decision made by
Geiger.
According to Geiger, he decided not
to classify softball as a varsity sport be
cause of, among other reasons, a lack
of a softball field that meets minimum
standards and the "requisite budget
support that would render us competi
tive" in the Pacific 10 Conference.
"If we felt we could do softball and
do it at the appropriate level, we would
do it," Geiger said.
Although she said she would rather
have "all or no funding," softball coach
Tami Brown said she thought the Ath
letic Department's decision "was un
fair to us."

Team representative Lisa Buchanan
also said the decision to eliminate only
the softball team from the Athletic De
partment budget "looks pretty unfair."
Brown and Buchanan both said the
size of the softball budget was small
compared to the size of the overall Ath
letic Department budget and would
Brown said that as a result of the
softball team's club sport status, she
had to turn "awesome athletes away to
other schools."
The softball team should be able to
fund itself as a club sport, Brown said.
She added that to save money the team
will play mostly in the Bay Area.
Brown and Buchanan both said they
hoped the team would eventually
regain its varsity status.
Geiger said the Stanford community
had shown a strong interest in the re
funding of the sports and that had been
a major reason for adding the field
hockey, wrestling and two fencing
teams to the Athletic Department
budget.
"We did everything we could to
keep them as varsity programs,"
Geiger said.
Hurst agreed with Geiger, saying
that he "believed the key thing" in the
reversal of the University's cuts was the
high level of student interest in the
decision. Hurst said that a petition
signed by students and that was organ
ized by students in his beginning, in
termediate and advanced fencing
classes was "treated with die utmost
respect by the University."
