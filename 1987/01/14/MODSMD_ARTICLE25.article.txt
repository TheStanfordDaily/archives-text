# Globetrotters visit Farm

The following credentials can be found on the resume of
only one group of people.
Performances in front of four Popes, appearances on tele
vision shows ranging from"The Donnie and Marie Show"
to Gilligan's Island," journeys totaling more than four mil
lion miles to places such as Iran and the Ryukyu Islands, an
overall record of 16,039-331, a 15-year winning streak, two
feature Films chronicling their escapades (one starring Sid
ney Poitier), and, well, it would take about a week's worth of
Dailies to give a complete report, so you can imagine the
rest.
Their press guide says their appearance tonight at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion is a continuation of a "60-year
traditon of serious basketball, liberally leavened with
slapstick, trick shots, soaring slam dunks and flashy ball
handling."
They are, of course, the Harlem Globetrotters.
That the team has not lost in 15 years is rather suspect, but
so is the fact that they did not play in Harlem until 1969. That
they make a lot of people, ages 1-111, real happy cannot be
disputed.
The "Magicians of the Court" have been playing Maples
for 15 straight years. The event is arranged by Stanford Club
Sports and is its major annual fundraiser. Tickets will be
available at the gate and range from $7.50 to $10.50.
The Trotters continue to boast the antics of a Clown

Prince and his court, which includes what the press guide
terms "specialists" in all facets of the game from in-your
face jams to rebounding â€” an especially exciting skill to
specialize in. The last year has brought a big change to the
organization: the introduction of a Clown Princess.
Lynette Woodard is the first woman ever to be signed to a
full-time contract with a professional men's basketball team.
Like all her teammates, she was a standout in the amateur
ranks. Woodard captained the 1984 Olympic squad and
joins Wilt Chamberlain on the short list of former University
of Kansas Ail-Americans who have also played for basket
ball's "funsters."
The Globetrotters are in the middle of their Diamond
Jubilee Tour, celebrating 60 years of "spreading the gospel
of basketball and good times across the continents." The big
star this time around, extending the tradition that includes
such all-time favorites as Inman Jackson, Goose Ausbie and
Meadowlark Lemon, is James "Twiggy" Sanders. Other
nicknames on this edition include "Memphis," "Bobo" and
a not-so-original "Clyde the Glide."
The hapless competition this evening will be the good 'ol
Washington Generals. It would be unwise to put any money
on them.
Also of interest to basketball fans will be that Saturday's
much-awaited confrontation between Stanford and Califor
nia is a complete sell-out. The 3:05 p.m. game will be broad
cast from Cal's Harmon "Arena" by KZSU and KCBS and will
be televised by RavCom on Channel 5.
