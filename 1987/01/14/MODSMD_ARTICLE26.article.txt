### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
The long-expected report by the
Task Force to Study Fraternities and
Sororities at Stanford should appear
soon, University administrators an
nounced last night at a meeting of the
Alumni Interfraternity Council (IFCY
While Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano and Assistant to the President
Bob Hamrdla told Alumni IFC mem
bers that release of the report "is
forthcoming," they would not specify
when exactly the report will appear.
But after the meeting, assistant dean
of Residential Education Diana Conklin
said task force members have been
working on the final draft of the report
and expect to release it to James Lyons,
dean of Student Affairs, early this quar
ter.
The Task Force to Study Fraternities
and Sororities at Stanford was formed
in January 1984 and disbanded six
months later. Composed of students,
faculty and staff members, the task
force recommended that Stanford
deny self-selective fraternal organiza
tions housing privileges, though it did
not recommend refusing recognition.
Alumni IFC members expressed

concern that Lyons was holding on to
the final draft of the report and would
not release it until shortly before fra
ternity Rush in the Spring.
"It's been proven that negative infor
mation released before Rush hurts
Rush," Zeta Psi Alumni Representative
Brian Avery said. Though the recom
mendation of the task force is already
known, Avery questioned how release
of the report right before Rush would
be seen by freshmen who were not
here when the task fiorce originally an
nounced its recommendation.
"The timing of the issuance of the
report — which is clearly ready to be
issued — is a matter of great impor
tance" to fraternity alumni, Kappa
Sigma Alumni Representative Dave El
lison told Pisano at the meeting. El
lison and other members of the
Alumni IFC asked Pisano to relay their
concern to Lyons.
According to Conklin, Lyons has not
yet seen the final report, and he will
probably release it soon after he views
it himself.
"I feel confident that he will be as
eager to release it as he was to receive
it," Conklin said.
