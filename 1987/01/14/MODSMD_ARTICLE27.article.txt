### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
A California appellate court ruling involving the Stan
ford History Department has broad implications for the
issue of academic freedom, according to administrators
and professors interviewed yesterday.
Iris Brest, one of the Stanford attorneys involved in the
case, said that the decision to deny a former visiting pro
fessor access to what was said about him at a History De
partment meeting was a "very important ruling" for the
peer review process — the method by which University
departments determine tenure and other faculty ap
pointments.
The 6th Court of Appeals ruled Friday that former
Visiting Prof. Norman Davies does not have the right to
take a deposition from History Prof. Harold Kahn, who
Davies claims made "false and derogatory statements
about him" during a Jan. 15, 1986, History Department
tenure meeting.
Davies filed a $3.1 million lawsuit last May after he was
denied appointment to the vacant McDonnell Chair of
East European History by a 12-11 vote of the History De
partment faculty. Davies, an expert in Polish history, al
leged that Kahn persuaded the faculty to deny the ap
pointment, causing damage to his professional reputa
tion.
Kahn called the decision "a vindication of the limited
privilege of confidentiality for peer review."
Law Prof. John Kaplan said that it would have been dif

ficult for Davies to win a lawsuit because the kind of
libel he's complaining about is so close to opinion."
"If (Davies) is accused of a crime, that's not an
opinion. If (the History Department faculty) say he's a
bad scholar, that's their opinion," he said.
Kaplan said the decision on the deposition may make
it less likely that professors denied tenure or an appoint
ment in the future will win suits, but said, "It's such an
unusual case it's hard to say how much the principle will
be followed."
According to Kaplan, without the desposition it will be
"more difficult for Davies to win his lawsuit.'
In its decision, the court conceded that without access
to the discussion, Davies' "ability to seek redress will be
impaired."
The suit was dismissed from Superior Court on a
demurrer — the court ruled that even if Davies proved
all of his allegations he could not win a ruling.
"All the things he said were libelous are constitution
ally protected," Brest said.
Davies sought the deposition from Kahn in an effort to
rebuild his suit.
Kahn asked the appellate court for a peremptory writ
of mandate to prevent the deposition from being taken
and thus guarantee the confidentiality of what was said at
the History Department meeting.
The court ruled that a candidate for an academic ap
pointment or tenure is not "entitled to discover the votes
cast, the underlying motivation and the comments made
during the meeting."
