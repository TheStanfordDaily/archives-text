# Fund cut closes 2 SLAC facilities

Federal budget cuts have forced the
Stanford Linear Accelerater Center
(SLAC) to shut down operation of two
atom-smashing machines, hampering
the research of several hundred scien
tists from more than 30 universities.
According to Charles Prescott, direc
tor of SLAC's research division, since
the government cutbacks came with
out substantial warning, SLAC was
unable to adjust its long-range
schedule to accomodate the monetary
restrictions and had to resort to shut
ting down the two machines to com
plete construction of the Stanford
Linear Collider (SLC).
The two dormant machines — one
of which helped to win a Nobel Prize
in 1976 — are known as PEP (Positron-
Electron Project) and SPEAR (Stanford
Positron-Electron Asymmetric Ring).
SLAC's $200 million worth of equip
ment is designed for the research of
elementary partical physics — the ex
amination of the structure of the nu
cleus of an atom. The lab is owned by
the federal government, and thus the
funding for its research is dictated by
the amount allocated to it in the
federal budget.
It has taken three years and $113
million to build the SLC. The new ma
chine was originally supposed to open
this month, but the opening has been
delayed until March. Even then, it will
open only in a limited capacity due to
financial restrictions.
The SLC, when finished, "will give us
the most exotic research facility that
exists in the world," said SLAC Director
of Personnel Doug Dupen.
The budget cuts have resulted in "a
lot of unhappy researchers around
here," according to Prescott. He ex
plained that approximately 400 scien
tists from 35 universities use the SIAC
facilities.
"This is not a crisis for SIAC alone,"
Prescott said. "It is a nationwide prob
lem."
The cutback problem is not unique
to SLAC either. A similar lab, the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory in
Batavia, 111., near Chicago faced a
similar problt-m and was forced to lay
off personnel in order to run its $400
million collider.
The federal cutbacks on research
funds are the result of a congressional
effort to reduce the budget, Dupen ex
plained.
"It's not just tough on Stanford, it's
tough on the scientific community
throughout the United States," said
Dupen He added that as a result of the
budget constraints, new research at
SLAC must remain at a standstill with
scientists analyzing data from past ex
periments.
Scientists at SLAC are currently
"dismayed that we're not doing as
much research as we'd like to, but (that
feeling is) counterbalanced by (the
feeling that) we're very excited about
the new machine," Dupen said
Representatives for SI.AC are cur
rently lobbying in Washington, D C., in
the hope of receiving more federal
