# Hoover director's remarks in dispute
## Campbell cites Reagan connection 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Remarks by Director W. Glenn
Campbell in the Hoover Institution's
1986 Annual Report are a blatant dis
play of partisan politics and a violation
of a university's proper role, according
to critics of the think tank.
But University officials say
Carfffiheirs remarks on the Hoover
center and the Reagan library are only
personal opinion and are not repre
sentative of official policy at Stanford
or Hoover.
Campbell, who has served as direc
tor since 1960, wrote: "With the offer
on a 30-0 vote by the Stanford Univer
sity Board of Trustees to President
Reagan to locate his Presidential Li
brary at Stanford 'in affiliation with the
Hoover Institution' and the president s

acceptance of that offer, it is not only
the Hoover Institution that can boast of
a 'Reagan connection,' but also the
entire University."
Critics claim Campbell's comments
in the report also appear to reflect a
disparity in viewpoints between the
University and the Hoover Institution
over the role of the Reagan Library.
"There is a terrible lack of commu
nication (between Hoover and the Uni
vefsftyT, said English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz. "It's an enormous embarass
ment for the University."
James Rosse, acting president of the
University, said the preface is
Campbell's personal view: "It certainly
does not represent my point of view,"
Rosse said."l don't think it fundamen
tally represents Glenn Campbell's
point of view either."
He said Campbell genuinely sees
Hoover as a valuable academic
resource, not as a partisan center.
In the report, Campbell, who is cur
rently on sabbatical, wrote that Hoover
scholars "have greatly influenced the
new policy agenda," and he praised
various senior fellows who have advo
cated the Strategic Defense Intiative,
tax cuts, business deregulation, and
reform of social welfare programs and
affirmative action.
Hoover critics said Campbell's state
ment cannot be dismissed as personal
opinion. "Glenn Campbell speaks as
head of the Hoover Institution," said
Political Science Prof. John Manley, a
longtime Hoover critic. "To dismiss his
remarks as one opinion ... is to ignore
what he says."
Manley said: "My reaction to
Campbell's comments is that he is ab
solutely right. The existence of Hoover
and of the Reagan Library does estab
lish a Reagan connection (at Stanford).
"The refusal to discuss this from
(University President Donald) Ken
nedy on down is disturbing at a univer
sity. At a university you're supposed to
discuss things with candor."
Rebholz said the structure of Hoover

gives Campbell "the power of hiring
and firing" and makes it difficult to dis
miss his preface as personal opinion.
Campbell's preface also stated:
"There is, of course, no control what
soever exercised over the freedom of
inquiry of Hoover scholars. The
Hoover Institution does not take policy
positions, and scholars are free to
write, speak and testify on any policy
matter."
In the report Campbell character
ized divisions between the University
and Hoover in the past as infringe
ments on Hcxwer's academic freedom.
"The attacks against the Hoover Institu
tion and its scholars, which increas
ingly and publicly were bringing Stan
ford's commitment to academic
freedom into question, have substan
tially subsided," he wrote.
"I suspect he put it in there to bait us
a bit," said Rosse, referring to
Campbell's analysis.
He said Hoover's ambitious fund
raising goals, from $60 to a $100 mil
lion, may drive Campbell to make an
appeal to the politics of potential
donors.
Rosse said the Hoover center under
Campbell has grown into an important
academic resource. "To not give him
credit for that would be foolish," he
said.
Campbell has always worked suc
cessfully "by creating an opposition,"
he added.
