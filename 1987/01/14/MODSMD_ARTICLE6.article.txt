# ASSU Senate approves Jackson funding
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
At its meeting last night, the ASSU Senate
cleared the way for Jesse Jackson's visit to the
campus tomorrow by passing budget modifica
tions of the Speakers Bureau and the Black Stu
dent Union (BSU) that were needed to finance
Jackson's 18,000 honorarium and his traveling ex
penses.
A representative of the Student Athletic Com
mittee (SAC) also discussed his committee's ef
forts to evaluate the Athletic Department's
budgetary problems, and Senator Jake Madden
presented the concept of a community service
theme house during the meeting.
The Speakers Bureau is contributing $5,100 to
Jackson's visit, while the BSU will spend $4,350
on the event.
Members of the Asian American Student Associ
ation (AASA) and the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) were among several
minority organizations that came to the meeting

in a demonstration of community support for
Jackson's visit.
According to BSU chair Amanda Kemp, the BSU
is honored that Jackson has decided to speak at
the University on the 20th anniversary of Martin
Luther King Jr.'s death.
In a letter that Kemp submitted to the senate,
she stated: "Because of his international standing
and national prominence, a program featuring
Jesse Jackson is an extraordinary way to show our
commitment to King's dream." According to
BSU member Steve Philips: "Jackson is to the '80s
what King was to the '605.... He is without ques
tion the pre-eminent black leader in America
today."
Organizers said all 1,200 student seats for the
event were distributed by 12:15 p.m. yesterday,
barely an hour after distribution began.
In other news, George Pegelow, chief instruc
tor of Kenpo Karate and chairman of SAC said that
his committee will seek to aid the Athletic Depart
ment in its efforts to remain both fiscally sound
and capable of satisfying the broad spectrum of
athletic interests in the University community.

Inflation and the increased costs of NCAA pro
gramming are some of the causes of the prob
lems, Pegelow said.
Pegelow said the Athlethic Department's finan
cial troubles are a community problem because
the department plays a central role in University
life. A SAC survey of Stanford students in 1977
revealed that students view "athletic participation
or physical activity equal to or at a level near the
importance of academics," he said.
SAC hopes to present a report on the Athletic
Department's status by late spring, Pegelow said.
He added that the committee has enlisted the aid
of Engineering Prof. Ron Howard, an interna
tional expert in decision analysis, and a host of
renowned attorneys for the in-depth study.
Last March, the Athletic Department initially cut
the field hockey team, men's and women's fen
cing, wrestling and the Softball teams from its
budget, citing financial constraints. The depart
ment eventually restored all the teams but Softball
to the budget. The Softball team currently par
ticipates at the club sport level. (See storv on page

SAC will have an open meeting at Tresidder on
Thursday, Jan. 20 to discuss the issue. Pegelow
also said Athletic Director Andy Geiger will meet
with SAC representatives sometime next week.
In other news, Senator Jake Madden presented
the concept of a community service theme house
to the senate.
Madden said that the theme house would serve
a different function than the Public Service Center
at Owen House. That center is a clearing-house
for community service opportunities at the Uni
versity, he said, adding that it contains student
offices and performs administrative tasks.
The new theme house will be a place where
students actively involved in community service
can gather, talk to professors with similar inter
ests and find a supportive atmosphere.
The new house would sponsor academic proj
ects as well, Madden said.
ASSU senators plan to discuss the issue at dor
mitories as part of the community outreach pro
gram.
The deadline for new proposals on theme
houses is Feb, 2.
