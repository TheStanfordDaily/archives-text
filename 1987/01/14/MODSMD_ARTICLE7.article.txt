# Geiger decries drug testing
## 
### JULIE LOUGHRAN 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said
yesterday that he was "appalled with
the drug testing methodology"
employed during the NCAA drug test
ing of Stanford football players last
month.
Geiger said he was "unhappy and
have been unhappy with the privacy is
sues. ... One of the great values in ath
letics is that of shared responsibility
and mutual trust."
He further maintained that values on
the collegiate level should be taught
rather than tested. "Testing for these
things is to admit failure before the
fact."
Geiger made his remarks in a
presentation to the monthly public
meeting of the Stanford Mothers Club
at the Bechtel International Center.
He also expressed concern over the
testing of only a small percentage of
the population, namely varsity athletes,
and predicted many challenges to the
NCAA policy. "It may be that testing
will be necessary in this society and it

may be that athletics is the bat
tleground on which this will be fought
... but I think it is necessary for us to
have a series of tests in the courts to
decide how, when and where it's ap
propriate to test and how much of a
public spectacle it should be."
In order to educate all the individ
uals involved in the Athletic Depart
ment on the drug issue, Geiger said he
and Paul Walters, the director of the
Cowell Student Health Center, were
"trying to develop lecture series and
seminars for the students done by
people who are experts on drugs and
what bad things they do and why
they're not proper.'' Walters is also
chairman of the Committee for Sports
Medicine.
In addition, Geiger addressed the
financial constraints facing? the athletics
program. The Athletics Department,
which presently supports 28 varsity in
tercollegiate teams, will face funding
cuts "unless the Centennial campaign
is able to reinforce what we believe in
as far as athletics are concerned.'

The department will seek endow
ment of scholarship aid and coaching
chairs in addition to funds for a $15
million renovation of campus athletic
facilities, including the Encina Gym-'
nasium.
Geiger emphasized that potential
budget cuts would be made through
out the department as a whole, even
though greater revenues are earned
through the men's athletic programs
and traditional gender-separate fund
raising.
"It's time for us to look at gender
separate funding and try to unite it. We
have more programs than resources.
We'll have to cut across the board if we
have to cut," he said.
Geiger concluded his presentation
by answering questions concerning
present relations with the Stanford
Band in light of his conflicts with the
organization earlier in the year.
Geiger said he "felt very pleased and
very proud of the response of the
band, particularly the leaders." He also
expressed a desire to work more
closely with the Band in the future.
