Worker charged in hotel fire
A longtime maintenance worker at San Juan's Dupont Plaza Hotel was ar
rested yesterday and charged with 96 counts of murder in connection with
the New Year's Eve fire that killed 96 people and injured 140.
Hector Aponte, 35, was identified as a member of the Teamsters local at
the hotel, which had taken a strike vote in the hotel ballroom minutes
before the fire broke out there at 2:30 p.m. EST.
Meanwhile a U.S. Fire Administration official said a door that opened in
ward at the casino, where all but two of the victims died, made it "virtually
impossible" for gamblers to flee the rapidly moving fire.
He said the San Juan fire followed a "predictable" path and is an exam
ple of "what can happen when an ordinary fire starts in a structure with no
detectors, no functioning alarms and no sprinklers."
Stephen Higgins, director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (BATF) that investigated the fire with the Federal Bureau of Inves
tigation, the Fire Administration and Puerto Rican authorities, said Monday
that Escudero Aponte started the fire with a "Sterno-type fuel can" and that
he spread the flammable substance in several areas of the ballroom.
Sterno is an alcohol-based fuel used for cooking. Andrew Vita, super
visor of the BATF National Response Team, which conducted the investiga
tion at the fire scene, said the fuel apparently was spread among some 91
cardboard crates full of new furniture — beds, sofas, lamps and dressers —
delivered the day before.
Regan secure as chief of staff
WASHINGTON — White House chief of staff Donald Regan, whose hold
on his job seemed tenuous two weeks ago, is now secure in his position
and moving to fill key White House vacancies with his personal choices, ac
cording to administration and Republican sources.
"Regan didn't want to make any moves while he was fighting for his own
survival," a senior White House official said. "Now that he's fought off the
demands for his resignation, he is putting his own stamp on the place."
On Monday, Regan's choice for White House spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, was named to succeed Larry Speakes. Yesterday, White House
sources said that Regan will select a domestic policy director within the
next few days, filling a post vacant since Jack Svahn resigned last Septem
ber.
White House sources said John Cogan, who was an Office of Manage
ment and Budget deputy under David Stockman and now is a top official
with the conservative Hoover Institution, has met with Regan and is the
leading candidate for this post.
Two White House officials said they also expect White House communi
cations director Patrick Buchanan to leave, possibly to launch a bid for the
Republican presidential nomination. One of these officials said that Regan
is displeased with Buchanan's attempt to blame the news media and
Congress for damage suffered by President Reagan because of the Iran
contra controversy.
"There would certainly be no objection from Regan if Buchanan decided
to leave, but no one is going to ask him to leave," a White House official
said. "The timing of the departure is up to Pat."
Another White House official said of Buchanan, "We assume he's on the
way out the door, but he hasn't made a move yet." If Buchanan leaves,
Regan is expected to fill the vacancy with his deputy, Dennis Thomas.
Internal feud surfaces in China
PEKING — Evidence is mounting in China that a group of conservative
Communist Party, security and military leaders under the leadership of
party veteran Peng Zhen has mounted a significant internal challenge to
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
The conservative forces have pressured or induced the Chinese regime
to make an abrupt and dramatic change of direction. From now on the
Communist Party will behave strictly like an orthodox Leninist party. All
members will be required to adhere to party doctrine and to follow the or
ders of the leadership.
Discussion by some reformers and intellectuals about the right to dis
sent and about the importance of checks and balances on the power of the
party has been abandoned. Chinese newspapers that aired new ideas last
year are being told to operate once again like conventional propaganda or
gans.
It appears that the powerful conservative forces are willing to continue
to go along for now with Deng in his market-oriented economic reform
program and open-door policy — so long as Deng reins in those party
leaders who wanted to decentralize the operations of the party and to grant
some new freedom to intellectuals.
Deng remains China's leader, but the authority of some of his senior
aides who sought political reform is now in doubt. And the official line and
policies now being put forth by the party from day to day are largely those
of Peng Zhen and the conservatives.
Iraq steps up strikes on Iran
BAGHDAD, Iraq — The Iraqi military stepped up its air strikes against
Iranian cities yesterday as fighting spread along the southern war front on
the fifth day of a major Iranian ground offensive near Basra, Iraq's second
largest city.
An Iraqi war communique issued yesterday night said that the Iranians
had sent more reinforcements across the border and that fighting had
spread to an area south of Fish Lake, some three miles inside Iraqi terri
tory. Previously, that area was reported by the Iraqis to have been cleared
of Iranian positions.
The communique added, however, that the new attack had been
repelled and the area again "wiped clean" of Iranian troops.
Military spokesmen said, meanwhile, that Iraqi planes bombed several
Iranian cities for the fourth consecutive day, hitting Qom, Khorammabad,
Esfahan, Dezful and Kermanshah with "devastating" strikes.
Iraqi officials said that the air strikes against Iranan cities were in retalia
tion for an Iranian missile attack on Baghdad early yesterday morning. The
missile, the second to strike the Iraqi capital in two days, fell in an area far
from the trade center that the Iranians said was its intended target and
"killed and wounded a number of people," an Iraqi military spokesman
said.
The so-called "war of the cities," in which each side aims to sow terror
by attacking the other's population centers, has claimed hundreds of civil
ian lives since it resumed several days ago in the wake of a new Iranian of
fensive aimed at Basra, 300 miles from Baghdad in southeastern Iraq.
Soviets replace arms negotiator
MOSCOW — Yuli Vorontsov, a top diplomat with close ties to the Krem
lin high command, was named yesterday as chief Soviet negotiator for the
new round of arms control talks with the United States in Geneva.
Selection of Vorontsov, 5 7 , who has spent 18 years in New York and
Washington, was welcomed by U.S. Embassy officials.
Vorontsov replaces Viktor Karpov, 58, the Soviet Union's most experi
enced negotiator. It was Karpov who headed the Moscow delegation at the
successful talks on the second strategic arms limitation treaty in 1978.
Karpov, who heads a Foreign Ministry department on arms control and
disarmament, ranks below Vorontsov and has been in the same relatively
specialized field for almost all of his diplomatic career.
A senior Western diplomat suggested recently that Moscow would have
to have a higher-level negotiator on the Soviet team if it wanted to make
any headway in the bogged-down Geneva talks
Vorontsov is one of four first deputy foreign ministers. He has close ties
to Anatolv Dobrynin, the former ambassador to Washington who now runs
the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party.
Western diplomats said that Vorontsov was regarded by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev as the kind of flexible and imaginative diplomat that he
prefers to the Mr Nyet' stereotype personified by former Foreign Mini
ster Andrei Gromvko

Regan is expected to fill the vacancy with his deputy, Dennis Thomas.
Internal feud surfaces in China
PEKING — Evidence is mounting in China that a group of conservative
Communist Party, security and military leaders under the leadership of
party veteran Peng Zhen has mounted a significant internal challenge to
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
The conservative forces have pressured or induced the Chinese regime
to make an abrupt and dramatic change of direction. From now on the
Communist Party will behave strictly like an orthodox Leninist party. All
members will be required to adhere to party doctrine and to follow the or
ders of the leadership.
Discussion by some reformers and intellectuals about the right to dis
sent and about the importance of checks and balances on the power of the
party has been abandoned. Chinese newspapers that aired new ideas last
year are being told to operate once again like conventional propaganda or
gans.
It appears that the powerful conservative forces are willing to continue
to go along for now with Deng in his market-oriented economic reform
program and open-door policy — so long as Deng reins in those party
leaders who wanted to decentralize the operations of the party and to grant
some new freedom to intellectuals.
Deng remains China's leader, but the authority of some of his senior
aides who sought political reform is now in doubt. And the official line and
policies now being put forth by the party from day to day are largely those
of Peng Zhen and the conservatives.
Iraq steps up strikes on Iran
BAGHDAD, Iraq — The Iraqi military stepped up its air strikes against
Iranian cities yesterday as fighting spread along the southern war front on
the fifth day of a major Iranian ground offensive near Basra, Iraq's second
largest city.
An Iraqi war communique issued yesterday night said that the Iranians
had sent more reinforcements across the border and that fighting had
spread to an area south of Fish Lake, some three miles inside Iraqi terri
tory. Previously, that area was reported by the Iraqis to have been cleared
of Iranian positions.
The communique added, however, that the new attack had been
repelled and the area again "wiped clean" of Iranian troops.
Military spokesmen said, meanwhile, that Iraqi planes bombed several
Iranian cities for the fourth consecutive day, hitting Qom, Khorammabad,
Esfahan, Dezful and Kermanshah with "devastating" strikes.
Iraqi officials said that the air strikes against Iranan cities were in retalia
tion for an Iranian missile attack on Baghdad early yesterday morning. The
missile, the second to strike the Iraqi capital in two days, fell in an area far
from the trade center that the Iranians said was its intended target and
"killed and wounded a number of people," an Iraqi military spokesman
said.
The so-called "war of the cities," in which each side aims to sow terror
by attacking the other's population centers, has claimed hundreds of civil
ian lives since it resumed several days ago in the wake of a new Iranian of
fensive aimed at Basra, 300 miles from Baghdad in southeastern Iraq.
Soviets replace arms negotiator
MOSCOW — Yuli Vorontsov, a top diplomat with close ties to the Krem
lin high command, was named yesterday as chief Soviet negotiator for the
new round of arms control talks with the United States in Geneva.
Selection of Vorontsov, 5 7 , who has spent 18 years in New York and
Washington, was welcomed by U.S. Embassy officials.
Vorontsov replaces Viktor Karpov, 58, the Soviet Union's most experi
enced negotiator. It was Karpov who headed the Moscow delegation at the
successful talks on the second strategic arms limitation treaty in 1978.
Karpov, who heads a Foreign Ministry department on arms control and
disarmament, ranks below Vorontsov and has been in the same relatively
specialized field for almost all of his diplomatic career.
A senior Western diplomat suggested recently that Moscow would have
to have a higher-level negotiator on the Soviet team if it wanted to make
any headway in the bogged-down Geneva talks
Vorontsov is one of four first deputy foreign ministers. He has close ties
to Anatolv Dobrynin, the former ambassador to Washington who now runs
the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party.
Western diplomats said that Vorontsov was regarded by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev as the kind of flexible and imaginative diplomat that he
prefers to the Mr Nyet' stereotype personified by former Foreign Mini
ster Andrei Gromvko

Worker charged in hotel fire
A longtime maintenance worker at San Juan's Dupont Plaza Hotel was ar
rested yesterday and charged with 96 counts of murder in connection with
the New Year's Eve fire that killed 96 people and injured 140.
Hector Aponte, 35, was identified as a member of the Teamsters local at
the hotel, which had taken a strike vote in the hotel ballroom minutes
before the fire broke out there at 2:30 p.m. EST.
Meanwhile a U.S. Fire Administration official said a door that opened in
ward at the casino, where all but two of the victims died, made it "virtually
impossible" for gamblers to flee the rapidly moving fire.
He said the San Juan fire followed a "predictable" path and is an exam
ple of "what can happen when an ordinary fire starts in a structure with no
detectors, no functioning alarms and no sprinklers."
Stephen Higgins, director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (BATF) that investigated the fire with the Federal Bureau of Inves
tigation, the Fire Administration and Puerto Rican authorities, said Monday
that Escudero Aponte started the fire with a "Sterno-type fuel can" and that
he spread the flammable substance in several areas of the ballroom.
Sterno is an alcohol-based fuel used for cooking. Andrew Vita, super
visor of the BATF National Response Team, which conducted the investiga
tion at the fire scene, said the fuel apparently was spread among some 91
cardboard crates full of new furniture — beds, sofas, lamps and dressers —
delivered the day before.
Regan secure as chief of staff
WASHINGTON — White House chief of staff Donald Regan, whose hold
on his job seemed tenuous two weeks ago, is now secure in his position
and moving to fill key White House vacancies with his personal choices, ac
cording to administration and Republican sources.
"Regan didn't want to make any moves while he was fighting for his own
survival," a senior White House official said. "Now that he's fought off the
demands for his resignation, he is putting his own stamp on the place."
On Monday, Regan's choice for White House spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, was named to succeed Larry Speakes. Yesterday, White House
sources said that Regan will select a domestic policy director within the
next few days, filling a post vacant since Jack Svahn resigned last Septem
ber.
White House sources said John Cogan, who was an Office of Manage
ment and Budget deputy under David Stockman and now is a top official
with the conservative Hoover Institution, has met with Regan and is the
leading candidate for this post.
Two White House officials said they also expect White House communi
cations director Patrick Buchanan to leave, possibly to launch a bid for the
Republican presidential nomination. One of these officials said that Regan
is displeased with Buchanan's attempt to blame the news media and
Congress for damage suffered by President Reagan because of the Iran
contra controversy.
"There would certainly be no objection from Regan if Buchanan decided
to leave, but no one is going to ask him to leave," a White House official
said. "The timing of the departure is up to Pat."

MOSCOW — Yuli Vorontsov, a top diplomat with close ties to the Krem
lin high command, was named yesterday as chief Soviet negotiator for the
new round of arms control talks with the United States in Geneva.
Selection of Vorontsov, 5 7 , who has spent 18 years in New York and
Washington, was welcomed by U.S. Embassy officials.
Vorontsov replaces Viktor Karpov, 58, the Soviet Union's most experi
enced negotiator. It was Karpov who headed the Moscow delegation at the
successful talks on the second strategic arms limitation treaty in 1978.
Karpov, who heads a Foreign Ministry department on arms control and
disarmament, ranks below Vorontsov and has been in the same relatively
specialized field for almost all of his diplomatic career.
A senior Western diplomat suggested recently that Moscow would have
to have a higher-level negotiator on the Soviet team if it wanted to make
any headway in the bogged-down Geneva talks
Vorontsov is one of four first deputy foreign ministers. He has close ties
to Anatolv Dobrynin, the former ambassador to Washington who now runs
the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party.
Western diplomats said that Vorontsov was regarded by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev as the kind of flexible and imaginative diplomat that he
prefers to the Mr Nyet' stereotype personified by former Foreign Mini
ster Andrei Gromvko
