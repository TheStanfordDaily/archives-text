# Court upholds maternity law
## Also makes 1986 decision on racial bias in juries retroactive 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
upheld laws requiring employers to provide unpaid
pregnancy leave to employees, ruling that such spe
cial benefits for women do not violate federal civil
rights laws.
The 6-3 decision upheld a California law similar to
statutes in eight other states requiring employers to
give female workers an unpaid preganancy disability
leave of up to four months, guaranteeing that their
jobs will be available when they return.
Lawyers on both sides said the decision in the case,
closely watched by business, labor and civil rights
groups, was certain to spark efforts in other states to
pass similar laws.
The court, in an opinion by Justice Thurgood Mar
shall, rejected arguments by business groups and the
Reagan administration, who said the California law
violated the 1978 Pregnancy Disability Act that said
pregnant workers must be treated the same as, but
not better than, workers with other disabilities. The
contention was that it is discriminatory to require
leave for a pregnant worker when an employer is un
der no obligation to provide leave to a worker with a

broken arm or other disability.
The court agreed with a lower court decision that
Congress did not intend the 1978 act to limit the
benefits for pregnant women. It was, Marshall wrote,
only to be "a floor beneath which pregnancy dis
ability benefits may not drop — not a ceiling above
which they may not rise."
While Congress did not want to force states to give
special treatment to pregnant workers, Marshall said,
it also never "intended to prohibit such
(preferential) treatment."
The case, California Federal Savings and Loan As
sociation v. Guerra, involved Lillian Garland, a recep
tionist at the Los Angeles-based savings and loan who
lost her job after taking three months' pregnancy
leave. State officials charged the bank with violating
the state law and the bank sued to have the law over
turned.
In San Francisco, Garland's attorneys hailed the
decision as "a landmark in establishing equal oppor
tunity in the workplace."
The Supreme Court also handed down a ruling
that could mean new trials for hundreds of blacks

convicted by all-white juries. The court decided that a
1986 decision barring prosecutors from screening
blacks from juries must be applied retroactively to all
cases on trial or under appeal at the time.
Black convicts who were tried last year or whose
cases were on appeal in a federal or state court may
use yesterdays ruling to seek new trials.
The U.S. Supreme Court declared last year that it
would no longer tolerate the common practice of al
lowing prosecutors to remove blacks from juries that
were to hear cases of black defendants. Convicts
were entitled to new trials unless their prosecutors
could show that they removed blacks from their
juries for "neutral" reasons.
"Failure to apply a newly declared constitutional
rule to criminal cases pending on direct review vi
olates the basic norms of constitutional adjudiction,"
said Justice Harry Blackmun for a 6-3 majority. "The
new rule is to be applied retroactively to all cases,
state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet
final. There can be no exceptions."
