SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico â€” A Dupont Plaza Hotel
busboy was charged yesterday with helping a mainte
nance worker start the New Year's Eve fire that killed
96 people at the luxury hotel.
Both longtime hotel employees were in custody
on arson charges as investigators of the fire indicated
more arrests could follow.
"The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms will continue to investigate this case until
we're certain anyone connected with the fire has
been identified and brought to justice," said Jerry
Rudden, a spokesman for the agency.
Another federal investigator, who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity, said, "We're trying to find every
one who was involved. If it was two people we want
them both; if it was 10 people we want all 10."
Armando Jimenez Rivera, a 28-year-old bar bus
boy, was arrested Tuesday and arraigned yesterday
on a charge of arson in U.S. District Court. He was
accused of helping Hector Escudero Aponte, 35, set
fire to the hotel.
Rivera provided Sterno-type fuel that Aponte

placed on a pile of new furniture stacked along a wall
of the hotel's south ballroom, a federal complaint al
leged.
Aponte was charged in federal court Tuesday with
arson and in Puerto Rico District Court with arson,
destruction of property and 96 counts of murder.
Both men, if convicted, face maximum sentences
of life imprisonment. Puerto Rico does not have the
death penalty.
Court documents said the FBI obtained confes
sions from Rivera and Aponte. Federal officials iden
tified the men as members of the Teamsters Union.
The union had adjourned a meeting in the ball
room a few minutes before the fire broke out. At the
meeting, the union rejected a hotel contract offer and
planned to strike at midnight New Year's Eve.
Union leaders have denied any involvement in the
fire.
The federal complaint against Rivera, who the FBI
said worked at the hotel for 10 years, asserted he
gave the fuel to Aponte "and then stood with others
in front of Escudero to block others' view so that Es

cudero could put the Sterno on a stack of boxed
furniture in the south ballroom area.
U.S. Attorney Daniel Lopez Romo would not dis
close where the two men were being held.
Romo said bail for both suspects had been denied
by U.S. District Judge Justo Arenas, who set prelimi
nary' hearings for next Tuesday.
The federal complaint against Aponte said he told
the FBI he went to the hotel at 2 p.m. Dec. 31 to set
fire to "personal property" of the hotel.
Officials say the fire started about 3:20 p.m. in the
ground floor ballroom and sent dense smoke
through the mezzanine level casino and lobby and
the next four floors. Guests and staff raced to the
roof, where they were plucked off by helicopters or
jumped from lower level windows and balconies to
escape the heat and smoke. More than 140 were
injured.
A San Juan newspaper quoted unidentified police
sources as saying Aponte was "emotionally tor
mented" when he confessed to starting the fire.
