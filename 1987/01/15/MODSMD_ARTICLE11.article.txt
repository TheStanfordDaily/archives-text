# Camelot rides again
## 
### 
There was joy in Beantown.
The last tears had dried on the faces of Red
Sox fans, the forlorn moans of all Bostonians
faded into the night air around Fenway Park.
The Tipster was gone now. The final knights
of Camelot had ridden away into the sunset.
But the Cradle of Liberty spawned a new
man. A man of stature. A man who was born to
run for editor.
Michael Newman.
Newman was an Irishman â€” that is to sav, a
hard-drinking womanizer. He carried his Irish
heritage with pride.
Bred from an uneasy liason between the
Puritanism of his native New England and the
liberal mores of his adopted state on the West
Coast, his character combined both the staid
seriousness needed from the leader of the
Peninsula's largest morning paper and the
love of alcohol that allowed him to kick back
and relax once the final page had been rolled.
Sometimes his thick brogue made him vir

tually incomprehensible to his listeners, but
there was no mistaking that he was happy as a
leprechaun on this momentous eve.
"Ahh, yah know it'z aah, it'z aah, a reeel aah
nah to be dah edidaah of dah Daehly," the
proper Bostonian said, sucking pensively on a
rather large bottle of bubbly.
And his mother, Marie, was happy, too.
"Aah, yah know it'z ahh, it'z aah, guhd duh
see that Miichaahl finuhlly made something of
himself," she said, doing a little cha-cha dance
in celebration. "Aah wahz scyahrd that pahaps
he wuz aaah, jaahst doin' druhgs ah sumdin'
oud deah in Caalifonyeah."
As the sun rose above the Cape and slowly
cast its light westward over the Bay State, the
somnolescent citizens of the small, sleepy
town of Dedham, on the outskirts of Boston,
awoke from their slumbers, awoke to a new
hero.
A new leader ... A new knight ... A new
man. Newman.
