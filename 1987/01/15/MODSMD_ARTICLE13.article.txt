### 
Nancy Reagan counsels youngsters to "just say no," but
when Simone LeVant, captain of Stanford's women's
diving team, said no to NCAA drug testing, she was
barred from post-season competition.
Now LeVant is committing herself to the kind of per
sonal crusade this country's leaders usually applaud â€”
she is taking the NCAA to court and charging that the
drug-testing rule violates the California constitution.
Although the Santa Clara County Superior Court on
Tuesday granted a temporary restraining order permit
ting LeVant to compete while the suit is under litigation,
the athlete's refusal to sign the consent form requiring
her to take the drug test forced her to miss two swim
ming meets and threatened to make her miss all other
meets this year.
Ironically, an athlete whose test results are positive is
forced only to miss the NCAA championship meet. The

conscientious objector, however, forfeits an entire
season of competition.
The NCAA's drug-testing rule is not only unfair in this
respect, it is also a violation of privacy. Without proof that
all of the athletes are using steroids or illegal drugs, the
NCAA has given itself the power to take urine samples of
all athletes. A refusal to participate in this embarrassing
drug test, during which an official must watch the athlete
give his or her sample, results not only in doubts of the
athlete's innocence, but also in a more severe punish
ment than if the athlete were guilty of using drugs.
Levant's teammates, as well as the entire Stanford
community, should support her willingness to sacrifice
her time, money and potentially her athletic future to
question the justice of the NCAA's rule. This kind of con
cern on the part of an individual for a rule that affects the
nation's athletes deserves everyone's heartfelt applause.
