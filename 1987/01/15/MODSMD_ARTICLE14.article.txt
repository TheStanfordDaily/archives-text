Arts theme house
needed on Farm
As a member of the committee to
establish an arts theme house, I would
like to respond to The Daily's editorial
entitled "Themes unnecessary."
(Daily, Jan. 14)
The editorial speaks of "Residential
Education's push for theme houses"
and suggests that the new theme
house proposals are Old Union's
imposition on unwitting (and un
declared) students. This is simply not
the case. The arts theme house is a
student idea, and the proposal is
student-written. The Daily suggests
"letting students determine where
they would like to live and what types
of programming they would like to
see." This is exactly what we are trying
to do!
Although The Daily may not be
aware of this, the arts are incredibly
varied and ultimately individual. The
arts theme house will be a residence
for students involved in the perform
ing arts (dance, music, drama), in the
visual arts (painting, sculpture), in
creative writing and in film. I cannot
imagine the existence of 50 artist
clones. Moreover, residents will not
be required to major in these areas.
The house will be a much-needed
opportunity for science and social
science majors to practice their arts.
To head an editorial "Themes
unnecessary" seems to me an unfor
tunate choice of words. If themes are
unnecessary, what is? Vocational
training? It is our contention that the
kind of academic segregation that
exists now should accommodate an
interdisciplinary approach. Regret
tably, the current state of Residential
Education tends to reinforce the
perception that one's education is
limited to a classroom-type experi
ence. Of course, artists learn from
listening to speakers; but they thrive
on contact with other artists. This is
why at least one campus residence
should be a forum for the arts.
It is naive to suggest that the arts
have certain requirements that can be
met by a quota of dorm programming.
Is there any dorm on campus now
that offers: performance/recital space,
practice and work rooms, visiting
artists, master classes, interdisciplinary
and practical seminars, field trips,

unusual films, exhibits, orientation
week programming, a bulletin board
answering machine-LOTS account
listing of resources, and ... 35-50
students making excellent use of these
resources? If the arts theme house
proposal is approved, all these things
(and more!) will be available to stu
dents next year as a living option.
Finally, the editorial contradicts
itself by suggesting that Res Ed could
arrange for speakers to come to
presumably themeless residences.
Whatever happened to student in
volvement? In any case, an arts theme
house would have no trouble drawing
fascinating speakers.
This letter is a call for support from
Stanford student artists. The other
houses with themes of language and
ethnicity already recognize the impor
tance of cultural identity. It's time for
Stanford to recognize artists and the
arts as well.

King's birthday
is important here
Martin Luther King Jr. stood for all
men, regardless of their color. While
most of his words and actions were
directed at the black community, he
was an inspiration to all people. In
particular, Martin Luther King and the
civil rights movement of the 1960s
was a direct inspiration to the Chicano
national movement, which also began
at that time. The black and Chicano
movements were closely linked in that
they shared the same goals of civil
rights, educational access and political
empowerment for their people. These
goals have continued to be important
to blacks and Chicanos, as well as
other oppressed nationalities today.
In the spirit of Martin Luther King,
Jesse Jackson has continued the
struggle for the rights of blacks, as
well as other oppressed people. His
visit at Stanford University today
marks King's birthday and the 20th
anniversary of both Martin Luther
King's visit to Stanford and the Black
Student Union's existence on this
campus. We at MEChA feel this is an
historical event that the entire Stan
ford community should recognize and
celebrate.

King's vision for the equality of all
men is relevant to Stanford today.
Educational institutions are central in
promoting equality, or perpetuating
inequality, within society. Unfortun
ately, the current Western Culture
requirement stands as a glaring exam
ple of Stanford's position in this
regard. Further, Stanford's negligence
in encouraging the study of Third
World people (Afro-Americans,
Chicanos, American Indians and Asian
Americans) is indicative that a change
needs to be made.
The first step in altering Stanford's
current position is clear. History Prof.
Clay Carson's proposed course, cover
ing the experiences and struggles of
Third World people in this country,
would constitute a small but signifi
cant victory for those of us who feel
the Western Culture requirement to
be inadequate. The class would be an
option available to Stanford freshmen
spring quarter and would fulfill the
third-quarter Western Cultures re
quirement. Fittingly, the Faculty Sen
ate will vote today whether to approve
the course. We, at MEChA, fully sup
port the course and the BSU's initia
tive in changing the Western Culture
requirement. We will be closely
watching the outcome of the vote and
urge the senate to approve Prof. Car
son's proposal.
However, this is not enough. For
Stanford to make a commitment to Dr.
King's dream and to play a role in
promoting equality in society, it must
take initiative in re-evaluating the
Western Culture and distribution
requirements. Courses emphasizing
Third World cultures need to be
better integrated into the Stanford
curriculum. Specifically, courses such
as Chicano Studies (i.e. "Chicano Life
and Culture") should be included in
the existing distribution requirements
so as to provide students with a truly
diverse educational experience.
January 15,1987, will be remem
bered as an important date in Stanford
history. Not only will it mark the visit
of Jesse Jackson, King's birthday and
the BSU's anniversary, it may also
mark the day that Stanford took the
first step toward recognizing the
important contributions of Third
World people.
