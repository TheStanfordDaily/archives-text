# Youth need new spiritual strength
## 
### 
What are the real problems facing our students,
now and after they graduate? I don't think nuclear
war, apartheid or salaries are what they should be
most worried about. Rather, they should worry about
the alarming suicide rate among the young, the gen
eral emptiness that we learn from that, as well as
from serious studies such as "Habits of the Heart."
Having spent the last few months in France, which
is going through a grave social crisis that will surely
wash onto our shores, I became aware of the follow
ing: There were 12,000 suicides last year — more
deaths than in car accidents! — mostly among the
young; the use of drugs was widespread, tran
quilizers were epidemic. People who were close to
me and had children told me of the "anguish" haunt
ing them. What has happened?

Clearly, there have been rising expectations there
as here: French wages doubled since World War 11.
But now a liberal economic climate has brought
home the realities of survival. Global competition
has made the industrial prospects grim indeed Last
fall the St. Nazaire shipyard closed down. The steel
mills had already succumbed to these hard facts.
What will be left? There is a sort of Silicon Valley in
the French southeast, but there is one in almost every
country now One doubts that ingenuity and hus
tling will bail us out of a massive mess of the kind
that comes around every so often.
Meanwhile, the old props had gone — solid home,
presence of mother or extended family, religion
(only 16 percent go to Church now), even the elan vi
tal subtly provided by a rising birthrate and an un

sullied nature.... On the other hand the kids were
sapped by rock, sex, drugs, endless TV. As here, they
were flattered and spoiled, merely to get rid of them.
If they didn't make it into the difficult gratides ecoles
or didn't get bachelor's degrees in science and tech
nology, they were dumped into degraded humanistic
programs where 40 percent mostly loafed.
When the Chirac government tried to introduce
competition, "selection," among the schools and stu
dents, the kids couldn't face that and went out into
the streets, backed by their fearful parents. The gov
ernment jellied and caved in. That unleashed all the
other anxious elements of French society, and the
current wave of crippling strikes began: Billions are
lost, which the French can ill afford. And where can
it lead?
We had trouble getting out; it took some hustle
and luck to force my wife and myself, with four
suitcases, onto a train already jammed full: no ticket
takers, everybody for himself, standing all the way to
Paris jammed tight. It reminded us of the war. On the
platform, thronged like in India, I chatted with some
folks while waiting, including a couple of young
American missionaries with flocks of kids and weak
spoken French, heading for an Africa that is literally
dying of AIDS, as the papers reliably reported. And
those young guys were totally, admirably, unfazed!
On the other hand, the French crowd, as the train ap
proached, fell into dramatic silence. Their dream, it
seems, was collapsing as it did in the terrible '40s.
I suppose that most of the kids here would laugh at
those missionaries, as they have been taught to do on
this campus. But I recall that once there was belief in
this land; the Christians believed in free will and total
responsibility for one's acts and one's "salvation."
The students believed that some things were better

than others, and sometimes were willing to risk their
lives to achieve excellence, which they witnessed in
the great artists. The parents, like the British, had
standards, and said, "That isn't done." Eleanor
Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, anybody with a sense
of honor and dignity, spoke that way. Great things
were accomplished.
And then what? The youth were told that heroism
and elitism were finished. One person's view was as
good as another, for example, in interpreting a work.
So why struggle? Just stick together in the peer group
and even AIDS may go away. No need for morality.
Money is more important than raising children.
Youth has a strength that can make the inner weak
ness that goes with the above follies and abdications.
Look at a bunch of adolescents laughing together,
and you would never guess at the terror that can be
in their hearts (I have heard their intimate con
fidences at four-in-the-morning bull-sessions when I
got close to them) and the dislike they often have of
each other, the utter solitude and emptiness that
everybody knows is their inner truth in this irrespon
sible society. Sensitive writers in France detailed this
about the French kids, and I recognized the authen
ticity of their accents.
In some ways, I feel remote from the new genera
tions, as I indicated, but still the young are all our
children and our future. I do not like the idea of their
dying young, or being so ill-prepared to face a
looming grim reality, or losing their creativity. 1 want
them to make it I do not specify how, but one way or
another, they must find their way to the sources of
spiritual strength Before it is too late
