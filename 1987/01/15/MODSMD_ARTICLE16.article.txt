# Racism persists in America
## 
### 
Racism. We hear about it, but do we understand it, and
what can we actually do about it? With the upcoming King
holiday, the Stanford community is sure to get a dose of
what has been done in the effort toward racial equality and
what still needs to be done. But it is no longer enough just
to hear that it exists and must be eradicated. We must under
stand why a cry of racism is every bit as serious as it was 20,
30, or even 50, years ago.

JOSEPH E. GREEN II

Racism persists because a vast majority of white America
continues to be held in the grip of racist ideology. This is
not to suggest that white Americans are the only ones har
boring racist ideals, for there are plenty of so-called
minorities holding racist beliefs. But since white Americans
are in the majority, they must become more aware of how
racism continues adversely to affect American society.
Minority people in America must participate in this awaken
ing by realizing the constraints it has placed upon ourselves
and our subsequent views of the world.
The racism that is significant in America does not denote
violent bigotry stemming from an intense hatred or even
the notion that a differing race is inferior. Racism in modern
America is expressed more out of an ignorance that perpet
uates itself through a belief system based upon reoccurring
stereotypes and misconceptions.
We are constantly bombarded with messages stating how
far we have come. For we now live in a country that has
shown us that a black man can run for president, black
children and white children can be educated side by side,
and black families can exist peacefully in predominantly
white neighborhoods. So most of us would like to believe
that our intrinsic social circles are not influenced by racist
ideology. But, as Stanford educators and students, we are
failing to see how even though significant gains are being
made, American society is still revolving around a racist
belief system.
This evolving system is gradually doing away with or at
least suppressing the standard racism of the past. But it is
creating new traps and injustices of its own. Most of us, due
largely in part to the media, are presented with a fairy-tale
like conception of the status of race relations in the United
States. I mean, after all, the Cosby Show is number one. But
let us examine the reality. It is a reality that will show why
incidents like the one that occurred recently in Howard
Beach are not really all that surprising.
Although many minorities have made significant achieve
ments in America, there are still many obstacles we face. It
would be easy to list some of these obstacles. But we need
to examine what lies behind the statistics. It is not enough
just to say that there are too few black, Asian, Indian or
Hispanic actors in the movies, too few minorities in upper
management positions, fewer black students going to col
lege than 10 years ago, or even that women and minorities
still face frequent job discrimination.
We now live in a society that has mistakenly taken the
"give it time" attitude toward issues dealing with racism.
This is exemplified in how affirmative action programs are
now under attack from all sides. The argument is that affirm
ative action is just another form of discrimination, and some
minorities have even stated that they do not like being cho
sen on the basis of their skin color. But the sad truth is that
America has not come far enough to where a program like
affirmative action is no longer a necessity, although the
results of programs like affirmative action sometimes have
the effect of making it worse for minorities. They lead some

to think that just because they have a few minorities
employed, they do not need to actively seek to hire others.
With this misconception comes the notion that the oppor
tunity to achieve in America is the same for everyone, at
least in regard to skin color. Now that it is illegal to deny
someone access to a particular establishment because of his
skin color, many believe that there is no more racism except
in small little towns where the KKK hang out at the local
bars. We choose to ignore that racially divided neighbor
hoods still exist in the good ole U.S.A., and even more
ridiculous is how even the music industry revolves around
an unspoken racial agreement. Come on, do we award a
Grammy to the best Indonesian artist of the year? The music
industry is a terrific example of how racism is still going
strong in America. I mean, you can have your local Joe sit
there and tell you in all seriousness how a particular group
has "crossed over." I ask, crossed over into what and from
where?
It is sort of like minorities have been told to: "Come on
in, we'll let you achieve. But not too many of you and don't
make waves." This philosophy is like what is going on with
the Western Culture Program at Stanford. A multitude of
minority students and faculty can state that the program is
failing to meet some basic needs, but are met with the atti
tude that is essentially saying: We know what is best for you.
Thus, how long will the Western Culture debate go on? The
answer lies somewhere in the scenario that goes something
like this: Well, we'll let them have their new course, and this
should keep them quiet for a least a year and, if we are
lucky, maybe two. And by then, most of the active students
will have left, and then we will not have to worry about it
anymore.
I ask, if anyone objects to the allegations proposed in this
scenario, why hasn't the University taken more of an initia
tive to solve this debate? One hour-long forum on Western
Culture does not a solution make. And if a new class is
allowed to be set up, are they not admitting that the current
Western Culture Program is failing in some significant
aspect? Are Stanford and other universities failing in some
major way in the manner in which they deal with the fact
that they are indeed predominantly white institutions?
Any response to these questions would undoubtedly in
volve racial beliefs. For are minorities in America just ex
pected to assimilate and not question the circumstances in
volving their assimilation? I do not wish to imply that
minorities in America are somehow not American. I do wish
to imply that notions of what it means to be an American are
going to differ at least slightly from that of a white American.
I mean, I know that I am not going to just decide to run for
president one day and not be concerned about the effect of
my skin color. Look at John F. Kennedy; he ran into trouble
just because of his religion.
Recently, I made the comment that Branner was a white
theme house. I did not mean to say that it is a dorm in which
students gather to rejoice in being white. But rather that it is
a dorm in which students who choose to live in "ethnic"
theme houses would somehow not be most comfortable.
And this is where the problem exists in its most apparent
form. Different cultures are coming from different perspec
tives in America. These are perspectives that are not going
to be united through laws, but rather through actively
seeking to be understood. When we all begin to com
prehend that we need to understand the dilemmas obstruct
ing Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of racial equality, then we
can all equally participate in the dream come true.

answer lies somewhere in the scenario that goes something
like this: Well, we'll let them have their new course, and this
should keep them quiet for a least a year and, if we are
lucky, maybe two. And by then, most of the active students
will have left, and then we will not have to worry about it
anymore.
I ask, if anyone objects to the allegations proposed in this
scenario, why hasn't the University taken more of an initia
tive to solve this debate? One hour-long forum on Western
Culture does not a solution make. And if a new class is
allowed to be set up, are they not admitting that the current
Western Culture Program is failing in some significant
aspect? Are Stanford and other universities failing in some
major way in the manner in which they deal with the fact
that they are indeed predominantly white institutions?
Any response to these questions would undoubtedly in
volve racial beliefs. For are minorities in America just ex
pected to assimilate and not question the circumstances in
volving their assimilation? I do not wish to imply that
minorities in America are somehow not American. I do wish
to imply that notions of what it means to be an American are
going to differ at least slightly from that of a white American.
I mean, I know that I am not going to just decide to run for
president one day and not be concerned about the effect of
my skin color. Look at John F. Kennedy; he ran into trouble
just because of his religion.
Recently, I made the comment that Branner was a white
theme house. I did not mean to say that it is a dorm in which
students gather to rejoice in being white. But rather that it is
a dorm in which students who choose to live in "ethnic"
theme houses would somehow not be most comfortable.
And this is where the problem exists in its most apparent
form. Different cultures are coming from different perspec
tives in America. These are perspectives that are not going
to be united through laws, but rather through actively
seeking to be understood. When we all begin to com
prehend that we need to understand the dilemmas obstruct
ing Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of racial equality, then we
can all equally participate in the dream come true.

Racism. We hear about it, but do we understand it, and
what can we actually do about it? With the upcoming King
holiday, the Stanford community is sure to get a dose of
what has been done in the effort toward racial equality and
what still needs to be done. But it is no longer enough just
to hear that it exists and must be eradicated. We must under
stand why a cry of racism is every bit as serious as it was 20,
30, or even 50, years ago.

JOSEPH E. GREEN II

Racism persists because a vast majority of white America
continues to be held in the grip of racist ideology. This is
not to suggest that white Americans are the only ones har
boring racist ideals, for there are plenty of so-called
minorities holding racist beliefs. But since white Americans
are in the majority, they must become more aware of how
racism continues adversely to affect American society.
Minority people in America must participate in this awaken
ing by realizing the constraints it has placed upon ourselves
and our subsequent views of the world.
The racism that is significant in America does not denote
violent bigotry stemming from an intense hatred or even
the notion that a differing race is inferior. Racism in modern
America is expressed more out of an ignorance that perpet
uates itself through a belief system based upon reoccurring
stereotypes and misconceptions.
We are constantly bombarded with messages stating how
far we have come. For we now live in a country that has
shown us that a black man can run for president, black
children and white children can be educated side by side,
and black families can exist peacefully in predominantly
white neighborhoods. So most of us would like to believe
that our intrinsic social circles are not influenced by racist
ideology. But, as Stanford educators and students, we are
failing to see how even though significant gains are being
made, American society is still revolving around a racist
belief system.
This evolving system is gradually doing away with or at
least suppressing the standard racism of the past. But it is
creating new traps and injustices of its own. Most of us, due
largely in part to the media, are presented with a fairy-tale
like conception of the status of race relations in the United
States. I mean, after all, the Cosby Show is number one. But
let us examine the reality. It is a reality that will show why
incidents like the one that occurred recently in Howard
Beach are not really all that surprising.
Although many minorities have made significant achieve
ments in America, there are still many obstacles we face. It
would be easy to list some of these obstacles. But we need
to examine what lies behind the statistics. It is not enough
just to say that there are too few black, Asian, Indian or
Hispanic actors in the movies, too few minorities in upper
management positions, fewer black students going to col
lege than 10 years ago, or even that women and minorities
still face frequent job discrimination.
We now live in a society that has mistakenly taken the
"give it time" attitude toward issues dealing with racism.
This is exemplified in how affirmative action programs are
now under attack from all sides. The argument is that affirm
ative action is just another form of discrimination, and some
minorities have even stated that they do not like being cho
sen on the basis of their skin color. But the sad truth is that
America has not come far enough to where a program like
affirmative action is no longer a necessity, although the
results of programs like affirmative action sometimes have
the effect of making it worse for minorities. They lead some

to think that just because they have a few minorities
employed, they do not need to actively seek to hire others.
With this misconception comes the notion that the oppor
tunity to achieve in America is the same for everyone, at
least in regard to skin color. Now that it is illegal to deny
someone access to a particular establishment because of his
skin color, many believe that there is no more racism except
in small little towns where the KKK hang out at the local
bars. We choose to ignore that racially divided neighbor
hoods still exist in the good ole U.S.A., and even more
ridiculous is how even the music industry revolves around
an unspoken racial agreement. Come on, do we award a
Grammy to the best Indonesian artist of the year? The music
industry is a terrific example of how racism is still going
strong in America. I mean, you can have your local Joe sit
there and tell you in all seriousness how a particular group
has "crossed over." I ask, crossed over into what and from
where?
It is sort of like minorities have been told to: "Come on
in, we'll let you achieve. But not too many of you and don't
make waves." This philosophy is like what is going on with
the Western Culture Program at Stanford. A multitude of
minority students and faculty can state that the program is
failing to meet some basic needs, but are met with the atti
tude that is essentially saying: We know what is best for you.
Thus, how long will the Western Culture debate go on? The
answer lies somewhere in the scenario that goes something
