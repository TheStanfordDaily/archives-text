# Safety up in Farm chem labs
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Stanford laboratories using and
handling hazardous materials have
made significant safety improvements
since March, according to Palo Alto
Fire Chief Robert Wall, who completed
a review of the facilities yesterday.
Stanford was to have fulfilled the
terms of a March agreement by Jan. 1,
and though that has not been done,
Wall said the laboratories are near
compliance.
"Everything's right on track," Wall
said, calling Stanford's progress
"significant."
To determine how much farther
Stanford has to go, firefighters will
conduct a "walk-through inspection
sometime in the next two weeks," Wall
said.
The inspection is intended primarily
to familiarize firefighters with potential
problems as well as "to locate hazar
dous areas and to find out what they've
done and haven't done," said Fire Mar
shall Frank Fiala.
"As many firefighters will participate
as possible, depending on shift re
quirements," he added.
Stanford is very near fulfillment of
the terms of the March agreement and
should be done by next week, accord
ing to Stanford Health and Safety Di
rector Alain Decleve.
In accordance with the agreement,
Decleve said, complete inventories of
hazardous materials used in the
Chemistry Department will be submit
ted to the Santa Clara County Health
Department by the end of the week.
Decleve added that inventories for the
research programs in the McCullough
Building, the Earth Sciences Depart
ment and the Biology Department will
follow in that order.
Areas with more potential danger
have taken precedence, he said.
Inventories will also be turned over
to the fire department, as was agreed
in March, Decleve said.
"They thought they had forwarded
copies to our office, but we didn't have
them," Wall said, adding that "that will
be done by the end of the week."
In addition, the posting of inven
tories outside laboratory doors is "90
percent complete," and should be
done soon, Decleve said.
Decleve added that Stanford "will
work with the fire department to
develop a response system for differ
ent levels of chemical accidents,"
saying that while there are such sys
tems geared to varying levels of fire
and other emergencies, nothing exists
to provide for flexible response to
hazardous materials problems.
Decleve also said a long-term proj
ect is being considered that would use
bar codes to identify chemicals and
make taking inventory easier. "They
could be added to lists at the time of
procurement," he said.
