## Agency works to make University handicap accessible 
### LAURA REED 
"Four years ago things were not easy
for me as a blind student here," said
graduate student Azim Assaf. "It wasn't
easy to get readers, there were no
computers available, and there wasn't a
disability office per se.
"Within the past three years, the sit
uation has improved tremendously,"
he added. "All of my major problerqs
have been solved."
The agency that solved his problems
realized that "handicap accessibility" at
Stanford meant much more than
wheelchair ramps and automatic
doors. In addition to physical acces
sibility, the agency sponsored a
notetaking service and oral inter
preters for hearing- or sight-impaired
students, as well as providing tapes of
all course reading material upon re
quest. It even opened a computing
resource room that houses Braille
typewriters and computers with large
print screens.
This agency is the Disability
Resource Center, located in 123 Meyer.
Set up in 1983 when the growing num
ber of physically handicapped students
attending Stanford required the es
tablishment of a central organization to
handle accessibility issues, the center
has improved handicap accessibility at
Stanford dramatically since then.
"We coordinate all of the acces
sibility programs, but we encourage
the specific departments on campus to
administer the programs themselves,"
said Jim Bouquin, director of the DRC,

emphasizing the center's decentralized
administrative policy. "For example,
the housing and facilities people have
been extremely cooperative in
remodeling Stern and Wilbur so that
the campus could have wheelchair
accessible freshman housing.
"We catch everything which falls be
tween the cracks," he continued. "In
other words, we handle accessibility
problems which do not fall under the
responsibility of University offices. For
example, we assist visiting faculty who
have disabilities and provide wheel
chairs for students with temporary dis
abilities."
Plans for future improvements in ac
cessibility are ambitious. One project
involves professional mobility instruc
tors working with campus landscape
architects to build directional markers
into the landscape to make the campus
more accessible for visually impaired
students.
"Because the number of students
with disabilities applying to colleges is
increasing dramatically, we're begin
ning to address the question of how to
accommodate this increase," Bouquin
said. "We're working on providing
housing for students with attendant
care and services for students with
learning disabilities."
Despite recent improvements and
upcoming programs to improve acces
sibility, some problem areas on
campus persist. "Even if we had un
limited funding, it would be difficult to
make Old Union Clubhouse accessi
ble," Bouquin said.

Another problem area he cited is
Mem Stonehenge" — the line of
stone blocks in front of Green Library
— which has been only partly success
ful in preventing students from
parking bikes in the path of the wheel
chair ramp to the library.
Senior Danny Kodmur, a member of
the center's Architectural Access Com
mittee, rated Stanford's wheelchair ac
cessibility as "pretty good."
"It has definitely improved in the
past three years because of increased
effort on the part of the University,"
Kodmur said.
His own attitude toward accessibility
improvements has changed too. "I
used to think the University was doing
me a favor in making the campus more
accessible, but now I've realized that

each project gets paid back with the
productivity of students who can func
tion efficiently on the campus."
Kodmur noted that "one of the
problems with architectural acces
sibility is that sometimes a door to a
bathroom, for example, can fit acces
sibility codes, yet be impossible for a
person in a wheelchair to enter. Build
ers have to remember that it's not just
an empty wheelchair — it's piloted by
a human being."
And there is still room for improve
ment.
"I still think Stanford can make
things more accessible to blind stu
dents," said Assaf." I would like to see
more interest in making the chalk

board more helpful and comprehensi
ble to blind students by means of
electronics."
He suggested several improvements
in print accessibility on campus, in
cluding making Coffee House menus,
The Daily and The Campus Report

available to visually impaired students.
"We need to make the community
more aware of accessibility,' Assaf con
cluded. "It could be the subject of cer
tain projects in classes, for example, in
electronic engineering or medicine.
Once you make the community more
aware of what is needed for physically
handicapped students, I think you d
find more cooperation from the stu
dents towards finding ways to improve
accessibility."
