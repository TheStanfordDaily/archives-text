# Small shop sets cyclists spinning

### JAMES R. DICKEY Staff writer 
Good things come in small
packages.
That's the way Campus Bike Shop
owner Keith Moranz looks at it. His
small, wooden, green building has
housed a thriving business for
decades.
Actually, the diminutive hut between
Rogers House and Owen House on
Salvatierra Lane has only been there

since 1975, when it was moved from its
original site next to the Old Firehouse,
where it had been for about 40 years.
Nine years ago, Moranz bought the
bike shop from Fred and Helen Morris,
who had owned the shop for more
than 38 years. He had begun working
part time with them through a mutual
friend, and the connection led to a full
time career.
"I was going to college in San Fran
cisco and I wanted to raise some extra
money, so I started doing little jobs for

them (the Morrises) part time during
the summer and on my vacations,"
Moranz said.
"Soon I started getting more and
more involved," he continued. "And
eventually I was working more and
more, and they were trusting me with
the business while they went on vaca
tions or just took time off."
One thing led to another, and when
the Morrises were ready for retire
ment, they felt like Moranz was ready
for ownership.
Moranz is still not sure why he
ended up in the bicycle business,
though. "I only owned one bike my
whole life up until 1 started working
here," he said.
Since taking over the business,
Moranz's outlook has changed. "I
wouldn't mind opening up a specialty
bike store somewhere else in addition
to this one, but one that's more con
centrated on high performance bikes,"
he admitted.
He knows that such a shop wouldn't
be what is most needed here on
campus.
"Almost all of the work we get in
here is inexpensive or just good, hard
working bikes, the type of bike used
for basic transportation and not just for
fun," he explained.
Moranz is well aware that the stu
dent community is where the vast
majority of his work comes from. Ap
proximately 75 percent of the bike
shop's trade comes from Stanford stu
dents. The remaining 25 percent is

mostly faculty and staff.
Understandably enough, then, busi
ness is seasonal.
"At the beginning of fall, 1 have to
have three or four part-time students
to help me in addition to my parents
help," Moranz said. "And I close up
shop during the holidays because
there's almost no business at all then."
Moranz is excellent at accommodat
ing his student clientele. In addition to
weekday hours, the bike shop is open
on Saturdays. It accepts checks and
credit cards as well as cash, and, for
most repair jobs, the work is done by
the next day. The tiny shop can handle
up to 30 repairs per day.
Sometimes his effort to be helpful
goes far beyond the call of duty. On
more than one occasion, he has had
customers leave bicycles for as long as
one year before returning to claim
them. In each case, Moranz says he has
kept the bikes stored for the owners.
In addition to repair work, the bike
shop has plenty of bikes for sale or
rent lined up in neat rows all along the
porch and sidewalk surrounding the
building.
Inside, the shop is covered wall to
wall with bicycle accessories and tools.
There is a sense of organized chaos to
the displays that is in perfect harmony
with the wooden deck and building.
At the back of the shop is a com
pressed air pump and plenty of tools
on loan for thoseldorii-yourselfers who
aren't quite as well prepared as they
should be.
