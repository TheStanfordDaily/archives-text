Very few individuals can actually
dominate the flow of a basketball
game.
The Michael Jordans and Cheryl Mil
lers, by virtue of their supreme talents,
often make the game look like an indi
vidual sport.
In the absence of such virtuosos,
however, we are faced with the reality
that basketball is a team sport, and that
failure is inevitable without some sort
of team cohesiveness.
No one understands this more than
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We are looking for the meshing of
talent, not just the individual talent,"
she said. "We have to get people who
not only play well, but play well to
gether,"
Tonight in Maples Pavilion at 7:30,
VanDerveer will try to mix the right
formula to deal with the visiting Brig
ham Young Cougars, a team that relies
heavily on individual talent.
The Cougars boast a prolific scorer
in Tresa Spaulding, a 6-foot-7 senior
who, at 23 8 points per game, is among
the nation's scoring leaders. She also

rebounds in double figures (10.1) and
blocks 5.8 shots per game.
Spaulding's individual talents,
however, couldn't save the Cougars
during a three-game road trip last
week, as BYU fell to Loyola (111.) 80-72,
DePaul 81-73 and Duke 80-60. The
Cougars are 6-7 this season.
"BYU is a very big team but not
super quick," VanDerveer said. "Some

teams get into passing lanes because of
their quickness. But BYU gets into
lanes because of their size.
Offensively, the 8-5 Cardinal will
have to pass well to counter BYU's
sizable man-on-man defense.
Stanford certainly does not lack tal
ent in this area, as Jennifer Azzi's crisp
passing continues to be a crowd
pleaser this season. The 5-7 freshman
is second in the Pacific 10 Conference
in assists. At her current pace of 5.7 as
sists per game, Azzi would eclipse
Angie Paccione's school record of 151
posted during the 1982-83 season.
