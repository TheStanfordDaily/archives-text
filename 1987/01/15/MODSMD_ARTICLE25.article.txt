# Wrestlers at full strength for meet with Humboldt

After having to forfeit three individ
ual matches in its last dual meet, the
Stanford wrestling team will find itself
on even ground today as it hosts Hum
boldt State in Roble'Gytrfat 4-.30 p.m.
The Cardinal, 1-4-1 this season, will
have Ail-American Scott Wiggen (150
pounds) and freshman John Lisle (126)
back in the lineup today. "We should
have as full a lineup as we're capable of
having," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
said.
Both Wiggen and Lisle missed the
Cardinal's last dual meet, a 23-23 tie

last Wednesday against Simon-Fraser.
Lisle was bothered by the flu, and Wig
gen was out with bruised ribs. "Wiggen
is still injured with his ribs," Horpel
said. "He's going to be not 100 per
cent."
In addition to having Wiggen and
Lisle back, Stanford may not lose in the
118-pound division today. The Card
inal has forfeited this match in each of
its six dual meets because the team
does not have a light enough wrestler.
However, Humboldt may find itself in
the same predicament today.
"They have a couple of guys who
haven't been able to make the weight
class," Horpel said. "We might start out
even."

Even if it cannot field a wrestler at
118 pounds, Humboldt should give the
Cardinal a good battle as it has in the
past few years. Last season, Stanford's
30-20 victory was not decided until the
final two matches. In 1985, the two
teams wrestled to a 22-22 tie, and in
1984, Humboldt narrowly defeated
Stanford 23-20.
Today's meet should be just as close,
Horpel said. "It's a pretty even match,"
Horpel said. "I know they're strong at
134, 150, 167 and heavyweight."
The meet could well be decided in
the heavyweight match. Stanford's Kurt
Kassulke and Humboldt's Dave Wolf
