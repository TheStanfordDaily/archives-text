# Magic at Maples
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
You knew them, you loved them, but for the
last 10 years, you've probably lived without
them.
If you had seen them do their thing last night,
you would would have wished the above was
not true, you would have realized that you can't
live without them. They are, after all, the inim
itable Harlem Globetrotters.
They boast fun for all ages, and nobody who
witnessed last night's Maples Pavilion show
would disagree. There weren't just giggling kids
and chuckling parents; there were smiling teens
and laughing grandparents. Even the policemen
were having a good time.
The typical, though not really quotable,
responses of the hundreds of kids pressing up
against the side and endlines can be well
represented by those of seven-year-olds Joshua
Newman and Avi Soloman of Palo Alto, both
treated to their first performance from the
"Magicians of the Court."
Though it was difficult to draw their attention
from the on-court antics of "Twiggy," "Bobo,"
"Shorty" and"the Glide," their briefly phrased
answers were clear. They were rooting for the
Globetrotters, of course. The other team, the
Washington Generals, was not considered "bad
guys," and their good-natured playing as the
Trotters' foils seemed to have actually endeared
them to Joshua and Avi a little.
There was one person, however, who Joshua
thought wasn't "too nice," pointing to one of the
referees, the one who was always whining as
James "Twiggy" Sanders (Joshua and Avi's favor
ite) played yet another trick on him.
For Globetrotter purists, it must be said that
Twiggy's hook from just inside the halfcourt line
did not compare with that of the legendary
Meadowlark Lemon. Twiggy, in his 11th year of
trotting around the globe, was 0 for 3 on the
night.
A pair of adults who had seen Meadowlark in
his prime reminisced of the time when Lemon,

standing in the walkway above the press section
in the upper level, received a pass from his
teammate and promptly put two points on the
board with probably the only successful
grandstand hook shot ever.
The Twig wasn't bad, though. Flapping his
arms and contorting his reed-thin frame in every
possible way, Sanders performed admirably in
the usual water and purse-stealing tricks and
added a couple new ones. A little girl being led
by her mother out of the stands was a prime tar
get. "I know where you're going, I know where
you're going," Twiggy taunted. But hey, if you
gotta go, you gotta go."
A couple minutes later, when a woman got up
to make a similar venture, Sanders caught her
out of the corner of his eye. Not really into em
barrassment on the arena-wide level, the woman
sat right back down.
The Clown Prince-in-training is Michael
"Memphis" Douglas, in his first year as a
"funster."
Claiming to have an announcement for the
crowd, he took the microphone and said,
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest
here tonight. All the way from East St. Louis,
former heavyweight champion, Leon Spinks!" All
heads turned to the upper level where Memphis
was pointing. Then Memphis realized his
mistake and, obviously embarrassed, said, "Oh,
sorry lady, but you do look like him."
Oh, yes, they played basketball, too. Each
quarter was started off with a couple minutes of
fairly serious play, and both teams showed why
many of their players had been excellent players
at the Division I level in college. Who would win
if they played the whole game seriously? It's
hard to say, but the Trotters certainly would not
be undefeated over the last 15 years.
After the first few minutes, the closest the
Generals got was six points, but they never fell
behind by more than 20. The final score was 84-
73, although the way entire minutes were taken
off at a time as the final quarter came to an end
indicates that Washington was not given a fair
chance to come back.

Oh, yes, they played basketball, too. Each
quarter was started off with a couple minutes of
fairly serious play, and both teams showed why
many of their players had been excellent players
at the Division I level in college. Who would win
if they played the whole game seriously? It's
hard to say, but the Trotters certainly would not
be undefeated over the last 15 years.
After the first few minutes, the closest the
Generals got was six points, but they never fell
behind by more than 20. The final score was 84-
73, although the way entire minutes were taken
off at a time as the final quarter came to an end
indicates that Washington was not given a fair
chance to come back.
You knew them, you loved them, but for the
last 10 years, you've probably lived without
them.
If you had seen them do their thing last night,
you would would have wished the above was
not true, you would have realized that you can't
live without them. They are, after all, the inim
itable Harlem Globetrotters.
They boast fun for all ages, and nobody who
witnessed last night's Maples Pavilion show
would disagree. There weren't just giggling kids
and chuckling parents; there were smiling teens
and laughing grandparents. Even the policemen
were having a good time.
The typical, though not really quotable,
responses of the hundreds of kids pressing up
against the side and endlines can be well
represented by those of seven-year-olds Joshua
Newman and Avi Soloman of Palo Alto, both
treated to their first performance from the
"Magicians of the Court."
Though it was difficult to draw their attention
from the on-court antics of "Twiggy," "Bobo,"
"Shorty" and"the Glide," their briefly phrased
answers were clear. They were rooting for the
Globetrotters, of course. The other team, the
Washington Generals, was not considered "bad
guys," and their good-natured playing as the
Trotters' foils seemed to have actually endeared
them to Joshua and Avi a little.
There was one person, however, who Joshua
thought wasn't "too nice," pointing to one of the
referees, the one who was always whining as
James "Twiggy" Sanders (Joshua and Avi's favor
ite) played yet another trick on him.
For Globetrotter purists, it must be said that
Twiggy's hook from just inside the halfcourt line
did not compare with that of the legendary
Meadowlark Lemon. Twiggy, in his 11th year of
trotting around the globe, was 0 for 3 on the
night.
A pair of adults who had seen Meadowlark in
his prime reminisced of the time when Lemon,

standing in the walkway above the press section
in the upper level, received a pass from his
teammate and promptly put two points on the
board with probably the only successful
grandstand hook shot ever.
The Twig wasn't bad, though. Flapping his
arms and contorting his reed-thin frame in every
possible way, Sanders performed admirably in
the usual water and purse-stealing tricks and
added a couple new ones. A little girl being led
by her mother out of the stands was a prime tar
get. "I know where you're going, I know where
you're going," Twiggy taunted. But hey, if you
gotta go, you gotta go."
A couple minutes later, when a woman got up
to make a similar venture, Sanders caught her
out of the corner of his eye. Not really into em
barrassment on the arena-wide level, the woman
sat right back down.
The Clown Prince-in-training is Michael
"Memphis" Douglas, in his first year as a
"funster."
Claiming to have an announcement for the
crowd, he took the microphone and said,
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest
here tonight. All the way from East St. Louis,
former heavyweight champion, Leon Spinks!" All
heads turned to the upper level where Memphis
was pointing. Then Memphis realized his
mistake and, obviously embarrassed, said, "Oh,
sorry lady, but you do look like him."
Oh, yes, they played basketball, too. Each

fairly serious play, and both teams showed why
many of their players had been excellent players
