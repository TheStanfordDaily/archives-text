# Predict top-five finish
## Gymnasts not fazed by injuries 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Confidence is certainly the key word to describe
the Stanford men's gymnastics team. Despite an
injury-laden debut meet at UC-Davis that saw the
Cardinal, last year's third-place finisher in the
NCAAs, take fourth, the gymnasts remain optimistic
about their prospects.
"We're basically a top-five team," junior captain
Mike Matzek said. "Once you get in the top five,
anything can happen, and any team can beat any
other team."
"We are a young team, a good team,'' sopho
more Andy Ropp said. "We have three amazing
freshmen. When Adam (Foreman) gets back he
will contribute a lot, and the other two (Conrad
Voorsinger and Charles Loop) already have."
Foreman, the No. 1 recruit in the nation last year,
will be a key addition to the growing gymnastics
program. "Adam's whole choice was Stanford or
none," Matzek said. "He felt that our program is
good enough to take him to the Olympics."

"Stanford hadn't been really good until two
years ago," Ropp noted. "Now that we have a good
team, we will attract good gymnasts."
Matzek remembers his first season well and
likens it to the team's current situation. "In the
beginning of the year we had a lot of injuries that
all came at one time. In the same sense, we were
all getting better at the same time.
"It all came together in the second half of the
year," Matzek added. "Toward the end we said,
Hey, we could make NCAAs,' and we did." Stan
ford finished the 1985 meet — its first champion
ship appearance — in seventh place.
This season could be just as successful. "This
year could be easier," Matzek said. "We have more
experience in championship meets, and we have a
lot of winners on this team."
Ropp agreed. "Chuck (Gerardo) has a chance to
be the pommel horse champ of the NCAA, and
Mike has a chance for the rings and high bar cham
pionships."
Gerardo's aim is no small feat. Gerardo, who
finished first in the all-around in last weekend's

meet at Davis, faces tough competition, especially
from Fullerton State's Li Xiao Ping. Li is a former
world champion on the pommel horse and a 1984
Olympic medalist from China. He has been
granted one year of eligibility by the NCAA.
Nonetheless, Matzek assesses Gerardo's chances
as favorable. "At the last meet I saw Li Xiao Ping,
and he was good," the sophomore said. "But
Chuck's set was more exciting and the audience
liked it more."
What the team possesses in talent it loses in
depth. "We had five toes (gymnasts competing with
minor injuries) — two freshmen, two sophomores
and one junior — and a neck, me on the sidelines
(Matzek was forced out of competition by a neck
injury suffered when he overrotated doing a
double back), in the last meet," Matzek said.
The Cardinal should be at full strength by its
next meet, the home season-opening Hobee's Invi
tational Feb. 13- "It's three weeks (actually a
month) until the next meet, so the injury factor
should be a non-factor," Matzek said. "The Hobee's
Invitational should be awesome."
