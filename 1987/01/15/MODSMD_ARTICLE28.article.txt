## The
						beginner's guide to Napa wine tasting spots 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN Staff writer 
Are you still mourning over not
taking Wine Appreciation 101 last quar
ter? Have you been afraid to go wine
tasting for fear of being made to look
like an ignorant fool in front of
hundreds of others visitors? Fear no
longer. The large wineries of the Napa
Valley make wine tasting easy. Even if
you don't know the difference be
tween beaujolais noveau and wine-in
a-box, you can feel right at home in
Napa.
The Robert Mondavi winery just off
Highway 29 in Oakville is an ideal
place to start a day of touring in the val
ley. On weekends you have to arrive
early for the free tours since they fill
up quickly. The Mondavi winery offers
free tours and tastings that are among
the best in the area for novices. The
tour lasts about 45 minutes and takes
you through every step of the wine

making process from vine to bottle.
Although one of the older wineries
in Napa, this estate uses some of the
most modern technology available in
producing its premium wines. After an
up-close examination of the actual
vineyard, the tour takes you inside a
large complex filled with rows of huge
stainless-steel fermentation tanks.
Here, with the aid of a huge computer
system, the winemakers perform their
magic in an effort to get just the right
balance and favor.
After learning all there is to know
about modern winemaking, the tour
takes visitors into one of several tasting
rooms. Starting with how to use those
two-pronged wine openers (called
"Ah-so's") the tour guide teaches you
everything you need to know to look
like a real pro when you taste wines.
The next stop on our whirlwind
Napa tour is Inglenook, just a few miles
north on Highway 29 in the small town
of Rutherford. Inglenook's tours skip

the actual winemaking process, but
here you can see the endless miles of
old oak wine barrels that you always
dreamed you'd see on a winery tour.
The winery ages its Napa wines almost
exclusively in oak 60-gallon barrels.

The tour guides here are a bit more
casual and friendly than at most of the
other wineries in the valley. There is,
of course, the optional tasting lifter the
tour. Even if you have trouble swallow
ing Inglenook's wines, the tour guides'

humor makes the tastings well worth
the time.
Continue north on Highway 29 to St.
Helena and the Beringer vineyards.
The centerpiece here is the beautiful
Rhine House, built by the two Beringer
brothers soon after settling in the val
ley in the 1860s. The winery offers
short pleasant tours into the caves that
the Beringers built into the hillside.
These caves manage to maintain a year
round mean temperature of 58
degrees, ideal for the aging of fine
wines.
Beringer Vineyard has complimen
tary tasting of their current releases fol
lowing the tours. Upstairs in the Rhine
House is the beautiful "founder's
room" where vintage bottle-aged and
reserve wines may be tasted at a
nominal charge. The typical winery
crowds are non-existent in the foun
der's room, making this an ideal place
to come for some quiet imbibing away
from the tourist throngs.

For soap opera fans, just a few miles
from Beringer is Spring Mountain
Winery, famous for its "Falcon Crest"
house. The house is beautiful, but the
wines are not worth the extra drive up
the hillside.
Finally, end your day of wine tasting
at Sterling Vineyards off the main high
way near Calistoga at the north end of
the valley. For a nominal charge you
will be taken to this hilltop winery in a
ski-lift-style gondola. The winery has a
self-guided tour around its wine tasting
facility. The views from the roof of the
winery over the valley are fabulous,
and there is a pleasant lounge for com
plimentary' wine tasting.
Be sure either to plan on spending
the night in the valley or to designate a
driver who will spend the day tasting
various vintages of Coke and Pepsi.
The highway patrol is very active in the
Napa Valley and takes a dim look on
drivers who have spent the day
winetasting.
