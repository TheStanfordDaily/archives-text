# Sierra Camp: ‘the best summer of my life’
## 
### FELICIA PAIK Editorial staff 
It's that time of year again. The time of year
when Stanford students begin making summer
plans. One option could be a summer outdoors
•and a job filled with hard work, responsibility
and fun at Stanford Sierra Camp.
The camp is owned and operated by the
•Stanford Alumni Association, and its facilities
are available for the use of Stanford alumni, fac
ulty and staff and their friends and families.
Each of the 11 one-week sessions will be atten
ded by 270 guests. Fifty-five Stanford students
operate the camp at Fallen Leaf Lake.

The camp has facilities for instruction in art,
photography, crafts, hiking, exercise, sailing,
tennis, waterskiing and volleyball. In addition,
staff members present a talent show, a campflre
and a water skiing demonstration each week
for the guests.
At camp, Stanford students do everything
from operating the water skiing dock, organiz
ing children's activities and teaching tennis to
running the dining hall and camp office. Stu
dents who will attend Stanford for at least two
more quarters are eligible to apply for this
summer. Two-hundred applications are ex
pected for approximately 55 positions.
"We are looking for people with personality,

people who are friendly and outgoing. We also
want people who have special interest and tal
ents to contribute," said Lori Govan, the camp's
staff director.
Past camp counselors have described the 11
weeks at Fallen Leaf Lake as the best summer of
their lives.
"I wish I could go back every summer for the
rest of my life," said Jon King, who graduated in
1986 and has been a camp counselor for the
last two summers.
"We tend only to meet people our own age.
It was good to meet people that were older
than us and become their friends," King said.
"The interaction between the Stanford stu

dents is also special. The pressure of school or
studying for exams does not exist up there, "
said Tami Stein, a 1986 graduate and camp
counselor for the past three summers.
Govan said that at times the life at camp is
"like living in a fishbowl since you live and
work with the same people every day for 11
weeks, and there is a lack of privacy."
But she said it is a learning experience to in
teract with co-workers and guests. Another
benefit is the fact that each staff member has
one-and-a-half scheduled days off per week.
Hard work is demanded and expected in
operating the camp and planning events, but it
is balanced by the rewarding nature of the job

and the fun, according to Govan.
"There aren't too many times where you can
keep busy, do something you enjoy and be ful
filled but not feel high pressure," Govan said.
Some students may feel that spending the
summer as a camp counselor would not en
hance their future careers, but at camp the
counselors learn to work together and compro
mise under close quarters, which is essential in
any work environment, according to Govan.
"Also, all the guests are Stanford alumni, and
there are ways to make future connections for
potential jobs," Govan said.
A staff member's wage is $110 a week, plus
tips (about $90), and includes room and board.
