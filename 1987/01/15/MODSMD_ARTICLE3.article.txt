The Stanford Post Office should have 2,100 more boxes
by the end of February, according to Mike Bosctt, customer
service manager for the Palo Alto Post Office.
The boxes will be located in a post office kiosk being con
structed between the post office and the Bookstore and will
make Stanford's section of post office boxes the largest in
the country, Bosctt said. He said Stanford will have more
than 10,000 boxes when the kiosk is completed.
The post office is also installing parcel lockers in the
dorms this summer so that by fall students in dorms will not
have to go to the post offices to pick up packages, he said.
The kiosk should also provide mail boxes tor the
hundreds of students who now have none. In September,
400 people were on the waiting list to receive boxes, ac
cording to Joan Kruse, operations manager of Mail and
Delivery Services, but Kruse said many have since taken
their names off the list.
