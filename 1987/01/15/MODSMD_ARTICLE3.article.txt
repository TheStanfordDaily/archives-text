# Post office constructing a new kiosk
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Post Office should have 2,100 more boxes
by the end of February, according to Mike Bosctt, customer
service manager for the Palo Alto Post Office.
The boxes will be located in a post office kiosk being con
structed between the post office and the Bookstore and will
make Stanford's section of post office boxes the largest in
the country, Bosctt said. He said Stanford will have more
than 10,000 boxes when the kiosk is completed.
The post office is also installing parcel lockers in the
dorms this summer so that by fall students in dorms will not
have to go to the post offices to pick up packages, he said.
The kiosk should also provide mail boxes tor the
hundreds of students who now have none. In September,
400 people were on the waiting list to receive boxes, ac
cording to Joan Kruse, operations manager of Mail and
Delivery Services, but Kruse said many have since taken
their names off the list.
'it is not intended that every student have a post office
box," Bosctt said. "There will be some
people that will still want boxes."
Residential Education will decide
which students receive boxes, but stu
dents in dormitories without mail

delivery will have first priority, Kruse
said.
Bosctt, who began working at the
Palo Alto post office in November
1985, first sought approval to construct
the kiosk in May 1986.
Administrators at both Stanford and
the Palo Alto Post Office were inter
ested, Bosctt said, and a long period of
talking, negotiating and consulting ar

chitects began. Final approval for the
project was given in mid-December.
The construction of the kiosk is a
rushed project, according to Bosctt.
"I've seen projects of this nature take
up to five years to work their way
through the application process," he
said.
"Anytime the government and Stan
ford University get something done in

less than a year, that's a minor
miracle," said Bosctt.
"We're looking forward to it (the ad
dition)," he said, although he admitted
that he did not know if the new boxes
would solve the shortage of boxes.
Bosctt also anticipated that parking
around the post office area would
become a worse problem.
