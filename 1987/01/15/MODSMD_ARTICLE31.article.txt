# SIG offers new fellowship in Washington
## 
### JEFFREY SEINFELD 
Stanford in Government last night announced a
new $1,250 fellowship for a summer position in
the Washington office of Congressman Lee Hamil
ton (D-Ind).
Kep. Hamilton currently serves as chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on
Europe and the Middle East and chair of Legisla
tion on the House Intelligence Committee, which
is investigating the Iranian arms deals.
This fellowship will replace last summer's posi
tion with the House Rules Committee. Last year's
fellowships in the Office of Technology Assess-

ment, the office of the United States Trade Repre
sentative and the House Sub-Committee on Crim
inal Justice will still be available this summer.
Each fellowship includes a guarantee of sub
stantive assignments, a stipend of $1,250, up from
$800 last year, and priority assistance in housing
with alumni in Washington.
Applications will be open to all Stanford under
graduates, and fellows will be chosen by commit
tees of Stanford faculty, staff and students.
Additionally, SIG will offer the new "SIG Select
Internship," which this year will be with Amnesty
International. The Select Internship differs from
the fellowship in that it will not include the

stipend. The application process will function in
the same manner (through a Stanford commit
tee), and, like the fellowships, Amnesty has
reserved a space for a Stanford student. SIG Fel
lowship Director Rob Weitzner said that, in fact,
their enthusiasm played a role in the establish
ment of this special internship."
Weitzner also confirmed that the position with
Amnesty will be comparable in nature to the fel
lowships. The student's duties will include moni
toring congressional hearings, drafting reports
and a possible research project that would span
the entire 10 weeks of the internship.
According to Brian Best of Amnesty, the organi-

zation wanted at least two Stanford students, one
for the Washington office and the other for the
Mid-Atlantic Region office, both located in Wash
ington, D.C. SIG, however, was only able to han
dle one candidate, so potential interns in the Mid-
Atlantic office must apply to Amnesty themselves.
Also at last night's meeting, SIG announced five
$1,000 scholarships for its new program in
Sacramento and its annual telephone solicitation,
scheduled for Jan. 24, which will help assist stu
dents in their summer internships.
Applications for these, the fellowships and
other summer positions are available in the SIG
office and are due Feb. 9.
