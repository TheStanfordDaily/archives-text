# Jackson expected to dazzle

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights
leader known for his forceful and emotional
speeches, is scheduled to speak in Memorial
Auditorium today in honor of the late Martin
Luther King Jr.
"1 would anticipate at a minimum a bril
liant rhetorical performance in the Martin
Luther King Jr. tradition," said Richard Gillam,
a visiting professor in the Humanities Special
Program. Last quarter Gillam taught a class on
America in the 19605.
Jackson has played and continues to play
many roles in history. He was a close friend to
Martin Luther King in the 19605. In 1984 he
ran for the Democratic Party presidential
nomination.
Today he is an ordained Baptist minister
and the leader of Chicago's Operation PUSH
(People United to Serve Humanity), an or

ganization working against discriminatory
business practices.
"There's nothing unusual about black poli
tical leaders playing multiple roles," said St.
Clair Drake, professor emeritus of anthropol
ogy and sociology.
According to Drake, combining the roles of
minister and political leader is an established
tradition within American black leadership.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a preacher.
Jackson's significance today is often tied to
his association with the "rainbow coalition," a
group composed of members of all ethnic
classes.
"The old Roosevelt coalition is long gone
in this country. We only have bits and pieces
of it left in the Democratic Party, and Jackson
is the most prominent champion of those
politics," said History Prof. Paul Seaver.
According to History Prof. Barton
Bernstein, Jackson's many roles contribute to
and complement each other.

"All of Jackson's roles represent efforts by
an established black American liberal to deal
with and compel America to deal with
profound social problems, especially injus
tices involving race and poverty," Bernstein
said.
Jackson's visit coincides with a Faculty Sen
ate vote this afternoon on the proposed al
ternative Western Culture class that focuses
on women and minorities in the United
States.
The current program's neglect of women
and minorities has been cited as an example
of racism and sexism at Stanford by those
who are working to change the program.
Jackson is expected to address issues of
race at elite universities.
According to Drake, elite universities are
working toward equal opportunities for all
students, but the federal government's cut-

back on financial aid to minorities is
hampering the programs.
"I focus my fire not on the elite uni
versities but on the federal govern
ment's fiscal policies, which make their
programs increasingly difficult to
implement," Drake said.

According to Bernstein, Stanford's
position on issues of race is difficult to
judge.
"The issue of South Africa is a salient
symbolic political matter where the
University's response has not been suf
ficient. Though it's worth noting,"
Bernstein added, "that if the University
had divested, it would not change the
day-to-day experiences of black stu
dents and faculty here. It might make

them feel more significantly valued."
According to Gillam, one reason for
Jackson's visit is a growing sense of
community among the black students
on campus.
"In lots of ways Jesse Jackson really
does represent the King legacy," Gil
lam said. "Jackson is one of the few
American public figures capable of
speaking to the hearts as well as the
minds of the American people."
