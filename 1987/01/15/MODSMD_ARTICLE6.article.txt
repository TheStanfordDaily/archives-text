# Faculty Senate will vote on new course
## 
### FRANK QUARATIELLO DAN DE LUCE 
After months of campus controversy over the
proper character of the Western Culture Program,
the Faculty Senate will vote today on a proposed
spring quarter course emphasizing the contribu
tions of women and minorities to Western cul
ture.
The new course was prepared by History Prof.
Clay Carson, director of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Papers Project. In early December, the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) voted 8-2 to
recommend Carson's proposed course to the
senate.
Before the senate votes, Classics Prof. Marsh
McCall, head of the CUS, will give a brief
presentation recommending the new course.
Several faculty members feel that the senate will
vote in favor of Carson's course.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz said he thinks it
will pass and added that, since members of the
senate initially encouraged Carson to prepare this
course, "it would be like a personal insult to Prof.
Carson if the Faculty Senate didn't vote in favor of
the course."
Prof. Paul Robinson, chairman of the History
Department and head of the Western Culture Pro
gram Committee (WCPC), which first approved
the proposal, said he hopes the proposed course
will be supported.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy said it
was an "unusual situation for the senate to be
looking so closely at the substance of one
course."
He added that "the senate's action is in direct
response to pressure from certain groups that
feel that the current Western Culture programs
which are offered are inadequate."
Amanda Kemp, head of the Black Student Un
ion, favors senate approval of the course, but said
"I think what we want in the future ... is a funda
mental overhaul of the program."
Robinson doubts a new year-long sequence,
emphasizing women and minorities, will be im
plemented because "this type of course takes an
enormous amount of work (to develop)."
As proposed, the course would be offered on a

one-time basis this spring. Freshmen now have a
choice of eight different sequences in fulfilling
the Western Culture requirement. If Carson's
course is adopted, current freshmen will have the
opportunity to choose it as the final quarter in
their year-long Western Culture sequence.
The basic structure of Carson's course, titled
"Western Culture — An Alternative View," is
similar to that of other Western Culture tracks,
with three lectures per week and small, two-hour
discussion sections.
The difference between this course and other
Western Culture courses is its focus tin women
and minorities. As a result, the course's syllabus
relies on a relatively high proportion of second
ary readings to make the unconventional primary
readings more understandable.
Enrollment in the proposed Western Culture
course would be limited to 100 students, and only
a certain percentage of students from any one se
quence would be able to take the new course.
Rebholz said he feels the proposed course may
"emphasize secondary sources too much," but on
the whole, he feels that "it would be a wonderful
and interesting course to take."
The new course, even for its proponents, is
only a temporary measure. According to Rebholz:
"The problem of under-representation of women
and minorities in the Western Culture Program is
genuine. The ultimate solution, however, has to
come from within the individual Western Culture
tracks." The course is only intended as a "stop
gap measure," and no one expects it to solve the
whole problem, he said.
One major criticism of the proposed course is
that it might cause other Western Culture tracks
to pay less attention to women and minorities.
Robinson disagrees: "The evidence points in the
opposite direction. At least two other Western
Culture courses are considering adding some of
the texts from the new course to their own
reading lists."
Rebholz said "the increased representation of
women and minority writers recently in courses
like Great Works and Literature and the Arts is
related to the ongoing concern for women and
minorities in Western Culture. It is not a result of
Prof. Carson's proposed course."

feel that the current Western Culture programs
which are offered are inadequate."
Amanda Kemp, head of the Black Student Un
ion, favors senate approval of the course, but said
"I think what we want in the future ... is a funda
mental overhaul of the program."
Robinson doubts a new year-long sequence,
emphasizing women and minorities, will be im
plemented because "this type of course takes an
enormous amount of work (to develop)."
As proposed, the course would be offered on a

one-time basis this spring. Freshmen now have a
choice of eight different sequences in fulfilling
the Western Culture requirement. If Carson's
course is adopted, current freshmen will have the
opportunity to choose it as the final quarter in
their year-long Western Culture sequence.
The basic structure of Carson's course, titled
"Western Culture — An Alternative View," is
similar to that of other Western Culture tracks,
with three lectures per week and small, two-hour
discussion sections.
The difference between this course and other
Western Culture courses is its focus tin women
and minorities. As a result, the course's syllabus
relies on a relatively high proportion of second
ary readings to make the unconventional primary
readings more understandable.
Enrollment in the proposed Western Culture
course would be limited to 100 students, and only
a certain percentage of students from any one se
quence would be able to take the new course.
Rebholz said he feels the proposed course may
"emphasize secondary sources too much," but on
the whole, he feels that "it would be a wonderful
and interesting course to take."
The new course, even for its proponents, is
only a temporary measure. According to Rebholz:
"The problem of under-representation of women
and minorities in the Western Culture Program is
genuine. The ultimate solution, however, has to
come from within the individual Western Culture
tracks." The course is only intended as a "stop
gap measure," and no one expects it to solve the
whole problem, he said.
One major criticism of the proposed course is
that it might cause other Western Culture tracks
to pay less attention to women and minorities.
Robinson disagrees: "The evidence points in the
opposite direction. At least two other Western
Culture courses are considering adding some of
the texts from the new course to their own
reading lists."
Rebholz said "the increased representation of
women and minority writers recently in courses
like Great Works and Literature and the Arts is
related to the ongoing concern for women and
minorities in Western Culture. It is not a result of
Prof. Carson's proposed course."
