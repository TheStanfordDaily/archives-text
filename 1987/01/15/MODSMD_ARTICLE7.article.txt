# Library site unlikely to be changed

Protests against the site of the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial Library are "a little tardy,"' according to University
Planning Director Phil Williams.
But some modifications are still possible, Williams
said. Altering the design of the building, screening the
site so it is less visible, planting trees and rethinking the
road are all very possible, Williams said.
At this point, people should be focusing more on
these issues than relocation, he said.
The County Planning Commission, which approved
the current site Dec. 4, is now in charge of decisions re
garding the library, Williams said.
The commission must certify an environmental impact
report, approve a use permit and approve the final
design of the building before the library is built. It can
impose conditions on the landscaping, screening, plant
ing, parking and lighting of the library, according to Wil
liams.
"Each step involves a public meeting where people
can voice their dissent," Williams said.
"There is very little chance that the (Reagan Library)
site will be changed," said Williams. Two years ago, the
Board of Trustees "offered President Reagan the site, and
he accepted it, so it would be very awkward to take it
back.
On Monday, acting University President James Rosse
also said that "it is unlikely the University will change its
point of view'' on the Reagan Library's location in the
campus foothills.
Williams said 20 different sites were considered
before choosing the library's current projected location.
Sites farther back in the foothills would introduce traf
fic more deeply into them, and a site at Sand Hill Road
and Interstate 280 is too far away from campus to be use
ful as an educational resource, Williams said.
"It is important to remember that the foothills are not
virgin wilderness," Williams said. The Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and the Dish are
two structures that already exist there.
Williams said plans for the library have not changed
appreciably since their original conception. The original
size estimate for the building was 50,000 to 100,000
square feet, and the current estimate is 150,000 square
feet. Two-thirds of this will be underground.
In addition, "the estimates of traffic have been in the
same ballpark for years," Williams said. "It will be
heavier than any single use up there now, but incom
parably smaller than the traffic on Junipero Serra
Boulevard
