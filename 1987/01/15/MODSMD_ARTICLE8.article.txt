New tax law to increase deficit
WASHINGTON — The new federal income tax law will bring in $15.7
billion less revenue over the next five years than the system it replaced, in
creasing the federal budget deficit in the years after the Reagan administra
tion has departed, according to new Treasury Department estimates.
"Revenue-neutrality," a driving principle behind the Tax Reform Act of
1986, had given nervous legislators political courage to repeal or limit
many popular deductions in return for reducing tax rates for individuals
and corporations.
The overhaul process nearly ended several times when amendments or
revised revenue estimates indicated that the legislation would increase the
deficit.
"There were two things 1 was afraid this bill was going to do: increase
the deficit and provide fewer incentives for savings and investment," said
Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.), a leading opponent of the measure. "It has
done both."
Quick action to address the shortfall is unlikely because the chairmen of
the House and Senate tax-writing committees have expressed reluctance to
amend the law except for noncontroversial technical corrections.
A spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Ros
tenkowski (D-Ill.) said Rostenkowski probably will continue to oppose any
tax increase unless President Reagan requests one.
Iran opens second front in war
WASHINGTON — Iran yesterday opened up a second front in its war
with Iraq, increasing the military and political pressure on the Baghdad
government in what Western analysts here said could be a prelude to a
long-heralded "final offensive."
Radio Tehran said Iranian troops had recaptured a chain of strategic hills
about 90 miles northeast of Baghdad that were occupied by Iraqis at the
beginning of the six-year-old war. According to U.S. military observers, the
Iranians have also managed to retain two footholds of Iraqi territory south
of the southern city of Basra that they seized last Friday.
The Iraqi news agency conceded that the Iranians had mounted a new at
tack in the central sector of the 730-mile front near the Iranian town of
Sumar but claimed that the enemy was prevented from crossing the inter
national border.
"This looks like the seventh game in the World Series," said one U.S. mil
itary analyst. He added, however, that there was a difference of opinion
within the administration over whether an all-out Iranian offensive was im
minent.
Several military analysts out of government speculated that U.S. arms
deliveries to Iran had provided a psychological and military boost to Teh
ran at a time when its economy has been disrupted by Iraqi air attacks.
Waite: good progress in efforts
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite reported "good
progress" yesterday in his efforts to free American and other foreign
hostages in Lebanon and said he was greatly encouraged by the support ex
pressed for his mission.
His upbeat remarks came despite failure earlier yesterday to win an out
right pledge of support from the nation's strongest Shiite Moslem militia
and despite an announcement from Saudi Arabia that an employee at its
embassy was kidnapped in Moslem West Beirut Monday night.
Eighteen foreigners now are missing in Lebanon — six Americans, six
Frenchmen, two Britons, one Italian, one Irishman, one South Korean and
the Saudi Arabian. „ 4i •* , . , , . „
Waite advised "foreign correspondents who want to come to this part of
Beirut not to come for the time being."
Waite said his concern sprang from the abduction Tuesday of French
reporter-photographer Roger Auque, the 13th foreign journalist kidnapped
in West Beirut since Moslem militias seized control from the army in
February 1984. Seven have escaped or have been set free.
"And I advise Westerners who are still living in this part of Beirut to take
extreme precautions," Waite told a news conference.
Hinckley released for half day
WASHINGTON — John Hinckley Jr., who shot President Reagan and
three others in 1981, left the grounds of the mental hospital where he is
confined on a 12-hour pass for a reunion with his family.
The Secret Service, charged with protecting the president and other offi
cials, strongly objected to the Dec. 28 pass, but could not prevail on hospi
tal officials to revoke it, said Richard Adams, an agency spokesman.
"This was a decision made by the hospital. It was a medical decision they
made over our objections," he said adding that the agency had been
notified about a week in advance of Hinckley's release.
Reagan was vacationing in California at the time, but Adams said, "Our
evaluation of Mr. Hinckley hasn't changed. We still feel him to be a threat to
our protectees."
Adams said Hinckley, who was escorted by hospital personnel, spent the
entire pass at a Reston, Va., facility of the Prison Fellowship Ministries.
The spokesman declined to say how Hinckley was monitored, but said,
"We were aware of his release, and we were aware of all his movements."
Report of resurgence in racism
WASHINGTON — "Black Americans enter 1987 besieged by the resur
gence of raw racism, persistent economic depression, and the continued
erosion of past gains," National Urban League President John Jacob
charged yesterday in releasing the league's annual report on "The State of
Black America."
Jacob said the report shows that blacks are making no progress in catch
ing up with other Americans economically and are losing ground in civil
rights, in large part because of Reagan administration policies, and that
they have suffered severely from Reagan's cuts in federal programs for low
income people.
The report is composed of many studies by leading scholars. In the arti
cle on economic status of blacks, David Swinton, director of the Southern
Center for Studies in Public Policy at Clark College in Atlanta, said that
despite "modest improvements in the economic conditions of black
Americans in 1985 and 1986" following the sharp economic decline of the
early Reagan years, the "deep recession that has gripped the black commu
nity throughout the Reagan era has continued."
In a chapter on civil rights, Julius Chambers, director-counsel of the
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said, "This administration, led
principally by the Justice Department, (has) mounted vigorous efforts in a
number of areas to halt civil-rights progress and to reverse past gains" and
"to create a legal climate that encourages lack of enforcement of civil
rights."
Governor blasts school chief
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deukmejian condemned state schools
Superintendent Bill Honig yesterday as a "demagogue" for criticizing his
budget proposal for California schools, saying Honig's vow to mobilize the
public to seek more state funds for schools is "totally irresponsible.
Honig replied by repeating his intention to mount a public campaign to
pressure Deukmejian to increase his budget for schools But Honig, a poli
tical independent, took a more conciliatory stance than Deukmejian and
refused to respond to the Republican governor's description of him as a
demagogue.
Instead. Honig described Deukmejian's budget, which proposes an over
all 4 percent increase for schools, as a "mistake" and that Ive got a re
sponsibility to point that out and persuade Deukmejian to give schools
more monev.
