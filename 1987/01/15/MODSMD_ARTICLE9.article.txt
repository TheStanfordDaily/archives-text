# Conrail crew used marijuana
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Both crewmen of
the Conrail locomotive that ran a stop
signal and slid into the path of a speed
ing Amtrak passenger train were found
to have marijuana in their system at the
time of the accident, federal inves
tigators said yesterday.
One source close to the investiga
tion said the amounts of marijuana in
blood and urine samples taken from
the two men within hours of the Jan. 4
accident near Baltimore were "a suffi
cient amount" to indicate possible
chronic or recent use of the drug.
It remained uncertain, however,
whether the marijuana was sufficient to
have affected the performance of the
engineer or brakeman at the time of
the accident, said the source, who
asked not to be identified.
Meanwhile, motor vehicle officials
in Maryland confirmed that the en
gineer, Robert Gates, has a number of
motor vehicle violations. They said he

was cited for speeding and negligent
driving in the past, and last month was
arrested for drunken driving.
The Federal Railroad Administra
tion, which released the test results,
said in a statement, The find-ings do
not constitute an allegation of fault or
determination of probable cause" and
will be considered along with other
evidence developed during the investi
gation under way by the National
Transportation Safety Board.
There was no comment from NTSB
officials.
The tests on Gates, 32, an 11-year
employee of Conrail, and the
brakeman, Edward Cromwell, showed
no evidence of alcohol in either of the
men.
Tests on tissue samples of the
Amtrak engineer, who along with 15
passengers was killed in the accident,
showed no evidence of either alcohol
or illegal drugs, the Federal Railroad

Administration said. The tests were
conducted by the Civil Aeromedical In
stitute in Oklahoma City.
The investigation into the accident,
the worst in Amtrak history, has
focused on the performance of the
locomotive crew because investigators
have been unable to find any evidence
that either the locomotive equipment
or track signal system had malfunc
tioned.
The three linked-up Conrail
locomotives went through several
warning signals and a halt signal
before sliding into the path of the
Anitrak train, which was traveling at
105 miles per hour on impact.
The speed of the Conrail locomotive
has been estimated to be about 64
mph, substantially above speed restric
tions imposed near the track inter
change.
In addition to the 16 fatalities, 175
people were injured in the collision.

The federal railroad agency said the
blood and urine samples from Gates,
who was uninjured in the accident,
were taken two hours after the colli
sion. The samples from Cromwell,
who suffered a broken leg, were ob
tained about 9 hours after the collision.
Federal regulations that went into ef
feet last February prohibit a railroad
employee from reporting to work im
paired by alcohol or drugs or possess
ing or using illegal drugs or alcohol
while at work.
Earlier yesterday, motor vehicle offi
cials in Maryland confirmed that Gates
has been cited for a variety of highway
traffic violations during the last 15
years including eight infractions for
speeding and one for negligent
driving. On Dec. 5, he was arrested in
Baltimore County on charges of run
ning a red light and drunken driving,
the officials said.
