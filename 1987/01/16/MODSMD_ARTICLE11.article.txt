# STDs pose national threat

### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
The federal government may be
making a mistake in facing "the most
important health issue of our day" —
protection against sexually transmit
ted diseases (STDs), according to the
national director for the prevention
of STDs, Dr. Willard Cates.
"It appears we are going in the
wrong direction" by decreasing the
money states receive to fight STDs
such as herpes and chlamydia, a dan
gerous and difficult-to-detect
disease, said Cates, divisional direc
tor of STD prevention for the Center
for Disease Control in Atlanta.
Our ability to detect, treat and
diagnose STDs is related to the
money available," he said.
Cates, speaking before a crowd of
150 at Fairchild Auditorium yester
day, said President Reagan's pro
posed federal budget includes addi
tional funding for AIDS research but
would reduce the money states
receive for preventing other STDs.
Except for AIDS, most of today's
20 or more STDs have been around
for a long time but were recognized
only recently with medical advances.
All states currently receive a total
ol about $50 million annually for

prevention programs and would
receive $47 million under the ad
ministration's proposals. AIDS pre
vention programs would continue to
receive about $80 million, Cates said.
The number of people at risk for
STDs increased greatly in the 1970s
and early 80s as the baby boom gen
eration aged to fill the highest risk
group for the diseases while at the
same time adopting liberal sexual
norms, Cates said.
But in spite of an increase in the
number of people at risk to contract
STDs and a decrease in federal fund
ing for prevention of some diseases,
Cates said he is optimistic the nation
will soon "gain leverage in the con
trol" of the diseases.
"People are much more aware
now of the risks of what they're
doing," he said.
Cates hailed safe sex, including
the use of protective barriers, such
as condoms.
"I'd love to see (the use of con
doms) become a faddish sort of be
havior," he said. "People would
begin to expect contraception."
Treatment and prevention of STDs
is difficult in America because of
societal taboos, Cates said, noting

that few magazines print contracep
tive ads "but many still use all sorts
of sexual innuendo to sell everything
(else.)"
"There's a stigma associated with
any sexually related event. (Venereal
disease) is not treated like any other
disease" because of a popular moral
and mental set implying that people
with these diseases "are at fault."
Cates said mandatory tests or
quarantines for diseases such as
AIDS can have a negative influence
and drive people who need treat
ment "underground."
"We're on the cutting edge of
weighing issues of civil liberties and
public health," he said. "There are
no simplistic answers."
Cates spoke about national policy
and trends in prevention as part of a
new course entitled "Biosocial
Aspects of Sexually Transmitted
Diseases," designed by Sylvia Cerel
Bowen, a third-year medical student.
The lecture series is sponsored by
the Human Biology Program and
several other University or
ganizations.
The course is the first interdis
ciplinary course on STD for under
graduates in the nation.
