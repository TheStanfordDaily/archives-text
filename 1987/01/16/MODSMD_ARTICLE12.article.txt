# Profs, differ on dollar issue
## 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Although the Reagan administration
has quietly encouraged a decline of the
dollar to both lower the rising trade
deficit and narrow the nation's current
trade imbalance, scholars here differ
on the outcome of this policy.
Walter Hoadley, a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution, said
he blames the trade imbalance on the
reluctance of Western European
countries and Japan to strengthen their
nations' currency.

"The U.S. administration feels it can't
carry the economic burden of the
world and is asking its friends in Ger
many and Japan to improve their
economies," Hoadley said.
However, Economics Prof. Ronald
McKinnon disagreed, faulting instead
the administration with fiscal irrespon
sibility and said the debt crisis has fos
tered the trade imbalance.
The Reagan administration decided
to let the dollar fall in order to
decrease the trade deficit, which
reached a record $175 billion in 1986,
to The New York Times.

Despite attempts by the Bank of Japan
and the Bundesbank to keep the dollar
high, it continued to decline.
Hoadley said the U.S. government is
involved in a "chicken fight" with the
governments of Japan and Germany
over the trade deficit. Calling con
trolled deflation a signal "that we can
play hardball too," Hoadley said,
"Neither Germany nor Japan is making
an effort. Our foreign friends are living
on the trade deficit."
McKinnon, however, said the trade
debt stems not from the exchange rate
but from extensive foreign investment.
"I don't think it (the Reagan adminis
tration's theory) is right analytically,
and it's certainly not right empirically."
The two scholars also disagreed on
the extent of Western Europe and
Japan's direct responsibility for the
large deficit.
Hoadlev said Germany and Japan

used the U.S. marketplace for their
own economic advantage. He said that
while "the administration is eager to
get growth started" the two countries
are relying on the U.S. economy rather
than developing their own.
"Japan and Germany feel that they're
doing fine," he said.
McKinnon, however, does not hold
Japan or Germany nearly as respon
sible for the current trade imbalance.
He said Japan and Germany supplied
the necessary capital to finance the
federal budget.
