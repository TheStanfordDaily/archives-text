For some, those who appreciate Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday the most seem to be the Tahoe resorts, as
Stanford students scurry off to go skiing during the
three-day weekend.
However, yesterday's visit by the Rev. Jesse Jackson
refocused the Stanford community's perspective on
King's birthday and was important for many reasons.
First, it was a coup for the Black Student Union and a
fitting honor for that organization's 20th birthday to draw
such a noted speaker to campus. BSU Chair Amanda
Kemp and her group should be commended for an ef
fort akin to the Stanford Republicans bringing President
Reagan to Stanford for Presidents Day.
The effort is also noteworthy because the BSU
received help in engaging Jackson. The cooperation ex
hibited between the BSU, President's Office, Speakers
Bureau, Memorial Church and Stanford-in-Government
in raising Jackson's honorarium bodes well for the fu
ture.

Sadly, however, there was a pressing need to have
Jackson commemorate King's birthday on a college
campus. As the fight against racism continues, univer
sities seem to have taken a step backward.
Recently there has been a racial incident at The Citadel
and a rash of racial violence at the University of Massa
chusetts at Amherst as well as at several other schools in
Western Massachusetts. These affairs show that sup
posedly enlightened college students are really not that
much farther from the Dark Ages than the residents of
Howard Beach.
King proved prescient in his Stanford speech nearly 20
years ago when he talked of repenting not only for bad
people but also for good people "who have the ... no
tion that time will cure all evil."
As the past two decades have shown, time has not
cured all the evil of racism, and we must hold onto the
words Jackson spoke yesterday when he said, "long live
the spirit of Martin Luther King, the king of love, power
and justice. His dream is America's hope."
