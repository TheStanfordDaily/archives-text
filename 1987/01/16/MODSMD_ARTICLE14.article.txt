Faculty Senate
followed procedure
At the meeting of the Faculty Senate
on Jan. 8, 1987, Herbert Lindenberger,
professor of comparative literature
and English, did not "make a motion
to establish an ad hoc committee to
review the decision to close the
Vienna program as well as to provide
an overview of current Overseas
Studies policy," as was reported in
The Stanford Daily on Jan. 9, 1987. His
motion was intended only to re
establish a standing Academic Council
committee to formulate policy and
exercise oversight for the Overseas
Studies Program and to report regu
larly to the senate. The exact wording
for his motion was taken from the
1982 Inkeles report.
During the course of that senate
discussion on developments in the
Overseas Studies Program, the senate,
by consensus, granted permission for

a senate guest (Prof. Emeritus Kurt
Steiner) to present a statement pro
testing the closure of the Vienna
program, but senate guests may not
move any legislative action or vote on
a motion before the senate. No mo
tion currently before the senate would
mandate a review of the decision to
close the Vienna program.

Anonymous letter
is not very funny
The anonymous letter lambasting
the Chaparral's White Plaza antics
sounds like yet another Chappie
attempt to increase sales by creating
controversy. Like the "stolen" Chapar
ral hammer of a couple of years ago,
it's probably another self-perpetuated
hoax that just isn't that funny.

University should
pay for mistake
The University should offer to
reimburse students who were affected
by the recent inadvertent listing of
some 300 "unlisted" phone numbers
in the 1986-87 Stanford Student Direc
tory (Daily, Jan. 12).
Professor Franklin asserts that the
resulting harm is probably not
enough to constitute a legal invasion
of privacy, and he may be right.
However, in the interest offairness
alone, the University should agree to
reimburse those of the roughly 300
students who:
•maintain a number not listed in the
local (Pacific Bell) directory,
•had that number published despite
their request
• and wish to change that number to a
new unlisted number,
for the cost of the change.
