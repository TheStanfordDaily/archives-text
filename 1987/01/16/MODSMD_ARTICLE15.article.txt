# Soviets not superior in Europe
## 
### 
In his letter "Soviets superior in Europe" (Daily, Jan. 7),
Kurt Webber asserts that contrary to other writers' claims,
"the Warsaw Pact has overwhelming conventional superior
ity over NATO." He seems to base his contention on several
alleged deficiencies in NATO's conventional forces. His ar
guments, however, fall far short of military reality and leave
out many aspects of the current conventional balance that
point to — if anything — Warsaw Pact inferiority in light of a
war in Central Europe.

VICTOR L. VESCOVO

The first issue he brings up is the alleged weaknesses of
modern Anti-tank Guided Munitions (ATGM) that constitute
a strong component of NATO's defense against a Warsaw
Pact invasion. While Webber's assertion is true that current
systems have drawbacks — mainly slow flight time and vul
nerability to artillery and other fire — the sheer number of
the missiles in use and the ambush tactics to be employed
by our forces will minimize their weaknesses. Also, many of
the ATGMs are deployed on armored vehicles, like the
Bradley armored personnel carrier, which are relatively
well protected. New ATGMs currently coming into service
like the U.S. "Hellfire" missile use laser target acquisition.
This enables the missile to be aimed by someone other than
the fire controller and thus makes it nearly impossible to
neutralize the missile's operator. The Hellfire also possesses
a warhead that is large enough to destroy the armor of any
tank in the Soviet armory, even those protected by Chob
ham armor. By Webber's own statistics, it is absurd to
believe that 13 ATGMs to every Warsaw Pact tank would give
the Soviet Union "overwhelming" superiority despite the
ATGM s inadequacies.
Webber also fails to note the effectiveness of NATO's
armored units and their associated tanks. While he admits
that the best way to defeat a tank is with another tank, he
ignores the fact that the NATO alliance has large tank forces
with undoubtedly the best equipment in the world. While
they may be outnumbered, their superb training relative to
their Soviet counterparts and the advantages of defense
would aive NATO the edge in any future conflict.
One of the most glaring omissions that Webber makes is
his total refusal to mention the role of air and helicopter
forces of the contending sides. Any intelligent military ob
server would tell you that here the NATO alliance enjoys a
considerable edge in aircraft quality and personnel over the
Warsaw Pact. The NATO air wings have invested heavily in
ground attack forces like the A-10 Thunderbolt and Apache
helicopter that would help equalize the great advantage the
Pact has in armor. Given a reasonable amount of time to
mobilize its air assets — around a week — NATO would be
in a very strong position to affect the land battle with super
ior air power.
As to Webber's assertion that the Soviets' leading ec
helons possess the latest equipment," he fails to mention
how inadequate they would be relative to the West. While it
is true that the T-80 and T-"'2 tanks are powerful machines,
they are simply inferior to their Western counterparts like
the U.S. M-l, the West German Leopard-2 and the British
Challenger main battle tanks The Warsaw Pact forces do not
have anything near the expertise and training of the NATO
tank crews, and their machines tend to break down far more

often. Ask any NATO commander if he would switch tanks
with his Eastern adversary, and I doubt you would find a
single taker.
Webber neglects to mention many of the command and
control problems the Soviets would face, from the question
able reliability of Eastern European formations to the lan
guage difficulties among Soviet units. These and other
logistical problems that are so easily left out of "tank
counting" are very real problems for the Warsaw Pact and
cannot be dismissed easily. When these aspects are as
sessed, it becomes evident that die Pact is not even close to
the threatening ogre it is made out to be.
As to chemical warfare, Webber is correct in claiming that
the Soviet Union has a great deal of capability in this area.
Yet he neglects the extreme political costs of chemical use
on a wide scale. There would be horrendous civilian
casualties in West and East Germany that could make
chemical weapons just as economically and politically
damaging as the use of nuclear weapons. He also neglects
the fact that the equipment of the Warsaw Pact forces to deal
with chemical retaliation by the West is greatly inferior to
our own and thus make chemical initiation coun
terproductive. As to NATO's "(not having) a credible offen
sive chemical warfare capability," one need only to look at
current U.S. production of binary chemical rounds, existing
chemical stocks and our not inconsequential aircraft chemi
cal spray tanks to prove this incorrect. In any exchange, it
would be at best an even exchange for the Soviet Union.
One interesting thing to note is that one of the reasons the
Soviet Union appears to have more men in their "chemical
forces" is because they consider smoke a chemical weapon.
Thus, a lot of the troops they would consider chemical per
sonnel in our armies we would designate as something else.
As Webber states at the conclusion of his piece, "statistics
can be misleading." I couldn't agree more. Yet he himself
makes the mistake of "what he chooses to ignore." The most
glaring point that is not brought up, and is almost neier
mentioned, is that even if the NATO alliance does not have
numerical equality with the Warsaw Pact, it does not mean
we have an insufficient deterrent. One must remember that,
in offensive operations in order for an attack to succeed on
the modern battlefield, one needs at least a three-to-one su
periority against a well-equipped defender. Even with opti
mistic forecasts of Pact performance, the potential for a
NATO defeat is slim. Virtually all military scholars would
also point out that the only hope the Warsaw Pact has of vic
tory is in a short war before the West can mobilize its super
ior military' reserves and economic potential.
One cannot simply count numbers of tanks and artillery
and from there decide who has a military advantage. That is
only the first step of military analysis. Other, less precise,
variables like level of training and leadership are just as im
portant.
Fighting on their home ground with unsurpassed quality
of personnel, technologically superior forces and the advan
tage of defense, the balance between East and West in
Europe, is at worst, parity. While the West should continue
to invest heavily in the conventional defense of Europe and
acknowledge potential threats to our security, we should
not become the victims of senseless and irrational threat in
flation.

by our forces will minimize their weaknesses. Also, many of
the ATGMs are deployed on armored vehicles, like the
Bradley armored personnel carrier, which are relatively
well protected. New ATGMs currently coming into service
like the U.S. "Hellfire" missile use laser target acquisition.
This enables the missile to be aimed by someone other than
the fire controller and thus makes it nearly impossible to
neutralize the missile's operator. The Hellfire also possesses
a warhead that is large enough to destroy the armor of any
tank in the Soviet armory, even those protected by Chob
ham armor. By Webber's own statistics, it is absurd to
believe that 13 ATGMs to every Warsaw Pact tank would give
the Soviet Union "overwhelming" superiority despite the
ATGM s inadequacies.
Webber also fails to note the effectiveness of NATO's
armored units and their associated tanks. While he admits
that the best way to defeat a tank is with another tank, he
ignores the fact that the NATO alliance has large tank forces
with undoubtedly the best equipment in the world. While
they may be outnumbered, their superb training relative to
their Soviet counterparts and the advantages of defense
would aive NATO the edge in any future conflict.
One of the most glaring omissions that Webber makes is
his total refusal to mention the role of air and helicopter
forces of the contending sides. Any intelligent military ob
server would tell you that here the NATO alliance enjoys a
considerable edge in aircraft quality and personnel over the
Warsaw Pact. The NATO air wings have invested heavily in
ground attack forces like the A-10 Thunderbolt and Apache
helicopter that would help equalize the great advantage the
Pact has in armor. Given a reasonable amount of time to
mobilize its air assets — around a week — NATO would be
in a very strong position to affect the land battle with super
ior air power.
As to Webber's assertion that the Soviets' leading ec
helons possess the latest equipment," he fails to mention
how inadequate they would be relative to the West. While it
is true that the T-80 and T-"'2 tanks are powerful machines,
they are simply inferior to their Western counterparts like
the U.S. M-l, the West German Leopard-2 and the British
Challenger main battle tanks The Warsaw Pact forces do not
have anything near the expertise and training of the NATO
tank crews, and their machines tend to break down far more

often. Ask any NATO commander if he would switch tanks
with his Eastern adversary, and I doubt you would find a
single taker.
Webber neglects to mention many of the command and
control problems the Soviets would face, from the question
able reliability of Eastern European formations to the lan
guage difficulties among Soviet units. These and other
logistical problems that are so easily left out of "tank
counting" are very real problems for the Warsaw Pact and
cannot be dismissed easily. When these aspects are as
sessed, it becomes evident that die Pact is not even close to
the threatening ogre it is made out to be.
As to chemical warfare, Webber is correct in claiming that
the Soviet Union has a great deal of capability in this area.
Yet he neglects the extreme political costs of chemical use
on a wide scale. There would be horrendous civilian
casualties in West and East Germany that could make
chemical weapons just as economically and politically
damaging as the use of nuclear weapons. He also neglects
the fact that the equipment of the Warsaw Pact forces to deal
with chemical retaliation by the West is greatly inferior to
our own and thus make chemical initiation coun
terproductive. As to NATO's "(not having) a credible offen
sive chemical warfare capability," one need only to look at
current U.S. production of binary chemical rounds, existing
chemical stocks and our not inconsequential aircraft chemi
cal spray tanks to prove this incorrect. In any exchange, it
would be at best an even exchange for the Soviet Union.
One interesting thing to note is that one of the reasons the
Soviet Union appears to have more men in their "chemical
forces" is because they consider smoke a chemical weapon.
Thus, a lot of the troops they would consider chemical per
sonnel in our armies we would designate as something else.
As Webber states at the conclusion of his piece, "statistics
can be misleading." I couldn't agree more. Yet he himself
makes the mistake of "what he chooses to ignore." The most
glaring point that is not brought up, and is almost neier
mentioned, is that even if the NATO alliance does not have
numerical equality with the Warsaw Pact, it does not mean
we have an insufficient deterrent. One must remember that,
in offensive operations in order for an attack to succeed on
the modern battlefield, one needs at least a three-to-one su
periority against a well-equipped defender. Even with opti
mistic forecasts of Pact performance, the potential for a
NATO defeat is slim. Virtually all military scholars would
also point out that the only hope the Warsaw Pact has of vic
tory is in a short war before the West can mobilize its super
ior military' reserves and economic potential.
One cannot simply count numbers of tanks and artillery
and from there decide who has a military advantage. That is
only the first step of military analysis. Other, less precise,
variables like level of training and leadership are just as im
portant.
Fighting on their home ground with unsurpassed quality
of personnel, technologically superior forces and the advan
tage of defense, the balance between East and West in
Europe, is at worst, parity. While the West should continue
to invest heavily in the conventional defense of Europe and
acknowledge potential threats to our security, we should
not become the victims of senseless and irrational threat in
flation.

In his letter "Soviets superior in Europe" (Daily, Jan. 7),
Kurt Webber asserts that contrary to other writers' claims,
"the Warsaw Pact has overwhelming conventional superior
ity over NATO." He seems to base his contention on several
alleged deficiencies in NATO's conventional forces. His ar
guments, however, fall far short of military reality and leave
out many aspects of the current conventional balance that
point to — if anything — Warsaw Pact inferiority in light of a
war in Central Europe.

The first issue he brings up is the alleged weaknesses of
modern Anti-tank Guided Munitions (ATGM) that constitute
a strong component of NATO's defense against a Warsaw
Pact invasion. While Webber's assertion is true that current
systems have drawbacks — mainly slow flight time and vul
nerability to artillery and other fire — the sheer number of
