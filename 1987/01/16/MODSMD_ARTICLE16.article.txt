# Remembering Gandhi
## 
### 
On Jan. 30, 1948, Mahatma Gandhi, a national leader of
his own traditions, was assassinated. The murder was con
spired by a group of religious fanatics. After 39 years, we are
still trying to decide how he should be remembered.
Undoubtedly, he possessed a complex and perplexing
personality. By selectively looking at his life, he could be
presented as a holy guru as well as a shrewd trickster. Per
haps, such was the character of the realities of colonial In
dia, from which the character of a national figure like
Gandhi cannot be divorced.

While living with the political, economic and cultural
realities of a society, the leaders do have limited but positive
opportunities to affect them for the good of a majority of the
population. The greatness of a leader, in my opinion, lies in
his availing of such opportunities. In this sense, Gandhi's
most important contribution appears to be his multi
religious practice, aimed at ending all forms of religious
prejudice. For many, this viewpoint may be new and some
what surprising, but I hope to make a convincing case in this
small essay.
Nonviolent activism is perhaps the most well-known of
Gandhi's teachings. For many people, especially in the West,
Gandhi is a symbol of nonviolent struggle â€” a cult whose
real role in the politics is not of much interest. Creating a
legend out of a real person is not always a negative act but it
does not sound appropriate if the person is a pan of the
very recent history. Ignoring the real Gandhi is unfair to the
people of India who are not just enjoying the fruits of his
wisdom but are also paying the price of his misconceptions
and biases in the form of continued misery and poverty
during the post-independence existence.
Attributing the independence of India to Gandhi's pacifist
struggles is far from an accurate account of the facts.
Freedom of India, the way it came, has been interpreted by
many as mainly a result of the European wars which
weakened the colonial power and rendered her unable to
directly manage the huge colonial venture of Southern Asia.
It is not just in hindsight that one gives such an explanation;
a visionary Indian politician, M.N. Roy, had predicted the
coming of independence as far back as the early 19205.
"From a backward colonial possession," wrote Roy, "India
will become a modern industrial country, 'Member of the
British Commonwealth of free nations.' India is in a process
of 'decolonization' insofar as the policy, forced upon im
perialism by the post-war crisis of capitalism, abolishes the
old, antiquated forms and methods of colonial exploitation
in favor of new forms and new methods."
About a quarter century later, the truth of this prophecy
was duly proven. Since the plans for freedom of India seem
to have been masterminded by the British prior to Gandhi's
rise to the national leadership, it would not be a gross over
simplification to consider Gandhi's nonviolent movements
as redundant as far as political independence is concerned.
On many occasions, Gandhi is known to have ignored
and even opposed demands for real independence from
factions of Indian population. In 1921, a peasants' uprising

in the southern pan of India was brutally suppressed by the
colonial authorities. Unlike the massacre of Indians at Jul
lianwallah Bagh on the directions of a colonial official, the
massacre that followed the peasants' revolt is not very fre
quently mentioned in the historical accounts of the colonial
India. At that time, it was successfully covered up by the
authorities and portrayed as a communal riot. Unfortun
ately, Gandhi went along with the official policy and ex
pressed anxiety about the "strains inflicting upon the
Hindu-Muslim relationship" rather than showing concerns
about the killing of thousands of the peasants by the
colonial forces. Many believe that this kind of alienation
from the people had to play a role (though minor) in even
tual partition of India.
For those who believe in the power of the labor move
ments for positive social changes, Gandhi was a notorious
saboteur always willing to undercut the labor militancy.
Another of Gandhi's main messages that has received
serious attention is that of economic anarchism (i.e., "small
is beautiful"). Though a critical approach toward blind tech
nological expansion is desirable, Gandhi was no less an ex
tremist in this respect than in his idea of birth control solely
through sexual abstinence and a disapproval of all forms of
contraception.
In pursuance of religious unity, Gandhi's role was neither
redundant nor extreme. Emerging from a very spiritual so
ciety, he understood the value of religion to the common
people. Karl Marx had claimed, "religion is the sigh of the
oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the
soul of soulless conditions," but in the same breath he had
condemned religion as "the opium of the people." This
mixture of positive and negative connotations about reli
gion had left his followers confused as far as formulation of
a policy toward religion was concerned. Gandhi did not
make this mistake. He himself became an example of a spiri
tual person who could fight against religious prejudices. He
followed a multi-religious practice.
Critics say that he did not truly represent the multi
religious spirit because his appearance, writings and
speeches were full of Hindu symbolism with very little hints
of other Indian religions. There is some truth in this cri
tique. However, it is also true that his expressed adherence
to several religions alienated the fanatics from him and
ensured him the sympathies and support of the bulk of non
fanatics among all the religious communities. A clear display
of this trust was seen when he brought to an end a horren
dous eruption of communal violence in the city of Calcutta
by submitting himself to a fast.
The unique religious movement that Gandhi led is a true
example of a leader affecting the realities of a society in a
positive manner. He made enemies in this process and
eventually sacrificed his life to the cause of religious unity.
Had his tradition of multi-religious practice further matured
and expanded into a substantial social movement, the situa
tion in the subcontinent India and the Middle East could be
positively different.
Such a movement is bound to run into a conflict with the
divisive doctrines cherished by the privileged few in the re
ligious establishments and may well prove to be the libera
tion theology of Southern Asia and the Middle East.
