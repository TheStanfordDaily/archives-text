### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
Speaking before a capacity crowd in
Memorial Auditorium yesterday, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson challenged Stanford
to adopt the new Western Culture
course, which focuses on women and
minorities, in an emotional speech
given in honor of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday.
Two hours after Jackson's speech,
the Faculty Senate approved the class.
Jackson praised King for his courage
and perseverance.
"Martin Luther King Jr. rose to
heights that were extraordinary be
cause of an unselfish character, a dis
ciplined mind, a desire to serve others
and a submission to and an obsession
to do God's will," Jackson said.
Jackson, who criticized President
Reagan repeatedly in his speech, made
several comments hinting that he may
declare his candidacy fcr the next
Democratic presidential nomination.
"We need more than a day of
celebration. We need a new presi
dent," Jackson said.
"America has been real good to me,
and I'll be real good to America,"he
said later.
Jackson, responding to a question
regarding his presidential prospects,
said he will have to look into family
and monetary considerations further
before he formally declares his can
didacy.
Turning to the Western Culture Pro
gram issue, Jackson urged the Univer
sity to add the proposed course to the
existing Western Culture classes,
which have been criticized for their in
attention to women and minorities.
"No one can be truly educated in the
world, limited to one language and
obsessed with one language," Jackson
said.

"All of us, red, yellow, brown, black
and white are precious in God's light
and every living human being is some
body worth respect and fellowship and
a chance," Jackson said.
"There's more culture than Western
culture," he added in a rally after his
speech.
The unfinished business of King is to
make America more humane, Jackson
said.
"I challenge our nation today not
just to be strong but to be good," Jack
son said.
Jackson was also outspoken on the
apartheid issue and called on Stanford
to divest completely from South Africa,
claiming that the United States is treat
ing South Africa with too much
tolerance and patience.
"You cannot be a great nation with
an economic surplus and a moral defi
cit," Jackson said.
Addressing domestic policy issues,
Jackson discussed the plight of
workers laid off from companies with
out notice and the uncertain future of
unsuccessful farmers.
"Farmers are driven from their land,
with no rural development program,
no urban development program, just
die? Highly humane! Where do they
go? Where's our morality for those
who have fed us ... ?" Jackson asked.
"If a mother has five children and
two pork chops, she will not run to a
computer and conclude she has three
excess children. If she is a merciful
mother, she'll cut two pork chops up
in five pieces and make gravy because
her management is driven by her
mercy," Jackson said.
Jackson hailed King as an apostle of
nonviolence for his civil rights efforts,
and added that King's work was also

difficult during the beginning of the
Vietnam War era.
He "had the burden and the glory of
being a king of peace in a nation bent
on war," Jackson said.
King befriended Jackson in the mid
-19605, and the two worked together on

King's "Operation Breadbasket," an or
ganization working against dis
criminatory hiring practices.
For his appearance yesterday Jack
son was scheduled to receive an $8,000
honorarium primarily funded by the
BSl' and the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
In her introduction for Jackson, BSl T
Chair Amanda Kemp said "(Blacks)
want to be appreciated for our differ
ences, not in spite of them.
