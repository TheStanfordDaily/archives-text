## Carson, students gather King documents 
### DIANA RATHE 
On Monday, hundreds of newspaper
headlines across the country will prob
ably carry some twist on the words
from Martin Luther King Jr.'s most fa
mous speech, "I Have a Dream."
By declaring King's birthday a na
tional holiday last year, the federal gov
ernment has ensured that the black
minister will be remembered at least
once a year for his key role in the civil
rights struggle of the 19605.
For a group on the Stanford campus,
however, King is more than just a sym
bol of civil rights in America.
In a small office in Meyer Library,
people work all year on the Martin Lut
her King Jr. Papers Project, gathering
and editing letters, sermons, speeches,
news articles and any other significant
writing by or about King.
Piecing together these significant
documents, the King Papers Project
will trace King's intellectual develop
ment and examine the origins, tactics
and ideologies of the civil rights move
ment.
The project was started in 1984 by
the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change, based in At
lanta, Ga. Stanford became involved in
1985 when Coretta Scott King, the Cen
ter's president, asked Associate History
Prof. Clay Carson to be the senior
editor and director of the project.

Carson is an expert on contempo
rary black politics. He began teaching
at Stanford in 1974 and has taught a
history course dealing specifically with
the 19605. His book, "In Struggle: The
Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee and the Black Awakening
of the 19605," won the Frederick Jack
son Turner Award of the Organization
of American Historians.
The King Papers Project will cul
minate in a scholarly edition of 12
volumes that will be published
chronologically over the next 15 years.
"We expect Volume I to be finished
in about three years," Carson said. The
700-page volume will cover King's fam
ily background and early writings, in
cluding his dissertation from the Bos
ton University School of Theology.
Work on the King Papers Project is
divided between Stanford and the King
Center in Atlanta. Carson said he flies
to Atlanta about once a month to con
fer with the people there about the
project.
Currently, two full-time and six to 12
part-time people, many of them stu
dents, are working on the project at
Stanford.
The King Papers Project has offered
these students a unique opportunity to
get involved. Both undergraduates and
graduate students have earned money
or academic credit in various aspects
of the project.
"People take on the jobs that they
are interested in, or that they demon

strate an ability to do," Carson said.
Junior Andrew Patzman, a history
major, spent last quarter tracing King's
geneology. He said he "answered the
easy questions'' about King's ancestors
but ran into difficulties when he
reached the mid- 1800s.
"Most of the records tend to dry up
around then because births, marriages
and deaths of slaves just weren't re
corded," Patzman said. He has sent out
leners to churches and other places,
hoping some of them have kept infor
mation.
Patzman and graduate student Kath
erine Weinert plan to incorporate the
information into an "introductory- es
say" for Volume I of the project.
"We'll try to paint as accurate a
picture of black life in Georgia as pos
sible, especially in terms of the King
family," Patzman said. The essay will
examine the role of the black church
in the South, as well as the civic activi
ties of King's father, grandfather and
great grandfather, who were all minis
ters, he said.
Patzman said that working on the
project has been even more interesting
than he expected.
"This has stengthened my interest in
history as a discipline," he said. "To
see history in the process of being
written is great. This is what historians
do."
The amount of writing involved in a
project this size could easily dis
courage all but the most ambitious. But
computers have helped knock years off
the process.
Carson, who spent two years after
college programming computers, has
been instrumental in organizing the
use of computers in the project. He is a
participant in Stanford's Advanced
Education Project, "a long-term study
of novel applications of computers in a
scholarly environment."
In addition to editing and indexing
the documents on a computer, Carson
said he has hooked up a modem be
tween the Stanford and Atlanta offices
for transferring files.
Meltin Bell, a junior majoring in
electrical engineering, was hired as a
computer consultant for the project
through Stanford's Work Study Pro
gram.
Bell installs and maintains programs
for the project. Last quarter he assisted
with the "guide," the general overview

and index to the project that was then
printed out and put in a binder for ref
erence.
Bell said he and Carson have been
considering using some new technol
ogy for preparing and entering all the
documents for publication.
The system they are looking at
"reads" text into a mainframe com
puter.
"It scans letters and spaces much
like a grocery store scanner reads a bar
code," saving the fingers and patience
of the person in charge of data entry,
Bell said.

The King Papers Project has given
Bell some valuable experience outside
his field of study. "I've always been a
math, engineering, computer science
type," he said. "I'm also only 21, so I
didn't know what was really going on
during the '60s.
"But looking at the actual docu
ments, not just somebody's interpreta
tion of an interpretation, is incredible.
They describe exactly what was hap
pening with the struggle," Bell said.
Carson brought personal experi
ence as well as scholarship to the King
Papers Project. He had been active in
various nonviolent civil rights groups

during the 1960s while he was a stu
dent.
He said he hitchhiked to his first
demonstration in 1963, which hap
pened to be the march on Washington,
D C., where King gave his "I Have a
Dream" speech.
"I was a freshman at the University
of New Mexico at the time," Carson
said. "Not being from the South, it was
hard to put everything into perspec
tive."
Carson spent his last two years of
college at UCLA and experienced the
race riots there firsthand.
"I was a junior when the Watts riots
blew up" he said. "I'd never seen any
thing like it — streets in flames."
Carson said he and his friends were
beaten by police with nightsticks. He
considers himself lucky he wasn't
killed.
"After all," he said,"in riot situations,
who is going to question if it was self
defense? '
In addition to his professorial and
project editorial duties, Carson has
served as an adviser to the new video
teaching series, "Eyes of the Prize," a
history of the civil rights movement.
He was also an editor of the accompa
nying textbook.
Carson said a current course offered
by the Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues (SWOPSI) is de
signed around the series.
Carson has mixed feelings about the
holiday for King's birthday.
When you look at holiday legisla
tion, and see the signatures of Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, you have to
think, 'Yeah, they might not have the
same motivation I have,' " Carson said.
"But whatever motivations led politi
cal leaders to establish the holiday, my
role is to make the celebration into
something and not let it become just
another Monday off," Carson said.
The King Papers Project has had an
exhibit of manuscripts, photographs
and tapes of important speeches by
King in Tresidder Union all week. The
exhibit ends today at 6 p.m.
"It's good to have a time every year
when people think about the salience
of racial issues in history and the need
for nonviolent solutions to problems,"
Carson said.
"You certainly don't need to look far
to see how these issues can tear apart a
society." J ■
