## Vineberg II, the sequel: Steve's best of '86 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Freshmen and sophomore readers
out there may have heard from junior
and senior old-timers that Stanford
isn't quite the hotbed of unrest that it
used to be. They weren't talking about
campus activism No, they meant how
people responded to the movie reviews
of the famed Steve Vineberg. From
1980 to 1985, Vineberg reigned as The
Daily's movie critic, championing
obscure art films and blasting Holly
wood schlock Steve's gone on to
become a professor of theater and film
at Holy Cross, but he stopped by
recently to pronounce judgment on
the films of '86. Sit tight, kids; you're in
for a treat. We hereby present the
return of Steve Vineberg in typically
epic style.
Something extraordinary happened
in American movies in 1986. For the
first time since the dawn of the Reagan
era, an exciting, experimental picture
got past the usual barbed wire fences
erected by inept producers, scared dis
tributors, conventional-minded critics
and disinterested audiences. In "Blue
Velvet," David Lynch fastened onto a
theme — the coexistence of
malevolent and benign energies in a
world that likes to define itself as safe
and protected — that hit enough
nerves in a Yuppiefied America to
generate the first authentic artistic con
troversy in movies since "Last Tango in
Paris" nearly a decade and a half ago.
This visionary film, which may be
the only great movie ever arrived at (in
this country, at least) by sheer intui
tion, met with a lot of hostility in some
corners. But it escaped the negligence
and premature burial that were the fate
of almost every audacious piece of
filmmaking released here over the last
six years — "The Stunt Man," "Blow
Out," "Pennies from Heaven," "Shoot
the Moon," "Personal Best," "Under
Fire," "The Right Stuff." "Blue Velvet"
and its companion piece, Jonathan
Demme's road comedy "Something
Wild," with its discover-as-you-travel
approach to narrative, represent new
explorations of an old subject: the in
terplay between the light and dark
sides of human interaction.
That's not to say 1986 brought less
garbage to the screens of America than
1985 or 1984. A dedicated moviegoer
could easily sink in the accumulated
glop of pictures like "Top Gun," "Short
Circuit," "Legal Eagles," "Ruthless
People," "Nothing in Common,"
"Heartburn," "Aliens," "Crocodile
Dundee," "Heartbreak Ridge" and that
Hallmark greeting card paean to pre
adolescence, "Stand by Me," which an
astonishing amount of critics hailed as
an important statement on coming of
age. (Movie critics' memories can be as
short as audiences': The response to
"Stand by Me" makes you wonder if
any of its cheerleaders had ever seen
"Sounder" or "Murmur of the Heart,"

or read "Huckleberry Finn,'' "The
Catcher in the Rye" or "The Member of
the Wedding".) The art house crowd,
meanwhile, went for dreary,
monotonous neo-"auteur" classics:
"Down by Law," "Round Midnight"
and "Sid and Nancy."
Once-talented directors like Walter
Hill, Ron Howard and Hal Ashby came
up with the sad likes of "Crossroads,"

"Gung Ho" and "38 Million Ways to
Die." Martin Scorsese, the only Ameri
can director who ever got close to con
veying the spirit of Dostoevski on the
screen (in "Mean Streets" and "Taxi
Driver"), went to video school and
learned how to assemble flashy, multi
collision pool sequences for "The
Color of Money," a movie that even, in
the final analysis, trashed the majestic
performance of its star, Paul Newman.
Brian De Palma's "Wise Guys" read
like a surrender. Woody Allen made a
pleasant, forgettable little movie about
how nice it felt to get out of analysis,
and adult audiences, starved for
pictures that starred neither a Muppet
nor a Brat Packster, seized on "Hannah
and Her Sisters" as if it were the
Second Coming. And Francis Coppola,
trying to fight his way back from the
dead, released this year's weirdest hit,
"Peggy Sue Got Married," which had a
penny-dreadful, time-travel-comedy
script filtered through a desolate tone.
"Peggy Sue," a bewildered botch of
a picture, is my choice for most
depressing experience at the movies
this year.
On the other hand, there were some
sweet surprises: the Carroll Ballard-
Maurice Sendak "Nutcracker," "Crimes
of the Heart," the first half of "The Fly"
(the screwball comedy part), "F/X." It

was surprising to see the British film
industry; "My Beautiful Laundrette,"
Mona Lisa" and "A Room with a View"
were practically the only English
language movies you could recom
mend to anyone in the late spring and
early summer. David Byrne became a
filmmaker this year with the charming,
if emotionally thin, "True Stories,"
which was like a post-modernist

footnote to Robert Altman's
"Nashville." And Oliver Stone, the au
thor of such unconscionable scripts as
"Midnight Express," "Scarface" and
"The Year of the Dragon," turned out
to be a gifted, incendiary director with
"Salvador" and "Platoon."
The following list encompasses the
movies and contributions to movies
that brought me the most pleasure in
1986.
Best Picture:
I.' Blue Velvet": David Lynch sets his
erotic fable in a small town called Lum
berton, where unseen insects buzz
portentously in the suburban grass and
a street called Meadow Lane may turn
up a freshly cut human ear. The movie
chronicles the sexual awakening of a
young man, played by Kyle MacLadilan
with so much sympathy and self
effacement that we experience it
through his skin. "Blue Velvet" sug
gests a collaboration between Norman
Rockwell and Max Ernst.
2."Platoon": The best movie anyone
has made so far about Vietnam. Maybe
it took a half-crazy macho vet like
Oliver Stone — who happens to be a
great filmmaker — to achieve what a
number of good liberals couldn't.
3."Something Wild": Jonathan
Demme begins with a familiar screw
ball comedy premise — a possibly

mad young woman (Melanie Griffith)
knocks a straight arrow (Jeff Daniels)
off course and helps him find his ec
centricities and, ultimately, his salva
tion — and takes it in fresh new direc
tions. The comedy of the year, with the
year's most joyous soundtrack (by
David Byrne and Celia Cruz, Sister
Carol East, The Feelies, The Fine
Young Cannibals, Jimmy Cliff, Jerry

Harrison, Oingo Boingo and many,
many others).
4."My Beautiful Laundrette": What's
amazing about this picture, written by
Hanif Kureishi and directed by Step
hen Frears, is that none of it is like any
thing you've seen in another movie.
Gordon Warnecke and the chameleon
performer Daniel Day Lewis play a
Pakistani and an Anglo whose love af
fair plays wittily against the back
ground of racial tensions in contempo
rary London.
s."Kaos": Vittorio and Paolo Taviani,
Italy's most explosive and unconven
tional directors, film four stories by
Luigi Pirandello. The first, "The Other
Son," is a masterpiece; the second,
"Moon Sickness," is an expressionistic
parody of a vampire picture, and very
funny. There's not much going on in
the third and fourth segments, but the
epilogue, in which Pirandello (Omer
Antonutti, of the Taviani brothers'
"Padre Padrone" and "Night of the
Shooting Stars") communes with the
spirit of his dead mother (Regina
Bianchi), is splendid — an epiphany.
6."Mona Lisa": The director Neil Jor
dan and the actor Bob Hoskins turn
what is essentially a cheap-hearted
FILM-NOIR about a third-rate hood and
a whore (Cathy Tyson) into a genuine
romance.

7. Salvador": Oliver Stone's first
directorial job of the year — a mine
field of a movie about El Salvador un
der Roberto D'Aubuisson, with a crack
ling, often hilarious performance by
James Woods that cuts through a lot of
gonzo-journalist sentimentality. Not to
be savored for its political acuteness,
but a hell of a movie.
B."The Best of Times": A comedy for
grownups. Robin Williams, Holly
Palance, Kurt Russell and Pamela Reed
play two couples who revisit the follies
of their youth — not by traveling
through time, but by replaying a foot
ball game — in order to rejuvenate
their middle age. Written by Ron Shel
ton and directed by Roger Spottis
woode, who also collaborated on
1983's "Under Fire."
9."The Decline of the American
Empire": A highly enjoyable gabfest
from the French-Canadian director
Denys Arcand. It consists of five men
and four women talking about sex —
and then, ever so casually, a betrayal
occurs that changes everything without
ruffling the serene surface of the
movie.
10."Down and Out in Beverly Hills":
Not Paul Mazursky's best movie, but
probably his funniest. Nick Nolte, Rich
ard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler give rich
comic performances in a West Coast
replay of Renoir's "Boudu Saved from
Drowning."

Freshmen and sophomore readers
out there may have heard from junior
and senior old-timers that Stanford
isn't quite the hotbed of unrest that it
used to be. They weren't talking about
campus activism No, they meant how
people responded to the movie reviews
of the famed Steve Vineberg. From
1980 to 1985, Vineberg reigned as The
Daily's movie critic, championing
obscure art films and blasting Holly
wood schlock Steve's gone on to
become a professor of theater and film
at Holy Cross, but he stopped by
recently to pronounce judgment on
the films of '86. Sit tight, kids; you're in
for a treat. We hereby present the
return of Steve Vineberg in typically
epic style.
Something extraordinary happened
in American movies in 1986. For the
first time since the dawn of the Reagan
era, an exciting, experimental picture
got past the usual barbed wire fences
erected by inept producers, scared dis
tributors, conventional-minded critics
and disinterested audiences. In "Blue
Velvet," David Lynch fastened onto a
theme — the coexistence of
malevolent and benign energies in a
world that likes to define itself as safe
and protected — that hit enough
nerves in a Yuppiefied America to
generate the first authentic artistic con
troversy in movies since "Last Tango in
Paris" nearly a decade and a half ago.
This visionary film, which may be
the only great movie ever arrived at (in
this country, at least) by sheer intui
tion, met with a lot of hostility in some
corners. But it escaped the negligence
and premature burial that were the fate
of almost every audacious piece of
filmmaking released here over the last
six years — "The Stunt Man," "Blow
Out," "Pennies from Heaven," "Shoot
the Moon," "Personal Best," "Under
Fire," "The Right Stuff." "Blue Velvet"
and its companion piece, Jonathan
Demme's road comedy "Something
Wild," with its discover-as-you-travel
approach to narrative, represent new
explorations of an old subject: the in
terplay between the light and dark
sides of human interaction.
That's not to say 1986 brought less
garbage to the screens of America than
1985 or 1984. A dedicated moviegoer
could easily sink in the accumulated
glop of pictures like "Top Gun," "Short
Circuit," "Legal Eagles," "Ruthless
People," "Nothing in Common,"
"Heartburn," "Aliens," "Crocodile
Dundee," "Heartbreak Ridge" and that
Hallmark greeting card paean to pre
adolescence, "Stand by Me," which an
astonishing amount of critics hailed as
an important statement on coming of
age. (Movie critics' memories can be as
short as audiences': The response to
"Stand by Me" makes you wonder if
any of its cheerleaders had ever seen
"Sounder" or "Murmur of the Heart,"

or read "Huckleberry Finn,'' "The
Catcher in the Rye" or "The Member of
the Wedding".) The art house crowd,
meanwhile, went for dreary,
monotonous neo-"auteur" classics:
"Down by Law," "Round Midnight"
and "Sid and Nancy."
Once-talented directors like Walter
Hill, Ron Howard and Hal Ashby came
up with the sad likes of "Crossroads,"

"Gung Ho" and "38 Million Ways to
Die." Martin Scorsese, the only Ameri
can director who ever got close to con
veying the spirit of Dostoevski on the
screen (in "Mean Streets" and "Taxi
Driver"), went to video school and
learned how to assemble flashy, multi
collision pool sequences for "The
Color of Money," a movie that even, in
the final analysis, trashed the majestic
performance of its star, Paul Newman.
Brian De Palma's "Wise Guys" read
like a surrender. Woody Allen made a
pleasant, forgettable little movie about
how nice it felt to get out of analysis,
and adult audiences, starved for
pictures that starred neither a Muppet
nor a Brat Packster, seized on "Hannah
and Her Sisters" as if it were the
Second Coming. And Francis Coppola,
trying to fight his way back from the
dead, released this year's weirdest hit,
"Peggy Sue Got Married," which had a
penny-dreadful, time-travel-comedy
script filtered through a desolate tone.
"Peggy Sue," a bewildered botch of
a picture, is my choice for most
depressing experience at the movies
this year.
On the other hand, there were some
sweet surprises: the Carroll Ballard-
Maurice Sendak "Nutcracker," "Crimes
of the Heart," the first half of "The Fly"
(the screwball comedy part), "F/X." It

was surprising to see the British film
industry; "My Beautiful Laundrette,"
Mona Lisa" and "A Room with a View"
were practically the only English
language movies you could recom
mend to anyone in the late spring and
early summer. David Byrne became a
filmmaker this year with the charming,
if emotionally thin, "True Stories,"
which was like a post-modernist

footnote to Robert Altman's
"Nashville." And Oliver Stone, the au
thor of such unconscionable scripts as
"Midnight Express," "Scarface" and
"The Year of the Dragon," turned out
to be a gifted, incendiary director with
"Salvador" and "Platoon."
The following list encompasses the
movies and contributions to movies
that brought me the most pleasure in
1986.
Best Picture:
I.' Blue Velvet": David Lynch sets his
erotic fable in a small town called Lum
berton, where unseen insects buzz
portentously in the suburban grass and
a street called Meadow Lane may turn
up a freshly cut human ear. The movie
chronicles the sexual awakening of a
young man, played by Kyle MacLadilan
with so much sympathy and self
effacement that we experience it
through his skin. "Blue Velvet" sug
gests a collaboration between Norman
Rockwell and Max Ernst.
2."Platoon": The best movie anyone
has made so far about Vietnam. Maybe
it took a half-crazy macho vet like
Oliver Stone — who happens to be a
great filmmaker — to achieve what a
number of good liberals couldn't.
3."Something Wild": Jonathan
Demme begins with a familiar screw
ball comedy premise — a possibly

mad young woman (Melanie Griffith)
knocks a straight arrow (Jeff Daniels)
off course and helps him find his ec
centricities and, ultimately, his salva
tion — and takes it in fresh new direc
tions. The comedy of the year, with the
year's most joyous soundtrack (by
David Byrne and Celia Cruz, Sister
Carol East, The Feelies, The Fine
Young Cannibals, Jimmy Cliff, Jerry

Harrison, Oingo Boingo and many,
many others).
4."My Beautiful Laundrette": What's
amazing about this picture, written by
Hanif Kureishi and directed by Step
hen Frears, is that none of it is like any
thing you've seen in another movie.
Gordon Warnecke and the chameleon
performer Daniel Day Lewis play a
Pakistani and an Anglo whose love af
fair plays wittily against the back
ground of racial tensions in contempo
rary London.
s."Kaos": Vittorio and Paolo Taviani,
Italy's most explosive and unconven
tional directors, film four stories by
Luigi Pirandello. The first, "The Other
Son," is a masterpiece; the second,
"Moon Sickness," is an expressionistic
parody of a vampire picture, and very
funny. There's not much going on in
the third and fourth segments, but the
epilogue, in which Pirandello (Omer
Antonutti, of the Taviani brothers'
"Padre Padrone" and "Night of the
Shooting Stars") communes with the
spirit of his dead mother (Regina
Bianchi), is splendid — an epiphany.
6."Mona Lisa": The director Neil Jor
dan and the actor Bob Hoskins turn
what is essentially a cheap-hearted
FILM-NOIR about a third-rate hood and
a whore (Cathy Tyson) into a genuine
romance.

7. Salvador": Oliver Stone's first
directorial job of the year — a mine
field of a movie about El Salvador un
der Roberto D'Aubuisson, with a crack
ling, often hilarious performance by
James Woods that cuts through a lot of
gonzo-journalist sentimentality. Not to
be savored for its political acuteness,
but a hell of a movie.
B."The Best of Times": A comedy for
grownups. Robin Williams, Holly
Palance, Kurt Russell and Pamela Reed
play two couples who revisit the follies
of their youth — not by traveling
through time, but by replaying a foot
ball game — in order to rejuvenate
their middle age. Written by Ron Shel
ton and directed by Roger Spottis
woode, who also collaborated on
1983's "Under Fire."
9."The Decline of the American
Empire": A highly enjoyable gabfest
from the French-Canadian director
Denys Arcand. It consists of five men
and four women talking about sex —
and then, ever so casually, a betrayal
occurs that changes everything without
ruffling the serene surface of the
movie.
10."Down and Out in Beverly Hills":
Not Paul Mazursky's best movie, but
probably his funniest. Nick Nolte, Rich
ard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler give rich
comic performances in a West Coast
replay of Renoir's "Boudu Saved from
Drowning."

"Moon Sickness," is an expressionistic
parody of a vampire picture, and very
funny. There's not much going on in
the third and fourth segments, but the
epilogue, in which Pirandello (Omer
Antonutti, of the Taviani brothers'
"Padre Padrone" and "Night of the
Shooting Stars") communes with the
spirit of his dead mother (Regina
Bianchi), is splendid — an epiphany.
6."Mona Lisa": The director Neil Jor
dan and the actor Bob Hoskins turn
what is essentially a cheap-hearted
FILM-NOIR about a third-rate hood and
a whore (Cathy Tyson) into a genuine
romance.

7. Salvador": Oliver Stone's first
directorial job of the year — a mine
field of a movie about El Salvador un
der Roberto D'Aubuisson, with a crack
ling, often hilarious performance by
James Woods that cuts through a lot of
gonzo-journalist sentimentality. Not to
be savored for its political acuteness,
but a hell of a movie.
B."The Best of Times": A comedy for
grownups. Robin Williams, Holly
Palance, Kurt Russell and Pamela Reed
play two couples who revisit the follies
of their youth — not by traveling
through time, but by replaying a foot
ball game — in order to rejuvenate
their middle age. Written by Ron Shel
ton and directed by Roger Spottis
woode, who also collaborated on
1983's "Under Fire."
9."The Decline of the American
Empire": A highly enjoyable gabfest
from the French-Canadian director
Denys Arcand. It consists of five men
and four women talking about sex —
and then, ever so casually, a betrayal
occurs that changes everything without
ruffling the serene surface of the
movie.
10."Down and Out in Beverly Hills":
Not Paul Mazursky's best movie, but
probably his funniest. Nick Nolte, Rich
ard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler give rich
comic performances in a West Coast
replay of Renoir's "Boudu Saved from
Drowning."

Freshmen and sophomore readers
out there may have heard from junior
and senior old-timers that Stanford
isn't quite the hotbed of unrest that it
used to be. They weren't talking about
campus activism No, they meant how
people responded to the movie reviews
of the famed Steve Vineberg. From
1980 to 1985, Vineberg reigned as The
Daily's movie critic, championing
obscure art films and blasting Holly
wood schlock Steve's gone on to
become a professor of theater and film
at Holy Cross, but he stopped by
recently to pronounce judgment on
the films of '86. Sit tight, kids; you're in
for a treat. We hereby present the
return of Steve Vineberg in typically
epic style.
Something extraordinary happened
in American movies in 1986. For the
first time since the dawn of the Reagan
era, an exciting, experimental picture
got past the usual barbed wire fences
erected by inept producers, scared dis
tributors, conventional-minded critics
and disinterested audiences. In "Blue
Velvet," David Lynch fastened onto a
theme — the coexistence of
malevolent and benign energies in a
world that likes to define itself as safe
and protected — that hit enough
nerves in a Yuppiefied America to
generate the first authentic artistic con
troversy in movies since "Last Tango in
Paris" nearly a decade and a half ago.
This visionary film, which may be
the only great movie ever arrived at (in
this country, at least) by sheer intui
tion, met with a lot of hostility in some
corners. But it escaped the negligence
and premature burial that were the fate
of almost every audacious piece of
filmmaking released here over the last
six years — "The Stunt Man," "Blow
Out," "Pennies from Heaven," "Shoot
the Moon," "Personal Best," "Under
Fire," "The Right Stuff." "Blue Velvet"
and its companion piece, Jonathan
Demme's road comedy "Something
Wild," with its discover-as-you-travel
approach to narrative, represent new
explorations of an old subject: the in
terplay between the light and dark
sides of human interaction.
That's not to say 1986 brought less
garbage to the screens of America than
1985 or 1984. A dedicated moviegoer
could easily sink in the accumulated
glop of pictures like "Top Gun," "Short
Circuit," "Legal Eagles," "Ruthless
People," "Nothing in Common,"
"Heartburn," "Aliens," "Crocodile
Dundee," "Heartbreak Ridge" and that
Hallmark greeting card paean to pre
adolescence, "Stand by Me," which an
astonishing amount of critics hailed as
an important statement on coming of
age. (Movie critics' memories can be as
short as audiences': The response to
"Stand by Me" makes you wonder if
any of its cheerleaders had ever seen
"Sounder" or "Murmur of the Heart,"

or read "Huckleberry Finn,'' "The
Catcher in the Rye" or "The Member of
the Wedding".) The art house crowd,
meanwhile, went for dreary,
monotonous neo-"auteur" classics:
"Down by Law," "Round Midnight"
and "Sid and Nancy."
Once-talented directors like Walter
Hill, Ron Howard and Hal Ashby came
up with the sad likes of "Crossroads,"

"Gung Ho" and "38 Million Ways to
Die." Martin Scorsese, the only Ameri
can director who ever got close to con
veying the spirit of Dostoevski on the
screen (in "Mean Streets" and "Taxi
Driver"), went to video school and
learned how to assemble flashy, multi
collision pool sequences for "The
Color of Money," a movie that even, in
the final analysis, trashed the majestic
performance of its star, Paul Newman.
Brian De Palma's "Wise Guys" read
like a surrender. Woody Allen made a
pleasant, forgettable little movie about
how nice it felt to get out of analysis,
and adult audiences, starved for
pictures that starred neither a Muppet
nor a Brat Packster, seized on "Hannah
and Her Sisters" as if it were the
Second Coming. And Francis Coppola,
trying to fight his way back from the
dead, released this year's weirdest hit,
"Peggy Sue Got Married," which had a
penny-dreadful, time-travel-comedy
script filtered through a desolate tone.
"Peggy Sue," a bewildered botch of
a picture, is my choice for most
depressing experience at the movies
this year.
On the other hand, there were some
sweet surprises: the Carroll Ballard-
Maurice Sendak "Nutcracker," "Crimes
of the Heart," the first half of "The Fly"
(the screwball comedy part), "F/X." It

was surprising to see the British film
industry; "My Beautiful Laundrette,"
Mona Lisa" and "A Room with a View"
were practically the only English
language movies you could recom
mend to anyone in the late spring and
early summer. David Byrne became a
filmmaker this year with the charming,
if emotionally thin, "True Stories,"
which was like a post-modernist

footnote to Robert Altman's
"Nashville." And Oliver Stone, the au
thor of such unconscionable scripts as
"Midnight Express," "Scarface" and
"The Year of the Dragon," turned out
to be a gifted, incendiary director with
"Salvador" and "Platoon."
The following list encompasses the
movies and contributions to movies
that brought me the most pleasure in
1986.
Best Picture:
I.' Blue Velvet": David Lynch sets his
erotic fable in a small town called Lum
berton, where unseen insects buzz
portentously in the suburban grass and
a street called Meadow Lane may turn
up a freshly cut human ear. The movie
chronicles the sexual awakening of a
young man, played by Kyle MacLadilan
with so much sympathy and self
effacement that we experience it
through his skin. "Blue Velvet" sug
gests a collaboration between Norman
Rockwell and Max Ernst.
2."Platoon": The best movie anyone
has made so far about Vietnam. Maybe
it took a half-crazy macho vet like
Oliver Stone — who happens to be a
great filmmaker — to achieve what a
number of good liberals couldn't.
3."Something Wild": Jonathan
Demme begins with a familiar screw
ball comedy premise — a possibly

mad young woman (Melanie Griffith)
knocks a straight arrow (Jeff Daniels)
off course and helps him find his ec
centricities and, ultimately, his salva
tion — and takes it in fresh new direc
tions. The comedy of the year, with the
year's most joyous soundtrack (by
David Byrne and Celia Cruz, Sister
Carol East, The Feelies, The Fine
Young Cannibals, Jimmy Cliff, Jerry

Harrison, Oingo Boingo and many,
many others).
4."My Beautiful Laundrette": What's
amazing about this picture, written by
Hanif Kureishi and directed by Step
hen Frears, is that none of it is like any
thing you've seen in another movie.
Gordon Warnecke and the chameleon
performer Daniel Day Lewis play a
Pakistani and an Anglo whose love af
fair plays wittily against the back
ground of racial tensions in contempo
rary London.
s."Kaos": Vittorio and Paolo Taviani,
Italy's most explosive and unconven
tional directors, film four stories by
Luigi Pirandello. The first, "The Other
Son," is a masterpiece; the second,
"Moon Sickness," is an expressionistic
parody of a vampire picture, and very
funny. There's not much going on in
the third and fourth segments, but the
epilogue, in which Pirandello (Omer
Antonutti, of the Taviani brothers'
"Padre Padrone" and "Night of the
Shooting Stars") communes with the
spirit of his dead mother (Regina
Bianchi), is splendid — an epiphany.

I.' Blue Velvet": David Lynch sets his
erotic fable in a small town called Lum
berton, where unseen insects buzz
portentously in the suburban grass and
a street called Meadow Lane may turn
up a freshly cut human ear. The movie
chronicles the sexual awakening of a
young man, played by Kyle MacLadilan
with so much sympathy and self
effacement that we experience it
through his skin. "Blue Velvet" sug
gests a collaboration between Norman
Rockwell and Max Ernst.
2."Platoon": The best movie anyone
has made so far about Vietnam. Maybe
it took a half-crazy macho vet like
Oliver Stone — who happens to be a
great filmmaker — to achieve what a
number of good liberals couldn't.
3."Something Wild": Jonathan
Demme begins with a familiar screw
ball comedy premise — a possibly

mad young woman (Melanie Griffith)
knocks a straight arrow (Jeff Daniels)
off course and helps him find his ec
centricities and, ultimately, his salva
tion — and takes it in fresh new direc
tions. The comedy of the year, with the
year's most joyous soundtrack (by
David Byrne and Celia Cruz, Sister
Carol East, The Feelies, The Fine
Young Cannibals, Jimmy Cliff, Jerry

Harrison, Oingo Boingo and many,
many others).
4."My Beautiful Laundrette": What's
amazing about this picture, written by
Hanif Kureishi and directed by Step
hen Frears, is that none of it is like any
thing you've seen in another movie.
Gordon Warnecke and the chameleon
performer Daniel Day Lewis play a
Pakistani and an Anglo whose love af
fair plays wittily against the back
ground of racial tensions in contempo
rary London.
s."Kaos": Vittorio and Paolo Taviani,
Italy's most explosive and unconven
tional directors, film four stories by
Luigi Pirandello. The first, "The Other
Son," is a masterpiece; the second,
"Moon Sickness," is an expressionistic
parody of a vampire picture, and very
funny. There's not much going on in
the third and fourth segments, but the
epilogue, in which Pirandello (Omer
Antonutti, of the Taviani brothers'
"Padre Padrone" and "Night of the
Shooting Stars") communes with the
spirit of his dead mother (Regina
Bianchi), is splendid — an epiphany.
6."Mona Lisa": The director Neil Jor
dan and the actor Bob Hoskins turn
what is essentially a cheap-hearted
FILM-NOIR about a third-rate hood and
a whore (Cathy Tyson) into a genuine
romance.

7. Salvador": Oliver Stone's first
directorial job of the year — a mine
field of a movie about El Salvador un
der Roberto D'Aubuisson, with a crack
ling, often hilarious performance by
James Woods that cuts through a lot of
gonzo-journalist sentimentality. Not to
be savored for its political acuteness,
but a hell of a movie.
B."The Best of Times": A comedy for
grownups. Robin Williams, Holly
Palance, Kurt Russell and Pamela Reed
play two couples who revisit the follies
of their youth — not by traveling
through time, but by replaying a foot
ball game — in order to rejuvenate
their middle age. Written by Ron Shel
ton and directed by Roger Spottis
woode, who also collaborated on
1983's "Under Fire."
9."The Decline of the American
Empire": A highly enjoyable gabfest
from the French-Canadian director
Denys Arcand. It consists of five men
and four women talking about sex —
and then, ever so casually, a betrayal
occurs that changes everything without
ruffling the serene surface of the
movie.
10."Down and Out in Beverly Hills":
Not Paul Mazursky's best movie, but
probably his funniest. Nick Nolte, Rich
ard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler give rich
comic performances in a West Coast
replay of Renoir's "Boudu Saved from
Drowning."
