## Hoopsters meet Cal at Harmon Arena 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Before the Pacific 10 Conference basketball
season began, the California Golden Bears got as
much attention as anyone when possible title
contenders were discussed.
The Stanford Cardinal, on the other hand, was
mentioned rarely, and then only as a dark horse, a
young team capable of pulling off some upsets
and maybe even sneaking into the top half of the
conference standings.
And as the season unfolded, nothing seemed to
be wrong with this assessment. Cal rolled
through its first three league games undefeated,
while Stanford had to struggle to get a home split
with the Oregon schools and was blown out by
UCLA at Pauley Pavilion.

But things have changed since then, and now
Saturday's 3 p.m. confrontation at Harmon Arena
is truly a "big game" for both teams.
On Jan. 4, Cal forward Leonard Taylor, the
team's leading scorer and rebounder, was in
volved in a collision during an 86-81 road loss to
UCLA. The collision caused numbness in Taylor's
arm, X-rays were taken, and the 6-foot-8 junior —
along with his 19 points and 8.8 rebounds per
game — was sidelined.
Taylor was not missed at first, as Cal blasted
Washington State 92-58 on Jan. 8. His absence has
been felt since, however, as the Bears have
dropped consecutive games to Washington and
Colorado.
The home loss to the Huskies knocked the

Sophomore Terry Taylor has performed well in the starting point guard spot for Stanford this
season. Taylor has 22 assists in the last two games — both of which the Cardinal has won.
Bears out of first place in the Pac-10,
but the most serious blow to Cal's title
hopes came yesterday, when it was an
nounced that Taylor had been
diagnosed to have severe congenital
spinal cervical stenosis and will be out
for the season.
The X-rays taken in Los Angeles
revealed a narrowing of the spinal
canal in Taylor s neck. Because another
collision such as the one he suffered at
UCLA could result in paralysis, Taylor's
career as well as his season may be
over.
Taylor's condition is similar to that
of Green Bay Packers' defensive back
Tim Lewis, who retired from football
after a tackle made in a nationally
televised game this season left him mo
mentarily paralyzed.

The problem can be resolved, but
the surgery involved is dangerous and
complete recovery is uncertain. It has
not been announced whether Taylor
will undergo it.
For Stanford, the past two weeks
have brought good news instead. The
Cardinal has won three straight, in
cluding an 82-77 victory over confer
ence leader Washington, to move into
a third-place tie with Cal and Oregon
State at 4-2. Two of the most encourag
ing signs for Stanford have been the
strong play of the Cardinal reserves
and the steady ballhandling of point
guard Terr>' Taylor, who has 22 assists
in the last two games.
"We're just trying to get better and
survive right now," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "Cal beat us
badly (81-53) up there last year, so
we're first thinking in terms of trying to
compete."

Harmon Arena, known as Harmon
Gym before being renamed by Cal
Coach Lou Campanelli, is generally re
garded as one of the toughest in the
Pac-10 for a visiting team because of its
size — small — and noise level —
high, very high.
"It's small, the fans are some of the
loudest you'll face, and they're right on
you. Even the alumni are loud," Stan
ford forward Greg Butler said.
"Everywhere you turn, people are yel
ling at you. It's definitely a hostile
crowd."
Montgomery does not begrudge the
Bears their home court advantage. "I
think that's great," he said. "We're
gonna have to (handle it). It's part of
the maturing process. We have to keep
their spurts and momentum down to
take the crowd out of the game."
Stanford will also be hoping to take
Kevin Johnson out of the game, but
controlling the flashy Cal point guard,

who is averaging 17 points per game, is
not an easy chore.
"Kevin Johnson is just a premier
player," Montgomery said. "He con
cerns us as much as anything He runs
so well and gets the ball up quickly.
He's difficult to contain, and he makes
the other players better. He can single
handedly take you out of a ballgame."
The Bears have beaten the Cardinal
four straight times and nine of the last
10. According to Butler, the more
recent losses at Cal have had a consis
tent pattern.
"We have been impatient of
fensively," said Butler, whose brother
Dave is the Bears' starting center. "That
lets Kevin run, and we've been almost
blown out from the start. The key to
beating them at their place is to control
the tempo of the game."
The game is a sellout, but it will be
televised locally by KPIX Channel 5. It
can also be heard on KCBS (740 AM)
and KZSIJ (90.1 FM).

Sophomore Terry Taylor has performed well in the starting point guard spot for Stanford this
season. Taylor has 22 assists in the last two games — both of which the Cardinal has won.
Bears out of first place in the Pac-10,
but the most serious blow to Cal's title
hopes came yesterday, when it was an
nounced that Taylor had been
diagnosed to have severe congenital
spinal cervical stenosis and will be out
for the season.
The X-rays taken in Los Angeles
revealed a narrowing of the spinal
canal in Taylor s neck. Because another
collision such as the one he suffered at
UCLA could result in paralysis, Taylor's
career as well as his season may be
over.
Taylor's condition is similar to that
of Green Bay Packers' defensive back
Tim Lewis, who retired from football
after a tackle made in a nationally
televised game this season left him mo
mentarily paralyzed.

The problem can be resolved, but
the surgery involved is dangerous and
complete recovery is uncertain. It has
not been announced whether Taylor
will undergo it.
For Stanford, the past two weeks
have brought good news instead. The
Cardinal has won three straight, in
cluding an 82-77 victory over confer
ence leader Washington, to move into
a third-place tie with Cal and Oregon
State at 4-2. Two of the most encourag
ing signs for Stanford have been the
strong play of the Cardinal reserves
and the steady ballhandling of point
guard Terr>' Taylor, who has 22 assists
in the last two games.
"We're just trying to get better and
survive right now," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "Cal beat us
badly (81-53) up there last year, so
we're first thinking in terms of trying to
compete."

Harmon Arena, known as Harmon
Gym before being renamed by Cal
Coach Lou Campanelli, is generally re
garded as one of the toughest in the
Pac-10 for a visiting team because of its
size — small — and noise level —
high, very high.
"It's small, the fans are some of the
loudest you'll face, and they're right on
you. Even the alumni are loud," Stan
ford forward Greg Butler said.
"Everywhere you turn, people are yel
ling at you. It's definitely a hostile
crowd."
Montgomery does not begrudge the
Bears their home court advantage. "I
think that's great," he said. "We're
gonna have to (handle it). It's part of
the maturing process. We have to keep
their spurts and momentum down to
take the crowd out of the game."
Stanford will also be hoping to take
Kevin Johnson out of the game, but
controlling the flashy Cal point guard,

who is averaging 17 points per game, is
not an easy chore.
"Kevin Johnson is just a premier
player," Montgomery said. "He con
cerns us as much as anything He runs
so well and gets the ball up quickly.
He's difficult to contain, and he makes
the other players better. He can single
handedly take you out of a ballgame."
The Bears have beaten the Cardinal
four straight times and nine of the last
10. According to Butler, the more
recent losses at Cal have had a consis
tent pattern.
"We have been impatient of
fensively," said Butler, whose brother
Dave is the Bears' starting center. "That
lets Kevin run, and we've been almost
blown out from the start. The key to
beating them at their place is to control
the tempo of the game."
The game is a sellout, but it will be
televised locally by KPIX Channel 5. It
can also be heard on KCBS (740 AM)
and KZSIJ (90.1 FM).
Before the Pacific 10 Conference basketball
season began, the California Golden Bears got as
much attention as anyone when possible title
contenders were discussed.
The Stanford Cardinal, on the other hand, was
mentioned rarely, and then only as a dark horse, a
young team capable of pulling off some upsets
and maybe even sneaking into the top half of the
conference standings.
And as the season unfolded, nothing seemed to
be wrong with this assessment. Cal rolled
through its first three league games undefeated,
while Stanford had to struggle to get a home split
with the Oregon schools and was blown out by
UCLA at Pauley Pavilion.

But things have changed since then, and now
Saturday's 3 p.m. confrontation at Harmon Arena
is truly a "big game" for both teams.
On Jan. 4, Cal forward Leonard Taylor, the
team's leading scorer and rebounder, was in
volved in a collision during an 86-81 road loss to
UCLA. The collision caused numbness in Taylor's
arm, X-rays were taken, and the 6-foot-8 junior —
