# Stanford loses early lead, defeated 94-82 by BYU
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
All-World center Tresa Spaulding has been responsible
for much of her team's success this year.
However, after beating Stanford 94-82 last night at Maples
Pavilion, the Brigham Young women's basketball team
proved to the 300 spectators in attendance that the Cougars
are more than just a one-woman show.
But they had to prove it to themselves first.
Nine minutes into the opening stanza, Stanford's run-and
gun transition game was shredding the Cougar defense en
route to an early 14-point lead.
BYU's offense, on the other hand, looked stagnant and
awkward as it repeatedly tried to force the ball inside to the
six-foot-seven Spaulding.
It was time for BYU Coach Courtney Leishman to make a
change. But what he did was unexpected.
He took his all-star center and leading scorer out of the
game.
"There's a tendency for a team to rely too heavily on one
player," Leishman said. "I wanted to prove to the rest of the
starters that they could play too. Everyone got more in
volved in the game, and we started to play better as a team.
We definitely began to pick it up at that point."
Forwards Cathy Nixon and Michelle Carter picked up the
Cougar offense by scoring 14 points in the next four
minutes. Spaulding returned to a well-rounded offense and
helped put the finishing touches on a 19-5 spurt that evened
the score, 38-38, as the first half ended.
In the second half, Nixon and Carter took control of the
game at both ends of the court. Nixon's remarkable twisting
jumpers in the face of Stanford defenders swished the nets
for 24 second-half points. She finished with a game-high 35
points. Spaulding was an intimidating force at the defensive
end of the court, rejecting numerous Cardinal attempts. She
also added 30 points for the Cougars.
"We knew beforehand that she (Nixon) would be the key
to the game," Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"Spaulding will always get her points, but Nixon really
broke our backs.''
Stanford's outside shooting cooled considerably after the
opening minutes of the game. The Cardinal shot only 38
percent for the game, while BYU converted a blistering 57
percent. Kami Anderson led Stanford scorers with 20 points.
Despite the final outcome, Stanford received a
remarkable performance from point guard Jennifer Azzi,
who destroyed the Cardinal single-game assist record by
dishing out 16. (The previous mark was 11, held by Virginia
Sourlis, Erica Muser and Debi Gore.) She also scored 14
points and grabbed 10 rebounds to complete a triple
double.
Saturday night at Maples Pavilion, Stanford will host Cali
fornia in a key Pacific 10 Conference matchup. Game time is
7:30.
