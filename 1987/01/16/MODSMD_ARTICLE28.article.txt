# Card wrestlers narrowly beat Humboldt St.
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
The recent, unusually cold weather here has brought
about moans and groans from the Stanford student body,
but the Cardinal wrestling team wasn't complaining yester
day.
Thanks in part to a bizarre turn of events at Roble Gym,
the Stanford wrestlers defeated Humboldt State 25-20 to im
prove their record to 2-4-1 for the season.
Humboldt, which benefited from a forfeit in the 118-
pound division, returned the favor at 167 when its wrestler
was unable to drop four pounds in order to make the
weight classification.
Under normal circumstances, wrestlers are able to drop
weight on the day of a meet, according to Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel. They either sit in a sauna or run before their
match. Yesterday, however, the sauna at Roble Gym was
broken, and it was so cold outside that the Humboldt
wrestler was unable to dehydrate himself prior to his match
with Stanford's Eric Harber. The six points that the Cardinal
got for the forfeit were instrumental in the eventual
outcome of the meet.
The outlook did not seem that good for Stanford during
the early stages of the meet. The Cardinal forfeited at 118 as
it has all season, as there is no one on the roster to fill the
spot.
In the 126-pound match, Josh Lisle, back in action after a
bout with the flu, lost to Humboldt's Jay Lang 7-5. Stanford s
Brian Veit was decisioned 12-4 by Mike Puzz in the 134-
pound division.

Terry Mclntyre lost his first dual meet of the season last night against Humboldt State's Don Wolf Mclntyre
dropped to 6-1-0 on the year, while Stanford upped its record to 2-4-1 with a 25-20 win over the Lumberjacks.
After Geoff Baum tied Humboldt's
Bill Defenbaugh 8-8 at 142, the Card
inal's Ail-American Scott Wiggen got

the team rolling. Wiggen, competing
with bruised ribs, bruised Doug
Losak's ego, winning the 150-pound
match by technical fall after compiling
a 15-0 advantage against the Humboldt
wrestler in just 6:27 of action.
Stanford's Steve Yarbrough (158)
then narrowly decisioned Tim

Monahan 7-5, and Harber recorded a
victory with the forfeit at 167.
In a low-scoring duel, the Cardinal's
Ron Perry and Humboldt's Robert
Walkins wrestled to a 3-3 tie in the 177-
pound division.
Humboldt's Don Wolf then
surprised Terry Mclntyre in the 190

match, 5-2. It was Mclntyre's first dual
meet loss of the season as he fell to 6-1-
0. "It was very close. The situation
came down to 30 seconds left, and he
(Mclntyre) was down by one point,"
Horpel said, indicating that Mclntyre
had to go for a takedown with time
running out. "In attempting the

takedown, he got a little careless and
got taken down."
Wolfs victory gave Humboldt a 20-
19 advantage with only the
heavyweight match remaining. Stan
ford's Kurt Kassulke put an end to the
suspense quickly; however, pinning
Karl Knupper at 2:12 to give the Card

inal the victory.
Kassulke had little trouble with his
Humboldt opponent, taking Knupper
down on his first attempt. He then
turned Knupper immediately and got a
fast pin call from the referee.

pound division.
Humboldt's Don Wolf then
surprised Terry Mclntyre in the 190

match, 5-2. It was Mclntyre's first dual
meet loss of the season as he fell to 6-1-
0. "It was very close. The situation
came down to 30 seconds left, and he
(Mclntyre) was down by one point,"
Horpel said, indicating that Mclntyre
had to go for a takedown with time
running out. "In attempting the

takedown, he got a little careless and
got taken down."
Wolfs victory gave Humboldt a 20-
19 advantage with only the
heavyweight match remaining. Stan
ford's Kurt Kassulke put an end to the
suspense quickly; however, pinning
Karl Knupper at 2:12 to give the Card

inal the victory.
Kassulke had little trouble with his
Humboldt opponent, taking Knupper
down on his first attempt. He then
turned Knupper immediately and got a
fast pin call from the referee.
The Cardinal is back in action
tonight at Davis against Oregon Tech.
