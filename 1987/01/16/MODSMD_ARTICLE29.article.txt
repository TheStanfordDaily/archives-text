"Slow hut steady wins the race" will he the Stanford
women's gymnastics team credo when it opens its season at
UC-Davis, putting a young squad on the floor and sticking to
conservative routines.
"We have four freshmen competing," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina said. "I'm looking to see how they compete
as a unit."
One of these freshmen, Dina Amoroso, could be the star
of the meet."! expect that Dina will probably win the floor
(exercise), vaulting and beam," Sardina said.
Teammate Jinny Rhee, a sophomore who sparkled in her
debut meet last year, shares Sardina's optimism. "I think
Dina could win, if it's anything like last year," she said.
A few upperclassmen will be competing as well. "Alison
(McGann) will be there with a new bars routine, " Sardina
said. "Sheri Evenson will be there. Sheri's wired — she has
more energy- than 20 girls.
"Cindy Boyd is competing as well," he added. "This is her
first competition in a couple of years, so it's an important
meet."
Sardina's goals for the meet are somewhat unusual.
"We're going to open easy, and we're not throwing a lot of
difficult routines," he said. "The only one thing we're
looking at is hitting routines. I want us to come home
having hit 20 of 24 routines."
He's also looking to give his freshmen some seasoning
while holding out many vets. There's a huge list of people
who aren't competing," Sardina said.
The competition could be a chal
lenge for the Cardinal. "It's not going
to be a cakewalk." Sardina said. "Davis

is reasonably strong. They've been a
Division II power for a couple of
years."
This fact, however, leaves Sardina
undaunted. "I'm really just Ux>king for
ward to the season. We're going to start
slow, but we've got a lot of new things
you're going to see from meet to
meet."
