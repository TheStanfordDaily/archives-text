# Pentagon assails Bernstein article

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
A Pentagon spokesman said the
United States "never produced or
delivered any anthrax bombs (to Eng
land) in World War II," countering the
recent findings of History Prof. Barton
Bernstein.
Maj. Randy Morger said anthrax test
ing did occur, and an American plant
was scheduled to produce the bombs,
but no bombs were ever produced in
the large quantities that Bernstein
claimed. In a recent article, Bernstein
cited a British document that stated
England had received 5,000 anthrax
bombs from the United States and that
many more were expected to arrive.
Morger based his findings on re
search of other historians active during
the war. He cited both printed material
and current interviews. Morger said

these historians had never found any
references suggesting the production
of the anthrax bombs during the war.
"Professor Bernstein is apparently
wrong," Morger said.
"He (Bernstein) is obviously using
sources that don't match up with ac
cepted and authoritative record," he
said.
Bernstein said the British document
does not explicitly deny the produc
tion of the anthrax bombs.
"The document implies no produc
tion but doesn't say it,"he said. He
credited the author(s) of the document
with either extremely "inane or skillful
phrasing."
Bernstein questioned the reliability
of Morger's information. He said offi
cial historians "do not write everything
they see and see things that they can't
tell anyone. Bernstein added that not
everything written is true and referred

to official history as somewhat similai
to a "press release."
Bernstein also said that the his
torians Morger interviewed are com
