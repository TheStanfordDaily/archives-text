# Pentagon assails Bernstein article

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
A Pentagon spokesman said the
United States "never produced or
delivered any anthrax bombs (to Eng
land) in World War II," countering the
recent findings of History Prof. Barton
Bernstein.
Maj. Randy Morger said anthrax test
ing did occur, and an American plant
was scheduled to produce the bombs,
but no bombs were ever produced in
the large quantities that Bernstein
claimed. In a recent article, Bernstein
cited a British document that stated
England had received 5,000 anthrax
bombs from the United States and that
many more were expected to arrive.
Morger based his findings on re
search of other historians active during
the war. He cited both printed material
and current interviews. Morger said

these historians had never found any
references suggesting the production
of the anthrax bombs during the war.
"Professor Bernstein is apparently
wrong," Morger said.
"He (Bernstein) is obviously using
sources that don't match up with ac
cepted and authoritative record," he
said.
Bernstein said the British document
does not explicitly deny the produc
tion of the anthrax bombs.
"The document implies no produc
tion but doesn't say it,"he said. He
credited the author(s) of the document
with either extremely "inane or skillful
phrasing."
Bernstein questioned the reliability
of Morger's information. He said offi
cial historians "do not write everything
they see and see things that they can't
tell anyone. Bernstein added that not
everything written is true and referred

to official history as somewhat similai
to a "press release."
Bernstein also said that the his
torians Morger interviewed are com

menting on documents they didn't see
on an event that occurred 35 years ago.
Bernstein said he learned of bomb
production through declassified
British documents. And many British
and U.S. documents still remain classi
fied.
He continued that if these historians
were already adults at the time of the
war, he would question the reliability
of their memories.
The reader can either believe
Morger's historians or a contemporary
document from an authoritative official
to Prime Minister Winston Churchill,

Bernstein said.
"Official history is both useful and
misleading," he said.
Morger used this identical argument
to explain Bernstein's inaccurate infor
mation on the production of the
bombs. He said a biological weapons
plant did exist in Terre Haute, Ind., as
Bernstein claimed, but it never
produced any weapons. The plant may
have been secret during the war but "is
described in pretty good detail in the
1950s history book (The U.S. Army in
World War II')," he said.
"The passing of years have clouded
people's memory," he said.
Bernstein said Hitler had given a
direct order to German scientists not
to research biological warfare because
it was too immoral. Morger countered

that during the war, U.S. officials did
not know this and, even if they had,
they might not have believed it.
Morger said he is "not trying to
backpedal from Allied intent." He said
the Allies would have produced and
used the bomb "for provocative or
retaliatory measures" if the Germans
were intending to use it.
"In World War 11, signals could get
mixed, and we had to prepare for the
worst situation," he said.
Morger added that Bernstein should
not use "20/20 hindsight" when
criticizing U.S. policy.
Bernstein agreed Allied intelligence
had failed to intercept Hitler's order,
and if it had, it is possible U.S. and
British officials might have been "more
tempted to use it (the bomb)."
