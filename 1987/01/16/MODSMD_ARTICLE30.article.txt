# Men's soccer faces Argentina in exhibition match on Farm
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
In its second international affair in as many
months, the Stanford men's soccer team takes on a
club team from Buenos Aires, Argentina, tomorrow
at ncx)n at Maloney Field.
Most (if the members of the Argentine team atten
ded Mitre High School in Buenos Aires and are now
university students. No, you're not seeing things. It
says "Mitre." Yes, the same Mitre that makes those
soccer balls you kick around and the cleats with
which you kick them.
Though the connection between the names is un
clear, it is clear that this team will not be another I'ni
versity of Sydney The Cardinal trounced the Aussies
4-0 back on Dec. 3. dominating every phase of the
game.
In the game. Stanford was led by senior Jim Cole,
who scored twice in what was very likely the final
game of his Stanford career. He may miss the Card
inal's spring season because of an offer to play for the

San Jose Earthquakes in their upcoming outdoor
season.
I SC, which has an excellent club soccer program,
defeated Sydney 5-1 The Argentines tied I'SC, 2-2.
Unlike Sydney, this team has no old men that live
near the university crowding its roster. They're the
equivalent of American varsity athletes, they're in
shape, and they've been playing. A lot.
On the field, the Argentines look to team captain
Alexandro Cloppet.
They played a professional team earlier this week,
but we don't know who Vi'e know they're tough, and
we know we're definitely out of shape. Stanford
Coach Sam Koch said.
"Everybody sure had a good break, he added
jokingly.
There is some question whether the Cardinal,
which has been practicing only two or three times a
week in the off season, will be able to run with the
Argentines for 90 minutes. Stanford has. however,
been practicing every day this week in preparation
for Saturday.

"The players are all sucking pond water out there,"
Koch said. We'll probably be 75 percent. We're
going to play a lot of people and have a lot of fun. We
have to look at it realistically, from a preparation
standpoint."
Koch said he is certain the team will be in better
shape for the exhibition on Jan. 31 with the t'niver
sidad Catolica, also from Argentina.
The Cardinal will be without the services of all
seniors in tomorrow's game, and also will miss soph
omores Luke Garrott and Chris I Hick, junior Jerry
Maldonado and fourth-year junior Dave Kang
When Koch said he will play a lot of people, he
wasn't kidding. Along with everyone on the current
varsity roster, several junior varsity players will dress
and may see action. They include sophomores Tim
Murphy, Toby Island and Chris Davis, and freshmen
Brad Ekstrand, Joe Hastings, Conrad Vail and Rob
Austin.
'"We're coming around I think we're going to be
better These kids are working hard. I just hope we're
not tixi out of shape," Koch said.
