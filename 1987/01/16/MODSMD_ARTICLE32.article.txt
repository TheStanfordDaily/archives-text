## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The young will meet the old in the
Stanford men's volleyball alumni
tournament, tonight at 7 in Maples
Pavilion. In this traditional match that
will open the season, returning alumni
Ail-Americans Jon Root and Chris
Braun will face a new, younger team
with four first-year starters.
According to returning senior Steve
Modory, these four freshmen, Parker
Blackman, Craig Forsyth, Dan Hanan
and Kent Steffes, will be the key factors
to a winning season.
"We could do awfully well because
of the four good recruits. Any one of
them could jump in and start. It's made
for a more competitive atmosphere on
the team," said Modory, who will start
this season as the setter.
The tournament will be played
round-robin style, dividing the alums
into three teams and the varsity into
two. The winner of the alumni bracket
will challenge the winner of the varsity
game in the championship match set
for 9 p.m.
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm is
hesitant to make predictions about this
season, admitting that the 1987 team
will be much different than last year's
No. 7 nationally ranked team.
"This match will give us a good op
portunity to watch and learn more
about the team," said Sturm, who
coached Stanford men's volleyball
through it's second straight winning
season of 12-8 and into its second

This year, the spikers will join the
newly formed Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association (WIVA), which
should he the toughest league in the
nation. The team's first non-conference
game will be against Westmont College
on Saturday at 3 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.

"At this early part of the season I
don't have any expectations (for the
game). Losing people with that kind of
experience will always change a team,
Sturm said.
The spikers' strongest hope rests
with honorable mention All-American
Scott Fortune. The junior outside hitter
was third on the team in hitting
percentage last year with a .328
average, behind the two Braun and
Root. Seniors Stephen Blue, John
McDermott, Modory and Rob Peterson
will also be returning to add their ex
