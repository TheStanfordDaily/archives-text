# Row houses are theme targets
## 
### CIAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Lathrop or another row residence as the new home of an
arts or Russian-East European theme house? Durand or
Hurlburt as the center of a public service or international
relations theme house?
It proposals for academic and language theme houses
receive University approval, chances are that several non
theme houses on the Row could become the new centers
for students seeking to combine their academic and intel
lectual interests with residential life.
According to University guidelines for the creation, or
ganization and review of theme houses, every new theme
house which is created means the displacement of an exist
ing living group whether it be a theme or a non-theme
group
The guidelines, however, do not state the status of resi
dents with returning priority who would be displaced
should their house become theme oriented.
Smaller resiliences on the Row are the most likely to be
converted to theme houses if the student-initiated drives for
these houses are approved, according to Rodger Whitney,
University director of Housing
It's not likely that there is going to be a theme house in a
larger dormitory," Whitney said, adding that it would be
hard to predict which houses would actually be converted
The needs of proposed theme houses, including the po
tential number of residents and required facilities such as a
librarv or seminar room, would be central to the conversion
process. Whitney said.

"We aren't building a new house for it (a proposed
theme)," he said.
Students seeking new theme houses "must demonstrate
that the theme appeals to a range of faculty members and
students" and that "the number of students requesting and
seeking priority assignment to the house will equal the
number of spaces in the house plus percent," according
to University guidelines.
In addition, a theme house must have a faculty member
with experience in the theme of study serve as resident fel
low, one resident assistant, two or more theme associates
and criteria for assignment priority in the house.
Proposals for the houses "must also explain wh\ the goals
and objectives of the group require a house, and why they
cannot be met in some other fashion," according to the
guidelines. The proposal must also "include a detailed plan
for the educational program of the house, including existing
and proposed courses and other credit granting activities.
While the University is committed to finding housing for
all approved proposals, it is not creating theme house
proposals itself
Vi e have not been in the business of thinking up ideas
for theme houses." said Norm Robinson, associate dean of
Student Affairs. He noted that the Office of Residential Edu
cation will help all students who show an interest with es
tablishing a theme house and developing a proposal.
Robinson reviews all proposals and prepares a report on
the availabilin of suitable facilities before final action i*>
taken by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies' subcommittee on Resi
dential Education.
Robinson said he does not feel an in
creasing number of theme houses
would jeopardize a liberal education
by having people with the same inter
ests living together.
"It probably would broaden it be
cause (theme houses) give people the
common experience around which
they can start a good dialogue," Robin
son said.
He noted that proposals for broader
themes, which would attract students
majoring in a number of fields, have a
better chance of receiving approval.
At the American Studies House,
where only one resident is majoring in
American Studies, diversity of majors
and interests is not a problem.
According to Alex Levinson, Ameri

can Studies resident assistant, students
drew into the house because "they
wanted a house in which they wouldn't
just leave their academic lives behind.
"They wanted a house with other
people who would be interested in
programming," Levinson said.
He added that he did not want to see
new theme houses in which only
people with the same major could live.
