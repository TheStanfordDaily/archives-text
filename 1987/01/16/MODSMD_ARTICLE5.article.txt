# Western Culture Program
## Fac Sen OKs proposed course 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday unanimously approved a
new course proposed for the Western Culture requirement
which will emphasize the contributions of women and
minorities to Western culture.
Within an hour after the Rev. Jesse Jackson marched with
students in support of the course proposal, the senate voted
to approve the new course on a one-time-only basis. The
course, developed by Associate History Prof. Clay Carson,
director of the Martin Luther Kingjr. Papers Project, was rec
ommended by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(CUS) in December, by the Western Culture Program Com
mittee and informally by the Task Force on Western Culture.
In its final form, the course's newly approved syllabus in
cludes an unusually high number of secondary readings.
Carson's course proposal explained this emphasis on sec
ondary readings: "Because students should be provided
with a historical context that will make the unconventional
primary readings more understandable, this syllabus in
cludes a higher proportion of secondary readings than is
normal in Western Culture tracks."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz said he agreed with the
course being offered on a one-time-only basis. "I say that
because it places too much emphasis on secondary works
and not enough on primary works."
Rebholz called for a newly defined non-Western Culture
requirement "Prof. Carson's course should, in my point of
view, become a catalyst for rethinking a new non-Western
Culture requirement, which at the moment seems to be a
matter of heterogenous and amorphous tokenism.
Amanda Kemp, chair of the Black Student Union, said she
was in favor of the new course, though she pointed out that
a fundamental re-evaluation of the Western Culture Pro
gram is needed. "We should prepare students for living in a

society that is global. We're not just living in America any
more."
Jackson spoke to students in front of the Law School
where the senate meets. "There is more culture than West
ern culture. We are people of the world," he said.
Jackson urged students to continue to protest for divest
ment and for "a multi-cultural" education. "I hope you
never stop marching," he said.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall, in his recommendation to the
senate, pointed out that the issue of representation of
women and minorities in the Western Culture Program "is
not new," and has been "agonized over" since the pro
gram's inception.
He said the CUS was encouraged by the task force on
Western Culture to "give the green light to the Carson
course ... with the sense that this would be a positive help
to the task force in looking at the aspects of the Area One re
quirement."
Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs, the only black faculty
member on the senate, criticized the timing of the senate
meeting at 3:15, which conflicted with memorial services for
King, in Memorial Church.
"Holding this meeting at the same time this University is
commemorating Martin Luther King's birthday and holding
a University church service at best is insensitive to what he
stood for in his life,... and at worst disrespectful."
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, chair of the senate, said,
"Obviously no disrespect was intended," and he added that
the senate could not meet on any other day.
Gibbs urged the senate to pass the proposal with
"dispatch," adding that approval would be a "fitting tribute
(to King)."
Before the senate voted, Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch said few courses at Stanford would stand up to
the scrutiny the Carson course has faced.
