# Students avoid loan burden
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Staff writer 
Although a nationwide increase in
loan-based financial aid is forcing
many students to seek higher-paying
careers, Stanford students have been
relatively unaffected by the shift from
grants to loans, according to Roberta
Johnson, associate director of Stanford
Financial Aids
The emphasis on loans has had little
impact on students here parth because
grants are a relatively small proportion
of financial aid offered by the Univer
sity. "Our office administers over 112 iO
million in loans, of which the Pell
Grant is less than 51 million, Johnson
said
At other universities, however, cut

backs in the federally funded Pell
Grant Program have forced students to
apply for Guaranteed Student Loans,
according to a recent study conducted
by UCLA.
Stanford actively tries to lessen the
loan burden students face by meeting
any decrease in Pell assistance, which
is based on need, with institutional
grant money budgeted by the Univer
sity, rather than with loans that would
commit the student after graduation.
"Stanford has felt the drop in Pell
Grants particularly in 1986-8"' The in
stitution has had to step in to find
monies to replace the need, said
Johnson. "We discourage high levels of
borrowing because we are cognizant
of the fact that a majority of our stu
dents go on to graduate school.

Experts are worried that as college
loan debts increase around the nation,
students will become more self
centered and seek better paying jobs
Alexander Astin, director of the
UCLA study, was quoted in the Jan. 11
issue of the Times Tribune as saying
that the shift to increased loan awards
has resulted in a decrease in students'
"altruism and social concern.
Astin indicated that more studenis
are headed for careers in business and
other occupations promising high
starting salaries
But students at Stanford are follow
ing a different path and becoming
more involved in public service, ac
