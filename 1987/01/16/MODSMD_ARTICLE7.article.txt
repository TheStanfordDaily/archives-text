Afghan leader offers amnesty
KABUL, Afghanistan — Najibullah, the Afghan leader, appealed yesterday
to millions of Afghan refugees to come home and live in peace.
Najibullah also announced an amnesty for army deserters and a sweep
ing hut not total release of prisoners as part of a national reconciliation ef
fort.
He acted during the first full day of a cease-fire being observed by the Af
ghan armed forces and the Soviet troops supporting them. The truce is the
first in the government's seven-year-long guerrilla war with anti-
Communist Moslem rebels known as the moujahedeen.
But there seemed to be little likelihood that the cease-fire would endure.
Diplomatic sources in Kabul said late yesterday that they had already
received reports of sporadic fighting.
Najibullah said that Kabul and Moscow had reached agreement on the
withdrawal of the Soviet forces, which were sent in seven years ago to prop
up the Communist government. He gave no details, though, and said that a
Soviet pullout would depend on what the rebels do.
Some Western analysts said the cease-fire and related declarations ap
peared to be an effort to score propaganda gains at the expense of the
guerrillas.
CIA chief in Costa Rica recalled
WASHINGTON — The CIA recalled its chief officer in Costa Rica last week
for aiding the private airlift of weapons to Nicaraguan rebels during a ban
on U.S. military aid to the contras, administration and congressional
sources said yesterday.
The intelligence agency told the Senate Intelligence Committee this
week that it recalled its station chief from the U.S. Embassy in San Jose, the
Costa Rican capital, because of "unauthorized contacts with private
benefactors' who were aiding the rebels, a knowledgeable source said.
Congress is investigating that incident as well as other reports that Lt.
Col. Oliver North, the White House aide who oversaw both the administra
tion's efforts to win private support for the contras and its secret arms sales
to Iran, received more assistance from the CIA than has previously been re
ported.
The station chief, whose name has not been divulged, is thought to have
relayed messages between contra groups in Costa Rica and members of die
secret air force operated by retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, the sources
said.
According to one source, the CIA man also passed messages about the
airlift directly to North, who was then an aide to the National Security
Council. A congressional aide said the Senate Intelligence Committee was
investigating that issue but it had not yet drawn any conclusions.
The CIA has repeatedly denied any role in the airlift, and congressional
sources noted that the agency's report to the Senate Intelligence Commit
tee condemned the station chiefs actions as unauthorized.
U.S. to allow exports
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration, responding to pressure
from the domestic oil and gas industry, yesterday lifted its controls on the
export of drilling equipment to the Soviet Union that had been imposed in
1978 to force a change in its human rights policy.
Officials emphasized that the Soviets had shown no improvement on
human rights. Instead, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the
controls"wefe bfirig fifted becau^c*thty' "have lost their impact in-the'face
of widespread foreign availability of like products" and have had a
"debilitating effect" on the U.S. oil and gas industry.
Hyman Bookbinder, special representative for the American Jewish
Committee, said he was disappointed that the administration had lifted the
controls without obtaining in return a Soviet promise for freer emigration
and better treatment of Soviet Jews.
The end of the controls on the drilling equipment came after heavy pres
sure from legislators from oil-producing states, where the local economies
are in a tailspin as a result of the decline in petroleum prices.
The Soviet Union is the largest foreign market for oil and gas drilling
equipment.
Other controls on exports, such as those of high-technology and
military-related goods to the Soviet Union and of a wide range of goods to
South Africa and Libya, were retained Wednesday
Arms talks resume in Geneva
GENEVA — The United States and the Soviet Union began a new round
of arms talks yesterday with a working lunch instead of the customary plen
ary meeting.
The new head of the Soviet delegation, Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli
Vorontsov, suggested the lunch because he had not met his American
counterpart, Ambassador Max Kampelman.
Although the new round of talks opened in the atmosphere of deadlock
that has prevailed since the breakdown of the summit meeting last October
in Iceland, there is a feeling among American officials here that a diplomat
of Vorontsovs rank and experience has not come to Geneva empty
handed.
According to U.S. sources, there has been no give at all in the Soviets' in
sistence on a "package deal'' that would limit "Star Wars" research and at
the same time reduce nuclear weapons levels.
In Iceland, President Reagan offered a 10-year extension of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which is due to expire this year, but refused to
accept any additional limits on testing and deployment of the Star Wars sys
tem. This continues to be what is described as the president's non
negotiable position.
Iran claims gains in Gulf war
NICOSIA. Cyprus — Iran said its forces made territorial gains against
Iraq on two fronts yesterday, but the Baghdad regime said it had not relin
quished "even one inch of land to the invaders.
Communiques issued by the two sides, monitored in Cyprus, indicated
that fierce fighting was still taking place, a week after Iran launched a major
offensive in the Persian Gulf War. There appeared to be general agreement
that several thousand people had been killed in the latest fighting, although
Western analysts have dismissed the extravagant casualty claims made in
the flurry of war communiques.
Iran s official news agency, IRNA. said in an early morning report yester
day that Fish Lake and its surroundings had been captured by Iranian
troops and that the Islamic forces are pressing toward Basra, several
kilometers west of Fish Lake."
A war communique transmitted by the Iraqi news agency said that the in
vaders had suffered "immense losses' in men and equipment.
Diplomatic observers in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, reported that, al
though fighting continued, the situation on both fronts appeared fairlv
static. Ihe Iranians were well entrenched on an island in the flooded
marshland around Fish Lake, the observers said.
However, they added, Iraqi forces have been heavily shelling the island
position. Most military analysts in Baghdad expressed the belief that the in
vaders would eventually be routed.
Ed. Dept. opposes AIDS class
WASHINGTON — Top federal health officials, who have advocated com
prehensive AIDS sex education as a crucial weapon for curbing the deadly
epidemic, are facing a serious challenge from officials in the Department of
Education who oppose their proposals as clinically correct but morally
empty, the Los Angeles Times has learned
The dispute has become so contentious that it has reached the White
House s Domestic Policy Council, whose members will ultimately deter
mine the administration's polio on AIDS sex education, sources in both
departments said.
