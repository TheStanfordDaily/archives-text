# UPDATE
## Planes crash above Salt Lake 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY — A commuter
airplane about to land and a private
plane that had just taken off collided
over the Salt Lake Valley yesterday, kil
ling at least 12 people and showering
debris over a residential area, authori
ties said.
Falling wreckage damaged three
houses, but there were no fires and ap
parently no one on the ground was
hurt, said Salt Lake County Fire Marshal
Frank Brown, who confirmed the
death toll.
Dozens of police, sheriffs deputies
and firefighters rushed to the snowy
crash site about 15 miles southwest of
downtown Salt Lake City and cordoned
off the neighborhood after the colli
sion between the Skywest Metroliner
and the private plane occurred shortly
before 1 p.m.
"They are picking up bodies here

and there, whenever people call us to
report them," Brown said.
There was confusion over the death
toll. Salt Lake County Sheriff Pete
Havward said 12 people — 10 from the
commuter plane — were killed in the
collision. Brown said a total of 16
people were dead.
The twin-engine jet prop Skywest
aircraft was flying from Pocatello,
Idaho, to Salt Lake International Air
port, said Dick Meyer of the Federal
Aviation Administration in Seattle. He
said it can carry 18 passengers and two
crew members.
The private plane, a blue and white
Mooney, had just taken off from Air
port No. 2, a small facility near the
crash site, Meyer said.
The accident was the first U.S. com
mercial aviation disaster of the year. It
came at a time of increasing concerns

over air safety in the wake of an Aug.
31, 1986, collision in Cerritos, of a
private plane and an Aeromexico DC-9
jetliner that killed 82 people.
Martin Bee of Kearns said he was
outdoors when he heard a collision. "I
looked up and there were just parts
flying all over. You couldn't tell one
thing or another. You couldn't tell
what was what. I was just ducking and
trying to stay out of the way of things,''
he said.
In Washington, the FAA said the
Skywest plane "disappeared from
radar" at 12:52 p.m. while flying at
7,000 feet about eight miles southwest
of the main Salt Lake City airport over
Kearns.
Tom Doyle, the airport's assistant air
traffic manager, said the plane was
about to turn into its final approach
when the collision occurred.

Visibility at the time was 30 miles
with a cloud ceiling of 7,000 feet, ac
cording to FAA spokesman Fred Farrar
in Washington. Winds up to 60 mph
were whipping through the area
shortly afterward. Several inches of
snow lay on the ground.
A temporary morgue and command
post were set up at St. Francis Xavier
Catholic Church, where pans of bodies
fell in the parking lot and on the steps
of a nearby church-run school, said
sheriffs Lt. Bill Van Wagenen.
The 80 students were immediately
evacuated uninjured from the area.
The tail sections of the planes were
located among the debris that was scat
tered in yards and streets over a one
mile area, Brown said. One large piece
of wreckage was found embedded in a
house, he added.
