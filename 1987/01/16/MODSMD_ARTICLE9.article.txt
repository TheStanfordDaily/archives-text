# TWA hijacking suspect arrested

### 
BONN, West Germany — A man suspected of
being involved in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA air
liner has been arrested in Frankfurt, West German of
ficials announced yesterday.
The man, identified as Mohammed Ali Hamadi, 22,
a Lebanese, was arrested at the Frankfurt airport after
customs inspectors found he was carrying "material
that could be explosives."
After Hamadi was fingerprinted, it was discovered
that his prints matched some found aboard the
hijacked TWA jetliner, according to U.S. military
sources in West Germany.
Hamadi is suspected of being one of the three men
who, on June 14, 1985, hijacked TWA flight 847 en
route from Athens, Greece, to Rome. The plane was
diverted to Beirut, Lebanon, where one of the pas
sengers, U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem, was killed.
Thirty-nine other Americans were held for 16 days
before they were set free.

U.S. Department of Justice officials in Washington
said they would ask the Bonn government to ex
tradite the suspect to the United States for trial. Ger
man officials in Bonn said they would raise no objec
tion to the extradition.
"The man ... is a big fish," Interior Minister
Friedrich Zimmerman said.
Patrick Korten, a Department of Justice spokes
man, said, "We would very much like to have him
sent to the United States to have him face charges
pending against him. We are discussing it with the
Germans."
Korten described the TWA incident as "one of the
most despicable acts of international terrorism ever
carried out against Americans, and we would like to
see him face the music."
Hamadi and two others were named in criminal
complaints and warrants issued by a federal court in
Washington in July of 1985. All three are charged

with air piracy and murder.
German officals in Frankfurt said that Hamadi was
arrested Tuesday after he arrived from Beirut aboard
a Middle East Airlines flight. Customs officials at the
airport found three wine bottles in his carry-on
luggage containing methyl nitrate, a fluid similar to
nitroglycerin that is sometimes used in making ex
plosives.
A police spokesman said the suspect denied
knowing that the bottles contained explosives. He
told the police that the bottles were a gift.
The three hijackers of flight 847, thought to be Shia
Moslems belonging to the extremist Hezbollah (Party
of God) organization, released most of the pas
sengers in the first few days after they took over the
plane but detained 39 male hostages who were not
freed until after intervention by Syrian officials and
leaders of the Lebanese Shia Moslem Amal militia.
