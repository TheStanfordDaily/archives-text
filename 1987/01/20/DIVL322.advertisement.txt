Whatever the assignment Pilot has the formula
for writing comfort and precision.
Pilot's Better Ball Point Pen, in medium and fine points,
lets you breeze through long note-taking sessions. In fact
we've made writer's fatigue a thing of the past' This crystal barreled
veteran of the campus has a ribbed finger grip for continuous comfort
and is perfectly balanced for effortless writing. Best of all, you'll never
throw it out because it's refillable.
The perfect teammate to the Better Ball Point Pen is Pilot's
Pencilier o.smm mechanical pencil. It has a continuous lead feed
system and a cushion tip that helps eliminate the frustration of lead
breakage. The Pencilier's jumbo eraser does the job cleanly while
the ribbed grip offers the same comfort as the Better Ball Point Pen.
