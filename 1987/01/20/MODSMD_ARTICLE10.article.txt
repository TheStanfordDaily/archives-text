# UPDATE
## Reagan will testify about NSC 
### 
WASHINGTON — White House special counselor
David Abshire said yesterday that President Reagan
will submit to questions from a special review board
investigating procedures of the National Security
Council.
A Washington Post story yesterday quoted adminis
tration sources as saying that Reagan had "rebuffed"
the board's request for an interview because of a
change in its strategy in dealing with the Iran contro
versy. The Post said Reagan would appear before the
body, but that the White House did not want him
answering questions about the affair until a fuller ac
count of what had happened was assembled.
Abshire disputed this story, saying that Reagan had
agreed when he created the board under chairman
ship of former Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) to be inter
viewed by it and that it was only "a matter of working
out a mutually convenient time." Abshire said that
"Sen. Tower is very much looking forward (to the in
terview) sometime after the State of the Union" ad
dress Jan. 27. Reagan is currently recuperating from
prostate surgery.
This timetable would require a two-week exten
sion in the life of the board, which had been sched
uled to complete work by Jan. 31. In addition to

Tower, the board includes Edmund Muskie, secre
tary of state in the Carter administration, and Brent
Scowcroft, who served as President Ford's national
security adviser.
The board is supposed to investigate NSC proce
dures, but spokesmen for the panel have said that to
accomplish this it will be necessary to establish a
chronology of die clandestine Iranian arms deal and
the apparent diversion of some of the proceeds of
this sale to the Nicaraguan contras.
In an interview testerday in his fourth-floor office
of the Executive Office Building, Abshire said he
would not independently investigate the Iran contro
versy but would try to "break bottlenecks" and assist
congressional and legal inquiries.
Abshire's definition of his role was more limited
than the one given Friday by White House spokes
man Albert Brashear, who said that Abshire, along
with White House counsel Peter Wallison, "are in the
process of assembling what we have in our posses
sion that would indicate what exactly transpired."
Citing what he said were lessons learned from"the
Watergate period," Abshire said that "the most inap
propriate thing would be for for my office to start in
dependently putting out facts and conclusions and

become involved in piecemeal reactions."
When Abshire was appointed as special counselor
Dec. 26 a White House statement said that he would
have independent access to the president and "will
head a team that will coordinate White House activi
ties in all aspects of the Iran matter."
Ever since the Iran arms deals were disclosed early
in November, the president and other White House
officials have found it difficult to present a coherent
chronology of what happened. Reagan's first speech
on the subject on Nov. 13 was based on a chronology
by his since-fired NSC aide, Lt. Col. Oliver North. The
White House has refused to make public this
chronology and now claims that key portions are
suspect.
Administration officials have shifted their focus
from Reagan's early emphasis on making all the facts
public to one of providing information to the two
congressional investigating committees, the indepen
dent counsel who is investigating to see if crimes
have been committed and the Tower board. Abshire
said yesterday that his job "is to help these indepen
dent, credible bodies to do their work."
