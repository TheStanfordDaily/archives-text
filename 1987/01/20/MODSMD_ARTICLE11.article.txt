# Dollar plummets to post-war low
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The dollar
plunged yesterday to its lowest level
against the Japanese yen since just after
World War 11, amid speculation the
world's major industrial nations soon
will be forced to take new actions to
buttress the dollar.
Representatives of the five major in
dustrial powers — the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain and
France — could meet any time after
the West German elections Sunday.
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa will meet late tomorrow in
Washington with Treasury Secretary
James Baker 111 to discuss the mone
tary situation. The meeting, according
to administration sources, was made at
the request of Miyazawa.
Baker is scheduled to see Miyazawa
after he returns from a one-day trip to
Canada to meet with Canadian trade of
ficials.

The next meeting of the five indus
trial powers, known as the Group of
Five, would not normally be held until
early April in Washington as a prelimi
nary to the spring meetings of the In
ternational Monetary Fund and the
World Bank.
It was the Group of Five that
originally orchestrated the devaluation
of the dollar at a meeting at the Plaza
Hotel in New York in September 1985
in an effort to lower the record U.S.
trade deficit.
The Reagan administration appears
concerned that the trade deficit will
continue to be a drag on the American
economy, unless there is a further sub
stantial devaluation of the dollar. The
U.S. trade deficit is running at a record
annual rate of $170 billion for the first
11 months of 1986. A continued slide
in the value of the dollar could help
reduce the trade deficit by making

American exports cheaper and
therefore more competitive.
But many economists warn that such
a slide also presents a danger that
higher priced exports could contribute
to a new inflationary spiral, especially
by providing an economic shield for
American producers, who might other
wise cut prices.
There is also concern that a rapid
plunge of the dollar would shake con
fidence in the United States economy,
discouraging the flow of investment
money from abroad that now helps
finance the huge federal deficit. If that
were to happen, interest rates here
would have to rise to attract investment
funds at home to replace the flow from
abroad.
Japanese and West German officials
again made clear yesterday that they
fear a plunging dollar will cause a
skyrocketing of their own currencies

and may bring about recession in their
economies. This would make it hard
for them to buy American goods, the
U.S. objective in lowering the value of
the dollar.
Baker "has the power to destroy us,"
said a German official, referring to a
Newsweek report this week claiming
Baker wants the German mark to ap
preciate to 1.70 to the dollar. "We can't
sustain that, it would bring us down,"
the official said.
In Tokyo, the dollar slid at one point
below the 150-yen mark for the first
time since 1949, to 149.88 yen, before
recovering to close at 150.45 yen with
the help of about $2 billion worth of
intervention by the Japanese central
bank. The Friday close had been
15310 yen.
