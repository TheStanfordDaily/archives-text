The California public school system, long a victim of
tax cuts and public indifference, has been dealt yet an
other cruel blow in Gov. George Deukmejian's 1987-88
state budget proposal.
Deukmejian has proposed a budget that would reduce
the state's overall commitment to education, as well as
eliminate many special educational programs for gifted
students, urban schools and minorities.
The governor's proposed budget, made public earlier
this month, projects a mere 4 percent increase in state
education spending for fiscal 1987-88, down markedly
from a 10 percent increase last year. According to Educa
tion Prof. Michael Kirst, inflation and increased numbers
of students will almost certainly offset Deukmejian's pro
posed 4 percent increase in funding. California Superin
tendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig predicts the end
result will be a significant cut in constant dollars commit
ted to education.
Sadly, California already spends 20 to 30 percent less
money on education than do most other large industrial
states. Deukmejian's proposal to slash the education
budget even more next year is disastrously unfair to the
children of the state.
Although California is certainly wealthy enough to
support a first-rate public education system, it has not
done so. California consistently lags behind most states
in comparative studies of education quality. For exam

ple, according to James Guthrie, U.C.-Berkeley education
professor, California has the worst teacher-to-student
ratio of any state in the nation except Utah.
Measures must be taken immediately to remedy the
unfortunate neglect of California public education.
First, taxes should be raised. Up to a point, fiscal con
servatism of the sort Deukmejian advocates is healthy.
But the education of California's children is far too im
portant to be sacrificed for the sake of tidy accounting.
Second, the 1979 Gann Initiative, which limits state
spending, must be repealed. The Gann Initiative, an
amendment to the state constitution, restricts the annual
growth rate of state government spending to no more
than the rate of inflation plus or minus the annual rate of
population growth. University of California President
David Gardner, joined by Kirst and other scholars, points
out that the initiative has failed to keep up with rapid
growth in the need for government services, including
education.
Over the past few years, the Gann Initiative's restric
tions, combined with a decline in state tax revenues,
have led to a financial crunch in the state government
that threatens to cripple the state's public education sys
tem.
Deukmejian and the people of California must recog
nize the crucial importance of public education and take
immediate steps to give it the support it needs.
