Objectivity needed
in Middle East
In a recent viewpoint (Daily, Jan.
14), Isaac Winer returns once again to
the Middle East, a region he feels
strongly about. I don't have time for a
full discussion of his analysis;
however, there are one or two points
I would like to make.
The Palestinian people are a nation.
They may or may not have been a
nation 40 years ago, but today,
through the circumstances of history,
they are undeniably a nation. And, I
might add, their nationality is not
Jordanian. Administration of their
territories — which have yet to be
defined — by Jordan, joindy with
Israel or otherwise, will not fulfill
their quest for national autonomy.
Tell me, Mr. Winer, with Israel
"calling the shots," whose views will
the Palestinian moderates be express
ing? Their own? Possibly, but it would
be naive to expect that views that
dissent much from the Israeli line
would be heard. The Palestinians,
however, have some opinions that do
dissent from the Israeli, Jordanian and
American views. So, who would these
moderates be representing?
I am very far from being a sup
porter of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. But it is not for us —
Mr. Winer as an American, King Hus
sein as a Jordanian or myself as an
Israeli — to choose for the Pales
tinians who will represent their na
tional interests.
Acts of terror are despicable in
every form, and the murder of Eliahu
Amedi is a tragedy and a disgrace to
the Palestinians. But the death of two
Palestinian students is also a great
tragedy. You may want to relegate
them to a list of anonymous statistics,

but they also had names. Their
families suffered losses equal to those
suffered by Amedi's. To the Palestinian
people they are martyrs.
Mr. Winer, if you intend to "make
some sense of the matter," you would
do well to listen to all sides in the
conflict objectively. Your analysis
should be free of your own prejudg
ments. In international relations,
tunnel vision is as harmful as short
sightedness.

Anaya ignored
will of people
I must say that I agree wholeheart
edly with Allen C. Estes' column on
the deplorable actions of former New
Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya (Daily, Jan.
12).
As Estes points out, Anaya's "sins
against society" are twofold: He vio
lated the democratic element of the
American political system by reversing
a decision clearly favored by his con
stituency without fear of public dis
favor, and more specifically, he
endowed five clearly incorrigible and
vicious criminals with a potential for
freedom and thus a potential to once
again pose a formidable threat to
society. In commuting the sentences
of these five death-row inmates, each
of whom committed several heinous
crimes, Anaya showed an utter disre
gard for both the victims and the
families of those killed, abused and
maimed; to call Anaya a public servant
would truly be a farce.
Within this particular issue lies a
profound and far-reaching question:
What flaw in our political system is it
that allows one man completely to
disregard the views of the people and
perform an a a that could potentially

lead to the freedom of hardened
criminals and the subsequent suffer
ing and even death of countless inno
cent Americans? Until this question is
answered, the Toney Anayas of our
nation will have a field day at the
expense of the American people.

Freshman, undeclared
Theme houses
foster diversity
We, the members of Haus Mit
teleuropa, would like to respond to a
recent editorial (Daily, Jan. 14).
The editorial seems to reflect a
recent paranoia among students that
the campus will become inundated
with theme houses. While we can
understand this fear, we feel that the
editorial was unconstructive in its
criticism and further clouded the
theme house issue. We would like to
make some clarifications.
We take particular issue with The
Daily's claim that theme houses are
merely an enclave for "like-minded
students" with identical majors and
narrowly defined interests. We think
The Daily owes Haus Mitt a visit to see
what a theme house can really be. No,
you won't see us running around in
Lederhosen, practicing our latest verb
conjugations. Rather, you would meet
a collection of 32 Stanford students
with 20 different majors ranging from
electrical engineering to English
(there are only two German majors in
the house). We have interests such as
polo, flying, jazz guitar and creative
writing — in addition to our common
interest in German language and
culture. And we have such ongoing
activities as volleyball, soccer and
hiking trips to go along with our
theme-related German conversation
classes, folk singing, film series, semi

nars and classes. Indeed, we have not
isolated ourselves from the commu
nity; our programs attract students
from all over campus as well as
people from the surrounding commu
nity.
Does The Daily really believe Bran
ner offers "the most intellectually
stimulating program" on campus?
Sure, Branner has a noteworthy pro
gram of speakers on various topics.
But theme houses can offer a
coherent program of events that allow
one to follow through on a specific
topic or issue and actually learn. Even
clubs do not offer this kind of expo
sure.
We wonder as well how The Daily
can state that "themes seem to be
almost foisted on residences and are
little jmore than artificial designa
tions.'*' Nothing could be further from
the truth. In order for any theme
house to get started, it must demon
strate strong student interest and
faculty support. Each year, existing
theme houses must prove student
interest through draw results in order
to survive. These are the controls that
prevent theme houses from taking
over the campus. They only exist
because students want them to exist.
At Haus Mitt, the theme provides
something very essential: It is our
common ground. Rather than having a
cacophony of different interests with
nothing in common, we all share an
interest in German language and
culture (Central Europe), and many of
us have had experiences overseas.
This unifies us as one house of very
diverse people.
Themes unnecessary? Doch!

Objectivity needed
in Middle East
In a recent viewpoint (Daily, Jan.
14), Isaac Winer returns once again to
the Middle East, a region he feels
strongly about. I don't have time for a
full discussion of his analysis;
however, there are one or two points
I would like to make.
The Palestinian people are a nation.
They may or may not have been a
nation 40 years ago, but today,
through the circumstances of history,
they are undeniably a nation. And, I
might add, their nationality is not
Jordanian. Administration of their
territories — which have yet to be
defined — by Jordan, joindy with
Israel or otherwise, will not fulfill
their quest for national autonomy.
Tell me, Mr. Winer, with Israel
"calling the shots," whose views will
the Palestinian moderates be express
ing? Their own? Possibly, but it would
be naive to expect that views that
dissent much from the Israeli line
would be heard. The Palestinians,
however, have some opinions that do
dissent from the Israeli, Jordanian and
American views. So, who would these
moderates be representing?
I am very far from being a sup
porter of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. But it is not for us —
Mr. Winer as an American, King Hus
sein as a Jordanian or myself as an
Israeli — to choose for the Pales
tinians who will represent their na
tional interests.
Acts of terror are despicable in
every form, and the murder of Eliahu
Amedi is a tragedy and a disgrace to
the Palestinians. But the death of two
Palestinian students is also a great
tragedy. You may want to relegate
them to a list of anonymous statistics,

but they also had names. Their
families suffered losses equal to those
suffered by Amedi's. To the Palestinian
people they are martyrs.
Mr. Winer, if you intend to "make
some sense of the matter," you would
do well to listen to all sides in the
conflict objectively. Your analysis
should be free of your own prejudg
ments. In international relations,
tunnel vision is as harmful as short
sightedness.

Anaya ignored
will of people
I must say that I agree wholeheart
edly with Allen C. Estes' column on
the deplorable actions of former New
Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya (Daily, Jan.
12).
As Estes points out, Anaya's "sins
against society" are twofold: He vio
lated the democratic element of the
American political system by reversing
a decision clearly favored by his con
stituency without fear of public dis
favor, and more specifically, he
endowed five clearly incorrigible and
vicious criminals with a potential for
freedom and thus a potential to once
again pose a formidable threat to
society. In commuting the sentences
of these five death-row inmates, each
of whom committed several heinous
crimes, Anaya showed an utter disre
gard for both the victims and the
families of those killed, abused and
maimed; to call Anaya a public servant
would truly be a farce.
Within this particular issue lies a
profound and far-reaching question:
What flaw in our political system is it
that allows one man completely to
disregard the views of the people and
perform an a a that could potentially

lead to the freedom of hardened
criminals and the subsequent suffer
ing and even death of countless inno
cent Americans? Until this question is
answered, the Toney Anayas of our
nation will have a field day at the
expense of the American people.

Freshman, undeclared
Theme houses
foster diversity
We, the members of Haus Mit
teleuropa, would like to respond to a
recent editorial (Daily, Jan. 14).
The editorial seems to reflect a
recent paranoia among students that
the campus will become inundated
with theme houses. While we can
understand this fear, we feel that the
editorial was unconstructive in its
criticism and further clouded the
theme house issue. We would like to
make some clarifications.
We take particular issue with The
Daily's claim that theme houses are
merely an enclave for "like-minded
students" with identical majors and
narrowly defined interests. We think
The Daily owes Haus Mitt a visit to see
what a theme house can really be. No,
you won't see us running around in
Lederhosen, practicing our latest verb
conjugations. Rather, you would meet
a collection of 32 Stanford students
with 20 different majors ranging from
electrical engineering to English
(there are only two German majors in
the house). We have interests such as
polo, flying, jazz guitar and creative
writing — in addition to our common
interest in German language and
culture. And we have such ongoing
activities as volleyball, soccer and
hiking trips to go along with our
theme-related German conversation
classes, folk singing, film series, semi

nars and classes. Indeed, we have not
isolated ourselves from the commu
nity; our programs attract students
from all over campus as well as
people from the surrounding commu
nity.
Does The Daily really believe Bran
ner offers "the most intellectually
stimulating program" on campus?
Sure, Branner has a noteworthy pro
gram of speakers on various topics.
But theme houses can offer a
coherent program of events that allow
one to follow through on a specific
topic or issue and actually learn. Even
clubs do not offer this kind of expo
sure.
We wonder as well how The Daily
can state that "themes seem to be
almost foisted on residences and are
little jmore than artificial designa
tions.'*' Nothing could be further from
the truth. In order for any theme
house to get started, it must demon
strate strong student interest and
faculty support. Each year, existing
theme houses must prove student
interest through draw results in order
to survive. These are the controls that
prevent theme houses from taking
over the campus. They only exist
because students want them to exist.
At Haus Mitt, the theme provides
something very essential: It is our
common ground. Rather than having a
cacophony of different interests with
nothing in common, we all share an
interest in German language and
culture (Central Europe), and many of
us have had experiences overseas.
This unifies us as one house of very
diverse people.
