# Compromise needed in Middle East
## 
### 
If you are interested in the Arab-Israeli conflict, I
urge you to read Isaac Winer's recent viewpoint, an
ultra-biased concoction of cliches (Daily, Jan. 14). It
indeed provides a good example of the kind of
ridiculously simple rhetoric each side has been using
for 40 years to feed the hatred between the Jews and
the Arabs.

First, Winer explains the situation. On the one
hand, there is the ruthless, bloodthirsty Palestine
Liberation Organization. On the other hand, there is
the well-intentioned Israeli Army (Sorry! I meant the
"Israeli Defense Force"), which opens fire on ex
tremely dangerous rock-th rowing Arab students to
"defend itself'; however, it is so kind that it does
everything not to hurt the rioters: It shoots "at their
feet, killing two and wounding 11 (sic)." The solution
that Winer advocates is directly derived from his
Manichean analysis of the issue: The PLO should
burn in the fire of hell, Israel should be admitted to
Olympus.
Winer completely disregards the reasons why
there is an Arab-Israeli conflict in the first place and
the processes that led to Palestinian terrorism. He is
only concerned with its existence, not with its causes:
His condemnation of the PLO therefore rests on the
following syllogism: Those who use terrorism are
bad; the PLO uses terrorism; therefore the PLO is
bad.
Every reasonable person would probably agree
with me to assert that indeed terrorism must be con
demned. But history suggests that Zionists have dis
played since 1948 a considerable amount of the ter
rorism that today they paradoxically condemn. On

April 2, 1948, they massacred the population of the
Palestinian village of Deir Yassine. Some Israelis
argue that Zionists never attacked the Arab popula
tion; they claim that Palestinians peacefully "sold
their land" (yes, the whole country). Apart from the
unlikelihood of such an event, no serious historian
argues that there were no terrorist acts committed by
the Zionists against the Arab population. Even Moshe
Dayan, the Israeli general who won the 1956 war on
behalf of his country — and who was among the
most extreme members of several Israeli govern
ments — was honest enough to recognize that the
Zionists took control of Palestine by violent means
before they were attacked by the Arab countries in
1948. In 1958, he declared during the funeral of a
young Israeli soldier killed in the kibbutz of Nahal-
Oz, near Gaza: "Let us not accuse those who have
killed this boy and let us not complain against their
hatred. They have been living for eight years in
refugee camps in Gaza, watching us appropriate the
land and the villages of their ancestors." In 1967,
after the Six Day War, he remarked: "We come in an
inhabited country, and we build in it the Jewish state.
The Arabs will not accept our enterprise. We are con
demned to remain at war forever. We are an alien
being transplanted in this region that the other or
gans are rejecting."
More recently, there have been many terrorist
operations committed by the army and the intelli
gence services of Israel throughout the world. They
have usually shown a stupefying contempt for inter
national law and human rights. They have included:
• Dec. 26, 1968: At the airport of Athens, two Arabs
throw hand grenades at an Israeli airplane. On Dec.
28, airborne Israeli commandos destroy 13 civilian
Lebanese airplanes in the international airport of
Beirut. The "military action" of Israel is unanimously

condemned by the Security Council of the United Na
tions.
• Dec. 24-25,1969: Five warships that the French had
refused to sell to Israel because of an embargo
enacted after the Beirut operation are "seized" by Is
raeli commandos and leave the French port of Cher
bourg overnight.
• Jan. 3, 1970: Israeli commandos abduct 11 civilians
and 10 soldiers from Lebanon.
• Feb. 21, 1973: A lost Libyan airliner flies over the
Sinai. It is shot down by the Israeli air force (105
dead).
• April 10, 1973: Israeli commandos murder three
moderate Palestinian leaders in Beirut. Israel is con
demned by the Security Council on April 21.
I have not added to this list the daily morning
"stretchings" of Israeli jet pilots (bombing Palestin
ian refugee camps in Lebanon), and I have only men
tioned acts publicly condemned by the international
community.
Therefore, if we judge terrorists without referring
to the reasons why they a a in a terrorist fashion, then
the Zionists are as condemnable as the Palestinians.
The whole point of Winer's article is therefore
meaningless. Obviously, both sides have used cruel
means. Thus, we can t conclude that the Israelis are
the "good guys" and the supporters of the PLO (i.e.,
the vast majority of Palestinians) the "villains."
Winer would do well to learn that Middle Eastern
politics is not a movie. People suffer and die. If he is
truly looking for peace in the Middle East, Winer
should wonder why there is an Arab-Israeli conflict
in the first place and what compromise can be found
between the Palestinians and the Zionists.
