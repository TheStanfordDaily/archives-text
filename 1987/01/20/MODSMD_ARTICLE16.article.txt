# Checking out the new quarter
## 
### 
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.
Finals week is over and Lyon's is open
again. Here we are, practically three
weeks into a brand new year, or so
they say. January always strikes me as a
spectacularly odd time to make New
Year's resolutions. The year begins in
late September for most of us, when
we come back to school. But January
does have this going for it: It comes
after that hedonistic blitz of December.
It feels good to make new resolutions.
Sure, we pigged out over break and
began to really appreciate people, but
we're going to be better this year.
Really. So. Here we are, three weeks
later, and how are we doing?

I called up some of my friends to
find out. Don't tell me about the minor
ones, I said. Tell me how you've
managed the two biggies on your list.
Said Julia, "I've managed to get all
my work done before I go to the city or
watch TV, except for 'Moonlighting.' "
Said she, "I've skipped two of my after
noon classes this week to sleep, well,
Bee's modeling session was so tiring
... but I haven't watched TV ... except
for 'Gone With The Wind.' "
Bee said he resolved to have less to
do with fair weather friends, and to be
less touchy.
"Which fair weather friends are you
talking about?" I said.
He said he didn't have any now, that
the ones I was thinking about — you
know, those people he was talking to at
the Underground last Saturday —
really were his friends now, and they
had to come to dinner and every
thing
Cattrine had resolved to get more
sleep and to have fewer crushes. I
wondered which crushes she'd
crossed off so far.
She raised her purple eyebrows
above her green eyes. "But that's just
it," she said. "They're all so nice. I've
been up all night thinking about it."
I began to see how this was going to
go. I decided to stop calling Tri-Sigs
and call some of my normal-looking
friends. This was much less successful.

Gem was out of town having a medi
cal school interview. Missy was up in
the city renting videos with her Pakis
tani boyfriend. My Irish-Chinese
housemate, having completed his
quals just last week, seems to be living
entirely for pleasure now. 1 called
home from DVB last night around 1
a.m. to see if there were any messages.
I was afraid 1 might wake him, but 1
was expecting a message from the In
visible-Girl and her boyfriend Armand,
who were supposed to have met us
there the hour before. The club was
pretty slow, and I wanted to know if
they were still coming — that is to say,
if we could leave yet.
"I've just come in,"he said. "Do you
want me to check the answering ma
chine?"
I.G. showed up at 1:45 a.m. "Gwen,"
she said, "we have to do something
with your hair." Fortunately, she had
her purple comb with her. I always
find it disconcerting when she teases
my hair without it, as it looks like I am
slowly being exposed to an electrical
storm.
"How was your break?" she said.
"Oh, fine. It snowed in Jersey."
"Good old New Jersey."
"And how was Gstaad?"
"Very cold. But Armand built the
most darling fire...The comb
paused four inches over my head.
I asked her about her New Year's
resolutions. "I.G. must not change at
all," said Armand.
"Well, there's always punctuality," I
said.
"That's easy for you to say," said I.G.
"You can see what you look like. It
takes me forever to put an outfit to
gether."
Did I mention that Lyon's is open
again? It seems my advice to I.G. last
quarter was unintentionally truthful. It
had simply closed to renovate. It's true
the carpeting is no longer paisley, and
the cozy oranges and browns have
been replasced by tacky California
peaches and greens. The pyramid
breakfasts are still going strong,
though, as are the teriyaki burgers. As
far as I can tell — and it may be a little
too soon to tell — the character of the
place remains the same.
After all, it's awfully hard to change
something as fundamental as charac
ter.
