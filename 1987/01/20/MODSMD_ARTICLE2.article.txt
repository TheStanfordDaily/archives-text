Students celebrating the long
weekend under the full moon
Thursday night got out of hand by early
Friday morning, and residents of 553
Mayfield and Hurlburt reported dama
ges to their houses and cars.
Students milling around the corner
of Mayfield Drive, where the Sigma Chi
residence, 553 Mayfield and the Beta
Theta Pi residence are located,
reportedly tore a drinking fountain
from a wall, ransacked bathrooms and
urinated on the lawns in front of the
houses. Fights also broke out.
At Hurlburt, holes were made in
third floor walls, a fire alarm was
pulled, a door was wrenched from its
hinges and one fire extinguisher was
turned on near the base of a stairway
leading to the third floor. Hurlburt res
ident Jay Murry estimated the damages
will run between $1,000 and $2,000.
Beta fraternity members called the
Stanford Police Department when
members of the now-unrecognized
Delta Upsilon fraternity began
"disturbing" bicycles and throwing
palm fronds, according to Beta Resi
dent Assistant Eric Croft.
A group of DU members were inside
the Beta house and attempted to get
behind the bar in order to serve them
selves alcohol, according to Croft.
"When it got to that point, we shut
the whole party down and threw (the
DUs) out," he said.
But once outside, the group contin
ued to cause a disturbance, prompting
the Betas to phone the police, Croft
said.
"The DU president was there, and
he tried to calm them down, but some
just insisted on making trouble," Croft
added.
Neither DU members nor the Stan
ford Police Department could be
reached for comment last night.
"It was an animal house," said senior
Chip Atterbury, resident assistant at
553 Mayfield. "I don't know what
caused it all, but it was the worst I've
ever seen."
Atterbury said he returned to 553
Mayfield at 12:30 a.m. Friday and heard
a loud clang followed by footsteps
retreating down the hallway. Darin
Greenen, a resident of 553, said he also
heard a "thunk" but saw nothing when
he peered out into the hallway from
his second floor room. Later both dis
covered that the second floor drinking
fountain had been torn from the wall.
Soon after, at least one person
returned to ransack the second floor
bathroom, Atterbury said. Though resi
dents did not see or hear the bathroom
being vandalized, they found soap
dishes placed in urinals, soap thrown
on mirrors, water splashed around the
bathroom and tissue paper strewn
about.
Atterbury said he walked to the front
of the house and saw a number of
people outside. "They were all just ran
dom students," he said. "It didn't seem
like they were connected at all with the
fraternities that were around."
