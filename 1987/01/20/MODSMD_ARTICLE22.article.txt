## What price athletics? Public forum will examine financial problems 
### SEAN KINCH Staff writer 
Have you ever had difficulty finding
a locker in Encina Gym? Do you feel
that students should have more oppor
tunities to play indoor basketball? Have
you ever wondered where the football
program gets the money to maintain
90 athletes on full scholarships?
Students can now explore these
questions and any other issues of con
cern within the Athletic Department
through the newly re-formed Student
Athletics Committee.
The committee will hold its first
public meeting tonight at 7:30 in the
Cypress South room of Tresidder Un
ion. All subsequent meetings will also
be public.
The goals of the SAC are to analyze
the financial efficiency of the Athletic
Department during the past 10 years
and the organization and management
within the department, said organizer
George Pegelow. In addition, the SAC
will review the department's long-term
goals and will look into some specific

areas of possible improvement.
Among the specific areas of concern
for the SAC are funding for club sports,
the implementation of new training
techniques and the relatively poor
fundraising for women's sports, added
Pegelow, head kenpo and karate in
structor.

Lena Slachmuijlder, ASSU senator
and chairperson of the Student Affairs
Committee, will moderate the first
meetings. She said she feels the athle
tic committee can work with the com
munity to make positive changes in the
Athletic Department.
"People from the community can
come to us and work through us to
come upon alternatives to Athletic De
partment operations," said
Slachmuijlder.

Pegelow emphasized that the SAC
will be making suggestions to the Ath
letic Department. The intent of the
committee, he said, is to provide the
Stanford community with an open
forum to express dissatisfaction about
the Athletic Department and to explore
ways to remedy any deficiencies.
The SAC was formed in 1977 when a
group of community members, includ
ing Pegelow, saw problems within the
Athletic Department. At the time, the
University was having financial diffi
culty adhering to the regulations of the
NCAA's Title IX legislation, which re
quires colleges to provide equal op
portunities in athletics for women. The
community members were also con
cerned that the Athletic Department
was not responsive enough to the
changing needs of the public.
To evaluate these problems and to
identify other areas in need of im
provement, they proposed a plan to
the President's Office to survey the stu
dent body. The committee also en
listed the services of several key fig
ures in Stanford athletics, including

then starting quarterback Guy Ben
jamin.
The President's Office approved the
idea and allocated $12,000 to the SAC.
The committee then distributed a
lengthy questionnaire to the student
body that resulted in a thorough report
to the University on student percep
tions of the Athletic Department.
Using the information gained from
the survey, the SAC made several
recommendations to the Athletic De
partment. According to Pegelow, some
of the recommendations were adopted
by the department, including the ex
pansion of the weight room facilities
available to students, but many others

were rejected.
Over the past decade, the SAC has
periodically held informal meetings to
monitor the Athletic Department and
to explore particular areas of interest,
such as the formation of the boxing
and weight lifting clubs, said Pegelow.
However, the SAC has not made a thor
ough evaluation of the department
since 1977.
Several financial analysis experts, in
cluding Engineering Economics Sys
tems Prof. Ronald Howard, have
agreed to aid the SAC in its evaluation
of budget performance and manage
ment within the Athletic Department,
Pegelow added.
He has also gained the support of
the National Football League Player's
Association, with which he has a per
sonal affiliation. David Meggyesy, a
former St. Louis Cardinals football
player and current western director of
the NFLPA, has volunteered to help the

SAC's investigations.
speaker series sponsored by the SAC.
Tennis Coach Dick Gould said he
believes an evaluation of the Athletic-
Department could be beneficial as
long as it is carried out in a positive
and open manner.
"Evaluation is good as long as the
entire constituency is represented, in
cluding coaches and administration,"
Gould said. He added that, if asked, he
would help the SAC "as long as it is a
constructive thing" and if "whatever is
done is done in a positive way."
Track Coach Brooks Johnson does
not feel that the SAC should not make
an evaluation of the Athletic Depart
ment because the department is
already doing that itself. He said the
idea of the SAC making a financial eval
uation "seems presumptuous" and that
he would participate with the commit
tee "only if 1 felt it wasn't a duplication
of efforts."
