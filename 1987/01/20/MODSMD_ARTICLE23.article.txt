## Card comes up short in long weekend Stanford falls 77-70 to 'Cats

TUCSON, Ariz. â€” First Stanford had to face Kevin
Johnson. Then the Cardinal ran into Arizona's Sean Elliott.
The 6-foot-8 sophomore even outdid the 31-point career
high performance that California's Johnson had Saturday
against Stanford with his own career-high 35 points in
Arizona's 77-70 win at McKale Center last night. The Wildcat
forward also led both teams with 13 rebounds.
"The great players hurt us," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "Elliott had a very great game."
Junior forward Eric Reveno agreed. "We have trouble
with the great players; we struggle against them.''
It was obvious Stanford couldn't handle him,'' Arizona
Coach Lute Olson said.
He basically hurt us by himself," said Stanford point
guard Terry Taylor, who tied his career high with 15 points.
"If you take him away, we probably would have won the
game. He was everywhere."
Had the Wildcats been without Elliott, Stanford (10-7,4-4)
probably would have won the game, because most of the
rest of the Arizona team turned in subpar performances. El
liott surpassed his season average of 17.1 points per game,
but sophomore Anthony Cook, playing at the other forward
position, could manage only four points despite averaging
11.7 points per game on the year. Junior Craig McMillan, the
star shooting guard, was just 3-of-9 from the field.
McMillan's clutch 8-of-8 free-throw shooting made up for
his quiet night from the floor, however, especially as most
of those points came in the second half.

CaPs Kevin Johnson rose above the rest of the players in the first hall of Saturday's game at Harmon Gym. The 6-1 guard gave the
sellout crowd plenty to scream about, making his first 10 shots.
