## Card comes up short in long weekend Stanford falls 77-70 to 'Cats 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
TUCSON, Ariz. — First Stanford had to face Kevin
Johnson. Then the Cardinal ran into Arizona's Sean Elliott.
The 6-foot-8 sophomore even outdid the 31-point career
high performance that California's Johnson had Saturday
against Stanford with his own career-high 35 points in
Arizona's 77-70 win at McKale Center last night. The Wildcat
forward also led both teams with 13 rebounds.
"The great players hurt us," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "Elliott had a very great game."
Junior forward Eric Reveno agreed. "We have trouble
with the great players; we struggle against them.''
It was obvious Stanford couldn't handle him,'' Arizona
Coach Lute Olson said.
He basically hurt us by himself," said Stanford point
guard Terry Taylor, who tied his career high with 15 points.
"If you take him away, we probably would have won the
game. He was everywhere."
Had the Wildcats been without Elliott, Stanford (10-7,4-4)
probably would have won the game, because most of the
rest of the Arizona team turned in subpar performances. El
liott surpassed his season average of 17.1 points per game,
but sophomore Anthony Cook, playing at the other forward
position, could manage only four points despite averaging
11.7 points per game on the year. Junior Craig McMillan, the
star shooting guard, was just 3-of-9 from the field.
McMillan's clutch 8-of-8 free-throw shooting made up for
his quiet night from the floor, however, especially as most
of those points came in the second half.

sellout crowd plenty to scream about, making his first 10 shots.
halftime trailing 33-27, despite the fact
that scoring leader Todd Lichti had
only three points in the half.
The Cardinal battled back to take a
45-44 lead widi 14:05 left in the second
half — the team's only lead of the
game — but then dropped back again,
down 58-48 at one point, following a
two-minute period that saw Taylor pick
up his third and fourth fouls and Scott
Meinert, his replacement, pick up
numbers one and two.
"I made a couple of dumb fouls at
the end of the game," said Taylor, whr
fouled out with 26 seconds left to play.

"I had to come out, and it hurt our
team a little bit."
Meanwhile, Reveno, who also fouled
out, was turning in another steady per
formance for Stanford, finishing 5-of-7
from the floor with 11 points and
seven rebounds. Lichti was again high
scorer for Stanford with 17 points after
bouncing back from a slow start.
Howard Wright led the team with 10
rebounds but was only 5-of-15 from
the floor for 11 points. Novian Whitsitt
also scored 11 points for the Cardinal,
including three three-pointers.
With 43 seconds left and Stanford
down 70-59, Whitsitt launched a three
pointer from the left side that fell in.
Seconds later, Lichti followed with
three of his own, cutting the score to
72-65. McMillan sank two of his eight

free throws as Taylor fouled out, and
then Whisitt hit again, this time from
the left boundary, to bring Stanford
within six, 74-68, with 20 seconds
remaining.
The Cardinal used its last timeout,
and with 14 seconds left, Wright
canned a 10-foot jumper from the right
of the lane. Whitsitt immediately called
timeout for Stanford — but with none
left, Stanford was assessed with a two
shot technical. McMillan made both,
and the game was over.
"I don't know how many times I told
them we'd used five (timeouts),"
Montgomery said. "Novian just spaced.
He didn't realize it. But when Howard
took the two-pointer instead of the
three-point shot, that effectively ended
it for us. We were down by six, and we
needed three to cut it in half."
"I know coach told the group we
didn't have anymore," Taylor said.
"Novian was so into the game, it was
instinct, reaction, to call timeout after
the hoop. You can't blame it on him."
But you can blame it on Elliott. "He's
one of those guys who can get the ball
and create something," Reveno said.
"He's tough. He's 6-8 and can shoot
three-pointers with the rest of them.
The comparisons with Johnson? Both
can create things. You give them the
ball and tell them to do something and

they'll score points. Todd Lichti's al
most in that mold; he can create the
shot or the open player."
Lichti is just a sophomore. So is El
liott. In fact, the entire Arizona team
will return next season. Only McMillan
and center Tom Tolbert (who scored
18 points for the Wildcats) are juniors,
and all-conference guard Steve Kerr
will also return after redshirting this
season. The Wildcats are now 10-5
overall, 5-2 in the Pac-10, and tied for
second with Cal. Stanford dropped to
sixth in the conference.
