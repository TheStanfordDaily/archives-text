# Johnson leads Cal with 31
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — With their top scorer
and rebounder, Leonard Taylor, out
for the season with a spinal defect, the
California Golden Bears were ex
pected to turn to seniors Kevin
Johnson and Dave Butler for produc
tion and leadership.
They did, and it proved to be a wise
move, as Johnson and Butler led the
Bears to a 87-72 win over Stanford on
Saturday before a sellout crowd of
6,450 at Harmon Gym.
"I don't think anything had to be
said," Johnson said. "We were the No.
1 and No. 2 scorers on the team last
year, so we knew we had to take up the
slack."
Johnson scored a game-high 31
points, while Butler scored 16. The two,
seniors have lost only one of seven
games to the Cardinal during their
careers. Overall, Cal has beaten Stan-<
ford 10 times in the last 11 meetings.
Butler, who has been mired in a
season-long shooting slump, came out
of it to lead a balanced Cal attack in the
second half with 10 points. "We all
knew we had to put in more effort," he
said. "Sometimes when Leonard's in
there, you wait for him to score and
you become a spectator."
The Bears could afford to be specta
tors in the first half because Johnson
just flat out went crazy. The 6-foot-1
point guard put on a dazzling display
of individual offensive talent, scoring
26 points on an array of driving layups
and jump shots off the dribble.
Johnson did not miss a shot until the
final minute of the half. By then he had
hit 10 straight from the field and five
from the line. Stanford tried four dif
ferent men on Johnson — Novian
Whitsitt, Terry Taylor, Scott Meinert
and Todd Lichti — but to no avail.
"We had the two-guard on him
tough," Taylor said. "He was supposed
to get help to make him (Johnson) give
it up, but we didn't do a good enough
job helping out."
"At the World Championships this
summer, I played with Tommy Amaker
(Duke) and Kenny Smith (North

Carolina), who are supposed to be the
best point guards in the nation," Buder
said. 'But I would take Kevin over any
of them."
Despite the hot shooting of Johnson
and the constant roar of the hostile
Harmon crowd, Stanford was able to
hang tough, something it could not do
last year in an 81-53 loss.
"Last year I thought it (the crowd)
really affected us," Taylor said. "This
year we just went out and played bas
ketball."
The Cardinal trailed by as many as
11, but battled to within 45-40 at the
half behind the torrid outside shooting
of Lichti (4 for 7, 12 points), Taylor (3
for 4, nine points) and Whitsitt (4 for 4,
eight points). For the half, Stanford
shot 64 percent from the floor.
Entering the second half, the
outcome seemed to depend on
whether Stanford or Johnson would
cool off. As it turned out, both did, but
the Bears had many other people
ready to contribute, while the Cardinal
had only a one-man gang.
Although Johnson did not have a
field goal in the second half, Cal was
able to increase its lead to 11 early and
never let Stanford get closer than
seven. Six Bears scored four or more
points in the final stanza.

"It concerned me that we got that
great half from Kevin and were only up
by five," Cal Coach Lou Campanelli
said. "Our balance really came through
in the second half."
A lean-in jumper by Bryan
McSweeney got the Cardinal to within
seven at 55-48 with 13 minutes to go,
but during the next seven minutes, the
Stanford offense consisted of one man
— Lichti — who scored 13 of the next
15 Cardinal points.
"I started looking for my shot a little
more," said Lichti, who finished with
29 points and a game-high 10
rebounds. "We needed somebody to
start looking to make something hap
pen."
Lichti was forced to make something
happen because there was nothing
happening inside. Stanford was unable
to get the ball in to its big men, and it
showed, as Howard Wright, Greg But
ler and Eric Reveno combined for just
15 points and seven rebounds.
"I don't think we did a very good job
of being patient, taking the time to get
the ball inside," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "Their pressure
caused us to get out of synch."
Besides Lichti, the Cardinal's only
double-figure scorers were Taylor and
Whitsitt with 11 points each.
