# Card women romp against Cal
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
doesn't like to lay too much signifi
cance on the outcome of any single
basketball game.
But after her young Cardinal
dropped a very strong California team
77-59 Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion, a beaming VanDerveer
couldn't conceal the fact that the vic
tory was a crucial one for Stanford.
, "Everyone did their part," she said.
"Our players worked hard and made a
concerted effort to work with the team.
This was such a turnaround from the
last game (a 94-82 loss to BYIJ) — it's
frightening."
More than just a notch in the win
column, the game was big for other
reasons:
• It broke an unbearably long eight
game drought against Cal. Stanford's
last win against the Bears came during
the 1980-81 season.
• The 19-point drubbing raised Stan
ford's Pacific 10 Conference record to
3-2. The precious league win allowed
the Cardinal to keep pace with the Pac
-10 leaders.
• Stanford proved that it could handle
a tight, man-on-man defense, some
thing that has given the Cardinal a
good deal of trouble this year.
• And Stanford's defense shut down
Cal's big woman, Jennifer Bennet,
during the crucial second stanza.
In the first half, the Cardinal squad
looked like it had finally gelled. Cal's
pressure defense could not rattle Stan
ford's guards as they made accurate
passes to forward Katy Steding, who
fought hard to get free at die inside
posts.
Steding's 17 points in the opening
stanza helped the Cardinal remain in
front for the entire first half, but Ben
net, Cal's workhorse, did some bruis
ing inside work of her own, scoring 18
points to keep the Bears close at inter
mission, 44-39.
In the second half, Stanford's inside

play continued to shine at both ends of
the court.
The first few minutes of the final
stanza belonged to Stanford center Jill
Yanke, who scored eight quick points
for the Cardinal. Yanke's inspired play
helped Stanford build a nine-point
lead at 56-47.
At the other end of the court,
Steding, now in a defensive role, was
assigned the unenviable task of stop
ping the 6-foot-3 Bennet, something
that very few defenders ever ac
complish.
But Steding did, and with the help (if
a sagging Cardinal defense, held the
Bears' prolific scorer to a mere four
points.
"I think the key to die game was
Katy's defense on Bennet in the second
half," VanDerveer said. "We depend so
much on Katy. She's our most consis
tent ballplayer."
On top of her defensive heroics,
Steding scored a career-high 23 points
to lead both teams. Forward Kami An
derson and guard Jennifer Azzi added
14 and 13 points, respectively, to help
pace the Cardinal.
Senior Erica Mueser also contrib
uted a great deal to her long-awaited
victory over Cal. The 5-6 guard buried
clutch free throws toward the end of
the game to keep Stanford at a com
fortable distance. She finished with 11
points and nine rebounds for the Card
inal.
In addition to Bennet's ineffective
second half, the Bears also received a
lackluster performance from forward
Seija Leino, who scored just two points
for Cal. Leino, one of three Finnish
players who start for the Bears, was
way below her 17-point season
average.
"The one thing we wanted to do this
game was sprint back (on defense),"
VanDerveer said. "Berkeley wasn't able
to run like they wanted to. They
weren't getting into their flow at all
"I don't look forward to playing
them in Berkeley because they are
going to want to destroy us."
