DAVIS — If Saturday's season-opening meet is a
harbinger of future success, not many Stanford women's
gymnastics records will survive this season.
'Hie Cardinal garnered an impressive win over UC-
Davis and Alberta on Saturday with a Stanford first-meet
record score of 170.6.
Matching the team victory was individual achievement,
highlighted by the first- and second-place all-around
finishes of freshmen Dina Amoroso and Susan Banta. In
addition, each of the remaining Cardinal gymnasts
placed in the top six in at least one event.
Despite a slow start on the uneven parallel bars, the
squad rallied back to win the remaining events and the
meet. Though the audience may have been somewhat
surprised, Stanford Coach Homer Sardina was not in the
least. "You thought it was going to be bad after bars, but
not me," he said. "I had expectations.
"I'm really proud of these girls," Sar
dina added. "They started out bad and
came back strong."
"We did a great job for the first meet
— a team best," sophomore Jessica
Armstrong said.
Freshmen, in fact, comprised a good
portion of the competing team.
Amoroso and Banta were joined by
classmates Becky Ashton and Karen
Gryler for their collegiate debut.

Banta provided another pleasant
surprise with her second-place finish.
Though she did not win any event, her
consistent performances on bars,
beam and floor earned her the silver.
Amoroso's performance was clearly
the most impressive of the evening. As
the competition continued, her talent
became increasingly apparent and Sar
dina's enthusiasm grew.
After Amoroso won the vault event
with a score of 9.45, Sardina said, "I
told you she was going to take vault.
Now I'm going to call floor and beam."
His prediction came true when
Amoroso scored a 935 on the floor
and took the beam title with an 8.95.
