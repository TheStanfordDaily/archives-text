# Wrestlers win meet at Davis

The scenario is as follows: You are in a large gymnasium
filled by a boisterous crowd at UC-Davis. You are in the cen
ter of the gym, at the center of attention, and are about to
become part of a slippery, painful human sandwich.
You have two options. You can either use all of the
strength, agility and experience you have within you to out
wrestle your opponent, or you can let yourself become the
middle of the sandwich.
Eleven Stanford wrestlers chose the former this weekend,
combining to defeat Oregon Tech 44-3 Friday in dual-meet
action and then returning Saturday to capture the champi
onship at the Aggie Invitational.
This was our best performance so far this year," Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel said of the Cardinal's victories at Davis
this weekend.
After trouncing the Owls of Oregon Tech Friday, the
Cardinal continued its success and
came away with first place at the Aggie
Invitational. In winning the tourna
ment, Stanford defeated seven other
teams, including second-place Chico
State, third-place San Francisco State
and fourth-place Humboldt State.
Leading the way for the Cardinal
were individual champions Scott Wig
gen (142 pounds), Steve Yarbrough
(158) and heavyweight Kurt Kassulke.
All-American Wiggen was outstand
ing, according to Horpel. "Wiggen to
tally dominated his weight class by pin
ning all four opponents," Horpel said.
"No one lasted more than four minutes
with him."
Contributing with second-place
finishes for the Cardinal were fresh
man Ron Perry (177) and juniors Eric
Harber (167) and Terry Mclntyre
(190).
"It was truly a team performance,"
Horpel said. "To win it, everyone had
to do his best."
The Stanford wrestlers are back in
action tomorrow night at Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo.
