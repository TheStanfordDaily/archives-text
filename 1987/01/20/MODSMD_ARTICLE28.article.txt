### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Opening the season with a shutout,
the Stanford men's volleyball team
swept Westmont College, 15-6, 15-0,
15-11, on Saturday at Maples Pavilion.
The win gave the spikers a 1-0 record,
although the team lost to the Stanford
alumni team Friday night, 15-7, 11-15,
15-9.
Stanford's opening lineup, consist
ing of the team's veterans and one
freshman, established itself as the
dominant team in the Westmont match
within the first four minutes by jump
ing out to a 5-1 lead.
This starting team — setter Steve
Modory, the team's captain; honorable
mention Ail-American Scott Fortune,
who held a .750 percentage for two
games; senior Rob Peterson, who led
the team with three blocks; senior
Stephen Blue, who led the team with
10 kills; senior John McDermott, who
saved the spikers with his eight digs;
and newcomer Kent Steffes, a fresh
man from Pacific Palisades — gave
Stanford the first two games. In the

second game they denied the Warriors
any points.
Stanford's offensive play over
powered the Westmont team with 50
kills and a .337 percentage, contrasting
with the Warriors' 19 kills and .153
percentage. The Warriors committed
twice as many errors, 24 to Stanford's
12.
With the spikers up two games, Stan
ford Coach Fred Sturm was able to ex
periment and play a new lineup, con
sisting of the freshmen. "When you
have the opportunity to play everyone,
then you take it," said Sturm, who is a
former NCAA All-America and U.S. Na
tional Team member.
The new lineup allowed freshman
setter Parker Blackman and freshmen
hitters Craig Forsyth and Dan Hanan to
experience their first real match at the
college level. "It's really important to
give everyone a chance to play because
it's a big step up from high school to
college volleyball," said Peterson.
This is the first season in which
Westmont, from Santa Barbara, has
fielded a team.

The alumni tournament the night
before also allowed the recruits to ex
perience match play. "We were trying
to look at as many players in match sit
uation as possible. Different players
respond differently to the live competi
tion of a match," said Stanford Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves, who coached the
alumni Friday.
Both the varsity and the alumni were
divided into two teams, which allowed
for round-robin play. The 20-minute
games allowed the alumni to play the
varsity, as well as an inter-varsity and
an inter-alumni match. The alumni, led
by setter Craig Lauchner ('B5) and hit
ter Dan Parr ('B5), won two out of
three in the championship match.
Nieves, who graduated from Stan
ford in 1981, said that the alumni
match was an accurate indication of
where the team is. "We were not to
gether as a team, we're still putting the
pieces together," he said.
The players saw the games as
preparatory for league play. "We're
still experimenting with our lineup.
Hopefully by league play we'll have six
set players," said Fortune.
