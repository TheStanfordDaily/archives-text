"They didn't play like they were out of shape today. I was
pleased," Stanford Men's Soccer Coach Sam Koch said after
his team's 4-0 thrashing of an Argentine club team Saturday
at Maloney Field.
Koch's greatest fear last week was that his team would not
be in condition for the exhibition match with the Argentine
college students, who graduated from Mitre High School in
Buenos Aires.
The players made him gladly eat his words. And they did
it convincingly.
The onslaught began in the first half with a goal by sopho
more David Thorpe after a Chris Dechet feed.
"Dechet was dribbling the ball at the 18-yard stripe. He
just played a through ball, and the keeper and I got there at
the same time. I slid and the ball popped loose, and I was
able to get up and put in before he recovered," Thorpe said.
The interview with Thorpe was then interrupted.
"Make sure you mention that roommate combo,"
teammate Peter Graf, also an underclassman, quipped from
the background. Graf is Thorpe's roommate on campus and

scored the second Stanford goal on an assist from Thorpe.
Thorpe maneuvered his way down the wing into the cor
ner and shot a low, hard cross back toward the top of the
box. Graf picked up the ball after it caromed off a defender's
leg and popped it past the Argentine keeper.
The second half saw more of the same.
Dechet, a sophomore, made it 3-0 Stanford with a brilliant
goal off a pass from sophomore Kevin Woodhouse. Dechet
received the pass storming down the right side of the
penalty area and angled it to the far post. The bounding shot
just missed the outstretched arms of the diving Argentine
keeper.
Stanford's performance must have left the spectators
saying, "Gosh, look at all the youngsters on this team." The
Cardinal did Saturday's number without any of its seniors,
whose Stanford soccer careers ended with the final regular
season game. And the final goal showcased another of Stan
ford's youth movement â€” freshman Chris Porch.
Porch executed a beautiful cross to the far post where
junior Ross Torres, an elder statesman of sorts, headed it
down and into the net.
The Cardinal will play another exhibition Jan. 31 against
Universidad Catolica, also from Argentina.
