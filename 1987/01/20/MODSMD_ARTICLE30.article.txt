## Stanford's lab is 'one of the best' 
### OTTO LIN 
Stanford's Integrated Circuits Laboratory (IC),
which is now nearly fully operational, is
unquestionably one of the best of its kind in any
university, according to its director, Electrical En
gineering Prof. Jim Plummer.
There are two aspects to the work in the IC Lab
— production of chips and research. Plummer said
the aim of the lab is not to compete directly with
industrial corporations in the production of hard
ware, but to provide Stanford-affiliated scientists
with a convenient source of chips for their re
search work.
Plummer said research will place an emphasis
on developing advanced technology that commer
cial companies might find useful "five or 10 years
down the road."
According to Plummer, "the U.S. is at a disadvan
tage in manufacturing chips, cars, everything."
More research in these fields might enable the
United States to compete more effectively with
other industrial powers like Japan.
The IC Lab was recently moved to the Center for

Integrated Systems (CIS) Building and is now used
by students for research.
The IC Lab was originally housed in McCullough
Building, adjoining the Physics Lecture Hall, but
Stanford provided $1.5 million so the entire IC Lab
could be moved to its new site. The $10 million
worth of equipment currently housed in the CIS
Building was donated by industry.
Plummer said an industrial company donates its
equipment to the University because it wants visit
ing scientists to see its equipment in use at Stan
ford, as well as to acquaint students and faculty
with its products to boost sales.
Stanford researchers can use the lab — which
offers unique capabilities not available through
standard industrial facilities — to make the silicon
chips necessary to their work.
What distinguishes the lab from others is the fact
that it is virtually vibration-free and that it is 10
times cleaner than any other research facility,
Plummer said.
Chip circuits are made by superimposing layers
of electrical and insulating materials on a silicon
wafer. Vibration can throw these layers out of

alignment, and therefore the less vibration there is,
the smaller and more delicate the electrical
devices that can he made. The 1C Lab is nearly 100
percent vibration-free because it is physically iso
lated from the rest of the building, said Chief En
gineer Jacques Beaudouin.
The vibrations coming from the attic and the
basement, where most of the machinery is housed,
are absorbed by a rubber layer between the con
crete foundations of the lab and the rest of the
building.
Cleanliness also affects the quality of the chips
produced because, if tiny contaminant particles are
incorporated during fabrication, they can cause de
fective circuits on the chip. Features that contribute
to the extreme cleanliness of the lab include an
ultra-pure processed-gas distribution system, a
very high purity deionized water distribution sys
tem and a 100 percent micro-polished stainless
steel gas transport system.
The waste-disposal system is one of the most ad
vanced in existence. Toxic gases, such as arsine
and phosphine, are passed through scrubbers and
burn boxes before they are released into the air.
