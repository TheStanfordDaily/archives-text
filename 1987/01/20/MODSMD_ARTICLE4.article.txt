# Atom smasher spurs on debate
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
While President Reagan considers
endorsing the construction of a huge
atom smasher, Stanford professors
have expressed both enthusiasm and
caution concerning the the $6 billion
project.
According to The New York Times,
Reagan will decide this month whether
the United States should build a new
subatomic particle accelerator, called a
Superconducting Super Collider. The
atom smasher would measure approxi
mately 50 miles in circumference and
accelerate atomic particles at any en
ergy level 20 times above current abili
ties.
Despite concerns that the funding
will draw resources away from other
research areas or further inflate the
budget deficit, Burton Richter, director
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, is enthusiastic. Richter said he
believes the proposed atom smasher is
necessary for the advancement of parti
cle physics into the 19905.
"Scientifically, it's the right kind of tool
to have a decade from now."
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin said

he believes caution is necessary any
time government expansion of this
type is involved. "It (.the funding)
should not just meet purely the wish
lists of the scientific community, but
take into account the potential com
mercial effect," said Boskin. "It should
not just become a wasteful boondoggle
of the government."
A large proton collider, like the one
Reagan is considering, is the "next im
portant step" needed to advance parti
cle physics, according to Sidney Drell,
deputy director of SLAC. The suggested
accelerator is the result of four years of
study by the High Energy Physics Advi
sory Panel for the Department of En
ergy, Drell said.
The accelerator would launch
beams of high-energy protons around
an underground track in opposite di
rections, guided by 10,000 powerful
magnets. Any debris from the protons'
collision could give scientists new
clues about the construction and be
havior of matter on both an atomic and
galactic scale.
Reagan may express his support for
the project in his State of the Union ad
dress on Jan. 27, The Times reported
vesterdav. Already the Domestic Policy

Committee, a Cabinet-level advisory
group, has discussed the atom smasher
and listed arguments for and against
the issue for the president during the
past few weeks.
In a confidential memorandum
drafted for the president, the Domestic
Policy Committee said the accelerator
may result in major advances in under
standing the origins of the universe, ac
cording to The Times. Drell con
curred, saying that the research is
answering "profound questions about
the origins of the universe 15 to 20 bil
lion years ago."
