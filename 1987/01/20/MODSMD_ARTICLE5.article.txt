# Cogan to stay at Hoover
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Despite the Reagan administration's
eagerness to welcome John Cogan, act
ing director of the Hoover Institution,
to its ranks as the domestic policy di
rector, Cogan has declined the offer to
keep commitments — both personal
and professional — at Hoover.
Cogan opted to fulfill his commit
ment to lead Hoover in place of institu
tion director W. Glenn Campbell who
is on a six-month sabbatical that began
this month, according to a staff mem
ber at Hoover who accompanied
Cogan to Washington, D.C., speaking
on the condition of anonymity.
Cogan also declined the offer, which
was made by White House Chief of

Staff Donald Regan, because he wishes
to continue his work enhancing the re
search environment at Hoover as well
as the overall working relationship be
tween Hoover and Stanford, the source
said.
Cogan spoke with Regan last week
while in Washington for the biannual
meeting of Hoover's Board of Over
seers. Cogan, who was an Office of
Management and Budget deputy under
David Stockman, was unavailable for
comment.
The domestic policy director's posi
tion has been vacant since Jack Svahn
resigned last September. Martin Ander
son, a senior fellow at Hoover, filled
the position for the first two years of
the Reagan administration. Anderson
was also unavailable for comment.

Acting as an independent go
between for government agencies and
the president, the domestic policy ad
viser and his staff brief the president
on domestic policy issues and possible
courses of action before he makes a
decision — just as the national security
adviser guides foreign policy as head
of the National Security Council .
With Cogan's refusal of the job as
domestic policy director, his efforts
will remain focused on work at
Hoover, where he is "aggressively
recruiting new talent for the institu
tion," said Bruce Bueno De Mesquita, a
senior fellow at Hoover, who formerly
headed the political science depart
ment at the University of Rochester.
Bueno De Mesquita said he shares
Cogan's vision to make Hoover "the
highest quality public policy institute
in the country," adding that increased
prominence of the center "can only
facilitate Hoover and Stanford's suc
cess at recruitment in the social
sciences."

"Hoover has a lot going for it— It
has a lot of talented people, a large en
dowment. It is embedded in a fine uni
versity, and the geographic location is
optimal," Bueno De Mesquita added.
Bueno De Mesquita also said that he
encourages increased communication
between Hoover and the University
and that he believes Cogan has a
similar approach to the relationship,
which has been strained in the past.
