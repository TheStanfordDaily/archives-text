# False alarms plague Lagunita
## Smoke detector malfunction awakens residents 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Lagunita Court residents have become increasingly angry
about the early morning false alarms that have awakened
them since the installation of a new smoke detection system
last quarter, and few students are still heeding the alarms,
Resident Fellow Rosalyn Britt said yesterday.
Meanwhile, University officials and the installer of the sys
tems, Signal Elecric, remain puzzled about the cause of the
excessive number of alarms, said Ben Asaro, Stanford
facilities project manager.
Two alarms early Sunday morning in Lagunita, one at 4
a.m. and the other at 7 a.m., brought to 18 the total number
of alarms since the system was made operational on Dec. 12,
<Â¥)86;Britt said.
"Some have been set off for legitimate reasons, like those
early on in Grenada," Britt said, noting diat a faulty pressure
valve in a boiler there caused a buildup of steam and trig

gered alarms. That valve has since been repaired.
"But most (of the alarms) have been unnecessary," she
said.
In a Friday meeting with students, University officials and
representatives of Signal Electric, the electric company an
nounced it would try to lower the sensitivity of the alarm to
see if that solves the problem.
Sensitivity is factory-set at a level within the legally re
quired range of 2.5 to 5 volts, and Asaro said perhaps the
Lagunita system was set closer to the 5 volt, more sensitive
level. He also speculated that the round ceilings in Lagunita
cause cigarette or other smoke to concentrate rather than
dissipate, setting off the alarms.
"It really has us bewildered," he added, saying "we're
throwing everyone we can at this problem, but it's still
frustrating us."
The same system has posed no problems in Stern Hall,
