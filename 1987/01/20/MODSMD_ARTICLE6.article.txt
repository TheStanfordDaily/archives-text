# False alarms plague Lagunita
## Smoke detector malfunction awakens residents 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Lagunita Court residents have become increasingly angry
about the early morning false alarms that have awakened
them since the installation of a new smoke detection system
last quarter, and few students are still heeding the alarms,
Resident Fellow Rosalyn Britt said yesterday.
Meanwhile, University officials and the installer of the sys
tems, Signal Elecric, remain puzzled about the cause of the
excessive number of alarms, said Ben Asaro, Stanford
facilities project manager.
Two alarms early Sunday morning in Lagunita, one at 4
a.m. and the other at 7 a.m., brought to 18 the total number
of alarms since the system was made operational on Dec. 12,
<Â¥)86;Britt said.
"Some have been set off for legitimate reasons, like those
early on in Grenada," Britt said, noting diat a faulty pressure
valve in a boiler there caused a buildup of steam and trig

gered alarms. That valve has since been repaired.
"But most (of the alarms) have been unnecessary," she
said.
In a Friday meeting with students, University officials and
representatives of Signal Electric, the electric company an
nounced it would try to lower the sensitivity of the alarm to
see if that solves the problem.
Sensitivity is factory-set at a level within the legally re
quired range of 2.5 to 5 volts, and Asaro said perhaps the
Lagunita system was set closer to the 5 volt, more sensitive
level. He also speculated that the round ceilings in Lagunita
cause cigarette or other smoke to concentrate rather than
dissipate, setting off the alarms.
"It really has us bewildered," he added, saying "we're
throwing everyone we can at this problem, but it's still
frustrating us."
The same system has posed no problems in Stern Hall,
which went on line in September, or
the Escondido Village high-rises,
where it was installed over a year ago,
Asaro added.
Wilbur Hall will begin relying on the
system within the week, and will be
followed by Florence Moore Hall in a
$2 million, campus-wide effort to in
stall smoke detectors in University
housing to meet county requirements.
Britt said the system, which Asaro
called state-of-the-art, began to register
false alarms the day it became opera
tional.
"We had alarms at 3 a.m. and 3:30
a.m. that morning, even though the

company had tested the system
alongside the old system for eight days
and said it was OK," she said.
Several alarms during Dead Week
and finals week kept students up at a
time when they were getting little
sleep, and many students are still
angry, according to one resident.
Because of the number of alarms
students have begun to ingore them.
"Maybe 50 of 360 students left the
dorm during the last one," Britt said.
"The system has no credibility."
"Several people are refusing to
evacuate," said Ujamaa resident Tom
Aver, a senior. Aver added that firemen
seemed less worried about alarms in
Lagunita. He said they are taking more
and more time in responding.
