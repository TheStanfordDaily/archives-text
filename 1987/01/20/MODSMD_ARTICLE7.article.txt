# U.S. arms control position insincere?

### FELICIA PAIK Editorial staff 
Two Stanford experts on arms con
trol negotiations disagree on the sin
cerity of the United States and the So
viet Union at recent arms control talks
in Geneva.
"The arms control talks show con
tinuing leadership (of both countries)
and serious commitment to the arms
control process," said Sidney Drell, co
director of the Center for International
Security and Arms Control.
But Ted Postol, a senior research as
sociate at the center, questioned U.S.
commitment to the negotiations.
"These talks are largely a window
show to create the appearance that the
Reagan administration is seriously
committed. I'm not convinced that
Ronald Reagan is at all interested in a
chieving any agreement," he said.
Soviet officials have said the Soviet
negotiators planned to talk seriously
about what research is allowed under
the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty,
according to a Jan. 15 article in The
New York Times. The Soviets still
oppose the Reagan administration's
position that extensive testing of space
based systems is permitted.

The 1972 ABM Treaty, which both
the Soviet Union and the United States
signed, stipulates that neither country
will deploy defensive systems and
limits research to the laboratories.
"The Star Wars (Strategic Defense
Initiative) issue is the crucial issue to
be resolved. It has to be decided
whether the research is in complete
accord with the ABM Treaty," said
Drell, who is also deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
"But, President Reagan shows every
indication that he is not willing to com
promise on the issue of SDI," Drell
said. "Vigorous research is still needed
so we can discover what the prospects
are for SDI. We still do not have all the
answers.
"Until now the ABM Treaty was in
terpreted in the strictest, traditional
sense, and I see no reason for us to go
beyond the interpretation of the
treaty," he said. "But the more central
issue is whether we (the United States)
are willing to adhere to the treaty for
the next 10 years, providing that the
Russians are willing to.
"We hear the public statements (that
they are willing to abide by the treaty),
but we have to hear what is being said
at the negotiating table," he said.
"1 have personal confidence in
Vorontstov (the new chief Soviet
negotiator) and in Max Kampelman
(the American negotiator).... The
talks signal motion and flexibility for
both sides," he said.
Postol, on the other hand, said the
Reagan administration s stance on
arms control "chaotic."
"The President does not seem to be
on top of much, let alone the arms
negotations, and there seems to be
current disarray in the administration,"
Postol said.
"The ABM Treaty and (the first Stra
tegic Arms Limitations Treaty) were
achieved because Richard Nixon said
there was going to be a treaty, and the
internal problems of the treaty were
going to be resolved one way or the
other. That's why we got the treaties,"
he said.
Postol believes "SDI is politically
jeopardizing because it affects the
entire structure of arms control negoti
ations; in that sense it is extremely
serious.
