# Students celebrate King's birthday with education
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
The Stanford community had the opportu
nity to learn more about the civil rights move
ment of the 1960s and to take a critical look at
activism in the 1980s while attending student
organized programming in last week's com
memoration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday.
The tribute to King featured a variety of pre
sentations, ranging from a speech by the Rev
Jesse Jackson to daily films open to the public.
While Jackson packed Memorial Auditorium
for his Thursday speech, the audio-visual pro
gram "Dimensions of a Life" also brought civil
rights issues to life, according to Louie Ford,
student member of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Commemorative Committee.
"It showed people what happened during
the movement, plus the voice-over of Dr. King
in interviews and speeches made it more per
sonal," Ford said.
"The display created an atmosphere where

you could go there, sit down, listen and think,"
Ford said.
A service in Memorial Church honoring King
on Thursday was also a highlight, according to
Ford.
"(Acting Dean of the Chapel) Tom Ambrogi
made some good points — some different from
Jesse Jackson but some the same, in that you
have to do something — that King was an ac
tivist person, and we have to be activists today,"
Ford said.
Campus residences showed recorded televi
sion programs such as "Bill Cosby on Preju
dice" and The March on Washington Remem
bered," which were open to the public.
The programming continues tonight with a
presentation entitled "Martin Luther King Jr.:
The Man and the Meaning of His Life to Con
temporary Americans," to be held at 7:30 in
Kresge Auditorium. Two professors from New
York are scheduled to speak: David Garrow of
City College and Jim Jordan of State University
New York-Stony Brook.
Yesterday's holiday marks the second federal

commemoration of King's birthday. In 1983
Congress established the third Monday in Janu
ary as Martin Luther King Day, to be celebrated
beginning in 1986.
King received a Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for
his work in civil rights. His call for peaceful
equality between all races became well known
to millions long before that year.
King burst onto the national scene in 1955,
when he led a city-wide boycott of the local
busing company in Montgomery, Ala. The
newly ordained minister was a voice for
protesters who decried segregated seating.
During the boycott, King's fundamental prin
ciples of nonviolent protest became famous.
"We will not resort to violence. We will not
degrade ourselves with hatred. Love will be
returned for hate," King often said, echoing his
studies of the teachings of Indian leader
Mahatma Gandhi.
After a year of demonstrations, the protesters
won a victory when the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that segregated seating on buses was un
lawful.

King then broadened his movement by form
ing die Southern Christian Leadership Confer
ence. He lectured throughout the country and
met with foreign leaders to discuss racial ine
qualities in the United States.
The year 1963 brought the most massive
protest demonstration ever in the United States.
On Aug. 28, over 250,000 Americans joined
King to march on Washington to support civil
rights legislation.
It was there that King gave his famous "I have
a dream" speech.
Soon afterward, Congress approved the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of
1965.
King later moved to Chicago, where he con
tinued to lead marches and to advocate civil
rights He drew criticism both from whites and
from ' Black Power" leaders in favor of
militaristic tactics to acquire rights.
Persistent in his message for peace, King an
nounced his open opposition to the Vietnam
War in 1967.
King began planning a multiracial Poor

People's Campaign" in 1968 to demand in
creased aid for the impoverished and an end to
discrimination.
In the midst of planning the campaign, King
flew to Memphis, Tenn., to support a sanitation
workers' strike There he was shot to death on
April 4, 1968.
James Earl Ray pleaded guilty to the murder
on March 10, 1969, and was sentenced to 99
years in prison.
King's influence manifests itself today, said
Black Student Union Chair Amanda Kemp, who
said the combined effort of student ethnic or
ganizations on the Jackson program has unified
the groups.
Kemp said this unity will help these organiza
tions pursue their goal of broadening the West
ern Culture Program to include the contribu
tions of women and non-Europeans. The recent
approval of the spring Western Culture class
focusing on women and minorities in the
United States is only one step toward funda
mental change, she said.

Soon afterward, Congress approved the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of
1965.
King later moved to Chicago, where he con
tinued to lead marches and to advocate civil
rights He drew criticism both from whites and
from ' Black Power" leaders in favor of
militaristic tactics to acquire rights.
Persistent in his message for peace, King an
nounced his open opposition to the Vietnam
War in 1967.
King began planning a multiracial Poor

People's Campaign" in 1968 to demand in
creased aid for the impoverished and an end to
discrimination.
In the midst of planning the campaign, King
flew to Memphis, Tenn., to support a sanitation
workers' strike There he was shot to death on
April 4, 1968.
James Earl Ray pleaded guilty to the murder
on March 10, 1969, and was sentenced to 99
years in prison.
King's influence manifests itself today, said
Black Student Union Chair Amanda Kemp, who
said the combined effort of student ethnic or
ganizations on the Jackson program has unified
the groups.
Kemp said this unity will help these organiza
tions pursue their goal of broadening the West
ern Culture Program to include the contribu
tions of women and non-Europeans. The recent
approval of the spring Western Culture class
focusing on women and minorities in the
United States is only one step toward funda
mental change, she said.
The Stanford community had the opportu
nity to learn more about the civil rights move
ment of the 1960s and to take a critical look at
activism in the 1980s while attending student
organized programming in last week's com
memoration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday.
The tribute to King featured a variety of pre
sentations, ranging from a speech by the Rev
Jesse Jackson to daily films open to the public.
While Jackson packed Memorial Auditorium
for his Thursday speech, the audio-visual pro
gram "Dimensions of a Life" also brought civil
rights issues to life, according to Louie Ford,
student member of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Commemorative Committee.
"It showed people what happened during
the movement, plus the voice-over of Dr. King
in interviews and speeches made it more per
sonal," Ford said.
"The display created an atmosphere where

you could go there, sit down, listen and think,"
Ford said.
A service in Memorial Church honoring King
on Thursday was also a highlight, according to
Ford.
"(Acting Dean of the Chapel) Tom Ambrogi
made some good points — some different from
Jesse Jackson but some the same, in that you
have to do something — that King was an ac
tivist person, and we have to be activists today,"
Ford said.
Campus residences showed recorded televi
sion programs such as "Bill Cosby on Preju
dice" and The March on Washington Remem
bered," which were open to the public.
The programming continues tonight with a
presentation entitled "Martin Luther King Jr.:
The Man and the Meaning of His Life to Con
temporary Americans," to be held at 7:30 in
Kresge Auditorium. Two professors from New
York are scheduled to speak: David Garrow of
City College and Jim Jordan of State University
New York-Stony Brook.
Yesterday's holiday marks the second federal

commemoration of King's birthday. In 1983
Congress established the third Monday in Janu
ary as Martin Luther King Day, to be celebrated
beginning in 1986.
King received a Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for
his work in civil rights. His call for peaceful
equality between all races became well known
to millions long before that year.
King burst onto the national scene in 1955,
when he led a city-wide boycott of the local
busing company in Montgomery, Ala. The
newly ordained minister was a voice for
protesters who decried segregated seating.
During the boycott, King's fundamental prin
ciples of nonviolent protest became famous.
"We will not resort to violence. We will not
degrade ourselves with hatred. Love will be
returned for hate," King often said, echoing his
studies of the teachings of Indian leader
Mahatma Gandhi.
After a year of demonstrations, the protesters
won a victory when the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that segregated seating on buses was un
lawful.

King then broadened his movement by form
ing die Southern Christian Leadership Confer
ence. He lectured throughout the country and
met with foreign leaders to discuss racial ine
qualities in the United States.
The year 1963 brought the most massive
protest demonstration ever in the United States.
On Aug. 28, over 250,000 Americans joined
King to march on Washington to support civil
rights legislation.
It was there that King gave his famous "I have
a dream" speech.
