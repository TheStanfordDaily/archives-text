Politicians against hostage swap
BONN, West Germany — Prominent politicians cautioned officials yes
terday against swapping a Lebanese suspect in the 1985 TWA hijacking for a
West German abducted in Beirut. They said a trade would inspire more ter
rorist attacks.
Government spokesmen in Bonn played down reports that the kidnap
ping in Beirut of businessman Rudolf Cordes was aimed at forcing the
release of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, accused of being one of the terrorists
who seized the jetliner in June 1985.
A U.S. Navy diver on the plane was shot to death at Beirut airport after
the jet was commandeered during a flight from Rome to Athens.
Hans Stercken, chairman of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, said
in a radio interview: "Those who are aware of the tendency toward terror
ist acts in the Middle East know that the acceptance of blackmail increases
the chances of new acts."
The Justice Ministry said Hamadi's extradition to the United States would
be accomplished quickly. It had been delayed pending a pledge from the
Americans not to apply the death penalty if Hamadi is convicted. West Ger
many does not have a death penalty.
Hamadi, 22, was arrested last Tuesday at the Frankfurt airport after arriv
ing from Beirut. U.S. officials have asked that he be extradited to stand trial
in an American court.
Gunmen seized Cordes, 53-year-old Beirut manager of West Germany's
Hoechst chemical company, after he arrived in the Lebanese capital Satur
day from Frankfurt.
Iran launches new Basra attacks
BAGHDAD, Iraq — The Iraqi military reported yesterday that thousands
of Iranian troops launched a new wave of attacks near the beleaguered port
city of Basra overnight but were driven back in heavy fighting.
Intelligence estimates of the latest fighting on the southern front of the
Persian Gulf War varied widely, with some Washington officials minimizing
Iran's recent gains and some military analysts here in the Iraqi capital sug
gesting that the latest Iranian assault represents a serious threat to Iraq.
Iran reported that its invasion force had broken through Iraqi defenses
and was driving toward Basra, Iraq's second-largest city. The official Iranian
news agency added that the capture of four more islands in the Shatt al
Arab waterway was "imminent."
Iraq, however, asserted that its troops had the Iranians bottled up in
marshland east of Basra. It also reported "destructive raids" by its air force
on six cities in Iran, the 11th day Iraqi warplanes had bombed enemy cities.
An Iraqi war communique said that "an estimated eight divisions" of
paramilitary Revolutionary Guards launched human-wave attacks on Iraqi
lines southeast of Basra in an attempt to expand the bridgehead they have
established east and south of the city.
French vie for hostage release
PARIS — French authorities conferred with a high-ranking Iranian envoy
here yesterday in an effort to improve chances for release of French
hostages in Lebanon through better relations with Tehran.
The negotiations with Iran fit into a pattern of contacts with Middle East
authorities that French officials hope can exercise influence over Lebanon
based groups accused of kidnaping French citizens and setting off terrorist
bombs in Paris. Contacts with Syrian intelligence officials fit into the same
pattern, a French official said.
The French efforts, underway publicly since early last year, differed
markedly with the Reagan administration's previous public policy dis
couraging negotiations with Iran over hostages and seeking to isolate the
Islamic government in Tehran as a U.S.-designated sponsor of terrorism.
Since the recent revelations of U.S. arms sales to Iran, however, U.S. offi
cials have been telling their French counterparts that the two countries ac
tually have a similar approach, knowledgeable sources reported.
Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond met with Ali Ahani of the Iranian
Foreign Ministry to receive a response to a recent French message to
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, French officials announced. Prime Min
ister Jacques Chirac may also meet with Ahani during the Iranian's three
day stay here, they said.
Chinese party split is deep
PEKING — China's Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang was forced to
resign because of a split with senior leader Deng Xiaoping that went much
deeper than has been previously disclosed, East European and odier
sources said yesterday.
No details of Hu's errors have been publicly announced, but an East
European source said acting party chief Zhao Zivang told a visiting Hun
garian Communist Party delegation Sunday that Hu, as party leader, had
been given "several warnings" that he was deviating from party policies.
According to this source, Zhao told the Hungarians that Hu "failed to fol
low the instructions" of a historic party central committee meeting in De
cember 1978, when Deng Xiaoping first laid out the principles of his cur
rent economic reforms.
Moreover, Hu not only failed to combat "bourgeois liberalization," the
current catchword for Western democratic ideas, he actually promoted it,
Zhao was quoted as saying. Hu was accused of going beyond party
guidelines in promoting "an acceleration" of political reform.
Although Zhao did not specifically say Hu opposed Deng on these issues,
this was the clear implication. The policies and guidelines that he des
cribed are closely identified with Deng.
Ministers launch peace intiative
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Eight Latin American foreign ministers and the
heads of the United Nations and the Organization of American States
launched a major Central American peace initiative yesterday amid U.S.
concerns that they are taking advantage of a scandal-weakened Reagan ad
ministration.
The 10 diplomats and their aides flew into leftist-ruled Nicaragua to an
elaborate welcome on the second leg of their tour after a stop in the Costa
Rican capital of San Jose. They spent Sunday in Panama formulating a joint
approach to the presidents of the five states they are visiting, which also in
clude Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The 10 negotiators include the foreign ministers of the Contadora
Group, which consists of Mexico, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela, and
their counterparts from a "support group" made up of Argentina, Brazil,
Peru and Uruguay. For the first time, they are being joined in their mission
by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and the secretary general
of the OAS, Brazilian Joao Baena Soares.
King holiday marked by racism
ATLANTA — Civil rights leaders celebrating the second annual holiday
honoring the birth of Martin Luther King Jr said yesterday that racism was
on the rise, and they vowed to return Saturday to all-white Forsyth County,
Ga., where a march lauding King was attacked by Ku Klux Klan members
last weekend.
As liberty bells rang and festivities were held across the country yester
day, Coretta Scott King joined in ceremonies here at the tomb of her assas
sinated husband Standing with Secretary of State George Shultz and black
leaders, she said that the attack in Forsyth was a reminder that the struggle
for freedom and justice is not over and Martin's dream is not fully
realized "
Shultz echoed that sentiment during an earlier service at the Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where King had served as co-pastor. "Howard Beach, For
syth County — just the names of places but already they are coming to
stand for everything Dr King fought against,' he said. "Freedom never
sleeps, and the struggle never ends."
