STANFORD READING
Kepler's Books in Menlo Park has long been the peninsula bookstore
where writers and readers come together. For years we have
sponsored a program of literary events where prominent authors
discuss ideas, read & sign their books, and meet the public. On
occasion we will also have an informed critic survey a single author's
work. Starting this year we will have poetry and fiction readings
featuring Stanford writers. In addition, at our monthly Poetry Night, we
will feature two local poets followed by an open reading. The public is
cordially invited to all events. Admission is always free.
All events at 8 p.m.
