Risk Factors
Researchers have identified a
number of characteristics or
habits (called risk factors)
which increase the chance
that an individual will develop
coronary heart disease. While
not all risk factors can be
controlled, such as age, sex,
race and heredity, many can
be controlled or corrected by
the individual. The risk fac
tors which can be controlled
or corrected are: dietary
habits (especially those
leading to high levels of blood
cholesterol and overweight or
obesity), high blood pressure
and cigarette smoking.
