■ As a Product Manager at M icrosoft, you have a head start over the rest. H
First you work closely with a brilliant software development team. Then you handle every H
aspect of a product from inception to distribution. And you have a tradition of winners: H
from MS-DOS, to QuickBASIC, to the powerful Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. You also H
have a name that is known by personal computer users throughout the world. H
But there's a challenge, too. You must bring important advances in software H

as usual. H

|H equally at home with software concepts and marketing plans. H

MBA as well as experience in software marketing or product management, we want to taik H
with you. We're looking for the best— leaders and visionaries—those who have H
demonstrated technical/marketing ability and a record of achievement.
■ Our location in the Pacific Northwest, near Seattle, is one of the most diverse in the
country—an area where quality of life is high and exciting. Mountains for skiing, hiking,
and climbing are close enough for day-tripping. Three spectacular national parks are H
within easy reach. The beautiful San Juan Islands are yours to explore by sailboat or ferry,
H car or bike. Fishing? Only if you like salmon and steelhead. H
■ Most importantly it's a place where you can be a leader with a leading company—
M ICROSOFT. We offer private offices, flexible hours, and a health club membership. And H
H we'll take care of you with generous benefits and relocation packages. H
