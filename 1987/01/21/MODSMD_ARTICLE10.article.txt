# Iran sustains offensive near Basra
## 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iran's drive against Iraq's
second-largest city has now become one of the
longest sustained military operations of this six-year
old war, and western intelligence officials are debat
ing whether Iran can keep it up.
Iran has committed 40,000 to 60,000 troops to its
campaign against Basra, in the south, but western
analysts say they are not certain whether it has shown
its full hand on the battlefield. Westerners here mon
itoring the war say it is still possible that Iran will
throw an unprecedented number of additional
troops, weapons and materiel into an all-out "final of
fensive."
There is a consensus, however, that the duration of
the fighting has heavily strained Iran's depleted eco
nomic and weaponry reserves. "But if this is the
beginning of the final offensive, they may go ahead
and use all they have," one western official said.

Iranian attack forces are suffering casualties per
haps three times greater than Iraqi defenders and are
drawing down all of their military stocks, according
to western estimates. Some analysts who have
counted the wounded arriving at Baghdad's train sta
tion have estimated 10,000 Iraqi casualties. Others
put the figure even higher.
"It's easy to be a defender, but there are terrible
problems faced by Iran," said another western
analyst. "The offensive is into its 11th day. The
Iranians have just embarked on the third phase of
their attack. All those soldiers have to be fed, they
have very long lines of communication and logistics
and the question is how much longer can they con
tinue. Probably not very long."
Several officials pointed out that Iran has seldom
pushed a military offensive beyond five days, which
was the approximate duration of last year's Iranian
drive onto the Faw Peninsula.

"The battlefield situation is very fluid," another
analyst said, adding that it is impossible to assess
Iran's intentions as it has slogged its way in heavy
fighting toward Basra and is now holding positions
east of the city at Fish Lake and southeast along the is
lands and northern bank of the Shatt al Arab water
way, Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf.
"A lot of people are debating whether this is a tacti
cal operation for political gain" in advance of next
week's gathering of Arab and other Moslem heads of
state at the Organization of the Islamic Conference
summit meeting in Kuwait, said one western official,
"or the beginning of the final offensive" Iran has
been threatening since last year.
"Everyone here is still hedging on whether this is
the final offensive," the official said.
