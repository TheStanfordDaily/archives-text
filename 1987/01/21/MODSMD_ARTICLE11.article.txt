## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Keep Zetes out 
### 
While the Zetes' fate remains open to debate, there is
really no question that this fraternity, which was thrown
off campus when some members pushed a young
woman into a concrete pond and which annually has its
pledges play nude volleyball, has no right to campus
housing.
One would have expected the brothers of Zeta Psi to
clean up their act as they worked to regain their
residence at 353 Campus Drive, but that has not been the
case.
Shortly after the Zetes lost their house six years ago,
two of their pledges were found tightly bound, face
down in the mud near the horse stables — wearing only
underwear. Four Zetes were arrested for that "prank."
Upon leaving their campus residence in December
1981, they staged a 20-foot-tall bonfire composed of their
bar and bar stools in the pond — went out with a bang, if
you will.
The fire motif has continued in the intervening period
as a Zete tore a fire alarm out of the wall at a Roth House
party.
As Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Residential Educa
tion, said even before the Zetes were suspended: "It is
unacceptable to allow any student group to steal, destroy

property and harass members of the community as Zeta
Psi members have done so chronically."
She also spoke of their "persistent theft, vandalism and
antisocial behavior."
Behavioral considerations aside, the campus housing
shortage is acute enough without reserving one
residence for a predominantly white and totally male,
heterosexual group of students.
Should the Zetes regain their house, most minorities
and homosexuals and all females could forget about ever
living in 353 Campus Drive. The same goes for those
living there when the Zetes return. Their returning resi
dent status would most likely be worthless.
Those who want to give the Zetes a "second chance"
might consider that the fraternity was warned eight times
between 1976 and 1981 that it was in danger of losing its
housing.
Zeta Psi, the University's oldest fraternity, also owns
what is probably one of Stanford's oldest records for an
tisocial actions. The Zetes were first put on probation in
1957, were suspended for one year in 1959 and were
suspended from campus for three more years in 1964.
Indeed, the Zetes have had more chances than they
deserve, and they merit no consideration from the Uni
versity in their bid to regain their house.
