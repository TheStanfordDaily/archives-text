Nostalgic message
is not so healthy
As an Englishman, I read with nos
talgia Prof. Robert Greer Cohn's arti
cle, "Youth need new spiritual
strength" in the Jan. 15 Daily. His
principal topics, the decadence of
youth and the inconvenience of travel
ing on French trains, were among the
staples of letter writers to the British
newspapers before World War 11. In
accordance with this tradition, coher
ence is sacrificed to passion.
It is good to have it confirmed that
the French become sullen in the face
of adversity; the British would surely
break into cheers at the approach of a
train under like circumstances. Quite
right of Prof. Cohn to hustle aboard
ahead of the selfish throng.
One would like to know, though,
what happened to the admirable pair
of "young guys": Did they avoid be
coming even slightly fazed while
forcing their flocks onto the train, past
Prof. Cohn and his encumbrances? Or
were they left on the platform, thus
missing the demise of Africa that has

gone unnoticed by the press while we
have all been distracted by apartheid?
However, this issue is not Prof.
Cohn's concern. His stated objective is
to advise Stanford students to worry
about "the alarming suicide rate
among the young, the general empti
ness that we learn from that," rather
than about nuclear war, apartheid or
salaries. Fortunately, there have been
no suicides among students at Stan
ford during the last two years, accord
ing to Dr. Vincent D'Andrea of Student
Health Service.
However, the death rate may in
crease if they heed Prof. Cohn's ex
hortation to return to the old days
when "students sometimes were
willing to risk their lives to achieve
excellence, which they witnessed in
the great artists."

Gov. Anaya stood
up for convictions
Ah! Sweet revenge! While there is
no question that some of the violent
crimes committed in our country,

especially premediated murder,
produce a longing for retribution in
kind among all of us, Allan C. Estes
overlooks some important issues in
his attack on former New Mexico Gov.
Toney Anaya and his pardon of death
row inmates (.Daily, Jan. 12, 1987).
The first among these is that past
experience has shown a strong racial
bias in the application of the death
penalty, especially in conservative
states. Fortunately for us, neither Mr.
Estes nor myself will probably ever
have to worry about being falsely
accused, imprisoned or sentenced to
death, but members of ethnic
minorities are not always so
privileged.
To my mind, we as citizens are not
justified in imposing a final sentence
(there is no appeal for someone who
has been executed) unless we have
the confidence that every single per
son who faces that sentence has been
tried, convicted and sentenced with
out any bias, racial or otherwise, and
that they are guilty beyond the
shadow of a doubt. Anyone who feels
that our current justice system meets
those criteria needs very badly to get
back in touch with reality.

As for the victims or their relatives,
perhaps Estes also believes that rape
victims would benefit from watching
their attacker castrated or that robbery
victims would enjoy seeing the
burglars' arms cut off. "An eye for an
eye" is not justice, it is retribution.
Our society has chosen to reject this
sort of barbaric punishment for all
crimes except murder.
Toney Anaya is in fact more coura
geous than most of us. He had the
strength to stand up for his convic
tions in the face of the tide of conser
vatism that is sweeping the country.
His decision may be a slap in the face
of those who voted Anaya out of
office, but some of New Mexico's
voters, albeit a minority, still support
Anaya, and a fair number of those
probably agree with his actions.
Unless Mr. Estes is willing to con
front a person faced with execution
and to take personal responsibility for
putting that person to death, he
should not criticize the actions of
people who believe strongly enough
in their principles to stand up for
them and take unpopular actions.

out any bias, racial or otherwise, and
that they are guilty beyond the
shadow of a doubt. Anyone who feels
that our current justice system meets
those criteria needs very badly to get
back in touch with reality.

As for the victims or their relatives,
perhaps Estes also believes that rape
victims would benefit from watching
their attacker castrated or that robbery
victims would enjoy seeing the
burglars' arms cut off. "An eye for an
eye" is not justice, it is retribution.
Our society has chosen to reject this
sort of barbaric punishment for all
crimes except murder.
Toney Anaya is in fact more coura
geous than most of us. He had the
strength to stand up for his convic
tions in the face of the tide of conser
vatism that is sweeping the country.
His decision may be a slap in the face
of those who voted Anaya out of
office, but some of New Mexico's
voters, albeit a minority, still support
Anaya, and a fair number of those
probably agree with his actions.
Unless Mr. Estes is willing to con
front a person faced with execution
and to take personal responsibility for
putting that person to death, he
should not criticize the actions of
people who believe strongly enough
in their principles to stand up for
them and take unpopular actions.

Nostalgic message
is not so healthy
As an Englishman, I read with nos
talgia Prof. Robert Greer Cohn's arti
cle, "Youth need new spiritual
strength" in the Jan. 15 Daily. His
principal topics, the decadence of
youth and the inconvenience of travel
ing on French trains, were among the
staples of letter writers to the British
newspapers before World War 11. In
accordance with this tradition, coher
ence is sacrificed to passion.
It is good to have it confirmed that
the French become sullen in the face
of adversity; the British would surely
break into cheers at the approach of a
train under like circumstances. Quite
right of Prof. Cohn to hustle aboard
ahead of the selfish throng.
One would like to know, though,
what happened to the admirable pair
of "young guys": Did they avoid be
coming even slightly fazed while
forcing their flocks onto the train, past
Prof. Cohn and his encumbrances? Or
were they left on the platform, thus
missing the demise of Africa that has

gone unnoticed by the press while we
have all been distracted by apartheid?
However, this issue is not Prof.
Cohn's concern. His stated objective is
to advise Stanford students to worry
about "the alarming suicide rate
among the young, the general empti
ness that we learn from that," rather
than about nuclear war, apartheid or
salaries. Fortunately, there have been
no suicides among students at Stan
ford during the last two years, accord
ing to Dr. Vincent D'Andrea of Student
Health Service.
However, the death rate may in
crease if they heed Prof. Cohn's ex
hortation to return to the old days
when "students sometimes were
willing to risk their lives to achieve
excellence, which they witnessed in
the great artists."

Gov. Anaya stood
up for convictions
Ah! Sweet revenge! While there is
no question that some of the violent
crimes committed in our country,

especially premediated murder,
produce a longing for retribution in
kind among all of us, Allan C. Estes
overlooks some important issues in
his attack on former New Mexico Gov.
Toney Anaya and his pardon of death
row inmates (.Daily, Jan. 12, 1987).
The first among these is that past
experience has shown a strong racial
bias in the application of the death
penalty, especially in conservative
states. Fortunately for us, neither Mr.
Estes nor myself will probably ever
have to worry about being falsely
accused, imprisoned or sentenced to
death, but members of ethnic
minorities are not always so
privileged.
To my mind, we as citizens are not
justified in imposing a final sentence
(there is no appeal for someone who
has been executed) unless we have
the confidence that every single per
son who faces that sentence has been
tried, convicted and sentenced with
out any bias, racial or otherwise, and
that they are guilty beyond the
shadow of a doubt. Anyone who feels
that our current justice system meets
those criteria needs very badly to get
back in touch with reality.

As for the victims or their relatives,
perhaps Estes also believes that rape
victims would benefit from watching
their attacker castrated or that robbery
victims would enjoy seeing the
burglars' arms cut off. "An eye for an
eye" is not justice, it is retribution.
Our society has chosen to reject this
sort of barbaric punishment for all
crimes except murder.
Toney Anaya is in fact more coura
geous than most of us. He had the
