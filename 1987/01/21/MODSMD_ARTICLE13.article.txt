# Keep questioning why in your life

### 
My parents nearly died in an auto accident on
Monday, Feb. 17, 1986. I flew home to Boston to be
with my family and stopped out from Stanford last
spring. During my stay at home, I came in touch with
valuable lessons about how people work, about sup
port, and about honesty and clarity about why one
does things. While I understood these messages
during a traumatic period in my life, I believe they
have meaning that allows them to extend beyond
crisis periods and to be useful in everyday life.

It had already been a bad weekend, my quarter
was not going particularly well, and I had a paper
due on Thursday. So when I received a message
which said that my brother Mike had called and that
the message was urgent, I did not get too excited. I
called Mike at the Tsiehs' house. He told me that our
parents had been in a serious car accident in New
Hampshire.
It is impossible to immediately assimilate the true
meaning of such devastating information. I talked
with Mike for a while, got off the phone, and felt
dazed as the facts started to sink in. My mom was in a
coma, my dad could barely talk. Would they live?
1 lived the next two days in a fog. A major event in
my life had occurred, yet everything seemed the
same. People talked about their weekends as classes
rolled on. Questions kept crashing into my head.
Should 1 go home? What if they die? Why the acci
dent? Why am I here? I felt totally alone and terrified
even though the reality of the accident had not hit
home.
At the urging of several neighbors and some
friends here, I decided to go home. During the plane
ride I found myself thinking that maybe the accident
had not happened, that somehow I would find out
that everything was all right after all. I saw my broth
ers when I got home. Part of me understood how
needy they were and how glad they were that I had
come home, and part of me still did not comprehend
the severity of the situation. Jon and Mike had already
seen Mom and said that she did not lix>k as bad as
they thought she would. I went to the hospital.
I saw my dad first. He was wearing a neck brace,
spoke in a weak tone of voice and looked very frail
and small My denial of the accident was sorely tested
as I talked to him. Yet even though my dad was
injured, I could still talk to him, he could assure me
that he was going to be all right. 1 continued to deny
the severity of the situation I went to see Mom
She looked awful. She had tubes coming out of all
parts of her body, her ribs were broken, and she had
two huge shiners. Worst of all, she was being
breathed for by a respirator Her life depended on a

huge, ugly machine. This was my mother, the woman
who gave life to me, on whom I had depended for so
much. I hated the machine and cursed it as if it were
somehow responsible for her condition. 1 shud
dered, still unable to make the connection between
the woman on the bed in front of me and the vital,
loving, brilliant mother I was so used to and loved so
much.
"Hi, Mom." No answer. 1 continued to talk to her,
hoping, begging, praying that she would answer and
tell me it was all right, that it was all a mistake, that
she would rip off the tubes and we could just go
home and have some Chinese food. No answer. I
held her hand. It was cold and did not respond to my
squeezing. Her eyes were closed and did not open
when I asked her to. I felt very young and wanted to
cry.
I hoped that the first day would be the most diffi
cult and that things would become easy to deal with
after that. I was wrong. Although my brothers and I
eventually became used to going to the hospital
every day, the terror that came with my mom's in
tense vulnerability took a long time to subside. It was
never easy to see her at the mercy of the respirator,
so weak and helpless, so unlike the mother to which
we were accustomed. It remained difficult during
her slow convalescence, even as she made positive
steps and started to walk, talk and function again. Yet
during the traumatic period of my parents' recovery,
I learned valuable lessons.
1 understood that no one does anything without
support. It is more healthy to accept rather than deny
oneself help. The myth of the inexhaustible martyr
who needs no one is a powerful one in our society,
yet is one which I believe does not lead to maximum
health.
I bought into the notion of going it alone" (an
idea which accompanies the martyr myth) a great
deal more before the accident than after. I discov
ered that people generally need other people to help
them through life, both in times of crisis and during
calmer periods. Thus I learned to accept people's
condolences in the winter and spring rather than to
deny them. Similarly, now, if I need a hug after a hard
day. I do not refuse it if it is offered, and I sometimes
ask someone for it. Basically, life is hard, strength lies
in admitting need, and it is OK to ask for help.
I also learned that people deal with life in tremen
dously different ways. A key to maximizing the good
feelings that exist between people lies in finding a
mutual form or activity which allows the positive
emotions to surface. This often requires adjustment
and flexibility on both people's parts.
For example. I am a person who genuinely derives
comfort from talking about emotions. I do it well, I
can generally articulate how I feel, and I usually feel
better after doing so. Before the accident I had given
lip service to not talking about emotions but had
remained steadfast in my conviction that "rapping'"
was the way to go. M\ attitude was something like,
"You don't want to talk. Great, I can accept that. But
let's talk about your not wanting to talk.'" Inflexibility

and a consideration of only one perspective, my own,
characterized my position.
My brothers, on the other hand, work a different
way. While they occasionally talk about their feelings,
they do not derive the same meaning from the activ
ity and also become upset if they feel they are being
pushed to do so.
Shortly after the accident we had several un
pleasant moments in which they felt I was judging
them for not talking, that somehow since they were
not continually discussing how they felt, they were
not dealing with the accident. In reality we were all
struggling with the same devastating situation, yet we
were not comforting each other to the greatest
degree we could because our different methods of
coping were creating noise in the others.
I had to learn that there are other ways to deal than
talk, that sometimes it felt better to them (and even
tually to me, too) to simply hang out, watch television
or play basketball. They had to learn that I was not
judging them, rather I was trying to deal with the
same situation. We succeeded in finding appropriate
ways of being together, and our whole family is
closer than ever now, in part because of the accident.
This greater intimacy could not have occurred with
out an adjustment on everyone's part in which we ac
knowledged difference, treated each other for who
we are and listened to different perspectives.
Finally, I also truly understood that everyone lives
their own lives. No one else lives your life for you.
While parents and friends influence people, in the
end, everyone must make their own decisions, and
everyone must live with the choices they have made.
Thus it is extremely important to be honest with
oneself about how and why one is living.
Because of the extreme circumstances in which I
found myself, I had plenty of opportunities to soul
search during the spring and ask what I was doing
with my life, what it meant, where I was going, and
what I wanted to do with my life. Yet the oppor
tunites to question are always there. The challenge is
to take them up, to really examine oneself and to be
honest about why one is doing whatever one does.
These issues of why and what does it mean are
ones which need to be addressed at all points in
one's life, whether one is a senior at Stanford, a
middle-aged businessman or a confused adolescent.
I urge people to kx>k within themselves and to have
the courage to face the answers and the implications
of the answers, whatever they may be.
It is now almost a year after the accident. Mentally,
my father has recovered, and he has almost made a
full physical recovery. My mom improves in leaps
and bounds. Everyone in my family has a renewed
appreciation of life and how special it is. The acci
dent both crystallized and catalyzed positive
dvnamics in our family. I attempt to keep the lessons
that I learned during the past year in my heart and in
my head â€” I continue to ask why. This is my last

My brothers, on the other hand, work a different

they do not derive the same meaning from the activ

pushed to do so.
Shortly after the accident we had several un
pleasant moments in which they felt I was judging
them for not talking, that somehow since they were
not continually discussing how they felt, they were
not dealing with the accident. In reality we were all
struggling with the same devastating situation, yet we
were not comforting each other to the greatest
degree we could because our different methods of
coping were creating noise in the others.
I had to learn that there are other ways to deal than
talk, that sometimes it felt better to them (and even
tually to me, too) to simply hang out, watch television
or play basketball. They had to learn that I was not
judging them, rather I was trying to deal with the
same situation. We succeeded in finding appropriate
ways of being together, and our whole family is

Finally, I also truly understood that everyone lives
their own lives. No one else lives your life for you.
While parents and friends influence people, in the

everyone must live with the choices they have made.
Thus it is extremely important to be honest with
oneself about how and why one is living.
Because of the extreme circumstances in which I
found myself, I had plenty of opportunities to soul
search during the spring and ask what I was doing
with my life, what it meant, where I was going, and
what I wanted to do with my life. Yet the oppor
tunites to question are always there. The challenge is
to take them up, to really examine oneself and to be
honest about why one is doing whatever one does.
These issues of why and what does it mean are
ones which need to be addressed at all points in
one's life, whether one is a senior at Stanford, a

I urge people to kx>k within themselves and to have

It is now almost a year after the accident. Mentally,

My parents nearly died in an auto accident on
Monday, Feb. 17, 1986. I flew home to Boston to be
with my family and stopped out from Stanford last
spring. During my stay at home, I came in touch with
valuable lessons about how people work, about sup
port, and about honesty and clarity about why one
does things. While I understood these messages
during a traumatic period in my life, I believe they
have meaning that allows them to extend beyond
crisis periods and to be useful in everyday life.

It had already been a bad weekend, my quarter
was not going particularly well, and I had a paper
due on Thursday. So when I received a message
which said that my brother Mike had called and that
the message was urgent, I did not get too excited. I
called Mike at the Tsiehs' house. He told me that our
parents had been in a serious car accident in New
Hampshire.
It is impossible to immediately assimilate the true
meaning of such devastating information. I talked
with Mike for a while, got off the phone, and felt
dazed as the facts started to sink in. My mom was in a
coma, my dad could barely talk. Would they live?
1 lived the next two days in a fog. A major event in
my life had occurred, yet everything seemed the
same. People talked about their weekends as classes
rolled on. Questions kept crashing into my head.
Should 1 go home? What if they die? Why the acci
dent? Why am I here? I felt totally alone and terrified
even though the reality of the accident had not hit
home.
At the urging of several neighbors and some
friends here, I decided to go home. During the plane
ride I found myself thinking that maybe the accident
had not happened, that somehow I would find out
that everything was all right after all. I saw my broth
ers when I got home. Part of me understood how
needy they were and how glad they were that I had
come home, and part of me still did not comprehend
the severity of the situation. Jon and Mike had already
seen Mom and said that she did not lix>k as bad as
they thought she would. I went to the hospital.
I saw my dad first. He was wearing a neck brace,
spoke in a weak tone of voice and looked very frail
and small My denial of the accident was sorely tested
as I talked to him. Yet even though my dad was
injured, I could still talk to him, he could assure me
that he was going to be all right. 1 continued to deny
the severity of the situation I went to see Mom
She looked awful. She had tubes coming out of all
parts of her body, her ribs were broken, and she had
two huge shiners. Worst of all, she was being
breathed for by a respirator Her life depended on a

huge, ugly machine. This was my mother, the woman
who gave life to me, on whom I had depended for so
much. I hated the machine and cursed it as if it were
somehow responsible for her condition. 1 shud
dered, still unable to make the connection between
the woman on the bed in front of me and the vital,
loving, brilliant mother I was so used to and loved so
much.
"Hi, Mom." No answer. 1 continued to talk to her,
hoping, begging, praying that she would answer and
tell me it was all right, that it was all a mistake, that
she would rip off the tubes and we could just go
home and have some Chinese food. No answer. I
held her hand. It was cold and did not respond to my
squeezing. Her eyes were closed and did not open
when I asked her to. I felt very young and wanted to
cry.
I hoped that the first day would be the most diffi
cult and that things would become easy to deal with
after that. I was wrong. Although my brothers and I
eventually became used to going to the hospital
every day, the terror that came with my mom's in
tense vulnerability took a long time to subside. It was
never easy to see her at the mercy of the respirator,
so weak and helpless, so unlike the mother to which
we were accustomed. It remained difficult during
her slow convalescence, even as she made positive
steps and started to walk, talk and function again. Yet
during the traumatic period of my parents' recovery,
I learned valuable lessons.
1 understood that no one does anything without
support. It is more healthy to accept rather than deny
oneself help. The myth of the inexhaustible martyr
who needs no one is a powerful one in our society,
yet is one which I believe does not lead to maximum
health.
I bought into the notion of going it alone" (an
idea which accompanies the martyr myth) a great
deal more before the accident than after. I discov
ered that people generally need other people to help
them through life, both in times of crisis and during
calmer periods. Thus I learned to accept people's
condolences in the winter and spring rather than to
deny them. Similarly, now, if I need a hug after a hard
day. I do not refuse it if it is offered, and I sometimes
ask someone for it. Basically, life is hard, strength lies
in admitting need, and it is OK to ask for help.
I also learned that people deal with life in tremen
dously different ways. A key to maximizing the good
feelings that exist between people lies in finding a
mutual form or activity which allows the positive
emotions to surface. This often requires adjustment
and flexibility on both people's parts.
For example. I am a person who genuinely derives
comfort from talking about emotions. I do it well, I
can generally articulate how I feel, and I usually feel
better after doing so. Before the accident I had given
lip service to not talking about emotions but had
remained steadfast in my conviction that "rapping'"
was the way to go. M\ attitude was something like,
"You don't want to talk. Great, I can accept that. But
let's talk about your not wanting to talk.'" Inflexibility

and a consideration of only one perspective, my own,
characterized my position.
My brothers, on the other hand, work a different
way. While they occasionally talk about their feelings,
they do not derive the same meaning from the activ
ity and also become upset if they feel they are being

the woman on the bed in front of me and the vital,
loving, brilliant mother I was so used to and loved so
much.
"Hi, Mom." No answer. 1 continued to talk to her,
hoping, begging, praying that she would answer and
tell me it was all right, that it was all a mistake, that
she would rip off the tubes and we could just go
home and have some Chinese food. No answer. I
held her hand. It was cold and did not respond to my
squeezing. Her eyes were closed and did not open
when I asked her to. I felt very young and wanted to
cry.
I hoped that the first day would be the most diffi
cult and that things would become easy to deal with
after that. I was wrong. Although my brothers and I
eventually became used to going to the hospital
every day, the terror that came with my mom's in
tense vulnerability took a long time to subside. It was
never easy to see her at the mercy of the respirator,
so weak and helpless, so unlike the mother to which
we were accustomed. It remained difficult during
her slow convalescence, even as she made positive
steps and started to walk, talk and function again. Yet
during the traumatic period of my parents' recovery,
I learned valuable lessons.
1 understood that no one does anything without
support. It is more healthy to accept rather than deny
oneself help. The myth of the inexhaustible martyr
who needs no one is a powerful one in our society,
yet is one which I believe does not lead to maximum
health.
I bought into the notion of going it alone" (an
idea which accompanies the martyr myth) a great
deal more before the accident than after. I discov
ered that people generally need other people to help
them through life, both in times of crisis and during
calmer periods. Thus I learned to accept people's
condolences in the winter and spring rather than to
deny them. Similarly, now, if I need a hug after a hard
day. I do not refuse it if it is offered, and I sometimes
ask someone for it. Basically, life is hard, strength lies
in admitting need, and it is OK to ask for help.
I also learned that people deal with life in tremen
dously different ways. A key to maximizing the good
feelings that exist between people lies in finding a
mutual form or activity which allows the positive
emotions to surface. This often requires adjustment
and flexibility on both people's parts.
For example. I am a person who genuinely derives
comfort from talking about emotions. I do it well, I
can generally articulate how I feel, and I usually feel
better after doing so. Before the accident I had given
lip service to not talking about emotions but had
remained steadfast in my conviction that "rapping'"
was the way to go. M\ attitude was something like,
"You don't want to talk. Great, I can accept that. But
let's talk about your not wanting to talk.'" Inflexibility

and a consideration of only one perspective, my own,
characterized my position.
My brothers, on the other hand, work a different
way. While they occasionally talk about their feelings,
they do not derive the same meaning from the activ
ity and also become upset if they feel they are being
pushed to do so.
Shortly after the accident we had several un
pleasant moments in which they felt I was judging
them for not talking, that somehow since they were
not continually discussing how they felt, they were
not dealing with the accident. In reality we were all
struggling with the same devastating situation, yet we
were not comforting each other to the greatest
degree we could because our different methods of
coping were creating noise in the others.
I had to learn that there are other ways to deal than
talk, that sometimes it felt better to them (and even
tually to me, too) to simply hang out, watch television
or play basketball. They had to learn that I was not
judging them, rather I was trying to deal with the
same situation. We succeeded in finding appropriate
ways of being together, and our whole family is
closer than ever now, in part because of the accident.
This greater intimacy could not have occurred with
out an adjustment on everyone's part in which we ac
knowledged difference, treated each other for who
we are and listened to different perspectives.
Finally, I also truly understood that everyone lives
their own lives. No one else lives your life for you.
While parents and friends influence people, in the
end, everyone must make their own decisions, and
everyone must live with the choices they have made.
Thus it is extremely important to be honest with
oneself about how and why one is living.
Because of the extreme circumstances in which I
found myself, I had plenty of opportunities to soul
search during the spring and ask what I was doing
with my life, what it meant, where I was going, and
what I wanted to do with my life. Yet the oppor
tunites to question are always there. The challenge is
to take them up, to really examine oneself and to be
honest about why one is doing whatever one does.
These issues of why and what does it mean are
ones which need to be addressed at all points in
one's life, whether one is a senior at Stanford, a
middle-aged businessman or a confused adolescent.
I urge people to kx>k within themselves and to have
the courage to face the answers and the implications
of the answers, whatever they may be.
It is now almost a year after the accident. Mentally,
my father has recovered, and he has almost made a
full physical recovery. My mom improves in leaps
and bounds. Everyone in my family has a renewed
appreciation of life and how special it is. The acci
dent both crystallized and catalyzed positive
dvnamics in our family. I attempt to keep the lessons
that I learned during the past year in my heart and in
my head â€” I continue to ask why. This is my last
column for this volume of The Daily. Thank you for

My parents nearly died in an auto accident on
Monday, Feb. 17, 1986. I flew home to Boston to be
with my family and stopped out from Stanford last
spring. During my stay at home, I came in touch with
valuable lessons about how people work, about sup
port, and about honesty and clarity about why one
does things. While I understood these messages
during a traumatic period in my life, I believe they
have meaning that allows them to extend beyond
crisis periods and to be useful in everyday life.

It had already been a bad weekend, my quarter
was not going particularly well, and I had a paper
due on Thursday. So when I received a message
which said that my brother Mike had called and that
the message was urgent, I did not get too excited. I
called Mike at the Tsiehs' house. He told me that our
parents had been in a serious car accident in New
Hampshire.
It is impossible to immediately assimilate the true
meaning of such devastating information. I talked
with Mike for a while, got off the phone, and felt
dazed as the facts started to sink in. My mom was in a
coma, my dad could barely talk. Would they live?
1 lived the next two days in a fog. A major event in
my life had occurred, yet everything seemed the
same. People talked about their weekends as classes
rolled on. Questions kept crashing into my head.
Should 1 go home? What if they die? Why the acci
dent? Why am I here? I felt totally alone and terrified
even though the reality of the accident had not hit
home.
At the urging of several neighbors and some
friends here, I decided to go home. During the plane
ride I found myself thinking that maybe the accident
had not happened, that somehow I would find out
that everything was all right after all. I saw my broth
ers when I got home. Part of me understood how
needy they were and how glad they were that I had
come home, and part of me still did not comprehend
the severity of the situation. Jon and Mike had already
seen Mom and said that she did not lix>k as bad as
they thought she would. I went to the hospital.
I saw my dad first. He was wearing a neck brace,
spoke in a weak tone of voice and looked very frail
and small My denial of the accident was sorely tested
as I talked to him. Yet even though my dad was
injured, I could still talk to him, he could assure me
that he was going to be all right. 1 continued to deny
the severity of the situation I went to see Mom
She looked awful. She had tubes coming out of all
parts of her body, her ribs were broken, and she had
two huge shiners. Worst of all, she was being
breathed for by a respirator Her life depended on a

huge, ugly machine. This was my mother, the woman
who gave life to me, on whom I had depended for so
much. I hated the machine and cursed it as if it were
somehow responsible for her condition. 1 shud
dered, still unable to make the connection between
the woman on the bed in front of me and the vital,
loving, brilliant mother I was so used to and loved so
much.
"Hi, Mom." No answer. 1 continued to talk to her,
hoping, begging, praying that she would answer and
tell me it was all right, that it was all a mistake, that
she would rip off the tubes and we could just go
home and have some Chinese food. No answer. I
