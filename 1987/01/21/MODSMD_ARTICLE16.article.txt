# JOSEPH E. GREEN II & ERIC JACKSON
## 
### 
We still cannot explain why we spent hours waiting out in the cold just to
pounce on an unsuspecting victim. Or why we skipped various commitments just
so that we would be free to follow the intended target around campus. Or why
we resorted to childish name calling and bickering over who was killed and who
had been mercifully spared.
At first, we thought that this game would be a great way of blowing off steam
and would provide something fun to do. But there was nothing much fun about
leading friends on wild goose chases, cheating, deceiving and becoming down
right sneak)'. The game created an atmosphere of mistrust between friends and
acquaintances. It also failed to relieve any built up stress. If anything it increased
it. Few know the terror of waking up in the middle of a lecture and realizing you
have momentarily let go of your sword.
Even people who chose not to play in this Assassin game became involved. It
was common practice to use non-players in the effort to trick others into releas
ing their sword and becoming vulnerable to the sweet whisper of "Die."
You can easily see how various alliances would form as secrets are passed con
cerning who would be following whom and who has what class at what particular
time. Yes, we joked about certain deaths and tried to convince ourselves that it
was only a game, but there were some serious undertones.
Our waiting in the dark for the victim to appear is similar to a mugger or a rap
ist waiting for a vulnerable person to emerge. Sure, we knew that we would only
be tapping a person with a toy sword, but we also knew that we were invading an
other's privacy. One never knows what one may find out by hiding behind doors
and listening while others plot.
It is naive to think that Assassin is a harmless game. For it is guaranteed to
create certain social schisms, the constant notion that you are being followed,
shame at being known as the one who got killed so easily and tension among
those whom you would normally talk to, due to the fear of letting something slip.
The basic object of the game Assassin is to win by not being killed. It is often
exciting and thrilling. And here lies its popularity and its problem. The motive of
assassin is found in Webster's definition of the word: one that murders for hire or
for a fanatic adherence to a cause.
If you play this game, the cause is to win the game. There are rules, but rules
are made to be broken. The fallacy of Assassin is that its excitement increases with
the level of involvement. And as one's level of involvement goes up, so much
closer does one come to a fanatic adherence.
The winner of the game may enjoy some monetary reward or even some cute
prize, but what does being the winner of a game of Assassin really mean? It means
that you were the one who was most deceptive, most cunning and most deceitful.
Are these qualities we want in a winner?
As far as we could tell, Assassin does have one enlightening value: It teaches
people about just how rotten human nature can be. Our game ended without
casualties and as far as we know, no broken friendships. But someday, will we all
pick up a copy of The Stanford Daily and read about that student who took the
game too far?
