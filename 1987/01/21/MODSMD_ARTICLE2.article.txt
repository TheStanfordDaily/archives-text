# Animal facilities judged adequate
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
The University's animal research
facilities have been judged "very good"
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and the National Institutes of Health.
The USDA has held three unan
nounced inspections of Stanford's re
search facilities in the past year. The in
spections have centered on whether
the animals here are being treated
"humanely" — in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act, which sets the
standards that organizations using
animals must obey.
The most recent inspection, last
Wednesday and Thursday, determined
that Stanford is "a very good facility
with no major problems at all," accord
ing to Dr. Kevin Cassidy, the USDA
veterinary medical officer who over
saw the inspection. NIH inspected
Stanford in December.
If the USDA judges that a research
facility is treating its animals
"inhumanely," it can be fined or, in ex
treme cases, stripped of its registration
by the USDA. All animal research
facilities, like other organizations
dealing with animals — zoos and dog
kennels, for example — must be regis
tered with the USDA to operate.
But the USDA does not address the
complaints of protesters who argue
that the experiments for which animals
are being used are unnecessary.
Dr. Thomas Hamm, director of the
Division of Lab Animal Medicine at
Stanford, said protesters raise ques
tions about the necessity of performing
certain experiments involving animals
as a means for accomplishing their
true objective — to abolish research
that harms laboratory animals.
"The protesters don't want
(Stanford) to do animal research at all.
Why don't they just come out and say
that?" Hamm asked.
The general merit of a researcher's
protocol is evaluated by non
government scientists at the time the
researcher applies for money from the
National Institutes of Health, according
to Sue Meadows, public affairs associ
ate for NIH.
Meadows said an integral part of this
review process deals with the potential
findings of research — how valuable a
discovery the researcher may make,
for example.
"Applicants have to justify the selec
tion and use of animals before they
receive any money from NIH," she
added.
After a researcher receives a grant

from NIH — the largest funder of
animal research in the nation — he
still must answer to the Office of
Protection of Research Risks at NIH.
The office investigates complaints
about research facilities receiving NIH
grants and can suspend funding pend
ing the outcome of an investigation, ac
cording to Bob Schreiber, NIH spokes
man.
"If there are formal complaints and
protests, there'll be an inquiry,
Schreiber added. "It may not necessar
ily be a formal investigation."
Hamm echoed Schreiber's state
ment: "If you lose AAALAC accredita
tion or get cited by the USDA, you
usually get investigated by NIH." He
added that most animal research
facilities in California are not accred
ited by the prestigious American Asso
ciation for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care (AAALAC).
Because the Office of Protection of
Research Risks has been in existence
only since 1985, it was not active
during the darker days of Stanford's
animal research programs.
Stanford lost its AAALAC accredita
tion in 1981 because it "had some bad
facilities that needed replacing,"
Hamm said.
The decision was made by the Divi
sion of Lab Animal Medicine at Stan
ford to give up AAALAC accreditation
until new facilities, which had already
been planned, could be built. Never
theless, Stanford remained in compli
ance with the USDA and NIH regula
tions and did not lose funding, accord
ing to Hamm.

"When accreditation was lost, it was
lost with the understanding that it
would be regained once the new
facilities were built," Hamm said, add
ing that he expects Stanford to be fully
accredited "sometime this spring."
Since 1981, the animal research
facilities at Stanford have improved
notably. "We did have a period of time
during 1982 and 1983 when there
were a lot of small deficiencies at Stan

ford," said James Roswurm, USDA area
veterinarian.
"But the University has cleaned up
its act very nicely, and we've had no
major problems since then," he added.
Dr. Homer Malaby, a retired veteri
nary medical officer who inspected
Stanford for the USDA, said Stanford's
animal research facilities ranged from
"very, very poor to good" in 1982 but

have improved to "very good through
out" as of 1985, when he last visited
Stanford.
The improved ratings, though, did
not come cheaply. RAF-1, the center for
animal research on campus, cost $12
million. Construction begins this
spring on RAF-2, a proposed $17 mil
lion facility adjoining RAF-1. RAF-2 is
expected to be completed by autumn
of 1988, according to Hamm.

tions about the necessity of performing
certain experiments involving animals
as a means for accomplishing their
true objective — to abolish research
that harms laboratory animals.
"The protesters don't want
(Stanford) to do animal research at all.
Why don't they just come out and say
that?" Hamm asked.
The general merit of a researcher's
protocol is evaluated by non
government scientists at the time the
researcher applies for money from the
National Institutes of Health, according
to Sue Meadows, public affairs associ
ate for NIH.
Meadows said an integral part of this
review process deals with the potential
findings of research — how valuable a
discovery the researcher may make,
for example.
"Applicants have to justify the selec
tion and use of animals before they
receive any money from NIH," she
added.
After a researcher receives a grant

from NIH — the largest funder of
animal research in the nation — he
still must answer to the Office of
Protection of Research Risks at NIH.
The office investigates complaints
about research facilities receiving NIH
grants and can suspend funding pend
ing the outcome of an investigation, ac
cording to Bob Schreiber, NIH spokes
man.
"If there are formal complaints and
protests, there'll be an inquiry,
Schreiber added. "It may not necessar
ily be a formal investigation."
Hamm echoed Schreiber's state
ment: "If you lose AAALAC accredita
tion or get cited by the USDA, you
usually get investigated by NIH." He
added that most animal research
facilities in California are not accred
ited by the prestigious American Asso
ciation for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care (AAALAC).
Because the Office of Protection of
Research Risks has been in existence
only since 1985, it was not active
during the darker days of Stanford's
animal research programs.
Stanford lost its AAALAC accredita
tion in 1981 because it "had some bad
facilities that needed replacing,"
Hamm said.
The decision was made by the Divi
sion of Lab Animal Medicine at Stan
ford to give up AAALAC accreditation
until new facilities, which had already
been planned, could be built. Never
theless, Stanford remained in compli
ance with the USDA and NIH regula
tions and did not lose funding, accord
ing to Hamm.

"When accreditation was lost, it was
lost with the understanding that it
would be regained once the new
facilities were built," Hamm said, add
ing that he expects Stanford to be fully
accredited "sometime this spring."
Since 1981, the animal research
facilities at Stanford have improved
notably. "We did have a period of time
during 1982 and 1983 when there
were a lot of small deficiencies at Stan

ford," said James Roswurm, USDA area
veterinarian.
"But the University has cleaned up
its act very nicely, and we've had no
major problems since then," he added.
Dr. Homer Malaby, a retired veteri
nary medical officer who inspected
Stanford for the USDA, said Stanford's
animal research facilities ranged from
"very, very poor to good" in 1982 but

have improved to "very good through
out" as of 1985, when he last visited
Stanford.
The improved ratings, though, did
not come cheaply. RAF-1, the center for
animal research on campus, cost $12
million. Construction begins this
spring on RAF-2, a proposed $17 mil
lion facility adjoining RAF-1. RAF-2 is
expected to be completed by autumn
of 1988, according to Hamm.

After three unannounced inspections in the last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, along with the National
Institutes of Health, judgea as "very good" the University's animal research facilities. Inspections investigate
whether animals are being treated "humanely."
The University's animal research
facilities have been judged "very good"
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and the National Institutes of Health.
The USDA has held three unan
nounced inspections of Stanford's re
search facilities in the past year. The in
spections have centered on whether
the animals here are being treated
"humanely" — in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act, which sets the
standards that organizations using
animals must obey.
The most recent inspection, last
Wednesday and Thursday, determined
that Stanford is "a very good facility
with no major problems at all," accord
ing to Dr. Kevin Cassidy, the USDA
veterinary medical officer who over
saw the inspection. NIH inspected
Stanford in December.
If the USDA judges that a research
facility is treating its animals
"inhumanely," it can be fined or, in ex
treme cases, stripped of its registration
by the USDA. All animal research
facilities, like other organizations
dealing with animals — zoos and dog
kennels, for example — must be regis
tered with the USDA to operate.
But the USDA does not address the
complaints of protesters who argue
that the experiments for which animals
are being used are unnecessary.
