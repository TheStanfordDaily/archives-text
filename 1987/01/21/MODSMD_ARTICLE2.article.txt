# Animal facilities judged adequate

The University's animal research
facilities have been judged "very good"
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and the National Institutes of Health.
The USDA has held three unan
nounced inspections of Stanford's re
search facilities in the past year. The in
spections have centered on whether
the animals here are being treated
"humanely" — in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act, which sets the
standards that organizations using
animals must obey.
The most recent inspection, last
Wednesday and Thursday, determined
that Stanford is "a very good facility
with no major problems at all," accord
ing to Dr. Kevin Cassidy, the USDA
veterinary medical officer who over
saw the inspection. NIH inspected
Stanford in December.
If the USDA judges that a research
facility is treating its animals
"inhumanely," it can be fined or, in ex
treme cases, stripped of its registration
by the USDA. All animal research
facilities, like other organizations
dealing with animals — zoos and dog
