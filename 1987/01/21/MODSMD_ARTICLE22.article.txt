## KAs get mud in their eyes 
### JULIANA HORSEMAN 
It's been a busy couple of months at
the Kappa Alpha fraternity, as members
gear up for a day in the mud. In addi
tion to planning "Fun Week" initiation
events, fraternity members have been
hard at work preparing for Saturday's
mud volleyball tournament at Lake
Lagunita.
The event will benefit KA's national
philanthropic organization, the Mus
cular Dystrophy Association (MDA).
The day's fun is being sponsored by
KSJO Radio, with a $100 entry fee re
quired of all participating teams.
"We hope to provide the Stanford
students and community with an op
portunity to support a worthy organi
zation by participation in an enjoyable
event," said KA Chapter Secretary
Charles Moody.
One organizer, Steve Baer, ex
pressed the hope that "the event will
help to brighten the image of the fra
ternity idea at Stanford in light of
recent fraternity mishaps."
Entrants will include Stanford stu
dent groups and interested businesses.
Those businesses making a contribu
tion of $50 or more will be recognized
in the program to be distributed at the
tournament. Any group on campus, be
it dormitory, Greek group, theme
house or chess club, is urged to take
part.
Response has been positive, accord
ing to Baer, with inital entries from
such campus groups as Burbank, Alpha
Sig and Theta Delts and businesses
such as Chili's, Compadres and
Haagen-Dazs.
KA organizers are aiming for an en
listment of 32 teams, and dorms may
enter as many teams as desired.
"Ten-thousand dollars is our target
sum," Baer explained. "That is, $3,200

from registered teams, plus donations
which are welcomed and appreciated."
In addition, red and white T-shirts will
be on sale for $7 in White Plaza this
week.
Preparations for the tournament
have been underway since the end of
fall quarter, when the fraternity was ap
proached by the local MDA fundraising
representative.
"He gave us different fundraising
ideas that would benefit the organiza
tion, including the idea of this mud
volleyball tourneyment," said KA mem
ber Wayne Cooperman. "The cookie
sale and car wash ideas just didn't have
enough bang."
Since then, KA members, headed by
Jeff Masterson, Charles Grooty and
House President Eric Jacobson, have

collaborated in an exhaustive effort to
prepare for the event. Most members
of the house are involved in a wide
range of preparation duties, from
plowing out and hosing down the lake
the night before to visiting dorms and
local businesses to garner their sup
port.
And what of the actual tournament?
Saturday's teams will consist of six
members (up to six alternates), and
two females must be on the court at all
times."That goes even for the Theta
Delts," added one KA member.
Four courts will be set up, and balls
will be provided by the Athletic De
partment. Teams should arrive at the
lake at 9 a.m. sharp in order to find out
their playing times for the day. The
double-elimination competition
should last until about 3 p.m.
Spectators are invited to attend and
support their teams, give a donation or
just enjoy a day at Lake Lag. "If Burbank
enters a team, we want the whole
dorm there," Baer said.
Viewers can watch from the KA back
yard without getting their feet muddy.
Concessions, including morning coffee
and doughnuts, will be available.
Trophies will be awarded to the three
top teams.
KA organizers are hoping for a
sunny, summer-like day, but rain or
shine, the whistle blows.
"The weather's not a factor," Baer
said. "Our only fear is that the courts
won't be squooshy enough. We want
them good and squooshy."
The deadline for team sign-ups is
Wednesday. All volleyball skill levels
are welcome, and those interested
should contact Masterson at 325-8806
or Baer at 327-2912.
"We hope that this Saturday will be
the biggest campus event of the quar
ter," Baer said. "Bring cheers for your
team, shoes you don't like, homework,
the kids, whatever."

Since then, KA members, headed by
Jeff Masterson, Charles Grooty and
House President Eric Jacobson, have

collaborated in an exhaustive effort to
prepare for the event. Most members
of the house are involved in a wide
range of preparation duties, from
plowing out and hosing down the lake
the night before to visiting dorms and
local businesses to garner their sup
port.
And what of the actual tournament?
Saturday's teams will consist of six
members (up to six alternates), and
two females must be on the court at all
times."That goes even for the Theta
Delts," added one KA member.
Four courts will be set up, and balls
will be provided by the Athletic De
partment. Teams should arrive at the
lake at 9 a.m. sharp in order to find out
their playing times for the day. The
double-elimination competition
should last until about 3 p.m.
Spectators are invited to attend and
support their teams, give a donation or
just enjoy a day at Lake Lag. "If Burbank
enters a team, we want the whole
dorm there," Baer said.
Viewers can watch from the KA back
yard without getting their feet muddy.
Concessions, including morning coffee
and doughnuts, will be available.
Trophies will be awarded to the three
top teams.
KA organizers are hoping for a
sunny, summer-like day, but rain or
shine, the whistle blows.
"The weather's not a factor," Baer
said. "Our only fear is that the courts
won't be squooshy enough. We want
them good and squooshy."
The deadline for team sign-ups is
Wednesday. All volleyball skill levels
are welcome, and those interested
should contact Masterson at 325-8806
or Baer at 327-2912.
"We hope that this Saturday will be
the biggest campus event of the quar
ter," Baer said. "Bring cheers for your
team, shoes you don't like, homework,
the kids, whatever."

It's been a busy couple of months at
the Kappa Alpha fraternity, as members
gear up for a day in the mud. In addi
tion to planning "Fun Week" initiation
events, fraternity members have been
hard at work preparing for Saturday's
mud volleyball tournament at Lake
Lagunita.
The event will benefit KA's national
philanthropic organization, the Mus
cular Dystrophy Association (MDA).
The day's fun is being sponsored by
KSJO Radio, with a $100 entry fee re
quired of all participating teams.
"We hope to provide the Stanford
students and community with an op
portunity to support a worthy organi
zation by participation in an enjoyable
event," said KA Chapter Secretary
Charles Moody.
One organizer, Steve Baer, ex
pressed the hope that "the event will
help to brighten the image of the fra
ternity idea at Stanford in light of
recent fraternity mishaps."
Entrants will include Stanford stu
dent groups and interested businesses.
Those businesses making a contribu
tion of $50 or more will be recognized
in the program to be distributed at the
tournament. Any group on campus, be
it dormitory, Greek group, theme
house or chess club, is urged to take
part.
Response has been positive, accord
ing to Baer, with inital entries from
such campus groups as Burbank, Alpha
Sig and Theta Delts and businesses
such as Chili's, Compadres and
Haagen-Dazs.
KA organizers are aiming for an en
listment of 32 teams, and dorms may
enter as many teams as desired.
"Ten-thousand dollars is our target
sum," Baer explained. "That is, $3,200

from registered teams, plus donations
which are welcomed and appreciated."
In addition, red and white T-shirts will
be on sale for $7 in White Plaza this
week.
Preparations for the tournament
have been underway since the end of
fall quarter, when the fraternity was ap
proached by the local MDA fundraising
representative.
"He gave us different fundraising
ideas that would benefit the organiza
tion, including the idea of this mud
volleyball tourneyment," said KA mem
ber Wayne Cooperman. "The cookie
sale and car wash ideas just didn't have
enough bang."
