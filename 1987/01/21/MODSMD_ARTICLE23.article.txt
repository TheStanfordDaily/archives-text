# Bug checks out cryptic door jamb bar codes
## 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
Why do all of the office door
frames in Building 160 hare bar
codes stuck on them? Is this to
facilitate a quick sale of the depart
ment if necessary?
— Crazy Eddie
I can hear it know.
You like Poli Sci? Crazy Eddie's
got Poli Sci professors and offices at
low, low prices. We've lost our lease.
Everything in the Poli Sci building
must go. Crazy Eddie — his prices
are insane.
The bar codes of which you speak
appear on stickers in door jambs and
display what appears to be the uni
versal product code for the room.
Ellie Moll, an accountant in the
University's Property Administration
office, told me the stickers are not
only in the Poli Sci building.
These "room tag numbers" were
used by Property Administration
several years ago to keep an inven
tory of equipment in classrooms on
campus. Similar stickers are still on
microscopes and computers. A bar
code reader like you'd see in a su
permarket would read the stickers of
all the equipment in the room, and
the person taking inventory would
read the location of the room from
the sticker.
But all was not Camelot.
Many stickers got painted over,
and "creative students started
moving (the stickers) around," Moll
said. Then inventories got screwed
up. Moll said the room tag system
was "pretty much a fiasco from the
start."
Bar codes are still used on equip
ment, but they are no longer used on
the doors. Moll said that the Univer
sity has "an old system that works
very, very well" of identifying rooms
in the Quad by building and room
number. Now persons taking inven
tories simply note the room number.
Moll said that if you want one of
the stickers you find in a door jamb
you can have it; just don't take one
off something else.
Dear Bug Me,
What are those purple,
cauliflower-like flowers planted in
many places on campus? Are they
something that can withstand the
winter cold, or are they some type of
mutation?
— Audrey II
Now you can have your education
and eat it too.
University Groundskeeper Herb
Fong said that the plants are or
namental kale. Yes, kale — that excit
ing relative of the collard green.
The kale comes in white and a

reddish, lavender shade. Fong said
he chose this variety to try to achieve
an arrangement of plants with the
Stanford colors of red and white. Un
fortunately, this batch turned out to
be kind of purple, so Fong said he 11
try the effect again some other time.
For now, they are an "accent plant.
Ornamental kale is a long-lasting,
"cold-tolerant" flowering ornamen
tal plant which lives up to a year. It
was planted about two months ago
and will be replaced with summer
annuals when the season dictates.
You can find these salad fixings
near the Bookstore, the inner Quad,
the Art Gallery and the Graduate
School of Business.

Dear Bug Me,
Exactly why are there tons of thin
silver cylinders hanging from the
ceiling of Maples Pavilion, just
waiting to fall on some unsuspecting
basketball fan? Are they emitting
some sort of mind- control waves, de
signed by Andy Geiger to keefi stu
dents sitting quietly in their seats as
they watch the game?
— 7he Amazing Kreskin
Gary Bruner, operations manager
for the Athletic Department, said that
the cylinders are there to absorb the
sound of the public address system
and the noise in Maples.
Bruner said that without them
"basically you'd have just a big barn
... There'd be a tremendous echo."
Apparently, the cylinders have al
ways been there. I asked Bruner if
there was any concern that the
cylinders would fall down and wipe
out the basketball team. Bruner's
reply: "It hasn't happened yet."

Dear Bug Me,
How many total units are taught
on at erage at Stanford?
— Passed with No Clue
To answer this question, I looked
at a report prepared by Alistair Mur
ray, course file coordinator in the
Registrar's Office. His "Three Quar
ter Summary" for fall, winter and
spring 1985-86 lists enrollments and
the number of units taken at Stan
ford.
For simplicity, I limited this ques
tion to the school of Humanities and
Sciences. With no slight to engineers
intended, the total number of units
(i.e., enrollment of classes multi-

plied by the number of units the
classes can be taken for) in that
school last year was 288,337. Of
those, 232,552 units were taken by
undergraduates, 54,564 units were
taken by graduates, and 1,221 units
were taken by "others."
Dear Bug Me,
There is mud.l talk about the Uni
versity's Centennial — especially
about an affair at the cornerstone.
Where is the cornerstone, and what
does it say ?
— Rocky MCMLXXXVII
The cornerstone, pictured on the
cover of the most recent Faculty/Staff
Directory, is conveniently located
between Memorial Church and
Building 60. It reads, in its entirety:
Leland Stanford Junior University
May 14, 1887.
There's going to be a big party
during "Cornerstone Week" in May.
