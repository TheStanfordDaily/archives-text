## Stanford's role in business innovations 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
In addition to their roles as lecturers
and graders, some Stanford professors
have played important roles in the
formation of many different and
unique businesses.
People, such as Computer Science
Prof. Ed Feigenbaum and his associates
in the University's Knowledge Systems
Laboratories (KSL) started the first two
artificial intelligence companies ever.
Lecturer Allen Adler has used Stanford
facilities in very unusual ways to
develop his flying Aerobie. Bill Hewlett
and Dave Packard met here as under
graduate electrical engineers in 1934
and went on to use their newfound
knowledge to build the largest
electronic test-instruments company in
the world.
The world's first two artificial intelli
gence companies sprouted at KSL —
Intelligenetics, in 1980, and
Teknowledge, in 1981.
KSL is a subgroup within the Com
puter Science Department that does
research in the field of artificial intelli
gence, said Bob Englemore, executive
director of the Heuristic Programming
Project, a subdivision of KSL.
"The kind of work that the KSL has
done is looking at practical applica
tions of artificial intelligence," such as
medical and chemical, Englemore said.
Englemore said what the computer
software replaces is the necessity to
call an expert on a job site or in a lab
when a problem or highly specific
question arises.
In 1980-81, members of KSL deter
mined that there ought to be another
organization, to help companies solve
problems directly, according to
Englemore. Led by Feigenbaum and
Peter Friedland, a computer science

research associate, Intelligenetics was
"chartered to build artificial intelli
gence to help molecular geneticists."
The original software had already
been devised at Stanford. What Intel
ligenetics built was a molecular genet
ics "expert system." An expert com
puter system serves a consultant-type
function — searching large databanks
for knowledge about a particular sub
ject.
In 1981, Teknowledge was created,
becoming the first expansive expert
systems company. Intelligenetics had
dealt solely with molecular genetics,
but Teknowledge sought wider appli
cations for expert systems.
Both companies hired people from
KSL and Stanford graduate students.
Each company is based in the area and
has approximately 200 employees.
Today, the companies are competitors,
but with different emphases,
Englemore said.
Englemore said it is not easy to start
a company on your own, and Allen Ad
ler, designer of the Aerobie, agreed.
"It is important to become an expert
in the field that you are trying to
develop in," Adler said. For example,
understand the physics of what is
trying to be developed "so you can
make one that is really and truly bet
ter."
"Make your number-one priority
high quality. Your chances of success
are much greater," he added. The
Aerobie has a very precise molding
technique, Adler said. Typical toy com
panies would not be that careful, he
added.
Just what is the Aerobie?
Adler, a lecturer in the Engineering
Department, explained it as a much
thinner ring-shaped Frisbee. He said
the Frisbee was limited in flight as a
result of its disc formation. He con

suited both the aerophysics and astro
physics departments on campus to
come up with an alternative design.
Adler said he worked on the design
for more than eight years spending
much of that time developing the air
foil section, which made it fly straight.
Adler said he started fooling around

with the idea in 1976. The ring design
was established in 1979, and the
Aerobie was completed in 1984.
He said he has used both the
Durand wind tunnels and the Mechani
cal Engineering shop to test his flying
machine. Governent agencies have
been interested in the aerodynamics of

the Aerobie, but did not say for what
purpose, he added.
Companies developing from Stan
ford research or resources is far from
new.
Both Hewlett and Packard were un
der the guidance of their Engineering
Prof., Fred Terman, in the early 19305,

according to Emory Rogers, former ex
ecutive director of the Hewlett-Packard
Company Foundation. Terman held
them both in great admiration, Rogers
said.
After Hewlett and Packard
graduated, they went their separate
ways, but Terman continued to
"badger them to form a new com
pany," Rogers said. Terman encour
aged them to start it near a famous uni
versity — not necessarily Stanford.
In 1939, in a garage, Hewlett and
Packard started what is today known as
Hewlett-Packard Corp. It was founded
to make electronic instruments, Rogers
said.
Their first sale was eight instruments
to Walt Disney to help with the then
unique sound system of Fantasia, he
said.
Rogers said that in 1939-1940 —
unlike today — no venture capital
existed. Money, therefore, had to be
generated by the company itself, to
satisfy its technical public.
Much of Hewlett-Packard's monetary
success was reinvested into the com
munity, because from the beginning,
both the individuals and the company
were "public spirited and wanted to
give something back to their univer
sity."
In return, many technically trained
people at Stanford thought Hewlett-
Packard would be a good place to
work, Rogers said.
In the 19505, Hewlett-Packard
started developing medical equip
ment, such as electrocardiograph in
tensive care units. In the 19605, it
began devising instruments for chemi
cal analysis and, later, computers.
Other inventions that followed in
cluded hand calculators and compo
nents inside instruments.
