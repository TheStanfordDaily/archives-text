Reviews this week are in fave Brady
Bunch catchphrases.
The Stranglers — "Dream time"
"Mom always said, don't play ball in
the house!'" "Mom always said, don't
play ball in the house!'" "Mom always
said, don't play ball in the house!' "
To the uninitiated, the Stranglers
sound like they'd be a scary buncha
bemohawked thrashers from some
place in England. Thrashers who
learned that by saying naughty things
about the Queen and getting banned
on the BBC, they could become quite
popular among the trendy Marxist set
who would buy their records, provid
ing the band with a comfortable living
as long as they continued to denounce
everything, bash reporters, snarl often
and put out an occasional 12" single
with lots of screechy guitar and feed
back.
But aside from being from some
where in the United Kingdom and
having the mandatory Leftist Rock
Band Lyrics here and there, the
Stranglers are quite a different bunch
than their name implies. They're
mosdy a pop band. New wavey, but still
pop. This means that people LIKE
them. And that makes the Stranglers
happy. And that makes US happy.
Fans know that the Stranglers dig
lotsa styles. So on "Dreamtime," you
find danceable upbeat melodies with
all kindsa Beatlesquities, like the cool
vocal harmonies and slap-happy drum
min' on "Nice in Nice" (the former is
the overworked English adjective, the

latter the French city).
You also get slower and ethereal
love songs with breathy synths and vo
cals, twangy guitars and repetitive
chori ("Always the Sun"). There are a
coupla cuts with tons o' nifty horn and
keyboard effects and catchy lyrics
delivered in a sort of nonchalant,
wordy, talk-sing vocal style which
Stranglees (sic) will instantly recognize
from earlier Stranglework. And then
there's the rest of the album, which is
made up of yer standard new wave fare
(alternately fast and slow) with lots of
poundin' drums, synths 'n* vocals.
Pretty forgettable.
Yeah, that's the one problem with
this band. They have a coupla songs on
every record that are truly among the
upper crust of new wave nuggets. But
the rest of the songs really just make ya
wanna wait for a singles collection to
come out. And that's a drag.
Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double
Trouble — "Live Alive"
"Booooobby! Ciiiiindy!" "Booooobby!
Ciiiiindy!" "Booooobby! Ciiiiindy!"
"Booooobby!"
You've gotta give credit to the only
man left in the music industry who can
chew tobacco onstage, sing the blues
and play flnger-rippin' guitar all at the
same time. And only Stevie Ray
Vaughan would dare release a double
live blues album (called "Live Alive"
no less) in the slick and slippery '80s,
when live albums have tended to go
the way of bellbottoms and Gerald
Ford.
What brings this album down,
though, is that most of the songs off his
previous albums are not very different
from the older versions. And the solos

have not improved. Also, his hypocriti
cal appeal to give up everything we
own during one of his songs leaves
you feeling like he's trying just a wee
bit too hard to be a sincere guy.
What brings the album up to "pretty
good" is that, no matter what, he's a
great guitarist, and, as is, his solos are
awesome. Furthermore, he's included
three blues covers of songs not on any
previous albums, the best of which is a
cover of Stevie Wonder's
"Superstition" that makes the whole al
bum worth buying. If you don't have
either of his first two records, get them
first. Otherwise, "Live Alive" is on a par

with his third major release, "Soul to
Soul." He ain't pretty, but hey, that's
the blues.
The Chameleons — "Strange
Times"
"Oh, my nose!" "Oh, my nose!" "Oh,
my nose!" "Oh, my!"
The Chameleons are an English
band. You probably know the story by

now. They're widely dug by press and
fans in the United Kingdom, but are
uniformly unknown in the United
States.
So what's the problem? Why the dif
ference?
Suffer, if you will, our superficial at
tempt to answer this mindbender,
since it has applications far beyond this
album. Seems that many listeners here
(we're talkin' people who own
"Thriller" on LP, cassette and CD) ex
pea pop music to provide them with
low-effort, escapist entertainment, not
unlike television.
OK, no problem. Lots of English

people listen for the same reasons. But
there seems to be a marked difference
in the intensity acceptable in so-called
"popular music."
The example of Tears for Fears
comes to mind. Their first album was
intense but popular in the United
Kingdom, their second less direct in its
lyrical and musical message and wildly
popular in the United States. Of
course, there are acts that enjoy con

siderable popularity here despite their
"message" (Hint: He recently released
a live recording ), but usually such acts
do so with a mixed bag of intensity and
fluff.
"Strange Times" shows the
Chameleons attempting to strike such
a balance, even though it doesn't make
the best use of their talent. The band
has shown on previous work that it is
at its best while creating songs calcu
lated to induce uneasiness if not out
right melancholy in its listeners.
This album is an attempt to break away
from such stylistic monotony, and it is
not übiquitously bleak.
Some songs verge on the straightfor
ward style of the Alarm or Cactus
World News, but without the edge that
the anthemic styles of these two bands
give their music.
The band is still at its best creating
longish songs incorporating minimal
instrumentation, and lyrics with
images of isolation, disintegration and
uncertainty, to produce a remarkable
emotional intensity. As such, it is the
polar opposite of escapism. Try listen
ing while watching it rain. So you can
take your pick of styles.
Kate Bush — "The Whole Story"
"Mrs. Brady, something's wrong with
Cindy." "Mrs. Brady, something's
wrong with Cindy." "Mrs. Brady, some
thing's wrong with Cindy." "Mrs. Brady
Ahh, the greatest hits package.
Something about Christmas and mar
keting causes them to flood endlessly
into radio stations and record stores, to
be bought by clueless parents try ing to
satisfy hip teens.
But now even record companies are

starting to get more adventurous,
releasing compilations from artists
who haven't had much success here.
Far be it for us to complain, but the
closest Kate has come to a U.S. hit was
"Running up that Hill from her previ
ous release "Hounds of Love" (and yes,
mom and dad, there s a large sticker
reminding you of this stunning, chart
busting fact).
So whaddya get for eight green
backs? You get almost 50 minutes of
Kate Bush, tracing her career from
since before you were in high school
to the present day, where, in Britain
her videos are anticipated with a fervor
equal to that generated on MTV when
they release new Ratt concert footage.
And you get Kate's voice, which has
led some to fall to the edge of silliness
(sorry, she's married), and some to
take considerable delight in smashing
records containing her girlish warbles^
Essentially, this is a good album for
those whose interest was piqued by
"Running." Most of the songs selected
are similar in style — slow, melodic
and fairly conventional musically,
despite their haunting beauty. Most of
the music's character is provided by
her sultry voice and interesting lyrics.
The record of course contains the
mandatory New Single to attract Old
Listeners, and a new version of her first
hit "Wuthering Heights." Other older
songs sometimes reflect the influence
of the then-dying English art rock
genre (grit your teeth and remind
yourself that you, too, may own some
Yes or Supertramp records). This
record succeeds and does so in a way
which is impossible for most greatest
hits packages, simply because the
majority of its listeners will not have
heard most of its songs. Think of it as
an introduction rather than a rerun.
