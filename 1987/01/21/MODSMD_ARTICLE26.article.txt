# Comedy series a laughing matter

### ROBERT ABRAMS 
Last weekend, Jim, Rick and Bob told a lot of jokes
to a crowd in Memorial Auditorium.
Just who are Jim, Rick and Bob, you ask? They're
probably three guys in your average high school
class, right? Only now they've gone on stage, where
only the headliner gets a stool. And they're supposed
to be funny.
Comedians Jim Samuels, Rick Reynolds and Bob
"The Bobcat" Goldthwait stood on their feet, talked
about various things, did some gestures and were
funny. Ergo, they fit the definition of stand-up com
edian rather nicely.
Among other topics of polite conversation, they
talked about politics, bodily organs, women and
AIDS. What made the night's program funny, and
consistendy funny, was not their material itself. Just
ask yourself, are bodily organs, women and AIDS in
herendy funny? (Politics, on the other hand ...)
Each performer approached his material from a
very different perspective. Jim Samuels, to begin, is
an external comic. He comments on mundane items
that are ordinarily overlooked. For example, did you
ever notice the sign on the Golden Gate Bridge that
says, "Changing tires prohibited"? Think about that
one.

Samuels may have the ideal stand-up style. He
maintains a rapid pace with a punctuated rhythm.
The jokes come in short episodes linked to a single
theme. The transitions between each theme flow
smoothly, since he uses incidents that touch upon
both topics. In addition, he employs just enough ag
gressiveness toward the audience to keep one on
edge. His careful control of gesture and the overall
symmetry of his material add up to a performance
with real finesse.
Rick Reynolds provided a refreshing contrast to
the run-of-the-mill stand-up comedian. Whereas
Samuels is an external comic, Reynolds is an internal
one. In a sense, he is the modern-day equivalent of
the medieval Catholic Confessional.
He brings out his home life and personal history,
and in showing what everyone takes so seriously to
be the silliness that it is, absolves both himself and
the audience of their gripes.
His material is structured more like a monologue
than a stand-up routine. As a result, the laughs come
at longer intervals. His humor is more intellectual.
Whether stand-up comedy is the place for 'unmoved
mover' jokes is something that each audience mem
ber will have to judge for him or herself, however.
After the intermission (wherein the audience

retreated to the lobby, where an unbearable number
of little rolled-up sticks of tobacco were incinerated),
Bob "The Bobcat" Goldthwait came onstage.
Goldthwait is very loud, yells a lot and does a consid
erable amount of (there's no other word for it)
whining.
In spite of this, though, he relates well to the space
and the audience. And if you're willing to endure the
over-amplification and his on-again, off-again diction
problem, he is funny. His trouble is that because he
starts off the show with such intensity (i.e., loudness)
he has nowhere to go. He has no dynamic range.
When he began to talk about his new baby
daughter, his performance changed almost com
pletely. He became peaceful. He seemed happier and
stopped whining. His performance acquired a sub
tlety that was only hinted at in the first half. My sug
gestion is for Goldthwait to place his baby daughter
material near the beginning of his act, so that a posi
tive tone and buildup could be established.
If laughter is the best medicine, then Saturday
night's audience won't need Vitamin C for quite a
while. If you're feeling sick on March 5, and Cowell
can't find the problem, try the next installment in the
Stanford Concert Network's Stand-Up Comedy Se
ries.
