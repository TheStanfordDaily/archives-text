## Injury-plagued netters open five-day tourney 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Seven of the top 10 women's tennis
teams in the nation will be competing
today through Sunday at the Women's
Intercollegiate Invitational at Pacific
Palisades, but Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan isn't overly impressed.
"We played lousy there last year, and
we'll probably play lousy there this
year," said the coach of the defending-
NCAA champions on Monday.
In fact, Stanford did not fare that
poorly last year at Pacific Palisades,
and, in all likelihood, Brennan realizes
that his team will get its share of vic
tories this week. Nevertheless, he is
not crazy about the tournament.
"It's a long tournament, which I'm
not too pleased about," Brennan said,
noting that an extra day has been
added this year to the event, meaning
that the players will miss another day
of school.
Of more concern recently for Bren
nan has been the status of his team,
which is currently ranked No. 1 in the
nation, but has lost two of its stars to
stress-fracture injuries.
Sophomore Eleni Rossides — who
played No. 2 singles last year before
stress fractures in both legs ended her
season — is still unable to play, though
she hopes to be back in the lineup
soon.
The latest Cardinal to be afflicted by
the stress fracture is senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge, arguably Stanford's most
consistent singles performer last
season. Eldredge played No. 3 singles

last year and teamed with Patty Fendick
at No. 1 doubles.
"It's getting better — slowly, but
surely," said Brennan of Eldredge's in
jury, which was apparently caused by
overwork.
Not all of the news has been bad for
the Cardinal recently, however. Fen
dick, not ordinarily a strong early
season performer, captured the singles
title Jan. 4 at the National Collegiate
Classic at Cathedral City. Last May, of
course, Fendick won the NCAA singles
championship in Austin, Texas.
In addition to Fendick, senior Steph
anie Savides and freshman Lisa Green

have been swinging hot rackets.
Savides won the singles and doubles
brackets at the Rolex Northern Califor
nia tournament in November, and
Green advanced to the final at Cathe
dral City before losing to Fendick.
Fendick, Savides and Green will be
joined by juniors Cari Hagey and Kay
Tittle and freshman Valerie Wilson in
Pacific Palisades. Wilson defeated
Emily Cates of Rice and Martina Klug of
U.S. International University before
losing to Long Beach State's Havaja
Frljuckic in the third round of qualify
ing matches yesterday.
Fendick opens against Frljuckic in

first-round singles action today. In
other first-round matches, Savides is
pitted against Arizona's Chris Seiffert,
Hagey plays Houston's Stina Almgren,
Tittle battles UCLA's top player, Jane
Thomas, and Green is matched against
the Bruins' Maria LaFranchi.
The Stanford doubles teams this
week will be Fendick-Savides, Hagey-
Wilson and Green-Tittle.
The tournament will feature the top
schools from California (second
ranked USC, No. 5 California, No. 8 San
Diego State, No. 9 UCLA and No. 13

Despite incurring Brennan's label of

"lousy," the Cardinal had some isolid
individual performances last year at
Pacific Palisades. Fendick swept her
way to the semifinals before losing 7-5,
6-0 to Kuhlman in a match which saw
Fendick injure her ankle.
Eldredge was a quarterfinalist last
year before losing to Kuhlman 1-6, 6-1,
6-3. Tittle also made the quarterfinals,
eventually losing to Fendick 6-2, 6-1.

Senior Patty Fendick, ranked No. 4 in the preseason singles poll, will be one of several highly touted players
competing this week at the Women's Intercollegiate Invitational.
USIU, in addition to the top-ranked
Cardinal), from Texas (No. 4 Trinity
and No. 6 Texas) and from Arizona
(No. 13 Arizona State and No. 19
Arizona). No. 17 Brigham Young will

also be on hand.
Several of the country's top individ
uals will participate. SDSU's Monique
Javer, the top-ranked singles player in
the preseason poll, USC's Caroline
Kuhlman (No. 2), Texas' Beverly
Bowes (No. 3) and Fendick (No. 4) are
all scheduled to compete. Tittle is
ranked 17th.
Despite incurring Brennan's label of

"lousy," the Cardinal had some isolid
individual performances last year at
Pacific Palisades. Fendick swept her
way to the semifinals before losing 7-5,
6-0 to Kuhlman in a match which saw
Fendick injure her ankle.
Eldredge was a quarterfinalist last
year before losing to Kuhlman 1-6, 6-1,
6-3. Tittle also made the quarterfinals,
eventually losing to Fendick 6-2, 6-1.
Seven of the top 10 women's tennis
teams in the nation will be competing
today through Sunday at the Women's
Intercollegiate Invitational at Pacific
Palisades, but Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan isn't overly impressed.
"We played lousy there last year, and
we'll probably play lousy there this
year," said the coach of the defending-
NCAA champions on Monday.
In fact, Stanford did not fare that
poorly last year at Pacific Palisades,
and, in all likelihood, Brennan realizes
that his team will get its share of vic
tories this week. Nevertheless, he is
not crazy about the tournament.
"It's a long tournament, which I'm
not too pleased about," Brennan said,
noting that an extra day has been
added this year to the event, meaning
that the players will miss another day
of school.
Of more concern recently for Bren
nan has been the status of his team,
which is currently ranked No. 1 in the
nation, but has lost two of its stars to
stress-fracture injuries.
Sophomore Eleni Rossides — who
played No. 2 singles last year before
stress fractures in both legs ended her
season — is still unable to play, though
she hopes to be back in the lineup
soon.
The latest Cardinal to be afflicted by
the stress fracture is senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge, arguably Stanford's most
consistent singles performer last
season. Eldredge played No. 3 singles

last year and teamed with Patty Fendick
at No. 1 doubles.
"It's getting better — slowly, but
surely," said Brennan of Eldredge's in
jury, which was apparently caused by
overwork.
Not all of the news has been bad for
the Cardinal recently, however. Fen
dick, not ordinarily a strong early
season performer, captured the singles
title Jan. 4 at the National Collegiate
Classic at Cathedral City. Last May, of
course, Fendick won the NCAA singles
championship in Austin, Texas.
In addition to Fendick, senior Steph
anie Savides and freshman Lisa Green

have been swinging hot rackets.
Savides won the singles and doubles
brackets at the Rolex Northern Califor
nia tournament in November, and
Green advanced to the final at Cathe
dral City before losing to Fendick.
Fendick, Savides and Green will be
joined by juniors Cari Hagey and Kay
Tittle and freshman Valerie Wilson in
Pacific Palisades. Wilson defeated
Emily Cates of Rice and Martina Klug of
U.S. International University before
losing to Long Beach State's Havaja
Frljuckic in the third round of qualify
ing matches yesterday.
Fendick opens against Frljuckic in

first-round singles action today. In
other first-round matches, Savides is
pitted against Arizona's Chris Seiffert,
Hagey plays Houston's Stina Almgren,
Tittle battles UCLA's top player, Jane
Thomas, and Green is matched against
