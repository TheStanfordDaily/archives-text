# Fencers struggle against strong tournament field
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
It was a humbling weekend for the Stanford fencing
teams.
In eight matches at Northwestern in Evanston, 111., the
men's team went 3-5. The women's team went 4-3 in seven.
The men, ranked "11th in the nation, dropped to" 5-6 on
the season, while the women, ranked seventh nationally,
suffered their first losses and fell to 7-3.
Both the men and the women were soundly defeated in
their opening matches by Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish
are the defending national champions in each division. The
Irish men's team handled the Cardinal 22-5, and the women
defeated Stanford 13-3.
"Notre Dame won the NCAAs last year, and they're a very
tough team," said Stanford epee star Larry Murk.
The Cardinal men then labored through a tough match
with host Northwestern, coming up on the losing end of a
16-11 score.
"We beat Northwestern last year. In general I'd say we've
got a little weaker team this year. We've got a whole new foil
team this year," Murk said. "We started out with a lot of
beginners, and they're doing all right.

"The epee team went 8-1 against Northwestern, which
was promising," he added. And the entire team may have
fared better against the Wildcats if the sabre group hadn't
fallen into a fog on Friday night.
"The sabre team, which is our strongest, was off on the
wrong foot Friday and fenced considerably below their abil
ity against Northwestern," said Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst.
The backbone'of an otherwise very inexperienced team,
the Cardinal sabres got rolling on the meet's second day.
"(Senior Steve) Levitan got it in gear Saturday and didn't
lose a bout all day. He used his head and stayed calm and
fenced consistently as well as I ever have seen him fence,"
Hurst said.
"(Junior Mike) Cramer had a little trouble getting started.
He was still having a bit of difficulty the first couple of bouts
on Saturday, but he got it together against Illinois. And he
improved constantly from the start of the meet to the end of
it," Hurst added.
Levitan went 20-3 for the tournament, Cramer 17-7.
"With what I saw them do on Saturday, I still would have
to say they're the strongest sabre team in the West, which
doesn't mean to say that we don't have to prove it to some
people, like Air Force and Long Beach State," Hurst said.
