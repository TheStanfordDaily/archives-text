# Fencers struggle against strong tournament field
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
It was a humbling weekend for the Stanford fencing
teams.
In eight matches at Northwestern in Evanston, 111., the
men's team went 3-5. The women's team went 4-3 in seven.
The men, ranked "11th in the nation, dropped to" 5-6 on
the season, while the women, ranked seventh nationally,
suffered their first losses and fell to 7-3.
Both the men and the women were soundly defeated in
their opening matches by Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish
are the defending national champions in each division. The
Irish men's team handled the Cardinal 22-5, and the women
defeated Stanford 13-3.
"Notre Dame won the NCAAs last year, and they're a very
tough team," said Stanford epee star Larry Murk.
The Cardinal men then labored through a tough match
with host Northwestern, coming up on the losing end of a
16-11 score.
"We beat Northwestern last year. In general I'd say we've
got a little weaker team this year. We've got a whole new foil
team this year," Murk said. "We started out with a lot of
beginners, and they're doing all right.

"The epee team went 8-1 against Northwestern, which
was promising," he added. And the entire team may have
fared better against the Wildcats if the sabre group hadn't
fallen into a fog on Friday night.
"The sabre team, which is our strongest, was off on the
wrong foot Friday and fenced considerably below their abil
ity against Northwestern," said Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst.
The backbone'of an otherwise very inexperienced team,
the Cardinal sabres got rolling on the meet's second day.
"(Senior Steve) Levitan got it in gear Saturday and didn't
lose a bout all day. He used his head and stayed calm and
fenced consistently as well as I ever have seen him fence,"
Hurst said.
"(Junior Mike) Cramer had a little trouble getting started.
He was still having a bit of difficulty the first couple of bouts
on Saturday, but he got it together against Illinois. And he
improved constantly from the start of the meet to the end of
it," Hurst added.
Levitan went 20-3 for the tournament, Cramer 17-7.
"With what I saw them do on Saturday, I still would have
to say they're the strongest sabre team in the West, which
doesn't mean to say that we don't have to prove it to some
people, like Air Force and Long Beach State," Hurst said.

The Stanford men's and women's fencing teams ran into some stiff competition last weekend at Northwestern. The
seventh-ranked women were 4-3 in the tournament, while the llth-ranked men could win just three of eight
matches.
On Saturday the men split six
matches, losing the first two to Chicago
and Illinois, 14-13 and 17-10,
respectively. They then handled Min
nesota 17-10 and lost to Wisconsin 19-
8. The Cardinal finished with victories
over Ohio State, 14-13, in a match that
was won on the last bout, and
Lawrence College, 23-4.
The big winner for the Cardinal men
was Murk, Stanford's top fencer in the
epee class. He was a scintillating 21-2
for the tournament and drew much
praise from Hurst.
"He did it against top competition,"
Hurst said. "I was delighted at his per
formance. Larrv fenced the smartest

and best I've ever seen him fence. He
was consistently up for every match
and basically outfenced and outwitted
his opponents.
"Larry's gone a long way to cement
ing a berth into this year's NCAAs. I
have seen individual moments of bril
liance in the past few years, but I've
never seen him do it as consistently as
he did this weekend," Hurst added.
Both the No. 2 and No. 3 fencers in
the epee class also impressed Hurst
despite their inexperience — each is a
sophomore and was competing in his
first collegiate competition.
"Although the numbers didn't show
it, Lee Tankersley and Steve Schmidt
really showed great promise," Hurst
said.
The women were led by Holly
Taylor, who went 22-4 in the tourna

ment. No. 2 fencer Alyson Yarus went
14-14, and Tracy Schmidt was 13-7.
"The same things I said about Murk
and Levitan apply to Holly Taylor. She
turned in an outstanding performance
as well. She accorded herself very well
against both Notre Dame and Wiscon
sin,'' Hurst said.
"Holly was our veteran on the
women's side and peformed very
steadily and gave the rest of the
women something to lean on when
they got in there."
Following the loss to Notre Dame,
the women defeated St. Mary's of In
diana Friday, 11-5. Saturday, they
handed losses to Minnesota, Ohio State
and Lawrence, 14-2, 9-7 and 15-1,
respectively. They fell to nationally
ranked Wisconsin 11-5 and lost to
Northwestern by the same score.

The Cardinal men then labored through a tough match
with host Northwestern, coming up on the losing end of a
16-11 score.
"We beat Northwestern last year. In general I'd say we've
got a little weaker team this year. We've got a whole new foil
team this year," Murk said. "We started out with a lot of
beginners, and they're doing all right.

"The epee team went 8-1 against Northwestern, which
was promising," he added. And the entire team may have
fared better against the Wildcats if the sabre group hadn't
fallen into a fog on Friday night.
"The sabre team, which is our strongest, was off on the
wrong foot Friday and fenced considerably below their abil
ity against Northwestern," said Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst.
The backbone'of an otherwise very inexperienced team,
the Cardinal sabres got rolling on the meet's second day.
"(Senior Steve) Levitan got it in gear Saturday and didn't
lose a bout all day. He used his head and stayed calm and
fenced consistently as well as I ever have seen him fence,"
Hurst said.
"(Junior Mike) Cramer had a little trouble getting started.
He was still having a bit of difficulty the first couple of bouts
on Saturday, but he got it together against Illinois. And he
improved constantly from the start of the meet to the end of
it," Hurst added.
Levitan went 20-3 for the tournament, Cramer 17-7.
"With what I saw them do on Saturday, I still would have
to say they're the strongest sabre team in the West, which
doesn't mean to say that we don't have to prove it to some
people, like Air Force and Long Beach State," Hurst said.

The Stanford men's and women's fencing teams ran into some stiff competition last weekend at Northwestern. The
seventh-ranked women were 4-3 in the tournament, while the llth-ranked men could win just three of eight
matches.
On Saturday the men split six
matches, losing the first two to Chicago
and Illinois, 14-13 and 17-10,
respectively. They then handled Min
nesota 17-10 and lost to Wisconsin 19-
8. The Cardinal finished with victories
over Ohio State, 14-13, in a match that
was won on the last bout, and
Lawrence College, 23-4.
The big winner for the Cardinal men
was Murk, Stanford's top fencer in the
epee class. He was a scintillating 21-2
for the tournament and drew much
praise from Hurst.
"He did it against top competition,"
Hurst said. "I was delighted at his per
formance. Larrv fenced the smartest

and best I've ever seen him fence. He
was consistently up for every match
and basically outfenced and outwitted
his opponents.
"Larry's gone a long way to cement
ing a berth into this year's NCAAs. I
have seen individual moments of bril
liance in the past few years, but I've
never seen him do it as consistently as
he did this weekend," Hurst added.
Both the No. 2 and No. 3 fencers in
the epee class also impressed Hurst
despite their inexperience — each is a
sophomore and was competing in his
first collegiate competition.
"Although the numbers didn't show
it, Lee Tankersley and Steve Schmidt
really showed great promise," Hurst
said.
The women were led by Holly
Taylor, who went 22-4 in the tourna

ment. No. 2 fencer Alyson Yarus went
14-14, and Tracy Schmidt was 13-7.
"The same things I said about Murk
and Levitan apply to Holly Taylor. She
turned in an outstanding performance
as well. She accorded herself very well
against both Notre Dame and Wiscon
sin,'' Hurst said.
"Holly was our veteran on the
women's side and peformed very
steadily and gave the rest of the
women something to lean on when
they got in there."
Following the loss to Notre Dame,
the women defeated St. Mary's of In
diana Friday, 11-5. Saturday, they
handed losses to Minnesota, Ohio State
and Lawrence, 14-2, 9-7 and 15-1,
respectively. They fell to nationally
ranked Wisconsin 11-5 and lost to
Northwestern by the same score.
It was a humbling weekend for the Stanford fencing
teams.
In eight matches at Northwestern in Evanston, 111., the
men's team went 3-5. The women's team went 4-3 in seven.
The men, ranked "11th in the nation, dropped to" 5-6 on
the season, while the women, ranked seventh nationally,
suffered their first losses and fell to 7-3.
Both the men and the women were soundly defeated in
their opening matches by Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish
are the defending national champions in each division. The
Irish men's team handled the Cardinal 22-5, and the women
defeated Stanford 13-3.
"Notre Dame won the NCAAs last year, and they're a very
tough team," said Stanford epee star Larry Murk.
