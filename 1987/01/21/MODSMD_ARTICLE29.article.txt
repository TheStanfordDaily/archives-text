# Kerr can only watch as 'Cats claw for title

### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
TUCSON, Ariz. — When the Arizona
Wildcats basketball team defeated Stan
ford 77-70 Monday night, senior guard
Steve Kerr was watching from the
bench, dressed in coat and tie rather
than a basketball uniform. Kerr, an all
conference player last year, is redshirt
ing the 1986-87 season with a severe
knee injury.
The injury occurred July 17, 1986, in
the semifinals of the World Champion
ships in Madrid, Spain. "I was drib
bling toward the lane and about to
make a pass, when I first saw this man
who jumped out in front of me," Kerr
said. "I moved one way and went for
the shot the other way and got my bal
ance all messed up. I felt the knee
buckle and felt the ligaments rip apart.
It hurt quite a bit, that's for sure."
Kerr suffered ripped medial
colateral and torn anterior cruciate
ligaments with 4:07 left in the 96-80
win over Brazil. Initially, the injury was
diagnosed as career-ending by U.S.
team physician Dr. Tim Taft of North
Carolina.
Kerr flew home and underwent
reconstructive surgery July 21 in Tuc
son under Dr. Kim Hewson, whose
medical team has performed 900 knee
operations in the last five years.
"The medial colateral wasn't that big
a deal, but the anterior cruciate — that
was the big one," Kerr said, with the
vivid purple scar, about nine inches
long, standing out on his right knee.
"Generally you're out for at least a
year, but I got a really good surgeon,
good technique. He's pretty well
known, and he's got a good reputation.
It went perfectly and should be prop
erly rehabilitated in nine to 12 months.
Right now I'm a little ahead of
schedule."
Kerr is no stranger to adversity,
however. During the midst of the 1983-
84 season, Kerr's freshman year, his
father, Malcolm Kerr, the president of

the American University in Beirut, was
shot and killed by an assassin. Kerr
went out and hit 5-of-7 from the field
for 15 points against Arizona State the
same week. "It's hard to say I felt good
for Kerr, but I wasn't as upset as I
should have been,'' ASU Coach Bob
Weinhauer said after the Sun Devil
loss.
Kerr, who was born in Beirut and
went to high school in Pacific
Palisades, was offered scholarships by
only Fullerton State and Arizona. "1
wasn't highly recruited," he said.
"Arizona was taking a chance on me. I
was a late bloomer; I wasn't that great
in high school. I'm 100 percent better
since I got here."
The gamble paid off for Arizona.
Kerr has averaged 10.6 points per
game in his three years and averaged
14.4 last year. Along with his All-Pac-10
selection last season, Kerr was named
to the Academic All-Pac-10 team and
led the league in free-throw
percentage at .899.
He averaged 9.2 points per game
and had 15 steals in nine games at the
World Championships, and CBS selec
ted the 6-fcx)t-3 point guard as one of
the five most underrated players in
America.
Stanford has often been the victim of
Kerr's exploits. The senior scored
career highs against the Cardinal three
times in three years, with 16 at Stan
ford his freshman year, then 23 at
home his sophomore year.
Last season, Kerr totaled 24 points in
Arizona's 77-69 win over the Cardinal
on Jan. 9, and also had 10 assists, an
other career high Kerr racked up an
other 22 at Maples in last year's 62-56
Stanford win. Later in the season, Kerr
finally picked a team other than Stan
ford to set a new career-high point
total against, scoring 28 against Miami
(Fla).
"Steve shoots well against any zone,
because the zone is designed to let
perimeter players shoot," Stanford
guard Novian Whitsitt said. "He's just

able to find holes in the zone; he finds
them and capitalizes on them. He takes
advantage of whatever he can."
The Arizona star also had words of
praise for his favorite victim "Stanford
is really pesky," said Kerr, whose
brother John is a graduate student in
agricultural economics at Stanford.
"Not many teams will blow them out.
You can be up by 12, and they'll come
back. In my three years, we've split six,
and they've all gone right down to the
wire."

Arizona is having another good
season this year after winning the Pac
-10 title last year. The Wildcats are cur
rently 5-2 in the Pac-10 and tied for
second with California, riding a three
game winning streak "We're finally
starting to play well," Kerr said
Though we lost to UCLA, we played
well for 35 minutes. We swept the
Washington schools on the road —
we're really coming along
"It's been disappointing because we
came in with high expectations this

year, looking toward the national
level," he added.
The season has been especially diffi
cult for Kerr, who must spend the
entire year as an observer. "It's really
frustrating," he said. "It's hard not to
be able to play. I miss playing in pick
up games, but it was worse when the
season started. It's strenuous.
"For your emotions, it's a no-win sit
uation," he added. "When you're
down, you can't help out. And when
the team wins, you don't feel involved.
You've missed that great feeling of win
ning. I've been on most of the trips,
and I'm bummed out not to be a pan
of it. Either way it's tough to handle."
Many feel with the addition of the
three-point line, Kerr would have been
among the league-leaders in three
pointers if he had played this season.
Kerr, however, does not favor the
new rule. "I don't like it, really," said
Kerr, who sank 18 of 36 three-pointers
during the World Championships.
"You'd think I would; I can shoot from
there. I do personally, but I think
they've got to make it a tough shot. It's
much harder for a big guy to turn
around and hit an eight-footer with a
seven-foot player in his face.
"They should put it back to maybe
the pro distance or keep the game as it
was before. It does make the game
more exciting, but it seems we've been
on the other side of it this year."
Kerr also has definite feelings about
the other new addition to the Pac-10 —
the postseason tournament. "I like it,
but I don't think the winner should be
the recipient of an NCAA tournament
berth," he said. An 18-game schedule
is more indicative than a three-game
tournament. I like it because it will
give the Pac-10 exposure and give the
conference money, which is important.
It will also give the teams some tourna
ment experience to get used to the
pressure."
Meanwhile, six months after surgery,
Kerr is undergoing rehabilitation. "I
started out with a brace for a couple of

months," he said, "and I walked
everywhere. I did manual resistance
and worked out with light weights.
Then I used the Cybex machine and
worked on my hamstring; now I can
work on my quad as well, and I can
ride a stationary bike.
"Now running stairs is the major
part," Kerr said.
Kerr may be able to run on the floor
soon and is scheduled to have one of
the three screws in his knee removed
within the next few weeks. He will be
able to resume basketball in April and,
barring further injury, will be back in
uniform for the Wildcats next season.
"I can't wait," Kerr said. "It's what
I'm working for. It will probably be my
last year of basketball until the Salva
tion Army League.
"I feel like I've played my whole life
to get to this point, and it's been
delayed. I want one more season
injury-free."
Kerr, a history and English major, is
scheduled to graduate in May, and will
in fact be a graduate student when the
next basketball season rolls around.
He might go into coaching following
his college career. "I'd like to be a
graduate assistant here," he said.
But first there is next year and per
haps a professional career after that,
for despite Kerr's lack of recognition
outside of the Pac-10, word is slowly
getting around.
"I wonder who has been keeping
him a secret?" Georgia Tech Coach
Bobby Cremins said.
"Kerr could start for any team in the
ACC," North Carolina's Kenny Smith
said.
"He's a well-rounded player," Whit
sitt said. "He's very gcx>d ballhandling
as a point guard because he makes
very few mistakes. His shooting ability
is obvious; he's a very g<xxi perimeter
shooter.
' He s someone Arizona is missing
this year. Hopefully next year he'll
come back and show everybody what
he can do."

Cardinal killer Steve Kerr of Arizona has been forced to sit out the 1986-87
basketball season because of a severe knee injury suffered at the World
Championships last summer in Madrid, Spain.
