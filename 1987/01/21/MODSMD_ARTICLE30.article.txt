### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Despite a 13th-place finish in the Hammond-Bell Pacific
Coast Collegiate Golf Championship yesterday, most of what
Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf had to say about his team's per
formance was quite positive.
"It was a demanding golf course," Schaaf said of the Santa
Barbara course. "It was our first tournament of the winter,
and I think a top-five finish isn't too far off. We're beginning
to play much better, and we're definitely moving in the right
direction."
The Cardinal finished in a tie for 13th with New Mexico
State at 927, a full 55 strokes off the lead. Fresno State
captured the championship with a three-round, two-day
total of 872, 18 strokes better than second-place finisher
Houston Baptist at 890.
According to Schaaf, the 7,045-yard, par-72 Sandpiper
Golf Course "wasn't set up that difficult" on the 36-hole first
day and yielded some unusually low scores. But yesterday
the tees were moved back, and the course was lengthened
into what Schaaf called "one of the four toughest courses in
the Southwest.
"The 317 we shot in the final round was a head-to-the
caboose score by any stretch of the imagination, but we ac
tually gained about four strokes," he said. "No team broke

301 today (yesterday)."
USC, which finished at 879 to tie for third with San Jose
State, also tied for the individual crown on the shoulders of
a 213 by Terrance Mikell. Fresno State's Kevin Sutherland
carded the other 213. Tony Chieffo of Cal State-Northridge
finished at 216 to capture third, and David Sutherland,
brother of Kevin and also of Fresno State, tied UCSanta Bar
bara's Scott Tuppett for fourth with a 218.
For the Cardinal, sophomores John Mahon and Roger
Miraglia each shot 229 to tie for 25th in the individual com
petition. Mahon went 73-75-81 and Miraglia 73-77-79. Fresh
man Mark Funseth, making his first appearance for Stanford,
shot 77-78-76 for an impressive 231 total. Freshman Don
Christensen finished at 239, and sophomore Brad Geer
totaled 243.
"The first round of Mahon was four over par after nine
holes, and he played the back nine in three under. He
struggled a bit in the fall, but that round may be the begin
ning of some good stuff for him," Schaaf said.
"Miraglia was two under par at one point on the front
nine and fell back. Geer and Christensen have been playing
one and two for us, and this was not a good tourney for
them. No huge cause for concern, and the more optimistic
side is the play of the top three (finishers). Funseth will add
needed depth to the team," Schaaf added.
