## SAC will evaluate Athletic Dept. 
### SEAN KINCH Staff writer 
The Student Athletics Committee
met for the first time last night to estab
lish its purpose and to identify the spe
cific projects the committee will un
dertake.
"The purpose of this committee is to
give the community a base to deal with
issues that concern the Athletic Depart
ment," said Lena Slachmuijlder, ASSU
senator and SAC chairwoman.
Slachmuijlder said that the goal of
the SAC is to evaluate the Athletic De
partment's budget and management
process, and to aid the department in
becoming more responsive to commu
nity needs.
She invoked the University's Operat
ing Budget Guidelines to emphasize
that the Athletic Department will likely

welcome the SAC's suggestions. "A
thoughtful, well-crafted argument,"
she read from the guidelines, "put
forth by an individual or groups ...
can, and often does, influence particu
lar budget decisions.'
George Pegelow, a Kenpo Karate in
structor who is helping to organize the
SAC, pledged his continuing support of
the committee's activities. Pegelow led
the efforts of the original SAC, which
was formed in 1977, and said he feels
that now is the time to make another
thorough evaluation of the Athletic De
partment.
"A year ago in the fall, (University
President) Donald Kennedy invited the
community to question authority ... to
explore fully what Stanford means and
what it can be in the future," Pegelow
said. "We (the SAC) welcome the invi
tation."
Also at the meeting was John
Macaulay, a former Stanford and San
Francisco 49er center who is currently
working in the corporate realm in the
area of "responsible fiscal planning."
Macaulay volunteered his services and

urged those people attending the
meeting to make the most of the SAC
and the resources available to it.
Among the 14 people who attended
the meeting was Sailing Coach Blake
Middleton, whose program has been
hurt by the Athletic Department's
recent budget decisions. Most of those

attending the meeting were students,
but one man described himself simply
as a "lover of Stanford sports."
The SAC will investigate the areas of
budget, management, health and safety
of athletes, athletes' rights and the pos
sibility of initiating an optimal human
performance program at Stanford.


The new Student Athletics Committee will evaluate the Athletic Depart
ment budget and management process, according to Lena Slachmuijider,
ASSU senator and chairwoman of SAC. The committee, which met for the
first time last night, will also provide the community with "a base to deal
with issues that concern the Athletic Department," she said.
