# Davies files new lawsuit
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
Former visiting History Prof. Norman Davies, denied ten
ure at Stanford last January, has filed an amended suit in the
Superior Court of California for damages up to $9 million.
The amended suit, unlike Davies' first, filed last May, names
the University as a defendant.
The original suit, which named as defendants Assoc. His
tory Prof. Harold Kahn and 30 unnamed members of the
History Department, was thrown out of California Superior
Court with a ruling that Davies had no cause of action. In ad
dition, last week a California appellate court barred Davies
from taking a deposition from Kahn regarding a departmen
tal meeting last January on Davies' tenure eligibility.
At that January meeting, the History Department faculty
voted 12-11 to deny Davies the endowed chair.
Davies, one of the world's leading experts on Polish his
tory, was a visiting professor between Sept. 1,1985, and Aug.
31, 1986. He also served as director of Stanford's summer
program in Krakow, Poland, and is a tenured professor of
history at the University of London.
Davies sought to fill the McDonnell chair of East
European Studies at Stanford, which has been vacant since
1979.
In his amended suit, Davies exhibits a letter by then-
Provost James Rosse — currently the University's acting
president — explaining the History Department's decision.
According to Rosse, the meeting assessing Davies'
qualifications for the McDonnell Chair focused almost en
tirely on the visiting professor's bestselling history of
Poland, "God's Playground."
"A number of the faculty believed that God's Playground'
was insufficiently analytical and tends to substitute rhetoric
and irony for clear historical analysis and explanation,"
Rosses letter states.
