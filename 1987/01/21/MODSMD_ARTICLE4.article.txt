# Davies files new lawsuit
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
Former visiting History Prof. Norman Davies, denied ten
ure at Stanford last January, has filed an amended suit in the
Superior Court of California for damages up to $9 million.
The amended suit, unlike Davies' first, filed last May, names
the University as a defendant.
The original suit, which named as defendants Assoc. His
tory Prof. Harold Kahn and 30 unnamed members of the
History Department, was thrown out of California Superior
Court with a ruling that Davies had no cause of action. In ad
dition, last week a California appellate court barred Davies
from taking a deposition from Kahn regarding a departmen
tal meeting last January on Davies' tenure eligibility.
At that January meeting, the History Department faculty
voted 12-11 to deny Davies the endowed chair.
Davies, one of the world's leading experts on Polish his
tory, was a visiting professor between Sept. 1,1985, and Aug.
31, 1986. He also served as director of Stanford's summer
program in Krakow, Poland, and is a tenured professor of
history at the University of London.
Davies sought to fill the McDonnell chair of East
European Studies at Stanford, which has been vacant since
1979.
In his amended suit, Davies exhibits a letter by then-
Provost James Rosse — currently the University's acting
president — explaining the History Department's decision.
According to Rosse, the meeting assessing Davies'
qualifications for the McDonnell Chair focused almost en
tirely on the visiting professor's bestselling history of
Poland, "God's Playground."
"A number of the faculty believed that God's Playground'
was insufficiently analytical and tends to substitute rhetoric
and irony for clear historical analysis and explanation,"
Rosses letter states.
"Examples reportedly discussed at
some length were your treatment of
the Polish uprising of 1830, of the
question of serfdom, and of the eco
nomic transformation of the 16th cen
tury," the letter said.
"According to (History Prof.) Paul
Robinson, no one suggested that either
you or your book was anti-Semitic; the
chapter on the Jews was considered
emblematic of a general concern about
lack of objectivity."
In defense of "God's Playground,"
Rosse cited one outside reviewer who
said that "Davies succeeded in that
most difficult of tasks — that of making
Polish history popular and accessible
to a wide audience in the Anglo-Saxon
world. When last was a book on Polish
history a bestseller?"
Rosse also noted undergraduates'
"overwhelmingly positive" evaluation
of Davies' teaching abilities.
According to Davies, Rosse's letter
"merely reflected the statements of the
defendants who were biased against
the plaintiff by reasons of his political
views and beliefs."

In his suit, Davies charges that a
group of professors, including Kahn
and History Prof. Peter Stansky, made
statements at the meeting which
"carried the innuendo that (Davies)
and his teachings were anti-Semitic."
Included in the suit are descriptions
of the actions of "Kahn, Stansky and
Does' One through Four" at the ten
ure meeting — descriptions allegedly
provided by several Stanford profes
sors:
• A "political attack on plaintiff," al
legedly according to History Prof.
Lewis Spitz;
• A "bushwack" of plaintiff, allegedly
according to Richard Schupbach, chair
man of Slavic Languages and
Literatures and a member of the search
committee;
• "An organized conspiracy against
plaintiff," allegedly according to Spitz
and History Prof. Peter Paret;
• Criticisms that were "factually wrong
or misguided," allegedly according to
History Dept. Chairman James
Sheehan.
These statements have severely
damaged Davies' reputation both per
sonally and academically, according to
the suit.

history a bestseller?"
Rosse also noted undergraduates'
"overwhelmingly positive" evaluation
of Davies' teaching abilities.
According to Davies, Rosse's letter
"merely reflected the statements of the
defendants who were biased against
the plaintiff by reasons of his political
views and beliefs."

In his suit, Davies charges that a
group of professors, including Kahn
and History Prof. Peter Stansky, made
statements at the meeting which
"carried the innuendo that (Davies)
and his teachings were anti-Semitic."
Included in the suit are descriptions
of the actions of "Kahn, Stansky and
Does' One through Four" at the ten
ure meeting — descriptions allegedly
provided by several Stanford profes
sors:
• A "political attack on plaintiff," al
legedly according to History Prof.
Lewis Spitz;
• A "bushwack" of plaintiff, allegedly
according to Richard Schupbach, chair
man of Slavic Languages and
Literatures and a member of the search
committee;
• "An organized conspiracy against
plaintiff," allegedly according to Spitz
and History Prof. Peter Paret;
• Criticisms that were "factually wrong
or misguided," allegedly according to
History Dept. Chairman James
Sheehan.
These statements have severely
damaged Davies' reputation both per
sonally and academically, according to
the suit.
