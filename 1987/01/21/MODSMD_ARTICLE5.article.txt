# DUs describe vandalism accusations as premature
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
The former president of the now
unrecognized Delta Upsilon fraternity, res
ponding last night to allegations that DU mem
bers led recent rowdiness and vandalism on
the Row, warned against premature accusa
tions.
"I'm in no way saying the DUs were guilt
free, but I'm not sure that everything that hap
pened involved DUs," said Scott Hartman,
former president of the fraternity.
On Thursday night, unidentified persons
vandalized two houses on the Row, Hurlburt
and 553 Mayfield (the former DU house),
causing several thousand dollars in damages.

Also, two fights broke out on the Row, one in
volving a DU member and a pledge from the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
In addition, a group of males outside 553
Mayfield repeatedly yelled "give us our house
back," according to 553 resident Dahna Paster
nak.
An investigation into the events of Thursday
night is currently being conducted by the Row
Office, according to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
"Fact-finding is being conducted by the staff
on the Row and elsewhere," Lyons said, noting
that the Office of Judicial Affairs "has taken an
interest" in the investigation.

ters involving possible violations of the Funda
mental Standard.
While acknowledging that a brief fight involv
ing a DU member did occur at the Beta house,
Hartman said he was not aware of the van
dalism or the verbal harassment of 553 Mayfield
until he read about it yesterday in The Daily.
""I think that the article did a pretty good job
of implicating the DUs through circumstantial
evidence," Hartman said.
Lyons said, however, that "if things are as
they appear to be ... the University will take it
pretty seriously. If it turns out to be the DUs, it
could cause the University to reconsider" the
future status of the DU chapter here.
If members of the DU fraternity are found re
sponsible for the vandalism, Lyons said he

doubts "very much whether there will be a DU
chapter" at Stanford again.
But Keith Archuleta, assistant director of the
Row, said the investigation is not focusing on
any group in particular, but on individuals.
"Students who live on the Row have a responsi
bility to respect the rights of others," Archuleta
said.
'I'm just disgusted" with the happenings of
Thursday night, he added.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole echoed Ar
chuleta's feelings. "All students, whether in a
fraternity or sorority or whatever, are obliged
to observe the Fundamental Standard," she
said.
Everyone "acts as if we treat the students as
members of a fraternal organization" instead of

as individuals, she added. "We have to change
our vocabulary."
Since the DUs are not officially recognized
by the University, incidents involving DUs are
not investigated by the Interfraternity Council.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano said that as
of last night, "1 haven't been in contact with the
DUs and no DUs have contacted me."
Hartman, who said he "has yet to hear any
thing from the (University) administration" re
garding the incidents of Thursday night, noted
that the administration "seems willing to mis
construe the facts."
But while acknowledging a "mutual distrust"
between the DUs and the administration,
Hartman expressed confidence that the Row
Office would conduct its investigation fairly.
