# Peaceful change not possible in South Africa, prof. says
## Abernethy: King tactics would not halt apartheid 
### JEFF SEINFELD Staff writer 
Martin Luther King Jr.'s tactics of
peaceful protest and civil dis
obedience would not improve the
poor condition of blacks in South
Africa today, Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy said last night in a
talk at the French House.
Abernethy said the structure of the
South African society and constitu
tion and the stubbornness of the
ruling white minority would impede
peaceful change.
Abernethy spoke and led a discus
sion on apartheid as part of Stan
ford's celebration of King's birthday.
His talk centered around a compari
son of the civil rights issues and
realities in the United States and
those in South Africa.
Both countries share a similar his
tory, he said. The original European
senlers were characteristically Protes
tant, carrying with them a sense of ra
cial superiority, both cultural and bi
ological.
He termed both as "frontier
societies" â€” that is, they both sought
expansion and then fought to retain
gained property, including land and
slaves.
Both nations began with great eco
nomic potential, first in agriculture
and later in industry, and eventually

each saw the development of a pro
fessional middle class, such as prea
chers, lawyers, and teachers, which
has had great ideological influence
on the countries, he said.
But the differences between the
United States and South Africa make
the apartheid problem unique and
incomparable, Abernethy said.
The early white American settlers
"could not have cared less" about the
native Americans, killing them and
forcing them onto reservations, yet
the settlers imported the "needed"
black labor to keep on the land.
The first Europeans to settle South
Africa, however, systematically
pushed the Africans back into outer
regions of the landscape, then
making it very desirable for these
people to return and work for low
wages.
Another historical difference,
Abernethy continued, is that of the
black identity.
In the United States, he said,
blacks strong group identity comes
from their shared fate of having been
separated from their native land. This
identity has slowly diminished with
time, Abernethy said, especially as
American blacks have become inte
grated socially and religiously.
In South Africa, ori the other hand,
although color, language and custom
are indigenous features shared

among the blacks, there are separate
groups whose distinct identities can
be traced back to pre-European
settlement.
Regarding the pursuit of human
rights, Abernethy went on to say, the
demographics of the two countries
set their respective racial tone. The
United States became white
dominated very early in its history,
whereas whites still constitute only
15 percent of the South African popu
lation. The result, Abernethy said, is
that the South African whites have
been, and will continue to be, on the
defensive. This one fact, he said, has
made them, by nature and by policy,
stubborn and afraid.
The functional ability of passive
movements declines in such a
country, according to Abernethy.
In the United States, King was able
to lead the 1963 "March on Washing
ton' because he could appeal to
American moral norms, Abernethy
said. King could legally and passively
go to Washington not only because
the U.S. Constitution and the Su
preme Court protected such basic
rights, but because seeing him there
before the Lincoln Memorial, a sym
bol of all that King fought for, white
Americans could sympathize with his
struggles.
In South Africa, Abernethy ex
plained, the constitution fails to af

firm any civil rights to which blacks
could appeal, and"the only statue in
Pretoria (South Africa's capital)
celebrates the victory (of the whites)
over the Zulu's."
Thus, Abernethy concluded, since
the "center" of South Africa is a defi
nite enemy, nonviolent appeals to the
government will not work, nor will
appeals to the constitution, which
does not provide for such action or
change.
Violence, on the other hand, will
also fail, for the government enjoys
the support of a formidable military,
the professor said.
Abernethy noted that his knowl
edge of South Africa comes in part
from modest travel there and
meetings with both black and white
South African leaders in 1981. He em
phasized that because he is neither a
black nor a South African, he lacks a
"first-hand" point of view of the senti
ments of blacks in both the United
States and South Africa.
