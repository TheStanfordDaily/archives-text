# SUNet networking nears completion
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
The three-year-old, multi-million
dollar SUNet program to transform
Stanford into a networked campus is
nearly complete.
And still a lot of people here aren't
exactly sure what the SUNet cable sys
tem is. That, according to the director
of networking systems, signals its suc
cess.
"The less people who know about it
the better," said William Yundt, of Aca
demic Computing and Information
Systems (ACIS). "You don't want it to
be intrusive or in your way. You want it
to be your servant."
Nearly 70 miles of SUNet cables,
which interconnect academic build
ings and student dormitories with
high-speed computer and video net
works, have been laid out to serve stu
dents, faculty and administrators.
At least 7,000 Stanford students —
more than half of the 13,075 enrolled
— make use of the system through
LOTS (low overhead time-sharing)
computer facilities, Yundt said. The
system also provides links for systems
such as the Socrates library search and
for cable television programs.
And by Feb. 1 it will connect the
Stanford center with the NASA Ames
supercomputer research facility and
with University of California campuses
at Berkeley, San Francisco, Davis and
Santa Cruz. Yundt said. These links are
made possible through a National Sci
ence Foundation grant designed to
promote supercomputer access for re
search. Stanford is the lead NSF grant

recipient in the Bay Area regional net
work.
The $3.7 million University
sponsored program, approved by the
Board of Trustees in 1984, is about 85
percent finished, with completion ex
pected before June at or below the
original cost, Yundt said.
But the University will continue to
expand the SUNet system indefinitely,
Yundt added. Several academic depart
ments and University programs will
fund continued development.
"We will continue expanding and
changing shape," Yundt said. Short
term plans include adding computer
services to Governor's Corner and ex
panding video services to include two
way video in the Communication De
partment studio, he said.
Stanford is one of many universities
across the country establishing a cable
networked campus. Nationally, Stan
ford is "neither at the head of the flock
nor far behind the leader," said Yundt
in a report on academic computing
before the Faculty Senate earlier this
month.
"We have better performance, more
connectivity and a wider range of re
sources accessible on SUNet than
most, if not any other, operational
campus-wide computer network," he
said in his report.
But Yundt and Prof. William Kays,
who headed the senate committee on
academic computing, agreed that Stan
ford will not stay in its "comfortable"
position unless it continues to evolve
with technology and industry.
Stanford has done very well," said
Kays, former dean of the Engineering
School. We are fairly competitive, al
though some of the money the Univer
sity of California system is putting (into
its programs) is a little bit scary.
Ihe computer revolution is begin
ning to overwhelm everything," he
said.
Investment in network facilities has
become crucial to the health of the
University, Yundt said. Stanford needs
the system to maintain its position as a
leading institution in many areas of re
search. And students are beginning to
expect computers in their dormitories.
Times have changed," he said. "At
Stanford, where most students live on
campus, it's now more expected.
People are beginning to say, Why
should you have to leave your dorm to
get to a computer?' "
SUNet has about 2,000 terminal con
nections and 800 computer connec
tions on campus, and number is
growing every day, Yundt said.
"The ultimate goal is to make infor
mation instantly available," Kays said,
so that someday every student would
have their own computer or work sta
tion in their dormitory or in their
room connected to Stanford libraries
and to libraries all over the world."
But no one knows when that could
be available. "It's pie in the sky," Kays
said.
