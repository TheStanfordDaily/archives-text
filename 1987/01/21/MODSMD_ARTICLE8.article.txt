Replacement sought for Casey
WASHINGTON — Senior White House officials have privately begun to
discuss the need to replace CIA Director William Casey, informed govern
ment sources said yesterday. Casey has been hospitalized since surgery last
month for a brain tumor.
White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan has made an "exploratory"
overture to Howard Baker but was told that the former Senate majority
leader is not available, according to a highly placed government source.
The source said the overture had President Reagan's approval.
Another senior official said Reagan is concerned that nothing be done
that might hamper Casey's recovery. Casey's predicament "hurts him very
much," the official said, referring to Reagan.
It was understood from sources that before making any public move, the
officials want to make sure that Casey has recovered to the point that he can
address his own future. As a result, the discussions about a successor at the
Central Intelligence Agency have been handled with extreme delicacy by
top White House aides.
Asked yesterday whether Casey is expected to resume his duties, White
House spokesman Albert Brashear said, "We certainly hope so." He noted
that laws have established a procedure for Casey's deputy, Robert Gates, to
take over in his absence.
Soviet speaks on Chernobyl
WASHINGTON — A top Soviet scientist told a Senate committee yester
day that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident had been
"unthinkable" before it happened.
A wall has been built 150 feet deep in the ground around the plant to
prevent contaminated radioactive water from seeping into a nearby river,
said Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the USSR Academy of Science.
An explosion and fire in Chernobyl's Unit 4 reactor April 26,1986, sent a
burst of high-level radiation into the atmosphere.
Velikhov said that stopping the fire was a major struggle, and he dramati
cally described how helicopters made hundreds of flights daily to dump
sand and other material from about 600 feet above the reactor.
One person was killed by falling debris in the accident, and 30 others
died from radiation sickness.
An additional 237 were hospitalized with radiation sickness, and most of
them have recovered and are working, Velikhov said in a rare appearance
by a Soviet government official before a congressional committee.
Court to rule on press freedom
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed yesterday to decide
whether the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of the press extends to a
high school newspaper.
The case poses the right of students to report on subjects of interest to
their readers — in this instance, on teen-age pregnancies and divorce by
their parents — against the responsibility of school officials to control the
curriculum.
In July, an appeals court ruled that the First Amendment covered high
school newspapers and declared that students could publish what they
wished, as long as the stories would not "materially disrupt" the school at
mosphere or lead to a lawsuit against school officials.
But, in appealing to the Supreme Court, officials argued that the school,
not the students, publishes the paper and that the principal has the final au
thority over what is printed. • •* m
In a 1969 case involving students wearing black armbands to protest the
Vietnam War, the Supreme Court said young people "do not shed their
constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the school
house door."
Immigration rules will change
WASHINGTON — The administration yesterday released tentative immi
gration rules requiring for the first time that all job applicants in the United
States, both citizens and immigrants, prove their legal residency before
being hired.
All new job applicants would have to present to an employer a passport
or naturalization certificate or other documents such as a driver's license
or Social Security card within 24 hours of getting a job, officials said.
The rules, part of a package formally unveiled at a news conference, are
expected to become final in mid-April, following a public comment period.
Designed to prevent American companies from hiring illegal immigrants,
they represent the first major step in implementing the landmark immigra
tion measure signed into law by President Reagan last November.
Officials asserted that the regulations were shaped to avoid placing any
undue burden or scrutiny on foreign-born applicants.
"This affects not just aliens, but U.S. citizens" as well, said Mark Everson,
executive associate commissioner of INS.
In addition, INS officials said that they are considering a charge of $150
to $250 for processing each application for legal residency, an amount that
Latino groups immediately attacked as too high.
Shuttle modifications proposed
When the space shuttle Discovery is ready for launch, perhaps as early as
Feb. 18,1988, it will have better brakes, more efficient engines and perhaps
a crude escape system for the crew, in addition to redesigned solid rocket
boosters, Adm. Richard Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space
flight, announced yesterday.
These are part of more than 400 modifications that will make "a true en
hancement to safety," Truly said at a press conference in Washington.
His announcement comes just a week shy of the anniversary of the Chal
lenger explosion, which killed all seven crew members 73 seconds after
lift-off on Jan. 28, 1986.
Truly said that he is not sure if there is enough time to add the escape
system to Discovery in time for its scheduled launch, adding that the
launch would not be delayed if the system were not ready.
In the post-Challenger re-analysis, NASA ruled out ejection seats and
escape pods because either would require major structural changes in the
orbiter without assuring crew safety, according to William Chandler,
NASA's manager of crew escape systems.
Instead, Truly said yesterday, a side hatch will be fined with explosive
bolts and the astronauts issued parachutes and survival gear so they can
bail out.
This escape route might be used if a launch had to be aborted after the
solid rocket boosters have stopped firing, more than 2 minutes into the
flight, and before the shuttle reaches orbital velocity 7 minutes later. The
crew would bail out only if the orbiter were unable to make it to an emer
gency landing site.
GOP meets to face problems
WASHINGTON — Top officials of the Republican Party gather here today
facing a series of problems that seemed almost unimaginable a year ago: a
weakened President Reagan, a Senate comfortably in the hands of the Dem
ocrats and a drive toward majority party status stalled.
At the same time, the contest for the Republican presidential nomina
tion, expected to be a drawn-out struggle, is showing signs of becoming a
divisive dogfight between candidates representing every major party fac
tion.
Just a year ago, Republican Party strategists here for their annual winter
meeting spoke of a political realignment making the GOP dominant over
the Democrats for the first time since the Great Depression.
A Jan. 15-19 Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that voter allegiance
to the Democratic Party has grown sharply. When voters were asked
whether they consider themselves Democrats or Republicans, Democrats
led 37 percent to 26 percent, a major shift from the near parity of last Sep
tember, when it was 33 percent to 32 percent.

launch would not be delayed if the system were not ready.
In the post-Challenger re-analysis, NASA ruled out ejection seats and
escape pods because either would require major structural changes in the
orbiter without assuring crew safety, according to William Chandler,
NASA's manager of crew escape systems.
Instead, Truly said yesterday, a side hatch will be fined with explosive
bolts and the astronauts issued parachutes and survival gear so they can
bail out.
This escape route might be used if a launch had to be aborted after the
solid rocket boosters have stopped firing, more than 2 minutes into the
flight, and before the shuttle reaches orbital velocity 7 minutes later. The
crew would bail out only if the orbiter were unable to make it to an emer
gency landing site.
GOP meets to face problems
WASHINGTON — Top officials of the Republican Party gather here today
facing a series of problems that seemed almost unimaginable a year ago: a
weakened President Reagan, a Senate comfortably in the hands of the Dem
ocrats and a drive toward majority party status stalled.
At the same time, the contest for the Republican presidential nomina
tion, expected to be a drawn-out struggle, is showing signs of becoming a
divisive dogfight between candidates representing every major party fac
tion.
Just a year ago, Republican Party strategists here for their annual winter
meeting spoke of a political realignment making the GOP dominant over
the Democrats for the first time since the Great Depression.
A Jan. 15-19 Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that voter allegiance
to the Democratic Party has grown sharply. When voters were asked
whether they consider themselves Democrats or Republicans, Democrats
led 37 percent to 26 percent, a major shift from the near parity of last Sep
tember, when it was 33 percent to 32 percent.

Replacement sought for Casey
WASHINGTON — Senior White House officials have privately begun to
discuss the need to replace CIA Director William Casey, informed govern
ment sources said yesterday. Casey has been hospitalized since surgery last
month for a brain tumor.
White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan has made an "exploratory"
overture to Howard Baker but was told that the former Senate majority
leader is not available, according to a highly placed government source.
The source said the overture had President Reagan's approval.
Another senior official said Reagan is concerned that nothing be done
that might hamper Casey's recovery. Casey's predicament "hurts him very
much," the official said, referring to Reagan.
It was understood from sources that before making any public move, the
officials want to make sure that Casey has recovered to the point that he can
address his own future. As a result, the discussions about a successor at the
Central Intelligence Agency have been handled with extreme delicacy by
top White House aides.
Asked yesterday whether Casey is expected to resume his duties, White
House spokesman Albert Brashear said, "We certainly hope so." He noted
that laws have established a procedure for Casey's deputy, Robert Gates, to
take over in his absence.
Soviet speaks on Chernobyl
WASHINGTON — A top Soviet scientist told a Senate committee yester
day that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident had been
"unthinkable" before it happened.
A wall has been built 150 feet deep in the ground around the plant to
prevent contaminated radioactive water from seeping into a nearby river,
said Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the USSR Academy of Science.
An explosion and fire in Chernobyl's Unit 4 reactor April 26,1986, sent a
burst of high-level radiation into the atmosphere.
Velikhov said that stopping the fire was a major struggle, and he dramati
cally described how helicopters made hundreds of flights daily to dump
sand and other material from about 600 feet above the reactor.
One person was killed by falling debris in the accident, and 30 others
died from radiation sickness.
An additional 237 were hospitalized with radiation sickness, and most of
them have recovered and are working, Velikhov said in a rare appearance
by a Soviet government official before a congressional committee.
Court to rule on press freedom
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed yesterday to decide
whether the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of the press extends to a
high school newspaper.
The case poses the right of students to report on subjects of interest to
their readers — in this instance, on teen-age pregnancies and divorce by
their parents — against the responsibility of school officials to control the
curriculum.
In July, an appeals court ruled that the First Amendment covered high
school newspapers and declared that students could publish what they
wished, as long as the stories would not "materially disrupt" the school at
mosphere or lead to a lawsuit against school officials.
But, in appealing to the Supreme Court, officials argued that the school,
not the students, publishes the paper and that the principal has the final au
thority over what is printed. • •* m
In a 1969 case involving students wearing black armbands to protest the
Vietnam War, the Supreme Court said young people "do not shed their
constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the school
house door."
Immigration rules will change
WASHINGTON — The administration yesterday released tentative immi
gration rules requiring for the first time that all job applicants in the United
States, both citizens and immigrants, prove their legal residency before
being hired.
All new job applicants would have to present to an employer a passport
or naturalization certificate or other documents such as a driver's license
or Social Security card within 24 hours of getting a job, officials said.
The rules, part of a package formally unveiled at a news conference, are
expected to become final in mid-April, following a public comment period.
Designed to prevent American companies from hiring illegal immigrants,
they represent the first major step in implementing the landmark immigra
tion measure signed into law by President Reagan last November.
Officials asserted that the regulations were shaped to avoid placing any
undue burden or scrutiny on foreign-born applicants.
"This affects not just aliens, but U.S. citizens" as well, said Mark Everson,
executive associate commissioner of INS.
In addition, INS officials said that they are considering a charge of $150
to $250 for processing each application for legal residency, an amount that
Latino groups immediately attacked as too high.
Shuttle modifications proposed
When the space shuttle Discovery is ready for launch, perhaps as early as
Feb. 18,1988, it will have better brakes, more efficient engines and perhaps
a crude escape system for the crew, in addition to redesigned solid rocket
boosters, Adm. Richard Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space
flight, announced yesterday.
These are part of more than 400 modifications that will make "a true en
hancement to safety," Truly said at a press conference in Washington.
His announcement comes just a week shy of the anniversary of the Chal
lenger explosion, which killed all seven crew members 73 seconds after
lift-off on Jan. 28, 1986.
Truly said that he is not sure if there is enough time to add the escape
system to Discovery in time for its scheduled launch, adding that the
launch would not be delayed if the system were not ready.
