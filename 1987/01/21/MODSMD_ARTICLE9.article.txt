# Helms unseats Lugar in Sen.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Conservative Sen.
Jesse Helms (N.C.) yesterday unseated
moderate Sen. Richard Lugar (Ind.) in
the campaign to be top Republican on
the Foreign Relations Committee.
The surprise decision could escalate
partisan strife over foreign policy in
the last two years of the Reagan admin
istration.
Overturning an earlier 7-0 vote of
committee Republicans, the Senate's
GOP caucus voted 24-17 to give the
ranking minority post on the commit
tee to Helms "in order to preserve the
vital principles of party unity and Sen
ate seniority," in the words of the
resolution the caucus approved. Helms
has been in the Senate four years
longer than Lugar.
The Democratic-controlled Senate
subsequently ratified the action in a

routine vote approving GOP commit
tee rankings.
As chairman of the committee for
the past two years, Lugar emerged as a
strong bipartisan force in the Senate,
working with Democrats and
Republicans to produce compromises
that sometimes generated White
House objections, as in the case of
sanctions on South Africa. Helms is ex
pected to be more confrontational in
dealing with the Democrats and has a
record of fighting with the State De
partment.
Helms, Lugar and other Republicans
attributed Helms' victory primarily to
the seniority issue, including senators'
fears of recurring "popularity contests"
and possible threats to their own
futures in the Senate committee

hierarchy if the seniority system were
breached.
As an example of troubles that occur
in the wake of breakdown in the
seniority system, several senators cited
the current struggle for control of the
House Armed Services Committee.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) won the chair
manship two years ago in a successful
challenge of seniority traditions, only
to run into a buzzsaw of opposition
among Democrats this month that has
led to multiple challenges. A final
round of voting in the House Demo
cratic caucus Thursday is expected to
resolve that fight.
Helms succeeded largely because he
"depersonalized" the contest by turn
ing it into a referendum on the
seniority system, said Sen. William
Armstrong (R-Colo.), echoing many

others. In doing so, Helms won the
support of party liberals such as Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.) who, like Helms,
represent minority viewpoints in the
GOP and can win leadership positions
only if there is strict adherence to
seniority.
Conservative groups mounted an ag
gressive mail campaign on behalf of
Helms, who is their leading champion
in Congress. Some Republicans, espe
cially conservatives, were restive about
Lugar's pragmatism, aversion to con
frontational tactics and willingess to
compromise with the Democrats. They
also reportedly suggested Helms
would be more helpful in conservative
fundraising for the 1988 political cam
paigns.
