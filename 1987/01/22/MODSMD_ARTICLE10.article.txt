# Shultz testifies on Iran meetings

WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of State
George Shultz testified yesterday that,
despite his objections, CIA officials
continued to meet secretly with
Iranians about arms and hostages as
recently as last month, weeks after the
Iran-contra scandal had erupted and
the State Department supposedly had
been put in charge of Iran policy, ac
cording to congressional sources.
Shultz told a three-hour, closed
door session of the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee that he authorized a
Dec. 6 meeting in Europe of State De
partment and CIA officials with Iranian
contacts, according to sources familiar

with his testimony. But Shultz said he
was astonished to learn that the
Iranians had arrived with a nine-point
"agenda," which included acquisition
of American TOW anti-tank missiles
and spare parts for Hawk anti-aircraft
missiles, the release of 17 Islamic Jihad
terrorists held in Kuwait and the
release of American hostages held by
pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.
President Reagan had announced
publicly Nov. 19 that no more arms
would be furnished to Iran. But at the
meeting in Europe, the Iranians in
sisted that the agenda had been
worked out in earlier discussions with

National Security Council representa
tives, according to an account of
Shultz's presentation. Shultz added
that when he discovered to his dismay
that this was true, he immediately or
dered that the U.S.-Iranian discussions
end.
The secretary told the committee he
was furious to discover a few days later
that, despite his instructions, CIA offi
cials resumed the discussions with the
Iranian contacts. Shultz "raised hell"
when hb found out, one lawmaker said
yesterday.
Prior to Shultz's disclosure yester
day, the last known meeting between

Iranian and American officials, includ
ing CIA officials and Lt. Col. Olivet"
North of the NSC staff, took place in
Geneva Nov. 8-10, in die week after
disclosure of the Reagan administra
tion's Iranian initiative by a Lebanese
magazine. No details of this meeting
have been disclosed.
On Dec. 6, the day that U.S. and
Iranian officials were meeting again in
Europe, Reagan said in his Saturday
radio broadcast that his efforts to forge
relationships with "moderates" in Iran
had been "broken off' after they were
publicized.
