# 'Bell Jar' film triggers libel suit
## 
### PETER NADAN 
Aspiring novelists may find their cre
ative visions severely constrained if a
psychiatrist who claims to be the
model for a character in a novel wins
her libel suit, according to English
Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino.
Dr. Jane Anderson, an assistant pro
fessor of psychiatry at Harvard Univer
sity, filed a libel suit against the estate
of novelist Sylvia Plath in 1982. Assert
ing that she was the inspiration for one
of the protagonists in Plath's 1961
novel, "The Bell Jar," Anderson claims
defamation, intentional infliction of
emotional damage and invasion of
privacy, arising out of the 1979 movie
version of the book.
She later filed a suit against the
movie company and its distributors, in
corporating the original suit in the sub

sequent action.
Stanford professors showed mixed
reactions to the suit. Although all those
questioned were in favor of artists'
freedom of creativity, the degree to
which they defended such rights dif
fered.
Calling the suit "ominous and dan
gerous," Sorrentino, an author himself,
expressed strong opposition to the le
gal action. "1 think libel laws applied to
fiction should be rigorously cir
cumscribed. How can a writer of fic
tion develop a character without step
ping on someone's toes? Anyone could
find characteristics in any character
and say hey, that's me.' Take Hamlet or
Don Quixote, for example."
'Writer's don't have a carte blanche
to libel and defame," countered En
glish Prof. Nancy Packer, also an au
thor. "I don't think the right of the art

ist is the only right."
She did, however, have reservations
about such cases. "They are radical and
dangerous unless there's real danger
to the person being libeled."
Law Prof. Thomas Grey found it
"very disturbing from the point of view
of the fiction writer." Grey said he
hopes Anderson does not win the suit.
" The Bell Jar' is a fine work of an,
and it is inconceivable that damages
should be recovered," he said. He also
noted that there have been an increas
ing number of such libel suits recently.
The suit sets the stage for a battle be
tween the right of artists to create fic
tional characters based upon their life
experiences, and the right of individ

uals to their privacy.
The suit centers on the portrayal of
Anderson, as Joan Gilling, in the
movie. Gilling is shown as a
homosexual who attempts to lure her
lover into making a lovers' suicide
pact. While this incident is of question
able veracity, there are many
similarities between the lives of Ander
son and Gilling Lawyers on both sides
of the case agree that the real-life An
derson is reproduced in the movie as
Gilling.
Defense attorney Harry Manion 111
said he would argue in the trial that the
problem was "carelessness" by the
movie producers, according to The
Times.
