President Reagan may finally be learning his lesson.
The recent decision by Reagan to testify before the
special review board investigating the Iran arms scandal
indicates that he might no longer keep his knowledge a
deep, dark secret. The decision is a step in the right di
rection from what has been kx)king like the return of
Watergate.
Partly because of the inevitable confinement resulting
from his recent operation, Reagan has been particularly
reclusive since his initial reaction to the exposure of the
arms deal. The public's inability to know exactly where
the president stands and to what extent he was involved
in the deal has led to wild speculation and rampant im
aginings as to what the "big, bad government" has done
this time.
The testimony of the other officials involved has not
shed much light on the issue, since the Fifth Amendment
has been exercised with unprecedented regularity

during the review. There seems to be no source that will
give a straightforward answer to the press, which has led
the media to feed on leaks. If Reagan has learned any
thing from Watergate, it should be that the media's —
and hence the public's — inability to get an official,
verifiable answer is very detrimental to the White
House's image.
Now is the time for Reagan to clear the slate and ex
plain to the nation exactly what happened. If Reagan is
guilty of any crime, the press is bound to find out eventu
ally. Any attempt at a coverup will be no more successful
than Nixon's desperate, bungled attempt more than a de
cade ago. Reagan needs to provide a good example and
tell the truth — the whole truth — so the other people
involved will come out with the full story.
The American people are tired of wondering how cor
rupt the White House really is. Reagan will have the
chance soon to let the U.S. public know the facts.
