# The many faces of George Bush
## 
### 
Seven years ago this month, George Bush was
beating Ronald Reagan in the lowa presidential
caucus. Bush — athlete and honor student at Yale,
fighter pilot, self-made millionaire, ambassador, CIA
director — seemed a promising presidential con
tender.
Back then, Bush was a moderate-conservative Re
publican with at least some discernible spine and
capacity for thinking independently. He mocked
Reagan's plan for cutting taxes, spending more on
defense and still balancing the budget, calling it
"voodoo economics." Bush' campaign slogan — "A
president we won't have to train" — was aimed as
much at former governor Reagan as it was at Jimmy
Carter.

Before long, Bush will be running for president
again, only this time as the heir apparent of
Reaganism.
What has happened to Bush in the last seven years?
The reserved but personable candidate with the im
peccable resume has Become the unabashed cheer
leader of the Reagan "revolution." Describing his
metamorphosis means gauging "The Many Faces of
George Bush."
The first face should be called "George The Un
inspiring Preppie." This is the Bush of the 1980 cam
paign — sporting Brooks Brothers suits and button
down collars, running on his resume and vowing not
"to get flamboyant." He didn't, and he didn't win
many primaries.
It wasn't long before George's face changed. By
July 1980, when Reagan picked him to be his running

mate, a new Bush was emerging: "George the Reagan
True Believer."
In lowa, Bush had taken his share of potshots at
Reagan. He once remarked, "No one should read it
as a criticism of Ronald Reagan when I say I have ex
perience in foreign affairs [pause] which he hasn't."
But in July of '80, Bush (the Ivy League oil tycoon)
reflected on his week-old alliance with Reagan (the
Eureka College B-movie star) and proclaimed that
"the overriding thing is that governor Reagan and I
share a common bond."
Bush's political convictions, it would seem, are as
pliable as Silly Putty. The man who once assailed the
Gipper's voodoo economics became a virtual
voodoo doll of the Reagan administration — just say
the word "Reagan" and Bush would launch into a
chirping, gee-whiz testimonial to what a "thrill" it is
to work with a great man like Reagan.
At the vice presidential debate in 1984, Bush tried
to show us another face — "George Bush the Man's
Man." The day after the debate — during which he al
ternately praised Reagan and patronized his op
ponent ("Let me help you, Mrs. Ferraro ...") — Bush
smirked to a union official that he'd "tried to kick a
little ass last night."
Bush the real man, who wasn't going to be chal
lenged by a woman of all people, revealed himself to
be a pathetic child. His strained attempt to be one of
the boys proved nothing so much as his distance
from them. He looked like a fool in the debate, and
his performance afterward underscored his identity
crisis.
Bush suffers from a basic lack of charisma, a
quality Reagan has in abundance and one that Bush
can't manufacture no matter how hard he tries.
His affected enthusiasm during the '84 campaign
succeeded only in insulting the intelligence of the
American voter. Bush looked even more foolish
trying to play the public relations game last summer:
A diplomatic tour of the Middle East degenerated
into farce because Bush insisted that there be camels
at every stop so he could be photographed on them.
Sociologist Max Weber believed that charismatic

leaders derive their legitimacy not from the people
but from their own virtue and dynamism, which the
people then recognize. Weber writes that "the
holder of charisma seizes the task that is adequate for
him and demands a following by virtue of his mis
sion."
Hamstrung by his own blandness, Bush has had to
follow a different course — namely, pandering to the
right wing of the Republican party. Afraid to risk it
with the people on his own, Bush is trying to line up
winning support long before the election (or the
party convention) by kissing up to the far right. One
could call it the Walter Mondale strategy, with
ultraconservatives in place of big labor.
The spareness of Bush's self-respect shone
through in late 1985 when William Loeb, the far-right
ideologue and New Hampshire newspaper pub
lisher, died. Although Leob had vilified Bush in print,
calling the vice president a "spoon-fed little rich kid''
and an "incompetent liberal masquerading as a con
servative," Bush turned up as the keynote speaker at
a dinner honoring Loeb. His tribute to Loeb was seen
as a litmus test of his conservative convictions.
It is that kind of shameless pandering that led
George Will to observe that Bush speaks not with the
voice of a bold leader but with the "tinny arf' of a lap
dog of conservatism.
Today, in early 1987, we can discern one last face
of Bush — the ashen countenance of a man
paralyzed by scandal, too afraid to say anything as he
watches, his presidential hopes flicker. His behavior
during'the course of the Iran-contra imbroglio pro
vides an apt subscript to the whole affair: "The
Atrophy of George Bush's Spine" (or why, in the face
of crisis, the vice president has slumped out of sight).
There is a certain justice in these recent events.
Bush, who embraced Reagan ism to mask his own in
authenticity, may now be too close to Reagan — and
too much of a wimp — to avoid being suffocated.
