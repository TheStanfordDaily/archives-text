# Looking back but moving forward

This happens to be my final column for Volume
190 of The Daily. I'd like to use this space to
reminisce about my Stanford experience, but I have a
slight problem: My 21st birthday turned out to*be
truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I don't
have much time to write this essay. So, please try to
be patient even if I digress too much. And blame my
friends if you find my writing to be utterly in
coherent.

The moment I arrived at Stanford in the fall of
1984 as an 18-year-old freshman, I realized I'd made
a gigantic transition: I'd changed from a well-known
senior at a small Massachusetts prep school to just a
face in the crowd at a large university. I felt
miserable. Certainly, people I met at Stanford were
friendly, but they weren't friends — all my freinds
were thousands of miles away. Even after Orientation
Week, I often sat by myself in the dining hall and
walked alone at night reliving the good times I'd
shared with my old friends.
It took me a long time to realize that I was making
a huge mistake. Only around the end of the fall quar
ter did I fully understand that I couldn't go back to
the past, that I was only trying to add a sour epilogue
to a wonderful story. It took a wild roommate (name
and phone number withheld), some "cool dudes"
and great RAs to turn things completely around. A te
quila shot or two (or three ...) certainly helped
I had to adjust my thinking in other areas, too.
Academically, I'd been able to do well without much
effort throughout my high school years, and I'd
believed I could get by on less than 50 percent of
what I've got — even in college. My humbling exper
ience came rather early. On my first physics mid
term. I got a 16 out of 30. To a guy who'd never
received any grade below an A' in physics, that mid
term wasn't much of a confidence booster. The
message was clear: "Welcome to college! This ain't
your fifth year at high school. Half-hearted efforts
won't cut it. Your ego trip's over, and you'd better

use all you've got if you want to get somewhere."
Never forgetting that humbling experience, I spent
the rest of my freshman year thoroughly studying
whatever I found to be interesting.
If making a successful transition from high school
to college was the most important task in my fresh
man year, choosing a major seems to have been my
primary concern in my sophomore year. As soon as
the fall quarter started, I felt time was running out.
One down, three to go — I was no longer a freshman
just out of high school. In the next nine quarters, I
had to decide my major, discover all my interests and
choose a career that would make me happy for the
rest of my life. Only nine more quarters! I felt there
was no time to waste. I had wasted enough time in
my freshman year. I didn't want to be like those
seniors who didn't know what they would do after
graduation — what a waste of four years.
With all those thoughts rushing in my head, I care
fully studied "Courses and Degrees." Within two
weeks, I successfully planned out the rest of my Stan
ford career. Since history and physics were my favor
ite subjects in my freshman year, I decided to
double-major in physics and history and finish both
majors by the end of my junior year. According to
The Plan, graduate level courses would be waiting
for me in my senior year. The goal was set. All I had
to do was go for it. Throughout my sophomore year,
I marched at full speed. In the winter quarter, I took
seven courses for a total of 20 units. Even in spring
quarter, I took 18 units.
It wasn't until this year when I realized that there
was something wrong with The Flan. According to
The Plan, I was supposed to take six courses in the
fall quarter. I knew I could handle the workload if I
tried, but I decided not to follow The Plan. It just
wasn't fun anymore, I no longer had any time to
learn what I found to be interesting; I was just study
ing what I was supposed to learn — only
halfheartedly.
I began to realize that I had changed: Unlike my
sophomore year, research in the field of theoretical
physics was no longer my primary interest. The
majority of the world's problems seemed to be social
and political in origin; more scientific and technical
knowledge didn't seem to guarantee a better world. I
felt I ought to try to change the world into a better
place than become a great scientist in isolation. But
The Plan assumed that I was still the same person
who was willing to drive along the Success Track at
maximum speed to reach a goal. Although I was

swept by a certain sense of failure, I decided to trash
The Plan and I dropped a course for the first time in
my Stanford career. My junior year fall quarter thus
turned out to be a quarter of unfulfilled expectations,
somewhat like the chants of "Rose Bowl" and "Sox in
Six."
Looking back, it seems that 1 made the mistake of
looking too far ahead. Just as 1 wasted so much time
reminiscing about die past in my freshman year, 1
spent too much time planning out the future and
blindly following the schedule in my sophomore
year. I failed to look inward — I failed to examine
where my heart really was.
A passage from Carlos Castaneda's "Teachings of
Don Juan" comes to mind: "Any path is only a path,
and there is no affront, to oneself or others, in drop
ping it if that is what your heart tells y0u.... Look at
every path closely and deliberately.... Then ask
yourself, and yourself alone, one question.... Does
this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it
doesn't it is of no use." Instead of following my heart,
however, 1 just set a goal and went for it at full speed.
Once I saw the top of a mountain, I just wanted to
climb up as quickly as possible. What I didn't realize
was that my heart could change during the journey,
that the quickest path to the top could turn out to be
the most unpleasant.
No longer does life seem like a narrow trail
leading to the top of a mountain. There are many
paths that will get you to the top. The point is not
how fast you get there, bui how much you enjoy the
journey as you climb the mountain. As long as the
journey is pleasant, you don't even have to get to the
top. After all, who knows what the view from the top
would be like? Would reaching the top bring you as
much happiness as you once imagined? Perhaps —
but only if you don't change, only if your heart
remains the same.
As for myself, I'm not sure whether I've become
any wiser during the past three years, but I know I've
changed. As I change, decisions believed to be
"right" in the past don't seem all that wise anymore.
In the past, however, once I chose a path, I often
tended to follow that path even if I began to feel un
easy. I was either tcx> busy or too afraid to try an un
familiar path. Instead of looking inward, I just
marched along a path that no longer possessed my
heart Instead of following the heart, I followed the
path.
I can't think of a more costly mistake.
