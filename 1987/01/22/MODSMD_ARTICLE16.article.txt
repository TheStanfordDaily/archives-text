U nderenrollment
not a problem for
Vienna program
1 have just returned from Stanford's
overseas program in Vienna, where I
had one of the best experiences of my
life. I am worried about the program's
closure and would like to add one
more argument in favor of its con
tinuation.
To start, I will counter a point
concerning underenrollment made by
one of the program's leading oppo
nents, Thomas Heller.
Before joining the Vienna program,
I mentioned to Prof. Heller that I
wanted to switch from the Berlin
program, to which I had originally
applied, to the Vienna program. Prof.
Heller urged me to go to Berlin,
explaining that die Vienna program
was "inefficient," had fewer qualified
professors and offered weaker
courses. I consider it very fortunate
that I did not follow his advice.
When I later learned one of Prof.
Heller's main arguments against the
Vienna program was that it suffers
from underenrollment, I could not
help but consider the criticism unfair.
He, as the head of the Overseas
Studies Office, was discouraging
students from entering the Vienna
program, and he was now complain
ing of an underenrollment problem. It
seems to me he contributed to that
problem.
In any case, is there actually an
underenrollment problem? In the
Vienna program, Stanford students are
dispersed in Austrian dorms all over
the city with a limited number of
spaces available. There is no villa in
which all the students can live, which
is one of the many aspect that makes
the Vienna experience unique. Maybe
the Vienna program should be
thought of as a smaller, more intimate
program.
As for Prof. Heller's inefficiency
statement, I never noticed a problem.
The center is run as well as I think it
could be run. Even if it were ineffi
cient, that seems to be a reason to
restructure the program, not close it.
There are many points made by
Prof. Heller in favor of Vienna's
closing that can be easily argued; I

assume most students have already
heard many of them. I feel my point
in response to Prof. Heller's complaint
of the "underenrollment" problem
should receive serious attention and
that this particular complaint is typical
of the many seemingly weak argu
ments he has made in favor of
Vienna's closing.
An additional point I would like (o
add is that the Overseas Studies Office
should listen to the students, since;,
they are the ones for whom the pro
gram is set up, who undergo signifi
cant financial burden for the opportu
nity, and who actually participate in
the program.

Arts theme house
would benefit
entire community
We need a theme house for the arts.
For such a world-class institution, we
have a very low-profile arts commu
nity. How many students swarm into
the Stanford Art Gallery each day?_
How many people have you seen
playing instruments — who aren't
members of the Band? And so on. An
arts theme house would provide a
focal point for anyone talented in or
curious about the arts on campus.
Also, if it is given the facilities, it could
provide training and materials — such
as a darkroom, an informal perform
ing space and a student gallery —
normally unavailable to the non
major.
Notice that I say non-major. It
wouldn't be an untruth to say that the
arts is one of the most attractive fields
to students and people of any career
or major.
Not that I'm an arts maniac. Far
from it — I just have an interest in a
few fields where the end result is
meant to be expressive rather than
economic, and I would like to see
people meeting and gathering for
common interests as well as for race
and for major.
After all, that's what we're here for,
right?
