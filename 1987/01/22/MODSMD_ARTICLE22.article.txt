## A 						place in the sun Kingscote Gardens provides haven for the moneyed 
### JULIANA HORSEMAN 
It is one of the best kept secrets on campus.
It has been the home of world-renowned diplomats, re
searchers, authors and royalty. Although located smack in
the middle of campus, it is sheltered by a beautiful grove of
live oaks and thus continues to be unnoticed by many.
The next time you walk past the Faculty Club en route to
Lake Lagunita, take a minute to glance to your right. There it
lies, a gorgeous 70-year-old, four-story mansion that reeks
of historic significance and charm. It is the only privately
owned apartment building on campus. It bears the dignified
British title, Kingscote Gardens.
Why did former University President Ray Lyman Wilbur
agree to lease the four acres of land for 99 years to private
hands? According to sources in the University Archives,
Sarah Howard (the now-deceased widow of Prof. Bun Estes
Howard) approached Wilbur with die idea of an apartment
building for professors visiting Stanford.

Students living in a large
three-bedroom apartment on
the second floor all agree
that "it's worth the money if
you have the money."

Keeping in mind her personal need for some form of
long-term security for her and her three children, Howard
had construction of the building begin immediately alter
Wilbur's approval in 1916.
The gray stucco building, designed in the English style,
opened its doors to guests the following year. From that day
on, business has been booming — a waiting list on the
manager's desk with names of prospective occupants is not
uncommon.
Linda Foret, the present estate manager, took up
residence there with her family almost a decade ago. She
had moved to California from Texas before being offered
the position over 300 other applicants.
The new manager was apprehensive at first. "I was really
scared that I might mess up," she said. "1 mean, I was

looking after the comfort of Nobel Prize winners —
suppose the plumbing didn't work?"
Foret, a former Cowell Health Center worker, mentioned
her favorite aspect of the job. "It's an educational experi
ence working here. You meet people from all over the
world."
In fact, postcards from many countries are piled up on the
manager's desk, sent by past guests of Kingscote Gardens.
"I've never thrown one away," she said.
Present occupants include professors and visitors from
the Soviet Union, Tokyo, Zimbabwe, Yugoslavia, Czechoslo
vakia and many European countries. Included among
today's guests is Dragan Marc Popov, son of the world fa
mous physician Dr. Ivan Popov.
Author Charles Beardsley wrote a novel entitled "The
Apartments" during his residence there in the 19705. The
fictitious book describes a building called Kumquat Gar
dens, and although Beardsley denies it, the description of
this building and its residents bears uncanny resemblance
to Kingscote and his fellow boarders at the time, according
to archival resources
The published novel described the apartment as "a
swinging California apartment complex where anything
went." Not surprisingly, the perturbed former manager
asked Beardsley to check out.
Foret spoke of other past guests, including Joseph Stalin,
Alaksandr Kerensky and Prof. William Hermanns, long-time
friend of Albert Einstein. "Professor Hermanns lived at
Kingscote for six years and would always bring home
autographed pictures for the children from his lifelong
friend, Einstein," she recalled.
The manager's favorite guest, however, was no less than
the Prince of Romania, George Duca, who came to Stanford
in the early 1970s after attaining American citizenship in
1954.
The young monarchist was instrumental in helping King
Michael of Romania in secret negotiations which eventually
led to Romania's decision to enter World War II on the side
of the Allies against Germany.
At Stanford, Duca taught history and political science
courses (in which he defended monarchism) when he was
not at home in his Kingscote apartment.
Before his recent death, Duca left his and his father's
diplomatic papers and memoirs in the Hoover Institution.
Foret called the impeccably dressed Romanian prince her
"hero" and recalled how "he could be bossy and arrogant at
times but never failed to bring back to Kingscote a memento
from wherever he had been traveling."
Who resides at Kingscote Gardens now? The majority of

the occupants are either Stanford professors and their
spouses or visiting professors doing research at Hoover,
Seventeen Stanford students are also lucky enough to live in
Kingscote's friendly confines.
The rooms, which range from one-room bachelor apart
ments to four-room suites, are open to anyone who is regis
tered with Stanford and who submits an application to the
estate manager.
A 1932 brochure described Kingscote's "dignified en
trance, elegant lounge and lobby and the great curved-glass
front through which the sun streams all year round." The
apartments and furniture have hardly changed at all since
their installment during the first World War.
What has changed is the rent. Foret remembers reading
of the initial $4.50 weekly rent. In 1932, the rooms ranged
from $30 to $100 per month. Today a guest will pay from
$510 to $1,600 per month, depending on the number of
rooms in die apartment.
Plumbing and electrical problems are taken care of by the
management, but Foret warns that "guests must not expect
maid service and must dispose of their own garbage."
Students living in a large, three-bedroom apartment on
the second floor all agree that "it's worth the money if you

have the money." Junior Clare Johnson said she loves her
private glassed-in porch where she enjoys eating breakfast
in the sunshine or listening to music. Don't turn up the
volume, though, for Kingcote's thin walls and uncarpeted
floors make noise unappreciated. Indeed, the 1932 bro
chure reads, "Quiet is a policy of Kingscote; nervous people
will benefit by its restful atmosphere."
One of Johnson's roommates, junior Mary Massengale,
points to the huge walk-in closets and small kitchen where
the three women enjoy cooking their own meals. A large
bathtub is an arresting feature of the small bathroom.
"The best thing about Kingscote Gardens," Johnson said,
"is the locational convenience." Johnson was on un
guaranteed housing and had no time to shop around Palo
Alto for an apartment. "I was desperate for a place to live
and although I'll have to leave Kingscote next quarter be
cause of the expense, I'm really enjoying it now," she said.
About a decade from now, the 99-year lease will ter
minate, and the property will be given back to Stanford.
What will Stanford use the apartments for? No one — not
even the present manager — knows. In the meantime, she
invites students and faculty to stop by Kingscote Gardens
during the day to have a look at history.

Kingscote's friendly confines.
The rooms, which range from one-room bachelor apart
ments to four-room suites, are open to anyone who is regis
tered with Stanford and who submits an application to the
estate manager.
A 1932 brochure described Kingscote's "dignified en
trance, elegant lounge and lobby and the great curved-glass
front through which the sun streams all year round." The
apartments and furniture have hardly changed at all since
their installment during the first World War.
What has changed is the rent. Foret remembers reading
of the initial $4.50 weekly rent. In 1932, the rooms ranged
from $30 to $100 per month. Today a guest will pay from
$510 to $1,600 per month, depending on the number of
rooms in die apartment.
Plumbing and electrical problems are taken care of by the
management, but Foret warns that "guests must not expect
maid service and must dispose of their own garbage."
Students living in a large, three-bedroom apartment on
the second floor all agree that "it's worth the money if you

have the money." Junior Clare Johnson said she loves her
private glassed-in porch where she enjoys eating breakfast
in the sunshine or listening to music. Don't turn up the
volume, though, for Kingcote's thin walls and uncarpeted
floors make noise unappreciated. Indeed, the 1932 bro
chure reads, "Quiet is a policy of Kingscote; nervous people
will benefit by its restful atmosphere."
One of Johnson's roommates, junior Mary Massengale,
points to the huge walk-in closets and small kitchen where
the three women enjoy cooking their own meals. A large
bathtub is an arresting feature of the small bathroom.
"The best thing about Kingscote Gardens," Johnson said,
"is the locational convenience." Johnson was on un
guaranteed housing and had no time to shop around Palo
Alto for an apartment. "I was desperate for a place to live
and although I'll have to leave Kingscote next quarter be
cause of the expense, I'm really enjoying it now," she said.
About a decade from now, the 99-year lease will ter
minate, and the property will be given back to Stanford.
What will Stanford use the apartments for? No one — not
even the present manager — knows. In the meantime, she
invites students and faculty to stop by Kingscote Gardens
during the day to have a look at history.

It is one of the best kept secrets on campus.
It has been the home of world-renowned diplomats, re
searchers, authors and royalty. Although located smack in
the middle of campus, it is sheltered by a beautiful grove of
live oaks and thus continues to be unnoticed by many.
The next time you walk past the Faculty Club en route to
Lake Lagunita, take a minute to glance to your right. There it
lies, a gorgeous 70-year-old, four-story mansion that reeks
of historic significance and charm. It is the only privately
owned apartment building on campus. It bears the dignified
British title, Kingscote Gardens.
Why did former University President Ray Lyman Wilbur
agree to lease the four acres of land for 99 years to private
hands? According to sources in the University Archives,
Sarah Howard (the now-deceased widow of Prof. Bun Estes
Howard) approached Wilbur with die idea of an apartment
building for professors visiting Stanford.

Students living in a large
three-bedroom apartment on
the second floor all agree
that "it's worth the money if
you have the money."

Keeping in mind her personal need for some form of
long-term security for her and her three children, Howard
had construction of the building begin immediately alter
Wilbur's approval in 1916.
The gray stucco building, designed in the English style,
opened its doors to guests the following year. From that day
on, business has been booming — a waiting list on the
manager's desk with names of prospective occupants is not
uncommon.
Linda Foret, the present estate manager, took up
residence there with her family almost a decade ago. She
had moved to California from Texas before being offered
the position over 300 other applicants.
The new manager was apprehensive at first. "I was really
scared that I might mess up," she said. "1 mean, I was

looking after the comfort of Nobel Prize winners —
suppose the plumbing didn't work?"
Foret, a former Cowell Health Center worker, mentioned
her favorite aspect of the job. "It's an educational experi
ence working here. You meet people from all over the
world."
In fact, postcards from many countries are piled up on the
manager's desk, sent by past guests of Kingscote Gardens.
"I've never thrown one away," she said.
Present occupants include professors and visitors from
the Soviet Union, Tokyo, Zimbabwe, Yugoslavia, Czechoslo
vakia and many European countries. Included among
today's guests is Dragan Marc Popov, son of the world fa
mous physician Dr. Ivan Popov.
Author Charles Beardsley wrote a novel entitled "The
Apartments" during his residence there in the 19705. The
fictitious book describes a building called Kumquat Gar
dens, and although Beardsley denies it, the description of
this building and its residents bears uncanny resemblance
to Kingscote and his fellow boarders at the time, according
to archival resources
The published novel described the apartment as "a
swinging California apartment complex where anything
went." Not surprisingly, the perturbed former manager
asked Beardsley to check out.
Foret spoke of other past guests, including Joseph Stalin,
Alaksandr Kerensky and Prof. William Hermanns, long-time
friend of Albert Einstein. "Professor Hermanns lived at
Kingscote for six years and would always bring home
autographed pictures for the children from his lifelong
friend, Einstein," she recalled.
The manager's favorite guest, however, was no less than
the Prince of Romania, George Duca, who came to Stanford
in the early 1970s after attaining American citizenship in
1954.
The young monarchist was instrumental in helping King
Michael of Romania in secret negotiations which eventually
led to Romania's decision to enter World War II on the side
of the Allies against Germany.
At Stanford, Duca taught history and political science
courses (in which he defended monarchism) when he was
not at home in his Kingscote apartment.
Before his recent death, Duca left his and his father's
diplomatic papers and memoirs in the Hoover Institution.
Foret called the impeccably dressed Romanian prince her
"hero" and recalled how "he could be bossy and arrogant at
times but never failed to bring back to Kingscote a memento
from wherever he had been traveling."
Who resides at Kingscote Gardens now? The majority of

the occupants are either Stanford professors and their
spouses or visiting professors doing research at Hoover,
Seventeen Stanford students are also lucky enough to live in
