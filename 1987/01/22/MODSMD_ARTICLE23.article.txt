## A 						Hawaiian spring incentive 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN Staff writer 
HONOLULU — For those of you
who need an incentive, like a
Hawaiian holiday, to get through the
long days of winter quarter, here are
some suggestions of places to rest
and relax during spring break — or
just to dream about.
The friendly island of Molokai is
home to only a few hotels and is one
of the least inexpensive pieces of
paradise in the Pacific. The relaxed
atmosphere of the island is matched
perfectly by the friendly ambiance of
the Sheraton Molokai. The Sheraton
resort uses a rambling, rustic
Polynesian style of architecture to
create a relaxed and casual spirit. Ac
commodations are in spacious two
story building clusters, most over
looking the blue Hawaiian sea. The
resort sits perched atop a sloped cliff
overlooking Diamond Head, which is
on the island of Oahu.

If relaxation is not your style, never
fear. A 15-kilometer jogging and par
course circles the complex, which
also includes an 18-hole golf course.
The resort also boasts a large tennis
complex. Shopping, horseback
riding and swimming are other favor
ite activities.
Sheraton Molokai is offering a spe
cial promotional rate to Daily
readers. The special rate is $65 per
day and will be available until March
31. For reservations call 808-552-
2555.
The exclusive Kona Village is an
authentic South Seas paradise. There
is no high-rise hotel here. Instead
visitors stay in separate grass
thatched "hales" or huts. The hales
are built in the styles of the various
Polynian tribes. The overall effect is
very much that of a primitive South
Seas village.
The Village offers peace, solitude
and a place to rejuvenate the soul.
There are no phones, televisions, no

radios and no air conditioning. A
casual dress code is strictly enforced:
no coats or lies allowed. Life here is
easy and slow.
The staff of Kona Village is ex
tremely loyal. Most have been here
for years. Returning visitors are
remembered by name and are
greeted as members of a family re
turning home.
All activities (except scuba diving)
are at no charge. There is excellent
snorkeling near the entrance to the
village's private cove as well as
several small boats for sailing. After a
lunch of fresh sushi and steaks, more
guests tend to congregate around the
bar adjacent to the pool. For reserva
tions call 800-367-5290.
To many visitors, Oahu offers both
the best and the worst of Hawaii.
Honolulu is the cultural and eco
nomic capital of the state. The island
boasts some of the most beautiful
scenery in the Pacific. The tourist

center of this vacation mecca is fa
mous Waikiki.
Unfortunately for most visitors
there is no way to enjoy the beauty of
this island without surviving tourist
ridden Waikiki. The Kahala Hilton of
fers the ideal solution. Kahala is an
exclusive neighborhood nestled be
tween Diamond Head and Koko
Head. While only a short 10-minute
drive from the hustle and bustle,
Kahala offers a peaceful oasis of lazy
tranquility.
The Kahala Hilton has played host
to such celebrities as Presidents
Reagan, Ford and Nixon as well as
screen stars Cary Grant, Jimmy
Stewart and Sylvester Stallone. Yet all
guests receive special VIP treatment
such as fruit baskets and fresh or
chids each night. The VIP aloha spirit
is assured by means of Kahala's huge
computer. The computer stores the
special habits, preferences and
wishes of Kahala's returning guests.
For reservations, call 800-445-8667.
