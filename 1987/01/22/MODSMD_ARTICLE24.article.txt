# A 						grand Napa country chateau
## 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN Staff writer 
In this era of ultramodern hotels,
motels and executive airport suites, a
true country inn is a refreshing rarity.
The Villa St. Helena in the Napa Valley
is a postcard-perfect model of a
country inn. The villa sits high atop 20
acres of peaceful woodland overlook
ing the Napa Valley.
This bed and breakfast has countless
bedrooms, each with a distinctly
unique decor. One room is decorated
in the soft whites and lace of the Vic
torian period, while the adjacent room
is rich with heavy, dark redwood turn
of-the- century antiques. Each corner
of the estate has its own magic. No two
rooms are even remotely similar, yet
each contains a treasure of eclectic
period-style furniture. All rooms have a
private bath.
Despite its countless bedrooms, the
Villa St. Helena caters to only three for
tunate couples on any given night.
Guests can enjoy complete privacy in
the comfort of their rooms, or are free
to enjoy the spacious common rooms.
There is a beamed-ceiling living room
that forms the gathering place of this
12,000- square-foot, three-level estate.
The television show "Falcon Crest"
recently chose this room to film
several scenes.
Off the living room is a cozy library
with a fireplace and enough literature
to keep guests in reading material for
decades. On the other side of the living
room is a breakfast alcove, where each
morning guests gather for a com
plimentary feast overlooking a large
courtyard and swimming pool. The
villa's unique blend of orange and
strawberry juice is not to be missed.

This beautiful estate has served as a
luxury chateau for the rich and famous
during the 1940s and '50s. It later fell
into a state of disrepair and only now,
after years of tender loving care by inn
keeper Ralph Cotton, has it once again
captured its historic grandeur.

Owner Ralph Cotton's care and con
cern for his guests is evident
everywhere. He appears personally
each morning to supervise breakfast
and linger with guests. He is more than
willing to offer expert free advice on
where to go for the best wine tasting,
dining and touring in the valley.
The Villa St. Helena protects its ex
clusive romantic ambience by means
of the three-quarter-mile-long private
driveway. This bed and breakfast inn is
not for everyone. There are no televi
sions here. Instead, guests are supplied
with a complimentary bottle of wine
with which to entertain themselves.
This is a quiet romantic place to enjoy
with someone special. The numerous
paths around the inn's grounds are
ideal for secluded walks, and each
group of rooms has its own private en
trance.
