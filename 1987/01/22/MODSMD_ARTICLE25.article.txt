## Card in need of win at ASU 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
TEMPE, Ariz. â€” Following two
losses in the first of five straight games
away from home, the Stanford men's
basketball team has a good chance to
pick up a road win tonight against
Arizona State here at the University Ac
tivity Center. The game begins at 6:30
PST.

The Sun Devils have not won a
Pacific 10 Conference game at home
this season, losing 61-51 to UCLA and
66-62 to USC. ASU follows ninth-place
USC in the conference standings; the
cellar-dwelling Sun Devils are 1-5 in
the league and 5-9 overall. ASU beat
Washington Sate 80-64 on the road last
week in its most recent game as guard
Steve Beck scored 25 points.
Beck is a player who gives Stanford
(10-7 overall, 4-4 and sixth place in the
Pac-10) trouble. Beck, who finished
tied for third in Pac-10 scoring with
Stanford's Todd Lichti last season,
scored 28 and 22 points against the
Cardinal in two games last year. The
senior is averaging 20.4 points per

game this season.
"He's not the same type of athlete as
a Sean Elliott or even a Kevin Johnson
(who scored 35 and 31 points for
Arizona and California, respectively,
against the Cardinal in Stanford's last
two road games)," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He's a very
strong player who will shoot the ball
and looks to score. We'll have to keep
him away from the basket, locate him

and minimize his shots."
"We have to locate Beck on the
perimeter," sophomore forward Lichti
said. "We have to give him a little more
attention and try not to give him any
open shots. We have to put a little
more pressure on him."
The real key to Beck's success,
however, is ASU point guard Arthur
Thomas, who is averaging 14.6 points
per game and leads the team with 41
assists. "Steve's even better with Arthur
Thomas playing," ASU Asst. Coach
Herb Livsey said. "Because Arthur is so
quick and penetrates so well, he gets
Steve open a lot."
According to Montgomery, Arizona
State is strong at the guard position. Ar

thur Thomas is very quick and creative;
he causes problems on penetration.
Bobby Thompson (8.5 points per
game) is the same type of player."
Although the Sun Devils have a

strong backcourt, the team is weak
inside with little size or experience.

Steve Beck shredded the Stanford defense for 50 points in two games last year
and is averaging more than 20 points per outing this season. The Cardinal's
Novian Whitsitt will most likely be called to slow the explosive Beck tonight.

Forward Todd Lichti will look to bolster the Cardinal's faltering inside game
against guard-dominated Arizona State. Lichti cleaned the boards for 10
caroms against California Saturday but could garner only four rebounds
against Arizona Monday.
