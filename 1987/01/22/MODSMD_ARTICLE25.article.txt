## Card in need of win at ASU 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
TEMPE, Ariz. â€” Following two
losses in the first of five straight games
away from home, the Stanford men's
basketball team has a good chance to
pick up a road win tonight against
Arizona State here at the University Ac
tivity Center. The game begins at 6:30
PST.

The Sun Devils have not won a
Pacific 10 Conference game at home
this season, losing 61-51 to UCLA and
66-62 to USC. ASU follows ninth-place
USC in the conference standings; the
cellar-dwelling Sun Devils are 1-5 in
the league and 5-9 overall. ASU beat
Washington Sate 80-64 on the road last
week in its most recent game as guard
Steve Beck scored 25 points.
Beck is a player who gives Stanford
(10-7 overall, 4-4 and sixth place in the
Pac-10) trouble. Beck, who finished
tied for third in Pac-10 scoring with
Stanford's Todd Lichti last season,
scored 28 and 22 points against the
Cardinal in two games last year. The
senior is averaging 20.4 points per

game this season.
"He's not the same type of athlete as
a Sean Elliott or even a Kevin Johnson
(who scored 35 and 31 points for
Arizona and California, respectively,
against the Cardinal in Stanford's last
two road games)," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He's a very
strong player who will shoot the ball
and looks to score. We'll have to keep
him away from the basket, locate him

and minimize his shots."
"We have to locate Beck on the
perimeter," sophomore forward Lichti
said. "We have to give him a little more
attention and try not to give him any
open shots. We have to put a little
more pressure on him."
The real key to Beck's success,
however, is ASU point guard Arthur
Thomas, who is averaging 14.6 points
per game and leads the team with 41
assists. "Steve's even better with Arthur
Thomas playing," ASU Asst. Coach
Herb Livsey said. "Because Arthur is so
quick and penetrates so well, he gets
Steve open a lot."
According to Montgomery, Arizona
State is strong at the guard position. Ar

thur Thomas is very quick and creative;
he causes problems on penetration.
Bobby Thompson (8.5 points per
game) is the same type of player."
Although the Sun Devils have a

strong backcourt, the team is weak
inside with little size or experience.

Steve Beck shredded the Stanford defense for 50 points in two games last year
and is averaging more than 20 points per outing this season. The Cardinal's
Novian Whitsitt will most likely be called to slow the explosive Beck tonight.

against guard-dominated Arizona State. Lichti cleaned the boards for 10
caroms against California Saturday but could garner only four rebounds
against Arizona Monday.
was a junior college transfer last year
and is averaging just 6.2 points per
game. Forward Alex Austin (7.5 points
per game) and Mark Carlino (5.4
points per game) are both sopho
mores, and Mark Becker (6.4 points
per game) is just a freshman.
"Their inside game is not real
strong," Lichti said. "It's not something
we feel we have to concentrate on or
put extra effort on defending."
"It's been a real struggle in that the
team is not producing well with the
inside game," Livsey said. "That puts a
lot of pressure on our backcourt,
which is really pretty good. The inside
guys really do work hard, but from a
coach's point of view, the inside game

just hasn't come around yet."
ASU has won just two games at home
so far this season. "It's frustrating, very
frustrating," Livsey said, "in that we've
played hard but beaten ourselves in
probably seven of our nine losses. In
some ways we've self-destructed."
The Sun Devil program has been
hurt recently because the team was
unable to recruit during the 1986
season after Pac-10 allegations of im
proprieties dealing with student
athlete transportation and summer
jobs. The new staff, under Head Coach
Steve Patterson, inherited the problem
last year and was unable to go off
campus to recruit or pay for recruiting
visits.
"We were not able to recruit a full
class," Livsey explained. "Fortunately,
we were able to recruit Becker. Mark,
being a freshman, has a long way to go,

and it will take him some time to learn
Mark had to be thrown to the dogs be
cause we had no one else
The Sun Devils, however, are com

ing off a win, whereas Stanford has lost
two in a row. The Cardinal also has had
problems inside of late, as sophomore
center Howard Wright has been

playing tentatively and Lichti had just
four rebounds in the " 7 7- 7 0 loss at
Arizona Monday "We have got to
board better, Montgomery said. "The
boards really hurt us against Arizona '
"We've been playing hard, ' Lichti
said. "Vie haven't played well, but
we've still been in some games
There's obviously room for improve
ment. Hopefully things will turn
around."'
Lichti (18.0 points per game) is the
man ASI will be watching most care
fully. It would be Lichti we're most
concerned with, Livsey said, "but with
a Mike Montgomery-coached team,
you are playing a team, and I think
Stanford represents that well. We really
have to prepare more for a team rather
than an individual, but with Todd's
outside shooting, you have to know
where he is on the floor.
