# Mustangs pummel grapplers
## 
### 
After winning a dual meet and a
tournament last weekend, the Stanford
wrestling team had reason to be opti
mistic heading to Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo for a meet with the Mustangs
last night.
Any optimism was shattered quickly,
however, as Cal Poly hammered the
Cardinal wrestlers 30-14 to drop Stan
ford to 3-5-1 on the season.
"We had a chance to beat them if our
lightweights pulled off some upsets
and our heavyweights did a really good
job," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
said.
The heavyweights kept up their end
of the bargain, but the lightweights
came up short. Stanford forfeited at
118 and lost the 126-, 134- and 142-
pound matches. Scott Wiggen defeated
Lance Cowart 7-3 at 150, but the Card
inal lost at 158 and had to forfeit at 167.
Stanford's Ron Perry decisioned
Gabe Cortina at 177, Terry Mclntyre
won by a fall over Rick Ravalin in 4:25
at 190 and heavyweight Kurt Kassulke
tied his match.

Vienna as she upset USC's No. 3 player, Mary Norwood, 6-2, 6-3 in Pacific Palisades.
