# Stanford women have eyes set on 3rd place
## Eighth-place Sun Devils visit Maples 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Currently in a tie for fourth place in
the Pacific 10 Conference, the Stanford
women's basketball team could and
should move up in the standings this
weekend as the Cardinal hosts its
easiest homestand of the season,
beginning tonight with a 7:30 game
against Arizona State.
Stanford, 9-6 overall and 3-2 in the
Pac-10, is just one-and-a-half games be

these two teams," Stanford center Jill
Yanke said.
Yanke stressed that the Cardinal
must take advantage of its home
games. "There's this thing we have that
you should win your home games and
split on the road," the 6-foot-5 sopho
more said.
Stanford won its last home game
convincingly, burying California 77-S9
last Saturday night to break an eight
game losing streak to the Bears. In that
game, freshman standout Katy Steding

hind league-leading USC. The Card
inals remaining four games in the first
half of the Pac-10 season are against
teams that are in the lower half of the
standings.
ASU is in eighth place in the confer
ence at 2-4 Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion the Cardinal hosts Arizona,
which is 1-5 and in ninth place.
"We definitely are capable of beating

led the Cardinal once again, scoring 23
points and grabbing eight rebounds.
Forward Kami Anderson added 14
points, guards Jennifer Azzi and Erica
Mueser had 13 and 11. respectively,
and Yanke tossed in 10 points.
The victory over Cal not only moved
the Cardinal into fourth place in the
Pac-10, but it also boosted the team's
confidence for the rest of the season. "1

think it's finally gotten into our head
that we have a chance to go to the
NCAAs," Yanke said. "We've heard
rumors that they might take four teams
from the Pac-10."
A weekend sweep of the Ari/.ona
schools could not hurt Stanford's
chances of qualifying for postseason
play. But in order to accomplish this
feat, the Cardinal must first tonight
beat ASU, a team whose 2-4 Pac-10
record may he somewhat misleading.
The Sun Devils took a pair of confer
ence games from Washington State and
Washington last weekend at home to
move out of the Pac-10 cellar. They
defeated the Cougars 95-83 in
overtime and then dropped the
Huskies out of first place with a 78-64
victory.
Most of ASU's scoring tonight figures
to come from its potent forward tan
dem. Sherry Poole averages 18.1 points
per game this season and is coming off
a career-high 32-point performance in
the win over Washington. Robin Con
nolly is averaging 15.6 points per game
and was equally impressive against the
Washington schools — 30 points
against the Cougars and a triple-double
against the Huskies (16 points, 10
rebounds and 15 assists).
Though the Sun Devils are near the
bottom of the conference standings,
Yanke indicated that any team in the
Pac-10 is capable of beating the other
teams. "It's pretty much balanced. Last
year USC had Cheryl Miller," Yanke
said, noting that this season there is no

clear standout. "There's been a lot of
inconsistent play this year."
The Stanford freshmen have been
surprisingly consistent, however, and
have been a big factor in the team's
success this season. Steding is leading
the Cardinal in rebounding at 8.0 per
game and is second in scoring (11.3
average) behind Anderson. Her 23-

point performance against Cal was a
career high.
Azzi has been electrifying at point
guard this season. She recorded the
first triple-double in Stanford history
last Thursday against Brigham Young,
scoring a career-high 14 points, grab
bing a team-high 10 rebounds and
passing for a school-record 16 assists.

Despite being Stanford's shortest starter at 5-foot-6, senior Erica Mueser is
tied for third on the first unit in rebounding with 3.7 per game. She also
chips in 9.9 points per outing.

from the Pac-10."
A weekend sweep of the Ari/.ona
schools could not hurt Stanford's
chances of qualifying for postseason
play. But in order to accomplish this
feat, the Cardinal must first tonight
beat ASU, a team whose 2-4 Pac-10
record may he somewhat misleading.
The Sun Devils took a pair of confer
ence games from Washington State and
Washington last weekend at home to
move out of the Pac-10 cellar. They
defeated the Cougars 95-83 in
overtime and then dropped the
Huskies out of first place with a 78-64
victory.
Most of ASU's scoring tonight figures
to come from its potent forward tan
dem. Sherry Poole averages 18.1 points
per game this season and is coming off
a career-high 32-point performance in
the win over Washington. Robin Con
nolly is averaging 15.6 points per game
and was equally impressive against the
Washington schools — 30 points
against the Cougars and a triple-double
against the Huskies (16 points, 10
rebounds and 15 assists).
Though the Sun Devils are near the
bottom of the conference standings,
Yanke indicated that any team in the
Pac-10 is capable of beating the other
teams. "It's pretty much balanced. Last
year USC had Cheryl Miller," Yanke
said, noting that this season there is no

clear standout. "There's been a lot of
inconsistent play this year."
The Stanford freshmen have been
surprisingly consistent, however, and
have been a big factor in the team's
success this season. Steding is leading
the Cardinal in rebounding at 8.0 per
game and is second in scoring (11.3
average) behind Anderson. Her 23-

point performance against Cal was a
career high.
Azzi has been electrifying at point
guard this season. She recorded the
first triple-double in Stanford history
last Thursday against Brigham Young,
scoring a career-high 14 points, grab
bing a team-high 10 rebounds and
passing for a school-record 16 assists.

Despite being Stanford's shortest starter at 5-foot-6, senior Erica Mueser is
tied for third on the first unit in rebounding with 3.7 per game. She also
chips in 9.9 points per outing.
Currently in a tie for fourth place in
the Pacific 10 Conference, the Stanford
women's basketball team could and
should move up in the standings this
weekend as the Cardinal hosts its
easiest homestand of the season,
beginning tonight with a 7:30 game
against Arizona State.
Stanford, 9-6 overall and 3-2 in the
Pac-10, is just one-and-a-half games be

these two teams," Stanford center Jill
Yanke said.
Yanke stressed that the Cardinal
must take advantage of its home
games. "There's this thing we have that
you should win your home games and
split on the road," the 6-foot-5 sopho
more said.
Stanford won its last home game
convincingly, burying California 77-S9
last Saturday night to break an eight
game losing streak to the Bears. In that
game, freshman standout Katy Steding

hind league-leading USC. The Card
inals remaining four games in the first
half of the Pac-10 season are against
teams that are in the lower half of the
standings.
ASU is in eighth place in the confer
ence at 2-4 Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion the Cardinal hosts Arizona,
which is 1-5 and in ninth place.
"We definitely are capable of beating

led the Cardinal once again, scoring 23
points and grabbing eight rebounds.
Forward Kami Anderson added 14
points, guards Jennifer Azzi and Erica
Mueser had 13 and 11. respectively,
and Yanke tossed in 10 points.
The victory over Cal not only moved
the Cardinal into fourth place in the
Pac-10, but it also boosted the team's
confidence for the rest of the season. "1

think it's finally gotten into our head
that we have a chance to go to the
NCAAs," Yanke said. "We've heard
rumors that they might take four teams
from the Pac-10."
