# Hurlburt accounts for damages
## 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
Several students have voluntarily accepted finan
cial responsibility for the estimated $1,000 worth of
damages caused by vandals in Hurlburt last Thursday
night.
In the other house damaged that night, 553
Mayfield, no one has claimed responsibility for the
estimated $600-700 worth of damages.
It is not known yet whether the two incidents are
related.
"The group involved Thursday night will pay for
all damages. That was their decision. The group han
dled this extremely well and realized the severity of
the problem," said Annie Jenny, resident asistant in
Hurlburt.
Jenny would not release the names of those stu
dents who assumed responsibility for Hurlburt's
repair bills.
The same night the two houses were damaged,
several fights broke ourt on the Row, and a group of
males repeatedly yelled "give us our house back"
while they stood outside of 553, the former house of

the now-unrecognized Delta Upsilon fraternity.
The University is currently investigating the inci
dents, said Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons. "If
behavior is as reported, it's intolerable," he added.
Consequences for similar problems, which have
occurred in the past, have "ranged from suspension
from housing to suspension from the University to all
kinds of things in between," said Lyons.
"There are always damages of one sort or another,
but this seems to be a little more spectacular than
most," said Lyons. "It's not the cost — it's the nature
of the damages and the nature of the behavior that
caused it that is really of concern to the students that
live in those houses. They really shouldn't have to
put up with it."
Once the University receives the reports on what
happened, there are two basic approaches it can take
to reprimand the students involved, said Associate
Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson. Either the
incidents will be considered a contractual violation
of the resident agreement or a judicial violation of
the Fundamental Standard.
If the students are found to have violated their resi
dent agreement, they could be removed from their

house and from all University residences. If the acts
are considered a violation of the Fundamental Stan
dard, they will be dealt with by the Office of Judicial
Affairs.
"If we find who did it... something will happen,"
said Robinson. "It certainly will not be ignored.
There will be consequences for those individuals in
volved."
According to Lyons: "It's still early. It takes time to
collect information. We're really careful about get
ting factual information. There's not a tendency to
move precipitously. There's a tendency to move
deliberately — and that takes time." The information
might not be known for several days, he added.
Damages in 553 included an irreparable drinking
fountain and a large mess inside a bathroom, said
Lucy Williams, facilities manager for How and Cluster
Houses. In Hurlburt, she added, the damage bill in
cluded expenses for a pulled fire alarm, broken fire
boxes, holes in the wall, a broken screen and hand
rail, and trash strewn about the dorm.
In a self-operated house, such as Hurlburt and 553,
