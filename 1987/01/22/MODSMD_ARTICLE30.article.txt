Three seeded players were ousted, and one
withdrew from the tournament, but not all went
haywire yesterday during the first day of the
Women's Intercollegiate Invitational tennis tourn
ament at Pacific Palisades.
Top-ranked Stanford advanced four singles
players to today's third round and three doubles
teams to the second round.
Junior Cari Hagey led the Cardinal with a 6-2, 6-
3 upset of sixth-seeded Mary Norwood of USC in
second-round singles action. Earlier in the day,
Hagey had defeated Houston's Stina Almgren 6-0,
6-2.
"That was a little surprise," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said of Hagey's upset. "Cari played
a couple of steady matches."
Hagey played No. 6 singles for the Cardinal last
year, while Norwood played No. 3 for the Trojans.
Top-seeded Patty Fendick also easily advanced
to today's third round with a pair of 6-2, 6-1 vic
tories. Fendick, coming off a tournament champi
onship at Cathedral City Jan. 4, defeated Long
Beach State's Havaja Frljuckic in the first round
and Pepperdine freshman Carrie Crisell in the
second round.
"Patty played a pretty good first match and

really a great second match," Brennan said. "She
looked good."
While Hagey and Fendick were never threat
ened in their matches, teammate Stephanie
Savides did a high-wire act throughout the first
day of competition. After outlasting Arizona's
Chris SeifFert 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-4 in the first round,
Savides barely survived a three-setter against
UCLA's Catherine O'Meara.
"Stephanie had a tough win over Seiffert and a
very tough win over O'Meara," Brennan said.
For a while, the second match didn't figure to
be tough at all â€” O'Meara looked like she was
going to walk away with it. After losing the first set
6-0, Savides took the second 6-3, and then the two
engaged in a life-and-death tiebreaker. Both
survived match points before Savides won the tie
breaker 9-7.
Stanford freshman Lisa Green also advanced to
the third round with a pair of victories yesterday.
Green, seeded No. 6 in the tournament, defeated
UCLA's Maria LaFranchi 6-4, 6-4 and then went
three sets to beat USC's Anya KochofF 6-4, 6-7 (4-
7), 6-3.
Brennan said Green is handling her No. 6
seeding well, though she did not play all that well
