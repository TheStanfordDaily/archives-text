### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Three seeded players were ousted, and one
withdrew from the tournament, but not all went
haywire yesterday during the first day of the
Women's Intercollegiate Invitational tennis tourn
ament at Pacific Palisades.
Top-ranked Stanford advanced four singles
players to today's third round and three doubles
teams to the second round.
Junior Cari Hagey led the Cardinal with a 6-2, 6-
3 upset of sixth-seeded Mary Norwood of USC in
second-round singles action. Earlier in the day,
Hagey had defeated Houston's Stina Almgren 6-0,
6-2.
"That was a little surprise," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said of Hagey's upset. "Cari played
a couple of steady matches."
Hagey played No. 6 singles for the Cardinal last
year, while Norwood played No. 3 for the Trojans.
Top-seeded Patty Fendick also easily advanced
to today's third round with a pair of 6-2, 6-1 vic
tories. Fendick, coming off a tournament champi
onship at Cathedral City Jan. 4, defeated Long
Beach State's Havaja Frljuckic in the first round
and Pepperdine freshman Carrie Crisell in the
second round.
"Patty played a pretty good first match and

really a great second match," Brennan said. "She
looked good."
While Hagey and Fendick were never threat
ened in their matches, teammate Stephanie
Savides did a high-wire act throughout the first
day of competition. After outlasting Arizona's
Chris SeifFert 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-4 in the first round,
Savides barely survived a three-setter against
UCLA's Catherine O'Meara.
"Stephanie had a tough win over Seiffert and a
very tough win over O'Meara," Brennan said.
For a while, the second match didn't figure to
be tough at all — O'Meara looked like she was
going to walk away with it. After losing the first set
6-0, Savides took the second 6-3, and then the two
engaged in a life-and-death tiebreaker. Both
survived match points before Savides won the tie
breaker 9-7.
Stanford freshman Lisa Green also advanced to
the third round with a pair of victories yesterday.
Green, seeded No. 6 in the tournament, defeated
UCLA's Maria LaFranchi 6-4, 6-4 and then went
three sets to beat USC's Anya KochofF 6-4, 6-7 (4-
7), 6-3.
Brennan said Green is handling her No. 6
seeding well, though she did not play all that well
yesterday. "She didn't play great
today," Brennan said. "She was a litde
sloppy in the second match. I even
went out and yelled at her to try to get
focused. She wasn't coming in (to the
net) to close out points."
Even Stanford's only singles loss of
the day had some promising aspects.
Kay Tittle drew UCLA's Jane Thomas —
the No. 5 seed and the Bruins' top
singles player — in the first round and
took her to three sets before losing 6-7
(7-9), 7-5,6-3.
"Kay had some chances," Brennan
said. "She played very well. Thomas is
the No. 1 player at UCLA, and I thought
that was a good showing."
All three Stanford doubles teams tri
umphed in the first round yesterday.
Fendick and Savides, seeded third in
the tournament, swept UC-Santa Bar
bara's Jan Sanford and Liz Casta 6-4,6-4
to advance to today's second round.
Green and Tittle also advanced with
a 6-4, 6-3 victory over San Jase State's
Shelly Stockman and Julie Clark. Hagey
and freshman Valerie Wilson won in
straight sets.
Though the Cardinal was successful
during the first day, many of the seeds
were knocked out yesterday. USC's
Caroline Kuhlman, the No. 2 singles
seed, didn't even make it to the first
round. The talented junior pulled out
of the tournament due to a knee injury.

"Her coach feels it's too many
matches," Brennan said.
In addition to Norwood, Thomas
and eighth-seeded Anne Moeller of
San Diego State also lost yesterday.

Thomas lost her second round match
to UCSB's Lori Jonas 6-4, 6-4. Moeller
was upset 7-5, 7-5 by the University of
San Diego's Aby Brayton.
Stanford will see several familiar

faces in today's third round of singles.
Savides will be up against USC's Maeve
Quinlan, whom she beat last season
when the two teams faced each other
at Stanford.

easier yesterday when she not only won her first two matches but also learned that second-seeded Caroline Kuhlman
