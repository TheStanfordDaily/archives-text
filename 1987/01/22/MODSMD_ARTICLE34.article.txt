# Speaker: SDI spurs Soviet science
## 
### CALISA COLE 
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's in
itiatives to promote scientific research in
the Soviet Union indicate the growing ten
sion caused by the Star Wars challenge, a
Soviet scholar said here yesterday.
The Soviet leadership has claimed it will
not follow America's lead in developing
Strategic Defense Initiative-related technol
ogies. But there are indications that the
Soviets are taking measures to meet the
challenge, said Mark Kuchment, a visiting
scholar at Harvard University's Russian Re
search Center.
For example, Kuchment said, the newly
appointed president of the Soviet Academy
of Sciences is a computer science specialist.
Traditionally, the expertise of the president
is a good indicator of future developments
in Soviet science. During the atomic age,
the president was a physicist, Kuchment
said. During the space years, a space expert
was elected.
High technology will be emphasized in
future scientific research, Kuchment said.

"The creation of a supercomputer is a
priority.''
Soviet leaders are worried about SDI
technology because it is unprecendented,
unpredictable and enormously large and
costly, he said. Also, it touches on areas in
which Soviet scientists are not strong, such
as quantum physics and computer science.
During the 1980s, due to increased ex
port restrictions, it has been difficult for the
Soviets illegally to obtain Western technol
ogy, Kuchment added. "Now they are trying
to rely more on native (computer) desig
ners."
To promote technological progress, Gor
bachev has taken measures that include the
creation of an official office of technology
and the formation of a state quality control
board. The latter is considered a tough
reform in a society where competition and
market forces do not influence the quality
of produced goods, Kuchment said. The
traditional goal of factory managers and
workers has been quantity, not quality.
Kuchment said accelerating scientific re
search has been one of Gorbachev's pri
mary' goals since the Soviet leader took of

fice nearly two years ago. Kuchment men
tioned the recent release of physicist Andrei
Sakharov from exile in the town of Gorky as
one example of Gorbachev's desire to
mobilize the scientific community.
Gorbachev has stated that scientific re
search is a key to technological progress
and the backbone of military strength,
Kuchment said. Also Gorbachev views tech
nological progress as a way to strengthen
the hand of the Soviet Union in the Third
World by attracting students to study at So
viet universities.
Kuchment said there is a "tragic trend' in
Russian history. "Usually, when a country
wins a war, the sitatuion becomes more
relaxed within that country." For the Soviet
Union, however, a victorious war has tradi
tionally resulted in a "tightening of the gov
ernment's grip on the people."
But, when Soviets face a "sad thing," such
as losing a war, it can serve as an impetus
for internal reforms, Kuchment said.
Kuchment suggested that if the Soviet Un
ion perceived the SDI challenge as a "sad
thing," then Soviet leaders might use it to
push for radical internal reforms.
