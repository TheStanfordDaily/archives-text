The recent isolation of a human
gene involved in the destruction of
foreign material in the body may lead
to breakthroughs in preventing rejec
tion of transplanted organs and pro
vide a new understanding of such
diseases as diabetes, multiple sclerosis
and rheumatoid arthritis, according to
a Stanford Medical School professor.
Pathology Prof. Irving Weissman iso
lated a gene present in the body's
"killer cells" that will allow scientists to
locate and ultimately block these
diseases' actions. Previously, the gene

had only been detected in mice.
Through Weissman's research, sci
entists are beginning to understand
what killer cells — cells that attack all
foreign material in the body, including
transplanted organs — really do.
"We are now trying to find what kind
of reactions depend on killer cells,"
said Weissman. "If we can find a very
specific inhibitor, we may be able to
block the reaction. Blocking the killing
genes might allow transplants to
succeed, but that is way downstream."
Weissman's current research is
focused on making an antibody or in
hibitor to the killer cells by studying
their structure. Already, he has defined

the sequence of the gene from a
human cell and has discovered the
chromosome the gene is located on.
"Using the gene itself, we are
looking at tissue in an animal model,
especially transplant rejections, and we
have found quantities of the gene
there," said Weissman.
The way a killer cell destroys an
other cell can be seen by observing a
test tube of killer cells placed with tar
get cells, such as cancer cells, accord
ing to Weissman.
Each killer cell has a granule of the
gene Weissman discovered. During the
killing process, the granule moves
from the killer cell to the target cell

and releases proteins that cut a hole in
the target cell's membrane. When all of
the contents leak out of the target cell,
it dies, Weissman said.
Weissman discovered that the gene,
inactive in normal cells, was active in
killer cells, leading to the hypothesis
that the gene, and the protein associ
ated with the gene, may be involved in
killing cells.
The gene itself codes for a common
type of protein called serine protease.
The body uses serine protease to cut
proteins into smaller units. Another lab
in Canada has identified two more
