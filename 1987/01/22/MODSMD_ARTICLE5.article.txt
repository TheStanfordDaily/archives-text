# USW member Hill reinstated
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
An arbitrator has reinstated former
service worker Victor Hill, discharged
in 1985 for vandalism, and has ruled
that the University must renumerate
Hill for 15 months worth of back pay
and benefits, a sum estimated at
$25,000 by union officials.
Arbitrator Armon Barsamian deter
mined that the University did not have
sufficient evidence to fire Hill, who
had alledgedly slashed the tires of his
supervisor's car.
Hill said he plans to return as soon
as possible to his previous position as a
shipping and receiving worker.
Priscilla Wheeler, University staff
counsel, said the University "disagrees
with the decision, but we will abide by
the collective bargaining agreement,
and Victor Hill will be reinstated."
The University will not exercise its
right to appeal the decision, Wheeler
said.
A member of United Stanford
Workers (USW), which represents ser
vice and technical workers here, Hill
was fired position during series of
heated contract negotiations between
the union apd the University.
On Oct. 11,1985, at 10 a.m., Hill and
a co-worker, Mardlena Broussard,
were discovered by Hill's supervisor,
Hector Allen, in the vicinity of Allen's
car soon after its tires were slashed.
Allen made a citizen's arrest of Hill,
but the police did not find any in
criminating fingerprints or instru
ments, which might have linked Hill to
tire slashing.
A criminal complaint for vandalism
against Hill was issued but later dis
missed by die district attorney due to
lack of evidence.
According to Wheeler, the University
discharged Hill because he was in the
parking lot 20 seconds after Allen's
tires were slashed and because Hill,
whom the University questioned three
times, changed his account of the inci
dent from one interview to the next.
The arbitrator, however, determined
that the University's evidence was cir

cumstantial and that Hill had a
legitimate reason for being in the
parking lot as he was en route to a reg
ular appointment with a chiropractor.
According to Wheeler, the arbitrator
was too stria in his evaluation of Stan
ford's evidence. The arbitrator wanted
the equivalent of a picture as evidence,
she said.
There are different theories in the
field of arbitration regarding what
should be considered acceptable

evidence in arbitration cases, accord
ing to Law Prof. William B. Gould, an
expert in labor relations law.
Some follow the legal definition,
which requires that a case be proved
"beyond a reasonable doubt," Gould
said.
Other arbitrators don't require this
stria standard and only ask for "clear
and convincing" evidence or "a
preponderance of evidence in the
record," Gould said.
The more lenient arbitrators believe
that labor cases cannot be compared to
criminal cases since a "criminal convic
tion is the worst thing that can happen
to a person," Gould said.
In his summary of the case, the ar-


Priscilla Wheeler
University staff counsel
bitrator said "Stanford has not shown that (Hill)
was involved in any group effort to vandalize Al
len's tires, nor has it shown that he personally
vandalized one or more tires. Accordingly, the
grievance is sustained."
According to USW Staff Counsel Mary Ann
Tenuto, the most important piece of evidence in
the case was an experiment conducted by the De
partment of Public Safety, which showed that Hill
could not have flattened Allen's tires during the
short period he was in the parking lot.
Tenuto criticized the University investigation as
inadequate.
When the job of an employee is at stake, the
University should conduct a much more careful
investigation of the incident, she said.
After the tire test, which convinced the district
attorney not to press charges, the University
should have been open to some kind of settle
ment, she added.
"The Legal Office blindly backs up manager's
decisions about firing workers, no matter how
wrong or outrageous those decisions. We believe
it is time to re-evaluate that policy and to stop it!"
Tenuto wrote in a USW newsletter.
Hill said his dismissal demonstrates the Univer
sity's prejudice. "They fired me on the basis of
one man's word. It screwed up my entire life."

Hill said he could not find work after his dis
missal because the University "blacklisted" him
and gave his potential employers bad job refer
ences.
After Hill's firing, the University removed Hill's
family from its dental plan even though Hill's wife
works at the University. The University later cor
rected the error.
Hill called for the dismissal of both Allen and
the administrator who conducted Stanford's in
vestigation, Felix Barthelemy, manager of Univer
sity Employee Relations.
Though Hill said he was pleased with the deci
sion, he noted that the University still has not
compensated Broussard for her dismissal. Brous
sard was not a USW member at the time of her
dismissal and is not eligible to submit her case for
arbitration.
"If the arbitration found me innocent, it would
have found her innocent too," Hill said.
Hill credited the union with saving his job and
said he always will be "a strong union man."
In addition to criticizing the University's inves
tigation of the case, Tenuto said the length of the
arbitration was unacceptable.
"A basic premise in the U.S. Constitution is
that we, as citizens, are entitled to a speedy trial.
Victor Hill's trial was not speedy.... The Legal Of
fice delayed the scheduling of this arbitration
much too long by an unwillingness to settle and
delays in scheduling. No one should have to wait
15 months for reinstatement to their job," Tenuto
said in a release.
