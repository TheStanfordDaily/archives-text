# USW member Hill reinstated
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Senior staff writer 
An arbitrator has reinstated former
service worker Victor Hill, discharged
in 1985 for vandalism, and has ruled
that the University must renumerate
Hill for 15 months worth of back pay
and benefits, a sum estimated at
$25,000 by union officials.
Arbitrator Armon Barsamian deter
mined that the University did not have
sufficient evidence to fire Hill, who
had alledgedly slashed the tires of his
supervisor's car.
Hill said he plans to return as soon
as possible to his previous position as a
shipping and receiving worker.
Priscilla Wheeler, University staff
counsel, said the University "disagrees
with the decision, but we will abide by
the collective bargaining agreement,
and Victor Hill will be reinstated."
The University will not exercise its
right to appeal the decision, Wheeler
said.
A member of United Stanford
Workers (USW), which represents ser
vice and technical workers here, Hill
was fired position during series of
heated contract negotiations between
the union apd the University.
On Oct. 11,1985, at 10 a.m., Hill and
a co-worker, Mardlena Broussard,
were discovered by Hill's supervisor,
Hector Allen, in the vicinity of Allen's
car soon after its tires were slashed.
Allen made a citizen's arrest of Hill,
but the police did not find any in
criminating fingerprints or instru
ments, which might have linked Hill to
tire slashing.
A criminal complaint for vandalism
against Hill was issued but later dis
missed by die district attorney due to
lack of evidence.
According to Wheeler, the University
discharged Hill because he was in the
parking lot 20 seconds after Allen's
tires were slashed and because Hill,
whom the University questioned three
times, changed his account of the inci
dent from one interview to the next.
The arbitrator, however, determined
that the University's evidence was cir

cumstantial and that Hill had a
legitimate reason for being in the
parking lot as he was en route to a reg
ular appointment with a chiropractor.
According to Wheeler, the arbitrator
was too stria in his evaluation of Stan
ford's evidence. The arbitrator wanted
the equivalent of a picture as evidence,
she said.
There are different theories in the
field of arbitration regarding what
should be considered acceptable

evidence in arbitration cases, accord
ing to Law Prof. William B. Gould, an
expert in labor relations law.
Some follow the legal definition,
which requires that a case be proved
"beyond a reasonable doubt," Gould
said.
Other arbitrators don't require this
stria standard and only ask for "clear
and convincing" evidence or "a
preponderance of evidence in the
record," Gould said.
The more lenient arbitrators believe
that labor cases cannot be compared to
criminal cases since a "criminal convic
tion is the worst thing that can happen
to a person," Gould said.
In his summary of the case, the ar-
