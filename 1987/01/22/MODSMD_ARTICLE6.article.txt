# Resident fellows: What are they?
## 
### KACEY FITZPATRICK 
"What's an RF?" queries clueless
Karl Frosh. "What do they do, and
why do they live in the dorm?"
Residential Education employs
University professors as RFs not to
profess the truth and virtue of quan
tum equations, but to foster the per
sonal interaction between mentor
and student.
Formally, the RFs are described
as "members of the teaching staff
who live in student residences and
serve as the educational and intel
lectual leaders of the house." Resi
dent assistants implement the sug
gestions of RFs, and, eventually, stu
dents see the results of their RFs'
decisions.
"Resident fellows coordinate all
aspects of dorm activity," said Robin
Hensley, program coordinator for
Residential Education. "They bring

in different colleagues and faculty
members, they counsel on behavior
problems, they teach courses in the
houses."
Some RFs feel programming is
the most rewarding aspect of their
job. "The number of creative
thoughts that come out and the pro
grams we've developed are stagger
ing. We like to see the activity, and
we thrive on the energy here," said
Ray Sims, RF at Florence Moore
East.
"Resident fellows really set the
tone," agreed Alice Supton, assis
tant dean of Residential Education.
"RFs are crucial to the kind of edu
cation that can happen in a house. It
makes a difference if RFs see the
house as a place to hang out or a
place to talk important matters.
"For example, how is life in Cali
fornia versus life on the east coast?;
should undergraduate education leave
you employable in a specific field or
educated broadly?; in what direction is
the university heading?' It's important
that people can have these conversa
tions in the dorm," she said.
"Resident fellows in general are
people who want to share their inter
ests, whatever they may be," Supton
continued. "Resident fellows are open,
friendly, warm, approachable, ener
getic and animated."
The secret of being a g(x>d RF is
charisma, according to Gregson
Davis, who, with his wife Daphne, is
the Toyon RF. "You have to enjoy
being with people, and if you don't en
joy it, there's nothing to be done."
Students say they appreciate the RFs'
interest in dorm life. Freshman Andrea
Kohn said:"They're here, and they're
like parent figures, but they're not
stern, you're not scared of them.
They're not going to scream at you for
something you did or didn't do."
"He's always there for us if we need
help," said freshman Rachel Meyer of
Otero RF Dennis Mathies. "He's con
cerned with what we're doing, and he's
pushing us to do more, in a positive
way. He participates in all dorm activi
ties; you can really feel that he cares
about what's going on."
"He's someone I can go to for ad
vice," said Mirlo RA Ruth Hammerton-
Kelly of RF Bill Ramsey. "He also pro
vides a powerful liaison between stu
dents and the administration. Having a
professor in the dorm shows that they
are interested in us; it breaks down
barriers and shows students they can
approach a prof. It breaks down the
whole aura of when you go into a
lecture and there's a 'professor' up
there."
There are also a few rotten apples in
the barrel, according to RA Bob
Barcklay. "How students perceive
them depends on their own RF and the
dorm they live in. I know their are RFs
who do everything, but in other
dorms, the RF is hardly even known by
the people who live there."
Speaking for the dissenting faction,
freshman Barcy Fisher said, "As far as
my perception and experience is con

cerned with resident fellows, the
image the University transposes on
them as important is a fallacy. There's
no effort to communicate and reach
out on the part of certain RFs; they do
not enjoy interaction with others."
Overall, however, "RFs provide
stability and continuity in the dorm,"
said Faisan RA David Johanson. "They
are the kingpins of the dorm. Actually,
they really do add a lot.
"I went to Columbia University as a
frosh," he added. "The dorms were
really cold, there was nothing like a
resident fellow and nothing like the
family' atmosphere which you can find
here. At Columbia, dorms were just a
place where you slept. At Stanford, RFs
are a vital pan of die community."
Many people may well wonder why
sensible adults would want to live in a
house full of often boisterous and
noisy students, and subject themselves

and their family to the horrors, dis
asters and lousy food of dorm life.
"This is the first time in my life that
I've had this number of people that I
can just depend on completely," said
first-year Donner RF Linda Paulson.
"They'll bust their butts for people,
and they accomplish a lot," said Bran
ner RF Kennell Jackson. "We've had
some of the best times together."
The students make it worthwhile,
too, according to the RFs. Paulson told
this story: "At the end of the first party
during Orientation week, the dorm
was a complete mess. Then students

just began to clean up. It was immac
ulate. The RAs were all flabbergasted
that students did that without even
being asked. They stood there and just
asked, How did this happen?' "
When Paulson began as an RF this
year, "I may have expected weekly dis
asters, and there just hasn't been. What
I find difficult is that I could easily
spend too much time with the stu
dents. It's very seductive when they all
want to talk to me about Western Cul
ture. I would much rather talk about
Virgil than grade a stack of papers," she
said.
"I find it very fascinating to see this
close up the freshman in a college like
Stanford," said Jackson. "I meet all the
time students who 1 think are really
remarkable — even people 1 don't
'agree with. Getting a sense of the
flavor of human character is a great
thing.

'Being an RF
makes you have to
think about and
reach inside your
self to bring out
the best. It's a chal
lenge of character.'

"I have good times, too. I hear funny
stories," he recalled. "There was a guy
here who decided he was in a rut. So
he was going to have a 'reach-out'
week. He slept around everywhere
with different people: one night on the
balcony, a couple nights on top of the
Coke machine. If you think about the
pretensions of 'reach out' as associated
with the telephone, churches, etc. —
it's really funny. People are committed
to idiosynchratic ideas. That's lively."
Jackson has been an RF for six years.
"Most people think the real struggle in
being an RF is the time commitment. I

don't. It's a part of my life. It taxes the
skills of communication and exchange.
It is a positive struggle. Being an RF
makes you have to think about and
reach inside yourself to bring out the
best. It's a challenge of character."
The Davises find one frustration in
getting people to attend programs.
"Deep down you know that if you
could just herd them into the room,
they'd really enjoy it," Daphne said.
"I stress the position of RF as one of
privilege," said Daphne. "We watch a
person grow and change from their
freshman to senior year, not only in
the way they carry themselves, but in
their changing ideas and attitudes
toward things."
"A typical problem that we have to
deal with is individual students who
haven't learned to be part of a commu
nity," Gregson said. "They have a hard
time sharing and realizing that they
must make compromises, be aware of
others' needs and learn to live with dif
ferences in other people. Roommate
harmony/conflict is interesting. People

feel stuck because they had no choice."
The Davises have a son, Oliver, who
is four years old. As far as raising
children in the dorm, Gregson said,
"The good outweighs the dis
advantages. Your children become
gregarious, not shy; they develop great
social skills and feel perfectly at home
with strangers. We have a nice pool of
babysitters!"
Brian Robinson, son of RF Rob Rob
inson in Lagunita West, has taken part
in dorm life fir the past 12 years. Now
he is 17 and will be going to college
somewhere else next year. "The kids
here have always been like older
brothers and sisters to me. Now that
I'm more their own age, it's a bit more
awkward. Living in a dorm is normal to
me; I don't know how it would be to
live in a real home."
"We were offered Florence Moore,
and I was scared to death," said Phyllis
Ramsey, who is an RF with her hus
band Bill. "All our friends had warned
us to stay clear of freshman dorms, and
to preferably stay in a small house of

50 students, where we could really
have intimate contact with all the stu
dents."
Flo Mo has 454 students, divided be
tween four RFs and one of the largest
residence staffs on campus, including
21 RAs. There are three all-frosh
houses and four four-class houses.
"Frosh do have peculiar problems,"
said Bill. "We like being associated
with all the classes. They have the op
portunity to interact here, and it seems
to provide a more realistic living situa
tion. Many other dorms have a hard
time fathoming what we do in such a
large house. We do get to know a large
percentage of the students fairly well,
and we like the fact that there is some
thing going on every night here. Our
experience as RFs has been very
rewarding."
The Ramseys said that the most time
consuming task of the year is choosing
their RAs every spring for the next
year. They read 200 applications last
year and did half-hour interviews for
75-100 prospective RAs.
