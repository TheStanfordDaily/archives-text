# SIG offering 5 new paid internships in Sacramento
## 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Students will have the opportunity to spend
this summer in Sacramento working in the ex
ecutive and legislative branches of the state
government under a new Stanford-In-
Government (SIG) program that grants five
$1,000 government internships and additional
unpaid positions to anv students deemed eligi
ble
The internships will expose students to re
search opportunities, administrative responsi
bilities and letter constituent service, according
to Michael Bunzel, executive director for
Stanford-In-Sacramento, the susidiarv of SIG

that oversees the Sacramento internship pro
gram. "People who want to view state govern
ment up close, can't afford to go to Washington
or would like to be with a smaller group of
people" will be attracted to the program, he
added.
SIG will choose the five most qualified appli
cants for the $1,000 awards and will play a more
active role in the Sacramento program than in
the Washington internships. Saying that "very
few students have gone there," Bunzel said can
didates will apply for positions through SIG
rather than to individual employers Interns in
the Washington program deal directly with
employers.
The $1,000 is sufficient to cover interns' ex

penses for the summer, according to Bunzel.
"It costs $230 a month to live in Sacramento,"
he noted. "As opposed to $2,500 for a summer
in Washington."
Bunzel outlined the purpose of the program,
saving that the new internships would "hook
them up with jobs." Interns will work in the
"executive branch, state senate, state assembly,
senate and assembly commisions and executive
agencies," he said.
The students will participate in the end of
this year's legislative session and the beginning
of the next during the 10-week program, which
will last from June 21 until Sept. 4. Bunzel said
Stanford-In-Sacramento will be "a hands-on
job, more than in Washington." A press release

issued by SIG said that "interns will be working
closely with the governor (and) the lieutenant
governor."
The program has internships for students
from a wide range of academic disciplines, in
cluding engineering, education, economic
planning and health and human services, ac
cording to the press release.
"This is not just an opportunity for those in
terested in politics â€” almost any of the inter
ests students hold at Stanford can be satisfied,"
Bunzel said. "Sacramento has a vast array of op
portunities."
A large alumni contribution earmarked for
the establishment of an internship program and

University President Donald Kennedy's request
for increased public service opportunities led
to the establishment of the program, Bun/el
said. The "thriving internship program in Wash
ington" also encouraged the development of
Stanford-ln-Sacramento, he added.
"We started it because Stanford has never
had a structured internship program in
Sacramento," said Bun/el. The summer intern
ships were planned in meetings during the
summer with Kennedy, History Prof. David
Kennedy, Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall, State Assemblyman Byron Sher and State
Senator Becky Morgan.
Students will live at University Gar
dens, low-cost apartments where in
terns from the UC-system also live.
Academic, political and social activi
ties will be planned for the residence,
according to Bunzel. "There's going to
be a social life in Sacramento."
The winners of the endowed
Sacramento internships will be re
quired to take a one unit course spring
quarter in the public policy depart
ment called "Policy Making for Califor

nia State Government." Taught by Edu
cation Prof. Mike Kirst, the class will
aim to be an "overview of major insti
tutions, electoral campaigns and coali
tion building," according to an an
nouncement from the department. The
course is specifically geared to teach
interns about California state govern
ment.
Students can pick up applications for
Stanford-ln-Sacramento at the SIG of
fice in Owen House, and completed
forms are due Feb. 9. Interviews with
prospective interns will take place in
the following weeks. The winners will
be announced on March 2.
