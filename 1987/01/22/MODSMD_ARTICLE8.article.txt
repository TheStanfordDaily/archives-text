Reagan to appear before panel
WASHINGTON — A commission investigating U.S. arms sales to Iran and
National Security Council operations yesterday nailed down an appoint
ment with President Reagan and won three more weeks to finish its work.
While the panel headed by former Sen. John Tower interviewed former
President Jimmy Carter in Plains, Ga., White House spokesman Larry
Speakes revealed that Reagan will meet with the commission Monday.
Speakes said Reagan is expected to review White House files with coun
sel Peter Wallison before the session with Tower and two other panel
members, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie and former national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
Reagan is expected to answer panelists' questions about his recollections
of how the program of clandestine arms sales program transpired, Speakes
said.
The three-member board was named by the president on Dec. 1 less
than a week after Attorney General Edwin Meese 111 revealed that some
proceeds from the arms sales had been diverted to Nicaraguan rebels. It
was directed to report by Jan. 29 on the role of the National Security Coun
cil staff in carrying out sensitive diplomatic and intelligence missions such
as the secret arms deals.
Waite leads secret negotiations
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite has been
meeting in a secret place with kidnappers who hold two Americans
hostages, one of his escorts said yesterday night, more than 24 hours after
Waite dropped out of sight.
Meanwhile, a second West German disappeared here, apparently ab
ducted.
"Mr. Waite is having a meeting with the hostage-holders," said Jihad
Zohairi, spokesman for Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia, which is responsible
for Waite's security.
Another Druse official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Waite
would be allowed to "see and converse" with American hostages Terry An
derson and Thomas Sutherland during his talks with the captors.
Waite, a bearded man who stands 6-foot-7, was seen leaving the seafront
Riviera Hotel in the Ein Mreisseh residential district in a jeep at 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday. He has made several trips to Beirut seeking freedom for hostages.
The personal emissary of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie was
escorted by three Druse bodyguards, who returned half an hour later.
Zohairi showed up at the Riviera at 1:30 p.m. yesterday, 18 hours after
Waite left for the second round of talks with Islamic Jihad.
The pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group says it holds Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, and Sutherland, acting
dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut.
Inflation reaches 25 year low
WASHINGTON — Consumer prices rose only 1.1 percent in 1986, giving
Americans their biggest respite from inflation in 25 years, the government
reported yesterday.
The credit, like the blame in the 1970s when double-digit inflation was
putting the squeeze on consumers, goes almost entirely to wild fluctua
tions in the world oil market.
The 1986 increase in the Labor Department's consumer price index, the
lowest since 0.7 percent inflation in 1961 and less than one-third of the 3.8
percent increase in 1985, was skewed by a 60 percent plunge in crude oil
prices last winter following the collapse of the OPEC cartel.
Figures for December alone showed prices rising 0.2 percent from No
vember, equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 2.4 percent.
As a result of last year's oil-price drop, retail prices for gasoline last
month were 30.7 percent below their level of December 1985. Home
heating oil prices were down 29.9 percent and natural gas, and electric
utility bills were 3.3 percent lower.
Consumer prices for everything else in the government's survey of 184
commodities and services rose 3 8 percent in 1986. That compares with an
nual price increases of 4 percent to 4.5 percent for non-energy products
and services from 1982 through 1985.
Student death upsets S. Korea
SEOUL, South Korea — The death of a 21-year-old student activist during
interrogation by South Korea's national police has revived charges of offi
cial torture and plunged the country's stormy political scene into a new
round of turmoil.
In unprecedented developments, officials admitted that police had been
"overzealous," and President Chun Doo-hwan fired the government's top
two law enforcement officers.
Even though the government acted widi dispatch to calm the situation,
the issue was unlikely to disappear quickly. Opposition political forces,
dissidents and Seoul's ever-restive students were expected to make every
effort to assure that the incident was not forgotten or swept aside.
While human rights activists and political dissidents have long accused
Korean governments of torturing dissidents, official reaction generally has
been to deny, dismiss or ignore such allegations.
This time, authorities appeared to realize they faced a different and
potentially dangerous situation. The victim, and the circumstances sur
rounding his death, provided the stuff of which political martyrs are made
at a time when Chun can least afford one.
Agreement to stabilize currency
WASHINGTON — Senior U.S. and Japanese officials agreed yesteday to
cooperate to stabilize foreign currency trading as West Germany's central
bank prepared to cut a key interest rate and help stem the dollar's decline.
After a two-hour meeting between Treasury Secretary James Baker 111
and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, the Treasury issued a state
ment that noted "recent instances of temporary instability in exchange
markets." They said the markets "warrant monitoring" and added that the
two officials "reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange mar
ket issues."
Meanwhile, financial sources in West Germany said the Bundesbank
would reduce its discount rate from 3.5 to 3 percent today, which could
help stem the dollar's slide against the West German mark, Washington
Post chief foreign correspondent Jim Hoagland reported from Frankfurt.
The discount rate is the rate financial institutions pay when they borrow
from the central bank, and it influences consumer and business rates. As
West German interest rates decline, the dollar becomes relatively more at
tractive to investors and therefore stronger on foreign exchange markets.
Officer: SDI work not over
WASHINGTON — The nation's top military officer said yesterday that
more information is needed before the Reagan administration decides
whether to deploy some version of a "Star Wars" anti-missile system.
The statement by Adm. William Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, came amid reports the administration is considering early deploy
ment of the shield against nuclear attack called Strategic Defense Initiative
or SDI. as Star Wars is formally known.
Crowe told the Senate Armed Services G>mmittee that the question of
deploying an SDI program was "a topic of discussion" within top-level
Pentagon circles.
But he said no decision on deployment should be made "before we
know more than we know now "
President Reagan announced the Star Wars research program four years
ago.
But SDI supporters on Capitol Hill have recently pushed for deployment
of some early stages of a system, arguing that Congress is unlikely to keep
paying for research much longer without a deployment decision.

two law enforcement officers.
Even though the government acted widi dispatch to calm the situation,
the issue was unlikely to disappear quickly. Opposition political forces,
dissidents and Seoul's ever-restive students were expected to make every

While human rights activists and political dissidents have long accused
Korean governments of torturing dissidents, official reaction generally has
been to deny, dismiss or ignore such allegations.
This time, authorities appeared to realize they faced a different and
potentially dangerous situation. The victim, and the circumstances sur

Agreement to stabilize currency
WASHINGTON — Senior U.S. and Japanese officials agreed yesteday to
cooperate to stabilize foreign currency trading as West Germany's central
bank prepared to cut a key interest rate and help stem the dollar's decline.
After a two-hour meeting between Treasury Secretary James Baker 111
and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, the Treasury issued a state
ment that noted "recent instances of temporary instability in exchange
markets." They said the markets "warrant monitoring" and added that the
two officials "reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange mar
ket issues."
Meanwhile, financial sources in West Germany said the Bundesbank
would reduce its discount rate from 3.5 to 3 percent today, which could
help stem the dollar's slide against the West German mark, Washington
Post chief foreign correspondent Jim Hoagland reported from Frankfurt.
The discount rate is the rate financial institutions pay when they borrow
from the central bank, and it influences consumer and business rates. As
West German interest rates decline, the dollar becomes relatively more at
tractive to investors and therefore stronger on foreign exchange markets.
Officer: SDI work not over
WASHINGTON — The nation's top military officer said yesterday that
more information is needed before the Reagan administration decides
whether to deploy some version of a "Star Wars" anti-missile system.
The statement by Adm. William Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, came amid reports the administration is considering early deploy
ment of the shield against nuclear attack called Strategic Defense Initiative
or SDI. as Star Wars is formally known.
Crowe told the Senate Armed Services G>mmittee that the question of
deploying an SDI program was "a topic of discussion" within top-level
Pentagon circles.
But he said no decision on deployment should be made "before we
know more than we know now "
President Reagan announced the Star Wars research program four years
ago.
But SDI supporters on Capitol Hill have recently pushed for deployment
of some early stages of a system, arguing that Congress is unlikely to keep
paying for research much longer without a deployment decision.

Reagan to appear before panel
WASHINGTON — A commission investigating U.S. arms sales to Iran and
National Security Council operations yesterday nailed down an appoint
ment with President Reagan and won three more weeks to finish its work.
While the panel headed by former Sen. John Tower interviewed former
President Jimmy Carter in Plains, Ga., White House spokesman Larry
Speakes revealed that Reagan will meet with the commission Monday.
Speakes said Reagan is expected to review White House files with coun
sel Peter Wallison before the session with Tower and two other panel
members, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie and former national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
Reagan is expected to answer panelists' questions about his recollections
of how the program of clandestine arms sales program transpired, Speakes
said.
The three-member board was named by the president on Dec. 1 less
than a week after Attorney General Edwin Meese 111 revealed that some
proceeds from the arms sales had been diverted to Nicaraguan rebels. It
was directed to report by Jan. 29 on the role of the National Security Coun
cil staff in carrying out sensitive diplomatic and intelligence missions such
as the secret arms deals.
Waite leads secret negotiations
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite has been
meeting in a secret place with kidnappers who hold two Americans
hostages, one of his escorts said yesterday night, more than 24 hours after
Waite dropped out of sight.
Meanwhile, a second West German disappeared here, apparently ab
ducted.
"Mr. Waite is having a meeting with the hostage-holders," said Jihad
Zohairi, spokesman for Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia, which is responsible
for Waite's security.
Another Druse official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Waite
would be allowed to "see and converse" with American hostages Terry An
derson and Thomas Sutherland during his talks with the captors.
Waite, a bearded man who stands 6-foot-7, was seen leaving the seafront
Riviera Hotel in the Ein Mreisseh residential district in a jeep at 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday. He has made several trips to Beirut seeking freedom for hostages.
The personal emissary of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie was
escorted by three Druse bodyguards, who returned half an hour later.
Zohairi showed up at the Riviera at 1:30 p.m. yesterday, 18 hours after
Waite left for the second round of talks with Islamic Jihad.
The pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group says it holds Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, and Sutherland, acting
dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut.
Inflation reaches 25 year low
WASHINGTON — Consumer prices rose only 1.1 percent in 1986, giving
Americans their biggest respite from inflation in 25 years, the government
reported yesterday.
The credit, like the blame in the 1970s when double-digit inflation was
putting the squeeze on consumers, goes almost entirely to wild fluctua
tions in the world oil market.
The 1986 increase in the Labor Department's consumer price index, the
lowest since 0.7 percent inflation in 1961 and less than one-third of the 3.8
percent increase in 1985, was skewed by a 60 percent plunge in crude oil
prices last winter following the collapse of the OPEC cartel.
Figures for December alone showed prices rising 0.2 percent from No
vember, equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 2.4 percent.
As a result of last year's oil-price drop, retail prices for gasoline last
month were 30.7 percent below their level of December 1985. Home
heating oil prices were down 29.9 percent and natural gas, and electric
utility bills were 3.3 percent lower.
Consumer prices for everything else in the government's survey of 184
commodities and services rose 3 8 percent in 1986. That compares with an
nual price increases of 4 percent to 4.5 percent for non-energy products
and services from 1982 through 1985.
Student death upsets S. Korea
