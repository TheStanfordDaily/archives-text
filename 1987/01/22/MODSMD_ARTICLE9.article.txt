## Secretary Dole urges drug tests 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Department of Transporta
tion and Congress began moving yesterday toward
requiring random drug-testing of airline and railroad
industry employees, and the department said it plans
to test 26,500 of its own workers as well.
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole disclosed
plans for the broad-ranging drug testing and
rehabilitation program as several members of
Congress said they will introduce drug-testing legis
lation in the coming days.
The whirlwind of activity involving random drug
testing, a controversial issue for some time, came a
week after the disclosure that marijuana had been
used by two Conrail train operators involved in a col
lision with an Amtrak passenger train Jan. 4.
Sixteen people were killed and 175 injured in the
accident.
"People have a right to expect and receive a drug
free transportation system," Dole said in an inter
view. "There's no area where a person's decision to
use drugs would have a more disastrous impact than
in transportation."
She said the Transportation Department plans to
push for legislation requiring random drug testing

for train operators but will move on its own through
new regulations to require such testing of commer
cial pilots, flight crews and other aviation employees
responsible for safe flight operations.
At the same time, the department plans within
"three or four weeks" to have in place an internal
drug-testing and rehabilitation program for 26,500
employees involved in safety or security related jobs,
Dole said.
The program, which is viewed as a prototype for
what the department plans to require for the rail and
aviation industries, calls for pre-employment drug
testing, testing after an accident, random testing and
periodic testing of all employees involved in
security- or safety-related jobs.
Drug testing of government employees under a
presidential directive issued last year is under court
challenge with a trial expected soon in the U.S. Dis
trict Court in New Orleans. Rail and aviation labor
groups in the past have strongly denounced any re
quirements for random drug testing, claiming it to be
unreliable and a violation of an employee's constitu
tional rights.
Dole acknowledged that random testing

"obviously is an emotional issue" that has raised con
troversy. But, she argued, in the case of workers
volved in transportation, "you look at a balance be
tween the safety and security needs of the public and
the constitutional rights of the individual."
Required random testing for certain safety-related
occupations was included initially in a comprehen
sive anti-drug bill enacted by Congress last year, but
the testing provisions were dropped before the bill
was finally approved.
Dole said she anticipates the drug testing program
at the Transportation Department will be in force
within three or four months. The aviation industry's
program must go through normal rulemaking proce
dures and probably would not be in effect before late
1987, and then is likely to be challenged in the
courts.
There are no federal requirements for testing
airline employees for drugs, although many airlines
conduct such tests if drug use is suspected on the
part of a pilot. A year-old federal regulation allows
testing for probable cause by railroads, but critics
argue that it failed to detect marijuana use by the
Conrail crew involved in the Amtrak accident.
