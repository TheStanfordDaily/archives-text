# Aspin regains committee chair
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Rep Les Aspin (D-
Wis.) scrambled back from political
defeat yesterday to regain the House
Armed Services Committee chairman
ship that his Democratic colleagues
stripped from him three weeks ago.
In a bruising battle against three
challengers, Aspin defeated his main
rival, Rep. Marvin Leath (D-Texas) by a
133-to-116 vote in the third and final
secret ballot cast by members of the
House Democratic Caucus.
Earlier, Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-
Mass.) and then Rep. Charles Bennett
(D-Fla.) had been eliminated bv finish
ing last in the balloting.
Aspin, an acknowledged expert on
defense issues who admitted to serious
shortcomings in his dealings with col

leagues, pledged after the vote to
change his style, becoming "more
open" and accessible to other House
Democrats.
Aspin also said the challenge to his
leadership had been "healthy" and had
produced a "united caucus" among the
often fractious House Democrats.
Leath, who worked for months to
depose Aspin as chairman, said he will
devote himself to "trying to make Les
Aspin the best chairman the committee
ever had."
In the immediate aftermath of the
vote, there was widespread specula
tion that Aspin, although victorious,
had been humbled and will now be
much more responsive to the demands

of the caucus, which is more liberal
than the Democratic membership of
the Armed Services Committee.
Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.), who
said lie voted for Aspin on all but the
first ballot, on which he backed Mav
roules, predicted that Aspin will "think
long and hard before he departs from
the wishes of the caucus" on major is
sues.
Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Texas), a
Leath supporter, said Aspin is now in
debted to liberals who dominate the
caucus and that this "clearly will mean
a leftward tilt" in his leadership of the
committee.
Aspin dodged questions on how the
near loss of the chairmanship that he
gained only two years ago would affect

his previous support for aid to the
Nicaraguan contras and deployment of
MX missiles, two votes that deeply an
gered his liberal supporters.
He said the contest was "not about
those issues, but about how those is
sues are handled."
Although Aspin had alienated many
colleagues by such votes and by a style
that was described as aloof and cocky,
Leath proved too conservative for a
majority of House Democrats. In the
final days of intense campaigning,
Aspin's supporters circulated a
detailed analysis of Leath's voting
record that they said showed him to be
"completely out of step with the vast
majority of House Democrats.
