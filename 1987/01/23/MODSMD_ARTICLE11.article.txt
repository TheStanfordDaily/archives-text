# Allies asked to help fund contras
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Over the last several years,
Reagan administration officials have solicited assis
tance for the Nicaraguan rebels from at least six
countries — Israel, Saudi Arabia, Brunei, Singapore,
South Korea and Taiwan — according to information
furnished to congressional committees probing the
Iran-contra affair.
Most of the solicitations apparently were un
successful, but two congressional sources said yester
day that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
has evidence that Israel contributed weapons to the
contras as early as 1984 in response to a U.S. request.
Israel has repeatedly denied providing money or
weapons to the contras, and an Israeli spokesman
repeated that denial yesterday.
Secretary of State George Shultz previously con
firmed a single State Department solicitation to a
country identified by other sources as the sultanate
of Brunei.
In recent days, he has reported to investigators

that, in fall 1985, the department also discussed a Sin
gaporean contribution of long-range radios that was
never made, according to administration sources.
In addition, Shultz has told investigators that he
has received secondhand and sketchy reports that
other government agencies solicited contributions to
tiie contras from Saudi Arabia and South Korea, the
sources said.
In addition, sources said the Senate panel has
developed information that a U.S. solicitation was
made to Taiwan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia for
contra aid. The committee has developed no
evidence that contributions were made.
The idea of soliciting other countries on behalf of
the contras reportedly originated in early 1984 when
Congress balked at a Central Intelligence Agency re
quest for an additional $14 million to help them.
At meetings of an interagency group of State,
Defense, CIA and White House officials involved in
supervising the covert war, sources said, Lt. Col.

Oliver North, then a National Security Council staff
member, favored obtaining other governments' help.
"North was consumed with getting alternative
funding for the contras," said a source who attended
the meetings. "He said, These guys can't die on the
vine.' " Israel, Taiwan and South Korea were men
tioned as possible contributors then, according to
die source.
As previously reported, in spring 1984, a senior
CIA official approached the Saudis, who turned down
the request. Saudi officials and spokesmen have
repeatedly denied assisting the contras.
Nonetheless, sources said that, later that year, an
associate of retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord again approached the Saudis, who again
turned down the approach, the sources said. In addi
tion, sources said the chairmen of two large U.S. cor
porations unsuccessfully attempted to obtain Saudi
government money for the contras.
