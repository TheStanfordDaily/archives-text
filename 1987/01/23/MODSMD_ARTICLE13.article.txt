# The 						'Pageant' carries on
## 
### LESTER BASKIN 
If you, like most Stanford students,
took American history in high school,
chances are you read "The American
Pageant, a textbook written and
edited by two Stanford history profes
sors.
"The American Pageant'' was
authored originally by the late Thomas
Bailey, professor of history, and was
first published in 1956. In 1976, Bailey
invited History Prof. David Kennedy to
collaborate on the text's sixth edition.
When Bailey died in 1983, Kennedy
became the sole caretaker of the
"Pageant," the eighth edition of which
is currently undergoing final revisions.
Kennedy estimated two to three mil
lion students have used the text since
its initial publishing.
Kennedy's initial collaboration with
Bailey was not without trials.
"At the time (summer 1976) I was
working in Italy — I had the copy and
reference materials for the book and
spent the summer on the island of Elba
in a rented villa, writing and revising
on the terrace in the sun," he said.
"I would send my revisions to
Bailey, and he would more often than
not send them back. I think 1 wrote as
many memos to him trying to convince
him of what was needed as I wrote ac
tual text."
For the sixth edition, approximately

20 percent of the book was revised or
changed in some way, and more than
half of the book has been revised since
its original publication.
"Things change in history — people
don't think they do, but they do," Ken
nedy said.
"Over the past few years we have
learned an immense amount about so
many different areas of American his
tory, particularly slavery, women, the
history' of the family, and the colonial
period, material that we scarcely knew
about 20 years ago," he continued.
"People understand changes in physics
or math or chemistry, but most people
feel history is frozen in amber, and it's
just not true."
Working with Bailey was an enjoy
able experience for Kennedy.
"He (Bailey) was a deliberate, self
conscious person and a terrific his

torian, Kennedy said. Bailey was well
known on the Stanford campus for his
vigorous, innovative teaching style;
The American Pageant'' was his
response to the high schcx)l texts of the
time, which were mostly lengthy, dry
and cluttered accounts of U.S. history,
according to Kennedy.
"This book was deliberately written
in a colorful and lively style, aimed at
not just educating the student, but in
teresting him in the subject as well," he
says.
Bailey firmly believed that it was ne
cessary to keep the student interested
and involved, and it wxs through his
experiences in teaching that the format
for the book came about, Kennedy ex
plained. It was the rejection of the con
ventional doctrine that says"it has to
he grim to he great" that originally in
terested Kennedy in"The American
Pageant."
"1 guess the thing I liked the most
was the fact that this textbook had per
sonality — it wasn't just another history
book," he said.
Many characteristics not immedi
ately apparent to the casual observer
separate the text from its contemporar
ies, Kennedy explained.
"Bailey was so meticulous that he
sent me a 20-page typed document,
Secrets of "The American Pageant," '
as to how to sustain the reader's inter
est," he said.
The document contained various
rules and guidelines, designed to em
phasize the personalities and opposing
forces of history, as well as make for ef
fective writing.
"I couldn't even begin a sentence
with an article — I had to use a noun
or active verb," Kennedy said.
This does not mean, however, that
the book was perfect in Kennedy's
eyes.
"I disliked the fact that things were
left out," he said. "Women's issues
were almost totally ignored, and I did
not like the way slavery was addressed.
I also wanted to stress the importance
of the students' opinions, that there are
alternative viewpoints to the material.
These were just some of the things I set
out to change."
Making these changes was no easy
task, according to Kennedy.
"Revising means I have to read enor
mous amounts of secondary literature
to assure accuracy," he explained.
"There are so many facets to a major
revision of a book of this size.
"For example, for this last revision,
the eighth edition, I started by sending
out two to three hundred question

naires to instructors around the
country to find out their likes and
dislikes about the book. I also solicited
academic specialists on certain areas
and took their input," he said.
Kennedy also must oversee several
other aspects of the text's revisions,
areas which, he said, many people
overlook. These include the artwork,

graphics, maps, charts and various
photographs that went into the* new
edition.
And how does Kennedy feel about
his work on "The American Pageant"?
Admittedly, it is a distraction, he said.
"It takes time away from my research
on the and 40s, my most recent
area of specialization," he said.
