Last Thursday night's shenanigans were the 1987 ver
sion of one of Stanford's longest-running plays. The
script goes something like this:
Students go to parties. Students get drunk. Students
begin to do very stupid things. The police are called. The
police proceed to break up the party. Everybody goes
home.
The next day, a Res Ed official — usually the director
of the Row, since that's where most of the parties on
campus are — vows to get to the bottom of the incident
and launches an investigation. The hosts of the party in
question claim they did everything possible to keep the
event under control. In the end, the dean of Student Af
fairs promises to punish severely those responsible for
the vandalism.
This year's version had a fcw new twists. Apparently,
some hooligans thought they'd celebrate the full moon
by urinating on lawns, ripping water fountains from
walls, pulling fire alarms and otherwise wreaking havoc.
The vandals caused an estimated $2,000 damage to two
houses on the Row.
Apart from wishing aloud that it doesn't happen again,

there's not a whole lot to say about the incident.
There's no clear solution to the problem. Banning al
cohol from campus is too extreme and unnecessarily
punishes those who drink responsibly. Requiring hosts
of parties to monitor their guests more carefully won't
work either; parties are already closely monitored.
One sure way to get rid of the vandalism that visits the
campus yearly would be to ban parties altogether, but
that would be such a heinous restriction of freedom that
any university that tried to do so would probably be
driven out of business. Besides, it's ridiculous to expect
college students to sit around and study on weekend
nights.
Where, then, does that leave anyone who attempts to
arrive at a solution to the problem of collegiate drunken
ess and vandalism? Should it be tolerated as an inevitable
and important part of the college experience? Not really.
Maybe — just maybe — someday college students will
realize that urinating on someone's front lawn, destroy
ing property and acting like a fool in public aren't exactly
worthwhile experiences.
