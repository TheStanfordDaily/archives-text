Daily frat stance
has homosexuality
as moral standard
In The Daily editorial on Jan. 21, the
editorial staff came out strongly
against housing for the Zeta Psi frater
nity. While this stand is laudable, the
Daily has enlisted a bad soldier in the
defense of its position.
The Daily attacks housing for Zeta
Psi because of the fraternity's antiso
cial actions, as well as a belief that
housing should be not be reserved for
a "predominantly white, and totally
male, heterosexual group of stu
dents."
OK, I get your point, and I agree
with you. But why is disapproval of
homosexuality considered a strike
against a housing group by The Daily?
The Daily obviously associates the
moral high ground with sup*port of
homosexuality. This is evident in its

repeated allotment of prominent
editorial space to the group
"Uprising," which has as one of its
stated purposes "combating the
oppression of gays and lesbians." This
group has used its platform in The
Daily to hail as "freedom fighters"
those blacks in South Africa who
murderered black supporters of Zulu
Chief Gatsha Buthelezi by throwing
tires around them, then setting them
on fire. While the record of the Zeta
Psi fraternity is abysmal, certainly
these events in South Africa are far
worse. Yet The Daily continues to give
editorial space to a group that praises
such senseless violence! I strongly
urge The Daily to reconsider this
self-discrediting policy.
Disapproval of homosexuality is
sure to bring accusations of blind
prejudice, but I do not believe this to
be the case. Prejudice occurs when
people are judged by their external
appearance instead of by their actions,
and homosexuality is certainly an
action. Christian morality, which is the
basis of the Western value system,

unequivocally denounces both
homosexuality and senseless violence,
such as the murder of blacks by blacks
in South Africa. I don't find that quite
as indefensible a position as some
would have us believe. Call me a
reactionary, I guess.

Arab anatomy
raises questions
in Israeli stance
Please clarify something for me. In
Isaac Winer's recent viewpoint (Daily,
Jan. 14), I read: "Defending them
selves, Israeli troops opened fire at
the feet of the [Palestinian] students,
killing two "
Are Palestinians' vital organs located
in their feet?
Thank you.
