# 'Platoon' is closest to real thing
## 
### 
When friends ask me about the movie "Platoon," I
try immediately to blurt something out and just sort
of admit a stifled gasp. After letting my cognitive
powers catch up with my emotional response, I am
left with the strong sense that to ask about the
cinematic and artistic merits of "Platoon" somehow
misses the point. Yes, "Platoon" is a seamlessly made
movie in which the directing and acting are so good
that such niceties are all but transparent. First and
foremost, indeed, "Platoon" is a powerful, scorching
vision that only Dante in his febrile imagery could
have created. Yet the audience is not under the illu
sion of created drama. Director Oliver Stone, a Viet-

ROBERT LIPTON

nam infantry veteran, relentlessly seeks to avoid alle
gory and interpretation in his quest to portray the
"objective" nature of his own hellish experience.
There is little .story line or building of plot. There are
no cathartic images that the audience can expect, and
more importantly there is very little that the audience
can empathize with. We are struck by the horror on
the screen, but. in its very objectivity, it distances us
from the underlying terror and fear that those in
combat or the victims of combat must experience.
Most people, except for those among us who
fought in Vietnam, find little to relate to in the movie.
There is a metaphorical dichotomy between two
platoon sergeants, one a Sergeant Rock type of killing
machine, completely debased by his experience,
who exhorts a badly wounded soldier to stop
screaming and "suck it in,"and the other, who is
equally adept at warfare but against all hope also
fighting to keep his wearied humanity These two,
however, are opaque to the audience: We cannot

know of the geologic forces that brought them to
their present state. Generally, we see other people's
debasement, cruelty and inhumanity, but we cannot,
thankfully, know the multidimensional sense of the
experience. We are shocked by the carnage and
destruction, but we really have no place to store such
impressions.

The movie only leaves the audience with a
momentary feeling of rei mlsion. Those who
were in Vietnam, however, will carry the scars
permanently.

The implication and content of such visceral
screen images only leaves us with a momentary
feeling of revulsion. Those who were in Vietnam,
however, will earn, the scars permanently. Usually,
films employ metaphor to allow the members of the
audience to obtain a contextual sense of the charac
ters' situation and apply it to their own lives. Specifi
cally, most movies about war strive to conned the au
dience to the plight of the characters through strong
metaphor. In Apocalypse Now," the construct of
Joseph Conrad's The Heart of Darkness" connected
the audience to the experience. Through the inculca
tion of great literary metaphor, the experience of the
characters on the screen was more identifiable to us.
For example, the trip up the river was very obviously
a descent into a hell the audience could envision.
In the same way, the highlv racist and sen

sationalist "Deer Hunter," through the metaphor of
Russian roulette and the portrayal of the bonds of ci
vilian friendship, let us come into the lives of the
characters. Other movies such as "Coming Home,"
"All Quiet on the Western Front," Oliver Stone's own
"Salvador" and Dalton Trumball's deeply disturbing
"John Got his Gun" use different forms of metaphor

and dramatic tension to bring the nightmare world of
war home to the audience.
Stone, in striving for the most realism possible in
"Platoon," has no use for the conventions of typical
drama. Some of the "good guys die, some of the
"bad" guys live, others are wounded, with little sense
of the "proper" result the audience either con
sciously or unconsciously expects In the end, the
narrator (Stone) is left alive, but only, it seems, to
chronicle the quaking soul wreckage that results
from war. Ultimately, this is a movie by, for and about
Vietnam veterans. The rest of the audience is left in
the uncomfortable but enlightening role of sado
masochistic voyeurs

When friends ask me about the movie "Platoon," I
try immediately to blurt something out and just sort
of admit a stifled gasp. After letting my cognitive
powers catch up with my emotional response, I am
left with the strong sense that to ask about the
cinematic and artistic merits of "Platoon" somehow
misses the point. Yes, "Platoon" is a seamlessly made
movie in which the directing and acting are so good
that such niceties are all but transparent. First and
foremost, indeed, "Platoon" is a powerful, scorching
vision that only Dante in his febrile imagery could
have created. Yet the audience is not under the illu
sion of created drama. Director Oliver Stone, a Viet-

nam infantry veteran, relentlessly seeks to avoid alle
gory and interpretation in his quest to portray the
"objective" nature of his own hellish experience.
There is little .story line or building of plot. There are
no cathartic images that the audience can expect, and
more importantly there is very little that the audience
can empathize with. We are struck by the horror on
the screen, but. in its very objectivity, it distances us
from the underlying terror and fear that those in
combat or the victims of combat must experience.
Most people, except for those among us who
fought in Vietnam, find little to relate to in the movie.
There is a metaphorical dichotomy between two
platoon sergeants, one a Sergeant Rock type of killing
machine, completely debased by his experience,
who exhorts a badly wounded soldier to stop
screaming and "suck it in,"and the other, who is
equally adept at warfare but against all hope also
fighting to keep his wearied humanity These two,
however, are opaque to the audience: We cannot

know of the geologic forces that brought them to
their present state. Generally, we see other people's
debasement, cruelty and inhumanity, but we cannot,
thankfully, know the multidimensional sense of the
experience. We are shocked by the carnage and
destruction, but we really have no place to store such
impressions.

The movie only leaves the audience with a
momentary feeling of rei mlsion. Those who
were in Vietnam, however, will carry the scars
permanently.

The implication and content of such visceral
screen images only leaves us with a momentary
feeling of revulsion. Those who were in Vietnam,
however, will earn, the scars permanently. Usually,
films employ metaphor to allow the members of the
audience to obtain a contextual sense of the charac
ters' situation and apply it to their own lives. Specifi
cally, most movies about war strive to conned the au
dience to the plight of the characters through strong
metaphor. In Apocalypse Now," the construct of
Joseph Conrad's The Heart of Darkness" connected
the audience to the experience. Through the inculca
tion of great literary metaphor, the experience of the
characters on the screen was more identifiable to us.
For example, the trip up the river was very obviously
a descent into a hell the audience could envision.
In the same way, the highlv racist and sen

sationalist "Deer Hunter," through the metaphor of
Russian roulette and the portrayal of the bonds of ci
vilian friendship, let us come into the lives of the
characters. Other movies such as "Coming Home,"
"All Quiet on the Western Front," Oliver Stone's own
"Salvador" and Dalton Trumball's deeply disturbing
"John Got his Gun" use different forms of metaphor

and dramatic tension to bring the nightmare world of
war home to the audience.
Stone, in striving for the most realism possible in
"Platoon," has no use for the conventions of typical
drama. Some of the "good guys die, some of the
"bad" guys live, others are wounded, with little sense
of the "proper" result the audience either con
sciously or unconsciously expects In the end, the
narrator (Stone) is left alive, but only, it seems, to
chronicle the quaking soul wreckage that results
from war. Ultimately, this is a movie by, for and about
Vietnam veterans. The rest of the audience is left in
the uncomfortable but enlightening role of sado
masochistic voyeurs
