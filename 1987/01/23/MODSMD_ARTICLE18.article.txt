I found Avi Magidoffs recent viewpoint (Daily, Jan. 6)
very interesting, since the author claims he is a member of
the Human/Animal Liberation Front, headquartered in New
York City. A leaflet, dated August 1985, was sent to me from
this organization, titled "The Direct Action Paper. The fol
lowing quotes from the leaflet relate to Magidoffs view
point.
"Universities make very good targets because they are of
ten publicly funded, information on research conducted in
them is more readily available, security is more relaxed
(compared to commercial or military research facilities),
and they are more susceptible to pressure as the concept of
accountability to society is more developed. (This does not
go to say that only universities or animal researchers are
good targets — breeders, slaughter houses and others are
just as deserving.)

THOMAS HAMM, JR.

"First of all you must choose a target. In order to do that
you should pick a university of your choice, one with a
graduate curriculum in psychology, biology, or medical
sciences. Obtain the Institute's bulletin from the Dean's or
Public Relation's office (this book may be termed an annual
report, scientific and research programs, or whatever). In
the bulletin each department gives a brief description of its
research programs as well as personnel and bibliographies.
Scan the whole book and pick out research on animals.
Choose what seems most absurd or most offensive
(painful), and best concentrate on cats, dogs and primates
so as to ensure public sympathy. Once you choose the of
fensive departments, scan the personnel — look them up in
Index Medicus, Biological Abstracts or Psychological
Abstracts. Collect sample articles from each person using
animals who might qualify as a good target. Limit yourself to
the last five years (or else you will be swamped with arti
cles). To 'quickly' (there is nothing quick in this laborious li
brary work) evaluate the worthiness of an article, and its au
thor, read the abstract and a section entitled Subjects, Ma
terials, and Methods. This will give you an idea of what went
on, what animals were used, and how many.
"Now that you have chosen a target(s), follow him/her
through at least the last five years. Head in full all articles
published by him/her as well as by their graduate students

Anyone who is interested in
the issue of how animals are
treated at Stanford is encour
aged to call the Division of
Laboratory Medicine and
arrange to come see for
yourself

(usually listed as co-authors). Reading medical/research text
is not as hard as one might think. Much of it is fairly esoteric,
you might need a dictionary (medical one), but you will
probably be able to follow most of it. The full text often of
fers descriptions of failures (animals died due to lack of this,
that, or the other, or previous unsuccessful attempts) as well
as the stated purpose and evaluation of how much was
achieved (ususally under a section termed Discussion).
Build up your charges: include number and type of
animals, description of research and purpose, and refute, if
possible, the validity of the research. Build your case on
both scientific and moral grounds. It is vital that you show
real understanding of the research so that you are not dis
missed as an ignoramus outsider.' Also include funding in
formation where available, and if possible the researcher's
salary. , ~ ; • f<l
"The McM impohfant aspect of an action is creativityKdo
not be afraid of being outrageous. As it is we are looked
upon as a lunatic fringe, so we might as well capitalize on
it."
Anyone who wants the entire text of this leaflet may have
a copy by contacting my office. The author of The Daily
viewpoint has obviously followed his organization's advice,
especially by using his creativity. The author of that view
point expects the reader to believe that an individual with a
medical dictionary and committed to the abolition of animal
research is more able to determine the scientific worth or
humane treatment of animals than the veterinarians in my
division, the reviewers used by the funding organizations,
the reviewers used by the journals cited, or the investigators
themselves.
We have passed many unannounced inspections of our
program by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Na
tional Institutes of Health. The Ethics Committee has
reviewed animal research at Stanford and has released a
very supportive report (a copy of this report is available by
contacting my office). In addition our Animal Care Commit
tee constantly monitors all animal work. A recent site visit
team has recommended that NIH provide me with an addi
tional $1.1 million in direct costs to expand our diagnostic
laboratory. The site visitors said in their report: "Dr. Hamm
and his staff are providing leadership that is exemplary.
Fhey are patient, eager to provide help and education, while
at the same time they tactfully demand firm adherence to
guidlines that assure quaility, humane animal care."
