# Interim Tresidder directors named
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Two Tresidder Union officials will
temporarily take over responsibility
for the student union Monday, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons announced
yesterday.
Faye Knox, assistant dean of student
affairs, and Paul Szczesiul, assistant di
rector of Tresidder, will split the duties
of departing director F.llie Oppen
heim, pending the expected Novem
ber completion of a re-evaluation of
Tresidder's role at the University and a
subsequent search for a new director.
A review of the role of Tresidder that
will seek the opinions of student
groups and Tresidder employees is ex
pected to last until April, Lyons said,
and the search for a new director will
begin once that study is completed.
Lyons said splitting responsibility for
Tresidder is required because of the
number of roles played by Oppen
heim, who served both as director of
Student Organization Services and of
Tresidder. "She'll be hard to replace,"
he said upon announcing Jan. 12 that
Oppenheim would leave to become
assistant director of thVSan Jose De
partment of Parks and Recreation.
Knox, who worked under Oppen
heim at Tresidder's Student Organiza
tion Services last year, will continue to
hold her current position as assistant
dean.
Szczesiul has held his current post at
Tresidder since August 1982 and is re
sponsible for managing facilities. It is
undecided whether he will continue in
that position in addition to his new as
signment, Lyons said.
Neither Knox nor Szczesiul could be
reached for comment last night.
Council of Presidents member Kim
Crawford responded positively to
Lyons' appointments and said she was
hopeful that the once-troubled
ASSU/Tresidder relations would con
tinue to improve.
Criticism that Tresidder has been
primarily concerned with profit
making rather than providing student
services subsided this year as Oppen
heim opened discussion on the role of
the student union.
"We hope to continue to rebuild the
relationship," Crawford said yesterday,
adding that in its informal, biweekly
meeting with Lyons today the COP will
emphasize its desire that Tresidder be
renovated.
"We'll expect support for changes at
Tresidder if the (ASSU) senate ap
proves funding this coming Tuesday,"
which seems likely, she said.
The proposed renovation of the stu
dent union would take place in two
stages, Crawford said. In the first stage
the Coffee House would be moved to
the old bowling alley (now LOTS II),
The Store into the Coffee House area
and the Corner Pocket into The Store's
space. The spiral staircase would be
enclosed in glass, and more meeting
rooms would be built on the second
level, she said.
In the second stage, a two-story addi
tion would be built atop the Tresidder
patio to accomodate offices for student
groups, she said.
Crawford added that she hopes
Tresidder officials will support ASSU
proposals to put a dry cleaning service
and/or a video rental shop in the old
Union Board office.
