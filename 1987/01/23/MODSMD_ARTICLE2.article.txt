# Interim Tresidder directors named
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Two Tresidder Union officials will
temporarily take over responsibility
for the student union Monday, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons announced
yesterday.
Faye Knox, assistant dean of student
affairs, and Paul Szczesiul, assistant di
rector of Tresidder, will split the duties
of departing director F.llie Oppen
heim, pending the expected Novem
ber completion of a re-evaluation of
Tresidder's role at the University and a
subsequent search for a new director.
A review of the role of Tresidder that
will seek the opinions of student
groups and Tresidder employees is ex
pected to last until April, Lyons said,
and the search for a new director will
begin once that study is completed.
Lyons said splitting responsibility for
Tresidder is required because of the
number of roles played by Oppen
heim, who served both as director of
Student Organization Services and of
Tresidder. "She'll be hard to replace,"
he said upon announcing Jan. 12 that
Oppenheim would leave to become
assistant director of thVSan Jose De
partment of Parks and Recreation.
Knox, who worked under Oppen
heim at Tresidder's Student Organiza
tion Services last year, will continue to
hold her current position as assistant
dean.
Szczesiul has held his current post at
Tresidder since August 1982 and is re
sponsible for managing facilities. It is
undecided whether he will continue in
that position in addition to his new as
signment, Lyons said.
Neither Knox nor Szczesiul could be
reached for comment last night.
Council of Presidents member Kim
Crawford responded positively to
Lyons' appointments and said she was
hopeful that the once-troubled
ASSU/Tresidder relations would con
tinue to improve.
