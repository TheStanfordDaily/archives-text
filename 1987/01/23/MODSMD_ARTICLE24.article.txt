## Roar of the greasepaint 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Staff writer 
Just when you thought it was safe to go into Memorial
Auditorium, the Sharks are hack.
The Sharks and the Jets, that is — the two rival gangs in
Leonard Bernstein's classic musical, "West Side Story,
which Ram's Head will present as its annual spring musi
cal this year.
The arduous process of creating a sensational musical
began in earnest last week, with auditions.
Hopeful auditioners showed up at the designated
room in the back of Memorial Auditorium, patiently and
somewhat nervously awaiting instructions.
Stage manager Sean Sullivan and his assistants organ
ized the players, photographing each auditioner in order
to jog the memories of the director and his co-workers.
"As a whole they (auditions) went great — things went
a lot better than 1 thought they would," Sullivan said.
"( The auditioners) all listened well and followed direc
tions so things went smoothly."
The actual auditioning then began.
The group headed for the auditorium, preparing to
start the singing. After a short group warm-up, each per
son went on stage alone.
After mumbling directions to the pianist and taking up
position in the center of the stage, the singers began. The
introductory notes sounded small and tinny. The singer s
throat tightened with nervous anxiety.
The show's director, senior Bart Manning, stopped the
auditioner in the middle of the song.
"How high can you go?" he asked.
A deep breath, concentration, and the student started
up the scales.
That exercise completed, Manning signaled for the
next person.
"There was a lot of talent at the auditions," Manning
said afterward. "We had no problem finding a full cast,
which is really unusual for a show like this."
After completion of the singing portion of the audi
tions, each person was assigned a short monologue and
allowed a few moments to work on his or her interpreta
tion.
The acting audition began with the actor stating his or

her name and the title of the monologue he or she was
performing.
At first he gave his own version of the monologue, fill
ing it with emotion and action. Once again the director
stopped the participant, this time to instruct him in a dif
ferent interpretation of the monologue.
"This time do it like you're on drugs, Manning in
structed. Or, "Now you're 12, take it from where you left
off."
After a moment of thought the actor began again
this time trying to comply with the director s wishes.
Inevitably, Manning interrupted — this time to pose a
problem to which the auditioner must develop a creative
solution.
"OK, you're a steward on a plane over the Atlantic,
Manning developed the scenario. "You've just run out of
fuel, and it's up to you to inform the passengers. What do
you say and do?"
Each actor was given a different such situation. After all
of them had successfully completed the ordeal, the
dance work began.
Choreographer Judy Kreith and her assistant, sopho
more Karen Senko, warmed up all the would-be dancers,
then launched into their rendition of the audition dance.
Quickly and fluidly, the two danced the routine, giving
all the hopefuls a chance to observe what the routine is
supposed to look like. Their leaps, turns and steps
flowed with the music and made the piece look wonder
fully smooth.
Then the auditioners gave it a try. Kreith went through
the routine repeatedly, step by step, coaching the dan
cers each time.
After almost an hour of dancing — an hour the body
felt was endless and the mind knew was too short to truly
know the routine — it was time once again to perform
for Manning and his assistants.
The dance over, the participants could then go home
to wait for the results, while the staff labored over the
work of choosing the cast.
"We worked all night doing the callback list on Mon
day night," Sullivan said.
