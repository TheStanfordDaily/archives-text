## The 						true face of the Vietnam War Or a powerful and unforgettable experience? 
### MARY SUNGAILA 
Rejoice O young man, in your youth
— Ecclesiastes
With this epigraph the first scene
opens with the body bags of 19- and
20-year-old men being lifted onto
airplanes to be flown home. The tone
is set, the irony clear: "Platoon" is to be
no conventional war movie of glory
and lauded bravery. Such was not
writer/director Oliver Stone's aim A
Vietnam veteran himself, Stone
portrays the bitter reality of the most
defamed war in U.S. history, in particu
lar the psychological strife of young
men placed in uncertain, unconven
tional guerrilla warfare.
There is more pathos here for the
individual soldier, who must for the
most pan rely on himself and perhaps
one other buddy for survival. There
are no clear battle lines: The enemy
could be anywhere or nowhwere. Of
ten the enemy is inside each man as
bestiality broils to the surface amid
tension and pain. The battle is psycho
logical and intense — the movie's ef
fect, equally so.
Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a
young idealist who dropped out of col
lege to fight in the war. He wants to do
his share for his country and feels it
isn't fair that only the poor should have
to fight. But in Vietnam he discovers
there is no room for idealism or
morality; a sense of right and wrong is
the first thing left behind in the mud.
Never was the old "War is hell" adage
more true.
"Shut up and take the pain," a new
recruit writhing in agony from a gun
shot wound is told. His screams could
endanger the entire troop; there is
little room for compassion when the
name of the game is survival. And sur
vival means much more than escaping
whizzing bullets: Malaria, leeches, ants,
lack of sleep and hygiene, as well as
the constant tension of not knowing
where the enemy is while your buddy
is amid the snakes and foliage — sol
diers must deal with all of this before
any engagements with the enemy oc
cur. With die psyche stretched so taut,
it's bound to snap at some point. Thus

Stone's genius in the village scene
shows exactly how the Mai Lai mas
sacre that shocked the world could
have occured. An American troop
invades the village to search for hidden
members of the NVA as well as to
destroy their storehouses. Senseless
violence ensues, erupting in attempted
rapes, the shooting of animals, women
and children, as well as the temptation
to "do" the entire village.
The soldiers behave in an inhuman
way, but their inhumanity is produced
by tensions and situations far beyond
their control. The "morality" of their
actions cannot be judged by conven
tional society's standards. There is no
mercy here, only war. And war is hell;

hell, the impossibility of reason.
Exemplifying the struggle within
Taylor's own soul are "old-timers," Sgt.
Elias (William Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes
(Tom Berenger). Elias is the closest
thing to a good guy the Vietnam envi
ronment is capable of sustaining. E
thereal in his leaps through the jungle,
his appearance halts the massacre of
the village. His drugs carry the men
away from reality's harshness. On the
other hand, Barnes, in his own words,
"is the war." Compassionless, visibly
scarred, he believes that "every man
has his time to die." The platoon
becomes polarized under the sway of
these two very different soldiers.
Taylor follows Elias, the closest thing

to an idealist he can find.
Sheen, Dafoe and Berenger are ex
cellent in their roles. They communi
cate the loss of innocence and the
hard ening of souls, all the while
remaining human characters and not
caricatures.
"Platoon" is not easy to watch, but ii
is a seminal movie that will change
America's attitudes toward the war and
its veterans. Hie movie embarks the
audience on a search for ' goodness
and meaning in this life," as Vietnam
veterans were compelled to do years
ago, and which spurs them to stem the
tide of any future such degradation and
inhumanity. "Platoon" is an experience
that truly should not be missed.
