# 'Platoon': Just hype?
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
Vietnam, Vietnam Just when you
thought the war had been
trivialized by the likes of Chuck Mor
ris and Sylvester Stallone, along
comes "Platoon," a movie that
brings us back to horrifying reality
The movie has critics doing somer
saults and is being hyped as a Big
Deal; its already become a cliche
for reviewers to reach for the
nearest copy of Michael Herr's
Dispatches" in attempting to
describe the film. So is it really that
good'' Here are two dijfering views
on the subject
IHtimately, however, with a sub
ject as touchy as the Vietnam War, it
will be up to viewers to reach their
own judgments about "Platoon";
no movie review can hope to
resolve the issues brought up by the
movie.

"A powerful film." "It knocked
me for a loop." "Incredible." "Ten
plus, off the scale." "A great Ameri
can movie." "A major work of art."
"The best film of the year." These
are just a few of the critical ac
colades that have been used in the
movie advertisements for
"Platoon." Although I don't agree
with all these views, there's no
doubting that "Platoon" will be the
most talked-about movie of the
year.
Not many people had heard
about "Platoon" when it snuck into
theaters in limited release a few
weeks ago, in time for Oscar con
sideration. Favorable reviews and
word of mouth stirred up interest,
and the film has, since then, am
bushed the American public with a
shell storm of controversy.
Much of the controversy that has
surrounded "Platoon" is mostly the
kind of controversy that surrounds
any Vietnam film that comes out,
such as the complaints that it's not
realistic enough, it's too realistic, it

shows American troops in an un
favorable light, it shows the Viet
namese in an unfavorable light â€”
that kind of stuff.
In the late 19705, the first wave of
Vietnam films that brought contro
versy were the sympathetic, antiwar
films like "Coming Home," "The
Deer Hunter" and "Apocalypse
Now." About six years later, the
next phase of Vietnam films catered
to the hero-starved, right-wing
audiences that wanted to see the
United States win the war in such
films as "Uncommon Valor,"
"Missing in Action" and, of course,
"Rambo: First Blood Part Two."
With the appearance of "Platoon," a
new kind of Vietnam film is in town.
It combines the firepower and
macho action that appeals to the
"Top Gun" audiences while retain
ing the ideologies that preach that
war is a bad thing. Hie philosophy
of "Platoon" may very well be the
precursor of the next generation of
Vietnam films. Indeed, no less than
four Vietnam dramas are in the
starting gates for the coming year,
including movies by Francis Ford
Coppola and Stanley Kubrick.
So much for all the controversy.
Is "Platoon" really as good as every
one says it is? After reading about all
the hype and garish critical praise
lavished upon "Platoon," I was
more than a little anxious to see this
flick; at the same time, however, I
was more than a little skeptical.
After all, anything that pleases all
the critics can't be that good. I sub
sequently walked into the theater
half with high expectations and half
with the expectation of being let
down. I saw the movie, and al
though it didn't let me down, it
didn't strike me as the monumental
achievement everyone is talking
about. While I'll agree with every
one that it's a knockout movie, I
draw the line on it being a "major
work of art."
