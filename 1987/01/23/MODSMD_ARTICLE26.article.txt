# 'Platoon': Just hype?
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
Vietnam, Vietnam Just when you
thought the war had been
trivialized by the likes of Chuck Mor
ris and Sylvester Stallone, along
comes "Platoon," a movie that
brings us back to horrifying reality
The movie has critics doing somer
saults and is being hyped as a Big
Deal; its already become a cliche
for reviewers to reach for the
nearest copy of Michael Herr's
Dispatches" in attempting to
describe the film. So is it really that
good'' Here are two dijfering views
on the subject
IHtimately, however, with a sub
ject as touchy as the Vietnam War, it
will be up to viewers to reach their
own judgments about "Platoon";
no movie review can hope to
resolve the issues brought up by the
movie.

"A powerful film." "It knocked
me for a loop." "Incredible." "Ten
plus, off the scale." "A great Ameri
can movie." "A major work of art."
"The best film of the year." These
are just a few of the critical ac
colades that have been used in the
movie advertisements for
"Platoon." Although I don't agree
with all these views, there's no
doubting that "Platoon" will be the
most talked-about movie of the
year.
Not many people had heard
about "Platoon" when it snuck into
theaters in limited release a few
weeks ago, in time for Oscar con
sideration. Favorable reviews and
word of mouth stirred up interest,
and the film has, since then, am
bushed the American public with a
shell storm of controversy.
Much of the controversy that has
surrounded "Platoon" is mostly the
kind of controversy that surrounds
any Vietnam film that comes out,
such as the complaints that it's not
realistic enough, it's too realistic, it

shows American troops in an un
favorable light, it shows the Viet
namese in an unfavorable light —
that kind of stuff.
In the late 19705, the first wave of
Vietnam films that brought contro
versy were the sympathetic, antiwar
films like "Coming Home," "The
Deer Hunter" and "Apocalypse
Now." About six years later, the
next phase of Vietnam films catered
to the hero-starved, right-wing
audiences that wanted to see the
United States win the war in such
films as "Uncommon Valor,"
"Missing in Action" and, of course,
"Rambo: First Blood Part Two."
With the appearance of "Platoon," a
new kind of Vietnam film is in town.
It combines the firepower and
macho action that appeals to the
"Top Gun" audiences while retain
ing the ideologies that preach that
war is a bad thing. Hie philosophy
of "Platoon" may very well be the
precursor of the next generation of
Vietnam films. Indeed, no less than
four Vietnam dramas are in the
starting gates for the coming year,
including movies by Francis Ford
Coppola and Stanley Kubrick.
So much for all the controversy.
Is "Platoon" really as good as every
one says it is? After reading about all
the hype and garish critical praise
lavished upon "Platoon," I was
more than a little anxious to see this
flick; at the same time, however, I
was more than a little skeptical.
After all, anything that pleases all
the critics can't be that good. I sub
sequently walked into the theater
half with high expectations and half
with the expectation of being let
down. I saw the movie, and al
though it didn't let me down, it
didn't strike me as the monumental
achievement everyone is talking
about. While I'll agree with every
one that it's a knockout movie, I
draw the line on it being a "major
work of art."
First of all, there is nothing terribly
original about "Platoon." It doesn't
shed any revelations about the Vietnam
experience, but that doesn't mean that
the film itself is not a riveting experi
ence. 1 was totally caught up in it. Al
though this is basically a "war is hell"
film, I've never seen a film that shows
war to be as much hell as "Platoon."
The soldiers wander through the dark,
damp, claustrophobic jungles where
the enemy can be anywhere around
them, where they are plagued with in
jects, where their feet rot inside their
shoes and where the only way to cope
is by smoking a good joint to escape
reality as much as possible.
The film was written and directed by
Oliver Stone (who wrote and directed
Salvador" and won an Oscar for his
Midnight Express" screenplay), and it
is based on his experiences as a com
bat soldier in Vietnam. While the film
lacks a defined plot, the structure con
sists of a strung-together collection of
incidents that emphasize the hap
hazard struggle for day-to-day survival.
Stone's alter-ego in the film is a soldier

named Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a
kid from a wealthy family and a well
ordered life, who drops out of college
to join the army and appease his liberal
principles. Taylor soon learns that
combat life is no bed of roses as he
finds his moral will torn apart in deter
mining his spiritual allegiance to one
of two sergeants — a bad one (Tom

Berenger) and a good one (Willem
Dafoe).
Therein lies die thematic content of
the movie, a struggle between good
and evil. Along with this struggle
comes one of the movies' main faults,
epitomized in such pretentious
dialogue as: "We did not fight the
enmy, we fought ourselves, and the

enemy was in us." It's when the movie
waxes poetic like this that it mistakenly
veers off-course from the gritty realism
already established.
The film's main problems stem from
its unevenness of intentions. It's split
between the arty pretentions of its
heavy-handed good and evil theme
and the mind-numbing reality of the

screams of dying, napalmed soldiers.
The movie is most successful when it
keeps its mouth shut about higher
meanings and operates on a basic level
by appealing to our senses through the
unrelenting, stark images that define
the meaninglessness of war. Stone
should let directors like Coppola and
Kubrick concentrate on artsiness and

rationalization. Stone's main strength
is in establishing the craziness of the
situation.
Another problem with "Platoon" is
its absence of interesting characters.
Stone's strong point is definitely not
characterization. The movie starts out
with so many soldiers in minor roles
that its hard to keep track of who is
whom. As a result, it's hard to feel sorry
for who's gotten killed, since you
couldn't tell who he was, anyway. The
anemic performance of Charlie Sheen
as the film's central character isn't
much help, so the film becomes
dominated by the presence of the two
sergeants, who are more caricatures
than characters. Still, they are the most
interesting people in the film, and they
are made even more interesting by an
inspired bit of casting that casts actors
Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe
against type.
Ultimately, the undeniable visceral
impact of the movie is due to the sheer
firepower of its indelible images — of
explosions, frenetic gun fire, soldiers
screaming and shouting unintelligible
orders. "Platoon" maintains a level of
intensity and a sense of danger that is
unmatched in any other war film. In
other words, go see it, it's a good
movie

Now." About six years later, the
next phase of Vietnam films catered
to the hero-starved, right-wing
audiences that wanted to see the
United States win the war in such
films as "Uncommon Valor,"
"Missing in Action" and, of course,
"Rambo: First Blood Part Two."
With the appearance of "Platoon," a
new kind of Vietnam film is in town.
It combines the firepower and
macho action that appeals to the
"Top Gun" audiences while retain
ing the ideologies that preach that
war is a bad thing. Hie philosophy
of "Platoon" may very well be the
precursor of the next generation of
Vietnam films. Indeed, no less than
four Vietnam dramas are in the
starting gates for the coming year,
including movies by Francis Ford
Coppola and Stanley Kubrick.
So much for all the controversy.
Is "Platoon" really as good as every
one says it is? After reading about all
the hype and garish critical praise
lavished upon "Platoon," I was
more than a little anxious to see this
flick; at the same time, however, I
was more than a little skeptical.
After all, anything that pleases all
the critics can't be that good. I sub
sequently walked into the theater
half with high expectations and half
with the expectation of being let
down. I saw the movie, and al
though it didn't let me down, it
didn't strike me as the monumental
achievement everyone is talking
about. While I'll agree with every
one that it's a knockout movie, I
draw the line on it being a "major
work of art."
First of all, there is nothing terribly
original about "Platoon." It doesn't
shed any revelations about the Vietnam
experience, but that doesn't mean that
the film itself is not a riveting experi
ence. 1 was totally caught up in it. Al
though this is basically a "war is hell"
film, I've never seen a film that shows
war to be as much hell as "Platoon."
The soldiers wander through the dark,
damp, claustrophobic jungles where
the enemy can be anywhere around
them, where they are plagued with in
jects, where their feet rot inside their
shoes and where the only way to cope
is by smoking a good joint to escape
reality as much as possible.
The film was written and directed by
Oliver Stone (who wrote and directed
Salvador" and won an Oscar for his
Midnight Express" screenplay), and it
is based on his experiences as a com
bat soldier in Vietnam. While the film
lacks a defined plot, the structure con
sists of a strung-together collection of
incidents that emphasize the hap
hazard struggle for day-to-day survival.
Stone's alter-ego in the film is a soldier

named Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a
kid from a wealthy family and a well
ordered life, who drops out of college
to join the army and appease his liberal
principles. Taylor soon learns that
combat life is no bed of roses as he
finds his moral will torn apart in deter
mining his spiritual allegiance to one
of two sergeants — a bad one (Tom

Berenger) and a good one (Willem
Dafoe).
Therein lies die thematic content of
the movie, a struggle between good
and evil. Along with this struggle
comes one of the movies' main faults,
epitomized in such pretentious
dialogue as: "We did not fight the
enmy, we fought ourselves, and the

enemy was in us." It's when the movie
waxes poetic like this that it mistakenly
veers off-course from the gritty realism
already established.
The film's main problems stem from
its unevenness of intentions. It's split
between the arty pretentions of its
heavy-handed good and evil theme
and the mind-numbing reality of the

screams of dying, napalmed soldiers.
The movie is most successful when it
keeps its mouth shut about higher
meanings and operates on a basic level
by appealing to our senses through the
unrelenting, stark images that define
the meaninglessness of war. Stone
should let directors like Coppola and
Kubrick concentrate on artsiness and

rationalization. Stone's main strength
is in establishing the craziness of the
situation.
Another problem with "Platoon" is
its absence of interesting characters.
Stone's strong point is definitely not
characterization. The movie starts out
with so many soldiers in minor roles
that its hard to keep track of who is
whom. As a result, it's hard to feel sorry
for who's gotten killed, since you
couldn't tell who he was, anyway. The
anemic performance of Charlie Sheen
as the film's central character isn't
much help, so the film becomes
dominated by the presence of the two
sergeants, who are more caricatures
than characters. Still, they are the most
interesting people in the film, and they
are made even more interesting by an
inspired bit of casting that casts actors
Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe
against type.
Ultimately, the undeniable visceral
impact of the movie is due to the sheer
firepower of its indelible images — of
explosions, frenetic gun fire, soldiers
screaming and shouting unintelligible
orders. "Platoon" maintains a level of
intensity and a sense of danger that is
unmatched in any other war film. In
other words, go see it, it's a good
movie

Vietnam, Vietnam Just when you
thought the war had been
trivialized by the likes of Chuck Mor
ris and Sylvester Stallone, along
comes "Platoon," a movie that
brings us back to horrifying reality
The movie has critics doing somer
saults and is being hyped as a Big
Deal; its already become a cliche
for reviewers to reach for the
nearest copy of Michael Herr's
Dispatches" in attempting to
describe the film. So is it really that
good'' Here are two dijfering views
on the subject
IHtimately, however, with a sub
ject as touchy as the Vietnam War, it
will be up to viewers to reach their
own judgments about "Platoon";
no movie review can hope to
resolve the issues brought up by the
movie.

"A powerful film." "It knocked
me for a loop." "Incredible." "Ten
plus, off the scale." "A great Ameri
can movie." "A major work of art."
"The best film of the year." These
are just a few of the critical ac
colades that have been used in the
movie advertisements for
"Platoon." Although I don't agree
with all these views, there's no
doubting that "Platoon" will be the
most talked-about movie of the
year.
Not many people had heard
about "Platoon" when it snuck into
theaters in limited release a few
weeks ago, in time for Oscar con
sideration. Favorable reviews and
word of mouth stirred up interest,
and the film has, since then, am
bushed the American public with a
shell storm of controversy.
Much of the controversy that has
surrounded "Platoon" is mostly the
kind of controversy that surrounds
any Vietnam film that comes out,
such as the complaints that it's not
realistic enough, it's too realistic, it

shows American troops in an un
favorable light, it shows the Viet
namese in an unfavorable light —
that kind of stuff.
In the late 19705, the first wave of
Vietnam films that brought contro
versy were the sympathetic, antiwar
films like "Coming Home," "The
Deer Hunter" and "Apocalypse
Now." About six years later, the
next phase of Vietnam films catered
to the hero-starved, right-wing
audiences that wanted to see the

jects, where their feet rot inside their
shoes and where the only way to cope
is by smoking a good joint to escape
reality as much as possible.
The film was written and directed by
Oliver Stone (who wrote and directed
Salvador" and won an Oscar for his
Midnight Express" screenplay), and it
is based on his experiences as a com
bat soldier in Vietnam. While the film
lacks a defined plot, the structure con
sists of a strung-together collection of
incidents that emphasize the hap
hazard struggle for day-to-day survival.
Stone's alter-ego in the film is a soldier

named Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a
kid from a wealthy family and a well
ordered life, who drops out of college
to join the army and appease his liberal
principles. Taylor soon learns that
combat life is no bed of roses as he
finds his moral will torn apart in deter
mining his spiritual allegiance to one
of two sergeants — a bad one (Tom

Berenger) and a good one (Willem
Dafoe).
Therein lies die thematic content of
the movie, a struggle between good
and evil. Along with this struggle
comes one of the movies' main faults,
epitomized in such pretentious
dialogue as: "We did not fight the
enmy, we fought ourselves, and the

enemy was in us." It's when the movie
waxes poetic like this that it mistakenly
veers off-course from the gritty realism
already established.
The film's main problems stem from
its unevenness of intentions. It's split
between the arty pretentions of its
heavy-handed good and evil theme
and the mind-numbing reality of the

screams of dying, napalmed soldiers.
The movie is most successful when it
keeps its mouth shut about higher
meanings and operates on a basic level
by appealing to our senses through the
unrelenting, stark images that define
the meaninglessness of war. Stone
should let directors like Coppola and
Kubrick concentrate on artsiness and

rationalization. Stone's main strength
is in establishing the craziness of the
situation.
Another problem with "Platoon" is
its absence of interesting characters.
Stone's strong point is definitely not
characterization. The movie starts out
with so many soldiers in minor roles
that its hard to keep track of who is
whom. As a result, it's hard to feel sorry
for who's gotten killed, since you
couldn't tell who he was, anyway. The
anemic performance of Charlie Sheen
as the film's central character isn't
much help, so the film becomes
dominated by the presence of the two
sergeants, who are more caricatures
than characters. Still, they are the most
interesting people in the film, and they
are made even more interesting by an
inspired bit of casting that casts actors
Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe
against type.
Ultimately, the undeniable visceral
impact of the movie is due to the sheer
firepower of its indelible images — of
explosions, frenetic gun fire, soldiers
screaming and shouting unintelligible
orders. "Platoon" maintains a level of
intensity and a sense of danger that is
unmatched in any other war film. In
other words, go see it, it's a good
movie
