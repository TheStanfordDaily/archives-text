# Exploring the photographer's mind

rhe magic in a photograph lies in its unique ability to
>{rasp those supreme instants that pass with the ticking of a
clock," said photographer Edward Weston.
I nlike other artists, photographers must be primarily
sensitive to the temporary perfection an image may attain, a
perfection that, if not immediately captured, may be lost to
our eyes forever. In the same respect, the interpretation of
that perfection is up to the individual photographer.
Several exhibits currently on display in the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art — on the corner of Van Ness and
McAllister in San Francisco — provide an excellent opportu
nity to discover a wide range of such artistic interpretation.
Supreme Instants: The Photography of Edward Weston
is a fantastic retrospective of no fewer than 250 images
captured by the artist throughout his career. This display
tills five rooms and an entire hallway in the museum.
Also on exhibit is a collection entitled "Photography: A
I acet of Modernism." Included in this intriguing assortment
.ire the works of 66 photographers from all over the world,
dating back from the beginning of modern photography in
the early 1900s.
Although the majority of the Weston photographs on dis
play are black and white, there are selected color images
produced near the end of his career. Because of their bril
liant hues and precious attention to minute detail, Weston's
color photographs are truly spectacular. The strength of this
artist, however, still remains in his ability to capture the
simple beauty of an object using only his camera and a roll
ol black and white film.
Whether he was photographing an undisturbed setting in
nature or a carefully constructed still life in his studio, Wes
h >n aimed only to capture the perfection of form as an ob

ject of beauty. The result is a harmonious blend of shape,
contour, light and shadow precisely displayed in simple
two-dimensional reproduction. A master of vision, Weston
treats us with the opportunity to look through his lens and
see the world through his own sensitively trained eyes.
Weston's serene collection of scenes and occasional
portraits is very different from the "Photography: A Facet of
Modernism" exhibit. The themes that influence the images
in this collection stem from issues concerning the modern
ization of society, from World War 1 to the present.
These photographs are each accompanied by a detailed
essay explaining not only the career of each particular artist,
but also the ideas behind each image on display. This gives
the viewer an excellent opportunity to voyage into the pho
tographer's mind and discover the significance of the ob
jects before him. This fascinating exhibit allows us to extend
our perspective beyond the actual art image to include a
deeper, more personal understanding of its value.
This collection, compiled during the past year by the
Museum of Modern An, bravely links 20th-century photo
graphy to many of the observed characteristics of modern
art. Included in the exhibit, for example, are various inter
pretations of dream imagery, Expressionism, sequential art
and mixed media.
Both collections are well worth a trip to San Francisco. Be
prepared, however, to allot at least two hours for your visit
to the museum. Both exhibits are large and, depending on
the extent of your interest, difficult to pass through just by
casting quick glances. These images were captured for the
benefit of those who did not discover them in the first place,
so don't miss them this time around!
"Supreme Instants: The Photgraphy of Edward Weston''
will continue through Feb. 15. "Photography: A Facet of
Modernism" will run through March 15.
