## Stanford rallies for 69-65 win at ASU 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
TEMPE, Ariz. — "It was an ugly win,"
Stanford forward Eric Reveno said,
"but I guess I'll take it."
Whatever it looked like, Stanford
(11-7, 5-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
came out on top 69-65 over Arizona
State (5-10, 1-6) last night following a
good second-half effort by the entire
Cardinal starting unit at the University
Activity Center.
The first half saw Stanford down 29-
23, as the Cardinal managed to shoot
only 32 percent against the ASU man
to-man defense, and the Sun Devils
weren't much better, making only 32.4
percent against the Stanford zone. Two
Cardinal starters, center Howard
Wright and point guard Terry Taylor,
did not score in the first half, and ASU
starting forward Alex Austin also
finished the half with no points. "The
first half we looked a little flat," Stan
ford Coach Mike Montgomery' said. "1
don't know if we were ready or not."
The start of the second half found
both teams with revitalized defenses.
Stanford came out in a man-to-man
defense, and ASU countered with a
zone.
"The stats are misleading,"
Montgomery said. "Arizona State shot
32 percent the first half, but they had
nine offensive rebounds. We know we
had a hard time rebounding the ball,
so we decided to try the man defense."
The man who reaped the benefits of
the decision was Reveno, who had five
rebounds in the first half starting in

place of Greg Butler (out with the flu),
and finished with 13 rebounds, a
career high. The 6-foot-8 junior added
16 points, second only to forward
Todd Lichti's 20, and also had four as
sists and two blocks.
"Reveno played a hell of a game,"
ASU Asst. Coach Herb Livsey said. "He
gives Stanford a different dimension. 1
though Eric did a hell of a job, because
he's a tough guy. And he didn't miss
two free throws — he's not a good
free-throw shooter and he always
made one." Reveno was six of 11 from
the line.
"1 thought I played well," Reveno
said. 1 keep thinking of things I could
have done better ... Terry (Taylor)
did a real good job of getting the ball
to me."
"Eric came through with 13
rebounds," Wright said. "Who could
ask for anything more?"
It was Reveno who tied the game at
43 with a free throw with 10:19 left in
the second half after Stanford had
trailed by as much as 33-25. ASU fresh
man forward Mark Becker sank an
eight-foot jumper in the lane to make it
45-43, but Novian Whitsitt canned a 12-
footer from the left baseline to bring it
to 45-45. Stanford never trailed after
that point.
ASU made it close, fighting right
down to the wire, as senior Steve Beck
sank two free throws at the 1:31 mark
to narrow the Cardinal lead to 60-58
and then hit a three-pointer from the
left of the key to cut it to 66-63 with 19
seconds left.
Taylor closed the door on the Sun

Devils, however, scoring all six of his
points in a 20-second stretch in the
final minute of the game. Taylor iced
six of six one-and-one shots, starting at
the 32-second mark, to guarantee Stan
ford the win.
"Terry Taylor is an excellent, excel
lent free-throw shooter, Montgomery
said. "You have to concentrate when
the game is on the line. He started
scoring late, hut Terry is the man you
want at the line."
Another man who had a good night
for the Cardinal was senior guard Whit
sitt, who finished S-of-8 from the floor
and 4-of-4 from the line for 14 points.
He also collected five rebounds.
"I thought the most outstanding
player on the floor was Whitsitt,'' Livsey
said.
"I think we all pulled together well
in the second half.' Whitsitt said. 1 just
tried to play tough defense and help
out on Heck.
Although Beck finished with 19
points to lead the Sun Devils, the 6-3
guard was just 7-of-20 from the floor.
Beck had scored 28 and 22 points in
his previous two outings against the
Cardinal.
"When Steve Beck has a night like
tonight," Livsey said, "we can't go
anywhere. He forced his shots.
"And it wasn't only Steve," he added.
"How many layups did we miss? And
it's night after night after night, even
when teams aren't on us.
Following Beck in scoring for ASU
was forward Mark Carlino and guard

Stanford guard Novian Whitsitt was "the most outstanding player on the
floor" last night, according to ASU Asst. Coach Herb Livsey. Whitsitt
scored 14 points in the Cardinal's f>9-65 victory over the Sun Devils.
Arthur Thomas, both with 12. Becker
scored 10, and he and Carlino both
pulled down eight rebounds to lead
the Sun Devils. "Becker has really
come along, Livsey said. "He's the one
guy that played a good game for us."
All the Stanford starters played well
in the second half, as Lichti also hit six
of six free throws and made 14 of his
20 points in the period, while Wright
scored all nine of his points in the
second half.
Card notes
Butler had not missed a start this
season and had started 29 straight
games going back to last year. In his
last three games, however, the 6-11
junior was averaging only 3 3 points
per game.
Livsey has coached the Snow Valley
Basketball School in Santa Barbara for
26 years. Three current Stanford
players have taken part in Livsey's
school — Butler, Reveno and redshirt
freshman Derek Bruton. "All of them
are great kids," Livsey said. "I've really
enjoyed knowing them. I coach an op
posing team, but it's great to see Eric
come out like this. I wish we had him.
He's going to be a great player for Stan
ford.''

second half.
Card notes
Butler had not missed a start this
season and had started 29 straight
games going back to last year. In his
last three games, however, the 6-11
junior was averaging only 3 3 points
per game.
Livsey has coached the Snow Valley
Basketball School in Santa Barbara for
26 years. Three current Stanford
players have taken part in Livsey's
school — Butler, Reveno and redshirt
freshman Derek Bruton. "All of them
are great kids," Livsey said. "I've really

TEMPE, Ariz. — "It was an ugly win,"
Stanford forward Eric Reveno said,
"but I guess I'll take it."
Whatever it looked like, Stanford
(11-7, 5-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
came out on top 69-65 over Arizona
State (5-10, 1-6) last night following a
good second-half effort by the entire
Cardinal starting unit at the University
Activity Center.
The first half saw Stanford down 29-
23, as the Cardinal managed to shoot
only 32 percent against the ASU man
to-man defense, and the Sun Devils
weren't much better, making only 32.4
percent against the Stanford zone. Two
Cardinal starters, center Howard
Wright and point guard Terry Taylor,
did not score in the first half, and ASU
starting forward Alex Austin also
finished the half with no points. "The
first half we looked a little flat," Stan
ford Coach Mike Montgomery' said. "1
don't know if we were ready or not."
The start of the second half found
both teams with revitalized defenses.
Stanford came out in a man-to-man
defense, and ASU countered with a
zone.
"The stats are misleading,"
Montgomery said. "Arizona State shot
32 percent the first half, but they had
nine offensive rebounds. We know we
had a hard time rebounding the ball,
so we decided to try the man defense."
The man who reaped the benefits of
the decision was Reveno, who had five
rebounds in the first half starting in

place of Greg Butler (out with the flu),
and finished with 13 rebounds, a
career high. The 6-foot-8 junior added
16 points, second only to forward
Todd Lichti's 20, and also had four as
sists and two blocks.
"Reveno played a hell of a game,"
ASU Asst. Coach Herb Livsey said. "He
gives Stanford a different dimension. 1
though Eric did a hell of a job, because
he's a tough guy. And he didn't miss
two free throws — he's not a good
free-throw shooter and he always
made one." Reveno was six of 11 from
the line.
"1 thought I played well," Reveno
said. 1 keep thinking of things I could
have done better ... Terry (Taylor)
did a real good job of getting the ball
to me."
"Eric came through with 13
rebounds," Wright said. "Who could
ask for anything more?"
It was Reveno who tied the game at
43 with a free throw with 10:19 left in
the second half after Stanford had
trailed by as much as 33-25. ASU fresh
man forward Mark Becker sank an
eight-foot jumper in the lane to make it
45-43, but Novian Whitsitt canned a 12-
footer from the left baseline to bring it
to 45-45. Stanford never trailed after
that point.
ASU made it close, fighting right
down to the wire, as senior Steve Beck
sank two free throws at the 1:31 mark
to narrow the Cardinal lead to 60-58
and then hit a three-pointer from the
left of the key to cut it to 66-63 with 19
seconds left.
Taylor closed the door on the Sun

Devils, however, scoring all six of his
points in a 20-second stretch in the
final minute of the game. Taylor iced
six of six one-and-one shots, starting at
the 32-second mark, to guarantee Stan
ford the win.
"Terry Taylor is an excellent, excel
lent free-throw shooter, Montgomery
said. "You have to concentrate when
the game is on the line. He started
scoring late, hut Terry is the man you
want at the line."
Another man who had a good night
for the Cardinal was senior guard Whit
sitt, who finished S-of-8 from the floor
and 4-of-4 from the line for 14 points.
He also collected five rebounds.
"I thought the most outstanding
player on the floor was Whitsitt,'' Livsey
said.
"I think we all pulled together well
in the second half.' Whitsitt said. 1 just
tried to play tough defense and help
out on Heck.
Although Beck finished with 19
points to lead the Sun Devils, the 6-3
guard was just 7-of-20 from the floor.
Beck had scored 28 and 22 points in
his previous two outings against the
Cardinal.
"When Steve Beck has a night like
tonight," Livsey said, "we can't go
anywhere. He forced his shots.
"And it wasn't only Steve," he added.
"How many layups did we miss? And
it's night after night after night, even
when teams aren't on us.
Following Beck in scoring for ASU
was forward Mark Carlino and guard

Stanford guard Novian Whitsitt was "the most outstanding player on the
floor" last night, according to ASU Asst. Coach Herb Livsey. Whitsitt
scored 14 points in the Cardinal's f>9-65 victory over the Sun Devils.
Arthur Thomas, both with 12. Becker
scored 10, and he and Carlino both
pulled down eight rebounds to lead
the Sun Devils. "Becker has really
come along, Livsey said. "He's the one
guy that played a good game for us."
All the Stanford starters played well
in the second half, as Lichti also hit six
of six free throws and made 14 of his
20 points in the period, while Wright
scored all nine of his points in the
second half.
