# Lawyer: Race tension rising
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Criticizing the actions of the Reagan administration,
civil rights attorney Eva Paterson said here last night that
the United States "is sliding backwards in race relations."
Paterson, an active proponent of affirmative action,
made her remarks in a speech and question-and-answer
session before about 80 people in Branner Hall.
"I think we're in real trouble racially in this country. It
seems we're moving backwards," Paterson said, noting
which incidents such as the December racial incident in
Howard Beach, N.Y., that left one black man dead, are
evidence of the problem.
"There is racism and sexism in America â€” let's be
real. You know that's true," she said, adding that "many
white people think of black people as animals, that we're
threatening and stupid," she said.
Paterson said the Reagan administration is "devilishly
pushing its social agenda in clear violation of the law,"
citing the administration's call for 56 cities to rescind
their consent decrees promoting the hiring of women
and minorities.
The administration twisted the Supreme Court's 1984
ruling in Memphis vs. Stotts to state that the affirmative
action movement was dead, Paterson said. In the case,
the court ruled that in situations involving employee
layoffs, seniority takes precedence over maintaining the

company's racial proportion in determining which
workers remain on the job.
That decision, however, involved only layoff situations
and not those in which employees are hired, Paterson
said, stressing that the principles of affirmative action for
hiring are still alive.
Affirmative action is -u remedy to overt discrimination
and statistical underrepresentation" of minorities and
women, Paterson said, noting that "white men have a dis
proportionate amount of goodies in society."
Stressing that affirmative action "does not mean
quotas," Patterson said companies and educational insti
tutions must "go out and find those qualified" women
and minorities.
Paterson said most employment tests administered by
companies "reflect a cultural bias" against minorities and
are non-job-related.
"I'm looking for a fair test. I haven't seen it, but it prob
ably exists," she said.
Courts have ruled today that "you may have race- and
gender-conscious remedies" when tests have an adverse
impact on minorities and women and are unrelated to
the job and when there is a long-standing history of dis
crimination, Paterson said.

In a speech at Branner Hall last night, civil rights attorney Eva Paterson accused the Reagan administra
tion of pushing U.S. race relations backward. "Racism, unfortunately, is alive and well," she said.
said Paterson, noting that there are no
women and only 79 blacks among the
1,500 firefighters.
The department did not hire its first
black until 1955, and last summer a

black firefighter was called "nigger."
"Racism, unfortunately, is alive and
well," Paterson said.
Tliere is a tendency for some whites
to think that discrimination and ine
quality no longer exist because they
know or see wealthy blacks, she said,
calling such judgments the result of the
"Diana Ross syndrome."
