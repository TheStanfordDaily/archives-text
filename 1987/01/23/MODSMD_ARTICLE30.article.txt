# Fendick, Green meet in singles
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Not having blossomed into star
players yet, freshman athletes are
often thought of as being "green."
Stanford's Lisa Green, however, is
not performing like a freshman.
Green, along with senior Patty
Fendick and junior Cari Hagey, ad
vanced yesterday to the singles
quarterfinals of the Women's Inter
collegiate Invitational tennis tourn
ament at Pacific Palisades.
Fendick and senior Stephanie
Savides won two doubles matches
yesterday to move on to the semi
finals.
The No. 7 seed in the tourna
ment, Green disposed of Trinity's
Jane Holdren 7-5, 6-2 yesterday."I
thought Lisa played the best match
I've seen her play," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said.
Unfortunately for Green and
Stanford, she will have to face
teammate Fendick, the No. 1 seed,
in today's quarterfinal.
Green knows firsthand just how
tough it is to beat the defending-
NCAA singles champion. After ad
vancing to the final of the National
Collegiate Tennis Classic, Green
was upended 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) Jan. 4 by
Fendick.
And the fiery Fendick has not
cooled off recently. Yesterday, she
didn't break a sweat in defeating
Trinity's Elvyn Barrable 6-0, 6-1.
"Patty played an exceptional
match," Brennan said. "She served
and volleyed and was off the court
in 35 minutes."
Hagey, who upset sixth-seeded
Marv Norwood of USC Wednesday,

advanced to the quarterfinals with a
hard-fought 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) victory
over California's Alissa Finerman.
Hagey will have a chance to
knock off another USC player today
in her quarterfinal match. The
Trojans' Stephanie Harges is the No.
3 seed.
Harges played No. 4 singles two
years ago for USC, hut was out of ac
tion last season for health reasons.
"Harges is not unbeatable," Bren
nan said. "She's a little bit of a ques
tion mark. (But) she must be doing
something."
Stanford's Savides wasn't doing
much of anything in her third
round singles match yesterday. She
lost 6-3, 6-1 to USC's Maeve Quin
lan.
Savides, along with Fendick,
came on strong in doubles,
however. After defeating an Arizona
State pair 6-2, 6-1 in the second
round, the Stanford pair swept Bar
rable and Jana Klepac 7-5, 6-2 to ad
vance to the semifinals.
After taking the first five games of
the first set, Fendick and Savides
lost the next five before eventually
winning the set. "Each kept her
head, and they played good, solid
tennis," Brennan said.
Hagey and freshman Valerie Wil
son played good tennis against San
Diego State's Anne Moeller and Jes
sica Buss, the third-seeded team,
but their effort was not quite good
enough as they lost 7-5, 3-6, 6-2.
Stanford's other doubles team,
Green and junior Kay Tittle, lost a
heartbreaking match to Leslie
Hakala and Michelle Taylor of Brig
ham Young, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-3), in
die second round.
