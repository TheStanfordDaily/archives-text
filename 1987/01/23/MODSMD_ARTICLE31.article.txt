## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Aiming to repeat as national cham
pions despite losing four four-year
starters to graduation, the Stanford
men's tennis team opens its season
today against Utah at the Varsity Courts
at 1:30 p.m.
The Cardinal, sixth in the preseason
national rankings, will be sporting no
less than six freshmen on its 13-man
team. However, if it jells, the young
squad will not relinquish its title easily.
"Several things have to happen for
us to live up to the preseason No. 6
team ranking, Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "1 don't want to limit our
selves to that, but we have to earn it.
"First," he said, "we need continued
improved play from our veterans. One
or two will have to make substantial
jumps in their games, which they are
capable of doing. Second, a couple of
our freshmen down the line are going
to have to make significant improve
ments.
"A third important factor is our
doubles play," Gould added. "You're
not going to win the close matches
without (that
Stanford will be led this year by
junior Patrick McEnroe. McEnroe was
ranked third in the nation among indi-
viduals who played in the fall, though it must be noted that
many top players did not play frequently enough in the fall
to be ranked. McEnroe advanced to the quarterfinals of both
the All-American Tourney in Los Angeles and the Intercol
legiate Classic in Palm Springs.
"(McEnroe) is fully capable of moving up to the No. 1 po
sition, Gould said. He is one of the many verv good
players in college tennis this year, and a good team leader as
well."
Scott Moody, who Gould said "basically won the tourna
ment for us" by winning four crucial matches at the NCAAs,
also should play a prominent role this year. Moody and
McEnroe figure to form one of the top doubles teams in the
country as well.
Two freshmen who, according to Gould, will have an im
mediate impact on the team are Jeff Tarango and Jeff
Cathrell. Tarango is already ranked 14th among fall partici
pants. Ranked fifth in singles and second in doubles as a
high school senior, Tarango won the consolation bracket of
the Intercollegiate Classic. Cathrell was ranked 11th nation
ally last year.
Other contenders for starting spots are Jordie McKee,
Mark Jacobsen (currently sidelined with a bad elbow),
Curtis Dunn and freshmen Barry Richards, Eric Peus and
Jonathan Kahn.
Utah, under new coach F.D. Robbins, was not listed in the
preseason top 20 but did receive some votes. Gould noted
that they usually play well early in the season.
