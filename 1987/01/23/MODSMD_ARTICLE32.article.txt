# Azzi leads Card to 92-77 victory
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
The Sun Devils came to town last
night, but it was gloomy outside
Maples Pavilion. And inside the gym
the Stanford women's basketball team
cast a dark cloud over Arizona State's
upset hopes.
The Cardinal turned in a steady if
unspectacular game, using a hustling,
sticky man-to-man defense, oppor
tunistic offense and sharp outside
shooting to jump out to an early lead
and then run away to a 92-77 Pacific 10
Conference victory before 250
homecourt fans.
The win moved the Cardinal's
record to 4-2 in the conference and 10-
6 overall. The Sun Devils dropped to 2-
5 in the Pac-10 and 7-8 on the year.
All of Stanford's starters made im
pressive showings in last night's game,
but freshman guard Jennifer Azzi and
junior forward Kami Anderson were
particular stalwarts.
Azzi ran the Cardinal offense ex
pertly from her point guard position,
dishing out eight assists and netting a
career-high 18 points on a shining ar
ray of drives and outside jumpers.
Anderson, meanwhile, matched
Azzi's scoring output with some nifty
long-range bombing. More important,
though, was the defensive job Ander
son did on the Sun Devils big gun,
senior forward Sherry Poole.
Poole entered last night's contest
averaging 18.1 points per game. Under
the close supervision of Anderson,
however, Poole could manage only
three field goal attempts and a meager
two points against the Cardinal.
"The defense on Poole was the key,
as far as 1 was concerned, Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "When

you take away that leading scorer,
that's the game."
But the Cardinal did plenty on the
offensive end, too. When Anderson,
Azzi or senior guard Erica Mueser
weren't burying jump shots from the
edges of the ASU zone, they were dum
ping the ball inside to freshman for
ward Katy Steding and senior center
Jill Yanke.
Steding finished the game with 17
points and six rebounds, while Yanke
chipped in 12 points and yanked down
11 boards. Mueser distributed nine as
sists to go with her 14 points.
"I thought we killed them when they
were in the zone," VanDerveer said.
"Our outside shooting was on, and we
got the ball inside fairly well."
"We've been working on our of
fense," Azzi said. "We've been con
centrating on taking our time working
the ball around."
The Cardinal may have taken its time
working the ball around, but the squad
wasted no time in working the Sun
Devils into a corner.
When Mueser took Azzi's pass for a
fastbreak layup 10 minutes into the
game, Stanford led by 10 at 24-14 and
never looked back.
The lead was still 10 at halftime.
When Anderson drove the lane for a
short jumper eight minutes into the
second half, Stanford went up by IS.
In rapid succession, Steding took a
nice feed inside from Anderson and
sank a turnaround, Yanke drilled a
similar shot off a feed by Mueser,
Steding took a long pass from Mueser
and converted a three-point play and
Anderson made a nifty follow-up on a
Steding miss.
With nine-and-a-half minutes left in
the game, Stanford led 70-48.

weren't burying jump shots from the
edges of the ASU zone, they were dum
ping the ball inside to freshman for
ward Katy Steding and senior center
Jill Yanke.
Steding finished the game with 17
points and six rebounds, while Yanke
chipped in 12 points and yanked down
11 boards. Mueser distributed nine as
sists to go with her 14 points.
"I thought we killed them when they
were in the zone," VanDerveer said.
"Our outside shooting was on, and we
got the ball inside fairly well."
"We've been working on our of
fense," Azzi said. "We've been con
centrating on taking our time working
the ball around."
The Cardinal may have taken its time
working the ball around, but the squad
wasted no time in working the Sun
Devils into a corner.
When Mueser took Azzi's pass for a
fastbreak layup 10 minutes into the
game, Stanford led by 10 at 24-14 and
never looked back.
The lead was still 10 at halftime.
When Anderson drove the lane for a
short jumper eight minutes into the
second half, Stanford went up by IS.
In rapid succession, Steding took a
nice feed inside from Anderson and
sank a turnaround, Yanke drilled a
similar shot off a feed by Mueser,
Steding took a long pass from Mueser
and converted a three-point play and
Anderson made a nifty follow-up on a
Steding miss.
With nine-and-a-half minutes left in
the game, Stanford led 70-48.
