# Fifth-ranked baseball plays opener at SJSU
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
There are certain things that have become traditional
during the week preceding the Super Bowl: a lot of betting,
even more media hvpe and maybe even a music video or
two.
But this year at Stanford, pre-Super Bowl week means
something else as well — the beginning of the college
baseball season. The Cardinal opens w hat it hopes will be its
23rd consecutive winning season today when it meets San
Jose State in a 2 p.nv game at San Jose Municipal Stadium.
A sub-.SOO record is not likely, as Coach Mark Marquess
squad is ranked fifth in the nation in the Baseball America
preseason poll. Last year the Cardinal posted a 38-23 overall
mark and finished second in the NCAA Midwest Regional,
losing to Oklahoma State.
Marquess, who has led Stanford to six straight NCAA post
season appearances, has no qualms about starting the
season before the NFL champion is crowned. By doing this,
we have less of a load playing midweek games, which helps
our kids academically, he said. "Plus, it means we don t
have to plav doubleheaders, which also helps us academi
cally."
Despite losing three of its top offensive players, John

Ramos, Walt Harris and Mark Davis, Stanford is still ranked
ahead of perennial power Oklahoma State (No. (•>) and the
last two national champions. Miami (No. ~) and Arizona (No.
IS).
"They (the pollsters) are seeing our pitching. Marquess
said. "It's certainly the strength of our team. We have a lot of
depth."
Stanford does indeed possess one of the deepest and
most talented pitching staffs in the nation, led b\ second
team All-American Jack McDowell. McDowell, who was 11*4
last year with a 2 SI ERA and 129 strikeouts, did not throw
during the summer or fall because of a sore shoulder, hut
he is now healthy.
Still, the Cardinal ace will not pitch this weekend due to a
pulled groin muscle. His arm is fine now . Marquess said.
"He was throwing at about l ) 0 miles-per-hour. but he over
did it a couple of days and pulled his groin. He's chomping
at the bit to pitch. McDowell should be available next
week.
With McDowell out, the opening da\ call will go to Lee
Plemel The junior right-hander was one of the Pacific 10
Southern Division's best pitchers b\ the end of last season,
finishing "M with a 3.36 ERA

Junior right-hander I.ee Plemel has the honor of opening the season on the mound as the Stanford baseball team
travels to San Jose State today. Jack McDowell, the Cardinal's ace, is out with a pulled groin.
McDowell and Plemel are fairly established in
the Cardinal rotation, hut the remaining starting
spot and the top relief roles may he filled hy a
variety of capable candidates. Senior Rob Was
senaar, tomorrow's starter, will probably begin
the season as the No. 3 man, but he will be
pressed by sophomores Steve Chitren, Brian
Keyser and Jim Price.
Senior Al Osuna, the staffs only southpaw,
will anchor the bullpen, and freshmen Robbie
Kamerschen and Mark Carper will also compete
for innings.
There is no question that runs will be tough to
come by against Stanford, but there is some
doubt concerning the Cardinal offense. Stanford
hit just 36 home runs last year, and the men re
sponsible for 19 of those (Davis, Ramos, Harris
and Mike Deßenon) are gone.
"We had a real mediocre year offensively,"
Marquess said. "Offense is our biggest question
mark. We have some really good players, but
they are inexperienced."
Of the nine everyday positions (including des
ignated hitter), only three seem to be decided
for the foreseeable future. All Six-Pac selection
Toi Cook, Stanford's top RBI man last year with

SO, will switch from right field to center, and
senior Ruben Amaro will make his second posi
tion change in the past two years, moving from
second base to left field. Taking Ramos' place at
catcher will be junior Doug Robbins, a .327 hit
ter last year.
The other spots will be up for grabs as the
season begins, mostly because of a freshman
class named Best in the Nation by Collegiate
Baseball, including Kamerschen, Carper, Brian
Johnson, Troy Paulsen, Paul Carey and Eric Cox.
"They're all good players," Marquess said.
"(But) no one has ever made all-league in their
first year in our league, as far I know. It's expect
ing too much to think that they'll come in and be
stars right away, but they will contribute."
Johnson, the all-time California high school
leader in hits, homers and RBIs, is currently in a
tight battle with Carey and sophomore Scott
Delucchi for the right field job. Paulsen will be
pressing both David Esquer, the starting
shortstop, and second baseman Frank Carey for
playing time.
Manning the corners for Stanford will be
sophomores Ed Sprague and Ron Witmeyer. Wit
meyer should get a strong challenge at first base
from junior transfer Jeff Saenger, a Division 111
Ail-American from Occidental College.
The Cardinal DH will likely be either Johnson,
Saenger, Delucchi or Paul Carey, depending on
who wins the other starting jobs.

squad is ranked fifth in the nation in the Baseball America
preseason poll. Last year the Cardinal posted a 38-23 overall
mark and finished second in the NCAA Midwest Regional,
losing to Oklahoma State.
Marquess, who has led Stanford to six straight NCAA post
season appearances, has no qualms about starting the
season before the NFL champion is crowned. By doing this,
we have less of a load playing midweek games, which helps
our kids academically, he said. "Plus, it means we don t
have to plav doubleheaders, which also helps us academi
cally."
Despite losing three of its top offensive players, John

Ramos, Walt Harris and Mark Davis, Stanford is still ranked
ahead of perennial power Oklahoma State (No. (•>) and the
last two national champions. Miami (No. ~) and Arizona (No.
IS).
"They (the pollsters) are seeing our pitching. Marquess
said. "It's certainly the strength of our team. We have a lot of
depth."
Stanford does indeed possess one of the deepest and
most talented pitching staffs in the nation, led b\ second
team All-American Jack McDowell. McDowell, who was 11*4
last year with a 2 SI ERA and 129 strikeouts, did not throw
during the summer or fall because of a sore shoulder, hut
he is now healthy.
Still, the Cardinal ace will not pitch this weekend due to a
pulled groin muscle. His arm is fine now . Marquess said.
"He was throwing at about l ) 0 miles-per-hour. but he over
did it a couple of days and pulled his groin. He's chomping
at the bit to pitch. McDowell should be available next
week.
With McDowell out, the opening da\ call will go to Lee
Plemel The junior right-hander was one of the Pacific 10
Southern Division's best pitchers b\ the end of last season,
finishing "M with a 3.36 ERA

Junior right-hander I.ee Plemel has the honor of opening the season on the mound as the Stanford baseball team
travels to San Jose State today. Jack McDowell, the Cardinal's ace, is out with a pulled groin.
McDowell and Plemel are fairly established in
the Cardinal rotation, hut the remaining starting
spot and the top relief roles may he filled hy a
variety of capable candidates. Senior Rob Was
senaar, tomorrow's starter, will probably begin
the season as the No. 3 man, but he will be
pressed by sophomores Steve Chitren, Brian
Keyser and Jim Price.
Senior Al Osuna, the staffs only southpaw,
will anchor the bullpen, and freshmen Robbie
Kamerschen and Mark Carper will also compete
for innings.
There is no question that runs will be tough to
come by against Stanford, but there is some
doubt concerning the Cardinal offense. Stanford
hit just 36 home runs last year, and the men re
sponsible for 19 of those (Davis, Ramos, Harris
and Mike Deßenon) are gone.
"We had a real mediocre year offensively,"
Marquess said. "Offense is our biggest question
mark. We have some really good players, but
they are inexperienced."
Of the nine everyday positions (including des
ignated hitter), only three seem to be decided
for the foreseeable future. All Six-Pac selection
Toi Cook, Stanford's top RBI man last year with

SO, will switch from right field to center, and
senior Ruben Amaro will make his second posi
tion change in the past two years, moving from
second base to left field. Taking Ramos' place at
catcher will be junior Doug Robbins, a .327 hit
ter last year.
The other spots will be up for grabs as the
season begins, mostly because of a freshman
class named Best in the Nation by Collegiate
Baseball, including Kamerschen, Carper, Brian
Johnson, Troy Paulsen, Paul Carey and Eric Cox.
"They're all good players," Marquess said.
"(But) no one has ever made all-league in their
first year in our league, as far I know. It's expect
ing too much to think that they'll come in and be
stars right away, but they will contribute."
Johnson, the all-time California high school
leader in hits, homers and RBIs, is currently in a
tight battle with Carey and sophomore Scott
Delucchi for the right field job. Paulsen will be
pressing both David Esquer, the starting
shortstop, and second baseman Frank Carey for
playing time.
Manning the corners for Stanford will be
sophomores Ed Sprague and Ron Witmeyer. Wit
meyer should get a strong challenge at first base
from junior transfer Jeff Saenger, a Division 111
Ail-American from Occidental College.
The Cardinal DH will likely be either Johnson,
Saenger, Delucchi or Paul Carey, depending on
who wins the other starting jobs.
There are certain things that have become traditional
during the week preceding the Super Bowl: a lot of betting,
even more media hvpe and maybe even a music video or
two.
But this year at Stanford, pre-Super Bowl week means
something else as well — the beginning of the college
baseball season. The Cardinal opens w hat it hopes will be its
23rd consecutive winning season today when it meets San
Jose State in a 2 p.nv game at San Jose Municipal Stadium.
