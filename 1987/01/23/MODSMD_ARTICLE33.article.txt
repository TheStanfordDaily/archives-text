### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
There are certain things that have become traditional
during the week preceding the Super Bowl: a lot of betting,
even more media hvpe and maybe even a music video or
two.
But this year at Stanford, pre-Super Bowl week means
something else as well — the beginning of the college
baseball season. The Cardinal opens w hat it hopes will be its
23rd consecutive winning season today when it meets San
Jose State in a 2 p.nv game at San Jose Municipal Stadium.
A sub-.SOO record is not likely, as Coach Mark Marquess
squad is ranked fifth in the nation in the Baseball America
preseason poll. Last year the Cardinal posted a 38-23 overall
mark and finished second in the NCAA Midwest Regional,
losing to Oklahoma State.
Marquess, who has led Stanford to six straight NCAA post
season appearances, has no qualms about starting the
season before the NFL champion is crowned. By doing this,
we have less of a load playing midweek games, which helps
our kids academically, he said. "Plus, it means we don t
have to plav doubleheaders, which also helps us academi
cally."
Despite losing three of its top offensive players, John

Ramos, Walt Harris and Mark Davis, Stanford is still ranked
ahead of perennial power Oklahoma State (No. (•>) and the
last two national champions. Miami (No. ~) and Arizona (No.
IS).
"They (the pollsters) are seeing our pitching. Marquess
said. "It's certainly the strength of our team. We have a lot of
depth."
Stanford does indeed possess one of the deepest and
most talented pitching staffs in the nation, led b\ second
team All-American Jack McDowell. McDowell, who was 11*4
last year with a 2 SI ERA and 129 strikeouts, did not throw
during the summer or fall because of a sore shoulder, hut
he is now healthy.
Still, the Cardinal ace will not pitch this weekend due to a
pulled groin muscle. His arm is fine now . Marquess said.
"He was throwing at about l ) 0 miles-per-hour. but he over
did it a couple of days and pulled his groin. He's chomping
at the bit to pitch. McDowell should be available next
week.
With McDowell out, the opening da\ call will go to Lee
Plemel The junior right-hander was one of the Pacific 10
Southern Division's best pitchers b\ the end of last season,
finishing "M with a 3.36 ERA
