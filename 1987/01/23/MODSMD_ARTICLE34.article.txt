# Card swimmers set for tough road trip
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
After a lengthy period of arduous practices and
"swim experience" meets, the Stanford men's
swimming team will be anxious to shine against
nationally ranked Arizona today and Arizona State
tomorrow on the road.
With only a loss to an emotionally charged
Texas squad — the Cardinal's first dual meet
defeat in six years — Stanford is ready to compete
once again against some high-caliber opponents.
"We're really excited to go in and see how we
can perform — almost try to show off," senior tri
captain Sam McAdam said. "No one's got a good
impression about what Stanford swimming really
is like (this year). We're sort of a big question so
far."
And while the Cardinal may be a bit mysteri
ous, Arizona remains truly puzzling. Ranked in
the top 10, the Wildcats boast several fine individ
ual swimmers, including All-America backstroker
"We should beat Arizona," McAdam said. "They
just try to develop individuals for NCAAs."
Arizona's middle and distance freestyle corps
will present the biggest challenge for Stanford.
Perhaps the most irritating challenge, however,
will be swimming in what Stanford Coach Skip

Kennev called "the slowest pool in the Pac-10."
' We are just going for the win," he said.
Kenney hopes for the same against Arizona
State — and then some. Hate is a strong word, but
it may be appropriate. Kenney hates Arizona
State, most notably their coach, Ron Johnson.
The antagonism started in Kenney's first year of
coaching at Stanford, a season in which the Card
inal did not win a single dual meet. That year, the
host Cardinal team was thoroughly defeated by a
much stronger Arizona State squad. Afterward,
the Sun Devils chose not to leave as gracious win
ners but instead delivered a humiliating cheer, in
which the team stood on the diving board and
echoed a prolonged and exaggerated "loser"
chant. Kenney has not forgotten.
"I've carried a grudge since then," Kenney said.
"You don't have to rub it in. 1 would enjoy beating
them, especially at home."
The task, however, will not be an easy one.
Arizona State defeated Texas only a week after the
Longhorns triumph over Stanford.
Oddly enough, Kenney has set the lineup as he
would for the NCAA championships. Kenney
plans on swimming Olympic butterflier Pablo
Morales in the 50-yard freestyle to continue his
speed work. Other swimmers will also enter "off
events."
