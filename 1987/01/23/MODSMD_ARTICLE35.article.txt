### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Tonight at 7:30 an international incident
may occur at Maples Pavilion when the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team opens its
home season by hosting Alberta. The Cardinal
is coming off a decisive win against the
Canadian squad last week at Davis.
"I'm really looking forward to the meet,"
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina said. "It will
be one of the more exciting meets for me as a
coach."
The reason is that Sardina will have the op
portunity to watch the whole team in action.
"I'm using every one who's fit to compete,"
he said. "There will be a cardinal team and a
white team."
Rather than dividing the squads into first
string and second string, Sardina evenly dis
tributed the strongest gymnasts. After predict
ing what each athlete could score and group
ing them, "the white team won by just one
10th of a point.

"Both teams will score well at the same
time," Sardina added. "We want to improve
on the 170.6," the Cardinal's first-meet record
garnered last weekend.
At Davis, Stanford faced a weakened Alberta
squad, which struggled to earn a 137.7 total
and was bolstered by Michelle Hanneman's
fifth-place finish in the all-around. "Alberta
will have a full lineup and will be con
siderably stronger this week," Sardina said.
As for the Cardinal, the freshmen who
made their collegiate debut last Saturday will
be joined by their veteran teammates. Among
those competing for the first time this season
are senior Nanci Goldsmith, junior Beth Pope
and sophomores Cheryl Doo and Jinny Rhee.
Two gymnasts, however, will not warm up
tonight. "Our sleeper Marietta Frey is going to
remain a sleeper for a while," Sardina said.
Frey, a freshman from Lexington, Mass.,
severely lacerated her left leg on the uneven
parallel bars in practice earlier this month.
"We also won't have Laurence George, who

we'll obviously miss," Sardina added. "She
was our leading beam scorer last year." The
sophomore from Wellesley, Mass., will be
sidelined due to a back injury.
Nonetheless, the gymnastics team remains
a strong one. "The energy on the team is tre
mendous," Sardina said. "There is good
chemistry. This is a team the University can be
proud of."
As for the competition, "It will be a dogfight
(among Stanford gymnasts) on the same
event,"he added.
"On the vault it will be between Dina
Amoroso and Beth Pope. On bars, Beth and
Jinny Rhee, though Alison McGann's looking
pretty good. On beam, Jinny Rhee and Dina,
but you never know with Nanci Goldsmith
and Cheryl Doo. On floor," Sardina said,
"Dina will be hard to beat.
"It's going to be an exciting and entertain
ing group. I'm thoroughly pleased with how
we're going, and hopefully we'll reach our
true potential this year."
