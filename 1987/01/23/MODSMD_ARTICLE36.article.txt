# Spikers in Santa Barbara for Michelob tournament
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Beginning the season with a 1-0
record and a No. 7 national ranking,
the Stanford men's volleyball team will
play in the UCSB/Michelob Light Col
legiate Invitational today and tomor
row at UC-Santa Barbara.
With 19 other teams from California,
Arizona, Utah and Canada on hand, the
Cardinal will have the chance to play
an array of teams and see its league
competition in action.
In 1985, Stanford won the tourna
ment for the first time. "Winning the
tournament was the brightest moment
in Stanford volleyball history," Stan
ford Coach Fred Sturm said.
He said he sees two major purposes
for playing in the tournament: "First,
we need some match time together.
This is an opportunity to play a lot of
games in two days."

Sturm said he has not yet established
a team of six starters who feel comfort
able as a unit because he feels the team
needs more practice and match time
together.
"Also, the tournament will give us a
good chance to look at our conference
opponents. It is a nice opportunity for
us," He added. Nine teams from the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation will be in the Invitational;
only Pepperdine, San Diego State and
Hawaii will not be there.
Stanford will play four matches
within its pool today at the UCSB
Events Center: Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo at 10:15 a.m., USC at 12:45 p.m.,
Humboldt State at 3:15 p.m. and UC-
Santa Cruz at 4:30 p.m.
Matches will be two out of three
games. The top two teams in each of
the four pools will advance to compete
for the first eight spots in the tourna
ment. The eight advancing teams will

be divided into two pools, where they
will play two more games.
USC and Stanford are favored to ad
vance to the final eight, where they
could play the two favorites â€” UCLA
and Calgary.
The top two teams from each of
these two pools will enter the semi
finals. The third- and fourth-place finis
hers will enter semifinals to decide
fifth through eighth places.
The championship match will be
played tomorrow evening. The time
has not been announced.
Sturm was not sure what to expect
from the Cardinal in the tournament.
"There are still things about the team
I'm learning everyday. There's a lot
more things I don't know about them
than I do know," said Sturm, who lost
four veterans this year to graduation
and is faced with working with a team
that "isn't as clear as in years past."
