# Fencers host Air Force, Fullerton St.
## 
### 
If Stanford Fencing Coach Buzz Hurst were to predict the
outcomes of the Cardinal's matches today at Roble Gym
against Fullerton State and the U.S. Air Force Academy, he
would probably say the Stanford men and women will han
dle the hullerton Titans fairly easily but will struggle against
the Air Force Falcons.
Hurst, however, is sticking to coaching this season and,
because he has two inexperienced squads, has given up
predicting the fates of his teams.
"This is not a year for me to predict — at least accurately,"
the Stanford coach said as he prepared for today's 4 p.m.
match with Fullerton and 7 p.m. match against Air Force.
Nevertheless, Hurst was optimistic about Stanford's
chances against the Titans. "They graduated most of their
people last year, and we beat them pretty decisively last
year."
Air Force, however, is perennially one of the top teams on
the West Coast. Last season, the Cardinal men — with what
Hurst called "a considerably stronger squad'' than this year's
team — had to go to the final duel to beat the Falcons 14-13.
The Stanford women handled Air Force 12-4 last season,
but, Hurst added, "We're not as strong this year."
