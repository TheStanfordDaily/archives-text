# Women, minorities lacking in faculty
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
Women and minorities are still un
der represented on the Stanford fac
ulty, according to the Affirmative Ac
tion Report presented to the Faculty
Senate yesterday by acting University
President James Rosse.
The report stated that tenured
female professors make up only 10.3
percent of the the tenured Stanford
faculty. There are 135 tenured female
professors out of a total of 1,315 pro
fessors at Stanford.
Ninety-six minority faculty at Stan
ford account for 7.3 percent of the
tenured faculty. The report identifies
blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native
Americans as minorities.
In presenting the report, Rosse said
the percentages are "not bad when
compared to other institutions, but are
very small when you compare them to
the number of minority and women
students here."
Compared to Harvard and Yale,
Rosse said, Stanford does "as well or
better in recruitment of blacks ...
(and) better with Hispanics." He attrib
uted part of Stanford's success in

recruiting Hispanics to its California lo
cation.
Compared to the University of
California-Berkeley, however, Stan
ford's minority recruitment is defi
cient, he said. Berkeley "does slightly
better than we do" in recruiting blacks,
women and Asians, Rosse said.
Recounting the history of affirmative
action at Stanford, Rosse cited the 1968
assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
as an important impetus for minority
recruitment here. The assasination was
"truly an emotional turning point in
this University's history" in terms of its
commitment to affirmative action,
Rosse said.
Since 1971, the percentage of
tenured female professors at Stanford
has increased by 6 percent, while the
number of tenured minority faculty
has risen 3.6 percent.
Rosse pointed out that the next
several years will be crucial in estab
lishing a more representative faculty.
Because many of the current genera
tion of faculty members will be retiring
soon, if a significant number of the
vacancies are not filled by women and
minorities, it will be many more years
before such openings will occur again.
"Stanford has come a fair distance in
fulfilling the commitment of '68, but
we shouldn't become satisfied,' Rosse
said.
The report stated that women and
minority faculty are better represented
in the professional schools and the so
cial science and humanities depart
ments. There are comparatively fewer
women and minority faculty in the nat
ural science departments, the report
said.
Rosse gave several reasons for Stan
ford's support of affirmative action.
Besides serving as a remedy for past in
justices, Rosse said Stanford's affirma
tive action policy provides for the "full
development of human potential" of
people who might otherwise be
denied this opportunity."
"All of us ask for fair treatment of
human beings ... (and) we at Stanford
take a lead in changing cultural values"
in the United States, he said.
The report also examined the per
centages of women and minorities

making up Stanford's student body and
staff.
Of freshmen entering Stanford in
1986, 42.2 percent were women. There
were 664 women in a freshman class of
1,575 students.
Slightly more than 30 percent of the
freshmen entering in 1986 were
minorities. One hundred two (6.5 per
cent) were black, 126 (8.0 percent)
were Hispanic, 245 (15.6) were Asian,
and 13 (.8 percent) were Native Ameri
can.
Rosse noted that Stanford takes a
particular interest in affirmative action
in its admissions policy. A self
interested reason (for Stanford's af
firmative action admissions policy) is
that we're trying to attract here the fu
ture leaders of this country. Many of
these leaders will be women and
minorities, and its in our interest to
have educated them," Rosse said.
Rudy Fuentes, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said Stanford
should further develop its
"ambassador program," which encour
ages minority recruitment in high
schools across the country. Fuentes
also urged greater development of eth
nic studies programs at Stanford,
which he said would help attract
minority students.
