# Women, minorities lacking in faculty
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
Women and minorities are still un
der represented on the Stanford fac
ulty, according to the Affirmative Ac
tion Report presented to the Faculty
Senate yesterday by acting University
President James Rosse.
The report stated that tenured
female professors make up only 10.3
percent of the the tenured Stanford
faculty. There are 135 tenured female
professors out of a total of 1,315 pro
fessors at Stanford.
Ninety-six minority faculty at Stan
ford account for 7.3 percent of the
tenured faculty. The report identifies
blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native
Americans as minorities.
In presenting the report, Rosse said
the percentages are "not bad when
compared to other institutions, but are
very small when you compare them to
the number of minority and women
students here."
Compared to Harvard and Yale,
Rosse said, Stanford does "as well or
better in recruitment of blacks ...
(and) better with Hispanics." He attrib
uted part of Stanford's success in

recruiting Hispanics to its California lo
cation.
Compared to the University of
California-Berkeley, however, Stan
ford's minority recruitment is defi
cient, he said. Berkeley "does slightly
better than we do" in recruiting blacks,
women and Asians, Rosse said.
Recounting the history of affirmative
action at Stanford, Rosse cited the 1968
assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
as an important impetus for minority
recruitment here. The assasination was
"truly an emotional turning point in
this University's history" in terms of its
commitment to affirmative action,
Rosse said.
Since 1971, the percentage of
tenured female professors at Stanford
has increased by 6 percent, while the
number of tenured minority faculty
has risen 3.6 percent.
Rosse pointed out that the next
several years will be crucial in estab
lishing a more representative faculty.
Because many of the current genera
tion of faculty members will be retiring
soon, if a significant number of the
vacancies are not filled by women and
