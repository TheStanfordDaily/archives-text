# Fac Sen backs open research principle
## Super Bowl may return in 1991 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday reaf
firmed Stanford's principle of open
ness in research by approving a modi
fication of University research policy.
In other senate business, acting Uni
versity President James Rosse pre
sented the annual Affirmative Action
Report, announced the future creation
of a Martin Luther King Jr. professor
ship and also announced the possibil
ity that the Super Bowl will return to
Stanford Stadium in 1991.
The modification in research policy

addressed the issue of whether outside
sponsors of research projects can
impose brief delays in the publication
of research results in order to review
and comment on manuscripts. The
1985-86 Comittee on Research (CRES)
was charged by the senate last year to
modify existing research guidelines
that were "silent" on this issue, accord
ing to Medical School Dean David
Korn, last year's committtee chair.
The amended wording, approved
unanimously by the senate, allows for
delays of up to 90 days in publication
for patenting purposes or for sponsor
review of manuscripts, "providing that
no basis exists at the beginning of the
project to expect that the sponsor
would attempt either to suppress
publication or to impose substantive
changes in the manuscript."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz raised
the issue that the policy will do noth
ing to prevent {he government from
classifying research. The government
would only have to wait until a project
proceeds and then to classify it, he
said. "They can develop the inten
tion. ... They're not naive," he said.
Acting Provost Robert Street, dean of
research and Academic Information
Services, said such government action
could occur, but that he knew "of no
pattern where we have been led down
the garden path ."
"If we find a major effort at classifica
tion for a particular line of research
that had been led into something as
unclassified we would be led to halt
the research (because of the modified
policy)," Street said. "If we found an
agency which was following the pat

tern of (suppressing research) ... we
would be forced not to open up any
contracts with them."
Patricia Devaney, associate dean of
research, said that federal law, to an ex
tent, limits the University's ability to
resist classification. "There is no policy
that we can assert that will keep the
government from the right to classify.
However, she said the University
would refuse classified research at the
outset and would halt research that
became classified.
Physics Prof. Arthur Schalow said the
high quality of University research
prevents project sponsors from placing
limits on research.
"We really do have quite a strong
defense against the government or
anyone else imposing secrecy, because
you make it plain that if they try to get
the golden egg, the goose won't lay it
anymore," said Schalow. "So they're
very reluctant, unless they have strong
reasons, to impose secrecy."
Rosse said the approved modifica
tion "does not change the basic thrust
of the act (for openness in research)."
Though the senate had also charged
the CRES to address the issue of con
flict of interest, no evidence was ever
brought to the committee that any
problems warranted "consideration or

modification or expansion of existing
University policies and guidelines."
The committee's deliberations also
"prompted the dean of research to
conduct an audit of outside consulting
activities among a sample of faculty,
currently underway, Korn said.
Earlier in the meeting, Rosse an
nounced that four donors have
pledged $500,000 toward an endowed
professorship honoring Martin Luther
King Jr. The total needed for the King
professorship is $1 million, and gifts to
establish the professorship will be
placed in an endowment fund, whose
income will be used to defray the
salary and research expenses of the ap
pointed professor.
Rosse said the terms of the agree
ment for the 1985 Super Bowl —
which was played at Stanford — re
quired the acceptance of future Super
Bowls. San Francisco and other Bay-
Area cities and counties will bid in
February for Super Bowl XXV in 1991,
Rosse told the senate.
Stanford Stadium is the only Bay
Area stadium that meets the minimum
parking and seating requirements, he
said, adding that the University ac
cepted the Super Bowl proposal on the
condition that it will result in "no costs
to Stanford."

Acting Provost Robert Street, dean of
research and Academic Information
Services, said such government action
could occur, but that he knew "of no
pattern where we have been led down
the garden path ."
"If we find a major effort at classifica
tion for a particular line of research
that had been led into something as
unclassified we would be led to halt
the research (because of the modified
policy)," Street said. "If we found an
agency which was following the pat

tern of (suppressing research) ... we
would be forced not to open up any
contracts with them."
Patricia Devaney, associate dean of
research, said that federal law, to an ex
tent, limits the University's ability to
resist classification. "There is no policy
that we can assert that will keep the
government from the right to classify.
However, she said the University
would refuse classified research at the
outset and would halt research that
became classified.
Physics Prof. Arthur Schalow said the
high quality of University research
prevents project sponsors from placing
limits on research.
"We really do have quite a strong
defense against the government or
anyone else imposing secrecy, because
you make it plain that if they try to get
the golden egg, the goose won't lay it
anymore," said Schalow. "So they're
very reluctant, unless they have strong
reasons, to impose secrecy."
Rosse said the approved modifica
tion "does not change the basic thrust
of the act (for openness in research)."
Though the senate had also charged
the CRES to address the issue of con
flict of interest, no evidence was ever
brought to the committee that any
problems warranted "consideration or

modification or expansion of existing
University policies and guidelines."
The committee's deliberations also
"prompted the dean of research to
conduct an audit of outside consulting
activities among a sample of faculty,
currently underway, Korn said.
Earlier in the meeting, Rosse an
nounced that four donors have
pledged $500,000 toward an endowed
professorship honoring Martin Luther
King Jr. The total needed for the King
professorship is $1 million, and gifts to
establish the professorship will be
placed in an endowment fund, whose
income will be used to defray the
salary and research expenses of the ap
pointed professor.
Rosse said the terms of the agree
ment for the 1985 Super Bowl —
which was played at Stanford — re
quired the acceptance of future Super
Bowls. San Francisco and other Bay-
Area cities and counties will bid in
February for Super Bowl XXV in 1991,
Rosse told the senate.
Stanford Stadium is the only Bay
Area stadium that meets the minimum
parking and seating requirements, he
said, adding that the University ac
cepted the Super Bowl proposal on the
condition that it will result in "no costs
to Stanford."
The Faculty Senate yesterday reaf
firmed Stanford's principle of open
ness in research by approving a modi
fication of University research policy.
In other senate business, acting Uni
versity President James Rosse pre
sented the annual Affirmative Action
Report, announced the future creation
of a Martin Luther King Jr. professor
ship and also announced the possibil
ity that the Super Bowl will return to
Stanford Stadium in 1991.
The modification in research policy

addressed the issue of whether outside
sponsors of research projects can
impose brief delays in the publication
of research results in order to review
and comment on manuscripts. The
1985-86 Comittee on Research (CRES)
was charged by the senate last year to
modify existing research guidelines
that were "silent" on this issue, accord
ing to Medical School Dean David
Korn, last year's committtee chair.
The amended wording, approved
unanimously by the senate, allows for
delays of up to 90 days in publication
for patenting purposes or for sponsor
review of manuscripts, "providing that
no basis exists at the beginning of the
project to expect that the sponsor
would attempt either to suppress
publication or to impose substantive
changes in the manuscript."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz raised
the issue that the policy will do noth
ing to prevent {he government from
classifying research. The government
would only have to wait until a project
proceeds and then to classify it, he
said. "They can develop the inten
tion. ... They're not naive," he said.
