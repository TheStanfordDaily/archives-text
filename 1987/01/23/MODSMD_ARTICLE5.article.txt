# Fac Sen backs open research principle
## Super Bowl may return in 1991 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday reaf
firmed Stanford's principle of open
ness in research by approving a modi
fication of University research policy.
In other senate business, acting Uni
versity President James Rosse pre
sented the annual Affirmative Action
Report, announced the future creation
of a Martin Luther King Jr. professor
ship and also announced the possibil
ity that the Super Bowl will return to
Stanford Stadium in 1991.
The modification in research policy

addressed the issue of whether outside
sponsors of research projects can
impose brief delays in the publication
of research results in order to review
and comment on manuscripts. The
1985-86 Comittee on Research (CRES)
was charged by the senate last year to
modify existing research guidelines
that were "silent" on this issue, accord
ing to Medical School Dean David
Korn, last year's committtee chair.
The amended wording, approved
unanimously by the senate, allows for
delays of up to 90 days in publication
