A new official logo has been developed by
the Centennial Celebration Operating Commit
tee (CCOC) to identify the materials related to
Cornerstone Weekend, a three-day celebration
of Stanford's 100-year anniversary.
In other Centennial news, departments
throughout the University are planning how
they will use their shares of the projected $1
billion fund-raising goal.

Cornerstone Weekend, a three-day celebra
tion to commemorate the laying of Stanford's
cornerstone a century ago, will be held May 14-
16.
David Gardner, president of the University of
California system, and Morley Safer of CBS tele
vision's "60 Minutes" are among those
tentatively committed to speak during the
weekend's programs, according to Stephen
Peeps, CCOC's executive director.
The myriad events planned for the weekend
involve different themes and approaches to the

-100-year anniversary. The CCOC developed the
official Centennial logo to tie the programs and
related materials together.
Peeps said the plaque signifies tradition and
the new Stanford "S" represents the spirit of
the future, thus mixing the traditional and
festive, commemorating Stanford's past while
celebrating the spirit of moving into the fu
ture."
The CCOC plans to register the logo, hut will
withhold licensing it for commercial purposes
until later in the Centennial period. Although

the CCOC will control application of the logo,
the committee plans to encourage wide use of
it.
Stanford's tentative goal is to raise $1 billion
before the University's 100-year anniversary in
October 1991.
The Board of Trustees will determine the ex
act goal at its Feb. 10 meeting, according to
Diana Diamond, assistant director of University
Relations for the Office of Public Affairs.
"It's no secret that there's a Centennial cam
paign (to raise the $1 billion) which will be an

nounced," said David Fulton, director of com
munications for the University Office of Devel
opment.
"It's going to be a very ambitious campaign
in terms of monetary goals and the purposes
for which the money will be sought," Fulton
said.
Fulton would not confirm a date for the an
nouncement, which will include the fund
raising goal and the proposed uses for the
funds.
If the entire sum is raised, the Uni
versity plans to spend $180 million for
redeveloping the Near West science
and engineering campus. Another
$160 million would go towards 100
endowed professorships.
According to John Kates, director of

development for the Athletic Depart
ment, his department stands to gain
from the Centennial and has several of
ficial goals.
"At this point one of our high
priorities is endowed athletic scholar

ships," Kates said.
Combining both full and partial ath
letic scholarships, Kates estimated that
the University currently has the equiva
lent of 275 "full-ride" scholarships,
which cover room, board, tuition and
books.
Ideally, the Athletic Department
would like to be able to endow all of
its scholarships, Kates said.
"We would love to not have that
pressure each year to raise the
money," Kates said.
The Athletic Department is hoping
to raise up to $15 million on new
facilities, according to Kates.
A new Encina gymnasium, a refur
bished Old Pavilion and an athletic
quadrangle connecting the current
Athletic Department building, Encina
gym and the Old Pavilion are among
the proposals for use of the funds,
The Athletics Department also hopes
to endow coaching positions and cover
the costs of sending teams to NCAA
post-season competition, according to
Kates.
"We sent over a dozen teams to the
NCAA post-season competition last
year. That cost in excess of $100,000
which had to come out of our budget,"
Kates said.
Residential Education also has plans
for their share of the funds. Four years
of guaranteed housing for all under
graduates is the highest objective, ac
cording to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
The University hopes to build new
housing for 400 students by 1991,
Lyons said.
