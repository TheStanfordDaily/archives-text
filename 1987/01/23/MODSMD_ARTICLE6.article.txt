A new official logo has been developed by
the Centennial Celebration Operating Commit
tee (CCOC) to identify the materials related to
Cornerstone Weekend, a three-day celebration
of Stanford's 100-year anniversary.
In other Centennial news, departments
throughout the University are planning how
they will use their shares of the projected $1
billion fund-raising goal.

Cornerstone Weekend, a three-day celebra
tion to commemorate the laying of Stanford's
cornerstone a century ago, will be held May 14-
16.
David Gardner, president of the University of
California system, and Morley Safer of CBS tele
vision's "60 Minutes" are among those
tentatively committed to speak during the
weekend's programs, according to Stephen
Peeps, CCOC's executive director.
The myriad events planned for the weekend
involve different themes and approaches to the

-100-year anniversary. The CCOC developed the
official Centennial logo to tie the programs and
related materials together.
Peeps said the plaque signifies tradition and
the new Stanford "S" represents the spirit of
the future, thus mixing the traditional and
festive, commemorating Stanford's past while
celebrating the spirit of moving into the fu
ture."
The CCOC plans to register the logo, hut will
withhold licensing it for commercial purposes
until later in the Centennial period. Although

the CCOC will control application of the logo,
the committee plans to encourage wide use of
it.
Stanford's tentative goal is to raise $1 billion
before the University's 100-year anniversary in
October 1991.
The Board of Trustees will determine the ex
act goal at its Feb. 10 meeting, according to
Diana Diamond, assistant director of University
Relations for the Office of Public Affairs.
"It's no secret that there's a Centennial cam
paign (to raise the $1 billion) which will be an

nounced," said David Fulton, director of com
munications for the University Office of Devel
opment.
"It's going to be a very ambitious campaign
in terms of monetary goals and the purposes
for which the money will be sought," Fulton
said.
Fulton would not confirm a date for the an
nouncement, which will include the fund
raising goal and the proposed uses for the
funds.
