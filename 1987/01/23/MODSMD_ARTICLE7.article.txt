# More frosh want PhDs
## Class has highest educational aspirations ever 
### ERIC RICHARDSON Staff writer 
Current Stanford freshmen have
higher educational aspirations than
uny previous Stanford class, according
to a new national survey.
One-third of current Stanford fresh
men plan to earn a doctorate, an all
time Stanford high. Overall, 97 percent
of Stanford freshmen surveyed said
they planned to earn some type of ad
vanced degree.
In another finding, 97 percent of
Stanford freshmen said they had been
bored in high school.
The increase in the number of Stan
ford freshmen planning to pursue doc
torates bucked a national decrease
revealed by the survey of nearly
300.000 freshman at SS2 colleges and
universities. The surveys were con
ducted by the Higher Education Re
search Institute at I'CLA.
In comparison with other private
universities, more Stanford freshmen
said they planned on seeking doc
torates.
At other private institutions sur

veyed, the proportion of freshmen
seeking doctorates declined — from
20 to 18 percent. At the same time, the
proportion of freshmen at private uni
versities seeking only a bachelor's or
master's degree increased from 44 to
S7 percent.
By comparison, 9.3 percent of fresh
men at the University of California-
Berkeley said they intended to earn a
doctorate. About half the Berkeley
freshmen plan to pursue an advanced
degree of any type, the Office of Stu
dent Research at Berkeley reported.
According to Marilyn Schalit, a staff
associate at I'QAs Higher Education
Research Institute, the nationwide
percentage of women pursuing ad
vanced degrees has increased dramati
cally in comparison with previous
years. Since 1970, the percentage of
women seeking medical degrees has
increased 2 7 0 percent while the num
ber pursuing law degrees has quad
rupled. she said.
Nationally, the percentage of men
seeking advanced degrees (medical,
law and academic doctorates) has
decreased across the board.

The survey also asked students
about their reasons for attending the
college that they chose.
Ninety-seven percent of Stanford
students surveyed — another all-time
high — mentioned Stanford's "good
academic reputation" as influencing
their choice. Fifty-nine percent of Stan
ford students emphasized that Stanford
alumni are accepted into the top
graduate schools nationally.
In addition, 61 percent noted that
Stanford "grads get good jobs" while
34 percent mentioned that the Univer
sity's "good social reputation" per
suaded them to come to Stanford.
While almost one-third of this year's
Stanford freshmen were accepted by
five or more institutions, only two per
cent said Stanford was their third
choice or lower.
Stanford freshmen were also asked
about their current needs and goals
within the Stanford community. More
than two-thirds said it was "essential
that Stanford nurture individual well
being and happiness. Only 62 percent
