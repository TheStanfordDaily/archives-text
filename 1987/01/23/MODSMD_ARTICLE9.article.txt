UC head issues rape statement
BERKELEY — University of California Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman
has issued his strongest statement on acquintance rape, a major issue on
campus since an alleged attack by four football players.
In an appeal mailed directly to 31,000 students on Wednesday, Heyman
said acquaintance rape "degrades its victims, our campus community and
society at large."
The letter is accompanied by a brochure defining acquaintance rape as
"sexual intercourse undertaken by a friend or acquaintance without the
consent of the woman." Hie brochure also lists ways to avoid circum
stances that might lead to rape and places to call for help.
"I can't remember anything like this in recent years," said campus
spokesman Ray Colvig. It serves to point out that the chancellor considers
the issue to be extraordinary."
Assistant Chancellor Lola Harris said she believes it is the first direct ap
peal to students the chancellor has issued in his six years in office.
Campus police have released statistics showing that 11 rapes had been
reported within their jurisdiction in 1986, double the previous year's fig
ures.
The alleged assault by the athletes took place in September after a party
in a dorm complex near campus.
The players were not prosecuted by the Alameda County District Attor
ney's Office, which said there was not enough evidence.
The players had to apologize to the woman, undergo counseling, move
from the dorm and do community service work as part of a settlement of
the student conduct case. The settlement was approved by the woman, the
players and the university.
Soldiers fire on demonstrators
MANILA, Philippines — Government soldiers opened fire on thousands
of leftist peasant demonstrators as they approached the presidential palace
yesterday, killing at least 12 of them and wounding more than 50. It was the
worst incident of violence in Manila since President Corazon Aquino took
power 11 months ago.
Within hours of the shooting, Communist rebels suspended peace talks
aimed at ending their 18-year insurgency. They described the incident as
"part of a pattern of military action" aimed at destroying their movement
and destabilizing the nation.
The military accused the political left of provoking the shootings in an ef
fort to destabilize the government 10 days before a national referendum on
a new constitution that the Communists have rejected.
After a three-hour meeting with her military leaders yesterday night,
Aquino said she expected her opponents to exploit the incident in an effort
to defeat the new constitution.
The shooting, which threatened to plunge Aquino's young government
into its worst crisis yet, began after 10,000 members of a highly organized
leftist farmer's movement marched toward Malacanang Palace to demand
an equitable distribution of farmland and food for the poor.
Policy contradictions revealed
WASHINGTON — Despite the Reagan administration's avowed policy
against yielding to terrorist demands, a U.S. official pressured Kuwait to
free 17 Shia Moslem prisoners whose release was demanded by Iran as
• part of the effort to *win the freedom of Americans held in Lebanon, a con
gressional source said yesterday.
Secretary of State George Shultz was said to have learned of the apparent
contradiction with the administration's official policy after State Depart
ment and CIA officials met with Iranian representatives in early December.
Shultz's testimony Wednesday, which disclosed several recent and star
tling developments in U.S. dealings with Iran, has raised new questions
about Reagan's control of the Iranian policy and led to criticism of Shultz's
own vigor in attempting to take control of U.S. initiatives toward the Tehran
regime.
As earlier reported, Shultz. had also told that panel that the administra
tion had continued to negotiate with Tehran well into December, more
than a month after controversy erupted over secret sales of U.S. arms to
Iran.
China fires prominent scientists
PEKING — China yesterday fired two of the nation's most prominent sci
entists from their jobs at the head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in
what diplomats termed an outgrowth of the ongoing Communist Party
campaign against "bourgeois liberalization."
The standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, said that both Lu Jiaxi, the president of the academy, and Yan
Dongsheng, who has been both a vice president and the academy's Com
munist Party boss, have been removed from their government posts.
At the same time, the committee concluded a 10-day session without set
tling any of the unanswered questions about China's future political leader
ship. It did not choose any successor for Premier Zhao Ziyang, who
became acting general secretary of the Communist Party when Hu Yaobang
resigned as party chief last week.
Lu and Yan are the high est-ranking in a series of scientists and other in
tellectuals who have been removed from their jobs or purged from the
Communist Party in recent weeks.
Violence threatened in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The United Democratic Front, the
largest coalition of anti-apartheid groups in South Africa, warned yesterday
that it might soon be forced to abandon peaceful resistance to the country's
white-led minority government and turn to violence.
In an open letter to U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, the organiza
tion called on the West, particularly the United States, to increase its pres
sure on South Africa to end apartheid, the system of racial separation and
minority white rule, before the already extensive political violence esc
alates.
We are being forced into a situation where all methods of resistance
must be considered," Murphy Morobe, the front's principal spokesman,
said in the letter to Shultz. "The United Democratic Front and the legal op
position movement are being thrust by the unrelenting repression of the
regime into a position where they may have to review their non-violent
principles.
The letter to Shultz, made public by Morobe, was the gravest warning yet
that leaders of the United Democratic Front, like those of the African Na
tional Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania before it, might
turn to violence if they feel that their peaceful protests are failing and that
(he government is determined to crush such opposition. The ANC and Pan-
Africanist Congress, once legal organizations, were both outlawed in 1960.
Confidence in Reagan declines
WASHINGTON — Two-thirds of Americans say they think that President
Reagan is not doing all he can to determine the facts in the Iran contro
versy. according to a Washington Post-ABC News Poll.
The survey showed sharply increased public skepticism about White
House handling of the Iran arms-sale affair and gave Reagan his lowest
mark ever in the poll for his conduct of foreign affairs.
Reagan has repeatedly asserted that he wants all the facts to come out"
in the Iran matter and has promised to cooperate with congressional com
mittees and an independent counsel investigating the arms deal and the ap
parent diversion of some of the proceeds to aid Nicaraguan contras.
The number of Americans who say they think Reagan is telling the truth
also has declined. In the ABC poll last month. Americans were almost
evenly split on this question, with 4" percent saving he was being truthful
about the Iran situation and 49 percent saying he was not. Currently, only
41 percent of Americans say they think he is telling the truth, while 56 per
cent do not

that it might soon be forced to abandon peaceful resistance to the country's
white-led minority government and turn to violence.
In an open letter to U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, the organiza
tion called on the West, particularly the United States, to increase its pres
sure on South Africa to end apartheid, the system of racial separation and
minority white rule, before the already extensive political violence esc
alates.
We are being forced into a situation where all methods of resistance
must be considered," Murphy Morobe, the front's principal spokesman,
said in the letter to Shultz. "The United Democratic Front and the legal op
position movement are being thrust by the unrelenting repression of the
regime into a position where they may have to review their non-violent
principles.
The letter to Shultz, made public by Morobe, was the gravest warning yet
that leaders of the United Democratic Front, like those of the African Na
tional Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania before it, might
turn to violence if they feel that their peaceful protests are failing and that
(he government is determined to crush such opposition. The ANC and Pan-
Africanist Congress, once legal organizations, were both outlawed in 1960.
Confidence in Reagan declines
WASHINGTON — Two-thirds of Americans say they think that President
Reagan is not doing all he can to determine the facts in the Iran contro
versy. according to a Washington Post-ABC News Poll.
The survey showed sharply increased public skepticism about White
House handling of the Iran arms-sale affair and gave Reagan his lowest
mark ever in the poll for his conduct of foreign affairs.
Reagan has repeatedly asserted that he wants all the facts to come out"
in the Iran matter and has promised to cooperate with congressional com
mittees and an independent counsel investigating the arms deal and the ap
parent diversion of some of the proceeds to aid Nicaraguan contras.
The number of Americans who say they think Reagan is telling the truth
also has declined. In the ABC poll last month. Americans were almost
evenly split on this question, with 4" percent saving he was being truthful
about the Iran situation and 49 percent saying he was not. Currently, only
41 percent of Americans say they think he is telling the truth, while 56 per
cent do not

UC head issues rape statement
BERKELEY — University of California Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman
has issued his strongest statement on acquintance rape, a major issue on
campus since an alleged attack by four football players.
In an appeal mailed directly to 31,000 students on Wednesday, Heyman
said acquaintance rape "degrades its victims, our campus community and
society at large."
The letter is accompanied by a brochure defining acquaintance rape as
"sexual intercourse undertaken by a friend or acquaintance without the
consent of the woman." Hie brochure also lists ways to avoid circum
stances that might lead to rape and places to call for help.
"I can't remember anything like this in recent years," said campus
spokesman Ray Colvig. It serves to point out that the chancellor considers
the issue to be extraordinary."
Assistant Chancellor Lola Harris said she believes it is the first direct ap
peal to students the chancellor has issued in his six years in office.
Campus police have released statistics showing that 11 rapes had been
reported within their jurisdiction in 1986, double the previous year's fig
ures.
The alleged assault by the athletes took place in September after a party
in a dorm complex near campus.
The players were not prosecuted by the Alameda County District Attor
ney's Office, which said there was not enough evidence.
The players had to apologize to the woman, undergo counseling, move
from the dorm and do community service work as part of a settlement of
the student conduct case. The settlement was approved by the woman, the
players and the university.
Soldiers fire on demonstrators
MANILA, Philippines — Government soldiers opened fire on thousands
of leftist peasant demonstrators as they approached the presidential palace
yesterday, killing at least 12 of them and wounding more than 50. It was the
worst incident of violence in Manila since President Corazon Aquino took
power 11 months ago.
Within hours of the shooting, Communist rebels suspended peace talks
aimed at ending their 18-year insurgency. They described the incident as
"part of a pattern of military action" aimed at destroying their movement
and destabilizing the nation.
The military accused the political left of provoking the shootings in an ef
fort to destabilize the government 10 days before a national referendum on
a new constitution that the Communists have rejected.
After a three-hour meeting with her military leaders yesterday night,
Aquino said she expected her opponents to exploit the incident in an effort
to defeat the new constitution.
The shooting, which threatened to plunge Aquino's young government
into its worst crisis yet, began after 10,000 members of a highly organized
leftist farmer's movement marched toward Malacanang Palace to demand
an equitable distribution of farmland and food for the poor.
Policy contradictions revealed
WASHINGTON — Despite the Reagan administration's avowed policy
against yielding to terrorist demands, a U.S. official pressured Kuwait to
free 17 Shia Moslem prisoners whose release was demanded by Iran as
• part of the effort to *win the freedom of Americans held in Lebanon, a con
gressional source said yesterday.
Secretary of State George Shultz was said to have learned of the apparent
contradiction with the administration's official policy after State Depart
ment and CIA officials met with Iranian representatives in early December.
Shultz's testimony Wednesday, which disclosed several recent and star
tling developments in U.S. dealings with Iran, has raised new questions
about Reagan's control of the Iranian policy and led to criticism of Shultz's
own vigor in attempting to take control of U.S. initiatives toward the Tehran
regime.
As earlier reported, Shultz. had also told that panel that the administra
tion had continued to negotiate with Tehran well into December, more
than a month after controversy erupted over secret sales of U.S. arms to
Iran.
China fires prominent scientists
PEKING — China yesterday fired two of the nation's most prominent sci
entists from their jobs at the head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in
what diplomats termed an outgrowth of the ongoing Communist Party
campaign against "bourgeois liberalization."
The standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, said that both Lu Jiaxi, the president of the academy, and Yan
Dongsheng, who has been both a vice president and the academy's Com
munist Party boss, have been removed from their government posts.
At the same time, the committee concluded a 10-day session without set
tling any of the unanswered questions about China's future political leader
ship. It did not choose any successor for Premier Zhao Ziyang, who
became acting general secretary of the Communist Party when Hu Yaobang
resigned as party chief last week.
Lu and Yan are the high est-ranking in a series of scientists and other in
tellectuals who have been removed from their jobs or purged from the
Communist Party in recent weeks.
