### 
MANILA, Philippines — Troops were
placed on "red alert" in Manila this
morning as thousands of people pre
pared to march on the presidential
palace to protest last week's killing by
soldiers of 12 demonstrators.
Officials of Bayan, the nation's
largest leftist organization, told repor
ters they would meet with President
Corazon Aquino before the march but
vowed to go ahead with their plans re
gardless of the outcome of the talks.
Brig. Gen. Romeo Zulueta, who re
placed Brig. Gen. Ramon Montano as
commander of the Manila region, or
dered troops to arrest any "troub
lemakers." Soldiers were put on red
alert, which means they must be ready
to be deployed if needed.
Montano was placed on leave until a
special presidential commission com
pletes its investigation into the shoot
ing of the 12 demonstrators.
About 10,000 peasants and suppor
ters of their demands for land reform
marched toward Aquino's office last
Thursday. At Mendiola bridge near the

palace, they forced a line of police to
retreat. Marines behind the police fired
on the protesters, killing 12 and
wounding 94.
Both left- and right-wing groups
condemned the "Mendiola massacre,"
the bloodiest street clash of Aquino's
young presidency.
The crisis comes right before a Feb.
2 plebiscite on a new constitution,
which is regarded as a vote of confi
dence in Aquino's stewardship.
Yesterday, Cardinal Jaime Sin
blamed government failures in land re
form for the shooting deaths.
Teodoro Benigno, spokesman for
Aquino, said it was her 54th birthday
yesterday and she spent the day with
family. He said she was "very con
cerned, as any president should be,"
about the planned march today.
Sin, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of Manila, referred to the killings in his
sermon yesterday at Manila cathedral.
The cardinal played a key role in br
inging Aquino to power last February,

and yestrday he called on her to act ur
gently on land reform.
Aquino has said land reform is a
major goal of her government. She has
proceeded slowly on the issue, how
ever, since taking office 11 months ago
after a civilian-military uprising ended
the 20-year authoritarian presidency of
Ferdinand Marcos.
Her administration has said it hopes
to eventually grant land titles to about 4
million landless peasants in this coun
try' of more than 54 million.
Sin said he was not trying to lay per
sonal blame for the killings. But he said
progress Aquino made toward national
unity had been "swiftly and senselessly
diminished" by the violence.
"We ask the government, in the
wake of this tragedy, to turn its urgent
attention to the issues of land reform,"
said Sin.
Most Filipinos are Roman Catholic,
and the church exercises great influ
ence.
Aquino's foremost opponent, former
Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile,

said in an interview published yester
day in The Los Angeles Times that the
killings dragged the government's in
ternational reputation lower than it
was under Marcos, now in Hawaiian
exile.
Enrile was interviewed while cam
paigning against ratifying the new con
stitution.
About 5,000 Marcos supporters
burned copies of the draft charter at a
rally in a Manila suburb yesterday.
Leandro Alejandro, secretary-general
of Baxan, or Country, said 2
,000 members would march to the
palace. Bayan claims 2 million mem
bers nationwide.
The May Ist Movement, the largest
labor union, and the Philippine Far
mers Movement, which organized
Thursday's march, said they would also
march, as have several student groups.
"We will march to Mendiola ... and
we are determined to be able to cross
the bridge," J.V. Bautista, a senior
Bayan official, said Saturday.

to be deployed if needed.
Montano was placed on leave until a
special presidential commission com
pletes its investigation into the shoot
ing of the 12 demonstrators.
About 10,000 peasants and suppor
ters of their demands for land reform
marched toward Aquino's office last
Thursday. At Mendiola bridge near the

palace, they forced a line of police to
retreat. Marines behind the police fired
on the protesters, killing 12 and
wounding 94.
Both left- and right-wing groups
condemned the "Mendiola massacre,"
the bloodiest street clash of Aquino's
young presidency.
The crisis comes right before a Feb.
2 plebiscite on a new constitution,
which is regarded as a vote of confi
dence in Aquino's stewardship.
Yesterday, Cardinal Jaime Sin
blamed government failures in land re
form for the shooting deaths.
Teodoro Benigno, spokesman for
Aquino, said it was her 54th birthday
yesterday and she spent the day with
family. He said she was "very con
cerned, as any president should be,"
about the planned march today.
Sin, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of Manila, referred to the killings in his
sermon yesterday at Manila cathedral.
The cardinal played a key role in br
inging Aquino to power last February,

and yestrday he called on her to act ur
gently on land reform.
Aquino has said land reform is a
major goal of her government. She has
proceeded slowly on the issue, how
ever, since taking office 11 months ago
after a civilian-military uprising ended
the 20-year authoritarian presidency of
Ferdinand Marcos.
Her administration has said it hopes
to eventually grant land titles to about 4
million landless peasants in this coun
try' of more than 54 million.
Sin said he was not trying to lay per
sonal blame for the killings. But he said
progress Aquino made toward national
unity had been "swiftly and senselessly
diminished" by the violence.
"We ask the government, in the
wake of this tragedy, to turn its urgent
attention to the issues of land reform,"
said Sin.
Most Filipinos are Roman Catholic,
and the church exercises great influ
ence.
Aquino's foremost opponent, former
Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile,

said in an interview published yester
day in The Los Angeles Times that the
killings dragged the government's in
ternational reputation lower than it
was under Marcos, now in Hawaiian
exile.
Enrile was interviewed while cam
paigning against ratifying the new con
stitution.
About 5,000 Marcos supporters
burned copies of the draft charter at a
rally in a Manila suburb yesterday.
Leandro Alejandro, secretary-general
of Baxan, or Country, said 2
,000 members would march to the
palace. Bayan claims 2 million mem
bers nationwide.
The May Ist Movement, the largest
labor union, and the Philippine Far
mers Movement, which organized
Thursday's march, said they would also
march, as have several student groups.
"We will march to Mendiola ... and
we are determined to be able to cross
the bridge," J.V. Bautista, a senior
Bayan official, said Saturday.
