Cornerstone celebration planned
A major three-day celebration to
commemorate the laying of Stanford's
cornerstone a century earlier will be
held on campus May 14-16.
Invitations will be extended to Uni
versity faculty, students, staff and
alumni, as well as Stanford's neighbors
throughout the Bay Area.
Cornerstone Weekend will begin
with an academic procession and con
vocation in the Quadrangle mid
afternoon on Thursday, May 14. The
program will highlight the historical
significance of the occasion and will in
clude speakers of international promi
nence. The Stanford Historical Society
will host a public reception in the Quad
directly afterward.
Ceremonial dinners throughout the
campus will be featured that evening,
followed by a dance to be held on the
Quad.
The tentative focus of the May 15 pro
gram is the role of universities nation
ally and their contributions to society in
the 21st century. Also planned for the
day is a celebration of student talent and
diversity.
A special Campus Conference, or
ganized by the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion, will close the celebration on
Saturday, May 16, with the theme "The
role of the American West in the Quality
of American Life." Panel discussions

will he held relating to this theme,
focusing on education, public policy,
economics and the media. Keynote re
marks will be made by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and by President
David Gardner of the University of
California. Other panelists will include
prominent national experts and media
personalities.
Technology to tech engineers
In a field as fast-moving as elec
tronics, universities constantly are fac
ing a serious instructional problem:
Their equipment is usually years be
hind the technology used in industry.
Stanford Prof. Edward J. McCluskey,
facing that problem in teaching the de
sign of digital computers, solved it by
going out and getting donations of
industrial-strength equipment. Now,
McCluskey's students are virtually even
with the people they will work with
when they leave Stanford.
And McCluskey and his teaching as
sistants have a new problem: getting the
students off the machines.
McCluskey, professor of electrical
engineering and computer science, ob
tained 18 IBM AT computers and, more
important, computer-aided design
(CAD) software for designing computer
circuits. His students now can design
their circuits on the computer screen

and have the computer tell them if the
design works.
Before the advent of the CAD work
stations, students had to design their
circuits with paper and pencil, exactly
the way they used to be designed in
industry, McCluskey says.
"At one time it was all done by hand.
Engineers did the design and entered it
into a big machine — there's probably
still a lot of that done now — and did the
simulations," he says.
But because of the cost and complex
it)' of the CAD systems, universities fell
far behind the technology used in the
commercial world.
"This is something that's been bug
ging me for the last several years be
cause when I go out consulting 1 see
people doing this stuff, and 1 see what
I'm teaching people," he says.
"One of the advantages of the auto
mated design facility is that you can
handle bigger things faster, so 1 got the
crazy idea 1 can teach more realistic
problems if 1 had these things.
"I succeeded by begging."
McCluskey first obtained the IBM
ATs, among the most powerful of the
microcomputers. Then he went after
the software.
This quarter, the technology will be
an integral pan of the instruction and
will be used for some of the homework
assignments.
