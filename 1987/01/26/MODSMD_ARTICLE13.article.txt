It's been said before. It'll undoubtedly be said again.
Stanford needs more minority and women tenured fa
culty members to bring their numbers to a level rep
resentative of the national population and to give stu
dents the kind of diversity that will broaden the educa
tion offered here. It's a problem that isn't going to go
away easily, and it's one that resists simplistic, short-term
solutions.
Ninety-six minority faculty members account for 7.3
percent of tenured faculty at Stanford. Of the 1,315 pro
fessors, 135 are women — 10.3 percent. The numbers
speak for themselves. The best that can be said is that
they have improved. Since 1971, the number of tenured
female professors has increased by 6 percent, while the
number of minority faculty has increased by 3.6 percent.
The problem is bigger than a shortage of qualified
minority professor candidates, however. There is a shor
tage of candidates of every ethnic origin. This shortage
results in large part from the fact that there are fewer and
fewer students receiving doctorates, and fewer and fewer
of them are interested in becoming professors. The best
way for a university to attract qualified faculty members
and to create a more diverse faculty, then, is to concen
trate on encouraging its students — and particularly its
minority students — to become professors, and then to
ease the financial burden that could keep a good candi
date from pursuing the profession. Going out and re
cruiting minority and women faculty members will im
prove the problem in the short run, but will do little
about solving the problem in the long run.
While Stanford has done better than most private uni
versities in attracting minority and women faculty, there
is more it could do both to encourage its students to be
come professors and to make the profession an easier
road to hoe.
Stanford has already made giant leaps in two areas that

encourage minority and women students to pursue
careers in academics. Stanford's vigorous ethnic studies
programs place a particular importance on the scholarly
understanding of ethnic issues. The programs can only
help suggest to minority students that their diverse ex
periences can easily be incorporated into traditional
education. A broadening of these programs would only
make clearer their importance to a diverse education
that encourages diversity among its students and profes
sors.
Stanford recently broke new ground by starting a big
brother / big-sister program that links black professors
with black students. An expansion of this program to all
students — minority and non-minority — would give
students interested in becoming professors a first-hand
glimpse at the life of a university professor and provide a
close adviser.
Despite these programs, however, there remains a
huge problem that could play a major role in keeping
minorities away from academia: the fact that teaching is
not a high-paying profession, and minorities are fre
quently the ones who can least afford to pay off huge
post-college debts. The prospect of having to pay off four
years of college loans could turn away even the most de
voted prospective professors, turning them instead to a
lucrative profession.
Stanford could break new ground by beginning a pro
gram of assuming the debts of its young, post-doctoral
lecturers and assistant professors who cannot overcome
their financial burdens and remain professors.
The shortage of minority and women faculty members
is a problem that will not disappear overnight, no matter
how hard universities try to solve it. Only a steady com
mitment will pay off in the long run — when those stu
dents who benefit from programs undertaken now are
choosing their profesions.
