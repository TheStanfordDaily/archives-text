Hoover sources,
don't be afraid
Why was I so disappointed to see the
following phrase in an article in Tues
day's Daily: .. according to a staff
member at Hoover... speaking on the
condition of anonymity"?
This way of doing business with the
public has, after all, become com
monplace with our current federal
administration. That group long ago
made secrecy a fetish. They are obses
sed with it. I suppose many citizens are
used to it by now. I'm not. Even though
I've abandoned hope that our present
White House bunch will be forthright,
level with us, and take responsibility
for their words and deeds, I have not
lost sight of the view that in a free soci
ety — a democracy — such matters
should be open.
Hence my disappointment stems
from finding that an echo of that obses
sion has found its way into our campus
newspaper. That is clearly out of place
here, and ought to be. Take care not to
fault The Daily; it just reported the
story, part of which was that its source
spoke only on the condition that she
(or he) would remain anonymous.
Speaking publicly, but anonymously,
expends the freedom of a university
community yet avoids the responsibil
ity to be accountable for one's public
statements. That kind of foolishness
doesn't build an environment of trust
— it erodes it.
The article I refer to was no big deal.
Chief of Staff Donald Regan offered
Stanford's John Cogan, acting director
of the Hoover Institution, a job, and he
turned it down Why should some

Hoover staff member need to cloak
that story in anonymity? Egads! Could it
be that some of Washington's more eg
regious habits have found their way to
Hoover? I hope not. Besides, John Co
gan's decision to stay here and run
Hoover for the next few months is ter
rific news. His leadership has already
proven valuable to Hoover and to Stan
ford and offers us some promise of
happier futures.
In the meantime, I hope the
anonymous Hoover staffer can find the
courage to speak right out next time,
publicly and for the record, and say
whatever is on her (or his) mind. For
goodness sake, we don't want the
White House's obsession with secrecy
and anonymous public statements to
find its way to Stanford. Our standards
are higher than that!

Tuition warrants
smaller classes
In trying to attract potential applic
ants, each university boasts of different
aspects it has to offer. Many private
universities tend to highlight, among
other things, their student-teacher
ratios. Stanford is no different. If I re
member correctly back to my senior
year in high school, I believe I read
about a 7-to-l ratio. Now I am not
doubting the word of the authors of
the many forms of propaganda Stan
ford puts out. What I am wondering is
where this ratio exists?
As an economics and political sci
ence major, I am not too disappointed
that most of my lectures have in excess

of 100 students. After all, we are being
lectured by some of the greatest intel
lectual minds in the country. There
fore, when Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner's Poli Sci 35 class has
some 700 students, and a student has to
get to class 15 minutes early just to find
a seat, I do not complain. In addition,
the fact that a friend of mine at UCLA,
who is also an economics major, has
much smaller classes than 1 shouldn't
really bother me because my profes
sors are obviously far superior — at
least 10 times superior, as indicated by
our enormous tuition as compared
with a public school like UCLA.
What really gets me, however, is not'
the huge lecture classes, but rather the
language classes. I am now in my third
quarter of German, and I have never
had a class with under 18 students.
How can we be expected to learn a
foreign language with such big classes?
Everyone knows how important class
time is for a language (or so all my in
structors tell me); yet I don't believe
that I'm learning too much when I'm
only called on once or twice per hour.
In the German Department, few of
the instructors are professors anyway.
So whv can't we have smaller classes.
And I especially don't think it's fair to
expect the students to sit in huge
classes (and I think 18 or 20 is "huge"
for a language class) when we are pay
ing so much to do so. I think it is about
time this university begins thinking
more about the students it was
founded to help, and less about cutting
corners and saving money. In other
words, it is about time we start getting
our money's worth.

doubting the word of the authors of
the many forms of propaganda Stan
ford puts out. What I am wondering is
where this ratio exists?
As an economics and political sci
ence major, I am not too disappointed
that most of my lectures have in excess

of 100 students. After all, we are being
lectured by some of the greatest intel
lectual minds in the country. There
fore, when Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner's Poli Sci 35 class has
some 700 students, and a student has to
get to class 15 minutes early just to find
a seat, I do not complain. In addition,
the fact that a friend of mine at UCLA,
who is also an economics major, has
much smaller classes than 1 shouldn't
really bother me because my profes
sors are obviously far superior — at
least 10 times superior, as indicated by
our enormous tuition as compared
with a public school like UCLA.
What really gets me, however, is not'
the huge lecture classes, but rather the
language classes. I am now in my third
quarter of German, and I have never
had a class with under 18 students.
How can we be expected to learn a
foreign language with such big classes?
Everyone knows how important class
time is for a language (or so all my in
structors tell me); yet I don't believe
that I'm learning too much when I'm
only called on once or twice per hour.
In the German Department, few of
the instructors are professors anyway.
So whv can't we have smaller classes.
And I especially don't think it's fair to
expect the students to sit in huge
classes (and I think 18 or 20 is "huge"
for a language class) when we are pay
ing so much to do so. I think it is about
time this university begins thinking
more about the students it was
founded to help, and less about cutting
corners and saving money. In other
words, it is about time we start getting
our money's worth.

Hoover sources,
don't be afraid
Why was I so disappointed to see the
following phrase in an article in Tues
day's Daily: .. according to a staff
member at Hoover... speaking on the
condition of anonymity"?
This way of doing business with the
public has, after all, become com
monplace with our current federal
administration. That group long ago
made secrecy a fetish. They are obses
sed with it. I suppose many citizens are
used to it by now. I'm not. Even though
I've abandoned hope that our present
White House bunch will be forthright,
level with us, and take responsibility
for their words and deeds, I have not
lost sight of the view that in a free soci
ety — a democracy — such matters
should be open.
Hence my disappointment stems
from finding that an echo of that obses
sion has found its way into our campus
newspaper. That is clearly out of place
here, and ought to be. Take care not to
fault The Daily; it just reported the
story, part of which was that its source
spoke only on the condition that she
(or he) would remain anonymous.
Speaking publicly, but anonymously,
expends the freedom of a university
community yet avoids the responsibil
ity to be accountable for one's public
statements. That kind of foolishness
doesn't build an environment of trust
— it erodes it.
The article I refer to was no big deal.
Chief of Staff Donald Regan offered
Stanford's John Cogan, acting director
of the Hoover Institution, a job, and he
turned it down Why should some

Hoover staff member need to cloak
that story in anonymity? Egads! Could it
be that some of Washington's more eg
regious habits have found their way to
Hoover? I hope not. Besides, John Co
gan's decision to stay here and run
Hoover for the next few months is ter
rific news. His leadership has already
proven valuable to Hoover and to Stan
ford and offers us some promise of
happier futures.
In the meantime, I hope the
anonymous Hoover staffer can find the
courage to speak right out next time,
publicly and for the record, and say
whatever is on her (or his) mind. For
goodness sake, we don't want the
White House's obsession with secrecy
and anonymous public statements to
find its way to Stanford. Our standards
are higher than that!

Tuition warrants
smaller classes
In trying to attract potential applic
ants, each university boasts of different
aspects it has to offer. Many private
universities tend to highlight, among
other things, their student-teacher
ratios. Stanford is no different. If I re
member correctly back to my senior
year in high school, I believe I read
about a 7-to-l ratio. Now I am not
doubting the word of the authors of
the many forms of propaganda Stan
ford puts out. What I am wondering is
where this ratio exists?
