# Joseph Stalin's ties with Stanford
## 
### 
I was quite pleased to read in Thursday's Daily
about the history of Kingscote Gardens, and I would
like to compliment your enterprising reporter for
her off-handed revelation that among the many fam
ous visitors many years ago one was none other than
Joseph Stalin. Until now this has been an extraordi
narily well-kept secret, shared only by the initiated
few with a true "need to know," but since this visit is
now a matter of public record, it is probably time to
give your readers the benefit of a full report.

Stalin came here secretly in 1936, with the encour
agement of Herbert Hoover himself, to do research
in the Hoover archives about who was a true blue (or
red) Bolshevik and who wasn't. During that time, he
was enrolled as a transfer student from Georgia Tech
(the registrar was in on the subterfuge, of course)
studying linguistics. He worked under Profs. Roman
Jacobson and Mikhail Menshevik. In fact, while he
was living at Kingscote Gardens, he met regularly
with FDR's right-hand man, Harry Hopkins, to plan
the Lend-Lease Aid that would be sent to Russia in the
event of war in Europe. Stalin is often accused of hav
ing been too trusting of Hitler, who supposedly took
advantage of his trust to attack Russia by surprise in
1941, but the whole thing had been carefully planned
here at Stanford five years before!
During his stay here, Stalin enjoyed frequenting
local places of entertainment. His and Aleksandr

Kerensky's initials can be found on the table in the
third booth from the rear door at the Oasis, where
they lilked to go for a drink on a hot summer's after
noon. Stalin is rumored to have put up the funds for
the student Russian-American Friendship Band,
which was even bigger than the Band. He was also
good friends with John Steinbeck and Thorstein Veb
len, both of whom were at Stanford in those years.
There is no truth, however, to the rumor that Hoover
offered Stalin the directorship of the Hoover Institu
tion before W. Glenn Campbell was appointed Stalin
wanted to retire from politics and grow geraniums,

and that is just what he is doing. If you don't believe
me, go ask him
I think it is finally time that Stanford's role in assist
ing one of the great despots of all time be fully rec
ognized and acknowledged. At the very least, we
should have a Stalin Library, small and tasteful, to be
sure, to match the grotesque memorial to anti
Communism that is about to sprout in the cow pas
ture west of campus.
