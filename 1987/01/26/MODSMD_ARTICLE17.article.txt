# Animal rights in the future
## 
### 
Winter quarter 1989. The Radical Right has taken over
Stanford University and begins to implement its five-year
plan. The ASSU News now uses Biblical themes, Shirley
Temple movies replace the Sunday Night Flicks, and
Brother Jed has just been named Dean of Morals in a hotly
contested race against two former members of the Faculty
Senate.

We begin our story on a Monday morning in Cowell, re
cently renamed, "Cowell Animal Rights (and student health)
Center." Framed, glossy pictures of happy rats and lizards,
their smiles as wide as Oprah Winfrey's waistline, look
down on the miserable humans below. Anxious students,
pain and worry written on their faces as boldly as a Daily
headline, line up at the famous "triage" desk. Behind the
counter, a nurse in a starched and blindinglv white uniform
ignores them. Admiring her glossed fingernails, the nurse
talks into the telephone, "Yes, this is Cowell Animal Rights.
You had a bypass operation last year? Uh huh. Well, we're
going to have to take back our work. Right. You're
scheduled for next week. Why? Silly girl, that operation was
only itu de possible after hundreds of medical experiments
made upon helpless piglets in the '60s. Yes, it's part of our
new 'victim's rights' program. No, you can't cancel it "
Suddenly, over the moans and cries of the students in
line, a lawn mower starts up outside. The starched nurse
looks up, shock spreading across her face like food service
gravy on mashed potatoes. "No! Stop!" vaulting
the counter and bursting out the door, followed by the four
other interns and doctors who had been hiding in the file
room.
Outside, his ears encased in giant plastic mufflers, an un
shaven worker mounts the mowing machine. Just as he en
gages the clutch, a burly intern hurtles through the air, and
in a flying tackle reminiscent of a Chappie staffer pouncing
on a customer, the intern knocks the man off his seat. The
headphones slowly tumble end over end in the air as the
worker takes a nosedive into the soft mud below.
Meanwhile, the starched nurse and her friends crawl on
their hands and knees in front of the still-quivering blade.
With tremendous voices they shriek, "The earthworms! My
God, the poor earthworms! Terrorized by this menacing
machine, these helpess invertebrates may be emotionally
scarred for life!"
The burly intern wipes his hands on the motionless
worker's jacket. "Quick! Call CAPS for counseling!"
Students file out from the lobby of the health center, their
pain and agony momentarily forgotten. "Golly," said one of
them, holding his jaw, from which a tooth had recently been
dislodged. "Those poor earthworms didn't even have anes
thesia. It's a good thing these responsible people stopped
the lawnmower in time."
"My goodness, yes," replied another with a broken wrist.
Blood seeped through his sweater like the ink from a pen in
a EE's breast pocket. "Imagine the horrible atrocities that
could have been committed! Earthworm carnage! Animal
mutilation and dismemberment! The screams of recent

widows and orphans filling the air like grease in a co-op
kitchen! Oh, it's too horrible to even talk about."
A third student, bicycle spokes and bits of gravel poking
through her skin, nodded in agreement. "All of thisâ€” and
for what? Mowing the lawn! Hundreds of innocents undergo
agonizing, tortuous slicing ending in a merciless death, all
because some insensitive clod wants to mow the lawn.' She
faints with the vehemence of her speech, adding another
bruise to the considerable number spread about her body.
Sirens cut through the still air like the noise from a frat
party at three in the morning. The zebra-striped vans from
the Creatures' Advocates and Pets' Services (CAPS) pull up
to the scene, disgorging khaki-clad officials who carefully
survey the scene. The animal activist interns, after tending to
the wounded worms and a few stray slugs, rise from the
grass and hail their colleagues. "Over here! Oh, it's horrible!
Ernest and Emily have lost a lot of blood, and one of their
lungs has caved in!" The starched nurse holds two pink and
brown coils in her hands, the slime and earthworm guts
running through her fingers like the tears streaming down
her cheeks.
Carefully remaining on the asphalt sidewalk, the khaki of
ficial with a two-monkey and one-rat insignia on her shoul
der pulled out a clipboard with all the fervor and discipline
of a SJSU marching band member. "Animal Rights code 25-
6k.3," she barked. "You fools! What about the aphids! Yes,
the aphids!"
The Cowell employees, standing on the grass, look down
at their feet in horror. There, underneath the right heel of
the burly intern's shoe, was the last mortal remains of a
green aphid. Struck with the magnitude of their crime, the
interns could only quail in fear as they contemplated how
many innocent aphids they had killed in their attempt to
save the earthworms. The moral dilemma was too much for
them, and one after another in quick succession, they fell to
the earth in a dead faint, successively squashing both insects
and worms under their prostrate bodies.
The CAPS officials turned to the students by the entrance.
The students quailed in fear. A buzzing fly broke the silence,
flying over the grass and landing on the forehead of the
woman in khaki. The woman didn't stir. The students, im
mobilized by both their own pain and their fear of the
woman, didn't stir either.
Holding his head, the worker arose from the far side of
the lawn mower. "Ya know,"he said thickly, "Ah don't un
derstand any of this. Ah was just goin' to mow the lawn.
You're all acting as if we can't hurt any single creature, for
any reason. Well, what about all them medical advances that
used to take place, eh? And what about all those hamburgers
we used to have, eh? Aren't those worth something?" He
wiped his forehead with a dirty hand, and broke out, "Why,
you're all acting as if these dumb animals are more impor
tant than us humans!"
The fly on the woman's forehead finished washing his
legs and crawled down her face and neck, disappearing into
her blouse. A shudder ran through the official's body as she
forced a weak smile. "My dear sir,' she said, her voice sud
denly as smooth as oil, "My dear sir, that is exactly the
point."
