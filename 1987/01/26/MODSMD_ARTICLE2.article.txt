### INGRID WICKELGREN Staff writer 
The Santa Clara County Planning
Commission will decide next Thursday
whether to reconsider its decision ap
proving the site of the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library after being asked
to do so by a group opposed to develo
ment of the foothills west of campus,
according to County Chief Planning Of
ficer Bob Sturdivant.
Reconsideration will depend on
whether the written communication
the commissioners receive from the
protest group contains any new, sig
nificant information regarding the
library or whether the Planning Com
n.ssion decides that its initial decision
depended on erroneous information,
Sturdivant said.
The request to reconsider the pro
jected site was made by the Green
Foothill Group, which objects to the
proposed library site in the foothills
west of Junipero Serra Boulevard and
Lake Lagunita.
The original vote of the County Plan
ning Commission was four to two in
favor of the proposed site. One plan
ning commissioner was absent from the
Dec. 4 hearing and vote.
Planning commissioners said the lib
rary could be a valuable addition to the
community as long as it complies with
zoning law.

"I feel that the Reagan library would
be an asset to Stanford, but it is impor
tant that it not be a tourist attraction,"
said Planning Commissioner Anne
Coombs. Coombs also said the library
was too big as proposed and that 150
acres of open space around the library
would reduce the density to a permissi
ble level.
"They've reduced the concept (of the
Reagan library) from the original one,
but there's still a ways to go," said
Coombs, who voted for the approval of
the use permit Dec. 4.
The library will only contain docu
ments from the Reagan years, Coombs
said. She said historical displays of
documents were appropriate for a lib
rary.
Coombs said The Reagan Foundation
wanted the library to contain artifacts
and souvenirs from the Reagan presi
dency, but the University rejected the
idea.
Coombs said many people have at
tended public hearings to oppose the
library. These people "have strong in
fluence toward keeping the area unde
veloped," Coombs said.
According to Sturdivant, both he and
his staff will continue to support the
approved Reagan Library site provided
that the library plans ensure low
intensity use of the land and approp
