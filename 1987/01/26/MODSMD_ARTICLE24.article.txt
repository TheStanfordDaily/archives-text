## Albanian situation precipitates war on paper 
### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Albanian terrorists have blown up government offices in
Belgrade, declaring Albania an independent state. The
Yugoslavian military defeats the rebel forces, and, due to
poor communication between military planners and field
generals, Yugoslavian forces attack Albania. Albania asks the
Soviet Union for military assistance and may agree to join
the Warsaw Pact if the Soviets intervene.
The above scenario is not from a new best-selling sus
pense novel — although it could well be. Rather, it was
created over the summer by senior Victor Vescovo as part of
a simulation that he hoped to orchestrate of a situation that
could bring the United States to the brink of nuclear war.
Last year in a seminar on accidental and unintentional
nuclear war, Vescovo and seniors Carey White and Tom De-
Paul decided that they wanted to participate in a simulation
of a crisis situation that might involve the use of nuclear
weapons. Crisis simulations had been done in political sci
ence classes in the past, but the three discovered that none
with the intensity they wished would take place in the fol
lowing year.
Undaunted, Vescovo developed an appropriate scenario
that could escalate into nuclear conflict, and he prepared
briefings for members of an American executive committee
(Excom) that would receive the briefings during their dis
cussions as the scenario progressed.

The Excom includes the president (White), chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff (DePaul), vice president, secretaries
of state and defense, director of the CIA and a presidential
representative to Congress. In addition, there is a control
team that shuttles messages back and forth to the control
center, writes memos to members of the Excom to prod
them along and even acts out the roles of foreign ambas
sadors.
The students chosen to participate in the simulation are
all friends of the initial three. Vescovo said that he chose
people who knew each other to group cohesion
and because they all "knew how they operated."
"They (members of the Excom) were very pacifist in the
opening stages," Vescovo said, expressing consternation
that it took the Excom much longer than he thought to esca
late the American force posture.
Congressional representative Mary Thurber finally pro
dded the Excom into action by saying The New York Times
had reported that the Albanian leader had made overtures
to the Soviets. The order to escalate from defense condition
(DEFCON) V to DEFCON IV is signed.
Vescovo said he intentionally chose Yugoslavia and Al
bania for the basis of the conflict because neither country
belongs to NATO or the Warsaw Pact. Thus, the Excom
would have to decide whether or not it would fight to keep
them out of the Warsaw Pact.
"They're going to lose it! They're going to lose the Bal
kans!" said Vescovo's roommate and control team member

Enrique Alvarez as he ran into the room serving as the con
trol center.
"They seem pretty clueless ... This is a major conflict
brewing," Vescovo said.
Political Science Prof. Coit Blacker, Vescovo's faculty ad
visor, "pointed us in the right direction" and helped "when
some weird questions developed during the course of the
simulation, Vescovo said.
Blacker, who was part of a control team for a simulation
that was the subject of a special report put out by the Center
for International Security and Arms Control, said such simu
lations are "incredibly useful" in gaining an insight into
what can happen during a crisis situation, but that they were
"very consumptive" of time.
In an unrelated incident — still part of the scenario, two
members of the Solidarity labor movement in Poland have
been found murdered and the evidence clearly implicates
the KGB.
Vescovo doesn't think that the Excom realizes the impor
tance of murders, so control member Hilary LaMonte (wmo
was on the Soviet team in the simulation conduct by the
center) drafts a memo to the president's press secretary'
warning that Solidarity will protest.

"Expect large protests unequalled in the history of Sol
idarity. We will not give up!" LaMonte wrote.
So far, Vescovo said, the Excom has met for seven hours,
not counting the time the members have spent discussing
the crisis among themselves outside of the simulation, but
in game time three weeks have elapsed.
The participants are taking the simulation very seriously,
taking on both the dress and the demeanor of the roles they
assume.
"Their voices get louder and louder as the session prog
resses. By the end of the last session the secretary of state
was pacing and smoking," Vescoco said.
As of Wednesday, the Soviet Union was intervening in
both Albania and Yugoslavia at the request of those coun
tries' leaders. In addition, Soviet forces had closed off Be
rlin, as in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
"At that point the American team freaked out," Vescovo
said.
The simulation resumes Monday. The outcome depends
upon the reaction of the Excom. Vescovo suggested that
they "be restrained, but show resolve."
"It's a really fine line. We want to see if they can do it,"
Vescovo added.
