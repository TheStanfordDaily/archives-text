## Card crushes Ariz. 87-57 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Halfway through the season, the
Stanford women's basketball team is
near the top of the world, enjoying a
Pacific 10 Conference record of 5-2,
harboring a three-game winning streak
and a four-game conference streak,
sharing second place in the Pac-10 and
coming off a resounding 87-57 league
win over Arizona this weekend in
Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal simply dominated the
first half of the game, leading 56-26 and
boasting a 75 percent shooting average
at halftime. By the conclusion, the
shooting decreased to 57 percent, but
the 30-point margin of victory re
mained the same.
"I am pleased with the effort the
team made," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "We shot really well.
No one played more than 30 minutes."
"We played really well," senior Erica
Mueser concurred. "We hit everything
we shot."
"I thought it was a pretty good
game," freshman Katie Steding said.
"We had good control of the tempo."
Steding hit five of seven and scored
15 points. Other notable performers

were junior Kami Anderson, 10 for 15,
23 points, and freshman Jennifer Azzi,
seven of nine for 16.
"Jennifer Azzi had double-double
with 16 points and 13 assists," VanDer
veer noted. "It's pretty unusual, but
she's been doing it quite a bit lately."
As a team, Stanford beat Arizona in
assists 32-28, but was outrebounded
33-28. Anderson led the Cardinal with
five rebounds. In this respect, the
Wildcats were hardly a pushover.
"The score didn't really reflect how
good a team Arizona really is," Van-
Derveer said. "We lost to them three
times last year. Unfortunately for them,
they were missing two of their key
players."
"They're a team that's been a little
down in the past few weeks," Mueser
noted. "They were missing a lot of
people, which was kind of unexpected
for us."
The most conspicuous absence was
guard Miroslava Aco.Â»ta, the team's high
scorer, who was in an automobile ac
cident. "They really missed her,"
Mueser said.
Also missing from the Wildcat lineup
was forward Yolanda Turner, who

Katy Steding, a freshman center, scored 15 points in Stanford's 87-57 win
over Arizona and finished as the third leading scorer for the Cardinal.
Steding was 5-7 from the field and 5-6 from the free throw line.
