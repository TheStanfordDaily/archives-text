# Fendick sweeps singles, doubles

Patty Fendick — whose slow start
last year was the only blemish on her
championship season — is out of the
gate quickly this season and already
playing "about as well as I've seen her
play," according to Stanford Women's
Tennis Coach Frank Brennan.
Yesterday, Fendick beat USC's
Stephanie Harges 6-2, 6-1 to win the
singles title and teamed with Stephanie
Savides to defeat Caroline Yao and
Sharon Fletcher of California 6-0, 6-4 in
the doubles final of the Women's In
tercollegiate Invitational at Pacific
Palisades.
The win over Harges was Fendick's
28th consecutive collegiate singles vic

tor\ dating back to last April. Earlier
this month, she captured the singles
championship of the National Col
leviate Classic in Cathedral City.
Stanford's Kay Tittle completed a
sweep of the tournament for the Cardi
nal by defeating U.S. International Uni
versity's Sylvie Tetreault 6-4, 7-6 in the
final of the consolation singles yester
day.
"I think it's the new Patty Fendick,"
Brennan said, referring to the fact that
his star player is off to a quick start.
"This year she's nice and relaxed."
Stanford freshman Lisa Green was
one of Fendick's victims. Green, who
lost to Fendick in the final at Cathedral
City, played well at Pacific Palisades
but was overmatched in her quarter
final match with Fendick on Friday.

"From what 1 could tell, Lisa tried a
few shots in the beginning and didn't
have much confidence, Brennan said.
The result was a 6-0, 6-3 victory for
the defending-NCAA singles champion.
"Patty's better," Brennan said, "but Lisa
did really well (in the tournament).
Patty was the best player in the tour
nament by far."
Fendick, the No. 1 seed, was clearly
the class of the field after second
seeded Caroline Kuhlman of USC pul
led out of the tournament due to an ail
ing knee. But there were other talented
players, as Fendick was to find out in
her semifinal match with SMU's Jen
nifer Santrock.
Santrock, the No. 4 seed, surprised
Fendick by taking a 4-1 lead at the out
set of Saturday's semifinal. "That was a

little scary," Brennan said. "Patty took
her a little lightly.
From that point on, however, Fen
dick took over the match, winning the
next 11 games to advance to the final
with a 6-4, 6-0 victory.
Fendick's opponent in yesterday's
final was USC's Stephanie Harges.
Harges had knocked off Stanford's Cari
Hagey 6-3, 6-1 in Friday's quarterfinal
match. "1 think she's a little bit out of
match shape," Brennan said of Hagey.
"Her match toughness isn't there.
When you take the fall off (Hagey was
in Vienna), it's a little tough. Maybe two
weeks from now Cari could beat her
(Harges)."
Fendick was able to beat Harges yes
terday — and rather easily by a 6-2, 6-1
score.
