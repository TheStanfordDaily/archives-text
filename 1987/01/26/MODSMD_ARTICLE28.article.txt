Even the Little League Fathers were
satisfied Friday night in Maples Pavil
ion, as the entire Stanford women's
gymnastics team, split into two squads,
soundly defeated Alberta in the two
schools' second straight contest.
Stanford's Cardinal team won the
home opener with a score of 165.4, fol
lowed closely by the white team's
164.65. Alberta, which last week at
Davis finished with a mark of 137.7,
improved its showing to 159.05.

Coach Homer Sardina said. "With put

junior Alison McGann at 35.95,

freshman Dina Amoroso with 35.85,
freshman Becky Ashton's 34.75 and
sophomore Cheryl Doo at 34.10.
"Alison McGann had a great perfor

said. "It is important to start with a
good meet, because after this the
meets come so fast. After meets like
this it makes me feel optimistic about

think the team has been working
hard," the junior co-captain said. "It
has finally paid off for us, and we'll
continue to improve through the rest
of the season."
The home court advantage was cer

fans, many quite vocal, came out to
