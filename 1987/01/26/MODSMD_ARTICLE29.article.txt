# Giants down Broncos 39-20
## 
### 
PASADENA (AP) — Phil Simms and
the New York defense overcame a
one-man show by John Elway as the
Giants won their first Super Bowl by
scoring 30 points in the second half
yesterday to beat the Denver Broncos
39-20.
Simms, considered the lesser of the
two quarterbacks in the game, com
plted 22 of 25 for 218 yards, including
three touchdown passes, and was
unanimously voted the Most Valuable
Player.
He also set a Super Bowl record with
10 straight completions during New
York's second-half tear. His 88 percent
completion rate was an NFL playoff re
cord.
Most of this came after a first half in
which Denver outplayed the heavily
favored Giants, going off with a 10-9
lead that easily could have been 20-7 or
20-9. Early in the second quarter, New
York held Denver without a point after
the Broncos had a first-and-goal from
their 1 and Rich Karlis missed field
goals from 24 and 34 yards for Denver,
one after that goal-line stand.
So dominant was Elway in that
period that he accounted for 200 yards
on his own — 187 passing and 13 rush
ing. That was 13 more than De
nver's total offense when sacks are fi

gured in.
Then came the third quarter, in
which the Giants outgained the Bron
cos by 163 yards to two, scoring 17
points. From the time the Broncos led
10-9 until the Giants led 33-1, Denver
was held without a first down, going out
1-2-3-punt on two occasions and Elway
threw an interception on the other.
New York's second-half surge
started innocently enough.
Three plays netted nine yards, and the
Giants' punting team ran onto the field
to punt from its own 46. Suddenly, the
Giants shifted out of punt formation,
and Jeff Hutledge, the second-string
quarterback, came up behind the
center.
The ball was snapped, and Rutledge
snuck for one yard and a first down.
Six plays later, Simms hit tight end
Mark Bavaro for 13 yards, the Giants
led 16-10 and the rout was on.
This was the fifth time in six years
that an NFC team has won the Super
Bowl. The last AFC team was the Los
Angeles Raiders in 1984. The Giants
won their three postseason games by a
total score of 105-23, beating San Fran
cisco 49-3 and Washington 17-0 en
route to their first NFL title since 1956.
