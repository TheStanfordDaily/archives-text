# Baseball loses opener at SJS
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
In his first game as baseball coach
at San Jose State, Sam Piraro was
able to do something his predeces
sor, Gene Menges, could not do in
his last 11 tries — beat Stanford.
Bemind the five-hit pitching of
Dan Archibald and Anthony Telford,
the Spartans topped the Cardinal
for the first time in almost three
years with a 2-1 upset at
Municipal Stadium in San Jose.
Stanford will get a chance to square
the series today in a 2 p.m. contest
at Sunken Diamond. Saturday's
game was rained out.
For a new coach inheriting a
team that went 21-33 last season,
beating Stanford — ranked fifth in
the nation by Baseball America and
fourth in the ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball poll — was obviously a
pleasing debut.
"They're a great team and have a
great program," Piraro said. "And
it's a good way to start the season."
The main question concerning
the Cardinal this year is whether the
offense can produce enough runs
to support its outstanding pitching
staff, and Stanford seemed to ans
wer it in the affirmative by striking
early.
After left fielder Ruben Amaro led
off the game with a walk, second
baseman Frank Carey boomed a
double to right-center that put run
ners at second and third. Toi Cook
then scored Amaro with a ground
out, and, after just three batters, the
Cardinal had a 1-0 lead.
It didn't last long, however, as the
Spartans came right back in the bot
tom of the first. With one on and
two out, Rob Thomas grounded a
single to right, putting runners at
the corners. After Thomas stole
second, left fielder Rick Anderson
sliced a Lee Plemel fastball for a

two-run double that just eluded a
diving Cook in right-center.
"If I had it to do over again, I
would have thrown more breaking
balls in the first inning," Plemel
said.
Plemel did go to his breaking
stuff more after the first inning, and
the Spartans could not handle it.
During the next five innings, Plemel
allowed just two baserunners,
neither of whom reached second
base. For his six innings of work,
Plemel struck out seven and did not
walk a batter.
"The only thing that hurt me was
the first inning," Plemel said. "I
made a couple of bad pitches, and
they capitalized on the opportun
ity."
Opportunities were hard to come
by after the first inning, as only one
man reached scoring position for
either team from the second
through seventh innings. While
Plemel and reliever Al Osuna were
throttling the Spartans, Archibald
was holding the Cardinal in check
almost as easily.
The junior right-hander, who
played for Piraro last year at Mission
College in Santa Clara, continually
fell behind the hitters, but was able
to battle back. "The guy made the
pitches when he had to," Cook said.
Stanford finally mounted a threat
in the top of the eighth. Amaro led
off with single to right, and Ar
chibald fell behind Carey at 3-0.
Once again, however, Archibald
came uo with the big pitch, as he
got Carey to ground out at 3-2
wmile Amaro moved to second.
Piraro had seen enough of Ar
chibald's high-wire act by this point
and brought in Telford, usually San
Jose State's top starter, to face Cook.
"I had a gut feeling," Piraro said. "I
felt it was right to make the chance.
It was the fourth time they had seen
Danny, and they had some good hit
ters coming up."
Amaro reached third after Cook
grounded out, but Telford retired
Ed Sprague on a fly ball to center to
end the Cardinal threat. The hard
throwing junior right-hander then
set Stanford down in order in the
ninth to record the save.
Losing its opener may not be a
very good was for a highly-ranked
team to begin its season, but be
cause of the Cardinal's youth, Cook
was not ready to panic yet.
"We're all right, it's still earlv," he

said. "We're a young team, but
we've got all the potential in the
world. 1 know for a fact we'll play
better."
Card notes
Sprague played catcher for the
first time in his Stanford career. The
sophomore, who played exclusively
at third bast last season, had a tough
day at the plate (0 for 4), but gun
ned down the only man who tried
to run on him, Tom Hutler, by a
wide margin.
Piraro liad planned to use Tel
ford as his starter on Saturday, so it
is likely that Telford will be on the
mound today. Rob Wassenaar was
Stanford's scheduled starter on
Saturday, and either he or Steve
Chitren will get the call for the
Cardinal.

Plemel struck out seven and did not
walk a batter.
"The only thing that hurt me was
the first inning," Plemel said. "I
made a couple of bad pitches, and
they capitalized on the opportun
ity."
Opportunities were hard to come
by after the first inning, as only one
man reached scoring position for
either team from the second
through seventh innings. While
Plemel and reliever Al Osuna were
throttling the Spartans, Archibald
was holding the Cardinal in check
almost as easily.
The junior right-hander, who
played for Piraro last year at Mission
College in Santa Clara, continually
fell behind the hitters, but was able
to battle back. "The guy made the
pitches when he had to," Cook said.
Stanford finally mounted a threat
in the top of the eighth. Amaro led
off with single to right, and Ar
chibald fell behind Carey at 3-0.
Once again, however, Archibald
came uo with the big pitch, as he
got Carey to ground out at 3-2
wmile Amaro moved to second.
Piraro had seen enough of Ar
chibald's high-wire act by this point
and brought in Telford, usually San
Jose State's top starter, to face Cook.
"I had a gut feeling," Piraro said. "I
felt it was right to make the chance.
It was the fourth time they had seen
Danny, and they had some good hit
ters coming up."
Amaro reached third after Cook
grounded out, but Telford retired
Ed Sprague on a fly ball to center to
end the Cardinal threat. The hard
throwing junior right-hander then
set Stanford down in order in the
ninth to record the save.
Losing its opener may not be a
very good was for a highly-ranked
team to begin its season, but be
cause of the Cardinal's youth, Cook
was not ready to panic yet.
"We're all right, it's still earlv," he

said. "We're a young team, but
we've got all the potential in the
world. 1 know for a fact we'll play
better."
Card notes
Sprague played catcher for the
first time in his Stanford career. The
sophomore, who played exclusively
at third bast last season, had a tough
day at the plate (0 for 4), but gun
ned down the only man who tried
to run on him, Tom Hutler, by a
wide margin.
Piraro liad planned to use Tel
ford as his starter on Saturday, so it
is likely that Telford will be on the
mound today. Rob Wassenaar was
Stanford's scheduled starter on
Saturday, and either he or Steve
Chitren will get the call for the
Cardinal.
In his first game as baseball coach
at San Jose State, Sam Piraro was
able to do something his predeces
sor, Gene Menges, could not do in
his last 11 tries — beat Stanford.
Bemind the five-hit pitching of
Dan Archibald and Anthony Telford,
the Spartans topped the Cardinal
for the first time in almost three
years with a 2-1 upset at
Municipal Stadium in San Jose.
Stanford will get a chance to square
the series today in a 2 p.m. contest
at Sunken Diamond. Saturday's
game was rained out.
For a new coach inheriting a
team that went 21-33 last season,
beating Stanford — ranked fifth in
the nation by Baseball America and
fourth in the ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball poll — was obviously a
pleasing debut.
"They're a great team and have a
great program," Piraro said. "And
it's a good way to start the season."
The main question concerning
the Cardinal this year is whether the
offense can produce enough runs
to support its outstanding pitching
staff, and Stanford seemed to ans
wer it in the affirmative by striking
early.
After left fielder Ruben Amaro led
off the game with a walk, second
baseman Frank Carey boomed a
double to right-center that put run
ners at second and third. Toi Cook
then scored Amaro with a ground
out, and, after just three batters, the
Cardinal had a 1-0 lead.
It didn't last long, however, as the
Spartans came right back in the bot
tom of the first. With one on and
two out, Rob Thomas grounded a
single to right, putting runners at
the corners. After Thomas stole
second, left fielder Rick Anderson
sliced a Lee Plemel fastball for a

two-run double that just eluded a
diving Cook in right-center.
"If I had it to do over again, I
would have thrown more breaking
balls in the first inning," Plemel
said.
Plemel did go to his breaking
stuff more after the first inning, and
the Spartans could not handle it.
During the next five innings, Plemel
allowed just two baserunners,
neither of whom reached second
base. For his six innings of work,
Plemel struck out seven and did not
walk a batter.
