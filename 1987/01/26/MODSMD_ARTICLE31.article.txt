# Stanford swims past Arizona, Arizona State
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's
swimming teams each recorded im
pressive dual meet sweeps this
weekend, coasting over hosts Arizona
and Arizona State.
With the victories, the Cardinal men
ran their record to 2-0 in the Pac-10
and 4-1 overall while the Stanford
women upped their conference record
to 2-0 and 3-0 overall
For the Cardinal men, Saturday's
meet against top-10 ranked Arizona
State was a test of character as the team
rallied from behind to post a 65-49 vic
tory.
"They had us on the ropes, sopho
more butterfiier Dave Schraven said.
"The way the team responded was re
ally f>ositive."
ASU had a less than warm welcome
for the Cardinal with its surprise vic
tory in the 400-yard medley relay. Stan
ford trailed from that point on until
Stanford benefitted from what Schra

ven called the "turnaround swim' by
tri-captain and Olympian Pablo
Morales.
Competing against 200 IM nemesis
Neil Cockran of ASH, Morales had
enough at the end to touch home a
first-place victory, securing Stanford's
first lead, which they held for the re
mainder. Morales' time of 1:49 66 also
qualified him for the NCAAs.
Schraven cited the "overall team ef
fort" as the watershed of the weekend
and paid special recognition to Cardi
nal breaststrokers Sam Schwartz, Kevin
Jacques, Sam McAdam and Sean Bon
sell, who, according to Schraven,
turned in their finest collective effort of
the season.
Once more, the Cardinal received
clutch swims from freshman freestvlers
John Witchel and Lunn Lestina. Witchel
won the 200-yard freestyle while cap
turing second behind teammate Jeff
Kostoff in the 500-yard freestyle.
The Stanford women, meanwhile,
disposed of the Sun Devils in relatively
easv fashion, registering a lopsided

93-20 victory.
"I think as a whole, we thought
they'd be better," said freshman sensa
tion Lisa Gillespie, who is only now re
turning to full strength after an earlier
shoulder injury.
The Cardinal was led by sophomore
freestvler Jenna Johnson, who won and
qualified in the 100- and 200-yard
freestyle events. Freshman Michelle
Griglione also turned in a NCAA qual
ifying time en route to a 400-yard indi
vidual medley victory. Her time is the
best recorded this season.
Susannah Miller and Susan Rapp also
added their names to the growing list
of qualifiers. Miller found the mark in
the 200-yard backstroke and Rapp, a
1984 Olympian, broke the barrier in
the 200-yard breast
On Friday, both teams handily de
feated Arizona with both meets taking
place in a pool mimicking the consis
tency and texture of the KA mud vol
leyball pits. "The worst ptx)l in the Pac
10," according to Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney.
