### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Three freshmen started their Stan
ford careers with singles victories as
the Stanford men's tennis team opened
defense of its national championship
with a 6-3 victory over Utah.
Jeff Tarango, jeff Cathrall and Barry
Richards, playing their first matches for
the Cardinal, each posted victories,
while wins by Jordie McKee and Pat
rick McEnroe clinched the victory for
Stanford.
"1 thought the guys playing for the
first time did a nice job," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "Overall, it was
a good stan for the season — a good
solid start, and a good place from
which to improve."
Utah Coach F.D. Robbins said: "Our
team played pretty well. We're trying to
get used to playing outside after play
ing indoors since March.... We're

probably a little bit better each match
we play."
Tarango, ranked 14th after the fall,
had an easy time with 25th-ranked Jari
Koho, winning 6-0, 6-2. Koho showed
his frustration on more than one occa
sion, throwing his racket after double
faulting in the final game of the first
set and sending a ball out of Stanford
Tennis Stadium after hitting out in the
second set.
"I thought Jeff Tarango played a
superb match," Gould said.
Cathrall defeated Antti Eranne 6-2,
7-6, while Richards, last year's Texas
State High School champion, knocked
off Eric Chin, 7-5, 6-4, sending Chin di
ving to the ground with the winning
shot.
"(Cathrall) didn't play a good tac
tical match," Gould said, "but 1
thought he competed very well. But
it was good to see him in a match
situation, because there's a lot of very

tangible things we can work on that I
think will really help him.
"Barry Richards, I thought, did a
good job against a good player," Gould
said.
Everything went McEnroe's way,
with a 6-2 win. in the first set of his
match against Brian Monson. For
example, on set point, Monson served
inside to McEnroe, who was only able to
make a weak return to the net. With a
chance for an easy put-away, however,
Monson hit into the net,
He still was able to come from be
hind to win the second set 7-6, forcing
McEnroe to come back for a third set
which he won 6-2 — painfullv, as he
aggravated bruises on the balls of his
feet.
"It was not good that (McEnroe) had
to go a third set," Gould said, "because
the more rest he gets right now the be
tter."
