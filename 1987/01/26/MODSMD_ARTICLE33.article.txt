Entering the UCSB/Michelob Light
Collegiate Invitational tournament
unsure of its ability, the Stanford
Men's volleyball team was able to
place fifth this weekend at Santa Bar
bara in its two-day tournament of
eight matches.
USC took first place in the tourna

Cardinal beat Calgary, and lost to
UCLA. In its final pool, the playoff tor

through, beating both Cal State Nor

played five matches on Friday and

three on Saturday, which amounted
to as manv matches as the team
generally plays in a month.
"We improved steadily throughout
the tournament. Bv the end of the
tournament we were a much better
team," Nieves said. He attributed this
improvement to the team's develop
ing a better feeling of unity as the
players had more court time and
matches together. "It seems that our
hitters and setters are getting their
timing down," Nieves added.
One of the team's goals this
weekend was to develop a starting
lineup. Both the Cardinal setters,
senior Steve Modory and freshman
Parker Blackman, played
equal match time, allowing the
