### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Entering the UCSB/Michelob Light
Collegiate Invitational tournament
unsure of its ability, the Stanford
Men's volleyball team was able to
place fifth this weekend at Santa Bar
bara in its two-day tournament of
eight matches.
USC took first place in the tourna
ment, beating the surprisingly strong
UC-Santa Barbara host team in the
championship match Saturday after
noon. UCSB beat No. 1-ranked UCLA
in the semifinals and put on a strong
attack against USC in the final match,
winning the first game. "I think the
only difference was that UCSB was
the team that wore down first," Stan

ford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said.
Cal State Long Beach took third,
while UCLA was able to finish fourth.
In the preliminary pool, the Car
dinal beat Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,
Humboldt State and UC-Santa Cruz,
all in two games. Stanford lost in
two games to the first-place finisher,
USC. In the power pool, which con
sisted of the top two teams from each
of the four preliminary pools, the
Cardinal beat Calgary, and lost to
UCLA. In its final pool, the playoff tor
fifth to eighth place, Stanford pulled
through, beating both Cal State Nor
thridge and Calgary.
Nieves said he felt the competition
was a very successful one for the
team. "I was pleased with how the
team held up," Nieves said. The team
played five matches on Friday and

three on Saturday, which amounted
to as manv matches as the team
generally plays in a month.
"We improved steadily throughout
the tournament. Bv the end of the
tournament we were a much better
team," Nieves said. He attributed this
improvement to the team's develop
ing a better feeling of unity as the
players had more court time and
matches together. "It seems that our
hitters and setters are getting their
timing down," Nieves added.
One of the team's goals this
weekend was to develop a starting
lineup. Both the Cardinal setters,
senior Steve Modory and freshman
Parker Blackman, played
equal match time, allowing the
coaches to watch both players work
with the team.
Blackman, a top freshman recruit
from Santa Monica, found that the
tournament was good experience for
the team. "We were getting a
feel for each other. And I found it
encouraging for me and the rest of
the team," Blackman said.
The spikers have been working
hard on technique in the basic skills
of serving, blocking, and hitting.
"The things we're doing, we're doing
well," Nieves said. Nieves attributed
the team's strong blocking attack in

the invitational to six-foot-six outside
hitter, Scott Fortune. "Scott had a
great tournament. He set the stage
for a good season. He showed he can
play against anyone in the country
and hold his own against anyone in
the country," Nieves said.
Fortune attributed the team's fifth
place finish to a strong offense. He
said he feels that by putting in more
playing time together, the team can
eliminate its blocking and hitting er
rors. "When we lost, we beat ourse
lves with errors. By the end of the
year we should be at our best," For
tune said.
"We're the kind of team that has
the potential to change as the season
goes on. We've got the depth of
12 strong players," Nieves said.
