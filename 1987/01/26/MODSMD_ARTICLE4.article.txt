# Cowell reviews contraceptive program

### CALISA COLE 
Despite the availability of low-cost
contraceptives through the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center and other groups,
unwanted pregnancies do occur among
Stanford students, although the exact
number is difficult to trace.
Cowell started tracking the number
of positive pregnancy tests last quacter,
but does not have the results available
yet, according to Dr. John Dorman, as
sociate director of medicine. While fi
gures were not tracked at Cowell in
recent years, Dorman said he senses
that the number will be about the same
this year as in the past.
Last spring, the Health Promotion
Program at Stanford sampled 1,710
undergraduate and graduate students
and asked the question, "While at Stan
ford, have you or your partner had an
unplanned pregnancy?"
According to Alejandro Martinez, a
staff psychologist at Cowell, about 5
percent of the responders answered

"yes" to the question. The completed
results from the survey are not yet avail
able.
A student peer counselor from the
Contraceptive Information Center — a
student-run organization that provides
information about birth control,
sexually transmitted diseases and pre
gnancy — estimated that approximately
150 referrals for abortions, about five
per week, occur at Cowell each school
year, based on information released
several years ago. Because not all pre
gnancies are reported to Cowell,
another counselor guessed that at least
200 unwanted pregnancies occur each
school year.
One theory regarding the high pre
gnancy rate is that rising concern over
other issues, especially sexually trans
mitted diseases (STDs), diverts atten
tion from use of contraception.
For instance, there appears to be a
growing reliance on the condom to
serve a dual role as disease preventer
and as contraceptive. Such thinking may
preclude consideration of the Pill or
diaphragm, which are more effective

than the condom (when used without
spermicide) as contraceptives but do
not protect against disease, according to
Contraceptive Information Center
(CIC) counselors.
A second theory is that the sexual
revolution of the '60s and 70s appears
to be quieting down. Ironically, this
trend may serve to increase the likeli
hood of unwanted pregnancy rather
than decrease it. Students wrestling
with moral questions about sexuality
are less likely to have adequate con
traception in advance of an unexpected
need for it, according to counselors.
And some students may consider hav
ing birth control on hand to be a state
ment about themselves personally.
They will risk pregnancy rather than
take contraception with them on a date
or to a party, some counselors added.
Dorman, who has been at Stanford
for 13 years, has witnessed trends in
contraception use among students. "My
concern over the last couple of years is
that most of the questions that students
now have about sexuality are not about
choosing contraceptives," he said.

"Students are more 'back up the road
aways' in terms of asking if they should
be sexually active or not. They are look
ing at what it mean:, about themselves as
individuals if they carry a condom or
diaphragm with them."
Dorman said that when he first ar
rived at the University, "there was less
concern about the consequences of
sexual activity. It was assumed that
people were sexually active."
He added: "The Contraceptive Coun
seling Center (which later became the
Contraceptive Information Center) was
established to help people choose their
contraception. There wasn't a great deal
of concern about sexually transmitted
diseases, and there wasn't particularly
much concern about whether you
should or should not be sexually ac
tive."
Eric Jackson, a junior who has
worked with CIC since his freshman
year, said he has noticed a change at
Stanford over the past few years. "A lot
of people are talking about sex and
