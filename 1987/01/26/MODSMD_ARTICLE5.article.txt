# Farm may host '91 Super Bowl
## 
### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
The Super Bowl — which Stanford
hosted in 1985 — may return here in
1991, Acting President James Rosse an
nounced last week.
Under the agreement that brought
the Super Bowl here in 1985, Stanford
indicated it would probably accept
another Super Bowl in the future, ac
cording to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger. But two years ago, the Univer
sity publicly referred to future Super
Bowl with more skepticism.
Geiger said the language of the 1985
contract with the National Football
League was "stronger" than simply a
"committment to consider" hosting
another Super Bowl.
He said University officials discussed
a second Super Bowl during the origi
nal negotiations. "The first discussions
were before having the first one ...
and we've been talking about it since,"
Geiger said.
"The last thing is that this was a sur
prise," he said. "It's been known."
After the January 1985, game in Stan
ford Stadium, however, University
President Donald Kennedy expressed
skepticism at another Super Bowl.
"We're going to have to take a long
look at it before we decide it's some
thing we ought to repeat," he said two
years ago.
"You've got to ask yourself how
often an institution, whose chief busi
ness is something else, can afford that
kind of diversion of talent and energy,"
he said in a statement following Super
Bowl XIX. "What nobody understands
is how much time and effort it took on
the part of our key people."
Geiger said yesterday that operating
the event is a "major undertaking."
Alan Cummings, associate athletic
director, said after the '85 game that

the final decision to pursue another
game rested with Kennedy and Geiger.
Becaus the National Football League
contributed funds for renovation of
Stanford Stadium, they "wanted to fol
low up" on their investment, Geiger
said yesterday."The NFL invested $75
,000 in our stadium."
The NFL, the San Francisco Area
Super Bowl Task Force and numerous
private donors funded $2.3 million in
stadium improvements — including a
new locker room, press box and a
complex housing a ticket office, con
cession stand and restrooms — prior
to the Olympic soccer matches in the
summer of 1984.
"It was written in the contract that it
(another Super Bowl) would be wel
come should all parties agree," he said.
"It would be bad faith not to say we'd
consider a future bid."
Rosse announced last week the pos
sibility of a 1991 Super Bowlnhere, with
San Francisco and other Bay Area cities
and counties making a formal bid to
NFL Commissioner Pete Rozellenin
February.
He said the University is willing to
host the game again "out of considera
tion of friendship ... under the condi
tion there are no costs to the Univer
sity."
Rosse told the Faculty Senate last
Thursday that the 86,100-seat stadium
is the only one in the Bay Area that
meets the minimum seating and park
ing requirements.
According to Geiger, the '85 game
ran "beautifully." But he said it is not at
all a certainty that the event will return
to Stanford, becusue there is intense
competition to host Super Bowl XXV,
including bids from New Orleans,
Pasadena and Miami.
The decision will be announced in
late May or early June.
