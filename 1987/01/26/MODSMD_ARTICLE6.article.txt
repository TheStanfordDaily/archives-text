### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
The seven Stanford students arrested
in an October protest at a Lockheed
plant were arraigned over the last two
weeks in Sunnyvale Municipal Court,
and two students who pleaded not
guilty last Thursday to the mis
demeanor charges will face a pretrial
hearing Feb. 5.
Scott Bohning, a third-year graduate
student in civil engineering, and Carl
Hill, a second-year graduate student in
German Studies, pleaded not guilty to
misdemeanor charges of obstructing
traffic and unlawful assembly. Bohning
said he and Hill will meet this week to
decide whether to change their plea, to

hire counsel or to defend themselves.
"I didn't want to throw myself on the
mercy of the court right away," Hill said.
"We're probably going to wait until the
Feb. 5 pretrial. . . . We might work
something out" with the district attor
ney.
Hill said his plans are "still up in the
air," adding that "I'm not sure I have the
time (for a trial)â€” It might be better to
take the easy way out."
Of the 32 protesters arrested, the
majority pleaded not guilty, Hill said.
The five other Stanford students ar
raigned were also fined $50.
. Recent Stanford graduates Jen G. Grant
and Caroline Haul were the last students
