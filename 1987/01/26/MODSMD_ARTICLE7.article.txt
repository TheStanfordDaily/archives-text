# Profs: Racism still alive in U.S.
## 
### DIANE BISGEIGER Staff writer 
A civil rights march Saturday in northern
Georgia points out the continued presence of
racism and raises questions about the progress
of the civil rights movement, according to pro
fessors interviewed yesterday.
"I guess it (the march) demonstrates that the
problem of racism hasn't gone away," said
Assoc. History Prof. Claxborne Carson.
The march — coming less than a week after
the celebration of the birth of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr. — drew a group
of almost 20,000 civil rights supporters to
Cumming, an all-white Georgia town of about
2,000 people. The marchers were protected by
2,300 National Guardsmen, who separated
them from several hundred Cumming citizens
and Klu Klux Klan supporters.
Speakers at the march included civil rights
leader Jesse Jackson, Correta Scott King and
former Sen. Gary Hart.
Saturday's march, which resulted in the ar
rest or detainment of more than 50 people,
came in response to a Klu Klux Klan inspired
disruption of a similar march by civil rights
demonstrators last week.

"I think the civil rights movement has suc
ceeded in achieving some changes, hut
(King's) dream of racial equality remains un
fulfilled," said Carson, who is currently direct
ing the Martin Luther King Papers Project.
Carson said, however, that "King's effort to
bring non-violent solution still remains the
best alternative."
St. Claire Drake, professor emeritus in an
thropology and sociology, found the march "a
sort of deja vu for me." Drake participated in
some of King's marches in the 1960s as "part of
the so-called 'non-violent body guard group.' "
He said he found Saturday's cries of "nigger go
home" similar to those heard in 1966: "Jungle
bunny go back to Africa."
"You'd think this wouldn't happen after 20
years," Drake said.
Drake added that "to mobilize 10,000
people in a week is the biggest tribute to King
and his philosophy one could have had to his
birthday celebration."
In addition to the large number of marchers,
Drake also said it was significant that the local
authorities supported the rights of the mar
chers.
Drake said the march was the first instance
he had seen in the South where government

officials intervened in behalf of the de
monstrators. "I think it's important that a
mayor in Georgia would decide to make this
kind of stand," he said.
Drake interpreted the recurrence of anti
civil rights sentiment as "a backlash against
affirmative action. It's a revolt of white males
who feel they have been pushed too hard."
In the last three years, Drake said, the U.S.
Justice Department has been actively interven
ing in cases in police and fire departments on
behalf of the opponents of affirmative action. "I
think there has been a general atmosphere
supportive of Klan behavior, and the Reagan
administration has made very clear that a limit
concerning affirmative action had not been
reached."
Pointing out the unhealthy atmosphere for
civil rights, Drake noted Klan activity in the
nearby city of Pinole, Ga., where the "Klan is
recruiting in the high schools."
Drake said, "I feel this is a result of some
encouragements from Washington and that
there has been a feeling by white males that
they have been pushed by minorities and
women The Department of Justice has fed this
feeling a bit."

Ten thousand marchers gathered in Forsyth County, Ga., on Saturday to protest a recent
attack on a civil rights march. National Guardsmen were called out to protect the marchers
from flag-waving hecklers.
Carson also described Reagan's nega
tive contributions to the civil rights
movement. "Racism seems to have
been invigorated in the 1980s by the
attitudes of the people in the Reagan
administration," Carson said.
Carson also attributed current trends
of racism to the "general complacency
among whites that exists in the nation
about the need to do anything about
racism."
According to History Prof. Barton
Bernstein, such complacency has man
ifested itself in many aspects of Ameri
can society. "Basically, there are still
great inequalities in housing, educa
tion and many forms of segregation,
some subtle and some not," he said.
"The civil rights movement addres
sed many of the problems and solved
some part way: There are more blacks
on college faculties and in college than
25 years ago, and the very fact that you
can have a Martin Luther King day attests
to this."

The march — coming less than a week after
the celebration of the birth of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr. — drew a group
of almost 20,000 civil rights supporters to
Cumming, an all-white Georgia town of about
2,000 people. The marchers were protected by
2,300 National Guardsmen, who separated
them from several hundred Cumming citizens
and Klu Klux Klan supporters.
Speakers at the march included civil rights
leader Jesse Jackson, Correta Scott King and
former Sen. Gary Hart.
Saturday's march, which resulted in the ar
rest or detainment of more than 50 people,
came in response to a Klu Klux Klan inspired
disruption of a similar march by civil rights
demonstrators last week.

"I think the civil rights movement has suc
ceeded in achieving some changes, hut
(King's) dream of racial equality remains un
fulfilled," said Carson, who is currently direct
ing the Martin Luther King Papers Project.
Carson said, however, that "King's effort to
bring non-violent solution still remains the
best alternative."
St. Claire Drake, professor emeritus in an
thropology and sociology, found the march "a
sort of deja vu for me." Drake participated in
some of King's marches in the 1960s as "part of
the so-called 'non-violent body guard group.' "
He said he found Saturday's cries of "nigger go
home" similar to those heard in 1966: "Jungle
bunny go back to Africa."
"You'd think this wouldn't happen after 20
years," Drake said.
Drake added that "to mobilize 10,000
people in a week is the biggest tribute to King
and his philosophy one could have had to his
birthday celebration."
In addition to the large number of marchers,
Drake also said it was significant that the local
authorities supported the rights of the mar
chers.
Drake said the march was the first instance
he had seen in the South where government

officials intervened in behalf of the de
monstrators. "I think it's important that a
mayor in Georgia would decide to make this
kind of stand," he said.
Drake interpreted the recurrence of anti
civil rights sentiment as "a backlash against
affirmative action. It's a revolt of white males
who feel they have been pushed too hard."
In the last three years, Drake said, the U.S.
Justice Department has been actively interven
ing in cases in police and fire departments on
behalf of the opponents of affirmative action. "I
think there has been a general atmosphere
supportive of Klan behavior, and the Reagan
administration has made very clear that a limit
concerning affirmative action had not been
reached."
Pointing out the unhealthy atmosphere for
civil rights, Drake noted Klan activity in the
nearby city of Pinole, Ga., where the "Klan is
recruiting in the high schools."
Drake said, "I feel this is a result of some
encouragements from Washington and that
there has been a feeling by white males that
they have been pushed by minorities and
women The Department of Justice has fed this
feeling a bit."

Ten thousand marchers gathered in Forsyth County, Ga., on Saturday to protest a recent
attack on a civil rights march. National Guardsmen were called out to protect the marchers
from flag-waving hecklers.
Carson also described Reagan's nega
tive contributions to the civil rights
movement. "Racism seems to have
been invigorated in the 1980s by the
attitudes of the people in the Reagan
administration," Carson said.
Carson also attributed current trends
of racism to the "general complacency
among whites that exists in the nation
about the need to do anything about
racism."
According to History Prof. Barton
Bernstein, such complacency has man
ifested itself in many aspects of Ameri
can society. "Basically, there are still
great inequalities in housing, educa
tion and many forms of segregation,
some subtle and some not," he said.
"The civil rights movement addres
sed many of the problems and solved
some part way: There are more blacks
on college faculties and in college than
25 years ago, and the very fact that you
can have a Martin Luther King day attests
to this."
A civil rights march Saturday in northern
Georgia points out the continued presence of
racism and raises questions about the progress
of the civil rights movement, according to pro
fessors interviewed yesterday.
"I guess it (the march) demonstrates that the
problem of racism hasn't gone away," said
Assoc. History Prof. Claxborne Carson.
The march — coming less than a week after
the celebration of the birth of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr. — drew a group
of almost 20,000 civil rights supporters to
