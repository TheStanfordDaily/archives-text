India calls for border talks
NEW DELHI, India — The government announced yesterday that it has
invited Pakistan to discuss steps to defuse the dispute triggered by military
buildups by the rival nations along their frontier.
In Islamabad, Pakistani Prime Minister Mohammad Khan JuneJo called
for urgent talks about the border tensions, but declared that Pakistan was
ready to defend itself against aggression.
Meanwmile, Indian authorities imposed overnight curfews for one
month on all 63 villages bordering Pakistan in the northern districts of
Kathua, Poonch and Rajouri, scenes of heavy fighting in past Indo-Pakistani
wars, the government's All-India Radio reported.
The districts are in Kashmir state north of Punjab state, where India has
massed units to counter what it described as a Pakistani military con
centration on the frontier.
India's minister of state for external affairs, K. Natwar Singh, relayed the
invitation for discussions to Pakistan Ambassador M. Humayun Khan.
The invitation called for discussions in New Delhi between Foreign
Ministry secretaries of the two countries, Natwar Singh said.
The invitation set no date for the start of negotiations, but urged Pakistan
to send its delegation as early as possible. Natwar Singh said the Indian
team will be headed by Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Alfred Gonsalves.
He also said the invitation reflected India's desire that the "tension on
the border should be defused at the earliest."
Justice Dept. blocks merger
WASHINGTON — The Department of Justice said yesterday it would sue
to block the merger of two of the world's largest oil-well drilling equip
ment producers, Hughes Tool Co. of Houston and Baker International
Corp. of California.
The proposed merger would violate the Clayton anti-trust act by lessen
ing competition in two major markets of the drilling industry, said Charles
Rule, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's
anti-trust division.
The firms, with combined total sales of $3-2 billion in 1985, are two of
four major producers of tri-cone rock bits and electric submersible pumps
used in oil wells, officials said.
"If this merger is allowed to proceed there will be only three significant
competitors in each market," Rule said.
The merger would force up prices within the oil industry, he said.
Calls to Hughes and Baker went unanswered yesterday.
The two struggling oil-field services companies announced Oct. 22 they
planned to merge in a stock-swap deal valued at $456.5 million.
The agreement, approved by both companies' directors, would create a
new company named Baker Hughes Inc. to be headquartered in Houston.
To lock up the deal, each company granted the other the right to buy
18.5 percent of the other's stock, and Borg-Warner Corp., which owns 18.6
percent of Houston-based Hughes Tool's stock, agreed to vote in favor of
the deal.
Mandela taken by police
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Police took black activist Mandela and
her daughter from their home in the black township of Soweto yesterday
after confiscating some documents, a family member said.
A police spokesman at the police headquarters in Pretoria said Mandela
was not formally in custody and had not been arrested. He said, however,
that his answer did not rule out the possibility that she was being ques
tioned.
Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, was at the Protea police station in Soweto,
Ayob's wife said.
A man who answered the phone at the Mandela home in the Orlando
West section of Soweto said Mandela and her daughter, Zinzi, were taken
away by police at about 5:30 p.m. The man, who declined to give his name,
said he was a relative.
Mandela, wife of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, is one of the na
tion's most outspoken anti-apartheid activists.
Reporters said she had delivered a powerful address at a funeral in Sow
eto Saturday for a member of the outlawed African National Congress guer
rilla movement. Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 for
plotting sabotage as head of the armed wing of the ANC.
Poll: Dole challenges Bush
NEW YORK — Sen. Bob Dole is emerging as the leading challenger to
Vice President George Bush for the 1988 Republican presidential nomina
tion, according to poll results published yesterday.
Dole, the Senate minority leader, trailed Bush 36 percent to 15 percent
among those questioned for The New York Times-CBS News poll, a tele
phone survey of 1,590 adults conducted Jan. 18-21.
The Times reported yesterday that the poll suggested that whatever
damage the vice president suffered because of the Iran arms affair has been
greatest outside his part)- and he remains very popular among Republicans.
Former Sen. Gary Han is the leading Democrat in the race for the presi
dential nomination, the poll results showed, but New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo could pose a serious challenge.
Among those who said they would take part in Democratic primaries or
caucuses or had done so in the past, Hart led with 33 percent, Cuomo was
second with 17 percent and the Rev. Jesse Jackson followed with 9 percent.
Five other candidates were each favored by 3 percent or less of the re
spondents.
Trailing Bush and Dole among potential Republican candidates was
former Sen. Howard Baker with 9 percent and Rep. Jack Kemp with 6 per
cent. Five other Republicans tallied 5 percent or less.
The margin of sampling error of the survey varied from plus or minus 3
percentage points to plus or minus 5 percentage points, with the larger fi
gure applying to smaller subgroups, the newspaper said.
Onlx 18 percent of the respondents said they were locked into their
choice. With the lowa party caucuses still a year away, there was little indi
cation of a strong commitment to any of the candidates.

part of his life.
"I have a very serious interest in religion, in spirituality' and in religious
practice," said Brown, 48. "By upbringing I'm a Catholic, and a very strong
one at that.
"For many years, I wasn't paying a lot of attention to it, but as I have had a
chance now, after office, to reflect on it, it's a very powerful part of my
thinking and my background, and therefore it conditions those principles
that I bring to any public life that I might be in."
Brown, the son (if former Gov. Edmund "Pat" Brown, was governor from
1975 through 1982 He ran for president in 1971 and 1980, and in 1982 won

the guidance of Kwozo Yamada, u hom he described as "the only Buddhist
teacher who has these contacts in the Catholic world."
He said he began studying Zen under the advice of Jesuit priests and in
accord with "a very small strain or tendency within the larger Roman
Catholic world" to practice Zen meditation
