BONN, West Germany â€” West German voters re
turned Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coali
tion to power yesterday but reduced their support
for his Christian Democratic Party. The anti-NATO
Greens made impressive gains.
Official results showed a significant drop insup
port for Kohl's party compared with the last national
elections four years ago. But the results showed his
coalition with the small Free Democratic Party was in
no danger.
Johannes Rau, who ran for chancellor under the
banner of the main opposition Social Democratic
Party, conceded defeat on national television an hour
after the polls closed at 6 p.m.
"We wanted a change in the government, and we
didn't get it. We are the losers," Rau, the governor of
North Rhine-Westphalia state, told reporters at his
party's headquarters in Bonn, the federal capital.
Despite pre-election polls predicting a strong win
for Kohl, his Christian Democrats and their Bavarian
sister party, the Christian Social Union, received 44.3
percent, according to official tallies. The two parties
received a combined 48.8 percent of the vote in 1983.
The official results showed the business-oriented
Free Democratic Party received 9.1 percent of the
vote, up from 7 percent in 1983.
The Social Democrats also slipped from their 1983
returns, getting 37 percent of the vote, down from

38.2npercent.
According to the official figures, the Greens re
ceived 8.3 percent of the vote, well up from the 5.6
they got in 1983. The increase is expected to greatly
strengthen the party's hand in Parliament. A few in
dependents picked up the remaining votes.
Kohl, speaking at his party's headquarters in Bonn,
said the results for his Christian Democratic Union-
Christian Social Union coalition were "gloomy and
marked a painful loss."
"It is certainly disappointing, but we will not let
ourselves be discouraged," said Christian Democra
tic chairman Heiner Geissler, also speaking at the
party headquarters.
Among the biggest losers in the voting was Bava
rian Governor Franz Josef Strauss, head of the Christ
ian Social Union.
Projections showed the Christian Social Union lost
some six percentage points of the vote in Bavaria,
wmich would give the party its worst showing in the
conservative state since 1953.
Kohn had been riding high in public opinion polls
before yesterday's vote, buoyed by a healthy
economy and an upbeat national mood.
Many experts had predicted the Greens, with their
anti-NATO and pro-environment stances, would be
nefit greatly from two major environmental disasters
last year: the nuclear power plant accident at Cher

nobyl in April in the Soviet Ukraine and the
November spill of toxic chemicals into the Rhine
river from a plant in Switzerland.
"People have embraced our new ideas in the area
of peace and environmental policy," Otto Schily, a
leading member of the Greens, told reporters in
Bonn.
The Greens, originally a loose coalition of pacifists
and former student radicals, first entered Parliament
in 1983.
The elections were overshadowed by the kidnap
ping of two West Germans in Beirut, the capital of
Lebanon.
About 90 percent of eligible voters normally cast
ballots in West Germany. This year about 45 million
people were eligible to vote.
Kohl, 56, a conservative who appeals to strong fam
ily values, campaigned under the slogan "More of the
Same." He repeatedly emphasized the country's zero
inflation rate and steady economic growth.
He has been chancellor since October 1982. Voters
yesterday chose a chancellor for a term scheduled to
last four years.
Rau was hampered throughout the campaign by
divisions between the left and right wings of his So
cial Democratic party.
