MANILA, Philippines — Hundreds of soldiers said
to be loyal to ousted president Ferdinand Marcos
seized a television station on the outskirts of the capi
tal and tried to storm two Manila-area air bases early
today.
Military spokesman Col. Honesto Isleta said one
mutineer was killed in a firefight at Villamor Air Base
located at the Manila aiport. Chief of staff Gen. Fidel
Ramos said other soldiers tried to take over the
headquarters of the 15th Air Force strike wing at
Sangley Point in Cavite, 10 miles south of Manila.
Both mutinees were put down.
About 500 pro-government troops surrounded
offices of Channel 7 television on the outskirts of
Manila, blocked access roads and cut electricity after
dissident soliders seized the building.
There was no report of any move by the mutineers
against the presidential palace and spokesman
Teodor Benigno issued a statement saying President
Corazon Aquino wanted to assure the public she was
in complete control.
Government radio said the situation was normal in
other major cities such as Davao, Cebu and Zam
boanga City.

Witnesses said rebel soldiers mounted machine
guns on the roof of the private television station's of
fice. The mutineers wore red scarves and blue head
bands emblazoned with the words "Guardians" —
the name of a military fraternity linked to recent
coup rumors.
They were reported to be from units stationed
north of the capital.
Ramos urged the mutineers to give up. "There is
no hope for your cause. It is a lost cause," he said.
Ramos said the military was in control of the situa
tion and "supports the government of President
Aquino." He said the mutineers were Marcos loyalists
and that about 70 of them remained inside the televi
sion station.
Benigno quoted Aquino as saying the plotters had
been identified, but he did not name them. He also
quoted her as saying the plot was apparently aimed at
blocking yesterday's plebiscite on a new constitution.
There were conflicting reports about the number
of mutineers at the television station. Officers at the
scene first said there were about 300 but later re
ported they were not sure of the number.

Another military spokesman said more than 50 ,
mutineers took part in the takeover attempt at the air ;
base.
Col. Emiliano Templo, a loyal officer at the televi- ;
sion station, said the dissidents apparently had .
planned to take over Camp Crame, headquarters of ;
the Philippine Constabulary, the national police.
But pro-government troops got word of the plan
and secured the base. The dissidents then moved to
Channel 7, Templo said.
The Guardians fraternity claims the membership I
of about 70 percent of the officers and men of the
armed forces.
The government s Philippine News Agency re- ■
ported that the armed forces "aborted a major at- I
tempt by Marcos loyalist soldiers to take over military ;
installations and media facilities in metro Manila and
nearby provinces."
Security around Aquino's residence appeared nor
mal with no extra troops visible. There was no usual
movement of troops, traffic or police in downtown
Manila.
