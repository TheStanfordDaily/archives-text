# Hall to be released by Nicaragua
## American reported to be suffering mental problems 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua â€” The Sandi
nista government said yesterday it will
free Sam Nesley Hall, an American who
was accused of spying after being
seized last month in a restricted mili
tary area.
Angela Saballos, spokeswoman for
the Foreign Ministry, said the govern
ment decided to free Hall "for health
reasons." Hall, of Dayton, Ohio, served
in the Ohio House of Representatives
in 1964-65 and is a brother of Rep.
Tony Hall (D-Ohio).
Saballos said the government
"decided recently to deliver Sam Nes
ley Hall to his family because it is
impossible to place him in Nicaragua
in the type of institution doctors rec
ommend for him."
She declined to specify the ailment,
but other sources, speaking with the
condition they not be identified, said
she was referring to mental problems.
Saballos and Carlos Tunnermann,
Nicaragua's ambassador to the United

States, notified Rep. Hall of the govern
ment's decision.
No date was given for his release,
but Saballos said the government
hoped the congressman would come
to Nicaragua to take his brother home.
In Washington, Rep. Hall's press sec
retary, Michael Gessel, said the con
gressman received a call from Tunner
man about 5:30 p.m., telling him his
brother would be released, but no
timetable was established.
Rep. Hall, in a statement released by
Gessel, said: "My attorney, Gary
Froelich, is already in Managua. I have
asked him to get in touch with the
Nicaraguan government to see if he
can bring Sam back with him.
"I am grateful to the Nicaraguan gov
ernment for promising to release my
brother, and I look forward to seeing
him when this trauma is all over."
Tunnermann did not tell Rep. Hall
what medical problems his brother
was suffering, said Gessel.

He added that if Sam Hall is not
released to Froelich, then either the
congressman or his other brother, Mi
chael Hall, would go to Nicaragua to
take custody of him.
Rep. Hall, contacted in Washington
by telephone by The Associated Press
bureau in Columbus, Ohio, said details
for his brother's release had not been
completed, but added, "Hopefully,
they will be worked out in the next two
to three days. I'll probably be going
down in the next two or three days."
But he also said the family attorney,
Froelich, flew to Managua yesterday to
hire a Nicaraguan attorney in the event
of a trial and said Sam Hall might be
released to Froelich.
Sam Hall, 49, was seized Dec. 12 in a
restricted area near the Punte Huete
air base, 13 miles northeast of
Managua.
Officials said he had maps of military
targets stuffed in his socks. President
Daniel Ortega said Hall admitted

bringing explosives into the country
for U.S.-backed rebels, called contras,
fighting the Sandinistas.
No formal charges had been filed
against Hall, but Ortega said shortly
after the capture that Hall would be
tried by a Revolutionary Tribunal.
Onega also claimed Hall was spot
ting military targets for possible U.S.
air raids and suggested the prisoner
was mentally unbalanced.
Hall said he had been picked for the
Nicaraguan job on Dec. 8 and was paid
$12,500, but declined to elaborate,
other than saying he was not working
for the U.S. government.
The Reagan administration, with
support from Congress, is providing
military and other support to the con
tras.
The administration considers the
Sandinistas a Marxist dictatorship in
league with the Soviet Union and Cuba
and a threat to U.S. security and non
communist Central American states.
