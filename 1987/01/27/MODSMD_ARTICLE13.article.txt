# Power failure cuts Chem. exam short
## 
### 
A temporary campuswide power
blackout yesterday afternoon forced a
precautionary evacuation of the Old
Chemistry Building and interrupted
students taking a mid-term examina
tion.
The blackout, which began at ap
proximately 1:30 p.m., affected the
entire campus only briefly, but some
areas were without power for an hour
or more, according to University
Operations, Maintenance and Utilities
Stanford Medical School and offices,
Ventura Hall, the Psychology Trailer
and the Cancer Research Center were
affected by the blackout until yesterday
evening.
A spokesman for Operations, Main

tenance and Utilities last night did not
know the cause of the power failure.
The precautionary evacuation of the
Old Chemistry Building was routine,
according to Chemistry Prof. Nathan
Lewis. Because several electric smog
hoods stopped functioning during the
blackout, air circulation in the building
was impaired. In order to avoid a po
tential safety risk from chemical fumes,
the evacuation was ordered.
Students in Prof. Michael Payer's
Chemistry 31 class who were taking a
mid-term exam in the Old Chemistry
Building were evacuated and told to
complete the test at home during a 40
minute time period. The test will not
be graded, Payer said.
