## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Ideas for Tresidder 
### 
Ellie Oppenheim's recent decision to step down as the
director of Tresidder Union presents the Stanford com
munity with a golden opportunity to reassess the role of
Tresidder in the University. It is an opportunity that
should not be missed.
Presently, Tresidder serves as little more than a pit
stop for hungry students, faculty and staff. Its ambiance
and architecture resemble an airport lounge more than a
comfortable, friendly gathering place for students. Its
hours of operation, while certainly generous, are not ex
actly tailored to the odd hours kept by the student popu
lation. And the entire second floor of the building seems
woefully underutilized; so much of it is office space —
much of which, it should be noted, is used by student
groups — that becomes desolate after 5 p.m.
All of this is not to say that Tresidder is a failure. The
Store provides a wide variety of products at reasonable
prices, and the Corner Pocket is a Stanford institution.
Undeniably, sitting among the oak trees in the back of
Tresidder while sipping some cappucino with a friend is
relaxing and enjoyable.
But Tresidder Union could be so much better. The
Council of Presidents has a lot of good ideas, such as
adding a dry cleaning service and a video rental
shop.The COP has pledged to work with the administra

tion in seeking student input on ways to improve the Un
ion. The more suggestions the COP receives, the better.
Adding a television room to the second floor might be
a good idea, especially for those who live off campus.
Revamping the game room — adding a few more pool
tables, say, or a couple of pingpong tables — would also
help attract more students to Tresidder. While expand
ing Tresidder's hours may create some extra security
costs, it would be a worthwhile step. The information
booth on the first floor is an excellent resource, but it
could be expanded even more.
A well stocked news stand would be a welcome addi
tion, as would an ice cream shop — right now, there's
nowhere on campus to get a good hot fudge sundae. And
how about encoding meal cards so they could be used at
Tresidder? Students who are on a meal plan but miss
lunch or dinner shouldn't have to pay for their meals
twice.
Of course, there are probably a lot of people who have
their own ideas for improving Tresidder. These sugges
tions should serve as a starting point for discussion.
Hopefully, the University, the COP and the rest of the stu
dent body will take advantage of this opportunity to as
sign a more meaningful, relevant role to Tresidder Un
ion.
