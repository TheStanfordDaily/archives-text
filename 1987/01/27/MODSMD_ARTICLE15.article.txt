# Rethinking Reagan's library
## 
### 
A presidential library is an invaluable source of docu
ments on critically important contemporary issues that
should interest research scholars and students based in
several academic disciplines. It makes eminent sense,
therefore, to locate such a library on the campus of a major
research university.

DAVID ABERNETHY

For its part, a university should be aware that hosting a
presidential library carries with it potential costs as well as
benefits. Any president of the United States is, by definition,
a partisan figure, whose statements and actions while in of
fice are bound to arouse intense political controversy. A uni
versity's reputation, on the other hand, depends in large
measure on the public perception that it is a non-partisan
institution, that when it does occasionally take stands on
educational or other issues it is not motivated by a desire
either to support or to oppose a president's political
agenda. Because many Americans will interpret location of a
presidential library on a particular campus as a symbolic
statement of support for the president concerned, the host
university must take every precaution — out of concern for
its own integrity and reputation — to prevent such an inter
pretation from gaining wide currency.
Stanford's Hoover connection
If anything, extra precaution is called for in the case of
Stanford's offer to locate the Reagan Presidential Library on
its land. For this university has longstanding and highly
visible connections with another president of the same poli
tical party as Reagan — connections which, whether we like
it or not, already give the University a quasi-partisan image
in the minds of some people. For decades, the University's
most prominent landmark has been a tower not simply
named after Herbert Hoover but built quite explicitly in his
honor. This tower, moreover, is not just an archive of past
events. It is part of a nationally prominent, well-financed
and publicized, increasingly active research institution —
located in the very heart of the campus — whose published
output on a wide range of public policy issues is clearly as
sociated in the public mind with the Republican Party in
general and with the "Reagan revolution" in particular. That
there is a factual basis for this popular perception is made
abundantly clear by the Hoover Institution itself in its
recently published 1986 report.
To be sure, the Hoover Institution enjoys a high degree of
autonomy within the University. But it is difficult to explain
the complexities of the Hoover-Stanford relationship to
people outside the University, particularly when the institu
tion seems so anxious to publicize its Stanford affiliation to
the rest of the world. Understandably, many people believe
that the policy-oriented speeches, articles and books
authored by the institution's leadership and research staff
bear the University's imprimatur.
Limit visibility
How could Stanford University enjoy the scholarly benefits
of housing archival materials from an unquestionably signif
icant presidency, while minimizing the risk that its role as
Reagan Library host might give the University a reputation
for political partisanship?
For one thing, the library should be located in reasonable
proximity to the central campus, with every effort then
made to reduce its visibility from — and intrusiveness upon

— the rest of the campus. With these somewhat conflicting
ends in mind, the Reagan Library Committee on which I
served recommended in 1984 a site in the foothills near the
campus as one of three possible locations for the library —
but only if two conditions were met-.
1. The access road not be built on the open-space area to
the site (an alternative road was proposed);
2. "The facility will be designed to minimize visibility
from Junipero Serra Boulevard and be compatible with the
open space environment."
Unfortunately, while the foothills site was selected by the
Board of Trustees, our two conditions have, in my judg
ment, been abandoned. In May 1986 the Reagan Library
Committee reversed itself and voted to approve a direct
route up a particularly beautiful open valley to the library
site. In September the committee decided not to oppose ar
chitectural plans for a second story, overlooking the
campus, that can easily be seen from the boulevard and
along much of the Lagunita shoreline. How a "minimum
visibility" criterion can be compatible with a two-story
design, when a single story could meet the archival and con
ference needs of the library, remains a mystery.
I voted against both of these revisions of our committee's
original position, which the Board of Trustees then ratified.
Had I known in 1984 what would eventually become of the
Reagan Library Committee's two qualifying conditions, I
would not have concurred with the committee's original re
commendation of the Junipero Serra site.
Avoid partisan comments
Another way to avoid a reputation for partisanship is for
University officers to make no comments implying approval
of the person or policies of President Reagan as a factor in
the decision to bring his presidential papers here. Yet this is
precisely what the director of the Hoover Institution, Glenn
Campbell, has done. In "Introductory Remarks" to the insti
tution's 1986 Report, Campbell stated that "with the offer...
to President Reagan to locate his Presidential Library at Stan
ford 'in affiliation with the Hoover Institution,' and the pres
ident's acceptance of that offer, it is not only the Hoover In
stitution that can boast of a 'Reagan connection,' but also the
entire University The location of the Reagan Library at
Stanford and the cordial feelings that location shows toward
President Reagan are evidence that the Hoover-Stanford
crisis truly was 'the crisis that should never have been.' " (p.
14)
In addition to his position at the Hoover Institution,
Campbell chairs the Ronald Reagan Presidential Founda
tion, which is currently raising funds for the library and for
an off-campus Reagan Public Affairs Center. In order to be
an effective fund-raiser for the Public Affairs Center,
Campbell must take an openly political stand: namely, that
Reagan is a fine president whose legacy of ideas and policies
is worth maintaining long after Reagan has left office.
Campbell is, of course, entitled to hold such views. But at
the same time he serves as an academic executive officer of
Stanford University reporting to the University president. In
his role as University officer he should not be permitted to
make the kinds of statements that are appropriate for —
perhaps even required by — his other roles. We have here a
classic case of role conflict.
It is as a University officer that Campbell should be held
accountable for statements that endanger Stanford's reputa
tion for non-partisanship and that, consequently, call into
question the wisdom of locating the Reagan Library on this
campus.

tee.
