# Misconceptions about homosexuals
## 
### 
I don t quite understand the reason
ing James Spencer seems to be apply
ing in his recent letter (Daily, Jan 23),
but I do notice that he demonstrates
some significant misconceptions about
gay people that should be addressed.

STUART REGES

Misconception: It's OK to dis
criminate against gays.
Spencer denounces The Daily for
taking sides with the homosexuals "on
the moral high ground.'' He has
missed the point The Daily was trying
to make. As a social fraternity, the Zeta
Psi members have the right to be com
pletely arbitrary in their decisions
about who can and can't attend their
functions. But if they are given back

their house, they will be in control of a
scarce University resource, on-campus
housing. To deny that resource to gay
people is a violation of Stanford's non
discrimination policy.
Misconception: Christian morality
unequivocally denounces
homosexuality.
Spencer is following the consena
tive tradition of calling in Christianity
when all else fails. Such arguments
were put forth to support the idea that
the sun revolves around the earth, that
left-handed people are sinister, that
masturbation is wicked, that women
should be subjugated, that stores
should be closed on Sundays, and so
on Many of the Old Testament
strictures are not followed by modern
day Christians. Christ's movement was,
in many ways, a reaction against
simple-minded enforcement of such
rules. Paul denounces homosexualitv

along with just about every other kind
of sexuality, but Christ said nothing
about it. Thus, there is no reason to
believe that one can't be both
homosexual and Christian.
Misconception: Homosexuality is
an action.
Spencer is overemphasizing the sex
in homosexuality. He believes his con
demnation of gays doesn't constitute
prejudice, because "prejudice occurs
when people are judged by their exter
nal appearance instead of by their ac
tions." Such arguments are used to
condemn prostitutes, drug users and
others who choose to violate social
mores. Without much understanding
of religion, one could make a similar
argument that Judaism is an anion, that
of going to synagogue Thus, con
demnation of Jews isn't prejudice, be
cause it's based on the actions of those
immoral lews After all, couldn't thev

stay home or, better yet, go to a Chris
tian church? This argument is specious
because a person's religion is based on
personal beliefs, not on personal ac
tions. Homosexuality is closer in this
analogy to religion than to prostitution.
I'm gay because I fall in love with men,
not because I have sex with them
Let me close with a few words of ad
vice for James Spencer and any other
undergraduates who might have
similar feelings toward gay people.
One of the greatest gifts Stanford has to
offer you is the opportunity to meet a
wide variety of people. You will find
your Stanford education enriched if
you keep an open mind and make your
heavy-handed judgements after some
discussion rather than before.
