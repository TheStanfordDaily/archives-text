# A 						night at the roller derby
## 
### 
Rookie Sue Barkley has the jammer's helmet and moves
up on the pack. Veteran Joanie Weston, occupying the pivot
position, has flattened the entire Midwest Pioneer squad.
The Bay Bombers hold a slim lead. Barkley attempts to pass
Jan Vallow, the meanest roller derby queen to ever don a
uniform. Vallow throws a body block combined with an eye
gouge and Barkley is over the railing. Ten seconds remain
in the jam. Three — two — one — and it's over! The
referees award no score.

The Stanford Daily devotes an entire section of the paper
to fun and reasonably priced activities in the Bay Area. It in
cludes everything from sipping cappuccino in Sausalito to
the scenic 17-mile drive from Monterey to Carmel. Some
how The Daily has managed to neglect the most riotous and
affordable activity extant — a night at the Roller Derby.
Last Friday, an elite contingent from the Stanford Con
struction Management Program visited Richmond
Auditorium for the finals of the International Roller Skating
League (IRSL) Silver Cup tournament. It was the cultural
event of a lifetime. The $8 tickets included a preliminary
match, the tournament finals and an anticlimactic all-star
game to ensure the fans got their money's worth. Unfortun
ately, the hometown Bay Bombers were defeated in the
finals.
There is a cenain mood, an essential state of mind, that
has to be attained to properly appreciate a roller derby; first,
we took Mike's station wagon, which, just like everything
else he owns, he bought at a garage sale. You don't bring a
Mercedes to a roller derby — especially not one in Rich
mond. We downed a 12 pack of Budweiser on the way.
Heineken would be totally inappropriate. Roller derby fans
are not stupid. They could smell the beer breath of an elitist
a mile away. Since we couldn't find Popeye's Fried Chicken,
we completed the mood with a stop for Big Macs and fries
before arriving. You gotta blend in.
The anticipation built as we drove north. I thought back
to July 20, 1969. Every television station except one was
broadcasting Neil Armstrong's historic first steps on the
moon. Within my father's lifetime, space travel had gone
from a Buck Rogers fantasy to a technological reality that
every American could watch live in their own living room.
My father, who wanted to share this moment with his sons,
was dismayed to find my brother and I watching Honey
Sanchez and the Los Angeles T-Birds on the Channel 20
roller derby. Finally, after all these years, I was going to my
first (and probably last) live roller derby. Life just doesn't
get any better.
We arrived in time for the first match. We chose not to
risk a sellout for such a major tournament and purchased
our tickets in advance through Bass. It was wise to pay the
surcharge since only two-thirds of the seats remained vacant
throughout the evening. Roller derby is a no-frills sport.
There were no assigned seats, no press box, no season
ticket holders and noboby selling T-shirts or posters of the
stars. I could not even find a program to list the team mem
bers or learn whatever rules are associated with a roller
derby. If you don't already know the players and the strat
egy, you are an outsider.
There is no hype. Roller derby fans are purists. The price
of admission is all they are willing to pay, except perhaps
the price of a beer from the snack bar. You meet such won

derful people at a roller derby. One would have to visit the
race track on a weekday afternoon to feel that same sense of
bonding and togetherness with the crowd. After watching
several matches and making frineds in the beer line, I think
I understand the rules.
A roller derby has four 10-minute periods. The women
skate during the first and third periods while the men take
the second and fourth periods. The women are the most
fun. You can watch men collide in any sport from football
and lacrosse to ice hockey and boxing. If you want to see
women beat the hell out of each other, however, your op
portunities are limited to roller derby or mud wrestling.
A roller derby requires the following ingredients: two
teams with at least five men and five women, all of whom
can throw a punch while skating around a 30-degree in
clined track; two referees who pretend to control the match;
two coaches who wear the only two neckties in the
auditorium; someone to wear a white coat and stethoscope
to enhance the appearance of vicious combat; and, most im
portant, a fire-breathing announcer to bring the crowd to a
feverish pitch.
Each team has five players of the same sex on the rink at a
time. One position. The remaining members wear the hel
met color of their respective teams. Two players from each
team have crosses on their helmets and are called jammers.
The period consists of continuous counterclockwise skating
around the oval track while executing a series of plays
called jams.
The starting formation requires that the pivot people
(black helmets) lead the pack while the jammers (crossed
helmets) occupy the rear. The referee blows his whistle and
the jammers fight their way to the front. When the first jam
mer passes the pivots, the jam begins and will continue for
60 seconds or until it is called off, whichever comes first.
The lead jammer is the only person who can call off a jam
and does so by placing his/her hands on his/her hips. (To
the reader who referred to me as a "sexist homophobe"
after my Engineer Party Animal column, please note my at
tempt to desexify my column and the problems that it
causes. I hope you're happy.)
Points are scored when a jammer goes around the track
and passes opposing team members in the pack. One point
is awarded for each person overtaken. Usually the pivot (the
biggest, meanest person on a team) drops to the rear after
the jam starts and pounds on the jammers as they try to
score. That's when the fun starts. The pivot people can also
go around and score, but that is usually reserved for last
minute desperate scoring drives. After a jam, the crossed
helmets are often rotated to insure nobody gets too tired.
The skaters recreate their starting formation, and the next
jam begins.
No match ends in a tie. Sudden death (first score wins)
results if the score is even after the 40-minute match. Penalty
boxes exist, but which infractions justify being sent there
was not immediately clear. A certain sense of lawlessness,
arrogance and brutality is maintained throughout. That's
what sells tickets.
The matches were exhilarating; the action was fast paced;
and the crowd was in a frenzy. A roller derby should be part
of every Stanford student's cultural upbringing. Dollar for
dollar, it's the finest entertainment on the planet. If you want

ets, dial the Roller Derby Hotline at (415) 431-7888.
Now for the burning question many people ask: "Is it
fake?" Let me tell you the straight truth, and this is from the
heart. After witnessing the intensity of the competition, the
conditioning of the athletes and the force of the blows, you
will know once and for all — roller derby is for real!
