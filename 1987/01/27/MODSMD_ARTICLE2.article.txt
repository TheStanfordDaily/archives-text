### DAN DE LUCE Senior staff writer 
Eight protesters who participated in
an April demonstration at a Lockheed
plant in Sunnyvale were found guilty
yesterday of misdemeanor charges.
Several Stanford students attended
the Sunnyvale Municipal Court
proceedings to express their support
for the defendants' opposition to
Lockheed's major role in Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) research.
None of the defendants, however,
were Stanford students.
The jury had failed to reach a deci
sion last Friday, reportedly because
one juror — who happens to be a
Lockheed employee — was holding
out against a guilty verdict, according
to senior Bill Northway, who attended
the trial proceedings yesterday.
The protesters were on trial for mis
demeanor charges of obstructing traf
fic and trespassing, but some individ
uals were found guilty on only some of
the charges. The defendants will be
sentenced tomorrow.
Scott Bohning, a Stanford graduate
student arrested in an October protest
at Lockheed, said about half the jurors
in yesterday's case were Lockheed
employees or were related to the
employees of the Sunnyvale facility.
Bohning and another Stanford
graduate j>iudent at the October
protest pleaded not guilty last
Thursday to misdemeanor charges of
obstructing traffic and unlawful assem
bly (engaging in a lawful act in a viol
ent, boisterous or tumultuous man
ner).
Bohning, a third-year graduate stu
dent in civil engineering, and Carl Hill,
a second-year graduate student in Ger
man Studies, are scheduled to appear
at a pre-trial hearing next Thursday.
Seven Stanford students were ar
rested in the October protest at
Lockheed. Four students who pleaded
no contest were fined $50. Another
pleaded no counsel.
The prosecution focused its argu
ment on the property boundaries of
the Lockheed plant, while the defense
tried to present the issue as political,
and not criminal, in nature, said Boh
ning, who attended several sessions of
the trial.
Northway, who also followed the
case, said a police officer testified that
two undercover agents sat in on
several local meetings of No Business
as Usual (NBAl'), the national political
coalition that organized the protest.
The officer testified that a group of
law enforcement authorities, including
officials from the Air Force, met and
sent two agents to infiltrate NBAU
meetings to monitor its activities and
its political intent, according to
Northway.
The defense cross-examined Sunny
vale Staff Capt. Albert Scott about the
actions of the undercover agents, but
Scott claimed official privilege and
refused to answer questions, Bohning
said.
Senior Simon Durkin, who also at
tended yesterdays proceedings, said
he went to "lend them support."
As far as future plans for NBAU,
Northway said the group is planning a
protest on April 1, protesting the in
creasing militarization of American
policy.
