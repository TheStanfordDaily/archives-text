## 'You Can Make A Difference' stresses public service Conference looks at family in transition 
### NANNETTE THOMPSON 
Many Stanford students and commu
nity members may have a yearning to
get involved with public service on a
local or national level but don't know
where to begin.
1 he "You Can Make A Difference"
conference to be held at Stanford this
Saturday is one way for interested
people to learn about some of the
many opportunities available in the
public service sector.
"Students will benefit significantly
from (the conference by) seeing role
models who have gone out and com
mitted themselves to public service,"
said senior Jennifer Porges, who or
ganized the event along with fellow
senior Jean Kayser.
The conference is an annual student
run public service event focusing on a
socially relevant topic.
This year's theme, "Families In
Transition," was chosen for its timeli
ness and the interest it generated
among students and faculty. The con
ference will explore the theme
through a morning panel discussion
that will include keynote speaker
Robert Coles. In addition, there will be
10 afternoon workshops and a series of
dorm-based pre-conference work
shops held throughout this week
covering a range of topics from sub

stance abuse in the family to changing
gender roles.
This year's conference organizers
wanted to choose a topic that would
reflect the public service theme. About
50 students and faculty were involved
last spring in thinking up possible con
ference issues. The students then made
the final decision.

'Students will bene
fit significantly by
seeing role models
who have gone out
and committed
themselves to
public service.'

"Almost unanimously, families came
out on top," Kayser said. "It was sort of
like people knew this was going to be
such a hot issue. It has been in the
press (and)... has really gotten a lot of
front-page magazine stories and U.S.
Census Bureau reports."
The press explored many different
issues, including "two-parent families

... families of poverty (and) homeless
families," according to Porges.
The morning panel, moderated by
KCBS-TV anchor Valerie Coleman, was
designed to look "at the general issues
of families in transition," Porges said.
"Family is no longer just mother,
father, two kids and a dog."
The conference will "try to bring in
how families have changed, what prob
lems (and) opportunities have oc
curred because of those changes, and
how we (the public) can make a differ
ence," she continued.
The morning segment of the confer
ence will include the speech by Coles,
a noted author and Harvard professor
who has studied morality and the
formation of political views in children
from around the world. The coordina
tors hope that Coles — because he has
done research throughout the world
— will add an international perspec
tive to the conference's look at the fam
ily.
The four other panelists for the
morning discussion were chosen to
give the legal, governmental, media
related and corporate perspectives on
family issues.
The afternoon workshops will cover
topics such as divorce, teenage preg
nancy, violence within the family and
care for aging parents.
The public service theme will be
emphasized at these workshops,
Porges said. They will allow people to
"look at specific issues more in depth,"
and will allow "interaction (between)
the ... participants in the workshop
and the panelists," she said.
The workshop facilitators have been

gathered from a wealth of expert "local
talent" — people who are "out
working in the government and with
the poor," Kayser said.
The facilitators will "lead the audi
ence into a discussion of how they can
actually become involved, whether it
be in legislation or volunteering at a
food co-op or working in the counsel
ing center," she continued.
Unlike last year's conference, which
lasted one day, this year's event will in
clude a post-conference public service
fair on Tuesday, Feb. 3, as well as pre
conference workshops in Adams
House, Roble Hall, Yost House, Toyon
Hall and the American Studies House.
The motivation for planning these
pre-conference activities in the dorms
was two-fold. First, these sessions

could cover topics that the planners
"weren't able to cover in the afternoon
sessions (at the conference) but we felt
were strong issues," Kayser said.
Additionally, Porges said she hoped
the residence-based workshops will
educate students about the conference
and the Public Service Center (one of
the sponsors) as well as allow for more
student involvement.
Last year between 600 and 700
people attended the morning part of
the conference, and 450 went to the
workshops later in the day."(This
year) we hope to have 600 people
throughout the whole day, at least,"
Kayser said. "In the morning session
we expect there will be more."
Last year the participants were
crowded into Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
but this year Memorial Auditorium will

be used for the panel discussion.
Besides being more spacious,
Memorial Auditorium is conveniently
located close to the Graduate School of
Business, where lunch and the after
noon sessions will be held.
The post-conference event on Feb. 3
will be a "community service fair of
family-related community service
groups and local Stanford groups (that
will) encourage volunteering," Kayser
said.
Tickets for the Jan. 31 event will be
sold at noon in White Plaza through to
morrow, and from 8:30-9:30 on the
morning of the conference. The cost is
$3 for students, $12 for Stanford faculty
and staff, and $25 for community mem
bers. Additional information can be
obtained at the Public Service Center
on campus.
