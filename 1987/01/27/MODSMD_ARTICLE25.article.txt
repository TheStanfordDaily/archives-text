## Baseball defeats SJS in home opener Freshman Carey hits homer; Price picks up first victory 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Led by two newcomers to Stanford baseball, the Cardinal
atoned for Friday's season-opening loss at San Jose State
with a 7-1 drubbing of the Spartans yesterday at Sunken Dia
mond.
Junior Jeff Saenger, a transfer from Occidental College,
and freshman outfielder Paul Carey delivered the key hits in
the decisive five-run Stanford third inning.
With one out in the inning, Saenger lashed a bases-loaded
double to left-center field, knocking in all three Cardinal
base runners. One out later, Carey connected for the first
homer of his Stanford career, an opposite-field shot that
gave the Cardinal a hefty 6-1 lead.
Despite the team s first offensive heroics of the season,
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess wanted to talk about his
team's sterling defensive play.
"We played well defensively. 1 was concerned about our
defense after the inconsistency we experienced last season.
(Freshman) Brian Johnson played well in his first start at
third base," Marquess said.
"(Senior) Mark Machtolf came in at third and made two
super plays. (Sophomore) Ed Sprague did a great job catch
ing today. We also turned two double plays. I'm very happy
with our defense so far this season," he added.
Each Cardinal double play killed a Spartan rally.
The first came in the fifth inning when senior shortstop
David Esquer took a tailor-made ground ball up the middle,
stepped on second and fired to first to end the inning. In the
eighth, it was Machtolf starting a 5-4-3 double play to
squelch a San Jose threat and strand two Spartan runners.
Other shining defensive moments included senior
centerfielder Toi Cook's diving catch of Spartan second

baseman Chris Lasaca's looping line drive.
Cook, a cornerback who led the Cardinal football team in
interceptions this season, also knocked in Stanford's final
run with a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning. Cook, however,
is still hitless on the young season.
"Toi just started working out with us. He's been out since
Jan. 3. He'll be all right. We're not worried about him. If he's
not hitting, he's doing something else for us like stealing a
base or the great catch he made today," Marquess said yes
terday.
Unlike Friday's contest in San Jose, it was the Spartans
who jumped out to the early lead yesterday. And the top of
the first seemed to begin innocently enough.
Cardinal starting pitcher Rob Wassenaar got two quick
outs on ground balls to the shortstop Esquer. Then he hit
San Jose designated hitter Eric Nelson with a 2-1 pitch. After
back-to-back singles by rightfielder Rob Thomas and
leftfielder Rick Anderson, Wassenaar walked first baseman
Tom Hutler to force in a run. Wassenaar escaped the inning
by inducing third baseman Bob Straight to ground to
second.
The Cardinal was able to get the run back in the bottom of
the second when it loaded the bases with one out. Saenger
knocked a two-strike pitch into center for the first of his two
hits to get the inning started. Sophomore first baseman Ron
Witmeyer reached on an error by Hutler, and Paul Carey
walked to load the bases. Esquer grounded the ball sharply
at Lasaca, who made an outstanding diving stab to get the
putout at first and save a run.
"I fouled off three or four pitches and protected the plate
to try to get on base. The single came with one out. It seems
we really do well with one and two out," Saenger said of his
rally-sparking single.
Then the fireworks really started.

The Cardinal third opened with left fielder Ruben
Amaro's nubbed single. Second baseman Frank Carey fol
lowed with a base on balls. After Cook struck out, Sprague,
in only his second game at catcher, lined a single to left,
loading the bases and setting the table for Saenger's game
winning double.
"It really felt good. We've been practicing hard all week
because we haven't been hitting too well. Today we really
got it going," Saenger said.
"I was looking for a first-pitch fastball and guessed right.
I've faced (San Jose starting pitcher Anthony) Telford before
in summer ball, and I know what he likes to do in certain sit
uations. It was also an advantage seeing him for three in
nings Friday. The difference between Telford today
(yesterday) and Friday was today he got the ball up. At SJSU
he kept everything down at the knees," Saenger added.
With two out in the inning, Saenger scored on the left
handed hitting Paul Carey's opposite-field home run.
"I was looking fastball. My first at bat he walked me, and
they were all curve balls that he wasn't throwing for strikes.
The second at bat he had me down 1-2, and I figured he'd
go to the fastball. I got the right pitch. Mentally I was better
prepared for Telford than the pitchers who followed him,"
Carey said.
"Waiting on the ball and hitting opposite-field line drives.
That's our whole philosophy," said Saenger, who sent one
hit up the middle and one to the opposite field himself.
The other Cardinal tally came in the fourth inning. It
began with a walk to Amaro after one out was recorded.
Amaro stole second, the Cardinal's first theft of the season.
Frank Carey reached on Straight's error at third, advancing
Amaro to third. Cook delivered his sacrifice fly before Carey
was caught stealing to end the inning.
The only negative Marquess was able to find was in the
Cardinal pitching. Wassenaar struggled through three in
nings, allowing a run and two hits while walking one batter
and hitting another. He was followed by Jim Price, who
pitched through the seventh to gain his first win of the

season. He walked four and hit a batter in holding the Spar
tans scoreless.
Brian Keyser and Al Osuna finished the game with an in
ning apicce, walking two and one, respectively. Over the last
five innings, the Cardinal staff gave free passes to seven
Spartan batters.
"I was disappointed we didn't throw as many strikes as a
pitching staff. Price threw well when he got the ball to the
plate OK, but we walked too many people," Marquess said.
"Wassenaar wasn't real sharp. He was up with a lot of
pitches. They only got one run off him, but it wasn't really a
good outing. But he knows how to pitch, and even when he
doesn't have his good stuff he's going to stick around in a lot
of games," he added.
But they got the key hitters out, and that was the ballgame.
"It was a great team win today. Everybody contributed
both offensively and defensively," Paul Carey said.
One got the feeling watching this game that there is
something just a little different about this Cardinal team,
something separating it from teams of the past.
The slash-and-run offense is still present with the likes of
Frank Carey, Amaro and Cook. The Cardinal will continue to
manufacture runs where normal teams have no business
scoring at all. But there's a sense with this club that a blend
of new and old talent has brought an explosive quality to the
Stanford attack that wasn't as prevalent in last year's squad.
"We played a good game today, but we still have a time
bomb that's going to explode. We've got a lot of players on
this team that can really hit the ball," Paul Carey said.
"We haven't shown our true colors just yet," added
Saenger, an NCAA Division 111 All-American in 1984 as a
freshman.
Saenger also noted that the Cardinal's awakening today at
the plate can be attributed to the Stanford coaching staff.
"The big difference between this level and the Division
111 level is about 30 more games on the schedule. In terms
of preparation, it is teriffic what the coaches have done to
get us ready," Saenger said.
