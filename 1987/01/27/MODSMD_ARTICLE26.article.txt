### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
Things just keep looking up for the
Cardinal women's basketball team. Not
only are they off to a 11-6 start and only
one game out of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence lead, but guard Jennifer Azzi was
just named the Pac-10 Plaver of the
Week.
The freshman from Oak Ridge,
Tenn., has been making a name for
herself all year, but her exploits of late
have been outstanding. On Jan. 15, she
recorded the first triple-double in
Stanford history (14 points, 10
rebounds and 16 assists), shattering
the school assist record of 11 in the
process.
Last week she continued her out
standing play. On Thursday, against
Arizona State, she scored a career-high
18 points (also a game high), tallied
eight assists, five rebounds and three
steals.
On Saturday, she had 16 points, 13
assists (the second highest total ever),
three rebounds and five steals al
though she was pulled with 12 minutes
left to keep the score respectable.
For the week, she shot 63 percent
(12 fot 19) from the floor, was 10 of 10
from the line and averaged 17 points,
four rebounds, 10.5 assists and four
steals per game
"1 think that she's been playing
well," Stanford Coach Tar.". VanDerveer
said. "She's been shooting better
(since an injury to a finger early in the
season has healed somewhat).
"I think a lut has to do with the team
contribution," she continued. "She
complements the others well."
Azzi was happy with the announce
ment, but cares more for team results.
"It's a nice honor," she said, "but I'd
rather win than have these honors."
Thanks in part to her play, the Card
inal now is winning, and winning of
ten
Stanford raced out to an 11-5 record
last year, but a nine-game losing streak
left the Cardinal at 13-15 for the vear.

This year's team shows no signs of
slowing down, however. It's 11-6
record includes a tough three-point
loss to then fourth-ranked Virginia, and
a 5-2 record in the powerful Pac-10.
"I know we can compete on a na
tional level," Azzi said. "Provided we
play well, I think we can beat anyone in
the Pac-10."
They will have to keep up the level
of play, though, as they travel for their
next four league games.
The Cardinal is shooting for a high
finish in the conference, and thinks
three or four league teams will qualify
for NCAAs. If Stanford qualifies, it
would be the Cardinal's first appear
ance in five years.
Only starter Erica Mueser gets signif
icant playing time among the seniors,
with two freshmen, a sophomore and a
junior completing the startering line
up.
VanDerveer said of Azzi: "She's a
young player who's just going to get
better."
And the same is true of most of the
team. Leading the way is junior Kami
Anderson with 15 points per game and
freshman Katy Steding with 12.0
scoring and 7.8 rebounding averages.
Mueser is also scoring in double fig
ures, and sophomore Jill Yanke pours
in 9 9 points per contest. Azzi still runs
the show, though.
"I think she runs the break as well as
anyone," Vanderveer said. "She under
stands the team concept."
The rookie's electrifying open-court
play has also provided another advan
tage. The crowds at Maples Pavilion
have gotten consistently bigger
throughout the season. "The fan sup
port has been really great," Azzi said.
Azzi also has a strong competitive
edge. As an All-American performer in
highschool, she led her team to a four
year 85-11 record and was 50-0 in
junior high school. "Her background is
geared to winning," VanDerveer said.
"She wants her team to do well."
And the way it looks, she's getting
what she wants.

Azzi. Ihe Oak Ridge, Tenn., native shattered the Stanford assist record
with 16 on Jan. 15 against Brigham Young and completed the first triple
double in school history by adding 14 points and 10 rebounds. Azzi was
