# All-American QB chooses Stanford
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Jason Palumbis, a star quarter
hack at Oregon's Lakeridge High
School in Lake Oswego, who was
named to Parade Magazine's High
School All-America Team, has an
nounced that he will sign a national
letter of intent to play football at
Stanford.
The national signing period
begins Feb. 11.
Stanford Recruiting Coordinator
Dick James said that because of
NCAA regulations, "he can make no
comment as to whether he
(Palumbis) has visited here,
whether we are recruiting him or
whether he will sign."
In an interview with The Daily
last night, however, Palumbis, when
asked if he had decided on Stan
ford, said, "I sure have."
Considered to be one of the top
quarterback prospects on the West

Coast, the 6-foot-3, 200-pound
Palumbis was recruited by several
schools. He showed the most inter
est in Stanford, lowa and Pittsburgh
with his final decision coming
down to the Cardinal and the Pan
thers.
"I chose Stanford over Pittsburgh
because I felt better about Stan
ford," Palumbis said. "I guess
there's really not a reason. It
(Stanford) is a great environment, a
great school â€” great everything."
Palumbis also indicated that the
location of Stanford was a factor in
his decision. His parents will be
able to see most of his games since
he would be playing closer to
Oregon, he said.
The quarterback opening created
by the graduation of John Paye was
also in the back of his mind,
Palumbis said. "1 took that into con
sideration," he said. "I'm gonna go
in competing for a starting job. I'd like
to start, but I know there will be some
stiff competition. Greg Ennis (who
started in last month's Gator Bowl) is a
great quarterback, and so is
(freshman) Scott Stark."
Palumbis threw for 19 touchdowns
and more than 1,500 yards in seven
games this fall as a senior prior to suf
fering a separation of a joint in his right
shoulder.
The iniurv will not have any long

term consequences, he said. "I'm
throwing 100 percent again. It was a
pretty minor thing."
While being recruited by Stanford,
Palumbis received a phone call from
John Elway, the former Cardinal great
and son of Stanford Football Coach
Jack Elway. "He just wanted to talk
about Stanford and asked if I had any
questions," Palumbis said of the
younger Elway. "It was great talking to
him."
College football runs in the family.
Palumbis' older brother Gary was a
three-year starter for Portland State on
the defensive line.
