# Women fencers win two meets
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Last Friday afternoon as most of the
Stanford student body relaxed after a
long weekend and began to celebrate
the new weekend, the men's and
women's fencing teams went to work
with an arduous meet against Fullerton
State and Air Force.
The women's squad continued its
winning ways with a 13-3 victory over
the Titans and a narrow 9-7 win over
Air Force to up its record to 9-3 on the
year. Senior Holly Taylor, the No. 1
fencer on the women's team, was 8-0
on the day, and won each of her four
matches against Fullerton with a 5-0

score. Taylor's overall record this
season now stands at 40-5.
"Holly Taylor was superb as usual,"
Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst said. "She
had no touches scored on her against
Fullerton. She's having a great year;
she's exceeding even my relatively
gotxl expectations."
"She's pretty amazing," said
teammate AJyson Yarus, who won all
four of her matches against Fullerton
and was 3-1 against the Falcons. It's
nice because she's reliable. You know
she's up next, and you don't have to
worry if she's going to win or not."
Of her own bouts Yarus said: "I
thought I did really well. It was really
satisfying because Air Force had a mys
tique for me 1 was really pleased to
destroy. 1 have this problem about the
military; they come in and do militaris
tic warmups and make a lot of noise.
It's really hard to be up against that."
"Alyson has taken over that No. 2
spot and is doing a good job for us,"
Hurst said.
The Fullerton women's squad was
second in the region behind Stanford
last season, so the relatively easy win
was something of a suprise. "We both
graduated a lot of people,'' Hurst said.
"Obviously we've recovered better
than they did."
The men's fencing team did not fare
as well, downing Fullerton 18-9 but
falling by an identical score to Air
Force.
The outstanding performances on
the day came from the men's sabre
squad, as senior Steve Levitan was 6-0,
winng all his bouts against both teams.
Mike Kramer and David Fishman were
both 3-0 against the Titans, as the Card
inal defeated Fullerton 9-0 in the sabre
competition.

After downing Fullerton State 18-9 last Friday, the Stanford men's fencing team fell to Air Force by the same score,
despite winning the sabre competition 6-3. Air Force took the foil competition 9-0 and won the epee 6-3. Stanford
won both epee and sabre events against Fullerton, but dropped the foil portion of the meet 6-3.
