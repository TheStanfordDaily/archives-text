# Can Giants repeat next season?
## 
### 
PASADENA (AP) — Bill Parcells outlined a simple
formula yesterday for breaking the cycle of new
Super Bowl winners each year: Get more good
players and don't worry about historical trends.
I don t think history means one thing in football,'
said the New York Giants coach, still euphoric after
the 39-20 victory over Denver Sunday that brought
the team its first NFL title in 33 years and extended to
seven the number of seasons without a repeat Super
Bowl winner.
"Next year it's a new game. If we had a game today,
yesterday wouldn't mean a thing," Parcells said.
The Giants' victory completed a season every bit as
dominant as the seasons of the last two Super Bowl
winners, San Francisco and Chicago. Both were
proclaimed sure repeaters, and each failed.
The Bears, without injured quarterback Jim
McMahon, went 14-2 against a soft schedule but lost
to Washington in their first playoff game. The year
before, the 49ers went 10-6, settled for a wild-card
berth in the playoff and lost the first game to the
Giants.
1 he last team to win consecutive Super Bowls was
the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1979 and '80.
New York's victory over Denver Sunday was its
12th straight and gave the Giants a 17-2 record for the
year. In three postseason games, the Giants out
scored San Francisco, Washington and the Broncos
by an aggregate of 105-23, comparable to the Bears'
91-10 playoff run over the Giants, Los Angeles Rams
and New England Patriots a year ago.

Parcells says next year will begin with him tomor
row, if he decides to attend the testing camp in In
dianapolis for college seniors.
"The idea for next year?" he asked. "Maybe get
some more players. Come back with a renewed at
ttitude.
To get more good players is the whole idea. Keep
getting them and collecting them. Don t listen to that
thing that players will be unhappy if you have too
many good players. I can tell you one thing — there
are no unhappy guys on my team today."
Realistically, there wouldn't seem to be many ways
for rookies to make the Giants.
The one thing they probably need the most — a
deep receiving threat — is expected to be their top
priority in the draft.
And even the midseason problem at wide receiver
was alleviated some by the return of Lionel Manual
from 12 weeks on injured reserve and some late
season help from second-year man Stacy Robinson,
whom the Giants expect to play a major role in their
future.
Offensively, New York should be helped by the ex
pected return of George Adams, who missed the
season with a slow-healing hip injury. Along with the
developing Lee Rouson and Ottis Anderson, Adams
gives New York another runner if, for example, Joe
Morris were injured.
The defense, meanwhile, should get even better as
the five rookies taken in the first two rounds of last
year's draft develop. All five contributed this year —

defensive backs Mark Collins and Greg Lasker from
early in the season and linebacker Pepper Johnson
and linemen Erik Howard and Eric Dorsey late.
There is little age on the Giants.
Defensive end George Martin, who sacked John El
way for a safety Sunday, said after the game that he
didn't know if he wouid be back next season at 34,
and Dorsey is being groomed for his spot.
Linebacker Harry Carson, who turned 33 in Novem
ber, had perhaps his best season in three years and
will return. Johnson is his eventual replacement.
But personnel is not necessarily what hurts a team
trying to repeat. "You've got to be lucky," Parcells
said yesterday.
One factor is injuries — the Giants couldn't afford
the lengthy loss of quarterback Phil Simms or
linebackers of the caliber of Carson, Lawrence Taylor
and Carl Banks and remain a Super Bowl team.
Moreover, no offensive line starter has missed a
down because of injury in two years.
Another is concentration. A Super Bowl winner,
particularly in a media center like New York, receives
so much acclaim that the players often find it hard to
refocus their attention on football.
Simms, for example, was asked yesterday after re
ceiving the Most Valuable Player award for his 22 of
25 performance Sunday if he planned on writing a
book. He said he had been approached, then added:
"There's going to be so many books out, so much
stuff, that in a couple of weeks I'm going to hate the
Giants too."
