LONDON (AP) — Eating, drinking
and cheering, gridiron buffs across
Europe stayed up until the wee hours
of the morning yesterday to watch the
New York Giants beat the Denver
Broncos 39-20 in the Super Bowl.
Despite a time difference of eight
hours, football fans from Britain to
West Germany ignored the temptation
to get a good night's sleep in time for
work, preferring to stay up and watch
the long-awaited climax of the NFL
season.

In Britain, where the game did not
end until 3:30 a.m., Channel 4, a na
tional television station, broadcast the
Super Bowl live for the fifth successive
year.
In the chair in Pasadena were the
station's regular football commenta
tors, Frank Gifford and John Smith,
with Miami Dolphins Coach Don
Schula providing analysis of individual
plays.
Station officials said it would be
several days before ratings were

known but hoped last years' peak fig
ure of 6.3 million viewers could be
repeated.
While most Britons watched the
game at home, others attended
American-style Super Bowl parties,
complete with beer, hamburgers and
other football fare.
Cheerleader Productions, which
produced the Channel 4 program,
hosted a private function at a down
town London hot spot, where 800
guests created a typical championship

game atmosphere, many in Giants and
Broncos colors.
Among the Americans on the guest
list was Sandy Bull, who moved to Lon
don from her home in Chattanooga,
Tenn., four years ago. She said her hus
band, an Englishman, had become a
football fanatic since Channel 4 began
showing weekly highlights on NFL
games.
"When it started up here, he didn't
understand a thing and thought it was
terribly boring," she said. "He's really
hooked now."
In Paris, some 400 customers at the
Chicago Pizza Pie Factory, just off the
Champs Elysees, drank French wine,
ate American pizza and watched the
game on any of 30 television sets
placed strategically around the restau
rant.

"Last year there were about 98 per
cent Americans here," said Tom Nel
son, a St. Louis native who works for an
accounting firm in Paris. "This year it
was about half French. And the French
left early."
Only diehard Americans and scat
tered Frenchmen stayed to the very
end. The excitement generated
whenever underdog Denver had
chances to score early in the game
turned to resignation as the favored
Giants began to dominate.
"At least it was close for a while,"
Nelson said.
