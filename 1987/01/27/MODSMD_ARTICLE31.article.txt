EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) —
The Super Bowl champion New
York Giants will be given a warm
reception in a frosty stadium today
by 77,000 kazoo-blowing, confetti
throwing fans, many of whom have
waited three decades to celebrate
an NFL title.
New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean
will present the players with gold
medallions for their 39-20 victory
over the Denver Broncos in
Pasadena on Sunday.
The victory gave the Giants their
first NFL title since 1956, and team
officials said they wanted the
celebration to take place where the
Giants made it happen this year —
in the 76,891-seat Giants Stadium.
Weather forecasters said partly
cloudy skies and 25-degree temper
atures were in store for the outdoor
party. That temperature would be
52 degrees cooler than the temper
ature at kickoff time in Pasadena
Sunday.
Workers labored all day Monday
preparing the snow-covered
stadium for the 10 a.m. bash.
Crews shoveled snow from the
aisles and bulldozed it from the
parking lot. A stage was set near the
eastern goal line, and blue-and-red
banners were hung from the bal
conies.
New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority spokesman Paul Wolcott
said that $650,000 had been raised
through privation donations to
stage the party, which will be
hosted by comedian Joe Piscopo, a
New Jersey native.
Other entertainment will be pro
vided by comic Henny Youngman,
professional wrestler Captain Lou

Albano, and The Roches, a female
singing group.
Film highlights wil be shown,
marching bands will perform, and
as a grand finale the crowd will play
"California Here 1 Come" on
kazoos. The song is in reference to
next year's Super Bowl, to be held
in San Diego.
Wolcott said the first 73,000 seats
will go to season ticketholders and
their friends and families on a first
come, first-served basis,. When the
chairs fill up, another 8,000 people
may watch from the tarp-covered
field. And anyone else can wait in
the parking lot and hope the Giants
make an appearance.
"We're trying to get them to go
out to the parking lot," Wolcott said.
"But we're not sure yet. Some of the
program still has to be worked
out."
In the stadium's private club
house yesterday, employees of the
sports complex and family mem
bers prepared gift packages for
fans.
Many were called first thing yes
terday morning and offered $7 an
hour to stuff pompons, buttons,
confetti and kazoos into plastic
grocery store bags.
Absent from the gala will be New
York City Mayor Edward Koch, who
is vacationing in Poland. Koch
snubbed a Manhattan victory
parade for the team, a move that
sparked a number of offers from
mayors of cities on the western side
of the Hudson River in New Jersey.
Koch changed his mind when the
American Express Co., offered to
pay for a parade.
