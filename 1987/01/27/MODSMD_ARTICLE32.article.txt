# Simms emerges as star at last

### 
ANAHEIM (AP) — Call it the turning
point of Phil Simms' career.
And no, it didn't happen Sunday in
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena with a
record-setting passing performance
that carried the New York Giants to a
39-20 Super Bowl victory over the
Denver Broncos.
It happened three years earlier,
when Scott Brunner beat him out for
the starting quarterback job.
"My biggest doubts were, was I ever
going to play as well as I thought I
could," Simms said. "I always thought I
could play well, but I never was doing
it. I was beginning to wonder. It was
never working out."
Injuries had kept him on the
sidelines more often than not in his
first four seasons, but in 1983, it was
Brunner. And when Simms finally did
get in, he fractured a thumb.
The Giants eventually went 3-12-1
with Simms missing 14 games.

"It was probably the turning point in
my career because I don't know if I
could have done anything," said
Simms.
In 1984, Simms was named the No. 1
quarterback, and the Giants now have
gone to three straight playoffs. Much of
that, Simms credits to better players
and a radical change in the offensive
philosophy.
"I was working out at the stadium
that spring and he (Coach Bill Parcells)
told me to work on nothing but throw
ing 20-yard in cuts and 20-yard out
cuts. That's Ron Erhardt's philosophy,
and I think it's the perfect offense for
me right now."
On Sunday, it worked to perfection
against the Broncos. Simms hit 22 of 25
passes for 268 yards and three touch
downs and guided the New York of
fense to 30 points in the second half.
He was named the game's most
valuable player.
