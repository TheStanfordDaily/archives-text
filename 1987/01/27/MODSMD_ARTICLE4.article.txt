Overcoming feelings of self-hatred and in
feriority are the biggest problems black children
face, a women's shelter worker told a small group
at the Women's Center last night.
Isoke Femi, who works at the Mid-Peninsula
Battered Women's Shelter, said the worst aspect
of racism is internalized in the black child's head.
"You're ugly, you're stupid," are the messages
that black children internalize, Femi said. These
messages lead to a feeling of self-hatred that is
hard to overcome.
"I came out of the boarding school not
knowing who 1 was," said the 36-year-old Femi,
looking back on her childhood days. She spoke of
black resistance to her adoption of "white" man
nerisms. When she went home from school, she
said, black people asked her, "How come you're
talking like a white girl?"
Femi suggested whites should "raise their level
of awareness" of racism, instead of feeling guilty

for what their forefathers did. She said the white
attitude of guilt often served as a "cop out" for
remaining ignorant of racist problems.
Against the backdrop of a poster of a black
woman and the words "Bread and Roses," Femi
sang a song that illustrated the dilemma of the
black woman raising children.
Femi sympathized with the problems of being
a black parent. She noted the danger of passing
on "some of the inferiority stuff' to the child. She
also mentioned the black woman's fear of being
poor and "not being able to make it."
Parents should be open and honest about the
differences between people of different colors,
instead of "mystifying them,'" she said.
"Differences are there to be celebrated."
Femi spoke of the problems her mother faced
as a black parent: having to prevent Femi's
brother from manifesting his rage, having to
make the children aware of discrimination and
having to teach the children that "not all white
people were the same."
