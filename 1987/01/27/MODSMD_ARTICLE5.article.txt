# Union, Food Service clash over Flo Mo work changes
## 
### SUHA JHAVERI 
An increased workload for union
employees at Florence Moore Food
Service has created tension between
labor and management, according to
Michael Schmitz, a member of the
Student Labor Support Committee, a
group that supports the union.
Last fall, Florence Moore Food
Service Manager Margery Copeland
and University Food Service
Manager James Keeton decided that
two kitchen positions held by stu
dent hashers were unneeded and
eliminated them.
"Mrs. Copeland has a much higher
level of staff-per-student ratio than
other dining halls do, " Keaton said.
"This fall, we readdressed the issue
and found those two positions un
necessary."
The United Stanford Workers
(USW), which represents more than
1,300 service, technical and main

tanence workers, disagrees.
USW claims that the elimination of
the positions coupled with an in
crease in the number of entrees
served has increased the workload
of union employees, and thus vio
lated the union's contract.
"When you sign a contract, you in
herently expect the prevailing condi
tions to continue," said USW Field
Representative Rodney Barnett.
"They cannot change the contract,
increase the workload, without
renegotiating the contract."
The Student Labor Support Com
mittee claims that management has
encouraged the cooks to take short
cuts in their cooking in order to
compensate for the increase in
duties.
The committee also said USW
workers at Florence Moore are
harassed by management
"Union members have been sin
gled out and hawk-eyed during

breaks, while non-union members
are treated more liberally," Schmitz
said.
"The brunt of this is falling on
Head Chef Rafael Verbera," he said.
Verbera serves as Florence Moore
Food Service's USW representative
and has worked for University Food
Service for 28 years.
"Margery Copeland is just trying to
get rid of him," Schmitz said.
Copeland was unavailable for
comment.
Schmitz also said Copeland has
forbidden workers from speaking
Spanish in the kitchens and refuses
to allow translators to assist in em
ployer/employee meetings. He said
that most of the workers are Latino
and only speak Spanish.
Keeton denied the allegations.
"That was never said We have no
policy like that in University Food
Service nor Florence Moore."
Keaton said he was trying to find out
the "real issues" in the allegations of
harassment at Florence Moore, but
added that no grievances had been
filed.
Both Schmitz and Barnett disputed
this claim.
"About 15 grievances have been
filed, Barnett said. We intend to con
tinue processing them, but the issues
take so long, and Copeland isn't willing
to resolve anything at all."
