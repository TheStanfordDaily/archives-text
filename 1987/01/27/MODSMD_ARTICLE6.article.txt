# Conklin evicts two from Hurlburt
## 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
Two residents of Hurlburt House have been
evicted from the house by Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Diana Conklin for alleged vandalism and
rowdy behavior in violation of the University's
residence agreement.
The two students, Nicholas Howell and Mark
Berzins, have been ordered to leave the
University-operated Row house by Friday. They
will not be permitted to live in any University
residence, including fraternity houses, until fur
ther notice, Conklin said.
Disciplinary action may also be taken against
five other students, whose involvement in the in
cident is currently under investigation. Conklin
said she would decide today whether she will
punish other residents.
Berzins and Howell, both sophomores, are
roommates at Hurlburt. Both are active members

of the now-unrecognized Delta Upsilon fraternity.
Conklin cited "extreme and prolonged loud
ness (well past 3 a.m.) ... extensive destructive
ness to University property ... the creation of a
serious safety hazard which imperiled other
members of the house," and the "sending of a
false fire alarm" as reasons for evicting the stu
dents.
Conklin said the two students "shared respon
sibility" for the damage done to Hurlburt on Jan.
15, although they did not necessarily cause all the
damage themselves.
Damages to Hurlburt included a pulled fire
alarm, broken fire boxes, holes in the wall, a bro
ken screen and handrail, and trash strewn about
the dorm. The cleaning bill for Hurlburt
exceeded $1,000.
Conklin explained that the "serious safety haz
ard" occurred when one Hurlburt fire escape was
rendered "unsafe for use" because it
was covered with vomit and urine.
Conklin specified that in their ac
tions, the two students had violated a
contractual agreement — the Inner
sity's residence policy — but not nec
essarily the Fundamental Standard.
Conklin said she made the decision
to evict the students with the consent
of Director of Housing Roger Whitney,
who is also an assistant dean of Resi
dential Education.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole said
she has not yet decided whether she
will conduct her own investigation.
Cole said that she had just received a
report on the incident from the Row
Office and that she has offered to meet
with the students involved.
Both Conklin and Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson said
that one of the two evicted students
had been inside 553 Mayfield, the
former DU house, on the night of Jan.

15, when that residence was van
dalized. Howell and Berzins denied
having been inside the house, saving
that the closest they came to 553
occured when they were at Sigma Chi
and Beta parties.
Neither student wished to press
charges against the University, al
though both emphasized they did not
teel that the University had given them
a viable chance to prove their in
nocence.
It makes me just incredibly bitter
that there is no due process of the
law, Berzins said. We feel that the
I niversity was unjust.
Both students also emphasized that
their alleged violations were in no way
connected with the 1)1' fraternity. Rob
inson agreed.
The fact that they're 1)1's is irrele
vant,'' Robinson said. "Each one is
being dealt with for having violated the
terms of a contract he had signed with
the University.
"(It was) clearly their own behavior
that brought on this action," Robinson
added. "These are the consequences of
their actions."
