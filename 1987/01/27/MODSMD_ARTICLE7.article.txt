# Western Culture debate
## Colleges review courses 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The ongoing Western Culture debate at Stan
ford points up a nationwide challenge to colleges'
traditional concepts of the Western civilization
core.
In recent years, educators have begun to cast a
more global framework on their vision of what is
"essential knowledge." Many colleges are adding
Third World or ethnic studies course require
ments, and many are integrating studies of other
cultures into existing Western civilization
courses.
"There has certainly been an upsurge of inter
est in internationalist issues and studies," said
Louis Albert, director of professional services at
the American Association of Higher Education.
In the last three years, Denison University has
established a global studies program, and Mount
Holyoke College hits added a Third World re
quirement.
At the University of lowa, two history profes
sors have created an alternative to the Western
civilization core — a year-long course titled
"Encounter with and Incorporation of the non-
European World." The course, a study of how
European culture has encountered the rest of the
world, "turns Western civilization inside out,' ac
cording to Linda Kerber, professor of history at
lowa.
The University of Minnesota recently added a
two-course cultural pluralism requirement "to
satisfy an internationalizing trend," according to
Fred Lukermann, dean of Minnesota's College of
Liberal Arts. The university also has set out to in
crease the number of cross-disciplinary and com
parative culture courses it offers.
At Brown University, a recent report on
minority life and education recommended that
the school rework existing courses and create
new courses with Third World and ethnic-related
emphases, and consider adding a Third World or
ethnic studies requirement.
Earlier this month, Stanford's Faculty Senate
adopted a spring quarter course that emphasizes
the contributions of women and minorities to
Western culture. The course, developed by Assoc.

History Prof. Clay Carson, will fulfill the
University's third-quarter Western Culture re
quirement.
Education specialists cite a key difference be
tween the current push to increase representa
tion of minority cultures in college curricula and
the similar push of the 19605. Twenty years ago,
minorities were fighting for their own depart
ments at colleges, signifying that their interests
were not yet generally recognized as worthy of
study. Today, the chief drive is to integrate
minorities' academic interests — which now have
credibility but still are "ghettoized" at many col
leges — into traditional courses.
There appears to be great support for this form
of integration. "Minority concerns can't just be
separated off into little enclaves," noted Michael
Whalon, vice provost at the University of Tulsa,
At Stanford, many who favor revamping the
entire Western Culture system argue that
minority concerns should be integrated into all
Western Culture classes rather than "ghettoized"
into a new, minority track. They view the Carson
course as an acceptable solution for this year but
not for the long term.
Educators around the nation say the current
trend toward incorporating minorities' interests
into core courses is in part a result of the back
grounds of the newest generation of professors.
"The '60s, the Peace Corps, worrying about Viet
nam ... put an imprint on faculty that is bound to
change the direction of education," said Harmon
Dunathan, dean of the faculty at Hampshire Col
lege.
If U.S. colleges and universities are globalizing
their outlook, though, there is also a significant
trend back to the traditional Western civilization
core, as espoused by Education Secretary William
Bennett.
Educators say the movement back to the core is
not necessarily at odds with the trend toward
globalization.
"I think Bennett overstates it when he says you
can't do both," said Whalon, adding that Tulsa is
moving toward a greater international emphasis
in its curriculum and also will probably adopt a
Western civilization core in the next
few years.
"What has been happening is that
different institutions in different ways
are finding their way back to the core,
but there is no general agreement any
more on what a core should be," said
Dunathan.
Noralee Frankel, special assistant on
women and minorities at the American
Historical Association, said the trend
toward internationalization and the
countertrend back toward the tradi
tional core often create a positive syn
thesis, a "more comparative Western
history, which can be a very exciting
approach."
"There is a need to reaffirm the
values of Western culture ... but in
broader terms," said Richard Ekman,
director of research at the National En
dowment for the Humanities.
Ekman warns, though, that if current
trends toward integration continue,
"there is a danger that people will lose
sense of the relative importance of
cultures. Not all cultures are equal
educationally for Americans."
