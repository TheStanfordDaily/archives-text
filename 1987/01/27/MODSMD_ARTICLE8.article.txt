# Gyn-Ob training altered

### 
Stanford University School of Medicine will reorganize its
training program in gynecology and obstetrics and will
move its Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (SCVMC)-based
portion of the program to Stanford University Hospital.
The move, effective July 1, was announced yesterday by-
Vice President and Dean David Korn. "The change,' he said,
"was dictated by educational considerations."
Seven resident physicians and three medical students
who normally rotate through the county hospital during
their training will be affected.
The dean said no other Stanford program changes at
SCVMC are contemplated. The medical school maintains
portions of its teaching programs in medicine, surgery,
pediatrics and other medical specialties at SCVMC. They are
staffed by Stanford faculty who supervise the training and
clinical care.
"We are committed to these programs and are interested
in finding ways of strengthening our affiliation with
SCVMC," Korn said.
Stanford officials communicated their decision to reor
ganize the Gyn-Ob program to SCVMC Administrator Robert
Sillen last November.
We affirmed our commitment to work closely with Mr.
Sillen s staff to plan for a smooth transition and avoid any
negative effects on the county hospital's patient care obliga.
tions," Korn said.
Prof. Kent Ueland, chairman of the Department of Gyne
cology and Obstetrics, said Stanford needs to convert its
Gvn-Ob residency from a three to a four-year program be
cause "we are currently the onlv universitv-associated three

year program in the country."
Restructuring, he said, will enhance the highest quality of
education and make the program more competitive in at
tracting the best applicants.
Additionally, the relocation of the program at Stanford
will address flaws in the present educational process, he
said. The county hospital, for example, offers inadequate
training experiences in major benign gynecologic surgery.
Stanford Gvn-Ob residents and medical students will do
rotations at Kaiser Permanente Hospital at Santa Clara that
maintains its own gynecology and obstetrics training pro
gram. "The Stanford and Kaiser programs will exchange res
idents to take advantage of the various educational strengths
available at the two institutions," said Dr. Bruce Johnson,
chief of obstetrics and gynecology and director of the
residency program at Kaiser. Johnson is also a clinical asso
ciate professor of Gyn-Ob at Stanford.
The medical school is also affiliated with the department
of medicine at the Kaiser hospital where Stanford resident
physicians and medical students rotate during their training.
Exposure of trainees to different types of medical practices
is essential in the education of physicians,
Ueland said the conversion to a four-year program will be
phased in over three years to allow the present group of
trainees to complete their training. The four-year program
will allow participation in the National Residency Matching
Program and "should greatly increase the number and
quality of applicants to our program," he said. In the new
program, plans call for reducing the number of Gyn-Ob res
idents from the present 18 to 12
