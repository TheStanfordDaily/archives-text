Beirut kidnappings continue
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Gunmen kidnapped two men believed to be for
eigners from a store in Moslem west Beirut, dragged them by their hair to a
getaway car and sped off. A store employee said the vicitms spoke broken
English and might be Poles.
Most universities and high schools in the Lebanese capital staged a one
day strike to protest the abduction of three Americans and one Indian from
Beirut University Colege on Saturday by gunmen disguised as police.
Saturday's abductions rasied to 23 the number of foreigners missing
after being kidnapped in Lebanon, including eight seized since Anglican
Church envoy Terry Waite arrived in Beirut on Jan. 12 to seek the release of
hostages.
Waite remained out of sight for a seventh straight day yesterday, the
longest he has been underground in five trips to Lebanon. He was thought
to be negotiating with the group that has held two American hostages since
1985.
Waite is a special envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie,
and a spokesman for Runcie in London told Press Association: "We are
aware of the report that Terry Waite has been detained, and we are seeking
clarification as a matter of urgency." Press Association is Britain's domestic
news agency.
It said the report of Waite's possible detention by the kidnappers appar
ently originated with the Kuwait News Agency. There was no confirmation
of the report.
The Reagan administration, in a statement read by White House spokes
man Larry Speakes in Washington, condemned the latest wave of kidnap
pings as a declaration of war against civilization, but told Americans to get
out of Lebanon, warning "there's a limit to what our government can do"
for them.
Shuttle's new joint stronger
OGDEN, Utah — A redesigned joint for the space shuttle's solid rocket
boosters is twice as strong as its predecessor and should be ready before
shuttle flights resume in 1988, Morton Thiokol officials said yesterday.
"I have a great degree of confidence in the design. I would fly it,'' Allan
McDonald, director of Morton Thiokol's booster redesign team told
reporters.
The Challenger exploded shortly after launch Jan. 28, 1986, killing all
seven crew members. A presidential commission determined an O-ring
joint in one of the shuttle's two solid boosters had failed, allowing hot
rocket gases to escape and sparking the explosion of the craft's exterior
fuel tank.
Since then, the company has conducted hundreds of tests, including
three successful test-firings this past fall of the refurbished joints.
"Although we are keenly aware of the tragic incident of one year ago,
our focus is and shall remain on the future," said U. Edwin Garrison, presi
dent of Morton Thiokol's Aerospace Group.
The new design would make five major changes in the previous model,
McDonald said.
Those include a new "capture feature" seal containing a third O-ring,
which forces the joints more tightly together during pressurization; new O
ring materials; refurbished primary and secondary O-rings; and an ad
hesive bond joint known as aj-seal.
Japanese unemployment 'grim'
TOKYO—Japan's unemployment situation has become "grim" and the
government proposes a program designed to create 300,000 jobs, Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told Parliament yesterday.
He also told the lawmakers, reassembled after a month-long New Year
recess, that the U.S. budget deficit, imbalances in the accounts of major
countries and protectionist moves have caused many problems for the
world economy.
Nakasone said Japan will try to make sure currency exchange markets
are stable, accurately reflecting economic fundamentals.
About jobs, he said: "We are taking special steps to cope with the grim
situation in employment recently.
"The administration and ruling party are joined together as one ... to ex
plore ways to expand employment opportunities and to stabilize employ
ment, and we will implement the Program for Creating 300,000 Jobs as an
emergency measure a budget of approximately 100 billion yen ($650 mil
lion) in response to industrial restructuring and other factors."
Unemployment averaged a record 2.8 percent for the first 11 months of
1986, up from 2.67 percent in 1985 and the previous record of 2.7 in 1984.
The U.S. unemployment rate hovers around 7 percent.
U.S. owes U.N. promised funding
UNITED NATIONS — A U.S. official and a United Nations observer ex
pressed concern yesterday that the Reagan administration has not fulfilled
its promise to restore full U.S. funding to the U.N. budget.
After the United Nations last month approved U.S.-sought austerity
measures and changes in its budgetary process, President Reagan and U.S.
Ambassador Vernon Walters pledged to seek full U.S. payment of its dues.
But the Reagan administration's budget proposals do not include
enough money to pay its U.N. bill, which is 25 percent of the world body's
annual budget.
"It's a sad situation. Where is the goodwill on the American part?" asked
Edward Luck, president of the United Nations Association, an independent
research group.
The U.S. source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United
States is in an embarrassing situation. But he noted some officials in Wash
ington are pressing for more U.N. reforms before providing the money.
Many other U.N. members paid their U.N. dues early this year to help al
leviate what Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has called the or
ganization's worst financial crisis.
The United States is the United Nations' largest donor. To pay its full
quota, the United States would have to restore $110 million it cut from the
$210 million U.N. assessment for the current fiscal year and provide $213
million for the next fiscal year.
The appropriations have to be approved by Congress, and the Reagan
administration has not asked the legislators to provide the full U.N. contri
bution in either the supplemental spending bills for the current fiscal year
or the regular budget for the next fiscal year.
Pole will not meet with Koch
WARSAW, Poland — Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski probably will not
meet with Edward Koch despite the visiting New York mayor's request,
government spokesman Jerzy Urban said yesterday.
Koch repeated yesterday that a meeting with Jaruzelski was a key ob
jective in what he has called a five-day working vacation to Poland.
"I think it's helpful to Poland to have as many people who can reach
American audiences to see the president of Poland, who is a man of great
interest to Americans," Koch said. Jaruzelski's official title is not president
but chairman of the Council of State. He also heads the governing Commu
nist Party
Urban said in a telephone interview that a Koch Jaruzelski meeting "is
not expected."
He would not elaborate on the reasons for Jaruzelski's decision, but
Koch called the general a dictator when Jaruzelski visited U.N.
headquarters in New York in 1985
Another reason could be Koch's planned meeting today in the port city
of Gdansk with Lech Walesa, founder of the Solidarity trade union, which
now is outlawed.
Government authorities normally refuse to see visiting Western officials
who also meet with members of the political opposition.
John Whitehead, U.S. deputy secretary of state, is scheduled to arrive to
morrow for talks with Jaruzelski. It will be the highest-level visit by a U.S.
official since Jaruzelski declared martial law in December 1981 and
suppressed Solidarity, the only free trade union in the Soviet bloc.
