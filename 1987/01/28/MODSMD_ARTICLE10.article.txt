# Aquino's troops crush revolt
## 
### 
MANILA, Philippines — About 200 rebellious mili
tary officers and men clustered in a television station
compound are refusing to surrender here after
troops loyal to President Corazon Aquino crushed si
multaneous military uprisings at two air force bases,
the government television station and the military's
own headquarters.
Aquino, in a brief television appearance yesterday,
said, "The situation is well in hand," and promised
tough retaliation against the plotters. "I have ordered
their arrest and detention," she said. "There is a time
for reconciliation and a time for justice and retribu
tion. That time has come."
The military uprising, while never coming close to
toppling Aquino, marked the gravest threat yet to her
government, which has already survived three other
coup attempts and an assortment of plots and
schemes to destabilize her.
The uprisings were apparently led by troops loyal
to ousted president Ferdinand Marcos amid persis
tent rumors that he is about to return here. The at
tacks underscored the sharp, unresolved divisions
lingering within the armed forces between soldiers
still loyal to Marcos and soldiers who support the
Aquino government and also highlighted the involve
ment of middle-level officers as well as enlisted men
in the efforts to destabilize Aquino's government.

At the Channel 7 television station in suburban
Quezon City, negotiations between government rep
resentatives and rebels went on through most of last
night and into the early morning hours. At about 10
p.m., the rebels released about 37 station employes
who had been inside the building when the siege
erupted.
At 3 a.m. this morning, Armed Forces Chief of Staff
Fidel Ramos met with rebel leader Col. Oscar Canlas
in a van outside the station. The conversation was
picked up by a radio station microphone that broad
cast it live. Canlas was heard saying, "We are willing
to pay the price of our behavior." Ramos, who spoke
sternly, told the rebels to leave the station and
guaranteed them "fair and honorable treatment." But
he warned that "you're going to account for your ac
tions."
Canlas has denied that his aim was to reinstall
Marcos, saying it was meant to make a dramatic state
ment warning of the growing influence of commun
ism.
Canlas, an Air Force intelligence officer from the
southern Luzon region, also denied that the well
orchestrated attacks that began early yesterday were
designed to topple Aquino.
Canlas told Ramos that the rebels were still under
Ramos' command. Ramos replied, "If that is so, then
follow orders."

At about 8:30 a.m., the rebels, fearful of a govern
ment attack, allowed about 20 reporters and photog
raphers inside the complex as protection.
At least 400 soldiers were involved in the attacks,
in which one rebel was killed and at least 40
wounded. Ramos said another 111 soldiers tried to
join the mutiny by moving into Manila from a north
ern province but were intercepted on the expres
sway in the early morning hours. He said the rebels
were waiting for reinforcements to arrive from the
northern provinces still loyal to Marcos, but the mili
tary put up nine roadblocks "to preclude the move
ment of any forces" by the rebels or their supporters.
It was unclear whether the military uprising began
as an effort to bring Marcos back, or whether soldiers
disaffected with the government's perceived leftist
drift linked up with the forces loyal to Marcos in a
marriage of convenience.
In Honolulu, Marcos brushed aside allegations that
he was behind the uprising. During the height of the
attacks, he disappeared from his house for about 12
hours to make telephone calls because he feels his
own telephone is being monitored, aide Arturo
Aruiza said. Marcos later said he had been meeting
with his lawyers.

It was unclear whether the military uprising began
as an effort to bring Marcos back, or whether soldiers
disaffected with the government's perceived leftist
drift linked up with the forces loyal to Marcos in a
marriage of convenience.
In Honolulu, Marcos brushed aside allegations that
he was behind the uprising. During the height of the
attacks, he disappeared from his house for about 12
hours to make telephone calls because he feels his
own telephone is being monitored, aide Arturo
Aruiza said. Marcos later said he had been meeting
with his lawyers.
