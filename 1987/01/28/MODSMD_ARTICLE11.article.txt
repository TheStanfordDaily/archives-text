# Navy moves carriers into Gulf
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The United States
is sending five naval vessels northward
in the Persian Gulf and moving two
aircraft carrier task forces closer to that
strategic region to reassure friendly
Arab states of U.S. support following
Iranian military advances against Iraq,
administration officials said yesterday.
The U.S. naval movements and ac
companying political steps, which Sec
retary of State George Shultz referred
to in testimony before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, were
described by some officials as an im
plicit warning to Iran against striking at
Arab nations across the Persian Gulf.
The Navy is moving its Middle Eas
tern task force of guided-missile
destroyers and frigates into the north
ern Persian Gulf "closer to Kuwait,"
where 21 heads of state from the Is
lamic world are meeting in a confer
ence that has been threatened by pro-
Iranian groups, sources said.
The Navy also plans to "expedite"
the movement of the USS Kitty Hawk
and its escorts into the northern
Arabian Sea from the area around the
Philippines where the big carrier is
now, the sources added. Furthermore,
the carrier USS Nimitz has been
rerouted further to the east in the
Mediterranean Sea than originally

scheduled, and the Pentagon an
nounced that the carrier USS Kennedy
and its 12-ship task force will remain
indefinitely in the Mediterranean
rather than return to Norfolk next
month as planned.
"We have repeatedly warned Iran
that any extension of the (Iran-Iraq)
conflict would be regarded as a major
threat to U.S. interests," Shultz
declared. He read a White House state
ment issued last Friday that said the
United States remains "strongly com
mitted to supporting the individual
and collective self-defense of our
friends in the (Persian) Gulf with
whom we have deep and longstanding
ties." The statement also was delivered
by U.S. ambassadors to nations in the
region.
The warnings to Iran come only
three months after the United States
was secretly shipping arms to it as part
of a White House effort to free U.S.
hostages held in Lebanon. The secret
policy, when revealed in November,
stunned U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf
and shook their confidence in Ameri
can security guarantees.
Shultz, testifying on the recent coun
termanding of this secret policy, said
he could make no categorical state
ment about the military impact of the

2,000 TOW antitank missiles and other
U.S. arms supplied to Iran. But he said
it is "just nutty" to say that shipments of
this relatively small magnitude could
be responsible for a major turn in the
Persian Gulf war.
Shultz declared twice in his
prepared statement and repeated
several times during questioning by
senators that U.S. arms sales to Iran,
which he called "a limited exception"
to U.S. policies of shutting off the arms
flow to Tehran, have been stopped and
will not be resumed.
The news of U.S. arms sales to Iran
"was a shock" to Iraq and "has put
some strain into our relationship,"
Shultz testified. To repair the damage,
according to Arab sources in Washing
ton, the United States has stepped up
its supply of intelligence information
to Iraq on the war since Iran launched
its latest offensive Jan. 9. The sources
said the increase in intelligence data is
coming from U.S. satellites and from
the U.S. airborne warning and control
system (AWAC) planes based in Saudi
Arabia.
King Hussein of Jordan, an influen
tial Arab leader, "perhaps understand
ably feels hurt" because of the U.S. sale
to Iran of some of the same weapons

that were denied to him as a U.S. ally,
Shultz testified. But he described Hus
sein as "a sensible and experienced
person," and said the United States will
still be able to work with him.
Saudi Arabia, which was also re
ported to have been shocked by the
revelations of secret U.S. sales, ap
peared to be distancing itself from the
United States. A "signal" of Saudi dis
pleasure was the unusual dispatch of
the new Saudi oil minister, Hisham
Nazir, to Moscow for discussions ear
lier this month. Nazir's trip was an
nounced at the end of a day when King
Fahd and several other senior Saudis
saw visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Richard Murphy, but declined to
tell Murphy of the pending trip or the
announcement, according to
diplomatic sources.
The current movements of U.S. ships
were described by an official as "more
psychological than operational — a
show of force."
Another official described them as
"a demonstration of concern" about
developments in the Iran-Iraq war.
"This is intended as a way to reassure
friends of our interest and support....
It is not there for any hostile intent,"
the official said of the U.S. fleet.
