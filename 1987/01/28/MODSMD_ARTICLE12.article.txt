poon humor magazine.
I lie senate also discussed plans tor renovating
tht ASM student office spaces and holding a
forum on students roles in University decision
making. It also passed a resolution supporting the
goals of the Student Athletic Committee (SAC).
According to Josh Weinstein, editor in chief of
the Chaparral, the joint issue will be an opportu
nity to show Harvard that Stanford people are
funnier."
Both magazines have a distinctive brand of
humor, Weinstein added. While the Harvard Lam
poon concentrates on longer pieces, Chaparral
goes for more outright jokes, he said.
Weinstein saicl that 1 diversity President Donald
Kennedy and Harvard President Derek Bok both
will write articles for the joint issue. Kennedy is a
I larvard graduate while Bok attended Stanford.
Other projected articles include a tour of Stan
lord by Harvard students and a fake Harvard
course guide, Weinstein said.
I le also expressed a hope that the joint venture
will lead to a rev ival of college humor magazines.
There are onh five such magazines left across the
c< )untry, he said.
There were some critics of the Chaparral's
lunding request. According to Council of Presi
dents member Mary Thurber, the Chaparral gets
I H more money than any other Stanford publica
tion even though it lias trouble selling its issues.
In other news, Senator Leonard Adler an
nounced a forum called "Student Influence in
University Decision Making, " which will take

According to Adler, "The purpose behind the
ASSI' staging this forum is twofold First, we wish
to educate the students by raising their awareness
as to what issues are affecting them and by dis
playing a variety of methods available for impact
ing University policy."
Second, the forum will "get students inter
ested enough so that they will participate in the
decision-making process".

dergone only piecemeal changes in the 25 years
of its existence.
University architects have conservatively esti
mated the price of the renovations at $80,000 to
$100,000, White said.
According to White: "ASSI' profits from its busi
ness projects, and its investments would pay for
the changes."
White stressed the fact that these funds are
