# Sand Hill Road extension
## Stanford seeks new funding plan 
### 
Stanford and Palo Alto city staff mem
bers are considering creation of an assess
ment district to pay for construction ot a
Sand Hill Road extension to El Camino
Real, acting University President James
Rosse told the City Council Monday.
Rosse called the extension "badly
needed and long overdue Its cost, in
cluding mitigations, has risen from $2.1
million to $(> million.
The district would include the same par
cels as those listed in .t 19~'6-~'" T proposal.
"Stanford is offering to provide the land
for the road at no cost," Rosse said. "The
time h;is come for all jurisdictions in
volved to sit down to discuss a solution to
;i vexing, long-standing problem that wor
sens every year."
A 1984 survey showed 6h percent of
those living in Palo Alto and Menlo Park

favored the extension, with only 1-4 per
cent opposed.
"If the complaints about the road we re
hearing today are any measure, the num
ber in favor of the extension is probably
even greater," he said.
Also discussed at the meeting were
plans regarding the projected Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library.
An estimated 3,500 persons have signed
petitions asking that another site be cho
sen for the library. The Santa Clara County
Planning Commission may decide tom
morrow whether to review its 4-2 decision
that the proposed building conforms with
the present low-intensity zoning for the
site, which adjoins Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
Rosse defended the library as "a
valuable academic resource" and said the
site was chosen "precisely because ot the

academic importance of the library, so it
would be available to students and
scholars.
He said the University is "as concerned
as anyone" about non-academic visitors to
the library, and "anxious to limit them.
Although the site is being challenged, "it
is our hope that the University w ill be able
to use property that it has held tor educa
tional purposes tor 100 years," Rosse said.
"There seems to be a general misper
ception that the Stanford foothills are per
manent open space," he said. They are .1
"resource that must be preserved ... for
our successors at Stanford if needed for
educational purposes.
"We don't anticipate at the present time
any (further) need to develop' these
lands, he added. "But we want to be sure
our successors can keep Stanford the kind
of institution we can all be proud of."
