While Humphrey Bogart never really uttered the
words "play it again, Sam," fellow actor Ronald Reagan
made up for that oversight last night when he replayed
the same old, tired policies of the "Reagan revolution" in
his State of the Union address.
The president had been backed into a corner by both
physical and political problems and was faced with a
choice of either working with a Democratic-controlled
Congress or sticking to his guns like the old movie
fighter he is.
While Congress seemed to be making conciliatory
overtures with cascades of applause, Reagan showed that
he is refusing to drop the items in his agenda that he
found difficult to sell even when the Republicans con
trolled the Senate.
Reagan emphasized school prayer, an old favorite, be
cause "our nation could not have been conceived with
out divine help."
Another of Reagan's standbys, Central America, is not
so easily dismissed. America's involvement in that
troubled region has long been compared to the early
days of intervention in Vietnam, and Reagan raised
frightening memories of the domino theory when he
said, "There will be no Soviet beachhead in Central
America."
The chances of Reagan pushing aid for the contras

through Congress are about as slim as school prayer
being approved, but these policies along with other
hard-to-sell items, like the Strategic Defense Initiative
and balanced budget amendment for the Constitution,
were once again emphasized.
In pushing tax reform, a stronger defense and more
aggressive foreign policy, Reagan has seen many of his
goals met, and last night the nation waited for a new di
rection to work toward and new cause for optimism.
Instead it received reiteration and a child's version of
the Constitution, for the little folks in the audience.
A plan for better care for the elderly, while admirable,
was old news, as was the line-item veto, which also may
prove to have some merit.
In the best tradition of dramatic irony on the stage,
Reagan talked about the importance of "We the people"
in the Constitution while cavalierly dismissing the
Iranian arms fiasco, of which not even the people in his
own administration, including himself, were fully aware.
He spoke of the noble ends of his actions, and, while the
audience waited with bated breath for him to say that
perhaps the means to those ends had been flawed, he
blithely continued.
Yes, the Great Communicator is alive and well, but
now the message remains the same and even more
empty than before.
