Bikers should
keep handrails
free for walkers
In walking about the campus I
observe that many bicyclists lock their
parked bikes to railings. This is cer
tainly unobjectionable unless the
railing happens to be on or next to a
stairway. I am sure that the walkers
who must use handrailings for sup
port in going up or down steps would
greatly appreciate the thoughtfulness
and consideration of riders who avoid
blocking such handrailings with their

bikes. So here is a "thank you" to
those riders.

Taking down
gay events flyers
is discrimination
I hesitate to use the word
"homophobic" because it is so vastly
overused and has lost its true
meaning. It means discrimination and
hatred, and I have come up against an
example of it again.

When the Semester-in-Spain people
or the Army put up flyers, they stay for
months; old party flyers long outlast
their usefulness. A flyer for a gay event
lasts an average of four to five hours.
Literally. I don't take down flyers for
frat parties, and I expect people not to
take down flyers for Lesbian and
Bisexual Women's Happy Hours just
because they don't plan to attend.
Despite the Stanford community's
attempts at open-mindedness, there is
clearly a great deal of heterosexism
and hatred on this campus. I would
like to say that it's only fear and misin
formation, but we really ought to be
realistic about this open infringement
of students' rights to free information.
