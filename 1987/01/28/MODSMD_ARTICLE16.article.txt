# Arts house has great potential
## 
### 
I am writing to applaud Erica Olsen's recent letter sup
porting an arts theme house (Daily, Jan. 21).
The case for an arts theme house seems to me as strong as
for any of the existing ones. Creators and critics in the
various arts have traditionally come together in urban
centers, and profited from their close social as well as pro
fessional associations: Berlin and Vienna, the Left Bank,
Greenwich Village and North Beach of the not-too-distant
past. This could happen in a setting even more rural than
Stanford's: Black Mountain College. It is natural for painters
and actors and writers and film makers to eat and argue and
play together, and even those who are not themselves
creators or critics profit from the sometimes heated atmos
phere.

There have been efforts at Stanford to overcome the only
too obvious separation of students in the various arts. In the
1960s Freshman English, with supplementary funds pro
vided by the administration, made an effort to bring the arts
into the residences. A multi-media freshman arts show at
Roble brought more than 100 freshman creators out of
hiding, and for a brief time Michael Stillman, a Branner RA,
turned the dorm into a kind of arts theme house, where
productions, readings and receptions regularly occurred. A

course given by English Prof. Larry Friedlander, holding
some classes (which at times were also parties) in one of the
fraternities, similarly brought students in different arts into
close association.
I believe Erica Olsen is right in saying that an "arts theme
house would have no trouble drawing fascinating
speakers." A weeklong 1973 conference on "The Creative
Process in Literature and the Arts," sponsored by Modern
Thought and Literature, had more than 100 active partici
pants, a number of them students, and brought to Stanford
painters Paul Brach and Miriam Shapiro; writers Ntozake
Shange, John Hawkes and Michel Butor (novelist, poet, film
maker, philosopher, critic of literature and painting and
music), Leonard Michaels, Alurista, Susan Griffin; aes
thetician and film critic Stanley Cavell; dancer Norma Leis
tiko. Stanford itself offered John Chowning and Martin Bres
nick (music); John L'Heureux, Scott Mamaday, Clive Miller
(writers); Charles Lyons (drama); Keith Boyle (painting);
Marilyn and Irvin Yalom (psychology of the creative
process) among many others. Two undergraduate papers
(Susan Witt and Kathleen O'Neill) were later published in
an issue of the Canadian journal "Mosaic" devoted to the
conference.
I think it entirely possible that an arts theme house,
though attempting nothing so ambitious as a weeklong con
ference, would become a continuing center for more than
its regular residents.
