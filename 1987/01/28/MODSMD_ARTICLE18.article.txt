# A
						theme house nightmare
## 
### 
I think it happened Friday morning, after an all-nighter I
pulled to finish up a Comp Sci program. I was at my desk at
Terra House, reading the opinions page of Friday's Daily,
when I just totally fell asleep. My guess is that my face hit
"The Farm Side" ... the one with the pottery house and the
basket-weaving house and â€”
"About time you woke up, Chris," a voice pompously an
nounced.

"Huh? Where am I?"
"You're in the fourth paragraph of the obligatory dream
sequence column, although the last three have been
dialogue."
"Dream-sequence column? But that's so, so ... cheesyl I
... I couldn't do something like that."
"Of course you could. Don't flatter yourself. And do you
remember your Western Culture reading from freshman
year?"
"We 11... yeah. As well as anyone else, I mean."
"That bad, huh? Well, assuming you remember Dante,
you can just call me Virgil, and I'm taking you on a little
trip."
"Where to? Hell?' 1,
"Worse. Much worse. We're going to Stanford theme
house-o-rama, 1997. Oh, and watch your step; don't trip
over the Invisible Girl."
"This is only going to get sillier, isn't it?" I asked.
Our first stop was the Row. Freshly painted signs adorned
most of the houses, with names like "C.S. House," "Balto
slavic house" and"Plaid house."
"Plaid?" I asked, "A plaid theme house?"
"Better here than all over the place, right?"
"But, Virg, that's segregation, isn't it? Doesn't that separate
all the plaid-lovers from the people who dress normally?
What good does that do?"
"No one put them there, Chris. They went through all the
proper channels to get that house. I figure anyone who's
willing to push that much paper deserves a place of their
own."
"But who does it help? I guess I just don't get the point."
"Well, do you remember the letter in the paper that
pointed out that a theme house is one which makes mem
bers of other groups feel uncomfortable? How would you
feel if everyone dressed in bright colors and you dressed
really badly?"
He paused. "Oh, I see you do. OK, imagine getting a
bunch of friends who have tastes as bad as yours together
and telling Res Ed: 'Hey, we want to be sheltered!' They'd
take it from there and in no time at all, you'd be comforta
ble."
I thought about this as we walked toward the Cowell
Cluster, which (when combined with the eight Wilbur
houses) represented all the signs of the zodiac.
"Great," I said, "having theme houses helps members of
certain groups feel more comfortable because they're in a

familiar environment. But why does it have to be in a house?
Why can't extracurricular groups and programs fill the
needs of, say, all the Capricorns on campus?"
"Oh, c'mon, Chris. Do you really think the existence of an
Afro-American studies major removes the need for Ujamaa?'
"No, of course not. The Stanford black community has a
legitimate need for that theme house."
"And just because there's a degree available in German,
that doesn't mean you shouldn't have Haus Mitt, right?"
"Enough people speak German and are interested in the
culture to merit that, I suppose. Heck, it's probably good
language training for going overseas."
"Right. So if there's a Food Research major, that doesn't
mean there shouldn't be a Food Research theme house,
right?"
"But... but..
"Food would be good for once, wouldn't it?"
"Umm ... well..
"And what about neurobiology? Republicans? Statistics?
Chaparral writers? Windsurfers? They all need proper ac
comodation!"
I put my foot down right in front of Pisces house. "And
what happens to those who can't be shuffled into some nar
rowly defined stereotype? You know, 'individuals'? People
with more than one interest? There's quite a few, you
know."
Virgil looked dismayed at this display of intractability.
"That's exactly the problem we used to have. At the time you
wrote this column, theme houses were actually pretty
diverse, since some of the people who drew into them only
had a minor interest in the house's theme- In some cases,
they weren't even interested in the theme; they had bad
draw numbers. But now that theme houses cover all the
possible interests of the student body, there's no more need
for the draw. Students are assigned to where they're
supposed to be and that's it. And besides, we've got 'Loser
House' for anyone who just can't fit anywhere else."
"And what happens when something else becomes
deserving of a theme house? I haven't seen any non-theme
houses yet, and I've heard the hula hoop craze is due for a
comback."
"Don't worry. There are still a few vacant theme trailers in
Manzanita Park. We can just allocate those to new, smaller
themes as they come along."
"So, Virgil, what's the point of all of this? You've shown
me a ridiculous situation that the campus couldn't possibly
ever bring itself to creating. What am I supposed to do when
1 wake up from this dream sequence? Tell everyone to say
no to the proposed '87 theme houses like Art and Russian-
East European? All I've seen is that they bring about the
threat of less diversity among dormmates and that they pro
vide the same benefits as well-run extracurricular groups.
That's hardly the kind of ammo to take cheap shots with."
"Oh heck no, Chris. You're not going to write a legitimate
piece on the theme house controversy, you're going to
write a one-sixth page extended humor piece. Let the
people who are pushing for new houses connect the dots."
"And if I don't feel like doing that?"
"You could always write another pro-smoking column
