# Animal rights is now a dead issue
## 
### 
A recent letter (Daily, Jan. 6) submitted from New
York by Avi Magidoff, a representative of the
"Human/Animal Liberation Front," castigates six
Stanford professors who are engaged in research
utilizing animals. I am writing as one of that group
not so much because the article — which was inac
curate, slanderous and vindictive — deserves a

JULIAN
DAVIDSON

response; rather, I wish to point out in the present
hurlyburly of "animal rights" activism where the ethi
cal position lies. In my opinion, it lies with the scien
tists and not with the proponents of animal rights.
The first point is that humans hold hegemony over
animals. Would even the most fanatic of anti
vivisectionists submit to handing that hegemony over
to the rats, mosquitoes or even gorillas? Second, to

stop animal research, which is the goal of these
people, no matter what their propaganda says, is to
immensely hamper if not stop the progress of
medicine and its essential base in biological science.
Let no one imagine that laboratory animals can be
substituted by computers or other such absurdities.
Third, it is the duty of all animal investigators to
minimize discomfort and prevent cruelty in the
course of that research. This goal is now amply en
forced by the implementation of stria legislation and
control of animal labs, including close inspection of
laboratories and procedures by federal and local
agencies.
It follows that the ethical position is to continue to
support animal research, because to prevent it is to
prolong suffering of our fellow humans.
A case in point is the studies of my laboratory on
sexual functions in rats, which were ridiculed and
demeaned by Magidoff. Our objective is understand
ing the role of different parts of the nervous system
in sexual dysfunction, including searching for drugs
that might help to restore function in the vast num
ber of patients suffering from this condition. It would

be deeply unethical to test the effects of new drugs
on human beings when so much can be achieved
from using animal models. We also perform opera
tions on these animals, under anesthesia of course,
which allows us to predict which nerves are impor
tant for sexual function. We have found that certain
drugs can improve various aspects of sexual function
in animals having undergone surgery to separate the
spinal cord from the brain. Such experiments are of
direct relevance to the goal of finding some therapy
for patients with spinal cord damage.
Abuse of animals in research has occurred in the
past. I believe that under the present regulations and
with the improved conditions and increased con
sciousness of animal protection now practiced by re
searchers, this has become, or should become, a
dead issue. The energy of truly idealistic but misled
animal rights advocates should be redirected to com
batting the agonies of war, starvation and all manner
of oppression wreaked by men upon their fellow
humans.
