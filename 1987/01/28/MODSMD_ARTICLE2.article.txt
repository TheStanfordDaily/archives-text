# Profs: Reagan doubts remain
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
Doubts about President Reagan's
leadership ability lingered last night
despite an upbeat State of the Union
address delivered before a joint ses
sion of Congress, according to Univer
sity scholars.
In the address, Reagan stressed na
tional defense, international trade, the
budget deficit and education.
Characteristically buoyant and ap
parently in good health following
recent prostate surgery, the president
delivered a relatively brief message in
what political analysts had predicted
would be one of the most important
speeches of his presidency.
At stake was the nation's confidence
in a president whose leadership has
been widely questioned in the wake of
the recent scandal over secret arms
sales to Iran and the diversion of prof
its to the contras in Nicaragua.
While Reagan did acknowledge early
in his address that "serious mistakes
were made" in the execution of the
Iran arms sale policy, he denied that
the policy itself was wrong. He also
assumed full responsibility for the
policy.
According to Political Science Prof.
John Manley, the president's accep
tance of responsibility for the arms sale
policy will do little to end the current
leadership crisis.
On the contrary, "he (Reagan) might
find that it's added fuel to the fire,"
Manley said.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein
agreed. "Contragate may have gone
too far" for Reagan to put it behind
him by softening his position on the
matter, Bernstein said.
