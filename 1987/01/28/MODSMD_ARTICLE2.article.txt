# Profs: Reagan doubts remain
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
Doubts about President Reagan's
leadership ability lingered last night
despite an upbeat State of the Union
address delivered before a joint ses
sion of Congress, according to Univer
sity scholars.
In the address, Reagan stressed na
tional defense, international trade, the
budget deficit and education.
Characteristically buoyant and ap
parently in good health following
recent prostate surgery, the president
delivered a relatively brief message in
what political analysts had predicted
would be one of the most important
speeches of his presidency.
At stake was the nation's confidence
in a president whose leadership has
been widely questioned in the wake of
the recent scandal over secret arms
sales to Iran and the diversion of prof
its to the contras in Nicaragua.
While Reagan did acknowledge early
in his address that "serious mistakes
were made" in the execution of the
Iran arms sale policy, he denied that
the policy itself was wrong. He also
assumed full responsibility for the
policy.
According to Political Science Prof.
John Manley, the president's accep
tance of responsibility for the arms sale
policy will do little to end the current
leadership crisis.
On the contrary, "he (Reagan) might
find that it's added fuel to the fire,"
Manley said.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein
agreed. "Contragate may have gone
too far" for Reagan to put it behind
him by softening his position on the
matter, Bernstein said.
According to John Bunzel, a senior
research fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, "the Iran affair was the most
costly political disaster of his
presidency. It was stupid, badly calcu
lated and wrong,"
Despite the president's "reservoir of
good will among the American
people," it may be too late for Reagan
to put the Iran issue to rest, Bunzel
said.
Reagan "no longer controls the
agenda in the United States, Bunzel
said, adding, "People have lost confi
dence in his leadership and do not
support many of his policies."
"The president was there to show
that he was vigorous" and in com
mand, said Rodney Kennedy-Minott, a
senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution. The president's perfor
mance was "vintage Reagan," Minott
added.
He acknowledged, however, that the

address was received by "a largely un
believing audience, as far as the Demo
crats (in Congress) were concerned."
The president also discussed na
tional defense, warning of Soviet ex
pansionism, particularly in Central
America.
Invoking the legacy of the Monroe
Doctrine, Reagan made reference to
the ongoing debate over contra aid:
"Some in the Congress may choose to
depart from this historical commit
ment, but I will not
"There must be no Soviet beach
head in Central America,"he added.
Manley discounted these statements,
characterizing them as "scare tactics."
Regarding education, Reagan en
couraged the nation to set "new and
rigorous goals." He also reaffirmed his
long-standing support for prayer in the
schools.
"Let's stop suppressing the spiritual
core of our nation's heritage," he said,
referring to the ban on prayer in U.S.
public schools.
"Let's have it said that the 100 th
Congress was the one that ended the
expulsion of God from America's class

rooms," he added.
Reagan's outspoken comments on
prayer in the schools surprised
Bernstein. "I was surprised by the
vigor of them (the comments) at a time
when he's got other problems,"
Bernstein said.
The president also called the size of
the federal deficit "outrageous" and
urged the passage of a constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced
budget.
"Together we made a commitment
to balance the budget, now let's keep
it," Reagan told the Congress.
Bernstein dismissed the the
balanced budget proposal as
"symbolic," saying enforcement of
such a measure would be impractical.
Reagan also reiterated his support
for the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI), saying, "SDI will go forward."
On international trade, the president
restated his opposition to protec
tionism but emphasized that the
United States expected fair treatment
from its trading partners. The United
States will be "trade partners, not trade
patsies," he said.
