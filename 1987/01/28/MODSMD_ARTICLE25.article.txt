## LOTS of improvement at computer facility 
### 
Once the birthplace of the legendary
"hacker" and the melancholy "Hacker Papers,"
Stanford's student computer network, 10 years
old this quarter, has finally settled down.
The network has become simply part of the
students' routine at Stanford.
The Low Overhead Time-Sharing system
(LOTS), which began with one small over
worked computer winter quarter of 1977, now
has six mainframe computers, several high
powered workstations, 50 personal computers,
7,800 users and a budget of $1.3 million.
Students do homework, send electronic
mail, figure out how to kill the snake in
"Adventure's" cave, debate politics, sell
bicycles, arrange dates, and at least once joined
to write a pornographic novel.
Although almost every user is a student, an
occasional staff member keeps an account on
LOTS, having learned it is much more fun than
using the "grown-ups" machine."
And the service now is fast and almost always
reliable.
"We have almost reached equilibrium in
response to the demands of our users," LOTS

director Ralph Gorin says with obvious satisfac
tion.
That certainly was not always so.
When John McCarthy, Stanford's pioneering
computer scientist, began LOTS 10 years ago
with a Digital Equipment Corp. DEC 2040,
LOTS could handle only about 400 accounts.
Since there were already 2,000 computer ac
counts at Stanford, the 2040 did not appear to
be much help.
Gorin "tinkered" with the machine and got
its capacity up to 1,600, fulfilling the goal of
having LOTS handle more than half the univer
sity's academic users.
But from that moment on LOTS was jammed.
Long response times, lost data and computer
crashes plagued the system. Whenever a new
machine was added, a computer version of
Parkinson's law took effect and the amount of
computing quickly expanded to fill, then clog,
the amount of space and time allotted.
The offices moved, first from Cedar Hall,
then to the School of Education's Center for
Educational Research at Stanford (CERAS)
building, then to a converted bowling alley at

the student union, and finally to its relatively
posh new digs at Sweet Hall.
And while the hardware was growing, so too
was'the mystique. Stories of pasty-faced stu
dents, their eyes reflecting the sickly green
glow of their LOTS terminal screens at 4 a.m.,
created the legend of the student "hacker."
The hackers, always a small minority of users,
would spend most of their waking hours pro
gramming arcane problems into the LOTS com
puters, or playing "wheel wars," trying to
cleverly sabotage the work of other hackers
and, at the same time, defend their own files.
Reporters from national magazines and
newspapers arrived in the wee hours to
chronicle these weird folk, and after the resul
tant publicity universities around the nation
suddenly discovered they had them too.
Stanford psychologist Philip Zimbardo, mon
itoring the network, produced an article for
Psychology Today in 1980 on the LOTS culture
called "The Hacker Papers." A student, Kenneth
Peter (known by the code name G. Gandalf)
had sent out an "Essay on Hacking" to other
hackers on the system, suggesting they were

losing touch with the rest of humanity and invit
ing replies.
The response was a long, sad, introspective
dialogue on the network about what might hap
pen to students who spent too much of their
energies in the labyrinth of LOTS.
Much of the hacking culture is gone, moving
on to other computers set up by various Stan
ford departments, but there still is almost al
ways someone on LOTS, and an occasional
wheel war will break out.
The equipment is hardly minor league. LOTS
now includes three DEC System 20s, named Ot
hello, Lear and Hamlet; one Systems Concept
Corp. computer named Macbeth; a DEC VAX
named Portia; and an IBM 4381, unaccountably
named Watson. (It is not clear which Watson,
IBM's or Conan Doyle's.)
The machines have filled the physical space
allotted in the basement of CERAS, completely
taking over an unused audio-visual studio.
The students are usually on the three DEC
20s. Macbeth, which is generally assigned for
heavy number-crunching, now is just coming
online.

Each student has an account on one of the
machines, but as they all share the same
memory storage area, the users can technically
sign on to any of the three. In case their com
puter fails, they can reconnect with any data
stored in the system, although they will lose
anything not already saved.
Watson generally is used by the social sci
ence departments, including economics,
sociology, communication, political science
and, oddly, the law school. Portia, which uses
the operating system called UNIX, is reserved
for computer science and engineering.
Students can access the computers from
clusters of terminals or personal computers
spread around the campus. Additionally, they
can telephone in from their homes or dormi
tories.
Programs in the system range from the very
simple, such as beginner's programming lan
guages or conventional word processing, to
mind-bendingly complex programs for serious
experts.

"We have almost reached equilibrium in
response to the demands of our users," LOTS

director Ralph Gorin says with obvious satisfac
tion.
That certainly was not always so.
When John McCarthy, Stanford's pioneering
computer scientist, began LOTS 10 years ago
with a Digital Equipment Corp. DEC 2040,
LOTS could handle only about 400 accounts.
Since there were already 2,000 computer ac
counts at Stanford, the 2040 did not appear to
be much help.
Gorin "tinkered" with the machine and got
its capacity up to 1,600, fulfilling the goal of
having LOTS handle more than half the univer
sity's academic users.
But from that moment on LOTS was jammed.
Long response times, lost data and computer
crashes plagued the system. Whenever a new
machine was added, a computer version of
Parkinson's law took effect and the amount of
computing quickly expanded to fill, then clog,
the amount of space and time allotted.
The offices moved, first from Cedar Hall,
then to the School of Education's Center for
Educational Research at Stanford (CERAS)
building, then to a converted bowling alley at

the student union, and finally to its relatively
posh new digs at Sweet Hall.
And while the hardware was growing, so too
was'the mystique. Stories of pasty-faced stu
dents, their eyes reflecting the sickly green
glow of their LOTS terminal screens at 4 a.m.,
created the legend of the student "hacker."
The hackers, always a small minority of users,
would spend most of their waking hours pro
gramming arcane problems into the LOTS com
puters, or playing "wheel wars," trying to
cleverly sabotage the work of other hackers
and, at the same time, defend their own files.
Reporters from national magazines and
newspapers arrived in the wee hours to
chronicle these weird folk, and after the resul
tant publicity universities around the nation
suddenly discovered they had them too.
Stanford psychologist Philip Zimbardo, mon
itoring the network, produced an article for
Psychology Today in 1980 on the LOTS culture
called "The Hacker Papers." A student, Kenneth
Peter (known by the code name G. Gandalf)
had sent out an "Essay on Hacking" to other
hackers on the system, suggesting they were

losing touch with the rest of humanity and invit
ing replies.
The response was a long, sad, introspective
dialogue on the network about what might hap
pen to students who spent too much of their
energies in the labyrinth of LOTS.
Much of the hacking culture is gone, moving
on to other computers set up by various Stan
ford departments, but there still is almost al
ways someone on LOTS, and an occasional
wheel war will break out.
The equipment is hardly minor league. LOTS
now includes three DEC System 20s, named Ot
hello, Lear and Hamlet; one Systems Concept
Corp. computer named Macbeth; a DEC VAX
named Portia; and an IBM 4381, unaccountably
named Watson. (It is not clear which Watson,
IBM's or Conan Doyle's.)
The machines have filled the physical space
allotted in the basement of CERAS, completely
taking over an unused audio-visual studio.
The students are usually on the three DEC
20s. Macbeth, which is generally assigned for
heavy number-crunching, now is just coming
online.

Each student has an account on one of the
machines, but as they all share the same
memory storage area, the users can technically
sign on to any of the three. In case their com
puter fails, they can reconnect with any data
stored in the system, although they will lose
anything not already saved.
Watson generally is used by the social sci
ence departments, including economics,
sociology, communication, political science
and, oddly, the law school. Portia, which uses
the operating system called UNIX, is reserved
for computer science and engineering.
Students can access the computers from
clusters of terminals or personal computers
spread around the campus. Additionally, they
can telephone in from their homes or dormi
tories.
Programs in the system range from the very
simple, such as beginner's programming lan
guages or conventional word processing, to
mind-bendingly complex programs for serious
experts.

Once the birthplace of the legendary
"hacker" and the melancholy "Hacker Papers,"
Stanford's student computer network, 10 years
old this quarter, has finally settled down.
The network has become simply part of the
students' routine at Stanford.
The Low Overhead Time-Sharing system
(LOTS), which began with one small over
worked computer winter quarter of 1977, now
has six mainframe computers, several high
powered workstations, 50 personal computers,
7,800 users and a budget of $1.3 million.
Students do homework, send electronic
mail, figure out how to kill the snake in
"Adventure's" cave, debate politics, sell
bicycles, arrange dates, and at least once joined
to write a pornographic novel.
Although almost every user is a student, an
occasional staff member keeps an account on
LOTS, having learned it is much more fun than
using the "grown-ups" machine."
And the service now is fast and almost always
reliable.
