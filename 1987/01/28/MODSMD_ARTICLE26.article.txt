Dear Bug Me,
What is the average life expectancy
of a Stanford freshman's relationship
with his or her "hometowti honey"
once the freshman arrives on campus?
What percentage of freshman relation
ships with hometown friends survive
the freshman year?
— Abigail Van Buren
Dear Ahhy,
(1 have always wanted to talk back to
Abby). Why are you always prying into
the affairs of others' Why don't you
MYOB?
My successor to this column,
Kathryn Ver Ploeg, conducted ex
haustive research from which this an
swer was prepared.
In a survey of 114 Stanford upper
classmen who had on-going relation
ships with friends from their pre-
Stanford existence, it seems that the
average relationship lasted 9.48

months. This figure includes those
people who are seniors planning to
marry their "hometown honey."
For you statistics buffs out there, the
median and mode of the survey was
three months. In other words, most
people said that their relationship
lasted for only three months — until
their winter break.
Apparently, Christmas of one's fresh
man year is a turning point for one's
high school relationship. A female sur
veved said that her relationship of
three months lasted that long because
"I wasn't home at Thanksgiving to
break up in person."
"It (my hometown relationship) was
a waste of time. 1 isolated myself for
nothing," a male said.
Many said that once they got to Stan
ford they realized that there was more
than their "hometown honey." 1 like to
think of this as the "How you gonna
keep 'em down on the farm after
they've seen the Farm" syndrome.
"The pickings were good here," a
female respondent said.
Of course, this is just a survey of stu

dents who had "hometown honeys.'
Most students didn't. One of these said
that the hometown "sucked."
But don't worry. Love will be in the
air spring quarter. Maybe
Dear Hug Me,
Many times while fast asleef > in my
loft iti Toyon, I have been awakened
by clanks and pops that, in my dreamy
state, / thought were ghosts dragging
chains through my bedroom. As" it
turned out, it was just the radiator
turning on dutifully at 6 a.m. What
causes this noise? Can it be stopped?
— Hot and Sleepless in Toyon
The phenomenon that all residents
of Toyon are familiar with is called
"water hammer.' Peter Gabriel will be
coming out with a record using the
sounds and titled "I Wanna Be Your
Water 1 lammer" next month.
Not really.
Director of University Operations
and Maintenance Ralph Buchanan,
who has answered innumerable Bug
Me questions and also arranged for my

tour of the steam tunnels last quarter,
helped shed some light on these
sounds.
According to Buchanan, Tovon is
heated by steam that is transmitted via
the tunnels from the Central Energy
Facility. A controlling device in Toyon
cuts back on the steam at about 5 p.m.
to equalize the temperature and save
money, and turns the steam back on at
about 5:30 a.m. Big changes in temper
ature will override this system.
When the steam is cut back, the
radiators in Toyon cool and the con
densate drains and is carried back to
the steam plant where it is reheated.
"Water hammer" occurs when, be
cause of some son of clog, the con
densate doesn't drain. In the morning,
when the heat comes back on, the
steam hits the cold condensate in the
radiator and you get that clanging that
could wake the dead.
• "Ordinarily, if everything is working
properly, there should be no prob
lem," Buchanan said.
If this is still a problem, Buchanan
said, the individual radiator will need

to be fixed. Anyone with this problem
should call his or her Residential Man
agement Office.
Dear Bug Me,
How much money is spent on

sculpture and its installation annually
at Stanford?
