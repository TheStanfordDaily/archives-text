# ASSU NEWS WANTED dead or on rye
## LISTEN UP, BUCKO 
### 
For the crime of slave-driving, murderous torture,
and bribing senators with Flicks Passes, the follow
ing people are WANTED.
. . . Applications for Business & Service Projects
should be available in the ASSU Business Office by
this Friday, and the deadline for applications is
Friday, February 13th. Petitions to run for the
Council of Presidents and the Senate will be
available February 9th and are due March 6th. . . .

COUNCIL OF PRESIDENTS

The four members of the Council of
Presidents, elected as a slate by the
entire student population, serve as the
elected branch of the ASSU. They have
the most fun but they also have to
work like dogs. Like right now. It's
2:00 a.m., man.
There are many different ways
of being President (That is one rea
son why there are four of them,
every year). Consider what was
said by the 1985-86 Council, a
random band of Chappies who
were considered, yes, to be
anomalies: "Any fool can be Presi
dent. Thai's why we got elected."
Contrast this with a statement
heard by one of this year's people:
"God damn, if I could just spend
another few years here and not
have to take any classes or inter
view for jobs, and be able to really
devote sixty hours a week every
week, I could really do something
with this place, y'know?"
SENATE
The Senate is an unruly but dedi
cated band of 40+ politically-active
self-flagellants which is the final au
thority on most formal ASSU actions,
including allocations of funds and ap-

Which is correct? Man, who
knows? The reason this job is so
awesome is that you can make it
any damn thing you please. It's
like the ASSU News, only not
quite as good; you can't tell abso
lutely everyone what you think all
the time (we have a contract with
the Daily. They can't stop us). But
you can define what you want to
do: what your issues are, what
your leadership is like, how many
hours you jam, what you ac
complish, how much power you
have (if any). Did you ever see the
movie The Candidate? Yeah, just
like that. All you have to do is (1)
find three people sharper than you
are, (2) find out what every single
student wants, (3) figure out ways
to get it for him/her no one has
ever thought of before, (4) meet
every student on campus by cam
paigning door-to-door, and (5)
crush your opponents.
