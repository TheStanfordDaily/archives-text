BOATHOUSE

Two lucky students get to live at the
Boathouse on the Lake and maintain

COURSE GUIDE

The Course Guide is planned to be
an on-line interactive information file
on every course at Stanford that stu
dents think is worth talking about.
When I was a sophomore I took
this Econ course. I can't tell you
which one it was because I still
have one more course to take and

PROGRAM BOARD

The Program Hoard is THE funding
outlet for the vast majority of Stan
ford's hundreds of student groups,
handling the allocations of over
$140,000 a year.
The Program Board never seems
to be well-liked. We pick nice
people to be on the Board, but
once they're on it, something

PUBLICATIONS BOARD

Publications Board funds nearly all
the campus' newsletters, newspapers,
journals, and literary collections,
leveraging them up by about $40,000
a year.
The naked woman lay by the
pool, her eyes shut tightly behind
her black Vuarnets. She was still
wet from the short swim she had
taken after lunch. The whole time
she swam, a voice kept nagging
her: "Don't go in, you'll get
cramps." That little voice was in
her head now. It was saying "Oh

home if you work past 3 a.m.
The ASSU News is above the
law. It's a full-page license to write
anything you fucking feel like.
Only a night every other week and
POWI you're the editor of a stu
dent government newsletter. You
don't even have to know diddley
about the ASSU. I sure don't.
One time we had to grab this guy
out of the water at 4 a.m. He was
drunk and kept screaming "I
parked my car here somewhere!"
We saved the guy's life and all he
did was puke on my Op's .. . Then
there was the day the KA's
decided to four-wheel drive on the
lakebed, before it got filled up.
There's still two Broncos stuck
down there. It's not just a job,
man. It's work, too.
those guys all kind of work to
gether. Anyway, I took this course
from this guy and I'm sitting in
class one day and the guy beside
me turns to me and says, "Excuse
me, but isn't this the worst class
you've ever had in your whole
fucking life?" "Yes," I replied.

really nasty happens. Maybe it's
the dark sunglasses and black
robes the members are issued. I
don't know. But I've seen the
nicest kids come in here and they
turn into dark, sordid, vomit
spewing, tight-assed little
Republicans. It's horrid. Luckily, it
didn't happen this year.

my ...Oh my . . over and over
again. First it would whisper. Then
it would scream. Sometimes it had
a British accent. Sometimes a
French. But always "Oh my ...
Oh my. . . Until, finally, it
stopped. Then she heard a heavy
sigh and actually felt a gush of
breath in her ear. She jumped up
and looked down at where her
head h.id been. A small brown bug
stumbled around drunkedly on
the wet pool deck. "Oh my fuck
ing head hurts." the bug said.
"You got any aspirin?"

SPEAKERS BUREAU

The Speakers Bureau invites, con
vinces, produces, and pays big bucks to
lively, thoughtful, and, for damn
sure, controversial speakers. Budget:
about $66,000.
I hate Vanna White. I mean, I
really hate Vanna White. What a
useless piece of posturing com
mercialized flesh. I mean, what
has she ever done for humanity?
Where does she get off getting on
the cover of People Magazine?
Christ, I hate her. I'm not ever
going to bring her to Stanford to
speak. But then, I don't have to. I
can bring whoever I want. I'm the
Director of the Speakers Bureau,

and by God if I want to let Vanna
White beg on her knees to come
here and be paid $8000 to speak
for eighty minutes, I can do it. I
mean I'd bring my mother first.
Really. Vanna begs better,
anyway.
When you're Director of the
Speakers Bureau, you have that
kind of power. Well, sometimes
the Senate gives you some hassle
— they're worried about all those
Daily headlines, "ASSU Pays
Enormous Sum To Valueless
Speaker" — but if you're sharp
you can convince them that the
idea is to BRING SPEAKERS STU
DENTS WANT TO SEE.

going to bring her to Stanford to
speak. But then, I don't have to. I
can bring whoever I want. I'm the
Director of the Speakers Bureau,

and by God if I want to let Vanna
White beg on her knees to come
here and be paid $8000 to speak
for eighty minutes, I can do it. I
mean I'd bring my mother first.
Really. Vanna begs better,
anyway.
When you're Director of the
Speakers Bureau, you have that
kind of power. Well, sometimes
the Senate gives you some hassle
— they're worried about all those
Daily headlines, "ASSU Pays
Enormous Sum To Valueless
Speaker" — but if you're sharp
you can convince them that the
idea is to BRING SPEAKERS STU
DENTS WANT TO SEE.

The naked woman lay by the
pool, her eyes shut tightly behind
her black Vuarnets. She was still
wet from the short swim she had
taken after lunch. The whole time
she swam, a voice kept nagging
her: "Don't go in, you'll get

me, but isn't this the worst class
you've ever had in your whole
fucking life?" "Yes," I replied.

the dark sunglasses and black
robes the members are issued. I
don't know. But I've seen the
nicest kids come in here and they
turn into dark, sordid, vomit

Republicans. It's horrid. Luckily, it
didn't happen this year.
