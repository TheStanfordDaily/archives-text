ADVERTISING AGENCY

Ad Agency does typesetting, print
ing, distribution, banners, Daily ads,
and original graphics to bring
messages to the entire campus. Reve
nues: about $80,000.
This dude in my freshman dorm
was a distributor for the Ad
Agency. He got paid $5 an hour to
go plaster pretty fliers all over
peoples' walls so that their dorm
halls were so thick they couldn't
walk down them twenty feet with
out being exposed to all those
wonderful messages. There were
always some fliers left over, so
he'd toss them onto the floor of his

LECTURE NOTES/COPY SERVICE

Lecture Notes runs a high-quality
copying and printing service and pro
vides complete notes for a score of the
most popular courses. Revenues: about
$70,000.
Imagine my surprise. I had gone
to my professor to get some
gentlemanly advice about the
event of the upcoming week, one I
was somewhat concerned about:
the final exam. Under my arm I
had my textbooks, my workbook,
the problem set questionnaires,
two calculators, and my lunch (I
was planning a major session). I
did not have any notes because I
had, uh, left them at home. Yeah.
"Good afternoon, sir. I'm
--, here for your ten o'clock office
hours. I, um, called earlier today.
How are you, sir?"
Smirk. "Ah yes. What can I help
you with?"
"Um, just wanted to ask you a
little about the final exam. I have a
few questions." Like, what has
happened in class since I last saw
your face the first week of the
quarter?
Suddenly a spark of interest
came into his eyes. "Wait a
second. I remember your name."

SPECIAL PROJECTS

Special Projects runs innovative
courses, rents refrigerators, sells
linens, and handles small
entrepreneurial ventures as the oppor
tunity to make money presents itself.
Revenues: about $30,000.
Special projects are fun. Re

SUNDAY FLICKS

The Flicks has for five decades
played first-run movies in a Mem Aud
packed with hundreds of catharsis
seeking students. Revenues: going
through the roof; about $90,000.
Did you know there were well
over 2000 Flicks passes sold this
quarter — no, we can't tell you
how many more than 2000, but
baby, it's a lot — and there aren't
but 1700 seats in Mem Aud? What
does that mean? Well, Mr. Sci
ence, that means there's going to
be some serious shit when they all
show up some day. I'm glad I don't
work the door at the Flicks, by
God, when all those former DUs

T-SHIRTS

T-Shirts sells original student
designed shirts and sweats and does
mass orders for dorms. Revenues:
about $70,000.
Did you see that tennis woman
on the Sports page of the Daily last
week? I forget her name. She was
playing in like the nineteenth
tournament she's won, making
this horrible grimace as she smacks
the shit out of the ball into some
poor fool's face. She has on this
"Stanford — Disneyland of the
North" sweatshirt. Okay, so I get
this call from my dad a week later
and he's incredibly pissed. He's

room. Then he'd walk on them a
while until they got ground really
good into the carpet. By the end of
Spring Quarter there was about
nineteen inches of this stuff all
over his floor except for this one
patch near the front where it was
clear so the door could open. I
heard that one day somebody
came in there and slipped on one
of the moguls and uncovered this
tremendous stench. They were
going to have to clean it up but my
friend was working the next day
and had enough fliers left to cover
the spot over.

"You do?"
He shook his head solemnly.
"Yes. You are the only person en
rolled who has failed to turn in a
single assignment J'm -.sflfir®,
but. . . ." He then proceeded to ex
plain to me the chances of Yfiy
passing the exam at this point.
I was lucky. I knew what to do. I
ran down to the ASSU Lecture
Notes office. "These are only in
tended as a supplement, and do
not replace constructive classroom
interaction," said the helpful
Notes employee. "That's okay, I
didn't have any to replace," I
noted politely.
Did I pass the exam? No. But
that's not the point of this story
anyway. The point is that Lecture
Notes is one of the most popular,
services on campus and you
should go out for the Directorship
because you will be serving vast
amounts of students, some of
whom have had valuable interac
tion in class and gotten many dates
from it. And you make money/
And you get a new office when
ASSU renovates this Spring. And
Jesus loves you, hurrah.

your teacher said, "I have a special
project for you!" So all the kids
went out to recess and you had to
stay and clean the bathroom. Well,
I don't remember anything like
that either, but Special Projects is
nothing like that anyway. I'm not
really sure what it's like.
come up with their passes wanting
to see "Animal House" or "Porky's
VII" or something. But hey, the
great part about that is that you
can make big bucks overbooking
and doing other fun things (like
advertising for things that aren't
there. Some people asked me at
dinner, "Why does the ad for the
Flicks say you can go there to see
people with 1 550 on the SAT
throw paper airplanes when when
you get there, they take away your
paper?" So I went and asked the
guy who runs it for us, and he said,
"Because I'm a hypocrite." He
makes a lot of money, though).
read the Ddily and he's like,
"What the hell is this? I pay
$17,000 a year for you to go to
Disneyland? You people call your
selves Disneyland out there? You
could have gone to Memphis State
for $250 a semester. They don't
call themselves theme parks at
Memphis State. They do serious
studying there." Anyway, the shirt
didn't go over too well with him.
But I like it. ASSU T-Shirts makes
that shirt and a whole lot of others
that I have. They are doing serious
expansion, making new shirts
more often. Awesome new
manager, too.

your teacher said, "I have a special
project for you!" So all the kids
went out to recess and you had to
stay and clean the bathroom. Well,
I don't remember anything like
that either, but Special Projects is
nothing like that anyway. I'm not
really sure what it's like.
come up with their passes wanting
to see "Animal House" or "Porky's

great part about that is that you
can make big bucks overbooking
and doing other fun things (like
advertising for things that aren't
there. Some people asked me at
dinner, "Why does the ad for the
Flicks say you can go there to see
people with 1 550 on the SAT
throw paper airplanes when when
you get there, they take away your
paper?" So I went and asked the
guy who runs it for us, and he said,
"Because I'm a hypocrite." He
makes a lot of money, though).
read the Ddily and he's like,
"What the hell is this? I pay
$17,000 a year for you to go to
Disneyland? You people call your
selves Disneyland out there? You
could have gone to Memphis State
for $250 a semester. They don't
call themselves theme parks at
Memphis State. They do serious
studying there." Anyway, the shirt
didn't go over too well with him.

that shirt and a whole lot of others
that I have. They are doing serious
expansion, making new shirts

Imagine my surprise. I had gone
to my professor to get some
gentlemanly advice about the
event of the upcoming week, one I
was somewhat concerned about:
the final exam. Under my arm I
had my textbooks, my workbook,
the problem set questionnaires,
two calculators, and my lunch (I
was planning a major session). I
did not have any notes because I
had, uh, left them at home. Yeah.
"Good afternoon, sir. I'm

hours. I, um, called earlier today.
How are you, sir?"
Smirk. "Ah yes. What can I help
you with?"
"Um, just wanted to ask you a
little about the final exam. I have a
few questions." Like, what has
happened in class since I last saw
your face the first week of the
quarter?
Suddenly a spark of interest
came into his eyes. "Wait a
second. I remember your name."

quarter — no, we can't tell you
how many more than 2000, but
baby, it's a lot — and there aren't
but 1700 seats in Mem Aud? What
does that mean? Well, Mr. Sci

the spot over.
