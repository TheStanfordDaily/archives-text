# Earth Sciences Dean Cox killed in cycling accident
## 
### 
Earth Sciences Dean Allan Cox, internationally
famed for his work in paleomagnetism and plate
tectonics theory, died in a bicycling accident in
the hills near his Woodside home yesterday. He
was 60.
An avid bicyclist, Cox often took long rides in
the mountains near his home during the early
morning hours before work. He told friends he
planned to try Tunitas Creek Road, a lightly
traveled, winding road through the woods, for
the first time Tuesday. He was about five miles
down the road from Skyline when he struck a
large tree head-on, according to Officer James
Del Carlo of the California Highway Patrol.
The tree was about six feet beyond the pave
ment. The bicycle went about 12 feet down an
embankment, out of sight from the road. Cox was
found about 100 feet down by a San Mateo
County sheriff s deputy, Del Carlo said.
There were no skid marks and no evidence of
any other vehicular involvement, he added. The
roadway was damp. Cox usually wore a helmet,
but told friends he was looking for a new, more
comfortable one.
Cox suffered massive head injuries. He was
pronounced dead at the scene at 1:35 p.m. by a

physician who worked with the California Divi
sion of Forestry.
Several University staff members, including
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington, began
searching for Cox around 10 a.m., after he failed
to show up at his campus office. Volunteers from
the King's Mountain Fire Brigade at the Skylonda
Station joined the search after his car was spotted
near Skyline.
University staff members notified Cox's sister,
Lois Weaver of Redwood City, of his death. She is
the sole survivor in his immediate family. A
memorial service is planned, at a time and place
to be announced.
On Jan. 6, Cox announced his intention to
relinquish the deanship June 30, take a sabbatical,
and then return to full-time teaching and re
search. He described the state of the school as
"very good, moving rapidly to excellent."
Cox was internationally known for fundamen
tal studies showing that the earth's magnetic field
has reversed. These studies confirmed plate tec
tonic theories of sea floor spreading and con
tinental drift. Cox received the Vetlesen prize in

achievement in the earth sciences.
In 1983, he and several colleagues
published a new time scale tracing the
history of the earth, used by geologists
worldwide to correlate and compare
their own findings to past work and to
each other. He received the Arthur L.
Day prize of the National Academy of

Siences (NAS) the following year.
A former president of the American
Geophysical Union, he was a member
of the NAS, the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences, and the American
Philosophical Society.
Cox earned three degrees at UC-
Berkeley and began his professional
career with the U.S. Geological Survey.
He became a Stanford professor of
geophysics in 1967 and dean of earth
sciences in 1979. He was the first
holder of the Cecil and Ida Green
professorship of geophysics.

He was a fellow of the Geological
Society of America, a fellow of the
American Geophysical Union, an
honorary member of the Society of Ex

He was serving as acting vice provost
and dean of research during University
President Donald Kennedy's leave of
absence as president. Kennedy des

humanity and a teacher with a
remarkable capacity to inspire."
