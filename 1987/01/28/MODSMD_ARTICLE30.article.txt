# Speech looks at Ladakh region
## 
### DAVID LIPPEATT 
Imagine a place where people
live together in peace, where vio
lence and crime are virtually un
known, where almost no one goes
to bed hungry. Imagine also that
these people live in harmony with
their land and that their days are
filled with joy and contentment. Al
though this tale seems to be from
the realm of fantasy, it's not. Such a
place actually exists.
Tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium, Swedish-born linguist
Helena Norberg-Hodge will come
to Stanford to tell a tale of despair
but also of hope. In a public lecture
entitled "Tradition and Develop
ment in Ladakh," she will speak
about her work with the people of
the former kingdom of Ladakh in
the Himalayas and about the threat
posed to their environment and
culture by modern "development"
and technology.
Norberg-Hodge made her first
visit to Ladakh in 1975, as a member
of a film crew. A year earlier, in
1974, the region — a remote area in
northern India near Tibet — had
been opened to foreigners for the
first time after 800 years of isola
tion. Norberg-Hodge became so
entranced with the people and their
way of life that she decided to stay.
From the start, she was intrigued
with the amazing harmony and
tranquility in Ladakhi culture. "At
first I thought that the Ladakhis
smiled a lot and appeared very
happy, but surely underneath they
were just like all human beings,
with their problems and feelings of
jealousy, anger and depression,"
she said.
"But after some years of living
with them I started realizing that all
the laughter was connected to a
deep sense of peace and contented
ness."
Buddhists, Hindus, Christians
and Sikhs coexist peacefully in
Ladakh, and little distinction is
made between rich and poor, ac

ator of Norberg-Hodge's appear
ance.
This philosophical tranquility is
balanced by a simple but successful
material culture that has supported
a well-fed, stable population for
hundreds of years, Stout said.
The "ecologically sustainable and
self-sufficient" Ladakhi way of life is
made possible through the efficient
use of scarce resources, she ex
plained.
"The Ladakhis have created a
remarkable civilization, and have
developed a quality of life which is
lacking in many of even the most
'modern' countries It's hard to
imagine that such a place could ex
ist," Stout said.
When the region was opened to
foreigners in 1974, however, this
fairy tale land began to change, ac
cording to Stout. Thousands of
visitors go to Ladakh each year,
bringing with them the trappings of
Western civilization — radios,
cameras and blue jeans.
Along with the tourists have
come "modern" problems. Ladakhi
families are breaking down as the
youth are lured to the cities by the
promise of a "better" life.
The sadness of this story,
however, is balanced by the hope of
Norberg-Hodge's promising work.
In collaboration with the Ladakhis,
she is working to establish the
Ladakh Ecological Development
Group (LeDG) in Leh, the capital.
According to Stout, LeDG works
to promote ecologically and cul
turally sensitive development alter
natives and appropriate technolo
gies. The group also "acts as an edu
cational center and ... encourages
Ladakhis to see the value of their
traditional way of life," she added.
Stout went on to describe
Norberg-Hodge as "an eloquent
and poignant lecturer who in an un
assuming way shows us that we
have much to learn from the tradi
tional culture of Ladakh. Recently,
Ms. Norberg-Hodge and LeDG
received the Right Livelihood
Award, an international award for
appropriate development efforts."

Imagine a place where people
live together in peace, where vio
lence and crime are virtually un
known, where almost no one goes
to bed hungry. Imagine also that
these people live in harmony with
their land and that their days are
filled with joy and contentment. Al
though this tale seems to be from
the realm of fantasy, it's not. Such a
place actually exists.
Tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium, Swedish-born linguist
Helena Norberg-Hodge will come
to Stanford to tell a tale of despair
but also of hope. In a public lecture
entitled "Tradition and Develop
ment in Ladakh," she will speak
about her work with the people of
the former kingdom of Ladakh in
the Himalayas and about the threat
posed to their environment and
culture by modern "development"
and technology.
Norberg-Hodge made her first
visit to Ladakh in 1975, as a member
of a film crew. A year earlier, in
1974, the region — a remote area in
northern India near Tibet — had
been opened to foreigners for the
first time after 800 years of isola
tion. Norberg-Hodge became so
entranced with the people and their
way of life that she decided to stay.
From the start, she was intrigued
with the amazing harmony and
tranquility in Ladakhi culture. "At
first I thought that the Ladakhis
smiled a lot and appeared very
happy, but surely underneath they
were just like all human beings,
with their problems and feelings of
jealousy, anger and depression,"
she said.
"But after some years of living
with them I started realizing that all
the laughter was connected to a
deep sense of peace and contented
ness."
Buddhists, Hindus, Christians
and Sikhs coexist peacefully in
Ladakh, and little distinction is
made between rich and poor, ac

ator of Norberg-Hodge's appear
ance.
This philosophical tranquility is
balanced by a simple but successful
material culture that has supported
a well-fed, stable population for
hundreds of years, Stout said.
The "ecologically sustainable and
self-sufficient" Ladakhi way of life is
made possible through the efficient
use of scarce resources, she ex
plained.
"The Ladakhis have created a
remarkable civilization, and have
developed a quality of life which is
lacking in many of even the most
'modern' countries It's hard to
imagine that such a place could ex
ist," Stout said.
When the region was opened to
foreigners in 1974, however, this
fairy tale land began to change, ac
cording to Stout. Thousands of
visitors go to Ladakh each year,
bringing with them the trappings of
Western civilization — radios,
cameras and blue jeans.
Along with the tourists have
come "modern" problems. Ladakhi
families are breaking down as the
youth are lured to the cities by the
promise of a "better" life.
The sadness of this story,
however, is balanced by the hope of
Norberg-Hodge's promising work.
In collaboration with the Ladakhis,
she is working to establish the
Ladakh Ecological Development
Group (LeDG) in Leh, the capital.
According to Stout, LeDG works
to promote ecologically and cul
turally sensitive development alter
natives and appropriate technolo
gies. The group also "acts as an edu
cational center and ... encourages
Ladakhis to see the value of their
traditional way of life," she added.
Stout went on to describe
Norberg-Hodge as "an eloquent
and poignant lecturer who in an un
assuming way shows us that we
have much to learn from the tradi
tional culture of Ladakh. Recently,
Ms. Norberg-Hodge and LeDG
received the Right Livelihood
Award, an international award for
appropriate development efforts."
