# Couples twirl toward ball
## 
### BRYN LLOYD 
Regal, classy and romantic are words
that come to mind when people think
of waltzing.
However, just as rock 'n' roll was
denounced in the 19505, waltzing was
condemned in the 1840s as a
"corrupter of the youth" because of its
supposed ability to drive people into a
passion.
Saturday night, 250 Stanford couples
will have the opportunity to try this
"sensuous" form of dancing at the 10th
annual Viennese Ball.
To prepare students for the dance,
the Viennese Ball committee has held
four dancing lessons. According to
graduate student Jim De La Hunt, one
of the main dancing instructors, the
lessons are offered because "generally
students do not know how to waltz or
polka."
"Also, the Viennese Ball is an expen
sive and exclusive occasion and we do
not want to be exclusive," he said.
"We're trying to do as many things in
conjunction with the ball as possible to
open it up to a wide variety of stu
dents."
Recent graduate Klaus See-tho, the
main dancing instructor, believes that
"on the whole the lessons are going
well. Everyone seems very enthusias
tic."
Approximately 80 people showed
up for the first lesson and the commit
tee believes that closer to the ball
several hundred students will come.
"There will be a huge crowd toward
the end of the week, it'll be a zoo," De
La Hunt said. "That's all right because
the Ball will be a zoo, too."
At the start of the two-hour sessions
the committee splits the room into
beginners and more experienced
waltzers. The beginning dancers are

separated into groups of men and
women to learn the proper steps. After
the footwork is down, the couples are
reunited and have the chance to try out
the dance.
The committee teaches the Viennese
waltz in which every six counts the
couple spins a complete revolution.
"The entire dance floor is moving like
a top," De La Hunt said, explaining that
because all the dancers are waltzing in
unison, if a couple gets confused and

stops it creates a potential problem.
"The ball gets a little hazardous,"
See-tho said. "The dance floor gets a
little crowded and people are moving
at such fast speeds."
Due to the constant spinning,
waltzers are known to get dizzy, and
the instructors even have their advice
on how to prevent queasiness. They
teach the women to look at either their
partner's chest or eyes. See-tho recom
mends that men look at a fixed point

and rest their eyes frequently.
Apparently dizziness is a much big
ger problem at the lessons then at the
ball because "it is much more accepted
to be dizzy when you're drunk and in
love," De La Hunt said.
Some students do not anticipate
having any problems with dizziness.

from getting dizzy I knew I would have

of informal dancing lessons offered by the ball's committee.
no problem. I'm so short that I can't
help but to look at my partner's chest,"
senior Rebecca Kat/ said.
According to De La Hunt, most of the
couples at the lessons seemed to have
the potential to be romantic, but they
seemed a bit unsure at the lessons.
As most years have proved, by the
time they get to the ball most will
probably be comfortable," he said.
The dancing instructors do their part
lo help the couples feel at ease."Most
dancing these days is separate, but the
wait/., polka and the swing all involve
holding each other. We encourage the
couples to stand close to each other
and to hoi J each other, De La Hunt
said.
'There is a lot more technique in
volved with waltzing, and in that way I
like it better than the type of dancing
we do at parties. It's especially fun on a
romantic evening to be able to hold
my partner,' senior Jim Stuebner said.
"Having group lessons was. really
fun because you realize that you are
not the only one who doesn't know
how to waltz. Also, I appreciated them

teaching us how to do the polka and
the swing,'' senior Stacey Goodwin
said.
Other participants described the les
sons as amusing. "The practices are
very funny because some people were
really bad," Katz said. "1 don't mean to
be sexist, but it was obvious that some
of the men had never danced like that
before, and they looked very klutzy.
Some of the women did not look to
graceful either."
Another potential problem with
waltzing is height. "We had a funny ex
perience several years back," De La
Hunt said. "A tall man was dancing
with a short woman across the floor
trying to show the class how to waltz
when all of a sudden there was a spec
tacular crash."
Not all the participants were new to
waltzing. Senior Mark Mitchell, one of
the opening ceremony committee
members, went to the lessons because
he had "never had professional danc
ing lessons and even though every
thing was review it really helped. They
taught waltzing well."
Mitchell also summed up the
feelings of many ballgoers when he
said, "I'm a little scared. I'm a terrible
waltzer and I need a lot more
practice."

my partner,' senior Jim Stuebner said.
"Having group lessons was. really
fun because you realize that you are
not the only one who doesn't know
how to waltz. Also, I appreciated them

teaching us how to do the polka and
the swing,'' senior Stacey Goodwin
said.
Other participants described the les
sons as amusing. "The practices are
very funny because some people were
really bad," Katz said. "1 don't mean to
be sexist, but it was obvious that some
of the men had never danced like that
before, and they looked very klutzy.
Some of the women did not look to
graceful either."
Another potential problem with
waltzing is height. "We had a funny ex
perience several years back," De La
Hunt said. "A tall man was dancing
with a short woman across the floor
trying to show the class how to waltz
when all of a sudden there was a spec
tacular crash."
Not all the participants were new to
waltzing. Senior Mark Mitchell, one of
the opening ceremony committee
members, went to the lessons because
he had "never had professional danc
ing lessons and even though every
thing was review it really helped. They
taught waltzing well."
Mitchell also summed up the
feelings of many ballgoers when he
said, "I'm a little scared. I'm a terrible
waltzer and I need a lot more
practice."
Regal, classy and romantic are words
that come to mind when people think
of waltzing.
However, just as rock 'n' roll was
denounced in the 19505, waltzing was
condemned in the 1840s as a
"corrupter of the youth" because of its
supposed ability to drive people into a
passion.
Saturday night, 250 Stanford couples
will have the opportunity to try this
"sensuous" form of dancing at the 10th
annual Viennese Ball.
To prepare students for the dance,
the Viennese Ball committee has held
four dancing lessons. According to
graduate student Jim De La Hunt, one
of the main dancing instructors, the
lessons are offered because "generally
students do not know how to waltz or
polka."
"Also, the Viennese Ball is an expen
sive and exclusive occasion and we do
not want to be exclusive," he said.
"We're trying to do as many things in
conjunction with the ball as possible to
open it up to a wide variety of stu
dents."
Recent graduate Klaus See-tho, the
main dancing instructor, believes that
"on the whole the lessons are going
well. Everyone seems very enthusias
tic."
Approximately 80 people showed
up for the first lesson and the commit
tee believes that closer to the ball
several hundred students will come.
"There will be a huge crowd toward
the end of the week, it'll be a zoo," De
La Hunt said. "That's all right because
the Ball will be a zoo, too."
At the start of the two-hour sessions
the committee splits the room into
beginners and more experienced
waltzers. The beginning dancers are

separated into groups of men and
women to learn the proper steps. After
the footwork is down, the couples are
reunited and have the chance to try out
the dance.
The committee teaches the Viennese
waltz in which every six counts the
couple spins a complete revolution.
"The entire dance floor is moving like
a top," De La Hunt said, explaining that
because all the dancers are waltzing in
unison, if a couple gets confused and

stops it creates a potential problem.
"The ball gets a little hazardous,"
See-tho said. "The dance floor gets a
little crowded and people are moving
at such fast speeds."
Due to the constant spinning,
waltzers are known to get dizzy, and
the instructors even have their advice
on how to prevent queasiness. They
teach the women to look at either their
partner's chest or eyes. See-tho recom
mends that men look at a fixed point

and rest their eyes frequently.
Apparently dizziness is a much big
ger problem at the lessons then at the
ball because "it is much more accepted
to be dizzy when you're drunk and in
love," De La Hunt said.
Some students do not anticipate
having any problems with dizziness.

from getting dizzy I knew I would have

senior Rebecca Kat/ said.
According to De La Hunt, most of the
couples at the lessons seemed to have
the potential to be romantic, but they
seemed a bit unsure at the lessons.

time they get to the ball most will
probably be comfortable," he said.

lo help the couples feel at ease."Most
dancing these days is separate, but the

holding each other. We encourage the
couples to stand close to each other
and to hoi J each other, De La Hunt
said.
