# Couples twirl toward ball

### BRYN LLOYD 
Regal, classy and romantic are words
that come to mind when people think
of waltzing.
However, just as rock 'n' roll was
denounced in the 19505, waltzing was
condemned in the 1840s as a
"corrupter of the youth" because of its
supposed ability to drive people into a
passion.
Saturday night, 250 Stanford couples
will have the opportunity to try this
"sensuous" form of dancing at the 10th
annual Viennese Ball.
To prepare students for the dance,
the Viennese Ball committee has held
four dancing lessons. According to
graduate student Jim De La Hunt, one
of the main dancing instructors, the
lessons are offered because "generally
students do not know how to waltz or
polka."
"Also, the Viennese Ball is an expen
sive and exclusive occasion and we do
not want to be exclusive," he said.
"We're trying to do as many things in
conjunction with the ball as possible to
open it up to a wide variety of stu
dents."
Recent graduate Klaus See-tho, the
main dancing instructor, believes that
"on the whole the lessons are going
well. Everyone seems very enthusias
tic."
Approximately 80 people showed
up for the first lesson and the commit
tee believes that closer to the ball
several hundred students will come.
"There will be a huge crowd toward
the end of the week, it'll be a zoo," De
La Hunt said. "That's all right because
the Ball will be a zoo, too."
At the start of the two-hour sessions
the committee splits the room into
beginners and more experienced
waltzers. The beginning dancers are

separated into groups of men and
women to learn the proper steps. After
the footwork is down, the couples are
reunited and have the chance to try out
the dance.
The committee teaches the Viennese
waltz in which every six counts the
couple spins a complete revolution.
"The entire dance floor is moving like
a top," De La Hunt said, explaining that
because all the dancers are waltzing in
unison, if a couple gets confused and

stops it creates a potential problem.
"The ball gets a little hazardous,"
See-tho said. "The dance floor gets a
little crowded and people are moving
at such fast speeds."
Due to the constant spinning,
waltzers are known to get dizzy, and
the instructors even have their advice
on how to prevent queasiness. They
teach the women to look at either their
partner's chest or eyes. See-tho recom
mends that men look at a fixed point

and rest their eyes frequently.
Apparently dizziness is a much big
ger problem at the lessons then at the
ball because "it is much more accepted
to be dizzy when you're drunk and in
love," De La Hunt said.
Some students do not anticipate
having any problems with dizziness.
"When they told us how to keep
from getting dizzy I knew I would have

Fantasy will turn to reality for some 250 couples at the 10th annual Viennese Ball Saturday night in Roble Gym. In
the meantime, the couples must grapple with the reality of learning to waltz, which they have been doing at a series
of informal dancing lessons offered by the ball's committee.
