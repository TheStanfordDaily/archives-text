## Pryor's 'Condition' is critical 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Richard Pryor's new movie,
"Critical Condition," takes place in a
New York hospital cut off from the
rest of the world by the devastating
effects of a hurricane. In its night of
isolation, the hospital becomes a
self-contained world â€” a microcosm
of New York City, complete with jet
set doctors, white-collar and blue
collar workers, a killer, junkies and
assorted lunatics.
The movie opens with the convic
tion of Kevin Lenehan (Richard
Pryor) for possession of stolen
goods, but he goes to the psychiatric
ward of the hospital rather than the
jail, thanks to his convincingly insane
act of falling in love with an ink blot.
Once inside the hospital, he wants
only to get out, and accordingly
changes his behavior from that of a
lunatic to that of a doctor.
His crazy character is much fun
nier than the character of Dr. Slat
tery, but Pryor as Slattery has his mo
ments. While making a cast for a pa
tient's broken leg, he uses too much
plaster and the patient says, "Doctor,
what are you doing, building up a
wall?" Another time, Pryor works up
a huge lather with two bars of soap
to delay performing an operation.
But this situational humor is scarce
and can't compensate for the poor
dialogue of the movie.
It pains me to see Pryor trying to
get laughs out of facial contortions
rather than witty lines. I've seen
Pryor wring humor out of such
serious and important issues as rac
ism, poverty and violence. Dealing
with these subjects, Pryor's humor

becomes daringly honest and open.
In this movie, his humor stoops to
slapstick and bathroom talk that may
entertain the eight- or nine-year-olds
in the audience, but true Pryor fans
will be disappointed.
For instance, Pryor says to a young
intern: "I got hemorrhoids older
than you, boy." And this is one of his
funnier lines. His first patient suffers
from constipation and he's asked to
operate on her. Such humor is more
appropriate for comics like Steve
Martin or Chevy Chase, who don't
have the depth or genius of Pryor.
The lack of humor in the script
does have a positive effect on the
character of Kevin Lenehan, for it un
earths Pryor's talent to act without
trying to be funny. You might not ex
pect good dramatic acting from
Pryor, but he acts so well in the part
of Lenehan (pretending to be a
lunatic and a doctor) that I would've
liked to see him play the character
straight throughout the whole
movie.
In fact, my favorite scene is a
serious moment when Lenehan (as
Dr. Slattery) checks in on a patient
with a spinal disorder. After a few
moments of silence, Lenehan's
facade as a doctor dissolves. The un
fortunate condition of the patient
moves him to tears. He awkwardly
offers the man a Lifesaver. I think this
scene was originally meant to be
funny, but Pryor plays the humor
down. The gesture of giving a piece
of candy becomes truly heart
warming and makes us realize that
the sick don't always need shots, X
rays and medical jargon to make
them feel better; simple human com

passion can suffice. Despite his lack
of medical knowledge, Lenehan is a
good doctor here simply because he
is a good man.
Although Lenehan pretends to be
a doctor in order to escape, he turns
out to be the hospital's best doctor.
He cures a hysterical woman whose
husband left her, turns the junkies
into efficient workers, delivers a
baby and instigates a successful op
eration. The moral here is that ordi
nary people aren't ordinary at all:
They have the ability to act, to
pretend, and therefore can be
anyone they want.
Deep inside all fanatic moviegoers
a little voice whispers, "I'll bet you
could play that part just as well or
better than that actor." That's why
"Critical Condition" is somewhat sat
isfying to me. Kevin Lenehan plays
the part of whomever he pleases.
Not only does he fool people into
believing he is the part, he shows
that he's better than the person
whose shoes he's filling.
If you have any latent desire to be
an actor, you can experience this
dream vicariously through Lenehan.
But Lenehan puts on such a good act
as a lunatic and a doctor we almost
forget that he's Richard Pryor. He
doesn't even look like the Pryor I've
seen in past movies (he's become
painfully emaciated with whatever
disease he has). Don't go to this
movie to see Richard Pryor because
you'll be disappointed; his natural
persona is buried under the three
different characters he plays. It's al
most as if he uses these characters to
hide his real self from this shoddy
movie.
