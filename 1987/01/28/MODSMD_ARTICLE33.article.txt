Reggae to medieval hymns, Puccini
to Grace Jones — just a few of the in
spirational sources for the works per
formed in Memorial Auditorium last
Friday night — offered audiences in
sight into the artistic vision of foun
der/artistic director Garth Fagan and
his ambitious Bucket Dance Theatre.
Fagan's eclectic range of thematic
and musical choices, along with his
synthesis of established modern dance
technique with traditional African and
Afro-Caribbean forms, reflect his train
ing with modern-dance greats such as
Jose Limon, Martha Graham and Alvin
Ailey as much as his cultural roots in
his native Jamaica.
The dancers, trained in the unique
Fagan technique and philosophy,

element.

element. Though based in technical
bravura and sheer muscularity, they
manage to avoid mere gymnastics by
infusing emotional integrity to their
movement. Backs ripple with uni
maginable fluidity in the "warm-ups"
of their first piece; in "Prelude," eleva
tion comes from nowhere in their
leaps; a series of turns is so fast that a
trace of the hand's path in the air mo
mentarily remains. Yet, the dancers'
virtuosity is never milked to the point
of distraction. One can't help but feel
that throughout the variety of moods,
an underlying sense of religiosity gives
content to the form.
The dancers' focus and concentra
tion is so intense, and their belief in
the movements so indisputable, that in
the midst of what could be ludicrous
(the juxtaposition of grand swoons and
quick, abrupt movements in"Court
Dance Contemporary" set to Puccini's
"Nessun Dorma") emerges an unex
pected sincerity.
"Never Top Forty (Juke Box)" — five
short situationally unrelated dances
from the dramatic opera piece to a
wistful rendition of "Over the Rain
bow" — holistically presents the
theme of yearning and hope. Dancer
Steve Humphrey, however, best ex
presses a seemingly unending frustra
tion through the repetition of a cycle of
steps. He incorporates a slow rhythmic
walk backwards, an occasional fury of
erratic spins and a phrase in which his

whole body begins to shake, gradually
building to a movement that it practi
cally cries aloud. But Humphrey could
just as probably be laughing. An ambi
valent exit, as the music fades, belies
the telling experience.
A moody Duke Ellington piece, a
solo danced by Norwood Pennwell
with a simple chair as an appropriate
prop, had a likable improvisational
look to it. A hectic "Easter Freeway
Processional," unfortunately set to the
insufferably monotonous music of
Philip Glass, followed.
Finally the highlight of the program,
"Mask Mix Masque," incorporated
most explicitly the African influence in

Fagan's choreography. Despite its
thoroughly bizarre ' elements, it
escapes the trap of gimmicky novelty.
The work is set in part to music by
Grace Jones; included are recurrent
snippets of an interview with her. She
discusses French lovers, Ibo heritage
(followed by a silent dance performed
by three men carrying horse tails) and
gives an affirmative answer to the ques
tion of whether she considers herself
to be the center of the universe, fol
lowed by a conclusive, "And you?"
Garth Fagan's Bucket Dance Theatre
will be performing at UC-Berkeley's
Zellerbach Hall this Friday and Satur
day at 8 p.m.

Stanford was treated to an ambitious and eclectic performance from the
Garth Fagan Bucket Dance Troupe (including dancer Steve Humphrey,
pictured above) last Friday. This weekend the troupe will perform at
Berkeley.
