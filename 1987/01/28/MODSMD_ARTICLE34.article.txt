## Baseball hosts Spartans in make-up of rainout 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Alter splitting the first two games, Stanford and San Jose
State will play the finale of an extended three-game series
today at 2 p.m. at Sunken Diamond The game was originally
scheduled for last Saturday, but was postponed by rain.
The Cardinal pitching staff is thought to be one of the best
in the nation this season and has done nothing in the first
two contests to dispel those expectations. The Stanford hur
lers have held the Spartans to just three runs and 11 hits in
17 innings.
San Jose State may been in for another long day at the
plate today, as the Spartans will be facing Stanford right
hander Steve Chitren. Chitren started 11 games for the Card
inal last season, going 2-5 with a 4.45 ERA. Those numbers
may not seem that impressive, but take away a nightmarish
appearance against Arizona State (five earned runs in just
one-third of an inning), and Chitren's ERA was a very re
spectable 3-HO.
"It's an all-right-handed lineup, so that's good from my
point of view," said Chitren about the Spartans. "They don't
have a lot of power. They're a slap team with a lot of contact
hitters. They like to go to the opposite field, so I'll try to
keep the ball inside and get my breaking ball over.
Getting the ball over was Chitren's main problem last
season. He gave up less than a hit per inning but walked 36
in his 66.2 innings. "Last year 1 had a lot of trouble with
walks," he said. "But this summer (in Alaska) 1 worked on
my mechanics, and that has really helped my control."
Another advantage that Chitren should have is the
weather. Foggy, damp weather usually helps a pitcher be
cause the wet ground keeps grounders from scooting
through the infield and makes it difficult for baserunners to

get traction. The dense air also tends to keep the ball in the
ballpark.
But because Chitren is from Las Vegas, these are benefits
he would just as soon do without. "Last year 1 pitched in the
rain for the first time," he said. "At first, 1 was getting really
frustrated. 1 couldn't understand why we were playing in
what I considered heavy rain. But 1 learned that you just
have to accept it and block it out.
Early games against non-conference opponents may seem
like only tuneups for the Pacific 10 Southern Division
season, but for the Cardinal players they are crucial. The
depth of talent that Stanford possesses has created competi
tion for spots throughout the Cardinal lineup, and nowhere
will jobs be more hard-fought for than on the mound.
"There is a lot of competition, but its good competition,"
Chitren said. "It keeps everybody on their toes."
Card notes
Despite being rated behind UCLA in both national
preseason polls, Stanford is the favorite to win the Six-Pac
championship, according to a poll of the conference
coaches.
The Bruins are ranked second by ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball and third by Baseball America (while the Cardinal
is fourth and fifth, respectively), but Stanford received 33
points in a 6-5-4-3-2-1 poll of the Six-Pac coaches to shade
UCLA by one. Four coaches picked the Cardinal while the
other two tabbed the Bruins to take the league title.
Arizona was picked third with 25 points, followed by
Arizona State (15 points), California (11) and IJSC (10). Both
Arizona (No. 15) and Arizona State (No. 25) made the
Baseball America preseason rankings, giving the Six-Pac
four teams in the top 25.
