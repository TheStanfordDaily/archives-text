# Wrestling team meets Fresno St. at home
## 
### FAITH PERRY 
Yes, there are more than raisins in Fresno. There are also
Bulldogs They range in size from 11K pounds to over 190.
Obviously, these aren't your average bulldogs; they're the
Fresno State wrestling team. They're coming to Maples
Pavillion tonight to face the Cardinal squad. And they're ex
pecting to win.
"We think we're going to do very well." Fresno State
Coach Dennis Deliddo said.
Stanford Coach Scott Horpel said, "Fresno is favored to
win, but quickly added, "Stanford has a good shot at
beating them."
Senior heavyweight Kurt Kassulke shares his coach's op
timism. "I feel confident about myself and the rest of the
team." Kassulke said.
Kassulke, team co-captain, has even,' reason to feel confi
dent. 1 le has won 16 of his last 23 matches, placed first in his
division in the recent "Aggie tournament and is second in
total team points to Ail-American Scott Wiggen. Kassulke is
expecting an easy match with Fresno State's James Machado.
Terry Maclntyre, however, isn't planning on such an easy
victory.
Maclntyre (190 pounds) will be wrestling against Bulldog
John O'Brien. O'Brien won the conference title last
year and, according to Horpel, will be a tough contender.
Horpel added: "Maclntyre has really improved. This is a
key match-up for the team, and Maclntyre looks good."
Maclntyre is coming off a win last week over Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo's Rick Ravalin and is looking to continue his
streak.
Also looking to continue a winning streak is freshman
Ron Perry (l"" 7 pounds). Although Perry trounced his Cal-
Poly opponent 11-4 last week, this week he appears to have
it tough. Perry will face PCAA champion Fred Little in
tonight's meet. Little, an All American, placed eighth in last
year's NCAA tournament. Perry will try to use the experi
ence that earned him second and third place in the Califor
nia high school state championships in order to beat
O'Brien tonight.
Junior Eric I lat her (167 pounds) will be reach tonight
after a forfeit last week due to illness. Harber, a returning
varsitv letterman. will go up against Fresno State s Vince

Walker. Haber has never wrestled against Walker before,
but is aware of Fresno State's excellent reputation.
"Fresno State is probably third right now in the newly
formed Pac-10 wrestling division," lie said. "Ill just have to
go out there and wrestle to the best of my possible ability.
Steve Yarbrough (15H pounds) is another Cardinal
wrestler who will be giving his best. A freshman from
Corrales, N.M., Yarbrough took one first and two thirds in
his high school state tournament. Yarbrough has done well
so far this season, making him Stanford's fourth leading
scorer. Although the freshman is recovering from a
sprained ankle. Horpel is expecting him to compete tonight
against Fresno's Cris Salisbury.
Cardinal co-captain Scott Wiggen is one wrestler Horpel
knows will be in top form tonight. Wiggen, a ISO pound All
American, is coming off an impressive 7-3 win last week
over Cal-Poly s Lance Cowart. Wiggen will be facing Fred
Hunziker tonight and will try to add another win to the 17
he's had this season.
Freshman Geoff Baum (142 pounds) will be up against
some tough competition this evening. Baum will be wres
tling former PCAA champion Alonzo Harrison. Baum is the
seventh greatest contributor of points to the Cardinal squad
this year. As a former member of the Stanford wrestling club
and graduate of Palo Alto High School, Baum will certainly
be supported by the home crowd.
Crowd support would definitely be appreciated by fresh
man Brian Veit (134 pounds). Veit had a successful high
school career in Mount Holly, N.J., but is having a bit more
difficulty with college competition. Veit will be looking for
his second win this season as he goes up against Bulldog
Dan Thomas.
Wrestling at 126 pounds is redshirt freshman Josh Lisle. In
high school, Lisle placed sixth in the California state tourna
ment. In his collegiate career he has won two out ol sis dual
meet matches. Lisle's opponent tonight will be Mike
Arimsted.
The Cardinal squad will be forfeiting at 11H pounds, as it
has done for every meet this season. This hasn't always
proved to be much of a disadvantage, however, as Stanford
currently has a 3-5-1 record in dual meets this seaon despite
going into every meet already down one match

All-American Scott Wiggen is 17-3-1 on the seaon for the Stanford wrestling team. The 150-pound senior is the top

over Cal-Poly s Lance Cowart. Wiggen will be facing Fred
Hunziker tonight and will try to add another win to the 17
he's had this season.
Freshman Geoff Baum (142 pounds) will be up against
some tough competition this evening. Baum will be wres
tling former PCAA champion Alonzo Harrison. Baum is the
seventh greatest contributor of points to the Cardinal squad
this year. As a former member of the Stanford wrestling club

be supported by the home crowd.

man Brian Veit (134 pounds). Veit had a successful high
school career in Mount Holly, N.J., but is having a bit more
difficulty with college competition. Veit will be looking for
his second win this season as he goes up against Bulldog

Arimsted.

has done for every meet this season. This hasn't always
proved to be much of a disadvantage, however, as Stanford
currently has a 3-5-1 record in dual meets this seaon despite
going into every meet already down one match
