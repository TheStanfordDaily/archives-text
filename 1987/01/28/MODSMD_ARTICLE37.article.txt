most other markets. Nationally, the New York Giants
Denver Broncos game received a hS 8 rating and 66

would be," said Lir.da I.evens, associate director of

watch this year's Super Bowl, which began shortly
after 6 p.m. EST The network now estimates that the

audience was 122.0 million, which would he the
second-largest in Super Bowl history behind the
Chicago Bears New England Patriots game in 19H6.
I.evens said neither team apparently had the na
tional appeal that the Bears displayed in last year s
Super Bowl, which received a -48.3 rating and "0
share
"The Bears were more than a football team, she
said yesterday."E\er\bod\ knew who the Fridge was
and that Jim McMahon wore a headband. They were
bigger than life '

viewing audiences because there were fewer televi
sion sets when those games were plaved The rating

television homes watching a program The share
represents the percentage (if sets in use which are
tuned to that program

Super Bowl declined in the second half as the Giants
pulled awav to a 39-20 victon The three previous
Super Bowls were also lopsided, but the\ all drew
higher ratings
