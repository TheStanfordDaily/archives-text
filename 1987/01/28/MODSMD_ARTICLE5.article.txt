# Fetter denies existence of Asian quotas
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter yesterday
vigorously denied the existence of limits on the number of
Asian-Americans admitted to Stanford.
Fetter's statement came in response to questions raised
by a Berkeley researcher who has been tracking admission
trends at the nation's most selective universities.
Ling-chi Wang, an associate professor of Asian-American
studies at the University of California-Berkeley, said many
prestigious universities, including Stanford, began restrict
ing admission of Asian students around 1983 after a surge in
Asian enrollment in the mid-19705.
"As soon as admission of Asian students began reaching
10 or 12 percent (nationwide), suddenly a red light went
on," Wang told the New York Times Jan 19. He added that
"universities suddenly realized they had what used to be
called a 'Jewish problem' before World War II and began to
look for ways of slowing down the admissions of Asians."
The U.S. Justice Department will decide in eight weeks
whether an investigation is merited into complaints of dis
crimination against Asians by a number of universities, said
Nathaniel Johnson, director of a unit responsible for enforc
ing laws against racial discrimination in education.
But Johnson would not say if Stanford is one of the uni
versities that may be investigated. Fetter said her office has
not been contacted by the Justice Department.
Wang, in an interview Monday with
The Daily, cited Stanford, Berkeley,
UCLA, Harvard, Vale and MIT as
suspects for discrimination. Wang
praised Stanford, however, for con
ducting a study into possible bias
against Asian-applicants.
"The Stanford faculty is to be com
mended. Stanford was the only one
where a faculty committee looked into
the issue," Wang said.
The study was done by a sub
committee of the Committee for Un
dergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid (CUAFA), a standing University
committee to which the undergraduate
admissions office is responsible.
CUAFA created the sub-committee in
March 1986 specifically to investigate
possible bias against Asians.
The committee released a summary
of its report in November which noted
that from 1982 to 1985, the ratio of
Asians who were accepted to those
who applied ranged from 66 to 70 per
cent of the admission rate for whites,
but that no objective difference in
quality of applicants explained the dis

crepancy. The committee hypothesized
that an unconscious bias was respon
sible.
While Wang did not directly accuse
Stanford admissions officials of impos
ing an upper limit, he did question the
fact that the admission rate for Asians
rose to 89 percent in 1986 after the fac
ulty committee had begun the study.
"The report speaks for itself. A bias
existed. But 1 think the use of the term
•'unconscious discrimination' is too
generous. . . . You have to question
why, after the faculty applies a certain
pressure, there is a sudden jump in the
number of Asians admitted," he said.
The number of Asians enrolling rose
more than 100 percent from 1985 to
1986, constituting a rise from nine to
16 percent of the freshman class.
But Fetter attributed the jump to the
quality of Asian applicants last year and
a greater number of Asians accepting
admission.
"We're seeing a large number of
Asian-American students coming with a
higher dedication to learning," she
said, adding that "there is absolutely no
limit. There are no limits or quotas of
any kind (used in the admissions
process)."
A former CUAFA committee mem
ber, however, said he was not satisfied

with the sub-committee's finding that
no limit on Asian-American admissions
exists.
At Brown (University) a similar
committee found they had limits by
using data analysis and interviewing
past admissions officers. I The sub
committee] had to rely on the word of
the dean of admissions," said Jeffery
Au. a student member of CI'AFA who
received an undergraduate degree in
political science in 1985 and a masters
degree in policy studies in 1986.
"The issue of a numerical limit was
not looked into rigorously enough," he
said.
Au also called for the release ot the
complete report, which has been kept
confidential "basically because it wasn't
written for public consumption. But
now 1 think it should be allowed out "
At the time Au supported the unani
mous committee decision to release a
two-page summary of the 30-page
report "because of time constraints (on
polishing the report) and we wanted to
get something out," he said.
CI'AFA Chairman Bob Eustis, associ
ate dean of the School of Engineering,
was out of town last night and could
not be reached for comment.
The summary made four recommen

datlons to undergraduate admissions,
which have been met, Fetter said. The
university reaffirmed its commitment
to non-discrimination due to ethnicity
in admissions, began tor the first time
to ask for voluntary identification ot ap
plicants' ethnicity in order to allow tor
more certain analyses of possible bias
in admissions, alerted high school
guidance counselors of Stanford s con
cern that in letters of recommendation
bias are sometimess exhibited, and
trained admissions officers on keeping
personally held stereotypes out of ad
missions decisions.

10 or 12 percent (nationwide), suddenly a red light went
on," Wang told the New York Times Jan 19. He added that
"universities suddenly realized they had what used to be
called a 'Jewish problem' before World War II and began to
look for ways of slowing down the admissions of Asians."
The U.S. Justice Department will decide in eight weeks
whether an investigation is merited into complaints of dis
crimination against Asians by a number of universities, said
Nathaniel Johnson, director of a unit responsible for enforc
ing laws against racial discrimination in education.
But Johnson would not say if Stanford is one of the uni
versities that may be investigated. Fetter said her office has
not been contacted by the Justice Department.
Wang, in an interview Monday with
The Daily, cited Stanford, Berkeley,
UCLA, Harvard, Vale and MIT as
suspects for discrimination. Wang
praised Stanford, however, for con
ducting a study into possible bias
against Asian-applicants.
"The Stanford faculty is to be com
mended. Stanford was the only one
where a faculty committee looked into
the issue," Wang said.
The study was done by a sub
committee of the Committee for Un
dergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid (CUAFA), a standing University
committee to which the undergraduate
admissions office is responsible.
CUAFA created the sub-committee in
March 1986 specifically to investigate
possible bias against Asians.
The committee released a summary
of its report in November which noted
that from 1982 to 1985, the ratio of
Asians who were accepted to those
who applied ranged from 66 to 70 per
cent of the admission rate for whites,
but that no objective difference in
quality of applicants explained the dis

crepancy. The committee hypothesized
that an unconscious bias was respon
sible.
While Wang did not directly accuse
Stanford admissions officials of impos
ing an upper limit, he did question the
fact that the admission rate for Asians
rose to 89 percent in 1986 after the fac
ulty committee had begun the study.
"The report speaks for itself. A bias
existed. But 1 think the use of the term
•'unconscious discrimination' is too
generous. . . . You have to question
why, after the faculty applies a certain
pressure, there is a sudden jump in the
number of Asians admitted," he said.
The number of Asians enrolling rose
more than 100 percent from 1985 to
1986, constituting a rise from nine to
16 percent of the freshman class.
But Fetter attributed the jump to the
quality of Asian applicants last year and
a greater number of Asians accepting
admission.
"We're seeing a large number of
Asian-American students coming with a
higher dedication to learning," she
said, adding that "there is absolutely no
limit. There are no limits or quotas of
any kind (used in the admissions
process)."
A former CUAFA committee mem
ber, however, said he was not satisfied

with the sub-committee's finding that
no limit on Asian-American admissions
exists.
At Brown (University) a similar
committee found they had limits by
using data analysis and interviewing
past admissions officers. I The sub
committee] had to rely on the word of
the dean of admissions," said Jeffery
Au. a student member of CI'AFA who
received an undergraduate degree in
political science in 1985 and a masters
degree in policy studies in 1986.
"The issue of a numerical limit was
not looked into rigorously enough," he
said.
Au also called for the release ot the
complete report, which has been kept
confidential "basically because it wasn't
written for public consumption. But
now 1 think it should be allowed out "
At the time Au supported the unani
mous committee decision to release a
two-page summary of the 30-page
report "because of time constraints (on
polishing the report) and we wanted to
get something out," he said.
CI'AFA Chairman Bob Eustis, associ
ate dean of the School of Engineering,
was out of town last night and could
not be reached for comment.
The summary made four recommen

datlons to undergraduate admissions,
which have been met, Fetter said. The
university reaffirmed its commitment
to non-discrimination due to ethnicity
in admissions, began tor the first time
to ask for voluntary identification ot ap
plicants' ethnicity in order to allow tor
more certain analyses of possible bias
in admissions, alerted high school
guidance counselors of Stanford s con
cern that in letters of recommendation
bias are sometimess exhibited, and
trained admissions officers on keeping
personally held stereotypes out of ad
missions decisions.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter yesterday
vigorously denied the existence of limits on the number of
Asian-Americans admitted to Stanford.
Fetter's statement came in response to questions raised
by a Berkeley researcher who has been tracking admission
trends at the nation's most selective universities.
Ling-chi Wang, an associate professor of Asian-American
studies at the University of California-Berkeley, said many
prestigious universities, including Stanford, began restrict
ing admission of Asian students around 1983 after a surge in
Asian enrollment in the mid-19705.
