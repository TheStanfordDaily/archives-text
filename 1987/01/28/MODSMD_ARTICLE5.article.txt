# Fetter denies existence of Asian quotas
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter yesterday
vigorously denied the existence of limits on the number of
Asian-Americans admitted to Stanford.
Fetter's statement came in response to questions raised
by a Berkeley researcher who has been tracking admission
trends at the nation's most selective universities.
Ling-chi Wang, an associate professor of Asian-American
studies at the University of California-Berkeley, said many
prestigious universities, including Stanford, began restrict
ing admission of Asian students around 1983 after a surge in
Asian enrollment in the mid-19705.
"As soon as admission of Asian students began reaching
10 or 12 percent (nationwide), suddenly a red light went
on," Wang told the New York Times Jan 19. He added that
"universities suddenly realized they had what used to be
called a 'Jewish problem' before World War II and began to
look for ways of slowing down the admissions of Asians."
The U.S. Justice Department will decide in eight weeks
whether an investigation is merited into complaints of dis
crimination against Asians by a number of universities, said
Nathaniel Johnson, director of a unit responsible for enforc
ing laws against racial discrimination in education.
But Johnson would not say if Stanford is one of the uni
versities that may be investigated. Fetter said her office has
not been contacted by the Justice Department.
