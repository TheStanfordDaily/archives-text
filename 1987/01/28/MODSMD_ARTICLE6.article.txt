# Panofsky urges Senate to OK test ban pact

### MORTY POSNER Senior staff writer 
Calling Reagan administration assertions that
the Soviet Union has "probably violated" the un
ratified Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT)
"unsupported by fact," a Stanford arms control
expert has recommended U.S. Senate approval of
the treaty.
Appearing before the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations Jan. 15, Wolfgang Panofsy, di
rector emeritus of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, testified that "there is no persuasive
evidence that the Soviets have violated the un
ratified treaty."

The treaty, signed in 1974 by President Nixon
and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, provides that
both the Soviet Union and the United States keep
nuclear tests to a minimum and that any test not
exceed a yield of 150 kilotons.
The treaty, which was never ratified by the Sen
ate, has been resubmitted by the Reagan adminis
tration. The administration has recommended
ratification, but with reservations requiring that a
protocol be negotiated to strengthen verification
that treaty agreements are being met.
Expanding on his Senate testimony, Panofsky
told The Daily: "There is no scientific precedent
that this (verification) be necessary."
He pointed out that a nuclear explosion of

more than one kiloton can be verified by seis
mological or other scientific means.
Panofsky noted that since 1976 the United
States has conducted more nuclear tests than the
Soviet Union and is doing so at the present time.
During this period, the Soviets have conducted
about 190 nuclear tests, and none of these has oc
curred in the last year and a half, he said.
The Soviets have indicated that they will
resume nuclear tests unless the United States dis
continues the tests it is conducting, Panofsky ex
plained.
"I don't think it (the treaty) risks our security,"
Panofsky said.
In addition to passage of the treaty, Panofsky

said he would like to see the kiloton threshold
and the number of permissible nuclear tests
lowered.
"I think the world would be better off if there
were fewer," Panofsky said.
Responding to critics in the administration who
charge that the Soviets have not been complying
with the treaty, Panofsky said the scientific com
munity agrees that the Soviets have been in com
pliance. He added that Soviet compliance has
been confirmed by the directors of the Lawrence
Livermore and Los Alamos defense facilities.
Panofsky believes passage of the treaty may
portend future agreements in the field of arms
control.
