## Expert says 56,000 will die in 1991

By 1991, AIDS will be the leading
cause of death for sexually active
young people age 15 to 40, according
to a senior investigator for the National
Institutes for Health.
Dr. Tom Quin, also an assistant pro
fessor at John Hopkins University
Medical School, spoke yesterday on
"AIDS â€” Two Cultures, One Virus: The
Evolution of a Virus in Africa and the
U.S." The lecture was offered as part of
a Human Biology course, "Biosocial
Aspects of Sexually Transmitted
Diseases."
Quin predicted that 56,000 people
will die from acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in 1991, "more
deaths than occurred in the Vietnam
war" and more deaths than result from
automobile accidents each year.
Calling the disease an "international

discussed the effects of culture on the
origin and spread of AIDS in the
United States and Africa.

The number of AIDS cases in Africa
dwarfs the number of cases found in
the United States and South America,
Quin said. In Africa, several new strains
of the AIDS virus have developed,
which seem to cause AIDS but cannot
be identified by current tests, he ex
plained.
"These viruses are now only found
in Africa, but we fear they may spread
to the U. 5.," Quin said.
"For any of you who go on a safari,
are hit by a hippo and need a blood
transfusion, you'll wish you'd been hit
harder by the hippo," he said, noting
that one of the greatest causes of AIDS
in Africa is contaminated blood trans
fusions.
AIDS in Africa is going to "match
malaria in both morbidity and mor
tality in a given population," Quin said.
In the United States, AIDS initially
spread through the homosexual popu

its peak," he said. People infected in
those early years tended to be promis
