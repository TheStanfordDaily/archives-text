# AIDS' fatalities
## Expert says 56,000 will die in 1991 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
By 1991, AIDS will be the leading
cause of death for sexually active
young people age 15 to 40, according
to a senior investigator for the National
Institutes for Health.
Dr. Tom Quin, also an assistant pro
fessor at John Hopkins University
Medical School, spoke yesterday on
"AIDS â€” Two Cultures, One Virus: The
Evolution of a Virus in Africa and the
U.S." The lecture was offered as part of
a Human Biology course, "Biosocial
Aspects of Sexually Transmitted
Diseases."
Quin predicted that 56,000 people
will die from acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in 1991, "more
deaths than occurred in the Vietnam
war" and more deaths than result from
automobile accidents each year.
Calling the disease an "international
epidemic of global proportions," Quin
discussed the effects of culture on the
origin and spread of AIDS in the
United States and Africa.

The number of AIDS cases in Africa
dwarfs the number of cases found in
the United States and South America,
Quin said. In Africa, several new strains
of the AIDS virus have developed,
which seem to cause AIDS but cannot
be identified by current tests, he ex
plained.
"These viruses are now only found
in Africa, but we fear they may spread
to the U. 5.," Quin said.
"For any of you who go on a safari,
are hit by a hippo and need a blood
transfusion, you'll wish you'd been hit
harder by the hippo," he said, noting
that one of the greatest causes of AIDS
in Africa is contaminated blood trans
fusions.
AIDS in Africa is going to "match
malaria in both morbidity and mor
tality in a given population," Quin said.
In the United States, AIDS initially
spread through the homosexual popu
lation, "at a time when gay pride was at
its peak," he said. People infected in
those early years tended to be promis
cuous, causing a rapid spread of the
disease, Quin said.
The disease spread to homosexual
intravenous drug users, heterosexual
drug users and hemophiliacs, accord
ing to Quin. He added that the disease
is now beginning to infect prostitutes.
"Our concern right now is that while
the disease is still spreading into these
segments, it probably will increase
more rapidly in the heterosexual pop
ulation," Quin said.
Increased education will limit the
spread of AIDS, according to Quin.
Outside ot the United States, the
countries in the Americas most af
fected by AIDS are Brazil, Haiti, Argen
tina and those in the Caribbean.
Reports of AIDS cases from those
countries may be distorted because
countries that depend on "sexual
tourism" don't like to admit they have
an AIDS problem, Quin said. Fear of
AIDS devastated the economy in Haiti,
which depends heavily on tourism, he
said.
AIDS is caused by the human im
munodeficiency virus (HIV). A person
can be infected with the virus and
show no signs of the disease, but still
transmit the virus through sexual inter
course or other means, such as donat
ing infected blood or sharing infected
needles.
"There is not one individual to our
knowledge who has developed 100
percent immunity to this virus," he
said.

In 1991, AIDS will kill more people than died in the Vietnam war, according
to Dr. Tom Quin, a senior investigator for the National Institutes of
Health. By then, AIDS will be the leading cause of death for sexually active
young people age 15 to 40. AIDS is an "international epidemic of global pro
portions," he said.
