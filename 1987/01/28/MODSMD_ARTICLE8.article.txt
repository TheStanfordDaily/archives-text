# Reporter's Notebook: Of University presidents and the press

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass — So what's a univer
sity president to do when the student daily up
sets him?
For Harvard's Derek Bok, the answer is
simple: stop talking to student reporters.
Bok, said to take offense at The Harvard
Crimson's coverage of the university's 350 th
anniversary celebration, informed the news
paper last October that he would no longer
grant The Crimson interviews. Questions for
the president would have to be submitted in
writing.

Bok kept his vow of silence up to winter
vacation, speaking with the Crimson staff only
during its annual Halloween appearance at his
home. At the beginning of January, he
departed for a three-month sabbatical
Crimson managing editor Jonathan Moses
said a Harvard vice president recently called
the newspaper to say Bok will reconsider his
press policy when he returns in April.
By way of contrast, Stanford President
Donald Kennedy has chosen in recent years to
battle inaccuracies and perceived biases in
The Daily with candid confrontation and in
creased accessibility. He is quick to protest
when he deems coverage unfair, yet he seems

never to hold grudges against The Daily or in
dividual reporters.
When a Daily reporter covering an ASSU
Senate meeting in October wrote an inac
curate account of Kennedy's comments on
corporate disinvestment from South Africa,
the president, livid, immediately called the
editor to set the record straight and sent The
Daily a letter for publication as well. Two days
later, though, Kennedy responded to a ques
tion about the ASSU article by affirming his
confidence in the author's competence,
noting that a young reporter could easily have
been confused by the complex issues dis
cussed at the meeting

Similarly, after a Daily columnist wrote a
piece based on an off-the-record conversation
with Kennedy, the president noted his disap
proval hut then invited the columnist back for
another interview that would be clearly
labeled on-the-record.
Kennedy is invariably gracious about
keeping channels of communication open. In
good times or bad, he welcomes interviews,
tells reporters to call him at home, and contin
ues his quarterly press conferences.
Yet Kennedy is not shy about criticizing
coverage that he feels puts him in a bad light.
An article last fall noting that Kennedy had
not returned a phone message from The Daily

yielded an angry call from his office.
In a meeting with Daily editors at the begin
ning of fall quaner, Kennedy said he feared
that The Daily was assuming a blindly anti
administration stance on every major issue, at
times misconstruing facts in the process.
Asked to specify which issues The Daily had
handled unfairly, he cited editorials on
University-USW relations and Stanford's fresh
man Western Culture program.
The president explained that, contrary to
the newspaper's editorials, the Kennedy ad
ministration is neither "out to get" United
Stanford Workers nor opposed to changing
the focus of the Western civilization core.
