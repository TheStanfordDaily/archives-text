Court overturns Bird decision
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court, reversing a controversial
opinion of the California Supreme Court, ruled yesterday that a murderer's
rights were not violated when jurors were told not to be "swayed by mere
sympathy."
The case turned on a standard instruction given to juries weighing capi
tal punishment. After hearing testimony, including that of 13 witnesses who
told of the defendant's difficult childhood and his "peaceful nature," the
judge told the jury that it "must not be swayed by mere sentiment, con
jecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling."
In 1985, California's Supreme Court under Chief Justice Rose Bird said
this "anti-sympathy instruction" violated the U.S. Constitution because it
would cause the jurors to ignore the testimony in the defendant's favor.
State Attorney General John Van De Kamp appealed the decision, contend
ing that the instruction simply tells jurors to put aside emotional reactions.
The U.S. Supreme Court, on a 5-4 vote, ruled that the state court had no
basis for rejecting the death penalty for Albert Brown, convicted of the
1981 rape and murder of a 15-year-old Riverside girl. The ruling could also
clear away a major obstacle in nearly 100 other pending Death Row cases.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the Supreme Court, said a
reasonable juror hearing this instruction from a judge "would likely inter
pret the phrase as an admonition to ignore emotional responses. An in
struction prohibiting juries from basing their sentencing decisions on fac
tors not presented at trial, and irrelevant to the issues at the trial, does not
violate the U.S. Constitution" (California vs. Brown, 85-1563).
Germans arrest terrorist suspect
BONN, W. Germany — West German police have arrested the brother of
a Lebanese terrorist suspect already held in West Germany and wanted by
the United States, officials said yesterday.
Abbas Ali Hamadi, 28, a naturalized West German citizen, was arrested as
part of an investigation into the recent abductions of two West German
businessmen in Beirut by kidnapers seeking the suspect's release, accord
ing to knowledgeable sources. Police also rounded up several Lebanese
citizens in raids in Hamadi's home village in southwestern West Germany,
and one was shot and wounded while trying to escape, officials said.
West German television reported that police had sealed off an area nine
miles south of Hamadi's home and that a cache of weapons had been dis
covered.
Meanwhile, well-informed sources in Bonn said that West Germany was
exploring the possibility of exchanging Abbas Hamadi's brother,
Mohammed Ali Hamadi, for two West Germans and one or more
Americans now held by kidnapers in Lebanon.
The West Germans are hopeful that an effort to include American
hostages in any exchange of Hamadi for the two German captives in
Lebanon might mollify the potential American outcry if Hamadi were not
tried in U.S. courts. The administration, while professing publicly the abso
lute need to extrade Hamadi from West Germany, has not demanded that
Bonn desist from pursuing such a resolution of the crisis, according to
West German officials.
U.S. and West German officials monitoring the crisis in Bonn fear that ex
traditing Mohammed Hamadi to the United States could result in the ex
ecution of the West German hostages and possibly some Americans as well.
Mubarak, Assad meet in Kuwait
KUWAIT — In a sign that Egypt's isolation in the Arab world is ending,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met yesterday with Syrian President
Hafez Assad.
The meeting seemed almost casual, with the Egyptian leader walking
over and taking Assad's hand as the two arrived for an afternoon session of
the summit meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. But
what seemed like a chance encounter quickly became the centerpiece of
the conference, which was in its second day.
Since Mubarak became president in 1981, following the assassination of
Anwar Sadat, Assad had not agreed to meet with him. Moreover, Assad had
a prominent role in the move to ostracize Egypt for signing a peace treaty
with Israel in 1979.
Yet, according to Egyptian sources, Mubarak and Assad were to meet
again last night. These sources said the meeting was brought about largely
by the mediation of Saudi Arabia, whose King Fahd met with Assad earlier
in the day.
Egyptian officials and Western diplomats expected little of substance
from the meeting between Mubarak and Assad. The two are almost
diametrically opposed on virtually every major issue — from the peace
process with Israel, which Egypt supports and Syria opposes, to the Iran-
Iraq War, in which Egypt has become an ally of Iraq and Syria has
befriended Iran.
Gorbachev calls for secret ballot
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday called for
secret-ballot elections of senior Communist Party officials as a key step
toward what he called the democratization of political life.
Speaking at the opening of a plenary session of the party's Central Com
mittee, Gorbachev said the leadership is considering proposals to field
more than one candidate for elective offices and to broaden opportunities
for non-party members to hold government posts.
The proposed changes are part of a long-promised personnel policy that
has been in the works since last July when Gorbachev stepped up his cam
paign for restructuring Soviet society and the economy.
They are also a significant admission of the party's failure until now to
supply and renew a reliable, qualified pool of leaders. Gorbachev pre
sented the proposals yesterday in the midst of a stinging attack on the rule
of the late party leader Leonid Brezhnev, a period he said had led to an
overall "decline in social mores."
Gorbachev's speech hit hard at those members of the party's old guard
who, he said, "abused their authority, suppressed criticism, sought gain
and some of whom even became accomplices, if not organizers, of crimi
nal activities."
Nicaragua frees American "spy"
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The Nicaraguan government yesterday freed a
U.S. congressman's brother who had been jailed here on espionage
charges, saying that his "mental instability" might lead him to attempt
suicide.
Deputy Interior Minister Javier Chamorro said that Sam Hall was turned
over to Gary Froelich, a family lawyer, and would leave Managua this morn
ing for the United States.
Chamorro called the release of Hall, a one-time Olympic diving medalist
and self-styled counterterrorist, a "humanitarian gesture." He said that psy
chiatrists had determined that Hall has an "unstable personality" and could
"attempt suicide."
Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Angela Saballos said that the
government lacked proper medical facilities in which to treat Hall.
Hall, 49, the brother of Rep Tony Hall (D-Ohio), was arrested Dec. 12 in
a restricted military zone near the Punta Huete air base, 30 miles northeast
of the capital. Sam Hall allegedly was concealing hand-drawn maps of a
Nicaraguan port and prison in his sock.
U.S. Embassy spokesmen said that they had no comment on Hall's
release.
Five days after Hall was captured, the Sandinistas pardoned and released
another American prisoner, Eugene Hasenfus, convicted Nov. 15 by a
revolutionary tribunal of smuggling guns to the contras. Hasenfus was
captured Oct. 5 after his C-123 cargo plane was shot down in southern
Nicaragua.
Documents aboard the plane provided the blueprint for a clandestine,
American-run rebel supply operation from Honduras and El Salvador.
