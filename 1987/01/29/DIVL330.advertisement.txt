NCR Microelectronics — Fort Collins is in
beautiful Colorado . . . usually. However, on
February 5 we will be at Stanford. If you have ideas
for advancing semiconductor technologies or CAD
— or other plans for a career in microelectronics —
come see us then.
In 1981, we started a little semicustom business
and have grown to become the number one
supplier in the world for the not so basic "ASICs"
(Application Specific IC's) known as cell-based
designs. Specifically, this is the fastest growing
segment of the microelectronics industry, and as
you probably know, that in itself is usually a pretty
fast business.
We attract the best people in the industry with a
simple offer: a meaningful career with a growing
leader. If you want to hear more, please contact the
placement office for more details.
An equal opportunity employer.
