# UPDATE
## Americans banned from Lebanon 
### 
WASHINGTON — Warning that "'no American can
be considered safe from terrorist acts" in Lebanon,
the State Department yesterday invalidated U.S. pass
ports for travel to the strife-torn Middle East country
where at least eight Americans are held hostage.
The restrictions, besides discouraging Americans
from going to Lebanon, are intended to put pressure
on the estimated 1,500 U.S. citizens still there to
leave. Their U.S. passports will become invalid in 30
days, State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said.
The action, ordered by Secretary of State George
Shultz five days after three American professors were
kidnapped in Beirut, underscored the Reagan admin
istration's frustration in coping with terrorist acts in a

country where the central government has been
unable to maintain order.
Redman said that Shultz acted because of "the im
minent danger and the limited ability of the U.S. gov
ernment to assist citizens in distress in Lebanon.
"This determination is not lightly made," he said.
"We are loath to impede the travel of American
citizens in any way. Nevertheless, the situation in
Lebanon, and in West Beirut in particular, is so
chaotic that we do not believe any American citizen
can be considered safe."
Violators of the new rules will be subject to prose
cution, Redman said, with maximum penalties of as
much as five years in prison and a $2,000 fine, though
officials acknowledged that such legal action would

be difficult to earn* out.
Until yesterday's announcement, such restrictions
were in effect on travel to only one other Mideast
country, Libya.
Exempt from the new restrictions are the immedi
ate families of the eight Americans who are among 29
Westerners believed kidnapped in Lebanon.
Redman said that despite repeated warnings, some
Americans in Lebanon "may still believe that their
profession, national origin, religious affiliation, links
to Lebanese citizens or their own precautions may
save them from the dangers."
The U.S. Embassy in Beirut is being kept open with
a "minimum" staff, Redman said.
