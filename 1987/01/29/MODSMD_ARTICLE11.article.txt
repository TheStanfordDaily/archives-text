MANILA, Philippines — The defense
minister announced today that 200
rebels had agreed to end their two-day
occupation of a Manila broadcasting
complex.
"I'm glad to announce we have
ended another episode in the history
of disturbances that have plagued us
these many months," Defense Minister
Rafael Ileto told reporters.
The end of the occupation, which
began early Tuesday, was announced
after a two-hour meeting between mili
tary leaders and Col. Oscar Canlas,
who led the group of mutineers which
took over the studios.
Canlas refused to call the lifting of
the occupation a surrender, saying "we
never left the armed forces." Ileto said

the question of punishment for the
mutineers, whom the government
linked to ex-President Ferdinand
Marcos, would be discussed later.
President Corazon Aquino vowed
Tuesday to punish "to the fullest extent
of the law" the estimated 500 rebels
who attempted to take over major
media and military facilities in the capi
tal.
The mutineers at the television
radio complex were the last rebel
hold-outs.
Pro-government troops surrounding
the television and radio complex fired
about a dozen tear gas cannisters
shortly after a deadline expired late
yesterday, but did not attack.
Jose Magno, military adviser to

Aquino, said military chief of staff Gen.
Fidel Ramos ordered a halt to opera
tions against the rebels after a five
hour meeting with 200 officers ranging
in rank from lieutenant to colonel.
Participants iii the meeting told The
Associated Press that they did not agree
with the goals of the mutineers, and
Magno said none of them actually
refused to fight.
However, officers said they believed
an attack would threaten the unity of
the military, and they interceded with
Ramos because they were friends and
classmates of some of the rebels.
One of the officers who met with
Ramos, Col. Gregorio Honasan, said he
and his comrades "were just hoping to
keep the AFP (Armed Forces of the
Philippines) intact."

Up to 1,000 heavily armed soldiers,
marines and riot police t(x>k positions
around the walled broadcast center in
suburban Manila. It was the last posi
tion held by rebels who had attempted
a pre dawn coup Tuesday, the most
serious challenge by right-wing mili
tary men since Aquino came to power
11 months ago.
Canlas denied any links to Marcos
and said the takeover was aimed at
dramatizing the Communist threat and
their military grievances. Some mili
tary officers have criticized Aquino's
peace overtures toward Communist
rebels. The government has negotiated
a cease-fire with the Marxists and has
held peace talks to end the 18-year-old
insurgency.
