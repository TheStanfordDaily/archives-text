### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Silicon chip production and living with AIDS are
topics with no apparent connection, hut both have
proven to he winners fur Stanford-educated film
makers.
Ruth Carranza and Tina DiFeliciantonjo have each
been selected for first place awards in the Academy
of Television Arts & Sciences' annual College Televi
sion Awards. Both received master's degrees in docu
mentary film making from Stanford's Communica
tion Department in 1986.
Carranza's 30-minute film, "Silicon Run,' shows
the fabrication of integrated circuits from the devel
opment of silicon crystals to the production of chips

ready for testing Her work has also been awarded a
Golden Eagle Award from the Council on Interna
tional Nontheatrical Events.
"Living VC'ith AIDS is DiFiliciantonio s film about
Kevin Coleman, a San Francisco man who died from
AIDS in 1985 at age 22. She has produced and di
rected four other films.
Carranza was impressed that Stanford rook two of
the television academy's top three awards for docu
mentary film making. Many of the 217 films submit
ted came from students at IJSC, UCLA and New York
University â€” schools that dwarf the Stanford s pro
gram in numbers and reputation.
Stanford's strength is its size, according to Car
ranza. Because her class in 1981 had onlv 12 stu

dents, "everyone had access to the equipment," she
said.
In recent years, the master's classes have had only
seven or eight students, according to Communica
tion Prof. Hon Alexander.
Stanford, Alexander noted, focuses on documen
tary work while other schools teach students how to
make feature-length fictional films.
The program has been more visible lately because
there are a great many contests one can enter, said
Alexander. Last year a Stanford graduate netted a new
car after winning the prestigious Nissan Focus Award.
The winners will be honored at an awards cere
mony in Los Angeles on March 8. They will each
receive $2,000 from the Mobil Corporation, sponsor
of the competition.
