## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Bring back Bowl 
### 
On a January morning two years ago, the tea?>er
headlines on The Daily's front page read: Bowl Finally
Over.
That same page also had this lead story: Come again?
Stanford debates future Bowl bids.
Back then, Athletic Director Andy Geiger said Stanford
had made no commitment to host a future game, but that
he expected to talk with the NFL about the possibility.
University President Donald Kennedy questioned the
propriety of diverting Stanford resources to a non
academic venture the size of the Super Bowl, saying:
We're going to have to take a long look at it before we
decide it's something we ought to repeat."
Now, University officials are saying that Stanford is
obligated to do more than merely consider hosting an
other Super Bowl. "It was written in the contract that it
would be welcome (at Stanford) should all parties
agree," Geiger said this week. He also said this provision
was no surprise to the University.
And at last week's Faculty Senate meeting, acting Uni
versity President James Rosse said the Super Bowl may
return to Stanford Stadium in 1991.
It seems that two years have produced a turnabout in
the University's public stance. Or perhaps officials were
genuinely confused about Stanford's contractual agree
ments with the NFL But that's a small matter compared

to t nis looming question: Should we host the Super Bowl
again?
Yes.
it would be a gesture of good will to the Bay Area, a
community that wants to host the Super Bowl and has
given much to the University.
It would be a gesture of good will to the NFL as well,
especially since the organization provided extensive
renovations to the stadium.
It would draw attention to Stanford during its centen
nial year with some positive publicity.
And, if 1985 is any indication, it also would not incur
the negative consequences that some critics fear.
Although enormous University resources were used in
preparation for the Bowl, the Bowl itself did little, if any
thing, to disrupt the campus. Signs of the game's pres
ence that day were limited to the stadium and its en
virons; mere minutes away in White Plaza, it was just like
any other Sunday in January. Only those who wanted to
be involved got involved.
Which brings up the final point in the Bowl's favor: It's
entertaining.
Sure, it's a commercial sport and Stanford is an aca
demic institution. But academics don't preclude fun. If
Stanford has the ability and the opportunity to provide its
community — and the rest of the nation — some enter
tainment, then it's appropriate to do so.
