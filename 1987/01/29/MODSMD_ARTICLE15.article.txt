# Through Forsyth County
## 
### 
I was in Cumming, Ga., the seat of Forsyth County, on Sat
urday, Jan. 24, 1987. I marched with over 20,000 individuals
of conscience, between a gauntlet of local police, Georgia
Bureau of Investigation agents, state troopers and Georgia
National Guard, who kept nearly 1,000 Ku Klux Klan mem
bers and local bigots from attacking us. We were watched
over by seven helicopters, five national news networks with
mobile satellite units and countless other local television,
radio and print reporters, all scurrying about with
videocameras or notepads.

We marched for a mile and a half with our arms linked,
six abreast, singing '60s protest songs and timeless
spirituals. Houses and small businesses lined the country
lane. Confederate flags hung from some windows and
doors. Out of these places came men and women, often
dressed in camouflage outfits, waving flags and hooting the
nastiest names they could. They wrinkled their faces to
wring every drop of venom from their brains to spit and
shriek at us. But others displayed the Union flag. These
people waved to us in encouragement, making "V" for vic
tory signs with their fingers. I realized that our being in that
small town of 38,000 had polarized the people into pro- and
anti-black, causing neighbor to hate neighbor. I wondered
how they all would fare after we left.
As the procession neared the center of town, we passed
the city hall and its flagpole. Beneath the stars and stripes
flew the state flag of Georgia with its stars and bars. The flag
that the Klansmen taunted us with was the same flag that
symbolized the state of Georgia, and, perforce, was the flag
of the police and National Guardsmen who protected us. I
shuddered, empathizing with generations of black men,
women and children whose safety had been in the hands of
police and judges with allegiance to that flag.
How the times had changed since Georgia police and Na
tional Guardsmen — all of them white and many of them
members of the Klan — had loosed their clubs, dogs and
water hoses on people like those with whom I was march
ing. Now, integrated, the troops faced outward, to shield us
from the Klan. And as we listened to the governor of Geor
gia speak from the steps of the county courthouse, he
referred to the Klan now as the "rabble rousers." The '60s
had ended. Though hatred was still in evidence all around
me, at least the legal authorities, marshaled at a cost to the
taxpayers of Georgia in excess of $400,000, were now firmly
entrenched on what one television network called "the
right side."
I went to Georgia because I wanted to put my body on the
line against the overt and covert racism in which I grew up
and amid which I still live. But I am not a saint. 1 am a

"recovering racist," like the alcoholic who can never again
take even one drink or the smoker who can never again take
even one smoke. Alcoholics who cease drinking call them
selves "recovering alcoholics," knowing that they will never
be an "ex-alcoholic." The best they can be is an alcoholic
who does not drink. So it is with racists.
If you were brought up in America before the civil rights
movement, the odds are that you are a racist, too. You prob
ably disagree with me. You would rather deny the problem,
like all alcoholics deny that they are alcoholics at first. You
are not a racist, I can hear you say to yourself. Then take this
litmus test — do you fear to be alone on a midnight street
more often when some kinds of people come toward you
than others? If you do then you are ascribing negative char
acteristics, evil culture and/or nature, to an entire class of
humanity. That is the definition of racism. But, you say, you
don't act on these prejudices? Good. Then you, like me, are
a "recovering racist," and we can ally ourselves for the bet
terment of humankind. Twenty thousand "recovering
racists" marched in Georgia on Jan. 24, with just that pur
pose.
But it was not only against those who shed all shame and
publicly proclaimed the perversion of their hateful spirit
that I marched. For, by now, they are a tiny minority whose
hands have been wrenched from the levers of power and in
fluence. Even though, as all Jews know, people of good will
must ever remain vigilant against such a dismissed cadre
being fanned into a conflagration of genocidal proportions,
overt racists are not the primary repository of bigotry in
America today.
I went to Georgia because I am fed up with all those
people, with whom I marched and voted in the '60s for
human progress, and who are otherwise so compassionate,
yet who are unashamed in private to slur just about anybody
but their own group. Civil rights? Absolutely, they will say.
But "those people are so ..they will go on. Somehow, in
admitting to themselves that they have a problem with
bigotry, they have become comfortable with it. The Jewish
tradition says that, the first time people sin, we feel sick
about it. The second time, we do not feel so bad. The third
time, we make the sin into a mitzvdh. And then we seek out
others whose similar sins make us feel comfortable. Such is
the path of any individual who sinks out of polite society, or
of the society that sinks below the level of human decency
and into the level of a lynch mob.
So, did this civil rights demonstration accomplish any
thing? Was it worth $400,000 in protection? Maybe it was.
Maybe one family watched the television coverage together,
and a child asked a parent what was going on. Then, just like
a Passover Haggadah, the discussion of liberation will have
begun with the simple question of a child.
