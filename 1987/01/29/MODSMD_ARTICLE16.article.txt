# Learning to understand gays better
## 
### 
I was bitching about my love life, or lack thereof,
as usual. It was one of those late-night conversations
that my close friends and I almost always get into
whenever we get together, and John is one of my
closest; we've known each other since high school. I
was in the midst of a typical crush over a woman I
had met at Terra's first-week beach party that year. I
told him about our frolicking in the surf and foam to
gether that day and how I couldn't bring myself to
touch her. God, I'm so shv sometimes. Anyway, the
conversation shifted to his love life and his problems;
lit' admitted to being a pretty lonely guy himself.
But he said, "you know what my problem is? I'm
gay.

Now, I m a pretty clueless guv when it comes to
such things, so it's probably not surprising that in all
the years I had known him that I had never
suspected, but what was surprising was the number
of people from my high school who are homosexual.
Seems like everyone in our class is either born
again or gay. he joked. If someone had asked me
before that night whether I knew anyone who was
gay, I would have said no. All of a sudden. I knew a
half dozen, two ot which —John included — I had
spent quite a bit of time with in high school.
That night John told me about the difficulties he
had had coming to terms with his sexual identity and
his comparatively recent decision to come out You
see, John i* Catholic, and so not only did he have to

deal with a society that tells him he is wrong, he had
to reconcile himself with a personal faith that holds
his most fundamental desires to be anathema. I was
amazed by the courage and compassion of a mutual
straight friend of ours who, when John came out to
him way back in high school, took John to a psychol
ogist in order to have someone with a degree of au
thority tell him that what he was feeling was not
wrong, and that, despite what the bigots and the
many ignorant people of our culture say,
homosexuality is neither abnormal or unnatural.
For me, the erosion of my prejudice against gays
began that night with the compassion I felt for what
my friend had been through. I had never realized just
how frustrating and lonely life for a gay in the closet
can be. He had had his share of crushes, but if you
think it's difficult to ask someone out as a hetero, can
you imagine what it's like not even to have that possi
bility? Ironically, at the time I had my first major
crush on a woman on my floor, in my junior year, I
had turned to John for support at the same time he
had a crush on his straight roommate. Mere I was, ex
pecting him to understand and know how to deal
with rejection when he himself had been rejected
with far more finality (and a surprising degree of un
derstanding. I might add) than I had. Me had given
me care and concern when he was facing an even
more difficult situation that I was. I had the option to
respond to this person with the condemnation that
my society and faith expected me to heap on those of
his kind, but this man was my friend and had shown
his concern for me even though he was facing a far
more difficult personal life than I It was clear that I
had to change my preconceptions about gays.
First off, gays don't go around corrupting non-gays.
This is a fact that was hard for me to come feel with
my bones, but love for gays, just like for all the rest of
us, does not work unless there is interest from both
people A few months after John came out he took

me to a predominantly gay Christmas party in
Westwood, and I doubt I've ever felt more uncom
fortable than I did at the beginning of that party. I
kept expecting someone to come over and try to pick
me up. We were building gingerbread houses, so I
threw myself into the work in the hope that if I was
busy enough, no one would want to bother me. To
my great surprise, no one showed any more interest
in me than anyone would have at a "normal" party.
Neither are gays godless or amoral. Granted, most
gays have an incentive to be atheists since they are
summarily rejected by virtually every supposed
Christian denomination in the country. But the fact is
that gays are people, and they worry too about what's
right and wrong and whether there's a God and so
on. In fact, homosexuals, because they have tried to
deal with being something that they have been
repeatedly told is wrong, have in general a more con
sidered faith than others
It's been a couple years since John came out to me,
and I can't honestly say that 1 have completely
overcome mv prejudice against gays. Going camping
with him this summer I found myself wishing that he
wouldn't act so gay sometimes. But the fact is that I
don't want him to change anymore, either; rather I
want to change myself, and I want society to change. I
don't think that we have done right by homosexuals
in our society.
John is my brother in Christ, and I love him as
such. I have a personal dream that someday his
church and his society will accept him as he is and
stop telling him that homosexuality is wrong. VChen
he finds Mr. Right. I want to see him married in a
church and have that marriage legitimized by the
state. Heck, I wouldn't mind being a member of the
wedding party — just don't call me a bridesmaid.
