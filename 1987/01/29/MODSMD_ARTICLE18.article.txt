Input crucial for
better Tresidder
I applaud the recent editorial about
Tresidder Union and its future (Daily,
Jan. 27). As a member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents and as someone
who is very involved in this issue, 1
must reiterate what The Daily said
about the future of Tresidder.
The departure of Union Director
Ellie Oppenheim has indeed opened
up an ideal opportunity for Stanford
administrators and students to
reassess the "mission" of Tresidder.
Should its focus be on commercial
services or on student office and
meeting space? Should there be addi
tions to the existing building, and if
so, what should they be? Should
Tresidder renovate the Coffee House
and The Store? The COP and the
Tresidder Union Board have been
discussing these issues for a long
time. Now it's time for the whole
Stanford community to get involved:
the Board of Trustees, administrators,
students, staff, etc.
It has been 25 years since Tresidder
was built, bn this time, it has become
an intricate part of the student experi
ence at Stanford (every student comes
to Tresidder at least once a day). It has
also served the needs of the surround
ing community with its food services,
store, programming, meeting space,
ticket counter and recreation center. It
is now time to show our appreciation
for this facility by helping to stir up
debate over the future of Tresidder.
Only through pressure will the Stan
ford administration see that Tresidder
is indeed an important pan of this
campus and therefore worthy of
money and renovation

A public policy issue that is climb
ing to the top of our nation's agenda
is the changing character of families in
America. The "Leave it to Beaver
family of past decades is no longer the
norm. It has been reeplaced by a
family that faces difficult challenges:
One out of four children in the
United Staes lives in a household
headed by one parent — usually the
mother. Fifty percent of all new mar
riages are expected to fail. Currently,
half of all mothers are working. These
statistics tell only part of the story
regarding the emergence of non
traditional families and their role in
society.
Many people feel that family matters
are a personal concern and that the
government should not intrude in
issues of the family. But it is important
to recognize the role our government
plays in these social issues. By deter
mining economic, housing, health and
education policies, legislators directly
affect the welfare of families.
Therefore, it is crucial for us to be
aware of these policies and to under
stand their consequences. With a
better understanding of the changes
that families are undergoing and the
impact of government policies, we
will be better prepared to ease the
hardships and realize the opportuni
ties of non-traditional family lifestyles.
The changes in the landscapes of
American families, some dramatic and
others subtle, will have tremendous
impact on our future. It is for this
reason that this year's You Can Make a

Difference conference will address
"Families in Transition." How we as
individuals and as a society respond to
these changes will demonstrate our
true measure and commitment to
future generations. In preparing for
this conference, we have discovered
that issues concerning families are
shrouded by myths, prejudices and
genuine frustrations. We have learned
that many programs designed to help
are not effective. And yet, we were
also gratified to see that many others
do work. In this conference, we will
explore how we can translate our
concern and compassion into con
structive change in our individual and
political lives.
The Stanford Public Service Cen
ter's fourth annual You Can Make a
Difference conference will be held
Saturday in Memorial Auditorium
from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The con
ference will bring experts from
around the country to examine the
impact of changing families on our
society and identify the opportunities
that those problems have created.
From the morning panel to the after
noon workshops, the conference aims
to challenge us to make a difference
and evoke the spirit and commitment
necessary to become involved.in
relieving family hardships.
Over 75 undergraduates, graduates,
faculty and staff have worked together
to organize the conference. Some 30
campus organizations, departments
and dorms have supported our efforts.
On behalf of the entire committee, we
hope that you will come join us on
Jan. 31 for what promises to be a
challenging, informative and inspira
tional day.

others subtle, will have tremendous
impact on our future. It is for this
reason that this year's You Can Make a

Difference conference will address
"Families in Transition." How we as
individuals and as a society respond to
these changes will demonstrate our
true measure and commitment to
future generations. In preparing for
this conference, we have discovered
that issues concerning families are
shrouded by myths, prejudices and
genuine frustrations. We have learned
that many programs designed to help
are not effective. And yet, we were
also gratified to see that many others
do work. In this conference, we will
explore how we can translate our
concern and compassion into con
structive change in our individual and
political lives.
The Stanford Public Service Cen
ter's fourth annual You Can Make a
Difference conference will be held
Saturday in Memorial Auditorium
from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The con
ference will bring experts from
around the country to examine the
impact of changing families on our
society and identify the opportunities
that those problems have created.
From the morning panel to the after
noon workshops, the conference aims
to challenge us to make a difference
and evoke the spirit and commitment
necessary to become involved.in
relieving family hardships.
Over 75 undergraduates, graduates,
faculty and staff have worked together
to organize the conference. Some 30
campus organizations, departments
and dorms have supported our efforts.
On behalf of the entire committee, we
hope that you will come join us on
Jan. 31 for what promises to be a
challenging, informative and inspira
tional day.

Input crucial for
better Tresidder
I applaud the recent editorial about
Tresidder Union and its future (Daily,
Jan. 27). As a member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents and as someone
who is very involved in this issue, 1
must reiterate what The Daily said
about the future of Tresidder.
The departure of Union Director
Ellie Oppenheim has indeed opened
up an ideal opportunity for Stanford
administrators and students to
reassess the "mission" of Tresidder.
Should its focus be on commercial
services or on student office and
meeting space? Should there be addi
tions to the existing building, and if
so, what should they be? Should
Tresidder renovate the Coffee House
and The Store? The COP and the
Tresidder Union Board have been
discussing these issues for a long
time. Now it's time for the whole
Stanford community to get involved:
the Board of Trustees, administrators,
students, staff, etc.
It has been 25 years since Tresidder
was built, bn this time, it has become
an intricate part of the student experi
ence at Stanford (every student comes
to Tresidder at least once a day). It has
also served the needs of the surround
ing community with its food services,
store, programming, meeting space,
ticket counter and recreation center. It
is now time to show our appreciation
for this facility by helping to stir up
debate over the future of Tresidder.
Only through pressure will the Stan
ford administration see that Tresidder
is indeed an important pan of this
campus and therefore worthy of
money and renovation
If you are interested in joining this

fight, come by and see Mary or Carey
at the ASSU. We're in the COP office.

make a difference
A public policy issue that is climb
ing to the top of our nation's agenda
is the changing character of families in
America. The "Leave it to Beaver
family of past decades is no longer the
norm. It has been reeplaced by a
family that faces difficult challenges:
One out of four children in the
United Staes lives in a household
headed by one parent — usually the
mother. Fifty percent of all new mar
riages are expected to fail. Currently,
half of all mothers are working. These
statistics tell only part of the story
regarding the emergence of non
traditional families and their role in
society.
Many people feel that family matters
are a personal concern and that the
government should not intrude in
issues of the family. But it is important
to recognize the role our government
plays in these social issues. By deter
mining economic, housing, health and
education policies, legislators directly
affect the welfare of families.
Therefore, it is crucial for us to be
aware of these policies and to under
stand their consequences. With a
better understanding of the changes
that families are undergoing and the
impact of government policies, we
will be better prepared to ease the
hardships and realize the opportuni
ties of non-traditional family lifestyles.
