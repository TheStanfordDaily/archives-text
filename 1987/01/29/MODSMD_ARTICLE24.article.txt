## Local high school finds itself under the gun 
### ELIZABETH HENDRICKS 
Although Palo Alto High School and
the Paly girl are well known to Stan
ford students, Gunn High School, less
than five miles off campus, is virtually
unknown.
Now it seems as if Gunn could disap
pear much as it has existed: without
creating a stir. As a result of financial
problems and decreasing student en
rollment, the Palo Alto Unified School
District will only be able to support
one high school. Superintendent Julian
Crocker has recommended that Gunn
be converted into a middle school,
with Paly accomodating 10-12 th grade
students currently enrolled at both
schools.
Since these two schools have been

evaluated as equal in most respects,
why was Paly recommended over
Gunn?
Gunn is not as picturesque as Paly â€”
one of the reasons given by the school
district for Gunn's being chosen as a
more appropriate middle school.
Another, perhaps more important,
reason is that Paly holds the political
influence in this community.
"You're going to have to step on toes
either way," remarked Gunn's Asst.
Principal Dan Sarouhan. "Gunn is the
newer school. Paly has the tradition."
The merger has been expected and
the community has accepted the plan
without protest so far. Potential
protesters have had the opportunity to
attend board meetings, but there has
been no significant dissent.

Tim Farrell, who has taught English
and journalism at Gunn for 23 years,
reasoned that the lack of dissent was
because the politics involved are
"politics that don't really matter, fi
nally.
"You can't fight the tides," he added.
Teachers and students, however, are
sentimental about their attachments to
Gunn.
Farrell, dressed in a red sweater
with "Gunn"' emblazoned over his
chest, anticipated difficulties in joining
the faculties of two schools with in
herent "philosophical differences."
His main concern is the timing of
the conversion. Although originally
projected for 1990, the switch could
occur as early as 1988.
Saying that he spoke for the staff,

Farrell pointed out some benefits of a
quick change: The decision is finan
cially advantageous; therefore, the
quicker it is implemented, the better.
In addition, he said "we are all of us
worried about this lame duck kind of
thing," a tendency to hold off on crea
tive, new projects when a change in the
system is imminent.
This reasoning seems to advocate a
quick change, though Farrell ack
nowledges that the students' wishes
need to be considered.
"It's awful, upsetting, annoying,"
remarked Olga Dunlop, a Gunn soph
omore, who is concerned over the
prospect of spending her senior year at
Paly. "You spend your life at a school,
and then, wham, you'd feel like a fresh
man all over again in a sense."
She disagreed with the idea of a
three-year high school. "The ninth

graders are being cheated," she said.
"They'll have no chance to screw up, to
make mistakes."
Dunlop said she thought ninth
graders would lose out academically
since higher level courses, such as ad
vanced language classes, would not be
available in a middle school setting.
"With one high sch(X)l in Palo Alto,'
added Manfred Yu, a Stanford fresh
man who graduated from Gunn, "it
will be a monopoly, like AT&T."
Yu said a four-year high school is
better preparation for students going
on to college. He said he was
"bummed at the loss of his alma
mater, but he said he believed that the
system will switch back again. Citing an
increase in kindergarten and first
grade enrollments, Yu was confident
that Gunn will have its chance as a high
school again some day.
