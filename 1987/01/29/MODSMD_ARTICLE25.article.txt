## Card hopes to slow down OSU, Ortiz 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
It is always difficult to win on the
road in Pacific 10 Conference basket
ball, but it is even harder in the second
half of the league schedule after three
straight games away from home.
That is exactly the position that the
Stanford men's basketball team finds it
self in as it goes into tonight's matchup
against Oregon State at Gill Coliseum
at 7. Halfway through the Pac-10
season, the Cardinal has seen every
conference opponent and holds a 5-4
record in league play, good for fifth
place. Stanford is 11-7 overall and has
won 10 of its last 15 games.
Oregon State is in an even better po
sition. The Beavers are tied for second
place in the Pac-10 with California at 6-
3, just behind UCLA, which leads the
conference with a 6-2 mark. OSU
boasts the best overall record in the
league (13-4) and is coming off wins
over Washington State (66-48) and
Washington (71-50).
The main challenge for Stanford
tonight will be stopping center Jose
Ortiz, an All-Pac-10 player last year
who is leading the Beaver squad in
scoring this season with 23.4 points
per game. The 6-foot-10 senior also
tops the team in rebounds with 8.1 per
game.
Ortiz, a native of Puerto Rico, has
been playing especially well recently.
"He had probably the best game of the
year against Washington last week,"
Oregon State Asst. Coach Jim Anderson
said. "He scored well, he rebounded
well, he had three or four blocked
shots, and he played good all-around
defense. He's at the top of his game
right now.''
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery
says he is well aware of the problems
diat Ortiz poses. When asked how best
to stop the OSU center, Montgomery
replied, "with a net." The last time the
two teams met — a 70-66 Beaver win
Dec. 23 at Maples Pavilion — Ortiz
scored 21 points.
"Jose Ortiz is a very good player,
Montgomery said. "He's by no means
the only player they have, but he's the
focal point in their offense. When it
gets down to the end, he's the man
they go to. He's got great experience;

he's an international player.
"We have to locate him and mini
mize the number of times he has the
ball," Montgomery added.
"Defensively we have to locate him,"
Stanford guard Novian Whitsitt said,
"because he's averaging 23 points a
game. He's where they go when they
need a basket."
Ortiz is not a one-man team,
however. Freshman point guard Gary
Payton is averaging 12 points per game
and adds 8.3 assists a game.
"Payton is playing extremely well for
them," Montgomery said. "As much as
they go to Ortiz, Payton is the key to
the Oregon State basketball team. He
runs the offense, he's a good ball
handler, he's very capable of scoring
and rebounding, he plays good
defense — he's a really good fresh
man."
Anderson underscored Payton's im
portance for the Beaver squad. "He's
just a freshman, but he has excellent
ballhandling skills. He sets the offense
for us, he handles the fast break, and
any pressure that gets thrown against
us, he's responsible for breaking. He's
responded really well — especially as
a freshman."
The Oregon State team is, as a
whole, on the young side, with two
other freshmen, forwards Earl Martin
and Joe Harge, in the starting lineup
along with Payton. Sophomore Eric
Knox (11.5 points per game) rounds
out the starting five at the shooting
guard spot.
According to Anderson, the team's
youth has not been a disadvantage this
season. "We're a young team — that's
really one of our strengths," he said.
"Now that they 're starting to get more
experience ... they've molded into a
good team this season."
"They have a good basketball team,"
Montgomery said. "It's amazing how
Coach (Ralph) Miller can bring in as
many new players and do what he did,
mix them together so well."
OSU also has the benefit of the
home court — where the Beavers are
7-1 this year. "Any team in the confer
ence certainly would like to be playing
at home at this point in the season,"
Anderson said. "It's definitely an ad
vantage But any team in the confer
ence is capable of beating any other

team, as ASU showed against Cal last
week (in the Sun Devils' 61-53 upset),
so we aren't taking any opponents
lightly.
"The fact we're playing at home is a
plus, but it's only a plus if we can do
something about it,"he added.
Stanford, meanwhile, hopes to make
the most of its weekend in Oregon,
despite the disadvantages. "We'll have
to give them a good solid game and do
what it takes to win on the road," Whit

sitt said. "It's hard to win on the road
because of the fans and you don't get
the calls you would at home."
"We'll go up to Oregon and do the
best we can," junior center Eric
Reveno said. "A sweep would be fun.
Card notes
Just as the Cardinal will be con
centrating on OSU's Ortiz, the Beavers
will be attempting to hold Stanford's

Todd Lichti in check. In OSU's win at
Maples earlier this year, Lichti led all
scorers with 22 points and had a game
high seven rebounds. The sophomore
forward is averaging 18.1 points per
game to lead the Cardinal and has
averaged 20.6 points and 7.2 rebounds
per game in his last five games.
Stanford is also 7-1 at home this
season — with its only loss coming to
the Beavers on Dec. 23. OSU and
Oregon are also 7-1 on their own

courts, while California is 10-1 at Har
mon Arena and UCLA is a perfect 10-0
at Pauley Pavilion. This is a fairly good
indication of the importance of home
court advantage — UCLA leads the Pac
-10, while Cal and OSU are in second.

Gill Coliseum 56-52, for the first Card

ing a 10-game losing streak in Corval

Ortiz is fourth in the Pac-10 in
scoring (20.7 ppg), followed by Lichti
in fifth (19 8). Lichti is the only player
in the Pac-10 to rank among the top 10
in the league in all three shooting per
centages: field goal percentage (.514
— seventh), three-point field goal

percentage (.500 — third) and free
throw percentage (.824 — third).
Stanford guard Terry Taylor leads
the Pac-10 in assist-to-tu mover ratio;
with 95 assists and 31 turnovers, Taylor
has a 3 06 ratio. Taylor is still shooting
better from three-point range (.512)
than he is overall (.478).
Stanford leads the Pac-10 in field
goal percentage (.459) and is 9-0 when
ahead at halftime this season. The
Cardinal is 9-4 when its bench out
scores its counterpart.

That is exactly the position that the
Stanford men's basketball team finds it
self in as it goes into tonight's matchup
against Oregon State at Gill Coliseum
at 7. Halfway through the Pac-10
season, the Cardinal has seen every
conference opponent and holds a 5-4
record in league play, good for fifth
place. Stanford is 11-7 overall and has
won 10 of its last 15 games.
Oregon State is in an even better po
sition. The Beavers are tied for second
place in the Pac-10 with California at 6-
3, just behind UCLA, which leads the
conference with a 6-2 mark. OSU
boasts the best overall record in the
league (13-4) and is coming off wins
over Washington State (66-48) and
Washington (71-50).
The main challenge for Stanford
tonight will be stopping center Jose
Ortiz, an All-Pac-10 player last year
who is leading the Beaver squad in
scoring this season with 23.4 points
per game. The 6-foot-10 senior also
tops the team in rebounds with 8.1 per
game.
Ortiz, a native of Puerto Rico, has
been playing especially well recently.
"He had probably the best game of the
year against Washington last week,"
Oregon State Asst. Coach Jim Anderson
said. "He scored well, he rebounded
well, he had three or four blocked
shots, and he played good all-around
defense. He's at the top of his game
right now.''
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery
says he is well aware of the problems
diat Ortiz poses. When asked how best
to stop the OSU center, Montgomery
replied, "with a net." The last time the
two teams met — a 70-66 Beaver win
Dec. 23 at Maples Pavilion — Ortiz
scored 21 points.
"Jose Ortiz is a very good player,
Montgomery said. "He's by no means
the only player they have, but he's the
focal point in their offense. When it
gets down to the end, he's the man
they go to. He's got great experience;

he's an international player.
"We have to locate him and mini
mize the number of times he has the
ball," Montgomery added.
"Defensively we have to locate him,"
Stanford guard Novian Whitsitt said,
"because he's averaging 23 points a
game. He's where they go when they
need a basket."
Ortiz is not a one-man team,
however. Freshman point guard Gary
Payton is averaging 12 points per game
and adds 8.3 assists a game.
"Payton is playing extremely well for
them," Montgomery said. "As much as
they go to Ortiz, Payton is the key to
the Oregon State basketball team. He
runs the offense, he's a good ball
handler, he's very capable of scoring
and rebounding, he plays good
defense — he's a really good fresh
man."
Anderson underscored Payton's im
portance for the Beaver squad. "He's
just a freshman, but he has excellent
ballhandling skills. He sets the offense
for us, he handles the fast break, and
any pressure that gets thrown against
us, he's responsible for breaking. He's
responded really well — especially as
a freshman."
The Oregon State team is, as a
whole, on the young side, with two
other freshmen, forwards Earl Martin
and Joe Harge, in the starting lineup
along with Payton. Sophomore Eric
Knox (11.5 points per game) rounds
out the starting five at the shooting
guard spot.
According to Anderson, the team's
youth has not been a disadvantage this
season. "We're a young team — that's
really one of our strengths," he said.
"Now that they 're starting to get more
experience ... they've molded into a
good team this season."
"They have a good basketball team,"
Montgomery said. "It's amazing how
Coach (Ralph) Miller can bring in as
many new players and do what he did,
mix them together so well."
OSU also has the benefit of the
home court — where the Beavers are
7-1 this year. "Any team in the confer
ence certainly would like to be playing
at home at this point in the season,"
Anderson said. "It's definitely an ad
vantage But any team in the confer
ence is capable of beating any other

team, as ASU showed against Cal last
week (in the Sun Devils' 61-53 upset),
so we aren't taking any opponents
lightly.
"The fact we're playing at home is a
plus, but it's only a plus if we can do
something about it,"he added.
Stanford, meanwhile, hopes to make
the most of its weekend in Oregon,
despite the disadvantages. "We'll have
to give them a good solid game and do
what it takes to win on the road," Whit

sitt said. "It's hard to win on the road
because of the fans and you don't get
the calls you would at home."
"We'll go up to Oregon and do the
best we can," junior center Eric
Reveno said. "A sweep would be fun.
Card notes
Just as the Cardinal will be con
centrating on OSU's Ortiz, the Beavers
will be attempting to hold Stanford's

Todd Lichti in check. In OSU's win at
Maples earlier this year, Lichti led all
scorers with 22 points and had a game
high seven rebounds. The sophomore
forward is averaging 18.1 points per
game to lead the Cardinal and has
averaged 20.6 points and 7.2 rebounds
per game in his last five games.
Stanford is also 7-1 at home this
season — with its only loss coming to
the Beavers on Dec. 23. OSU and
Oregon are also 7-1 on their own

courts, while California is 10-1 at Har
mon Arena and UCLA is a perfect 10-0
at Pauley Pavilion. This is a fairly good
indication of the importance of home
court advantage — UCLA leads the Pac
-10, while Cal and OSU are in second.

Stanford guard Terry Taylor leads
the Pac-10 in assist-to-tu mover ratio;

better from three-point range (.512)

conference opponent and holds a 5-4
record in league play, good for fifth
place. Stanford is 11-7 overall and has
won 10 of its last 15 games.
Oregon State is in an even better po
sition. The Beavers are tied for second
place in the Pac-10 with California at 6-
3, just behind UCLA, which leads the
conference with a 6-2 mark. OSU
boasts the best overall record in the
league (13-4) and is coming off wins
over Washington State (66-48) and
Washington (71-50).
The main challenge for Stanford
tonight will be stopping center Jose
Ortiz, an All-Pac-10 player last year
who is leading the Beaver squad in
scoring this season with 23.4 points
per game. The 6-foot-10 senior also
tops the team in rebounds with 8.1 per
game.
Ortiz, a native of Puerto Rico, has
been playing especially well recently.
"He had probably the best game of the
year against Washington last week,"
Oregon State Asst. Coach Jim Anderson
said. "He scored well, he rebounded
well, he had three or four blocked
shots, and he played good all-around
defense. He's at the top of his game
right now.''
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery
says he is well aware of the problems
diat Ortiz poses. When asked how best
to stop the OSU center, Montgomery
replied, "with a net." The last time the
two teams met — a 70-66 Beaver win
Dec. 23 at Maples Pavilion — Ortiz
scored 21 points.
"Jose Ortiz is a very good player,
Montgomery said. "He's by no means
the only player they have, but he's the
focal point in their offense. When it
gets down to the end, he's the man
they go to. He's got great experience;

he's an international player.
"We have to locate him and mini
mize the number of times he has the
ball," Montgomery added.
"Defensively we have to locate him,"
Stanford guard Novian Whitsitt said,
"because he's averaging 23 points a
game. He's where they go when they
need a basket."
Ortiz is not a one-man team,
however. Freshman point guard Gary
Payton is averaging 12 points per game
and adds 8.3 assists a game.
"Payton is playing extremely well for
them," Montgomery said. "As much as
they go to Ortiz, Payton is the key to
the Oregon State basketball team. He
runs the offense, he's a good ball
handler, he's very capable of scoring
and rebounding, he plays good
defense — he's a really good fresh
man."
Anderson underscored Payton's im
portance for the Beaver squad. "He's
just a freshman, but he has excellent
ballhandling skills. He sets the offense
for us, he handles the fast break, and
any pressure that gets thrown against
us, he's responsible for breaking. He's
responded really well — especially as
a freshman."
The Oregon State team is, as a
whole, on the young side, with two
other freshmen, forwards Earl Martin
and Joe Harge, in the starting lineup
along with Payton. Sophomore Eric
Knox (11.5 points per game) rounds
out the starting five at the shooting
guard spot.
According to Anderson, the team's
youth has not been a disadvantage this
season. "We're a young team — that's
really one of our strengths," he said.
"Now that they 're starting to get more
experience ... they've molded into a
good team this season."
"They have a good basketball team,"
Montgomery said. "It's amazing how
Coach (Ralph) Miller can bring in as
many new players and do what he did,
mix them together so well."
OSU also has the benefit of the
home court — where the Beavers are
7-1 this year. "Any team in the confer
ence certainly would like to be playing
at home at this point in the season,"
Anderson said. "It's definitely an ad
vantage But any team in the confer
ence is capable of beating any other

team, as ASU showed against Cal last
week (in the Sun Devils' 61-53 upset),
so we aren't taking any opponents
lightly.
"The fact we're playing at home is a
plus, but it's only a plus if we can do
something about it,"he added.
Stanford, meanwhile, hopes to make
the most of its weekend in Oregon,
despite the disadvantages. "We'll have
to give them a good solid game and do
what it takes to win on the road," Whit

sitt said. "It's hard to win on the road
because of the fans and you don't get
the calls you would at home."
"We'll go up to Oregon and do the
best we can," junior center Eric
Reveno said. "A sweep would be fun.
Card notes
Just as the Cardinal will be con
centrating on OSU's Ortiz, the Beavers
will be attempting to hold Stanford's

Todd Lichti in check. In OSU's win at
Maples earlier this year, Lichti led all
scorers with 22 points and had a game
high seven rebounds. The sophomore
forward is averaging 18.1 points per
game to lead the Cardinal and has
averaged 20.6 points and 7.2 rebounds
per game in his last five games.
Stanford is also 7-1 at home this
season — with its only loss coming to
the Beavers on Dec. 23. OSU and
Oregon are also 7-1 on their own

courts, while California is 10-1 at Har
mon Arena and UCLA is a perfect 10-0
at Pauley Pavilion. This is a fairly good
indication of the importance of home
court advantage — UCLA leads the Pac
-10, while Cal and OSU are in second.

ing a 10-game losing streak in Corval
lis.
Ortiz is fourth in the Pac-10 in
scoring (20.7 ppg), followed by Lichti
in fifth (19 8). Lichti is the only player
in the Pac-10 to rank among the top 10
in the league in all three shooting per
centages: field goal percentage (.514
— seventh), three-point field goal

percentage (.500 — third) and free
throw percentage (.824 — third).
Stanford guard Terry Taylor leads
the Pac-10 in assist-to-tu mover ratio;
with 95 assists and 31 turnovers, Taylor
has a 3 06 ratio. Taylor is still shooting
better from three-point range (.512)
than he is overall (.478).
Stanford leads the Pac-10 in field
goal percentage (.459) and is 9-0 when
ahead at halftime this season. The
Cardinal is 9-4 when its bench out
scores its counterpart.
