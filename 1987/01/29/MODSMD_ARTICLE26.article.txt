# Bulldogs chew up Stanford wrestlers

### FAITH PERRY 
The fact that Stanford forfeited at 118
pounds last night made no significant
difference in its match against Fresno
State at Maples Pavilion. The Bulldogs
trounced the Cardinal 35-9.
What did make a difference was that
almost all of Fresno State's wrestlers
have more collegiate wrestling experi
ence than their Stanford opponents.
And, according to Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel, experience is extremely
important.
"We're a young team with a lot of
heart," Horpel said. "And it takes
forever to learn good wrestling."
Horpel likens learning to wrestle to
learning Russian. "The moves in wres
tling take time to learn, just like it
would take time to learn words, then
phrases and then sentences in Russian.
Right now, these guys know phrases,"
lie said of his team.
If the Fresno State team were
compared to a class of Russian stu
dents, they would be said to be speak
ing fluently. The Bulldogs have four
seniors, four juniors, one sophomore
and one freshman on their team,
whereas the Cardinal has two seniors,
two juniors and five freshmen. While it
would be incorrect to suggest that ex
perience is the only deciding factor in
a match, its importance is clear; in all
but one match, the wrestler with more
collegiate experience won.
Freshman Josh Lisle (126 pounds)
was the first Cardinal to tall prey to an

older opponent. Lisle lost 17-5 to
Fresno State junior Mike Armistead.
Stanford freshman Brian Veit (134
pounds) was the second wrestler to
lose to an upperclassman. Veit was
defeated 11-3 by Bulldog senior Dan
Thomas.
Geoff Baum (142 pounds) was an
other Cardinal freshman who was
forced to face a more experienced
wrestler. Baum lost to former-PCAA
champion Alon/.o Harris, 18-6. Baum
showed a lot of promise in his match,
particularly in the first period, and
made his Bulldog opponent work ex
tremely hard for his victory.
Stanford senior Scott Wiggen (150
pounds) was the winner of his match
against freshman Fred Hunzinger. Wig
gen's 9-2 victors 1 came as no surprise to
Fresno State Coach Dennis Deliddo. "I
thought coming in here that Wiggen
would take the match, and I was
proven right,'' Deliddo said.
However, Deliddo did add that he
thought Hunzinger did a better job
against Wiggen than he had expected.
A controversial call by the referee
may have psychologically impeded
freshman Steve Yarbrough's progress
in his 158-pound match against Bull
dog senior Chris Salisbury. According
to Horpel, "Yarbrough was holding
down Salisbury, and was about to
score, when the referee called
stalemate.
