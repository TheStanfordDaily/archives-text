## Spikers host talented UCSB 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
After watching the strong UC-Santa Barbara men's volley
hall team finish in second place at last weekend's
UCSB/Miehelob Light Collegiate Invitational, Stanford
knows it will face a challenge tonight as the Cardinal hosts
the Gauchos at " 7 :30 at Maples Pavilion.
This interesting ' match, as Stanford Coach Fred Sturm
put it, will be the Cardinal's first league match in the newly
formed Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Association,
which includes among its members several of the nation's
highest ranked teams.
lICSB will be a tough first match for the less experienced
Stanford team, which is made up of six returning and six
new players. With several of last year s players back this
season, the Gauchos have the advantage of an established
team, though they do have a new setter. We will have our
hands full this weekend UCSB is in great shape in the
league, Stanford Asst Coach Ruben Nieves said.
"(UCSB) is very consistent. They work together very well
as a team," Sturm said.
This team unit\ will be the Gauchos' strength tonight and
throughout the season. The\ were clearly one of the most
consistent teams at the invitational.' said Sturm, who was

able to watch nine of the 12 WTVA teams at the UCSB tourna
ment.
The Cardinal will approach the match as a learning exper
ience. UCSB "is further along than us in its starting lineup,
in its cohesiveness and in its sophistication of blocking and
defense," said Nieves, who played volleyball for the Card
inal during the 1980-81 season
It will be interesting to see how they play us We will
learn by seeing how they play, and we will get a sense of
how our team is doing,' Sturm said.
This season, Sturm will be approaching all matches as
learning experiences. "You can see a lot during practices,
but you always learn from the matches. Your most danger
ous weakness is the one you don't know about â€” the one
the opposing team uncovers during a match," he said.
1 nlike the Gauchos, the Cardinal's strength does not lie
in the experience of a returning starting lineup. Rather,
Stanford's depth is its main attribute. "VC'e have 12 strong
players that we can use at any time," Sturm said.
This depth, Sturm believes, will take some of the burden
off the players on the court
In practice, the team has been working hard on the basics
of serving, blocking and hitting, which Nieves hopes will
help the team. The things we're doing we're doing well.
Vie will start there and then build upon that It will be a
season of improvement, he said

It will take an all-out performance tonight from Scott Fortune and the rest of the Stanford men's volleyball team if
the Cardinal expects to heat highly ranked UCSB at Maples Pavilion.
