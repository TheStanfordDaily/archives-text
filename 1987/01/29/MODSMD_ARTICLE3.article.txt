# New research policy more flexible

Despite fears of censorship expressed by
sortie professors, a 90-day review period for
endowed research has received the support
of the faculty Committee on Research (CRES).
The review period, commonly used by de
partments in the past, only recently became
an official part of the University's research
p< >licy.
According to Stanford Medical School Dean
David Korn, the period will ensure patent
protection for inventions and give sponsors
the opportunity to comment on research fin
dings. Korn is the head of the committee.

"There are very specific circumstances un
der which a sponsor has the right to review
the results before publication â€” for example,
experiments involving human subjects where
the sponsor would not like the identity dis
closed," said Korn.
He also said that universities usualh let
sponsors review the results of research so
they can decide whether they want to be asso
ciated with the findings. Korn stressed,
however, that sponsors may not censor or
suppress results from the studies.
"There is no danger that the publication
will be suppressed. The sponsor can say 'We
believe what you said was incorrect,' but it
would still be up to the faculty member to

publish, said Civil Engineering Prof. Robert
Street, vice provost and dean of research.
The Faculty Senate requested last year that
CRKS clarify its stance on the commonly used
90-day period.
"If you read the guidelines such as they
have existed, there was a very strong principle
of openness," said Korn. "Nobody wants to
mess around with guidelines, it's sort of like
messing around with the Constitution.
"It made what was a common practice part
of the guidelines," said Korn. Street added
that the change had been "asked for by
various sponsors."
