The cool, light colors, shades and
fans mollify had moods even before
the flowery hops of the Singha beer.
We especially liked the incon
spicuously dispersed antique furniture
and the levalors that blind a blank wall.
We liked the attentive waiters and the
wide-eyed, can t-do-enough-for-Ihe-
patrons owner. But the important thing
is the food.
We ordered the crab and white
asparagus soup with trepidation
brought on by unpleasant, past experi
ences with said soup. Our fears were
dispelled when at once we saw that
our white plastic ladles did not stand
up in the glutinous substance. The
taste was not more bland than subtle;
we found the crab and actually tasted

the shv asparagus. Cilantro and pepper
punctuate the warm egg-flower
smoothness.
The pillow-shaped spring rolls are
wrapped in thin, crunchy, golden, rich
paper. They are filled with spiced pork
and a melange of tastably fresh
vegetables. Taken with a visibly fresh
leaf of butter lettuce, these rolls are a
favorite among frequent patrons.
Saturated in a richly tasteful oil, the
barbecued beef wrapped in
grapeleaves has a distinctly strong ex
otic flavor. The leaf has a sour bite that
is mellowed by the oil and challenged
by the powerful meat.
Earthpot rice is cooked and served
in a wide handmade ceramic vessel
and portioned out in mounds with a
stunted paddle. This butter-moistened
dish is more than a staple, almost an
entree. The shreds of chicken and
slivers of seaweed and cilantro lift it
beyond mere rice. This dish was the
wholesome center of our meal.
Pork in peanut-coconut sauce is
sweet and a little bit spicy. The meat is
light and mild and slightly moist It was

cooked in an up-front peanut sauce,
hut dipped into a devious coconut
sauce combining for a full, warm,
macho taste.
The chicken with lemon grass was
more sweet than spicy and had an un
fortunate essence of apple jacks in
warm milk. This and most of the rea
sonably priced entrees come for about
and five and a half dollars.
For the closing segment of the meal,
the happy waiter brought out tall
glasses crowned with a silver brewing
mechanism from which dripped thick
black coffee onto a layer of cream
colored evaporated milk. \X'e stared ap
preciatively at the complexity of it all
until the owner removed the mecha
nism and blended the layers of black
and cream into a rich, sweet, jolting
syrup.
Continuing our sweet progression,
we received boats of custard, swim
ming in creme caramel, topped with
whipped cream and garnished with
fresh mint leaves. This last dish
reminds one of the French coloniza

tion of Vietnam and helps to distin
guish Vietnamese from other Oriental
cuisines.
Only at the end of the meal is
jasmine tea served, we were told, to aid
digestion by absorbing the meal's

culinary transcendentalism.
Having entered after a long day of
lost keys and harsh cops, we found our
hunger for Eastern culinary transcen
dentalism successfully sated by our
hosts.
