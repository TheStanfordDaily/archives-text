# Speaker tells of Peru's crisis
## 
### DAVID LIPPEATT 
Overpowering, daily violence for the past
six years has left much of the population of
Peru demoralized, fearful and helpless, ac
cording to Cynthia Sanborn, a visiting political
science doctoral candidate, who spoke at the
Bechtel International Center.
Sanborn, who spent two years in Peru
studying the national labor movement and
democratization process, described the
Peruvian peasantry as "caught between two
fires â€” the military and an armed guerrilla
movement."
Since the Peruvian military handed over
power to a freely elected civilian government
in 1980, a leftist group called Sendero
Luninoso ("Shining Path") has fought an un
declared war against the government, which
has resulted in the deaths of more than 8,000
people, she said.
Most of the victims have been "innocent
peasants' who were caught between the in
surgency and an "indiscriminately repressive"
military counterinsurgency program, Sanborn
said.
A Peruvian historical legacy of Inequity,
poverty, racism and violence contributed to
the rise of Shining Path, Sanborn explained.
Shining Path began in 1962 in the province of
Ayacucho, the poorest part of Peru, where
most peasants own little or no land. It was
originally a student movement focused
around a professor who taught at a local uni
versity.
The group broke in 1970 from the Peruvian

Communist Party and the rest of the left-wing
political groups permitted by the government
and became increasingly militant a few years
later when Peru entered a severe economic
decline. NXTien an anti-reformist administra
tion assumed power in 1980, Shining Path
turned to violence, Sanborn said.

'Fear, intimidation,
arbitrary arrest,
executions' were
common tactics.

Between 1980 and 1982 the group in
creased its activity in the Ayacucho area and
attempted for the first time to generate mass
support, she continued. Alarmed by this, the
new government declared a state of emer
gency in the region in December 1982 and
sent in troops, she said.
Sanborn characterized the military's strat
egy as "fighting terror with greater terror."
Troops in Ayacucho acted as an occupying
force, separating themselves from the
peasants and treating them all as potential ter
rorists, she explained.
"Fear, intimidation, arbitrary arrest, sys
tematic torture and mass executions" were
common military tactics, Sanborn said. "Over
1,600 people simply disappeared' and are
still missing," she added.
By 1984 Shining Path had lost a good deal

of peasant support in Avacucho, but had ex
panded its activities into other provinces, ac
cording to Sanborn. In response the military
continued its repression, often forcing vil
lagers to form "civil defense units," which
were then sent against Shining Path as
"cannon fodder, Sanborn continued.
As an example of "military excesses," she
described how, on election day in November
1983 in the provincial town of Socos, mem
bers of a branch of the police got drunk at a
wedding party and began to argue with some
of the guests. The officers then took 34 of the
peasants outside and shot them, Sanborn said.
In many areas, Shining Path would return
to villages after military- sweeps and punish
peasants for collaborating with the army, San
born explained. "The peasants were essen
tially forced to choose which side they would
fight on, and would die on," she said.
The insurgency now has been brought un
der control in Avacucho, Sanborn said.
Shining Path remains active elsewhere,
though, and has a growing political voice in
Lima, the Peruvian capital, she added.
The military strategy of terror and resulting
spiral of violence in Peru continues, but the
administration of Alain Garcia, elected in
1985, has a chance to change this, Sanborn
said. The government should "steal Sendero's
fire" by instituting reforms and should con
tinue to offer dialogue with the rebels, she
added.
Only through a switch from a military to a
political approach is there hope that the cycle
of violence in Peru will end, she concluded.
