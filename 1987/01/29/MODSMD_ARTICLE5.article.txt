# Row sets conditions for evicted students
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
In response to a Jan. 15 disturbance on the
Row, the University yesterday sent letters to four
Hurlburt residents outlining conditions they must
meet to continue living in University housing, ac
cording to Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Diana
Conklin.
To remain in Hurlburt, the four students must
apologize to fellow Hurlburt residents, work to
develop conduct guidelines with other members
of the house, promise not to repeat their dis
ruptive behavior and share the cost of damages to
the residence with two students who were
evicted from Hurlburt earlier this week.
The six students will share the cost of a damage
bill which exceeded $1,000. Damages to Hurlburt
included a bed frame tossed from the third floor,
a pulled fire alarm, holes in walls, a broken
screen and broken fire boxes. Cleaning was also
needed because of vomit and urine in the fire
escape and trash strewn around the house.
According to Conklin, the four students were
not accused of damaging the house, but were
accused of being inconsiderate to other residents

and of starting a party that led to the damages.
The two students evicted this week were also not
accused of damaging the house themselves,
Conk-lin said.
Conklin said the students were evicted
"because there was a history of previous con
versations and an existing agreement on what
their conduct should be," in addition to the
residence agreement. Conklin had not had such
conversations with the four students sent letters
yesterday.
In the letters, Conklin reminded the four stu
dents of the University's residence agreement,
which requires consideration of other residents
and prohibits disruptive behavior.
On Jan. 17, some Hurlburt residents began
celebrating at approximately 1:30 a.m. and sat
outside the house in a car, honking the horn for
an extended period, according to Hurlburt resi
dent Jay Murray.
Conklin said she has looked over reports on
damages to 553 Mayfield and the Sigma Chi
residence that occurred the same night as the
Hurlburt damage.
Conklin said she asked for as much
detail as people could give her in the
reports and after reviewing them, feels
she has received "a good amount of
concrete detail."
Enough evidence exists to deter
mine who was responsible for dama
ges at 553 Mayfield, according to Conk
lin, hut before taking any further ac
tion, Conklin said she will consult with
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
I want to see where she is in her in
vestigation," Conklin said.
"I am looking into it and am calling
in people to talk with," Cole said. Cole
said she is also,reviewing the reports
received by Conklin.
Punishing a student for violation of
the residence agreement does not
preclude charging that student with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard,

according to Cole.
Both the students evicted from
Hurlburt and the students sent letters
may still face charges of violating the
Fundamental Standard.
"It's not just a question of breaking
the residence agreement," Conklin
said. "It may also be a question of a stu
dent's relationship with the Univer
sity."
While residents of 553 Mayfield ear
lier claimed not to have seen or heard
anything inside the house the night the
damages occurred, Resident Assistant
Chip Atterbury now says "something
inside was seen that night."
Atterhurv said two students in the
house did not want to announce what
they saw because they believed the na
ture of the information would make
their identities obvious, and they
"didn't want to get involved."
"It was probably less personal fear
than that they just didn't want to see
their names printed and be questioned
endlessly," Atterburv said.
