# Row sets conditions for evicted students
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
In response to a Jan. 15 disturbance on the
Row, the University yesterday sent letters to four
Hurlburt residents outlining conditions they must
meet to continue living in University housing, ac
cording to Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Diana
Conklin.
To remain in Hurlburt, the four students must
apologize to fellow Hurlburt residents, work to
develop conduct guidelines with other members
of the house, promise not to repeat their dis
ruptive behavior and share the cost of damages to
the residence with two students who were
evicted from Hurlburt earlier this week.
The six students will share the cost of a damage
bill which exceeded $1,000. Damages to Hurlburt
included a bed frame tossed from the third floor,
a pulled fire alarm, holes in walls, a broken
screen and broken fire boxes. Cleaning was also
needed because of vomit and urine in the fire
escape and trash strewn around the house.
According to Conklin, the four students were
not accused of damaging the house, but were
accused of being inconsiderate to other residents

and of starting a party that led to the damages.
The two students evicted this week were also not
accused of damaging the house themselves,
Conk-lin said.
Conklin said the students were evicted
"because there was a history of previous con
versations and an existing agreement on what
their conduct should be," in addition to the
residence agreement. Conklin had not had such
conversations with the four students sent letters
yesterday.
In the letters, Conklin reminded the four stu
dents of the University's residence agreement,
which requires consideration of other residents
and prohibits disruptive behavior.
On Jan. 17, some Hurlburt residents began
celebrating at approximately 1:30 a.m. and sat
outside the house in a car, honking the horn for
an extended period, according to Hurlburt resi
dent Jay Murray.
Conklin said she has looked over reports on
damages to 553 Mayfield and the Sigma Chi
residence that occurred the same night as the
Hurlburt damage.
