# Drell: Reagan split slows arms control
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
A split within the Reagan admin
istration could prevent the United
States from making significant prog
ress in arms control relations with
the Soviet Union, according to a
Stanford arms control expert.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), said President
Reagan has "an opportunity to
make historic precedents in arms
control right now, noting that the
president has "articulated some
very good goals." Drell spoke last
night to approximately 20 people in
Branner Hall.
That opportunity could he lost,
however, if factions within the ad
ministration cannot compromise
on the country's defense goals.
One has to say that the adminis

tration is clearly divided," Drell
said, adding that "different parts of
the administration are speaking
with different voices."
Owe side is led by Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger and At
torney General Edwin Meese, who
call for the United States to immedi
ately deploy a space-based defense
system, Drell said. Deployment of
the president's proposed Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) would vio
late the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty forged by the Nixon adminis
tration, he said.
That treaty allows for testing of
land-based defense systems and re
search on space-based systems, but
prevents actual testing and deploy
ment of a space-based defense net
work.

Sidney Drcll, deputy director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, told a Branner Hall audience last night that a split in the Reagan
administration is preventing progress on arms control.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who favors re
duction in the arsenals of U.S. and Soviet nuclear
weapons.
The split between supporters of space-based
defense and proponents of arms reduction within
the treat's provisions is detrimental to arms con
trol progress, Drell said.
"To be serious about arms control, one has got
to put together these competing aspects of
defense and offense," he said.
A compromise between the two stances will
not end chances of deployment of SDI, Drell said,
noting that the administration has distorted the
issue of a space-based defense system.
"The president said last night 1 will not kill
SDI. That's a misplav of the issue," he said, noting
that research on a space-based defense system is
permitted under the ABM Treaty and has taken
place since 1972. Drell suggested that such re
search could continue without testing in the next
10 years, during which time the United States
could negotiate reductions in nuclear arms.
Drell said Reagan has not shown the kind of
decisive leadership President Nixon demon
strated in the first Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.
He said Nixon was able to focus more clearly his
administration's goals.
"One day the president (Nixon) made clear
what he wanted. That was leadership," Drell said,
stressing that Reagan must take similar initiative.
"We don't have a unified administration.
There's a lot of homework that has to be done,"
he said.
Drell criticized SDI, noting that there is "no
cheap technological fix" to solve the arms race."
