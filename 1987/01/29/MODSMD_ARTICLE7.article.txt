### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
A split within the Reagan admin
istration could prevent the United
States from making significant prog
ress in arms control relations with
the Soviet Union, according to a
Stanford arms control expert.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), said President
Reagan has "an opportunity to
make historic precedents in arms
control right now, noting that the
president has "articulated some
very good goals." Drell spoke last
night to approximately 20 people in
Branner Hall.
That opportunity could he lost,
however, if factions within the ad
ministration cannot compromise
on the country's defense goals.
One has to say that the adminis

tration is clearly divided," Drell
said, adding that "different parts of
the administration are speaking
with different voices."
Owe side is led by Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger and At
torney General Edwin Meese, who
call for the United States to immedi
ately deploy a space-based defense
system, Drell said. Deployment of
the president's proposed Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) would vio
late the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty forged by the Nixon adminis
tration, he said.
That treaty allows for testing of
land-based defense systems and re
search on space-based systems, but
prevents actual testing and deploy
ment of a space-based defense net
work.
