### INGHID WICKELGREN Staff writer 
A proposed arts theme house has at. least
seven potential residents, according to sopho
more Susan Jancso, who is organizing a pro

needed before her proposal is submitted to Res

theme house proposal will he announced h\
Res Ed in late February, in time for theme
house descriptions to be included in the Draw
Book, according to a statement of Res Fd
guidelines.
The seven students have committed them

selves to live in the house, and 12 others have
signed a list expressing interest. Many students
with unguaranteed housing next year have also
signed the list indicating interest, Jancso said
There would be space in the house for un
guaranteed and graduate students, as well as
students planning to go overseas wintet or
spring quarters next year, Jancso said.
We want the arts theme house to be a place
where the focus is art and where people are in
tellectually inspired and allowed to practice
their talents and interests,' Jancso said.
She said the house would also bring artists
and enthusiasm about art to the entire campus.
It would be a place where teachers of interest
ing art projects could find a captive audience, as

well a place where students and visiting ar
tists could perform and display their art, she
said
Jancso Naicl slit' has received much facult)
support and enthusiasm for the house. Nine
faculty members have agreed to he Resident
Fellows for the house, she said.
Jancso s;iicl facultx fellows would visit the
house frequenth to eat and talk with students
and give support to the house. The fellows
would include facult) from the dance, drama,
film, music, history, creative writing and an de
pan men ts.
Four of the pledged facult) fellows have
agreed to serve on a h< >use advisor) - committee,
a steering committee made up of both students

and facult) designed to formulate ideas related
to the theme of the house, Jancso said.
said the house would probably be
self-operated in order to minimize the "hassle
to students of cooking and to avoid the
structured meal schedule of I'niversitv
operated housing.
The art theme house proposal asks for a
large room for dance equipped with ballet
barrcs and mirrors, pianos and music stands,
movable blocks and track lighting, art easels
and a slide projector for the house.
Jancso said she hopes the house will be
easilv accessible to students. Although she ini
tially preferred a location on the Row . Jancso
noted that there are, built-in facilities at Gover

nor .s Corner for an arts house. Elliot Program
Center, near Governor's Corner, contains
practice space and practice rooms with pianos.
There is also a large and under-used dining hall
in Governor's Corner, according tojancso.
In addition, visiting artists could stay in the
Governor s Corner guest cottages and speak at
night or eat breakfast at the theme house,
Jancso said.
Each quarter, the house would require of its
residents a one- to two-unit house seminar The
propused seminar for fall quarter would he
called turning Experience Into Art "It would
be about how art is created, how you transfer
an emotion into a dance step, into a
color of a painting or into words of a
poem," Jancso said. She said the idea
for the seminar was the brainchild of
Michelle Carter, a Jones Lecturer in the
creative writing department.
A house seminar about jazz and its
influence on all arts disciplines has

also been proposed, Jancso said.
Up to five unguaranteed students
would be able to assure themselves a
place in the arts house if they volun
teer to be theme associates for the
house. Theme associates would in
clude an events coordinator, who
would organize Bay Area, campus and
house events listings.
Students can sign up for residence
in the proposed house on sheets that
will be distributed at house meetings,
or they can telephone Jancso.

The seven students have committed them

selves to live in the house, and 12 others have
signed a list expressing interest. Many students
with unguaranteed housing next year have also
signed the list indicating interest, Jancso said
There would be space in the house for un
guaranteed and graduate students, as well as
students planning to go overseas wintet or
spring quarters next year, Jancso said.
We want the arts theme house to be a place
where the focus is art and where people are in
tellectually inspired and allowed to practice
their talents and interests,' Jancso said.
She said the house would also bring artists
and enthusiasm about art to the entire campus.
It would be a place where teachers of interest
ing art projects could find a captive audience, as

well a place where students and visiting ar
tists could perform and display their art, she
said
Jancso Naicl slit' has received much facult)
support and enthusiasm for the house. Nine
faculty members have agreed to he Resident
Fellows for the house, she said.
Jancso s;iicl facultx fellows would visit the
house frequenth to eat and talk with students
and give support to the house. The fellows
would include facult) from the dance, drama,
film, music, history, creative writing and an de
pan men ts.
Four of the pledged facult) fellows have
agreed to serve on a h< >use advisor) - committee,
a steering committee made up of both students

and facult) designed to formulate ideas related
to the theme of the house, Jancso said.
said the house would probably be
self-operated in order to minimize the "hassle
to students of cooking and to avoid the
structured meal schedule of I'niversitv
operated housing.
The art theme house proposal asks for a
large room for dance equipped with ballet
barrcs and mirrors, pianos and music stands,
movable blocks and track lighting, art easels
and a slide projector for the house.
Jancso said she hopes the house will be
easilv accessible to students. Although she ini
tially preferred a location on the Row . Jancso
noted that there are, built-in facilities at Gover

nor .s Corner for an arts house. Elliot Program
Center, near Governor's Corner, contains
practice space and practice rooms with pianos.
There is also a large and under-used dining hall
in Governor's Corner, according tojancso.
In addition, visiting artists could stay in the
Governor s Corner guest cottages and speak at
night or eat breakfast at the theme house,
Jancso said.
Each quarter, the house would require of its
residents a one- to two-unit house seminar The
propused seminar for fall quarter would he
called turning Experience Into Art "It would
be about how art is created, how you transfer
an emotion into a dance step, into a
color of a painting or into words of a
poem," Jancso said. She said the idea
for the seminar was the brainchild of
Michelle Carter, a Jones Lecturer in the
creative writing department.
A house seminar about jazz and its
influence on all arts disciplines has

also been proposed, Jancso said.
Up to five unguaranteed students
would be able to assure themselves a
place in the arts house if they volun
teer to be theme associates for the
house. Theme associates would in
clude an events coordinator, who
would organize Bay Area, campus and
house events listings.
Students can sign up for residence
in the proposed house on sheets that
will be distributed at house meetings,
or they can telephone Jancso.
