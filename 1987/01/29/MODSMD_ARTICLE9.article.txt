Group claims abductions
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Libera
tion of Palestine claimed responsibility yesterday for the abduction of three
Americans and an Indian professor from a West Beirut campus.
In London the Church of England said the Archbishop of Canterbury had
received assurances that his envoy, Terry Waite, was safe and continuing
his mission to free foreign captives in Lebanon.
The four professors were "conspirators under the pretext of education,"
said the handwritten Arabic-language statement delivered to the West
Beirut office of a Western news agency. The group was formerly unknown.
The statement was accompanied by a Polaroid picture of one of the
hostages, American professor Robert Polhill, 53, of New York City, a lec
turer in accounting.
Polhill and three others were seized Saturday at the campus of Beirut
University College by gunmen posing as Lebanese riot police.
The other hostages are Alann Steen, 47, of Areata, a communications in
structor; Jesse Turner, 39, of Boise, Idaho, a visiting professor of mathema
tics and computer science; and Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a visiting professor
of finance.
Democrats to pressure Reagan
WASHINGTON — Democrats controlling both the House and Senate
served notice yesterday they won't let President Reagan off the hook
despite his plea that Congress not "let partisanship weaken us" over the
Iran arms deal controversy.
The day after the president made the appeal in his State of the Union ad
dress, House Speaker Jim Wright said Democrats will waste no time pursu
ing their own legislative goals this year, without waiting for Reagan's spe
cific proposals.
Wright (D-Texas) said Congress was "chomping at the bit," for instance,
to pass legislation providing insurance to ease the financial burden of cata
strophic illness.
As Wright spoke to reporters, three separate congressional panels under
Democratic chairmen were beginning hearings on the issue. The adminis
tration is still debating its approach to the problem.
Even though Reagan and congressional leaders pledged bipartisan
cooperation, both sides quickly gave way to partisan sniping.
Shultz warns militant S. African
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz, in a meeting that
drew criticism from conservatives and brought chanting protesters to the
State Department, warned militant South African black nationalist Oliver
Tambo yesterday that the use of violence to combat the apartheid system of
racial segregation "will only lead to a catastrophe for all."
The warning appeared to have little effect, however, and there appeared
to be little agreement in the 50-minute first encounter between Shultz and
the principal opponent of South Africa's white minority government. Both
men held to their previous positions on the issues of violence and the
degree of Soviet influence within Tambo's African National Congress.
Tambo said he told Shultz that for nearly 50 years the ANC has used
peaceful means to seek social justice and adopted armed tactics only in
1961 after the organization was outlawed by the government. In the last
two.years, violence escalated as black militants have assassinated blacks
with ties to the white regime and have planted bombs in white areas.
In addition to opposition to violence, Shultz made clear that the adminis
tration was concerned "about the degree of Soviet influence in the ANC,"
according to a State Department statement.
Two top Soviet leaders expelled
MOSCOW — The Communist Party expelled two old guard stalwarts
from its highest ranks yesterday and gave Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorba
chev greater control of the powerful secretariat, but it did not make some
reforms he proposed.
The two-day plenum of more than 300 Central Committee members did
not fulfill the rumors of dramatic leadership changes, and its results sug
gested disagreement over some programs Gorbachev included in his
lengthy speech Tuesday.
It endorsed Gorbachev's insistence on accelerated economic change
and more openness in Soviet society, however. A final resolution said:
"There is nowhere we can retreat."
No mention was made in the resolution of the 55-year-old leader's call
for more than one candidate and secret ballots in elections for a regional
party committee, which indicated lack of unanimity on such a significant
change in party practice.
Removal of the former Kazakhstan party leader, 74-year-old Din
mukhamed Kunaev, from the ruling Politburo eliminated one of the last
Brezhnev-era leaders from the national leadership.
The Central Committee, which groups the top party members from Mos
cow and the 15 Soviet republics, also retired 72-year-old Mikhail Zimyanin
from the party secretariat "for health reasons."
Speaker: Reagan sent Bible
TEHRAN, Iran — Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani yesterday
flourished a Bible he said was sent by President Reagan as a token of good
will, but he said Iran is not ready to help free American hostages in
Lebanon.
The speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, called on the United States to release
1507 million in Iranian assets frozen by President Carter after the seizure of
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
The Americans must release our assets and when they give the orders
for their release, we are prepared to help them," he told a news confer
ence.
The United States and Iran have been negotiating over the assets at a spe
cial tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
Rafsanjani displayed the leather-bound Open Book Bible-Expanded
Edition at a news conference, holding it open to the title page which bore
Ronald Reagan s name and a handwritten New Testament verse:
"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentile by
faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, All the nations
shall be blessed in vou. Galatians 3:8, (signed) Ronald Reagan, Oct. 3,
1986."
San Jose officers injured in raid
SAN JOSE — Two patrolmen were injured yesterday when their car
crashed into a utility pole as they chased a suspect during a pre-dawn raid
in which San Jose police arrested 3 7 alleged drug dealers, authorities said.
Officers Timothy Knea and Keith Little were taken to San Jose Hospital
with injuries after their unmarked car went out of control on rain-slick
Piercy Road and crashed into the wooden pole at 9:39 a.m., said police Sgt.
Dwight Messimer.
Knea was listed in fair condition with a broken nose, a hospital spokes
woman said. Little was treated and released
The suspect the officers had been pursuing escaped, the sergeant said
Messimer said the accident was the only mishap in the pre-dawn strike,
in which officers attempted to serve arrest warrants against 43 suspected
drug dealers
He said nearly 30 of the suspects named in the warrants were captured
in the raid and another half-dozen were served warrants in jails where they
were being held for other arrests.

tion of Palestine claimed responsibility yesterday for the abduction of three
Americans and an Indian professor from a West Beirut campus.
In London the Church of England said the Archbishop of Canterbury had
received assurances that his envoy, Terry Waite, was safe and continuing
his mission to free foreign captives in Lebanon.
The four professors were "conspirators under the pretext of education,"
said the handwritten Arabic-language statement delivered to the West
Beirut office of a Western news agency. The group was formerly unknown.
The statement was accompanied by a Polaroid picture of one of the
hostages, American professor Robert Polhill, 53, of New York City, a lec
turer in accounting.
Polhill and three others were seized Saturday at the campus of Beirut
University College by gunmen posing as Lebanese riot police.
The other hostages are Alann Steen, 47, of Areata, a communications in
structor; Jesse Turner, 39, of Boise, Idaho, a visiting professor of mathema
tics and computer science; and Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a visiting professor
of finance.
Democrats to pressure Reagan
WASHINGTON — Democrats controlling both the House and Senate
served notice yesterday they won't let President Reagan off the hook
despite his plea that Congress not "let partisanship weaken us" over the
Iran arms deal controversy.
The day after the president made the appeal in his State of the Union ad
dress, House Speaker Jim Wright said Democrats will waste no time pursu
ing their own legislative goals this year, without waiting for Reagan's spe
cific proposals.
Wright (D-Texas) said Congress was "chomping at the bit," for instance,
to pass legislation providing insurance to ease the financial burden of cata
strophic illness.
As Wright spoke to reporters, three separate congressional panels under
Democratic chairmen were beginning hearings on the issue. The adminis
tration is still debating its approach to the problem.
Even though Reagan and congressional leaders pledged bipartisan
cooperation, both sides quickly gave way to partisan sniping.
Shultz warns militant S. African
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz, in a meeting that
drew criticism from conservatives and brought chanting protesters to the
State Department, warned militant South African black nationalist Oliver
Tambo yesterday that the use of violence to combat the apartheid system of
racial segregation "will only lead to a catastrophe for all."
The warning appeared to have little effect, however, and there appeared
to be little agreement in the 50-minute first encounter between Shultz and
the principal opponent of South Africa's white minority government. Both
men held to their previous positions on the issues of violence and the
degree of Soviet influence within Tambo's African National Congress.
Tambo said he told Shultz that for nearly 50 years the ANC has used
peaceful means to seek social justice and adopted armed tactics only in
1961 after the organization was outlawed by the government. In the last
two.years, violence escalated as black militants have assassinated blacks
with ties to the white regime and have planted bombs in white areas.
In addition to opposition to violence, Shultz made clear that the adminis
tration was concerned "about the degree of Soviet influence in the ANC,"
according to a State Department statement.
Two top Soviet leaders expelled
MOSCOW — The Communist Party expelled two old guard stalwarts
from its highest ranks yesterday and gave Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorba
chev greater control of the powerful secretariat, but it did not make some
reforms he proposed.
The two-day plenum of more than 300 Central Committee members did
not fulfill the rumors of dramatic leadership changes, and its results sug
gested disagreement over some programs Gorbachev included in his
lengthy speech Tuesday.
It endorsed Gorbachev's insistence on accelerated economic change
and more openness in Soviet society, however. A final resolution said:
"There is nowhere we can retreat."
No mention was made in the resolution of the 55-year-old leader's call
for more than one candidate and secret ballots in elections for a regional
party committee, which indicated lack of unanimity on such a significant
change in party practice.
Removal of the former Kazakhstan party leader, 74-year-old Din
mukhamed Kunaev, from the ruling Politburo eliminated one of the last
Brezhnev-era leaders from the national leadership.
The Central Committee, which groups the top party members from Mos
cow and the 15 Soviet republics, also retired 72-year-old Mikhail Zimyanin
from the party secretariat "for health reasons."
Speaker: Reagan sent Bible
TEHRAN, Iran — Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani yesterday
flourished a Bible he said was sent by President Reagan as a token of good
will, but he said Iran is not ready to help free American hostages in
Lebanon.
The speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, called on the United States to release
1507 million in Iranian assets frozen by President Carter after the seizure of
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
The Americans must release our assets and when they give the orders
for their release, we are prepared to help them," he told a news confer
ence.
The United States and Iran have been negotiating over the assets at a spe
cial tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
Rafsanjani displayed the leather-bound Open Book Bible-Expanded
Edition at a news conference, holding it open to the title page which bore
Ronald Reagan s name and a handwritten New Testament verse:
"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentile by
faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, All the nations
shall be blessed in vou. Galatians 3:8, (signed) Ronald Reagan, Oct. 3,
1986."
San Jose officers injured in raid
SAN JOSE — Two patrolmen were injured yesterday when their car
crashed into a utility pole as they chased a suspect during a pre-dawn raid
in which San Jose police arrested 3 7 alleged drug dealers, authorities said.
Officers Timothy Knea and Keith Little were taken to San Jose Hospital
with injuries after their unmarked car went out of control on rain-slick
Piercy Road and crashed into the wooden pole at 9:39 a.m., said police Sgt.
Dwight Messimer.
Knea was listed in fair condition with a broken nose, a hospital spokes
woman said. Little was treated and released
The suspect the officers had been pursuing escaped, the sergeant said
Messimer said the accident was the only mishap in the pre-dawn strike,
in which officers attempted to serve arrest warrants against 43 suspected
drug dealers
He said nearly 30 of the suspects named in the warrants were captured
in the raid and another half-dozen were served warrants in jails where they
were being held for other arrests.
