# Aquino calls for rally of support
## 
### 
MANILA, Philippines — A visibly
shaken President Corazon Aquino ap
pealed to the Philippine people yester
day to rally behind her during one of
the darkest moments of her
presidency.
After a week in which she has lost
considerable support from within her
powerful armed forces and the na
tion's growing political left, Aquino
called on Filipinos in the political cen
ter to mass in a park here Saturday to
"demonstrate once more the power of
the people."
The 54-year-old former housewife
also attempted to exert control over an
increasingly alienated military, order
ing her defense minister to file charges
against 160 soldiers who seized a key

television and radio station for three
days.
The rebel troops surrendered with
out fanfare late yesterday afternoon,
but not until after Aquino's top military
leaders chose to ignore her orders to
"use the full force of the law," includ
ing an all-out military attack, to liberate
the station. Such an assault, military
sources said, easily could have touched
off a large-scale rebellion within the
now deeply divided armed forces.
Defense Minister Rafael Ileto and
Aquino's military chief of staff, Gen.
Fidel Ramos, refused to commit them
selves yesterday as to whether punish
ment awaits the rebel soldiers, who
said they had never left the armed
forces and were merely protesting the

policies of Aquino's civilian govern
ment.
In her nationally televised statement
yesterday, Aquino said the recent at
tempts to destabilize her young gov
ernment were aimed at preventing
Monday's national referendum on a
new constitution that she believes will
bring stability to her government for
the first time since she took power in
last February's "people's power" revo
lution.
"Enemies of democracy agree with
the friends of democracy that the
ratification of the proposed constitu
tion is essential to the preservation of
democracy in the Philippines," the ob
viously strained president said, reading
stiffly from the typewritten pages

before her:
"This explains the desperate efforts
of the opponents of the constitution to
prevent the plebiscite on Feb. 2."
Yet another threat looms tomorrow,
when several leftist organizations plan
to march on Aquino's presidential
palace with the bodies of two of the 19
peasants killed by soldiers during a
similar march just seven days ago.
Alan Jazmines, general secretary of
the leftist Peoples Party, stopped short
of condemning the wide support
within the military for the rebel sol
diers, whose avowed purpose was to
call the nation's attention to the in
creasing influence of communism in
the country.
