# New chip will aid in nerve repair

Bv growing nerve endings through a tiny silicon
chip, researchers at Stanford may have taken the first
step toward the successful repair of crushed and
severed nerves
One of the researchers, Dr. Morton Grosser, des
cribed the developing technology as "an electronic
interface with the human nervous system." These
chips, surgically implanted in human limbs and
programmed to transmit nerve signals across the
damaged site, could restore function to' deadened
arms and legs. ,
Peripheral nerves, Grosser explained, contain
more than 2,000 smaller axons, each one micron — a
thousandth of a millimeter — in diameter. Although
modern surgical procedures have performed
miracles by reattaching severed limbs and even
stitching nerves back together, "the chances of the
axons regrowing in their proper order is zero," he
said. Consequently, affected limbs never regain any
thing near their original capability.
The challenge, says Grosser, "is to reconnect the

axons in the proper sequence." He and his partner,
Dr. Joseph Rosen, assistant professor of surgery at the
medical school, hope their research with microchips
will provide a means of doing so.
Their work has so far been successful in growing
nerve fibers through nearly 2,500 holes, each 5
microns in diameter, drilled into a silicon chip one
square millimeter in size. Each fiber is then con
nected by two electrodes to a main computer.
The computer reads a sequence of electrical im
pulses from the nerves in one chip and retransmits
the impulses — bridging the damaged site — to the
appropriate nerves.
"When you move your hand to, say, pick up a pen
cil, your nerve produces a very specific firing pat
tern," Grosser said. "With the chip serving as a sort of
grid, the result (on a computer screen) looks some
thing like a topographical map.
So when the computer — also called iMAP, for
Microelectronic Axon Processor — receives the sig
nal from the brain, it is programmed to reproduce
these specific firing patterns in the chip-attached
nerve, stimulating muscle movement.

The role of the computer could eventually be
phased out, using something called fusable-link tech
nology. The two silicon chips would be held together
by a gold conductor: Voltage fired between them
would melt the intervening metal and essentially fuse
the proper axons together.
Because the nervous system is "redundant" and
fires many axons when only a few may be necessary
to operate a muscle, correctly replacing even 20 per
cent of the original axons could restore up to 80 per
cent of the original limb function, Grosser said.
This technology would offer substantial hope to in
dividuals left paralyzed after spinal cord injuries.
Grosser pointed out, however, that for the present,
their research is slow and limited to experiments
with animals. "Right now we're working toward the
point where, if we have a paralyzed rat, we can flip a
switch to the computer, and it can walk."
Rosen was equally hesitant to speculate on the
medical possibilities. "It will be at least 10 years, if
ever, before this becomes a clinical device," he said.
"But we are verv excited."
