## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Editor's farewell 
### 
First, I'd like to thank
Just kidding.
It's difficult to find words to say farewell as editor of
The Daily and resist the temptation to pay tribute to the
100 or so people who made Volume 190 a success. Stan
ford has a morning paper again, and the quality of
reporting — thanks to a dedicated staff of writers who
make up the very heart of the paper — is better than at
any time in recent memory.
But rather than bore everyone with a lot of thanks — a
task that would never end — I'd like to leave readers
with something that will make them think about jour
nalism and reflect on The Daily's role at Stanford, two
topics I have spent more than a little time grappling with
in the last five months. The following are two scenarios
that actually happened. Both cases involved difficult deci
sions — choices that challenged us to think deeply about
The Daily's role on campus, its responsibilities to those it
reports on and our ethics as individual journalists.
Last November, the Stanford Police called The Daily
requesting copies of photographs The Daily had pub
lished in April. Several animal rights protesters who had
been arrested at an April demorlstration at the Psychol-
Department were standing trial in Palo Alto
Municipal Court, and the district attorney wanted more
evidence — Daily photos. (
After considering the issue with lawyers and thinking
about the press' obligation to resist alliance with law en
forcement agencies, I told the police that they would
have to subpoena the photos, that we would not volun
tarily surrender our photos and betray the confidence
our sources place in us, that we do not take notes and
shoot photographs to aid the police.
The next day, a Stanford police officer served the sub
poena at The Daily, but, much to my surprise, the docu
ment demanded all photographs — published and un
published — of all recent animal rights demonstrations
— not just the one at which the protesters were arrested.
A Daily lawyer called the deputy district attorney who
had issued die subpoena to inform her of the existence
of a California statute protecting the press from being
forced to supply unpublished photos. "Hie deputy district
attorney said she knew of no such law, but after locating
it in a book, agreed that The Daily should only be com
pelled to hand over published photos. In accordance
with a Daily policy of cooperating fully with reasonable
subpoenas, we handed over prints of the published
photos.
The district attorney was alarmingly ignorant of an im
portant and hard-won right of the press. If the press can
be forced to surrender notes, photos and other un
published information gathered in the process of report
ing the news, sources will be reluctant to supply the in
formation, and the reading public will suffer in the long
run. The rights of the press must be balanced carefully
widi its legal obligation to cooperate with the law.

Last week. Residential Education evicted two students
from Hurlburt House for their involvement in a dis
ruptive incident that violated the University's residence
agreement. What seemed like a straightforward story
turned complex when one of the two called The Daily
and pleaded not to be identified by name in the news ar
ticle the next day. The Daily reporter had found the
name legitimately — by walking to Hurlburt. finding the
students moving out of their room and interviewing
them on the spot.
The Daily was confronted with a tough question: On
the one hand, we could have honored the student's re
quest, protecting him from public obloquy while still
reporting the essentials of the story. This choice also
would have benefited University Judicial Affairs, which
keeps confidential the names of students it investigates.
On the other hand, we could have named him. thereby
ensuring a complete story and holding a student respon
sible for his actions.
We decided to identify the student. Not naming him
would have established a dangerous precedent of grant
ing anonymity' to people who have committed acts they
later regret. Like with the first example, a careful balance
must be struck — this time between protecting an indi
vidual's privacy and ensuring the public's right to know.
These are just two examples of the issues that make
life at The Daily exciting and worthwhile.
But there are other things. Part of me — the part that
doesn't need sleep — will miss the 70-hour weeks and
the 4 a.m. nights. A sense of camaraderie and ac
complishment has evolved as we've churned out the
papers, overcome the challenges and made the difficult
decisions. And — perhaps this is the surest sign of suc
cess of all — I think everyone who contributed to The
Daily's Volume 190 has had a positive experience and
learned more through this hands-on experience than
any class could ever hope to teach.
But even more than the issues and challenges we have
confronted, the people who have worked on the paper
are the foremost reason why this volume has been suc
cessful and fun. And they, almost all of whom will be
back for the volume that begins with Monday's paper, are
the ceason why every student should come by The Daily
and try his or her hand at editing or an assignment.
I can't resist — a special thanks to Brendan Healey,
whose commitment to The Daily has been an inspiration
to us all; to Mary Yuh, whose experience and enthusiasm
about journalism added a touch of professionalism; and
to Charlie Gofen, whose friendship and wise counsel
made the difference on more than one occasion.
Good luck to Mike Newman and Volume 191.
