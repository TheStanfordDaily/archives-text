# Palestinians and the PLO
## 
### 
Isaac Winer presents a very interesting viewpoint (Daily,
Jan. 14) on the subject of the resolution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict The heart of Mr. Winer's argument is found at the
end of his piece when he states that a peaceful compromise
of the conflict will be more probable with "Israel calling the
shots."

The remainder of the article is concerned with proving to
the reader that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
is unfit to represent the Palestinian cause and so therefore
Israel should represent it instead. One can hardly imagine
that such a solution would represent a just compromise that
takes into account the demands of all parties concerned; the
old adage of the fox guarding the hens comes to mind.
Mr. Winer contrasts an incident in which the PLO commit
ted the "heinous and morally repugnant act" of murdering
an Israeli rabbinical student with an incident about a month
later at Bir Zeit University in which the Israeli Defense
Forces (IDF), in the act of "defending themselves," killed
two Palestinian students and wounded 11 others.
King Hussein of Jordan is also compared favorably with
the PLO by Mr. Winer. First, he invents the notion of
benevolent joint Israeli-Jordanian administration of the
West Bank. In reality, the West Bank is run by an Israeli mili
tary administration thinly disguised only in the last five years
as a civilian administration. After all, it was not a local police
force that killed the Palestinian students of Mr. Winer's ex
ample, but the Israeli army.
Second, Mr. Winer contrasts Yassar Arafat's efforts to
bring "the peace process to a screeching halt" with Jordan's
understanding that peace in the region will only come
about as a result of complete acceptance of Israel's
demands. In fact, it is often Israel just as much as the PLO
that blocks the peace process, and sometimes Israel alone,
as in the following example.
On Sept. 1, 1982, President Reagan was sufficiently
alarmed by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and subsequent
events that he proposed a Middle East peace plan that
represented a substantial break with previous American
foreign policy in the region. It was supported by many Arab
and European countries, and even the PLO described it as
having both positive and negative attributes.
Israel firmly rejected the proposal because it represented
a more even compromise than the Israeli definition of com
promise, mentioned above, would allow
It is unfortunate that Mr. Winer's article was entitled
"Peace in the Middle East." for his formula for peace will not
work and has not worked for the last 40 years Palestinian
Arab nationalism is not a phenomenon that can be defeated
militarily; this is one of the lessons the United States was
supposed to have learned in Vietnam and that the Soviet Un
ion is learning in Afghanistan.

Since a military policy will therefore not solve the Arab-
Israeli dispute, a diplomatic approach is the only way to
move toward resolution of the conflict. Both parties must
recognize the similarities in their histories, needs and
demands. The Jews were exiled from their homeland by
foreign invaders (the Romans) thousands of years ago. In
1882 a movement named Zionism arose, and it called for a
return of the Jews to their historic homeland in Palestine;
during the ensuing seven decades, thousands of Jews im
migrated to Palestine from all over the world.
This movement eventually resulted in the reconstitution
of the Jewish state on May 15, 1948. There was a problem
with this movement, however: Palestine was not an unpop
ulated region waiting through the centuries for the Jews to
return to it; instead, it was inhabited by a largely Moslem
Arab population that had been cultivating the land for
hundreds of years.
We will now look at the same set of events from the Pales
tinian viewpoint. The Palestinians were, and continue to be.
exiled from their homeland by foreign invaders (the Jews)
during the last 100 years. Within several decades a move
ment had begun to resist this invasion; the resistance inten
sified in 1948 with the establishment of Israel and the subse
quent expulsion of hundreds of thousands of native Pales
tinians. Today this nationalist movement calls for the es
tablishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel in part of
the Palestinians' historic homeland.
While the United States has a definite role to play in the
resolution of the conflict, the principal parties to any negoti
ations must be the equally legitimate representatives of the
Israelis and the Palestinians: Israel and the PLO,
respectively. Presently neither entity officially recognizes
the other, and so cease-fire negotiations take place through
a long and tortuous chain of middlemen. Such inefficiency
could be dispensed with through mutual recognition of the
other's legitimate demands.
In 1974 and again in 1977 the Palestine National Council
passed resolutions suggesting that the PLO has moved
beyond the Palestinian National Covenant as the basis for re
lations between Israel and the PLO Israel has not yet made a
similar conciliatory gesture to the PLO. The I'nited States'
proper role in all of this is in using its enormous clout in the
region to gently and patiently nudge each party toward a
compromise solution.
President Jimmy Carter successfully used this tactic at
Camp David in 1979 to produce the historic peace treaty be
tween Egypt annd Israel. While the Camp David Accords
certainlv did not go far enough toward answering the Pales
tinian question, Carter s method was nonetheless highly ef
fective in producing an agreement; it brought together, face
to-face, the regional leaders for a specified period of time
This method requires great political skill, however, for if
taken ux> far too fast it can result in an American solution
imposed upon the regional actors (which will work just
about as well as Mr Miners peace formula).

In 1974 and again in 1977 the Palestine National Council
passed resolutions suggesting that the PLO has moved
beyond the Palestinian National Covenant as the basis for re
lations between Israel and the PLO Israel has not yet made a
similar conciliatory gesture to the PLO. The I'nited States'
proper role in all of this is in using its enormous clout in the
region to gently and patiently nudge each party toward a
compromise solution.
President Jimmy Carter successfully used this tactic at
Camp David in 1979 to produce the historic peace treaty be

The remainder of the article is concerned with proving to
the reader that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
is unfit to represent the Palestinian cause and so therefore
Israel should represent it instead. One can hardly imagine
that such a solution would represent a just compromise that
takes into account the demands of all parties concerned; the
old adage of the fox guarding the hens comes to mind.
Mr. Winer contrasts an incident in which the PLO commit
ted the "heinous and morally repugnant act" of murdering
an Israeli rabbinical student with an incident about a month
later at Bir Zeit University in which the Israeli Defense
Forces (IDF), in the act of "defending themselves," killed
two Palestinian students and wounded 11 others.
King Hussein of Jordan is also compared favorably with
the PLO by Mr. Winer. First, he invents the notion of
benevolent joint Israeli-Jordanian administration of the
West Bank. In reality, the West Bank is run by an Israeli mili
tary administration thinly disguised only in the last five years
as a civilian administration. After all, it was not a local police
force that killed the Palestinian students of Mr. Winer's ex
ample, but the Israeli army.
Second, Mr. Winer contrasts Yassar Arafat's efforts to
bring "the peace process to a screeching halt" with Jordan's
understanding that peace in the region will only come
about as a result of complete acceptance of Israel's
demands. In fact, it is often Israel just as much as the PLO
that blocks the peace process, and sometimes Israel alone,
as in the following example.
On Sept. 1, 1982, President Reagan was sufficiently
alarmed by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and subsequent
events that he proposed a Middle East peace plan that
represented a substantial break with previous American
foreign policy in the region. It was supported by many Arab
and European countries, and even the PLO described it as
having both positive and negative attributes.
Israel firmly rejected the proposal because it represented
a more even compromise than the Israeli definition of com
promise, mentioned above, would allow
It is unfortunate that Mr. Winer's article was entitled
"Peace in the Middle East." for his formula for peace will not
work and has not worked for the last 40 years Palestinian
Arab nationalism is not a phenomenon that can be defeated
militarily; this is one of the lessons the United States was
supposed to have learned in Vietnam and that the Soviet Un
ion is learning in Afghanistan.

Since a military policy will therefore not solve the Arab-
Israeli dispute, a diplomatic approach is the only way to
move toward resolution of the conflict. Both parties must
recognize the similarities in their histories, needs and
demands. The Jews were exiled from their homeland by
foreign invaders (the Romans) thousands of years ago. In
1882 a movement named Zionism arose, and it called for a
return of the Jews to their historic homeland in Palestine;
during the ensuing seven decades, thousands of Jews im
migrated to Palestine from all over the world.
This movement eventually resulted in the reconstitution
of the Jewish state on May 15, 1948. There was a problem
with this movement, however: Palestine was not an unpop
ulated region waiting through the centuries for the Jews to
return to it; instead, it was inhabited by a largely Moslem
Arab population that had been cultivating the land for
hundreds of years.
We will now look at the same set of events from the Pales
tinian viewpoint. The Palestinians were, and continue to be.
exiled from their homeland by foreign invaders (the Jews)
during the last 100 years. Within several decades a move
ment had begun to resist this invasion; the resistance inten
sified in 1948 with the establishment of Israel and the subse
quent expulsion of hundreds of thousands of native Pales
tinians. Today this nationalist movement calls for the es
tablishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel in part of
the Palestinians' historic homeland.
While the United States has a definite role to play in the
resolution of the conflict, the principal parties to any negoti
ations must be the equally legitimate representatives of the
Israelis and the Palestinians: Israel and the PLO,
respectively. Presently neither entity officially recognizes
the other, and so cease-fire negotiations take place through
a long and tortuous chain of middlemen. Such inefficiency
could be dispensed with through mutual recognition of the
other's legitimate demands.
