Daily 9 s coverage
unfair to frats
I was very disappointed with your
coverage of the Kappa Alpha mud
volleyball tournament.
I feel that a Stanford event that was
given nearly a full page at the begin
ning of the front section of a recent
issue of the Times Tribune 25)
merits at least an article, if not front
page coverage, in a paper that is
supposed to serve the Stanford
campus. I find it distressing that frater
nities at Stanford have to get in trou
ble to make news at our paper. For
instance, last year the DUs made the
front page because someone left their
pay phone off the hook after dialing
911.1 think an event involving
hundreds of Stanford students and
raising more than $3,000 for charity is
more newsworthy than that.
So please, serve the Stanford com- '
munitv — not your own self interests.

Respect Zetes for
spirit, cohesion
Shameful! The Daily has lost any
respect I may have had for it. A recent
editorial (Daily, Jan. 21) was nothing
more than sensationalistic drivel — a
badly written essay, with poorly con
ceived ideas that, worst of all, were
expressed with anti-fraternal rhetoric
that sounded as if it had been taken
straight from the mouth of Diana
Conklin.
The Daily treats white, heterosexual
males like lepers. Being a white,
heterosexual male, am I supposed to
consider myself a pariah here at Stan
ford? What about my Protestant and
Anglo-Saxon heritage? Does that mean
that a second black mark should be
drawn across my name in the Stanford
community register? 1 think not.
Maybe the Zetes would stand a
better chance of regaining their
housing if they were lepers — after
all. there are theme houses for blacks,
Hispanics and Orientals. Numerous
other residences exist solelv for those

students interested in French, German
and Italian language and culture.
Students not interested in pursuing
American Studies "[can] forget ever
living in" luxurious Robert Moore
South.
In all fairness, and in an effort to
create diversified living options for all
students, the Zetes should be let back
on. Give the Zetes the same opportu
nity you so righteously offer other
minorities. I don't expect to win any
ethnic friends by stating my opinion
so candidly, but somebody has to call
a spade a spade.
The "anti-social" behavior cited in
the editorial was committed by Zetes
who are no longer students as Stan
ford. I do not think that the actions of
a few individuals, six years ago,
should be an obstacle to the Zetes in
their effort to regain on-campus
housing.
The Zetes, in my opinion, should be
applauded for remaining a cohesive
and spirited group in the face of both
myopic student and administrative
attacks.

'Farm Side comic
was unfortunate
Normally I find a good chuckle or
two from"The Farm Side " cartoon, '
but a recent one (Daily, Jan. 23) raised
my hackles about a subject that some
Stanford students unfortunately view
with little thought or respect.
If I am to imply from this cartoon
that a proposal for a future house that
emphasizes the arts is looked upon
the same way that some mistakenly
look upon community classes for
senior citizens, then I am bound to
think that you are narrow-minded in
your views, misunderstanding the
proposal or just plain unfortunate.
Would you consider Shakespeare,
Picasso, Michelangelo, Raphael
(whose paintings, by the way, were
"woven" into tapestries) or
Balanchine as perhaps trivial in their
contributions? Would you consider
the talents of a sculptor, the discipline
of a dancer or actor, or the months —
often years — spent on a painting or
book as what some might misconstrue

as a hobby? Most important, do you
feel that the arts are unimportant in
the spectrum of a person's life?
I understand that this University is
more oriented toward the science and
technical areas of education, but to
downplay the arts or suggest that they
fit the unfonunate stereotype of
"basket weaving" is a grave and
serious misunderstanding of the arts.
I'm sorry that some may feel this way
about an aspect of life that gives fuller
and deeper meaning, inspiration and
enrichment to some and means life
itself to others.
1 would personally like to see the
arts theme house become a reality, as
I see the arts as an integral pan of life.
After all, if most people felt the way
that your cartoon implied, the only
ones reading it would be those senior
citizens in community classes.

A recent article about Kingscote!
Gardens (Daily, Jan. 22) was mdst ■
interesting. However, we are sorry to
have to call your attention to the fact
that it was also very misleading. Does
not anvone check facts before thev are
printed?
It would be interesting to know
when Joseph Stalin visited Stanford
University — we are quite sure that he
never even heard of Kingscote Gar
dens, let alone visited or stayed there!
Although Mr. George Duca was
from an aristocratic Romanian family,
he was not a prince of Romania. His
mother was a princess and his father
the minister until his assassination by
the Iron Guard. Mr. Duca was a close
and devoted friend of the royal family,
too.
These facts are known to us be
cause for many years before Mr. Duca
passed away, we were very good
friends. We also know that he would
have been upset by the incorrect data
published in that article, as well as
annoyed and amused at the same time
by your mistake about Stalin's stay at
Kingscote Gardens.

a few individuals, six years ago,
should be an obstacle to the Zetes in
their effort to regain on-campus
housing.
The Zetes, in my opinion, should be
applauded for remaining a cohesive
and spirited group in the face of both
myopic student and administrative
attacks.

'Farm Side comic
was unfortunate
Normally I find a good chuckle or
two from"The Farm Side " cartoon, '
but a recent one (Daily, Jan. 23) raised
my hackles about a subject that some
Stanford students unfortunately view
with little thought or respect.
If I am to imply from this cartoon
that a proposal for a future house that
emphasizes the arts is looked upon
the same way that some mistakenly
look upon community classes for
senior citizens, then I am bound to
think that you are narrow-minded in
your views, misunderstanding the
proposal or just plain unfortunate.
Would you consider Shakespeare,
Picasso, Michelangelo, Raphael
(whose paintings, by the way, were
"woven" into tapestries) or
Balanchine as perhaps trivial in their
contributions? Would you consider
the talents of a sculptor, the discipline
of a dancer or actor, or the months —
often years — spent on a painting or
book as what some might misconstrue

as a hobby? Most important, do you
feel that the arts are unimportant in
the spectrum of a person's life?
I understand that this University is
more oriented toward the science and
technical areas of education, but to
downplay the arts or suggest that they
fit the unfonunate stereotype of
"basket weaving" is a grave and
serious misunderstanding of the arts.
I'm sorry that some may feel this way
about an aspect of life that gives fuller
and deeper meaning, inspiration and
enrichment to some and means life
itself to others.
1 would personally like to see the
arts theme house become a reality, as
I see the arts as an integral pan of life.
After all, if most people felt the way
that your cartoon implied, the only
ones reading it would be those senior
citizens in community classes.

A recent article about Kingscote!
Gardens (Daily, Jan. 22) was mdst ■
interesting. However, we are sorry to
have to call your attention to the fact
that it was also very misleading. Does
not anvone check facts before thev are
printed?
It would be interesting to know
when Joseph Stalin visited Stanford
University — we are quite sure that he
never even heard of Kingscote Gar
dens, let alone visited or stayed there!
Although Mr. George Duca was
from an aristocratic Romanian family,
he was not a prince of Romania. His
mother was a princess and his father
the minister until his assassination by
the Iron Guard. Mr. Duca was a close
and devoted friend of the royal family,
too.
These facts are known to us be
cause for many years before Mr. Duca
passed away, we were very good
friends. We also know that he would
have been upset by the incorrect data
published in that article, as well as
annoyed and amused at the same time
by your mistake about Stalin's stay at
Kingscote Gardens.

Daily 9 s coverage
unfair to frats
I was very disappointed with your
coverage of the Kappa Alpha mud
volleyball tournament.
I feel that a Stanford event that was
given nearly a full page at the begin
ning of the front section of a recent
issue of the Times Tribune 25)
merits at least an article, if not front
page coverage, in a paper that is
supposed to serve the Stanford
campus. I find it distressing that frater
nities at Stanford have to get in trou
ble to make news at our paper. For
instance, last year the DUs made the
front page because someone left their
pay phone off the hook after dialing
911.1 think an event involving
hundreds of Stanford students and
raising more than $3,000 for charity is
more newsworthy than that.
So please, serve the Stanford com- '
munitv — not your own self interests.

Respect Zetes for
spirit, cohesion
Shameful! The Daily has lost any
respect I may have had for it. A recent
editorial (Daily, Jan. 21) was nothing
more than sensationalistic drivel — a
badly written essay, with poorly con
ceived ideas that, worst of all, were
expressed with anti-fraternal rhetoric
that sounded as if it had been taken
straight from the mouth of Diana
Conklin.
The Daily treats white, heterosexual
males like lepers. Being a white,
heterosexual male, am I supposed to
consider myself a pariah here at Stan
ford? What about my Protestant and
Anglo-Saxon heritage? Does that mean
that a second black mark should be
drawn across my name in the Stanford
community register? 1 think not.
Maybe the Zetes would stand a
better chance of regaining their
housing if they were lepers — after
all. there are theme houses for blacks,
Hispanics and Orientals. Numerous
other residences exist solelv for those

students interested in French, German
and Italian language and culture.
Students not interested in pursuing
American Studies "[can] forget ever
living in" luxurious Robert Moore
South.
In all fairness, and in an effort to
create diversified living options for all
students, the Zetes should be let back
on. Give the Zetes the same opportu
nity you so righteously offer other
minorities. I don't expect to win any
ethnic friends by stating my opinion
so candidly, but somebody has to call
a spade a spade.
The "anti-social" behavior cited in
the editorial was committed by Zetes
who are no longer students as Stan
ford. I do not think that the actions of
a few individuals, six years ago,
should be an obstacle to the Zetes in
their effort to regain on-campus
housing.
The Zetes, in my opinion, should be
