The New Children's Hospital at Stan
ford Project may continue as planned,
but will have to pay up to $750,000 to
compensate for the potential environ
mental impact of the new structure,
specifically for improvements to the
Sand Hill Road corridor, the Palo Alto
Planning Commission recommended
Wednesday.
The Palo Alto City Council will make
a final decision Feb. 23 regarding the
Planning Commission's recommenda
tion.
According to Planning Commis
sioner Pat Cullen, only $150,000 will
need to be paid "up front for studies,"
giving the hospital several years before
it will have to pay the remainder of the
money. The commission is required to
impose the tax under the California
Environmental Quality Act.
Langston Trigg, director of the
hospital project, expressed disappoint
ment over the board's decision. Al
though the city is "acting within its
rights," Trigg said, "the process is un
fair."
Trigg complained that the commis
sion determined the new structure will
cause an increase in traffic. The hospi
tal, however, will vacate the old site
and reduce its work force, Trigg said. A
new tenant has not been found for the
old hospital site.
Dr Lawrence Crowley, vice chair
man of the board of the new hospital,
cited other contributing sources to the
congestion on Sand Hill, including the
Stanford Shopping Center and the
Stanford Medical Center.
In addition, the impact of the move
will not be felt until the old building is
reoccupied, at which time its new
tenants should pay compensation,
. Crowley said, adding that traffic prob
lems may not arise until 1995.
Trigg said the sum "has the poten
tial" to put a strain on the hospital's
'budget. In the end. however, the
hospital may not be required to pay
the full amount. One option would be
for Stanford itself to help out. The con
struction and much of the traffic will
be completely on University land.
Another possibility, proposed by act-
ing University President James Rosse, is
the establishment of an assessment dis
trict to share the cost of improvements
among the property owners along
Sand Hill.
The hospital board will meet today
to discuss whether or not to appeal to
the city council. The board hopes to

begin construction next fall, Crowley
said. "
According to Cullen, the commis
sion made the penalty as light as possi
ble. Even though the hospital will be
leaving its old site, it is technically ex
panding and thus must meet environ
mental requirements, Cullen said.
The commission is in full favor of
the hospital and it "broke our hearts,"
Cullen said, to impose such a burden.
She added that Stanford should pay at
least the preliminary study fee.
