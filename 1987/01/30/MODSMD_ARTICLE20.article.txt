Blue and white posters advertis
ing tomorrow's You Can Make a
Difference conference can be
found on every corner of campus.
But most people are probably un
aware of the behind-the-scenes
work involved in coordinating this
700-person event.
Stanford seniors Jean Kayser and
Jennifer Porges are more than
aware of the complexities involved.
As co-organizers of the conference,
they have been charged with ensur
ing the success of this year's event.
The You Can Make a Difference
conference, open to students and
the community, is a day of
workshops and speakers focusing
on public service opportunities.
This year's theme is "Families In
Transition."
Kayser and Porges are
roommates who became interested
in the conference after taking a
class taught by Catherine Milton, di
rector of the Public Service Center.
Milton was the motivating force in
starting the conference four years
ago, and she warned the students
that planning the conference would
take almost a year from inception to
finish.
The two roommates knew the job
would be too big to handle alone.
"It was the sort of thing where we
looked at each other and said, 'If
you'll do it, I'll do it,' " Kayser said.
Planning the conference is "a
huge job," according to Porges.
Both students said they have spent
about 30 hours a week throughout
the fall and winter quarters organiz
ing the event. On some nights, they
are at the Public Service Center un
til after midnight.
The two students are responsible
for everything from "little details to
deciding what (issues) the speakers
are going to address," Porges said.
The "little details" include publiciz
ing the conference and preparing a
press kit, as well as raising the
$25,000 needed to put on the event.
Part of the funding has been pro
vided by contributions from dormi
tories on campus.
The co-organizers also spend

time holding weekly update
meetings with the 12 student com
mittees helping with the event.
Porges said that when she and
Kayser agreed to organize the
event, one of their goals was that it
be motivated by students and run
by students." To help promote stu
dent interest and involvement, they
decided to change last year's one
day format. This year, the confer
ence includes five pre-conference
workshops at campus residences.
The idea is to "keep students as the
primary organizers (and) involve
even more students ... who might
not have been involved in the day
of the conference but who will or
ganize that aspect of it," Porges ex
plained.
Despite all the work that she and
Porges have put into the confer
ence, Kayser is quick to point out
they could not have done it alone.
"We don't want to make it sound
like we do all the work because by
all means there are other people
working, sometimes the same
amount of hours," she said. "I'd say
we have a strong core of 40-50
people who have a definite position
(on a committee). By the day of the
conference we expect (there will
be) 60 or 70 students."
Student involvement in the con
ference runs the gamut from com
piling registration packets to choos
ing the theme for the event.
In deciding on this year's theme,
every student on a committee
talked to three faculty or staff mem
bers and solicited their opinions for
a topic. After two months of weekly
meetings to discuss possibilities,
the theme of families was chosen
"almost unanimously," according to
Kayser. "It was a hot topic," she
?aid.
The organizers expect that both
the participants in the conference
and the community as a whole will
benefit from learning more about
public service opportunities involv
ing family issues.
But Kayser also knows that she
has benefited personally because of
her role in the event.
"You can ask any of us what a
learning experience it has been,
not only organizationally, but in
tellectually — learning about all
these family issues that I admit I
knew nothing about
beforehand," she said.
Purges added that working on
the conference made her realize
"how many other people have
committed their lives (to public
serv ice). It's kind of inspiring to
see."
Both students said they have
no previous experience plan
ning conferences. Each,
however, has been involved
with volunteer projects.
Porges has participated in
several Reach Out Today proj
ects and the Ecumenical Hunger
Project through the Stanford
Volunteer Network. As part of
her Kappa Alpha Theta sorority
activities, she volunteered at the
Stanford Children's Hospital.
Kayser volunteered at the Lu
ton Gardens Nursing Home in
Palo Alto her freshman year, was
philanthropy chairman for the
TriDelt sorority and worked as
an unpaid intern in Washington,
D.C., for the Vietnam Veterans
Leadership Program.
The students were both away
from campus for most of the
summer, Porges in China doing
research for an honors thesis in
International Relations and
Kayser working at a New York
bank.
But each continued to contact
potential speakers for the You
Can Make A Difference program.
The guests will include keynote
speaker and women's advocate
Betty Friedan and moderator
Valerie Coleman from KCBS-TV
in Los Angeles.
Both co-organizers have ex
pressed an interest in making a
career of public service.
"I'd like to go into some sort
of health policy, whether it be
be in legislation or non-profit,"
Kayser said. "My ultimate goal is
to get to Washington, D.C."
Porges is considering law
school and an internship in the
nation's capital, but added that
she is "really interested in a lot
of the issues that have come up
in the conference."

primary organizers (and) involve
even more students ... who might
not have been involved in the day
of the conference but who will or
ganize that aspect of it," Porges ex
plained.
Despite all the work that she and
Porges have put into the confer
ence, Kayser is quick to point out
they could not have done it alone.
"We don't want to make it sound
like we do all the work because by
all means there are other people
working, sometimes the same
amount of hours," she said. "I'd say
we have a strong core of 40-50
people who have a definite position
(on a committee). By the day of the
conference we expect (there will
be) 60 or 70 students."
Student involvement in the con
ference runs the gamut from com
piling registration packets to choos
ing the theme for the event.
In deciding on this year's theme,
every student on a committee
talked to three faculty or staff mem
bers and solicited their opinions for
a topic. After two months of weekly
meetings to discuss possibilities,
the theme of families was chosen
"almost unanimously," according to
Kayser. "It was a hot topic," she
?aid.
The organizers expect that both
the participants in the conference
and the community as a whole will
benefit from learning more about
public service opportunities involv
ing family issues.
But Kayser also knows that she
has benefited personally because of
her role in the event.
"You can ask any of us what a
learning experience it has been,
not only organizationally, but in
tellectually — learning about all
these family issues that I admit I
knew nothing about
beforehand," she said.
Purges added that working on
the conference made her realize
"how many other people have
committed their lives (to public
serv ice). It's kind of inspiring to
see."
Both students said they have
no previous experience plan
ning conferences. Each,
however, has been involved
with volunteer projects.
Porges has participated in
several Reach Out Today proj
ects and the Ecumenical Hunger
Project through the Stanford
Volunteer Network. As part of
her Kappa Alpha Theta sorority
activities, she volunteered at the
Stanford Children's Hospital.
Kayser volunteered at the Lu
ton Gardens Nursing Home in
Palo Alto her freshman year, was
philanthropy chairman for the
TriDelt sorority and worked as
an unpaid intern in Washington,
D.C., for the Vietnam Veterans
Leadership Program.
The students were both away
from campus for most of the
summer, Porges in China doing
research for an honors thesis in
International Relations and
Kayser working at a New York
bank.
But each continued to contact
potential speakers for the You
Can Make A Difference program.
The guests will include keynote
speaker and women's advocate
Betty Friedan and moderator
Valerie Coleman from KCBS-TV
in Los Angeles.
Both co-organizers have ex
pressed an interest in making a
career of public service.
"I'd like to go into some sort
of health policy, whether it be
be in legislation or non-profit,"
Kayser said. "My ultimate goal is
to get to Washington, D.C."
Porges is considering law
school and an internship in the
nation's capital, but added that
she is "really interested in a lot
of the issues that have come up
in the conference."
Blue and white posters advertis
ing tomorrow's You Can Make a
Difference conference can be
found on every corner of campus.
But most people are probably un
aware of the behind-the-scenes
work involved in coordinating this
700-person event.
Stanford seniors Jean Kayser and
Jennifer Porges are more than
aware of the complexities involved.
As co-organizers of the conference,
they have been charged with ensur
ing the success of this year's event.
The You Can Make a Difference
conference, open to students and
the community, is a day of
workshops and speakers focusing
on public service opportunities.
This year's theme is "Families In
Transition."
Kayser and Porges are
roommates who became interested
in the conference after taking a
class taught by Catherine Milton, di
rector of the Public Service Center.
Milton was the motivating force in
starting the conference four years
ago, and she warned the students
that planning the conference would
take almost a year from inception to
finish.
The two roommates knew the job
would be too big to handle alone.
"It was the sort of thing where we
looked at each other and said, 'If
you'll do it, I'll do it,' " Kayser said.
Planning the conference is "a
huge job," according to Porges.
Both students said they have spent
about 30 hours a week throughout
the fall and winter quarters organiz
ing the event. On some nights, they
are at the Public Service Center un
til after midnight.
The two students are responsible
for everything from "little details to
deciding what (issues) the speakers
are going to address," Porges said.
The "little details" include publiciz
ing the conference and preparing a
press kit, as well as raising the
$25,000 needed to put on the event.
Part of the funding has been pro
vided by contributions from dormi
tories on campus.
The co-organizers also spend

time holding weekly update
meetings with the 12 student com
mittees helping with the event.
Porges said that when she and
Kayser agreed to organize the
event, one of their goals was that it
be motivated by students and run
by students." To help promote stu
dent interest and involvement, they
decided to change last year's one
day format. This year, the confer
ence includes five pre-conference
workshops at campus residences.
The idea is to "keep students as the
primary organizers (and) involve
even more students ... who might
not have been involved in the day
of the conference but who will or
ganize that aspect of it," Porges ex
