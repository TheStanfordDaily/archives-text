# Stanford alum, launches college magazine that's got panache
## 
### ELIZABETH HENDRICKS 
What do a female rodeo champ, a
prize-winning collegiate author and
Stanford water polo player Dave Im
bernino have in common?
According to 1983 Stanford graduate
Michael Weiss, they all have "panache."
The dictionary defines panache" as
a flamboyant manner or a tuft of feath
ers. In either cxse, the word is an apt
title for a new college magazine that,
according to Weiss, seeks to "feature
students in a glamorous sort of way.
"(Panache) will be distributed free
this week at Stanford and 42 other
campuses across America." said Weiss,
the publisher and editor of Panache
magazine.

You find interesting people on
campus and give them the same
kind of exposure that publications
like People magazine give real-life
celebrities The key is showing
college students in as important a
way as they think they deserve.'

Modeled after Andy Warhol's Inter
view magazine, Panache has a large 11-
by-16 inch format. Photos will present
students "who seem to maintain a bal
ance in life, portray excellence in the
way they look," according to Weiss.
The magazine is a combination of
the recently popular college calenders
(e.g., "The Women of Stanford") and
human interest articles such as those
found in People magazine.
What makes the format of Panache
different from rival college magazines,
according to Weiss, is that "it's not
issue-oriented or full of dry career
stuff."
"Positive and optimistic" is how
Weiss describes his publication.
"It's fun, flashy reading with large
pictures, and that's what college stu
dents want," he said. . A t, < • <nt
Weiss' aim with Panache is to give
college men and women national ex
posure.
"You find interesting people on
campus and give them the same kind

of exposure that publications like
People magazine give real-life
celebrities," he said. "The magazine
gives off the effect of making campus
people seem larger than life, when
really they are just people you see
around your dorms The key is
showing college students in as impor
tant a way as they think they deserve."
Tentatively, Panache will be pub
lished four times a year. Each issue will
be centered around a particular theme.
"High-powered college women" is
the "outstanding personality type" that
will be featured in the first national
issue, Weiss said.
Panache has actually been in exis
tence for several years at Syracuse Uni
versity, where Weiss attended law

school. Even earlier, Panache has its
roots here at Stanford, where Weiss, as
an economics undergraduate,
marketed a similarly inspired publica
tion.
It was at Syracuse that Panache
"went over really big," according to
Weiss. "The student government there
voted unanimously to give $11,000 to
its publication," he said. "This was a
stunning increase from the original
$500 alloted."
This success encouraged Weiss to
expand.The Panache staff now includes
100 writers who maintain close contact
with college campuses and students
across the country.
As for law school, Weiss says,"I
wasn't into it. It was tedious, really
boring."
<■ Still, {Weiss sees his degree as an
"immense help in dealing with
people." He plans to take the bar exam
this Valentine's Day.
At the moment, however, he is con
cerned with the problem in finding

sponsors for his fledgling national
magazine.
Weiss complained that while local
businesses "were easy to get," advertis
ing corporations "just want numbers."
Still, Weiss has been able to improve
the magazine and and use large color
photos by selling advertising space at
$800 per full page.
"Last fall I wrote letters to 70 big ad
vertisers, like Miller Beer and Pizza
Hut and Burger King, and they came
through," he said.
Another concern for Weiss is
"pickup distribution," as opposed to

mail distribution.
"Other college magazines have
begun mailings, but Panache magazine
is so large and flashy, we feel the stu
dent will pick it up," Weiss said. "We
have to convince the advertisers
through strong student response that it
will be picked up."
Despite some difficulties, Weiss ex
presses confidence in the market for
"something very different."
Perhaps "Panache" will be sold by
subscription some day. Right now,
Weiss is biding time, waiting for his
idea to tly.
