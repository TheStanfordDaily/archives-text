# Pisano brings bright outlook to job

### LAURA REED 
Joe Pisano recalled a time when he
had scraped together just enough
money for a plane ticket to Washing
ton, D C., for his fraternity's annual
convention. Though he had no money
in his pocket, he knew he could count
on some of his old brothers to help
him out once he arrived.
, "1 really was very anti-fraternity
when I started college," said Pisano,
'who has been Stanford's fraternal af-
Ifairs adviser for two years. "I changed
{my mind about fraternities when 1 met
■ a group of people whom I admired
Jand who made me feel part of a caring
•community."
• Pisano, whose most noticeable char
acteristics are youthfulness and energy,
•values friendships as the most impor
!tant experience of being in a fraternity.

University as it works with them," he
continued.
"The thing I like best about it is
working with people, trying to make
changes in the University," he said.
"For example, there's a fraternity
member who's interested in getting a
safe-driver program going, so that if
people are at panics on campus and
have driven they can call a number and
someone will pick them up."

and Intersorority Councils, speaking
with alumni and applying the recom
mendations of the recent Task Force

Pisano defines his role in the Univer
sity administration as one of service. "I
see the whole student affairs division
as student services, ideally," he said. "I
hope that people can come in here and
expect first-rate service and get it. It's a
goal for me to keep things on a per
sonal and human level."

nity.'
-Joe Pisano, fraternal affairs adviser

[ As fraternal affairs adviser, Pisano
1 interacts with fraternities somewhat
I differently now. Last year, for example,
J he shared responsibility for dealing
» with the now-unrecognized Delta Up
, silon fraternity.
• 'I m probably best known for
• dealing with problem incidents with
I the fraternities, but this is what I like
» least about my job, and not really what
\ I hoped to do," he said. " As an English
* major I often found myself interested
» in the relationship between fact and
* fiction, and I never thought I would
spend a great deal of my working time
trying to determine the difference be
j tween the two.
"The real purpose of my job is to
provide support and guidance for fra
ternities and sororities, and for the

gained the respect of his associates.
"Joe's a wonderful colleague," said
Norm Robinson, associate dean of Stu
dent Affairs for Residential Education.
"He's engaging, bright and has good
judgment."
Fraternal affairs advising seems like
a natural job for a man who pledged
Theta Delta Chi during his sophomore
year at the University of Rochester and
went on to become president.
Following a short stint as a teacher,
Pisano worked as a traveling consultant
for the central office of Theta Delta
Chi. During his two years traveling
around the country, collecting dues,
advising chapters and compiling
reports on fraternities, he decided to
apply for a more stable position as
fraternal affairs coordinator at Wash

ington University in St. Louis.
The next year, he came to Stanford.
In spite of his job, Pisano still retains
his ties to his fraternity, volunteering as
national president of Theta Delta Chi.
"My board supervises central office
staff and gives direction to the future of
the organization," he said. "It's both a
perk in that I get to travel to wonderful
cities, and a drawback because it takes
a lot of time. I use my vacations for it."
But fraternities don't take all of his
time.
One of his chief personal interests is
reading. "I read fairly eclectically —
the last few books I've read have in
cluded 'Percy's Love in the Ruins,' two
Graham Greene novels, and All the
King's Men.'
Pisano's own philosophy and atti
tudes are optimistic.
"Life is a good thing for me. I do
work that I think has value and I think
that's important," he said. "I'm also op
timistic in that I believe people are ba
sically good — they may be flawed in
some way but as William Saroyan says

I think that you can awaken the nobility
and goodness in them."
The year after he graduated from
college, Pisano taught in an inner city
tutorial center for functionally illiterate
13- to 19-year-olds who had been
suspended from other programs.
"It had an unfortunate ending —
one of my colleagues was stabbed and
killed in the classroom by one of the
kids," he said. "It was certainly a turn
ing point for me to think about what I
wanted to be doing—
"A friend asked me, 'What do you
think is the most important human
trait?' I think you have to have compas
sion because life is incredibly complex
and people make it even more compli
cated because of their own history and
emotions. So I think you have to be
slow to anger and treat people with un
derstanding."
Pisano offered a quotation from the
preface of William Saroyan's "The
Time of Your Life" as "the closest thing
I might have to a credo." Part of the
quote reads: "In the time of your life,

live — so that in that wondrous time
you shall not add to the misery and
sorrow of the world but shall smile to
the infinite delight and mystery of it."
Pisano intends eventually to study
literature or theology full time as a
graduate student, possibly at Washing
ton University in St. Louis, where he
was enrolled shortly before accepting
his position at Stanford.
"It's getting to be about the time that
I go back. (But) it will almost be like
going through a divorce because I
won't have the time to stay involved
with the fraternity," he said.
"Certainly, I see myself doing some
thing within a university community in
the distant future," he continued. "I
like the idea of staying in student
services and perhaps teaching as well
"Someone once hurled as an accusa
tion at me, 'You want to have your cake
and eat it too!' I said Of course I do!
Isn't that what every sane human being
wants to do?' So in terms of the schol
arly and the administrative, I do want
both."

for the central office of Theta Delta
Chi. During his two years traveling
around the country, collecting dues,
advising chapters and compiling
reports on fraternities, he decided to
apply for a more stable position as
fraternal affairs coordinator at Wash

ington University in St. Louis.
The next year, he came to Stanford.
In spite of his job, Pisano still retains
his ties to his fraternity, volunteering as
national president of Theta Delta Chi.
"My board supervises central office
staff and gives direction to the future of
the organization," he said. "It's both a
perk in that I get to travel to wonderful
cities, and a drawback because it takes
a lot of time. I use my vacations for it."
But fraternities don't take all of his
time.
One of his chief personal interests is
reading. "I read fairly eclectically —
the last few books I've read have in
cluded 'Percy's Love in the Ruins,' two
Graham Greene novels, and All the
King's Men.'
Pisano's own philosophy and atti
tudes are optimistic.
"Life is a good thing for me. I do
work that I think has value and I think
that's important," he said. "I'm also op
timistic in that I believe people are ba
sically good — they may be flawed in
some way but as William Saroyan says

I think that you can awaken the nobility
and goodness in them."
The year after he graduated from
college, Pisano taught in an inner city
tutorial center for functionally illiterate
13- to 19-year-olds who had been
suspended from other programs.
"It had an unfortunate ending —
one of my colleagues was stabbed and
killed in the classroom by one of the
kids," he said. "It was certainly a turn
ing point for me to think about what I
wanted to be doing—
"A friend asked me, 'What do you
think is the most important human
trait?' I think you have to have compas
sion because life is incredibly complex
and people make it even more compli
cated because of their own history and
emotions. So I think you have to be
slow to anger and treat people with un
derstanding."
Pisano offered a quotation from the
preface of William Saroyan's "The
Time of Your Life" as "the closest thing
I might have to a credo." Part of the
quote reads: "In the time of your life,

live — so that in that wondrous time
you shall not add to the misery and
sorrow of the world but shall smile to
the infinite delight and mystery of it."
Pisano intends eventually to study
literature or theology full time as a
graduate student, possibly at Washing
ton University in St. Louis, where he
was enrolled shortly before accepting
his position at Stanford.
"It's getting to be about the time that
I go back. (But) it will almost be like
going through a divorce because I
won't have the time to stay involved
with the fraternity," he said.
"Certainly, I see myself doing some
thing within a university community in
the distant future," he continued. "I
like the idea of staying in student
services and perhaps teaching as well
"Someone once hurled as an accusa
tion at me, 'You want to have your cake
and eat it too!' I said Of course I do!
Isn't that what every sane human being
wants to do?' So in terms of the schol
arly and the administrative, I do want
both."

As University fraternal affairs adviser and president of the national chapter of Theta Delta Chi fraternity, Joe Pisano

had scraped together just enough

convention. Though he had no money
in his pocket, he knew he could count
on some of his old brothers to help
