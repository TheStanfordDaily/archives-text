## Bon Jovi on stage: spandex and hysteria 
### LIZ GOODMAN 
"! will never open for anyone again
as long as I live," Jon Bon Jovi had said
in an interview following his band's
last tour as an opening a« for Ratt. "1
love to play, and I've sold a million al
bums this year (1985), and I know
there's a Bon Jovi army out there
waiting to be had.'"
At last Saturday night's concert at the
Cow Palace, it looked as if Bon Jovi's
prophesied troops had arrived in full
force. Two hours before the show, the
parking lot was a madhouse and a line
of screaming fans, 50 people wide, en
circled the building. A devastated
looking teen holding a sign that read,
"Help! I need a ticket," was just one of
many still hoping in vain for a chance
to see the show. Inside, a single high
pitched scream from the front sent the
crowd into a frenzy. Scrambling to get
closer, a mass of writhing bodies
packed against the stage. It was just
after 6:30, an hour and a half before
even the opening act would take the
stage.
Just a year ago, the rock group Bon
Jovi hadn't been nearly such a big deal.
But with their latest album, "Slippery
When Wet," at number one on Bill
board's charts, and having been voted
best band of the year in Rolling Stone's
annual Reader's Poll, it's obvious that
Bon Jovi has reached the heights of
success. So not surprisingly, Saturday
night's concert was a sellout in the
truest sense of the term. With the gen
eral admission seating, people were
crammed onto every inch of the floor,
all of the aisles and every seat. There
just wasn't any room to move in, but al
most nobody seemed to mind. A kind
of Bon Jovi hysteria gripped many fans
(especially female) as they anxiously
waited for the band to take the stage.
A litde after nine, the group came
on. Jumping into the anthemic "Raise
Your Hands," Bon Jovi set the pace for
the evening, captivating the audience
and making most oblivious to the over
crowded conditions. Lead singer Jon
Bon Jovi was in fine form, wearing
skin-tight, zebra-striped spandex pants,
a ripped T-shirt and an assortment of
leather and denim jackets. Oh, and he
didn't sound bad either.
In all seriousness though, the good
looking singer has always been the
main force behind the band, and for a
person who has millions of fans, both

male and female, and who has been
called both a sex symbol and a teen
idol, he is remarkably down-to-earth.
His good-natured attitude came across
while he constantly traversed the stage,
stopping between songs to tell stories.
(Such as the one about his relationship
with a girl he met in Vancouver; it
served as the intro for "You Give Love
a Bad Name.")
He kept up a friendly rapport with
the audience, not letting his popularity
put a distance between him and the
crowd. "We try and talk to, not at, our
audience," Bon Jovi had stressed in the
1985 interview. "It's important for me
to try and jump down into the audi
ence."
Bon Jovi was able to do much more
than that this year. Calling out for his
"chariot," he grabbed hold of a rope
that was suspended from the ceiling
and swung out, just feet above his
upreaching fans, to a platform near the
back of the arena. Once there, he
picked up his acoustic guitar and per
formed the more sensitive "Silent
Night," which he dedicated to the
people in the back of the Cow Palace.
He also began his latest hit, "Livin' On
a Prayer," which he dedicated to "Gina,
wherever you are tonight."
The rest of the band — keyboard
player David Bryan, drummer Tico
Torres, bassist Alec John Such and
guitarist Richie Sambora did their
share as they played some older
favorites like "Runaway" and some
newer ones like "In and Out of Love."
During the encore, they did a cover of
the Dobie Gray hit "Drift Away,"
during which the multi-talented Sam
bora took over some of the lead vocals.
Sitting down, wearing a cowboy hat,
Sambora also began the guitar parts for
the western-sounding "Dead or Alive";
Bon Jovi joined in with an acoustic
guitar amidst a cloud of smoke that
poured out onto the front rows of the
audience.
Bon Jovi concluded the evening with
"Get Ready," and as the Bon Jovi forces
retreated — undoubtedly pleased with
their leader's performance — it
seemed likely that the legions would
be ready for anything Bon Jovi asked of
them.
An aside: Readers may recall an arti
cle of a few weeks back, "Hard Rock
meets responsibility in Cinderella"
(Daily, Jan. 6). Well, Cinderella, who
opened for Bon Jovi, proved the truth

behind those words once again last
Saturday night. Lead singer Tom Keifer
stopped the band in the middle of
their set because a youth on die floor
lit a firecracker. Keifer refused to con
tinue until security removed the
prankster, and (in much rougher lan-,

guage than can be printed here) he
discouraged others from doing the
same. It was definitely an impressive
display — making more than 20,000
people wait; that's not something you
would do unless you're truly commit
ted to the safety of your fans.

The rest of the band — keyboard
player David Bryan, drummer Tico
Torres, bassist Alec John Such and
guitarist Richie Sambora did their
share as they played some older
favorites like "Runaway" and some
newer ones like "In and Out of Love."
During the encore, they did a cover of
the Dobie Gray hit "Drift Away,"
during which the multi-talented Sam
bora took over some of the lead vocals.
Sitting down, wearing a cowboy hat,
Sambora also began the guitar parts for
the western-sounding "Dead or Alive";
Bon Jovi joined in with an acoustic
guitar amidst a cloud of smoke that
poured out onto the front rows of the
audience.
Bon Jovi concluded the evening with
"Get Ready," and as the Bon Jovi forces
retreated — undoubtedly pleased with
their leader's performance — it
seemed likely that the legions would
be ready for anything Bon Jovi asked of
them.
An aside: Readers may recall an arti
cle of a few weeks back, "Hard Rock
meets responsibility in Cinderella"
(Daily, Jan. 6). Well, Cinderella, who
opened for Bon Jovi, proved the truth

behind those words once again last
Saturday night. Lead singer Tom Keifer
stopped the band in the middle of
their set because a youth on die floor
lit a firecracker. Keifer refused to con
tinue until security removed the
prankster, and (in much rougher lan-,

guage than can be printed here) he
discouraged others from doing the
same. It was definitely an impressive
display — making more than 20,000
people wait; that's not something you
would do unless you're truly commit
ted to the safety of your fans.

Jon Bon Jovi displays the qualities that have made him a teen idol. The
group Bon Jovi just won the annual Rolling Stone Reader's Poll for Best
Band and have a number one album, "Slippery When Wet."
"! will never open for anyone again
as long as I live," Jon Bon Jovi had said
in an interview following his band's
last tour as an opening a« for Ratt. "1
love to play, and I've sold a million al
bums this year (1985), and I know
there's a Bon Jovi army out there
waiting to be had.'"
At last Saturday night's concert at the
Cow Palace, it looked as if Bon Jovi's
prophesied troops had arrived in full
force. Two hours before the show, the
parking lot was a madhouse and a line
of screaming fans, 50 people wide, en
circled the building. A devastated
looking teen holding a sign that read,
"Help! I need a ticket," was just one of
many still hoping in vain for a chance
to see the show. Inside, a single high
pitched scream from the front sent the
crowd into a frenzy. Scrambling to get
closer, a mass of writhing bodies
packed against the stage. It was just
after 6:30, an hour and a half before
even the opening act would take the
stage.
Just a year ago, the rock group Bon
Jovi hadn't been nearly such a big deal.
But with their latest album, "Slippery
When Wet," at number one on Bill
board's charts, and having been voted
best band of the year in Rolling Stone's
annual Reader's Poll, it's obvious that
Bon Jovi has reached the heights of
success. So not surprisingly, Saturday
night's concert was a sellout in the
truest sense of the term. With the gen
eral admission seating, people were
crammed onto every inch of the floor,
all of the aisles and every seat. There
just wasn't any room to move in, but al
most nobody seemed to mind. A kind
of Bon Jovi hysteria gripped many fans
(especially female) as they anxiously
waited for the band to take the stage.
A litde after nine, the group came
on. Jumping into the anthemic "Raise
Your Hands," Bon Jovi set the pace for
the evening, captivating the audience
and making most oblivious to the over
crowded conditions. Lead singer Jon
Bon Jovi was in fine form, wearing
skin-tight, zebra-striped spandex pants,
a ripped T-shirt and an assortment of
leather and denim jackets. Oh, and he
didn't sound bad either.
In all seriousness though, the good
looking singer has always been the
main force behind the band, and for a
person who has millions of fans, both

male and female, and who has been
called both a sex symbol and a teen
idol, he is remarkably down-to-earth.
His good-natured attitude came across
while he constantly traversed the stage,
stopping between songs to tell stories.
(Such as the one about his relationship
with a girl he met in Vancouver; it
served as the intro for "You Give Love
a Bad Name.")
He kept up a friendly rapport with
the audience, not letting his popularity
put a distance between him and the
crowd. "We try and talk to, not at, our
audience," Bon Jovi had stressed in the
1985 interview. "It's important for me
to try and jump down into the audi
ence."
Bon Jovi was able to do much more
than that this year. Calling out for his
"chariot," he grabbed hold of a rope
that was suspended from the ceiling
and swung out, just feet above his
upreaching fans, to a platform near the
back of the arena. Once there, he
picked up his acoustic guitar and per
formed the more sensitive "Silent
Night," which he dedicated to the
people in the back of the Cow Palace.
He also began his latest hit, "Livin' On
a Prayer," which he dedicated to "Gina,
wherever you are tonight."
The rest of the band — keyboard
player David Bryan, drummer Tico
Torres, bassist Alec John Such and
guitarist Richie Sambora did their
