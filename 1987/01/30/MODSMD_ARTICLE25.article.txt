# 'Beyond' good taste
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Pablo Picasso once said, "Good
taste is the chief enemy of
creativity." That axiom has been
delightfully taken to heart by direc
tor Stuart Gordon. For those who
missed out, Gordon co-wrote and
directed the horror movie "Re-
Animator" in 1985; he now has a
follow-up, "From Beyond."
Gordon's two movies are proof
that nothing succeeds like excess.
The X-rated "Re-Animator" has
gained a notorious reputation, and
with good reason. Based on a story
by H.P. Lovecraft, it depicts the ef
forts of an earnest young medical
student (Jeffrey Combs) to prove
that dead tissue can be brought
back to life. It can, of course, and bv

Repression and gratification.

the movie's climax an entire
morgue is up and about. Along the
way a lot of horrible, fiendish and
perverse things happen. The funny
thing is, "Re-Animator" is a farce.
It's the first slapstick horror movie,
simultaneously good-natured and
bad-mannered, like a big, friendly
dog. It gleefully goes right up to the
limits of good taste and then goes
way past them. If you have access to
a VCR, see "Re-Animator;" you
might just die laughing.
"From Beyond" is a bit more
strait-laced than "Re-Animator" —
Gordon didn't want to get an 'X'
rating this time around — but it's
still pretty amazing. It's gross, kinky
and good fun. And I mean REALLY
gross. Based on another Lovecraft
story, it tells the story of a whacked
out scientist named Dr. Pretorius
(Ted Sorel) who builds a machine
called a resonator. This devilish
creation stimulates a dormant sen
sory organ in the brain, the pineal
gland; stimulation of the pineal
gland allows Pretorius to tap into a
dimension just parallel to our own,
where the air vibrates with slimy
creatures and where the human sex
drive starts working overtime.
Pretorius, a real pervert to begin

with, goes too far in his experi
ments and gets taken "beyond." He
returns, only now he's able to mold
his flesh to suit his every desire.
And desire he has plenty of, thanks
to his newly awakened pineal
gland. This means trouble for
Pretorius' assistant, Dr. Tillinghast
(Jeffrey Combs, in another star
turn) and a female psychiatrist, Dr.
MacMannon (Barbara Crampton,
another "Re-Animator" veteran).
No plot summary could really do
justice to what happens when
Pretorius returns "from beyond."
Reality turns to rubber: By the end
of the movie all the characters are
so steeped in blood and slime
they're unrecognizable. The whole
movie is slimy — downright ICKY,
in fact.
But never stupid. In his deter-

mination to gratify all his urges,
Pretorius brings disaster down on
everyone around him. Without ever
getting pretentious about it,"From
Beyond" looks at repression and
gratification, and the consequences
of each when they're taken tot) far.
Needless to say, there's a lot of lurid
fun to be had with this kind of ma
terial. For instance, when it comes
out how the pineal gland affects
sexual behavior, you just know that
Barbara Crampton's buttoned-up
psychiatrist character is going to get
a drastic change of image. And then,
whammo! Her hair comes down,
her glasses get chucked out the
window, and she's dressing like a
bondage queen. Ed Meese would
definitely not approve of this
movie.
Stuart Gordon is a talented direc
tor: He knows that horror movies
can be both funny and subversive in
a way that straight, 'acceptable'
movies can't. He also gets some
marvelous performances out of his
actors; Combs and Crampton
deserve Oscars for taking so much
abuse, both here and in"Re-
Animator." What more could you
ask for? For a really disgusting good
time, see "From Beyond."
