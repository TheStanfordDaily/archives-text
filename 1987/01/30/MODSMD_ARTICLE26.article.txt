## OSU's 71-59 victory drops Stanford to 5-5 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — Oregon State showed why it is one of
the top defensive teams in the Pacific 10 Conference last
night at Gill Coliseum in the Beavers "1-59 win over Stan
ford (11-8, 5-5). The win moved OSL' (14-4. "'-3) into first
place in the Pac-10.
OSU's quick man-to-man defense forced the Cardinal out
of its usual offense and into several turnovers, while Jose
Ortiz took care of the Beavers' offense.
Ortiz, a senior center from Puerto Rico, finished 8 of 11
from the floor and 6 of 11 from the line for 22 points to lead
all scorers. The 6-foot-10 Ortiz also had a game-high 14
rebounds. This marks the sixth game this year that Ortiz has
had a double-double, and is the 14th game in which he has
scored 20 points.
Ortiz also won the heated battle going on under the bas
ket, as Greg Butler and Eric Reveno both fouled out trying
to hold Ortiz in check. Ortiz, however, collected only three
fouls on the night.
"Ortiz is a very good player," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "He knows how to do the little things. He
has great international basketball experience. He knows
how to hide the little pushes."
Butler was a little more explicit in his assessment of play
under the basket. "Jose was pretty good," Butler said, "but
they (the referees) gave him way too much leeway. He was

throwing the initial blows and throwing elbows, and they
don't call a thing on him. You touch Jose, and they call a foul
on you immediately. If you can't touch the guy, he can score
40 — there's got to be a little contact.
"I thought it was a poor job of officiating," Butler added.
"Especially on defense. Guarding Ortiz, you're at a disad
vantage already. If you can't touch the guy, he'll turn and
score all night. The officials got me for nothing. All the fouls
they got me for were not fouls in my mind."
Butler hit 3 of 5 from the field and 2 of 2 from the line to
finish with eight points and eight rebounds before fouling
out with 5:05 remaining. Butler, who had not missed a start
until last week's game at Arizona State when he was out with
the flu, again was replaced in the starting lineup by Reveno,
who also scored eight points, all in the first half, on 4 of 9
shooting. Reveno, however, did not grab any rebounds.
The 6-11 Butler, who had averaged only 3.3 points in his
previous three games, was pleased with his performance. "I
thought I played well," Butler said. "When I got the shot, I
hit it, and I thought I went to the boards really well—
You're never happy about not starting, but I understand
why. Eric's been playing well, and I got sick— When Eric
plays well, you've got to go with him."
Montgomery liked the forward's defense. "Greg, in a
man-to-man, is probably our best defensive player," he said.
"He's competitive, and he's got the best size. I thought he

Junior Eric Reveno led Stanford with eight points in the first half last night, but he was held scoreless in the second
half and fouled out of the Cardinal's 71-59 loss at Oregon State.
