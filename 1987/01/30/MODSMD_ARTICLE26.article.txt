## OSU's 71-59 victory drops Stanford to 5-5 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — Oregon State showed why it is one of
the top defensive teams in the Pacific 10 Conference last
night at Gill Coliseum in the Beavers "1-59 win over Stan
ford (11-8, 5-5). The win moved OSL' (14-4. "'-3) into first
place in the Pac-10.
OSU's quick man-to-man defense forced the Cardinal out
of its usual offense and into several turnovers, while Jose
Ortiz took care of the Beavers' offense.
Ortiz, a senior center from Puerto Rico, finished 8 of 11
from the floor and 6 of 11 from the line for 22 points to lead
all scorers. The 6-foot-10 Ortiz also had a game-high 14
rebounds. This marks the sixth game this year that Ortiz has
had a double-double, and is the 14th game in which he has
scored 20 points.
Ortiz also won the heated battle going on under the bas
ket, as Greg Butler and Eric Reveno both fouled out trying
to hold Ortiz in check. Ortiz, however, collected only three
fouls on the night.
"Ortiz is a very good player," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "He knows how to do the little things. He
has great international basketball experience. He knows
how to hide the little pushes."
Butler was a little more explicit in his assessment of play
under the basket. "Jose was pretty good," Butler said, "but
they (the referees) gave him way too much leeway. He was

throwing the initial blows and throwing elbows, and they
don't call a thing on him. You touch Jose, and they call a foul
on you immediately. If you can't touch the guy, he can score
40 — there's got to be a little contact.
"I thought it was a poor job of officiating," Butler added.
"Especially on defense. Guarding Ortiz, you're at a disad
vantage already. If you can't touch the guy, he'll turn and
score all night. The officials got me for nothing. All the fouls
they got me for were not fouls in my mind."
Butler hit 3 of 5 from the field and 2 of 2 from the line to
finish with eight points and eight rebounds before fouling
out with 5:05 remaining. Butler, who had not missed a start
until last week's game at Arizona State when he was out with
the flu, again was replaced in the starting lineup by Reveno,
who also scored eight points, all in the first half, on 4 of 9
shooting. Reveno, however, did not grab any rebounds.
The 6-11 Butler, who had averaged only 3.3 points in his
previous three games, was pleased with his performance. "I
thought I played well," Butler said. "When I got the shot, I
hit it, and I thought I went to the boards really well—
You're never happy about not starting, but I understand
why. Eric's been playing well, and I got sick— When Eric
plays well, you've got to go with him."
Montgomery liked the forward's defense. "Greg, in a
man-to-man, is probably our best defensive player," he said.
"He's competitive, and he's got the best size. I thought he

Junior Eric Reveno led Stanford with eight points in the first half last night, but he was held scoreless in the second
half and fouled out of the Cardinal's 71-59 loss at Oregon State.
did a good job on Ortiz."
Ortiz was not the only problem that Stanford faced,
however. The OSU guard tandem of freshman Gary Payton
and sophomore Eric Knox pressured Stanford's outside
shooters to such an extent that the Cardinal had almost no
scoring from the perimeter.
Point guard Terry Taylor scored just two points, although
he had 10 assists, and Novian Whitsitt was 3 of 10 for six
points. Scott Meinert, who filled in for Taylor when the
sophomore got into foul trouble in the second half, was 1
for 3 from the floor and 4 of 4 from the line for six points as
well.
Knox and Payton, on the other hand, finished with 16 and
14 points, respectively, and Payton added nine assists. "Gary
Payton is a fine player," Montgomery said. "He did a super
job. He handles the ball well and runs the club; he has tre
mendous poise for a freshman. He put tremendous pres
sure on our point guard." ;

Todd Lichti quietly led Stanford with 18 points after
scoring only five in the first half. Howard Wright led the
Cardinal with nine rebounds and added eight points.
A sloppy, foul-plagued first half finished with the teams
knotted at 27. The Beavers shot only 38 percent in the half.
The second half was the difference. OSU hit 75 percent of
its free throws and shot 62 percent from the floor, against
Stanford's 35 percent. The Beavers gained the lead in the
opening minutes of the second half, going up 34-33 with
15:26 left on an Ortiz shot off the glass. Eric Martin followed
with a layup for the Beavers, and Oregon State never looked
back.
"We were in the game; we had a chance," Montgomery
said. "But to win on the road, we have to be better We
do things that show a lack of experience, we get impatient
on defense and offense. But that's the nature of the game."
The win over Stanford did more than that for die Beavers,
who moved into first place in the Pac-10, following UCLA's
95-87 loss to Washington and California's 86-73 loss at
Oregon. •;
Stanford takes on Oregon Sunday at McArthur Court at 3
p.m. The game will be televised on KPIX (channel 5) and
