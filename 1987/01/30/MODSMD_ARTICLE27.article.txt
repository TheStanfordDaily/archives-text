# Card women in Oregon for crucial Pac-10 games
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
The Pacific 10 Conference
women's basketball teams are still
playing the first half of the league
season, but it wouldn't be unreason
able to say that the Stanford Cardinal
has reached the do-or-die part of its
schedule.
Stanford has used a four-game
Pac-10 win streak to move into third
place in the conference at 5-2, just
one game behind co-leaders USC
and Washington.
-- But now the Cardinal (11-6 over
all) must hit the road foe games
'against four of the Pac-10's elite
teams. The road test begins tonight
at Oregon State at 6:30 and continues
tomorrow night at Oregon at 7.30.
nnd the Ducks
are breathing down the Cardinal's
neck, sitting in a tie for fourth place
with UCLA at 4-3.
Stanford's hopes of beating OSU
(13-4 overall) tonight rest on stop
ping the Beavers' potent backcourt
tandem of Monica Raspberry and
Chelle Flamoe. Raspberry leads OSU
in scoring at 17 points per game, fol
lowed by Flamoe at 16.7. In last Sat
urday's 74-68 victory at Washington
State, Flamoe led the Beavers with 19
points.
Oregon (11-5 overall) is also
strong at the guard position. Lauri
Landerholm leads the Ducks in
scoring at 18.3 points per game, and
in last Thursday's 101-55 blowout at
WSU, she was literally perfect,
making 11 of 11 field goals and hit
ting all five of her free throws for 27
points.
The Ducks are also bolstered by a
pair of West Germans. Forward Gabi
Neumann averages 15-3 points per
game, and center Stefanie Kasperski
adds 9.5.
Stanford will counter the strong
backcourts of OSU and Oregon with
a talented guard of its own — fresh
man Jennifer Azzi. Azzi was the Pac
-10 Player of the Week after scoring

Point guard Jennifer Azzi, named Pac-10 Player of the Week after a pair of
games in which she scored 34 points and dished out 21 assists, will look to
lead the Cardinal past Oregon State tonight.
34 points and-passing for 21 assists last
week in a pair of Cardinal victories.
Already the Stanford recordholder
for most assists in a game (16 against

Brigham Young on Jan. 15), Azzi will
break the season record for assists if
she keeps up her pace of 6.9 per game.
Another freshman, forward Katy
Steding, has been vital to the Cardinal
attack this season. Steding leads Stan
ford in rebounding at 7.9 per game
and is the team's second-leading
scorer (11.9 ppg).
