### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Entering as the underdog in its first
league match ever, the Stanford men's
volleyball team lost to UC-Santa Bar
bara in a shutout, 15-13, 15-11, 15-12,
last night at Maples Pavilion.
Playing before a rowdy Stanford
crowd, the Cardinal jumped into the
match, taking a 5-0 lead within the first
three minutes of play. When the
Gauchos caught up at 5-5, the teams
fought closely throughout the
remainder of the first game, eventually
tying at 13-all. On a controversial call
against Stanford's Scott Fortune, UCSB
was awarded a point and went on to
5 win the first game. -; \ j
1 Clearly, the Cardinal's hitting '• and
blocking errors forced its next two
losses. "The games were close, but we
had a lot of untimely errors," said Stan
ford Coach Fred Sturm.
iTie Cardinal's 31 hitting errors in
contrast to the Gauchos' mere 17 were
Stanford's downfall. "Tonight, we beat
ourselves," Sturm said.
With 10 serving errors and nine
blocking errors in three relatively
short games, the team was frustrated
with its performance. "Our blocking
was the problem. It was a matter of or
ganization, something we need to
work on as a team," said senior Steve
Modory, who started the match as Stan
ford's setter.
"It's frustrating because we know we
have the potential, we know we can do
it, but we beat ourselves," said fresh
man setter Parker Blackman, who
replaced Modory in the third game.
Averaging a .228 hitting percentage
for the three games, the Cardinal was
outplayed by UCSB, which has beaten
No. 1-ranked UCLA twice this season.
"We knew Santa Barbara was a fine
team," Sturm said.
UCSB's unity and consistency,
shown by a .308 team hitting
percentage, were attributable to senior
John Kosty and setter Jon Wallace, a
junior. Kosty, a preseason All-America,
dominated the match with 18 kills to
only three errors. In contrast, Stan
ford's key player, outside hitter Scott
Fortune, committed 10 errors, the

Rob Peterson (six kills for a .600 hitting percentage) was one of the only
Stanford spikers without a hitting error in last night's 15-13, 15-11, 15-12
loss to UCSB at Maples. The Cardinal had 31 hitting errors in the match.
highest in the match.
The Cardinal began the match with
its lineup of veteran players —
Modorv, Fortune, Stephen Blue (who
had a match high of 11 digs), John
McDermott and Rob Peterson — and
freshman Craig Forsyth.
Through a series of substitutions,
testing the depth of the team's 12
strong players, Sturm had the chance
to play various lineups. "We have so
many good players that we can always
bring guys in and out. If one of us is
not playing well, we can bring in an
other," said Forsyth, the 6-foot-3 new
comer from Santa Monica.
Unlike the experienced Santa Bar
bara team, the Cardinal has a newer,
relatively inexperienced team that
needs the playing time together. With

the Gauchos ahead 11-8 at the end of
the final game, all four freshmen —
Forsyth, Blackmail, Dan Hanan and
Kent Steffes — faced the Gauchos.
This freshman connection along
with veterans Fortune and Blue were
able to delay the Gauchos the match
victory for more than five minutes of
play. "The fact that we have four fresh
men who can play well is one of the
strengths of our team,'" Forsyth said.
With a 7-3 overall match record, the
Cardinal goes on to play San Diego
State tonight at 7:00 at Maples Pavilion
and Chico State tomorrow afternoon at
3:00, also at Maples. "Tomorrow
(tonight) we have to put this match be
hind us and prepare ourselves for San
Diego State," Sturm said.
Sturm has not had the chance to
watch either team in preseason play.
"We don't know anything about San
Diego or Chico, which means that we
can focus on our side of the net,"
Sturm said.
