schedule this weekend, hosting Santa
Clara in a pair of games today and Sun
day at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford got in rwo games of a three
game set with San Jose State last week,
losing its season-opener for the first
time since 19*74 by a 2-1 score at
Municipal Stadium, then coming back
on Monday at Sunken Diamond to
blast the Spartans 7-1.
The third game of the series was
twice canceled, first on Saturday due to
rain, then on Wednesday because of
wet grounds.
Todays weather may cooperate, but
it will be far from what the boys of
summer would like. Expected showers
this morning should taper off by after
noon, but a chance of thundershowers
will remain, and temperatures in the
mid-50s with 20-mile-per-hour winds
will keep the suntan crowd on the
third-base hillside to a minimum for
the 2 p.m. start.
