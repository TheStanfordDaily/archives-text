# Fourth-ranked USC, fifth-ranked UCLA women at DeGuerre

### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
While the Farm remains mired in
the dead of winter, the Stanford
women's swimming team already
seems to he rounding into the late
season form of spring and has two rival
coaches talking of a possible national
championship for the second-ranked
Cardinal.
USC Coach Don Lamont and t'CLA
Coach Tom Jahn, who are bringing
their squads for dual meets at 2 p.m.
today and noon tomorrow at
DeGuerre Pool, have great respect for
Stanford Coach George Haines' group
of swimmers.
"I've watched (two-time defending
national champion) Texas, and they're
good, but they're not great
everywhere," Jahn said Stanford, on
the other hand, I saw their times
against Arizona, and I'm looking for
Stanford to Teally be the team to beat at
the end."
Lamont simply characterized the

Cardinal as "loaded" and added, "It's
almost unfair."
Before Stanford begins to entertain
visions of a possible national champi
onship, though, it must first contend
with the No. 4 Trojans and No. 5
Bruins.
USC will be kxiking for an upset
when it hits the pool this afternoon.
Vfhile Stanford has continued to train
heavily, Lamont reported that he has
had his charges taper their workouts
this week in preparation for the Card
inal and tomorrow's meet at California.
Lamont has also added a talented
group of freshmen to a team that was
shelled 103-37 in Los Angeles last year
by Stanford. The cupboard was by no
means bare either as the Trojans boast
a pair of Olympians in Anne Ottenbrite
and Cynthia "Sippy" Woodhead
Ottenbrite brought gold and silver
medals back to her native Canada in
1984 and should push Stanford Olym
pian Susan Rapp in the breaststroke
