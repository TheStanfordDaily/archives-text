# Fourth-ranked USC, fifth-ranked UCLA women at DeGuerre
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
While the Farm remains mired in
the dead of winter, the Stanford
women's swimming team already
seems to he rounding into the late
season form of spring and has two rival
coaches talking of a possible national
championship for the second-ranked
Cardinal.
USC Coach Don Lamont and t'CLA
Coach Tom Jahn, who are bringing
their squads for dual meets at 2 p.m.
today and noon tomorrow at
DeGuerre Pool, have great respect for
Stanford Coach George Haines' group
of swimmers.
"I've watched (two-time defending
national champion) Texas, and they're
good, but they're not great
everywhere," Jahn said Stanford, on
the other hand, I saw their times
against Arizona, and I'm looking for
Stanford to Teally be the team to beat at
the end."
Lamont simply characterized the

Cardinal as "loaded" and added, "It's
almost unfair."
Before Stanford begins to entertain
visions of a possible national champi
onship, though, it must first contend
with the No. 4 Trojans and No. 5
Bruins.
USC will be kxiking for an upset
when it hits the pool this afternoon.
Vfhile Stanford has continued to train
heavily, Lamont reported that he has
had his charges taper their workouts
this week in preparation for the Card
inal and tomorrow's meet at California.
Lamont has also added a talented
group of freshmen to a team that was
shelled 103-37 in Los Angeles last year
by Stanford. The cupboard was by no
means bare either as the Trojans boast
a pair of Olympians in Anne Ottenbrite
and Cynthia "Sippy" Woodhead
Ottenbrite brought gold and silver
medals back to her native Canada in
1984 and should push Stanford Olym
pian Susan Rapp in the breaststroke
Woodhead, who transfered from Texas
during her freshman year, is expected
to compete in the individual medleys
and middle distance freestyle events.
Among the newcomers to the Trojan
lineup is Lisa Dorman, who copped
seventh in the 50-yard freestyle at this
summer s World Championships, and
a trio of Goodwill Games competitors,
Leslie Daland, Kathy Hettche and Terri
O'Loughlin
Daland (800 and 1,500) and Hettche
(400) combined to put a hammerlock
on the middle and long distance
freestyle championships in Moscow.
L'CLA also has a wealth of freshmen
with 12 newcomers in its lineup, and,
while the Bruins will look to improve
on the 102-38 drubbing they received
at the hands of Stanford last year, Jahn
said of the Cardinal, "Realistically,
we're not in their league.
"We've got a young team I think
we've got the potential to be pretty
good. This weekend will tell me a lot.
It they can come in and race Stanford
then we'll be pretty good."
There are some talented athletes on
a UCLA team that captured sixth in last
year's NCAA championships. Missy
Herndon is the Bruins' big gun, and
she will contend in the 200, 500 and
1,000 freestyles. In fact, the race of the
day could come in the 200. Herndon
boasts a 1:49 clocking in the event,
while Stanford's Jenna Johnson, who
took second in the NCAA 200 last
season, has a top mark of 1:49.86.
Also expected to give Stanford trou
ble are UCLA divers Karla Goltman and
Britt Williams. The duo recently
defeated the Cardinal divers in Las

Vegas, Nev . and according to Jahn are
really good."
For its part, the Cardinal is in the
midst of a stretch of hard training that
will continue through mid-February,
but has nonetheless managed to hit 11
qualifying times for the NG\As and will
be looking to reach more this
weekend.
Haines is pleased by the progress
made by both his recruits and veterans
Our freshman group has been
doing really well. Haines said.
"(Freshman) Michelle Grtglione is
swimming right at the top of her form.
"We probably have the best back
stroke group in the country, (and
freestylist) Aimee Berzins has been
swimming particularly well
The Cardinal s depth will play an
even more important role in tomor
rows meet as a new scoring system
will be used. Typically, relays are
scored 7-0, and individuals are
awarded 5-3-1 for first through third
places. However, UCLA has chosen to
go with a new point system that in
volves 9-4-2 scoring for relays and ~-4-
3-2-1 for individual events
The scoring change was added to
the NCAA rule book this year in an at
tempt to get more competitors in
volved. However, it could also bring
about the odd situation in which a
team wins a meet without taking first in
any event, and Haines said I prefer the
old scoring system myself. The other
way just means you've got to swim a lot
of people."
The swimmers will also be compet
ing in more events. Unlike the Card
inal's meets last wekend at Arizona and
Arizona State where only 13 races were
contested, the teams will square off in
16 events with the addition of 200 sin
the backstroke, breaststroke and but
terfly,

qualifying times for the NG\As and will
be looking to reach more this
weekend.
Haines is pleased by the progress
made by both his recruits and veterans
Our freshman group has been
doing really well. Haines said.
"(Freshman) Michelle Grtglione is
swimming right at the top of her form.
"We probably have the best back
stroke group in the country, (and
freestylist) Aimee Berzins has been
swimming particularly well
The Cardinal s depth will play an
even more important role in tomor
rows meet as a new scoring system
will be used. Typically, relays are
scored 7-0, and individuals are
awarded 5-3-1 for first through third
places. However, UCLA has chosen to
go with a new point system that in
volves 9-4-2 scoring for relays and ~-4-
3-2-1 for individual events
The scoring change was added to
the NCAA rule book this year in an at
tempt to get more competitors in
volved. However, it could also bring
about the odd situation in which a
team wins a meet without taking first in
any event, and Haines said I prefer the
old scoring system myself. The other
way just means you've got to swim a lot
of people."
The swimmers will also be compet
ing in more events. Unlike the Card
inal's meets last wekend at Arizona and
Arizona State where only 13 races were
contested, the teams will square off in
16 events with the addition of 200 sin
the backstroke, breaststroke and but

The Stanford women's swim team will have to get off its back and do some
serious swimming this weekend in order to defeat fourth-ranked USC and
No. 5 UCLA.
While the Farm remains mired in
the dead of winter, the Stanford
women's swimming team already
seems to he rounding into the late
season form of spring and has two rival
coaches talking of a possible national
championship for the second-ranked
Cardinal.
USC Coach Don Lamont and t'CLA
Coach Tom Jahn, who are bringing
their squads for dual meets at 2 p.m.
today and noon tomorrow at
DeGuerre Pool, have great respect for
Stanford Coach George Haines' group
of swimmers.
"I've watched (two-time defending
national champion) Texas, and they're
good, but they're not great
everywhere," Jahn said Stanford, on
the other hand, I saw their times
against Arizona, and I'm looking for
Stanford to Teally be the team to beat at
the end."
Lamont simply characterized the

Cardinal as "loaded" and added, "It's
almost unfair."
Before Stanford begins to entertain
visions of a possible national champi
onship, though, it must first contend
with the No. 4 Trojans and No. 5
Bruins.
USC will be kxiking for an upset
when it hits the pool this afternoon.
Vfhile Stanford has continued to train
heavily, Lamont reported that he has
had his charges taper their workouts
this week in preparation for the Card
inal and tomorrow's meet at California.
Lamont has also added a talented
group of freshmen to a team that was
shelled 103-37 in Los Angeles last year
by Stanford. The cupboard was by no
means bare either as the Trojans boast
a pair of Olympians in Anne Ottenbrite
and Cynthia "Sippy" Woodhead
Ottenbrite brought gold and silver
medals back to her native Canada in
1984 and should push Stanford Olym
pian Susan Rapp in the breaststroke
Woodhead, who transfered from Texas
during her freshman year, is expected
to compete in the individual medleys
and middle distance freestyle events.
Among the newcomers to the Trojan
lineup is Lisa Dorman, who copped
seventh in the 50-yard freestyle at this
summer s World Championships, and
a trio of Goodwill Games competitors,
Leslie Daland, Kathy Hettche and Terri
O'Loughlin
Daland (800 and 1,500) and Hettche
(400) combined to put a hammerlock
on the middle and long distance
freestyle championships in Moscow.
L'CLA also has a wealth of freshmen
with 12 newcomers in its lineup, and,
while the Bruins will look to improve
on the 102-38 drubbing they received
at the hands of Stanford last year, Jahn
said of the Cardinal, "Realistically,
we're not in their league.
"We've got a young team I think
we've got the potential to be pretty
good. This weekend will tell me a lot.
It they can come in and race Stanford
then we'll be pretty good."
There are some talented athletes on
a UCLA team that captured sixth in last
year's NCAA championships. Missy
Herndon is the Bruins' big gun, and
she will contend in the 200, 500 and
1,000 freestyles. In fact, the race of the
day could come in the 200. Herndon
boasts a 1:49 clocking in the event,
while Stanford's Jenna Johnson, who
took second in the NCAA 200 last
season, has a top mark of 1:49.86.
Also expected to give Stanford trou
ble are UCLA divers Karla Goltman and
Britt Williams. The duo recently
defeated the Cardinal divers in Las

Vegas, Nev . and according to Jahn are
really good."
For its part, the Cardinal is in the
midst of a stretch of hard training that
will continue through mid-February,
but has nonetheless managed to hit 11
qualifying times for the NG\As and will
be looking to reach more this
weekend.
