## Stanford looks for second straight win 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
In the second half of last season,
when the Stanford men's tennis team
last played I'C-lrvine, a good but not
great team .it the time, the Cardinal
played one of its best matches of the
year.
Vie had just started to come to
gether as a team." Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "We really hit our peak
then.
Today, Stanford meets Irvine in an
entirely different situation. The sixth
ranked Cardinal is 1-0 thanks to its 6-3
win over L'tah last week, but remains a
young team with room to improve
More importantly, Irvine is playing
exceptionally well going into today's
1:30 p.m. match at the Varsity Courts
Tied for 22nd in the preseason
rankings, the Anteaters are 2-1,
opening with impressive road victories
over lHth-ranked Kentucky and 13th
ranked Minnesota.
Irvine's only loss came Wednesday
to No. 3 Pepperdine 5-4. In that match,
the Anteaters lost ™-6 in the final set of
the final match of the day.
"They (Irvine) have an outstanding
team, with an outstanding freshman
class," Gould said. "I think they are un
derranked because people did not

know about their freshmen, but I know
they are very good. I would expect
from them a very, very tough match."
Those freshmen include Shige Kanr
ogy, who wa> nationally ranked as a
junior, Trevor Kronemann, Steve
Oliver and Richard Lubner, the fourth
ranked player in South Africa in 1985.
Top returning players for Irvine are
Julian Barham and Darren Yates —
who, according to Gould, formed a
very good doubles team last season —
Michael Downs, Art Hernandez and
Mark Kaplan, who won the Southern
California Regionals last fall.
As for Stanford, Patrick McEnroe is
still being bothered by bruises on the
bottom of his feet, but otherwise the
team is relatively healthy. In practice,
the players have been working on
doubles play and on specific improve
ments based on what Gould and Stan
ford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger ob
served against L'tah. Stanford lost two
of three doubles matches to the l!tes.
It's a very important match for us,"
Gould said. "It's early in the season,
but we have to compete well. We have
to play better each time out. We'll have
to raise our game to get a W' "
With tour California teams in the top
six in the country, Stanford could not
hurt its NCAA tournament bid chances
by knocking off another potential
Western challenger.
