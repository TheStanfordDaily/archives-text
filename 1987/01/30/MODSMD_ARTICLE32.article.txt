# Stanford gymnasts enter meet at Cal as underdogs
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
It's an airplane process of sorts.
The Stanford men's gymnasts, still on
the runway of their 1987 season, will
prepare for takeoff Sunday night,
and two weeks from now they
should be in the air flying toward a
third straight NOVA championship
appearance.
Giving the Stanford gymnasts all
the preparation they need this
weekend will be the No. 2-ranked
California Bears who, despite losing
by a wide margin of seven points to
the Cardinal last year, could well win
the Big Meet this year.
It's not just that the Bears are
markedly improved; this winter's
Stanford team is not yet proven. Cal
has easily shrugged off the loss of its
No. 1 performer to Olympic training
with the priming of three national
quality gymnasts, all seniors. Two of
Stanford's men are still recovering
from impairing — but not season-

threatening — injuries, while minor
aches and a lack of recent meet ex
perience are holding back the rest of
a squad which returns from a third
place finish in the nation last year.
Stanford is ranked 11th currently,
based entirely on its fourth-place
score at the UC-Davis Invitational,
Jan. 10. This ranking should improve
quickly, though a repeat of last
season's 16-2 dual-meet record and
NCAA trophy will be difficult with
the program's top eligible gymnast,
Randy Besosa, redshirting.
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada ex
peas a very tough challenge from
Cal, which recorded a superb score
of 276 a week ago. "The competition
will be pretty close," said Hamada,
last year's West Region Coach of the
Year. "They're a little better at this
point in the season, unless I use all
the guys."
Captain Mike Matzek agreed that
the Cardinal would have to hit every
thing to ensure a win, but said the
team is coming back well from its

setbacks and that the future looks
good. "We got off to a slow start,
mainly because of injuries, but
even-body is starting to get healthv,"
he said. "We'll be a late-blossoming
team this year.''
When Matzek fully recovers from
his ailments — a rundown of which
would read like an anatomy
textbook — he will be expected to
form a one-two punch with Chuck
Gerardo rivaling that of any school
in the nation. Gerardo will be fight
ing Cal's Bob Sundstrom for the indi
vidual title Sunday. In their last
meeting, at the Davis Invitational,
Gerardo defeated Sundstrom, as
well as every other all-around per
former, with a score of 54.9.
Sundstrom, along with seniors
Steve Mikluk and David Nasakako,
makes Cal a much better squad than
last year's Bears, who never really
challenged the nation's top pro
grams. Gone is John Omori, who is
among the nation's top individual^
