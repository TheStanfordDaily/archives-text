# Card women at Cal Invite
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Cal is throwing a party that could
very well turn into a battle tomorrow,
as the Stanford women's gymnastics
team travels to Berkeley prepared to
reveal its true potential and knock the
NG\A on its ear.
The event is the California Invita
tional, and the Cardinal will face Wash
ington, L'C-Santa Barbara and Cal in
what could be a very exciting competi
tion.
Quite frankly, I think we'll have a
great showing," Stanford Asst. Coach
Sam Shaw said.
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina
agreed. "It will be an interesting com
petition," he said. "We'll meet Wash
ington, too, not just our rival (Cal). It's
going to be a three-way race."
Both Cal and Washington have per
formed well this year. The Huskies last
week garnered a 182.65 team score,
while the Golden Bears have scored
174. To date, Stanford has scored 170.6
and 165.4.
"They've both outscored us," Sar
dina noted. "I think that Washington is
probably going to assume they're top
dog. Berkeley will , think thev're
second, and Santa Barbara will prob
ably think they have a chance."
Sardina hopes to give them a big
surprise. "We know we're plus 180
right now," he said. "We just have to hit
some routines."
Tomorrow will mark the debut of
the team's first-string lineup. Sardina
fielded a team composed of mostly
freshmen at the season-opening meet
at UC-Davis, and last week divided his
gymnasts into two evenly matched
groups against Alberta.
"This is the first time we'll have one
solid team," Sardina said. "We'll be
running with a lot more depth.
â€¢ "It's a good lineup," he added. ''We
have freshman Dina Amoroso and
freshman Becky Ashton competing.
The rest of the players are the same."
Sophomores Cheryl Doo, Sheri
Evenson, Jessica Armstrong and Jinny
Rhee will compete, along with junior
: Alison McGann and seniors Nanci
Goldsmith and Cindy Boyd.
"Cheryl Doo will have a good meet
this week," Sardina predicted, "and

Jinny Rhee will keep rolling along."
Rhee won the individual all-around last
week with a score of 36.40.
A few gymnasts will be missing the
action this week. Along with freshman
Marietta Frey and sophomore
Laurence George, who will be out for
most of the season, junior Beth Pope
and freshman Susan Banta will take

brief hiatuses from competition. Pope
is currently resting a strained knee,
while Banta is taking a short respite to
strengthen her routines.
"Susan will be out for another week
to intensify her training," Sardina said.
"We're looking for her to impact our
performance later in the season."

Invitational.
