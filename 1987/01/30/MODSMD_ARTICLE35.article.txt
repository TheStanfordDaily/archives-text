# Wrestlers tangle with Titans
## 
### FAITH PERRY Staff writer 
As the sayings go, it's not over until the fat lady sings, until
it's over or until Brent Musberger shuts up. Today's wres
tling match against the Fullerton State Titans at 5 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion should have one of those kinds of finishes
that will keep the crowd's attention until the last match is
completed.
The Cardinal's loss to Fresno State on Wednesday indi
cated that Stanford's strength is in the upper-division weight
classes. The same is true of the Titans.
Vic Adame of the Fullerton State Sports Information Of
fice said, "The Titans are a come-from-behind team, because
our strongest competitors are the heavier ones. In our last
match, the other team was leading 17-0, and we still
managed to pull it out and win."
As usual, Stanford will be forfeiting at 118 pounds be
cause the Cardinal doesn't have a wrestler at that weight,
giving the Titans an initial six-point edge that may make the
crucial difference in the final score.
Stanford freshmen John Lisle (126), Brian Veit (134) and
Geoff Baum (142) will have to score if the Cardinal is to be
in contention going into the upper-weight matches.
Lisle will face Titan sophomore Shawn Dreitzler (4-10-1);
Veit will be up against junior John Cholakian (2-6-1); and
Baum's opponent will be junior Richard Zele (4-9-1). If lack
of collegiate experience plays as big a part as it did Wednes
day, the younger Stanford wrestlers may be in for a tough
evening.

Wrestling at 150 for the Cardinal is senior Scott Wiggen,
the team co-captian and an All-America, who is coming off a
win Wednesday against Fresno State's Fred Hunzinger and
is 18-3-1 for the season. Wiggen will be wrestling Fresno
State sophomore Scott Guy.
Freshman Steve Yarbrough will be representing Stanford
at 158. Yarbrough, who may have been the victim of a bad
call in his loss Wednesday, will be going against a tough op
ponent tonight — All-American Ardeshir Asgari. Asgari was a
Pacific Coast Athletic Association conference champion last
year, placed sixth at the NCAA tournament, and is currently
ranked third in the nation at 158 by National Mat News.
Asgari is a former member of the Iranian national team
who defected while competing in Argentina.
Cardinal junior Eric Harber (167) will face sophomore
Jim Klink in what could prove to be a key match. Harber has
a year of collegiate experience over Klink and will try to use
it to his advantage.
Another important match will be Stanford freshman Ron
Perry (177) against junior Jose Flores, who is 10-0 this
season and placed fourth in last year's PCAA tournament.
The match at 190 looks promising for Stanford junior
Terry Mclntyre, who suffered a two-point loss Wednesday to
Fresno State All-American Fred Little, but was impressive
with his tenaciousness. Mclntyre will wrestle sophomore
Paul Ruetzel (6-9).
In the heavyweight battle, Stanford senior Kurt Kassulke
will face Bob Button. Kassulke is 17-7 this season, and re
corded a 15-0 technical pin Wednesday.
