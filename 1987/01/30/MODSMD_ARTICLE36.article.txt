The Daily incorrectly wrote in a
headline yesterday that Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Diana Conklin had sent
letters to two students evicted from
Hurlburt House Wednesday setting the
terms under which they could live in
the house. The letters were sent to four
current Hurlburt residents who can go
on living in the residence if they meet
the letters' terms.
The Daily also incorrectly inden
tified Jay Murray as a Hurlburt resident.
The Daily regrets the errors.
