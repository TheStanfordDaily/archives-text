# Officials say Cox's death was suicide

### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
San Mateo County sheriffs detectives are attributing the
death of Earth Sciences Dean Allan Cox to suicide, possibly
over a pending criminal complaint of child molestation.
Cox, 60, died Tuesday when he crashed head-on into a
tree while bicycling on Tunitas Creek Road, near his home
in Woodside.
Although the parents of the molestation victim con
fronted Cox in December, they telephoned Cox on Friday to
tell him they had reported him to authorities in the state of
Washington, according to Mike Dirickson, detective for the
San Mateo County Sheriffs Department.
Authorities in San Mateo County began an investigation
because "most of the molestations took place here," Dirick
son said.
The father of the alleged molestation victim studied for
his doctorate under Cox at Stanford, according to a report
yesterday in the San Francisco Chronicle. The parents
reportedly said Cox had sexual contact with their 14-year
old son when the family was living on the Peninsula and
claimed that Cox had been sexually involved with the now
19-year-old since that time.
Any acts occurring before the teenager turned 18 are con
sidered felony acts of molestation, police told the Chronicle.
According to Dirickson, a number of factors uncovered in
the investigation suggest suicide:
• Cox reportedly mentioned suicide when confronted in
December by the parents of the alleged molestation victim.
• Cox rode his bicycle straight off
Tunitas Creek Road before the road
started to curve. "It would be just like a
motorist who had fallen asleep at the
wheel," Dirickson said. In most cases
involving vehicles going off the road

on a curve, the vehicle leaves the road
in the middle of the curve, pulled off
by centrifugal force, Dirickson said.
• The point of impact was high on
Cox's forehead, nearly on the top of his
head, which indicates Cox's head was
down as he headed toward the tree.
Had the crash been an accident or had
Cox had a heart attack, it is more likely
he would have held his head up and at
tempted to shield his face or clutch his

chest, according to Dirickson.
"It's as if his head was down and he
was sprinting on the bike toward the
tree," Dirickson said.
• Cox had his bike in 15th gear, a gear
suited for high speed but unusual for a
curvy mountain road.
• Cox left his helmet in his garage at
home, although he normally wore one.
• Cox left a note in his pocket listing
his name, his address and a person to

contact in case of emergency. He left
his wallet in his car, parked near
Skyline Drive. "It seems to me he did
that to make sure he would be found
and identified," Dirickson said.
• Detectives searching Cox's house
found on Cox's desk three books on
how to write a will.
Cox reportedly paid counseling
costs for the youth.
