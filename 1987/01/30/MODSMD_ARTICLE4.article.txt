San Mateo County sheriffs detectives are attributing the
death of Earth Sciences Dean Allan Cox to suicide, possibly
over a pending criminal complaint of child molestation.
Cox, 60, died Tuesday when he crashed head-on into a
tree while bicycling on Tunitas Creek Road, near his home
in Woodside.
Although the parents of the molestation victim con
fronted Cox in December, they telephoned Cox on Friday to
tell him they had reported him to authorities in the state of
Washington, according to Mike Dirickson, detective for the
San Mateo County Sheriffs Department.
Authorities in San Mateo County began an investigation
because "most of the molestations took place here," Dirick
son said.
The father of the alleged molestation victim studied for
his doctorate under Cox at Stanford, according to a report
yesterday in the San Francisco Chronicle. The parents
reportedly said Cox had sexual contact with their 14-year
old son when the family was living on the Peninsula and
claimed that Cox had been sexually involved with the now
19-year-old since that time.
Any acts occurring before the teenager turned 18 are con
sidered felony acts of molestation, police told the Chronicle.
According to Dirickson, a number of factors uncovered in
the investigation suggest suicide:
â€¢ Cox reportedly mentioned suicide when confronted in
December by the parents of the alleged molestation victim.
