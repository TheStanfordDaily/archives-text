# Stanford education: Worth the high cost?
## 
### EMMA GARFORTH 
As their tuitions rise, private institutions like
Stanford are feeling pressure to prove their worth
as centers of teaching and learning in relation to
their costs. Students and families are increasingly
concerned whether these expensive institutions
are taking their teaching seriously, according to
an article in the Jan. 18 New York Times.
Although several private institutions have im
plemented programs to evaluate the quality of
teaching and learning at their schools, Stanford
remains reluctant to "test" for knowledge or
change the current evaluation policy for its in
structors.
Harvard has developed a faculty commission
with some non-Harvard members to assess the
quality of teaching and the amount of knowledge
students gain during their undergraduate years,
the Times reported. Bowdoin, Wellesley and Wes

leyan have started a program of testing each
other's graduating seniors in brder to assess the
students' knowledge in their particular fields.
Carolyn Lougee, dean of Undergraduate
Studies, said Stanford does noÂ£h av e a specific de
partment to evaluate teaching and learning and is
in an ongoing process of change in its strategies
to evaluate academic programs*
Both Lougee and English Prot Ronald Rebholz,
an active proponent of academic improvement,
said knowledge assessment for professors
would be useless as well as expensive. Rebholz
said: "I'd rather see the money spent on hiring
more teachers than on an expensive testing pro
gram." >
"Teaching to the test," said Lougee, would be
more a handicap than a help to the teacher. It
would defeat the purpose of teachers teaching
what they are interested in and enthusiastic about
and would be an infringement on the professor's

freedom and autonomy in the classroom, she
said.
Stanford is obviously interested in teaching fac
tual material, but it also feels a duty to convey cri
tical thinking and analysis, Lougee said. "Most un
dergraduates forget 90 percent of what they
learned in college," said Lougee. "Of what use
then would standardized testing be?"
Lougee said the course evaluation forms that
students fill out at the end of every quarter are an
example of Stanford's efforts to evaluate its pro
fessors.
Professors and the deans of departments read
the forms. If there is a consistent complaint from
students, the professor is encouraged to go to the
Stanford Center for Teaching and Learning, said
CTL Director Michele Marincovich. Personalized
attention is given in order to help the professor
improve on his or her teaching methods, she
said.

Most professors who go to CTL do so on their
own initiative, Marincovich said. "Out of 100 pro
fessors who come, two-thirds have tenure....
They are genuinely just interested in new teach
ing methods and skills."
One main criterion in deciding whether to hire
a professor is his or her previous record of en
thusiasm about teaching as measured by letters of
recommendation from peers and students, and
from previous active involvement with new
courses. They have to be "committed and ener
getic," said Lougee.
Rebholz said he finds Stanford to be "passive"
about the quality of its teaching. He said he feels
annual evaluations by faculty peers would im
prove the quality of teaching.
"This would put more stress on demonstrated
improvement of teaching," said Rebholz. More
professors would be fired at the end of
three years if the University had such a
peer review program, he said.
Lougee said the University assesses
what its undergraduates are learning
by looking at how active students are
in research programs, individually de
signed majors and creating their own
courses. She said such individual pro
grams indicate that Stanford students
are enterprising and learning to syn
thesize 1 and use information in a con
structive way.
"VXlien alumni are asked what they
remember from their Stanford educa
tion a common reply is the Stanford
Experience,' " said Ruth Schneider, di
rector of the Career Planning and
Placement Center. She said students
develop critical and analytic skills here,
not just a body of knowledge.

Lougee added that Stanford is differ
ent from a state university since its
pool of students is already of an excep
tional caliber. Stanford places a great
deal of trust in students to seek their
own" advice and academic challenge.
Rebholz said, however, that he
thinks Stanford concentrates too heav
ily on research and publications. "Not
enough is done in order to improve
the quality of teaching," he said. "A bal
ance must be found between the two."
He added that undergraduate ad
visers need to become more aware < >r
the undergraduate program to ii..
prove the advising system. Other im
provements he suggested included
hiring more faculty to reduce the size
of classes and building a "classroom
building" that could adapt to the Uni
versity's specific needs.
Marincovich, however, said Stanford
is more concerned with its teaching
than other research universities such
as Harvard and MIT.
Lougee said the widening gap be

tween the research aspea and the un
dergraduate aspect of Stanford in creat
ing a conflict in defining the Univer
sity's role.
According to Ltmgee. by keeping the
size of the student botfv stable. Stan
ford can give individual attention to
students who want it.
In terms of education and the poten
tial for learning. Marincovich said Stan
ford is also worth the cost. "Some of
the best minds in the world are here at
Stanford." she said.
