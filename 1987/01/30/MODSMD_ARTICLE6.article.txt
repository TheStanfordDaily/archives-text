## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
Arms control, medical research and international
scholarly cooperation were themes of the panel discus
sion "Bridges to the Soviet Union" yesterday at Kresge
Auditorium.
l.ee Zeigler. director of Fulbright programs at Stan
ford. arranged the discussion to commemorate the 40th
anniversary of the Fulbright Lxhangc Program. Zeigler is
also the director of Bechtel International Center, one of
the sponsors of the discussion
Lyle Nelson, professor emeritus of communication
and former chairman of the Board of Foreign Scholar
ships. moderated the discussion, which included short
speeches by Profs. Wolfgang Panofsky, Alexander Dallin
and Herbert Abrams. as well a.s questions from the audi
ence.
Dallin. professor of histon and political science,
spoke first about international scholarh exchange pro
grams
In the last 40 years, the United States has completed a
far more accurate view of the Soviet I nion. he said.
Increased oppportunities for U.S citizens 10 visit the
Soviet I'nion is the major reason for the improved un
derstanding between the two countries, Dallin said The
opportunities are made possible b\ the support of such
groups as the National Academy of Science* and the
Fulbright Foundation, he said
As a result, "much of what passed for professional wis
dom (40 years ago) now seems primitive, if not ludi
crous, lie said.
Dallin stressed the reciprocity of this understanding
It is not at all unrealistic to believe that a more accurate

view of the Tinted States is seriously 111 our interest as
well as theirs." he said.
Although he asserted that "this show ami-tell need not
he .ill positive and that experience has laid to rest the
notion that as America and Russia gel to know each other
all problems will vanish." he said the understanding
gained through such exchanges is essential it the two na
tions are to learn to live with each other
Panofskv. professor emeritus of physic- and director
emeritus of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
spoke next about the most serious problem t.icing the
Soviet I'nion and the I'nited States — the .iriu s r;,c^
With some exceptions, the I'nited States has in
novated new weapons of mass destruction and the Soviet
I 'nion has followed suit in four or five years, he said.
Several alternatives can be pursued to trv to remedy
this problem, according to Panofsky. P<»litic*' ;,n ** can put
their faith in technological solutions such as the strategic
"Defense 'Initiative tSDH, or they -can continue .an un

limited arms race in the belief that they can win it.he
said
On the other hand, states can disarm completely or
impose a freeze or moratorium on nuclear weapons, he
added. But arms control, although much more difficult
than these other alternatives, is the only practical one,
said Panofsky.
Panofsky conceded that arms control has gained a
"bad name." but he said that it is possible to reach a
constructive agreement where the common interest in
limiting the arms race takes precedence over other inter
etts
"The only disappointing thing is that the list (of arms
control agreements) has not been continued in recent
times," he added.
According to Panofsky, there is a false perception that

The Soviet Union has continually
fheated or evaded agreements." In
fact, the Soviets' record is very good,
he said.
[ Rather than the stalemate that the
United States is in now, arms control
talks must try to achieve what Panofsky
called the "Grand Compromise," in
which the two powers would negotiate
over medium-range and long-range
missiles and bend the emphasis away
from SDF

The history and goals of the Interna
tional Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War (IPPNW) was the subject

Nobel Peace Prize, is "composed of
physicians from more than 40
countries who have "worked to bring
about greater recognition of the threat
of nuclear war," according to Abrams.
"We have made progress by focus
ing on scientific and medical effects of
nuclear weapons" and by depoliticiz
ing the organization, said Abrams.

than these other alternatives, is the only practical one,
said Panofsky.
Panofsky conceded that arms control has gained a

constructive agreement where the common interest in
limiting the arms race takes precedence over other inter

"The only disappointing thing is that the list (of arms

far more accurate view of the Soviet I nion. he said.
Increased oppportunities for U.S citizens 10 visit the
Soviet I'nion is the major reason for the improved un
derstanding between the two countries, Dallin said The
opportunities are made possible b\ the support of such
groups as the National Academy of Science* and the
Fulbright Foundation, he said
As a result, "much of what passed for professional wis

Dallin stressed the reciprocity of this understanding
It is not at all unrealistic to believe that a more accurate

view of the Tinted States is seriously 111 our interest as
