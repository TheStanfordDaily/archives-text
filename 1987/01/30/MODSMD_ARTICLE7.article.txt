Misconceptions and societal close-mindedness have his
torically hindered efforts to find treatments for sexually
transmitted diseases and have stood in die way of accep
tance of their widespread existence, a lecturer from Harvard
told a crowd of 50 here yesterday.
Drawing parallels to the present AIDS epidemic, Allan
Brandt, assistant professor of history of medicine and sci
ence at Harvard Medical School, spoke on "Syphilis in West
ern History" before a Human Biology 128 class yesterday in
Braun Auditorium.
Brandt chronicled the history of syphilis in 20th century
America, particularly in the early decades, which were
marked by high incidence of the disease. He emphasized
that societal efforts to confront diseases like syphilis are lim
ited by social attitudes, values and patterns of judgment that
shape cultural ideas of good and bad
Discussing the hysteria about syphilis in the first 20 years
of the century — the Progressive Era — Brandt outlined the
search for technological and scientific answers that would
change social misconceptions and make biological solu
tions easier to accept The era was marked by the "social
hygiene" movement, said Brandt, illustrating his assertion
that social values limited the validity of trying to find cures.
Describing attitudes toward the "innocent victims" of
venereal diseases, such as children or wives of syphilitic
males who had contracted the disease through sexual con
tact with prostitutes. Brandt drew parallels to the AIDS scare
and the dinger of contracting the disease through bl(x>d
transfusions or needles as well as through sexual intimacy.
"Theories of casual transmission reflected deep social
fears of sexually transmitted disease at that time," Brandt
said Vi ith the fear of contracting syphilis casually or during
childbirth, distinguishing between venereal disease and
venereal disease of the innocent had a powerful effect of
dividing victims" between those who
"deserved it" because of a choice and
those who did not.
Brandt discussed the pervasive fear
of contagion in today's society as a near
parallel, but cautioned that "AIDS is
not syphilis." He cited a similar divi
sion between innocent victims and
"guilty perpetrators" and similar con

cern with social values penetrating the
biological aspect of the disease.
Brandt further emphasized the effect
of social attitude and behavior on the
outlook toward syphilis and other
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)
by describing society's tendency to
label moral principles rather than bio
logical factors as causes of disease.
Similarly, homosexuality — and not
biological factors — is easily regarded
now as the cause of AIDS, rather than a
means of spreading the disease.
