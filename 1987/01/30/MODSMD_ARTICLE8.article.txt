U.S. blocked return of Marcos
WASHINGTON — The United States intervened to blocli Ferdinand
Marcos from returning to the Philippines after receiving "credible
evidence" that he was planning to fly back to his jiomeland amid an
abortive coup in the nation he ruled for 20 years, U.S. officials said yester
day. .- »>
Marcos denied that he had any immediate plans to return to his
homeland, the official said. ' c/?,
But Tomas Gomez, the Philippine consul general in Honolulu, said in a
telephone interview that a chartered Boeing 707 jet was waiting in
Honolulu "with the intention of flying Marcos to the Philippines."
Although there was a clear understanding of Marcos' status, U.S. officials
indicated that there was no formal agreement blocking him from returning
to the Philippines.
By law, however, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has author
ity to prevent an alien from leaving the United States "for the purpose of
organizing, directing or participating in any rebellion, insurrection or viol
ent uprising against a foreign country."
U.S., Europe settle trade dispute
WASHINGTON — American and European trade negotiators yesterday
settled a bitter dispute over grain exports hours before a U.S. deadline,
thereby almost certainly avoiding the imposition of steep retaliatory tariffs
on a range of luxury food and wine imports from Europe.
But the compromise, announced here and at the Brussels headquarters
of the Common Market, must still be approved by the Common Market's 12
member countries, and late reports from there hinted that a special
meeting of foreign ministers of the Common Market might have to con
vene next Friday to keep the deal from falling through.
Under the agreement, which compensates the United States for lost
grain sales to Spain and Portugal when those countries joined the Common
Market, U.S. farmers will be able to sell up to 2.6 million tons of corn and
sorghum to Spain at world market prices, and 400,000 tons to Portugal.
The setdement was not enough to satisfy U.S. grain farmers, however.
Bill Wilson, spokesman for the U.S. Feed Grains Council, said his organiza
tion was disappointed with the terms of the compromise. "We were hoping
the figures would be higher," he said.
S. Africa tightens press control
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The South African government, fur
ther tightening its controls on the country's news media, gave the police
authority yesterday to prohibit publication of anything they regard as a
threat to security or public order.
The new censorship powers are by far the most sweeping yet assumed
by President Pieter Botha's government, going beyond earlier measures
that severely restricted the reporting of political violence, "subversive
statements" and security force actions but still allowed some scope for
- comment.
The new measure is certain to arouse the anger of the government's op
ponents, who vehemendy criticized earlier press restrictions from both the
left and the right, and Botha will find himself under even sharper attack
when Parliament reconvenes in Cape Town tomorrow to hear his assess
( ment of the state of the nation and his justification for what could become
■ full political censorship here.
These regulations are now being challenged in court.
Gorbachev 5 s proposal is resisted
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev appeared yesterday to be
facing strong resistance to his radical proposal for secret-ballot, multiple
candidate elections for top Communist Party posts.
A resolution adopted by the party Central Committee, printed in yester
day's issue of Pravda and other party publications, contains only vague sup
port for the concept of "intra-party democracy" and makes no specific en
dorsement of Gorbachev's proposal.
Nevertheless, the resolution firmly endorses other proposals for
democratization advanced by Gorbachev in his address to a meeting this
week of the Central Committee.
Western diplomats said the vague language dealing with proposed
changes in the way party leaders are elected may reflect divisions within
the Politburo on a key element of the Gorbachev program.
Gorbachev, in his speech to the Central Committee Tuesday, strongly
emphasized the need for greater democracy in the work of the party and in
the workplaces of the Soviet people.
But he spoke cautiously about how the party should revise its method of
choosing leaders, saying "there also is a need to think of changing the pro
cedure."
Senate blocks salary increases
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted overwhelmingly yesterday night to
block salary increases for top federal officials, including members of
Congress, but the House moved to sidestep a vote on the politically touchy
issue, bolstering chances that the raise* wilj take effect as scheduled next
week.
As proposed by President Reagan, annual congressional pay would be in
creased from $77,400 to $89,500, with proportionally smaller increases for
federal judges and other top government officials. The increases are to take
effect next Wednesday unless blocked by both chambers in legislation that
must by signed by Reagan or passed over his veto.
To keep the House from allowing the increases to take effect without
having to vote on them, senators opposing the raise threatened to attach
legislation blocking increases to other high-priority measures passed by
the House, including a huge highway bill and legislation to increase spend
ing on food and shelter for the homeless. When the priority legislation
with pay rider attached then returned to the House for a vote, members
would have to either take a stand on the raises or doom other "must" legis
lation. °
Several senators suggested that the Senate was positioning itself to profit
from each side of the deal: a pay raise along with the political credit for
having voted against it, leaving it to the House to dispose of the issue. The
House, anxious to get the pay raise without blame from constituents,
moved yesterday to relegate the matter to a five-member task force of its
Post Office and Civil Service Committee, where the pav-raise disapproval
measure is expected to die.
Senate approves aid for homeless
WASHINGTON —The Senate voted overwhelmingly yesterday for an ad
ditional $50 million to build shelters and provide food for the homeless in
cities across the nation. The bill, which was approved earlier bv the House,
now goes to President Reagan, whose advisers have indicated strong oppo
sition.
Although the Senate's 77-6 vote was bipartisan, Democratic leaders
touted the homeless assistance as an example of their determination to
seize control of the nation's legislative agenda early in the 100 th Congress.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) said the measure had been
put on a "fast track" for that reason.
However, Democrats conceded that they may be setting up a confronta
tion with the White House. Earlier in the week, a spokesman for the Office
of Management and Budget said the emergency measure was fiscally ir
responsible and criticized the way in which Congress secured extra funds
for the homeless program.
To pay for the emergency assistance, House and Senate leaders trans
ferred 150 million froma program offering low-income loans and other as- ~
sistance to victims of natural disasters The new funds would be distributed
to local governments and non-profit groups under the Emergency Food
and Shelter Program.
