# Senate releases Iran report
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Iranian arms initiative
resulted from President Reagan s "deep concern"
over American hostages in Lebanon, Israel's desire to
step up contacts with Iran and pressure from foreign
middlemen and arms dealers, as much as any effort
by the administration to court moderate elements in
Iran, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
said in a report released yesterday.
The 65-page document, cleared for release on a
14-to-l vote, provided fresh details about not only
the Iranian arms transactions but also the still murky
links between those arms sales and the diversion of
the proceeds to aid the Nicaraguan rebels.
Among the new details contained in the report are
that:
• Reagan and his top advisers were told by former
national security adviser Robert McFarlane at the
Geneva summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev in November 1985 that the Israelis were consid
ering an arms shipment to Iran and "if the operation
was successful, hostages might be freed."

• There were repeated questions about the reliability
of Iranian middleman Manucher Ghorbanifar, who
was being used by the White House as the adminis
tration's main go-between with the Iranian govern
ment. Beginning in 1984, the Central Intelligence
Agency had information that he was seeking to help
an associate in drug smuggling, and that, in 1985, he
was described in a State Department document as a
"talented fabricator." In the midst of the operation,
CIA Director William Casey wrote the president that
Ghorbanifar's information "could be a deception to
impress us." After the Iranian failed a CIA polygraph
last January, "(National Security Council aide Lt. Col.
Oliver) North was responsible for keeping Ghor
banifar on the project," according to a CIA witness.
• U.S. intelligence material on Iraq was delivered on
several occasions as part of the Iranian demands,
over the objections of the CIA.
• Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams
apologized to the committee for "withholding infor
mation" about soliciting a $10 million contribution

from a foreign government for anti-Sandinista forces
fighting in Central America. Abrams, testifying under
oath Dec. 8, said he did not realize until shown a
transcript that his testimony on Nov. 25 "clearly left a
misleading impression." I
• A source of unknown reliability- told the committee •
that profits from Iranian arms sales were deposited
in accounts in a Swiss bank called Credit Fiduciere
Services (CFS), and these accounts were "opened •
and or controlled by retired Air Force maj. gen. Rich- ,
ard Secord, and former CIA officials Thomas Clines
and Theodore Shackley."
Intelligence committee chairman David Boren (D-
Okla.) noted Thursday that while the report drew no
conclusions and was only a summary of the tes
timony and documentation obtained by the group
during a two-month investigation, the facts as pre
sented led to the conclusion that "foreign policy was
made by amateurs" during the period covered by the
U.S.-backed arms selling program.
