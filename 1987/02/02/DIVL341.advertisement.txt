PROBLEMS. . .
Think of all the problems that exist in the business world today. An immeasurable number. At Arthur
Young, we take pride in the fact that we have reduced the quantity and magnitude of these problems for our
clients. Solving their problems means first learning about the business and the people, then making the
problems our problems and then, working on a creative, effective approach to a solution we can implement.
To learn more specifically about what we do, please attend a presentation by our Management
Consulting Group with a wine and cheese reception to follow. We are interested in talking to Stanford
seniors majoring in Industrial Engineering or closely related fields, who have a sincere desire to tackle a
problem or two in the business world.
