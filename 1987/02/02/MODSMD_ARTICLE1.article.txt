# C-US may eliminate frosh dorm choices
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Incoming freshmen next fall
may not be able to express prefer
ence for housing based on the sex
or class composition of dormitor
ies If a recommendation by the
Subcommltte on Residential Edu
cation and Advising (SREA) is ap
proved by the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (C-US).
In a Jan. 27 letter to University
resident fellows, Alice Supton, as
sistant dean of residential educa
tion, detailed the SREA proposal.
"SREA decided, on a one-year
experimental basis, not to give en
tering students the opportunity to
express preference for assignment
to an all-frosh or four-class or to a
single-sex or coed corridor. In
stead, the different types of
housing will be described and stu
dents will be told their educational
choices, especially Western Cul
ture choice, drive housing deci
sions," according to the letter.
Such a move would be a
departure from the present sys
tem in which freshmen fill out
housing choice cards before com
ing to the Univeristy.
Students wishing to live in an
ethnic theme house will still be
able to indicate such a preference
under the new proposal.
"Students will be informed that
they may be assigned to an ethnic
theme house and that, if they
wish to increase their chance of
assignment, they can do so by in
dicating their desire for assign
ment to a part icular ethnic theme
house or houses," according to
the letter.
Albert CamariUo. a history, pro
fessor and the head of SREA, said
that it is "hard to say" whether the
committee's recommendations
will receive approval from C-US.
The initial move for the proposal
was made by several resident fel
lows and staff members in the Of
fice of Residential Education,
Camarillo said.
One of the reasons behind the
proposal is that a number of fresh
man are already assigned to
dorms based on their selection of
a Western Cuture track.
According to Norm Robinson,

associate dean of residential edu
cation for student affairs, there Is
"a sense that it was really sort of
misleading" to give the impres
sion that freshmen housing is de
termined solely by student
preferences about dormitory sex
and class composition.
Robinson noted that students
selecting Western Culture tracks
of Literature and the Arts and
Great Works, are now concen
trated in Wilbur Hall, while fresh
man who choose the Structured
Liberal Education track are based
in Florence Moore Hall.
Another reason behind the pro
posal is that students "end up
being pretty happy with the dor
mitory" they are assigned no mat

ter what the choice, Camarillo
said.
Robinson agreed, noting the
feeling of those proposing the idea
that the"the difference really Isn't
all that major" between all-frosh
and four-class dorms.
Houses with a large concentra
tion of students in a particular
track could be beneficial to the In
tellectual process at the Univer
sity, Robinson said.
"I think people feel it really helps
to improve the intellectual experi
ence of freshmen," Robinson said,
adding that such a system would
"enhance programming possibili
ties."
The proposal, however, has

drawn criticism from some fresh
men who state that the move will
hurt diversity in the dorms.
"If they're accepting people on
the basis of diversity, then we
should live with a diverse group of
people instead of living with a
group of people that is similar to
ourselves," said Eric Black, a
Branner freshman.
"We should be able to appreciate
diversity instead of similarity,"
Black said.
Amy Clark, a Branner fresh
man, criticized the proposal,
noting that "part of the diversity
in the dorm (Branner) is due to
our different Western Culture
tracks."
