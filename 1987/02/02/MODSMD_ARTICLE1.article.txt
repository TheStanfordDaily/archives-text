### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Incoming freshmen next fall
may not be able to express prefer
ence for housing based on the sex
or class composition of dormitor
ies If a recommendation by the
Subcommltte on Residential Edu
cation and Advising (SREA) is ap
proved by the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (C-US).
In a Jan. 27 letter to University
resident fellows, Alice Supton, as
sistant dean of residential educa
tion, detailed the SREA proposal.
"SREA decided, on a one-year
experimental basis, not to give en
tering students the opportunity to
express preference for assignment
to an all-frosh or four-class or to a
single-sex or coed corridor. In
stead, the different types of
housing will be described and stu
dents will be told their educational
choices, especially Western Cul
ture choice, drive housing deci
sions," according to the letter.
Such a move would be a
departure from the present sys
tem in which freshmen fill out
housing choice cards before com
ing to the Univeristy.
Students wishing to live in an
ethnic theme house will still be
able to indicate such a preference
under the new proposal.
"Students will be informed that
they may be assigned to an ethnic
theme house and that, if they
wish to increase their chance of
assignment, they can do so by in
dicating their desire for assign
ment to a part icular ethnic theme
house or houses," according to
the letter.
