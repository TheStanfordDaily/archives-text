# Spring Break gone bad
## Student wins travel agency lawsuit 
### FRANK QUARATIELLO 
A Stanford sophomore has won a breach of
contract suit against a travel agency respon
sible for sending 200 Stanford students to
Hawaii during spring break last year.
Jim Pltofsky, who professes an interest in
law, sued Pasadena Travel Service Inc. for
breach of contract, fraud by Inducement and
diminution in value on Jan. 12. He was
awarded *250 in a ruling that the travel
agency failed to meet its contractual obliga
tions to him when he went to Hawaii during
spring break last year. Pltofsky was one of a
group of 200 Stanford students who went on
the trip.
Law Prof. John Kaplan said that since
Pltofsky was awarded money, he assumes that
the other students could win similar suits as
long as no statute of limitations has expired
and the travel agency has enough money to pay
the awards.
The travel agency Is also being sued by the
grandfather of junior Darren Schneider, who
organized the trip. When a check for about
*27,000, written by the travel agency to the

Walkiki Marina Hotel, bounced, Schneider was
forced to borrow the money to pay for the
rooms. His grandfather paid off the debt but
was only reimbursed for â™¦10,000 by the travel
agency.
Schneider, who once worked for the travel
agency, said he is "pretty positive" that the
agency's owner. Joselito Pablo, will declare
bankruptcy If he loses further lawsuits.
Schneider said that he called the Sheraton
Princess Kaiulanl Hotel in Hawaii four days
before the group left and found out that the
hotel reservations had been cancelled.
Schneider then called the travel agent, Pablo,
who promised to solve the problem.
When the group arrived in Hawaii, Pltofsky
said, they were told that the Sheraton had
been overbooked. A Hawaiian travel agency
representing Pasadena Travel then arranged to
have the group stay at the Walkiki Marina
Hotel in "comparable" rooms.
Pasadena Travel contracted to provide the
students with rooms at the Sheraton. Pltofsky
said that, in reality, the rooms at the Walkiki
Marina were not of comparable value, but half
the price of those at the Sheraton.

Surprised that the Sheraton could have
overbooked a group of 200, Pitofsky talked to
the general manager of the Sheraton and
found out that Pablo had failed to make the
deposits on the rooms. The deposits were due
30 days before the students were to arrive.
Despite two extensions given by the Sheraton,
Pablo failed to make the payment.
The hotel then cancelled the reservations.
According to Pitofsky and Schneider, Pablo
had apparently underestimated the cost of the
trip when he guaranteed Schneider the price
of >349 per person. Pitofsky speculated that
the travel agent decided to ignore his mistake
rather than pay the difference in price and
take a loss.
Schneider said that he thought Pltofsky's
suit was valid, since "he was promised a room
at the Sheraton and he didn't get a comparable
room."
Pitofsky represented himself In small claims
court.
He said he wrote a letter to the travel agency
formally asking to be reimbursed. When the
agency did not reply after 30 days, he filed a
suit at the Palo Alto courthouse.
