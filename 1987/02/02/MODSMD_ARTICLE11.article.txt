# Minority groups to rally in Sacramento
## 
### JENNIFER SCHMID 
Representatives of Third World
student organizations gathered
yesterday at Stanford to plan a
rally protesting cutbacks in Cali
fornia's education budget and to
urge a sustained protest against
Gov. George Deukmejian's educa
tion policies.
About 120 to 140 students,
coming to Stanford from 30 Cali
fornia colleges, announced a
marching rally in Sacramento
April 10 and ratified a "call to ac
tion," or statement of protest, tar
geting Deukmejian's policies.
Representatives of the Asian
Pacific Student Union (APSU), the
African/Black Statewide Student
Alliance (A/BSSA) and Chicano
Students of the Southwest
(MEChA) said the governor has
not only Instigated budget cuts
that would affcct the quality of
education for all students, but has
also advocated education policies
adversely affecting minority edu
cation.
> The group's statement of
protest outlines the grievances the
minority associations have
against the governor's policies, ac

cording to A/BSSA member Steve
Phillips.
Some of those grievances are:
• The Governor s veto of an exten
sion to the Bilingual Education
Act, which allows minorities to
take classes in their native lan
guages while learning English.
• The governor's establishment of
the Commission to Review Master
Plan, which has recommended
limits on the number of remedial
classes allowed in community col
leges. A limitation on such classes
would prevent many minority stu
dents from continuing their edu
cation and from being able to
transfer to four-year schools, Phil
lips said.
• The 1983 imposition of tuition
for community colleges. Phillips
said this would discourage some
students from enrolling. Accord
ing to Phillips, about 80 percent of
blacks who attend college are in
community college programs.
• The governor's establishment of
new admissions requirements for
the California State University
system, "which threaten to lock
out huge numbers of Third World
and working class youth."
