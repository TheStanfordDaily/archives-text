## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Editor's welcome 
### 
I remember delivering The Boston Globe,
my hometown newspaper, when I was in first
and second grade. My brothers and I — be
tween the five of us we had about 100 cus
tomers — got up early, before dawn. A lot of
times, we were up and dressed so early that
we had to sit on the wall in front of my house
and wait for the man in the green Globe
truck to drive by and toss the bundle of
newspapers to us. Because we were probably
the only kids he saw each morning, we all got
to know each other pretty well, and we liked
him.
So I had a favorable impression of the
paper even before I knew how to spell. When I
grew older and actually began to read the
newspaper instead of simply deliver it, my
first impression didn't change. The Globe
has always had a wide and distinctive array
of personalities, and I still feel I know some of
its writers and columnists as well as I once
knew that man in the green truck.
All this is not to say that some guy in a
green delivery truck will soon be dropping off
The Daily at your dorm room, or that anyone
expects you to sit outside waiting for it (at
least you wouldn't have to get up too early).
But The Daily, too, is a paper of per
sonalities. The first time I walked in here and
picked up a story assignment, I was helped
by a friendly, easygoing editor; immediately,
I felt comfortable. That editor has since left
The Daily, but my initial impression has
stuck with me. In the past two years, my
feelings about The Daily haven't changed.
One of my main jobs as editor is to convey
that sense of personality and friendliness to
you. The Daily is a fun, enjoyable place to
work, and I hope it's an equally enjoyable
reading experience. In the coming months,
we'll try to make The Daily more of a paper

with personality, more of a paper that relates
well to the community.
I've always felt that the best newspaper is
nothing more than an accurate reflection of
the community it serves. To serve the com
munity well, though, a newspaper needs to
know its readership well — and vice versa.
Dorm presentations and more comprehen
sive coverage will help us get to know you bet
ter; a weekly editors' column and better com
munication between The Daily and other
student groups will help you get to know us
better. More interaction with the people who
read The Daily can only make it a better
newspaper.
There are a few other changes in this
morning's paper. The Update section is
smaller today; it will be occasionally, so we
can devote more space to Stanford news.
Happenings on this campus — and other col
lege campuses — are the focus of this paper.
The staff this volume is larger than it has
been in the past, too; more and better
coverage will result. And I suppose every new
editor makes a few small, admittedly
idiosyncratic changes in the look of the
paper. I'm no different in that respect.
Essentially, though, the purpose of The
Daily remains the same: to serve, reflect and
inform the community. We're all students,
and this job is an educational process;
sometimes we'll succeed, other times we'll
fail. Regardless, I hope you'll let us know —
or better yet, help us in our attempt.
