# State-regulated motherhood?
## 
### 
Suppose a childless couple hires a surrogate
mother to bear its child. After birth, the sur
rogate mother refuses to give up the child. Who
gets the child? Sounds like an interesting
hypothetical question for an evening discus
sion group or a Philosophy 101 exam. For New
Jersey Superior Court Judge Harvey Sorkow.
the question has become a stark reality.

Judge Sorkow must decide the nation's first
case involving the legality and enforceability of
surrogate motherhood. He fortunately only has
to decide in the limited context of one case un
der very specific circumstances. But the
reasoning he uses may have far-reaching con
sequences in future cases. But the diverse and
intense emotions associated with this case
make cold, rational logic difficult to apply.
William and Elizabeth Stern, a childless pro
fessional couple in their early forties, con
tracted with 29-year-old Mary Beth Whitehead,
a housewife with two children, to bear their
child for *10,000 plus medical expenses. The
Sterns had decided not to have children on
their own because Elizabeth's multiple
sclerosis could complicate a pregnancy.
The Sterns hired the Infertility Center of
New York, which put them in contact with
Whitehead and was to hold the money until
delivery. Whitehead conceived through artifi
cial insemination. She had signed a contract
agreeing not to form any parent-child relation
ship, but after the birth she refused the fee,
would not release the child and took the baby
home.
Judge Sorkow must decide who keeps the
baby.
Both sides have valid arguments as well as
emotional attachments. The long term impli
cation rests not on who wins but rather on
why they win. The Whiteheads will argue that
society has traditionally respected the bond be
tween a mother and her child. Whitehead
carried and nurtured the baby for nine
months. The Sterns could be repaid their
*10,000 and be restored to their original posi
tion. The government should not enforce a

contract that requires the selling of a human
being.
The Sterns, on the other hand, can argue
that they entered a valid, legal contract that
was free of coercion, and they met their obliga
tion by paying the $10,000. As in any child
custody suit, the welfare of {.he child should be
paramount and the Sterns could better afford
financially to raise a child and would provide a
better home. The Whiteheads already have two
children of their own. Mr. Stern is the natural
father and should have the same rights as the
mother. Finding a surrogate mother is a legal,
moral, acceptable alternative for a couple
unable to have their own children and the con
tract should be enforced.
The government is being forced to become
involved in yet another ethical moral dilemma
that accompanies rapid technological and
societal change. This case will be the govern
ment's first step toward banning, sanctioning
or regulating the surrogate mother. In this
case, inaction contitutes an action.
If the courts declare the practice illegal, they
are inviting an underground criminal element
to take over. The costs would be greater, the
risks would be higher and safeguards of
human dignity would be gone. Enforcement of
the law would be nearly impossible. Adoption
can take years of frustration and paperwork.
But surrogate parenting should certainly be
more legal than abortion, since it is creating a
life rather than destroying one.
If the government sanctions the practice,
how involved should it become in the regula
tion? In the absense of regulation, private en
terprise will continue as it is. The laws of
supply and demand dictate the marketplace.
Since producing babies requires no training or
education, many poor women who cannot find
jobs are willing to do it. If the motive is profit,
the potential for exploitation is immense.
Competitive advertising and large computer
data bases help the wealthy childless couple
fulfill their dreams, but certain precautions
are needed for both parties.
If the government regulates this practice, it
would take funding, and the government
would become an intimate partner. But to
what degree? Would the taxpayers be billed for
enforcement and monitoring agencies? Would
this option be availiable to women capable of
conceiving children but unwilling to take time
off from their careers? Would a medical diag
nosis be necessary? Should there be a "cooling

off' period to allow the surrogate mother time
to change her mind? Would there be manda
tory counseling for potential surrogate moth
ers? Who would provide It?
With greater use of the in vitro procedure,
wiierej.be laboratory-fertilized egg of one
woman is inserted into the womb of another, a
mother could hire someone else to produce her
child. A woman who wants to avoid stopping
work or wants to preserve her figure would be
sorely tempted. Morning sickness, extra
weight and labor pains are no bargain. We hire
people to care for our children, cook our meals
and clean our homes. Why not hire someone to
carry the ultimate burden of bearing our
children? If the practice becomes acceptable,
will employers pressure women to use sur
rogate mothers? Should we allow this new pro
fession to flourish?
The potential for disputes is immense and
every conceivable twist will ultimately have to
be decided. What happens if the baby dies in
childbirth? Does the mother still get her fee?
What if the death is related to drug or alchohol
use by the surrogate mother during preg
nancy? What if the child is retarded or
deformed? Would a mother who did not have
time to get pregnant have time to care for an
unhealthy child? If a surrogate mother realizes
that the hiring couple is unfit, could she stop
the proceedings? Under what conditions could
a surrogate mother break a contract? What
would happen if the hiring couple gets
divorced prior to delivery? Would two gay men
have the same rights as a heterosexual couple?
We may look back in several years and think
that Judge Sorkow had a pretty easy case
compared to some that followed.
I have not even addressed the religious and
political issues involved. Predictably, the Cath
olic Church and numerous other groups are
against the practice completely. This is an
emotional issue which will require delicate
compromise, reasoned thought and sensitive
awareness.
The Whiteheads and the Sterns are only the
beginning. Lines will be drawn with each suc
cessive case. Judge Sorkow's decision will set
the tone for questions that must later be re
solved. I have not proposed any solutions. It is
hard enough to understand the ramifications
of the question.
