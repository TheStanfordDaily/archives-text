Dean deserves
better
It seems a shame that the death
of one of America's leading
geologists, a main contributor to
the plate tectonics theory, and
dean of Stanford's School of
Earth Sciences warrants the
position of lead story only after
The Dally uncovers bits of sen
sationalism about the circum
stances surrounding his appar
ent suicide.
1 hope that The Dally will
choose to give a balanced editorial
account of Dean Cox's ac
complishments in addition to the
minutiae, already published, of

his private life and death.

Why not white
theme house
In his recent letter (Daily. Jan.
30). sophomore Michael Myers
writes that the Zetes might have
a better chance of regaining
housing "if they were lepers
â€” after all. there are theme
houses for blacks. Hispanics and
Orientals." Golly-gee-wiz! Nobody
ever told me that being Oriental
was a disease I guess I should go
to Cowell. get cured and turn
white. (My parents would disown

me. but that would be a small
price to pay to rid my body of this
contagion.) Until I'm well I'll try to
avoid infecting any healthy white
males with my Orientalism. Pity
my poor freshman roommate.
When he came to Stanford, he
was a healthy. Protestant, white
male. Now. he speaks .Japanese. 1
had better warn him to get
prompt medical attention before
he turns any more Oriental.
Seriously, if Mr. Myers feels
ostracized by a Stanford student
body that doesn't understand his
white ethnicity. I would recom
mend that he submit a proposal
to ResEd for a white theme
house. The house could sponsor
programs 011 counteracting anti
white stereotypes, host seminars
on white culture and help white

students adjust to the demands
of a white society. The house
should be open to members of all
ethnic backgrounds, sexes and
religions (just as the current
ethnic theme houses are) who are
interested in learning more about
the white-American ethnic experi
ence. A suitable location would
probably be one of the houses in
Florence Moore Hall, since each of
the other large dorms already has
an ethnic theme house. Rather
than complaining about ethnic
theme houses, we should work
for a new house that will help
non-whites understand whites
and encourage whites to explore
their own ethnic heritage.
