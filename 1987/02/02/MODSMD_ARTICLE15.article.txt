Just what the hell does the
ASSU Senate do? Well . . . uh . . .
one of the Senate's primary goals
is to serve in some capacity as the
"official" voice for student con
cerns, especially when these con
cerns conflict with Administra
tion concerns. For instance,
throughout the battle for divest
ment, the Senate has offered sup
port to SOSA and spoken as a

ERIC ALLEN

popularly elected student group to
try to influence the Administra
tion's stance on divestment. An
other example is the current furor
over the reduction of funds for
several varsity sports. The Senate
has attempted to facilitate a con
certed effort among the involved
students to get the financial sup
port for the sports reinstated.
Recently, the University Dead
Week policy has come under Sen
ate scrutiny. Should Dead Week
be deadened? If so, the Senate will
probably be the body that
represents the student point of
view in the debate with the Ad
ministration.
Generally speaking, the Senate
is always aiming to increase stu
dent control over University af
fairs. There are, however, two
sides of the coin. One side con
tends that student control should
be minimal. We are, after all, only
temporary members of the Stan
ford community. Student inter
ests change over the course of
several years. How can we claim to
speak for the interests of all stu
dents. past, present and future?
This side of the coin goes further
and asks on what grounds do the
students claim their voice in Uni
versity matters. A university,
despite popular opinion, is not a
democracy. It is a business. They
sell, we buy. If the students don't
like what the administration is
selling, then perhaps they should
shop elsewhere. If you don't like
Stanford's investment policy or
Dead Weak policy, transfer!
There is, of course, the other
point of view. This side contends
that a university has no interests
other than to serve the interests of
Its students. Therefore, it follows
that student input in univeristy

matters should always be sought
out. Who understands the needs
and concerns of students better
than other students? Further
more, students should not be re
garded as only passing visitors in
the Stanford community; the
needs, worries and general con
cerns of students are essentially
unchanging. With this in mind,
how can the University Ignore stu
dent demands for divestment or a
reformed Dead Week policy?
By now you are probably won
dering what inspired me to write
this mini-dissertation. As men
tioned earlier, the Senate has the
resonsibility of recognizing stu
dent concerns or gripes and
searching for solutions to student
problems. Often these solutions
lead to some University commit
tee, board or administrator. Fur
thermore, the solution usually
boils down to trying to increase
student control over that particu
lar area of university life, be it di
vestment, athletics, Dead Week or
Western Culture. With this in
mind, the Senate has planned a
forum on student control in Uni
versity life. Both student leaders
and University administrators will
present their opinions, perspec
tives, reservations and hopes for
student control in University af
fairs. Speaking on oehalf of the
students will be representatives
from the Black Student Union, the
ASSU Senate, Stanford Out of
South Africa, the Interfraternity
Council and club sports.
Representing the administration
will be Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, Vice Provost of Man
agement Ray Bacchetti, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee, Trustee James Ware and
Director of Athletics Andy Geiger.
The ASSU Senate is hopeful
that some greater understanding
of the role of students in the Uni
versity decision-making process
can be found. We plan to step back
and take a long look at the under
lying rift between students and
faculty. Perhaps we can finally see
long-term solutions to the prob
lems that students present to the
faculty. The forum is scheduled
for Wednesday in Cubberley
Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. A ques
tion/answer/discussion period
will follow, so bring gripes,
opinions and questions.
