## Life at Stanford: nothing more than a soap opera? 
### JULIANA HORSEMAN 
"Jerry asks his roommate Dil
lard what he did after Big Game.
Dillard can't quite remember.
He says he started out with the
dorm but then got tanked and
somehow ended up at the
suites. All he can recall is
waking up next to some random
girl. There is a knock on the
door. The girl walks in. Dillard
doesn't recognize her."
Part of a Gaieties script?
Wrong. It's the new Stanford
soap opera. "General Dor
mitory." starring Marcie Gilbert.
Andrew Buckley and Jill Yonas,
along with four other Stanford
students.
Written, directed, produced
and managed by Jon Louis, the
soap should be aired next
month on the new student
channel of the SUNet television
network.
"I don't know of any other
school, except Duke, where the
idea has been tried," said Louis,
a fifth-year communication stu
dent from New Orleans.
Louis is excited with his new
project, which got off the ground
last Sunday with a clip shot at
Lagunita.
Auditions were held on Jan.
23 in the communication build
ing basement, where some 50
interested actors attempted to
earn one of the seven lead roles.
Most had heard of the auditions
through fliers that were dis
tributed in dorms.
Improvisational talents were
the main test for those audition
ing. After the actors were given
the basic situation and one or
two sentences about the soap's
characters, the cameras rolled.
"We wanted the acting to be as
natural as possible," explained
Natalie Beauchene. one of Louis'
technical assistants.
'We don't want the actors to
have to come in here and
memorize a bunch of lines. A lot
of the real filming will be like
that, " she said.
Students gave a variety of
reasons for auditioning. "My
girlfriend said she would be
trying out, so 1 decided to give it
a shot," one junior said.
"I love acting and enjoy watch
ing soap operas." freshman Mia
Zamora said.
Louis was pleased with the
turnout. "A lot of talent walked

through that door," he said.
Louis admitted that he had
written the first episode's script
with certain people in mind, and
that there was somewhat of a
search for stereotypes.
However, "I have an open
mind for talent if it appears and
I'm willing to create new charac
ters to match that talent," Louis
said.
Louis' experience with the
film medium dates back to his
childhood, when he acted in
several television commercials.
At Stanford he worked as tech
nical director for the Stanford
Instructional Television Net
work (SITN).
Most of his film projects are
the results of his film produc
tion courses with the Communi
cation Department. Such proj
ects include a short horror spoof
entitled "Daz-aster," shown
before the ASSU Sunday Flick
last night.
A Stanford soap opera proved
a popular choice among the
Stanford potential viewing audi
ence â€” namely those dorms that
receive SUNet cable program
ming. Interest forms asked
dorm residents to Indicate what
they would like to see on the new
student channel, channel "10"
on a television connected to the
system. A soap opera, news,
sports and aerobics programs
were the popular choices.
Louis and his crew are aiming
to produce six half-hour
episodes, all of which deal with
campus-related situations.
However, if the project proves to

be a success, more scripts will
be written.
The title, "General Dor
mitory", is derived from the idea
that the seven lead characters all
lived in the same dorm during
their freshman year.
Scenes will be filmed all over
campus, including inside dor
mitories.
Louis was confident that the
soap will attract viewers.
"I think it will work because
it's a Stanford University proj
ect. People want to watch their
friends act. The idea intrigues a
lot of people." Louis said.
The only drawback of this
project is its lack of funding.
"Presently we only have
enough money for one camera.
This means we have to do a lot of
double-takes." Beauchene said.
Organizers hope for student
contributions, as the ASSU Sen
ate Funding Committee has not
proved helpful.
"We have to show . . . that
we're capable of a semi
professional project, in order to
get support, which we are,"
Louis said.
Louis, the 1986 NCAA men's
gymnastics champion, aspires
to be a director of quality major
motion pictures someday. Per
haps "General Dormitory" is the
first step to his goal.
In the meantime, does Louis
watch soaps himself? "Never.
They're a waste of time. I'd
rather be doing something more
constructive, which is any
thing," he said.
