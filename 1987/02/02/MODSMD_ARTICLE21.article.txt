## Disastrous weekend for Card in Oregon Stanford women 5-4 after losses to Beavers, Ducks 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
EUGENE, Ore. — If only the first
half counted in women's college
basketball, then Stanford would
have come home with two wins on
the road in Oregon this weekend.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal
wound up dropping decisions at
both Oregon State and Oregon to
fall to 5-4 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and 11-8 overall.
"I would have been happy if it
had been called at halftime — If
the power had gone out or some
thing," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said after Friday night's
70-53 loss to OSU, which at the
time tied the Beavers with Stan
ford at 5-3 for third place In the
conference.
"Maybe they should make the
girls' games 20 minutes instead of
40. We've already got the smaller
ball," VanDerveer said following
Saturday night's 65-51 loss at
Oregon, which raised Oregon's
record to 6-3.
Both games were remarkably
similar. Against both the Ducks
and the Beavers, the Cardinal was
beset by foul troubles, turnovers
and an inability to get its offense
running.
The primary reason for the loss
at Oregon Saturday night was
fouls — 29 total to be precise.
Twenty-nine compared to just
nine for the Ducks: the Cardinal
did not go into the bonus in either
half. Oregon went into the bonus
with 12:01 left in the second half.
Oregon had 38 attempts from the
line and made 23 — Stanford had
only nine free throws and made
seven.

Four Cardinal players fouled out
— center Jill Yanke with 12:03 left
in the second half, forward Katy
Steding with 6:18 left, forward
Evon Asforis with 2:54 left and
point guard Jennifer Azzi at the
1:53 mark.
"People did foul," VanDerveer
said. "Honestly there were some
fouls. Oregon was doing the same
thing as us though."
Part of the difficulty that Stan
ford confronted was Oregon's size.
Duck freshman center Stefanie
Kasperski, who finished with 10
points, is 6-foot-7. Gabi Neu
mann, a 6-5 senior, led the Ducks
with 14 points. Six-foot-three Kris
Glidden had 12 points and pulled
down a career-high 18 rebounds,
including nine offensive boards.
Stanford's top rebounder was
freshman Katy Steding, who had
nine following 13 the previous
night against OSU. Overall the
Cardinal was outrebounded 52-
40.
"Their bigness was extreme,"
VanDerveer said, "and then they
won't let you play any defense on
them."
Fouls and Oregon's size were
not the only problems Stanford
faced — the Cardinal's shooting
was also a cause for concern.
Despite going into halftime with a
24-22 lead on a Steding shot in
the lane with :02 left on the clock,
Stanford shot only 29 percent —
12 for 41. Azzi was 0 for 5 and An
derson was 5 for 14, eventually
finishing 8-of-20 to lead the Card
inal.
Things didn't get much better

Sophomore forward Bryan McSweeney was one of several Stanford
subs to get into the game yesterday during the Cardinal's 68-55 loss
at Oregon. Stanford dropped into seventh place in the Pac-10 with a 5-
6 conference record.
in the second half in which Stan
ford made 35 percent of its shots,
averaging 31 percent on the night.
Azzi totalled 11 points but sank
only 3of 11. Stedlng scored 10 on
5-of-11 shooting.
The Cardinal also suffered long
streaks without scoring, going
6:36 at one point in the first half
without scoring a bucket, and had
another drought of 4:58 in the
second half.
It was this last streak that was
most costly for the Cardinal,
which battled back from a 41-35
deficit to go up 43-41 with 8:00 to
play and then failed to score again
until 3:22 on an Anderson
jumper. During that period, the
Ducks reeled off 15 straight points
to go up 56-43, and never led by
less than 10 points after that.
Still, the game was an improve
ment on the previous night, in
which the Cardinal had a 32-31
lead over OSU at the half, only to
go down 33-32 in the opening
minute on a Chelle Flamoe fast
break lay-in. The Beavers never
trailed again, going up 45-37 with
12:12 left, then 53-41 at 9:41.
