It just wasn't a good week for the
Elway family. First. John and his
Denver Bronco teammates were
pummeled by the New York Giants
in the Super Bowl. Then, on
Friday. Stanford's Michelle
Grlgllone did a Lawrence Taylor
number on Janet Buchan's
DeGuerre Pool record in the 400-
yard Individual medley, shaving
more than three seconds off the
mark set by the future Mrs. John
Elway with a 4:17.63 timing.
The news was not all bad for the
Elways, though, as their alma
mater won two big weekend swim
ming meets, dropping No. 4 USC
97-43 on Friday and hammering
No. 5 UCLA 189.5-78.5 Saturday.
Grlgllone copped second In the
400 IM at last summer's World
Championships, and the touted
freshman was still nearly five
seconds off her personal best in
her record-setting performance.
"It felt good to set the pool
record." Grlgllone said. "But the
swim didn't feel that good. I'm not
used to swimming that many
events In one day. My best time is
a 4:12. Hopefully, by NCAAs I'll be
under that."
Friday was a busy day for
Grlgllone as she also won the 200
butterfly In an NCAA qualifying
time and anchored the winning
400 freestyle relay. In addition,
she swam In a talent-packed 100

another day at the office as she

200 freestyle and swam the third
leg on the victorious 400 medley.
"Jenna Johnson is Jenna
Johnson." USC Coach Don
LaMont said. "We knew she would
come In and win her three
events."
However, according to Stanford

Coach George Haines, Johnson's
victories were not as effortless as
they seemed. "I was worried about
her a little bit," he said. "She was
out about 10 or 12 days around
Christmas with a high fever, and
she's just rounding Into shape. "
Stanford s Michelle Donahue

strokes and joined Griglione and
