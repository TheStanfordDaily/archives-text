## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
It just wasn't a good week for the
Elway family. First. John and his
Denver Bronco teammates were
pummeled by the New York Giants
in the Super Bowl. Then, on
Friday. Stanford's Michelle
Grlgllone did a Lawrence Taylor
number on Janet Buchan's
DeGuerre Pool record in the 400-
yard Individual medley, shaving
more than three seconds off the
mark set by the future Mrs. John
Elway with a 4:17.63 timing.
The news was not all bad for the
Elways, though, as their alma
mater won two big weekend swim
ming meets, dropping No. 4 USC
97-43 on Friday and hammering
No. 5 UCLA 189.5-78.5 Saturday.
Grlgllone copped second In the
400 IM at last summer's World
Championships, and the touted
freshman was still nearly five
seconds off her personal best in
her record-setting performance.
"It felt good to set the pool
record." Grlgllone said. "But the
swim didn't feel that good. I'm not
used to swimming that many
events In one day. My best time is
a 4:12. Hopefully, by NCAAs I'll be
under that."
Friday was a busy day for
Grlgllone as she also won the 200
butterfly In an NCAA qualifying
time and anchored the winning
400 freestyle relay. In addition,

Johnson." USC Coach Don
LaMont said. "We knew she would
come In and win her three
events."
However, according to Stanford

Coach George Haines, Johnson's
victories were not as effortless as
they seemed. "I was worried about
her a little bit," he said. "She was
out about 10 or 12 days around
Christmas with a high fever, and
she's just rounding Into shape. "

When I sat at home and figured It
up. 1 came out 96-44. We've swam
against (No. 1) Texas, and we've
swam against Stanford, but after
today. I'd have to give a slight edge
to Stanford."
While they only qualified five
swimmers the next day In routing
UCLA at a sun-kissed DeGuerre,
the Stanford swimmers once
again met their goals.
"Our goal was to make the cuts

number on Janet Buchan's
DeGuerre Pool record in the 400-
yard Individual medley, shaving
more than three seconds off the
mark set by the future Mrs. John
Elway with a 4:17.63 timing.
The news was not all bad for the
Elways, though, as their alma
mater won two big weekend swim
ming meets, dropping No. 4 USC
97-43 on Friday and hammering
No. 5 UCLA 189.5-78.5 Saturday.
Grlgllone copped second In the
400 IM at last summer's World
Championships, and the touted
freshman was still nearly five
seconds off her personal best in
her record-setting performance.
"It felt good to set the pool
record." Grlgllone said. "But the
swim didn't feel that good. I'm not
used to swimming that many
events In one day. My best time is
a 4:12. Hopefully, by NCAAs I'll be
under that."
Friday was a busy day for
Grlgllone as she also won the 200
butterfly In an NCAA qualifying
time and anchored the winning

another day at the office as she
also won the 100 butterfly and the
200 freestyle and swam the third
leg on the victorious 400 medley.
"Jenna Johnson is Jenna
Johnson." USC Coach Don
LaMont said. "We knew she would
come In and win her three
events."
However, according to Stanford

Coach George Haines, Johnson's
victories were not as effortless as
they seemed. "I was worried about
her a little bit," he said. "She was
out about 10 or 12 days around
Christmas with a high fever, and
she's just rounding Into shape. "

won both the 100 and 200 back
strokes and joined Griglione and

For Stanford It was a meet in
which 14 qualifying times were
hit. eight for the first time.

According to LaMont, the meet
was "exactly what we expected.
When I sat at home and figured It
up. 1 came out 96-44. We've swam
against (No. 1) Texas, and we've
swam against Stanford, but after
today. I'd have to give a slight edge
to Stanford."
While they only qualified five
swimmers the next day In routing
UCLA at a sun-kissed DeGuerre,
the Stanford swimmers once
again met their goals.
"Our goal was to make the cuts

In the 400 medley and 200 free
relays, and we did." Haines said.

to give some other swimmers a
shot at their cuts. Instead of

pool record by a bare tenth of a
second and qualified with a 23.60.

than double Its number of NCAA
qualifiers during the weekend.
Haines was also upbeat as he
looked forward to next Saturday's
showdown with No. 1 Texas.

both days." he said. "1 couldn't
have asked for a better perfor
