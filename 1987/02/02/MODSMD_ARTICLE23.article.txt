### SUSAN SLUSSER Senior staff writer 
EUGENE. Ore. -The state of
Oregon was not kind to Stanford
basketball teams this weekend, as
the Oregon Ducks downed the
Stanford men's team 68-55 at
McArthur Court before a crowd of
7,479 yesterday to raise Oregon's
record to 12-8 overall and 6-5 in
the Pacific 10 Conference and
drop Stanford to 11-9 and 5-6.
Stanford is alone in seventh
place in the Pac-10. while Oregon
is now tied with California for
fifth.
It was the fourth straight night
that a Cardinal basketball squad
lost to an Oregon school, as the
men's team fell 71-59 to Oregon
State Thursday night, and the
women's team dropped a pair of
games at OSU and Oregon Friday
and Saturday night.
Things started off fairly well for
Stanford, as halftime found the
Cardinal tied 28-28 — just as the
team was tied 27-27 at Oregon
State. Then, as in the OSU game,
Stanford quickly fell behind in the
second half.
The Cardinal managed a first
half tie despite being out
rebounded 24-13 and despite the
5-for-6 shooting and 11 points of
junior forward Jesse Nash. This
feat was accomplished primarily
because dangerous guards David
Girley and Anthony Taylor were
held scoreless in the first period,
shooting a combined 0 for 10.
"Nash really helped them,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "He was great the

first half; he kept them In the ball
game."
Meanwhile, at the other end of
the court. Stanford center Howard
Wright was a perfect 3 for 3 from
the floor and 1 for 1 from the line
for seven points, while forward
Todd Lichti was 3 for 6 shooting,
including a three-pointer, and 1
for 1 from the line for eight points.
The second half was a complete
reversal. Taylor scored all of his
game-high 16 points and Girley
added seven, while Lichti, who en
tered the contest averaging 18.1
points per game, scored just two
points in the second period and
totalled 10 for the game on 4-for
-10 shooting.
"Their defense kept an eye on
where I was," Lichti said. "I didn't
shoot the ball particularly well
either."
"Oregon did a nice job on
Lichti," Montgomery said. "You've
got to give Oregon credit. They
played well the second half — ex
teremely well."
In fact, the Ducks, who shot just
35 percent in the first half, shot
62 percent in the second half,
while Stanford's percentage
dropped from 44 percent in the
opening period to 35 percent in
the last. A good indication of the
Cardinal's woes from the field is
that Eric Reveno and Greg Butler,
alternating at the power forward
spot, were a combined 2 for 13.
"It wasn't Oregon's ability to
score that hurt us," Montgomery
said. "It was our inability to
score. ... So often you talk about
