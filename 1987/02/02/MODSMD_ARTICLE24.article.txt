# Plemel throws 3-hitter in Stanford's 6-2 win
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
"We're not going to sneak up on anybody this year
because we've got most of last season's pitching staff
back this year," Stanford Manager Mark Marquess
said yesterday.
If the Cardinal hurlers keep up the standard
they've set through the first three games of the
season. Marquess will be a prophet.
Junior right-hander Lee Plemel tossed a three
hitter to lead Stanford (2-1 overall) to a 6-2 win over
Santa Clara yesterday at Sunken Diamond. The
Cardinal staff has now given up just five runs
through three games, and the two Plemel allowed
yesterday were unearned.
"His worst inning was the first," Marquess said.
"After that he got in his rhythm. He was throwing his
breaking ball for strikes. It's so off-speed it makes his
fastball look five miles-an-hour faster, and he's also
got a hard slider to throw in there. He was tough
today."
Plemel, as in his last outing against San Jose
State, had a rather shaky first inning. Experiencing
a little control trouble, he retired the first two hitters
after going to 3-2 counts on both. Santa Clara

rlghtfielder Jeff Healy followed with a single, and
third baseman Gary Maasberg walked.
Despite the rocky start, Plemel may have escaped
the Inning unscathed, but Stanford freshman third
baseman Brian Johnson committed a run-scoring
error. Plemel then Induced designated hitter Chris
McCall to ground to first to end the Inning.
"I was having trouble getting my curveball over for
strikes In the first Inning," Plemel said. "The rest of
the game I knew I was going to stay with the curve
ball, because I started throwing it for strikes.
"I threw the curveball for strikes to get ahead in the
count. Then I threw it to try to get them to chase it
out of the strike zone. If they didn't chase it, I
brought it back into the zone," he added.
He didn't use the curveball exclusively, however.
"I was throwing some first-pitch sliders to get
ahead in the count. The book on Santa Clara is that
they only swing at fastballs on the first pitch," Plemel
said.
Santa Clara's one-run lead was very short-lived. In
the Cardinal second, junior designated hitter Jeff
Saenger led off with a walk. Centerfielder Toi Cook
followed with a single, his first hit of the season.
Alter rlghtflclder Paul Carry
walked, sophomore first baseman
Hon Wltmeyer delivered a game
winning double to right that
scored all three runners.
"Initially It lookrd like the ball
was going to be caught. Hut lie hit
It so goddam hard, and it had a lot
of backspln so It carried."
Marquess said. "It was really
crushed. He (rlghtflclder Healy)
wasn't that close to catching it
after he froze on It. That was the
hit of the game for us."
Senior shortstop David Ksquer
scored Wltmeyer with a
groundball to short before
• Johnson grounded to third to end
the Inning.
Two «it the key players In that
rally also figured in the third in
ning outburst that accounted for
the Cardinal's last two runs.
Sophomore shortstop Frank
Carey led off the Inning with a
walk and stole second, one of
seven Cardinal thefts on the day.
Saenger singled, moving Carey to

third. Cook, a senior, drove In the
first run with a ground ball to
short, and Paul Carey knocked In
the other with an opposhe-flcld
single.
Just a freshman. Paul Carey has
already come through several
times this season when the Card
inal has needed a key hit.
Carey's catch of Maasberg's
leadoff drive In the Santa Clara
fourth squelched a rally before It
could get started.
Cook, who went 2 for 4. Is now
starting to get comfortable at the
plate after only nine days of prac
ticing with the team since the end
of the football season.
"1 was happy to finally get a
couple of hits. I swung the bat all
right today. I've got to get myself
back Into the mental aspect of the
game; I'm still thinking about
football a little bit," Cook said.
Senior left fielder Ruben Ainaro
also had an excellent day for the
Cardinal, going 3 for 5. all singles,
and stealing two bases.
The Cardinal will attempt to
make up Friday's rainout at
Sunken Diamond today at 2 p.m.
against Santa Clara.
