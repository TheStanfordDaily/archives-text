### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
This weekend In Dallas. Stan
ford Men's Swimming Coaeh
Skip Kenney made two observa
tions about his team. One. his
athletes are very talented. Two.
they need more speedwork.
After the first day of the Dallas
Morning News Classic, the Card
inal. with 142 points, was tied
for first with Florida. Highlights
of Saturday's competition in
cluded individual wins by Jeff
Kostoff In the 400-yard individ
ual medley and Pablo Morales in
the 100 butterfly.
But after the second day of
competition the Cardinal found

itsef in second, and according to
Kenney the team "was real for
tunate to be there."
Again there was no lack of in
dividual performance. Kostoff
won his second race of the
weekend with a 4:24.3 clocking
in the 500 free. The senior was
joined In the winner's circle by
teammate Anthony Mosse.
whose time of 1:48.2 was good
for a victory in the 200 fly.
The problem on Sunday was
not individuals. It was relays.
Unable to score enough points
in the relays on Sunday, the
Cardinal was forced to settle for
second. Stanford finished the
weekend with 271 points, nine
points behind first-place Florida
and just three ahead of third

place Texas.
"This meet showed some of
our weaknesses." Kenney said.
"We're just starting to work on
speed. This weekend showed we
have to do more.
"All of them (the swimmers)
had at least one real good race.
We just have to get into a
groove."
Kenney left the meet with
mixed feelings. "I was real
pleased with all the individuals,
real disappointed with the
relays." he said. Overall,
however, he thought the team
would benefit from the experi
ence.
"This meet is going to be very
helpful for us this weekend
against UCLA." Kenney said.
