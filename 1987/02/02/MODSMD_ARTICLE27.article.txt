### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
BERKELEY — It's a hard-knock life sometimes, as
the Stanford women's gymnastics team discovered
Saturday night, finishing third in the California In
vitational and scoring a 176.15 in the meet here.
California won the competition with a 180.40, fol
lowed closely by Washington at 179.55. UC-Santa
Barbara took up the rear, finishing with a mark of
170.50.
"Reflecting on the meet, 1 don't think we had that
bad of a meet," Stanford Coach Homer Sardina said.
"We were just off. We had a lot of nervous energy, and
our timing was off."
The Cardinal started the meet off on a bad foot
with a series of missed routines on the uneven paral
lel bars and balance beam. "We had eight falls on
bars and five on beam," Sardina observed. "Missed
routines cost us six points."
"The meet started out pretty slow." freshman Be
cky Ashton said, "but we got refoeused and finished
off pretty strong."
"It wasn't as good as the last meet, but it's still
early in the season," sophomore Jinny Rhee said.
Rhee led the Cardinal with an all-around score of
35.80.
"I'm glad the whole team pulled together after two
bad events," she added. "It's discouraging when we
start off with a bad event, because it puts us behind
at the start."

Stanford Asst. Coach Gary Smith echoed her senti
ments. "Seeing them start to pull together on the
other events shows composure," he said.
"There were some good things, like Dina
(Amoroso) on vault." Smith added. Amoroso, a fresh
man who finished the meet with a 34.80 in the all
around, won the vaulting event with a P. 4. In addi
tion, Stanford as a team led the meet with a 45.55 on
the apparatus.
Another highlight for the Cardinal was the perfor
mance of sophomore co-captain Cheryl Doo, who tied
with junior co-captain Alison McGann for second
place on the Stanford team with 35.50. "Cheryl
didn't miss," Sardina said. "She's a great competi
tor. She doesn't like to miss, and she's aggressive
when it comes to being aggressive.
"There were some positive things about the meet,"
he added. "We'll use it as a learning experience."
The experience may be costly for the Cardinal,
however, as sophomore Sheri Evenson injured her
knee on the floor exercise. Evenson. one of the
strongest performers on the team, earned a 9.0 on
the event in spite of the injury and then managed to
execute a fine vault, garnering a 9.0, before being
carried away for treatment.
"Sheri hurt herself, but we don't know how serious
it is," Sardina said.
Nonetheless, Sardina remains optimistic about
Friday's Cardinal Classic, where Stanford will face
Cal once again. "We'll get them back next week, when
we have the home court advantage."
