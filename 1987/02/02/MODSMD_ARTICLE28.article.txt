# Netters tripped by Irvine
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
In reality, the match was not
very close. But for the small
chance of not being able to get a
racket out of the way. Stanford
might have come out a winner
Friday.
Having lost four of six singles
matches to UC-lrvine, the Stan
ford men's tennis team needed to
sweep all three doubles matches to
pull out a victory. With the other
two doubles teams leading their
matches. Stanford's No. 2 team of
Jeff Cathrall and Jeff Tarango
narrowly lost. 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, and
the Cardinal fell to the Anteaters,
5-2.
At 5-4 in the third set, Irvine's
Trevor Kronemann and Mark
Kaplan were serving for the
match. Kronemann double
faulted to put Cathrall and
Tarango a point away from break
ing to get even.
On the ensuing point. Cathrall
was unable to avoid hitting a ball
that was apparently going out.
Irvine's pair ended up winning
that point and the next to clinch
the Anteater victory.
"They had a streak and they got
a run on us," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said, "but we got back in
there. In fact, we had the break;
we had a ball that we couldn't get a
racket out of the way of on break
point that was going long."
At the time, Stanford's top
doubles team of Patrick McEnroe
and Scott Moody, after losing the
first set to Julian Barham and
Darren Yates, had won nine
straight games, while in court
three, Eric Peus and Curtis Dunn
had edged Irvine's Mike Cadigan
and Shige Kanroji in the first set,
7-6 (7-5).
"I guess I was most pleased
about the way we stayed together
in doubles," Gould said. "Number
one lost the first set, won the
second (and) was going well in the
third. . . . Third doubles did a
pretty good job down there.
"But its tough when you get be
hind 4-2 and you dig your own
grave a bit," Gould added. "It's
really tough to get out of that and
we stayed in there pretty well."
Stanford was victorious in the
first two singles matches com
pleted, as Barry Richards defeated
Richard Lubner, 6-3, 6-3, and
Tarango knocked off Yates. 6-3. 6-
3.
"That's the second match in a
row Barry's played well," Gould
said. "Jeff continues to play well.
He's doing some things very, very

well (though) he got a little care
less in the second set."
"I grew up with (Yates)."
Tarango said. "We played at the
same club for about seven years,
so we pretty much knew each
other's game. It was just a matter
of going out and playing and who
was better today."
But the Cardinal was already in
trouble in the other matches
against the Anteaters, who had
already defeated two top-20 teams
on their current road trip and nar
rowly lost to a third.
In the next three matches to be
completed. Cathrall lost to
Kronemann 6-2, 6-3, Geordie
McKee lost to Cadigan, 6-4, 6-3,
and McEnroe lost to Kaplan, 6-4,
6-4.
"I was pretty unsure (about the
match) going in," Kaplan said. "I
heard (McEnroe) was a good
player, but as the match
progressed I got more confident
and I knew I could beat him."
So the first crucial moment of
the day came in the Moody-
Kanroji match. In the third set.

Kanroji double-faulted to give
Moody the break and tie the set at
4-4. But It was to be the last point
Kanroji would lose on his serve in
the match.
Moody also held his serve, and
the match proceeded to a tie
breaker. Kanroji then dominated
the tiebreaker to win 6-2, 2-6, 7-6
(7-1), and the grave was dug.
"Obviously, 1 think our team
has matured a lot," Irvine Coach
Greg Patton said. "It's only a ques
tion of how you look in the mirror
and what you see.
"If you've got a mole on your
cheek and you're looking at just
the mole." Patton added, "then
you think you're ugly. But if you
start looking at the smile, then all
of a sudden you think you're good
looking. That's what my team's
smarting to do this year. We're not
looKing at our weaknesses; we're
looking at our strengths."
Stanford's record fell to 1-1. The
Cardinal hosts Rollins College
Friday.
Irvine, after losing to California
8-1 Saturday, is now 3-2.
