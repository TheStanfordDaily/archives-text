# Friedan calls for new thinking to preserve family
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
American society must "go
beyond the male model" and enter
a "second stage" of thinking in or
der to preserve the family and its
traditional values, according to
Betty Friedan, nationally ac
claimed feminist author.
Friedan, founder and first presi
dent of the National Organization
for Women, gave the keynote ad
dress Saturday morning to the
You Can Make a Difference Con
ference, sponsored by the Public
Service Center. The theme of the
conference was "Families in
Transition", and its purpose was,
according to the center, to
"examine the impact of a chang
ing society."
Friedan did just that, outlining
several principles Americans
should follow in order to deal with

families in transition. The first in
volves recognition of changes in
the structure of the American
family. "There is no way to
preserve values of the family while
denying change." said Friedan,
who attributed such denial to con
servative groups, which have been
"waving a kind of Hag to return
the female and the family to the
old traditional model — the ob
solete family of western nostal
gia."
Friedan. author of The
Feminine Mystique, said that the
traditional "nuclear family" of a
working father, housewife, son
and daughter is no longer typical.
"The reality, of course, is that 93
percent of Americans no longer
live in that structure. The family
is only an endangered species if
you're looking that they must rep
resent this model. We must,
however, recognize the reality."
she said.
To deal with this reality.
Friedan asked the audience to
consider "different possibilities:
New ideas and thinking must
arise in order to preserve old
values like democracy, equality,
freedom, family and love."
Friedan, described by opening
speaker Assemblyman John Vas
concellos (D-San Jose) as having
"literally opened up the issue of
women's liberation," went on to
emphasize the need for laws that
would allow both men and women
to take time off of work for paren
tal leave upon the birth of a child.
This would mark a "second stage"
in feminist thought, whereby dif
ferences between men and women
are recognized, but men retain
"equal rights" in familial issues.
This second stage also means
that "to embrace family values we
must transcend to new thinking
beyond false polarization of
feminism vs. the family." she said.
Friedan pointed out that the ideas
of feminism and equal rights are
incorrectly considered as contrary
to the ideas of family. Friedan
maintains that it is the family it
self that is changing, and because

of "new roles for men and women
in the family, we need new
priorities in legislation."
Friedan said the top legislative
priority is parental leave, which
she maintains is opposed by right
wing groups. Of developed na
tions, Friedan claims, "Only the

United States and South Africa
lack an official policy of parental
leave. They don't want to recog
nize the need for such a policy.
They would rather bury their
heads in the sand but they must
recognize and act on policies that
are needed. Under the Reagan ad

ministration, the machinery for
enforcing laws like these, such as
affirmative action, has been wiped
out."
Friedan called for men and
women to march on Mother's Day.
citing such a demonstration to be
held in Los Angeles for a proposed
parental leave bill pending in
Congress. "I've not seen a decent
child care bill since 1971, when a
bill proposed by Walter Mondale
was vetoed by President Nixon. To
preserve family values we must
move to get these institutional
changes. Unless we have some
leadership on local, state and
federal levels of government, the
change will not come," Friedan
said.
Friedan also emphasized the
need for society to go "beyond the
male model." She said Americans
should not think in terms of a
male society, but instead in terms
of a human society. Under such
terms, child care leave would not
be considered special treatment,
because childbirth is a human,
and not just female, fact of life.
"Women wouldn't need to hide
their pregnant bellies anymore to
protect their jobs." she said. "We
must treat pregnancy as a fact of
life. It shouldn't be necessary to
deny traditional female values,
but we must put these values
beyond the private sphere into the
public sphere."
