The number five seemed to enjoy the Stanford
wrestling team's company this weekend. The
Cardinal lost to Fullerton State by five seconds
Friday night at Maples Pavilion, and ended up
fifth in the California State Collegiate Champion
ships Saturday.
Stanford lost Its meet Friday against the Titans
23-18, but actually only lost the meet by a five
second margin. The Titans started out with a six
point lead when the Cardinal forfeited at 118.
However. Fullerton announced that it would be
forfeiting in the heavyweight division, so the
Cardinal would make up the six points at the end
of the meet.
Freshman Josh Lisle came away with an im
pressive 5-3 win in the 126-pound match over
Titan sophomore Chad Cunningham, bringing
the score to 6-3 in favor of Fullerton.
The Titans won at 134 and 142 pounds, and the
score became 16-3. Then came Scott Wiggen.
Wiggen (150 pounds), who recently broke the
Stanford career win record formerly held by Stan
ford Coach Chris Horpel, added another win to his
list of over 100 by beating Fullerton's Scott Guy.
The Titans then won at 158, where Ardeshir As
garl (ranked third in the nation) defeated Stan
ford's Steve Yarbrough.

In order for the Cardinal to have a chance at
winning the meet. It needed to win the rest of the
matches. Eric Harber (167) came through under
pressure, and beat Fullerton's Jim Kllnk 4-2. With
the team score at 20-9. It was now up to freshman
Ron Perry to keep Stanford's hopes alive.
Perry had an Incredibly close match against
Titan Jose Flores, a junior who placed fourth in
last year's PCAA championships. The score was 0-
0 In the first period, and remained tight in the
second. With five seconds left in the last period.
Perry made one wrong move which prevented him
from scoring. The final score of 6-5 in favor of
Flores ended Stanford's chances of winning.
Although Cardinal junior Terry Mclntyre (190)
won his match convincingly over Titan Mark Van
Eversen 3-1, the team points he contributed just
weren't enough. After the forfeit in the
heavyweight match, the final score was 23-18.
The Cardinal avenged its loss to Fullerton the
following night, however, by placing ahead of the
Titans in the California State Collegiate Cham
pionships held at San Fransisco State. Stanford
finished fifth out of a field of 12 teams.
Wiggen walked away with top honors for the
Cardinal by winning first place in the 142-pound
division.
