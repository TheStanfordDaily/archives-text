### NANNETTE THOMPSON 
The changing role of families in society
and the ramifications of these changes on
government, corporations and the commu
nity were topics discussed by a round tabic
of local and national leaders before a crowd
of more than 500 people at Memorial
Auditorium Saturday morning.
The panelists were part of the fourth an
nual You Can Make a Difference Conference
designed to explore the theme of "Families
in Transition." The speakers in the round
table were San Antonio Mayor Henry
Cisernos: Angela BJackwell, a public ad
vocacy attorney; magazine editor Kate
Greer; and author Michael Novak, a former

Stanford philosophy and religious studies
professor. The moderator was Los Angeles
news anchor Valerie Coleman.
Feminist Betty Friedan gave the keynote
address prior to the round table discussion.
In addition, the conference included a ques
tion and answer period for the speakers, an
introduction by Acting University President
James Rosse and opening remarks by State
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San
Jose).
Ten afternoon workshops provided an in
depth look at family-related issues ranging

Emphasizing the changes in family
structure over the last two decades, Greer,

managing editor of Better Homes and Gar
dens, said that at her magazine "we do not
ever use the phrase 'the family.' " She feels
that adding "the" makes the term too
restrictive, symbolizing a norm which is no
longer applicable to modern society.
Questions about the proper role of gov
ernment and corporations in family life
were debated by the panelists during the
round table discussion.
"Government is not doing its job." said
Blackwell of Public Advocates in San Fran
cisco. It is "currently putting more money
into building prisons than into anything
Hse in terms of new monies." She said that
government has a responsibility to use its
financial resources to encourage two

parent families, especially within poor and
minority communities.
Today more than 50 percent of black
families are headed by a female, and of
those families "an astonishing number are
living in poverty," Blackwell said.
"If government has one responsibility it is
to structure society and to build institu
tions and to provide regulations that assure
that citizens will be able to choose to live (in
two parent families)," said Blackwell.
Novak, chairperson of the Working Semi
nar on Family and American Welfare Policy,
had a reduced role of government
in mind.
