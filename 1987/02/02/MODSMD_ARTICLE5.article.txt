# Stanford invests with Perot in Jobs' latest venture
## 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Stanford last week invested *658,000 in Next Inc.,
a new business endeavor of former Apple Computer
chairman Steven Jobs.
Jobs, Texas billionaire and entrepreneur H. Ross
Perot, Carnegie Mellon University and the employees
of Next have joined to fund the development of a mi
crocomputer geared specifically to the needs of
higher education.
According to William Massy, University vice
president for business and finance, Jobs will be
cooperating with the two universities "to produce a
scholar's work station — a high-performance, low
cost microcomputer."
At a press conference last Friday. Jobs announced
the addition of Stanford and Carnegie Mellon to the
list of investors and indicated that the two schools

would be the last allowed to purchase shares in the
firm. Each university holds a one-half of one percent
stake in the corporation.
"Half of starting a company is getting people to
believe you. A young company has to have key people
willing to invest in your vision," he told The San Jose
Mercury-News.
The majority of the funding for Next will come from
Perot, who recently bought a 16 percent share for
*20 million, and Jobs, who increased his stake to 63
percent in the latest round of buying. All 50
employees of Next are stockholders and jointly own
20 percent of the company.
Describing the circumstances of Stanford's in
volvement with Next. Massy said "He (Jobs) called me
a week ago ... and told me that he was in the process
of closing a transaction with Perot and himself and
Carnegie Mellon. He said he'd like to have us in."
David Hopkins. University vice president for man

agement and financial planning, said that the deci
sion of Carnegie Mellon to invest had a "sizeable im
pact" on Stanford's move.
Hopkins praised the University's investment for
both its educational and financial merits. "It seems
like a good thing for Stanford because of the
programmatic aspects and a good financial invest
ment in a promising young company," he said.
Another branch of the University had an interest
in Jobs' project nine months before this Investment.
According to Michael Carter, director of University
Instruction and Research Information Systems
(IRIS), Stanford and Next have collaborated for
months to assess the needs for software in higher
education.
"We've been discussing with Next what our
workstation needs are since before Next was formed
as a company," said Carter. "We are certainly

cooperating with Next in helping them to develop the
right kind of machine for a place like Stanford," he
said.
Massy also outlined Stanford's goals for the pro
ject. "We hope to participate with him in utilizing the
computer with the insititution. He will use some
Stanford research and we will participate in software
development," he said.
Last week Jobs formed a board of directors with
himself, Perot and John Crecine, senior vice presi
dent for academic affairs at Carnegie Mellon. Jobs
planned to appoint Crecine to the Next board of
directors before Carnegie Mellon invested in the proj
ect, according to Massy. No member of the board of
directors is affiliated with Stanford.
Investing in young companies is a regular part of
the University's investment portfolio. "Stanford has
fairly significant venture capital projects," Hopkins
said.
