# Profs say Senate report hurts Reagan
## 
### A.J. THOMAS 
The Senate Intelligence Committee report on
the Iran-contra arms scandal has weakened
President Reagan's credibility and leaves many
crucial questions unanswered. Stanford pro
fessors said yesterday.
The report, released Thursday, describes
numerous occasions where Reagan Adminis
tration officials deceived one another.
Congress and the press about the sale of weap
ons to Iran and subsequent diversion of funds
to the contra rebels in Nicaragua.
"The report details many contradictions be
tween the record as developed by the commit
tee and the president's statements." said Poli
tical Science Prof. Richard Brody.
"Its principal impact, I suppose, would be to
put on hold any recovery of the president's
credibility with the public, which has been
pretty severely damaged thus far," he added.
According to History Prof. Barton Bernstein,
the report "doesn't address what Reagan knew
about the diversion of funds, but it does indi
cate that Reagan sought to deceive the Ameri
can public as to whether he was trading weap
ons for hostages."
Bernstein mentioned that part of the reason
so many Questions remain unanswered is that

President Reagan has been dragging his feet in
getting the story out. "I think Reagan has
decided to stonewall." he said, "but the bricks
are now tumbling down on him."
Political Science Prof. John Manley ex
pressed similar sentiments. "As long as the key
players — President Reagan. Vice Adm. Poin
dexter and Lt. Col. North — clam up. the report
leaves the crucial questions to be answered by
the select committees."
Now that the Senate Intelligence Committee
has completed its preliminary probe, the mat
ter will be turned over to special select commit
tees in each house of Congress for further in
vestigation.
"The next stage will be for the select commit
tees to get cranking up." Brody predicted.
"Most likely they will focus on the diversion of
funds."
While the Intelligence Committee found no
direct evidence that President Reagan knew of
the diversion of profits from the weapons sales
to the contras, faculty members here agreed
that administration policy in Central America
was probably a major motivating factor.
"It seems to me the whole affair is an out
growth of an activist foreign policy that is un
popular with the public, which made it neces
sary to go underground," observed emeritus

Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall.
According to Marshall, the covert nature of
arms sales to Iran meant the White House
could neither consult experts in the State De
partment or the CIA nor notify the Congress.
"Everything we know about government indi
cates we need to have some sort of adversarial
process going on to keep groups of people from
losing perspective."
Marshall went on to say that the president's
attitude toward Nicaragua provided tacit en
couragement for diversion of funds to the con
tras. "Getting rid of the Sandinista regime is
one of the two or three highest priorities of
Ronald Reagan."
Looking to the future. Marshall saw little
relief in sight for President Reagan. "I don't
think Reagan can go anywhere. Either he is a
liar or so incompetent that he didn't know
what his administration was doing. I don't
know which is worse."
Noting that "members of Congress have a
certain amount of pride, and this whole affair
has made them look like idiots," Marshall spec
ulated Congress will place tighter restrictions
on covert activity.
Brody, however, cautioned that it is very dlf-
