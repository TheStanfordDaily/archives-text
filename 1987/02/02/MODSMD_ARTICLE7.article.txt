# Dean Lyons: more than a beekeeper
## 
### FRANK QUARATIELLO 
Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons has an enormous
task to handle each day. His job
is to see that the non-academic
needs of each student here at
Stanford are fulfilled.
Dean Lyons is the chief ad
ministrator of a number of stu
dent services such as Tresidder
Union, the Career Planning
and Placement Center, student
residences and student medical
and psychological services. He
also supervises Oorientation,
oversees the Residential Educa
tion program and advises many
campus organizations.
Lyons says he tries to "make
sure that the services are pro
vided well . . . and that (the or
ganizations) are accountable to

the University." The various
groups must "go beyond just
providing services so we use
them as both means (and)
ends."
For example, Cowell Student
Health Center should do more
than offer treatment for our in
juries and illnesses, according
to Lyons. It should create an
environment where students
can learn more about their
health and how to preserve it.
he said.
An Important part of Lyons'
job is to make sure that all the
services suit the needs of stu
dents as best they can.
Lyons has an executive com
mittee to help him decide policy
issues, but the day-to-day
operations of many student
services are handled at a lower
level.
"You want to have everything at
the lowest possible level rather
than a big hierarchy and a distant
bureaucracy," he said. To help
foster this idea, "most of the
people who work in Student Af
fairs are students," he added.
It is appropriate for students to
take an active role in the adminis
tration of the University since "the
notion of self-governance around
here is pretty powerful," according
to Lyons.
Some of the new major projects
that Dean Lyons is working on in
clude new student housing, im
proved medical service and a new
student health insurance plan.
Lyons also shares in the man
agement of the University as a
whole. He serves on the Presi
dent's staff and the Administra
tive Council, where he helps to
decide major University policy is
sues and serves as a spokesman
for student interests.
There are several important
values that Dean Lyons tries to
preserve when he does his job. He
recognizes the uniqueness of each
student and the University's "need
to respond to the individual as a
whole person." He makes sure
that his student service centers
"do things on an individual scale
... and respond to each individ
ual's needs."
Lyons does everything he can to
integrate Stanford as a commu
nity, because "if this is a friendly,

supportive community that cares
and teaches people to care about
each other, it will be a better Uni
versity."
By taking care of individual stu
dent's needs and building a sup
portive community, Lyons hopes
to help students take responsibil
ity for their own education and
make the most of their Stanford
experience.
Away from the office, Lyons has
several hobbies. He has been a
beekeeper for about 12 years. He
collects honey, makes wax candles
and enjoys reading literature on
bees and bee-keeping. When he
isn't tending bees, Lyons enjoys
cycling. He usually cycles to work
and sometimes rides 30 to 40

miles on weekends. The Dean and
his family also go camping often.
Lyons has been Dean of Student
Affairs here at Stanford since
1972. Originally from Jamestown,
N.Y., he went to Allegheny College
in Pennsylvania, and then Indiana
University where he earned his
master's and doctorate degrees in
higher education and counseling.
While at Indiana University, he
served as Assistant Dean of Stu
dents and as the equivalent of a
resident fellow. In 1962, he
became Dean of Students at a
small, selective college near
Philadelphia called Haverford Col
lege. He worked there for ten years
before coming here to Stanford.
