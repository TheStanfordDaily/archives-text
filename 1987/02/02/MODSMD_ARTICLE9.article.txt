Israel refuses to release prisoners
TEL AVIV, Israel — Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday
rejected as unthinkable a terrorist group's demand of the release
of 400 prisoners in exchange for three Americans and an Indian
held hostage in Lebanon.
Rabin said on a live call-in show on Israel Army radio that the
Jewish state would not act as an "international bank" for terror
ists.
He said no request had come from the United States or any
other government to free prisoners. He and other officials said Is
rael would make no deals. Rabin said Israel had to consider first
some of its own people held hostage.
The defense minister said of the Lebanese group's demand, "It
is simply not possible to think we would agree to it. We would be
hard put to see Israel ... as the international bank from which all
countries that have hostages in the hands of this or that terror
group (would draw)."
On Saturday, a handwritten statement delivered in Beirut in
the name of Islamic Jihad Organization for the Liberation of
Palestine threatened to kill four Beirut University College teachers
kidnapped Jan. 24 if the prisoners were not freed in a week's time.
Filipinos vote on new constitution
MANILA, Philippines — Filipinos cast ballots today to approve or
disapprove a new constitution. The voting was seen as a crucial
test of strength for President Corazon Aquino's 11-month-old ad
ministration.
Small explosions occurred within a 20-minute period at three
locations in Manila the night before the plebiscite, but no one was
injured, private radio station DZRH said.
The explosions, apparantly from homemade bombs, were at the
San Roque Roman Catholic Church, a bookstore and in a vacant
lot about 200 yards from the DZRH studios, according to the
broadcast. Police said they had no suspects.
Also last night, Manila police arrested two men and seized 120
sticks of dynamite after learning of a plot to disrupt the voting.
The military put 79 battalions on alert to prevent trouble during
the nationwide voting, which came days after the government put
down a military coup attempt by supporters of former President
Ferdinand Marcos.
Nationwide results are not expected for days, but the private Na
tional Movement for Free Elections said it expected definitive
results from the Manila area by midnight.
Taiwan tourist hotel fire kills 18
TAIPEI, Taiwan — Fire swept through a hotel filled with
Taiwanese celebrating the Chinese New Year yesterday, killing 18
people and injuring 13, authorities said. Twenty people jumped
into safety nets to escape.
Most victims in the southern Taiwanese hotel died of smoke in
halation, apparently unable to escape because of blocked exits, ac
cording to officials.
No foreigners were among the dead, firefighter Lin Yi-chao said
in a telephone interview from Kaohsiung, site of the fire. Kaoh
siung is 204 miles south of Taipei.
Fire officials said emergency exits were locked and blocked by
mattresses and by hotel supplies piled in front of them.
They said police were investigating and would decide if safety
regulations were violated at the 20-year-old Tung Pao Hotel.
Lin said the fire began around 1 a.m., apparently on the third
floor of the four-story, 27-room hotel. He said burning plastic
decorations filled rooms with heavy smoke, and that most of the
victims apparently were asphyxiated. He said most victims were
found on the upper two floors.
Taiwan's worst hotel fire occurred in April 1985, when 26
people were killed in Tainan in southern Taiwan.
President faces override of veto
WASHINGTON — President Reagan faces a major spending
defeat this week if Congress, as expected, overrides his second
veto in three months of popular $20 billion clean-water legisla
tion.
Nobody, least of all the president, will be surprised by the pend
ing House and Senate votes over an aid-to-the-states issue that
Reagan says is the "first great battle of the (budget) deficit in the
100 th Congress."
"I know this veto is going to be overridden," he said Friday at a
ceremony that contrasted markedly with the quiet pocket-veto he
used last Nov. 6 to scuttle an identical bill after Congress had left
town and was unable to take override votes.
There is one element of suspense this week on Capitol Hill: Will
the House follow the lead of the Senate and reject a proposal to add
$ 12,100 to the annual $77,400 congressional salary?
Unless the House rejects them by midnight Tuesday, the raises,
recommended by Reagan, are automatic for lawmakers, federal
judges, the Cabinet and top-level bureaucrats. The House won't
start hearings on the issue until Monday, and the question isn't
yet on the floor debate agenda.
The first clean-water override vote is set for tomorrow in the
House, which got the 1987 session off to a quick start Jan. 8 by
approving the legislation 406-6, a margin far beyond the two
thirds needed to override the veto.
Conflicting testimony in Iran affair
WASHINGTON — In assessing White House Involvement in se
cret arms sales to Iran, the Senate Intelligence Committee was
unable to resolve conflicts in testimony between former national
security adviser Robert McFarlane and others in President
Reagan's inner circle.
The best known conflict involves testimony by McFarlane and
White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan on whether the presi
dent gave "oral" approval, in advance, for Israeli shipments of U.S.
arms to Iran.
McFarlane has said Reagan did give the project his verbal bless
ing. But the chief of staff has testified the president did not.
The committee said McFarlane. testifying in private, said the
arms transfer was supported by Regan and by Vice President
George Bush and CIA Director William Casey.
McFarlane said it was opposed by Secretary of State George
Shultz. who had earlier called the idea "perverse." and by Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who had dismissed it as
"absurd."
"Although there is no written record of a decision at this time,
McFarlane testified that the president informed Shultz,
Weinberger and Casey of his decision," the committee said.
Negotiators seek Waiters release
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Intensive "hush-hush" negotiations in
volving Syria. Iran and Lebanese militia leaders have started to de
termine the fate of missing hostage negotiator Terry Waite and to
ensure his safety, a senior militia official said yesterday.
"These hush-hush talks are in high gear." said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "The parties concerned are
burning up the (telephone] wires trying to ensure Mr. Waite's
safety. Plenty of Syrian and Iranian emissaries are shuttling back
and forth."
Walte, personal emissary of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie. flew to Beirut Jan. 12 on his fifth trip to Lebanon to win
freedom for foreign hostages.
