# Scientists support particle smasher

### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Stanford scientists working on
a proposal for a multibillion-dollar
particle accelerator — to be lo
cated somewhere in the United
States — see President Reagan's
decision last week to support the
project as only the first step
toward its completion.
"We're obviously very happy"
about the administration's sup
port for the Superconducting
Super Collider (SSC), said Physics
Prof. Stanley Wojcicki. Wojcicki,
currently on leave at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory, is deputy di
rector of the SSC Design Group, a
panel of scientists commissioned
by the Department of Energy to
draw up a proposal for the ac
celerator.
"We see (Reagan's) decision as
the culmination of the first phase
of our work — three-and-a-half
years of research, development
and design." Wojcicki said.
Guided by 10.000 powerful
magnets, the accelerator would
launch beams of high-energy
protons around an underground
track in opposite directions. Any
debris from the protons' collisions
could give scientists new clues
about the construction and be
havior of matter on both an
atomic and galactic scale.
The SSC Design Group's pro
posal seeks >4.4 billion to con
struct the accelerator and sets
1996 as the target date for comple
tion. The proposed accelerator
would be ring-shaped and 52
miles in circumference, and would
represent a 60-fold increase in the
current energy capabilities for
proton acceleration.
Other Stanford scientists who
have worked closely with the sci
entific community on the ac

celerator include Profs. Burton
Richter, Alex Chao and Richard
Taylor of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center. Geology Prof.
Emeritus Benjamin Page and
John Tompkins and Mike McAs
han, associates of the Stanford
High Energy Physics Laboratory.
"We're certainly aware that it's
not over," Wojcicki said of the SSC
Design Group's efforts to win gov
ernment funding for the ac
celerator. "Congress and the
American people play a big role."
According to Chao, the nation's
scientific community will be lob
bying through "all possible chan
nels." in order to get "Congress up
for" approving funding.
"At last count we had 90 Con
gressmen putting their names on
the proposal," Chao said, adding
that the number is "growing."
Chao attributed much of the Con
gressional support to the presi
dent's public endorsement of the
accelerator last Friday.
Chao said the accelerator's con
ceptual design has been critically
acclaimed by the Energy Depart
ment, the president and the scien
tific community. "The belief here
is optimistic. The whole physics
community is behind it,"he said.

"Physicists all over the country
are hoping for the realization of
the machine," Page said, adding
that. "The machine must be built
somewhere in the United States to
keep the momentum of our re
search" from shifting to Europe.
One of the next steps, according
to Chao. head of the SSC Design
Group's division for accelerator
physics, is to select the ac
celerator's site. According to
Chao. about 20 states are propos
ing close to 40 possible locations.
The SSC Design Group supplys
the technical input about each
site to the U.S. Department of En
ergy so it can choose the final loca
tion for the accelerator, according
to Chao.
Page, a member of California's
site selection committee, said that
if the accelerator were to be lo
cated in California it would be in
the Central Valley.
Chao added that he believes
other states may offer better sites
than California because of Califor
nia's ground water and
earthquake concerns. The SSC
Design Group hopes to have a site
selected in "certainly less than two
years." Chao cautioned, however,
that the process may take longer.
