Jihad threatens to kill hostages
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian group that
holds at least two American hostages, threatened yesterday to kill
them and attack American targets with "no mercy whatsoever" if
the United States attempts a military strike against Moslems in
the region.
Islamic Jihad's statement, delivered here, was accompanied by
a photograph of American kidnap victim Terry Anderson, the
Middle East bureau chief of The Associated Press, who was seized
by gunmen on March 16, 1985.
"Any blow directed against Moslems and strugglers will be met
with a very harsh response in which we shall have no mercy what
soever," Islamic Jihad warned. "Any attempted military operation
against Moslems in the region, particularly in Lebanon, will spell
the extinction of the hostages and American interests in the
area."
Pentagon officials said two U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups
and a Marine assault force are now in the eastern Mediterranean.
But Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims said: "All we've done is
precautionary in nature and should not be read as a threat to
anyone who is conducting themselves in a civilized way," United
Press International reported. Sims refused to comment about the
Islamic Jihad threat.
Shamir refuses to swap hostages
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refused yester
day to consider releasing Arab prisoners held by Israel in ex
change for American hostages in Lebanon, as demanded by a ter
rorist group in Beirut.
"I don't think we can even consider this." Shamir told reporters
when asked to respond to the demand by an underground group
calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
The group threatened Saturday to kill four hostages, three
Americans and an Indian-born U.S. resident, unless Israel agrees
within a week to free 400 Arab prisoners.
Earlier, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin had also dismissed the
proposal, saying, "It's hard for me to see Israel becoming an inter
national prisoner bank, so that any terrorist organization which
so desires could tomorrow kidnap Americans or Germans, while
the quid pro quo is those who are captured as terrorists and are
imprisoned in Israel."
However, a senior Israeli political figure cautioned that
Shamir's and Rabin's statements should not necessarily be taken
to mean that the idea of a prisoners-for-hostages swap is out of
the question.
Reagan to turn over Iran notes
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in a swift reversal of subor
dinates, decided yesterday to share with congressional investigat
ing committees "relevant excerpts" of his notes about the decision
to sell arms to Iran, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater an
nounced.
White House officials said they had not decided how to choose
the excerpts and would not do so until after an expected request
for the material from congressional panels investigating the Iran
contra scandal. Officials said it was not clear whether some or all
of the notes would be made available if Congress asks for them or
whether a third party would screen the material first.
White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan had earlier told the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that Reagan's notes were
private, and other White House officials said over the weekend
that the president would resist requests from Congress for the
material.
However, the president decided at a morning meeting to offer to
share the material. "I'd be glad to," one senior official quoted
Reagan as saying.
The Senate select committee looking into the controversy has
not decided whether to ask Reagan to turn over the notes, which
some panel members say might shed light on his knowledge of the
complicated arms-and-money dealings. The existence of the ma
terial was acknowledged by the White House over the weekend.
In divulging Reagan's offer to make some personal papers
available, Fitzwater said the gesture was "consistent with . . . his
commitment to cooperate fully. The president wants to get to the
bottom of the matter and fix what went wrong."
Pentagon to request new plan
WASHINGTON — The Defense Department plans to ask Presi
dent Reagan today to authorize a plan to develop an initial, "near
term" defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles, accord
ing to senior officials at the Pentagon and the State Department.
The Pentagon also intends to ask Reagan to authorize plans for
experiments in space, which are considered by the Soviet Union
and many U.S. experts to violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
Treaty.
The requests, expected from Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger at a National Security Planning Group meeting
chaired by Reagan, are likely to be vigorously opposed by Secretary
of State George Shultz, knowledgeable officials said yesterday.
Consequently, no immediate decision by Reagan is probable, the
officials added.
The Pentagon requests follow weeks of public and private dis
cussion by Weinberger and his aides about the need io proceed "as
soon as possible" with development and deployment of a partial
missile defense, to be created under the president's controversial
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). or "Star Wars," program.
A senior Pentagon official said one of Weinberger's goals today is
to persuade the president "to move ahead" in the Star Wars pro
gram before he completes his term of office in 1989, as well as to
abandon the so-called "narrow" interpretation of the ABM Treaty
which would hamper any near-term missile defense deployment.
High infant death rate persists
WASHINGTON — Infant mortality rates in the United States are
among the highest in the industrialized world, and there is a wide
variation in the way different states and cities have tried to reduce
the toll, according to a new survey by a child advocacy group.
Among the main findings of the report, "The Health of
America's Children." by the Children's Defense Fund:
□ The United States is tied for last place with Belgium and the
two Germanys for having the highest infant mortality rate among
20 industrialized nations. Thirty years ago, the United States
ranked sixth, ahead of such countries as France. Finland and
Japan, all of which have surpassed the United States in that time.
□ The death rate for black infants in the United States is nearly
double that of whites.
□ Washington. D.C. has one of the highest infant mortality rates
of any American city or state.
In 1980. the U.S. surgeon general set a national goal to reduce
infant mortality rates of minorities and low-income women bv al
most half by the end of the decade. But progress over the last five
years has slowed. Both the Children's Defense Fund and the sur
geon general's office in its report. "A Midcourse Review," released
late last year, conclude that the nation will not meet Its goal of re
ducing deaths of black infants by 1990 — and at current rates,
mavbe not until well into the 21st centurv.

Jihad threatens to kill hostages
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian group that
holds at least two American hostages, threatened yesterday to kill
them and attack American targets with "no mercy whatsoever" if
the United States attempts a military strike against Moslems in
the region.
Islamic Jihad's statement, delivered here, was accompanied by
a photograph of American kidnap victim Terry Anderson, the
Middle East bureau chief of The Associated Press, who was seized
by gunmen on March 16, 1985.
"Any blow directed against Moslems and strugglers will be met
with a very harsh response in which we shall have no mercy what
soever," Islamic Jihad warned. "Any attempted military operation
against Moslems in the region, particularly in Lebanon, will spell
the extinction of the hostages and American interests in the
area."
Pentagon officials said two U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups
and a Marine assault force are now in the eastern Mediterranean.
But Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims said: "All we've done is
precautionary in nature and should not be read as a threat to
anyone who is conducting themselves in a civilized way," United
Press International reported. Sims refused to comment about the
Islamic Jihad threat.
Shamir refuses to swap hostages
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refused yester
day to consider releasing Arab prisoners held by Israel in ex
change for American hostages in Lebanon, as demanded by a ter
rorist group in Beirut.
"I don't think we can even consider this." Shamir told reporters
when asked to respond to the demand by an underground group
calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
The group threatened Saturday to kill four hostages, three
Americans and an Indian-born U.S. resident, unless Israel agrees
within a week to free 400 Arab prisoners.
Earlier, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin had also dismissed the
proposal, saying, "It's hard for me to see Israel becoming an inter
national prisoner bank, so that any terrorist organization which
so desires could tomorrow kidnap Americans or Germans, while
the quid pro quo is those who are captured as terrorists and are
imprisoned in Israel."
However, a senior Israeli political figure cautioned that
Shamir's and Rabin's statements should not necessarily be taken
to mean that the idea of a prisoners-for-hostages swap is out of
the question.
Reagan to turn over Iran notes
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in a swift reversal of subor
dinates, decided yesterday to share with congressional investigat
ing committees "relevant excerpts" of his notes about the decision
to sell arms to Iran, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater an
nounced.
White House officials said they had not decided how to choose
the excerpts and would not do so until after an expected request
for the material from congressional panels investigating the Iran
contra scandal. Officials said it was not clear whether some or all
of the notes would be made available if Congress asks for them or
whether a third party would screen the material first.
White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan had earlier told the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that Reagan's notes were
private, and other White House officials said over the weekend
that the president would resist requests from Congress for the
material.
However, the president decided at a morning meeting to offer to
share the material. "I'd be glad to," one senior official quoted
Reagan as saying.
The Senate select committee looking into the controversy has
not decided whether to ask Reagan to turn over the notes, which
some panel members say might shed light on his knowledge of the
complicated arms-and-money dealings. The existence of the ma
terial was acknowledged by the White House over the weekend.
In divulging Reagan's offer to make some personal papers
available, Fitzwater said the gesture was "consistent with . . . his
commitment to cooperate fully. The president wants to get to the
bottom of the matter and fix what went wrong."
Pentagon to request new plan
WASHINGTON — The Defense Department plans to ask Presi
dent Reagan today to authorize a plan to develop an initial, "near
term" defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles, accord
ing to senior officials at the Pentagon and the State Department.
The Pentagon also intends to ask Reagan to authorize plans for
experiments in space, which are considered by the Soviet Union
and many U.S. experts to violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
Treaty.
The requests, expected from Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger at a National Security Planning Group meeting
chaired by Reagan, are likely to be vigorously opposed by Secretary
of State George Shultz, knowledgeable officials said yesterday.
Consequently, no immediate decision by Reagan is probable, the
officials added.
The Pentagon requests follow weeks of public and private dis
cussion by Weinberger and his aides about the need io proceed "as
soon as possible" with development and deployment of a partial
missile defense, to be created under the president's controversial
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). or "Star Wars," program.
A senior Pentagon official said one of Weinberger's goals today is
to persuade the president "to move ahead" in the Star Wars pro
gram before he completes his term of office in 1989, as well as to
abandon the so-called "narrow" interpretation of the ABM Treaty
which would hamper any near-term missile defense deployment.
High infant death rate persists
WASHINGTON — Infant mortality rates in the United States are
among the highest in the industrialized world, and there is a wide
variation in the way different states and cities have tried to reduce
the toll, according to a new survey by a child advocacy group.
Among the main findings of the report, "The Health of
America's Children." by the Children's Defense Fund:
□ The United States is tied for last place with Belgium and the
two Germanys for having the highest infant mortality rate among
20 industrialized nations. Thirty years ago, the United States
ranked sixth, ahead of such countries as France. Finland and
Japan, all of which have surpassed the United States in that time.
□ The death rate for black infants in the United States is nearly
double that of whites.
□ Washington. D.C. has one of the highest infant mortality rates
of any American city or state.
In 1980. the U.S. surgeon general set a national goal to reduce
infant mortality rates of minorities and low-income women bv al
most half by the end of the decade. But progress over the last five
years has slowed. Both the Children's Defense Fund and the sur
geon general's office in its report. "A Midcourse Review," released
late last year, conclude that the nation will not meet Its goal of re
ducing deaths of black infants by 1990 — and at current rates,
mavbe not until well into the 21st centurv.
