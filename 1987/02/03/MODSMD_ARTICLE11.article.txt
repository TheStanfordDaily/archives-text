# Casey resigns as head of CIA
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Hospitalized
CIA Director William Casey, a con
fidant and former campaign
manager for President Reagan,
has resigned and will be replaced
by CIA Deputy Director Robert
Gates, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater announced yes
terday.
Fitzwater said the 73-year-old
Casey, who had a cancerous
tumor removed from his brain
Dec. 18, resigned last Thursday
during a visit from White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan and
Attorney General Edwin Meese.
"It was Mr. Casey's decision to
resign," Fitzwater said. "He saw
that it would be some time before
he would be able to return to duty
and undertake full activities at the
CIA. He realized the need for on
the-job leadership in the intelli
gence community."
Casey's departure comes during
a time of crisis and turnover in the
Reagan adminstration, which is

struggling to regain the political
initiative in the wake of the Iran
arms-contra affair. A senior offi
cial said that the loss of Casey is
"particularly wrenching" for the
president, who said in a letter to
Casey yesterday that he was ac
cepting the resignation with
"profound regret."
Casey's letter of resignation,
reflecting his slow recovery, con
sisted of two sentences, in which
he said it was a "great honor" to
have served Reagan.
Also yesterday. White House and
Pentagon sources said that Asst.
Secretary of Defense Richard
Perle, one of the most influential
policymakers in the administra
tion and a critic of past arms con
trol agreements with the Soviet
Union, has told Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger he intends to
quit soon.
Casey, after managing Reagan's
1980 presidential campaign, was
rewarded with the post he asked

for — director of central intelli
gence. He generally sided with
other administration con
servatives and came under heavy
political criticism in 1984 for the
CIA role in mining Nicaraguan
harbors. But Reagan defended
Casey against all critics, within
the administration and outside of
it.
The president tried to cushion
Casey's resignation, saying in the
letter to him that he wanted him
to serve as counselor to the presi
dent, a post previously held by
Meese, "whenever you feel your
recovery is sufficient to assume
those responsibilities."
White House officials have been
seeking a replacement for Casey
for weeks, even while publicly
avowing that no search was under
way. A senior official said the pres
ident had insisted that the effort
to find a replacement be dis
avowed "because he didn't want

the search to have an adverse
medical effect" on the CIA direc
tor's recovery.
Nonetheless, it was disclosed
two weeks ago that Regan had
sounded out former Senate
majority leader Howard Baker, R-
Tenn., for the job. An informed
source said yesterday that Meese
also made an overture to FBI Di
rector William Webster, who said
he wasn't seeking the CIA post.
White House officials said that a
consensus then rapidly developed
for Gates, 43, partly because he is
already serving as acting director
and also because he enjoys close
relations with key members of
Congress, including Senate intel
ligence committee Chairman
David Boren, D-Okla., who issued
a statement praising the nomina
tion. Fitzwater said Reagan talked
with Gates late Friday morning
and offered him the job.
