# High voter turnout in favor of Aquino
## 
### 
MANILA, Philippines — President Corazon
Aquino appeared to be heading for a solid vic
tory yesterday after a trouble-free day when
Filipinos flocked to vote in apparent record
numbers on a new constitution.
Aquino said after polls closed that the or
derly conduct of the plebiscite would usher in
political stability, but she refrained from
proclaiming victory.
With the unexpectedly high turnout and
with none of the disruption feared by the mili
tary and Aquino's supporters, she appeared to
be on the verge of the most significant victory
in her nearly 1-year-old presidency.
Observers said the turnout was a sign that
the constitution on which her future
presidency is based would get wide support.
An official result will not be announced until
Feb. 9, but a clear trend in counts from the 75
provinces is expected after three days.

Electoral Commission Chairman Felipe
Ramos estimated a turnout above 80 percent
from among the 25 million registered voters.
Attempts to disrupt voting were reported
from at least four provinces, but presidential
press secretary Teodoro Benigno said those
were "mere pin-pricks." He said that an 80 per
cent turnout would be the highest in
Philippine history.
"It was certainly heartening," Aquino said in
a statement. "My hope is that until the final
results are in, this admirable demonstration of
democracy in action will not only continue but
usher in the political stability that we all
desire."
The vote was Aquino's biggest political chal
lenge since Ferdinand Marcos was toppled in a
popular revolt last February. A military action
described by Aquino as Marcos loyalist led,
failed in a bid to oust her only last week.

The armed forces were in a state of alert yes
terday and a total of 79 battalions was
deployed to avert trouble. In Manila, three
bombs had exploded In the central business
district shortly before midnight Sunday and
police later seized 960 sticks of dynamite and
arrested two persons.
Lines at polling booths were so long that
some booths ran out of voting forms. At
others, voting hours were extended so that
those in line could cast their ballots. Voting is
compulsory and non-voters face a fine of 100
pesos (about *5).
Voters were asked to cast a "yes" or a "no"
vote and leave three signatures and three fin
gerprints. Votes were locked in metal boxes
and, after casting ballots, all voters had the
nail on their right forefinger marked with red
ink.
