# Med Center finds use for leeches

More than 100 years after doctors stopped
using blood-sucking leeches to treat their
patients, surgeons at the Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center and elsewhere are again
using leeches for medicinal purposes.
During the past year, Stanford doctors
have used leeches four times to facilitate the
process of reattaching amputated limbs. Dr.
Vince Hentz of the Medical School told the
University News Service.
Leeches are to help reattach small ap
pendages, like fingers, ears and noses. They
are also used in skin grafting, he said.
Although European surgeons have been
using leeches in this way for several years.

the process has come to the United States
only recently. Ron Goben, assoc. director of
the Medical School, expects Stanford hospi
tal to use the process frequently.
Goben said that when small appendages or
pieces of skin are separated from the body,
doctors can reattach arteries, but veins are
too small to reattach. Four or five days after
surgery, veins will grow back together on
their own. but until then, blood that flows
into the appendage through the arteries can
not flow back out again. Instead, it collects in
the finger or ear and prevents fresh blood
from flowing in.
When leeches are attached to the ap
pendage after surgery, they suck out blood
that has flowed in through the repaired ar
teries. making it possible for fresh blood to

flow in, Goben explained.
This practice is superior to the more com
monly used method of making a fresh wound
in the appendage to drain the blood, accord
ing to Goben. For one thing, it is much less
messy, he said. More importantly, the
leeches transmit to the patient a natural an
ticoagulant, which makes it even easier for
the blood to flow into the appendage.
Without the leeches, doctors oiten
prescribe an anticoagulant which is taken
orally â€” thus reducing the entire body's abil
ity to clot blood, Goben said.
According to Goben, patients do not seem
to mind the leech treatment. The treatment
itself does not cause pain, although there is.
of course, pain associated with amputation,
reattachment and skin grafting, he said.
