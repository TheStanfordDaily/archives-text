## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Guys and Dollies 
### 
It is time again to start the process of
choosing next year's Dollies. Most people
who have watched the Dollies over the years
would agree that they do a good job. Their
performances are always an enjoyable and
exciting part of games and they are an inte
gral part of the Stanford Band tradition.
But traditions need to be re-examined
from time to time so that they do not become
anathema to the more modern values that we
now embrace. The Dollies are a visible and
popular group. It is unfair to men that this
group be exclusively female. Most other
respected universities have long ago either
eliminated cheerleading squads or integra
ted them so that they are coed and everyone
can enjoy the fun.
Stanford has long shown itself willing to
discard outdated stereotypes. For example,
for years the Indian was the Stanford mascot
on the football field but in the '70s students
re-evaluated this tradition and decided that
the Indian was a negative and derogatory
stereotype and changed the mascot to the
tree. While some alumni would bring back
the Indian, most of us today would disagree.
We enjoy the tree as much as the Indian and
have avoided having a racist image attached
to our University.

No one would advocate eliminating all
forms of cheerleading or dancing on the field
here at Stanford; having wild and unconven
tional fun is too much a part of our tradition.
However, at least one male tried out to be a
Dollie last year and perhaps many more
would be interested in doing so if presented
the opportunity.
There are at least two options for making
the cheerleading here at Stanford more egali
tarian and less sexist. The first possibility
would be for the Band to audition and choose
an all-male squad of dancers that would be
given equal time with the Dollies to perform
at events.
The Dollies aren't ordinary cheerleaders —
they are talented and dedicated dancers as
well. Their style is such that it might be diffi
cult t£ integrate men into the Dollies as the
group* functions now. The other possibility,
therefore, would be for the Dollies to work
toward including men in their routines. This
would probably require a small change in
dancing style as well as a change of name.
If it seems inconceivable that there could
be male Dollies, remember that it was once
inconceivable that there would be female
doctors. Tradition shouldn't stand in the
way of positive change. There should be
equal opportunity for all.
