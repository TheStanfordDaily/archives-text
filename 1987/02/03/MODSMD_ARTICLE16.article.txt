# How much for the fries?
## 
### 
"Can I have your meal card?"
I dug Into my pocket. It was
empty. I'd left my meal card in my
room.
"Uh, can I pay with cash?"
"Sure!" The girl smiled at me as
though she knew something I
didn't. She cleared the display and
began punching keys frantically.
Numbers blinked across the
screen too fast for me to read.
"Let's see. That's seven dollars and
five cents."
I swallowed hard and looked at
my dinner. The bacon
cheeseburger, fries, Coke and two
candy bars looked lonely on the
big tray.
"That cost me seven bucks?"
"Seven-o-five," she corrected.
I signed and took out my wallet.
Maybe some of you have had the
same experience. This happened
to me at Sterling Quad Dining Hall
last quarter.

Every day, those of us
"fortunate" enough to have a Uni
versity meal plan pull out a little
plastic card, hand it to a checker
and eat. Cash rarely changes
hands. At the beginning of every
quarter when we write out many
checks, who bothers to calculate
how much we pay per meal for
food service? The seven-hundred
and-some-odd dollars pales in
comparison to the hefty tuition
bill, and is slightly smaller than
even the room bill.
The truth is, we pay premium
prices without realizing it for
what many of us consider not-so
premium food. According to the
Lagunita Dining Hall Manager,
this is about what you pay per
meal if you live in Lag, Wilbur,
Roble, Stern, etc.: *3.25 for break
fast, *4.30 for lunch and for din
ner. a whopping *7.65.
Ah, well, you might be thinking,
if 1 had to eat at a restaurant every
meal I'd pay those prices anyway.
So maybe I could be eating at
McDonald's for lunch and Sizzler
for dinner. At least it's convenient.
It could be worse.
That's where you'd be wrong. It
Is worse. You see. Food Service
also counts on you missing a cer
tain number of meals each week.
Did you ever not feel hungry some
night? Go away for the weekend?
Miss brunch because of heavy Sat
urday night partying? Skip break
fast because you were late for
class? Well, those meals were
already figured into the prices you
paid at the beginning of the quar
ter.
Let's say you miss about two
meals a week, or even that you eat
every meal, but don't eat as much
as the average person. In a 10-
week quarter, that's around
twenty meals you've missed. You'd
now be paying about •3.77 for
breakfast. *6.15 for lunch and
• 8.87 for dinner. Change
McDonald's to Chili's and Sizzler
to the Prime Rib Inn.
But what about Sterling Quad,
where the University is trying out
the point system? Isn't it true that
there you pay only for the items

that you want? Sure it is. Every
serving of beans, can of Diet Coke
and ice cream sandwich costs you
a certain number of points, which
you buy at the beginning of the
quarter. But even there it's easy to
lose track of how much you're ac
tually spending. You see, the Uni
versity is very crafty about this
form of accounting. The points
you pay are roughly one-third of
the actual price of the item. A
canned soft drink, then, costs 35
points, but *1.05 in cash.
One dollar and Jive cents! My
meal above would have cost me
235 points, which as I found out
the hard way, is actually >7.05.
It's easy to start thinking of points
as dollars, as I did. Only when
you're forced to pay seven bucks
for a meal that would cost you at
most four at McDonald's or at
Tresidder do you realize how
much you're actually paying.
Oh, one other thing about Ster
ling Quad. If you have points left
over at the end of the quarter, you
can buy things like cases of your
favorite candy bar, yogurt or soft
drink. But it'll cost you. Twenty
four bucks for a case of Coke. Just
to give you an idea of how much
that is: If you had the quarters
and the desire you could get a case
for 14 bucks and some change out
of the nearest soda machine. It
would be about eight bucks at
Safeway. What an innovative sys
tem!
The quality of Food Service also
leaves something to be desired.
Bagels are stale. Main dishes run
out well before Food Service is
scheduled to close. Occasionally,
your choice is limited to food you
don't like or last Thursday's dry
leftovers, far less selective than
you'd get at a restaurant. Even at
a place like McDonald's, policy
states that its employees must
throw out fries after seven
minutes. For Food Service the
policy seems to be more like seven
days.
I think you're starting to see
what I'm getting at. My point is
simple: University Food Service
charges restaurant prices without
providing restaurant-quality food.
The next question is, why? Are we
being ripped off?
To answer this question you
have to look at Food Service itself.
It's University-run. It's not out to
make a profit (though I may have
something to say about that in fu
ture columns — I've been
promised a peek at the books).
Some people, namely University
and Food Service managers, tell
me that the enormous costs that
Food Service is forced to pay are
responsible for their pricing. Basi
cally. their claim is that the price
you pay for your food is more or
less the cost to them.
Admittedly, those costs are con
siderable. Food Service's full-time
workers — this means everyone
from the cook who flips the
burgers to the managers them
selves — are University employees.
They're paid salaries that are
higher than those you'd find in
even Palo Alto's high-priced res
taurants. They also collect
benefits like sick leave, disability
insurance, paid vacations, paid
personal days and all those other
good things that go along with
working for a behemoth like Stan
ford U. Denny's, on the other
hand, pays most of its employees

just a scratch above minimum
wage. You might want to think a
little before your march in the
next United Stanford Workers
rally.
Then there are also the count
less students Food Service
employs. Starting pay for them is
*4.40 an hour due to the Univer
sity's minimum wage. You might
want to think of Food Service as
another way of redistributing the
wealth. Take some money away
from the students who can afford
not to work and give it to those
who must.

To the people who insist on
defending Food Service with those
arguments, I pose two questions.
The first is, how come Saga can
provide similar service at lower
prices? A burger at Tresidder with
bacon and cheese runs a little over
two dollars. Fries will set you back
another 70 cents or so. Add 60
cents to that for a 12-ounce Coke
and 80 cents for two candy bars.
The total is a little over four dol
lars. The catch is, Saga has to pay
the same high costs that Food Ser
vice has to pay. According to the
people I spoke with there, their
employees get similar salaries and
benefits, and the students they
hire are paid roughly the same
wages. So much for Food Service's
enormous costs.
The second question I'd like to
ask those few of you who'd leap to
the defense of Food Service: How
come Harvard and Yale food
services don't charge as much?
The manager of Harvard's food
service informed me when 1
phoned her that the Harvard meal
plan works out to exactly *2.97
per meal (ours is *5.40). No one
can tell me that it's because
Cambridge is a cheap place to live!
Yale's average price per meal is
about *3.50.
Something smells fishy here,
and it's not last week's scrod nug
gets.
So what's left for us oppressed
students? There are several op
tions. as I see it. Here are some
thoughts:
□ You could complain. Form
protest groups, organize rallies,
burn burger buns in effigy. . . .
□ Join a co-op. Bake bread, raise
chickens, eat them.
□ Become an eating associate at
one of the row or cluster houses.
They don't have much selection,
but most do save you some money.
□ Move to Mirrielees or Man
zanita. Buy bread, buy chickens,
eat them.
□ Keep track of what you pay and
deduct it from your contributions
when you're a wealthy alumnus.
Try staging a Centennial Celebra
tion with the money I contribute.

It's easy to start thinking of points
as dollars, as I did. Only when
you're forced to pay seven bucks
for a meal that would cost you at
most four at McDonald's or at
Tresidder do you realize how
much you're actually paying.
Oh, one other thing about Ster
ling Quad. If you have points left
over at the end of the quarter, you
can buy things like cases of your
favorite candy bar, yogurt or soft
drink. But it'll cost you. Twenty
four bucks for a case of Coke. Just
to give you an idea of how much
that is: If you had the quarters
and the desire you could get a case
for 14 bucks and some change out
of the nearest soda machine. It
would be about eight bucks at
Safeway. What an innovative sys
tem!
The quality of Food Service also
leaves something to be desired.
Bagels are stale. Main dishes run
out well before Food Service is
scheduled to close. Occasionally,
your choice is limited to food you
don't like or last Thursday's dry
leftovers, far less selective than
you'd get at a restaurant. Even at
a place like McDonald's, policy
states that its employees must
throw out fries after seven
minutes. For Food Service the
policy seems to be more like seven
days.
I think you're starting to see
what I'm getting at. My point is
simple: University Food Service
charges restaurant prices without
providing restaurant-quality food.
The next question is, why? Are we
being ripped off?
To answer this question you
have to look at Food Service itself.
It's University-run. It's not out to
make a profit (though I may have
something to say about that in fu
ture columns — I've been
promised a peek at the books).
Some people, namely University
and Food Service managers, tell
me that the enormous costs that
Food Service is forced to pay are
responsible for their pricing. Basi
cally. their claim is that the price
you pay for your food is more or
less the cost to them.
Admittedly, those costs are con
siderable. Food Service's full-time
workers — this means everyone
from the cook who flips the
burgers to the managers them
selves — are University employees.
They're paid salaries that are
higher than those you'd find in
even Palo Alto's high-priced res
taurants. They also collect
benefits like sick leave, disability
insurance, paid vacations, paid
personal days and all those other
good things that go along with
working for a behemoth like Stan
ford U. Denny's, on the other
hand, pays most of its employees

just a scratch above minimum
wage. You might want to think a
little before your march in the
next United Stanford Workers
rally.
Then there are also the count
less students Food Service
employs. Starting pay for them is
*4.40 an hour due to the Univer
sity's minimum wage. You might
want to think of Food Service as
another way of redistributing the
wealth. Take some money away
from the students who can afford
not to work and give it to those
who must.

To the people who insist on
defending Food Service with those
arguments, I pose two questions.
The first is, how come Saga can
provide similar service at lower
prices? A burger at Tresidder with
bacon and cheese runs a little over
two dollars. Fries will set you back
another 70 cents or so. Add 60
cents to that for a 12-ounce Coke
and 80 cents for two candy bars.
The total is a little over four dol
lars. The catch is, Saga has to pay
the same high costs that Food Ser
vice has to pay. According to the
people I spoke with there, their
employees get similar salaries and
benefits, and the students they
hire are paid roughly the same
wages. So much for Food Service's
enormous costs.
The second question I'd like to
ask those few of you who'd leap to
the defense of Food Service: How
come Harvard and Yale food
services don't charge as much?
The manager of Harvard's food
service informed me when 1
phoned her that the Harvard meal
plan works out to exactly *2.97
per meal (ours is *5.40). No one
can tell me that it's because
Cambridge is a cheap place to live!
Yale's average price per meal is
about *3.50.
Something smells fishy here,
and it's not last week's scrod nug
gets.
So what's left for us oppressed
students? There are several op
tions. as I see it. Here are some
thoughts:
□ You could complain. Form
protest groups, organize rallies,
burn burger buns in effigy. . . .
□ Join a co-op. Bake bread, raise
chickens, eat them.
□ Become an eating associate at
one of the row or cluster houses.
They don't have much selection,
but most do save you some money.
□ Move to Mirrielees or Man
zanita. Buy bread, buy chickens,
eat them.
□ Keep track of what you pay and
deduct it from your contributions
when you're a wealthy alumnus.
Try staging a Centennial Celebra
tion with the money I contribute.

"Can I have your meal card?"
I dug Into my pocket. It was
empty. I'd left my meal card in my
room.
"Uh, can I pay with cash?"
"Sure!" The girl smiled at me as
though she knew something I
didn't. She cleared the display and
began punching keys frantically.
Numbers blinked across the
screen too fast for me to read.
"Let's see. That's seven dollars and
five cents."
I swallowed hard and looked at
my dinner. The bacon
cheeseburger, fries, Coke and two
candy bars looked lonely on the
big tray.
"That cost me seven bucks?"
"Seven-o-five," she corrected.
I signed and took out my wallet.
Maybe some of you have had the
same experience. This happened
to me at Sterling Quad Dining Hall
last quarter.

Every day, those of us
"fortunate" enough to have a Uni
versity meal plan pull out a little
plastic card, hand it to a checker
and eat. Cash rarely changes
hands. At the beginning of every
quarter when we write out many
checks, who bothers to calculate
how much we pay per meal for
food service? The seven-hundred
and-some-odd dollars pales in
comparison to the hefty tuition
bill, and is slightly smaller than
even the room bill.
The truth is, we pay premium
prices without realizing it for
what many of us consider not-so
premium food. According to the
Lagunita Dining Hall Manager,
this is about what you pay per
meal if you live in Lag, Wilbur,
Roble, Stern, etc.: *3.25 for break
fast, *4.30 for lunch and for din
ner. a whopping *7.65.
Ah, well, you might be thinking,
if 1 had to eat at a restaurant every
meal I'd pay those prices anyway.
So maybe I could be eating at
McDonald's for lunch and Sizzler
for dinner. At least it's convenient.
It could be worse.
That's where you'd be wrong. It
Is worse. You see. Food Service
also counts on you missing a cer
tain number of meals each week.
Did you ever not feel hungry some
night? Go away for the weekend?
Miss brunch because of heavy Sat
urday night partying? Skip break
fast because you were late for
class? Well, those meals were
already figured into the prices you
paid at the beginning of the quar
ter.
Let's say you miss about two
meals a week, or even that you eat
every meal, but don't eat as much
as the average person. In a 10-
week quarter, that's around
twenty meals you've missed. You'd
now be paying about •3.77 for
breakfast. *6.15 for lunch and
• 8.87 for dinner. Change
McDonald's to Chili's and Sizzler
to the Prime Rib Inn.
But what about Sterling Quad,
where the University is trying out
the point system? Isn't it true that
there you pay only for the items

that you want? Sure it is. Every
serving of beans, can of Diet Coke
and ice cream sandwich costs you
a certain number of points, which
you buy at the beginning of the
quarter. But even there it's easy to
lose track of how much you're ac
tually spending. You see, the Uni
versity is very crafty about this
form of accounting. The points
you pay are roughly one-third of
the actual price of the item. A
canned soft drink, then, costs 35
points, but *1.05 in cash.
One dollar and Jive cents! My
meal above would have cost me
235 points, which as I found out
the hard way, is actually >7.05.
It's easy to start thinking of points
as dollars, as I did. Only when
you're forced to pay seven bucks

people I spoke with there, their
employees get similar salaries and
benefits, and the students they
hire are paid roughly the same
wages. So much for Food Service's
enormous costs.
The second question I'd like to
ask those few of you who'd leap to
the defense of Food Service: How
come Harvard and Yale food
services don't charge as much?
The manager of Harvard's food
service informed me when 1
phoned her that the Harvard meal
plan works out to exactly *2.97
per meal (ours is *5.40). No one
can tell me that it's because
Cambridge is a cheap place to live!
Yale's average price per meal is
about *3.50.
Something smells fishy here,
and it's not last week's scrod nug
gets.
So what's left for us oppressed
students? There are several op
tions. as I see it. Here are some
thoughts:
□ You could complain. Form
protest groups, organize rallies,
burn burger buns in effigy. . . .
□ Join a co-op. Bake bread, raise
chickens, eat them.
□ Become an eating associate at
one of the row or cluster houses.
They don't have much selection,
but most do save you some money.
□ Move to Mirrielees or Man
zanita. Buy bread, buy chickens,
eat them.
□ Keep track of what you pay and
deduct it from your contributions
when you're a wealthy alumnus.
Try staging a Centennial Celebra
tion with the money I contribute.
