# Vienna closing justified
## 
### 
The discussion of the closure of the Stanford
campus in Vienna has at times suggested that the
procedure by which that decision was reached was
precipitous, arbitrary and secretive. Without making
any attempt to articulate all of the elements of what
has been a complex evaluation, I would like to em
phasize that these claims convey important miscon
ceptions. Although any program in Overseas Studies
is particularly resistant to reform because of the evi
dent educational value derived from a stay outside
one's own country and because of the nostalgia that
we all attach to these experiences, realistic consider
ation of the financial, academic and administrative
dimensions of this choice may help to dispel existing
misconceptions.

THOMAS C. HELLER

The decision to concentrate our efforts and re
sources in centers other than Vienna was reached in
a period of more than a year through a representative
process that attempted to define priorities within the
entire Stanford system. The financial context in
which the closure decision was taken involves both
growth and recession. There is widespread agree
ment within the Stanford community that a geogra
phic reorientation of our international educational
opportunities is essential to the future of the Univer
sity. To involve ourselves with Western Europe al
most exclusively is to send an obviously reactionary
message about the cultural commitments to which
we aspire. The building of programs in East Asian,
Latin American and socialist-block countries
demands an expansion of the budget of Overseas
Studies at a time when all elements of the University,
including the School of Humanities and Sciences,
are being asked, through budget cuts and realloca
tions, to set internal priorities that realistically
combine innovative proposals with established
values. In addition, since 1985, Overseas Studies
has suffered an enormous decline in purchasing
power due to the depreciation of the dollar. Although
we have attempted to minimize these losses through
forward exchange purchases and have been aided by
the University in absorbing them, there is no reason
to believe the fall of the dollar is temporary, which
forces us to ask the University for new funds simply
to maintain the programs we already have. Finally,
there has existed until this year the idiosyncratic cir
cumstance that the Berlin center, although it has
been operating for a decade, has never been placed
on the normal University budget base. Funded
through a combination of now-exhausted currency
gains, one-time allocations and fund-raising, the
Berlin program has the capacity to carry out only a
part of its proposed activities. It is no longer possible
to continue the Berlin program in this unstable con
dition. Nor is it wise. The combination of these fac
tors has mandated the reconsideration of academic
priorities in Central Europe and throughout the
Overseas Studies system. It is to this task that the

several governing panels and the Program Commit
tee have given careful attention over the past year.
In the course of this reevalutlon no one has ever
disputed the absolute value of studying in Vienna.
However, three critical reasons have stood out for not
expending further resources to create a high quality
program in Austria.
First, for a number of years enrollments in Vienna,
as in Berlin, have been about half of what Is
desirable. While it has been contended that these fig
ures are the result of poor publicity and of a curricu
lunvthat focused too heavily upon historic Vienna, it
is notable that classes on contemporary Austria of
fered here at Stanford by distinguished Austrian
professors have also been quite small and that the
publicity accorded Vienna in the past period has
been no more and no less extensive than that given
to any other Overseas Center.
Second, while it would be foolish to assert that
Berlin and Vienna or Germany and Austria are cul
turally identical, it is also apparent that students
with a strong interest in contemporary Germanic
literature, theater, art and music, in the constitu
tion and future of social democracy, and In East-
West relations can pursue these educational objec
tives well In either Berlin or Vienna. With the addi
tion of the new program in Poland, the most essen
tial attribute of the Western site for East-West study
is not simply the ease of entry to the East.
Third, both the criticism of the Vienna center and
a consensus that its program be reformed to stress
the three areas of study listed above have existed in
essentially the same form since the early 19705,
Vienna was closed during 1972-3 and reopened a
year later with instructions to reorient study oppor
tunities in new directions. Since then, while there
has been an impressive range of innovative sugges
tions coming from the Berlin center on developing
new programs, the Vienna center has not produced
the measures that critics and supporters have
agreed are required.
Because there has existed a substantial agreement
about the need for and the academic direction of
change in Vienna, recent analysis has concentrated
upon the viability and cost of making these changes.
To suggest that personnel from Stanford or the Over
seas Studies office at Stanford should be dispatched
to Vienna for substantial periods of time to produce
the desired reforms is to ignore the fact that admin
istrative time is the scarcest resource in the system
and must be allocated with great care according to
overall priorities. Further, conversations held last
year with academics in Austria who are capable of
creating a dynamic and high quality program indi
cated that they, logically, are interested in building
an institution of a scope that would have an impact
on the Austrian educational community. However,
discussions with appropriate Austrian government
officials indicated that the political climate in
Austria at present is not conducive to innovative un
dertakings of such a scale.

is particularly resistant to reform because of the evi
dent educational value derived from a stay outside
one's own country and because of the nostalgia that
we all attach to these experiences, realistic consider
ation of the financial, academic and administrative
dimensions of this choice may help to dispel existing
misconceptions.

The decision to concentrate our efforts and re
sources in centers other than Vienna was reached in
a period of more than a year through a representative
process that attempted to define priorities within the
entire Stanford system. The financial context in
which the closure decision was taken involves both
growth and recession. There is widespread agree
ment within the Stanford community that a geogra
phic reorientation of our international educational
opportunities is essential to the future of the Univer
sity. To involve ourselves with Western Europe al
most exclusively is to send an obviously reactionary
message about the cultural commitments to which
we aspire. The building of programs in East Asian,
Latin American and socialist-block countries
demands an expansion of the budget of Overseas
Studies at a time when all elements of the University,
including the School of Humanities and Sciences,
are being asked, through budget cuts and realloca
tions, to set internal priorities that realistically
combine innovative proposals with established
values. In addition, since 1985, Overseas Studies
has suffered an enormous decline in purchasing
power due to the depreciation of the dollar. Although
we have attempted to minimize these losses through
forward exchange purchases and have been aided by
the University in absorbing them, there is no reason
to believe the fall of the dollar is temporary, which
forces us to ask the University for new funds simply
to maintain the programs we already have. Finally,
there has existed until this year the idiosyncratic cir
cumstance that the Berlin center, although it has
been operating for a decade, has never been placed
on the normal University budget base. Funded
through a combination of now-exhausted currency
gains, one-time allocations and fund-raising, the
Berlin program has the capacity to carry out only a
part of its proposed activities. It is no longer possible
to continue the Berlin program in this unstable con
dition. Nor is it wise. The combination of these fac
tors has mandated the reconsideration of academic
priorities in Central Europe and throughout the
Overseas Studies system. It is to this task that the

several governing panels and the Program Commit
tee have given careful attention over the past year.
In the course of this reevalutlon no one has ever
disputed the absolute value of studying in Vienna.
However, three critical reasons have stood out for not
expending further resources to create a high quality
program in Austria.
First, for a number of years enrollments in Vienna,
as in Berlin, have been about half of what Is
desirable. While it has been contended that these fig
ures are the result of poor publicity and of a curricu
lunvthat focused too heavily upon historic Vienna, it
is notable that classes on contemporary Austria of
fered here at Stanford by distinguished Austrian
professors have also been quite small and that the
publicity accorded Vienna in the past period has
been no more and no less extensive than that given
to any other Overseas Center.
Second, while it would be foolish to assert that
Berlin and Vienna or Germany and Austria are cul
turally identical, it is also apparent that students
with a strong interest in contemporary Germanic
literature, theater, art and music, in the constitu
tion and future of social democracy, and In East-
West relations can pursue these educational objec
tives well In either Berlin or Vienna. With the addi
tion of the new program in Poland, the most essen
tial attribute of the Western site for East-West study
is not simply the ease of entry to the East.
Third, both the criticism of the Vienna center and
a consensus that its program be reformed to stress
the three areas of study listed above have existed in
essentially the same form since the early 19705,
Vienna was closed during 1972-3 and reopened a
year later with instructions to reorient study oppor
tunities in new directions. Since then, while there
has been an impressive range of innovative sugges
tions coming from the Berlin center on developing
new programs, the Vienna center has not produced
the measures that critics and supporters have
agreed are required.
Because there has existed a substantial agreement
about the need for and the academic direction of
change in Vienna, recent analysis has concentrated
upon the viability and cost of making these changes.
To suggest that personnel from Stanford or the Over
seas Studies office at Stanford should be dispatched
to Vienna for substantial periods of time to produce
the desired reforms is to ignore the fact that admin
istrative time is the scarcest resource in the system
and must be allocated with great care according to
overall priorities. Further, conversations held last
year with academics in Austria who are capable of
creating a dynamic and high quality program indi
cated that they, logically, are interested in building
an institution of a scope that would have an impact
on the Austrian educational community. However,
discussions with appropriate Austrian government
officials indicated that the political climate in
Austria at present is not conducive to innovative un
dertakings of such a scale.

Studies Program.
