## Wanted: An IR theme house 
### JULIANA HORSEMAN 
"Today we live in a global world that is increas
ingly interdependent. The need for understanding
relations between nations is vital. An interna
tional relations (IR) house will cater this need." ac
cording to junior Blair King.
King and other students are working to estab
lish an iR house as a choice in this spring's
housing draw.
Senior Kurt Johnson, a history major, came up
with the idea after hearing of a proposed arts
theme house. He took his idea to Laurie
McCutcheon. president of the student-run Inter
national Relations Society, to get that group's
backing.
According to Johnson, McCutcheon said, "an IR
theme house at Stanford would be a fantastic and
worthwhile project because of its broad appeal."
The first step involved distributing Interest
sheets among IR faculty in order to see how en
thusiastic they were about participating in the
house's functions. The response was positive.
"The staff was willing to act as teachers for
house seminars, RFs (Resident Fellows) and pro
gram directors if the project gets off the ground,"
McCutcheon said.
Generating student support was initially not as
encouraging. Despite announcements in The
Daily and fliers inviting students to an interest
meeting, the turnout was very poor. However, the
organizers were undaunted.
"We've been approached by many enthusiastic
students who apologized for having missed the
meeting," McCutcheon said.
The idea of another theme house on campus is a
subject of controversy among Stanford students.
"Who's to say that a house should cater to IR
majors rather than EE (electrical engineering)
majors?" one sophomore asked.
Another student said that the proliferation of
theme houses on campus directly contradicted
Stanford's idea of student diversity. As an IR
major, the student pointed to the large number of
foreign student groups and services on campus
and demanded why IR functions "should be
confined to a little esoteric faction."
Proponents of the IR theme house dismiss the
notion that such a house encourages segregation
among majors.
"IR is such a good candidate for a theme house
since it encompasses so much and can be enjoyed
by a wide range of majors, from political science to
anthropology to sociology majors," said Janet
Schmidt, academic program officer of the Over
seas Studies Program and an applicant for the
house's resident fellow position.
Barbara Burwlck, co-chairman of the IR Depart
ment, also stressed the "broad diversity of inter
ests" that could be represented in the house, and

encouraged all majors to get Involved.
A former International studies lecturer at Notre
Dame University and Western Culture lecturer at
Stanford, Schmidt said she finds the arguments
of students who do not favor the proposal weak.
"Of course Intellectual discussions of topics of
Interest will be encouraged, but no one will be
forced to attend," she said.
Johnson said he hoped that house members
could attend speeches together and discuss them
over dinner. Schmidt stressed the Importance of
discussion and spoke of senior IR majors who
regretted not having been able to talk about issues
in depth.
"Talking allows you to Internalize your under
standing of things." she said. "It forces you to put
an Idea together which makes it really yours."
Another regret of graduating students is their
lack of exposure to current events, according to
Schmidt.
"With accessible quality news programs, such
as the MacNeil-Lehrer report, and well-done Inter
national periodicals, students could easily be able
to keep up to date with current Issues," Schmidt
said.
Johnson termed as phenomenal the amount of
resources at Stanford that could support the pro
posed house functions. Schmidt included foreign
students among such resources.
"Foreign students are fantastic resources of
knowledge. They have something to say to Ameri
can students but can be reluctant to discuss ques
tions they may have or perceptions they've made.
An IR house would help promote such discus
sion."
Johnson and McCutcheon have expressed an
interest in occupying a row house because of Its
central location, suitable number of residents and
a building structure that is conducive to house
seminars.
However, one sophomore resident of Stern said,
"Why not turn Stern and Wilbur Into theme
houses?" He added that "If the residents are really
into their majors and seminars, then they prob
ably won't mind about the actual building they're
living In."
Whether an IR theme house on the Row
becomes a reality for next fall depends on Residen
tial Education's decision.
According to Res Ed guidelines, the project will
only be supported if it Is backed by "demonstrated
student support." In order to account for students
who change their mind or venture overseas, there
must be 25 percent more students willing to live
in the house than there are places.
Although the organizers are confident they have
the necessary backing, Schmidt readily points out
that the project will require hard work on the part
of many.

An IR house would help promote such discus
sion."
Johnson and McCutcheon have expressed an
interest in occupying a row house because of Its
central location, suitable number of residents and
a building structure that is conducive to house
seminars.
However, one sophomore resident of Stern said,
"Why not turn Stern and Wilbur Into theme
houses?" He added that "If the residents are really
into their majors and seminars, then they prob
ably won't mind about the actual building they're
living In."
Whether an IR theme house on the Row
becomes a reality for next fall depends on Residen
tial Education's decision.
According to Res Ed guidelines, the project will
only be supported if it Is backed by "demonstrated
student support." In order to account for students
who change their mind or venture overseas, there
must be 25 percent more students willing to live
in the house than there are places.
Although the organizers are confident they have
the necessary backing, Schmidt readily points out
that the project will require hard work on the part
of many.
