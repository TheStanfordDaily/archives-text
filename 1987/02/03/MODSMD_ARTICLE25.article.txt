## Baseball scheduled to meet UOP Cardinal nine likely to be rained out again 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Three for seven is usually
thought of as a pretty good situa
tion in baseball. A batter who can
consistently go three for seven will
hit about .430, an average that
ensures fame, fortune and a trip
to Cooperstown, N.Y.
But for Stanford, three for seven
has meant only frustration. Of the
seven games the Cardinal has had
scheduled this season, just three
have been played. Stanford suf
fered its fourth rainout of the
season yesterday when its game
against Santa Clara was
postponed. It will be played in
stead on Feb. 23 at Sunken Dia
mond.
"There's not much you can do
about it; it comes with the terri
tory," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "You just play
when you can."
It is likely that the Cardinal will
have to endure washout number
five today, as its 3 p.m. contest in
Stockton against the University of
the Pacific will probably be rained
out. UOP Coach John Picone and
Marquess will not make a decision
until this morning, but yesterday
afternoon Picone told the Tiger
Sports Information Department
not to expect a game.
The postponement of the con
test may mean that UOP gets
washed away rather than blown
away. The Tigers are currently 0-3
on the young season after being
swept on the road by less-than
powerful U.S. International.
The top returning player from a
UOP team that went 22-26 overall
and 7-14 in the Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association last season is
senior catcher Joe Ortiz. Ortiz, a
second-team A1I-PCAA selection
last year, led the Tigers in hitting

at .318.
Ortiz also paced both the Tigers
and the PCAA in steals with 31. A
catcher leading a league in stolen
bases occurs about as often as a
legitimate outcome in a profes
sional wrestling match.

There's not
much you can
do about it - it
comes with the
territory. You
just play when
you can.

Marquess

While UOP has floundered,
Stanford has turned In two con
secutive solid performances to
raise its record to 2-1. After losing
its opener 2-1 to San Jose State,
the Cardinal has bounced back to
beat the Spartans 7-1 and Santa
Clara 6-2.
The most impressive part of the
Cardinal team has, not supris
ingly, been its pitching, including
a three-hit, no-earned-run
complete-game outing by Lee
Plemel Sunday. The Stanford staff
has surrendered just three earned
runs in 26 innings for a 1.04
earned run average. Steve
Chitren, who was denied a start
by rain last week, is scheduled to
pitch today for the Cardinal.

Junior pitcher Lee Plemel picked up the win in Stanford's most recent game, a 6-2
defeat of Santa Clara. Both Bronco runs were unearned, as Plemel allowed just three
hits and evened his record at 1-1.
