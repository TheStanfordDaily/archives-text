# Miller's AT&T win deserving of Crosby name
## 
### 
This weekend was somewhat unusual for me —
I didn't go home for the Crosby. Or. as it is now
called, the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
It's not that I didn't want to. but I was in
Oregon, covering the Stanford men's and
women's basketball teams. It was only the second
time in over 12 years that I have missed the
Crosby — sorry. AT&T — and the other time I was
overseas.

The annual event in my hometown of Pebble
Beach is special in a number of ways — there are
always lots of celebrities playing right alongside
the world's top golfers, the setting is spectacular
and it's a charity event. But this year it was even
more special. Johnny Miller won.
Johnny Miller is one of the few golfers' names I
remember from my early childhood. My mother is
an avid golfer, and he has always been one of her
favorites. "I'm so glad he won!" she said on the
phone last night. "He was so gorgeous! But he's
aged so much 1 can't believe it."
Miller does look a lot older than I recall, mainly
because he hasn't done much of anything since
the early '70s, back in the days when he seemed
unbeatable. The San Francisco native was big
news in those days, especially here in Northern
California. He won the U.S. Open in 1973 and
made the covers of Sports Illustrated and
Newsweek as "Golfs Golden Boy."
Miller has played in the Crosby ever since I've
been going — and even before I was born — as he
played his first Crosby in 1965. He won the tourn
ament in 1974 and finished second (following a
playoff with Jack Nicklaus) in 1972. But it has
been four years since Miller won his last event,
and he hasn't been a solid contender for at least
two years.
This all added up to another dramatic finish for
the tournament this year, especially as Miller has
