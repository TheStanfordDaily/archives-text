# Miller's AT&T win deserving of Crosby name
## 
### 
This weekend was somewhat unusual for me —
I didn't go home for the Crosby. Or. as it is now
called, the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
It's not that I didn't want to. but I was in
Oregon, covering the Stanford men's and
women's basketball teams. It was only the second
time in over 12 years that I have missed the
Crosby — sorry. AT&T — and the other time I was
overseas.

The annual event in my hometown of Pebble
Beach is special in a number of ways — there are
always lots of celebrities playing right alongside
the world's top golfers, the setting is spectacular
and it's a charity event. But this year it was even
more special. Johnny Miller won.
Johnny Miller is one of the few golfers' names I
remember from my early childhood. My mother is
an avid golfer, and he has always been one of her
favorites. "I'm so glad he won!" she said on the
phone last night. "He was so gorgeous! But he's
aged so much 1 can't believe it."
Miller does look a lot older than I recall, mainly
because he hasn't done much of anything since
the early '70s, back in the days when he seemed
unbeatable. The San Francisco native was big
news in those days, especially here in Northern
California. He won the U.S. Open in 1973 and
made the covers of Sports Illustrated and
Newsweek as "Golfs Golden Boy."
Miller has played in the Crosby ever since I've
been going — and even before I was born — as he
played his first Crosby in 1965. He won the tourn
ament in 1974 and finished second (following a
playoff with Jack Nicklaus) in 1972. But it has
been four years since Miller won his last event,
and he hasn't been a solid contender for at least
two years.
This all added up to another dramatic finish for
the tournament this year, especially as Miller has

been bothered by a groin injury
and nearly withdrew after the
seventh hole at Pebble Beach Golf
Course Saturday. He blrdied No.
7. however, kept going, and
wound up with a round of 68 after
par rounds of 72 at Cypress Point
and Spyglass Hill. This left Miller
five strokes in back of Payne
Stewart going into the last day of
play.
No one really even noticed Miller
the final day, as everyone was too
busy concentrating on Stewart's

attire (plus-fours) and Lanny Wad
kins. who won the PGA title at
Pebble Beach in 1977. Miller shot
a 66 to Stewart's 72. and won by a
stroke, suprising everyone, in
cluding himself.
What a great finish for Miller,
now approaching his 40th
birthday, to win a tournament he
has been playing since he was 18
years old. on a course that he calls
his favorite. Miller even refers to
the event as his "home tourna
ment."
It's also great for the Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am. which
has been undergoing something
of an identity crisis in the wake of
Kathryn Crosby's controversial

decision to withdraw the family
name from the event because of
the "commercialization" of the
tournament. Bing's sons, Harry
and Nathanlal, remain the co
hosts of the now-AT&T sponsored
tour stop, but nevertheless, there
have been complaints that the
Pro-Am does not draw the big
name celebrities that it once did.
and that it does not have the same
atmosphere that it did in the old
Crosby Clambake days.
Still, the event attracts some
pretty major stars: Clint
Eastwood, a fairly well-known ac
tor, and more important, the
mayor of Carmel; Jack Lemmon;
Telly Savalas; Glen Campbell;

James Garner and Stanford's own
Bob Murphy, of KCBS fame. The
list goes on and on. And they're
generally friendly and ap
proachable too, with the possible
exception of Garner, who punched
a photographer a few years ago.
And the sports stars! Willie
Mays. Willie McCovey. Dan
Marino. Johnny Bench. Mike
Schmidt.
Some of the amateurs can even
play golf. Kansas City Royals' third
baseman George Brett teamed up
with Fred Couples to win the Pro-
Am title, although his 17 hand
icap (a rough guess by Couples
and fellow pro John Cook) has
been called into question after the

baseball star's successes on three
of America's most difficult
courses.
Finally, the Pebble Beach Pro-
Am still draws the big name gol
fers. including Nicklaus. Tom
Watson and Greg Norman — and
Johnny Miller.
Miller's comeback at Pebble on
Sunday underscores the present
tournament's link with the Crosby
of old. He and Crosby were
friends, going all the way back to
the times when Miller caddied for
Crosby at the San Francisco Golf
Club. In fact, the singer gave the
young golfer his first invitation to
play in the event.
Miller, like the rest of us for

whom the tournament is so spe
cial. still has difficulty with the
name. "I keep calling this the
Crosby." he said after his win on
Sunday.
Maybe someday the name will be
reinstated. The event is still essen
tially the same, only the name dif
fers. In fact, the Pro-Am is even
more succeessful as a charity
event (its original purpose) now
that AT&T pays *750.000 a year
as a sponsor. Over • 1 million was
raised for youth charities this
year.
Certainly that accomplishment
is worthy of the Crosby name —
and so is Miller's memorable
comeback win.

has been playing since he was 18
years old. on a course that he calls
his favorite. Miller even refers to
the event as his "home tourna
ment."
It's also great for the Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am. which
has been undergoing something
of an identity crisis in the wake of
Kathryn Crosby's controversial

decision to withdraw the family
name from the event because of
the "commercialization" of the
tournament. Bing's sons, Harry
and Nathanlal, remain the co
hosts of the now-AT&T sponsored
tour stop, but nevertheless, there
have been complaints that the
Pro-Am does not draw the big
name celebrities that it once did.
and that it does not have the same
atmosphere that it did in the old
Crosby Clambake days.
Still, the event attracts some
pretty major stars: Clint
Eastwood, a fairly well-known ac
tor, and more important, the
mayor of Carmel; Jack Lemmon;
Telly Savalas; Glen Campbell;

James Garner and Stanford's own
Bob Murphy, of KCBS fame. The
list goes on and on. And they're
generally friendly and ap
proachable too, with the possible
exception of Garner, who punched
a photographer a few years ago.
And the sports stars! Willie
Mays. Willie McCovey. Dan
Marino. Johnny Bench. Mike
Schmidt.
Some of the amateurs can even
play golf. Kansas City Royals' third
baseman George Brett teamed up
with Fred Couples to win the Pro-
Am title, although his 17 hand
icap (a rough guess by Couples
and fellow pro John Cook) has
been called into question after the

baseball star's successes on three
of America's most difficult
courses.
Finally, the Pebble Beach Pro-
Am still draws the big name gol
fers. including Nicklaus. Tom
Watson and Greg Norman — and
Johnny Miller.
Miller's comeback at Pebble on
Sunday underscores the present
tournament's link with the Crosby
of old. He and Crosby were
friends, going all the way back to
the times when Miller caddied for
Crosby at the San Francisco Golf
Club. In fact, the singer gave the
young golfer his first invitation to
play in the event.
Miller, like the rest of us for

whom the tournament is so spe
cial. still has difficulty with the
name. "I keep calling this the
Crosby." he said after his win on
Sunday.
Maybe someday the name will be
reinstated. The event is still essen
tially the same, only the name dif
fers. In fact, the Pro-Am is even
more succeessful as a charity
event (its original purpose) now
that AT&T pays *750.000 a year
as a sponsor. Over • 1 million was
raised for youth charities this
year.
Certainly that accomplishment
is worthy of the Crosby name —
and so is Miller's memorable
comeback win.
This weekend was somewhat unusual for me —
I didn't go home for the Crosby. Or. as it is now
called, the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
It's not that I didn't want to. but I was in
Oregon, covering the Stanford men's and
women's basketball teams. It was only the second
time in over 12 years that I have missed the
Crosby — sorry. AT&T — and the other time I was
overseas.

The annual event in my hometown of Pebble
Beach is special in a number of ways — there are
always lots of celebrities playing right alongside
the world's top golfers, the setting is spectacular
and it's a charity event. But this year it was even
more special. Johnny Miller won.
Johnny Miller is one of the few golfers' names I
remember from my early childhood. My mother is
an avid golfer, and he has always been one of her
favorites. "I'm so glad he won!" she said on the
phone last night. "He was so gorgeous! But he's
aged so much 1 can't believe it."
Miller does look a lot older than I recall, mainly
because he hasn't done much of anything since
the early '70s, back in the days when he seemed
unbeatable. The San Francisco native was big
news in those days, especially here in Northern
California. He won the U.S. Open in 1973 and
made the covers of Sports Illustrated and
Newsweek as "Golfs Golden Boy."
Miller has played in the Crosby ever since I've
been going — and even before I was born — as he
played his first Crosby in 1965. He won the tourn
ament in 1974 and finished second (following a
playoff with Jack Nicklaus) in 1972. But it has
been four years since Miller won his last event,
and he hasn't been a solid contender for at least
two years.
This all added up to another dramatic finish for
the tournament this year, especially as Miller has

been bothered by a groin injury
and nearly withdrew after the
seventh hole at Pebble Beach Golf
Course Saturday. He blrdied No.
7. however, kept going, and
wound up with a round of 68 after
par rounds of 72 at Cypress Point
and Spyglass Hill. This left Miller
five strokes in back of Payne
Stewart going into the last day of
play.
No one really even noticed Miller
the final day, as everyone was too
busy concentrating on Stewart's

attire (plus-fours) and Lanny Wad
kins. who won the PGA title at
Pebble Beach in 1977. Miller shot
a 66 to Stewart's 72. and won by a
stroke, suprising everyone, in
cluding himself.
What a great finish for Miller,
now approaching his 40th
birthday, to win a tournament he
has been playing since he was 18
years old. on a course that he calls
his favorite. Miller even refers to
the event as his "home tourna
