# Stanford fencing teams beat San Francisco St.
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
It was just another day at the office for
the Stanford fencing teams Saturday;
they won, and nobody seemed to notice.
The men's and women's teams both
defeated their hosts from San Francisco
State by scores of 15-12 and 13-3,
respectively.
This season has been a tough one for
the fencers as their funding was drasti
cally cut by the Athletic Department
prior to this year. Because of this, the
team cannot recruit and few of the
team's fencers have ever donned a foil,
sabre or epee before coming to Stanford.
The teams are also very young this year,
especially the men's squad, in which five
of the nine starters are in their first year
of varsity competition.
The teams have been doing well
anyway, especially the women, who are

now 10-3. They were led Saturday, as
usual, by two seniors, No. 1 fencer Holly
Taylor and No. 2 fencer Alyson Yarus,
both of whom won all three of their
matches. "Both Holly and Alyson had a
particularly good day," said Head Coach
Buzz Hurst. "I was quite satisfied with
the women's performances."
The Cardinal faced an undermanned
S.F. State women's squad which was
only able to field five of six fencers. S.F.
State has only a club program and no
permanent coach. No. 3 fencer Tracy
Schmidt, a junior, was also a perfect 3-
0, while freshman Elisabeth Spilman
and sophomore Juliet Johnson helped
the effort, posting records of 2-1 and 2-
2, respectively.
It was another story for the men's
team, now 7-7 on the year. "The men's
team fenced very flat," said Hurst. The
team has been up and down all year due
to inexperience. While the strong sabre

team is experienced, two of three on the
epee team, and all three foil starters are
in their first year of collegiate competi
tion.
"We've been really inconsistant," said
senior co-captain Steve Levitan. "I still
think that we're going to get better. We
have a lot of potential."
Levitan and junior Mike Cramer led
the sabre team to a 7-2 triumph, as each
went undefeated. The epee team also
won, 5-4, behind the 3-0 record of the
other co-captain, senior Larry Murk.
The young foil team fell, however, by a 3-
6 score, after a perfect day by Gator fen
cer Tom Vladhos.
Hurst said the biggest problem with
the men is mental. "These guys
(Stanford's young fencers) are better
than they think they are." he said.
"Technically they've made a great im-

provement. They're fencing at
their expectations, not their abil
ity."
The Cardinal hopes to resolve
its problems before next month's
West regional of the NCAA fencing
competition, when the fencers will
try for their ninth straight top

three finish. Levitan thinks it's a
definite possibility. "It's tough to
say (how Stanford will do)," he
said. "I think we have the poten
tial (to win). No team in the West
has significantly impressed me as
being better."
The other top schools in the
West region are Air Force (which
defeated the Cardinal by a 18-9
score Jan. 23) and Long Beach
State (which has not fenced Stan
ford).

The women are in a diferent po
sition, as they are considered the
top team in the West, a bit above
UC-Santa Cruz. The women have
won the West regional for three
consecutive years and have never
lost to UCSC.
The Banana Slugs will get an
other chance at the Cardinal on
Saturday, as Stanford closes its
home dual match season at Roble
Gym.
