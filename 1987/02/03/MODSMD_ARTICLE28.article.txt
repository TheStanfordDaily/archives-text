In the past, Stanford Women's Tennis Coach
Frank Brennan has chosen to give his reserves some
match time early in the season. This year, he will do
so out of necessity.
With three of its top players hobbled by injuries,
the defending national champion Cardinal will open
the 1987 dual-match season today at 1:30 p.m. at
the Varsity Tennis Courts against Rollins College
(Fla.).
No. 1 ranked Stanford will be without junior Cari
Hagey, out with a slight muscle pull, and sophomore
Eleni Rossides and senior Leigh Anne Eldredge â€”
both of whom are suffering from stress-fracture in
juries.
Hagey was unable to compete in last week's chal
lenge matches but may play doubles today. Rossides
and Eldredge. however, will be out for some time.
Rossides. a highly touted freshman last year, has
now been off the courts for almost a year. She was 4-
1 playing at No. 2 singles last year for the Cardinal
before she was forced to miss the rest of the season.
"I just don't know what to think with Eleni." Bren
nan said, regarding the possibility that Rossides will
play this season.
Brennan would like to think that Eldredge will not
be out of action as long as Rossides has been, but the
stress fracture Injury is very unpredictable. "I'm
hoping by the end of the month she'll be ready." he

"I think we're going to be a really good team with

everybody healthy," Brennan said. "We'll be a good
team without."
Even without Rossides and Eldredge, Stanford still
has four players (including Hagey) returning from
last year's championship team. Defending singles
champion Patty Fendick, riding a 28-match win
streak, will return at No. 1 singles today. The cele
brated senior won both tournaments she competed
in during January.
Also hack from last season are senior Stephanie
Savides and junior Kay Tittle. Savides, who played
No. 4 last year, will be at No. 2 singles today. Tittle,
who was In the No. 5 slot last season, moves up to
No. 3 today.
Three newcomers will be in the lineup for the Card
inal today and could play an important role all season
if the physical conditions of Rossides and Eldredge
do not improve.
Lisa Green is only a freshman, but she has already
made an impact at Stanford. The native of San Jose
advanced to the finals of the National Collegiate Clas
sic Jan. 4 at Cathredal City, and was a quarter
finalist two weeks ago at the Women's Intercollegiate
Invitational in Pacific Palisades. Green will play No. 4
singles today for the Cardinal.
In the No. 5 and No. 6 slots against Rollins will be
freshman Valerie Wilson and Cindy Buchsbaum, a
transfer from Harvard.
Fendick and Savides. winners of the doubles title
at Pacific Palisades, will open at No. 1 doubles today.
At No. 2 are Green and Tittle, and the No. 3 team will
be Wilson and Hagey. unless Hagey is not ready, in
