# Stanford rugby crushes Broncos at home in mud
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
As the skies gray, the thoughts
of the Stanford Rugby Club turn
to getting very muddy. The club
also turned to winning Saturday,
at the expense of Santa Clara Uni
versity, by a 40-0 score. The Card
inal second team also won, 8-3.
It was the first win for the club
after three consecutive road
matches. The Cardinal recently
lost to UC-Davis. St. Mary's and
the Banana Slugs of UC-Santa
Cruz. The Cardinal did earn a lot
of respect on the trips, and its for
wards were called "the best college
pack" in California that Davis has
faced, according to the Aggie
coach.
The forwards continued their
strong play this weekend, but it
was the backline play that won the
match for the Cardinal. The shut
out testifies to the team's defen

sive play. The team was also able
to set up the offense for many
scoring oppurtunities.
Tries by Bill Clark and Bob
Whiteland led to an eight-point
lead at the half. In the second half,
forwards and backs got into the
scoring to produce the final mar
gin.
The team will be able to stay at
home for the next few weeks, as
they host Bay Area Touring Squad
(BATS). British Columbia and
California (the defending national
champions) over the next three
weekends.
The club is also fundraising to
pay for its trip to the annual Inter
national Rugby Festival in
Freeport. Bahamas.
All the club hopes for, now that
it is at home again and the backs
have come around, is continued
strong play from the forwards and
more rain so the players can play
around in nice, soft mud.
