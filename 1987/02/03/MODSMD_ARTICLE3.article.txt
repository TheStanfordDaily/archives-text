### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Two research programs at the Hoover Insti
tution recently received >1.2 million in grants
from the J. Howard Freedom Trust to support
various research projects concerning domestic
and national security policy issues.
The Domestic Studies Program, coordinated
by John Raisian, senior research fellow and as
sociate Institution director, received *1 mil
lion. Most of the grant money will be used to
fund individual projects conducted by various
Hoover fellows, Raisian said.
"These grants come in basically one pot that
we try to cover the whole program with," he
said.
The remaining *200,000 of the grant will go
to the Institution's National Security Affairs
Program, coordinated by Senior Fellow Dennis
Bark.

According to Bark, "the money will go
towards supporting individual projects and
some group projects." Projects usually involve
12-15 researchers.
"We have a group working on what we call
the Soviet Strategy Project, which analyzes So
viet activities outside of the USSR," Bark said.
The group just published a book titled "The
Red Orchestra: Instruments of Soviet Foreign
Policy in Latin America and the Caribbean."
"Almost the entire program is supported by
grants from foundations," Bark explained.
"This program was given a major expansion in
the fall of 1983. We expect the Soviet Strategy
Project to continue over another three-year
period," he satdr w - ••
"This year we will begin another program
dealing with the economics of national
defense," Bark said, adding that part of the
program will involve seminars and conferences
with nationally-known scholars.

He said another book resulting from re
search conducted through the National Secur
ity Affairs Program on Soviet activity in Africa
is due for publication "probably at the end of
this year."
The entire Hoover budget is approximately
$12.7 million this year, of which $4 to ®5 mil
lion comes from grants. The largest grant is
provided by the Pew Trust. "Pew is 25 percent
of Hoover's gifts expended this year, or one
twelfth of the Institution's total budget,"
Raisian said.
Approximately *4 million comes from the
University for support of the Institution's li-
and Jkrt-hlvep while approximately <4
million comes from the interest earned from
the Institution's original endowment.
The money from grants and other gifts
primarily goes toward "current operating ex
penses," Raisian said.
