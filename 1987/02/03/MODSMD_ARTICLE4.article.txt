# Activists to sponsor SDI programs
## 
### JEFF SEINFELD Staff writer 
A student activist group yesterday
proclaimed February "SDI Awareness Month,"
in an effort to educate the Stanford commu
nity about the Reagan administration's Strate
gic Defense Initiative (SDI) and the program's
relationship with the University.
Stanford Action for Nuclear Disarmament
(STAND) opposes SDI and especially SDI re
search being conducted at the University, ac
cording to graduate student Scott Bohning,
the group s spokesman.
This month in 10 dormitories, STAND mem
bers will show an educational film, to be fol
lowed by group discussions.
The organization will also present two short
films preceding regularly scheduled Tuesday
Night Film features, hold a rally in White Plaza
and collect signatures of students opposed to
the University's involvement in SDI research,
Bohning said.
After the month of efforts to increase stu

dent awareness, STAND plans to begin lobby
ing for a University policy limiting SDI re
search, Bohning said.
The film being shown in the dorms, "Star
Wars: The Search for Security," produced by
Physicians for Social Responsibility, is neutral
on SDI, according to senior Dianne Honigberg,
a STAND member.
Bohning said the discussions following the
films will be open to all viewpoints. The pur
pose is not "to shove things down people's
throats," he added.
The two short films which will precede the
Tuesday Night Film in Cubberley Auditorium
Feb. 10 have a more biased viewpoint, Honig
berg said. The films will be "The Last Fron
tier," a brief documentary, and "Weapons in
Space," an short animated film.
Each Wednesday, STAND will collect
signatures in White Plaza of students who
oppose the involvement of University faculty
and facilities in SDI research. The signatures
will support "a letter of concern," which is still
being drafted. Bohning said.

According to a pamphlet prepared by
STAND, SDI spending at Stanford will exceed
$23 million in the next few years. The
pamphlet stated that development of the "free
electron laser," which Bohning called "one of
the main weapons in SDI," already involves
over >4 million.
Bohning said that although Stanford re
searchers accept money with political
neutrality in mind, their names and involve
ment help justify SDI to Congress. "Accepting
funding is not a neutral act." he said.
The rally in White Plaza, scheduled for
March 2. will feature two or three speakers and
will be followed in the evening by a speech by
retired Air Force Lt. Col. Robert Bowman, pres
ident of the Institute for Space and Security
Studies, Bohning said.
Bowman, a former director of SDI-related re
search projects, has since become an anti-SDI
activist, Bohning said.
Although STAND officially opposes SDI,
Bohning admitted that the research also
brings about important, non-military develop
ments.
