# Faculty policy under review
## Minority representation disputed 
### MICHAEL WOLFE Staff Writer 
Stanford is attempting to in
crease representation of women
and minorities in its faculty by
placing added emphasis on af
firmative action recruitment and
urging undergraduates to con
sider doctoral programs, accord
ing to University administrators.
Acting University President
James Rosse presented an affirm
ative action report to the Faculty
Senate Jan. 22 which outlined the
University's progress in the
recruitment of women and
minority faculty and its goals for
the near future.
Rosse reported that women
make up 10.3 percent of the Uni
versity faculty, while blacks,
Chicanos and Native Americans
comprise 7.3 percent. These fig
ures are up from 1971 statistics of
4.3 percent women and 3.7 per
cent minorities.
Rosse said that while these
numbers are comparable to per
centages at other universities.

Stanford hopes to improve them
soon.
Elizabeth Traugott. dean of
Graduate Studies, said the num
bers of women and minorities en
tering graduate programs haven't
risen notably in recent years. "In
essence, we've been in a steady
state," she said. "The numbers of
women and minorities increased
in the early '70s, but have quit
rising."
She said Stanford graduate de
partments attempt to reach out to
as many students as possible by
designating associate deans to act
as representatives to recruit
talented students from the three
main minority groups — black,
American Indian and Chicano —
to tell students about the Univer
sity's graduate programs.
The University has begun long
range efforts to lure minority stu
dents from this generation of un
dergraduates into academic fields
in order to fill the next generation
of teaching positions, according
to Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee.
Lougee noted that the Univer
sity has no women professors in
mathematics, physics or applied
physics, and only one in econom
ics.
"Research we have been doing
shows that this is not because
women are iess able quan
titatively, but cultural factors
cause them to drop out of these
fields." she said.
University Affirmative Action
Officer Santiago Rodriguez said
the upcoming years will be crucial
in any effort to change the compo
sition of the faculty at Stanford
and other universities.
"In the next decade or two, there
will be a big turnover in college
faculties around the country.
Many members of the current gen
eration of professors will be retir
ing, and universities will be
working to attract skilled faculty
members," he said.
Rodriguez added that the num
bers of students presently enter
ing doctoral programs is much
lower than the University would
like.
Lougee said Stanford is imple
menting a number of programs to
encourage undergraduate stu
dents of all races to consider

teaching fields. "We are just get
ting started, in part because the
academic job market is becoming
more viable. More positions will be
open in the early '90s,'' she said.
Several programs which aim to
promote teaching careers are de
signed to expose undergraduate
women and minority students to
research. For example. Lougee
said, the African and Afro-
American Studies Undergraduate
Scholars Program gives black stu
dents the opportunity to work
one-on-one with a faculty member
on a research project. She also
said that the Women's Network in
Science and Engineering will pro
vide faculty and graduate mentors
for undergraduate women.
Traugott said Stanford also
needs to recruit more women and
minority students at the under
graduate level. "I feel we ought to
do more outreach to high schools.
We need to develop this kind of
setting for everyone.
"If we have an academic com
munity without the perspectives
of different people, then we're
losing out," she said.
Amanda Kemp, chairperson of
the Black Student Union, said she
felt the small number of minority
professors hurts minority stu
dents. "When minority students
want to start programs, they will
find that they don't have anyone
in the faculty to go to," she said.
