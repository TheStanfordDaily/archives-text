# Faculty policy under review
## Minority representation disputed 
### MICHAEL WOLFE Staff Writer 
Stanford is attempting to in
crease representation of women
and minorities in its faculty by
placing added emphasis on af
firmative action recruitment and
urging undergraduates to con
sider doctoral programs, accord
ing to University administrators.
Acting University President
James Rosse presented an affirm
ative action report to the Faculty
Senate Jan. 22 which outlined the
University's progress in the
recruitment of women and
minority faculty and its goals for
the near future.
Rosse reported that women
make up 10.3 percent of the Uni
versity faculty, while blacks,
Chicanos and Native Americans
comprise 7.3 percent. These fig
ures are up from 1971 statistics of
4.3 percent women and 3.7 per
cent minorities.
Rosse said that while these
numbers are comparable to per
centages at other universities.

Stanford hopes to improve them
soon.
Elizabeth Traugott. dean of
Graduate Studies, said the num
bers of women and minorities en
tering graduate programs haven't
risen notably in recent years. "In
essence, we've been in a steady
state," she said. "The numbers of
women and minorities increased
in the early '70s, but have quit
rising."
She said Stanford graduate de
partments attempt to reach out to
as many students as possible by
designating associate deans to act
as representatives to recruit
talented students from the three
main minority groups — black,
American Indian and Chicano —
to tell students about the Univer
sity's graduate programs.
The University has begun long
range efforts to lure minority stu
dents from this generation of un
dergraduates into academic fields
in order to fill the next generation
of teaching positions, according
