# Sex ed at Stanford: unlike Dr. Ruth
## 
### KATHY LACHENAUER 
Sex attracts. Or so it has
been proven this quarter by the
popularity of the Human Biol
ogy Department's course in
human sexuality.
Every Monday, Wednesday
and Friday at 2:15 more than
400 Stanford undergraduates
enrolled in Human Biology 10
cram into Annenberg
Auditorium. All of Annenberg's
seats are taken and even the
aisles are filled with listeners
anxiously awaiting Human Bi
ology Prof. Herant Katchadour
ian.

Katchadourian, one time
dean and vice provost for Un
dergradute Education, has
taught Human Sexuality 16
times to more than 10,000
Stanford students.
"I think he educates in a way
that Dr. Ruth can't," sopho
more Tamar Dorfman says.
Senior Val Valdez took the
course last years and still re
members him as "an awesome
teacher."
Despite such compliments,
Katchadourian said he ad
mitted to having felt ap
prehensive when, in 1966, Stan
ford administrators first ap
proached him about teaching a
class on sex.
"I don't know anything about
it." was Katchadourian's Initial
response to the course. But ac
cording to Katchadourian, col
leagues jokingly reassured him
that "ignorance of a subject has
never stopped a professor from
teaching before."
Katchadourian. who is also a
professor of psychiatry, has done
extensive reading in order to un
derstand the medical aspects of
human sexuality.
He first taught the course in
1968 and 50 students enrolled.
Word spread through the Stanford
grapevine quickly. By the next
year, class enrollment Increased to
400. and in 1972 about 1,000
people were taking the class.
The course is based on lectures
covering everything from sexual
stimulation to prostitution. As
signed readings come from Katch
adourian's own book, "Fun
damentals of Human Sexuality."
Katchadourian stresses the Im
portance of reading the text to un
derstand course material and
says,"the book is the pedestal for
the lectures."
According to Katchadourian.
his class is an Integrated course
studying the biological, behavioral
and cultural aspects of human
sexuality.
He says he sees his role as an ed
ucator to be three-fold. First,
Katchadourian compares to a fun
nel the way he condenses informa
tion and passes it on to students.
He also says he thinks of himself
as a filter which must judge and
select the most valuable informa
tion.
Thirdly, Katchadourian says his
role as a teacher is like a waiter in
a restaurant, and it is up to the
students to eat.
Valdez, a senior majoring in
sociology, has taken full advan
tage of Katchadourian's waiter
philosophy. She remembers a
class where a panel of
transvestites discussed roles and
concepts completely new to her.
From this discussion Valdez says

she has learned to be more open
minded and has applied this
thinking to her other sociology
classes.
Katchadourian says he hopes
that students will leave his class
better educated than their family
physicians in the area of human
sexuality.
To reach this goal, Katchadour
ian makes himself easily accessi
ble. He remains after class to talk
to baffled students. He is also
more than willing to schedule ap
pointments for students who
want to talk to him alone.
In past years, Katchadourian
tried to arrange weekly group
gatherings where students could
discuss course issues in greater
depth. But people did not show.
"Coming to lectures is as far as
most want to go because the dis
cussions are too personal," Katch
adourian says.
Sometimes, even the air in An
nenberg can be cut with a knife
when explicit films of genital func
tions and slides of male and
female anatomy are shown. But
Katchadourian's wit usually
relieves the tension.
"He makes it comfortable for
people who might be embarrassed
in the class," sophomore Dave
Huchton says.
Agreeing with Huchton's state
ment, sophomore Kevin Stein
says he believes that Katchadour
ian's humor "points out that sex

is something we shouldn't be up
tight about."
Katchadourian says that he
"deliberately uses humor to put
people at ease." He also employs
wit as an educational tool for en
hancing certain concepts.
For example, "the vagina is not
a shoe" is one comical phrase
which Katchadourian used to help
students visualize the vagina's
flexibility and to dispel concerns
about genital size and fit.
Besides humor, Katchadourian
also tries to use discretion in his
lectures. When preparing lectures,
he often thinks of his daughter in
college and his 16-year-old son.
According to Katchadourian, he
judges the content of his lectures
by thinking, "would I say that if
my children were in the room?"
Katchadourian, an Armenian
who grew up in the Middle East,
admits that he was sexually ignor
ant when he was the age of his
children.
According to Katchadourian,
the society he lived in avoided
open discussions on human
sexuality. Even now, when he
sends copies of his textbook to his
Armenian relatives, they never
respond.
But Katchadourian's philoso
phy is far different from his ances
tors. He wants all his students to
approach his class openly and to
be able to say "I am human â€”
nothing human is alien to me."
