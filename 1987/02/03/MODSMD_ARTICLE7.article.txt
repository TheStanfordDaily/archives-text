### SUHA JHAVERI 
The ASSU has formed a Student
Health Advisory, Review and Eval
uation Committee (SHARE) to
evaluate and improve Cowell Stu
dent Health Center services, ac
cording to Council of Presidents
(COP) member Mary Thurber.
Thurber formed the committee
this quarter in reaction to student
complaints about health services
at Cowell.
"I wanted to know if it was the
culture of this University to com
plain or if there was really some

thing wrong with Cowell's
services," said Thurber. "If people
have complaints, they should act
upon them in committees like
SHARE. The more students, the
better it will be." she added.
Dr. Paul Walters, director of
Cowell, is pleased with the stu
dent committee. "We've been
trying to get one started for years,"
said Walters. "I'm really positive
about this."
Lou Shaw, a nurse in the out
patient department of Cowell and
staff liaison for SHARE, said she
thinks the committee will be bene
ficial to Cowell.
"1 think there are going to be
some changes made at Cowell,
and I think they'll be for the best,"
she said.

Thurber pointed out that
SHARE already has completed
several projects. After every visit to
Cowell, students fill out evalua
tion surveys, which are then
reviewed by SHARE. Also, a bulle
tin board containing biographies
and pictures of Cowell staff has
been set up in the waiting room.
Shaw said that SHARE is
working with Cowell on plans to

open a pharmacy when the health
center is renovated sometime in
the next few years. She added that
student support will make the
project much easier to pursue.
Thurber said future projects
might include publishing a new,
more aesthetically pleasing hand
book describing Cowell services,
as well as placing in the waiting
room a computer listing available
health information.
