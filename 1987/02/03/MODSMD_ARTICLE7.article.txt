### SUHA JHAVERI 
The ASSU has formed a Student
Health Advisory, Review and Eval
uation Committee (SHARE) to
evaluate and improve Cowell Stu
dent Health Center services, ac
cording to Council of Presidents
(COP) member Mary Thurber.
Thurber formed the committee
this quarter in reaction to student
complaints about health services
at Cowell.
"I wanted to know if it was the
culture of this University to com
plain or if there was really some

thing wrong with Cowell's
services," said Thurber. "If people
have complaints, they should act
upon them in committees like
SHARE. The more students, the
better it will be." she added.
Dr. Paul Walters, director of
Cowell, is pleased with the stu
dent committee. "We've been
trying to get one started for years,"
said Walters. "I'm really positive
about this."
