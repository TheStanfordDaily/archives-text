# Misery amid affluence: Homelessness in Palo Alto
## High cost of housing causes grim outlook in an area enjoying relative economic prosperity 
### MONICA SIMMS 
Even in Palo Alto, one of the most affluent cities in
California, homelessness is a problem. Palo Alto
housing officials warn that the problem could reach
crisis proportions if the city does not receive addi
tional federal and private funding.
Hundreds of homeless people live in Palo Alto and
the homeless population has been increasing in
recent years, according to city officials.
The figure for the rest of the county also has been
increasing. At a Dec. 19 press conference. San Jose
Mayor Tom McEnery told reporters that, based on a
preliminary survey, more than 11.000 homeless live
in Santa Clara County — nearly double last year's fig
ure.
Palo Alto's homeless are a diverse group. Some are

old; some are young. Some were once professionals
who have dropped out of the job market. Some are
single; others are members of vagrant families.
Many homeless wander the streets and loiter in
local restaurants. Some sleep on sidewalks or in
parked cars. Others sleep on tattered mattresses
strewn across the banks of the San Francisquito
Creek, located just within walking distance of the
Stanford Shopping Center.
A homeless person who requested anonymity said
she once studied economics at Stanford. After a se
ries of psychological and financial crises, she became
homeless. Sitting in the Coffee House, she said,
"Students here take for granted that they will always
be taken care of. And they will.
"It's different when you're on the street with no
protection. I know because . . . I've been unemployed

and I've had no place to go. Let me tell you. it makes
you feel very ugly," she said.
Since Palo Alto enjoys a relatively low rate of un
employment and a healthy economic outlook, some
find it hard to believe that homelessness is a prob
lem.
Palo Alto, with an unemployment rate of only 3.3
percent, has one the lowest rates of unemployment
in the county — which itself is low at 5.4 percent -
according to the most recent figures provided by the
California Employment Development Department
and the Council of Economic Advisors. The state
average is 6.5 percent and the national average is 6.8
percent.
Palo Alto's employment picture will continue to im
prove in the coming years, according to the Associa
tion of Bay Area Governments' 1985 piojections.

Some city officials are optimistic that this may mean
a simultaneous improvement in the problem of the
city's homeless.
However, according to Barry Del Buono, executive
director of the Emergency Housing Consortium in
San Jose, homelessness in Palo Alto is tied to the
high cost of housing, not the rate of unemployment.
"Palo Alto's poor are equivalent to the poor of other
cities," he said. "But here, they're homeless because
they simply can't afford the rent."
According to the Santa Clara County Economic
Futures Committee's 1984 report, the cost of
housing in Santa Clara County is among the highest
in the nation. The average monthly rent in Palo Alto
is approximately *600 a month, nearly the highest in
the county, according to figures
extrapolated from the most recent
census data.
Low-cost housing programs to
aid the city's homeless are scarce
and those that do exist are ham
pered by Inadequate federal and
private funding.
Sylvia Seman. executive direc
tor of the Palo Alto Housing Corpo
ration. said there are no rent con
trol programs in Palo Alto, and
that all waiting lists for subsidized
housing in the city are closed in
definitely.
There are presently about
16.000 people on the county's
waiting list for subsidized
housing, according to Irma Ayala,
a housing program specialist for
the Santa Clara County Housing
Authority. Ayala said that if the
county receives more federal fund
ing from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), more subsidized housing
will become available. She noted,
however, that most applicants will
probably remain on the list for at
least several years.
"There just isn't enough
[subsidized housing) to go
around." she said.
According to Margo Dutton, ad
ministrator of Human Services for
the city. Palo Alto has been over
looked for aid by both the govern
ment and the private sector be
cause of a perceived lack of need.
"There is a greater need for aid
in southern and mid-Santa Clara
County, so that's where most of

the aid goes. But there are poor
here, and we do need the aid."
Dutton said.
The Urban Ministry. Palo Alto's
only shelter for the homeless, has
been been struggling for the past
several months to find a perman
ent home.
Directed since 1984 by Rev. Lee
Schmitt. the shelter originally was
located in the rear of All Saint's
Episcopal Church. But last year,
the number of homeless aided by
the shelter grew so rapidly that
the facility outgrew the church
and was asked to relocate.
However, because the board of
directors of the Urban Ministry
could not find an affordable build
ing in which to relocate, the shel
ter began operating out of
Schmitt's home.
As a result of the relocation.
Schmitt said the Urban Ministry
had to "abbreviate" its activities,
such as worship and counseling
services and day care hours.
Burklo, the shelter's director
since Jan. 1. said the shelter has
had difficulty finding a new loca
tion in part because of financial
constraints and in part because of
local resistance to the shelter.
"It's difficult to find a place for
this kind of operation. We need a
special kind of facility that is ac
cessible to the homeless, yet in a
good location where neighbors
won't be unhappy with it." Burklo
said.
"If it were an easy thing for the
city to accept," he added, "there
would probably be a facility by
now. But Palo Alto hasn't accepted
the fact that this is an urban place
with urban problems."
Burklo said the Urban Ministry
is still seeking a new location.

There are other shelters in
neighboring cities, but most face
similar problems, such as inade
quate space and facilities.
In Menlo Park, the Mid-
Peninsula Family Living Center
serves homeless families by pro
viding emergency housing for up
to 28 days. According to Assistant
Coordinator Susan Gerioar, the
shelter can only house up to 15
families.
"We turn away as many as 50
percent of qualified applicants."
Genoar said. "There definitely is
not enough room here to meet the
needs of the homeless."
Del Buono said singles who are
homeless have a particularly hard
time finding housing in this area
because many of the local shelters,
like the Living Center, are geared
to families.
He said some of the area s single
homeless are veterans, former
mental institution patients and
drug or alcohol addicts.
"It's a travesty that there are so
few programs for singles in Palo
Alto." Del Buono said, "but few
people around here want someone
'fresh out of the tank' as their
neighbor.
Homelessness will worsen here
in the next few years unless Palo
Alto receives additional federal or
private funding, Del Buono and
Dutton said.
"If the Urban Ministry doesn't
find a location, if we don't see
more cooperative short and long
term programs, and if we do noth
ing to remedy this problem, home
lessness will continue to get worse
here," Dutton said.
"Frankly. I don't see more
money on the horizon."

and the Council of Economic Advisors. The state
average is 6.5 percent and the national average is 6.8
percent.
Palo Alto's employment picture will continue to im
prove in the coming years, according to the Associa
tion of Bay Area Governments' 1985 piojections.

Some city officials are optimistic that this may mean
a simultaneous improvement in the problem of the
city's homeless.
However, according to Barry Del Buono, executive
director of the Emergency Housing Consortium in
San Jose, homelessness in Palo Alto is tied to the
high cost of housing, not the rate of unemployment.
"Palo Alto's poor are equivalent to the poor of other
cities," he said. "But here, they're homeless because
they simply can't afford the rent."
According to the Santa Clara County Economic
Futures Committee's 1984 report, the cost of
housing in Santa Clara County is among the highest
in the nation. The average monthly rent in Palo Alto
is approximately *600 a month, nearly the highest in
the county, according to figures
extrapolated from the most recent
census data.
Low-cost housing programs to
aid the city's homeless are scarce
and those that do exist are ham
pered by Inadequate federal and
private funding.
Sylvia Seman. executive direc
tor of the Palo Alto Housing Corpo
ration. said there are no rent con
trol programs in Palo Alto, and
that all waiting lists for subsidized
housing in the city are closed in
definitely.
There are presently about
16.000 people on the county's
waiting list for subsidized
housing, according to Irma Ayala,
a housing program specialist for
the Santa Clara County Housing
Authority. Ayala said that if the
county receives more federal fund
ing from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), more subsidized housing
will become available. She noted,
however, that most applicants will
probably remain on the list for at
least several years.
"There just isn't enough
[subsidized housing) to go
around." she said.
According to Margo Dutton, ad
ministrator of Human Services for
the city. Palo Alto has been over
looked for aid by both the govern
ment and the private sector be
cause of a perceived lack of need.
"There is a greater need for aid
in southern and mid-Santa Clara
County, so that's where most of

the aid goes. But there are poor
here, and we do need the aid."
Dutton said.
The Urban Ministry. Palo Alto's
only shelter for the homeless, has
been been struggling for the past
several months to find a perman
ent home.
Directed since 1984 by Rev. Lee
Schmitt. the shelter originally was
located in the rear of All Saint's
Episcopal Church. But last year,
the number of homeless aided by
the shelter grew so rapidly that
the facility outgrew the church
and was asked to relocate.
However, because the board of
directors of the Urban Ministry
could not find an affordable build
ing in which to relocate, the shel
ter began operating out of
Schmitt's home.
As a result of the relocation.
Schmitt said the Urban Ministry
had to "abbreviate" its activities,
such as worship and counseling
services and day care hours.
Burklo, the shelter's director
since Jan. 1. said the shelter has
had difficulty finding a new loca
tion in part because of financial
constraints and in part because of
local resistance to the shelter.
"It's difficult to find a place for
this kind of operation. We need a
special kind of facility that is ac
cessible to the homeless, yet in a
good location where neighbors
won't be unhappy with it." Burklo
said.
"If it were an easy thing for the
city to accept," he added, "there
would probably be a facility by
now. But Palo Alto hasn't accepted
the fact that this is an urban place
with urban problems."
Burklo said the Urban Ministry
is still seeking a new location.

There are other shelters in
neighboring cities, but most face
similar problems, such as inade
quate space and facilities.
In Menlo Park, the Mid-
Peninsula Family Living Center
serves homeless families by pro
viding emergency housing for up
to 28 days. According to Assistant
Coordinator Susan Gerioar, the
shelter can only house up to 15
families.
"We turn away as many as 50
percent of qualified applicants."
Genoar said. "There definitely is
not enough room here to meet the
needs of the homeless."
Del Buono said singles who are
homeless have a particularly hard
time finding housing in this area
because many of the local shelters,
like the Living Center, are geared
to families.
He said some of the area s single
homeless are veterans, former
mental institution patients and
drug or alcohol addicts.
"It's a travesty that there are so
few programs for singles in Palo
Alto." Del Buono said, "but few
people around here want someone
'fresh out of the tank' as their
neighbor.
Homelessness will worsen here
in the next few years unless Palo
Alto receives additional federal or
private funding, Del Buono and
Dutton said.
"If the Urban Ministry doesn't
find a location, if we don't see
more cooperative short and long
term programs, and if we do noth
ing to remedy this problem, home
lessness will continue to get worse
here," Dutton said.
"Frankly. I don't see more
money on the horizon."
Even in Palo Alto, one of the most affluent cities in
California, homelessness is a problem. Palo Alto
housing officials warn that the problem could reach
crisis proportions if the city does not receive addi
tional federal and private funding.
Hundreds of homeless people live in Palo Alto and
the homeless population has been increasing in
recent years, according to city officials.
The figure for the rest of the county also has been
increasing. At a Dec. 19 press conference. San Jose
Mayor Tom McEnery told reporters that, based on a
preliminary survey, more than 11.000 homeless live
in Santa Clara County — nearly double last year's fig
ure.
Palo Alto's homeless are a diverse group. Some are

old; some are young. Some were once professionals
who have dropped out of the job market. Some are
single; others are members of vagrant families.
Many homeless wander the streets and loiter in
local restaurants. Some sleep on sidewalks or in
parked cars. Others sleep on tattered mattresses
strewn across the banks of the San Francisquito
Creek, located just within walking distance of the
Stanford Shopping Center.
A homeless person who requested anonymity said
she once studied economics at Stanford. After a se
ries of psychological and financial crises, she became
homeless. Sitting in the Coffee House, she said,
"Students here take for granted that they will always
be taken care of. And they will.
"It's different when you're on the street with no
protection. I know because . . . I've been unemployed

and I've had no place to go. Let me tell you. it makes
you feel very ugly," she said.
Since Palo Alto enjoys a relatively low rate of un
employment and a healthy economic outlook, some
find it hard to believe that homelessness is a prob
lem.
Palo Alto, with an unemployment rate of only 3.3
percent, has one the lowest rates of unemployment
in the county — which itself is low at 5.4 percent -
according to the most recent figures provided by the
California Employment Development Department
and the Council of Economic Advisors. The state
average is 6.5 percent and the national average is 6.8
percent.
