# Misery amid affluence: Homelessness in Palo Alto
## High cost of housing causes grim outlook in an area enjoying relative economic prosperity 
### MONICA SIMMS 
Even in Palo Alto, one of the most affluent cities in
California, homelessness is a problem. Palo Alto
housing officials warn that the problem could reach
crisis proportions if the city does not receive addi
tional federal and private funding.
Hundreds of homeless people live in Palo Alto and
the homeless population has been increasing in
recent years, according to city officials.
The figure for the rest of the county also has been
increasing. At a Dec. 19 press conference. San Jose
Mayor Tom McEnery told reporters that, based on a
preliminary survey, more than 11.000 homeless live
in Santa Clara County — nearly double last year's fig
ure.
Palo Alto's homeless are a diverse group. Some are

old; some are young. Some were once professionals
who have dropped out of the job market. Some are
single; others are members of vagrant families.
Many homeless wander the streets and loiter in
local restaurants. Some sleep on sidewalks or in
parked cars. Others sleep on tattered mattresses
strewn across the banks of the San Francisquito
Creek, located just within walking distance of the
Stanford Shopping Center.
A homeless person who requested anonymity said
she once studied economics at Stanford. After a se
ries of psychological and financial crises, she became
homeless. Sitting in the Coffee House, she said,
"Students here take for granted that they will always
be taken care of. And they will.
"It's different when you're on the street with no
protection. I know because . . . I've been unemployed

and I've had no place to go. Let me tell you. it makes
you feel very ugly," she said.
Since Palo Alto enjoys a relatively low rate of un
employment and a healthy economic outlook, some
find it hard to believe that homelessness is a prob
lem.
Palo Alto, with an unemployment rate of only 3.3
percent, has one the lowest rates of unemployment
in the county — which itself is low at 5.4 percent -
according to the most recent figures provided by the
California Employment Development Department
and the Council of Economic Advisors. The state
average is 6.5 percent and the national average is 6.8
percent.
Palo Alto's employment picture will continue to im
prove in the coming years, according to the Associa
tion of Bay Area Governments' 1985 piojections.

Some city officials are optimistic that this may mean
a simultaneous improvement in the problem of the
city's homeless.
However, according to Barry Del Buono, executive
director of the Emergency Housing Consortium in
San Jose, homelessness in Palo Alto is tied to the
high cost of housing, not the rate of unemployment.
"Palo Alto's poor are equivalent to the poor of other
cities," he said. "But here, they're homeless because
they simply can't afford the rent."
According to the Santa Clara County Economic
Futures Committee's 1984 report, the cost of
housing in Santa Clara County is among the highest
in the nation. The average monthly rent in Palo Alto
is approximately *600 a month, nearly the highest in
