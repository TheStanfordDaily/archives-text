# Profs assail Reagan ties

### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Partisan political activity by members of the
Hoover Institution and the impending construction
of the Reagan Library here has established a Stan
ford/Hoover/Reagan connection that could damage
the University's reputation as an independent aca
demic institution, according to Stanford scholars.
In an open letter sent today to nearly 250 faculty
members, Political Science Prof. John Manley and
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz warned that the es
tablishment of the Reagan Library here and the
Hoover Institution's admittedly close ties to the
Reagan administration could contribute to a public
perception that Stanford is "an institution that is al
lowing itself to be used by well-financed, partisan in
terests."
The letter cited as direct evidence of its claims a
quote by Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell,who is
on sabbatical, In the 1986 Hoover Annual Report
stating that Stanford can "boast" of its "Reagan con
nection."
Acting Director John Cogan and other scholars at
the Hoover Institution did not return phone calls yes
terday.
The letter, latest of numerous attacks on the rela
tionship between Stanford, Hoover and the Reagan
administration, is not a matter of political partisan
ship, according to Manley.
"The issue is not that Hoover is (politically) conser
vative, liberal or middle-of-the road," he said. Rather,
it is inappropriate for any organ of the University to
engage in blatantly partisan political activities be
cause any such activities could jeopardize the Uni
versity's reputation for academic Integrity, he said.
The letter criticized what its authors perceived to
be reluctance on the part of the University Adminis
tration to address this issue and claimed that past
petition drives in support of an Investigation Into the
Hoover Institution's political activities have been
minimized or Ignored by the Administration.
"Stanford has in its midst a major problem which
(University President) Donald Kennedy is choosing
to Ignore," Manley said.
He added that potential donors to the Centennial
Campaign should voice concern about the
Hoover/Stanford/Reagan connection. "I advocate
that people ask questions, and
that people get answers." he said.
Acting University President
James Rosse declined to comment
yesterday.
An evaluation of the Hoover In
stitution's political activity and its
relationship with Stanford could
revive debate over a possible insti
tutional "divorce" of Stanford and
Hoover. While complex, such a
separation might be possible.
Last October, the Georgetown
Center for Strategic and Interna
tional Studies (CSIS) began a
process of separation from
Georgetown University. As noted
by Georgetown President Timothy

Healy, it was "a most amicable
parting."
The Georgetown separation
from the CSIS think tank was
motivated in part by a concern
that the two institutions draw on
the same fund-raising sources.
Ironically, fund raising may link
Stanford and Hoover together.
According to Rebholz, the Stan
ford administration may be con
cerned that a Stanford/Hoover
divorce could alienate donors,
such as Hewlett-Packard, who
currently give to both institu
tions.
Notably, a 1985 Faculty Senate
Committee charged with evaluat
ing the relationship between
Stanford and Hoover concluded
that the institution's pride In its
political influence was not "de
facto evidence of institutional par
tisanship." This finding was
disputed in the letter.
