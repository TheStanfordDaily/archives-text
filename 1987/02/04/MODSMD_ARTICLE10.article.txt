CAPE TOWN. South Africa -
Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik"
Botha warned yesterday that
South Africa's white-led minority
government would firmly resist
further American and other
foreign pressure to push it into
negotiations with its black
majority on the country's political
future.
"It is time to show the American
Congress that they will not deter
mine our future," Botha told
foreign correspondents here in
dismissing both the effects of U.S.
economic sanctions and the possi
bility of renewed foreign media
tion in this country's deepening

crisis.
"The congressional legislation
(imposing sanctions) was an
outside intrusion trying to solve
our problems, and almost any
South African will reject any at
tempt to tell us what we need to
do," Botha said. "There is a strong
anti-American feeling in this
country now . . . and in this way
the United States has become
more and more irrelevant in the
whole of southern Africa."
Describing the American legis
lators as "vengeful," "ignorant"
and "hopeless." Botha said he
blames them for much of the con
tinued civil unrest here. "Through

their sanctions, they have dis
couraged black moderates from
coming forward to negotiate." he
said, "and they have encouraged
the radicals in their violence."
Botha's declaration seemed to
end what little remained of the
Reagan administration's policy of
"constructive engagement."
which was based on U.S. efforts to
persuade the South African gov
ernment to speed the dismantling
of apartheid and engage in discus
sions that would bring a
"government based on the con
sent of the governed."
Opening the annual session of
Parliament here last week. Presi

dent Pieter Botha, who Is not
related to the foreign minister,
said that his government was
reviewing "both the content and
direction" of its foreign policy, in
dicating that significant changes
are likely.
"No foreign nation, nor the
United Nations or any other inter
national organization has the
slightest right whatsoever to
meddle in our domestic affairs."
the president declared. "It is a
principle of international law and
conduct that no self-respecting,
sovereign country should be sub
servient to any other."
