# Buchanan resigns to work on '88 race
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Patrick Buchanan, the
combative, conservative White House director
of communications, resigned yesterday, be
cause he believes he can better influence the
direction of the conservative movement and
the 1988 presidential campaign from outside
the Reagan administration. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced.
Buchanan's resignation, effective March 1,
was expected. It was tendered two weeks to the
day after he ended his brief flirtation with run
ning for the 1988 Republican presidential
nomination because he feared it would split
conservative support for Rep. Jack Kemp (R-
N.Y.)
He took the *77,400-a-year White House job
on Feb. 5, 1985, temporarily forsaking a career

as newspaper columnist and radio commenta
tor that reportedly earned him >400,000 a
year. He is expected to resume these activities
and possibly help Kemp's becalmed campaign,
according to Republican political profes
sionals.
In a statement. Reagan said. "Pat's commu
nications skills and his commitment to con
servative political beliefs have been an impor
tant part of my administration for the last two
years. I will miss his leadership and his sup
port but I count on his voice to remain a bea
con for our political agenda."
Fitzwater cited Buchanan as believing that
this is a "natural break-point" to make way for
a successor to serve out the last two years of
Reagan's presidency.

"Pat also feels he can better influence the is
sues in politics in 1988 and the direction of
the conservative movement and Republican
party by speaking and writing from a vantage
point outside the White House." Fitzwater
said.
Dennis Thomas, an aide to White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who was in
strumental in bringing Buchanan into the ad
ministration, is a leading candidate to replace
him, Fitzwater said.
Buchanan, 48, wanted to be U.S. ambassa
dor to NATO but was thwarted by Secretary of
State George Shultz. He also appeared
frustrated at times in his attempt to persuade
Reagan and the administration to follow a
harder conservative line. Washington Post
