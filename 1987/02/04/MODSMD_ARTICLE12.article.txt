# Vote strengthens Aquino's position

MANILA, Philippines — Presi
dent Corazon Aquino's resound
ing victory in Monday's
nationwide plebiscite strengthens
her hand in battling an array of
problems, from a crushing foreign
debt to a persistent Communist
insurgency, in the view of govern
, ment officials and other analysts.
On the economic front. Finance
Minister Jaime Ongpin said Tues
day that the overwhelming public
approval of Aquino's new consti
tution "should strengthen our po
sition in negotiating with the
(international) banks" by provid

ing "incontrovertible proof that
this government has the support
of the vast majority of the people."
Ongpin said stalled talks on debt
rescheduling with creditor banks
will resume Feb. 23.
Domestically, the lopsided "yes"
vote for the Aquino constitution
has, for the moment at least,
neutralized her critics on both the
far left and the far right, who yes
terday were lining up to endorse
the results of the voting.
"I would certainly respect and
abide by the will of the people,"

said former Sen. Arturo Tolen
tino, leader of the old KBL political
party of ex-President Ferdinand
Marcos.
The only question mark was the
reaction of the Communists, who
broke off peace talks with the gov
ernment last week and who are
still technically observing a cease
fire that is scheduled to lapse Sun
day.
Some analysts and government
officials said Monday's vote — an
unprecedented triumph for
pluralistic, participatory demo

cracy here — may force the Com
munists to reassess and revise
their strategy of attacking a presi
dent who has just demonstrated
her continued popularity. The
massive size of the vote — at least
75 percent in favor of the Aquino
constitution — and the record
high turnout leave the Commu
nists in much the same state of
disarray they faced last February
after Aquino became president fol
lowing an election the left had
boycotted and a civilian/military
uprising it had ignored.
