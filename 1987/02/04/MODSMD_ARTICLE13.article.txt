### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
At a memorial service yesterday. University
administrators and colleagues praised Dean of
Earth Sciences Allan Cox, who died last Tues
day, as an academic leader, talented scientist
and caring friend. More than 600 people atten
ded the service in Memorial Church.
Cox. 60. died when he crashed into a tree
while bicycling. San Mateo County police say
he may have committed suicide over pending
child molestation charges filed in Washington
state.
"Reverence of nature, love of the land,
respect for people — all were qualities that
stood out in Allan." said University President
Donald Kennedy, who is on sabbatical this
quarter.
Relating anecdotes of his experiences with
Cox. Kennedy recalled the time when he and
Cox sang a duet in front of graduating seniors
and corporate sponsors. "I learned that he
couldn't carry a tune any better than me," Ken
nedy said.

When Cox. as a resident fellow in Wilbur, de
signed a lighting system for a student theater,
"he proved to be a master of leadership without
seeming to lead." Kennedy said.
"We loved him. we trusted him — we still do.
Most of all. we wish he were here so we could
show it,"he said.
Acting University President' James Rosse,
George Thompson, professor of geophysics,
and Albert Hastorf. professor of psychology,
also spoke in honor of Cox.
Rosse remembered Cox as an academic
leader and "a caring friend always wil'tng to
share my burden."
"1 don't believe he was capable of doing any
thing that could hurt another human being,"
he said.
Rosse also related Cox's talent as an aca
demic leader who "brought a special blend of
imagination and insight to each problem" and
who showed that "caring qualities are the only
proper basis for academic leadership."
Cox gave people the inspiration and knowl
edge that enables them to work toward a better
future, Thompson said, emphasizing Cox's

"determination to bring out the very best In
others."
Thompson characterized Cox as a man who
mixed humility with demanding standards.
Because Cox had such high standards, a com
pliment from him meant a great deal, he said.
To Hastorf. Cox was a "smart, sensitive and
loyal friend — a decent and thoughtful man."
Students "have lost a mentor in every sense
of the word." Hastorf said. "Geophysicists have
lost an extraordinarily creative scientific col
league."
Both Thompson and Hastorf discussed
Cox's scientific achievements. Cox. a leading
expert on plate tectonics, proved that the
earth's entire magnetic field has reversed Itself
a number of times throughout history. He was
a member of the National Academy of Sciences
and received the Vetlesen Prize, the highest
honor awarded in the earth sciences field.
Thompson said he hopes people will
"remember Allan's long-range inspiration and
look forward energetically to the tasks ahead."
Cox had intended to resign from the dean
ship at the end of this academic year and
return to teaching and research.
