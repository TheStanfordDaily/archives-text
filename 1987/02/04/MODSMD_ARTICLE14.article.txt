## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Sex and advertising 
### 
On Jan. 15, KRON-TV in San Francisco
did what only a few other television stations
in major markets have dared to do: It in
stituted a policy of accepting manufacturer's
commercials advertising condoms. Hope
fully, KRON's bold move will be imitated by
television and radio stations across the
country. Public health considerations
demand that the media stop ignoring the
existence of condoms.
In the past, television stations have
banned condom advertisements from the
airwaves, fearing their presence would
produce a negative reaction in the commu
nity and charges from conservative groups
that they were promoting promiscuity. In
light of the fact that television uses sexuality
to sell everything from used cars to furniture
polish, its anti-condom policy was always
hypocritical and wrong. Today, the added
dangers of AIDS and other sexually transmit
ted disease make a media ban on advertising
condoms morally unconscionable.
Dr. Tom Quin of the National Institutes for
Health recently told a Stanford audience that

AIDS is reaching such epidemic proportions,
that an estimated 56,000 people will die of
the illness in 1991 â€” more than the number
of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. The
disease will soon become the leading cause of
death among sexually active people between
the ages of 15 and 40. Herpes and chlymidia,
too, are spreading at an alarming rate,
making us all but forget about the existence
of gonorrhea and syphilis.
The Surgeon General has determined that
condoms offer the best protection available
against the transmission of these diseases.
The media has a responsibility to its audi
ence to spread this message.
The Stanford community is inundated
with information about STDs and how to
avoid their transmission; sources range from
Cowell Student Health Center publications
to speeches around campus. Most Americans
do not live in academic communities and do
not have similar sources. They generally look
to the media for education and information.
The media must respond to prevent unneces
sary deaths and the spread of disease.
