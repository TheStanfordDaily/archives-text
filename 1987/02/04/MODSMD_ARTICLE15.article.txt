Constitution
review needed
It was disappointing to see The
Daily scoff at President Reagan's
references to the Constitution in
his State of the Union Address
(Daily, Jan. 28). According to the
editorial, the nation was waiting
"for a new direction to work
toward and new cause for op
timism," but instead received "a
reiteration and a child's version
of the Constitution, for the little
folks in the audience."
Unfortunately, those "little
folks" to whom the editorial refers
are not as little as you think, for
Americans as a whole know
frighteningly little about the sys
tem of government under which
they live.
As President Reagan said in his
address, the miracle of the U.S.
Constitution is that it is based on
the idea of popular sovereignty,
not government dominance. Yet
popular sovereignty becomes a
hollow phrase when the people
have little conception of what
they are sovereign over. The dan
ger comes not when a president
fails to provide "a new cause for
optimism," as the editorial sug
gests, but when the people abdi
cate power to the government out
of ignorance. Perhaps it is time to

learn more about — not ask more
from — this great document.
To some Americans, especially
to Stanford students, a reitera
tion of Constitutional principles
may seem elementary. But such a
review is essential to the per
petuation of our system of
popular government, and it is
only fitting that the President of
the United States should work
toward this goal in his annual
address to the nation.

Cox coverage
unfortunate
8; W y A v VV
A recent article concerning the
death of Allan Cox, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences. (Daily,
Jan. 30) was based, for the most
part, on an Interview with Mike
Dirickson, a detective for the San
Mateo County Sheriffs Depart
ment. Readers should be aware
(as apparently The Daily was not)
that Dirickson is not, in fact, in
charge of determining whether
Cox's death was a suicide (a mat
ter to be decided by the county
coroner's office). Nor is he in
charge of investigating the bicycle
accident that caused Cox's death
(a matter that falls under the

jurisdiction of the California
Highway Patrol). And Dirlckson Is
one person, despite The Dally
headline that read "Officials say
Cox's death was a suicide."
It's unfortunate that The Dally
didn't bother to speak to anyone
In the School of Earth Sciences;
the building is only 30 seconds
away by foot from The Daily of
fice. We could have given them a
different picture. We all knew
Allan Cox. He was a brilliant
scientist. He was also a warm and
gentle person. It's hard to express
how strongly we all admired him,
and how shocked we were at the
news of his sudden and unex
pected death.
And after his death came the
allegations. These allegations are
still under investigation, but itjis
clear that the evidence that Co*
committed suicide is rather
shaky, despite the "official" state
ments The Daily chose to print.
As for the charges of child
molestation, we should point out
that life is more complicated than
you might think from reading the
newspapers, and this case is
probably no exception. And be
cause Cox is no longer here to
dispute them, the allegations will
never, unfortunately, be dis
proven in a court of law.
