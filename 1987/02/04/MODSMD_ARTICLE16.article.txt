# Fire alarm temptation
## 
### 
Monday morning at 6:45, I was roused from a state
of deep sleep by a piercing, rasping, bleating sound.
At first, I fumbled with my alarm, bashing it several
times into the wall. As the noise continued. I
gradually realized that the sound was coming from
outside my room. I was not the only one so rudely
awakened. My entire house greeted the new day with
curses on their lips while our fire alarm droned in
the halls. The sound was particularly painful since it
was a holiday, and not a soul had a class to attend.

Fire alarms in general seem like a bad idea to me.
They just hang on the wall waiting to be pulled. It's
the only thing they know how to do. Their statement
of purpose on grad school applications would read: "1
want people to set me off." It's an open invitation. I
myself have walked by one and heard it whisper hyp
notically. "Pull me. pull me." They are hard to resist.
Anonymously, anyone can walk up to one. pull it.
and force 50 to 100 people to stop whatever they're
doing and stand on a small red dot in the parking lot.
That sort of power is extraordinary. As we all
shivered in the gray morning light last Monday,
someone remarked that he had heard of alarms that
squirted ink when they were pulled. This stopped
pranks. Someone beside me muttered that a large,
cocked handgun inside alarm boxes would also be a
sufficient deterrent. Some people have no sense of
humor in the morning.
Fire alarms, especially those pulled at 6:45 a.m..
do allow some intriguing social commentary. Whole
psychological studies could be centered around
them. RAs. for example, live for fire alarms. It's one of
the few times they get to use their awesome power
and take control. Of course, it is hard for them to
look responsible standing outside in pajamas, but
they're picked for those special qualities that set
them apart from the rest of us. Sensible people
ignore fire alarms, but because it was such a strange
hour for an alarm to be pulled, most of the students
actually got up and left their rooms. The ones that
didn't had most likely passed out with pillows stuffed
in their ears. No one had bothered to take anything
of value with them, but about half the people in the
crowd made sure that they had their keys. I was im
pressed with this reasoning. These people could have

gotten back into their rooms after the building had
burned down.
A few of my housemates took the time to put on
shoes and coats. Others, responding more quickly to
the emergency, simply dashed outside. At least one
person was only wearing a towel. When the firemen
arrived, wearing thick warm, rubber coats and
boots, they made sure we stood on our little red spot
until they checked every corner of the house for
sparks. Fortunately, the paramedics appeared on the
scene just in time to help my friend in the towel, who
was suffering from the first stages of frostbite. They
took him to Cowell, where he was assured that he
had neither strep throat nor mono. I heard firemen
snickering when they finally let us back inside. To
their credit, they did find a fire, but since it was in
the fireplace they had at first overlooked it.
I've always been curious about why people look so
awful in the morning. I asked all the physicists I
know what it is about the atomic makeup of pillows
that compels hair to stand straight up. They gave me
only vague explanations about magnetic field lines. I
look terrible in the morning. Three separate people
offered to help me down the stairs and call a doctor,
but I was not the only one in disarray. Several brand
new romances were nipped in the bud last Monday
morning.
The other extremely fascinating observation was
the number of people blinking in the morning cold
that I had never seen before. My first thought was ad
mittedly foolish. "What dedication," I said to myself.
"These Stanford students are up at the crack of dawn
to study together." Then another thought occurred
to me. Perhaps these students lived in our house and
nobody knew it. Unassigned groups had moved into
our storage closets and were just now flushed out of
their hiding places. When I went to confront one of
the Intruders. I noticed that he was holding hands
with a girl who lived down my hall. Suddenly every
thing became clear. The fire alarm had been pulled,
not by drunken students, not by vandals with a great
sense of humor, but by the Moral Majority.
It was all part of a bigger picture. As paired sets
wandered out of the house together (sleepily holding
hands and trying to remember each other's names),
undercover agents were snapping pictures and scrib
bling social security numbers. This Information
would all be sent to a computer and consulted regu
larly by religious groups and the Republican party. It
was blacklisting of the worst sort. Soon. Stanford
students at job interviews can expect to be told.
"Well, you're qualified, but we know where you spent
the night Monday. Jan. 19. 1987. Haven't you heard
about the STD chain?"
