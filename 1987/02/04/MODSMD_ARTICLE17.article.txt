# Stanford/Reagan ties?
## 
### 
W. Glenn Campbell, the director of the Hoover In
stitution, claims In the latest Hoover Annual Report
that the establishment of the Reagan Library at
Stanford creates a "Reagan connection" of which
everyone at Stanford can "boast." Acceptance of the
Reagan Library by the Stanford Trustees, the direc
tor says, represents a decision by Stanford to
"honor" the president, and talk about a
Hoover/Stanford "divorce" has "disappeared."
The Stanford administration has tried to dismiss
Campbell's comments as only one person's opinion.
Acting University President James Rosse went so far
as to tell The Dally that he did not believe Campbell
meant what he said.

We believe it is a dangerous mistake for Stanford to
ignore the truth of Campbell's remarks. The exis
tence of the Hoover Institution and the Reagan Li
brary at Stanford does establish a "Reagan connec
tion" with Stanford. Although President Reagan's
only formal connection with Stanford is through
Hoover — indeed, Edwin Meese once said the presi
dent had "zero" interest in Stanford except for
Hoover — the Hoover Institution inevitably links
Stanford with Reagan policies in the public's mind.
Through the Hoover Institution and its affiliation
with the Reagan Library, we increase the risk of
being perceived as an university that is allowing it
self to be used by well-financed, partisan interests.
No self-respecting university, let alone a great one,
should treat such matters lightly.
We have considered organizing another petition
campaign to warn of the dangers of the
Reagan/Hoover/Stanford connection, but petitions
require some faith that those in power will listen and
respond. We no longer have such faith in University
President Donald Kennedy and the Board of Trus
tees for the following reasons:
□ When 84 faculty and 1,500 students signed a
1983 petition calling for an investigation of Hoover's
political activities, Kennedy first talked about ap
pointing a distinguished visiting committee. In
stead, the board responded to the Faculty Senate's
call for an investigation by establishing the Trustee's
Committee on Hoover, whose members favored
deepening ties between Stanford and the Hoover In
stitution.
□ After months of apparent inactivity by the trus
tees, a second petition signed by 101 faculty mem
bers called for the appointment of a distinguished
and independent visiting committee on
Hoover/Stanford relations. Kennedy dismissed this
petition as a "cure in search of a disease."
□ A committee appointed by Kennedy to study ways
of developing closer relations between Stanford and
Hoover issued a report that many faculty members
thought maligned Individual faculty and depart
ments. In response, the Senate appointed the
Dornbush Committee, which raised the possibility of

a "divorce" between the two institutions. But the
Dornbush Committee exonerated Hoover of any ideo
logical bias, concluding that, "We do not believe that
Hoover s pride in its political influence is de facto
evidence of institutional partisanship."
If former members of the Dornbush Committee or
others at Stanford need more evidence of Hoover's
partisan political activities, they need look no further
than Hoover's latest report. We quote from W. Glenn
Campbell:
"It is a source of immense pride to know that the
ideas developed by scholars at the Hoover Institution
have greatly influenced the new policy agenda, and I
remain confident that historical analysis will in
creasingly recognize the key role played by these
scholars.
"It goes without saying that no one is more
qualified than the president himself to bear witness
to the fact that the scholars of the Hoover Institution
were present not only when the policy revolution of
the 1980s began, but also that their ideas played a
key role in determining the course the revolution was
to take." There follows a long quotation from Presi
dent Reagan testifying to his reliance on Hoover in
his 1980 campaign and on subsequent "policy revo
lution."
The Hoover Institution continues to boast of its
"op/ed" program and efforts to influence public
opinion. Over 550 newspapers, with a combined cir
culation of 62 million, have expressed interest in —
and are receiving — articles by Hoover scholars, the
report claims. "A major milestone was reached by the
Public Affairs Office this year," Hoover says, "as over
375 Hoover-authored essays — approximately one a
day — appeared in the editorial pages of the nation's
newspapers and magazines."
We have asked the question before, and we ask it
again. Is it proper for Stanford University to lend its
good name and support to such activities? President
Kennedy, the Board of Trustees and the Academic
Council have done nothing to stop Hoover. Indeed,
they apparently want Stanford and Hoover to draw
closer together. This is a proposition that should
concern everyone who values the independence, in
tegrity and reputation of this University.
When the controversy over Hoover's political activi
ties started, Kennedy said the problem of Hoover was
"governance," not politics. Any remaining hope for
major reforms in governance is now gone. The report
states: "A solid Indicator of progress in the relation
ship between the Hoover Institution and the rest of
the University was the assurance given by Board of
Trustees President Warren Christopher during the
Board of Overseer's Executive Committee meeting
held Jan. 21. 1986 in Washington, D.C., that the
trustees intend to abide fully by the arrangements
for governance that are specified in the 1959 agree
ment, as amended."
We call your attention to the above developments
because we still believe in the importance of an in
formed Stanford community, and because most
people here did not get the report. Please write us a
note or call if you support further action — saying
what, specifically, you would like to see done.

again. Is it proper for Stanford University to lend its

closer together. This is a proposition that should
concern everyone who values the independence, in

"governance," not politics. Any remaining hope for

W. Glenn Campbell, the director of the Hoover In
stitution, claims In the latest Hoover Annual Report
that the establishment of the Reagan Library at
Stanford creates a "Reagan connection" of which
everyone at Stanford can "boast." Acceptance of the
Reagan Library by the Stanford Trustees, the direc
tor says, represents a decision by Stanford to
"honor" the president, and talk about a
Hoover/Stanford "divorce" has "disappeared."
The Stanford administration has tried to dismiss
Campbell's comments as only one person's opinion.
Acting University President James Rosse went so far
as to tell The Dally that he did not believe Campbell
meant what he said.

We believe it is a dangerous mistake for Stanford to
ignore the truth of Campbell's remarks. The exis
tence of the Hoover Institution and the Reagan Li
brary at Stanford does establish a "Reagan connec
tion" with Stanford. Although President Reagan's
only formal connection with Stanford is through
Hoover — indeed, Edwin Meese once said the presi
dent had "zero" interest in Stanford except for
Hoover — the Hoover Institution inevitably links
Stanford with Reagan policies in the public's mind.
Through the Hoover Institution and its affiliation
with the Reagan Library, we increase the risk of
being perceived as an university that is allowing it
self to be used by well-financed, partisan interests.
No self-respecting university, let alone a great one,
should treat such matters lightly.
We have considered organizing another petition
campaign to warn of the dangers of the
Reagan/Hoover/Stanford connection, but petitions
require some faith that those in power will listen and
respond. We no longer have such faith in University
President Donald Kennedy and the Board of Trus
tees for the following reasons:
□ When 84 faculty and 1,500 students signed a
1983 petition calling for an investigation of Hoover's
political activities, Kennedy first talked about ap
pointing a distinguished visiting committee. In
stead, the board responded to the Faculty Senate's
call for an investigation by establishing the Trustee's
Committee on Hoover, whose members favored
deepening ties between Stanford and the Hoover In
stitution.
□ After months of apparent inactivity by the trus
tees, a second petition signed by 101 faculty mem
bers called for the appointment of a distinguished
and independent visiting committee on
Hoover/Stanford relations. Kennedy dismissed this
petition as a "cure in search of a disease."
□ A committee appointed by Kennedy to study ways
of developing closer relations between Stanford and
Hoover issued a report that many faculty members
thought maligned Individual faculty and depart
ments. In response, the Senate appointed the
Dornbush Committee, which raised the possibility of

a "divorce" between the two institutions. But the
Dornbush Committee exonerated Hoover of any ideo
logical bias, concluding that, "We do not believe that
Hoover s pride in its political influence is de facto
evidence of institutional partisanship."
If former members of the Dornbush Committee or
others at Stanford need more evidence of Hoover's
partisan political activities, they need look no further
than Hoover's latest report. We quote from W. Glenn
Campbell:
"It is a source of immense pride to know that the
ideas developed by scholars at the Hoover Institution
have greatly influenced the new policy agenda, and I
remain confident that historical analysis will in
creasingly recognize the key role played by these
scholars.
"It goes without saying that no one is more
qualified than the president himself to bear witness
to the fact that the scholars of the Hoover Institution
were present not only when the policy revolution of
the 1980s began, but also that their ideas played a
key role in determining the course the revolution was
to take." There follows a long quotation from Presi
dent Reagan testifying to his reliance on Hoover in
his 1980 campaign and on subsequent "policy revo
lution."
The Hoover Institution continues to boast of its
"op/ed" program and efforts to influence public
opinion. Over 550 newspapers, with a combined cir
culation of 62 million, have expressed interest in —
and are receiving — articles by Hoover scholars, the
report claims. "A major milestone was reached by the
Public Affairs Office this year," Hoover says, "as over
