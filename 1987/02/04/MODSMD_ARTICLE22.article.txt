## Speaking out from the reference desk Librarians: Not just trivial pursuers 
### BISHAKHA DATTA 
If you wanted to find out when the next full moon
will occur, where would you go?
The reference desk at Green Library might be a
good starting point.
"Students come in with all sorts of questions,"
says reference librarian Jim Knox, who has been at
Stanford for more than 20 years. Inquiries are often
simple directional questions — "Where's the bath
room?" is a common one — and can be answered
fairly quickly, according to Knox.
Or they could be basic informational questions,
such as "What is the symbolism of the cuckoo in
Western Literature?," he says.
"Undergraduates frequently will pose information
questions," says Anthony Angiletta, who heads Ref
erence Services at Green. Angiletta came to Stanford
five months ago after a 12-year stint at the Yale libra
ries.

Stanford students are
"incredibly obsequious"
toward teachers, refer
ence specialist Patty
Seleski says. However,
they have "this corporate
mentality when it comes
to reference librarians -
ordering them around
and all that."

"These questions are not too much of a challenge,"
says librarian David Langenberg. Langenberg works
five hours each week at the reference desk, says he
loves "going on line" and has recently been appointed
bibliographer for the budding Jewish studies collec
tion.
On the other hand, says Liz Green, a senior refer
ence specialist, "There's no such thing as an illegiti
mate question.
"It's nice to have questions you can answer and
questions that make you think," says Green, who
headed the library's Microtext and Periodicals Divi
sion until 1984.
The questions that make reference specialists
think most are those such as Vice Provost William

Chace's recent poser on the meaning of "Bushmilllan
melancholy."
Knox says he thought it had something to do with
Bushmill's whiskey. "If it's not that, I don't know
what the hell it is." he answered.
Another example of a stumper came when the
Stanford Development Office wanted a complete list
of all persons who had been educated at Stanford for
use as a potential donor base.
According to Patty Seleski. reference special
ist."Graduate students use the sources to (their) best
advantage." Graduates use the reference desk to
glean information on their research projects, theses
and dissertations, she explains.
Seleski. a doctoral student in history, says some
Stanford students approach the reference desk with
a less-than-ideal attitude.
"My main problem is Stanford students' approach
to what they see as service workers." she says.
Angiletta sees the librarian/student relationship
as one of "mutual deference." He says Stanford stu
dents are like Yale students In their "general savolr
faire' and their general knowledge of libraries."
This general knowledge of libraries is enough to
preclude "reference interviews," says Angiletta. A ref
erence interview is one in which a librarian quizzes a
student about specific information needs.
Seleski contrasts Stanford students' attitudes
toward teachers and librarians with the attitudes
held by students at UCLA, where he taught before
coming to Stanford.
Students here are "incredibly obsequious" toward
teachers, she says. However, she adds students have
"this corporate mentality when it comes to reference
librarians — ordering them around and all that."
She also says students often "don't think of
librarians as very learned people."
According to Knox, most Stanford students are
"very reasonable." However, "some want you to roll
out the red carpet and accede to their every wish."
"Students are very impressed by things that I don't
consider very impressive," says Green. As an exam
ple, she cites students' amazement at the speed at
which librarians dig up the exact chemical composi
tion of lipstick.
Speed is crucial for undergraduates who "have a
tendency to write their papers overnight," says Lan
genberg.
On a weekday evening, according to Langenberg,
two-thirds of the students at Green are undergradu
ates.
"Stanford students don't seem to work in the
mornings," says Seleski.
The crowd of bikes outside Green is largest on
weekdays, when the two people manning the desk
can field 40 to 50 questions per hour.
"Two hours at the desk and I'm ready to climb the
wall." Knox says.
This kind of load can cause a burnout, according
to Seleski. "That's when the absence of a simple
please' or "thank you' can hurt," she explains.
"It's not intended as rudeness but it turns out as
rudeness." she says.
However, most of the librarians cited the opportu

nity for personal contact with students as one of the
best aspects of the job. "The empathy with people
keeps me going," says Green. "People who are rude
are very upsetting."
Knox acknowledges that the librarians themselves
are sometimes at fault. "I know we're sometimes
short with people," says Knox. "Being human, we're
also fallible."
Knox says he has received a few complaints
through suggestion slips and the suggestion com
mand on Socrates and tries to respond to them.
According to Knox, there are several types of prob
lems with which students come to librarians.
"There's the helpless person who wants you to do
everything for them," he says. Then there are those
who won't pay attention while he's explaining some
thing, those "who complain about the hours" and
"those who can't believe that Stanford doesn't have
this book."
The "dread outsiders" who come to the library on
weekends and certain faculty members also create
problems for librarians.

"Faculty members are a real trip," says Seleski.
"If they're rude, they're very rude. They're the ones
I've been rudest (back) to," she says.
"If there is a set (of rude people) I had to point my
fingers to." says Green."it would be those who come
in from San Francisco, Santa Cruz, San Jose and the
surrounding communities."
"Outsiders demand a whole lot more," says
Seleski. "They don't understand that we're an aca
demic library and don't keep fishing magazines."
"There are (other) people who want you to trace
their family genealogy." she says.
Seleski says she always handles such requests
courteously, understanding Stanford's need to
maintain good relations with the community.
So what are the joys of being a librarian? For
Green, the challenge of something different every day
— indeed, every hour — is what keeps her coming to
work every day.
You literally don't know what the next person's
going to ask you," she says.

With the data from thousands of volumes available to him, it's pretty likely that reference librarian Greg
Smith will be able to find the answer to Loyci Stockey's question. The reference desk fields up to 50 ques

keeps me going," says Green. "People who are rude
are very upsetting."
Knox acknowledges that the librarians themselves
are sometimes at fault. "I know we're sometimes
short with people," says Knox. "Being human, we're
also fallible."
Knox says he has received a few complaints
through suggestion slips and the suggestion com
mand on Socrates and tries to respond to them.
According to Knox, there are several types of prob
lems with which students come to librarians.
"There's the helpless person who wants you to do
everything for them," he says. Then there are those
who won't pay attention while he's explaining some
thing, those "who complain about the hours" and
"those who can't believe that Stanford doesn't have
this book."
The "dread outsiders" who come to the library on
weekends and certain faculty members also create
problems for librarians.

"Faculty members are a real trip," says Seleski.
"If they're rude, they're very rude. They're the ones
I've been rudest (back) to," she says.
"If there is a set (of rude people) I had to point my
fingers to." says Green."it would be those who come
in from San Francisco, Santa Cruz, San Jose and the
surrounding communities."
"Outsiders demand a whole lot more," says
Seleski. "They don't understand that we're an aca
demic library and don't keep fishing magazines."
"There are (other) people who want you to trace
their family genealogy." she says.
Seleski says she always handles such requests
courteously, understanding Stanford's need to
maintain good relations with the community.
So what are the joys of being a librarian? For
Green, the challenge of something different every day
— indeed, every hour — is what keeps her coming to
work every day.
You literally don't know what the next person's
going to ask you," she says.

With the data from thousands of volumes available to him, it's pretty likely that reference librarian Greg
Smith will be able to find the answer to Loyci Stockey's question. The reference desk fields up to 50 ques
tions an hour during an average day.
If you wanted to find out when the next full moon
will occur, where would you go?
The reference desk at Green Library might be a
good starting point.
"Students come in with all sorts of questions,"
says reference librarian Jim Knox, who has been at
Stanford for more than 20 years. Inquiries are often
simple directional questions — "Where's the bath
room?" is a common one — and can be answered
fairly quickly, according to Knox.
Or they could be basic informational questions,
such as "What is the symbolism of the cuckoo in
Western Literature?," he says.
"Undergraduates frequently will pose information
questions," says Anthony Angiletta, who heads Ref
erence Services at Green. Angiletta came to Stanford
five months ago after a 12-year stint at the Yale libra
ries.

Stanford students are
"incredibly obsequious"
toward teachers, refer
ence specialist Patty
Seleski says. However,
they have "this corporate
mentality when it comes
to reference librarians -
ordering them around
and all that."

"These questions are not too much of a challenge,"
says librarian David Langenberg. Langenberg works
five hours each week at the reference desk, says he
loves "going on line" and has recently been appointed
bibliographer for the budding Jewish studies collec
tion.
On the other hand, says Liz Green, a senior refer
ence specialist, "There's no such thing as an illegiti
mate question.
"It's nice to have questions you can answer and
questions that make you think," says Green, who
headed the library's Microtext and Periodicals Divi
sion until 1984.
The questions that make reference specialists
think most are those such as Vice Provost William

Chace's recent poser on the meaning of "Bushmilllan
melancholy."
Knox says he thought it had something to do with
Bushmill's whiskey. "If it's not that, I don't know
what the hell it is." he answered.
Another example of a stumper came when the
Stanford Development Office wanted a complete list
of all persons who had been educated at Stanford for
use as a potential donor base.
According to Patty Seleski. reference special
ist."Graduate students use the sources to (their) best
advantage." Graduates use the reference desk to
glean information on their research projects, theses
and dissertations, she explains.
Seleski. a doctoral student in history, says some
Stanford students approach the reference desk with
a less-than-ideal attitude.
"My main problem is Stanford students' approach
to what they see as service workers." she says.
Angiletta sees the librarian/student relationship
as one of "mutual deference." He says Stanford stu
dents are like Yale students In their "general savolr
faire' and their general knowledge of libraries."
This general knowledge of libraries is enough to
preclude "reference interviews," says Angiletta. A ref
erence interview is one in which a librarian quizzes a
student about specific information needs.
Seleski contrasts Stanford students' attitudes
toward teachers and librarians with the attitudes
held by students at UCLA, where he taught before
coming to Stanford.
Students here are "incredibly obsequious" toward
teachers, she says. However, she adds students have
"this corporate mentality when it comes to reference
librarians — ordering them around and all that."
She also says students often "don't think of
librarians as very learned people."
According to Knox, most Stanford students are
"very reasonable." However, "some want you to roll
out the red carpet and accede to their every wish."
"Students are very impressed by things that I don't
consider very impressive," says Green. As an exam
ple, she cites students' amazement at the speed at
which librarians dig up the exact chemical composi
tion of lipstick.
Speed is crucial for undergraduates who "have a
tendency to write their papers overnight," says Lan
genberg.
On a weekday evening, according to Langenberg,
two-thirds of the students at Green are undergradu
ates.
"Stanford students don't seem to work in the
mornings," says Seleski.
The crowd of bikes outside Green is largest on
weekdays, when the two people manning the desk
can field 40 to 50 questions per hour.
"Two hours at the desk and I'm ready to climb the
wall." Knox says.
This kind of load can cause a burnout, according
to Seleski. "That's when the absence of a simple
please' or "thank you' can hurt," she explains.
"It's not intended as rudeness but it turns out as
rudeness." she says.
However, most of the librarians cited the opportu

nity for personal contact with students as one of the
best aspects of the job. "The empathy with people
