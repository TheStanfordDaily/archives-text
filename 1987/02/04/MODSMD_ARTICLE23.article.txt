## Two intriguing dramas to run this week 'Madman': Fun, macabre comedy 
### KIRSTEN JONES ANDY MERA 
"Your place is in the streets,
slut!" screams Mother Superior
(Sabine Von Dirke). flooring Sister
Anna (Shannon Jackson), a hope
lessly tarnished younger nun,
with one swipe.
This climactic Incident occurs
toward the finale of the Drama De
partment's production of "The
Madman and the Nun," a macabre
comedy by Polish playwright
Stanislaw Wltkiewlcz. directed by
Jane Sanborn. This particular
moment is indicative of the high
level of emotional interaction suc
cessfully maintained throughout
Witkiewicz's play, which draws
the audience into the world of the
poet and lunatic Walpurg (lan
Cummings).
In the opening act, Walpurg,
tightly constricted by a strait
jacket, struggles desperately with
the chain that holds him to his
bed. He shares with the audience
the torment of an inescapable
clock, a horrid and insistent tick
tocklng that clamors inside his
head. "My soul's fire has burned
away my earthly shell," Walpurg
says to Sister Anna, who has en
tered his ugly world to save his
soul. Through bursts of out
rageous hysteria and defeated, ex
hausted desperation, Walpurg
woefully appeals to the nun.
Sister Anna, through a finely
tuned mixture of feminine com
passion and holy intentions, acts
as a catalyst for a high-speed, ir
reversible sequence of events. Bit
by bit, we uncover new depths of
absurdity through Walpurg,
Sister Anna and the Freudian
feud between Doctors Grun and

Bidello (Matt Botvinick and Chris
Hart, respectively).
Botvinick's Grun is a Freudian
psychiatrist who is a little crazy
himself, and who naively triggers
his own demise by releasing Wal
purg from his chains. Hart, an im
posing presence, plays the Vic
torian psychiatrist Bidello, who
according to Walpurg is the seed
of all earthly evil. Bidello's cold
hearted undertaking of the poet's
plight shows a man whose mind
has the instinctive ability to
facilitate eternal, perfectly tem
pered torture.
The demented and oblique
qualities of the one-room set. a
ravaged nut-house cell, reach out
and pull the audience into the
play's warped bowels. The white
room is sparsely furnished, con
taining only a bed, chair and
table. The characters are all

costumed and made-up in a
similarly ghostly pallor, except for
Walpurg and Sister Anna, who are
the only characters to show recog
nizable human flesh tones. Sister
Anna bares a lot of skin in a
couple of particularly sacreligious
sex scenes in which she sheds her
cross and white habit, revealing,
with her sexy black negligee, her
true purpose.
One wonders whom to trust in
this surreal cesspool of sex, bad
poetry and psychoanalytical hub
bub. all in hues of black and
white. The poet Walpurg screams.
"The machine goes on and on!"
That's exactly what the audience
feels in the face of this network of
insanity. Fortunately, everything
works in an entertaining manner.
When the plot finally reaches a
point of complete entropy, we're
treated to deathly black comedy

(nicely spiced with two well
executed fainting spells), two
blockhead attendants (Armando
Mirando and David Kurtz) and a
comical censorship of a final
suicidal act. All seems to have
crumbled into a chaotic orgy of
unintelligible confusion until we
are surprised by a surrealistically
satisfying conclusion.
Thus. "The Madman and the
Nun" offers a cohesive and ener
getic cast (twisted maybe, but en
ergetic): a full-fledged portrayal of
a man confounded by the unhar
nessed capacities of his mind,
both creative and destructive; ef
fective set and costume design;
and meticulous direction. This
hour-long exploration of a nut
case is recommended to anyone in
their right mind.
"The Madman and the Nun"
plays tonight and Friday at 8 p.m.
in the Nitery.
