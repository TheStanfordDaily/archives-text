# A 						powerful 'Memory'

### ROBERT ABRAMS 
"The Shadow of a Memory."
conceived by Edward Isser, is
both a drama and a documen
tary. It's effective as a docu
mentary because it transmits
its message in a living manner,
not just through images. The
images in newsreels and televi
sion may be able to take us fur
ther, but they also make less of
an impression — they slide out
of the mind more easily.
"The Shadow of a Memory" is
very much a director's play. The
message that director Isser gets
across is more important than
the individual characters. He
attempts to present the com
plete range of human conse
quences inflicted by the
Holocaust, from its Nazi per
petrators to Allied soldiers to its
victims. Isser has succeeded
more than admirably.
The play presents us with
three realistically portrayed
men: Forest-Yeo Thomas (Drew
Barr), a British wing com
mander: Rudolf Hoss (Oliver
Gerland). a Nazi extermination
camp commandant: and Leon
Wells (Paolo Morante), a con
centration camp survivor.
These three men are caught in
emotional states characteristic
of their lives during the war.
They are all gripped by a
memory, but it is only a shadow
of a memory: it is never com
plete. What occured in the war
was larger than any one per
son's experience.
Even though the play Is real
istic, Isser, utilizing a his
toriographic tradition begun by

Thucydldes, carefully jux
taposes different elements for
maximum effect. The smooth
tone of Hoss Is contrasted with
the broken tone of Yeo-
Thomas. Repetition, names
and nationalities are all used to
emphasize the enormity of the
horror. Daring staging puts
Yeo-Thomas behind the
Nuremburg judges; just as he
was trapped in an immoral set
ting (the war) doing possibly
immoral acts for moral ends, so
too is he trapped in the con
tradictions of a moral, legal
trial of acts committed during
war — a time when morality is
often suspended.
Hoss. the German, explains
that he was caught by the force
of the national socialist move
ment. His delivery is smooth
and flowing. He admits what he
did. but excuses himself by
saying, "No SS officer could
have even thought of disobey
ing an order from Hitler."
His memory is full of conflict
ing images, just as his life
during the war was full of con
flicting actions — spending an
evening with his children in
the garden after a day with the
bodies of the dead. Hoss is so
overwhelmed by his experience
that he makes himself almost
forgivable, although in the end
he admits that he made the
wrong choice and that he
should have placed his family
before his duty.
Wells, the camp victim, is
also fluid in his delivery. Both
he and Hoss experienced the
full force of the Holocaust s terror, albeit from oppo
site sides, and were overwhelmed by It. Neither one
can hesitate In describing It. In the face of such an
experience, the only option open to them Is the
truth.

This powerful production
is effective because it
makes the horror real,
without ever overwhelm
ing the audience.

The development of Wells is diametrically opposed
to that of Hoss. He relates his life in the concentra
tion camp by reminiscing and reading out of his
diary. He lets detail after detail fall from his memory
into the audience. You want to shout and rage at the
things he says, yet still he grows stronger as he goes

along. The more foul life becomes, the more he
realizes Its value.
Wing commander Yeo-Thomas Is the third man In
the war's triangle. He Is the soldier placed between
the other two. His delivery Is slow but sharp, with
broken phrases. Entirely white and bloodless, his
hands twitch constantly. You can sense tension res
ting on the surface of his skin like an Invisible layer
of grime.
He was In a concentration camp, but as an officer
was not accorded the worst of possible treatments.
But he knew full well of such treatments; their exis
tence could not be avoided. He feels a responsibility
to bring down whatever vengeance he can, although
he realizes that, to a certain degree, he Is striking
blindly. For example, he provides many names and
dates for the Nuremburg prosecutor, but almost
none for the defense attorney.
Among the Individual actors, Morante Is superb as
Wells. Barr Is a consummate Yeo-Thomas. while Ger
land is credible as Hoss. Daniel Klein leaves some
thing to be desired as the Defense Counsel, but he
harmonizes with the rest of the production and the
tone of his performance serves the design of the di
rector.
Among countless other documentary reminders of
the same events, Isser has created a powerful pro
duction that is effective because it makes the horror
real without overwhelming the viewers to the point
where they might shut off their minds. As a whole,
the production is brilliantly crafted.
"The Shadow of a Memory" will run this Thursday
and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. in the
Nitery.
