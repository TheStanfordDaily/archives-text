"The Shadow of a Memory."
conceived by Edward Isser, is
both a drama and a documen
tary. It's effective as a docu
mentary because it transmits
its message in a living manner,
not just through images. The
images in newsreels and televi
sion may be able to take us fur
ther, but they also make less of
an impression — they slide out
of the mind more easily.
"The Shadow of a Memory" is
very much a director's play. The
message that director Isser gets
across is more important than
the individual characters. He
attempts to present the com
plete range of human conse
quences inflicted by the
Holocaust, from its Nazi per
petrators to Allied soldiers to its
victims. Isser has succeeded
more than admirably.
The play presents us with
three realistically portrayed
men: Forest-Yeo Thomas (Drew
Barr), a British wing com
mander: Rudolf Hoss (Oliver
Gerland). a Nazi extermination
camp commandant: and Leon
Wells (Paolo Morante), a con
centration camp survivor.
These three men are caught in
emotional states characteristic
of their lives during the war.
They are all gripped by a
memory, but it is only a shadow
of a memory: it is never com
plete. What occured in the war
was larger than any one per
son's experience.
Even though the play Is real
istic, Isser, utilizing a his
toriographic tradition begun by

Thucydldes, carefully jux
taposes different elements for
maximum effect. The smooth
tone of Hoss Is contrasted with
the broken tone of Yeo-
Thomas. Repetition, names
and nationalities are all used to
emphasize the enormity of the
horror. Daring staging puts
Yeo-Thomas behind the
Nuremburg judges; just as he
was trapped in an immoral set
ting (the war) doing possibly
immoral acts for moral ends, so
too is he trapped in the con
tradictions of a moral, legal
trial of acts committed during
war — a time when morality is
often suspended.
Hoss. the German, explains
that he was caught by the force
of the national socialist move
ment. His delivery is smooth
and flowing. He admits what he
did. but excuses himself by
saying, "No SS officer could
have even thought of disobey
ing an order from Hitler."
His memory is full of conflict
ing images, just as his life
during the war was full of con
flicting actions — spending an
evening with his children in
the garden after a day with the
bodies of the dead. Hoss is so
overwhelmed by his experience
that he makes himself almost
forgivable, although in the end
he admits that he made the
wrong choice and that he
should have placed his family
before his duty.
Wells, the camp victim, is
also fluid in his delivery. Both
he and Hoss experienced the
