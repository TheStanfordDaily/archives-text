## Netters overwhelm outclassed Rollins 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
It's an old saying that the more
things change, the more they stay
the same. That definitely applies
to the Stanford women's tennis
team. The Cardinal came out with
three new faces in the lineup, but
the defending NCAA champions
came out on top to start the new
season, scoring a 9-0 win over Rol
lins College at the Varsity Courts.
The Cardinal team that took the
national championship last year
had no seniors, but three players
did not compete yesterday.
Marianne Werdel decided to turn
professional over the summer,
senior Leigh Anne Eldredge has a
stress fracture and is out in
definitely, and junior Carl Hagey
has a muscle pull, but will likely
play in the next match.
The Cardinal proved its depth,
however, by giving up only one set
in nine matches. The onslaught
began only 40 minutes after the
match began when Cindy
Buchsbaum put the finishing
touches on an overmatched
Meredith Preston in the No. 6
singles match. The sophomore
transfer from Harvard scored
Stanford's first point of the year
by posting a 6-1, 6-0 win in her

first dual match appearance for
the Cardinal.
A short period later, freshman
Valerie Wilson scored her first win
for the Cardinal by beating Carrie
Sala 6-2, 6-1 at No. 5 singles.
The next result was in No. 1
singles. Defending NCAA cham
pion Patty Fendick showed Mary
Dineen how well a national cham
pion can play, defeating the Rol
lins All-American 6-2, 6-3. Fen
dick, a senior, started slowly,
having her serve broken in the
first game, but she came back
strong and ended the match with
four consecutive clean winners,
running her win streak to 29 con
secutive matches.
Then it was time for the other
freshman to get in on the scoring.
Lisa Green, playing No. 4 singles
in her first match for Stanford,
beat Jillian Lechey 6-2, 7-5.
The match was effectively over
when senior Kay Tittle beat Robin
Dolan by a 6-4, 6-2 score in the
No. 3 singles. The match wouldn't
end for almost three hours,
though.
Senior Stephanie Savides was
finally able to beat Allyson Farlow
in three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 in No. 2
singles. Brennan was happy with
the outcome. "Strange things can
