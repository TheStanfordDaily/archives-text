# America's Cup: Sport at its most exciting
## 
### 
In all likelihood, sometime today Dennis
Conner will skipper Stars & Stripes past
Kookaburra 111 and bring the America's Cup
back to the United States.
Flags will wave, bands will play, children
will miss school to dance in the streets,
President Reagan will make a telephone call
to the winning locker cabin, Rambo will kill
a couple hundred godless commies to com
memorate the occasion and we'll all feel gay
when Dennis comes sailing home.

For 130-some years, the United States
held a firm grip on the Cup. They even
named the thing after us. for God's sake.
And then a bunch of Crocodile Dundee im
itators came up to Newport. R. 1., and stole
the damn thing away.
They can't do that, we thought, that cup
is our birthright. It belongs right here in
the good old U.S. of A., not some island
masquerading as a continent where the
only export of note comes in 25-ounce cans.
Patriotic pride must be what has
motivated the current interest in a series of
yacht races. The sport itself certainly
hasn't.
ESPN has been broadcasting all the races
from the land Down Under. No doubt stu
dents have been flocking to Redwood City
all week to find a television in front of which
to kill a couple of hours and cheer on the
yacht flying the red. white and blue.
Yachting on television. There can only be
one thing more exciting â€” yachting on
radio.
