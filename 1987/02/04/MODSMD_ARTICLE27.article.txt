# Amaro starts this season with new position, same bat
## 
### DON HOGUE 
Ruben Amaro made a big move this
season. About 100 feet, to be exact.
Amaro, listed as a preseason All-
America second baseman by Baseball
America, has been transplanted from
his old infield position to left field.
"For the team, I think it's going to
be a positive move. We lost some very
talented outfielders to graduation,''
said the senior from Philadelphia, re
ferring to the departure of Mark Davis
and Walt Harris. "Hopefully, being out
there with Toi (Cook) will create some
stability out there."
Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess has
been pleased with Amaro's perfor
mance in his new position. "I asked
him to do something that would be
hard for him to do," Marquess said.
"He had played infield for three years
— we moved him all around. I'm quite
pleased with Ruben — he's adjusted
well to the new position.
"He has good speed, so he could
make up for his mistakes with that
good speed. He's got a good arm, so he
can throw people out from there. I
think playing the outfield will help
Amaro. It will show his versatility, and
it will show some scouts that he can
also play outfield."
Amaro was named to the Cape Cod
League All-Star team last summer
after hitting .289 for the Cotuit Ket
tlers as a second baseman. "He's
playing with some of the better college
players in the country, and to make it
to the All-Star team on the Cape is
quite an honor." Marquess said.
"He had quite a summer playing for

the Cape, and that's definitely going to help
him this year. And, hopefully, it'll be a car
ryover."
Amaro, a four-year starter at four different
positions — second base, third base, desig
nated hitter and left field — Is a consistent
threat at the plate with a .287 career average. A
line-drive hitter with great speed. Amaro was
second in the Pacific 10 Southern Division last
year with seven triples.
The switch-hitting Amaro has shown power
from both sides of the plate while maintaining
a good eye for pitches. After a freshman season
without a home run. Amaro hit six and four
the next two seasons. Going Into this year with
132 bases-on-balls. Amaro should finish In the
top five on the Stanford career walk list.
Amaro's energetic approach to the game was
Influenced by his father. Ruben Amaro Sr., a
major league infielder for several years and
currently a coach for the Chicago Cubs.
Asked to to come up with a single word to
describe the way he plays. Amaro thought for a
moment, then replied. "Effortful."
Effortful?
"Yeah, psycho," he explained. "I feel
motivated, compelled to excel. I've always been
very competitive, and I'm motivated to do al
most anything."
