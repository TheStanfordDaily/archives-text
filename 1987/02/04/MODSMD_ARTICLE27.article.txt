# Amaro starts this season with new position, same bat

### DON HOGUE 
Ruben Amaro made a big move this
season. About 100 feet, to be exact.
Amaro, listed as a preseason All-
America second baseman by Baseball
America, has been transplanted from
his old infield position to left field.
"For the team, I think it's going to
be a positive move. We lost some very
talented outfielders to graduation,''
said the senior from Philadelphia, re
ferring to the departure of Mark Davis
and Walt Harris. "Hopefully, being out
there with Toi (Cook) will create some
stability out there."
Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess has
been pleased with Amaro's perfor
mance in his new position. "I asked
him to do something that would be
hard for him to do," Marquess said.
"He had played infield for three years
— we moved him all around. I'm quite
pleased with Ruben — he's adjusted
well to the new position.
"He has good speed, so he could
make up for his mistakes with that
good speed. He's got a good arm, so he
can throw people out from there. I
think playing the outfield will help
Amaro. It will show his versatility, and
it will show some scouts that he can
also play outfield."
Amaro was named to the Cape Cod
League All-Star team last summer
after hitting .289 for the Cotuit Ket
tlers as a second baseman. "He's
playing with some of the better college
players in the country, and to make it
to the All-Star team on the Cape is
quite an honor." Marquess said.
"He had quite a summer playing for
