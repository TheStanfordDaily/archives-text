# Card nine hoping to play today
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
The sun rose in the east yester
day before setting in the west. Ser
vice at the Stanford Post Office
was slow.
And the Stanford baseball team
got rained out.
For the fifth time this season,
the Cardinal was victimized by the
weather when its scheduled game
against the University of the
Pacific was postponed due to
soggy conditions at Billy Hebert
Field. The two teams will try it
again today in Stockton at 3 p.m.
The Cardinal will bring a 2-1
record into today's contest while
the Tigers are 0-3. The Stanford
pitching staff has given up just
three earned runs on the year.
Sophomore Steve Chitren will try
for the third time to make his first
appearance of the year â€” his first
two starts were washed out.
Good weather is not the only
thing Stanford is looking for
before it opens the Pacific 10
Southern Division season against
second-ranked UCLA in Los An
geles on Feb. 27. The Cardinal is
also hoping for the return of
preseason All-America pitcher
Jack McDowell.
McDowell, who did not throw all
summer or fall because of a sore
shoulder, has been sidelined since
early January with a pulled groin
muscle. According to Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess.
McDowell's shoulder is completely
healthy, and the Cardinal ace
should be ready to go in about two
weeks.
