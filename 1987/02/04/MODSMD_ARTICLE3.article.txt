# Groups enter theme house bids

### MARCUS MABRY Staff writer 
The prospect of more theme houses on
campus moved closer to reality Monday when
groups representing Russian and East
European studies, international studies and
the arts submitted formal proposals for Uni
versity housing to Residential Education.
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Residential
Education, said she has extended the deadline
for proposals for a public service theme house
and a Latin American studies theme house.
The current proposals will be reviewed by a
"configuration panel," which consists of three
faculty members, three administrators and
two students representing various committees
concerned with residential education, Supton

said. The panel is chaired by Norm Robinson,
associate dean of Student Affairs.
In about a month, the panel will make
recommendations concerning each of the pro
posed houses to the newly established Com
mittee on Undergraduate Affairs, Supton said.
Final decisions are expected by late March,
in time to have descriptions of the new houses
published in next year's Draw Book.
In addition to the proposals to establish new
theme houses, the configuration panel will
also review reports submitted by existing
theme houses concerning their programs and
popularity.
Supton stated that none of the ethnic theme
houses are in danger of being eliminated and
that only if there are "glaring" problems would

Res Ed consider discontinuing other existing
houses.
Each theme house will receive a report from
the committee detailing its strengths and pos
sible areas of improvement, Supton said, em
phasizing that current faculty involvement,
house seminars and levels of student interest
make them appear to be "doing very well.''
The proposed houses have set off contro
versy among students and faculty who feel that
more theme houses on campus may unfairly
limit the diversity of University residences and
may bar students from the University's more
luxurious housing.
Supton strongly countered the charge that
theme houses hinder diversity in residences. "I
think there's a mlsperception that
you are going to have a
homogenous group (of students In
a theme house) because the resi
dents share a common academic
interest. They will actually have
the same diversity that other
houses have now. The students
will have a multitude of interests
and life experiences, they will just
have this one Interest in com
mon," she said.
She emphasized that a faculty
committee responsible for resi
dential education has completed
an in-depth study of theme

houses and has concluded that
they offered "a valuable option on
the educational front." The report
states that theme houses should
remain a part of the University's
residential system, according to
Supton.
The proposals for new houses
will be considered according to the
clarity of the houses' educational
programs and objectives, identifi
cation of faculty interested in
staffing the residences as resident
or faculty fellows, documented
student interest and, most impor
tantly, the distinct need for a resi
dential enviroment, Supton said.
The last time Res Ed called for
theme house proposals was more
than four years ago, she said.
"I've been surprised and pleased

at the range of interests and the
amount of student interest. The
faculty response has also been
wonderful. The opening of the op
portunity (to establish a theme
house) has called forth quite a lot
of interest," Supton said.
She said there is currently no
restriction on the amount of resi
dential space that can be allotted
for theme houses, but that Res Ed
may soon reassess its priorities
and reconsider what is the correct
balance between designated and
non-designated upperclass
housing.
Much of the current furor over a
possible increase in the number of
theme houses comes from stu
dents concerned about losing
prime housing, particularly on the

Row. from the non-designated
housing pool.
Supton said consideration of
housing facilities will depend
solely on the stated needs of the
theme house once it Is approved.
She emphasized that the require
ment of house seminar space, and
the stipulation that the residents
be upperclassmen. excludes halls
such as Stern and Wilbur, and
does fit Row houses more satisfac
torily. But "we're not restricting
our thinking to the Row." she
said.

tional studies and the Rus
sian/East European studies
theme house proposals were opti
mistic last night about the
chances of approval.
