### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Theme houses on campus
continue to be the subject of In
tense debate. Some criticize
them as isolated and exclusive.
According to officials in the the
Office of Residential Education
and theme house residents,
however, the houses are benefi
cial to the Stanford residential
experience.

The theme house was born
20 years ago, when Guthrie
House became La Maison Fran
calse. Since then, the theme
house concept has expanded,
and the University now boasts
eight theme houses, three of
which have ethnic-based
themes.
In coming years, the number

of theme houses may Increase
again. Last month Res Ed
began accepting proposals for
new academic theme houses,
and several campus groups are
attempting to establish theme
houses focusing on public ser
vice. the arts, international re
lations and Russian and Eas
tern Europe.
Res Ed's drive to establish
more academic theme houses
has renewed controversy.
Do theme houses tend to is
olate ethnic and intellectual
groups on campus? Do they ac
tually detract from the cross
cultural and interdisciplinary
learning they are supposed to
foster? Is the environment of a
theme house too supportive
and too comfortable, encourag
ing residents to interact only
with others in the house?
Susan Jansco. who is spear
heading the drive for an arts
theme house next year, is doing so
because she said she feels artists
need a place to come together in a
community. While it's good for
other students to have artists
mixed throughout the dorms, it's
"not good for the artists. All you
ever do is make fliers for people. In
an arts house, the general com
munity can benefit as [the culture
generated from the house] spreads
outward from the house," she
said.
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
Residential Education, said the
goals of theme houses are basi
cally the same as they were at the
start of the late '60s. The houses
create a "chance for students who
share Interests to work together
with faculty members for activi
ties not available elsewhere on
campus," she said.
The ethnic theme house in par
ticular is intended to "provide an
opportunity for students of differ

ent ethnic backgrounds to learn
from and about each others'
cultures." according to Res Ed's
guidelines. Theme houses of this
sort should also create "an envi
ronment which is supportive and
comfortable for students whose
ethnicity is the focus of the house
and for other residents as well."
Bob Gordon, resident fellow of
the American studies house, said
students with one particular
major are not clustered into the
theme house with that focus; the
American studies house has only
one American studies major.
"Even if the house were a haven
for majors, the field is so broadly
defined that it would pick up
many different interests. Besides,
many people don't want to live
with the people who they go to
classes with," he said.
The best theme house, accord
ing to Gordon, is one with a very
broad theme, with a "loose com
monality of interests."
The more vague the theme
criteria, however, the harder it is
for the house staff to set concrete
goals and gauge the residence's
performance through evaluations,

according to Cal Lai, resident fel
low at Okada, the Asian-American
theme house. "Criteria for assess
ing academic theme houses can
be more specific. Questions of eth
nicity arc not so easy to quantify.
It's difficult to come up with meth
odology to measure success."
"A lot of (negative) things said
about theme houses are just
rumors," said Connie Okeke. resi
dent assistant for Ujamaa, Stan
ford's black theme house. "We are
all working to eliminate the
negative stereotypes. It's hard to
change people's minds."
Okeke said she believes dorms
such as Ujamaa. which is 30 to 40
percent black, do not significantly
reduce diversity in the other
residences on campus. "If you pull
us out" of Ujamaa, she said, the
number of blacks in other dorms
"is still diluted. Minority enroll
ment is on the decline. Theme
houses are the most culturally
diverse dorms on campus."
Lai agreed. "The pie is big
enough to go around. There's a lot
of diversity on campus. There are
more Asian-Americans than can
fit in Okada," he said. People

using the argument that theme
houses drain the diversity of the
other dorms are "trying to ration
alize why they don't like theme
houses. If the University has a
commitment to support, continue
and further the concerns of
various ethnic groups, it must
maintain theme houses."
"Theme houses are here to
stay," said Ujamaa Resident Fel
low Michael Britt. "They are the
best places to experience diversity.
It's more than just a chapter in a
book, you live it â€” day in, day
out." Saying that theme houses
decrease dorm diversity is "failing
to admit diversity among black
students themselves," he said.
However, not everyone assigned
to an academic or ethnic theme
house enjoys it, according to Ruth
Hamerton-Kelly, a Mirlo resident
assistant who lived in Zapata, the
Chicano theme house, as a fresh
man.
At times, said Hamerton-Kelly.
there can be reverse discrimina
tion against whites because resi
dents are "so closely tied to the
Chicano community; it's a whole
other network."
