The theme house was born
20 years ago, when Guthrie
House became La Maison Fran
calse. Since then, the theme
house concept has expanded,
and the University now boasts
eight theme houses, three of
which have ethnic-based
themes.
In coming years, the number

of theme houses may Increase
again. Last month Res Ed
began accepting proposals for
new academic theme houses,
and several campus groups are
attempting to establish theme
houses focusing on public ser
vice. the arts, international re
lations and Russian and Eas
tern Europe.
Res Ed's drive to establish
more academic theme houses
has renewed controversy.
Do theme houses tend to is

theme house too supportive
and too comfortable, encourag
ing residents to interact only
with others in the house?
