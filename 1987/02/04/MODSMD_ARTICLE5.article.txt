SmithKline Beckman Corpora
tion, the manufacturer of Contac
and Dietac, will donate *7.8 mil
lion to Stanford University's Cen
ter for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine (CMGM).
Of this amount, *5 million will
go toward funding construction of
the center, while *2.8 million will
help support the center's re
search. The center is scheduled to
be completed in late 1988.
The donation — the largest by a
private health care company to the
center — brings to *86.6 million
the total funds raised for the cen
ter's construction and research.
The center Is now about *3 mil
lion short of its fund-raising goal
for construction.
In return for the donation,
Philadelphia-based SmithKline
Beckman will have all patent
rights to processes and products
that result from projects it funds.
The president and chief execu

tive officer of SmlthKllne Beck
man. Henry Wendt. said the union
between "one of the birthplaces of
genetic engineering" and one of
the "most productive biotechnol
ogy companies" has great poten
tial.
Stanford Medical School is
known for its pioneering work on
the basic mechanisms of the ge
netic substance DNA, while
SmithKline Beckman research
programs have already used
recombinant DNA technology to
develop vaccines and potentially
significant therapeutic agents to
treat disease.
Nobel Prize-winning biochemist
and director of the center Paul
Berg praised the "enterprising al
liance between the new center and
one of the world's leading health
care and life sciences companies."
"Cooperative research with
private industry is crucial for
reaching the next generation of
medical advances," he said.
