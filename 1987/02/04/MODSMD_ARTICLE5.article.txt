# Gift boosts gene center

### BISHAKHA DATTA Staff writer 
SmithKline Beckman Corpora
tion, the manufacturer of Contac
and Dietac, will donate *7.8 mil
lion to Stanford University's Cen
ter for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine (CMGM).
Of this amount, *5 million will
go toward funding construction of
the center, while *2.8 million will
help support the center's re
search. The center is scheduled to
be completed in late 1988.
The donation — the largest by a
private health care company to the
center — brings to *86.6 million
the total funds raised for the cen
ter's construction and research.
The center Is now about *3 mil
lion short of its fund-raising goal
for construction.
In return for the donation,
Philadelphia-based SmithKline
Beckman will have all patent
rights to processes and products
that result from projects it funds.
The president and chief execu

tive officer of SmlthKllne Beck
man. Henry Wendt. said the union
between "one of the birthplaces of
genetic engineering" and one of
the "most productive biotechnol
ogy companies" has great poten
tial.
Stanford Medical School is
known for its pioneering work on
the basic mechanisms of the ge
netic substance DNA, while
SmithKline Beckman research
programs have already used
recombinant DNA technology to
develop vaccines and potentially
significant therapeutic agents to
treat disease.
Nobel Prize-winning biochemist
and director of the center Paul
Berg praised the "enterprising al
liance between the new center and
one of the world's leading health
care and life sciences companies."
"Cooperative research with
private industry is crucial for
reaching the next generation of
medical advances," he said.
Currently under construction
southwest of the Stanford Medical
Center, the five-story building has
about 100.000 square feet of labo
ratory and office space.
Part of the medical center, the
CMGM will utilize genetic engi
neering, molecular biology and
other techniques to develop
preventive methods and cures for
diseases now beyond medicine's
grasp.
It will also institute programs to
bring together laboratory research
and clinical practice. About 80
faculty members, 100 to 200
graduate students and several
hundred postdoctoral fellows
could be involved in these pro
grams.
The center will house the de
partments of biochemistry,
molecular and developmental biol
ogy. molecular and cell physiology.

and the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute Unit in Molecular and
Genetic Medicine.
The Hughes unit is funded by
the Miami-based Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, which has given
• 17.8 million in advance lease
payments to cover the center's
construction costs.
The institute-leased space will
house 12 Howard Hughes inves
tigators who will hold Stanlord
faculty appointments. The in
stitute will separately fund the in
vestigators' research.
The Hughes unit will study
genes related to human disease
and develop new diagnostic tests
for known and newly recognized
diseases and therapies based on
gene or cell replacement models.
Other major donations Include
*12 million from the Arnold and
Mabel Beckman Foundation, >5.9
million from the Axtell Moule
Foundation, *3 million from the
Sherman Fairchild Foundation
and >1.5 million from Syntex Cor
poration.
