# Library funds insufficient?
## Report claims costs rising 
### NANNETTE THOMPSON Staff writer 
The reduction of the- University
Libraries budget may ultimately
lead to fewer new acquisitions,
limited library hours and the mer
ging of branch libraries, accord
ing to a report prepared by the
Committee on Libraries (C-Lib),
Fac Sen advisory committee
composed of faculty and students.
The report, which also calls for
an Improved library database sys
tem, will be reviewed tomorrow at
a meeting of the Faculty Senate.
For the past four to five years,
University Libraries has been
asked to reduce its budget by 2
percent annually, according to C-
Lib Chairman Decker Walker, as
sociate professor of education.
Although the budget has
remained fairly constant, it does
not take into account inflation or
the increase in library user
demand, he said.
The monetary cuts, if continued

"for even a few years," could result
in the curtailment of user
services, such as the reduction of
scheduled hours, according to the
report.
"We are doing everything we can
not to reduce hours." said Univer
sity Libraries Director David
Weber. One of University Libra
ries' top budget requests has been
for a "rather modest amount of
money" to keep the libraries open
for limited hours during vacation
periods. Weber said. This request
was made in response to repeated
suggestions by faculty and
graduate students, he said.
University Libraries is trying to
trim expenditures in ways that
will have the least adverse effects
on users. Weber said. For exam
ple. it is likely that graduate
reserves will be moved by next
quarter from Green Library to the
Meyer Library reserve desk. Admi
nistrators hope this will increase
efficiency.
The committee's report also
calls for an updating of the cur

rent electronic database system in
Stanford libraries.
"In the coming years, the
quality and ease of access to infor
mation in electronic form will be a
major determinant of academic
life at Stanford," the report stated.
The report calls for several im
provements in Socrates, the Uni

versity's on-line computer system.
For instance, most items
catalogued before 1972 are not in
the system. Weber estimates that
61 percent of University Libraries'
holdings have been converted to
the on-line system.
Last year, a proposal to upgrade
the computerized system was

rejected in the face of "budgetary
stresses." according to the report.
Since that time. Weber said, the
medical library has installed an
electronic "local catalogue sys
tem," which challenges the Uni
versity Libraries group and the
coordinate libraries to offer the
same facilities.
