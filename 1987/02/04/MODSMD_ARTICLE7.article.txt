# Don't fear change, writer advises
## 
### JILL GILBERT 
Bestselling author James Burke ex
pressed optimism about today's rapidly
changing computer-based society yesterday
to a packed crowd in Cubberley Aud
itorium.
Sponsored by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau. Burke's lecture was entitled
"Mechanisms of Change: Do Lemons
Whistle?"
Burke, writer and producer of the PBS
television series "Connections" and"The
Day the Universe Changed," claimed that
contemporary critical attitudes toward
computers resemble 15th-century ap
prehensions about printing and books.
"It seems to me our present rate of change
is particularly high because with our pres
ent facility for moving information around,
we're doing more of one trick than ever
before in our history. And that is the trick
of putting things together that were never
together before," he said.
"The basic juxtaposltional mechanism of
change may operate the same way as a joke
does." Burke said. "Take the concept of a
bird and a fruit. Every one of you has those
models in your concepts somewhere. Let me
create a new association between them and
see If you laugh. A drunk goes up to his host
at a party and says 'Excuse me, but do
lemons whistle?' To which his host replies,

No, no, lemons don't whistle. Why do you
ask?' And the drunk says, extremely
chagrined, 'On my God. In that case I've just
squeezed your canary into my gin and
tonic.' "
Burke not only offered theories of change,
he defended change itself.
"In the future, ethical value systems may
be upturned every week, because the
judgmental systems are based on the
knowledge base, and that certainly will be
changing every week.
"Perhaps we should be doing something
to prepare for it. Like a radical and massive
switch in secondary education, for exam
ple, teaching kids primarily information
science to which all else will be secondary in
a world where the computer does your pro
cessing and remembering for you. Shock?
Horror? Harumph? That's exactly what
they said about paper in the 1300s. And
about books in 1460.
"I can't really see any other choice but to
go the Information science route in second
ary education. In some ways it might ulti
mately lead to a rebirth of humanity," he
said. "With the help of new machines, you
might finally be able to make use of people's
abilities to daydream, to think naturally, to
use flair."
Burke said change often meets a conser-

vatlve reaction, as "nobody wants
to rock the boat."
People worry about microchips,
he said. They wonder what kind of
society the U.S. will become.
"What will marriage be like when
nobody leaves home? . . . What
will work be like without office
politics?"
When printing was Introduced,
people feared It would take away
their memories; when locomotion
became popular, people feared
they would be asphyxiated at 30
miles per hour, he said. Current
fears regarding computers, such
as the belief that the machines
will take away jobs, resemble these
old fears, he said.
"A change In the accepted way of
doing things Is usually perceived
as something that Is going to
create problems, and people resist
Innovation. Sometimes you don't
know change is happening even if
you're personally Involved," Burke
said.
"Everybody has to have some
version of what's what. . . . Why
does change come along? I mean,
metaphysically speaking, no one
model is better than any other.
Why does the boat get rocked?
Why does change happen when we

find It so hard to adapt to, and
worse, second guess? And when,
in any case, everything is fine the
way It is? It isn't as If we actually
encourage change."
Change arises when one sees
new connections between bits of
data. Burke said.
But a change in a concept isn't
always accompanied by a change
in descriptive language. Burke
said.
"We still talk about electricity Jn
terms of currents because Ben
jamin Franklin thought it was a
fluid. We always talk about how
the sun goes down when we know
it doesn't go anywhere. Malaria
comes from the Italian words
mala aria, which means bad air,
because in the early 19th century
they thought that smell caused
disease. We still use the word."
Burke received an honors
degree in English literature from
Oxford. He has since compiled an
Italian-English dictionary, acted
as an interpreter at a Vatican con
ference and hosted a BBC talk
show called "Burke's Special." He
lives in London, but Is touring the
United States, working on a new
program and giving lectures. "The
Day the Universe Changed" was
recently issued as a book and Is
currently on The New York Times
bestseller list.

"I can't really see any other choice but to
go the Information science route in second
ary education. In some ways it might ulti
mately lead to a rebirth of humanity," he
said. "With the help of new machines, you
might finally be able to make use of people's
abilities to daydream, to think naturally, to
use flair."

vatlve reaction, as "nobody wants
to rock the boat."
People worry about microchips,
he said. They wonder what kind of
society the U.S. will become.
"What will marriage be like when
nobody leaves home? . . . What
will work be like without office
politics?"
When printing was Introduced,
people feared It would take away
their memories; when locomotion
became popular, people feared
they would be asphyxiated at 30
miles per hour, he said. Current
fears regarding computers, such
as the belief that the machines
will take away jobs, resemble these
old fears, he said.
"A change In the accepted way of
doing things Is usually perceived
as something that Is going to
create problems, and people resist
Innovation. Sometimes you don't
know change is happening even if
you're personally Involved," Burke
said.
"Everybody has to have some
version of what's what. . . . Why
does change come along? I mean,
metaphysically speaking, no one
model is better than any other.
Why does the boat get rocked?
Why does change happen when we

find It so hard to adapt to, and
worse, second guess? And when,
in any case, everything is fine the
way It is? It isn't as If we actually
encourage change."
Change arises when one sees
new connections between bits of
data. Burke said.
But a change in a concept isn't
always accompanied by a change
in descriptive language. Burke
said.
"We still talk about electricity Jn
terms of currents because Ben
jamin Franklin thought it was a
fluid. We always talk about how
the sun goes down when we know
it doesn't go anywhere. Malaria
comes from the Italian words
mala aria, which means bad air,
because in the early 19th century
they thought that smell caused
disease. We still use the word."
Burke received an honors
degree in English literature from
Oxford. He has since compiled an
Italian-English dictionary, acted
as an interpreter at a Vatican con
ference and hosted a BBC talk
show called "Burke's Special." He
lives in London, but Is touring the
United States, working on a new
program and giving lectures. "The
Day the Universe Changed" was
recently issued as a book and Is
currently on The New York Times
bestseller list.
