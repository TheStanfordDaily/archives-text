AIDS test use may be expanded
WASHINGTON — Federal health officials, concerned about the
spread of AIDS among heterosexuals, said yesterday they may rec
ommend expanding the use of the AIDS blood test to all patients
admitted to hospitals, women seeking pre-natal care and couples
applying for marriage licenses.
"We need to continue to search for any possible way to affect the
course of this epidemic," said Dr. Walter Dowdle. deputy director
for AIDS programs at the Centers for Disease Control. "We are
trying to explore ways to use the test for prevention."
The blood test, which measures the presence of AIDS antibodies
that indicate exposure to the virus, now is required for those who
donate blood, for active-duty military personnel and recruits and
for State Department Foreign Service officers. Scientists believe
that between 30 and 50 percent of those exposed to the deadly
virus, which is transmitted in blood and semen, will develop AIDS
within five years of exposure.
Reaction by gay-rights groups and public-health officials to the
suggestion that testing be expanded ranged from skepticism to
outrage. Gay-rights advocates said they feared that increased test
ing would result in more cases of AIDS discrimination and could
ultimately lead to quarantine. Health officers said revenue
pinched states would be forced to choose between testing and
preventive education.
Iranian power struggle escalating
TEHRAN, Iran — A complex and ruthless factional power
struggle within the ruling hierarchy of Iran's Islamic Republic ap
pears to be escalating in preparation for what diplomats and other
analysts here believe will be a troubled and difficult political
succession once the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah
Khomeini, passes from the scene.
The power struggle, these sources said, has been raging for at
least the past nine months as signs have mounted that Khomeini.
86, who guided the revolution that toppled Shah Mohammad Pah
lavi eight years ago, is suffering from the effects of advanced age, a
weak heart and a low-grade cancer of the prostate.
The main competing factions are aligned behind Ayatollah Hos
sein Montazeri, 63, who was designated Khomeini's successor
two years ago, and the politically agile, and increasingly powerful,
speaker of the majlis, or parliament, Hojatoleslam All Rafsanjani,
52.
Montazeri's supporters, who insist on defending the purity of
the Islamic revolution, have strongly opposed Rafsanjani's efforts
to bolster Iran's relations with the outside world.
Rafsanjani, according to diplomats, is more of an opportunist
than an ideologue in the dispute and often plays to whatever issue
seems most likely to advance his cause and his chances of being a
key player in Iran after Khomeini dies. His main power base is the
fanatical Revolutionary Guards, who often employ suicidal tactics
in the war against Iraq and are fighting in the vanguard of the
current Iranian offensive against Basra.
Clean water veto overridden
WASHINGTON — President Reagan suffered his first legislative
defeat of the 100 th Congress yesterday as the House voted over
whelmingly to override his veto of a >20 billion clean water bill.
Only 26 members, all Republicans, supported Reagan, who
called GOP leaders to the White House only hours before the vote
to ask for support. The president objects to the bill's cost and said
the measure is "loaded with waste and larded with pork." The vote
to override was 401 to 26.
The Senate, which approved the legislation. 93 to 6. on Jan. 21,
is expected to complete the override process today.
The bill was identical to one that passed the House and Senate
unanimously last October but "pocket vetoed" by Reagan after the
99th Congress adjourned. It would authorize *18 billion over
eight years for sewage treatment plants and about *2 billion for
related clean water programs.
Economic indicators rise
WASHINGTON — The government's chief measure of future eco
nomic growth bounded upward 2.1 percent in December, the
fourth consecutive increase and the largest gain in nearly four
years, the Department of Commerce said yesterday.
Analysts quickly pointed out that the increase was probably in
flated by several one-time-only effects, but said that it still strongly
suggested greater growth in the latter part of 1987.
Much of the surge was caused by building permits and a spate
of consumer borrowing, two of the index's 11 components.
New orders for non-defense manufactured goods increased 4.4
nercent in December, the best such monthly showing since Sep
tember 1980. Also, single-family home sales jumped 12.7 percent
last month, capping the housing industry's best year since 1978.
The one-time effects included an apparent last-minute Decem
ber rush to beat the introduction of the new federal tax code and
implementation of higher building-permit fees in California, both
of which took effect on Jan. 1.
The overall 2.1 percent jump was the largest single monthly
gain in the index since a 3.1 percent increase in January 1983 in
the early stages of the economy's recovery from the steep 108/
recession.
Brezhnev's son-in-law arrested
MOSCOW — In a move underscoring increased criticism of late
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, Soviet authorities have arrested
his son-in-law for "corruption and bribe-taking," the Foreign Min
istry confirmed yesterday.
The arrest of 48-year-old Yuri Churbanev was seen as a strong
signal to the balky Soviet bureaucracy that Soviet Premier Mikhail
Gorbachev is determined to carry out a profound reconstruction
of Soviet society.
Churbanov was a handsome young police lieutenant colonel
when he was assigned as security escort to Brezhnev's
independent-minded and strong-willed daughter Galina. A family
source said this was done in the hope that she would be attracted
to him.
Churbanov remained in the Ministry of Interior under Yuri
Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko but was demoted in 1985
and reassigned to an unspecified position.
Senate allows 65 mph speed limit
WASHINGTON — The Senate, acknowledging that the 55-mph
speed limit is making lawbreakers out of most American
motorists, voted yesterday to let states raise the maximum speed
to 65 mph on rural interstate highways.
Led by senators from the expansive West, the Senate agreed by a
vote of 65-33 to increase the limit despite concerns that it would
add to the death toll on the nation's highways.
"This is a law broken daily by everybody." Sen. Alan Simpson.
(R-Wyo.) said In urging his colleagues to allow the states to set
their own speed limits.
Under the measure, states would get back the authority to set
speed limits on Interstate highways outside communities that
have populations of fewer than 50.000.
In California, that could mean a speed limit up to 65 mph on
about 1.400 miles of highway.
This year, backers of the 65-mph speed limit hope that they can
win sufficient votes among 50 new members elected to the House
in November to secure passage of the proposal.
