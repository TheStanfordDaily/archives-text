University and student leaders
agreed last night at the ASSU Stu
dent Forum that students should
participate more in decision
making at Stanford, but panel
members disagreed over how
much power students should have
in the policy process.
Five representatives from
various sectors of the Administra
tion and five student representa
tives from different interest
groups on campus came together
last night before a sparse audi
ence in Cubberley Auditorium.
The topic of discussion,
"Student Influence On University
Decision-Making." provoked a
number of different opinions from
members of the panel. Although
most agreed that Increased stu
dent Involvement was needed, the
differences of opinion came in a
discussion of the capacity In
which students should be in
volved and the amount of author
ity students should have in the
process.
Student leaders lamented the
University's apparent disregard of
their voices. Junior Barb Voss, a
representative from Stanford Out
of South Africa, said the Univer
sity shows a blatant "disrespect
for the will of the majority."
In response. Administration
representatives described what
they called the decentralized na
ture of University decision
making based on tne committee
system.
A student in the audience,
however, enumerated several
weaknesses in the committee sys
tem. He said students on Univer
sity committees are often unin
formed, apathetic or disregarded,
and blamed the system for
promoting consensus-building
