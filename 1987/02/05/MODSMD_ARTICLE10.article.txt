# U.S. defends new naval buildup
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The United
States is amassing a larger-than
usual naval force off the coast of
Lebanon, but a White House
spokesman yesterday cautioned
against speculation that military
action is imminent in the Middle
East's continuing hostage crisis.
Pentagon officials said that a
five-ship amphibious assault force
carrying helicopters and 1,900
Marines was en route from Spain
to join a flotilla of about 30 other
ships, including two aircraft carri
ers. now operating in the eastern
Mediterranean.
The Navy usually maintains
about 25 combat ships in the
region, said one source, who des
cribed the deployment of addi

tional ships as precautionary.
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater, while not ruling out the
possibility of a military strike,
sought to discourage such sugges
tions.
"I can't speculate on any future
course of action," Fitzwater said
in reponse to questions. "We al
ways do have substantial forces in
the area, but I would urge not to
speculate along those lines."
At another point during the
White House briefing, he said, "I
would urge a little downgrading of
the speculation" that the marshal
ing of naval forces foreshadows
military action.
"Our forces are there on what in
many ways is normal activities

and operations. . . . The forces are
there to protect our strategic in
terests and to support our friends
in the region." he said, urging
reporters not "to jump to any con
clusions about any military activi
ties."
The buildup of U.S. forces in the
area began in recent weeks when a
new wave of kidnappings in
creased to eight the number of
Americans believed held hostage
by terrorists in Lebanon.
Administration officials have
been cautious in describing ship
movements. Chief Pentagon
spokesman Robert Sims, for ex
ample, said Tuesday that the
movements "are cautionary in na
ture. ... It is prudent to do so,
given the increase in tensions in

the area . . . and to allow the presi
dent to examine the full range of
options available to him."
Other sources, while stressing
that no orders had been issued to
the naval force to prepare for an
attack, said contingency plans are
being constantly updated for pos
sible action against terrorist
camps and training sites In
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, as well as
in such countries as Syria and
Libya.
One extremist group, the Is
lamic Jihad, has warned that
American and other hostages will
be killed "in case of any military
attempts against Moslems in the
area and especially in Lebanon."
