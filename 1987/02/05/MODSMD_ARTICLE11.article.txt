# Meese assailed for 'right-wing agenda'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111, testifying before the Senate
Judiciary Committee for the first time since
Democrats took control of the panel, was
accused yesterday of "contemptible" actions In
pursuit of a "right-wing agenda."
A grim-faced Meese dismissed the harshest
of the attacks, by Sen. Edward Kennedy. D-
Mass., as "a political diatribe" and described
himself as "one of the foremost defenders of
civil rights in the United States."
But the attorney general also drew fire from
a member of his own party. Republican Sen.
Charles Grassley of lowa, signaling that he
faces rough sledding before the committee as
he tries to implement further changes at the
Department of Justice in the final two years of
the Reagan administration.
Chairman Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., said
that the committee, which oversees the De
partment of Justice, will conduct the first
"comprehensive review" of the department
since 1979.
"Bar none, this is the most anti-civil rights
administration I have ever seen," Kennedy
said, noting that he had served in the Senate
for 24 years.
The administration's sins, Kennedy

charged, include "tax credits for segregated
schools, opposition to the Voting Rights Act,
resistance to the Martin Luther King holiday
bill, the assault on the Civil Rights Commlss
sion, relentless hostility to affirmative action,
the shameful ballot security program for the
1986 election (and) the nomination of racists
to the federal courts."
"Howard Beach and Forsyth County are hap
pening on your watch, Mr. Meese," he said, re
ferring to recent racial incidents in New York
and Georgia.
Meese battled back, saying, "I consider
myself one of the foremost defenders of civil
rights in the United States."
"In most of the things you have said in your
political diatribe, you are just flat wrong,"
Meese said. He added that there were "so many
inaccuracies in (Kennedy's) statement of facts"
that he would respond later in writing.
"The 1988 presidential race has now
begun," declared Republican Sen. Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, the former
chairman.
"Who's in it?" asked Biden, who is consider
ing seeking the Democratic nomination — a
quip that drew one of the few laughs at the
tense session.

Kennedy, who called the administration's
record "contemptible.'' condemned the ap
pointment of only three blacks in the 97 Dis
trict Court judgeships.
Meese responded that, in appointing judges,
the president draws from a pool of names pro
posed by GOP senators. But Kennedy Inter
rupted: "We weren't born yesterday. We all
know the power of the attorney general. If you
want to indict your party's senators up here,
that will stand."
"Senator. I think you know better than
that," Meese said. "I think you know this is a
shared responsibility between senators, the at
torney general's office and the president."
He added that party registration would "have
something to do" with the small number of
blacks appointed. The overwhelming majority
of black voters are Democrats.
Grassley centered his criticism on what he
sees as the Department of Justice's failure to
vigorously prosecute fraud by defense contrac
tors. The General Accounting Office, the audit
ing arm of Congress, has found that none of
the top defense contractors — many of which
Grassley said had been investigated — were
prosecuted through July 1986.
