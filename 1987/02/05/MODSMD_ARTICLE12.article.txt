# Speaker: AIDS becoming major social crisis now
## 
### EMMA GARFORTH 
As sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) become a
widespread problem in our society, the social and be
havioral attitudes toward the diseases are changing,
Sevgi Aral, sociologist from the Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta, told a human biology class Tues
day.
The major shift, she said, is in the medical field,
where researchers are now treating AIDS less as a in
fectious disease and more as a chronic disease.
The Implications of that shift are enormous, espe
cially from a societal point of view, Aral said. Because
there is no cure for AIDS, no vaccine and no explana
tion for who gets the disease and when, increasing
awareness of STDs is leading to new attitudes and
responses to the disease, she added.
New responses to AIDS must involve a change in
sexual lifestyles and an Increase in health education
and sex education, said Aral. She also said society
must address the current STD hysteria not only with
medical research, but also with new attitudes on all
levels of relationships.
Traditional explanations of STDs are no longer
valid, she said. There has been a reversal of the
sexual revolution of the late '60s and early '70s, yet
there is still a rise in the number of STD cases, she
said. "STDs can no longer be blamed on the sexual
revolution," she said.
One of sociology's contributions in the battle
against STDs is a better understanding of the

reasons why STDs are so prevalent. Aral said. This
understanding has led to the development of better
methods of coping with the diseases, she said.
Kevin O'Reilly, an anthropologist who Is also from
the Center for Disease Control, addressed the class
as well, concentrating on the problems of AIDS in
Western society.
O'Reilly said there are two systems of AIDS trans
mission. The western system involves homosexual
and bisexual activity and Intravenous drug abuse, he
said. Transmission In Africa, he said, results from
heterosexual activity, bad health care practices and
tribal rituals such as those that involve vein split
ting.
He said that while AIDS is a worldwide problem. It
is a greater problem In the West.
The rate of reported AIDS cases and deaths has
decreased but. O'Reilly said, the decrease is due to
the saturation effect of AIDS. Because the disease
spreads so rapidly, said O'Reilly, the number of pos
sible victims is on the decline, reducing the number
of possible new AIDS cases but not the already alarm
ingly high number of deaths related to AIDS.
The major problem with AIDS, said O'Reilly, is the
diseases' five- to seven- year latency period, a length
of time that makes it difficult to know whether a
partner has the virus.
Both Aral and O'Reilly stressed that society needs
to learn a great deal more about STDs and AIDS, and
that health education and sex education should be
increased.
