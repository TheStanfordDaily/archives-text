Recent statements by Hoover Institution
Director W. Glenn Campbell inhibit the aca
demic freedom of Stanford and damage ef
forts to repair relations between Hoover and
the University.
In the public's perception, the largely inde
pendent research center is as linked to Stan
ford as it is to its political charge of
demonstrating "the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx." Therefore, the University must
walk a fine line to avoid further suggestion
that academic freedom here is compromised
by the presence of Hoover.
Since Campbell first spoke of a "Reagan
connection" four years ago, the University
has tried to overcome this perception by
seeking faculty oversight of Hoover to check
the almost unlimited power of its director.
This question of governance is the key to the
Stanford/Hoover dispute. Hoover's John
Cogan, senior fellow and acting director, and
Acting University President James Rosse
have made progress in recent years at in
creasing faculty participation and repairing
Stanford/Hoover relations since the 1982-83
dispute.
But Campbell refueled the fire by writing
in Hoover's 1986 annual report that with the
approval of the Reagan Library "It is not only

only the Hoover Institution that can boast of
a 'Reagan connection,' but also the entire
University."
Instead of remaining prudently neutral,
Campbell chose to imply a partisan agenda at
Hoover that is unfair to the University, and
probably an unfair characterization of the
work of Hoover scholars themselves. To dis
miss his statement as personal opinion is to
ignore the facts — he is director and was
writing in an official capacity. His remarks
are embarrassing to Stanford and counter
productive to a hard-won process of reconcil
iation between Hoover and the University.
Campbell's comments are a return to the
rhetoric that originally sparked the contro
versy four years ago, and undermine the Uni
versity's already tenuous position.
The establishment of the Reagan Library
has further complicated the issue of par
tisanship at Stanford, especially since
Campbell heads the Ronald Reagan Presi
dential Foundation, which is currently
raising funds for the library and for the off
campus Reagan Public Affairs Center.
But whatever his political sympathies, no
highly placed University official should speak
of the University in partisan terms.
