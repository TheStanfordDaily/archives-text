Eliminate only
two out of three
housing options
When I was a prospective Stan
ford freshman, one of the aspects
of the University that attracted
me most was the availability and
diversity of housing available to
undergraduates. Therefore, I
believe that the recent proposals
concerning freshman housing
deserve a serious appraisal from *
the prospective student's point of
view. With that in mind, let's look
at what the proposed changes are
and what their impact would be.
The first change would be an
Increased emphasis on choice of
Western Culture track in housing
decisions. With this change, most
of the students who are in a par
ticular Western Culture track
would live in the same dormitory.
The charge raised against this
proposal is that it would neces
sarily limit the diversity of stu
dents within a dorm. However,
just because students are in the
same Western Culture track
doesn't mean that all of them
think, act or look alike. Further
more, the relative success of pro
grams such as Structured Liberal
Education, Great Works, and
Literature and the Arts shows
that such clustering can be bene
ficial and is worthy of at least a
one-year trial in all of the
residences where freshmen live.
The second change would
prevent freshmen from having
the choice between a four-class or
an all-freshman dormitory. Fresh
men would be arbitrarily assigned
to one or the other type of dor-

mitory. The key point to be made
about this proposal concerns the
relative similarity of these two
types of dorms. The lifestyle dif
ferences between a four-class and
a freshman dorm are not great
enough for most prospective
freshmen to strongly prefer one
over the other, and It seems clear
that the elimination of the choice
between the two would not cause
any great hardship for the
majority of freshmen.
The final change, however,
upsets what otherwise could be a
workable proposal. Under this
change, freshmen would no
longer be able to choose between
a single-sex or a coed corridor in
their dormitories. Many students,
though, have a strong preference
for one type of corridor over the
other for personal reasons, and
eliminating the choice between
the two could disenchant many
freshmen. Therefore, I urge the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies to at least take these
personal preferences into account
and continue to allow freshmen
to choose between single-sex and
coed corridors.

Freshman, undeclared
No one isolated
Zetes except
themselves
Atrocious! Michael Myers'
recent response to an editorial
(Daily, Jan. 30) was nothing more
than an immature, timid and
artless attempt to criticize Resi-

dential Education not only for its
policy regarding the Zetes, but
also for providing residential
support bases for students of like
race and like educational inter
ests.
I seriously doubt that either
Asst. Dean of Students Affairs
Diana Conklin or The Daily has
unduly forced any white, hetero
sexual males to consider them
selves pariahs here at Stanford.
Rather, Conklin and The Daily
have, with good reason, called
attention to the few (although the
number appears to be growing at
an alarming rate) white hetero
sexual males whose drunken,
belligerent actions have brought
pariah status unto themselves.
The fact that a popular, out
spoken, white, heterosexual male
can so casually associate blacks,
Hispanics, and Orientals with
lepers is the fundamental reason
that the existence of theme
houses is so crucial to ensuring
that all Stanford students have
an opportunity to grow, both
socially and intellectually.
I agree that the present Zetes
should be given back their house;
mainly because I too feel that they
should not be punished for ac
tions committed by past students
six years ago. But come now. does
Myers really believe that the
return of the Zete's house will add
as much value to maintaining the
diversity of this campus as did
the creation of ethnic theme
houses?
Yes Michael, it's time we do call
a spade a spade.
