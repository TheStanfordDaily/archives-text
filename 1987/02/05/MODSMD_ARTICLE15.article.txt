# Homosexuality is a sin

Scott Schulz concluded his last column (Dally,
Jan. 29) with the statement, "I have a personal
dream that someday (John's) church and his society
will accept him as he Is and stop telling him that
homosexuality Is wrong." Since Schulz addresses
the church (and I assume the Christian one). I feel
compelled to point out that, though this is a very
noble sentiment. Christianity can no more change
its beliefs and convictions than one can force two
plus two to equal five.

And why not? Because God made the standard for
Christianity; man did not. "Now we know that God's
judgment against those who do such things is based
on truth" (Romans 2:2). and truth is immutable. For
example, the law of gravity stipulates that what goes
up must come down. Having accepted this as truth,
we cannot alter it by our mere desire to change it. No
matter how earnestly we may want to Jump up and
never come down, our wishing it were so doesn't
change the truth of the law of gravity. It Is the same
way with God's standard, which is truth in the abso
lute sense.
Christianity, whose standards are set by God. can
not change its convictions Just because society finds
them unpalatable. Therefore, since God says
homosexuality is unnatural and sinful (cf. Romans
1:18-28). how can Christians accept anything else?
By the way, the Bible directly contradicts what
Schulz believes. He writes, "despite what the bigots
and the many ignorant people of our culture say,
homosexuality Is neither abnormal or unnatural."
We should not alter the truth to match our
feelings, which change like shifting shadows. On the

contrary, we must change our views to match God's
standard, which is, by definition, perfect and im
mutable.
Lest anyone should conclude that Christians thus
have a "right" to condemn homosexuals, something
more needs to be said. Nowadays, we may be too
quick to equate the sin with the sinner. However.
Christ made the distinction, and so should we.
Jesus was often seen by the Pharisees associating
with the tax collectors and "sinners." The self
righteous Pharisees condemned these people and
muttered. "This man (Jesus) welcomes sinners and
eats with them." {Luke 14:2) Admittedly, many
people today are akin to those ancient Pharisees,
ostracizing those whom they call "sinners."
But who are the "sinners"? We are the sinners; big
or small, we all sin in many ways (1 John 1:8). And
just as the Bible calls alcoholism, sexual immorality,
gossiping, lying or haughtiness sin. so also it consid
ers homosexuality sin. To God. sin is sin. and He
calls us to do away with all our sinning (Isaiah 1:16),
no matter what form that sinning takes.
So Jesus ate with people much like you and me;
people whose sins were public knowledge, and people
whose sins were hidden to human eyes. Yet Jesus
made it clear that, though He hated their sins. He
loved the sinners.
Likewise, even though Christians have a duty to
hate homosexuality, as any sin. they also have a duty
not to condemn the homosexuals themselves; "There
is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able
to save and destroy. But you — who are you to judge
your neighbor?" (James 4:12)
So to conclude. I agree that a noble dream would be
for society to stop condemning homosexual individ
uals. However. God's standard will never allow Chris
tians to stop seeing homosexuality Itself as wrong.
