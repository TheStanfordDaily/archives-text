# Failing to face racism
## 
### 
So, the debate surrounding the Issue of racial
policy has begun again, and this time around it
seems to have inspired much more hostility than it
has on recent occasions. For a while It appeared that
most Americans shunted aside questions of race re
lations, that the urgent debate of the 60s and 70s
had by the 80s lost Its erection.
But In December, the racially-motivated assaults
in Howard Beach, N.Y., shattered that illusion. And I
find myself in an increasingly awkward position —
as though battle lines are being drawn. I've been here
before; moments like these puncture a complacent
existence, an existence that shields — or at least
tries to forget — the naked racial tension that lurks
in the streets of less highbrow settings.

The story of the racial attacks has been the center
of news reports for over a month now. And since
headlines drive public policy these days. Congress
has managed to rise to the occasion. Whenever
public policy touches those sensitive political nerves
(like racial policy), reason and clear thinking take a
vacation.
Congress, especially, has a nasty little habit of
trying to prove to its constituents just how fine and
decent it really is. In redundant, emotional speeches
and news conferences congressmen denounce rac
ism "in all its forms," and call for committees to
debate the problem, commissions to study the prob
lem and communities to apologize for the problem.
Congress is concerned with saying the right thing
and doing the right thing. In fact, no one is quite
sure what the right thing is. Or isn't.
Here Is an example: Close to 50 percent of black
families are single-parent families, families whose
children score well below the median white child's
standardized test scores. Nearly 30 percent of these
black children are high school dropouts. Why are
clearly significant issues such as this, symptomatic
of a more deeply rooted problem, never talked about
openly and dealt with as pressing social crises? Why
does it take the death of a young black man to Inspire
a debate on racial policy, and then have this debate
confined to emotion-ladened rhetoric that misses the
point? And who's going to tell that circus on the Hill
that all the liberal social programs didn't work?
Someone was bound to notice these impressive new
sets of statistics.
It's convenient for Congress not to notice these
trends. This is deplorable and many embarrassed
politicians know it. Still, they'd rather not talk about
these things. Maybe they don't like to talk about it
because they think that it impugns the morality of
black people in America, and that's a subject that no
politician wants to go near. Or so we thought. Then
Daniel Patrick Moynlhan opened his big mouth.
Once upon a time Mr. Moynlhan, as assistant sec
retary of labor in the Johnson administration, spec
ulated on the root of these problems. He stated that
the crises confronting the black family — the

epidemic rise in the number of illegitimate children
born in black communities, the high percentage of
female-headed households — are the result of years
of oppression. In case you're wondering how the left
and most of the right responded, they all went
bonkers, shrieking wildly and calling names.
When the dust finally settled. Mr. Moynihan was
labelled a confirmed racist. The reaction was typi
cally lunatic. Whether or not you agree with
Moynihan (most didn't) is beside the point. Broken
families are a concern of everybody, white or black,
not merely of the unfortunate victims, white or
black. Those who chose to enter the fray couldn't see
beyond the fact that Moynihan had the gall to say
what he said.
The dust — along with the bad feelings and the
embarrassing statistics — were swept quickly and
neatly under the rug and America reconstructed her
illusions. Mr. Moynihan's concern amounted to little
more than a political hiccup.
Today's crusade for racial harmony maintains its
irrational symmetry by being a deeply felt priority,
but at the same time being blackly evasive — even ig
norant — in its modes of deliberation. Mere mention
of the word racism sends a selsmographic shudder
through the souls of most Americans, creating ob
vious problems.
Two friends of mine, who happen to be white, have
told me that they often feel inhibited from expressing
their true feelings on issues that touch racial policy.
They fear, for example, that to condemn affirmative
action is to admit racist tendencies. They are justi
fied in their fears; I've seen it happen and heard it
said too often. White people are supposed to feel.
ahem, guilty.
We do nothing beyond giving lip service to the
familiar incantations of the evils of racism, drasti
cally avoiding the real tensions these very evils
create. There is a lot of resentment and bad feeling
that festers beneath the calm exterior of this
programmed debate. But our society considers it
much more appropriate to affect postures of noble
idealism and trite empathy rather than to open the
valve to hidden distresses.
To further complicate matters, most blacks have a
hard time getting beyond the fact that our predeces
sors were indeed victimized by systematic discrimi
nation and had to deal with the consequences of
living in a prejudiced society. Even today we are still
grumbling about racism this and racism that, and
by the end of the day. when the lists are made and
the heads counted, we still find ourselves in large
numbers on the outside looking In — because we
spent all day grumbling. We have energized the idea
of racism to such a degree that it now looms larger
than the actual problem.
Am I being naive about the existence of racism? I
don't think so. Yes, pockets of hostility still exist,
and there probably always will be traces of racism in
our society. Still we are, In large measure, respon
sible for our own successes, as well as our own fail
ures. It is time we shifted our focus from what we
couldn't do yesterday to what we can do today. James
Baldwin spoke the same language. Of upward move
ment and black people he has said: "Today It is a
question of maturing, of growing up, of accepting
our history, and where this history has brought us."

Here Is an example: Close to 50 percent of black
families are single-parent families, families whose
children score well below the median white child's
standardized test scores. Nearly 30 percent of these
black children are high school dropouts. Why are
clearly significant issues such as this, symptomatic
of a more deeply rooted problem, never talked about
openly and dealt with as pressing social crises? Why
does it take the death of a young black man to Inspire
a debate on racial policy, and then have this debate
confined to emotion-ladened rhetoric that misses the
point? And who's going to tell that circus on the Hill
that all the liberal social programs didn't work?
Someone was bound to notice these impressive new
sets of statistics.
It's convenient for Congress not to notice these
trends. This is deplorable and many embarrassed
politicians know it. Still, they'd rather not talk about
these things. Maybe they don't like to talk about it
because they think that it impugns the morality of
black people in America, and that's a subject that no
politician wants to go near. Or so we thought. Then
Daniel Patrick Moynlhan opened his big mouth.
Once upon a time Mr. Moynlhan, as assistant sec
retary of labor in the Johnson administration, spec
ulated on the root of these problems. He stated that
the crises confronting the black family — the

epidemic rise in the number of illegitimate children
born in black communities, the high percentage of
female-headed households — are the result of years
of oppression. In case you're wondering how the left
and most of the right responded, they all went
bonkers, shrieking wildly and calling names.
When the dust finally settled. Mr. Moynihan was
labelled a confirmed racist. The reaction was typi
cally lunatic. Whether or not you agree with
Moynihan (most didn't) is beside the point. Broken
families are a concern of everybody, white or black,
not merely of the unfortunate victims, white or
black. Those who chose to enter the fray couldn't see
beyond the fact that Moynihan had the gall to say
what he said.
The dust — along with the bad feelings and the
embarrassing statistics — were swept quickly and
neatly under the rug and America reconstructed her
illusions. Mr. Moynihan's concern amounted to little
more than a political hiccup.
Today's crusade for racial harmony maintains its
irrational symmetry by being a deeply felt priority,
but at the same time being blackly evasive — even ig
norant — in its modes of deliberation. Mere mention
of the word racism sends a selsmographic shudder
through the souls of most Americans, creating ob
vious problems.
Two friends of mine, who happen to be white, have
told me that they often feel inhibited from expressing
their true feelings on issues that touch racial policy.
They fear, for example, that to condemn affirmative
action is to admit racist tendencies. They are justi
fied in their fears; I've seen it happen and heard it
said too often. White people are supposed to feel.
ahem, guilty.
We do nothing beyond giving lip service to the
familiar incantations of the evils of racism, drasti
cally avoiding the real tensions these very evils
create. There is a lot of resentment and bad feeling
that festers beneath the calm exterior of this
programmed debate. But our society considers it
much more appropriate to affect postures of noble
idealism and trite empathy rather than to open the
valve to hidden distresses.
To further complicate matters, most blacks have a
hard time getting beyond the fact that our predeces

spent all day grumbling. We have energized the idea
of racism to such a degree that it now looms larger
than the actual problem.

don't think so. Yes, pockets of hostility still exist,

our society. Still we are, In large measure, respon

couldn't do yesterday to what we can do today. James

our history, and where this history has brought us."

So, the debate surrounding the Issue of racial
policy has begun again, and this time around it
seems to have inspired much more hostility than it
has on recent occasions. For a while It appeared that
most Americans shunted aside questions of race re
lations, that the urgent debate of the 60s and 70s
had by the 80s lost Its erection.
But In December, the racially-motivated assaults
in Howard Beach, N.Y., shattered that illusion. And I
find myself in an increasingly awkward position —
as though battle lines are being drawn. I've been here
before; moments like these puncture a complacent
existence, an existence that shields — or at least
tries to forget — the naked racial tension that lurks
in the streets of less highbrow settings.

The story of the racial attacks has been the center
of news reports for over a month now. And since
headlines drive public policy these days. Congress
has managed to rise to the occasion. Whenever
public policy touches those sensitive political nerves
(like racial policy), reason and clear thinking take a
vacation.
Congress, especially, has a nasty little habit of
trying to prove to its constituents just how fine and
decent it really is. In redundant, emotional speeches
and news conferences congressmen denounce rac
ism "in all its forms," and call for committees to
debate the problem, commissions to study the prob
lem and communities to apologize for the problem.
Congress is concerned with saying the right thing
and doing the right thing. In fact, no one is quite
sure what the right thing is. Or isn't.
Here Is an example: Close to 50 percent of black
families are single-parent families, families whose
children score well below the median white child's
standardized test scores. Nearly 30 percent of these
black children are high school dropouts. Why are
